The '''2011 AFF U-23 Youth Championship''' was going to be the second edition of the tournament which was set to take place between the 16 and 26 July 2011 in [[Palembang]], [[Indonesia]] but was postponed on 7 July because the [[Gelora Sriwijaya Stadium]] was under renovation and would be moved to Jakarta.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.aseanfootball.org/?p=5381 |title=PRE-SEA GAMES CHAMPIONSHIP IN PALEMBANG POSTPONED |work=AseanFootball.org |publisher=ASEAN Football Federation |date=2011-07-06 |accessdate=2011-07-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was considered by the [[ASEAN Football Federation]] as the preparatory tournament for the [[Football at the 2011 Southeast Asian Games|2011 Southeast Asian Games]], which would also be held in [[Indonesia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.aseanfootball.org/?p=4186 |title=Laos and Indonesia hold two AFF tournaments each in 2011 |work=AseanFootball.org |publisher=ASEAN Football Federation |date=2011-02-19 |accessdate=2011-05-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2011 competition was later cancelled.

__NOTOC__
Year '''457 BC''' was a year of the [[Roman calendar|pre-Julian Roman calendar]]. At the time, it was known as the '''Year of the Consulship of Pulvillus and Augurinus''' or '''Cincinnatus and Vibulanus''' (or, less frequently, '''year 297 ''[[Ab urbe condita]]'''''). The denomination 457 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the [[Anno Domini]] [[calendar era]] became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.
== Events ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;
=== By place ===
==== Greece ====
* [[Athens]], the leader of the [[Delian League]], comes into conflict with [[Corinth]] and its ally [[Sparta]] (leader of the [[Peloponnesian League]]) over [[Megara]]. [[Nicodemes]] of Sparta, regent for King [[Pleistoanax]], leads an army of 11,500 [[hoplites]] into [[Boeotia]] to help [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]] put down a rebellion by [[Phocis]].
* Athenian forces block the routes back to the [[Peloponnese]], so the Spartans decide to remain in Boeotia and await the Athenian attack. The Athenians and their allies, with 14,000 men under the command of [[Myronides]], meet the Spartans at [[Battle of Tanagra (457 BC)|Battle of Tanagra]]. The Spartans win the battle, but they lose many men and so are unable to follow up on their victory.
* The Athenians regroup after the battle and march into Boeotia. Led by Myronides, the Athenians defeat the Boeotians in the [[Battle of Oenophyta]], and then destroy the walls of Tanagra and ravage [[Locris]] and [[Phocis]].
* Athens goes on to defeat [[Aegina]] later in the year, and to finish the construction of the Long Walls to the Athenian port of [[Piraeus]] (an action opposed by Sparta).
* Boeotia, Phocis and Opuntian Locris become members of the Delian League. Athens now has enrolled in the Delian League all the Boeotian cities except Thebes. [[Aegina]] is forced to become a member of the League.  It is assessed, with [[Thasos]], for a yearly contribution to the League of 30 [[Talent (measurement)|talents]].
* The [[Zeus]] Temple at [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]] is completed.  The forty-foot [[statue of Zeus]] inside it becomes one of the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World]].
&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;
==== Persia ====
* [[Artaxerxes I]] issues a decree to rebuild [[Jerusalem]].

'''''A Child's Wish''''' is a [[television movie|made-for-television movie]] based on actual events. [[John Ritter]] stars as a father of a terminally ill 16-year-old girl portrayed by [[Anna Chlumsky]].

==Plot==
Ritter portrays Ed Chandler, a father who is fired from his job for taking time off to tend to his 16-year-old daughter Missy (Chlumsky), who is battling [[cancer]]. Rather than accepting his dismissal, Ed decides to fight back. With the help of a [[United States Senate|United States senator]], he lobbies the [[United States Congress]] and is the stimulus to passage of the [[Family and Medical Leave Act]]. Because Missy's cancer is life-threatening, she is visited by the [[Make-A-Wish Foundation]], and she wishes to go to the [[White House]], visit the [[Oval Office]], and hopefully see President [[Bill Clinton]]. Although Make-A-Wish is not so sure if they can grant her wish, in the end she does in fact get to visit the Oval Office and meet President [[Bill Clinton]], playing himself in a cameo appearance.

Missy is based on the merging of two women, Melissa Weaver and Dixie Yandle. Ed Chandler's character is very closely related to George Yandle, who with his wife Vicki, helped push the Family Medical Leave Act through Congress after being fired from their jobs to care for their daughter that suffered with cancer. In real life, Vicki Yandle was on stage with President Clinton when the law was signed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/04/garden/family-leave-bill-peace-of-mind-issue.html Family-Leave Bill: Peace of Mind Issue] New York Times, 4 February 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Use mdy dates|date=April 2018}}
'''Age fabrication''' occurs when a person deliberately misrepresents their true age. This is usually done with the intent to garner privileges or [[Social status|status]] that would not otherwise be available to the person. It may be done through the use of oral or written statements or through the altering, doctoring or forging of [[vital records]].

On some occasions, age is increased so as to make cut-offs for minimum legal or employable age in showbusiness or professional sports. Sometimes it is not the people themselves who lower their public age, but others around them such as [[publicist]]s, parents, and other handlers.  Most cases involve taking or adding one or two years to their age. However, in more extreme cases such as with [[Al Lewis (actor)|Al Lewis]] and [[Charo]], a decade has been added or subtracted. Official state documents (such as [[birth certificate|birth]], [[marriage license|marriage]] and [[death certificate]]s, the census, and other [[identity document]]s) typically provide the correct date.

Although uncommon in modern [[Western society]], it is still possible for a person not to know their exact date of birth. Such a person may arbitrarily choose a date of birth which after later research is found to be false. This situation should not be considered age fabrication as there is no obvious intent to deceive on the part of the individual.

Subtracting time from one's age is often known in English as "shaving", while adding time to one's age may be referred to as "padding".

*[[Danny Almonte]] (born April 7, 1987) played in the [[Little League World Series]] for his [[Bronx]] team in 2001, despite being over the cutoff age for the league.  His parents had provided a doctored [[birth certificate]] misrepresenting his birth year as 1989.  A ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' writer discovered the discrepancy when Almonte's [[Dominican Republic|Dominican]] elementary school records gave his correct birth year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/more/news/2001/08/27/almonte_questions_ap/ Little League investigating: SI uncovers document that disputes Almonte's age].

*American golfer [[Tom Shaw (golfer)|Tom Shaw]] claimed throughout his career on the [[PGA Tour]] to have been born on December 13, 1942. He was suspected by some of being older, notably by Frank Hannigan, who as Executive Director of the [[United States Golf Association]] paired him with the then-19-year-old [[Ben Crenshaw]] and 24-year-old [[Johnny Miller]], both known as fast players, for the first two rounds of the [[1971 U.S. Open (golf)|1971]] [[U.S. Open (golf)|U.S. Open]] for his apparent amusement. As it turned out, Hannigan was right; in 1988, Shaw produced a birth certificate proving that he had been born on the same date in 1938, which made him eligible for the Senior PGA Tour (now [[PGA Tour Champions]]) starting with the 1989 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Majors: In Pursuit of Golf's Holy Grail |first=John |last=Feinstein |authorlink=John Feinstein |isbn=978-0-316-27795-2 |publisher=[[Little, Brown and Company]] |location=Boston |year=2000 |page=199}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the entertainment industry==

Age fabrication is common in the entertainment industry. Many actresses subtract at least one year from their actual age so that producers and casting directors will be more likely to hire them for roles, or for publicity purposes. ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' joked in 1949:{{r|time19490822}}

{{quote|To find the age of a star, a Hollywood [[press agent|press-agent]] takes the year of her (or his) birth, subtracts it from itself, and burns the paper the numbers were written on; then adds last week's fan mail to the [[box office|box-office receipts]] from the star's last picture, subtracts her salary, divides the remainder by the number of press agents assigned to care for her career, subtracts the number of her marriages, adds three months for every child she has had (things grow fast in the sub tropics), and knocks off ten years just for gallantry. If the age is still higher than the one the boss ordered, he works in slight mathematical errors until the answer comes out right.&lt;ref name="time19490822"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,800624,00.html | title=Elizabeth Taylor: Star Rising | accessdate=March 23, 2011 | date=August 22, 1949 |work=Time}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Actors===
*[[Gracie Allen]], comedian, was notorious for keeping her true age concealed and even her husband [[George Burns]] did not know her exact age. Various sources claim she was born on July 26 in 1894, 1895, 1897, 1902 or 1906. Her exact age could not be retrieved by a birth certificate, as it was destroyed in the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake]]. Allen herself gave her year of birth as 1906, despite the fact the earthquake occurred three months before her birthday that year. When the 1900 [[United States Census]] became public information, the true year was revealed as 1895, which meant she was actually a few months older than her husband.&lt;ref name="fn_1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.genealogy.com/famousfolks/gracie-allen/index.htm |title=Ancestry of Gracie Allen |publisher=Genealogy.com |date=July 18, 2002 |accessdate=August 2, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120503085054/http://www.genealogy.com/famousfolks/gracie-allen/d0/i0000001.htm#s1 |archivedate=May 3, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Sandra Bullock]]'s birthdate was erroneously given as July 26 in 1965, 1966, and 1967 for most of her early career. In 1997 ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' discovered that the correct year was 1964.
*[[Irene Cara]]'s exact age was a mystery for most of her career, with various sources claiming that she was born on March 18 in either 1964 or 1959. In 2004 the [[Associated Press]] retrieved a copy of her voter registration records from Florida, which verified that she was actually born in 1959. Cara vehemently claimed that she was born in 1964, but refused to comment on the voter registration records.
*[[Charo]] is often accused of trimming 10 years from her age. In 1977, a [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] federal district court allowed Charo's claim to be born in 1951 and that her March 13, 1941 birth date on her original Spanish birth certificate, passport, and naturalization papers was incorrect based on affidavits submitted by Charo's parents, a claim that has been viewed with skepticism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lasvegassun.com/news/2009/jul/20/playful-and-ageless-charo-sultry-sensation-still/ "Playful and ageless, Charo a sultry sensation still"], ''Las Vegas Sun'', July 20, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The same judge who permitted Charo to change her legal age issued a near-identical order finding that Charo's older sister Carmen Martinez Molina was 29, not 40 as stated in her Spanish passport.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1129&amp;dat=19771110&amp;id=EIBIAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=OW0DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7006,1824348&amp;hl=en "Charo, Sister 'Younger'"] ''Pittsburgh Post-Gazette'', November 10, 1977&lt;/ref&gt; That order was similarly premised on affidavits submitted by Carmen's parents, who claimed that Carmen was 11 years younger than stated in all Spanish public records.

==In politics==
*[[Joseph Stalin]], born December 18 (December 6 [[Julian calendar|OS]]), 1878, changed the date to December 21, 1879, later in his life for unknown reasons. The December 18, 1878, birth date is maintained by his birth registry, his school leaving certificate, his extensive tsarist Russia police file, and all other surviving pre-revolution documents. Russian playwright and historian Edward Radzinski argues in his book, ''Stalin'', that Stalin changed the year to 1879 to have a national birthday celebration of his 50th birthday. He could not do it in 1928 because his rule was not absolute enough. The incorrect December 21, 1879, date was printed in many almanacs and encyclopaedia during Stalin's reign and remains one of the most widely reported incorrect dates of birth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.classicalvalues.com/archives/001189.html When was Stalin born?].

*[[Gary Hart]], former senator from Colorado and 1984 and 1988 Democratic presidential candidate, originally claimed in campaign and Senate biographies that he was born on November 28, 1937, when in fact he was one year older exactly, this fact unearthed after he briefly overtook Walter Mondale as the party front-runner in the 1984 primary race. This among other things (his name change from Hartpence mainly) would be a nagging source of controversy throughout his national political career.

However, he resigned from ABC News in June 2007, after some ABC officials raised questions about his credentials.&lt;ref name=WP/&gt;
==Background==
An in-depth inquiry into his work as a consultant cleared his reporting, according to ABC News President David Westin. That investigation found no instances of false reporting, ABC said, but did uncover four details about operations and meetings in Pakistan that could not be confirmed. "None of these discrepancies would rise to the level of a formal, on-air retraction because none of them was material to the substance of our report," Mr. Westin wrote in an internal memo&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Brian |last=Stelter |title=In Inquiry, ABC News Clears Work of a Fired Consultant |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/23/business/media/23abc.html |publisher=The New York Times |date= October 23, 2007 }} {{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Amanda Dick |url= http://media.www.gwhatchet.com/media/storage/paper332/news/2007/11/12/News/Debat.Cleared.Of.Suspicion.By.Abc-3094084.shtml |title=Debat cleared of suspicion by ABC |publisher= [[GW Hatchet]] |date=November 12, 2007 }} {{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; ABC has however deleted articles by Alexis Debat, replaced by the notice "This story has been removed from our Web site because of questions raised about the credibility of one of its authors, Alexis Debat."&lt;ref&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/International/Terrorism/story?id=1527351 abcnews.go.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

Kerry Smith, ABC's senior vice president for editorial quality, who headed up the inquiry, described the process as "particularly sensitive" because it involved re-reporting on confidential sources, belonging not just to Mr. Debat but to other, current ABC reporters—reflecting the collective nature of investigative work. At one point, Ms. Smith sent a three-person team, which included an Urdu speaker and producer Rhonda Schwartz, to Pakistan to determine whether Mr. Debat went to the hotels he said he did, and to confirm that he met with the people he said he met with.&lt;ref name=Observer&gt;Felix Gillette, [http://www.observer.com/2007/debat-debate-0 Debat Debate], ''[[The New York Observer]]'', October 30, 2007 {{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with ''[[The New York Observer]]'' in 2007, Debat said he felt cautiously pleased for himself and for his former colleagues by the results of the inquiry. "I'm very happy that their collective reputation is salvaged," said Mr. Debat.&lt;ref name=Observer/&gt;

In September 2007, the French news media ''[[Rue 89]]'' alleged that two interviews, one of [[Barack Obama]] and the other of former US Federal Reserve Chairman [[Alan Greenspan]], both published in the French magazine ''[[Politique Internationale]]'', had been fabricated.&lt;ref name=Pascal&gt;[[Pascal Riché]], [http://www.rue89.com/2007/09/05/une-fausse-interview-dobama-dans-politique-internationale Une fausse interview d'Obama dans Politique Internationale] {{fr icon}} / [http://www.rue89.com/2007/09/07/a-fake-interview-with-barack-obama-in-a-french-well-regarded-review A fake interview with Barack Obama in a French well-regarded review] {{en icon}}, ''[[Rue 89]]'', September 5, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=R89&gt;[[Pascal Riché]], [http://www.rue89.com/2007/09/13/apres-la-fausse-interview-dobama-celle-de-greenspan Après la fausse interview d'Obama, celle de Greenspan], ''[[Rue 89]]'', September 13, 2007 {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Brian Ross (journalist)|Brian Ross]] and Justin Rood [http://blogs.abcnews.com/theblotter/2007/09/obama-claims-in.html Obama Claims Interview in French Magazine Faked], [[ABC News]], September 12, 2007 {{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; These allegations in turn led to Debat's voluntary resignation, allegedly for "personal reasons",&lt;ref name=MJ/&gt; from ''[[The National Interest]]'' and the [[Nixon Center]]. Many other personalities also since stated that ''Politique Internationale'' published bogus interviews of them. The list included former US President [[Bill Clinton]], US Speaker of the House [[Nancy Pelosi]], former US Secretary of State [[Colin Powell]], New York Mayor [[Michael Bloomberg]], Microsoft founder [[Bill Gates]], and former U.N. Secretary-General [[Kofi Annan]].&lt;ref name=ABC&gt;[[Brian Ross (journalist)|Brian Ross]]: [http://blogs.abcnews.com/theblotter/2007/09/pelosi-greenspa.html Clinton, Pelosi, Greenspan, Powell, Bloomberg, Gates, Annan Also Say Interviews 'Fakes'], [[ABC News]], September 13, 2007 {{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alexis Debat has denied ''Rue 89''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s allegations, and claimed that he was taking steps to charge ''Rue 89'' and [[Pascal Riché]], author of the story, for "[[defamation|slander]]. The trial is pending."&lt;ref name=Responds&gt;[http://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/2007/09/alexis_debat_responds.php Alexis Debat Respond], ''[[Talking Points Memo]]'', September 2007 {{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; He admitted however having made "a mistake" for Obama's interview.&lt;ref name=Responds/&gt; On the other hand, Debat also admitted he did not interview [[Bill Clinton]], Pelosi, Bloomberg, Gates, Greenspan or Annan, but that these "interviews" were piece together from speeches, with the consent of Patrick Wasjman, the director of ''Politique Internationale''.&lt;ref name=ABC/&gt; He has also claimed that "a technicality" had prevented the Sorbonne University from issuing his PhD, which he had not been made aware of.&lt;ref name=Observer/&gt;

Alexis Debat does not respond anymore at his phone number, and he has left the United States.&lt;ref name=Monde/&gt;&lt;ref name=Libe/&gt;

==Controversy over "expert" status==
Debat was a respected expert on terrorism issues, writing for example on the [[Jundallah (Iran)|Jundallah]] Balochi and Sunni organisation,&lt;ref&gt;Alexis Debat, [http://blogs.abcnews.com/theblotter/2007/04/crackdown_in_th.html Crackdown on the Secret War Against Iran], ABC News, April 13, 2007 {{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the [[Tabligh]] organisation, on [[Iran]] and many other subjects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/search?searchtext=%22alexis%20debat%22&amp;type= Articles by Alexis Debat], on [[ABC News|ABC News Search]]&lt;/ref&gt; Two days before ''Rue 89'' 's revelations, Alexis Debat was the source of a ''[[The Sunday Times|Sunday Times]]'' article claiming that [[The Pentagon]] had a "‘three-day blitz’ plan for Iran".&lt;ref&gt;[[Sarah Baxter]], [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article2369001.ece Pentagon ‘three-day blitz’ plan for Iran], ''[[The Sunday Times]]'', September 2, 2007 {{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an article published by ''[[National Journal]]'', [[Laura Rozen]] has questioned Debat's account of alleged US support to the Jundallah in purported covert operations against Iran.&lt;ref&gt;Laura Rozen, [http://www.warandpiece.com/blogdirs/006241.html "Keeping Iran Off Balance"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070629023232/http://www.warandpiece.com/blogdirs/006241.html |date=June 29, 2007 }}, ''[[National Journal]]'', June 8, 2007 {{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; This ABC report by Debat had itself been angrily denied by [[Pakistan]] official sources, ABC later reported. ABC precised that "ABC News stands by its reporting on this story."&lt;ref name=Rood&gt;Justin Rood and Gretchen Peters, [http://blogs.abcnews.com/theblotter/2007/04/pakistan_denoun.html Pakistan Denounces ABC News Report on Backing Iran Radicals], [[ABC News]], April 5, 2007 {{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Laura Rozen]] then explained that according to the [[Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments]], partially funded by the US government, Debat had been a paid employee of them, until the controversy lifted by ''Rue 89''.&lt;ref name=LR2&gt;[[Laura Rozen]], [http://motherjones.com/politics/2007/09/alexis-debats-pentagon-links-did-discredited-abc-consultant-get-dod-money-too Alexis Debat's Pentagon Links: Did the Discredited ABC Consultant Get DOD Money Too?], ''[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]'', September  18, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; [[Andrew Krepinevich]], head of the conservative think-tank, put the blame on the competitive aspect of medias, recalling : "''We had a contract with the Pentagon to do some work...We hired Alexis to support us in that work. His sole arrangement with us was as a consultant.&lt;ref name=LR2/&gt;'' 

Debat was paid as a "[[consultant]]" by ABC News,&lt;ref name=MJ/&gt; although he also wrote for ABC's ''The Blotter.''

Debat presented himself as "former advisor to the [[Minister of Defence (France)|French minister of Defense]] on Transatlantic Affairs," "visiting lecturer at [[Middlebury College]]" and claimed that he was at work on a manuscript on the history of the [[Central Intelligence Agency]].&lt;ref&gt;Alexis Debat, [http://www.inthenationalinterest.com/Articles/Vol2Issue30/Vol2Issue30Debat.html 9/11: Not A Failure. A Choice.], ''[[The National Interest]]'', vol. 2, issue 30 {{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

In an interview on PBS in Autumn 2005, during the [[2005 civil unrest in France|riots in the French suburbs]], he was introduced as a former [[social work]]er, claiming he had worked in [[Martine Aubry]]'s foundation, ''[[Fondation Agir Contre l'Exclusion]]'' (FACE).&lt;ref name=Pascal/&gt; On [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]], he claimed that "what started as isolated clashes quickly became a political opportunity for these people to put their situation at the forefront of the political debate to make headlines with their own situations," although he also underlined "a pervasive, very dark [[racism]] in French society that associates the second generation Muslims, these second generation immigrants with trouble."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/europe/july-dec05/france_11-07.html Rioting continues in France], [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]], November 7, 2005 {{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to his (now deleted) online biography at [[George Washington University]]'s Homeland Security Policy Institute (a US governmental [[think tank]]), Debat is additionally claimed to have worked as an analyst for the French government on the Counter-Terrorism Coordinating Committee, as an expert on Islamic finance and Islamic law for clients such as Deutsche Bank and the Japan External Trade Organization, as a contractor for the [[RAND]] think tank, as advisor for the [[Business for Diplomatic Action]] consortium, and once again for the French government as "a desk officer for the Ministry of Defense."&lt;ref name=GWbio&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070311233036/http://www.gwumc.edu/hspi/fellows/Debat_bio.htm Online biography] of Debat at [[George Washington University]]'s Homeland Security Policy Institute, archived by the [[Internet Archive]] {{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Jeffrey Schneider from ABC, suspicions were aroused when the [[Cabinet of France|French government]], in May 2007, told them that they were skeptical concerning Debat's scholarship credentials.&lt;ref name=ABC89&gt;Guillemette Faure, [http://www.rue89.com/2007/09/12/abc-news-investigates-one-of-its-terrorism-experts ABC NEWS investigates one of its terrorism experts], ''[[Rue 89]]'', September 12, 2007 {{en icon}} [http://www.rue89.com/2007/09/12/abc-news-enquete-sur-les-scoops-de-son-expert Original article] {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thereafter, ABC launched an investigation which in June 2007 led to his resignation, before inspecting all of his preceding work for ABC.&lt;ref name=ABC89/&gt; ''Rue 89'', however, pointed out that according to the French government, ABC was the first to contact the French embassy, and not otherwise.&lt;ref name=ABC89/&gt;&lt;ref name=Whistle/&gt; The latter answered them that it was not their job to verify credentials. Thereafter, ABC requested to the French embassy the contacts of the French Minister of Defence in order to verify this point in Debat's Curriculum Vitae.&lt;ref name=ABC89/&gt; This point was later confirmed by ABC itself, who declared that they had made a mistake.&lt;ref name=Whistle/&gt; ''Rue 89'' later announced that a [[whistleblower]] inside ABC News had launched an unofficial investigation on Debat in May 2007.&lt;ref name=Whistle&gt;[[Pascal Riché]], [http://www.rue89.com/2007/09/14/a-whistleblower-alerted-abc-news-about-the-reliability-of-its-consultant A whistleblower alerted ABC News about the reliability of its consultant], ''[[Rue 89]]'', September 14, 2007 {{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, two journalists at ABC have claimed that Debat's sensational articles were in fact supported by [[Brian Ross (journalist)|Brian Ross]], ABC chief investigative correspondent.&lt;ref name=MJ/&gt; [[Associated Press|AP]] news agency has stated that ABC was now sending long time Ross producer Rhonda Schwartz to Pakistan to counter-check Debat's articles.&lt;ref name=MJ/&gt; ''Rue 89'', however, questions ABC News' decision to let the control of the investigation to Brian Ross, who was Alexis Debat's direct superior.&lt;ref name=Cheat/&gt; This inquiry into Debat's work as a consultant cleared his reporting, according to ABC News President David Westin (see above).

==Early warnings==
Alexis Debat's credentials had been called into question once.

A spokesperson for the French defense Department asked ''[[Libération]]'' in September 2002 to run a correction after the French newspaper quoted Debat, presented as an "official at the French Defense Ministry", on the role [[Zacarias Moussaoui]] played in the [[September 11 attacks]]. The defense correspondent in ''Libération'', Jean Dominique Merchet, then published the correction, stating that Debat was not currently a defense official, but had been in the past.&lt;ref name=Cheat/&gt; The [[Agence France Press|AFP]] news agency also contradicted ABC News on September 6, 2002 by reporting that Debat (who was then interviewed in the case concerning Zacarias Moussaoui) had never been an "official" but a "desk officer" at the French Defence Ministry.&lt;ref&gt;[[Agence France Presse|AFP]], [http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=NewsLibrary&amp;p_multi=BBAB&amp;d_place=BBAB&amp;p_theme=newslibrary2&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0F97E79AD8C6E41E&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM French ministry denies source named in US TV terror report is ex-official], September 6, 2002 {{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;
After allegedly looking into the matter, ABC News continued to present him as "former official in the French Minister of Defense"&lt;ref&gt;[[Brian Ross (journalist)|Brian Ross]], [http://abcnews.go.com/2020/Story?id=123751 Is Saddam's Son More Brutal Than His Dad?], [[ABC News]], February 14, 2003 {{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;mdash; according to ''Rue 89'', he did make a brief passage at the ''[[Délégation aux Affaires stratégiques]]'' (Delegation of Strategic Affairs).&lt;ref name=Pascal/&gt;

[[Stéphane Dujarric]], chief spokesman for the UN secretary-general Kofi Annan, said he had denounced to Patrick Wajsman, head of ''Politique Internationale'', the bogus interview in June 2005.&lt;ref name=ABC/&gt;&lt;ref name=Cheat&gt;[[Guillemette Faure]] and [[Pascal Riché]], [http://www.rue89.com/2007/09/15/how-alexis-debat-managed-to-cheat-everyone-in-washington How Alexis Debat managed to cheat everyone in Washington], ''[[Rue 89]]'', September 15, 2007 {{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this warning, Debat continued to be cited by ''Politique Internationale'' as the author of interviews of international level personalities.&lt;ref name=ABC/&gt; When asked why he continued to work with Debat, Patrick Wajsman declared that "Everybody can be trusted once. He seemed to be well-connected in Washington, working for ABC and the Nixon center." Debat disputes this, and claims to have evidence that Wasjman asked him to piece together this interview from Annan's speeches.&lt;ref name=ABC/&gt;

'''All Souls Weekend''' is an event in [[Tucson]], [[Arizona]]. It draws on [[Mesoamerican]], [[Spaniards|Spanish]] [[Roman Catholic]], and [[Mexicans|Mexican]] rituals, incorporating many diverse cultural traditions with the common goal of honoring and remembering the deceased.&lt;ref name="AZ Republic"&gt;{{cite web|author1=C.

==Background==
All Souls Weekend is more commonly known as All Souls Procession weekend and is derived from the All Souls Procession,[http://www.kgun9.com/news/news-photo-gallery/guy-atchleys-arizona/2015-all-souls-procession-a-celebration-and-mourning-of-loved-ones-in-southern-arizona] an event first initiated and organized in 1990 by Tucson artist Susan Kay Johnson to "express her sorrow" over the recent death of her father and to initiate an artistic ritual in honor of the dead in Tucson.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tucsonweekly.com/tucson/to-mourn-and-to-honor/Content?oid=1519884|title=To Mourn and to Honor|last=Regan|first=Margaret|website=Tucson Weekly|access-date=2016-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson had studied [[art therapy]] based in part on the work of Swiss psychoanalyst [[Carl Jung]]&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/ci_21785043/all-souls-day-tradition-tucson|title=All Souls Day a tradition in Tucson|website=www.mercurynews.com|access-date=2016-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; including his study of [[Ritual|rituals]] in cultures around the world.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; After her father died, Johnson planned and invited other artists to participate in a three-day ritual, which lasted from [[Halloween]] through [[All Saints' Day|All Saints Day]] and ended on [[All Souls' Day|All Souls Day]]. The ritual took place in public and private spaces in downtown Tucson, and involved art objects Johnson created for the event. These objects included "a giant fabric-and-wire cocoon big enough to hold 15 masked performers who snaked through the neighborhood and emerged as butterflies to dance to the cue of a flute player."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; By 1991, public interest the ritual led Johnson and other artists to apply for a grant from the Tucson Partnership in order to involve the Tucson community in the event, through free public workshops in art and music followed by a large [[procession]].[http://manymouths.org/2011/09/a-bit-of-history/] One of the artists listed on the grant application, Mykl Wells, has reported that he helped Johnson write the 1991 grant application, on which his name is spelled "Michael Wells." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://manymouths.org/2011/09/a-bit-of-history/|title=Many Mouths One Stomach   » A Bit of History|website=manymouths.org|access-date=2016-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wells has reported that he helped inspire Johnson's initial planning of the 1990 All Souls Procession when he told Johnson about ''[[Day of the Dead|Día de los Muertos]]'' rituals he had witnessed in [[Guanajuato]], Mexico in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tucsonweekly.com/tucson/all-souls-all-community/Content?oid=4862314|title=All Souls All Community|website=Tucson Weekly|access-date=2016-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wildcat.arizona.edu/article/2014/09/artists-show-off-cardboard-crafting-skills-at-charity-event-to-benefit-all-souls-procession|title=Artists show off cardboard crafting skills at charity event to benefit All Souls Procession|website=www.wildcat.arizona.edu|access-date=2016-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Controversy== 
Organizers of All Souls Weekend have made explicit efforts to present the All Souls Procession and associated events as inclusive of but distinct in origin from ''[[Day of the Dead|Día de los Muertos]]'', partly in response to charges of [[cultural appropriation]] by academic critics who have charged that its organizers and participants have primarily been [[Anglo-Americans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://harlotofthearts.org/issues/issue_14/bentley/memories.html|title=Under the Mask: Creative Dis/Possessions of Borderlands Remembrance Practices {{!}} Lizzy Bentley, Joanna Sanchez-Avila {{!}} Harlot: A Revealing Look at the Arts of Persuasion|website=harlotofthearts.org|access-date=2016-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar charges have been directed at the Day of the Dead parade in the [[Mission District, San Francisco|Mission District]] in San Francisco. However, with All Souls Weekend events now bringing together over 100,000 people of varying backgrounds in a public celebration in downtown [[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]], the organizers influence but do not control the traditions participants choose to represent and honor in the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-ff-all-souls-tucson-20151111-story.html|title=100,000 in Tucson embrace Mexican approach to death with All Souls Procession|website=latimes.com|access-date=2016-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each year thousands of participants in All Souls Weekend activities choose to wear [[calavera]]-style makeup and objects, familiar to many in Tucson due to the city's location 50 miles from the US-Mexico border. After the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish conquest]] of middle America, ancient Mesoamerican rituals merged with Roman Catholic tradition&lt;ref name="Palfrey" /&gt; along with modern cultural interests in the Americas, yielding the holiday known today as ''[[Day of the Dead|Día de los Muertos]]'' in Spanish or [[Day of the Dead]] in English.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NZgIdQeVcS8C|title=Day of the Dead in the USA: The Migration and Transformation of a Cultural Phenomenon|last=Marchi|first=Regina|date=2009-06-09|publisher=Rutgers University Press|isbn=9780813548579|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; At least one writer has argued that All Soul’s Weekend in Tucson represents a further step in the evolution of [[precolonial]] Mesoamerican rituals and Day of the Dead.&lt;ref name="AZ Republic" /&gt;  Though there is evidence the All Souls Procession was directly inspired by the history of [[All Souls' Day|Day of the Dead,]] the organizers of the All Soul’s Weekend emphasize that the event includes and encourages all forms of individual expression, drawing from many cultures, religions, and rituals.&lt;ref name="The All Souls Procession, History"&gt;Many Mouths One Stomach. [http://allsoulsprocession.org/history "The All Souls Procession, History"], 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The mission of the weekend’s primary organizing body, [http://manymouths.org/ Many Mouths One Stomach (MMOS)], includes the perspective that death is a universal experience, uniting deceased loved ones with the living. MMOS intends All Soul’s Weekend to serve as an opportunity to approach death in a safe social setting.&lt;ref&gt;Many Mouths One Stomach. [http://manymouths.org/mission/ "Mission"], 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==All Soul's Procession==
All Soul’s Weekend culminates with its largest event, a parade called the All Soul’s Procession. According to MMOS, “The All Souls Procession is perhaps one of the most important, inclusive and authentic public ceremonies in [[North America]] today.”&lt;ref name="The All Souls Procession, History"/&gt; Participants often dress up, wear masks, paint their faces, create intricate [[Installation art|artistic installations]], and tow altars, also engaging in numerous other forms of expression in remembrance of the deceased. The deceased may include family, friends, pets, endangered species, fallen heroes, victims of war, or any other group that an individual feels deserving of remembrance. The procession is a forum for the community to engage in open authentic expression of [[grief]], loss, joy, and celebration.&lt;ref name="allsoulsprocession.org"&gt;Many Mouths One Stomach. [http://allsoulsprocession.org/faq "The All Souls Procession Weekend, FAQs"], 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The procession is led by a large steel container called The Urn in which procession attendees are invited to place prayers, photographs, and other remembrances of lost loved ones. At the end of the procession, The Urn is set on fire. Burning of The Urn serves the purpose of uniting individual remembrances into a one [[Catharsis|cathartic]] communal expression of both grief and celebration honoring lost loved ones.&lt;ref&gt;Many Mouths One Stomach. [http://manymouths.org/projects/ "Projects: The All Souls Procession Weekend"], 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;
==Attendance and Sponsorship==
Attendance to, and participation in, All Soul’s Weekend is free to the public. The event itself includes no [[Sponsor (commercial)|sponsor]] advertising. MMOS is a [[Nonprofit organization|non-profit organization]] funded exclusively by donations. All Soul’s Weekend costs approximately one dollar per attendee. The total cost for the 2014 procession was $109,850.&lt;ref name="Funding All Soul's Procession"&gt;Many Mouths One Stomach., &amp; Infogram. [https://infogr.am/funding-all-souls-procession?src=web "Funding All Soul's Procession] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141210035623/https://infogr.am/funding-all-souls-procession?src=web |date=2014-12-10 }}, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; MMOS expresses pride in the community based nature of All Soul’s Weekend and does not intend to seek corporate sponsorship as, “that funding is likely to come with requirements and obligations we are reluctant to take on”.&lt;ref name="allsoulsprocession.org"/&gt; Of all participants in the Procession, an average of 3,000 donate while 97,000 do not. Tax deductible donations from individuals and groups, including businesses and private organizations, may be made to MMOS in support of All Soul’s Weekend.&lt;ref name="Funding All Soul's Procession"/&gt;

==Synopsis==
;Act I
It is nearly Christmas, 1742, and young Englishman [[John Newton]] returns from the sea ("Prologue"). His childhood friend, Mary Catlett, an aspiring singer, is angry that John abandoned his musical education to seek adventure at sea. John’s father, Captain Newton, a wealthy slave-trader arrives; he is angry that his son has rejected his plans for him ("Truly Alive"). John and his friend Haweis begin the day's auction without the Captain. The cargo is African slaves ("The Auction"). A commotion ensues when the slave is freed by a group of hooded abolitionists; Mary gives up her cloak to conceal the young woman and aid her escape. John is humiliated and is tasked by Major Gray to find and retrieve the slave. John argues with Mary; he still suffers from the loss of his dear mother at age eight. Mary encourages John's better nature, singing a song he wrote for her years ago ("Someone Who Hears"). Mary is secretly invited to join an abolitionist group. She talks with her black maidservant, Nanna, about how Nanna became a slave and lost her daughter ("Yema's Song"). Mary's mother encourages her to pursue a relationship with the handsome and aristocratic Major Gray, who is interested in Mary. Mary, John and Gray all attend a Christmas ball where Mary performs a song that John wrote ("Voices of the Angels"). John drinks too much and offends everyone, including his father and Mary. Redcoat soldiers drag in two badly beaten abolitionists and the pregnant slave, also beaten. Major Gray scornfully points out that his soldiers, rather than John and his civil authorities, retrieved the slave. Gray leaves with Mary.

The next day, Mary meets with the abolitionists; they relate plans to undermine the slave trade ("We Are Determined"). She agrees to begin a relationship with Major Gray to act as their spy. Meanwhile, John is [[press-gang]]ed into the Navy aboard the H.M.S. Harwich; When his father refuses to help him, and John breaks all ties with him ("Never"). Thomas, the Newton’s house slave, attempts to intercede on John's behalf, and Captain Newton sends him on the ship as well. Mary struggles with her feelings for John ("Shadows of Innocence"). At her home, Major Gray proposes to Mary. As a cousin of [[George II of Great Britain|George II]], he must introduce Mary to the King to obtain royal consent to the marriage ("Expectations"). John's carelessness allows a French warship to defeat the Harwich, whose crew is killed.  John falls into the sea, and Thomas dives in to save his master ("Battle at Sea").

;Act II
John and Thomas are captured In Sierra Leone, by African warriors and their Princess Peyai, a ruthless slave trader, who threatens to kill John. John defies her ("Welcome Song") and is chained to a post and saved from starvation by a young slave girl, Yema. Meanwhile, Mary performs with the town choir ("Sing on High") and learns from Captain Newton that the Harwich has been lost ("Tell Me Why"). Peyai sends a letter to Captain Newton demanding ransom. Captain Newton prepares to sail to Sierra Leone ("A Chance for Me"), and Mary asks him to give John a letter. John uses his knowledge of the slave business to help Peyai to break up African families and assign slaves to ships. The Princess tests John's loyalty, pressuring him to sell Thomas as a slave bound for Barbados. As he is chained, Thomas confronts John about his choices ("Nowhere Left to Run"). Back in England, Major Gray learns that Mary plans to speak against slavery in front of [[Frederick, Prince of Wales|Prince Frederick]] at the Christmas concert at court, where she has been asked to perform. He imprisons Nanna and threatens to harm her if Mary does anything foolish, but Nanna tells Mary to speak regardless of the Consequences ("Daybreak"). Captain Newton reaches Africa to pay the ransom for John, but a gunfight erupts; Peyai is killed, while Captain Newton is gravely wounded and soon dies aboard ship. 

John assumes the role of Captain and finds Mary's letter inside his father's coat ("I Still Believe"). That night, John survives a fierce storm, remaining all night alone on deck, confronted by visions of the many lives he has destroyed ("Testimony"). He has an epiphany and turns the ship towards Barbados. He eventually finds and frees Thomas (whose African name is Pakuteh). John tells Pakuteh that he will spend his life working against the slave trade. Pakuteh is reluctant to forgive John ("I Will Remember") but relents and goes with him to England. John arrives home; Mary delivers an impassioned plea to Prince Frederick to end the barbarity of slavery. John bolsters her argument, vowing to undo his former evil. The Prince humiliates and demotes Gray. John and Mary reunite ("Nothing There to Love"). Pakuteh (Thomas), now a free man, recounts that John and Mary wed, and John went on to write hundreds of hymns ("Amazing Grace").&lt;ref name=CastAlbum/&gt;

{{Paris Peace Conference sidebox|expanded=Treaty of Versailles}}

'''Article 231''', often known as the '''War Guilt Clause''', was the opening article of the reparations section of the [[Treaty of Versailles]], which ended the [[World War I|First World War]] between the [[German Empire]] and [[Allies of World War I|the Allied and Associated Powers]]. The article did not use the word "guilt" but it served as a legal basis to compel Germany to pay reparations for the war.

Article 231 was one of the most controversial points of the treaty. It specified: 
:"The Allied and Associated Governments affirm and Germany accepts the responsibility of Germany and her allies for causing all the loss and damage to which the Allied and Associated Governments and their nationals have been subjected as a consequence of the war imposed upon them by the aggression of Germany and her allies."

Germans viewed this clause as a national humiliation, forcing Germany to accept full responsibility for causing the war. German politicians were vocal in their opposition to the article in an attempt to generate international sympathy, while German historians worked to undermine the article with the objective of subverting the entire treaty. The Allied leaders were surprised at the German reaction; they saw the article only as a necessary legal basis to extract compensation from Germany. The article, with the signatory's name changed, was also included in the treaties signed by [[Central Powers|Germany's allies]] who did not view the clause with the same disdain as the Germans did. [[United States|American]] diplomat [[John Foster Dulles]]&amp;mdash;one of the two authors of the article&amp;mdash;later regretted the wording used, believing it further aggravated the German people.

The historical consensus is that responsibility or guilt for the war was not attached to the article. Rather, the clause was a prerequisite to allow a legal basis to be laid out for the reparation payments that were to be made. Historians have also highlighted the unintended damage created by the clause, which caused anger and resentment amongst the German population.

On 28 June 1914 the [[Serbs of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnian-Serb]] [[Gavrilo Princip]] [[Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|assassinated]] the heir to the throne of [[Austria-Hungary]], [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Archduke Franz Ferdinand]], in the name of [[Serbian nationalism]].{{sfn|Tucker|Roberts|2005|pp=xxv and 9}} This caused a [[July Crisis|diplomatic crisis]], resulting in Austria-Hungary declaring war on [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]] and sparking the [[World War I|First World War]].{{sfn|Tucker|Roberts|2005|p=1078}} Due to [[Causes of World War I|a variety of reasons]], within weeks the major powers of Europe&amp;mdash;divided into two alliances known as the [[Central Powers]] and the [[Triple Entente]]&amp;mdash;went to war. As the conflict progressed, [[Participants in World War I|additional countries]] from around the globe became drawn into the conflict on both sides.{{sfn|Tucker|Roberts|2005|pp=11-13}}

Fighting would rage across [[European theatre of World War I|Europe]], the [[Middle Eastern theatre of World War I|Middle East]], [[African theatre of World War I|Africa]] and [[Asian and Pacific theatre of World War I|Asia]] for the next four years.{{sfn|Simkins|Jukes|Hickey|2003|p=9}} On 8 January 1918, [[President of the United States|United States President]] [[Woodrow Wilson]] issued a statement that became known as the [[Fourteen Points]]. In part, this speech called for the Central Powers to withdraw from the territories they had occupied, for the creation of a [[Second Polish Republic|Polish state]], the redrawing of Europe's borders along ethnic ("national") lines, and the formation of a [[League of Nations]].{{sfn|Tucker|Roberts|2005|p=429}}&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Fourteen Points Speech|Fourteen Points Speech]]&lt;/ref&gt; During the northern-hemisphere autumn of 1918, the Central Powers began to collapse.{{sfn|Beller|2007|pp=182–95}} The German military suffered a [[Hundred Days Offensive|decisive defeat]] on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]], while on the [[Home Front]] the [[Imperial German Navy]] [[Kiel mutiny|mutinied]], prompting uprisings in Germany which became known as the [[German Revolution of 1918–19|German Revolution]].{{sfn|Simkins|2002|p=71}}{{sfn|Tucker|Roberts|2005|p=638}}{{sfn|Schmitt|1960|p=101}} The German government attempted to obtain a peace settlement based on the Fourteen Points, and maintained it was on this basis that Germany surrendered.

On 18 January 1919 the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] began.{{sfn|Slavicek|2010|p=37}} The conference aimed to establish peace between the war's belligerents and to establish the post-war world.{{cn|date=February 2017}} The [[Treaty of Versailles]] resulting from the conference dealt solely with Germany.{{sfn|Osmańczyk|2003|p=1898}} This treaty, along with the others that were signed during the conference, each took their name from the [[Versailles (city)|suburb of Paris]] where the signings took place.{{sfn|Schmitt|1960|p=103}} While 70 delegates from 26 nations participated in the Paris negotiations, representatives from Germany were barred from attending, nominally over fears that a German delegation would attempt to play one country off against the other and unfairly influence the proceedings.{{sfn|Schmitt|1960|p=103}}{{sfn|Phillips|2007|p=152}}

==Writing of the article==
[[File:Norman H. Davis.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A black and white photo of an elderly white man looking directly at the camera.|[[Norman Davis (diplomat)|Norman Davis]], one of the two authors of Article 231]]

The Americans, British and French all differed on the issue of reparations settlement. The Western Front had been fought in France, and that countryside had been [[Zone rouge|heavily scarred]] in the fighting. France's most industrialized region in the north-east had been laid to waste during the German retreat. Hundreds of mines and factories were destroyed along with railroads, bridges and villages. [[Georges Clemenceau]], the [[Prime Minister of France]], thought it appropriate that any just peace required Germany to pay reparations for the damage they had caused. He also saw reparations as a means to ensure that Germany could not again threaten France and as well to weaken the German ability to compete with France's industrialization.{{sfn|Slavicek|2010|pp=41–3 and 58}} Reparations would also go towards the reconstruction costs in other countries, such as Belgium, also directly affected by the war.{{sfn|Weinberg|1994|p=14}} [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[David Lloyd George]] opposed harsh reparations in favour of a less crippling reparations settlement so that the German economy could remain a viable economic power and British trading partner. He furthermore argued that reparations should include war pensions for disabled veterans and allowances to be paid to war widows, which would reserve a larger share of the reparations for the [[British Empire]].{{sfn|Slavicek|2010|p=44}}{{sfn|Brezina|2006|p=21}}{{sfn|Yearwood|2009|p=127}} Wilson opposed these positions, and was adamant that there be no indemnity imposed upon Germany.{{sfn|Martel|2010|p=272}}

During the peace conference the [[Commission of Responsibilities|Commission on the Responsibility of the Authors of the War and on Enforcement of Penalties]]{{efn|The commission was composed of 16 members from ten countries.{{sfn|United States Department of State|1919|pp=204–5}} All were trained [[legal profession]]als.{{sfn|Lewis|2014|p=42}} They were:&lt;br&gt;

The Commission reasoned that the "war was premeditated by the Central Powers&amp;nbsp;... and was the result of acts deliberately committed [by them] to make it unavoidable", concluding that Germany and Austria-Hungary had "deliberately worked to defeat all the many conciliatory proposals made by the Entente Powers and their repeated efforts to avoid war." This conclusion was duly incorporated into the Treaty of Versailles,{{sfn|Neff|2005|p=289}} led by Clemenceau and Lloyd George who were both insistent on the inclusion of an unequivocal statement of Germany's total liability.{{sfn|Steiner|2005|p=59}} This left Wilson at odds with the other leaders of the conference. Instead, he proposed a repetition of a note sent by [[United States Secretary of State]] [[Robert Lansing]] to the German Government on 5 November 1918, stating that the "Allied Governments&amp;nbsp;... understand that compensation will be made by Germany for all damage done to the civilian population of the Allies and their property by the aggression of Germany&amp;nbsp;..."{{sfn|Martel|2010|p=272}}{{sfn|Steiner|2005|p=59}}

The actual wording of the article was chosen by [[United States|American]] diplomats [[Norman Davis (diplomat)|Norman Davis]] and [[John Foster Dulles]].{{sfn|Immerman|1998|pp=8–10}} Davis and Dulles produced a compromise between the Anglo-French and American positions, wording Article 231 and 232 to reflect that Germany "should, morally, pay for all war costs, but, because it could not possibly afford this, would be asked only to pay for civilian damages."{{sfn|Martel|2010|p=272}} Article 231, in which Germany accepted the responsibility of Germany and its allies for the damages resulting from the First World War, therefore served as a legal basis for the articles following it within the reparations chapter, obliging Germany to pay compensation limited to civilian damages.{{sfn|Marks|1978|pp=231–232}} Similar clauses, with slight modification in wording, were present in the peace treaties signed by the other members of the Central Powers.{{efn|Article 117 of the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye: "...&amp;nbsp;Austria accepts the responsibility of Austria and her Allies for causing the loss and damage to which the Allied and Associated Governments and their nationals have been subjected as a consequence of the war imposed upon them by the aggression of Austria-Hungary and her Allies".&lt;ref&gt;[[s: Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye/Part VIII#Article 177|Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye, Article 177]]&lt;/ref&gt; Article 161 of the Treaty of Trianon: "The Allied and Associated Governments affirm and Hungary accepts the responsibility of Hungary and her allies for causing the loss and damage to which the Allied and Associated Governments and their nationals have been subjected as a consequence of the war imposed upon them by the aggression of Austria-Hungary and her allies."&lt;ref&gt;[[s: Treaty of Trianon/Part VIII#Article 161|Treaty of Trianon, Article 161]]&lt;/ref&gt; Article 121 of the Treaty of Neuilly-sur-Seine: "Bulgaria recognises that, by joining in the war of aggression which Germany and Austria-Hungary waged against the Allied and Associated Powers, she has caused to the latter losses and sacrifices of all kinds, for which she ought to make complete reparation".&lt;ref&gt;[[s: Treaty of Neuilly/Part VII|Treaty of Neuilly-sur-Seine, Article 121]]&lt;/ref&gt; Article 231 of the Treaty of Sevres: "Turkey recognises that by joining in the war of aggression which Germany and Austria-Hungary waged against the Allied Powers she has caused to the latter losses and sacrifices of all kinds for which she ought to make complete reparation."&lt;ref&gt;[[s: Treaty of Sèvres/Part VIII|Treaty of Sèvres, Article 231]]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===German interpretation===
[[File:Ulrich Graf von Brockdorff-Rantzau.jpg|thumb|Count Ulrich von Brockdorff-Rantzau|alt=A man, smoking, poses for a portrait photograph.]]

[[Minister for Foreign Affairs (Germany)|Foreign Minister]] [[Ulrich von Brockdorff-Rantzau|Count Ulrich von Brockdorff-Rantzau]] headed the 180-strong German peace delegation. They departed [[Berlin]] on 18 April 1919, anticipating that the peace talks would soon start and that they and the Allied Powers would negotiate a settlement. Earlier, in February of that year, Brockdorff-Rantzau had informed the [[Weimar National Assembly]] that Germany would have to pay reparations for the devastation caused by the war, but would not pay for actual war costs.{{sfn|Young|2006|pp=133-135}} The German government had also taken the position that it would be "inadvisable&amp;nbsp;... to elevate the question of war guilt".{{sfn|Boemeke|Feldman|Glaser|1998|pp=537–538}} On 5 May, Brockdorff-Rantzau was informed that there would be no negotiations. Once the German delegation received the conditions of peace they would have fifteen days to reply. Following the drafting of the treaty, on 7 May the German and Allied delegations met and the Treaty of Versailles was handed off to be translated and for a response to be issued. At this meeting Brockdorff-Rantzau stated that "We know the intensity of the hatred which meets us, and we have heard the victors' passionate demand that as the vanquished we shall be made to pay, and as the guilty we shall be punished". However, he proceeded to deny that Germany was solely responsible for the war. Following the meeting, the German delegation retired to translate the 80,000 word document. As soon as the delegation realized the terms of peace, they agreed that they could not accept it without revision. They then proceeded to send their Allied counterparts, message after message attacking each part of the treaty.{{sfn|Young|2006|pp=135-136}} On 18 June, having disregarded the repeated explicit decisions of the government, Brockdorff-Rantzau declared that Article 231 would have Germany accept full responsibility for the war by force.{{sfn|Boemeke|Feldman|Glaser|1998|pp=537–538}}{{sfn|Binkley|Mahr|1926|p=399}}{{sfn|Craig|Gilbert|1994|p=141}} [[Max Weber]], an advisor with the German delegation, agreed with Brockdorff-Rantzau, also challenging the Allies over the issue of war guilt. He preferred to reject the treaty than submit to what he called a "rotten peace".{{sfn|Morrow|2005|p=290}}

On 16 June, the Allied Powers demanded that Germany unconditionally sign the treaty within seven days or face the resumption of hostilities. The [[Scheidemann cabinet|German government]] was divided on whether to sign or reject the peace treaty. On 19 June, [[Chancellor of Germany|Chancellor]] [[Philipp Scheidemann]] resigned rather than sign the treaty and was followed by Brockdorff-Rantzau and other members of the government, leaving Germany without a cabinet or peace delegation. After being advised by [[Field marshal (Germany)|Field Marshal]] [[Paul von Hindenburg]] that Germany was in no condition to resume the war, [[President of Germany|President]] [[Friedrich Ebert]] and the new Chancellor, [[Gustav Bauer]], recommended that the Weimar National Assembly ratify the treaty. The Assembly did so by a large majority, and Clemenceau was informed nineteen minutes before the deadline expired. Germany unconditionally signed the peace treaty on 22 June.{{sfn|Shirer|1990|p=59}}{{sfn|Young|2006|pp=136-137}}

Initially, Article 231 was not correctly translated. Rather than stating "...&amp;nbsp;Germany accepts responsibility of Germany and her allies causing all the loss and damage&amp;nbsp;...", the German Government's edition read "Germany admits it, that Germany and her allies, as authors of the war, are responsible for all losses and damages&amp;nbsp;...".{{sfn|Binkley|Mahr|1926|pp=399-400}} Germans felt that they the country had signed away her honor, and there was a prevailing belief of humiliation as the article was seen, overall, as an injustice.{{sfn|Morrow|2005|p=290}}{{sfn|Binkley|Mahr|1926|p=400}} Historian [[Wolfgang Mommsen]] commented that despite the public outrage, German government officials were aware "that Germany's position on this matter was not nearly so favorable as the imperial government had led the German public to believe during the war."{{sfn|Boemeke|Feldman|Glaser|1998|pp=537–538}}

===Allied opinion on article===
The Allied delegation initially thought Article 231 to be a mundane addition to the treaty intended to limit German liability with regard to reparations, and were surprised at the vehemence of the German protests.{{sfn|MacMillan|Holbrooke|2003|p=193}} Georges Clemenceau rebuffed Brockdorff-Rantzau's allegations, arguing that "the legal interpretation [of the article] was the correct one" and not a matter of political question.{{sfn|Binkley|Mahr|1926|p=399}} Lloyd George commented that "the English public, like the French public, thinks the Germans must above all acknowledge their obligation to compensate us for all the consequences of their aggression. When this is done we come to the question of Germany's capacity to pay; we all think she will be unable to pay more than this document requires of her."{{sfn|MacMillan|Holbrooke|2003|p=193}}

Prior to the [[American entry into World War I|American entry into the war]], Woodrow Wilson called for a "peace of reconciliation with Germany", what he dubbed a "peace without victory". His wartime speeches, however, rejected these earlier notions and he took an increasingly belligerent stance towards Germany.{{sfn|Trachtenberg|1982|pp=490–491}} Following the war, on 4 September 1919, during his public campaign to rally American support for the Treaty of Versailles, Wilson commented that the treaty "seeks to punish one of the greatest wrongs ever done in history, the wrong which Germany sought to do to the world and to civilization, and there ought to be no weak purpose with regard to the application of the punishment. She attempted an intolerable thing, and she must be made to pay for the attempt."{{sfn|Trachtenberg|1982|p=491}} Regardless of the rhetoric, the American position was to create a balanced treaty that would appease everyone. Gordon Auchincloss, secretary to [[Edward M. House]] (one of Wilson's advisers), sent a copy of the clause to the State Department and stated "you will note that the President's principles have been protected in this clause".{{sfn|Boemeke|Feldman|Glaser|1998|p=500}}

Historian William Keylor commented that initially both United States diplomats believed that they had "devised a brilliant solution to the reparation dilemma"; appeasing both the British and French, as well as Allied public opinion irrespective of the fact that Allied leaders were aware of concerns surrounding German willingness to pay reparations and the disappointment that could follow.{{sfn|Boemeke|Feldman|Glaser|1998|p=500}} [[Vance C. McCormick]] (an economic adviser of Wilson) emphasized this point, and stated: "...the preamble is useful. We are adopting an unusual method in not fixing a definite sum. The preamble tends to explain this, and further, prepares the public mind for disappointment as to what actually can be secured."{{sfn|Boemeke|Feldman|Glaser|1998|pp=500-501}} In 1940, Dulles stated that he was surprised that the article "could plausibly be, and in fact was, considered to be a historical judgement of war guilt". He further noted that the "profound significance of this article&amp;nbsp;... came about through accident, rather than design".{{sfn|Boemeke|Feldman|Glaser|1998|p=501}} Dulles took it personally that the Treaty of Versailles failed in its intentions of creating a lasting peace and believed that the treaty was one of the [[Causes of World War II|causes]] of the [[World War II|Second World War]]. By 1954, as United States Secretary of State and in discussion with the [[Soviet Union]] in regards to [[German reunification]], he commented that "Efforts to bankrupt and humiliate a nation merely incite a people of vigor and of courage to break the bonds imposed upon them.&amp;nbsp;... Prohibitions thus incite the very acts that are prohibited."{{sfn|Immerman|1998|p=10}}

Compensation demanded from the defeated party was a common feature of peace treaties.{{sfn|Bell|1986|p=22}} The financial burden of the Treaty of Versailles was labelled "reparations", which distinguished them from [[Punitive damages|punitive settlements]] usually known as [[Indemnity|indemnities]]. The reparations were intended for reconstruction and as compensation for families who had been bereaved by the war.{{sfn|Weinberg|1994|p=14}} Sally Marks wrote that the article "was designed to lay a legal basis for reparations" to be paid. Article 231 "established an unlimited theoretical liability" for which Germany would have to pay but the following article "in fact narrowed German responsibility to civilian damages".{{sfn|Marks|1978|pp=231–232}}{{efn|"The Allied and Associated Governments recognise that the resources of Germany are not adequate&amp;nbsp;... to make complete reparation for all such loss and damage.&lt;br /&gt; The Allied and Associated Governments, however, require, and Germany undertakes, that she will make compensation for all damage done to the civilian population of the Allied and Associated Powers and to their property during the period of the belligerency&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;ref&gt;[[s: Treaty of Versailles/Part VIII#Article 232|Treaty of Versailles, Article 232]]&lt;/ref&gt;}} When the final reparation figure was established in 1921, it was based on an Allied assessment of [the] German capacity to pay, not on the basis of Allied claims.{{sfn|Marks|1978|pp=231–232}}

The London Schedule of Payments, of 5 May 1921, established the full liability of the combined Central Powers at {{nowrap|132 billion}} [[German gold mark|gold marks]]. Of this figure, Germany was only required to pay {{nowrap|50 billion}} gold marks ({{nowrap|$12.5 billion}}), a smaller amount than they had previously offered for terms of peace.{{sfn|Marks|1978|p=237}} Reparations were unpopular and strained the German economy but they were payable and from 1919–1931, when reparations ended, Germany paid fewer than {{nowrap|21 billion}} gold marks.{{sfn|Bell|1986|p=38}} The [[Inter-Allied Reparations Commission|Reparation Commission]] and the [[Bank for International Settlements]] gave a total German payment of {{nowrap|20.598 billion}} gold marks, whereas historian [[Niall Ferguson]] estimated that Germany paid no more than {{nowrap|19 billion}} gold marks.{{sfn|Marks|1978|pp=233 and 237}}{{sfn|Boemeke|Feldman|Glaser|1998|p=424}} Ferguson also wrote that this sum was only 2.4 per cent of German national income between 1919 and 1932, while Stephen Schuker places the figure at an average of 2 per cent of national income between 1919 and 1931, in cash and kind, making a total transfer equal to 5.3 per cent of national income for the period.{{sfn|Boemeke|Feldman|Glaser|1998|p=424}}{{sfn|Martel|1999|p=43}} [[Gerhard Weinberg]] wrote that reparations were paid, towns were rebuilt, orchards replanted, mines reopened and pensions paid but the burden of repairs was shifted from the German economy to the damaged economies of the victors.{{sfn|Weinberg|1994|p=16}}

===Effects on German political opinion and revisionism===

Domestic German opposition to Article 231 has been held to have created a psychological and political burden on the post-war [[Weimar Republic]].{{sfn|Soumerai|Schulz|1998|p=17}}{{sfn|Bendersky|1984|p=10}} German politicians seeking international sympathy would use the article for its propaganda value, convincing many who had not read the treaties that the article implied full war guilt.{{sfn|Marks|1978|pp=231–232}} German revisionist historians who subsequently attempted to ignore the validity of the clause found a ready audience among 'revisionist' writers in France, Britain, and the United States.{{sfn|Bell|1986|p=21}} The objective of both the politicians and historians was to prove that Germany was not solely guilty for causing the war; if that guilt could be disproved the legal requirement to pay reparations would disappear.{{sfn|Albrecht-Carrié|1940|p=15}} To that end, the German government funded the [[Centre for the Study of the Causes of the War]]. This subject, the question of Germany's guilt (''Kriegsschuldfrage'' or war guilt question) became a major theme of [[Adolf Hitler]]'s political career.{{sfn|Thomsett|2007|p=13}} 

[[United States Senate|United States Senator]] [[Henrik Shipstead]] argued that the failure to revise the article became a factor in Hitler's [[Adolf Hitler's rise to power|rise to power]].{{sfn|Henig|1995|p=52}}{{sfn|Stuhler|1973|p=92}}, a view held by some historians, such as Tony Rea and John Wright, who wrote that "the harshness of the War Guilt Clause and the reparations demands made it easier for Hitler to gain power in Germany."{{sfn|Rea|Wright|1997|p=39}} Despite these views, the historical consensus is that the article and the treaty, did not cause the rise of Nazism but that an unconnected rise in extremism and the [[Great Depression]] led to the [[Nazi Party|NSDAP]] gaining greater electoral popularity and then being maneuvered into office.{{sfn|Slavicek|2010|p=94}}{{sfn|Evans|1989|p=107}} [[Fritz Klein (historian)|Fritz Klein]] wrote that while there was a path from Versailles to Hitler, the former did not make "Hitler's takeover of power inevitable" and that "the Germans had a choice when they decided to take this path. In other words, they did not have to. Hitler's victory was not an unavoidable result of Versailles."{{sfn|Boemeke|Feldman|Glaser|1998|p=220}}

==Historical assessment==
{{further|Historiography of the causes of World War I}}
[[File:Senator John Foster Dulles (R-NY).jpg|thumb|alt=A black and white photo of an elderly white man, looking to the front.|[[John Foster Dulles]], the second author of the article]]

In 1926, [[Robert C. Binkley]] and A. C. Mahr of [[Stanford University]], wrote that German accusations of the article assigning war guilt were "ill-founded" and "mistaken". The article was more "an assumption of liability to pay damages than an admission of war guilt" and compared it with "a man who undertakes to pay all the cost of a motor accident than to the plea of guilty entered by an accused criminal". They wrote that "it is absurd" to charge the reparation articles of the treaty with any "political meaning" and the legal interpretation "is the only one that can stand". They concluded that German opposition "is based upon a text which has no legal validity whatsoever, and which Germany never signed at all."{{sfn|Binkley|Mahr|1926|pp=398-400}} [[Sidney Bradshaw Fay|Sidney Fay]] was the "most outspoken and influential critic" of the article. In 1928, he concluded that all of Europe shared the blame for the war and that Germany had no intention of launching a general European war in 1914.{{sfn|Slavicek|2010|pp=19-20}}

In 1937, [[E. H. Carr]] commented that "in the passion of the moment" the Allied Powers had "failed to realize that this extorted admission of guilt could prove nothing, and must excite bitter resentment in German minds." He concluded "German men of learning set to work to demonstrate the guiltlessness of their country, fondly believing that, if this could be established, the whole fabric of the treaty would collapse."{{sfn|Welch|1995|p=271}} [[René Albrecht-Carrié]] wrote in May 1940, that "article 231 gave rise to an unfortunate controversy, unfortunate because it served to raise a false issue." He wrote that the German [[Interwar period|inter-war]] argument "rested on her responsibility for the out-break of the war" and if that guilt could be disproved then the legal requirement to pay reparations would disappear.{{sfn|Albrecht-Carrié|1940|p=15}}

In 1942, [[Luigi Albertini]] published ''The Origins of the War of 1914'' and concluded that Germany was primarily responsible for the outbreak of the war.{{sfn|Lafore|1997|p=21}}{{sfn|Mombauer|2002|pp=125 and 166}} Albertini's work, rather than spurring on new debate, was the culmination of the first research phase into the war guilt question.{{sfn|Stevenson|1996|p=410}} The issue came back between 1959 and 1969, when [[Fritz Fischer]] in ''[[Germany's Aims in the First World War]]'' and ''[[War of Illusions]]'' "destroyed the consensus about shared responsibility for the First World War" and "placed the blame&amp;nbsp;... firmly on the shoulders of the [[Wilhelmine]] elite." By the 1970s, his work "had emerged as the new orthodoxy on the origins of the First World War".{{sfn|Mulligan|2010|pp=11-12}} In the 1980s, [[James Joll]] led a new wave of First World War research concluding "that the origins of the First World War were "complex and varied" although "by December 1912" Germany had decided to go to  war.{{sfn|Mulligan|2010|p=14}}

In 1978, Marks re-examined the reparation clauses of the treaty and wrote that "the much-criticized 'war guilt clause', Article 231, which was designed to lay a legal basis for reparations, in fact makes no mention of war guilt" but only specified that Germany was to pay for the damages caused by the war they imposed upon the allies and "that Germany committed an act of aggression against Belgium is beyond dispute". "Technically, Britain entered" the war and French troops entered Belgium "to honor" the "legal obligation" to defend Belgium under the [[Treaty of London (1839)|1839 Treaty of London]] and that "Germany openly acknowledged her responsibility in regard to Belgium on August 4, 1914 and May 7, 1919." Marks also wrote that "the same clause, ''[[mutatis mutandis]]''" was incorporated "in the treaties with [[First Austrian Republic|Austria]] and [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920–46)|Hungary]], neither of whom interpreted it as declaration of war guilt."{{sfn|Marks|1978|pp=231–232}} [[Wolfgang Mommsen]] wrote that "Austria and Hungary, understandably paid no attention to this aspect of the draft treaty".{{sfn|Boemeke|Feldman|Glaser|1998|pp=537–538}}

In 1986, Marks wrote that the German foreign office, supported by military and civilian notables, "focused on Article 231&amp;nbsp;... hoping that, if one could refute German responsibility for the war, not only reparations but the entire treaty would collapse".{{sfn|Martel|1999|p=19}} Manfred Boemeke, [[Gerald Feldman]], and Elisabeth Glaser wrote that "pragmatic requirements characteristically influenced the shaping of the much misunderstood Article 231. That paragraph reflected the presumed legal necessity to define German responsibility for the war in order to specify and limit the Reich's obligations".{{sfn|Boemeke|Feldman|Glaser|1998|p=16}} P.M.H. Bell wrote that despite the article not using the term 'guilt', and while "it may be that its drafters did not intend to convey a moral judgement of Germany", the article has "almost universally" became known as the war guilt clause of the treaty.{{sfn|Bell|1986|p=21}} [[Margaret MacMillan]] wrote that the German public's interpretation of Article 231 as unequivocally ascribing the fault for the war to Germany and her allies, "came to be the object of particular loathing in Germany and the cause of uneasy consciences among the Allies." The Allies never expected such a hostile reaction, for "no one thought there would be any difficulty over the clauses themselves."{{sfn|MacMillan|Holbrooke|2003|p=193}}

Stephen Neff wrote that "the term 'war guilt' is a slightly unfortunate one, since to lawyers, the term 'guilt' primarily connotes criminal liability" while "the responsibility of Germany envisaged in the Versailles Treaty&amp;nbsp;... was civil in nature, comparable to the indemnity obligation of classical [[Just war theory|just-war theory]]."{{sfn|Neff|2005|p=289}} Louise Slavicek wrote that while "the article was an honest reflection of the treaty-writers' beliefs, including such a clause in the peace settlement was undiplomatic, to say the least."{{sfn|Slavicek|2010|p=57}} [[Diane Kunz]] wrote that "rather than being seen as an American lawyer's clever attempt to limit actual German financial responsibility by buying off French politicians and their public with the sop of a piece of paper" Article 231 "became an easily exploitable open sore".{{sfn|Boemeke|Feldman|Glaser|1998|p=524}} [[Ian Kershaw]] wrote that the "national disgrace" felt over the article and "defeat, revolution, and the establishment of democracy", had "fostered a climate in which a counter-revolutionary set of ideas could gain wide currency" and "enhanced the creation of a mood in which" extreme nationalist ideas could gain a wider audience and take hold.{{sfn|Kershaw|2000|pp=136-137}}

Elazar Barkan argues that by "forcing an admission of war guilt at Versailles, rather than healing, the victors instigated resentment that contributed to the rise of [[Fascism]]."{{sfn|Barkan|2000|p=xxiii}} [[Norman Davies]] wrote that the article invited Germany "to accept sole guilt for the preceding war".{{sfn|Davies|2007|p=133}} Klaus Schwabe wrote that the article's influence went far beyond the discussion of war guilt. By "refusing to acknowledge Germany's 'war guilt' the new German government implicitly exonerated the [[House of Hohenzollern|old monarchial order]]" and more importantly failed "to dissociate itself from the old regime." In doing so "it undermined its claim that post-revolutionary Germany was a historic new democratic beginning deserving credit at the peace conference."{{sfn|Boemeke|Feldman|Glaser|1998|p=48}}

The '''Australian International Airshow''', also called the '''Avalon Airshow''', is a large [[air show]] held biennially at [[Avalon Airport]], between [[Melbourne]] and [[Geelong]] in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]].

The event has a strong focus on military aviation, featuring aircraft from the [[Royal Australian Air Force]], [[United States Navy]] and the [[United States Air Force]]. Representatives from other air arms have also appeared at the airshow on many occasions, including aircraft from the [[Royal Air Force]], [[Japan Air Self-Defense Force]], [[Republic of Singapore Air Force]] and many others.

It has been said by air show organisers to be the largest air show in the [[southern hemisphere]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Airshow: Feel the Power|publisher=Airshow.net.au|url=http://www.airshow.net.au/avalon2011/airshow/index.html|accessdate=20 March 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110406105041/http://www.airshow.net.au/avalon2011/airshow/index.html|archive-date=6 April 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The airshow has periodically attracted [[Anti-war movement|anti-war protests]].&lt;ref name="green"&gt;[https://www.greenleft.org.au/content/airshow-anti-war-protest-takes Airshow anti-war protest takes off February 19, 2003] ''[[Green Left Weekly]]'' Retrieved March 6, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="attracts"&gt;McLennan, Rob [http://www.bay939.com.au/news/local-news/76968-peace-protest-targets-airshow Peace protest targets airshow March 1, 2017] ''93.9 Geelong'' Retrieved March 6, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Avalon Airshow 2007 wall of fire.jpg|250px|thumb|Inverted plane leaving a wall-of-fire in 2007]]
The first air display at Avalon was in 1957 when the head of the Port Melbourne [[Government Aircraft Factories]] Geoff J. Churcher [[Order of Australia|OAM]] decided to put on a display for the employees. As the employees at the factory only ever saw individual parts of aircraft it was decided to mount a flying display at Avalon so the employees could see the final result of their work.

=== 1988–1991: the first air shows ===
To celebrate the [[Australian Bicentenary]] in 1988, the first major airshow in Australia was held in Sydney at the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) [[RAAF Base Richmond|air base at Richmond]] in [[New South Wales]]. It was organised by members of the Schofields Flying Club, which had been running small-scale air shows at the small strip at [[RAAF Station Schofields|Schofields Airfield]]. The Bicentennial Airshow featured a vast array of international military types including the [[McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle|F-15 Eagle]], [[Panavia Tornado F3]], [[Sea Harrier]], the [[Royal New Zealand Air Force]] aerobatic team "Kiwi Red", [[Lockheed C-5 Galaxy]], [[BAE Systems Hawk]] and a flypast by a [[Boeing B-52 Stratofortress]] bomber.

In February 1991 a second air show was held at Richmond, to celebrate the RAAF's 80th Anniversary. This was the last air show run by the remnants of Schoe's, who provided the prime impetus to get the Aerospace Foundation of Australia up and running. The foundation was responsible for forming AirShows DownUnder.

With the success of those two New South Wales shows plans were laid for the Avalon airshow.

=== 1992 – Moving to Avalon ===
[[File:ARDU Dak A65-95.JPG|thumb|[[Douglas C-47 Skytrain|C-47 Dakota]] A65-95 of the [[Aircraft Research and Development Unit RAAF|ARDU]] in 1992]]
In 1992, the Australian International Airshow was moved to [[Avalon Airport]] near [[Geelong]]. Held during October, the show coincided with the wettest spring in Victoria's history.&lt;ref name="2011pm p.68"&gt;{{harvnb|Wilson|2011|p=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show organisers nearly cancelled it due to the wet, but the rain stopped just before the opening day. The two public days of the 1992 show were attended by about 175,000 people.&lt;ref name="2011pm p.68"/&gt; There were 226 exhibitors from 12 countries.&lt;ref name="2011pm p.68"/&gt; The move to Avalon in 1992 was hoped to be the first of many locations, however the weather caused financial difficulties that resulted in the air show remaining at Avalon for many years.

Besides the weather, further problems presented themselves, including the absence of the [[MiG-29]] and [[Sukhoi Su-27]] promised by the Russians.&lt;ref name="2011pm p.68"/&gt; However, other aircraft were present, notably the enormous [[Antonov An-124 Ruslan]] and [[Ilyushin Il-86]]. Also on display were [[warbird]]s, and the [[Airbus A340]], which had been in commercial service for only seven months. The show featured significant RAAF participation.&lt;ref name="2011pm p.68"/&gt;

=== 1995 ===
The 1995 show was the second edition to take place at Avalon. The date was moved from October to 21–26 March, taking advantage of finer weather during autumn.&lt;ref name="2011pm p.68"/&gt;

The show was largely stolen by the visiting Russian contingent of [[Anatoly Kvochur]], his specially modified Su-27P "Flanker" and [[Ilyushin Il-78]] "Midas" tanker aircraft.&lt;ref name="2011pm p.70"&gt;{{harvnb|Wilson|2011|p=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were supported by other Soviet/Russian aircraft such as the [[Ilyushin Il-76]]DMP, [[Ilyushin Il-96|Il-96]]M and the [[Tupolev Tu-204]].&lt;ref name="2011pm p.70"/&gt; Also present were the RAAF's [[General Dynamics F-111 Aardvark|General Dynamics F-111G]] "Aardvark", so were the [[BAE Systems Hawk]], [[Dassault Alpha Jet]], [[CASA/IPTN CN-235]], and the [[Kaman Seasprite]], which were running for [[Australian Defence Force]] orders.&lt;ref name="2011pm p.70"/&gt; [[Aerial refueling|Aerial in-flight refuelling]] was displayed as well as Kvochur's world-famous flying routine with the Flanker which involved the "[[Pugachev's Cobra|Cobra]]", [[knife-edge flight|knife-edge]] and extremely low level passes. The final display on the Sunday show saw the Flanker cruise down the Avalon runway at approximately {{Convert|15|ft|m}} [[above ground level]]. The RAAF and USAF were reluctant to compete with the Flanker and so there was no solo [[McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet|F/A-18 Hornet]] aerobatic display. The USAF flew the [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon]] with external drop tanks fitted which they said limited the aircraft to a "3g max" display. Kvochur won the award for best flying display this year.

=== 1997===
The 1997 Avalon air show was held between 18 and 23 February. In contrast to the 1992 show, which was the wettest spring in Victorian history, 1997 took place during the hottest February ever.&lt;ref name="2011pm p.70"/&gt; Attendance was 171,168 and a $63 million contribution to the Victorian economy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tourismvictoria.com.au/index.php?option=displaypage&amp;Itemid=232&amp;op=page&amp;SubMenu= Australian International Airshow and Aerospace Expo 1997]&lt;/ref&gt;

Aircraft present were the USAF F-16 Fighting Falcon, [[Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker|KC-135 Stratotanker]] and C-17 Globemaster III, a Canadian [[CP-140 Aurora]], a [[United States Marine Corps]] [[Super Cobra]], a special [[Airbus A320 family|Airbus A320]] in [[2000 Summer Olympics|Sydney Olympics]] livery, and two [[Canadair CL-215]] Scoopers.&lt;ref name="2011pm p.71"&gt;{{harvnb|Wilson|2011|p=71}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most notable aircraft was a [[Lockheed Constellation|Super Constellation]] restored by HARS in the US.&lt;ref name="2011pm p.71"/&gt; Another display was by the F-111 with its "dump and burn" during the Night Alight on Friday evening.&lt;ref name="2011pm p.71"/&gt;

===1999===

There were 472 exhibitors from 26 countries in 1999. It was opened by the-then Victorian Premier [[Jeff Kennett]] on 16 February 1999.&lt;ref&gt;[http://yoyo.its.monash.edu.au/~buddy/airshows/aust_int/99/ Airshow 99]&lt;/ref&gt; The USAF again had a heavy presence, contributing two F-16Cs, a KC-135R tanker, a C-5 Galaxy, and a B-52.&lt;ref name="2011pm p.71"/&gt; The latter was parked at the end of the runway, ready to take off at a moment's notice for deployment in Iraq.&lt;ref name="2011pm p.71"/&gt; The RAAF displayed its new [[Lockheed Martin C-130J Super Hercules|Lockheed Martin C-130J-30 Super Hercules]], even though it was yet to enter service.&lt;ref name="2011pm p.71"/&gt; [[Eurofighter]] sent a mock-up of its [[Eurofighter Typhoon|Typhoon]], promoting the aircraft as prospective replacement for the RAAF's F/A-18 Hornet.&lt;ref name="2011pm p.72"/&gt; Business jets, warbirds and historic aircraft were featured heavily, among which were five [[North American P-51 Mustang]]s.&lt;ref name="2011pm p.72"/&gt;

Novelty acts included wing-walking as part of the performances under the name "Stars of Oshkosh". [[Bob Hoover]] returned to perform in his [[Aero Commander]].&lt;ref name="2011pm p.72"/&gt;

=== 2001 ===
[[File:Boeing Apache attack helicopter at the 2001 Avalon Airshow.jpg|thumb|[[AH-64 Apache]] of the [[United States Army|US Army]] in 2001]]
It was held on 11–17 February 2001, which celebrated Australia's 100 years of federation and 80 years of the Royal Australian Air Force. About 100 [[United States Air Force]] pilots took part in the air show in 2001. Planes included were a B-1 Lancer, two F-15 Eagles, two F-16 Fighting Falcons, a B-52 Stratofortress, a C-17 Globemaster III, a [[Hawker Siddeley Nimrod]], two [[Panavia Tornado|Tornado GR.1]]s, a [[Vickers VC10]] tanker, two RAF Hercules, and a [[Eurocopter Tiger]], among others.&lt;ref name="2011pm p.72"/&gt; The [[Bombardier CRJ700]], [[Bombardier Dash 8|Dash-8]] (Q400) and [[Learjet 45]] made their AIA debut, accompanied by a [[Cessna CitationJet|Cessna CJ2]], [[Dassault Falcon 900]]EX and [[Cirrus SR20]].&lt;ref name="2011pm p.72"/&gt;

This edition saw the last public display of the RAAF's [[Aermacchi MB-326]] [[jet trainer]] before retirement.&lt;ref name="2011pm p.72"/&gt;

=== 2003 ===
[[File:Mitsubishi-zero-replica-l.jpg|thumb|A [[Mitsubishi Zero]] replica in 2003]]
In 2003, the official theme was "''Celebrating the Centenary of Powered Flight''", commemorating the first powered flight by the [[Wright brothers]] on 17 December 1903 at [[Kitty Hawk, North Carolina|Kitty Hawk]], North Carolina.&lt;ref name="2011pm p.72"&gt;{{harvnb|Wilson|2011|p=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were 440 exhibitors from 30 countries. There were more than six hundred aircraft on the field. It included replicas from the early 20th century, such as a 1910 [[Hanriot]] replica and 1911 [[Curtiss Model D]] [[Pusher configuration|Pusher]] replica. There were also [[Tiger Moth]]s, [[Sopwith Pup]], [[Bleriot XI]] and a scale version of a [[Wright Flyer II]] and other similar aircraft. For jets it had a [[English Electric Canberra|Canberra]], [[MiG-15]]{{Failed verification|date=March 2011}}, [[Hawker Hunter]], [[Gloster Meteor]] and [[De Havilland Vampire|Vampire]]{{Failed verification|date=March 2011}}.&lt;ref name="2011pm p.72"/&gt; A [[NHIndustries NH90|NH90]] arrived in an [[Airbus Beluga]], which was an attraction in itself.&lt;ref name="2011pm p.72"/&gt;

A Chinese military delegation was given a tour of the air show. The 2003 edition took place in the lead-up to the [[Iraq War]] which began the following month and appearances by a number of American aircraft scheduled to join in the show such as the [[Lockheed F-117 Nighthawk]] were cancelled, due to possible anti-war protests. There was a model of an [[F-35 Lightning II]], made of wood and [[fibreglass]]. An anti-war protest did take place outside, and [[Gavan O'Connor]], the local parliament member boycotted the airshow.&lt;ref name="green"/&gt;

=== 2005 ===
[[File:C-17 Globemaster III at Avalon 2005 1.jpg|thumb|[[C-17 Globemaster III]] of the [[United States Air Force|US Air Force]] in 2005]]
The theme of the 2005 show, held from 15 to 20 March, was "''The Shape of Things to Come''". This edition experienced increased business activity, as there were more than 500 exhibitors from 22 countries and 11 major conferences.&lt;ref name="2011pm p.74"/&gt; The air show increased Geelong's economy by $15.6 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release|url=http://www.dpc.vic.gov.au/domino/Web_Notes/newmedia.nsf/0/628bbf669b194901ca2570850002489b?OpenDocument |title=Brumby Announces Grant For Avalon Airport Upgrade |publisher=Vic.gov.au |date=22 September 2005 |accessdate=20 March 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081002061220/http://www.dpc.vic.gov.au/domino/Web_Notes/newmedia.nsf/0/628bbf669b194901ca2570850002489b?OpenDocument |archivedate=2 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Large corporate jets were prominent during the trade show, with the [[Airbus A319CJ]], [[Embraer Lineage 1000]] and [[Gulfstream 650]] all making their debut at an Australian International Airshow.

'''Boddinale''' is an international Film Festival for Berlin-based directors that takes place every year starting on the second Thursday of February.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Berlin|first1=Official Website|title=Boddinale Filmfestival|url=http://www.berlin.de/kultur-und-tickets/tipps/film/festivals/2930878-2020379-boddinale-filmfestival.html|website=berlin.de|publisher=Berlin|accessdate=20 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Festival is eleven days long, with the last day dedicated to an awards ceremony and re-screening of the winning films. Defined as a community festival,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=d|first1=d|title=Von der Community für Neukölln|url=http://berliner-filmfestivals.de/2013/02/interview-zur-ersten-boddinale-2013|website=berliner-filmfestivals.de|accessdate=20 May 2016|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boddinale has no admission fees and take place in three art bars with several screens presenting the program simultaneously in Boddinstrasse, a street in Neukolln, [[Berlin]], [[Germany]].

Since its first edition in 2013 Boddinale has been defined by local media as "the unofficial little sister of the Berlinale"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Flux|first1=FM|title=Patrick Richardt, die Boddinale &amp; eine 7"-Ausstellung|url=http://archiv.fluxfm.de/feature/patrick-richardt-die-boddinale-eine-7-ausstellung/|website=Flux FM|accessdate=20 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "the other Berlinale", in reference to the [[Berlin International Film Festival]].&lt;ref name=MEWES2016&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mewes|first1=Sarah|title=The Other Berlinale|url=https://global.handelsblatt.com/edition/117/ressort/european-lifestyles/article/the-other-berlinale|website=handelsblatt.com|publisher=Handelsblatt|accessdate=20 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Festival was established by the art director Gianluca Baccanico as part of the program of Loophole ArtSpace, a venue for independent artists where the Festival still has its main location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Krone|first1=Tobias|title=Filme aus Boddiwood|url=http://www.taz.de/1/archiv/digitaz/artikel/?ressort=ku&amp;dig=2015%2F02%2F05%2Fa0221|website=taz.de|accessdate=21 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Awards ==

Boddinale presents works from artists that are living in Berlin in five different categories: Feature, Documentary, Short, Animation, Music Video. All the directors are present for a question and answer session after their screening.&lt;ref name=MEWES2016 /&gt;

A permanent jury board selects a winner for each category that is announced on the last Sunday of the Festival, after the ceremony the awarded movies are screened for a second time to close the Festival. Since the first edition the Winners are hosted for a night in April at [[:de:Moviemento|Moviemento]], the oldest active cinema in Germany.

== Jury ==

The Jury of Boddinale is permanent and is composed of Tom Lass, [[Michael Lederer]], Sven Loose, Carla Molino, [[Magnus Reed]], Franziska Rummel, and [[María Sólrún Sigurðardóttir|Maria Solrun]].

The '''boiling frog''' is a [[fable]] describing a [[frog]] being slowly [[death by boiling|boiled alive]]. The premise is that if a frog is put suddenly into boiling water, it will jump out, but if the frog is put in tepid water which is then brought to a boil slowly, it will not perceive the danger and will be cooked to death. The story is often used as a [[metaphor]] for the inability or unwillingness of people to react to or be aware of sinister threats that arise gradually rather than suddenly.

While some 19th-century experiments suggested that the underlying premise is true if the heating is sufficiently gradual,&lt;ref name="Offerman 2010"&gt;{{Cite web | last = Offerman

}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sedgwick1888"&gt;{{Harvnb|Sedgwick|1888|p=399}}&lt;/ref&gt; according to contemporary biologists the premise is false: a frog that is gradually heated will jump out.&lt;ref name="fastcompany"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fastcompany.com/26455/next-time-what-say-we-boil-consultant|title=Next Time, What Say We Boil a Consultant|last=|first=|date=October 1995|work=Fast Company Issue 01|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2017-08-01|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ecoviews"&gt;[http://archive-srel.uga.edu/outreach/ecoviews/ecoview071223.htm "The legend of the boiling frog is just a legend"] by Whit Gibbons, ''Ecoviews'', November 18, 2002, retrieved November 24, 2015, no longer available&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, [[thermoregulation]] by changing location is a fundamentally necessary survival strategy for frogs and other [[ectotherm]]s.

==Experiments and analysis==

As part of advancing science, several experiments observing the reaction of frogs to slowly heated water took place in the 19th century. In 1869, while doing experiments searching for the location of the soul, German physiologist [[Friedrich Goltz]] demonstrated that a frog that has had its [[brain]] removed will remain in slowly heated water, but an intact frog attempted to escape the water when it reached 25&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name="Offerman 2010"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://jamesfallows.theatlantic.com/archives/2009/07/guest-post_wisdom_on_frogs.php|title=Guest-post wisdom on frogs|author=[[James Fallows]]|work=[[The Atlantic]]|date=21 July 2009|accessdate=2009-07-22|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other 19th century experiments were purported to show that frogs did not attempt to escape gradually heated water. An 1872 experiment by Heinzmann was said to show that a normal frog would not attempt to escape if the water was heated slowly enough,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sedgwick|1888|p=390}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/BF01612252|title=Ueber die Wirkung sehr allmäliger Aenderungen thermischer Reize auf die Empfindungsnerven|journal=Pflüger, Archiv für die Gesammte Physiologie des Menschen und der Thiere|volume=6|pages=222|year=1872|last1=Heinzmann|first1=A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was corroborated in 1875 by Fratscher.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sedgwick|1888|p=394}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1888, Sedgwick said the apparent contradiction between the results of these experiments was a consequence of different heating rates used in the experiments: "The truth appears to be that if the heating be sufficiently gradual, no reflex movements will be produced even in the normal frog; if it be more rapid, yet take place at such a rate as to be fairly called 'gradual', it will not secure the response of the normal frog under any circumstances".&lt;ref name="Sedgwick1888" /&gt; Goltz had raised the temperature of the water from 17.5&amp;nbsp;°C to 56&amp;nbsp;°C in about ten minutes, or 3.8&amp;nbsp;°C per minute, in his experiment, whereas Heinzmann heated the frogs over the course of 90 minutes from about 21&amp;nbsp;°C to 37.5&amp;nbsp;°C, a rate of less than 0.2&amp;nbsp;°C per minute.&lt;ref name="Offerman 2010"/&gt; In "On the Variation of Reflex Excitability in the Frog induced by changes of Temperature" (1882) [[William Thompson Sedgwick]] writes: "in one experiment by Scripture the temperature was raised at a rate of 0.002°C per second, and the frog was found dead at the end of 2½ hours without having moved."&lt;ref&gt;Edward Scripture, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=Hr0aAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=The+New+Psychology The New Psychology]'' (1897): [https://books.google.com/books?pg=PA300&amp;vq=frog&amp;dq=The+New+Psychology&amp;id=Hr0aAAAAMAAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false]. The original 1872 experiment was cited in: Sedgwick, "On the Variation of Reflex Excitability in the Frog induced by changes of Temperature", ''Stud. Biol. Lab. Johns Hopkins University'' (1882): 385. "in one experiment the temperature was raised at a rate of 0.002&amp;nbsp;°C. per second, and the frog was found dead at the end of 2½ hours without having moved."&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern scientific sources report that the alleged phenomenon is not real. In 1995, Professor [[Douglas A. Melton|Douglas Melton]], of the [[Harvard University]] Biology department, said, "If you put a frog in boiling water, it won't jump out. It will die. If you put it in cold water, it will jump before it gets hot—they don't sit still for you." Dr. George R. Zug, curator of reptiles and amphibians at the [[National Museum of Natural History]], also rejected the suggestion, saying that "If a frog had a means of getting out, it certainly would get out."&lt;ref name=fastcompany /&gt;

In 2002 Dr. Victor H. Hutchison, Professor Emeritus of Zoology at the [[University of Oklahoma]], with a research interest in thermal relations of amphibians, said that "The legend is entirely incorrect!" He described how a [[critical thermal maximum]] for many frog species has been determined by contemporary research experiments: as the water is heated by about 2&amp;nbsp;°F, or 1.1&amp;nbsp;°C, per minute, the frog becomes increasingly active as it tries to escape, and eventually jumps out if the container allows it.&lt;ref name=ecoviews /&gt;

==Uses==

===As metaphor===
{{Quote box | quote  = If you drop a frog in a pot of boiling water, it will of course frantically try to clamber out. But if you place it gently in a pot of tepid water and turn the heat on low, it will float there quite placidly. As the water gradually heats up, the frog will sink into a tranquil stupor, exactly like one of us in a hot bath, and before long, with a smile on its face, it will unresistingly allow itself to be boiled to death. | source = Version of the story from [[Daniel Quinn]]'s ''[[The Story of B]]'' | width  = 40% | align  = right}}

The boiling frog story is generally offered as a [[metaphor]] cautioning people to be aware of even gradual change lest they suffer eventual undesirable consequences. It may be invoked in support of a [[slippery slope]] argument as a caution against [[creeping normality]]. It is also used in business to reinforce that change needs to be gradual to be accepted.&lt;ref name=volokh&gt;{{Cite journal |title=The Mechanisms of the Slippery Slope |first=Eugene |last=Volokh |authorlink=Eugene Volokh |volume=116 |journal=[[Harvard Law Review]] |issue=4 |pages=1026–1137 |year=2003 |jstor=1342743 |doi=10.2307/1342743 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oppositely, the expression "boiling frog syndrome" is sometimes used as shorthand to invoke the pitfalls of standing pat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/guest_contributors/article437601.ece|title=What is ... 'boiling frog syndrome'?|author=David Bolchover|date=March 26, 2005|work=[[The Times]] | location=London|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The story has been retold many times and used to illustrate widely varying viewpoints. Among them: in 1960 about sympathy towards the [[Soviet Union]] during the [[Cold War]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Walter |last=Trohan |title=Report from Washington |newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]] |date=6 June 1960 |page=2 |quote=The frog dropped into boiling water has sense to leap out, but the frog dropped into cold water can be cooked to death before he realizes he is in serious trouble. So it is with us Americans and our civilization in this mounting crisis. We must beware of those who want to thaw the cold war out at any cost. We may be cooked before we realize what has happened.}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1980 about the impending collapse of civilization anticipated by [[Survivalism|survivalists]];&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in {{cite news |first=Cammille |last=Recchia |title=Area Survivalists Circle Wagons for Coming Armageddon; Survivalists Prepare to Ride Out Armageddon; Fearing Economic Chaos, Advocates Store Food, Buy Gold, Silver |newspaper=[[Washington Post]] |date=25 August 1980 |page=C1 |quote=That's what's happening to us. Things are getting worse and worse, so we don't really notice what's happening. Whatever happens will happen slowly, and we won't have time to jump out.}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the 1990s about inaction in response to [[climate change]] and staying in [[Domestic violence|abusive relationships]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Crispin |last=Tickell |title=Human Effects of Climate Change: Excerpts from a Lecture Given to the Society on 26 March 1990 |journal=[[The Geographical Journal]] |volume=156 |issue=3 |year=1990 |pages=325–329 [p. 325] |quote=This is not an experiment I wish to commend, but it has lessons for another animal—ourselves. If drastic change takes place abruptly, we notice and react to it. If it takes place gradually, over a few generations, we are hardly aware of it, and by the time that we are ready to react, it can be too late. |doi=10.2307/635534 |ref=harv|jstor=635534 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Patricia |last=Evans |title=The Verbally Abusive Relationship: How To Recognize it and How to Respond |location=Holbrook, MA |publisher=Adams Media |year=1996 |page=111 |quote=We are not inclined to notice gradual changes. This is how most partners adapt to verbal abuse. They slowly adapt until, like frog number two, they are living in an environment which is killing to their spirit. |isbn=1-55850-582-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been used by [[Libertarianism|libertarians]] to warn about slow erosion of [[civil rights]].&lt;ref name=volokh /&gt;

In the 1996 novel ''[[The Story of B]]'', environmentalist author [[Daniel Quinn]] spends a chapter on the metaphor of the boiling frog, using it to describe human history, population growth and food surplus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Story of B|chapter=The Boiling Frog|last=Quinn|first=Daniel|year=1996|isbn=0-553-37901-1|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Pierce Brosnan]]'s character Harry Dalton mentioned it in the 1997 disaster movie ''[[Dante's Peak]]'' in reference to the accumulating warning signs of the volcano's reawakening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video | people=[[Pierce Brosnan]] (Star), [[Roger Donaldson]] (Director), [[Leslie Bohem]] (Writer) |date=1997 | url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118928/ | title=Dante's Peak| medium=Motion picture | location=USA}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Al Gore]] used a version of the story in a New York Times op ed,&lt;ref name="Gore NYT"&gt;{{cite news|last=Gore|first=Albert|title=An Ecological Kristallnacht. Listen.|date=March 19, 1989|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/03/19/opinion/an-ecological-kristallnacht-listen.html|newspaper=New York Times|accessdate=14 Sep 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; in his presentations and the 2006 movie ''[[An Inconvenient Truth]]'' to describe ignorance about [[global warming]]. In the movie version the frog is rescued before it is harmed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video | people=[[Al Gore]] (Writer), [[Davis Guggenheim]] (Director) |date=2006 | url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0497116/ | title=An Inconvenient Truth | medium=Motion picture | location=USA}}&lt;/ref&gt; This use of the story was referenced by writer/director [[Jon Cooksey]] in the title of his 2010 comedic documentary ''[[How to Boil a Frog]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video | people=[[Jon Cooksey]] (Writer/director) |date=2010 | url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1455659/ | title=How to Boil a Frog | medium=Motion picture | location=Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Law professor and legal commentator [[Eugene Volokh]] commented in 2003 that regardless of the behavior of real frogs, the boiling frog story is useful as a [[metaphor]], comparing it to the metaphor of an [[ostrich]] with its [[Ostrich effect|head in the sand]].&lt;ref name=volokh /&gt; Economics Nobel laureate and ''New York Times'' [[op-ed]] writer [[Paul Krugman]] used the story as a metaphor in a July 2009 column, while pointing out that real frogs behave differently.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/13/opinion/13krugman.html | work=The New York Times | title=Boiling the Frog | first=Paul | last=Krugman | date=2009-07-13 | accessdate=2010-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Journalist [[James Fallows]] has been advocating since 2006 for people to stop retelling the story, describing it as a "stupid canard" and a "myth".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jamesfallows.theatlantic.com/archives/2006/09/the_boiledfrog_myth_stop_the_l.php|title=The boiled-frog myth: stop the lying now!|first=James |last=Fallows |authorlink=James Fallows |work=[[The Atlantic]]|date=13 March 2007|accessdate=2009-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://jamesfallows.theatlantic.com/archives/2007/03/the_boiledfrog_myth_hey_really.php|title=The boiled-frog myth: hey, really, knock it off!|first=James |last=Fallows |work=The Atlantic|date=16 September 2006|accessdate=2009-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; But following Krugman's column, he declared "peace on the boiled frog front" and said that using the story is fine as long as you point out it's not literally true.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jamesfallows.theatlantic.com/archives/2009/07/peace_on_the_boiled_frog_front.php |title=Peace on the boiled frog front |date=July 13, 2009 |first=James |last=Fallows |work=The Atlantic }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In philosophy===
In [[philosophy]] the boiling frog story has been used as a way of explaining the [[sorites paradox]]. It describes a hypothetical heap of sand from which individual grains are removed one at a time, and asks if there is a specific point when it can no longer be defined as a heap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Laurence |last=Goldstein |title=How to boil a live frog |journal=[[Analysis (journal)|Analysis]] |volume=60 |issue=266 |year=2000 |pages=170–178 |quote=The art of frog-boiling is an ancient one, and the correct procedure will emerge in the course of considering an ancient puzzle, the so-called 'Paradox of the Heap' or Sorites. |doi=10.1111/1467-8284.00220 |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12274">'''Caribbean Festival of Arts''', commonly known as '''CARIFESTA''', is an international multicultural event organized on a periodic basis by the countries of the [[Caribbean]].  The main purpose is to gather artists, musicians, authors, and to exhibit the folkloric and artistic manifestations of the Caribbean and [[Latin America]]n region.

==History==
The first Caribbean Festival of Arts took place in 1972. This event was organized by Guyana's then President [[Forbes Burnham]], based on a similar event that took place in [[Puerto Rico]] in 1952. He held a number of conferences with Caribbean artists and writers that eventually led to the first Carifesta.

CARIFESTA was conceived out of an appeal from a regional gathering of artists who were at the time participating in a Writers and Artists Convention in [[Georgetown, Guyana|Georgetown]], Guyana, in 1970 and which coincided with Guyana’s move to [[Republic]]an status.

The three main considerations with regard to the festival were:
* The Festival should be inspirational and should provide artists with the opportunity to discuss among themselves techniques and motivations
* It should be educational in that the people of the Caribbean would be exposed to the values emerging from the various art forms and it should relate to people and be entertaining on a scale and in a fashion that would commend itself to the Caribbean people
* The regional creative festival was first held in Georgetown, Guyana in 1972, attracting creative artistes from over 30 Caribbean and Latin American countries.

It is a celebration of the ethnic and racial diversity which separately and collectively created cultural expressions that are wonderfully unique to the Caribbean.

The cultural village life of CARIFESTA is intended to be a mixture of the States of the [[Caribbean Community]] (CARICOM); the wider Caribbean, Latin America; and a representation of Africa, Asia, Europe and North America
It is a vision of the peoples with roots deep in Asia, Europe and Africa, coming together to perform their art forms and embracing literature inspired by the Caribbean’s own peculiar temperament; paintings drawn from the awe inspiring tropical ecology; and the visionary inheritance of our forefathers

==Aims==
According to the CARICOM Organisation, CARIFESTA aims&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caricom.org/jsp/community_organs/carifesta_background.jsp?menu=cob Caribbean Community (CARICOM) Secretariat.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120428031922/http://www.caricom.org/jsp/community_organs/carifesta_background.jsp?menu=cob |date=April 28, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to:
* depict the life of the people of the region - their heroes, morale, myth, traditions, beliefs, creativeness, ways of expression.
* show the similarities and the differences of the people of the Caribbean and Latin America 
* create a climate in which art can flourish so that artists would be encouraged to return to their homeland.
* awaken a regional identity in Literature.
* stimulate and unite the cultural movement throughout the region.

Described as something of an artistic and cultural "Olympics" observed by both regional and international states, the festival includes both a cultural opening and closing ceremony with many diverse events in between, including:

'''Drama''' - ranging from elaborate musical productions to comedy, fantasy, ritual, history, folk plays and legend.

'''Music''' - concerts, recitals and musical shows provide tantalising folk rhythms, soul-searching jazz, as well as pop, classics and ballet. There are Indian tablas, African drums, Caribbean [[steel pan]], piano, violin, flute and guitar - in other words, music for every taste.

'''Visual Art''' - exhibitions of sculpture, graphics, paintings, drawings, and photographs are a visual testimony of each country's art forms.

'''Literature''' - an anthology of new writing from the Caribbean region is produced for CARIFESTA, and authors often launch their works at the festivals. There are also poetry recitals and lecture discussions at universities and Conference centres.

'''Folklore''' - groups from over a dozen countries reveal the colour and the mystery of Caribbean and Latin American folklore and legend, among them the Conjunto Folklorico Nacionale of [[Cuba]], the Ol'Higue and Baccos of Guyana, [[Shango]] dancers from [[Trinidad]], Shac Shac musicians from [[Dominica]].

'''Crafts''' - among the unusual events at CARIFESTA will be live demonstrations of ceramics, wood carving, painting and drawing.

'''Dance''' - this part of the programme is all-embracing and covers courtly Javanese dancing, intricate ballet, earthy folk plays, dramatic modern choreography, classical Indian movements, spontaneous improvisations and pop.

'''Heritage Exhibitions''' - host countries such as Guyana and Suriname that boast diverse heritage showcase cultural exhibits and anthropological studies of the [[Amerindians|indigenous people]].

'''Family Life''' - CARIFESTA usually includes "Kid Zones" and family workshops to educate and entertain families.

==Regional hosts==
The last host of the festival was [[Guyana]] in 2008. [[Suriname]] has taken up the challenge of hosting the event in 2013 for the second time under the theme "Culture for Development".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.carifesta.net Carifesta XI.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Carifesta now falls under a regional initiative to develop cultural events. In 2008 a task force was set up "...to develop a comprehensive Regional Development Strategy and Action Plan for the Cultural Industries in CARICOM. This Task Force was also to make recommendations for an appropriate incentives regime and financing mechanism for the cultural industries, among other developmental areas to be addressed."
Dr Hilary Brown, CARICOM Secretariat’s Programme Manager for Culture and Community Development, made this announcement at the 21st Meeting of the Regional Cultural Committee (RCC), which opened at the Courtyard Marriott in Paramaribo, Suriname, on Thursday, December 1. She explained that the RCC would discuss with Suriname, plans for CARIFESTA XI, starting with logistic and promotional arrangements.
“The Caribbean Community welcomes the offer of the Government of Suriname to host CARIFESTA XI in 2013 and we are all looking forward to the event with great anticipation, she stated,” noting that CARICOM was at a “crossroads in the development of this highly valued regional expose’ of Caribbean arts and culture.”

It will be the first time the Dutch-speaking CARICOM country will host the event under the new model prescribed in the strategic plan developed in 2004. The new approach provides more opportunities for professional and artistic development for the region’s artists. The plan proposes that CARIFESTA is geared toward inclusion and creating legacy.

Apart from the 15-member CARICOM grouping, the event plans to attract countries of the [[Union of South American Nations]] (UNASUR), of which Suriname has recently become a full member. President [[Dési Bouterse]] was adamant that in the spirit of globalisation more than 40 Latin American countries would also take part - the highest amount of participating nations in CARIFESTA history. He anticipates that Suriname will host more than 2,000 participants, given the fact that the contingents from each country should number at least 50.

Host city [[Paramaribo]] prepares to welcome painters, sculptors, theatrical artists, musicians, dancers and arts and craftsmen. The festival will be held in the historic wooden inner city of Paramaribo and the organisers [https://archive.is/20130119030328/http://cananewsonline.com/features/83088-cmcfeature-caribbean-culture-suriname%E2%80%99s-wants-largest,-all-inclusive-carifesta-2013.html say] “from the Independence Square and the Presidential Palace, down to the heart of town, people are supposed to feel that CARIFESTA is in town. Paramaribo is going to be a Festival City that week”.

Suriname plans to host premier CARIFESTA events such as a [[Curry]]-Duck Fest and a Rum Festival featuring all rums of the region, with bartenders mixing up their cocktails.

In accordance with the advice given by the CARICOM Secretariat, Suriname has budgeted US$5 million for the event, knowing that the cost could increase. The Management Team are looking to various sponsors including the mobile phone companies operating in Suriname as well as the state oil company Staatsolie and gold miner Iamgold to provide much needed funds.

Theatres, exhibition halls, galleries and centres are having infrastructural "face lifts" as the country invites the world to the largest Cultural exhibition.
 
National carrier [[Surinam Airways]] and Dutch airline [[KLM]] are being approached to provide special rates for participants from [[the Netherlands]] which will open CARIFESTA's arms to Europe.

[[The Bahamas]] has received negative reviews for failing to host the festivals twice. Once in 2008 when Guyana took up the challenge and again in 2010 when they had shown no intentions of hosting it. The future of CARIFESTA seems to be strengthening as Haiti bids to host the event in 2015.

During an address at the [[Caribbean Community Heads of Government|33rd Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Caribbean Community]], hosted in July 2012 in [[Saint Lucia]], Haitian President [[Michel Martelly]] asserted that receiving CARIFESTA in his country would make it possible to increase cultural relations with other neighbouring nations.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15178">'''Construction in Process''' was a series of international exhibitions organized by artists in the 80s and 90s all around the world. The originator of this idea was [[Ryszard Wasko]]. Artists who were invited to participate in "Construction in Process" invite in turn, another group of participants, giving the project a dynamic, open character. Another original idea was to spur the artists to create their works on site.

'''Madeleine Beth McCann''' (born 12 May 2003) disappeared on the evening of 3 May 2007 from her bed in a holiday apartment in [[Praia da Luz]], a resort in the [[Algarve]] region of Portugal, sparking what one newspaper called "the most heavily reported missing-person case in modern history".&lt;ref name=Telegraph24April2008/&gt; Her whereabouts remain unknown.&lt;ref name=Rayner26April2016&gt;Gordon Rayner, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/madeleinemccann/11078595/Madeleine-McCann-are-we-any-closer-to-knowing-the-truth.html "Madeleine McCann latest: are police any closer to knowing the truth?"], ''The Daily Telegraph'', 26 April 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Madeleine was on holiday from the UK with her parents, Kate and Gerry McCann; her two-year-old twin siblings; and a group of family friends and their children. She and the twins had been left asleep at 20:30 in the ground-floor apartment, while the McCanns and friends dined in a restaurant 55 metres (180&amp;nbsp;ft) away.&lt;ref name=distance/&gt; The parents checked on the children throughout the evening, until Madeleine's mother discovered she was missing at 22:00. Over the following weeks, particularly after misinterpreting a [[#British DNA analysis|British DNA analysis]], the Portuguese police came to believe that Madeleine had died in an accident in the apartment and that her parents had covered it up. The McCanns were given ''[[arguido]]'' (suspect) status in September 2007, which was lifted when Portugal's attorney general archived the case in July 2008 because of a lack of evidence.&lt;ref name=Govan21July2008/&gt;&lt;ref name=Telegraph9Feb2017/&gt;

The parents continued the investigation using private detectives until [[Scotland Yard]] opened its own inquiry, [[#Operation Grange|Operation Grange]], in 2011. The senior investigating officer announced that he was treating the disappearance as "a criminal act by a stranger", most likely a planned abduction or burglary gone wrong.&lt;ref name=Laville25April2012/&gt; In 2013, Scotland Yard released [[e-fit]] images of men they wanted to trace, including one of a [[#Smith sighting|man seen carrying a child]] toward the beach that night.&lt;ref name=Laville14Oct2013&gt;Sandra Laville, [https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/oct/14/british-detectives-efits-madeleine-mccann-suspect "British detectives release efits of Madeleine McCann suspect"], ''The Guardian'', 14 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after this, the Portuguese police reopened their inquiry.&lt;ref name=BBC24Oct2013/&gt; Operation Grange was scaled back in 2015, but the remaining detectives continued to pursue a small number of inquiries described in April 2017 as significant.&lt;ref name=Evans26April2017/&gt;

The disappearance attracted sustained international interest and saturation coverage in the UK reminiscent of the [[Death of Diana, Princess of Wales|death of Diana]] in 1997.&lt;ref name=Rehling2012Anderson/&gt; The McCanns were subjected to intense scrutiny and baseless allegations of involvement in their daughter's death,{{efn|Simon Foy, former head of homicide, [[Scotland Yard]] (BBC ''[[Panorama (TV series)|Panorama]]'', 3 May 2017): "Even on the first glance of what we looked at, and when we took the information back and ran it through our own understanding and, you know, verified sightings and accounts and statements, and all the rest of it, it was perfectly clear to us that the McCanns themselves had nothing at all to do with the actual disappearance."&lt;ref name=Biltonpolice/&gt;{{pb}}
Pedro do Carmo, deputy director of the [[Polícia Judiciária]] (BBC ''Panorama'', 3 May 2017): "There is no fact at this point or evidence that suggests they [the parents] were involved in Madeleine McCann's disappearance."&lt;ref name=Biltonpolice&gt;Richard Bilton, "Madeleine McCann: 10 Years On", BBC ''Panorama'', 3 May 2017; do&amp;nbsp;Carmo: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EXpmaaEGPs&amp;t=25m32s 00:25:32]; Foy: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EXpmaaEGPs&amp;t=35m58s 00:35:58].&lt;/ref&gt;{{pb}}
[[Mark Rowley]], [[Scotland Yard]]'s assistant commissioner (''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', April 2017), when asked about the McCanns' involvement: "[T]here's no reason whatsoever to reopen that or to start rumours that that's a line of investigation".&lt;ref name=Evans26April2017/&gt;{{pb}}
Esther Addley (''[[The Guardian]]'', 27 April 2012): "It was, the [Portuguese] attorney general found, largely due to a catastrophic misinterpretation of the evidence collected by these officers [Leicestershire police] that the Portuguese team came to suspect the McCanns in the disappearance.&amp;nbsp;... Last month, Matt Baggott, at the time chief constable of Leicestershire, admitted to the [[Leveson inquiry]] that he had known the Portuguese officers, then heavily briefing reporters that the McCanns were guilty, were wrong on crucial DNA evidence. He could have corrected reporters' errors, even behind the scenes, he admitted, but had judged it better not to."&lt;ref&gt;Esther Addley, [https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/apr/27/madeleine-mccann-hope "Madeleine McCann: hope and persistence rewarded"], ''The Guardian'', 27 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt;{{pb}}
[[Brian Cathcart]] (''[[New Statesman]]'', 22 October 2008): "[T]he McCann case was the greatest scandal in our news media in at least a decade&amp;nbsp;... Error on this scale, involving hundreds of 'completely untrue' news reports, published on front pages month after month in the teeth of desperate denials, can only be systemic. Judging by what appeared in print, it involved a reckless neglect of ethical standards, a persistent failure to apply even the most basic journalistic rigour, and plenty of plain cruelty."&lt;ref&gt;Brian Cathcart, [http://www.newstatesman.com/law-and-reform/2008/10/madeleine-mccann-daily-british "The Real McCann Scandal"], ''New Statesman'', 23 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;}} particularly in the [[Tabloid journalism|tabloid press]] and on [[Twitter]].&lt;ref name=OHanlon/&gt;&lt;ref name=Nature&gt;[http://www.nature.com/news/the-dark-side-of-social-media-1.21478 "The dark side of social media"], ''Nature'', editorial, 15 February 2017&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 they and their travelling companions received damages and apologies from [[Northern &amp; Shell|Express Newspapers]],&lt;ref name=damages/&gt; and in 2011 the McCanns testified before the [[Leveson Inquiry]] into British press misconduct, lending support to those arguing for tighter [[Independent Press Standards Organisation|press regulation]].&lt;ref&gt;James Robinson, [https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/nov/23/leveson-inquiry-mccann-testimony-tabloids "Leveson inquiry: McCanns deliver damning two-hour testimony"], ''The Guardian'', 23 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=McCanntestimony/&gt;

Madeleine was born in [[Leicester]] and lived with her family in [[Rothley, Leicestershire|Rothley]], also in Leicestershire. At her parents' request, she was made a [[Ward (law)|ward of court]] in England shortly after the disappearance, which gave the court statutory powers to act on her behalf.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon Raynor, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/madeleinemccann/2164743/Madeleine-McCann-parents-court-bid-for-information.html "Madeleine McCann: parents' court bid for information "], ''The Daily Telegraph'', 20 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McCann 2011, [https://books.google.com/books?id=PIT6SeWkVcAC&amp;pg=PA124 124–125].&lt;/ref&gt; Police described Madeleine as blonde-haired, with blue-green eyes, a small brown spot on her left calf, and a distinctive [[Heterochromia iridum|dark strip]] on the [[Iris (anatomy)|iris]] of her right eye.&lt;ref name=PJmissing&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070824192128/http://www.policiajudiciaria.pt/htm/Ingles/missing_person/madeleine.htm "Missing child"], Polícia Judiciária.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Gerry McCann ([[CNN]], 11 May 2011): "[T]he technical term is [[coloboma]], where there's a defect in the iris.

===Kate and Gerry McCann===
Madeleine's parents are both physicians and practising Roman Catholics. Kate Marie McCann, ''née'' Healy (born 1968, [[Huyton]], near Liverpool) attended All Saints School in Anfield, then Notre Dame High School in Everton Valley, graduating in 1992 with a degree in medicine from the [[University of Dundee]]. She moved briefly into obstetrics and gynaecology, then anaesthetics, and finally general practice.&lt;ref&gt;McCann 2011, 7–10, 18–19.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gerald Patrick McCann (born 1968 in [[Glasgow]]) attended [[Holyrood R.C. Secondary School]] before graduating from the [[University of Glasgow]] with a BSc in physiology/sports science in 1989. In 1992 he qualified in medicine and in 2002 obtained his [[Doctor of Medicine#UK, Ireland and some Commonwealth countries|MD]], a research degree, also from Glasgow. Since 2005 he has been a consultant cardiologist at [[Glenfield Hospital]], Leicester.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/cardiovascular-sciences/people/mccann "Dr Gerry McCann"], University of Leicester. Also see [http://www.bmj.com/content/334/7604/1168.1 Spence 2007], 1168.&lt;/ref&gt; The McCanns met in 1993 in Glasgow and were married in 1998. Madeleine was born in 2003 and the twins, a boy and girl, in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;McCann 2011, 17, 26, 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tapas Seven{{anchor|Tapas Seven}}===
The McCanns were on holiday with seven friends and eight children in all, including the McCanns' three.&lt;ref&gt;McCann 2011, [https://books.google.com/books?id=PIT6SeWkVcAC&amp;pg=PA42 42].&lt;/ref&gt; The nine adults dined together most evenings at 20:30 in the resort's tapas restaurant, as a result of which the media dubbed the friends the Tapas Seven.&lt;ref name=TapasSeven/&gt;

The group included Fiona and David Payne, both physicians, their two children, and Fiona's mother, Dianne Webster. The McCanns had known the Paynes for years; Kate had met Fiona in 2000 when they both worked in [[Leicester General Hospital]]'s intensive care unit.&lt;ref&gt;McCann 2011, 20.&lt;/ref&gt; Accompanying them were two couples the Paynes had originally introduced to the McCanns: Jane Tanner, a marketing manager, and her partner, Russell O'Brien, a physician, who were on holiday with their two children; and Matthew Oldfield, another physician, who was with his wife, Rachael Oldfield, a lawyer and recruitment consultant, and their daughter. Gerry, Russell and Matthew had worked together over the years.&lt;ref&gt;McCann 2011, 42.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TapasSeven&gt;Angela Balakrishnan, [https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/apr/10/madeleinemccann.ukcrime "Key players in the McCann case"], ''The Guardian'', 10 April 2008; [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/7331034.stm "Who are the McCann tapas seven?"], BBC News, 16 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[#21:15: Tanner sighting|"Tanner sighting"]]—Jane Tanner's report that she saw a man carry a child away from the resort 45 minutes before Madeleine was reported missing—became one of the most-discussed aspects of the case.&lt;ref name=McCann2011p76&gt;McCann 2011, 76.&lt;/ref&gt;

The McCanns arrived on Saturday, 28 April 2007, for their seven-night spring break in [[Praia da Luz]], a village with a population of 1,000, known as "little Britain" because of the concentration of British homeowners and holidaymakers.&lt;ref name=Bachrach2008&gt;Judy Bachrach, [http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2008/02/mccanns200802 "Unanswered Prayers"], ''Vanity Fair'', October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; They had booked through the British holiday company [[Mark Warner Ltd]], and were placed in 5A Rua Dr Agostinho da Silva, an apartment owned by a retired teacher from Liverpool, one of several privately owned properties rented by the company.&lt;ref name=Gammell8Aug2008&gt;Caroline Gammell, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/madeleinemccann/2523523/Madeleine-McCann-Apartment-was-not-made-crime-scene-for-two-months.html "Madeleine McCann: Apartment was not made crime scene for two months"], ''The Daily Telegraph'', 8 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

5A was a two-bedroom, ground-floor apartment in the fifth block of a group of apartments known as Waterside Village, which lay on the perimeter of part of Mark Warner's Ocean Club resort.&lt;ref name=Balakrishnan11April2008(1)&gt;Angela Balakrishnan, [https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/apr/11/madeleinemccann1 "The resort that was rocked one night in May"], ''The Guardian'', 11 April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Matthew and Rachel Oldfield were next door in 5B, Jane Tanner and Russell O'Brien in 5D, and the Paynes and Dianne Webster on the first floor.&lt;ref&gt;McCann 2011, 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

The apartment block was not a gated complex. Located on the corner of Rua Dr Agostinho da Silva and Rua Dr Francisco Gentil Martins, 5A was accessible to the public from two sides.&lt;ref&gt;DCI Andy Redwood, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ8jmdWlB8Y ''Crimewatch''], BBC, 14 October 2013, from 00:20:02.&lt;/ref&gt; Sliding glass patio doors in the living room at the back overlooked the Ocean Club's pool, tennis courts, tapas restaurant and bar. The patio doors could be accessed via a public street, Rua Dr Francisco Gentil Martins, where a small gate and set of steps led to 5A's balcony and living room. 5A's front door was on the opposite side of the block from the Ocean Club, on Rua Dr Agostinho da Silva.&lt;ref name=Balakrishnan11April2008(2)/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InJLmyakzeE "Searching for Madeleine"], ''Dispatches'', Channel 4, 18 October 2007, 00:15:21.&lt;/ref&gt;

The McCanns' children slept in a bedroom next to the front door, which the McCanns kept locked. The bedroom had one waist-high window with curtains and a metal exterior shutter, the latter controlled by a cord inside the window; the McCanns kept the curtains and shutter closed throughout the holiday. The window overlooked a narrow walkway and residents' car park, which was separated by a low wall from the street.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InJLmyakzeE "Searching for Madeleine"], ''Dispatches'', 00:06:25.&lt;/ref&gt; Madeleine slept in a single bed next to the bedroom door, on the opposite side of the room from the window, while the twins were in travel cots in the middle of the room. There was another, empty, single bed underneath the window.&lt;ref name=Balakrishnan11April2008(2)/&gt;

Thursday, 3 May, was the penultimate day of the family's holiday. Over breakfast Madeleine asked: "Why didn't you come when [her brother] and I cried last night?" After the disappearance, her parents wondered whether this meant someone had entered the children's bedroom. Her mother also noticed a large brown stain on Madeleine's pyjama top.&lt;ref&gt;McCann 2011, 62–64.&lt;/ref&gt;

The children spent the morning in the resort's Kids' Club, then the family lunched at their apartment before heading to the pool.&lt;ref name=Balakrishnan11April2008(2)&gt;Angela Balakrishnan, [https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/apr/11/madeleinemccann "What happened on the day Madeleine disappeared?"], ''The Guardian'', 11 April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Kate took the last known photograph of Madeleine at 2:29 that afternoon, sitting by the pool next to her father and two-year-old sister.&lt;ref&gt;Giles Tremlett, [https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/may/25/ukcrime.madeleinemccann1 "McCanns release last picture of Madeleine before she vanished"], ''The Guardian'', 25 May 2007.{{pb}}

Madeleine was left asleep in short-sleeved, pink-and-white [[Marks and Spencer]]'s [[Eeyore]] pyjamas, next to her [[comfort blanket]] and a soft toy, Cuddle Cat.&lt;ref&gt;McCann 2011, 67, 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

At 20:30 the parents left 5A to dine with their friends in the Ocean Club's open-air tapas restaurant, located on the other side of the pool.&lt;ref name=McCann2011pp69-70/&gt; 5A lay about 55 metres (160&amp;nbsp;ft) from the restaurant [[as the crow flies]], but getting to the restaurant involved walking along a public street to reach the doors of the Ocean Club resort, then walking through the resort to the other side of the pool, a distance of about 82 metres (295&amp;nbsp;ft).&lt;ref name=distance&gt;For "50 metres (yards)", [http://uk.reuters.com/article/2007/05/04/uk-portugal-girl-idUKL0439120620070504 "Kidnapping concern for missing girl in Portugal"], Reuters, 4 May 2007.{{pb}}
For 60 yards as the crow flies, and a 90-yard walk, "less than a minute's walk away", [[#Summers|Summers &amp; Swan 2014]], 12. Ninety yards would take a minute to walk at a speed of around three miles per hour.&lt;/ref&gt; The top of the apartment was visible from the tapas restaurant, but not the doors. The patio doors could be locked only from the inside, so the McCanns left them closed but unlocked, with the curtains drawn, so they could let themselves in that way when checking on the children. There was a child-safety gate at the top of the steps from the patio and a low gate at the bottom, which led to the street.&lt;ref name=McCann2011pp69-70/&gt;

The resort's staff had left a note in a message book at the swimming-pool reception area, asking that the same table, which overlooked the apartments, be block-booked for 20:30 for the McCanns and friends every evening for the last four evenings of the holiday. The message said the group's children were asleep in the apartments. Madeleine's mother believes the abductor may have seen the note.&lt;ref&gt;McCann 2011, 56, 325.&lt;/ref&gt;

The McCanns and their friends left the restaurant roughly every half-hour to check on their children. Madeleine's father carried out the first check on 5A at around 21:05. The children were asleep and all was well, except that he recalled having left the children's bedroom door slightly ajar, and now it stood almost wide open. He pulled it nearly closed again before returning to the restaurant.&lt;ref name=McCann2011pp69-70&gt;McCann 2011, 69–70.&lt;/ref&gt;

===21:15: Tanner sighting{{anchor|Tanner sighting}}===
[[File:Artist's impression, Madeleine McCann disappearance.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|alt=drawing|Artist's impression of the man Jane Tanner saw, released October 2007; Scotland Yard believe it was [http://archive.is/h0J6O this British tourist] carrying his daughter.&lt;ref name=Redwoodinterview15Oct2013/&gt;]]

The sighting by Jane Tanner, one of the [[#Tapas Seven|Tapas Seven]], of a man carrying a child that night became an important part of the early investigation. She had left the restaurant just after 21:00 to check on her own daughter, passing Madeleine's father on Rua Dr Francisco Gentil Martins on his way back to the restaurant from his 21:05 check. He had stopped to chat to a British holidaymaker,&lt;ref name=ODonnell14Dec2007/&gt; but neither man recalled having seen Tanner. This puzzled the Portuguese police, given how narrow the street was, and led them to accuse Tanner of having invented the sighting.&lt;ref name=Smith16Dec2007/&gt;

Tanner told the police that at around 21:15 she had noticed a man carrying a young child walk across the junction of Rua Dr Francisco Gentil Martins and Rua Dr Agostinho da Silva just ahead of her. He was not far from Madeleine's bedroom, heading east, away from the front of apartment 5A.&lt;ref&gt;"Reconstruction of Tanner sighting", "Madeleine was here", ''Cutting Edge'', Channel 4 (UK), 10 May 2009, 4/5, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na4aBr5PTYY&amp;t=2m34s 00:02:34].&lt;/ref&gt; In the early days of the investigation, the direction in which he was walking was thought to be important, because he was moving toward the home of [[#Murat|Robert Murat]], the 33-year-old British-Portuguese man who lived near apartment 5A, and who became the case's first ''arguido''.{{sfn|Summers|Swan|2014|loc=85}}{{sfn|McCann|2011|loc=76}}&lt;ref name=Gammell5Aug2008&gt;Caroline Gammell, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/madeleinemccann/2503890/Madeleine-McCann-Map-shows-where-abductor-was-spotted.html "Madeleine McCann: Map 'shows where abductor was spotted'"], ''The Daily Telegraph'', 5 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The child in the man's arms was wearing light-coloured pink pyjamas with a floral pattern and cuffs on the legs, similar to Madeleine's. Tanner described the man as white, dark-haired, 5&amp;nbsp;ft 7 in (1.70 m) tall, of southern European or Mediterranean appearance, 35–40 years old, wearing gold or beige trousers and a dark jacket, and said he did not look like a tourist. Tanner told the Portuguese police, but they did not pass the description to the media until 25 May.&lt;ref name=McCann2011p84&gt;McCann 2011, 84.&lt;/ref&gt; Madeleine's Fund hired a forensic artist to create an image of the man ''(left)'', which was released in October 2007.&lt;ref name=McCann20110p230&gt;McCann 2011, 230, 273, 370.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michelle Pauli, [https://www.theguardian.com/news/blog/2007/oct/26/imageofmadeleinesuspect?INTCMP=SRCH "Is this Madeleine McCann's abductor?"], ''The Guardian'', 26 October 2007.{{pb}}

The sighting became important because it offered investigators a time frame for the abduction, but Scotland Yard came to view it as a red herring.&lt;ref name=Redwoodinterview15Oct2013/&gt; In October 2013 they said that a British holidaymaker had been identified as the man Tanner had seen; he had been returning to his apartment after collecting his daughter from the Ocean Club night creche.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Walker, [https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/oct/14/madeleine-mccann-inquiry-suspect-sighting-false-lead "Madeleine McCann inquiry shifts as sighting found to be false lead"], ''The Guardian'', 14 October 2013; Summers and Swan 2014, 254.&lt;/ref&gt; Scotland Yard took photographs of the man wearing the same or similar clothes to the ones he was wearing on the night, and standing in a pose similar to the one Tanner reported. The pyjamas his daughter had been wearing also matched Tanner's report. Operation Grange's lead detective, DCI Andy Redwood, said they were "almost certain" the Tanner sighting was not related to the abduction.&lt;ref name=Redwoodinterview15Oct2013/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;DCI Andy Redwood, ''Crimewatch'', BBC, 14 October 2013, from [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ8jmdWlB8Y&amp;t=21m16s 00:21:16].&lt;/ref&gt;

The rejection of the Tanner sighting as crucial to the timeline allowed investigators to focus on another sighting of a man carrying a child that night, this one reported by Martin and Mary Smith, on holiday from Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;DCI Andy Redwood, ''Crimewatch'', BBC, 14 October 2013, from [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ8jmdWlB8Y&amp;t=23m27s 00:23:27].{{pb}}

The Smiths saw the man at around 22:00 on Rua da Escola Primária, {{convert|500|yards|meters}} from the McCanns' apartment, walking away from the Ocean Club and toward Rua 25 de Abril and the beach. He was carrying a girl aged 3–4 years. She had blonde hair and pale skin, was wearing light-coloured pyjamas, and had bare feet. The man was mid-30s, 5&amp;nbsp;ft 7&amp;nbsp;in–5&amp;nbsp;ft 9&amp;nbsp;in (1.75–1.80 m), slim-to-normal build, with short brown hair, wearing cream or beige trousers. He did not look like a tourist, according to the Smiths, and had seemed uncomfortable carrying the child.&lt;ref name=McCann2011p98&gt;McCann 2011, 98.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Madeleine was here", ''Cutting Edge'', Channel 4 (UK), 10 May 2009, 4/5, 00:05:55; ''Crimewatch'', BBC, 14 October 2013, from 00:23:35.&lt;/ref&gt; E-fits based on the Smiths testimony were first created in 2008 by Oakley International, private investigators hired by the McCanns, and were publicized in 2013 by Scotland Yard on ''[[Crimewatch]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Counihan, [http://www.irishcentral.com/news/Irish-couple-key-witnesses-as-British-police-launch-new-enquiry-into-Madeleine-McCann-case-227647711.html "Irish couple key witnesses as British police launch new enquiry into Madeleine McCann case"], ''Irish Central'', 14 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===22:00: Reported missing===
Madeleine's mother had intended to check on the children at 21:30, but Matthew Oldfield, one of the Tapas Seven, offered to do it when he checked on his own children in the apartment next door to 5A. He noticed that the McCanns' children's bedroom door was wide open, but after hearing no noise, he left 5A without looking far enough into the bedroom to see whether Madeleine was there. He could not recall whether the bedroom window and its exterior shutter were open at this point. Early on in the investigation, the Polícia Judiciária accused Oldfield of involvement because he had volunteered to do the check, suggesting to him that he had handed Madeleine to someone through the bedroom window.&lt;ref name=Balakrishnan11April2008(2)/&gt;&lt;ref name=McCann2011p123&gt;McCann 2011, 123.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kate made her own check of 5A at around 22:00. Scotland Yard said in 2013 that Madeleine was probably taken moments before this.&lt;ref&gt;BBC ''Crimewatch'', 14 October 2013, from 00:23:35.&lt;/ref&gt; Kate recalled entering the apartment through the unlocked patio doors at the back, and noticing that the children's bedroom door was wide open. When she tried to close the door, it slammed shut as though there was a draught, which is when she saw that the bedroom window and its shutter were open. Madeleine's Cuddle Cat and pink blanket were still on the bed, but Madeleine was gone. After briefly searching the apartment, Kate ran back towards the restaurant, screaming "Madeleine's gone! Someone's taken her!"&lt;ref&gt;McCann 2011, [https://books.google.com/books?id=PIT6SeWkVcAC&amp;pg=PA72 71–73]; "Madeleine was here", Channel 4 ''Cutting Edge'', 10 May 2009, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhACS6ck-Dw 1/5], 00:00:45.&lt;/ref&gt;

At around 22:10 Madeleine's father sent Matthew Oldfield to ask the resort's reception desk to call the police, and at 22:30 the resort activated its missing-child search protocol.&lt;ref&gt;McCann 2011, 74.&lt;/ref&gt; Sixty staff and guests searched until 04:30, at first assuming that Madeleine had wandered off. One of them told Channel 4's ''Dispatches'' that, from one end of Luz to the other, you could hear people calling her name.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InJLmyakzeE "Searching for Madeleine"], ''Dispatches'', Channel 4, 18 October 2007, 00:08:36; for the first search being abandoned at 4:30 am: 00:09:33.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two officers from the [[gendarmerie]], the [[Guarda Nacional Republicana]] (GNR), arrived at the resort at 23:10 from [[Lagos, Portugal|Lagos]], five miles (8&amp;nbsp;km) away.&lt;ref&gt;McCann 2011, 75–76.&lt;/ref&gt; At midnight, after briefly searching, they alerted the criminal police, the Polícia Judiciária, in nearby [[Portimão]]. Kate McCann said they arrived just after 1 am.&lt;ref name="McCann 2011, 78"&gt;McCann 2011, 78.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Polícia Judiciária, they arrived within 10 minutes of being alerted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/6984836.stm "Madeleine McCann: The evidence"], BBC News, 8 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Two patrol dogs were brought to the resort at 2&amp;nbsp;am and four search-and-rescue dogs at 8&amp;nbsp;am.&lt;ref&gt;Polícia Judiciária files, cited in McCann 2011, 85.&lt;/ref&gt; Police officers had their leave cancelled and started searching waterways, wells, caves, sewers and ruins.&lt;ref name=Bachrach2008/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Searching for Madeleine", Channel 4 ''Dispatches'', 18 October 2007, 00:20:20; for volunteers: 00:43:32.&lt;/ref&gt; Inspector Gonçalo Amaral, head of the Polícia Judiciária in Portimão, became the inquiry's coordinator.&lt;ref name=Hamilos3Oct2007/&gt;

Not everyone in the resort at the time was interviewed; holidaymakers later contacted the British police to say no one had spoken to them.&lt;ref name=Summers2014p237/&gt; The crime scene was not secured. Police took samples from Madeleine's bedroom, which were sent to three forensic labs in Portugal. It was reported on 1 June 2007 that DNA from one "stranger" had been found, but around 20 people had entered apartment 5A before it was closed off, according to Chief Inspector Olegário de Sousa of the Polícia Judiciária.&lt;ref name=BBC17June2007&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6761669.stm "Madeleine evidence 'may be lost'"], BBC News, 17 June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Smith16Dec2007/&gt; According to Madeleine's mother, an officer placed tape across the doorway of the children's bedroom, but left at 3&amp;nbsp;am without securing the apartment.&lt;ref name="McCann 2011, 78"/&gt; The Polícia Judiciária case file, released in 2008, showed that 5A lay empty for a month after the disappearance, then was let out to tourists before being sealed off in August 2007 for more forensic tests.&lt;ref name=Gammell8Aug2008/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard Edwards, [https://web.archive.org/web/20080226053520/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=%2Fnews%2F2007%2F06%2F01%2Fwmaddy101.xml "The 15 key blunders"], ''The Daily Telegraph'', 2 June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

===British police===
In the UK it was agreed that Madeleine's home force, [[Leicestershire police]]—led by Chief Constable [[Matt Baggott]]—would coordinate the British response, although it remained a Portuguese inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;Summers and Swan 2014, 48–49; for Baggott's position at the time, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/northern_ireland/8196354.stm "Profile: Matt Baggott"], BBC News, 11 August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; A strategic coordinating group, or [[Gold–silver–bronze command structure|"gold" group]], was put together, representing Leicestershire police, the [[Serious Organised Crime Agency]] (SOCA), the [[Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre]] (CEOP), and the [[National Police Improvement Agency]]. The Polícia Judiciária gave a team from the UK a room in which to work, but apparently resented their presence. The British police were used to feeding their data into [[HOLMES 2]] (the Home Office Large Major Enquiry System). In Portugal, information was collected in boxes. In addition the Polícia Judiciária had less autonomy than police in the UK, often having to wait for magistrates' decisions, which slowed things down. In an interview for [[Anthony Summers]]' and Robbyn Swan's book ''Looking for Madeleine'' (2014), [[Jim Gamble]], head of CEOP at the time, said the Portuguese police felt they were being condescended to, and that the British were acting as a "colonial power".&lt;ref&gt;Summers and Swan 2014, 48–49.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Media and PR===

A Polícia Judiciária officer acknowledged in 2010 that the Portuguese police had been suspicious of the McCanns from the start, because of the "media circus".&lt;ref name=Govan12Jan2010/&gt; Gerry McCann told ''Vanity Fair'' in 2008 that he had decided to "market" Madeleine to keep her in the public eye. To that end, a string of public-relations people arrived in Praia da Luz, deeply resented by the local police, who saw the media attention as counterproductive.&lt;ref name=Bachrach2008/&gt; Alex Woolfall of the British PR firm [[Bell Pottinger]], representing Mark Warner Ltd, dealt with the media for the first ten days, then the British government sent in press officers.

===First ''arguido''{{anchor|Murat}}===
{{further|#Libel actions}}
Twelve days after the disappearance, Robert Murat, a 34-year-old British-Portuguese property consultant, became the first ''arguido''.&lt;ref name=Tremlett15May2007/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/may/01/madeleinemccann "Mild-mannered father who became first one accused"], Press Association, 1 May 2008.{{pb}}

Three members of the [[#Tapas Seven|Tapas Seven]]—Fiona Payne, Russell O'Brien and Rachael Oldfield—said they had seen Murat outside apartment 5A shortly after the disappearance, as did an Ocean Club nanny and two British holidaymakers, one a barrister and the other a businesswoman.

Beginning on 15 May, Murat's home was searched, the pool drained, his cars, computers, phones and video tapes examined, his garden searched using ground radar and sniffer dogs, and two of his associates questioned.&lt;ref name=Tremlett15May2007&gt;Giles Tremlett, [https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/may/15/ukcrime.gilestremlett "Madeleine disappearance: Briton's villa searched and three questioned by police"], ''The Guardian'', 15 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/6664271.stm "Russian denies links to Madeleine"], BBC News, 17 May 2007.{{pb}}

===Witness statements{{anchor|sightings|Witness statements}}===
In statements to the Polícia Judiciária, witnesses described men behaving oddly near apartment 5A in the days leading up to the disappearance and on the day itself. Scotland Yard came to believe that these men may have been engaged in [[reconnaissance]], either for an abduction or a burglary. There had been a fourfold increase in local burglaries between January and May 2007, including two in the McCanns' block in the 17 days before the disappearance, during which burglars had entered through windows.&lt;ref name=Redwoodinterview15Oct2013&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-24528530 "Madeleine McCann: Police reveal 'pre-planned abduction' theory"], BBC News, 15 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Redwood 14 Oct, 2013 00:24:38"/&gt;

Several witnesses reported men collecting for charity. On 20 April, four hundred yards from apartment 5A, a bedraggled-looking man asked a tourist in her holiday apartment for money for an orphanage in nearby [[Espiche]]. She described him as pushy and intimidating, and said he made her feel uncomfortable. Apparently there were no orphanages or similar institutions in or near Espiche at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Collins|2008|loc=202–203}}; {{harvnb|Summers|Swan|2014|loc=57–59}}.&lt;/ref&gt; On the afternoon of 25 or 26 April, the tourist who rented apartment 5A before the McCanns encountered a man on his balcony who had entered via the steps from the street.&lt;ref name=Redwood14Oct30:45mins&gt;DCI Andy Redwood, ''Crimewatch'', BBC, 14 October 2013, from [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ8jmdWlB8Y&amp;t=30m45s 00:30:45].&lt;/ref&gt; Polite and clean-shaven, the visitor asked for money for an orphanage.{{sfn|Summers|Swan|2014|loc=58}} On the day of the disappearance, 3 May, there were four charity collections by two men in the streets around 5A.&lt;ref name=Redwood14Oct30:45mins/&gt; At 4 pm two black-haired men approached a British homeowner looking for funds for a hostel or hospice in or near Espiche, and at 5 pm two men approached another British tourist with a similar story.{{sfn|Summers|Swan|2014|loc=58–59}}

An "ugly" blonde-haired man was seen on 29 April on Rua do Ramelhete,&lt;ref name=McCann2011p373/&gt; and again on 2 May across the road from 5A, apparently watching it. On 30 April the granddaughter of 5A's former owners saw a blonde-haired man leaning against a wall behind the apartments, and saw him again on 2 May near the Tapas restaurant, looking at 5A. She described him as Caucasian, mid-30s, short cropped hair, "ugly" with spots.&lt;ref name=McCann2011p373&gt;McCann 2011, 373.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=witnesses/&gt; On the day of the disappearance or the day before, a man was seen staring at the McCanns' apartment block, where a white van was parked.&lt;ref name=witnesses&gt;McCann 2011, 469–473; [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/8036937.stm "'Very ugly' new Madeleine suspect"], BBC News, 6 May 2009; [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXtBWNCFt7U "Madeleine was here]", ''Cutting Edge'', Channel 4, 10 May 2009, 3/5, 00:03:30; for the white van: 00:05:58.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--On the day of the disappearance, between 15:30 and 17:30, two black-haired men visited apartments close to 5A, ostensibly collecting for orphanages. One was in the McCanns' block at 16:00.&lt;ref name=Redwood14Oct30:45mins&gt;DCI Andy Redwood, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCewUVxDi9Y "Madeleine McCann Special"], BBC ''Crimewatch'', 14 October 2013, from 00:30:45.&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;

In the late afternoon of 3 May, the niece of the woman who lived directly above the McCanns was sitting on her aunt's balcony, when she saw a man leave through the gate below, as though he had come out of a ground-floor apartment. What caught her attention was that he looked around before shutting the gate quietly, with both hands.&lt;ref&gt;Summers and Swan 2014, 287–288; McCann 2011, 375.&lt;/ref&gt; At 14:30 two blonde-haired men were seen on the balcony of 5C, an empty apartment two doors from 5A. At 16:00–17:00 a blonde-haired man was seen near 5A. At 18:00 the same or another blonde-haired man was seen in the stairwell of the McCanns' block. At 23:00, after the disappearance, two blonde-haired men were seen in a nearby street speaking in raised voices. When they realized they had been noticed, they reportedly lowered their voices and walked away.&lt;ref name=Crimewatch14Oct201324:45&gt;BBC ''Crimewatch'', 14 October 2013, 00:24:45.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Praia da Luz (4000954897).jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Praia da Luz, July 2009]]
&lt;!--Add RS: The public in Portugal took a hard view of the McCanns for having left the children alone. Portuguese prosecuters considered charging the couple with child abandonment, but came to believe that it was a cultural norm for parents in England to leave their children unattended. In 2016 [[Rui Pereira]], Portugal's Minister of Internal Administration, described the failure to prosecute as a mistake.--&gt;The first indication that the media was turning against the McCanns was on 6 June 2007, when a German journalist asked them during a Berlin press conference whether they were involved in the disappearance.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Edwards, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1553845/Were-good-parents-not-suspects-say-McCanns.html "We're good parents not suspects, say McCanns"], ''The Daily Telegraph'', 7 June 2007.{{pb}}

This and later articles in the Portuguese press, invariably followed up in the UK, made several allegations, based on no evidence, that would engulf the McCanns for years on social media. They included that the McCanns and Tapas Seven were "[[Swinging (sexual practice)|swingers]]", that the McCanns had been sedating their children, and that the group had formed a "pact of silence" regarding what had happened the night of the disappearance.&lt;ref name=Smith9Sept2007&gt;David James Smith, Steven Swinford and Richard Woods, [http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/news/uk_news/article71266.ece "Victims of the rumour mill?"], ''The Sunday Times'', 9 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Much was made of apparent inconsistencies within and between the McCanns' and Tapas Seven's statements. The police had asked the group questions in Portuguese, and an interpreter had translated the replies. According to Kate McCann, the statements were then typed up in Portuguese, and verbally translated back into English for the interviewees to sign.&lt;ref name=McCann2011p123/&gt;&lt;ref name=Smith9Sept2007/&gt;

Among the inconsistencies was whether the McCanns had entered the apartment by the front or back door when checking on the children. According to the Polícia Judiciária case file, Gerry stated during his first interview, on 4 May 2007, that the couple had entered 5A through the locked front door for his 21:05 and her 22:00 checks, and in a second interview, on 10 May, that he had entered through the unlocked patio doors at the back.&lt;ref name=GerryMcCannstatements/&gt; (The patio doors could be unlocked only from inside, so the parents had left them unlocked to let themselves in.)&lt;ref name=McCann2011pp69-70/&gt; There was also an inconsistency about whether the front door had been locked.&lt;ref name=GerryMcCannstatements&gt;Witness statements, Gerry McCann, Polícia Judiciária, Portimão, 4 May 2007 and 10 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Gerry told the ''Sunday Times'' in December 2007 that they had used the front door earlier in the week, but it was next to the children's bedroom, so they had started using the patio doors instead.&lt;ref name=Smith16Dec2007/&gt;

The Polícia Judiciária questioned why, when Kate discovered Madeleine was missing, she had run to the tapas restaurant leaving the twins alone in 5A, when she could have used her cell phone or shouted to the group from 5A's rear balcony.&lt;ref&gt;Chief Inspector Tavares de Almeida, Polícia Judiciária, report to the coordinator of the investigation, 10 September 2007, Polícia Judiciária files, vol X, 2587–2602.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another issue was whether the [[Window shutter#Exterior shutters|exterior shutter]] over Madeleine's bedroom window could be opened from outside. According to journalist Danny Collins, the shutter was made of [[non-ferrous metal]] slats on a roller blind that was housed in a box at the top of the inside window, controlled by pulling on a strap. Once rolled down, the slats locked in place outside the window and could be raised only by using the strap on the inside.{{sfn|Collins|2008|loc=211–212}} Kate said the shutter and window were closed when Madeleine was put to bed, but open when she discovered Madeleine was missing. Gerry told the Polícia Judiciária that, when he was first alerted to the disappearance, he had lowered the shutter, then had gone outside and discovered that it could be raised only from the outside.&lt;ref&gt;Witness statement, Gerry McCann, Polícia Judiciária, Portimão, 10 May 2007; {{harvnb|McCann|2011|loc=73}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Against this, the police said the shutter could not be raised from the outside without being forced, but there was no sign of forced entry; they also said forcing the shutter open would have caused a lot of noise.{{sfn|Collins|2008|loc=211–212}}

The apparent discrepancies contributed to the view of the Polícia Judiciária that there had been no abduction.&lt;ref&gt;David Brown, [http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/world/europe/article2595833.ece "Puzzles and mysteries at the very heart of the investigation"], ''The Times'', 10 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Collins|2008|loc=208–212}} Kate's shout of "they've taken her" was viewed with suspicion, as though she had been paving the way for an abduction story.&lt;ref name=Smith16Dec2007/&gt; Particularly from August onwards, these suspicions developed into the theory that Madeleine had died in apartment 5A as a result of an accident—perhaps after being sedated to help her stay asleep—and that her parents had hidden her body for a month, before retrieving her and driving her to an unknown place in a car they had hired over three weeks after the disappearance.&lt;ref name=Rayner26April2016/&gt;&lt;ref name=Burnett18Sept2007&gt;Victoria Burnett, [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/18/world/europe/18portugal.html "As a Child Disappears, Old Headlines Howl Again"], ''The New York Times'', 18 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 Carlos Anjos, former head of the Police Detectives Union in Portugal, told BBC [[Panorama (TV series)|''Panorama'']] that most Portuguese investigators still believed Madeleine had died as a result of an accident in the apartment.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Bilton, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwx3zDb7u3U "Madeleine: The Last Hope?"], BBC Panorama, 25 April 2012, 00:14:33.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Portugal sends a letter rogatory ====
[[File:Portugal - Algarve - Praia de Luz church (25862670065).jpg|thumb|left|alt=photograph|Church of Nossa Senhora da Luz, where the McCanns attended [[Mass (Catholic Church)|Mass]]]]

On 28 June 2007 the McCanns suggested to the Polícia Judiciária that the police request help from Danie Krugel, a South African former police officer who had developed a "matter orientation system", a handheld device that he claimed could locate missing people using DNA and satellites.&lt;ref name=Smith16Dec2007/&gt; On hearing about this years later, one scientist said it had caused his "BS detector to go off the scale".&lt;ref&gt;Summers and Swan 2014, 140. Also see Ben Goldacre, [https://www.theguardian.com/science/2007/oct/13/krugel "After Madeleine, why not Bin Laden?"], ''The Guardian'', 13 October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Kate McCann wrote in 2011 that Krugel's claims made no sense, but the couple were desperate. In the second week of June they sent him hair and eyelashes from Madeleine collected from the family home by relatives in the UK. Krugel arrived in Praia da Luz on 15 July, and told the McCanns his equipment had picked up a "static signal" in an area of the beach near the Rocha Negra cliff.&lt;ref&gt;McCann 2011, 186–187, 197, 199.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Smith16Dec2007/&gt;&lt;ref name=Townsend7Oct2007&gt;Mark Townsend and Ned Temko, [https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/oct/07/ukcrime.madeleinemccann "Forensic DNA tests 'reveal traces of Madeleine's body on resort beach'"], ''The Guardian'', 7 October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The officer in charge of the Polícia Judiciária inquiry, Inspector Gonçalo Amaral, interpreted Kate's support of Krugel as a ploy. By this point he believed the McCanns were involved in the disappearance, and that Kate was using Krugel—she had also considered using psychics—to "disclose the location of her daughter's body" without compromising herself.&lt;ref&gt;Gonçalo Amaral, quoted in Summers and Swan 2014, 141.&lt;/ref&gt;

With this in mind, the Polícia Judiciária sent a [[Letters rogatory|letter rogatory]] to the British police to ask for assistance in their search for Madeleine's body.&lt;ref name=Smith16Dec2007/&gt;&lt;ref name=Townsend7Oct2007/&gt; In response Mark Harrison, the national search adviser for the British [[National Policing Improvement Agency]], arrived in Praia da Luz in July. He walked around the search areas, and flew over them by helicopter.&lt;ref name=Summers2014pp141-142&gt;Summers and Swan 2014, 141–142.&lt;/ref&gt; His report, dated 23 July 2007, described Krugel's ideas as "highly unlikely". It said that 100 officers had searched up to 9.3 miles around Praia da Luz, but that the officer in charge and most of the team had no training in search procedures, with the exception of a search-and-rescue team from Lisbon. [[Detection dog|Search dogs]] had been used, but after five days instead of within two days as the handlers recommend. Harrison suggested searching the beach and shoreline, an open area near the village, Robert Murat's property, apartment 5A, the Tapas Seven's apartments, and any hired vehicles. He recommended using ground-penetrating radar and bringing in Keela and Eddie, two [[English Springer Spaniel|Springer spaniel]] sniffer dogs from South Yorkshire.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.standard.co.uk/news/judge-admits-madeleines-case-was-at-a-dead-end-in-december-but-it-took-another-7-months-to-clear-6911947.html "Judge admits Madeleine's case was at a 'dead end' in December&amp;nbsp;–but it took another 7 months to clear McCanns"], ''London Evening Standard'', 12 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Summers2014pp141-142/&gt;

Keela was a crime-scene-investigation (CSI) dog trained to give her handler, Martin Grime, a "passive alert" to the scent of human blood by placing her nose close to the spot, then freezing in that position.

Both dogs alerted behind the sofa in the living room of 5A, and Eddie gave an alert near the wardrobe in the main bedroom.{{sfn|Summers|Swan|2014|loc=147–148}}&lt;ref name=dogs/&gt; There were no alerts on the beach or wasteland.{{sfn|Summers|Swan|2014|loc=149}} The Polícia Judiciária obtained search warrants to search the house the McCanns had rented on Rua das Flores, and the silver [[Renault Scénic]] the couple had hired 24 days after Madeleine went missing. The house and grounds were searched on 2 August. The only alert was from Eddie when he encountered Cuddle Cat, which was lying in the living room; Keela did not give an alert.{{sfn|Summers|Swan|2014|loc=149–150}} The police left with boxes of the McCanns' clothes, Cuddle Cat, a pair of latex gloves, suitcases, a notepad, two diaries, including one that Kate had started after the disappearance, and a friend's Bible she had borrowed. A passage the Bible's owner had marked from [[Books of Samuel|2 Samuel]], about the death of a child, was copied into the police case file along with a Portuguese translation.{{sfn|Summers|Swan|2014|loc=150–152}} The items were taken to another location, where Eddie alerted to one of the boxes of clothes.{{sfn|Summers|Swan|2014|loc=150}} A source close to the McCanns' lawyers told reporters that, if there was indeed a smell of corpses on Kate's clothes, it could have been caused by her contact with corpses as a family doctor.&lt;ref&gt;Caroline Gammell, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1563381/Madeleine-McCanns-parents-look-to-US-sniffer-dog-case.html "Madeleine McCann's parents look to US sniffer dog case"], ''The Daily Telegraph'', 17 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The police removed the silver Renault Scenic the McCanns had hired three weeks after the disappearance,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McCann|2011|loc=241}}; {{harvnb|Summers|Swan|2014|loc=152}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on 6 August Keela and Eddie were taken to an underground car park opposite the Polícia Judiciária headquarters in Portimão, where 10 cars were parked, 20–30 feet apart, including the McCanns' and Robert Murat's.{{sfn|Summers|Swan|2014|loc=152–153}} Eddie, the cadaver dog, gave an alert outside the McCanns' car by the driver's door.{{sfn|Summers|Swan|2014|loc=153}}&lt;ref name=dogs&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4NMYPsFKb8&amp;t=1168s Keela and Eddie in 5A]; [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EHJjpXii9o In the car park and 5A], Polícia Judiciária, August 2007, released 11 August 2008, courtesy of YouTube.&lt;/ref&gt; 
The next morning Keela alerted to the rear driver's side inside the [[Trunk (automobile)|boot]] (trunk) and the map compartment in the driver's door, which contained the ignition key and key ring. When the key ring was hidden underneath sand in a fire bucket, she alerted again, as she did when the bucket was moved to a different floor of the car park.{{sfn|Summers|Swan|2014|loc=153}}&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Alderson and Tom Harper, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1562579/The-allegations-facing-the-McCanns.html "The allegations facing the McCanns"], ''The Daily Telegraph'', 9 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Almost immediately the Portuguese press began running stories that Madeleine had died inside apartment 5A.&lt;ref&gt;Summers and Swan 2014, 154–156.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--check this: David Smith, writing in ''The Sunday Times'', argued that there were instances of handler cueing on the tape.

When Eddie moved away from it, Smith wrote, the handler appeared to call him back.

====British DNA analysis{{anchor|British DNA analysis}}====
Hair and other fibres were collected from areas in the car and apartment 5A where Keela and Eddie had given alerts, and were sent to the [[Forensic Science Service]] (FSS) in Birmingham for [[DNA profiling]], arriving around 8 August 2007.&lt;ref&gt;Sandra Laville, [https://www.theguardian.com/crime/article/0,,2143554,00.html "UK lab to test blood found in Madeleine room"], ''The Guardian'', 7 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; At this point, according to the ''Sunday Times'', the Polícia Judiciária "abandoned the abduction theory".&lt;ref name=Smith16Dec2007/&gt; On 8 August, without waiting for the results from Birmingham, the Portuguese police called the McCanns to a meeting in Portimão, where Guilhermino Encarnação, Polícia Judiciária regional director, and Luis Neves, coordinator of the Direcção Central de Combate ao Banditismo in Lisbon, told them the case was now a murder inquiry.&lt;ref name=Summers2014p158&gt;Summers and Swan 2014, 158.&lt;/ref&gt; When Encarnação died of stomach cancer in 2010, ''The Daily Telegraph'' identified him as a major source of the leaks against the McCanns.&lt;ref name=Mendick6March2010/&gt; Both the McCanns were interrogated that day; the officers suggested that Kate's memory was faulty.&lt;ref name=Summers2014p158/&gt;

The FSS used a technique known as [[low copy number]] (LCN) testing. Used when only a few cells are available, the test is controversial because it is vulnerable to contamination and misinterpretation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0963662509336710 Machado and Santos 2011], 312–313; for background, see [http://www.cps.gov.uk/publications/prosecution/lcn_testing.html "Low Copy Number DNA testing in the Criminal Justice System"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130628204704/http://www.cps.gov.uk/publications/prosecution/lcn_testing.html |date=28 June 2013 }}, Crown Prosecution Service, cps.gov.uk.&lt;/ref&gt; On 3 September John Lowe of the FSS emailed Detective Superintendent Stuart Prior of the Leicestershire police, the liaison officer between the British and Portuguese police. Lowe told Prior that a sample from the car boot contained 15 out of 19 of Madeleine's DNA components, and that the result was "too complex for meaningful interpretation":

&lt;blockquote style="border-left: 3px solid #ccc;"&gt;A complex LCN [low copy number] DNA result which appeared to have originated from at least three people was obtained from cellular material recovered from the luggage compartment section&amp;nbsp;... Within the DNA profile of Madeleine McCann there are 20 DNA components represented by 19 peaks on a chart.&amp;nbsp;... Of these 19 components 15 are present within the result from this item; there are 37 components in total. There are 37 components because there are at least 3 contributors; but there could be up to five contributors. In my opinion therefore this result is too complex for meaningful interpretation/inclusion.&amp;nbsp;... [W]e cannot answer the question: Is the match genuine, or is it a chance match.{{efn|The email from John Lowe ([[Forensic Science Service]], 3 September 2007) continued: "The individual components in Madeleine's profile are not unique to her; it is the specific combination of 19 components that makes her profile unique above all others. Elements of Madeleine's profile are also present within the profiles of many of the scientists here in Birmingham, myself included. It's important to stress that 50% of Madeleine's profile will be shared with each parent. It is not possible, in a mixture of more than two people, to determine or evaluate which specific DNA components pair with each other.&amp;nbsp;... Therefore, we cannot answer the question: Is the match genuine, or is it a chance match."&lt;ref&gt;John Lowe, Forensic Science Service, Birmingham, email to Detective Superintendent Stuart Prior, Leicestershire police, 3 September 2007, released 4 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James Orr, Brendan de Beer and agencies, [https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/aug/04/madeleinemccann.portugal "UK police warned on DNA evidence before McCanns became suspects"], ''The Guardian'', 4 August 2008; McCann 2011, 331.&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====McCanns made ''arguidos''====
The Forensic Science Service email was translated into Portuguese on 4 September. The next day, according to Kate, the Polícia Judiciária proposed that, if she were to admit that Madeleine had died in an accident in the apartment, and that she had hidden the body, she might only serve a two-year sentence. Her husband would not be charged and would be free to leave.&lt;ref&gt;McCann 2011, 243.&lt;/ref&gt; Both parents were given ''arguido'' status on 7 September,&lt;ref&gt;James Sturcke and James Orr, [https://www.theguardian.com/crime/article/0,,2164354,00.html "Kate McCann 'fears Madeleine killing charge over blood traces in car'"], ''The Guardian'', 7 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and were advised by their lawyer not to answer questions. The Polícia Judiciária told Gerry that Madeleine's DNA had been found in the car boot and behind the sofa in 5A.&lt;ref&gt;Caroline Gammell, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/madeleinemccann/2501055/Madeleine-McCann-Portuguese-detectives-lied-to-Gerry-McCann-about-DNA-evidence.html "Madeleine McCann: Portuguese detectives lied to Gerry McCann about DNA evidence"], ''The Daily Telegraph'', 4 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Gerry did respond to questions, but Kate declined to reply to 48 questions she was asked during an 11-hour interview.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7542939.stm "The questions put to Kate McCann"], BBC News, 6 August 2008; McCann 2011, 248.&lt;/ref&gt;

The DNA evidence was a "100 percent match", journalists in Portugal were told.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon Rayner, Caroline Gammell and Nick Britten, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1562710/Madeleine-McCann-DNA-an-accurate-match.html "Madeleine McCann DNA 'an accurate match'"], ''The Daily Telegraph'', 12 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; British tabloid headlines included "Brit Lab Bombshell: Car DNA is 100% Maddie's" (''The Sun'', 11 September 2007) and "Corpse in McCann Car" (''London Evening Standard'', 16 October 2007), while the ''Daily Star'' reported that a "clump of Maddie's hair" had been found in the car.&lt;ref&gt;"Searching for Madeleine", Channel 4 ''Dispatches'', 18 October 2007, 00:41:10; for the ''Evening Standard'', [[#Goc|Goc 2009]], 39.&lt;/ref&gt; Jerry Lawton, a ''Daily Star'' reporter, told the [[Leveson Inquiry]] in March 2012 that the leaks had come directly from the Portuguese police.{{efn|Jerry Lawton, ''[[Daily Star (British newspaper)|Daily Star]]'' ([[Leveson Inquiry]], 19 March 2012): "Portuguese police leaked in briefings in Portugal to their journalists that the forensic test results positively showed that Madeleine had been in or linked her to the hire car that her parents didn't hire until three or four weeks after she'd disappeared, and that story became a—created a sea change, without overusing that word, in the way the story has been looked at.{{pb}}"Those forensic test results became a bone of contention between the UK and the Portuguese police. I was present when a Portuguese team of forensic experts and detectives arrived in Leicester to discuss these results. Of course, they'd already leaked a version of the results. Leicestershire police presumably knew—although it turns out obviously that those test results did not prove that and that the Portuguese police had somehow misinterpreted these results. I just felt that had this been—that Leicestershire police could have briefed, off the record, even unreportable, that the Portuguese police had misinterpreted those DNA results.&amp;nbsp;...{{pb}}"Every time you rang Leicestershire police on that inquiry—and it was a lot, from every media organisation—you were told: 'It's a Portuguese police inquiry. You'll have to contact the Portuguese police.' And of course, they were fully aware that the Portuguese police had judicial secrecy laws and they wouldn't talk about the case."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.levesoninquiry.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Transcript-of-Afternoon-Hearing-19-March-2012.pdf Jerry Lawton: transcript of testimony], Leveson Inquiry, 19 March 2012, afternoon hearing, 85–98.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Matt Baggott]]—who when Madeleine disappeared was chief constable of [[Leicestershire Police]], the force that coordinated the British side of the case—told the inquiry that, because the Portuguese were in charge of the case, he had made a decision not to correct reporters. His force's priority, he said, was to maintain a good relationship with the Polícia Judiciária with a view to finding Madeleine.&lt;ref name=OCarroll28March2012&gt;Lisa O'Carroll, [https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/mar/28/leveson-madeleine-mccann-dna-police "Leveson inquiry: ex-police chief defends not preventing false McCann DNA reports"], ''The Guardian'', 28 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|[[Matt Baggott]], former chief constable of [[Leicestershire Police]] ([[Leveson Inquiry]], 28 March 2012): "[A]s a chief constable at the time, there were a number of I think very serious considerations. One for me, and the Gold Group who were running the investigation, which was a UK effort, was very much a respect for the primacy of the Portuguese investigation. We were not in the lead in relation to their investigative strategy. We were merely dealing with enquiries at the request of the Portuguese and managing the very real issues of the local dimension of media handling, so we were not in control of the detail or the facts or where that was going.{{pb}}"I think the second issue was there was an issue, if I recall, of Portuguese law. Their own judicial secrecy laws. I think it would have been utterly wrong to have somehow in an off the record way have breached what was a very clear legal requirement upon the Portuguese themselves....{{pb}}"There was also an issue for us of maintaining a very positive relationship with the Portuguese authorities themselves. I think this was an unprecedented inquiry in relation to Portugal. The media interest, their own reaction to that. And having a very positive relationship of confidence with the Portuguese authorities I think was a precursor to eventually and hopefully one day successfully resolving what happened to that poor child.{{pb}}"So the relationship of trust and confidence would have been undermined if we had gone off the record in some way or tried to put the record straight, contrary to the way in which the Portuguese law was configured and their own leadership of that."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.levesoninquiry.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Transcript-of-Afternoon-Hearing-28-March-2012.pdf Matt Baggott: transcript of testimony], Leveson Inquiry, 28 March 2012, afternoon hearing, 68–71; also see 76–83.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.levesoninquiry.org.uk/hearing/2012-03-28pm/ Matt Baggott], Leveson Inquiry, 28 March 2012, afternoon hearing (video), from 104:38 and 115:22.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.levesoninquiry.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Witness-Statement-of-Chief-Constable-Matthew-Baggott.pdf Matt Baggott's witness statement], Leveson Inquiry, question 50, 22–25.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====McCanns return to the UK, Almeida report====
{{Madeleine McCann timeline}}
Despite their ''arguido'' status, the McCanns were allowed to leave Portugal, and on legal advice did so immediately, arriving back in England on 9 September 2007.&lt;ref&gt;Summers and Swan 2014, 170; [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6985454.stm "Madeleine parents head back to UK"], BBC News, 9 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The following day Chief Inspector Tavares de Almeida of the Polícia Judiciária in Portimão signed a nine-page report concluding that Madeleine had died in apartment 5A as a result of an accident, that the meal in the tapas restaurant and apparent regular checks on the McCann children had been part of the cover-up, that the Tapas Seven had helped to mislead the police, and that the McCanns had concealed the body, then faked an abduction.

In the UK [[Control Risks Group|Control Risks]], a British security company—paid by an anonymous donor to assist the McCanns since 7 May—took [[Drug test#Hair drug testing|hair samples]] from the McCann twins on 24 September, at their parents' request. The twins had slept through the commotion in apartment 5A after Madeleine was reported missing; Kate wrote that she was concerned the abductor might have given the children sedatives.&lt;ref&gt;Summers and Swan 2014, 213–214; McCann 2011, 213–214. For Control Risks having been involved since May 2007, see David Brown, Patrick Foster, "Private security team hired by Kate and Gerry McCann for secret investigation", ''The Times'', 24 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Polícia Judiciária files, Kate had asked them to take samples, three months after the disappearance, but they had not done so.&lt;ref&gt;Summers and Swan 2014, 165.&lt;/ref&gt; Control Risks took a sample from Kate too, to rebut allegations that she was on medication. No trace of drugs was found.&lt;ref&gt;Summers and Swan 2014, 213–214; Fiona Govan, [https://web.archive.org/web/20071125091708/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=%2Fnews%2F2007%2F11%2F23%2Fwmaddy223.xml "Madeleine McCann's mother takes drug test"], ''The Daily Telegraph'', 23 November 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 September, according to a diplomatic cable published by [[WikiLeaks]] in 2010, the American ambassador to Portugal, Al Hoffman, wrote of his British counterpart, [[Alexander Ellis (diplomat)|Alexander Ellis]]: "Without delving into the details of the case, Ellis admitted [during a meeting on 21 September] that the British police had developed the current evidence against the McCann parents, and he stressed that authorities from both countries were working co-operatively."&lt;ref&gt;Ben Quinn, [https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/dec/13/wikileaks-madeleine-mccann-british-police "WikiLeaks cables: UK police 'developed' evidence against McCanns"], ''The Guardian'', 13 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For the date of the meeting, [https://www.theguardian.com/world/us-embassy-cables-documents/124011 "US embassy cables: British police 'developed evidence' against McCanns, Washington told "], ''The Guardian'', 13 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gonçalo Amaral's removal, later developments===
On 2 October 2007 Chief Inspector Gonçalo Amaral, the inquiry's coordinator, was removed from his post and transferred from Portimão to Faro after telling the newspaper ''[[Diário de Notícias]]'' that the British police had only pursued leads helpful to the McCanns, ignoring that the couple were suspects. As an example, he criticized their decision to follow up an anonymous email to [[Prince Charles]] that claimed a former Ocean Club employee had taken Madeleine.&lt;ref name=Hamilos3Oct2007/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Summers and Swan 2014, 181–182.&lt;/ref&gt;

Amaral was himself an ''arguido'' in relation to his investigation of another case, the [[disappearance of Joana Cipriano]]. One day after Madeleine's disappearance, Amaral was made ''arguido'', and a month later he was charged with making a false statement. Four other officers were charged with assault. Eight-year-old Joana had vanished in 2004 from [[Figueira (Faro)|Figueira]], seven miles (11&amp;nbsp;km) from Praia da Luz. Her body was never found, and no murder weapon was identified. Her mother and the mother's brother were convicted of her murder after confessing, but the mother retracted her confession, saying she had been beaten by police. Amaral was not present when the beating is alleged to have taken place, but he was accused of having covered up for others. The other detectives were acquitted. Amaral was convicted of perjury in May 2009 and received an 18-month suspended sentence.&lt;ref&gt;Summers and Swan 2014, 110; Caroline Gammell, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1563383/Detective-accused-in-case-of-missing-girl.html "Detective accused in case of missing girl"], ''The Daily Telegraph'', 17 September 2007.{{pb}}

Amaral was replaced by Paulo Rebelo, deputy national director of the Polícia Judiciária.

===Inquiry closed (21 July 2008)===
On 21 July 2008 the Portuguese Attorney General, Fernando José Pinto Monteiro, announced that there was no evidence to link the McCanns or Robert Murat to the disappearance. Their ''arguido'' status was lifted and the case was closed. Monteiro said in a statement:

&lt;blockquote style="border-left: 3px solid #ccc;"&gt;The case involving Madeleine McCann will be shelved following the decision by the two magistrates in charge that no evidence was found to implicate the arguidos. Hereby the condition of all three arguidos ceases&amp;nbsp;... and the bail measures imposed upon the same have expired. If they appeal against the decision it can be reopened.&amp;nbsp;...

===Private investigators===
Madeleine's Fund hired several firms of private investigators, causing friction with the Portuguese police. Shortly after the disappearance, an anonymous benefactor paid for the services of a British security company, [[Control Risks Group|Control Risks]].&lt;ref&gt;McCann 2011, 125; James Sturcke and agencies, [https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/sep/24/ukcrime.world "McCanns still cling to hope, says spokesman"], ''The Guardian'', 24 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Brian Kennedy hired a Spanish agency, Método 3, for six months at £50,000 a month, which put 35 investigators on the case in Europe and Morocco. Kennedy went to Morocco himself in 2007 to look into one sighting.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Swinford, John Follainin and Mohamed El Hamraoui, [http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/news/uk_news/article72585.ece "McCanns send sleuths to Morocco"], ''The Sunday Times'', 30 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hollingsworth24Aug2009/&gt;&lt;ref name=Summers10Sept2014/&gt;

One of the private investigators was David Edgar, a retired detective inspector, hired on the recommendation of the head of Manchester's Serious Crime Squad.&lt;ref&gt;Summers and Swan 2014, 141.&lt;/ref&gt; Edgar released an e-fit in August 2009 of a woman said to have asked two British men in [[Barcelona]], Spain, shortly after the disappearance, whether they were there to deliver her new daughter.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/madeleinemccann/5990664/Madeleine-McCann-investigators-swamped-with-calls-about-new-lead.html "Madeleine McCann investigators swamped with calls about new lead"], ''The Daily Telegraph'', 7 August 2009; [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/picturegalleries/uknews/5982953/Madeleine-McCann-E-fits-of-suspects.html "Madeleine McCann: E-fits of suspects"], ''The Daily Telegraph'', 6 August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Other private initiatives included a Portuguese lawyer financing the search of a reservoir near Praia da Luz in February 2008,&lt;ref&gt;Martina Smit, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1577580/Divers-search-lake-for-Madeleine-McCann.html "Divers search lake for Madeleine McCann"], ''The Daily Telegraph'', 5 February 2008; [http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/europe/03/12/mccann.lake/index.html "'Underworld' tip leads to new Maddie hunt"], CNN, 12 March 2008; Howard Brereton, [https://web.archive.org/web/20121120210914/http://www.typicallyspanish.com/news/publish/article_15596.shtml "Spanish detective agency confirms bones found are not of missing Madeleine McCann"], ''Typically Spanish'', 16 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; and the use of [[Ground-penetrating radar|ground radar]] by a South African property developer, Stephen Birch, who said in 2012 that scans showed there were bones beneath the driveway of a house in Praia da Luz.&lt;ref&gt;David Lohr, [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/20/madeleine-mccann-update_n_1898023.html "Madeleine McCann May Be Buried Under Driveway; Authorities Seem Unwilling To Investigate"], ''The Huffington Post'', 20 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oakley International{{anchor|Oakley}}===
{{further|#Smith sighting}}
In 2008 Madeleine's Fund hired Oakley International, a Washington, D.C.-registered detective agency, for over £500,000 for six months.&lt;ref name=Hollingsworth24Aug2009/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jerome Taylor, [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/fbi-hunts-for-investigator-paid-163500000-by-mccanns-1825920.html "FBI hunts for investigator paid £500,000 by McCanns"], ''The Independent'', 23 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McCann 2011, 349–350.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIMdZPC1uPE "The McCanns and the Conman"], Channel Five, 20 June 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; (The company owner, Kevin Halligen, was arrested in 2009 in connection with an unrelated fraud allegation.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Sullivan, [https://articles.washingtonpost.com/2012-06-09/lifestyle/35459736_1_british-spy-london-office-intelligence "Fraud suspect Kevin Richard Halligen allegedly posed as a spy and cheated the elite on both sides of the Atlantic"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029184144/http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2012-06-09/lifestyle/35459736_1_british-spy-london-office-intelligence |date=29 October 2013 }}, ''The Washington Post'', 9 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;) Oakley sent a five-man team to Portugal. Led by Henri Exton, a former British police officer who had worked for [[MI5]], the team engaged in undercover operations within the Ocean Club and among paedophile rings and the [[Romani people|Roma]] community.&lt;ref name=Hollingsworth24Aug2009&gt;Mark Hollingsworth, "The McCann Files", ''ES Magazine'' (''London Evening Standard''), 24 August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Exton questioned the significance of the [[#Tanner sighting|Tanner sighting]] of a man carrying a child at 21:15 near apartment 5A, and focused instead on the [[#Smith sighting|Smith sighting]] at 22:00—the sighting by Martin and Mary Smith of a man carrying a child near the McCanns' apartment that night. The Oakley team [[:File:Efit images of Madeleine McCann suspect.jpg|produced e-fits]] based on the Smiths' description. This was a sensitive issue, because in September 2007 Martin Smith had watched footage of the McCanns arriving in the UK from Portugal, and believed he recognized Gerry McCann as the man he had seen with the child in Praia da Luz. Smith came to accept that he was mistaken: at 22:00 witnesses placed Gerry McCann in the tapas restaurant. Nevertheless, publication of the Smith e-fits, which bore some resemblance to Gerry, would have fed the conspiracy theories about the McCanns.&lt;ref name=SundayTimes27Oct2013/&gt;

Exton submitted his report to Madeleine's Fund in November 2008, but the fund told Exton that the report and its e-fits had to remain confidential. The relationship between the company and the fund had soured, in part because of a dispute over fees, and in part because the report was critical of the McCanns and their friends; it suggested that Madeleine may have died in an accident after leaving the apartment herself through its unlocked patio doors.&lt;ref name=SundayTimes27Oct2013/&gt; The fund passed the e-fits to the police—the Polícia Judiciária and Leicestershire police had them by October 2009, and Scotland Yard received them when they became involved in August 2011&lt;ref name=SundayTimes28Dec2013&gt;[http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/comment/regulars/corrections/article1357081.ece "Kate and Gerry McCann and Madeleine's Fund"], ''The Sunday Times'', 28 December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;—but did not otherwise release them. Kate McCann did not include them with the other images of suspects in her book, ''Madeleine'' (2011), although she suggested that both the Tanner and Smith sightings were crucial.&lt;ref name=SundayTimes27Oct2013/&gt;

Scotland Yard released the e-fits in 2013 for a BBC ''Crimewatch'' reconstruction. After it had aired, ''The Sunday Times'' published that the McCanns had had the e-fits since 2008.&lt;ref name=SundayTimes27Oct2013/&gt; In response the couple sued the newspaper for having implied (wrongly) that they had not only failed to publish them but had withheld them from the police. The newspaper apologized and paid £55,000 in damages.&lt;ref name=SundayTimes28Dec2013/&gt;&lt;ref name=STlawsuit&gt;William Turvill, [http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/sunday-times-sued-mccanns-over-story-which-wrongly-claimed-evidence-was-withheld-police/ "Sunday Times sued by McCanns over story which wrongly claimed evidence was withheld from police"], ''PressGazette'', 19 September 2014.{{pb}}

The McCanns met the British [[Home Secretary]] [[Alan Johnson]] in 2009 to request a review of the case.&lt;ref&gt;McCann 2011, 366.&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson commissioned a scoping report from [[Jim Gamble]], then head of the [[Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre]] (CEOP).&lt;ref name=Mendick6March2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gamblereport/&gt; By March 2010 the Home Office had begun discussions with the [[Association of Chief Police Officers]] about setting up a British inquiry.&lt;ref name=Mendick6March2010&gt;Robert Mendick, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/madeleinemccann/7384911/Home-Office-launches-secret-review-into-Madeleine-McCanns-disappearance.html "Home Office launches secret review into Madeleine McCann's disappearance"], ''The Daily Telegraph, 6 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=May29May2012p97-98&gt;[http://www.levesoninquiry.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Transcript-of-Morning-Hearing-29-May-2012.txt Theresa May's testimony], Leveson Inquiry, 29 May 2012, 97–98.&lt;/ref&gt;

Delivered in May 2010, the Gamble report examined how several British agencies had become involved in the search for Madeleine, including CEOP itself, [[Leicestershire police]], the [[Metropolitan Police Service]], the [[Serious Organised Crime Agency]], the [[National Police Improvement Agency]], [[Crimestoppers]], the [[Home Office]], [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office|Foreign Office]] and [[10 Downing Street]].&lt;ref name=Gamblereport/&gt;

Gamble criticized the lack of coordination. Everyone had wanted to help, and some had wanted "to be seen to help", he wrote, which had "created a sense of chaos and a sense of competition", hampering the inquiry by causing resentment among the Portuguese police.&lt;ref name=Gamblereport&gt;Martin Brunt, [http://news.sky.com/story/madeleine-secret-report-on-police-probe-10391226 "Madeleine: Secret Report On Police Probe"], Sky News, 1 September 2014.{{pb}}

===Operation Grange{{anchor|Operation Grange}}===

In May 2011, under Home Secretary [[Theresa May]], Scotland Yard launched an investigative review, Operation Grange, with a team of 29 detectives and eight civilians.&lt;ref name=OperationGrange&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20131105000435/http://www.met.police.uk/foi/pdfs/disclosure_2011/september/2011080000691.pdf "Freedom of Information Request"], Metropolitan Police; [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-25710744 "Madeleine McCann: UK police request Portuguese assistance"], BBC News, 13 January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The announcement of the review appeared to have been triggered by a [[News International]] campaign, by way of one of its British tabloids, [[The Sun (United Kingdom)|''The Sun'']].&lt;ref name=Leveson11May2012&gt;[http://www.levesoninquiry.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Transcript-of-Morning-Hearing-11-May-2012.pdf "Transcript of morning hearing, 11 May 2012"] (examination of [[Rebekah Brooks]]), Leveson Inquiry: Culture Practice and Ethics of the Press, nationalarchives.gov.uk, 99–109.&lt;/ref&gt; On 11 May 2011, as it was serializing Kate McCann's book, ''Madeleine'', ''The Sun''{{'}}s front page hosted an open letter from the McCanns in which they asked Prime Minister [[David Cameron]] to set up a new inquiry; 20,000 people signed the newspaper's petition that day.&lt;ref&gt;Summers and Swan 2014, 242–243; for the open letter: Andy Bloxham, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/madeleinemccann/8511093/Madeleine-McCann-text-of-parents-letter-to-David-Cameron.html "Madeleine McCann: text of parents' letter to David Cameron"], ''The Daily Telegraph'', 13 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; On the same day, according to her testimony to the Leveson Inquiry, Theresa May spoke by telephone, at her instigation, to [[Rebekah Brooks]], chief executive of News International, and [[Dominic Mohan]], editor of ''The Sun''.&lt;ref name=May29May2012p97-98/&gt; The next day she wrote to the [[Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis|commissioner of the Metropolitan Police]], Sir [[Paul Stephenson (police officer)|Paul Stephenson]], to say that the Portuguese police had agreed to cooperate with a British inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;Summers and Swan 2014, 244.&lt;/ref&gt; Within 24 hours, Cameron made the announcement about Operation Grange, to be financed by a Home Office contingency fund.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Bilton, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwx3zDb7u3U "Madeleine: The Last Hope?"], BBC Panorama, 25 April 2012, from 00:20:10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Operation Grange was led by Commander Simon Foy. Detective Chief Inspector (DCI) Andy Redwood of Scotland Yard's [[Homicide and Serious Crime Command]] was the first senior investigating officer, reporting to Detective Chief Superintendent Hamish Campbell.&lt;ref name=OperationGrange/&gt; The team consisted of three detective inspectors, five detective sergeants, 19 detective constables, and around six civilian staff.&lt;ref&gt;Andy Redwood, "Madeleine: The Last Hope?", BBC Panorama, 25 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; When Redwood retired in 2014, he was replaced by DCI Nicola Wall.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Evans, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/madeleinemccann/11275266/Detective-leading-hunt-for-Madeleine-McCann-steps-down.html "Detective leading hunt for Madeleine McCann steps down"], ''The Daily Telegraph'', 5 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; By July 2013 the review had become an investigation.&lt;ref&gt;Summers and Swan 2014, 253; [https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-mccann-police-idUKBRE9630IK20130705 "British police launch inquiry into missing Madeleine McCann"], Reuters, 5 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The team had tens of thousands of documents translated, released an age-progressed image,&lt;ref name=Telegraph25April2012&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/madeleinemccann/9225661/Madeleine-McCann-could-be-alive-say-detectives-as-new-image-released.html "Madeleine McCann 'could be alive' say detectives as new image released"], ''The Daily Telegraph'' 25 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; and investigated over 8,000 potential sightings. By 2015 they had taken 1,338 statements, collected 1,027 exhibits, and investigated 650 sex offenders and 60 persons of interest. The inquiry was scaled back in October 2015 and the number of officers reduced to four.&lt;ref name=Elgot28Oct2015&gt;Jessica Elgot, [https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/oct/28/met-reduces-officers-madeleine-mccann-case-29-to-four "Madeleine McCann: Met reduces officers on case from 29 to four"], ''The Guardian'', 28 October 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2016 the Home Secretary approved additional funding of £95,000 for what the [[Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis|Metropolitan Police Commissioner]], Sir [[Bernard Hogan-Howe]], said was one remaining line of inquiry;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/08/24/madeleine-mccann-detectives-may-apply-for-more-home-office-fundi/ "Madeleine McCann detectives may apply for more Home Office funding for 'outstanding work'"], ''The Daily Telegraph'', 24 August 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; another £85,000 in 2017 to cover up to September that year;&lt;ref name=PA12March2007&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/03/12/police-given-funds-extend-madeline-mccann-probe-another-six/ "Police given funds to extend Madeline McCann probe for another six months"], Press Association, 12 March 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; and £150,000 in November 2018 to cover until 31 March 2019, taking the cost of the inquiry to £11.75 million.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-46196238 "Madeleine McCann investigation receives more funding"], BBC News, 13 November 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theories: Planned abduction, burglary, wandered off===
DCI Redwood made clear that Operation Grange was looking at a "criminal act by a stranger", most likely a planned abduction or a burglary that Madeleine had disturbed.&lt;ref name=Laville25April2012&gt;Sandra Laville, [https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/apr/25/madeleine-mccann-case-reopen-call "Madeleine McCann case should be reopened, says Met"], ''The Guardian'', 25 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; There had been a fourfold increase in local burglaries between January and May 2007, including two in the McCanns' block in the 17 days before the disappearance, during which intruders had entered through windows.&lt;ref name="Redwood 14 Oct, 2013 00:24:38"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Redwoodinterview15Oct2013/&gt;

In an interview in April 2017, just before the 10th anniversary of the disappearance, Scotland Yard's [[Assistant Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis|Assistant Commissioner]], [[Mark Rowley]], appeared to dismiss the "burglary gone wrong" hypothesis, while adding that it is "not entirely ruled out". Referring to the suspects who might have been involved in burglaries in the area, he said that police had "pretty much closed off that group of people". The remaining detectives were focusing on a small number of remaining inquiries that they believe are significant: "If we didn't think they were significant, we wouldn't be carrying on."&lt;ref name=Evans26April2017&gt;Martin Evans, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/04/25/madeleine-mccann-ten-years-police-still-pursuing-critical-leads/ "Madeleine McCann: Police pursuing 'critical' lead that 'may provide the answer'"], ''The Daily Telegraph'', 26 April 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Metstatement&gt;[http://news.met.police.uk/blog_posts/ac-mark-rowley-reflects-on-the-tenth-anniversary-of-the-disappearance-of-madeleine-mccann-56775 "AC Mark Rowley reflects on the tenth anniversary of the disappearance of Madeleine McCann"], Metropolitan Police.&lt;/ref&gt; Also that month there were claims that Scotland Yard is looking for a woman who was seen near 5A at the time of the disappearance.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/04/30/madeleine-mccann-suspect-female-police-hunt-woman-spotted-close/ "Madeleine McCann suspect 'is female': Police hunt woman spotted close to disappearance in 'hugely significant line of inquiry'"], ''The Daily Telegraph'', 30 April 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

Redwood said in 2013 that the disappearance "on one reading of the evidence", did look like a pre-planned abduction: "That undoubtedly would have involved [[reconnaissance]]."&lt;ref name="Redwood 14 Oct, 2013 00:24:38"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Redwoodinterview15Oct2013/&gt; [[#Witness statements|Several witnesses described]] men hanging around near apartment 5A in the days before the disappearance and on the day itself.&lt;ref name="Redwood 14 Oct, 2013 00:24:38"&gt;DCI Andy Redwood, ''Crimewatch'', BBC, 14 October 2013, from [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ8jmdWlB8Y&amp;t=1489s&amp;t=24m38s 00:24:38–00:27:15] (discusses the men seen hanging around, the reconnaissance and abduction theory, and the recent fourfold increase in burglaries). For fourfold increase, also see Summers and Swann 2014, 255.&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2013 Scotland Yard wanted to trace 12 manual workers who were at the Ocean Club when Madeleine disappeared, including six British cleaners in a white van who were offering their services to British [[Expatriate|expats]].&lt;ref name=Davies17May2013&gt;Caroline Davies, [https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/may/17/madeleine-mccann-case-new-leads "Madeleine McCann case: Scotland Yard identifies new leads"], ''The Guardian'', 17 May 2013.{{pb}}

[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-24575059 "Madeleine McCann appeal: Police receive 2,400 calls and emails"], BBC News, 17 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Days after ''Crimewatch'' aired, Portugal's attorney general reopened the Portuguese inquiry, citing new evidence.&lt;ref name=BBC24Oct2013&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-24655826 "Madeleine McCann case: Portuguese police reopen inquiry"], BBC News, 24 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another theory is that Madeleine, nearly four at the time, left the apartment by herself, perhaps to look for her parents, and was abducted by a passer-by or fell into one of the open construction sites nearby.&lt;ref&gt;Collins 2008, 159.&lt;/ref&gt; This is widely regarded as unlikely. According to her mother, Madeleine would have had to open the unlocked patio doors, close the curtains behind her, close the door again, open and close the child gate at the top of the stairs, then open and close the gate leading to the street.&lt;ref&gt;Summers and Swan 2014, 260–261.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tracking mobile phone calls===
Using [[Mobile phone tracking|mobile-phone tracking techniques]], police were able to trace who had used cell phones near the scene of the disappearance within the important time frame. Tracking the calls apparently required the cooperation of over 30 countries.&lt;ref&gt;Summers and Swan 2014, 255.&lt;/ref&gt; The analysis turned up several telephone calls and texts between three men near the Ocean Club around the time of the disappearance: a 30-year-old former Ocean Club bus driver, and his 24-year-old and 53-year-old associates. Detectives interviewed them in June 2014; they denied any connection to the disappearance.&lt;ref name=Beer10December2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=PA29Jan2014/&gt;

Police also found that the cell phone of a former Ocean Club restaurant worker had been used near the resort that night. Originally from [[Cape Verde]], West Africa, Euclides Monteiro died in 2009 in a tractor accident after being fired from the Ocean Club in 2006 for theft. The suspicion was that he had been breaking into apartments to finance a drug habit. His widow said he had been questioned previously about break-ins involving the sexual assault of children, but had been cleared by DNA evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Summers and Swan 2015, 256; Fiona Govan, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/madeleinemccann/10415464/Madeleine-McCann-suspect-may-have-died-in-tractor-accident.html "Madeleine McCann suspect 'may have died in tractor accident'"], ''The Daily Telegraph'', 30 October 2013.{{pb}}

===Holiday-home sexual assaults===
Scotland Yard issued another appeal in March 2014 for information about a man who had entered holiday homes occupied by British families in four incidents in the western Algarve between 2004 and 2006, two of them in Praia da Luz. On those occasions he sexually assaulted five white girls, aged 7–10, in their beds. The man spoke English with a foreign accent and his speech was slow and perhaps slurred. He had short, dark, unkempt hair, tanned skin, and in the view of three victims a distinctive smell; he may have worn a long-sleeved burgundy top, perhaps with a white circle on the back. These were among 12 incidents in the area between 2004 and 2010.&lt;ref&gt;Summers and Swan 2014, 272–284; McCann 2011, 323–324.{{pb}}

===Searches and interviews in Praia da Luz===
In June 2014 Scotland Yard and the Polícia Judiciária, accompanied by archaeologists and sniffer dogs, searched drains and dug in 60,000 square metres of wasteland in Praia da Luz. Nothing was found.&lt;ref&gt;Josh Halliday and Brendan de Beer, [https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/jun/05/madeleine-mccann-police-fourth-day-praia-da-luz-scrubland "Madeleine McCann: police investigate sewerage system in Praia da Luz"], ''The Guardian'', 5 June 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The following month, at Scotland Yard's request, the Polícia Judiciária in Faro interviewed four Portuguese citizens, with Scotland Yard in attendance. No evidence was found to implicate them.&lt;ref name=Metstatement/&gt; One man, an associate of [[#Murat|Robert Murat]], was first questioned shortly after the disappearance.&lt;ref name=Beer1July2014&gt;Brendan de Beer, [https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/jul/01/madeleine-mccann-portuguese-police-question-suspects "Madeleine McCann case: Portuguese police question four suspects"], ''The Guardian'', 1 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brendan de Beer, Josh Halliday, [https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/jul/02/madeleine-mccann-detectives-finish-questioning-suspects "Madeleine McCann detectives finish questioning suspects"], ''The Guardian'', 2 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Pedro do Carmo, deputy director of the Polícia Judiciária, told the BBC in 2017 that the interviews had been conducted only because Scotland Yard requested them: "We never saw or looked at those people as suspects of the crime."&lt;ref&gt;Adam Lusher, [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/madeleine-mccann-disappearance-latest-what-happened-scenarios-a7716436.html "What happened to Madeleine McCann? Five possible scenarios explained"], ''The Independent'', 3 May 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

Eleven people, including three British, were interviewed in December. According to the Portuguese media, Scotland Yard compiled 253 questions, including "Did you kill Madeleine?" and "Where did you hide the body?"&lt;ref&gt;[http://portugalresident.com/madeleine-met-returns-to-algarve-to-grill-brits-with-%E2%80%9C253-questions%E2%80%9D "Madeleine: Met returns to Algarve to grill Brits with '253 questions'"], ''Portugal Resident'', 2 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Murat, his wife and her ex-husband were questioned, as were a 30-year-old former Ocean Club bus driver and his 24-year-old and 53-year-old associates.

===Other inquiries===
In the early days of the inquiry, the Portuguese police searched through images seized from paedophile investigations, and Madeleine's parents were shown photographs of sex offenders in case they recognized them from Praia de Luz.&lt;ref&gt;Summers and Swan 2014, 269, 272.&lt;/ref&gt; Several British paedophiles were of interest. In May 2009 investigators working for the McCanns tried to question one, Raymond Hewlett; he had allegedly told someone he knew what happened to Madeleine, but he retracted and died of cancer in Germany in December that year.&lt;ref&gt;Summers and Swan 2014, 275–278; Chris Irvine and Lucy Cockcroft, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/madeleinemccann/5366344/Madeleine-McCann-British-paedophile-Raymond-Hewlett-is-significant-new-suspect.html "Madeleine McCann: British paedophile Raymond Hewlett is 'significant new suspect'"], ''The Daily Telegraph'', 22 May 2009.{{pb}}

A man from Northern Ireland who died in 2013 was discussed in the media in connection with the disappearance; after being released from prison for the sexual assault of his four daughters, he had moved to [[Carvoeiro (Lagoa)|Carvoeiro]], Portugal, not far from Praia da Luz, and was there when Madeleine went missing.&lt;ref&gt;Summers and Swan 2014, 278–279.&lt;/ref&gt; Another focus of Operation Grange was [[Urs Hans von Aesch]], a deceased Swiss man implicated in the 2007 murder, in Switzerland, of five-year-old [[Urs Hans von Aesch|Ylenia Lenhard]].

The couple's status as photogenic, articulate and professional was at first beneficial and protective. A white, middle-class family caught up in a nightmare of evil abroad offered everything the media could latch onto, writes feminist scholar Nicola Rehling, and every institution in the UK wanted to help, from [[10 Downing Street]] down.&lt;ref&gt;Rehling 2012, [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;id=jBzHwqMfdegC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA153 153–154], 159–161; Machado and Prainsack 2012, 52.&lt;/ref&gt; The McCanns took full advantage of the interest by hiring public-relations consultants and offering regular events to give the media a daily news peg. But the frenzy soon turned against them, and there began what PR consultant [[Michael Cole (public relations)|Michael Cole]] called the "monstering of the McCanns".&lt;ref&gt;Michael Cole, interviewed for "Madeleine McCann: A Global Obsession", Channel 5 (UK), 18 November 2014, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=84zqo6jSprQ&amp;t=31m36s 00:31:36].&lt;/ref&gt; They were harshly criticized for having left their children alone, in an unlocked apartment, despite the availability of Ocean Club babysitters and a crèche. The argument ran that a working-class couple would have faced child-abandonment charges.&lt;ref&gt;Rehling 2012, [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;id=jBzHwqMfdegC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA159 159–161]; Deborah Orr, [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/feb/22/pistorius-case-empty-vessel-prejudices "Pistorius's case is an empty vessel into which all our prejudices may be poured"], ''The Guardian'', 22 February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Seventeen thousand people signed an online petition in June 2007 asking Leicestershire Social Services to investigate how the children came to be left unattended.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/leicestershire/6740315.stm "Petitioners want McCann inquiry"], BBC News, 12 June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kate McCann's appearance and demeanour were widely discussed, with much of the commentary coming from other women, including [[Booker Prize]]-winner [[Anne Enright]] in the ''[[London Review of Books]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Anne Enright, [https://www.lrb.co.uk/v29/n19/anne-enright/diary "Disliking the McCanns"], ''London Review of Books'', 29(19), 4 October 2007, 39; [[#Goc|Goc 2009]], 40.&lt;/ref&gt; Kate was deemed cold and controlled, too attractive, too thin, too well-dressed, too intense.{{sfn|Bainbridge|2012|loc=2, 6–7}} She had apparently been advised by abduction experts not to cry on camera because the kidnapper might enjoy her distress, and this led to more criticism: the Portuguese tabloid ''[[Correio da Manhã]]'' cited sources complaining that she had not "shed a single tear".&lt;ref&gt;For advice from abduction experts: Judy Bachrach, interviewed for "Madeleine McCann: A Global Obsession", Channel 5 (UK), 18 November 2014, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=84zqo6jSprQ&amp;t=15m5s 00:17:05].{{pb}}

Like Kate, she was suspected, in part, because she did not weep in public.&lt;ref&gt;Dominic Lawson, [https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/commentators/dominic-lawson/dominic-lawson-this-tidal-wave-of-emotional-tyranny-401999.html "Dominic Lawson: This tidal wave of emotional tyranny"], ''The Independent'', 10 September 2007.{{pb}}

Chamberlain asked: "How can you apologise to me and do this again to someone else?"{{sfn|Goc|2009|loc=39, 41}}

===Libel actions===
In addition to the McCanns' legal efforts against [[#Amaral|Gonçalo Amaral]] and his publisher, the McCanns and Tapas Seven brought libel actions against several newspapers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24431">The term '''Flüchtlingspolitik''', refers to the legal provisions and the handling of [[refugees]] and [[asylum seekers]] wanting to enter a country, and/or subsequently staying there for a long period of time. (In this case Germany and its predecessor states)

== 18th century and earlier ==

According to the principle of ''[[Cuius regio, eius religio]]'' ("whose realm, his religion"), the first type of religious refugee was established in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] at the [[Augsburg Settlement]]. These refugees were members of an "incorrect" [[Religious denomination|denomination]] and therefore fled to a state which was led by a sovereign ruler who shared their beliefs. [[Cologne]], for example, was a shelter for Catholics as well as for important church officials during the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618-1648).

The [[Margraviate of Brandenburg]] lost half of its inhabitants during that war; the [[Uckermark]] lost even more, 90%. To balance this loss, the country became reliant on immigration. After assessing the state of the economy, craftsmen and skilled agricultural workers were hired. People who were forced to leave their home land for religious reasons were also taken in. Because of the [[Edict of Potsdam]], Brandenburg took in [[Huguenots]] who were expelled from France. Later territories, which were ruled by relatives of the Prussian king, also took them in: e.g. from the Markgraviate of [[Brandenburg-Ansbach]]. The majority of the [[Lutherans]] from [[Salzburg]] settled in the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] in 1731-32; other Lutherans and Protestants fled from [[Bohemia]] to the newly founded colony of Nowawes (Potsdam-Babelsberg) in 1750.

Before the 1782 [[Edict of Tolerance]], religious refugees from the [[Habsburg Empire]] moved to other Protestant areas in the Holy Roman Empire. During the [[French Revolution]], members of the [[Counter-revolutionary|French Counter-Revolution]] fled to German-speaking territories. The first wave of emigration took place after the events of July and August 1789. In summer 1789 it was mainly the [[high nobility]], especially the King's relatives, and members of the [[Clergy|higher clergy]] and the military leadership, who emigrated. Due to the abolition of the [[feudal system]] and the revocation of the [[Civil Constitution of the Clergy]], there was a second wave of emigrants in the summer of 1790. Again, this consisted mainly of the nobility, the clergy and military officers. The third wave of emigration started shortly after 21 June 1791, when [[King Louis XIV]] tried to escape to [[Varennes]].

The second main phase of emigration took place after the [[September massacres]] in 1792 and the increasing radicalization of the revolution after the King's execution in 1793. More and more members of the [[Third Estate]] were now emigrating. Among them were many former supporters of the revolution, including [[Girondist]]s, who had by then broken away from the new leadership in Paris, or had been victims of political prosecution. There were smaller waves of emigration after the end of the [[Reign of Terror]], caused by the [[royalist]] uprising on October 5 in Paris. The uprising was defeated by [[Napoleon]] and his troops and prompted the [[Coup of 18 Fructidor]] (4 September 1797).

== Empire and Weimar Republic ==

During the [[German Empire]] and the [[Weimar Republic]], Germany was one of the countries most sought after by Jews who were fleeing violence and [[discrimination]] in eastern, central and south-eastern Europe. The first big wave of Jewish refugees to Germany from the east reached was a result of the [[Russian Revolution]] and Counter Revolution in 1904-05. During the [[First World War]] which turned Poland into a war zone, there was a second big wave of Jewish immigrants from the East. Due to the [[Axis powers]]' blockade, this wave settled mainly in Central Europe, Germany and Austria. "Hundreds of thousands of Polish Jews fled to Vienna and Berlin: children of foreign culture, speaking a foreign language, upholding foreign customs and beliefs." These were mostly forced to come as refugees with nothing to their name, and just tried to scrape a living in any possible way. There are no indications of any correlation between Jews from Eastern Europe and an increased crime rate. The historian Anne-Christin Saß discovered that in the second half of the 1920s in Berlin, Jews were prevented from continuing to move further west in Europe or even as far as the USA, as they had riginally intended; thus Berlin developed into a world Jewish center. This change not only intensified [[antisemitic]] resentment by the right wing supporters, but also triggered defensive reactions of fully integrated, sometimes even completely [[Cultural assimilation|assimilated]], "Jews from the West".

== Fled and banished Germans and "Displaced Persons" 1945-1949 ==

According to a population census in 1950, around 12.5 million refugees and exiles from the eastern territories formerly occupied by the [[Nazi regime]] fled after the end of the [[Second World War]], to the Allied{{Fix|text=excluding Russia?}} occupation zones of Germany and Berlin. 3 million refugees came to Germany from [[Czechoslovakia]], 1.4 million from Poland, roughly 300,000 from the former Free City of [[Gdansk]] (Danzig), 300,000 from Yugoslavia, 200,000 from Hungary and 130,000 from Romania.  Long term residents, especially in villages, often refused to take in these refugees. In August 1952, the Equalization of Burdens Act was passed to compensate the refugees for monetary and job losses. The legal status of refugees and late resettlers is regulated by the Federal Law of Refugees and Exiles (German: short form: ''Bundesvertriebenengesetz'', BVFG; in full, ''Gesetz über die Angelegenheiten der Vertriebenen und Flüchtlinge''; literally: Law on the affairs of the expellees and refugees) inured{{clarify|date=July 2016}} on June 5, 1953.&lt;/span&gt;

[[File:Displaced Persons and Refugees in Germany BU6643.jpg|thumb|left|Displaced Persons and Refugees in Germany]]
The so-called [[Displaced person]]s (DP) played a key role in the history of the German refugee policy post-1945. Most of them were deported to Germany, mainly as forced laborers, during the Second World War. Freed prisoners of war, Eastern Europeans who came to Germany voluntarily after the start of the war and people who had fled from the [[Soviet Army]] were considered within a broad definition of DPs.&lt;ref&gt;Vom Zwangsarbeiter zur Displaced Person. Geschichts@tlas Niedersachsen&lt;/ref&gt; DPs were supposed, and also mostly wanted, to be [[repatriated]] into their country of origin. Citizens of the Soviet Union were however repatriated against their will. Polish and Baltic people, as well as the forced laborers from the areas in [[Belarus]] and Ukraine who had lived on Polish national territory before the war, had the choice either to go back to their homeland, to emigrate to another country or to stay in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Stiftung "Erinnerung Verantwortung Zukunft": Nach dem Dritten Reich: Displaced Persos und "Repatriierte".&lt;/ref&gt; All over [[Eastern Europe]], [[Stalinist]] [[dictatorships]] were established; that is why many of the Displaced Persons", especially those who were suspected of having collaborated with the Nazi occupiers, would not leave Germany: they feared severe penalties in their country of origin. For instance, the former Latvian general Rudolfs Bangerskis, who later became a general of the [[Waffen-SS]], died in 1958 in exile in [[Oldenburg]]. Displaced Persons are called "homeless foreigners" in German federal law, and their legal position, based on the "Law on the Legal Status of Aliens in the federal territory" of 25 April 1951,&lt;ref&gt;Bundesministeriums der Justiz und für Verbraucherschutz / juris GmbH: Gesetz über die Rechtsstellung heimatloser Ausländer im Bundesgebiet&lt;/ref&gt; is similar to the legal position of people with refugee status.

Between 1945 and 1949, a [[housing estate]] for roughly 5000 Displaced Persons from Ukraine&lt;ref&gt;Eine kleine Ukraine in Regensburg. In: Slavische Spuren (Hrsg.: Europaeum. Ost-West-Zentrum der Universität Regensburg). 2014. S. 19–29&lt;/ref&gt; was built, under the initiative of the Americans,"in the "Ganghofersiedlung" in [[Regensburg]] (the former "Göring-Heim" (lit. Göring-asylum) of the Nazis). Similar estates were also then built elsewhere in Germany. There was hardly any contact with Germans outside the camps or estates except for fairly superficial ones. In 1950, the ''[[Rheinische Post]]'' commented on the resolution of a "Polenlager" (Poles' camp)  in [[Solingen]] which had been occupied by "DPs", remarking that "the Polish economy" would finally be over; they then remarked that "German cleanliness would soon rule again in the spoiled area""instead of the "post-war [[eyesore]]".&lt;ref&gt;Behandelt wie ein drittklassiges Pack. In: Der Spiegel. Ausgabe 32/1983. 8. August 1983&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the DPs from Ukraine were unpopular in many places because they were considered privileged in contrast to the hardships Germany was facing. In addition, some were former [[Nazi collaborators]] and formed gangs of petty criminals, controlling the black market, which was important for the supply of the population at that time.&lt;ref&gt;Eine kleine Ukraine in Regensburg.

== Refugees from the GDR (East Germany) in the Federal Republic of Germany ==
More than 3.8 million people left the [[GDR]], many of them illegally and at high risk, between 7 October 1949 and June 1990; from its foundation until reunification. This figure includes 480,000 citizens of the GDR who left the country legally from 1962. About 400,000 eventually returned to the GDR over time.&lt;ref&gt;Bettina Effner, Helge Heidemeyer (Hrsg.): Flucht im geteilten Deutschland. Erinnerungsstätte Notaufnahmelager Marienfelde, be.bra verlag, Berlin 2005, S. 27f.&lt;/ref&gt; The policy of the [[Federal Government]] maintained a marked "welcoming culture" towards refugees from the GDR.&lt;ref&gt;Tilman Wickert: Sammelrezension: Flüchtlinge und Flüchtlingspolitik im Kalten Krieg.

== Foreign refugees in the Federal Republic of Germany 1949-1990 ==

Based on the experiences of German emigrants, who, on the run from the Nazis, became dependent on a country that had taken them in as refugees, a new article (article 16) was added to the Federal Republic's [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|Basic Law]] (''Grundgesetz'') in 1948-49 with the following succinct text: "Politically persecuted persons have the right of asylum." With this, the [[Federal Republic of Germany]] is obliged to grant a right of [[Home|residence]] to the [[Political persecution|politically persecuted]].

The second legal basis for the asylum policy of the Federal Republic of Germany is the Geneva Convention (officially called the [[Convention relating to the Status of Refugees]]) which was adopted in 1951 and came into force in 1954. This sets out globally applicable minimum standards for the treatment of refugees. The group of people are covered by this Convention are called "Convention refugees".

On average almost 8,600 asylum applications per year had been made between 1953 and 1979; the average number of applications climbed to more than 70,000 between 1980 and 1990.&lt;ref&gt;Lilli Sippel / Reiner Klinholz: [Asylbewerber in der BRD]. Berlin-Institut für Bevölkerung und Entwicklung. April 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The main reason for the increase in numbers of asylum seekers was the [[Turkish military coup, 1980|military coup in Turkey]] in 1980. It led to an influx of thousands of Turks and especially [[Kurds]] fleeing to the Federal Republic of Germany.

In retrospect, a target of criticism was that the Federal Republic of Germany had only two mechanisms for immigration by non-Germans from countries outside the [[European Union]], due to the recruitment of [[migrant workers]] in 1973 and the lack of an [[immigration law]]: family reunification and the assertion of the [[basic right]] to asylum. The "bottleneck" of asylum was very early "pried{{clarify|date=July 2016}} forcefully from the outside and tightened again and again from the inside in a public defensive struggle, which created the bogeyman of the so-called 'refugee'".&lt;ref&gt;Klaus J. Bade / Jochen Oltmer: Normalfall Migration: Texte zur Einwandererbevölkerung und neue Zuwanderung im vereinigten Deutschland seit 1990. Bundeszentrale für Politische Bildung. 2004.

[[File:Iron Curtain Final.svg|thumb|Iron Curtain Final|This is the Iron Curtain from the late 1950s up to the late 1980s. Created by Vernes Seferovic.]]
During the [[Cold War]] hundreds of thousands of people fled from the countries of Central and Eastern Europe through the "[[Iron curtain]]" to the west. In particular, after the crushing of the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Hungarian Uprising of 1956]], the violent termination of the "[[Prague Spring]]" in Czechoslovakia in 1968, and the [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] (Solidarność) movement in Poland, politically motivated asylum seeking was again a mass phenomenon. The refugees were granted asylum, most notably in the member countries of the [[NATO|NATO Pact]], particularly in the Federal Republic of Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Nils Löffelbein: Politisches Asyl im Kalten Krieg. Die tschechoslowakische Emigration nach 1968. Goethe-Universität Frankfurt/Main&lt;/ref&gt;

Paradoxically, only after the opening of the western borders of the [[Warsaw Pact]] states, migrants from these now post-communist states represented the majority of asylum seekers in Germany. In 1986 about 74.8% of the asylum seekers were still coming from the "third world"; but in 1993, 72.1% came from Europe, and especially from eastern, central and south-eastern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Klaus J. Bade / Jochen Oltmer: Flucht und Asyl seit 1990. Bundeszentrale für politische Bildung. 15. März 2005&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of 1978, the Federal Republic of Germany decided to take in South Vietnamese refugees in large numbers. This was preceded by an intensive media coverage of the plight of the so-called [[Vietnamese boat people|"boat people"]]. In order to spare the 40,000 affected Vietnamese, who had been received by the Federal Republic of Germany, from the long procedure of applying for asylum, the category of "humanitarian refugees" was created.&lt;ref&gt;Julia Kleinschmidt: Die Aufnahme der ersten "boat people" in die Bundesrepublik. Bundeszentrale für politische Bildung. 26. November 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

== Refugees taken in from the German Democratic Republic ==
In the years of Germany's division, politically persecuted figures fled from [[Greece]], [[Chile]], [[Angola]], [[Mozambique]], [[El Salvador]] and [[Nicaragua]] to the GDR. However, there they had very little contact with the German population in everyday life, as they hardly lived with them, being housed instead in special [[dormitories]]. Until 1962, the GDR took in over 200 [[Desertion|deserters]] from [[NATO]] forces: primarily [[US soldiers]].&lt;ref&gt;Peter Köpf: Wo ist Lieutenant Adkins?. Ch. Links Verlag. Berlin 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

== Refugee Policy ==
In the 1990s, following the resolution of the east-west conflict, there were many crises and wars throughout Europe and the world. For example, there was a war in the former [[Yugoslavia]], and a border dispute between [[Ethiopia]] and [[Eritrea]], as well as between [[Mali]] and [[Burkina Faso]]. In [[Burundi]] there was a civil war, as well as in the [[Republic of Congo]], [[Senegal]] and [[Zimbabwe]]. By 1992, the number of refugees had risen to 440,000. As a consequence, there was a wave of [[Arson|arson attacks]] on the homes of the foreigners (in Hoyerswerda, Rostock-Lichtenhagen, Mölln and Solingen). Voters became more willing to accept extreme-right [[political parties]]. As a reaction to this crisis, asylum policy in Germany was established with the introduction into the ''Grundgesetz'' of articles tackling this problem. Clause 16a was changed: a person coming from a "safe country of origin" or a "safe third country" can no longer claim [[political asylum]] on account of feeling in danger. In 1993, the law to give benefits for asylum seekers was introduced. It stated, amongst other things, that foreigners who from the start have been dependent on government aid, were to receive a lower amount than Germans and any others of equal status. The amount fell by almost 40%, to a smaller amount than the [[unemployment benefit]] (Arbeitslosengeld II LINK). In 1997 the [[Dublin convention]] was concluded, through which the German refugee policy was secured according to the [[European Community Law]]. Since then, in Germany's neighbouring countries, more specifically known as "safe third countries", the expected{{clarify|date=July 2016}} number of asylum seekers sank steadily, from roughly 320,000 in 1993 to 28,018 in 2008. It was decided that asylum seekers would only have the chance of a favourable decision if they arrive by air. As a part of the "Asylum Compromise", transient asylum seekers, who have landed in Germany and are still within the transit area, will be subject to accelerated asylum procedures. According to the rules, the decision on their application must be made within 2 days; the objection period is only 3 days. This means that the number of cases is kept low, which through the directive "2001/51 / EU, airlines", members of third countries (such as citizens of countries who are not members of the EU) allow{{clarify|date=July 2016}} entry into an EU country without a valid travel document, must pay a [[Fine (penalty)|fine]]. This fine, since 2001, in Europe is as high as between 3,000 and 5,000 euros per passenger travelling illegally.

== Jewish migration since 1990 ==

After 1990, a contingent of Jewish refugees came from the former Soviet Union to Germany, hoping to achieve a more developed [[quality of life]], where the Jewish population at the back of the national socialism regime was to be (almost) repented.{{clarify|date=July 2016}}

== Yugoslavian War (1991-1999) ==

In the wake of the [[Yugoslavian war]], by 1995, Germany had received 350,000 refugees from the warring states. This figure encompasses 48% of the total number of migrants, that left the former Yugoslavia, who went to Germany. With a few cases of hardship{{clarify|date=July 2016}}, most of them returned to their homeland in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.efms.uni-bamberg.de/ds27_2_d.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

== Asylum policy in the refugee crisis ==

Starting from 2015, the unexpected entry of more than a million refugees and migrants has caused a refugee crisis in Germany.

In September 2015, the authorities found it more and more difficult to house the huge number of refugees and in particular concerned{{clarify|date=July 2016}} the states' registration facilities (LEA). These were shelters where the refugees were housed after they were picked up from a train station by the [[federal police]]. In order to meet the needs at least partly, the responsible [[Regional municipality|regional councils]] of the states opened provisional shelters in many locations: demand-oriented registration facilities (BEA). The numbers of people living in the LEAs and the BEAs varied daily and they were accommodated in these registration facilities for a maximum of three months. For example, the LEA in [[Karlsruhe]], which had a capacity of 1000, took in 3500 people.&lt;ref&gt;Kapazitäten der BEAs und LEAs fast schon erschöpft. In: Badische Zeitung–Online, 7. September 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Herkunftsländer Asyl 2015.png|thumb|center|upright=2.5|Countries applying for asylum in Germany in 2015]] 
It proved to be difficult to register newcomers quickly, and furthermore to quickly separate the refugees who had to be sheltered because of the [[Geneva Convention]] on Refugees, from those migrants who are not legally entitled to stay in Germany. Locating the illegal entrants as well as the fast [[deportation]] of those who did not have the right of residence also proved to be difficult. Above all, this situation led to a controversial, nationwide debate over the German refugee policy. 
On February 17, 2016, shortly before the EU summit in [[Brussels]] on February 18–19, the [[Chancellor of Germany (1949–)|Federal Chancellor]] said in her government declaration that she would advocate a European-Turkish solution to the refugee crisis. The goal was to "noticeably and sustainably reduce the number of refugees, thus furthermore helping the people, who really need our protection". This goal was to be achieved by controlling the causes of movement, protecting the external borders of the EU, particularly the border between Greece and Turkey, and arranging an organized and controlled inward flow of the refugees. The arrivals on the Austrian-German border have since then been registered and controlled. A consistent refugee identification is being gradually introduced.&lt;ref&gt;Regierungserklärung der Kanzlerin. Europäischen Weg weitergehen. In: Internetangebot der Bundesregierung, 17. Februar 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 2015 a legislative package with essential amendments (''Asylpaket I'') were passed into law.&lt;ref&gt;Asylpaket I: Asylrechtliche Änderungen seit dem 23.10.2015 in Kraft. In: Pro Asyl – Online am 17.

In: Spiegel Online, 3. Februar 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; This includes the introduction of particular registration facilities (BAE) for certain refugee groups, provided that their asylum requests are accepted within three weeks, including provision for possible appeal against the decision of [[Federal Ministry of the Interior (Germany)|BAMF]] (Federal Office for Migration and Refugees in Germany) in court.&lt;ref&gt;Das Asylpaket II – Menschenrechte in Gefahr. In: Amnesty International–Online; retrieved, 21 February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The law was due to be enacted by the German government at the end of February.&lt;ref&gt;Asylpaket II auf dem Weg.

== European refugee and asylum policy ==

From the outlook of 2008, the [[Federal Agency for Civic Education]] divided the history of migration and asylum policy of the [[European Communities]], and later that of the European Union, in three phases:

# 1957–1990: coordinated policy of the member states
# 1990–1999: intergovernmental cooperation
# 1999– ({{as of|2008|lc=y}}): migration policy as a genuine common task&lt;ref&gt;Petra Bendel / Marianne Haase: Wann war das? Geschichte der europäischen Migrationspolitik bis heute. Bundeszentrale für politische Bildung. 29. Januar 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Francis Tresham''' ({{circa}} 1567 – 23 December 1605), eldest son of 
[[Thomas Tresham (died 1605)|Thomas Tresham]] and Merial Throckmorton, was a member of the group of English provincial [[Catholic Church|Catholics]] who planned the failed [[Gunpowder Plot]] of 1605, a conspiracy to assassinate King [[James VI and I|James I of England]].

Tresham joined the [[Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex|Earl of Essex]]'s failed rebellion against the government in 1601, for which he was imprisoned.  Only his family's intervention and his father's money saved him from [[attainder]].  Despite this, he became involved in two missions to Catholic Spain to seek support for English Catholics (then heavily persecuted), and finally with the Gunpowder Plotters.

According to his confession, Tresham joined the plot in October 1605.  Its leader, [[Robert Catesby]], asked him to provide a large sum of money and the use of [[Rushton Hall]], but Tresham apparently provided neither, instead giving a much smaller amount of money to fellow plotter [[Thomas Wintour]].  Tresham also expressed concern that if the plot was successful, two of his brothers-in-law would be killed.  An anonymous letter delivered to one of them, [[William Parker, 4th Baron Monteagle]], found its way to the [[Secretary of State (England)|English Secretary of State]], [[Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury|Robert Cecil]], an event which eventually proved decisive in the conspiracy's failure.

Historians have long suspected that Tresham wrote the letter, a hypothesis that remains unproven.  Catesby and Wintour shared the same suspicion and threatened to kill him, but he was able to convince them otherwise.  He was arrested on 12&amp;nbsp;November and confined to the [[Tower of London]].  In his confession, he sought to allay his involvement in the plot, but never mentioned the letter.  He died of natural causes on 23&amp;nbsp;December 1605.

==Family and life before 1605==
Born in about 1567, Francis Tresham was the eldest son of Sir [[Thomas Tresham (died 1605)|Thomas Tresham]], of [[Rushton Hall]] in [[Northamptonshire]], and Meriel Throckmorton, daughter of Sir [[Robert Throckmorton]] of Coughton in [[Warwickshire]].&lt;ref name="ODNB Tresham"&gt;{{Citation |last=Nicholls |first=Mark |contribution=Tresham, Francis (1567?–1605) |title=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography |publisher=Oxford University Press, hosted at oxforddnb.com |year=2004 |url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/27708 |accessdate=16 November 2009 |doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/27708}}{{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the [[antiquary]] [[Anthony Wood (antiquary)|Anthony Wood]], Tresham was educated in [[Oxford]] at either [[St John's College, Oxford|St John's College]] or [[Worcester College, Oxford|Gloucester Hall]] or both,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wood|1813|pp=754–755}}&lt;/ref&gt; although biographer Mark Nicholls mentions that there appears to be no other evidence to corroborate that claim.&lt;ref name="ODNB Tresham"/&gt;  He married Anne Tufton, daughter of Sir John Tufton of Hothfield in Kent, in 1593.  The couple had three children, twins Lucy and Thomas (b.1598), and Elizabeth.  Thomas died in infancy, Lucy became a nun in Brussels, and Elizabeth married Sir George Heneage of Hainton, Lincolnshire.&lt;ref name="ODNB Tresham"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fraserp168"&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|p=168}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tresham's father, born near the end of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]'s reign, was regarded by the Catholic community as one of its leaders.&lt;ref name="Fraserpxxviii"&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|p=xxviii}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thomas was received into the Catholic Church in 1580, and in the same year he allowed the Jesuit [[Edmund Campion]] to stay at his house in [[Hoxton]].  For the latter, following Campion's capture in 1581, he was tried in [[Star Chamber]].  Thomas's refusal to fully comply with his interrogators was the beginning of years of fines and spells in prison.  He proclaimed the accession of [[James VI and I|James I]] to the English throne, but the king's promises to Thomas of forestry commissions and an end to [[recusancy]] fines were not kept.  His finances were seriously depleted by fines of £7,720 for recusancy, and the spending of £12,200 on the marriages of six daughters meant that when he died in 1605, his estate was £11,500 in debt.&lt;ref name="Fraserpxxviii"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Lock | first = Julian | contribution = Tresham, Sir Thomas (1543–1605) | title = Oxford Dictionary of National Biography | publisher = Oxford University Press, hosted at oxforddnb.com | origyear = 2004 | year = 2009 | url = http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/27712 | accessdate = 1 October 2010 | doi = 10.1093/ref:odnb/27712}}{{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Author [[Antonia Fraser]] suggests that as a young man Francis became "resentful of his father's authority and profligate with his father's money."&lt;ref name="Fraserp80"&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|p=80}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Authors Peter Marshall and Geoffrey Scott describe him as possessing a "somewhat hot-headed nature",&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Marshall|Scott|2009|p=87}}&lt;/ref&gt; while another source calls him a "wild unstayed man".&lt;ref name="Haynesp80"&gt;{{Harvnb|Haynes|2005|p=80}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Haynes does not cite the source, presumably its an old text --&gt;  The Jesuit priest [[Oswald Tesimond]] wrote that he was "a man of sound judgement.  He knew how to look after himself, but was not much to be trusted".&lt;ref name="ODNB Tresham"/&gt;  While still young he assaulted a man and his pregnant daughter, claiming that their family owed his father money.  Tresham spent time in prison for this offence.&lt;ref name="Fraserp80"/&gt;

On 8&amp;nbsp;February 1601 he joined the [[Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex|Earl of Essex]] in open rebellion against the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|p=xxix}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Essex's aim was to secure his own ambitions, but the Jesuit [[Henry Garnet]] described the young men who accompanied him as being interested mostly in furthering the Catholic cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|pp=58–59}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Captured and imprisoned, Tresham appealed to [[Thomas Howard, 1st Earl of Suffolk|Katherine Howard]], but was rebuked.  His sister, Lady Mounteagle, alerted his cousin John Throckmorton, who turned to "three most honorable parsons and one especiall instrument" for help.&lt;ref name="marshall87" /&gt;  The identity of these individuals is unclear, but Tresham was promised freedom on the condition that over the next three months his father pay £2,100 to William Ayloffe, to "save his lyef attainder in bloode."&lt;ref name="marshall87"&gt;{{Harvnb|Marshall|Scott|2009|pp=87–88}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was released on 21&amp;nbsp;June.  The experience did not dissuade him from engaging in further conspiracies; in 1602 and 1603 he was involved in the missions to Catholic Spain made by [[Thomas Wintour]], Anthony Dutton (possibly an alias of [[John and Christopher Wright|Christopher Wright]])&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Nicholls | first = Mark | contribution = Wright, John (bap. 1568, d. 1605) | url = http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/30036/30028 | title = Oxford Dictionary of National Biography | publisher = Oxford University Press, hosted at oxforddnb.com | origyear = 2004 | year = 2008 | accessdate = 16 July 2010 | doi = 10.1093/ref:odnb/30028}}{{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Guy Fawkes]], later dubbed by the English government as the Spanish Treason.&lt;ref name="ODNB Tresham"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|p=61}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, upon James's accession to the throne, he told Thomas Wintour (secretary to Tresham's brother-in-law [[William Parker, 4th Baron Monteagle]]), that he would "stand wholly for the King", and "to have no speech with him of Spain."&lt;ref name="Fraserp168"/&gt;

==Introduction==
[[File:Rushton Hall 01.jpg|right|thumb|Rushton Hall]]
English Catholics had hoped that the persecution of their faith would end when James succeeded [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]], as he appeared to hold more moderate views toward Catholics than his predecessor.  But [[Robert Catesby]], a religious zealot also imprisoned for his involvement in the Essex rebellion, had grown tired of James's supposed perfidy and planned to kill the king.  He hoped to achieve this by blowing up the [[Palace of Westminster#Old Palace|House of Lords]] with gunpowder and inciting a popular revolt to install James's daughter [[Elizabeth Stuart, Queen of Bohemia|Princess Elizabeth]] as titular Queen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|pp=41–42}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Haynes | first = Alan | title = The Enduring Memory of the Gunpowder Plot | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/civil_war_revolution/gunpowder_haynes_01.shtml | publisher = bbc.co.uk | date = 5 November 2009 | accessdate = 14 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|p=140}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Catesby had recruited 11&amp;nbsp;fellow Catholics to his cause but was running out of money.  Even with his debts, with an annual income of over £3,000&lt;ref name="ODNB Tresham"/&gt; Tresham was one of the wealthiest people known to the plotters,&lt;ref name="Haynesp80"/&gt; and Catesby's mother was Anne Throckmorton, an aunt of Tresham's.  The two cousins had been raised together and shared a close relationship.&lt;ref name="Fraserpp110111"&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|pp=110–111}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|In the opinion of author [[Antonia Fraser]], this closeness, and Catesby's domineering of his older cousin, proved crucial to Tresham joining the conspiracy.&lt;ref name="Fraserpp110111"/&gt;|group="nb"}}

Despite their shared upbringing and involvement in the Spanish Treason, the conspirators chose not to reveal the plot to him until 14&amp;nbsp;October 1605, shortly after his father died, and just weeks before the planned explosion.&lt;ref name="ODNB Tresham"/&gt;  According to his confession, the meeting took place at the home of Tresham's brother-in-law, Lord Stourton, in [[Clerkenwell]].  Tresham claimed to have questioned Catesby on the morality of the plot, asking if it was spiritually "damnable".  Catesby replied that it was not, at which point Tresham highlighted the danger that all Catholics would face should the plot succeed.  Catesby replied, "The necessity of the Catholics" was such that "it must needs be done".&lt;ref name="fraser167" /&gt;  He wanted two things from Tresham: £2,000, and the use of [[Rushton Hall]]; Catesby received neither.  Tresham had no money to spare, his father's debts having reduced his inheritance,&lt;ref name="fraser167"&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|pp=167–168}}&lt;/ref&gt; although he paid a small sum{{refn|The sources used differ on the exact amount.  Nicholls' claims it was "more than £190", while Fraser claims it was £100.|group="nb"}} to Thomas Wintour, on the understanding that the latter was to travel to the [[Low Countries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|p=174}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Following the meeting, he hurried back to Rushton Hall and closed his household, taking care to hide family papers (not discovered until 1838).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Haynes|2005|pp=81–82}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He then returned to London with his mother and sisters,&lt;ref name="Fraserpp173175"&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|pp=173–175}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on 2&amp;nbsp;November acquired a licence to travel abroad with his servants and horses.&lt;ref name="ODNB Tresham"/&gt;

==Monteagle letter==
[[File:Monteagle letter.jpeg|thumb|alt=A damaged and aged piece of paper, or parchment, with multiple lines of handwritten English text.|An anonymous letter sent to William Parker, {{nowrap|4th Baron Monteagle}}, was instrumental in revealing the existence of the plot.  The identity of its author has never been reliably established.]]

Later in October, during a meeting at which Tresham was present, the conspirators discussed the fates of several notable Catholic peers.  Foremost in Tresham's thoughts were the lives of two brothers-in-law, [[William Parker, 4th Baron Monteagle]], and [[Edward Stourton, 10th Baron Stourton]], but Catesby proclaimed that "the innocent must perish with the guilty, sooner than ruin the chances of success."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Haynes|2005|p=82}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As the last few details were being finalised that month,&lt;ref name="Fraser 1999 178–179"&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|pp=178–179}}&lt;/ref&gt; on Saturday 26&amp;nbsp;October Monteagle received an anonymous letter while at his house in [[Hoxton]].  It contained the following message:

{{quote|My Lord, out of the love I bear to some of your friends, I have a care of your preservation. Therefore I would advise you, as you tender your life, to devise some excuse to shift your attendance at this parliament; for God and man hath concurred to punish the wickedness of this time.  And think not slightly of this advertisement, but retire yourself into your country where you may expect the event in safety.  For though there be no appearance of any stir, yet I say they shall receive a terrible blow this Parliament; and yet they shall not see who hurts them.  This counsel is not to be condemned because it may do you good and can do you no harm; for the danger is passed as soon as you have burnt the letter.  And I hope God will give you the grace to make good use of it, to whose holy protection I commend you.&lt;ref name="Fraser 1999 178–179"/&gt;}}

Uncertain of its meaning, Monteagle delivered it to the [[Secretary of State (England)|English Secretary of State]], [[Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury|Robert Cecil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Haynes|2005|p=89}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tresham has long been suspected as the letter's author. Mark Nicholls states that he almost certainly wrote it, pointing to the fact that once Catesby was made aware of its existence he immediately suspected Tresham and went with Thomas Wintour to confront him.&lt;ref name="ODNB Tresham"/&gt;  The two threatened to "hang him", but "with such oaths and emphatic assertions" Tresham managed to convince the pair of his innocence, the next day urging them by letter to abandon the plot.&lt;ref name="fraser180" /&gt;  Antonia Fraser suggests that Catesby and Wintour's decision to believe him should not be disregarded.&lt;ref name="fraser180"&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|pp=180–182}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While making his deathbed confession in the [[Tower of London]], Tresham failed to mention the letter; an omission which in her opinion makes no sense if he is to be regarded as its author, especially considering that its recipient was by then being credited as the country's saviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|p=252}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Author Alan Haynes views Tresham as the most likely culprit, but raises the possibility that Cecil penned the letter himself, to protect a source.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Haynes|2005|p=88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Revealed==
Although he was already aware of certain stirrings even before he received the letter, Cecil did not yet know the exact nature of the plot or who was involved and had elected to watch to see what would happen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|pp=187–189}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When Monteagle's letter was shown to the king on Friday 1&amp;nbsp;November, James felt that it hinted at "some strategem of fire and powder",&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Northcote Parkinson|1976|p=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; perhaps an explosion exceeding in violence the one that killed his father, [[Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley|Lord Darnley]], in 1567.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Haynes|2005|p=90}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|pp=193–194}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The following day, members of the Privy Council visited James to inform him that a search would be made of the Houses of Parliament, "both above and below".&lt;ref name="fraser196" /&gt;  Meanwhile, Tresham again urged Catesby and Wintour to abandon the scheme, but his attempts were in vain.  Fellow plotter [[Thomas Percy (Gunpowder Plot)|Thomas Percy]] said he was ready to "abide the uttermost trial",&lt;ref name="fraser196"&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|pp=196–197}}&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently on 4&amp;nbsp;November Catesby and several others left London for the Midlands to prepare for the planned uprising.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|p=200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fawkes was arrested while guarding the explosives shortly after midnight on 5&amp;nbsp;November 1605.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|p=201}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Calling himself John Johnson, he was at first interrogated by members of the King's Privy Chamber,&lt;ref name="NorthcoteParkinsonpp9192"&gt;{{Harvnb|Northcote Parkinson|1976|pp=91–92}}&lt;/ref&gt; but on 6&amp;nbsp;November James ordered that "John Johnson" be tortured.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|p=211}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His will finally broken, he revealed his true identity on 7&amp;nbsp;November, and on 8&amp;nbsp;November he began to name some of those with whom he was associated.  Tresham's complicity was not revealed until the following day, although he was attributed with only a minor role.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|pp=215–217,&amp;nbsp;228–229}}&lt;/ref&gt;  But while his compatriots had fled London the moment they discovered that Fawkes had been captured, Tresham had stayed in the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|p=204}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was arrested on 12&amp;nbsp;November and transferred to the Tower three days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|p=236}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Catesby and several other plotters were killed on 8&amp;nbsp;November, during an armed siege at [[Holbeche House]] in [[Staffordshire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|pp=222–225}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
[[File:Tower of London, April 2006.jpg|right|thumb|Tresham died in the [[Tower of London]] from natural causes.]]
Although at first he was uncooperative, on 13&amp;nbsp;November Tresham confessed to being involved in the plot, outlining his version of events to his interrogators.  Moving his family from the safety of Rushton was, he pointed out, not the action of a man who believed he was taking them into "the very mouth and fury" of the plot.&lt;ref name="Fraserpp173175"/&gt;  He admitted to the government that he was guilty only of the plot's concealment, denying that he had ever been an active member of the conspiracy, although by the end of the month he had also admitted his involvement in the Spanish Treason of 1602–1603.&lt;ref name="ODNB Tresham"/&gt;  He claimed to have persuaded Thomas Wintour and Thomas Percy to postpone the explosion, and that he had planned to inform the king's secretary Thomas Lake of a "Puritan conspiracy".&lt;ref name="Fraserpp173175"/&gt;  Fraser views much of his confession as "highly partial&amp;nbsp;... not only for his own sake but for that of his wife and children", and important in serving to highlight his unreliability.&lt;ref name="Fraserpp173175"/&gt;

Tresham suffered from a [[strangury]] caused by an inflammation of his urinary tract, and in December 1605 his health began to decline.  Lieutenant of the Tower [[William Waad]], wondering if Tresham would live long enough for justice to take its course, described his condition as "worse and worse".&lt;ref name="fraser250" /&gt;  Tresham preferred the services of a Dr Richard Foster over those of the Tower's regular doctor [[Matthew Gwinne]]; apparently Foster understood his case, indicating that it was not the first occasion on which he had treated him.  During his last days he was attended by three more doctors and a nurse, along with William Vavasour, a rumoured illegitimate child of Thomas Tresham and possibly Francis's half-brother.  As Tresham's wife, Anne, was apparently too upset, Vavasour wrote Tresham's deathbed confession and also an account of his last hours.  Tresham apologised to the Jesuit priest [[Henry Garnet]] for implicating him in the Spanish Treason, and used the rest of his deathbed confession to protest his innocence.  Anne and William read prayers at his bedside; he died at 2:00&amp;nbsp;am on 23&amp;nbsp;December.  Despite not being tried, his head joined those of Catesby and Percy on display at Northampton, while his body was thrown into a hole at [[Tower Hill]].  His estates passed to his brother Lewis.  Tresham's apology never reached its intended target,&lt;ref name="fraser250"&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|pp=250–253}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his letter, along with the discovery of Garnet's ''Of Equivocation'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|p=268}}&lt;/ref&gt; found among the "heretical, treasonable and damnable books" at Tresham's chamber in the [[Inner Temple]], was used to great effect by Sir [[Edward Coke]] in Garnet's trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|pp=290,&amp;nbsp;311–315}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The priest was executed in May 1606.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Northcote Parkinson|1976|pp=114–115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3631">'''''From the Diary of Virginia Woolf''''' is an eight-part [[song cycle]] written by [[Dominick Argento]] in 1974 for the English [[mezzo-soprano]] [[Janet Baker]].&lt;ref name=All_music&gt;{{cite web|title=TBD|url=http://www.allmusic.com/composition/from-the-diary-of-virginia-woolf-for-voice-piano-mc0002378934|website=All Music|publisher=All Media Network, LLC|accessdate=7 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work won the [[Pulitzer Prize for Music]] in 1975.

The text of the songs comes from ''A Writer's Diary: Being Extracts from the Diary of Virginia Woolf'', which was published in 1954.&lt;ref name=Amazon-1954&gt;{{cite web|title=TBD|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0026QY6OM|publisher=Amazon.com Inc.|accessdate=7 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; (The five-volume diaries edited by Anne Olivier Bell were not published until 1979.&lt;ref name=Amazon-1979&gt;{{cite web|title=TBD|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000IDBR4M|website=Amazon.com|publisher=Amazon.com Inc.|accessdate=7 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

&lt;blockquote&gt;The choice of a prose, rather than poetic, source for a text is a common theme for Argento, who did the same thing in his cycles ''Letters from Composers'', ''The Andrée Expedition'', and ''Casa Guidi''. In each case, he captures the cadence and flow of these more free-form writings without sacrificing musical structure or melodic interest. The composer's original intention was to use excerpts from Woolf's novel ''The Waves'' as the basis for his cycle. But in reading her newly published diaries he discovered a source much richer in musical and expressive possibilities. The highly confessional diary texts illuminate Woolf's inner world in a more immediate way than do her literary works.&lt;ref name=All_music /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Reports of economic activity===
October sales of cars and light trucks in the United States fell precipitously in 2008 when compared with sales in October 2007, with General Motors falling 45%, Ford falling 30%, Chrysler falling 35%, Toyota falling 23%, Honda falling 25%, and Nissan falling 33%. Much of the falloff in sales was attributable to customers being unable to arrange financing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Employment reports released by the Labor Department on Friday, November 7, showed that about 500,000 jobs were lost in the United States during September and October 2008 with unemployment rising to 6.5% at the end of October. The September figure was revised to 284,000 from the initial 159,000 reported. The initial October figure was 240,000. This is a substantial acceleration from the average 75,000 jobs lost each month since the beginning of 2008. It is anticipated by experts that unemployment will rise to 8% by the middle of 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

On Sunday, November 9, the People's Republic of China announced a [[China Stimulus Plan|$586 billion domestic stimulus package]] for the remainder of 2008, 2009, and 2010. Economic growth has slowed in China with sharp drops in property and stock values.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

On Monday, November 10, the US Treasury announced investment of 40 billion dollars in preferred stock of AIG, adjusting the terms of the existing credit line and its amount. Total exposure, including equity and debt, is now 150 billion dollars. Funds were drawn from the Troubled Asset Relief Program which was not available at the time of the original bailout of AIG.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

On Wednesday, November 12, US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson scrapped the original Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) and announced shift in the focus to consumer lending. The remaining portion of the TARP budget will be used to help relieve pressure on consumer credits such as car loans, student loans, credit cards etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=aoD4QebIb_Fo&amp;refer=home |title=Paulson Shifts Focus of Rescue to Consumer Lending| date=2008-11-12| accessdate=2008-11-12|work=Bloomberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Thursday November 13, the [[Dow Jones Industrial Average]] marked another dramatic session, with the index (opening at 8,282.66) that after a mixed start tumbled again below the 8,000 mark (to a low of 7,965.42) but then reversed the trend and gained more than 900 points (fourth largest daily swing ever) in less than three hours closing at 8,835.25 with a net gain of more than 550 points (third largest ever).

The prospect of a federal bailout of failing US automakers appeared dim pending the inauguration of Barack Obama. There appeared to be opposition from both the Republican members of the Senate and the office of the incumbent president, George W. Bush, which expressed doubt that the companies could be salvaged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

At the invitation of US President George W. Bush the leaders of the [[G-20]] held the initial session of the [[2008 G-20 Washington summit|Summit on Financial Markets and the World Economy]] on Saturday, November 15, in Washington, D.C. They agreed to cooperate with respect to the global financial crisis and issued a statement regarding immediate and medium term goals and actions considered necessary to support and reform the international economy. The next session will be held April 30, probably in London, after Barack Obama takes office as President of the United States. The initial session, attended by the leaders of the G-20 set forth a road map of proposed reforms which will be followed up in coming months by the development of specific proposals, including a comprehensive reform of the Bretton Woods Institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==Week of November 16==

===Reports of economic activity===
In the third quarter of 2008 the gross domestic product of Japan fell 0.4% following a 3.7% drop in the second quarter. Similar reports of recession level economic activity had been released previously by Hong Kong, Germany and the European Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

'''''Halloween''''' is a 2007 American [[slasher film]] written, directed, and produced by [[Rob Zombie]]. The film is a [[Remake#Reimagine or renovate|remake/reimagining]] of the [[Halloween (1978 film)|1978 horror film of the same name]]; the first in the rebooted ''Halloween'' film series and the ninth installment of the [[Halloween (franchise)|''Halloween'' franchise]]. The film stars [[Tyler Mane]] as the adult [[Michael Myers (Halloween)|Michael Myers]],  [[Malcolm McDowell]] as [[Samuel Loomis|Dr. Sam Loomis]], [[Scout Taylor-Compton]] as [[Laurie Strode]], and [[Daeg Faerch]] as the ten year old Michael Myers. Rob Zombie's "reimagining" follows the premise of [[John Carpenter]]'s original, with Michael Myers stalking Laurie Strode and her friends on [[Halloween]] night. Zombie's film goes deeper into the character's psyche, trying to answer the question of what drove him to kill people, whereas in Carpenter's original film Michael did not have an explicit reason for killing.

Working from Carpenter's advice to "make [the film] his own",&lt;ref name="Make own"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thegauntlet.com/article/338/4589/Zombie,-Rob.html|title=Rob Zombie to Re-Make ''Halloween''|publisher=TheGauntlet.com|date=June 4, 2006|accessdate=December 19, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zombie chose to develop the film as both a [[prequel]] and a remake, allowing for more original content than simply re-filming the same scenes. Despite mostly negative reviews, the film, which cost $15 million to make,&lt;ref name="budget"/&gt; went on to gross $80.3 million worldwide in unadjusted U.S. dollars. Zombie followed the film with a sequel, ''[[Halloween II (2009 film)|Halloween II]]'', in 2009.

==Plot==
On Halloween night in Haddonfield, Illinois, having already exhibited signs of [[Psychopathy|psychopathic tendencies]], ten-year-old [[Michael Myers (Halloween)|Michael Myers]] ([[Daeg Faerch]]) murders a school bully ([[Daryl Sabara]]), his older sister [[List of Halloween characters#Judith Myers|Judith]] ([[Hanna R. Hall]]), her boyfriend [[List of Halloween characters#Steve Haley|Steve]] ([[Adam Weisman]]), and his mother's boyfriend [[List of Halloween characters#Ronnie White|Ronnie]] ([[William Forsythe (actor)|William Forsythe]]). Only his baby sister, Angel Myers, is spared. After one of the longest trials in the state's history, Michael is found guilty of [[first-degree murder]] and sent to Smith's Grove Sanitarium under the care of [[child psychology|child psychologist]] Dr. [[Samuel Loomis]] ([[Malcolm McDowell]]).

Michael initially cooperates with Loomis, claiming no memory of the killings; his mother [[List of Halloween characters#Deborah Myers|Deborah]] ([[Sheri Moon Zombie]]), visits him regularly. Over the following year, Michael becomes fixated on [[papier-mâché]] masks and withdraws from everyone around him, even Deborah. When Michael kills a nurse ([[Sybil Danning]]) as Deborah is leaving from one of her visits, she is unable to handle the situation and commits suicide.

For the next fifteen years, Michael ([[Tyler Mane]]) continues making masks and not speaking to anyone. Loomis, having continued to treat Michael over the years, decides to move on and closes Michael's case. Later, Michael escapes from Smith's Grove, killing multiple sanitarium employees in the process. He kills trucker Joe Grizzly ([[Ken Foree]]) for his clothes, and makes his way back to Haddonfield. On Halloween, Michael arrives at his now-abandoned childhood home, where he recovers the kitchen knife and Halloween mask he stored under the floorboards the night he killed his sister.

Meanwhile, [[Laurie Strode]] ([[Scout Taylor-Compton]]) and her friends [[Annie Brackett]] ([[Danielle Harris]]) and [[List of Halloween characters#Lynda Van Der Klok|Lynda Van Der Klok]] ([[Kristina Klebe]]) prepare for Halloween. Throughout the day, Laurie witnesses Michael watching her from a distance. Later that night, Laurie goes over to babysit [[List of Halloween characters#Tommy Doyle|Tommy Doyle]] ([[Skyler Gisondo]]). Meanwhile, Lynda meets up with her boyfriend [[List of Halloween characters#Bob Simms|Bob Simms]] ([[Nick Mennell]]) at Michael's abandoned home. Michael appears, murders them, and then heads to the Strode home, where he murders Laurie's parents, [[List of Halloween characters#Mason Strode|Mason]] ([[Pat Skipper]]) and [[List of Halloween characters#Cynthia Strode|Cynthia]] ([[Dee Wallace]]). Dr. Loomis, having been alerted of Michael's escape, arrives in Haddonfield looking for Michael. After obtaining a handgun, Loomis attempts to warn [[List of Halloween characters#Sheriff Lee Brackett|Sheriff Leigh Brackett]] ([[Brad Dourif]]) that Michael has returned to Haddonfield. Loomis and Brackett head to the Strode home, with Brackett explaining along the way that Laurie is really Michael's baby sister, having been adopted by the Strodes following their mother's suicide.

Meanwhile, Annie convinces Laurie to babysit [[List of Halloween characters#Lindsey Wallace|Lindsey Wallace]] (Jenny Gregg Stewart) so that she can meet with her boyfriend Paul ([[Max Van Ville]]). Annie and Paul return to the Wallace home and have sex; Michael kills Paul and attacks Annie. Bringing  Lindsey home, Laurie finds Annie on the floor, badly hurt but still alive, and calls the police. Michael attacks Laurie and chases her back to the Doyle home. Loomis and Brackett hear the 911 call over the radio and head toward the Wallace residence.

Michael kidnaps Laurie and takes her back to their old home. He tries to show Laurie that she is his sister, presenting a picture of them with their mother and removing his mask. Unable to understand, Laurie stabs Michael before escaping the house; Michael chases her, but Loomis arrives and shoots him. Recovering, Michael recaptures Laurie before she can leave and heads back to the house. Loomis again intervenes, but Michael subdues him. Laurie takes Loomis' gun and runs upstairs, but Michael corners her on a balcony and charges her head-on, knocking both of them over the railing. Laurie awakens on top of an unconscious Michael, and shoots him in the head just as he awakens.

==Production==
On June 4, 2006, [[Dimension Films|Dimension]] announced that [[Rob Zombie]], director of ''[[House of 1000 Corpses]]'' and ''[[The Devil's Rejects]]'', would be creating the next installment in the ''Halloween'' film series.&lt;ref name="Zombie"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.halloweenmovies.com/h9/zombierelease.html|publisher=HalloweenMovies.com|title=New "Halloween" film|date=June 4, 2006|accessdate=April 9, 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130103001924/http://www.halloweenmovies.com/h9/zombierelease.html|archivedate=January 3, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plan was for Zombie to hold many positions in the production; he would write, direct, produce, and serve as music supervisor.&lt;ref name="Zombie"/&gt; [[Bob Weinstein]] approached him about making the film. Zombie, who was a fan of the original ''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]'', jumped at the chance to make a ''Halloween'' film for Dimension Studios.&lt;ref name="Zombie"/&gt; Before Dimension went public with the news, Zombie felt obligated to inform Carpenter, out of respect, of the plans to remake his film.&lt;ref name="plot-interview"&gt;{{cite web|title=Halloween: On Set With Director Rob Zombie!|url=http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/feature/354|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071211100941/http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/feature/354|archivedate=December 11, 2007|publisher=Bloody-Disgusting|date=March 19, 2007|accessdate=April 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carpenter's request was for Zombie to "make it his own".&lt;ref name="Make own"/&gt; During a June 16, 2006 interview, Zombie announced that his film would combine the elements of prequel and remake with the original concept, and insisted that there would be considerable original content in the new film as opposed to mere rehashed material.&lt;ref name="Zombie interview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.halloweenmovies.com/h9_lobby.html|publisher=HalloweenMovies.com|title=Interview with Rob|date=June 16, 2006|accessdate=April 9, 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130103080749/http://www.halloweenmovies.com/h9_lobby.html|archivedate=January 3, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[BBC]] reported that the new film would disregard the numerous sequels that followed ''Halloween''.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite news|title=Zombie 'to resurrect Halloween'|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/5047704.stm|publisher=BBC News|date=June 5, 2006|accessdate=October 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Meyers-house.jpg|thumb|left|The Myers house film location early March 2007 on Glendon Way in [[South Pasadena, California]].]]
Zombie's intention was to reinvent Michael Myers because he felt the character, along with [[Freddy Krueger]], [[Jason Voorhees]], and [[Pinhead (Hellraiser)|Pinhead]], had become more familiar to audiences, and as a result, less scary.&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MTV interview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/shared/movies/flickd/z/rob_zombie_061026/|title=Evil Reborn: Zombie resurrects a horror classic|publisher=[[MTV]]|accessdate=April 10, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea behind the new film was to delve deeper into Michael's [[backstory]] and add "new life" to the character.&lt;ref name="Zombie interview"/&gt; Michael's mask will be given its own story, to provide an explanation as to why he wears it, instead of having the character simply steal a random mask from a hardware store, as in the original film.&lt;ref name="MTV interview 2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/movies/news/articles/1554005/20070306/story.jhtml|title=Zombie Kills 'Halloween' Theme Song, Revokes Myers' Driver's License|publisher=MTV|date=March 7, 2007|accessdate=April 10, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zombie explained that he wanted Michael to be true to what a [[psychopath]] really is, and wanted the mask to be a way for Michael to hide. He also wanted the young Michael to have [[charisma]], which would be projected onto the adult Michael. In addition, he decided that Michael's motives for returning to Haddonfield would be more ambiguous, explaining, "[W]as he trying to kill Laurie, or just find her because he loves her?"&lt;ref name="plot-interview"/&gt;

Moreover, Michael would not be able to drive in the new film, unlike his 1978 counterpart who stole Loomis' car so that he could drive back to Haddonfield.&lt;ref name="MTV interview 2"/&gt; The Dr. Loomis character was also to be more intertwined with that of Michael; Zombie reasoned that the character's role in the original was "showing up merely to say something dramatic".&lt;ref name="MTV interview"/&gt; Although Zombie added more history to the Michael Myers character, hence creating more original content for the film, he chose to keep the character's trademark mask and Carpenter's theme song intact for his version (despite an apparent misinterpretation in an interview suggesting the theme would be ditched).&lt;ref name="Zombie interview"/&gt; Production officially began on January 29, 2007.&lt;ref name="breakdown"&gt;{{cite web|title=Official ''Halloween'' Casting Breakdown, Synopsis|url=http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/7683 |publisher=Bloody-Disgusting|date=November 22, 2007|accessdate=April 12, 2010 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070218182240/http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/7683 |archivedate = February 18, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly before production began, Zombie reported that he had seen the first production of Michael's signature mask and commented, "It looks perfect, exactly like the original. Not since 1978 has The Shape looked so good".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/7927|title=The Big Question Answered ''Halloween''|date=January 4, 2007|publisher=Bloody-Disgusting|accessdate=January 4, 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070107063848/http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/7927|archivedate=January 7, 2007|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Filming occurred in the same neighborhood that Carpenter used for the original ''Halloween''.&lt;ref name="MTV interview 2"/&gt;

==Release==
Approximately four days before the theatrical release of the film, a [[workprint]] version of ''Halloween'' appeared online and was circulated around various [[BitTorrent (protocol)|BitTorrent]] sites. Upon hearing of the leaked copy, Zombie stated that whatever version had been leaked was an older version of the film, unlike what was about to be released in theaters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Elizabeth Cline|url=http://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2007/08/rob_zombies_halloween_remake_l.html|title=Rob Zombie's ‘Halloween’ Remake Leaks, Rob Zombie Shrugs|publisher=New York Entertainment|date=August 28, 2007|accessdate=August 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The leak of Zombie's workprint led to speculation that the film's box office success could be damaged, as director [[Eli Roth]] attributed the financial failure of his film, ''[[Hostel: Part II]]'', to the leaking of a workprint version.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Peter Sciretta|url=http://www.slashfilm.com/2007/08/28/rob-zombies-halloween-workprint-leaked-online/|title=Rob Zombie’s Halloween Workprint Leaked Online|publisher=Slashfilm|date=August 28, 2007|accessdate=March 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dark Horizons]] webmaster Garth Franklin noted that watching the workprint allows a viewer to see what was changed after test screenings of the film in June 2007.

===Critical response===
Based on 112 reviews collected by [[Rotten Tomatoes]], ''Halloween'' received an average 26% overall approval rating, with the consensus "Rob Zombie doesn't bring many new ideas to the table in ''Halloween'', making it another bloody disappointment for fans of the franchise."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/halloween_2007|title=Halloween|publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=October 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; By comparison, [[Metacritic]], which assigns a [[Weighted arithmetic mean|weighted average]] score out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, calculated a 47 out of 100 from the 18 reviews, indicating " mixed or average reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/film/titles/halloween2007|title=Halloween (2007): Reviews|publisher=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=September 9, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[CinemaScore]] polls reported that the average grade cinemagoers gave the film was "B-" on an A+ to F scale; it also reported that 62% of the audience was male, with 57% being 25 years or older.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Gregg Kilday|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/entertainmentNews/idUSN3019801620070905|title='Watchmen' takes box office lead|journal=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|agency=[[Reuters]]|date=September 5, 2007|accessdate=March 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Malcolm McDowell LF.JPG|thumb|Various critics thought that [[Malcolm McDowell]] was perfectly cast as Loomis.]]
Peter Hartlaub, of the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', felt Zombie was successful in both "[putting] his own spin on ''Halloween'', while at the same time paying tribute to Carpenter's film"; he thought Zombie managed to make Michael Myers almost "sympathetic" as a child, but that the last third of the film felt more like a montage of scenes with ''Halloween'' slipping into "slasher-film logic".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Peter Hartlaub |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2007/08/31/DDHPRT64J.DTL&amp;type=movies|title=Zombie's 'Halloween' follows Michael Myers' psychotic roots|work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|date=September 1, 2007 |accessdate=April 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nathan Lee of ''[[The Village Voice]]'' disagreed in part with Harlaub, feeling that ''Halloween'' may have placed too much emphasis on providing sympathy for Michael Myers, but that it succeeded in "[deepening] Carpenter's vision without rooting out its fear".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Nathan Lee|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080414155559/http://www.villagevoice.com/film/0736,lee,77659,20.html|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/film/0736,lee,77659,20.html|title=''Halloween'' review|work=[[The Village Voice]]|archivedate=April 14, 2008|date=August 28, 2007|accessdate=April 27, 2008|deadurl=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film critic Matthew Turner believed the first half of the film, which featured the prequel elements of Michael as a child, were better played than the remake elements of the second half. In short, Turner stated that performances from the cast were "superb", with Malcolm McDowell being perfectly cast as Dr. Loomis, but that the film lacked the scare value of Carpenter’s original.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Matthew Turner|url=http://www.viewlondon.co.uk/films/halloween-film-review-20549.html|publisher=The ViewLondon|title=Halloween review|date=September 28, 2007|accessdate=August 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jamie Russell from the [[BBC]] agreed that the first half of the film worked better than the last half; she stated that Zombie’s expanded backstory on Michael was "surprisingly effective"—also agreeing that McDowell was perfectly cast as Loomis—but that Zombie failed to deliver the "supernatural dread" that Carpenter created for Michael in his 1978 original.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Jamie Russell |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/films/2007/09/24/halloween_2007_review.shtml|title=BBC review|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=September 25, 2007|accessdate=August 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Daily News (New York)|New York Daily News]]'' critic Jack Matthews believed the film lacked tension, and went more for cheap shocks—focusing more on enhancing the "imagery of violence"—than real attempts to scare the audience; he gave the film one and a half stars out of five.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Jack Matthews|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/movies/2007/09/01/2007-09-01_rob_zombie_hacks_away_at_halloween_horro.html|title=Rob Zombie hacks away at 'Halloween' horror classic|work=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]|location=New York|date=September 1, 2007 |accessdate=April 27, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dennis Harvey, from ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' magazine, echoed Matthew's opinion that the film failed to deliver on the suspense; he also felt that you could not tell one teenage character from the next, whereas in Carpenter's original each teenager had real personalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Dennis Harvey|url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117934509.html?categoryid=31&amp;cs=1|title=''Variety'' review|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=August 27, 2007|accessdate=April 27, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, Rossiter Drake of ''The Examiner'' applauded Michael's backstory, feeling that it was a "compelling take on the mythology" that managed to be "unique" and "shocking" at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Staff Report|url=http://www.sfexaminer.com/sanfrancisco/halloween-once-more-with-flaying/Content?oid=2148413|title='Halloween': Once more, with flaying|publisher=The San Francisco Examiner |date=September 1, 2007 |accessdate=June 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In agreement with other critics, ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'' magazine's [[Kim Newman]] felt that, because Zombie seemed less focused on the teenagers being stalked and killed by Michael, the film "[fell] flat" when it came to delivering suspense or anything "remotely scary"; Newman did praise McDowell for his portrayal of the "dogged psychiatrist".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Kim Newman|url=http://www.empireonline.com/reviews/ReviewComplete.asp?FID=134964|title=''Empire'' review|work=[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]|accessdate=August 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ben Walter, of ''[[Time Out (company)|Time Out London]]'', felt Zombie added "surprising realism" to the development of Michael Myers’ psychopathic actions, but agreed with Newman that the director replaced the original film’s "suspense and playfulness" with a convincing display of "black-blooded brutality".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Ben Walter|url=http://www.timeout.com/film/reviews/84559/halloween.html|title=Halloween review|work=Time Out London|accessdate=August 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Frank Scheck, of ''The Hollywood Reporter'', believed that even though Zombie's remake of Carpenter's ''Halloween'' was better than getting another sequel in the long running franchise it still was not comparable to the 1978 original. For Scheck, Zombie replaced Carpenter's building suspense, which made it so "brilliant", with graphic violence and extended scenes of nudity; he also criticized McDowell for lacking the intensity that Donald Pleasence brought to the Loomis character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Frank Scheck|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/home_entertainment/dvd_reviews/article_display.jsp?&amp;rid=10337|title=Halloween review|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=August 31, 2007|accessdate=August 13, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090519050112/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/home_entertainment/dvd_reviews/article_display.jsp?&amp;rid=10337 |archivedate=May 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, ''[[TV Guide]]''{{'}}s Ken Fox felt that Zombie did deliver a "scary horror movie", not by copying Carpenter, but by making the film his own. Fox noted that Zombie seemed to follow more in the footsteps of [[Wes Craven]] and [[Tobe Hooper]]'s "savage, greasy-haired '70s" films, which allowed him to bring Michael back to his roots and successfully terrify an audience which has grown accustomed to the recent "[[Splatter film#Torture porn|torture porn]]" horror films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Ken Fox |url=http://www.tvguide.com/movies/halloween/review/289890 |title=''Halloween'' review|work=[[TV Guide]]|accessdate=August 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bill Gibron of ''[[PopMatters]]'' believes that audiences and critics cannot compare Carpenter's film to Zombie's remake; where Carpenter focused more on the citizens of Haddonfield—with Michael acting as a true "boogeyman"—Zombie focuses more on Michael himself, successfully forcing the audience to experience all of the elements that Michael went through that would result in his "desire for death".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Bill Gibron|url=http://www.popmatters.com/pm/post/47762/short-cuts-in-theaters-halloween-2007/|title=Short Cuts - In Theaters: Halloween (2007) |work=PopMatters|date=August 31, 2007|accessdate=August 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mathews went on to say, "Hopefully, with the attention focused by your movie on the link between cruelty to animals and human violence, more people will recognize the warning signs among people they know and deal with them more forcefully.

Carpenter himself was ambivalent about the film; during an audience Q&amp;A in 2016, Carpenter stated that he took issue with Zombie's comments that he was "cold" when they discussed the project and noted that it will color his perception of the film, and lamented that giving Myers a backstory took away from the mystique. He later clarified that he is on good terms with Zombie.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.loudersound.com/news/rob-zombie-settles-differences-with-john-carpenter&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 18, 2007, the film was released on [[DVD]] in the United States; both the theatrical (110 minutes) and an unrated [[director's cut]] (121 minutes) were released as two-disc special editions containing identical bonus features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000VKL6ZC|title=Halloween (Two-Disc Special Edition) DVD release|publisher=[[Amazon.com]]|accessdate=August 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was released on DVD in the UK on April 28, 2008, known as the "Uncut" edition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Halloween: Uncut|url=http://www.dvdactive.com/news/releases/halloween-uncut.html|publisher=DVDactive|accessdate=September 20, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 7, 2008, a three-disc set was released.&lt;ref name="BD"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/12872|title=Cover Art, Full Specs For 3-Disc 'Halloween' DVD Set|publisher=Bloody-Disgusting|date=July 10, 2008|accessdate=August 29, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; This Collector's Edition of ''Halloween'' features the same bonus features as the previous unrated edition, but includes Zombie's four-and-a-half-hour "[[making-of]]" documentary similar to the "30 Days in Hell" documentary for Zombie's ''[[The Devil's Rejects]]''.&lt;ref name="BD"/&gt;

The '''Ichthus Music Festival''' was an annual [[Christian music festival]] originally held in [[Wilmore, Kentucky]] but later moved to [[Lexington, Kentucky]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kyfestivals.com/details.php?id%3D5 |title=Ichthus Christian Music Festivals |access-date=November 2, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613115433/http://www.kyfestivals.com/details.php?id=5 |archive-date=June 13, 2010 |website=kyfestivals.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; Begun in 1970, Ichthus was the oldest Christian music festival in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Robison |first=Greg |title=Christian Rock Festivals |location=New York |publisher=Rosen |year=2009 |page=7 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id%3D0w7vTv6hzIMC%26pg%3DPA7%26lpg%3DPA7%26dq%3Dichthus+christian+music+festival%26source%3Dbl%26ots%3DoTf0y7CPi1%26sig%3DD5FLBuNRRDLUKKPCIk6Qik55D5s%26hl%3Den%26ei%3DgkDuSrCMDdSztgf3qtk6%26sa%3DX%26oi%3Dbook_result%26ct%3Dresult%26resnum%3D8%26ved%3D0CBsQ6AEwBzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=ichthus%20christian%20music%20festival&amp;f=false |access-date=December 27, 2015 |dead-url=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160617104120/https://books.google.com/books?id=0w7vTv6hzIMC&amp;pg=PA7&amp;lpg=PA7&amp;dq=ichthus+christian+music+festival&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=oTf0y7CPi1&amp;sig=D5FLBuNRRDLUKKPCIk6Qik55D5s&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=gkDuSrCMDdSztgf3qtk6&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CBsQ6AEwBzgK |archive-date=June 17, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The festival began as the brainchild of Dr. Bob Lyon and a group of seminary students at [[Asbury Theological Seminary]] in response to [[Woodstock Festival]] and similar music festivals of that era.&lt;ref&gt;Starting with Christian folk artists, the festival predated Contemporary Christian Music. {{cite web |last=Copley |first=Rich |title=At 40, Ichthus Isn't Looking Back |newspaper=Lexington Herald Leader |url=http://www.kentucky.com/712/story/826913.html |via=kentucky.com |access-date=November 2, 2009 |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090614045032/http://www.kentucky.com/712/story/826913.html |archive-date=June 14, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first events were held on the grounds of the Wilmore Campmeeting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ichthusfestival.org/about/history.php |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090614173249/http://www.ichthusfestival.org/about/history.php |archive-date=June 14, 2009 |title=About Ichthus |publisher=Ichthus Festival }}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2012, the Ichthus Festival Board announced the end of the long-running festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ichthusfestival.org |title=The Ichthus Festival |access-date=June 17, 2007 |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161009065247/http://www.ichthusfestival.org/ |archive-date=October 9, 2016 |publisher=Ichthus Festival }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Creation Festival]]s took over managing the event in 2013 with plans to resume the festival in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130829194951/http://www.centralkynews.com/jessaminejournal/news/jj-ichthus-music-festival-to-return-in-2014-at-kentucky-horse-park-20130508,0,5064932.story Ichthus music festival to return in 2014 at Kentucky Horse Park]&lt;/ref&gt; The festival was later postponed to 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Ward | first = Karla | title = Planned renewal of Ichthus Festival is called off until 2015 | work = Lexington Herald-Leader | accessdate = June 28, 2014 | date = April 12, 2014 | url = http://www.kentucky.com/2014/04/12/3193390/planned-renewal-of-ichthus-festival.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, Creation Festivals announced that they would no longer hold Ichthus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.kentucky.com/entertainment/ent-columns-blogs/copious-notes/article59319743.html |title=Ichthus Festival canceled, again |first=Rich |last=Copley |department=Copious Notes |date=February 9, 2016 |access-date=September 5, 2017 |newspaper=Lexington Herald-Leader }}&lt;/ref&gt; The rights to the Ichthus name were acquired by [[Asbury University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.asbury.edu/news-events/news/2016/05/06/26161 |title=Asbury Obtains Rights to Ichthus Name and Legacy |publisher=Asbury University |date=May 6, 2016 |access-date=September 5, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally an outdoor spring event, the festival was often hampered by poor weather. Beginning in 2006, the festival was moved to mid-June when local weather was more favorable. The festival consisted of six stages: The Main Stage, The Deep End, The Edge, two Indie Stages, and The Galleria Stage. It was a weekend long event, officially starting on Wednesday afternoon and ending on Saturday night. Most Ichthus attendees camped on the festival grounds.

==Origin of the festival's name==
[[File:Ichthus.svg|thumb|The Ichthus symbol]]{{Main article|Ichthys}}

The name of the festival was taken from the word [[Ichthys|Ichthus]] (Ichthys), an [[anagram]] in [[Koine Greek|Biblical Greek]] used since the second century by Christians as a symbol of their religion. The word is composed of the [[Greek alphabet|letters]] ''ἸΧΘΥΣ'', meaning ''[[fish]]''. The individual letters make up a confessional statement of Christians, "Jesus Christ Son of God, Savior":&lt;ref&gt;See, Robison, Greg, Christian Rock Festivals,(New York: The Rosen Publishing Co., 2009), p.7 {{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id%3D0w7vTv6hzIMC%26pg%3DPA7%26lpg%3DPA7%26dq%3Dichthus+christian+music+festival%26source%3Dbl%26ots%3DoTf0y7CPi1%26sig%3DD5FLBuNRRDLUKKPCIk6Qik55D5s%26hl%3Den%26ei%3DgkDuSrCMDdSztgf3qtk6%26sa%3DX%26oi%3Dbook_result%26ct%3Dresult%26resnum%3D8%26ved%3D0CBsQ6AEwBzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=ichthus%20christian%20music%20festival&amp;f=false |title=Archived copy |accessdate=December 27, 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160617104120/https://books.google.com/books?id=0w7vTv6hzIMC&amp;pg=PA7&amp;lpg=PA7&amp;dq=ichthus+christian+music+festival&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=oTf0y7CPi1&amp;sig=D5FLBuNRRDLUKKPCIk6Qik55D5s&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=gkDuSrCMDdSztgf3qtk6&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CBsQ6AEwBzgK |archivedate=June 17, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Worship==
Every day of the Ichthus festival a worship service was held at the main stage [[amphitheater]]. These services consisted of a worship session with music followed by a [[keynote]] speaker. A tent near the back of the worship area was staffed by altar ministers who were available to pray with people after the services.&lt;ref name="typepad1"&gt;[http://copiousnotes.typepad.com/weblog/ichthus_festival_2006/page/2/ Copious Notes: Ichthus Festival] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303235330/http://copiousnotes.typepad.com/weblog/ichthus_festival_2006/page/2/ |date=March 3, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the last day of the festival (Saturday) all stages, merchandise tents, and food vendors closed in the afternoon for a massive communion service. Around 20,000 people gathered at the main stage amphitheater for the massive communion service. This service consisted of praise and worship music followed by a keynote speaker and communion.&lt;ref name="typepad1"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1900">'''Kalmare ledung''' was a [[Crusade]] lead by the Norwegian king [[Sigurd the Crusader]] performed in 1123 to Christianize the Swedish province of [[Småland]]. 

While the rest of Sweden had became at least Christian by appearance by the 1080s, the province of Småland had experienced very little contact with Christianity and remained openly Pagan in the 1120s, with the inhabitants still openly worshiping the Norse gods.  Sigurd the Crusader made a pact with king [[Niels of Denmark]] to perform a crusade against Småland and force Christianity upon the Pagans.  The (Christian) Swedish king is not mentioned, even though the crusade took place against a Swedish province, but the Danish king was married to a Swedish princess, [[Margaret Fredkulla]]. The Danish king did not follow the agreement and never performed the crusade, but the Norwegian king performed the crusade in 1123.  Contemporary Swedish sources does confirm warfare between pagans and Norwegians in the south eastern corner of Småland and on the island of [[Öland]].  The Norwegian crusader army reportedly successfully forced the inhabitants to submit to the Christian faith, and brought 1500 cattle and many valuables with them back to Norway.

'''LinuxTag''' (the name is a compound with the [[German language|German]] ''Tag'' meaning [[Diet (assembly)|assembly]], conference or meeting) is a [[free software]] [[computer expo|exposition]] with an emphasis on [[Linux]] (but also [[BSD]]), held annually in [[Germany]]. LinuxTag claims to be Europe's largest exhibition for "[[open source software]]" and aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the Linux and free software market, and to promote contacts between users and developers. LinuxTag is one  of the world's most important events of this kind.

LinuxTag's slogan, "Where .COM meets .ORG", refers to its stated aim of bringing together  commercial and non-commercial groups in the IT sector. Each year's event also has its own subtitle.

== Promotion of free software ==
LinuxTag sees itself as part of the free software movement, and promotes this community in an extraordinary degree by supporting numerous [[Open-source software|open source]] projects. LinuxTag offers a way for these projects to promote their software and their concepts, and thus present themselves to the public in an appropriate manner, with their own stands, forums and lectures. The goal is to encourage projects to share concepts and content to the benefit of other groups and companies, and to provide forums for in-depth discussions of new technologies and opportunities.

== LinuxTag e.V. ==
The non-profit [[Voluntary association|association]] "LinuxTag e.V." was founded in preparation for LinuxTag's move from Kaiserslautern to the University of Stuttgart in 2000. The association plans and organizes the LinuxTag event by volunteer work and guides its ideological development. The association LinuxTag e.V. is [[Eingetragener Verein|registered]] in Association Register VR 2239 of the Kaiserslautern [[District Court]]. The association manages the ''LinuxTag'' name and [[word mark]]. The purpose of the association, according to its bylaws,&lt;ref&gt;''german'' Statute of the LinuxTag 2013 http://www.linuxtag.org/2013/de/der-verein/satzung.htm{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; is "the promotion of Free Software", and is pursued through the organization of the LinuxTag events.

The association is represented by a three-person executive board, supplemented by several representatives with delegated authority. All members of the LinuxTag association are volunteers and receive no remuneration for their service. (In 2005, the First Chairman and CFO were employed and remunerated by the association from 1 April until 31 July.) Surpluses resulting from the LinuxTag events or from sponsorship are reinvested in the association's non-profit activities.

== History ==
LinuxTag was launched in 1996 by a handful of active members of the Unix Working Group (Unix-AG) at the University of Kaiserslautern.&lt;ref&gt;''german'' LinuxTag Unix-AG http://www.unix-ag.uni-kl.de/~linux/linuxtag.html&lt;/ref&gt; They wanted to inform the public about the young technology of Linux and Open Source software. The first LinuxTag event only drew a small number of participants. Since then, however, the event has changed venues several times to keep pace with rapidly growing numbers of exhibitors and visitors.

=== Kaiserslautern ===
The first LinuxTag conference and exhibition was held at the [[Kaiserslautern University of Technology|University of Technology in Kaiserslautern]].

==== LinuxTag 1996 - 1999 ====
The first LinuxTag was a theme night on Linux. In 1998, LinuxTag drew 3,000 visitors. In 1999 the event was nationally announced, and drew some 7,000 visitors. It was the first time LinuxTag filled a whole building, and the last time it was held in [[Kaiserslautern]]. In the aftermath of the event, the LinuxTag association was founded.

=== Stuttgart ===
In 2000 and 2001 LinuxTag was held in [[Stuttgart]].

==== LinuxTag 2000 ====
LinuxTag 2000 was held at the [[Stuttgart Trade Fair|Stuttgart exhibition center]] from 29 June to 2 July, and received up to 17,000 visitors. The conference included a business track for the first time, devoted to such topics as IT security, legal aspects of free software, and potential uses of Linux and the open-source concept in commercial applications. IT decision-makers were shown case studies in  applications of free software.&lt;ref&gt;''german'' www.golem.de http://www.golem.de/0007/8524.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''german'' heise http://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/LinuxTag-2000-in-Stuttgart-21805.html&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref&gt;''german'' heise &lt;linux&lt;tag 2003 http://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/LinuxTag-2003-mit-Coding-Marathon-81739.html&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;''german'' golem http://www.golem.de/0306/25911.html&lt;/ref&gt; Together with the admission ticket for 10 euros, visitors received the LinuxTag for the first time available [[Knoppix]] DVD and a [[Tux (mascot)|Tux Pin]].  With 19,500 visitors, the number of visitors increased by 40 percent over the previous year.

As an exhibitor, both businesses and non-profit groups were represented. Apple showed [[Mac OS X]] in conjunction with [[Open-source software|open source]]. Around 150 exhibitors were there in 2003. Other highlights included the release of [[OpenGroupware.org]] on the model of [[OpenOffice.org]] as an open source and free conversion of several dozen [[Xbox]] s, some with hardware modification by two solder points, partially by importing the so-called MechInstallers on Linux.

There was also a Programming Competition, and on Sunday a world record attempt took 13 to 14 clock instead: On a server 100 Linux desktop sessions should with [[Gnome]] and [[K Desktop Environment|KDE]] are simultaneously running. Here, everyone could join in on the Internet. The result was not disclosed.

Besides the exhibition also congresses were held in which renowned experts spoke on a subject group. There was, for example, a [[Debian]] conference and on Sunday there was a lecture on [[Trusted Computing Platform Alliance|TCPA]], followed by discussion. The Business and Administration Congress has enlarged with 400 participants by about 60%. The free lecture program was opened on Friday by the Parliamentary State Secretary, Federal Ministry of Economics and Labour (BMWA), Rezzo Schlauch. Keanote speaker were Jon "Maddog" Hall of Linux International, Georg Greve of Free Software Foundation Europe and Matthias Kalle Dalheimer of Klarälvdalens Datakonsult AB.

With [[Webcam]]s you could also take a virtual visit to the fair. The Pingu-Cam ([[Tux (mascot)|Tux]] of [[Penguins|Penguin]] is the Linux mascot) showed pictures from the zoo of Karlsruhe, which is located right next to the fairgrounds.

'''Mothers Against Drunk Driving''' ('''MADD''') is a [[nonprofit organization]] in the United States and Canada that seeks to stop [[Driving under the influence|drunk driving]], support those affected by drunk driving, prevent underage drinking, and strive for stricter impaired driving policy, whether that impairment is caused by alcohol or any other drug. The [[Irving, Texas]]–based&lt;ref name= 990-2013/&gt; organization was founded on September 5, 1980, in California&lt;ref name= corp/&gt; by Candace Lightner after her 13-year-old daughter, Cari, was killed by a drunk driver.&lt;ref name="TMOTY85"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Friedrich |first=Otto |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,956231-3,00.html |title=Man of the Year 1985 |publisher=Time |date=1985-01-07 |accessdate=2009-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is at least one MADD office in every state of the United States&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mother's Against Drunk Driving (MADD) Local Offices|url=http://www.madd.org/local-offices/index-1.html|website=MADD- Mother's Against Drunk Driving|accessdate=15 October 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208153923/http://www.madd.org/local-offices/index-1.html|archivedate=8 December 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and at least one in each province of Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WHo is MADD Canada|url=http://madd.ca/pages/about-us/what-we-do/who-is-madd-canada/|website=MADD Canada|accessdate=15 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; These offices offer victim services and many resources involving alcohol safety. MADD has claimed that drunk driving has been reduced by half since its founding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.madd.org/victim-services/victim-rights/voca-funding.html|title=MADD - VOCA Funding|author=MADD|work=madd.org|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130405040906/http://www.madd.org/victim-services/victim-rights/voca-funding.html|archivedate=2013-04-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Positions==
According to MADD's website, "The mission of Mothers Against Drunk Driving is to end drunk driving, help fight drugged driving, support the victims of these violent crimes and prevent underage drinking."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Our story|url=https://www.madd.org/about-us/our-story/|df=|accessdate=2018-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally MADD favors strict policy in a variety of areas, including an illegal [[blood alcohol content]] of .08%&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.madd.org/Drunk-Driving/Drunk-Driving/laws/law.aspx?law=11 |title=MADD laws page |publisher=Madd.org |date=2000-01-01 |accessdate=2009-08-09}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; or lower and using stronger sanctions for DUI offenders, including mandatory jail sentences, treatment for [[alcoholism]] and other alcohol abuse issues, ignition interlock devices,&lt;ref name=ignition&gt;[http://www.madd.org/activism/0,1056,7604,00.html Ignition Interlock - Issue Brief] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928000848/http://www.madd.org/activism/0%2C1056%2C7604%2C00.html |date=2007-09-28 }} from the MADD website&lt;/ref&gt; and license suspensions; maintaining the minimum legal drinking age at 21 years; mandating alcohol breath-testing ignition interlock devices (IIDs) for everyone convicted of driving while legally impaired.

MADD's founder, Candace Lightner left the group in 1985. In 2002, as reported by [[The Washington Times]], Lightner stated that MADD "has become far more [[Neo-prohibitionism|neo-prohibitionist]] than I had ever wanted or envisioned … I didn't start MADD to deal with alcohol. I started MADD to deal with the issue of drunk driving".&lt;ref name="washtimes_madd-strugles"&gt;Bresnahan, S. [http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2002/aug/6/20020806-035702-2222r/ MADD struggles to remain relevant]. ''[[Washington Times]]'' Metropolitan edition), August 6, 2002, B1-2&lt;/ref&gt;

Author [[Susan Cheever]] and the [[SAGE Publishing|SAGE]] ''Encyclopedia of Social Problems'' have said MADD is a manifestation of the [[temperance movement]].&lt;ref name="Parrillo2008"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Parrillo |first1=Vincent N. |title=Encyclopedia of Social Problems |date=2008 |publisher=SAGE Publications |isbn=9781452265926 |pages=925 |language=English|quote=Other modern organizations that reflect some elements of the temperance movement are Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD) and Students Against Drunk Driving (SADD).}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cheever2015"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cheever |first1=Susan |title=Drinking in America: Our Secret History |date=2015 |publisher=Grand Central Publishing |isbn=9781455513864 |language=English|quote=Although the United States has been famous for drunkenness, it is also the birthplace of the world's most effective temperance movements, movements with very different goals: Alcoholics Anonymous and Motheresr Against Drunk Driving.}}&lt;/ref&gt; MADD "supports a substantial increase in taxation on alcoholic beverages as a means of covering the cost to society caused by misuse of alcohol".&lt;ref name="MADD2018"/&gt; MADD "advocates that schools and other organizations hosting social and athletic gatherings for youth take positive steps to ensure that alcoholic beverages not be present at those gatherings".&lt;ref name="MADD2018"&gt;{{cite web |title=Position Statements |url=https://www.madd.org/about-us/position-statements/ |publisher=MADD|access-date=1 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
On May 3, 1980, Cari Lightner, a 13-year-old girl, was killed by a drunken hit-and-run driver at Sunset and New York Avenues in [[Fair Oaks, California]]. The 46-year-old driver, who had recently been arrested for another DUI hit-and-run, left Cari's body at the scene.&lt;ref name="TMOTY85"/&gt; Cari's mother, Candace (Candy) Lightner, organized Mothers Against Drunk Driving and subsequently served as its founding president. A 1983 television movie about Lightner garnered publicity for the group, which grew rapidly.

In the early 1980s, the group attracted the attention of the [[United States Congress]]. [[U.S. Senate|Senator]] [[Frank Lautenberg]] (D-NJ) did not like the fact that youth in [[New Jersey]] could easily travel to [[New York (state)|New York]] to purchase [[Alcoholic drink|alcoholic beverages]], circumventing New Jersey's law restricting consumption to those 21 years old and older.&lt;ref name="madd-21-turns-20"&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.madd.org/news/8916 |deadurl= yes| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060519142950/http://www.madd.org/news/8916| archivedate= May 19, 2006|title= '21' turns 20| work= DRIVEN'' magazine''| date= Spring 2004| via= MADD.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group had its greatest success with the enacting of a 1984 federal law, the [[National Minimum Drinking Age Act]], that introduced a federal penalty (a 5%—later raised to 10%—loss of [[Federal-Aid Highway Act|federal highway dollars]]), for states that didn't raise the minimum legal age for the purchase and possession of alcohol to 21. After the [[United States Supreme Court]] upheld the law in the 1987 case of ''[[South Dakota v. Dole]]'', every state and the District of Columbia made the necessary adjustments by 1988 (but not the territories of [[Puerto Rico]] and [[Guam]]). However, in July 2010 Guam raised its drinking age to 21.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.guamlegislature.com/Public_Laws_30th/P.L.%2030-156%20-%20Bill%20No.%20389-30%20(COR).pdf|title=Ramon Someros Oberiano Act| last= |first= |date=2 July 2010 |website= guamlegislature.com |publisher= [[Legislature of Guam]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985, Lightner objected to the shifting focus of MADD, and left her position with the organization.

In 1988, a drunk driver traveling the wrong way on [[Interstate 71]] in [[Kentucky]] caused a head-on collision with a [[school bus]]. Twenty-seven people died and dozens more were injured in the ensuing fire. Known as the [[Carrollton bus collision|Carrollton bus disaster]], it equaled another [[Prestonsburg bus disaster|bus crash in Kentucky in 1958]] as the deadliest bus crash in US history. In the aftermath, several parents of the victims became actively involved in MADD and one became its national president.

In 1989, [[MADD Canada]] was founded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.madd.ca/english/about/index.html|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20040317014450/http://www.madd.ca/english/about/index.html|dead-url= yes|archive-date= 2004-03-17|title= Learn More|publisher= MADD Canada|website= MADD.ca|date= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, ''[[The Chronicle of Philanthropy]]'' released the results of the largest study of charitable and non-profit organization popularity and credibility.  The study showed that MADD was ranked as the "most popular charity/non-profit in America of over 100 charities researched with 51% of Americans over the age of 12 choosing "Love" and "Like A Lot" for MADD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title= The Charities Americans Like Most And Least| work= [[The Chronicle of Philanthropy]]| date= December 13, 1996 | volume= | number= | page= | publisher= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

MADD released its first "Rating the States" report, grading the states in their progress against drunk driving, in 1991. "Rating the States" has been released four times since then.

In 1999, MADD's National Board of Directors unanimously voted to change the organization's mission statement to include the prevention of underage drinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.madd.org/aboutus/1272| website= MADD.org| title= Why has MADD changed its mission statement?| publisher= Mothers Against Drunk Driving| date= | access-date= | deadurl= yes| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070928000905/http://www.madd.org/aboutus/1272| archivedate= 2007-09-28| df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, MADD announced its "Eight-Point Plan". This consisted of:
# Resuscitating the nation's efforts to prevent impaired driving.
# Increasing driving while intoxicated (DWI)/driving under the influence (DUI) enforcement, especially the use of frequent, highly publicized sobriety checkpoints.
# Enacting primary enforcement [[Seat belt legislation in the United States|seat belt laws]] in all states.
# Creating tougher, more comprehensive sanctions geared toward higher-risk drivers.
# Developing a dedicated National Traffic Safety Fund.
# Reducing underage drinking.
# Increasing beer excise taxes to the same level as those for spirits.
# Reinvigorating court monitoring programs.&lt;ref name= eightpoint&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.theautochannel.com/news/2002/06/19/142273.html |title=MADD Unveils 8-Point Plan to Jumpstart Stalled War on Drunk Driving | publisher= The Auto Channel | website= theautochannel.com| date= June 18, 2002 | access-date= June 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a November 2006 press release, MADD launched its 'Campaign to Eliminate Drunk Driving': this is a four-point plan to completely eliminate drunk driving in the United States using a combination of current technology (such as [[Breath alcohol ignition interlock device|alcohol ignition interlock device]]s), new technology in smart cars, law enforcement, and grass roots activism.&lt;ref name="MADD-campaign-to-eliminate"&gt;{{cite press release| url= http://www.madd.org/news/11286| website= MADD.org| title= MADD Announces National Campaign to Eliminate Drunk Driving| date= November 20, 2006| publisher= Mothers Against Drunk Driving| access-date= | deadurl= yes| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070928000935/http://www.madd.org/news/11286| archivedate= September 28, 2007| df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

MADD's national president was Millie I. Webb in 2002.&lt;ref name= eightpoint /&gt; [[Chuck Hurley]] became MADD CEO in 2005.&lt;ref name=always&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fastlane.dot.gov/2010/06/madd-ceo-chuck-hurley-steps-aside-but-will-always-be-a-part-of-madd.html |title=Road safety pioneer Chuck Hurley "will always be a part of MADD" |date=23 June 2010 |work=Fast Lane |publisher= US Department of Transportation |accessdate=24 January 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20111115104557/http://fastlane.dot.gov/2010/06/madd-ceo-chuck-hurley-steps-aside-but-will-always-be-a-part-of-madd.html |archivedate=15 November 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He retired in June 2010 and was replaced by Kimberly Earle, who had been CEO of [[Susan G.

==Funding==
According to [[Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006|Obama-Coburn Federal Funding Accountability Transparency Act of 2006]], MADD received $56,814  in funds from the federal government in fiscal year 2000, and a total of $9,593,455 between [[fiscal year]]s 2001 and 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160209213815/https://www.usaspending.gov/faads/faads.php?reptype=p&amp;database=faads&amp;principal_place_state_code=48&amp;principal_place_cc=Irving&amp;recip_cat_type=n&amp;asst_cat_type=&amp;email=&amp;fiscal_year=&amp;first_year_range=2001&amp;last_year_range=2006&amp;detail=-1&amp;datype=T Federal Assistance for Nonprofits in Irving, Texas from 2001- 2006] from usaspending.gov&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, ''[[Money magazine|Money]]'' magazine reported that telemarketers raised over $38 million for MADD, keeping nearly half of it in fees. This relationship continues to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.madd.org/sponsors/dialamerica.html|title=MADD - DialAmerica|author=MADD|work=madd.org|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130504194118/http://www.madd.org/sponsors/dialamerica.html|archivedate=2013-05-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, ''Worth'' magazine listed MADD as one of its "100 best charities".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.madd.org/about-us/history/madd-milestones.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-07-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019163612/http://www.madd.org/about-us/history/madd-milestones.pdf |archivedate=2013-10-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, ''USA Today'' reported that the [[American Institute of Philanthropy]] was reducing MADD from a "C" to a "D" in its ratings.
The Institute noted that MADD categorizes much of its fundraising expenses as "educational expenses", and that up to 58% of its revenue was expended on what the Institute considered fund-raising and management.&lt;ref&gt;Jayne O'Donnell [https://www.usatoday.com/money/2005-09-28-madd-change-usat_x.htm MADD enters 25th year with change on its mind]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Charity Navigator]] rated MADD at 63.53 out of 100 on its financial rating scale and 96.00 out of 100 on its accountability and transparency scale for its 2013 fiscal year.&lt;ref name="charnav"&gt;"[http://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&amp;orgid=4129 Mothers Against Drunk Driving]". ''Charity Navigator''. Accessed on January 19, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; MADD reported that it spent 24.4% of its total expenses on fundraising that year.&lt;ref name="charnav"/&gt;

In 2014 MADD spend over $9 million on fundraising activities according to its 2014 tax return.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.madd.org/about-us/annual-report/2014-Form-990-Public.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160911231144/http://www.madd.org/about-us/annual-report/2014-Form-990-Public.pdf|archivedate=2016-09-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities and criticisms==
[[File:MADD SmartWheels.jpg|thumb|MADD SmartWheels bus in [[Toronto]], [[Canada]].]]

[[Radley Balko]], an advocate for decriminalizing drunk driving,&lt;ref name=Balko&gt;{{Cite web |last=Balko |first=Radley |date=October 11, 2010 |url=http://reason.com/archives/2010/10/11/abolish-drunk-driving-laws |title=Abolish Drunk Driving Laws |work=[[Reason Magazine|Reason]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; argued in a December 2002 article that MADD's policies are becoming overbearing. "In fairness, MADD deserves credit for raising awareness of the dangers of driving while intoxicated. It was almost certainly MADD's dogged efforts to spark public debate that effected the drop in fatalities since 1980, when Candy Lightner founded the group after her daughter was killed by a drunk driver," Balko wrote. "But MADD is at heart a bureaucracy, a big one. It boasts an annual budget of $45 million, $12 million of which pays for salaries, pensions and benefits. Bureaucracies don't change easily, even when the problems they were created to address change."&lt;ref name="balko-targeting"&gt;"[http://www.cato.org/research/articles/balko-021209.html Targeting the Social Drinker Is Just MADD] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121012104349/http://www.cato.org/research/articles/balko-021209.html |date=2012-10-12 }}," Balko, Radley (from the [[CATO Institute]] website)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charity Watch]] gives MADD a "C-" grade.&lt;ref&gt;Charity Rating Guide and Watchdog Report, Volume Number 59, December 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===Drunk driving laws===
MADD was heavily involved in lobbying to reduce the legal limit for [[blood alcohol]] from BAC .10 to BAC .08.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Stricter blood alcohol limit for drivers: doctors, MADD|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/story/2001/11/27/bloodalcohol_011127.html|newspaper=CBC News|date=November 27, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 2000, this standard was passed by Congress and by 2004, every state had a legal .08 BAC limit.&lt;ref name=nelson&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.usnews.com/news/newsgram/articles/2013/05/28/madd-founder-dont-lower-the-legal-bac-limit | title=MADD Founder: Don't Lower the Legal BAC Limit | work=US News &amp; World Report | date=28 May 2013 | accessdate=3 August 2015 | author=Nelson, Steven}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[MADD Canada]] has called for a maximum legal BAC of .05.  Although many MADD leaders have supported a lower limit, MADD has not called for a legal limit of .05 in the United States.

===Victim impact panels===
MADD promotes the use of victim impact panels (VIPs), in which judges require DWI offenders to hear victims or relatives of victims of drunk driving crashes relate their experiences.  MADD received $5,547,693 in 2010&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.madd.org/about-us/annual-report/irs/fy11-form-990-public-copy.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-05-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141107050539/http://www.madd.org/about-us/annual-report/irs/fy11-form-990-public-copy.pdf |archivedate=2014-11-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; from VIPs; much of this income was voluntary donations by those attending as some states do not allow a fee to be charged to offenders for non-legislative programs.  Other states like California and Georgia require that a fee be paid in order to attend.  In California this fee ranges from $25 to $50 depending on the county and in Georgia this fee is $50.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.madd.org/local-offices/ga/VIP-Schedule.html|title=MADD - VIP SCHEDULE - GA|author=MADD|work=madd.org|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140817155842/http://www.madd.org/local-offices/ga/VIP-Schedule.html|archivedate=2014-08-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some states in the United States, such as Massachusetts, permit victims of all crimes, including drunk driving accidents, to give [[victim impact statement]]s prior to sentencing so that judges and prosecutors can consider the impact on victims in deciding on an appropriate sentence to recommend or impose. The presentations are often emotional, detailed, and graphic, and focus on the tragic negative consequences of DWI and alcohol-related crashes. According to the [[John Howard Society]], some studies have shown that permitting victims to make statements and to give testimony is psychologically beneficial to them and aids in their recovery and in their satisfaction with the criminal justice system.&lt;ref name="john-howard-society-victim-impact"&gt;[http://www.johnhoward.ab.ca/pub/C53.htm Victim Impact Statements&amp;mdash;John Howard Society of Alberta] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141107053047/http://www.johnhoward.ab.ca/pub/C53.htm |date=2014-11-07 }}, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; A [[New Mexico]] study suggested that the VIPs tended to be perceived as confrontational by multiple offenders. Such offenders then had a higher incidence of future offenses.&lt;ref name="vip-deterrence-effectiveness"&gt;"[http://casaa.unm.edu/posters/a%20randomized%20trial%20of%20victim%20impact%20panels%20dwi%20deterrence%20effectiveness.pdf A Randomized Trial of Victim Impact Panels’ DWI Deterrence Effectiveness] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306205017/http://casaa.unm.edu/posters/a%20randomized%20trial%20of%20victim%20impact%20panels%20dwi%20deterrence%20effectiveness.pdf |date=2012-03-06 }}," W.

===''Grand Theft Auto''===
On April 29, 2008 MADD issued a press release criticizing the video game ''[[Grand Theft Auto IV]]'' saying it was "extremely disappointed" with the manufacturers. MADD has called on the [[ESRB]] to re-rate the game to Adults Only. They also called on the manufacturer ([[Rockstar Games|Rockstar]]) "to consider a stop in distribution – if not out of responsibility to society then out of respect for the millions of victims/survivors of drunk driving.".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.madd.org/Media-Center/Media-Center/Press-Releases/Press-Releases/2008/MADD's-Statement-Regarding-Grand-Theft-Auto-IV.aspx {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513021529/http://www.madd.org/Media-Center/Media-Center/Press-Releases/Press-Releases/2008/MADD%E2%80%99s-Statement-Regarding-Grand-Theft-Auto-IV.aspx |date=2008-05-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Players can drive drunk in ''Grand Theft Auto IV'' but doing so makes it harder to drive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.joystiq.com/2008/01/23/grand-theft-auto-iv-preview-splosion/ Grand Theft Auto IV preview-splosion!] - Joystiq&lt;/ref&gt; The game also explicitly recommends that the player take a taxi instead of driving, and the character makes humorous remarks suggesting that it is bad to drive drunk. Ignoring these will lead to consequences: if any police officer is around while the player is drunk driving, the player immediately becomes wanted by the police&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Does GTA IV promote drunk driving? |url=https://www.destructoid.com/does-gta-iv-promote-drunk-driving--84443.phtml |website=destructoid |accessdate=13 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Blood alcohol content===
Prior to the MADD's influence, drunk driving laws addressed the danger by making it a criminal offense to drive a vehicle while impaired — that is, while "under the influence of alcohol"; the amount of alcohol in the body was evidence of that impairment.  The level specified at that time — commonly, 0.15% — was high enough to indicate drunkenness rather than impairment.  In part due to MADD's influence, all 50 states have now passed laws making it a criminal offense to drive with a designated level of alcohol of .08% or higher.&lt;ref name=nelson/&gt;

===Sobriety checkpoints===
{{Further|Sobriety checkpoint}}

MADD writes that "opponents of sobriety checkpoints tend to be those who drink and drive frequently and are concerned about being caught".&lt;ref name="madd-online-sobriety-facts-and-myths"&gt;[http://www.madd.org/madd_programs/1229 Sobriety Checkpoints: Facts &amp; Myths] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927235258/http://www.madd.org/madd_programs/1229 |date=2007-09-27 }} from MADD's website&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Radley Balko]], opponent of limits on drunk driving&lt;ref name=Balko/&gt; and writer for ''[[Reason Magazine]]'', discusses the possible social implications of some of MADD's policies in a 2002 article. He writes, "In its eight-point plan to 'jump-start the stalled war on drunk driving,' MADD advocates the use of highly publicized but random roadblocks to find drivers who have been drinking.".&lt;ref name="balko-targeting"/&gt;

===Beer taxes===
Balko criticizes MADD for not advocating higher [[excise tax]]es on distilled spirits, even though it campaigns for higher excise taxes for beer. He writes, "Interestingly, MADD refrains from calling for an added tax on distilled spirits, an industry that the organization has partnered with on various drunk driving awareness projects."&lt;ref name="balko-targeting"/&gt; MADD writes, "Currently, the federal excise tax is $.05 per can of beer, $.04 for a glass of wine and $.12 for a shot of distilled spirits, which all contain about the same amount of alcohol."&lt;ref name=eightpoint/&gt;{{Dead link|date=April 2009}} Point 7 of MADD's 8-Point Plan is to "Increase beer excise taxes to equal the current excise tax on distilled spirits".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.madd.org/news/0,1056,4395,00.html New 8-Point Plan To Jumpstart Stalled War On Drunk Driving] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060220123911/http://www.madd.org/news/0%2C1056%2C4395%2C00.html |date=2006-02-20 }} from MADD's website&lt;/ref&gt;

===Breath alcohol ignition interlock devices ===
{{Main|Ignition interlock device}}
Additionally, MADD has proposed that [[breath alcohol ignition interlock device]]s should be installed in all new cars.
Tom Incantalupo wrote:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.beawarenow.org/news_archive.php?id=701{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
"Ultimately, the group said yesterday, it wants so-called alcohol interlock devices factory-installed in all new cars. "The main reason why people continue to drive drunk today is because they can," MADD president Glynn Birch said at a news teleconference from Washington, D.C."

Sarah Longwell, a spokeswoman for the restaurant [[lobbying group]] [[American Beverage Institute]], responded to MADD's proposals for ignition interlocks by stating "This interlock campaign is not about eliminating drunk driving, it is about eliminating all moderate drinking prior to driving. The 40 million Americans who drink and drive responsibly should be outraged." She also points out that "Many states have laws that set the presumptive level of intoxication at .05% and you can't adjust your interlock depending on which state you're driving in. Moreover, once you factor in liability issues and sharing vehicles with underage drivers you have pushed the preset limit down to about .02%. It will be a ''de facto'' zero tolerance policy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/madd-interlock-campaign-targets-responsible-social-drinkers-56477837.html | title=MADD Interlock Campaign Targets Responsible Social Drinkers | work=PR Newswire | accessdate=3 August 2015 | author=American Beverage Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A review{{By whom|date=June 2014}} of devices concluded, "The results of the study show that interlock works for some offenders in some contexts, but not for all offenders in all situations. More specifically, ignition interlock devices work best when they are installed, although there is also some evidence that judicial orders to install an interlock are effective for repeat DUI offenders, even when not all offenders comply and install a device. California's administrative program, where repeat DUI offenders install an interlock device in order to obtain restricted driving privileges, is also associated with reductions in subsequent DUI incidents. One group for whom ignition interlock orders do not appear effective is first DUI offenders with high blood alcohol levels.".&lt;ref&gt;California Department of Motor Vehicles [http://www.dmv.ca.gov/about/profile/rd/210_ignition_interlock_report.pdf An Evaluation of the Effectiveness of Ignition Interlock in California] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080911014129/http://www.dmv.ca.gov/about/profile/rd/210_ignition_interlock_report.pdf |date=2008-09-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ohridski Trubaduri - Ohrid Fest''' is a music festival that takes place in [[Ohrid]], [[Republic of Macedonia]] every summer. It began in 1994 as a showcase for Macedonian summer folklore. In 1997, a pop evening was introduced to motivate Macedonian lyricists and composers, as well as artists. In 2003, an international evening was added to the program, which consists of foreign artists performing their songs along with the best placed songs from the pop evening. The festival has become prominent within the [[Balkan]] region which led to its broadcast in different countries such as [[Bulgaria]], [[Croatia]], [[Montenegro]], [[Serbia]], and [[Greece]]. The winners of the festival are awarded with a monetary prize as well as promotional products from the sponsors. 

In 2008, a fourth night was added to the festival in which amateur or unrecognized singers would compete to qualify for the pop evening.The '''Ohrid Summer Festival''' is a festival founded on 4 August 1961, always taking place between 12 July and 20 August in the city of [[Ohrid]], [[Republic of Macedonia]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120323051307/http://www.mia.com.mk/default.aspx?vId=75922467&amp;lId=1&amp;pmId=505] &lt;/ref&gt; It is financed by the Ministry of Culture of the Republic of Macedonia and sponsors. The [[President of the Republic of Macedonia]] is the patron of the festival. The festival featured prominent artists since 1961, i.e. [[José Carreras]]. Since 1994, the festival is a member of the [[European Festivals Association]].Many world-renowned musicians like [[Leonid Kogan]], [[Svyatoslav Richter]], [[Grigory Sokolov]], [[Andre Navarra]], [[Martina Arroyo]], [[Henryk Szeryng]], [[Ivo Pogorelić]], [[Mstislav Rostropovich]], [[Aldo Ciccolini]], [[Gidon Kremer]], [[Ruggiero Ricci]], [[Viktor Tretiakov]], [[Salvatore Accardo]], [[Elena Obraztsova]], [[Katia Ricciarelli]], [[Victoria de los Ángeles]], [[Maxim Vengerov]], [[Vadim Repin]], [[Julian Rachlin]], [[Michel Camilo]], [[Paul Meyer (clarinetist)|Paul Meyer]], [[Dmitri Hvorostovsky]], [[Leo Nucci]], [[Barbara Frittoli]], [[Jessye Norman]], [[Nigel Kennedy]], [[Zubin Mehta]], [[Ennio Morricone]], [[Mikhail Pletnev]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.novamakedonija.com.mk/NewsDetal.asp?vest=71312913558&amp;id=16&amp;setIzdanie=22629 |title=Славниот Карерас најмногу заработил од „Охридско лето“ - Нова Македонија |website=Novamakedonija.com.mk |date=2012-07-13 |accessdate=2016-01-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150721151123/http://www.novamakedonija.com.mk/NewsDetal.asp?vest=71312913558&amp;id=16&amp;setIzdanie=22629 |archivedate=2015-07-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and many other have performed at Ohridski Leto.

{{United Kingdom in the European Union}}
Since the United Kingdom's vote to leave the [[European Union]] in the [[United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016|2016 referendum]], a number of demonstrations have taken place and organisations formed whose goal has been to oppose, reverse or otherwise impede that decision.

=== People's Vote march ===
On 23 June 2018, the second anniversary of the EU referendum, [[People's Vote]] organised a march and protest from [[Trafalgar Square]] to [[Parliament Square]] in Central London. Speakers included [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]] leader [[Vince Cable]], [[Green Party of England and Wales|Green Party]] co-leader [[Caroline Lucas]], Labour's [[David Lammy]] and the Conservatives' [[Anna Soubry]]. The organisers said that at least 100,000 people attended the march. A smaller pro-Brexit march was held in London on the same date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-44586638|title=Brexit: Marchers demand final Brexit deal vote|work=BBC News|date=23 June 2018|accessdate=25 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://news.sky.com/story/live-thousands-marching-for-vote-on-final-brexit-deal-11414177 |title='At least 100,000' march for vote on final Brexit deal |publisher=Sky News |date=23 June 2018 |accessdate=18 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The People's Vote march was not designed to reverse the result of the referendum, but to hold a public vote on the final terms of the UK's EU exit deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/brexit-london-protest-march-second-eu-referendum-saturday-latest-vote-a8413286.html|title=Brexit march: Tens of thousands take to London streets to demand new referendum on terms of EU departure|newspaper=The Independent|date=23 June 2018|accessdate=25 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organisers said Brexit was "not a done deal" and Cable said "Brexit is not inevitable. Brexit can be stopped."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/anti-brexit-march-london-today-2018-06-23/|title=Tens of thousands anti-Brexit protesters march in London, demand new vote|work=CBS News|date=23 June 2018|accessdate=25 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Contradict-inline|date=August 2018|reason=directly contradicts 'was not designed to reverse the result of the referendum' in preceding sentence}} The Labour leader [[Jeremy Corbyn]] was criticised for not attending the march.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-44592989|title=Labour frontbenchers defend no show at anti-Brexit march|work=BBC News|date=24 June 2018|accessdate=25 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The People's Vote March for the Future===
On 20 October 2018, organisers estimated that 700,000 people attended the march jointly organised by People's Vote and the UK newspaper ''[[The Independent]]'', although police were unable to verify the number.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-45925542|title=People's Vote march: 'Hundreds of thousands' attending London protest|publisher=BBC News|date=20 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.peoples-vote.uk/march |title=People's Vote and The Independent March for the Future |publisher=People's Vote UK |accessdate=11 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aim of the march was to secure a vote on the final Brexit deal. The march organisers stated: "Whether you voted leave or remain, nobody voted to make this country worse off, to harm jobs, to damage the NHS, to affect the future of millions of young people, or to make this country more divided. The more the shape of the final Brexit deal becomes clear, the more it is clear that it will do nothing to improve social justice, reduce inequality, increase our standard of living, or create a better future for future generations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.peoples-vote.uk/march|title=People's Vote and The Independent March for the Future|website=People's Vote}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of celebrities, including [[Delia Smith]], [[Ian McEwan]], Sir [[Patrick Stewart]] and [[Charlie Mullins]], stated that they would fund coach travel to London, to enable those wishing to attend the march to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.scotsman.com/news/uk/people-s-vote-march-full-list-of-celebrities-funding-coaches-for-people-attending-brexit-protest-1-4811663 |title=People’s Vote march: full list of celebrities funding coaches for people attending Brexit protest |date=8 October 2018|accessdate=11 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/oct/06/stars-line-up-to-pay-coach-travel-to-brexit-peoples-vote-march |title=Stars line up to pay for coach travel to Brexit 'people's vote' march |date=6 October 2018|accessdate=11 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the organisers' stated estimate of the attendance was correct, then the event was the second-largest protest of the 21st century in the UK, after the [[15 February 2003 anti-war protests|"Stop the War" anti-Iraq War march in 2003]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/live/2018/oct/20/peoples-vote-march-london-second-referendum-brexit-live|title=People's Vote march: '700,000' rally for new Brexit referendum|publisher=The Guardian|date=20 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leeds for Europe is also affiliated to the [[European Movement UK]].

==== European Movement UK ====
[[European Movement UK]] is an organisation which campaigns in support of greater [[European integration]] and for reform of the EU. It is part of the [[European Movement International]], which pushes for a "democratic, federal, enlarged European Union".&lt;ref name="EM"&gt;{{cite web | title = About the European Movement | url = http://www.europeanmovement.co.uk/about | website = europeanmovement.co.uk | publisher = [[European Movement UK|European Movement]] | access-date = 1 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Formed in 1949, it campaigned for Britain to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum and continues to oppose Brexit in collaboration with other major pro-European campaign groups such as Open Britain and Britain for Europe.&lt;ref name="EM" /&gt;

====Healthier IN the EU====
[[Healthier IN the EU]] was co-founded in 2016 by [[Mike Galsworthy]], Rob Davidson, &lt;ref name="Guardian_280418"&gt;{{cite news | last = Lynskey | first = Dorian | title = 'It's not a done deal': inside the battle to stop Brexit | url = https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/apr/28/brexit-not-a-done-deal-battle-to-stay-in-eu-second-referendum | work = [[The Guardian]] | date = 28 April 2018 | access-date = 12 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Martin McKee]]. Its advisory board included former Chief Executive of the NHS in England [[Nigel Crisp]], former Minister for Health [[John Bowis]], former Chief Medical Officer for Scotland [[Harry_Burns_(doctor)|Harry Burns]], former President of the Royal College of Physicians [[Ian Gilmore]], President of Royal College of Psychiatrists [[Simon Wessely]], and the editor of The Lancet, [[Richard_Horton_(editor)|Richard Horton]]. Healthier in the EU is a grassroots organization making the health case for continued EU membership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.healthierin.eu/about|title=About Us|publisher=Healthier IN the EU|access-date=30 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Marsh"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2017/10/brexit-regret-theresa-may-europe-trade-boris-johnson/541653/|work=[[The Atlantic]]|title=A Harsh Wake-Up Call for Some Brexiteers|first=Stefanie|last=Marsh|date=6 October 2017|access-date=29 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Shortly before the [[United Kingdom general election, 2017|2017 general election]], Healthier IN the EU and [[Vote Leave Watch]] organized an open letter calling on the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] to commit to spending an extra £350m per week on the NHS after Brexit. The letter was signed by some of the UK's leading medical professionals.&lt;ref name="Indy20170517"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/conservatives-must-make-manifesto-commitment-of-350m-a-week-for-the-nhs-say-doctors-a7739401.html| work=[[The Independent]]| title=Conservatives must make manifesto commitment of £350m a week for the NHS, say doctors| first=Tom| last=Peck | date=17 May 2017| access-date=3 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The amount of £350m per week corresponded to the savings attributable to Brexit claimed by the [[Vote Leave]] campaign. Following the publication of the letter, foreign secretary [[Boris Johnson]] received negative press coverage for falsely claiming that the pledge was already in the Conservative Party election manifesto.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| work=[[The Independent]]| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/boris-johnson-falsely-claims-350m-nhs-brexit-pledge-conservative-manifesto-a7747376.html| title=Boris Johnson falsely claims £350m for NHS after Brexit pledge is in the Conservative manifesto| first=Ashley| last=Cowburn| date=21 May 2017| access-date=3 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Scientists for EU]] is a pro-EU research advocacy group. It was co-founded by scientists [[Mike Galsworthy]] and Rob Davison on 8 May 2015, the day after the [[United Kingdom general election, 2015|UK general election 2015]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Who we are | url = http://www.scientistsforeu.uk/who_we_are | website = scientistsforeu.uk | publisher = Scientists for EU | access-date = 12 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CW"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.chemistryworld.com/news/scientists-launch-campaign-to-oppose-uk-exit-from-eu/9044.article|title=Scientists launch campaign to oppose UK exit from EU|date=13 October 2015|first=Emma|last=Stone|publisher=[[Chemistry World]]|access-date=29 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its advisory board included high-profile UK scientists, including former EU chief scientific advisor [[Anne_Glover_(biologist)|Anne Glover]], and MPs from different political parties.&lt;ref name="CW"/&gt; Galsworthy articulated two concerns that Scientists for EU aimed to address: "first, a lack of clarity and cohesion within the community on EU benefits and Brexit risks; and, secondly, a lack of public understanding on the UK/EU relationship in science."&lt;ref name="Hansard_010316"&gt;{{cite hansard |jurisdiction=United Kingdom |house=[[Science and Technology Committee (House of Lords)|House of Lords, Select Committee on Science and Technology]] | title = The Relationship between EU Membership and the Effectiveness of UK Science: Oral Evidence Session | url = http://data.parliament.uk/writtenevidence/committeeevidence.svc/evidencedocument/science-and-technology-committee-lords/relationship-between-eu-membership-and-the-effectiveness-of-uk-science/oral/30032.html |date= 1 March 2016 |speaker=Mike Galsworthy (et al) |position=Programme Director, Scientists for EU}} [https://parliamentlive.tv/event/index/d55ca1a4-fa81-4720-88e9-54f88cffd64f Video.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Pacific Asia Conference on Information Systems (PACIS)''' is an annual conference for [[Information Systems]] and [[Information Technology]] academics and professionals and is affiliated with the [[Association for Information Systems]]. Its purpose is to provide a high quality forum for researchers, practitioners, and policy makers to exchange research findings and ideas on the adoption of leading information-related technologies and practices.

PACIS is considered the premier information systems event in the Asia Pacific region and provides a platform for panel discussions and the presentation of [[peer-reviewed]] information systems research papers.

The conference attracts several hundred submissions each year, and those that are selected for presentation appear in the 'PACIS Proceedings’, which are archived online at [http://www.pacis-net.org/ http://www.pacis-net.org/].

The first PACIS conference took place in 1993 at National Sun Yat-Sen University in [[Kaohsiung, Taiwan]]. The 1993 and 1995 conferences carried the title of '''Pan Pacific Conference on Information Systems'''. In 1997 the name was changed to the '''Pacific Asia Conference on Information Systems'''. From 1993 it was a biannual event until 2000. Since 2000, PACIS has been held annually in different cities throughout the Asia Pacific, generally within East Asia and Australasia. The conference has attracts an increasing number of registered delegates from around 150-200 in early years to around 400-600 in recent years. More than 250 papers were presented either as full papers or poster papers in recent conferences.

The PACIS logo consists of a globe positioned on a map of the Asia Pacific.

'''''Poppy''''' is a 1982 [[musical comedy]] play set during the [[First Opium War]].  The play takes the form of a [[pantomime]], complete with [[Dick Whittington]] (played as a [[principal boy]]), a [[pantomime dame]], and two [[pantomime horse]]s.  The [[book (musical theater)|book]] and lyrics were written by [[Peter Nichols]]; the [[composer]] was [[Monty Norman]].

==Plot==

The year is 1840. The [[Emperor of China]] warns the young [[Queen Victoria]] to know her place - "The Emperor's Greeting". The scene is set, panto-style, in a quaint, cardboard English village, "Dunroamin-on-the-Down", ancestral home of Sir Richard (Dick) Whittington and his widowed mother Lady Dodo.

Dick sets off with his manservant Jack Idle and the men of the village to seek their fortune in London or in the new towns of the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Jack is sad to leave his girlfriend, Sally.  His horse Randy and her mare Cherry also fancy each other and have to be rebuked for their friskiness - "Whoa, Boy".  Lady Dodo pines for the good old days, but Dick believes the age of gold is yet to come.

Sally, left with her mare, sings of her confusion.  She likes Jack but pines for Sir Richard, who is also her [[legal guardian]].  Secretly, she and Dodo take off on their own for London.

In the [[City of London|City]], Dick encounters Obadiah Upward, an up-and-coming merchant, who explains how their fortunes can be made in distant China from the sale of [[Opium poppy|poppies]].  Dodo and Sally arrive and they agree to make the journey.

They sail to India, and, in the poppy fields, Dodo tells Upward why she loves him - "[[nostalgie de la boue|Nostalgie de la Boue]]".  Dick and Jack reflect on [[British India]], the [[East India Company]] and the [[Battle of Plassey]] in a [[Rudyard Kipling|Kipling-esque]] ballad - "John Companee"

En route for China aboard one of Upward's opium [[clipper]]s, Dick persuades Jack and Sally to sample their wares, and they savour a [[wikt:pipe dream|pipe dream]] of paradise.

The Emperor of China tells Victoria to stop the cultivation of poppies, but she replies that the "Bounty of the Earth" is to be shared by every nation.  She leaves him alone to lament his son's addiction to the drug.  He sends [[Commissioner Lin]] to [[Guangzhou|Canton]] to stamp out the trade.  Here, Lin meets [[Deng Tingzhen|Viceroy Teng]] and his daughter Yoyo who is confused by Europeans - "[[Cross-race effect|They All Look the Same To Us]]".

Obadiah refuses to be intimidated by Lin's threats and sends Dick up the coast to seek fresh markets. Victoria joins his crew as an interpreter and Christian missionary and is questioned on her religious scruples. She explains there is a blessed trinity that justifies trade - "Blessed Trinity" (of [[Christianity, Commerce and Civilization|Civilisation, Commerce and Christianity]]). 

Before they leave, Dodo guesses that Sally loves Dick and tells her he is not only her guardian but also her half-brother.

The Chinese lay siege to the European compound, and the animals have to be slaughtered for food. Jack sings Randy a last [[lullaby]] before killing him - "Rock-A-Bye Randy"

In the [[First Opium War|war]] that follows, the Chinese are defeated and surrender [[Hong Kong Island]]. Dodo and Upward sing of how the British and French soldiers sacked the [[Imperial Summer Palace]] in Peking - "Rat-a-Tat-Tat".

Though there are dark and savage undertones to this fairy tale, in the end, most of the British live happily ever after, and it is the Chinese who learn to know their place.

==Production history==

''Poppy'' premiered on 25 September 1982 at the [[Barbican Arts Centre|Barbican Centre]] performed by the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]].  That year, it won the [[Laurence Olivier Award]] for best new musical.  On 14 November 1983, the play was moved to the [[Adelphi Theatre]] and ran until 18 February 1984.  The show was [[Revival (play)|revived]] in December 1988 at the now-closed [[Half Moon Theatre]] (with [[Louise Gold]] as [[Dick Whittington]]), in 1998 by the [[Chelsea Players]], and again in March 2005 by the [[Italia Conti Academy]] at the [[Landor Theatre]].

A 'script-in-hand' performance was given as part of the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]]'s 50th Birthday Celebrations on 9 July 2011, directed by [[Mark Ravenhill]], with both [[Peter Nichols]] and [[Monty Norman]] in the audience.

'''Reliability engineering''' is a sub-discipline of [[systems engineering]] that emphasizes [[dependability]] in the [[product lifecycle management|lifecycle management]] of a [[product (business)|product]]. Dependability, or reliability, describes the ability of a system or component to function under stated conditions for a specified period of time.&lt;ref&gt;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (1990) IEEE Standard Computer Dictionary: A Compilation of IEEE Standard Computer Glossaries. New York, NY {{ISBN|1-55937-079-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reliability is closely related to [[availability]], which is typically described as the ability of a component or system to function at a specified moment or interval of time.

'''Reliability''' is theoretically defined as the [[probability]] of success &lt;math&gt;(\text{Reliability} = 1 - \text{Probability of Failure});&lt;/math&gt; as the frequency of failures; or in terms of [[availability]], as a probability derived from reliability, testability and maintainability. [[Testability]], [[maintainability]] and [[maintenance, repair and operations|maintenance]] are often defined as a part of "reliability engineering" in Reliability Programs. Reliability plays a key role in the [[cost-effectiveness]] of systems.

Reliability engineering deals with the estimation, prevention and management of high levels of "lifetime" engineering [[uncertainty]] and [[risk]]s of failure. Although [[stochastic]] parameters define and affect reliability, reliability is not (solely) achieved by mathematics and statistics.&lt;ref&gt;RCM II, Reliability Centered Maintenance, Second edition 2008, page 250-260, the role of Actuarial analysis in Reliability&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|url=http://www.lambdaconsulting.co.za/2012ARS_EU_T1S5_Barnard.pdf|title=Why You Cannot Predict Electronic Product Reliability|conference=2012 ARS, Europe|location=Warsaw, Poland}}&lt;/ref&gt; One cannot really find a root cause (needed to effectively prevent failures) by only looking at statistics. "Nearly all teaching and literature on the subject emphasize these aspects, and ignore the reality that the ranges of uncertainty involved largely invalidate quantitative methods for prediction and measurement."&lt;ref name="O'Connor_2002"&gt;O'Connor, Patrick D. T. (2002), ''Practical Reliability Engineering'' (Fourth Ed.), John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York. {{ISBN|978-0-4708-4462-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, it is easy to represent "probability of failure" as a symbol or value in an equation, but it is almost impossible to predict its true magnitude in practice, which is massively multivariate, so having the equation for reliability does not begin to equal having an accurate predictive measurement of reliability. 

Reliability engineering relates closely to [[safety engineering]] and to [[system safety]], in that they use common methods for their analysis and may require input from each other. Reliability engineering focuses on costs of failure caused by system downtime, cost of spares, repair equipment, personnel, and cost of warranty claims. Safety engineering normally focuses more on preserving life and nature than on cost, and therefore deals only with particularly dangerous system-failure modes. High reliability ([[safety factor]]) levels also result from good engineering and from attention to detail, and almost never from only reactive failure management (using reliability accounting and statistics).&lt;ref name="lambda"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://lambdaconsulting.co.za/rwa%20barnard%20incose%202008.pdf

&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The word ''reliability'' can be traced back to 1816, and is first attested to the poet [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]].&lt;ref&gt;Saleh, J.H. and Marais, Ken, "Highlights from the Early (and pre-) History of Reliability Engineering", Reliability Engineering and System Safety, Volume 91, Issue 2, February 2006, Pages 249–256&lt;/ref&gt; Before World War II the term was linked mostly to [[repeatability]]; a test (in any type of science) was considered "reliable" if the same results would be obtained repeatedly. In the 1920s product improvement through the use of [[statistical process control]] was promoted by Dr. [[Walter A. Shewhart]] at [[Bell Labs]],&lt;ref&gt;Juran, Joseph and Gryna, Frank, Quality Control Handbook, Fourth Edition, McGraw-Hill, New York, 1988, p.24.3&lt;/ref&gt; around the time that [[Waloddi Weibull]] was working on statistical models for fatigue. The development of reliability engineering was here on a parallel path with quality. The modern use of the word reliability was defined by the U.S. military in the 1940s, characterizing a product that would operate when expected and for a specified period of time.

In World War II, many reliability issues were due to the inherent unreliability of electronic equipment available at the time, and to fatigue issues. In 1945, M.A. Miner published the seminal paper titled "Cumulative Damage in Fatigue" in an ASME journal. A main application for reliability engineering in the military was for the vacuum tube as used in radar systems and other electronics, for which reliability proved to be very problematic and costly. The IEEE formed the Reliability Society in 1948. In 1950, the [[United States Department of Defense]] formed group called the "Advisory Group on the Reliability of Electronic Equipment" (AGREE) to investigate reliability methods for military equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015013918332|title=Reliability of military electronic equipment;report.|last=|first=|date=4 June 1957|publisher=[[United States Department of Defense]]|year=|isbn=|location=Washington|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This group recommended three main ways of working:

* Improve component reliability
* Establish quality and reliability requirements for suppliers
* Collect field data and find root causes of failures

In the 1960s more emphasis was given to reliability testing on component and system level. The famous military standard 781 was created at that time.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} Around this period also the much-used (and also much-debated) military handbook 217 was published by RCA (Radio Corporation of America) and was used for the prediction of failure rates of components. The emphasis on component reliability and empirical research (e.g. Mil Std 217) alone slowly decreases. More pragmatic approaches, as used in the consumer industries, are being used. In the 1980s, televisions were increasingly made up of solid-state semiconductors. Automobiles rapidly increased their use of semiconductors with a variety of microcomputers under the hood and in the dash. Large air conditioning systems developed electronic controllers, as had microwave ovens and a variety of other appliances. Communications systems began to adopt
electronics to replace older mechanical switching systems. Bellcore issued the first consumer prediction methodology for telecommunications, and SAE developed a similar document SAE870050 for automotive applications. The nature of predictions evolved during the decade, and it became apparent that die complexity wasn't the only factor that determined failure rates for Integrated Circuits (ICs).
Kam Wong published a paper questioning the bathtub curve&lt;ref&gt;Wong, Kam, "Unified Field (Failure) Theory-Demise of the Bathtub Curve", Proceedings of Annual RAMS, 1981, pp402-408&lt;/ref&gt;—see also [[reliability-centered maintenance]]. During this decade, the failure rate of many components dropped by a factor of 10. Software became important to the reliability of systems. By the 1990s, the pace of IC development was picking up. Wider use of stand-alone microcomputers was common, and the PC market helped keep IC densities following Moore's law and doubling about every 18 months. Reliability engineering now was more changing towards understanding the [[physics of failure]]. Failure rates for components kept on dropping, but system-level issues became more prominent. [[Systems thinking]] became more and more important. For software, the CCM model (Capability Maturity Model) was developed, which gave a more qualitative approach to reliability. ISO 9000 added reliability measures as part of the design and development portion of Certification. The expansion of the World-Wide Web created new challenges of security and trust. The older problem of too little reliability information available had now been replaced by too much information of questionable value. Consumer reliability problems could now have data and be discussed online in real time. New technologies such as micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS), handheld GPS, and hand-held devices that combined cell phones and computers all represent challenges to maintain reliability. Product development time continued to shorten through this
decade and what had been done in three years was being done in 18 months. This meant that reliability tools and tasks must be more closely tied to the development process itself. In many ways, reliability became part of everyday life and consumer expectations.

== Overview ==
=== Objective  ===
The objectives of reliability engineering, in decreasing order of priority, are:&lt;ref&gt;Practical Reliability Engineering, P. O'Conner – 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

# To apply engineering knowledge and specialist techniques to prevent or to reduce the likelihood or frequency of failures.
# To identify and correct the causes of failures that do occur despite the efforts to prevent them.
# To determine ways of coping with failures that do occur, if their causes have not been corrected.
# To apply methods for estimating the likely reliability of new designs, and for analysing reliability data.

The reason for the priority emphasis is that it is by far the most effective way of working, in terms of minimizing costs and generating reliable products. The primary skills that are required, therefore, are the ability to understand and anticipate the possible causes of failures, and knowledge of how to prevent them. It is also necessary to have knowledge of the methods that can be used for analysing designs and data.

=== Scope and techniques ===
Reliability engineering for "[[complex systems]]" requires a different, more elaborate systems approach than for non-complex systems. Reliability engineering may in that case involve:

* System availability and mission readiness analysis and related reliability and maintenance requirement allocation
* Functional system failure analysis and derived requirements specification
* Inherent (system) design reliability analysis and derived requirements specification for both hardware and software design
* System diagnostics design
* Fault tolerant systems (e.g. by redundancy)
* Predictive and preventive maintenance (e.g. reliability-centered maintenance)
* Human factors / human interaction / human errors 
* Manufacturing- and assembly-induced failures (effect on the detected "0-hour quality" and reliability)
* Maintenance-induced failures
* Transport-induced failures
* Storage-induced failures
* Use (load) studies, component stress analysis, and derived requirements specification
* Software (systematic) failures
* Failure / reliability testing (and derived requirements)
* Field failure monitoring and corrective actions
* Spare parts stocking (availability control)
* Technical documentation, caution and warning analysis 
* Data and information acquisition/organisation (creation of a general reliability development hazard log and [[Failure reporting, analysis, and corrective action system|FRACAS]] system)
* Chaos Engineering

Effective reliability engineering requires understanding of the basics of [[failure cause|failure mechanisms]] for which experience, broad engineering skills and good knowledge from many different special fields of engineering,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reliabilityweb.com/index.php/articles/where_do_reliability_engineers_come_from/|title=Articles  –  Where Do Reliability Engineers Come From?  –  ReliabilityWeb.com: A Culture of Reliability|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; for example:

* [[Tribology]] 
* [[Stress (mechanics)]] 
* [[Fracture mechanics]] / [[Fatigue (material)|fatigue]] 
* [[Thermal engineering]]
* [[Fluid mechanics]] / shock-loading engineering
* [[Electrical engineering]]
* [[Chemical engineering]] (e.g. [[corrosion]])
* [[Material science]]

=== Definitions ===
Reliability may be defined in the following ways:
* The idea that an item is fit for a purpose with respect to time
* The capacity of a designed, produced, or maintained item to perform as required over time
* The capacity of a population of designed, produced or maintained items to perform as required over specified time
* The resistance to failure of an item over time
* The probability of an item to perform a required function under stated conditions for a specified period of time
* The durability of an object

=== Basics of a reliability assessment ===
Many engineering techniques are used in reliability [[risk assessment]]s, such as reliability [[hazard analysis]], [[failure mode and effects analysis]] (FMEA),&lt;ref&gt;Using Failure Modes, Mechanisms, and Effects Analysis in Medical Device Adverse Event Investigations, S. Cheng, D. Das, and M. Pecht, ICBO: International Conference on Biomedical Ontology, Buffalo, NY, July 26–30, 2011, pp. 340–345&lt;/ref&gt; [[fault tree analysis]] (FTA), [[Reliability Centered Maintenance]], (probabilistic) load and material stress and wear calculations, (probabilistic) fatigue and creep analysis, human error analysis, manufacturing defect analysis, reliability testing, etc. It is crucial that these analysis are done properly and with much attention to detail to be effective. Because of the large number of reliability techniques, their expense, and the varying degrees of reliability required for different situations, most projects develop a reliability program plan to specify the reliability tasks ([[statement of work]] (SoW) requirements) that will be performed for that specific system.

Consistent with the creation of a [[safety case]]s, for example [[ARP4761]], the goal of reliability assessments is to provide a robust set of qualitative and quantitative evidence that use of a component or system will not be associated with unacceptable risk. The basic steps to take&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=System Safety Handbook|publisher=U.S. Department of Transportation|url=http://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/handbooks_manuals/aviation/risk_management/ss_handbook/|author=Federal Aviation Administration|accessdate=2 June 2013|format=PDF|date=19 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; are to:
 
* First thoroughly identify relevant unreliability "hazards", e.g. potential conditions, events, human errors, failure modes, interactions, failure mechanisms and root causes, by specific analysis or tests.
* Assess the associated system risk, by specific analysis or testing.
* Propose mitigation, e.g. [[requirement]]s, design changes, detection logic, maintenance, training, by which the risks may be lowered and controlled for at an acceptable level.
* Determine the best mitigation and get agreement on final, acceptable risk levels, possibly based on cost/benefit analysis.

[[Risk]] here is the combination of probability and severity of the failure incident (scenario) occurring.

In a ''de minimis'' definition, severity of failures includes the cost of spare parts, man-hours, logistics, damage (secondary failures), and downtime of machines which may cause production loss. A more complete definition of failure also can mean injury, dismemberment, and death of people within the system (witness mine accidents, industrial accidents, space shuttle failures) and the same to innocent bystanders (witness the citizenry of cities like Bhopal, Love Canal, Chernobyl, or Sendai, and other victims of the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami)—in this case, reliability engineering becomes system safety.  What is acceptable is determined by the managing authority or customers or the affected communities. Residual risk is the risk that is left over after all reliability activities have finished, and includes the un-identified risk—and is therefore not completely quantifiable.

[[File:Risk Cost Analysis.jpg|thumb|Risk vs cost/complexity&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Structural Integrity Analysis|author=Kokcharov I.|contribution= Structural Safety|url=http://www.kokch.kts.ru/me/t6/SIA_6_Structural_Safety.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The complexity of the technical systems such as Improvements of Design and Materials, Planned Inspections, Fool-proof design, and Backup Redundancy decreases risk and increases the cost. The risk can be decreased to ALARA (as low as reasonably achievable) or ALAPA (as low as practically achievable) levels.

== Reliability and availability program plan ==
Implementing a reliability program is not simply a software purchase; it's not just a checklist of items that must be completed that will ensure one has reliable products and processes. A reliability program is a complex learning and knowledge-based system unique to one's products and processes. It is supported by leadership, built on the skills that one develops within a team, integrated into business processes and executed by following proven standard work practices.&lt;ref&gt;Reliability Hotwire – July 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

A reliability program plan is used to document exactly what "best practices" (tasks, methods, tools, analysis, and tests) are required for a particular (sub)system, as well as clarify customer requirements for reliability assessment. For large-scale complex systems, the reliability program plan should be a separate [[document]]. Resource determination for manpower and budgets for testing and other tasks is critical for a successful program. In general, the amount of work required for an effective program for complex systems is large.

A reliability program plan is essential for achieving high levels of reliability, testability, [[maintainability]], and the resulting system [[Availability]], and is developed early during system development and refined over the system's life-cycle. It specifies not only what the reliability engineer does, but also the tasks performed by other [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]]. A reliability program plan is approved by top program Management, which is responsible for allocation of sufficient resources for its implementation.

A reliability program plan may also be used to evaluate and improve the availability of a system by the strategy of focusing on increasing testability &amp; maintainability and not on reliability. Improving maintainability is generally easier than improving reliability. Maintainability estimates (repair rates) are also generally more accurate. However, because the uncertainties in the reliability estimates are in most cases very large, they are likely to dominate the availability calculation (prediction uncertainty problem), even when maintainability levels are very high. When reliability is not under control, more complicated issues may arise, like manpower (maintainers / customer service capability) shortages, spare part availability, logistic delays, lack of repair facilities, extensive retro-fit and complex configuration management costs, and others. The problem of unreliability may be increased also due to the "domino effect" of maintenance-induced failures after repairs. Focusing only on maintainability is therefore not enough. If failures are prevented, none of the other issues are of any importance, and therefore reliability is generally regarded as the most important part of availability. Reliability needs to be evaluated and improved related to both availability and the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) due to cost of spare parts, maintenance man-hours, transport costs, storage cost, part obsolete risks, etc.  But, as GM and Toyota have belatedly discovered, TCO also includes the downstream liability costs when reliability calculations have not sufficiently or accurately addressed customers' personal bodily risks.  Often a trade-off is needed between the two.  There might be a maximum ratio between availability and cost of ownership.  Testability of a system should also be addressed in the plan, as this is the link between reliability and maintainability.  The maintenance strategy can influence the reliability of a system (e.g., by preventive and/or predictive maintenance), although it can never bring it above the inherent reliability.

The reliability plan should clearly provide a strategy for availability control. Whether only availability or also cost of ownership is more important depends on the use of the system. For example, a system that is a critical link in a production system—e.g., a big oil platform—is normally allowed to have a very high cost of ownership if that cost translates to even a minor increase in availability, as the unavailability of the platform results in a massive loss of revenue which can easily exceed the high cost of ownership. A proper reliability plan should always address RAMT analysis in its total context. RAMT stands for reliability, availability, maintainability/maintenance, and testability in the context of the customer's needs.

== Reliability requirements ==
For any system, one of the first tasks of reliability engineering is to adequately specify the reliability and maintainability requirements allocated from the overall [[availability]] needs and, more importantly, derived from proper design failure analysis or preliminary prototype test results. Clear requirements (able to designed to) should constrain the designers from designing particular unreliable items / constructions / interfaces / systems. Setting only availability, reliability, testability, or maintainability targets (e.g., max. failure rates) is not appropriate.  This is a broad misunderstanding about Reliability Requirements Engineering.  Reliability requirements address the system itself, including test and assessment requirements, and associated tasks and documentation.  Reliability requirements are included in the appropriate system or subsystem requirements specifications, test plans, and contract statements.  Creation of proper lower-level requirements is critical.&lt;ref&gt;Reliability Maintainability and Risk Practical Methods for Engineers Including Reliability Centred Maintenance and Safety
– David J. Smith (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;references group="27. Todinov M.T., Reliability and Risk Models: setting reliability requirements, Wiley, 2016." /&gt;Provision of only quantitative minimum targets (e.g., MTBF values or failure rates) is not sufficient for different reasons. One reason is that a full validation (related to correctness and verifiability in time) of a quantitative reliability allocation (requirement spec) on lower levels for complex systems can (often) not be made as a consequence of (1) the fact that the requirements are probabilistic, (2) the extremely high level of uncertainties involved for showing compliance with all these probabilistic requirements, and because (3) reliability is a function of time, and accurate estimates of a (probabilistic) reliability number per item are available only very late in the project, sometimes even after many years of in-service use. Compare this problem with the continuous (re-)balancing of, for example, lower-level-system mass requirements in the development of an aircraft, which is already often a big undertaking. Notice that in this case, masses do only differ in terms of only some %, are not a function of time, the data is non-probabilistic and available already in CAD models. In case of reliability, the levels of unreliability (failure rates) may change with factors of decades (multiples of 10) as result of very minor deviations in design, process, or anything else.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Practical Reliability Engineering, O'Conner, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; The information is often not available without huge uncertainties within the development phase. This makes this allocation problem almost impossible to do in a useful, practical, valid manner that does not result in massive over- or under-specification. A pragmatic approach is therefore needed—for example:  the use of general levels / classes of quantitative requirements depending only on severity of failure effects. Also, the validation of results is a far more subjective task than for any other type of requirement. (Quantitative) reliability parameters—in terms of MTBF—are by far the most uncertain design parameters in any design.

Furthermore, reliability design requirements should drive a (system or part) design to incorporate features that prevent failures from occurring, or limit consequences from failure in the first place. Not only would it aid in some predictions, this effort would keep from distracting the engineering effort into a kind of accounting work. A design requirement should be precise enough so that a designer can "design to" it and can also prove—through analysis or testing—that the requirement has been achieved, and, if possible, within some a stated confidence.  Any type of reliability requirement should be detailed and could be derived from failure analysis (Finite-Element Stress and Fatigue analysis, Reliability Hazard Analysis, FTA, FMEA, Human Factor Analysis, Functional Hazard Analysis, etc.) or any type of reliability testing. Also, requirements are needed for verification tests (e.g., required overload stresses) and test time needed. To derive these requirements in an effective manner, a [[systems engineering]]-based risk assessment and mitigation logic should be used.  Robust hazard log systems must be created that contain detailed information on why and how systems could or have failed.  Requirements are to be derived and tracked in this way.  These practical design requirements shall drive the design and not be used only for verification purposes.  These requirements (often design constraints) are in this way derived from failure analysis or preliminary tests.  Understanding of this difference compared to only purely quantitative (logistic) requirement specification (e.g., Failure Rate / MTBF target) is paramount in the development of successful (complex) systems.&lt;ref&gt;System Reliability Theory, second edition, Rausand and Hoyland – 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

The maintainability requirements address the costs of repairs as well as repair time.  Testability (not to be confused with test requirements) requirements provide the link between reliability and maintainability and should address detectability of failure modes (on a particular system level), isolation levels, and the creation of diagnostics (procedures).
&lt;references group="27. Todinov M.T., Reliability and Risk Models: setting reliability requirements, Wiley, 2016" /&gt;As indicated above, reliability engineers should also address requirements for various reliability tasks and documentation during system development, testing, production, and operation.  These requirements are generally specified in the contract statement of work and depend on how much leeway the customer wishes to provide to the contractor. Reliability tasks include various analyses, planning, and failure reporting.  Task selection depends on the criticality of the system as well as cost.  A safety-critical system may require a formal failure reporting and review process throughout development, whereas a non-critical system may rely on final test reports.  The most common reliability program tasks are documented in reliability program standards, such as MIL-STD-785 and IEEE 1332. Failure reporting analysis and corrective action systems are a common approach for product/process reliability monitoring.

== Reliability culture / human errors / human factors ==
In practice, most failures can be traced back to some type of [[human error]], for example in:

* Management decisions (e.g. in budgeting, timing, and required tasks)
* Systems Engineering: Use studies (load cases)
* Systems Engineering: Requirement analysis / setting
* Systems Engineering: Configuration control 
* Assumptions
* Calculations / simulations / FEM analysis
* Design
* Design drawings
* Testing (e.g. incorrect load settings or failure measurement)
* Statistical analysis
* Manufacturing
* Quality control
* Maintenance
* Maintenance manuals
* Training
* Classifying and ordering of information
* Feedback of field information (e.g. incorrect or too vague)
* etc.

However, humans are also very good at detecting such failures, correcting for them, and improvising when abnormal situations occur. Therefore, policies that completely rule out human actions in design and production processes to improve reliability may not be effective. Some tasks are better performed by humans and some are better performed by machines.&lt;ref&gt;The Blame Machine, Why Human Error Causes Accidents – Whittingham, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, human errors in management; the organization of data and information; or the misuse or abuse of items, may also contribute to unreliability. This is the core reason why high levels of reliability for complex systems can only be achieved by following a robust [[systems engineering]] process with proper planning and execution of the validation and verification tasks. This also includes careful organization of data and information sharing and creating a "reliability culture", in the same way that having a "safety culture" is paramount in the development of safety critical systems.

== Reliability prediction and improvement ==
{{See also|Risk Assessment#Quantitative risk assessment}}
Reliability prediction combines:

* creation of a proper reliability model (see further on this page)
* estimation (and justification) of input parameters for this model (e.g. failure rates for a particular failure mode or event and the mean time to repair the system for a particular failure)
* estimation of output reliability parameters at system or part level (i.e. system availability or frequency of a particular functional failure)

Some recognized reliability engineering specialists (e.g. Patrick O'Connor, R. Barnard) have argued that too much emphasis is often given to the prediction of reliability parameters, instead more effort should be devoted to the prevention of failure (reliability improvement).&lt;ref name="O'Connor_2002" /&gt; Failures can and should be prevented in the first place for most cases. The emphasis on quantification and target setting (e.g. MTBF) might imply there is a limit to achievable reliability, however, there is no inherent limit and development of higher reliability does not need to be more costly. In addition, they argue that prediction of reliability from historic data can be very misleading, with comparisons only valid for identical designs, products, manufacturing processes, and maintenance with identical operating loads and usage environments. Even minor changes in any of these could have major effects on reliability. Furthermore, the most unreliable and important items (i.e. the most interesting candidates for a reliability investigation) are most likely to be modified and re-engineered since historical data was gathered, making the standard (re-active or pro-active) statistical methods and processes used in e.g. medical or insurance industries less effective. Another surprising — but logical — argument is that to be able to accurately predict reliability by testing, the exact mechanisms of failure must be known and therefore — in most cases — could be prevented! Following the incorrect route of trying to quantify and solve a complex reliability engineering problem in terms of MTBF or probability using an-incorrect – for example, the re-active – approach is referred to by Barnard as "Playing the Numbers Game" and is regarded as bad practice.&lt;ref name=lambda/&gt;

For existing systems, it is arguable that any attempt by a responsible program to correct the root cause of discovered failures may render the initial MTBF estimate invalid, as new assumptions (themselves subject to high error levels) of the effect of this correction must be made. Another practical issue is the general unavailability of detailed failure data, with those available often featuring inconsistent filtering of failure (feedback) data, and ignoring statistical errors (which are very high for rare events like reliability related failures). Very clear guidelines must be present to count and compare failures related to different type of root-causes (e.g. manufacturing-, maintenance-, transport-, system-induced or inherent design failures). Comparing different types of causes may lead to incorrect estimations and incorrect business decisions about the focus of improvement.

To perform a proper quantitative reliability prediction for systems may be difficult and very expensive if done by testing. At the individual part-level, reliability results can often be obtained with comparatively high confidence, as testing of many sample parts might be possible using the available testing budget. However, unfortunately these tests may lack validity at a system-level due to assumptions made at part-level testing. These authors emphasized the importance of initial part- or system-level testing until failure, and to learn from such failures to improve the system or part. The general conclusion is drawn that an accurate and absolute prediction — by either field-data comparison or testing — of reliability is in most cases not possible. An exception might be failures due to wear-out problems such as fatigue failures. In the introduction of MIL-STD-785 it is written that reliability prediction should be used with great caution, if not used solely for comparison in trade-off studies.

=== Design for reliability ===
Design for Reliability (DfR) is a process that encompasses tools and procedures to ensure that a product meets its reliability requirements, under its use environment, for the duration of its lifetime. DfR is implemented in the design stage of a product to proactively improve product reliability.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dfrsolutions.com/hubfs/DfR_Solutions_Website/Resources-Archived/Presentations/2016/Design-for-Reliability-Best-Practices.pdf?t=1505335343846&lt;/ref&gt; DfR is often used as part of an overall [[Design for X|Design for Excellence (DfX)]] strategy. 

====Statistics-based approach (i.e. MTBF)====
Reliability design begins with the development of a (system) [[mathematical model|model]]. Reliability and availability models use [[block diagram]]s and [[Fault Tree Analysis]] to provide a graphical means of evaluating the relationships between different parts of the system. These models may incorporate predictions based on failure rates taken from historical data. While the (input data) predictions are often not accurate in an absolute sense, they are valuable to assess relative differences in design alternatives. Maintainability parameters, for example [[Mean time to repair]] (MTTR), can also be used as inputs for such models.

The most important fundamental initiating causes and failure mechanisms are to be identified and analyzed with engineering tools. A diverse set of practical guidance as to performance and reliability should be provided to designers so that they can generate low-stressed designs and products that protect, or are protected against, damage and excessive wear. Proper validation of input loads (requirements) may be needed, in addition to verification for reliability "performance" by testing.
[[File:Fault tree.svg|thumb|280px|A fault tree diagram]]

One of the most important design techniques is [[redundancy (engineering)|redundancy]]. This means that if one part of the system fails, there is an alternate success path, such as a backup system. The reason why this is the ultimate design choice is related to the fact that high-confidence reliability evidence for new parts or systems is often not available, or is extremely expensive to obtain. By combining redundancy, together with a high level of failure monitoring, and the avoidance of common cause failures; even a system with relatively poor single-channel (part) reliability, can be made highly reliable at a system level (up to mission critical reliability). No testing of reliability has to be required for this. In conjunction with redundancy, the use of dissimilar designs or manufacturing processes (e.g. via different suppliers of similar parts) for single independent channels, can provide less sensitivity to quality issues (e.g. early childhood failures at a single supplier), allowing very-high levels of reliability to be achieved at all moments of the development cycle (from early life to long-term). Redundancy can also be applied in systems engineering by double checking requirements, data, designs, calculations, software, and tests to overcome systematic failures.

Another effective way to deal with reliability issues is to perform analysis that predicts degradation, enabling the prevention of unscheduled downtime events / failures. [[Reliability centered maintenance|RCM]] (Reliability Centered Maintenance) programs can be used for this.

====Physics-of-failure-based approach====
For electronic assemblies, there has been an increasing shift towards a different approach called [[physics of failure]]. This technique relies on understanding the physical static and dynamic failure mechanisms. It accounts for variation in load, strength, and stress that lead to failure with a high level of detail, made possible with the use of modern [[finite element method]] (FEM) software programs that can handle complex geometries and mechanisms such as creep, stress relaxation, fatigue, and probabilistic design ([[Monte Carlo Methods]]/DOE). The material or component can be re-designed to reduce the probability of failure and to make it more robust against such variations. Another common design technique is component [[derating]]: i.e. selecting components whose specifications significantly exceed the expected stress levels, such as using heavier gauge electrical wire than might normally be specified for the expected [[electric current]].

====Common tools and techniques====
Many of the tasks, techniques, and analyses used in Reliability Engineering are specific to particular industries and applications, but can commonly include:

:* [[Physics of failure]] (PoF)
:* [[Built-in test|Built-in self-test]] (BIT) (testability analysis)
:* [[Failure mode and effects analysis]] (FMEA)
:* Reliability [[hazard analysis]]
:* Reliability block-diagram analysis
:* Dynamic reliability block-diagram analysis&lt;ref&gt;Salvatore Distefano, Antonio Puliafito: Dependability Evaluation with Dynamic Reliability Block Diagrams and Dynamic Fault Trees. IEEE Trans. Dependable Sec. Comput. 6(1): 4–17 (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;
:* [[Fault tree analysis]]
:* [[Root cause analysis]]
:* Statistical engineering, [[design of experiments]] – e.g. on simulations / FEM models or with testing
:* Sneak circuit analysis
:* Accelerated testing
:* Reliability growth analysis (re-active reliability)
:* [[Weibull distribution|Weibull]] analysis (for testing or mainly "re-active" reliability)
:* [[Thermal analysis]] by finite element analysis (FEA) and / or measurement
:* Thermal induced, shock and [[vibration fatigue]] analysis by FEA and / or measurement
:* Electromagnetic analysis
:* Avoidance of [[single point of failure]] (SPOF)
:* Functional analysis and functional failure analysis (e.g., function FMEA, FHA or FFA)
:* Predictive and preventive maintenance: reliability centered maintenance (RCM) analysis
:* Testability analysis
:* Failure diagnostics analysis (normally also incorporated in FMEA)
:* Human error analysis
:* Operational hazard analysis 
:* Preventative/Planned Maintenance Optimization (PMO)
:* Manual screening
:* [[Integrated logistics support]]

Results from these methods are presented during reviews of part or system design, and logistics. Reliability is just one requirement among many for a complex part or system. Engineering trade-off studies are used to determine the [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimum]] balance between reliability requirements and other constraints.

=== The importance of language ===

Reliability engineers, whether using quantitative or qualitative methods to describe a failure or hazard, rely on language to pinpoint the risks and enable issues to be solved. The language used must help create an orderly description of the function/item/system and its complex surrounding as it relates to the failure of these functions/items/systems. Systems engineering is very much about finding the correct words to describe the problem (and related risks), so that they can be readily solved via engineering solutions. Jack Ring said that a systems engineer's job is to "language the project." (Ring et al. 2000)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.incose.org/wma/library/docs/seven_samurai-martin-paper-v040316a.pdf The Seven Samurais of Systems Engineering], James Martin (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; For part/system failures, reliability engineers should concentrate more on the "why and how", rather that predicting "when". Understanding "why" a failure has occurred (e.g. due to over-stressed components or manufacturing issues) is far more likely to lead to improvement in the designs and processes used &lt;ref name="O'Connor_2002" /&gt; than quantifying "when" a failure is likely to occur (e.g. via determining MTBF). To do this, first the reliability hazards relating to the part/system need to be classified and ordered (based on some form of qualitative and quantitative logic if possible) to allow for more efficient assessment and eventual improvement. This is partly done in pure language and [[proposition]] logic, but also based on experience with similar items. This can for example be seen in descriptions of events in [[fault tree analysis]], [[Failure mode and effects analysis|FMEA]] analysis, and hazard (tracking) logs. In this sense language and proper grammar (part of qualitative analysis) plays an important role in reliability engineering, just like it does in [[safety engineering]] or in-general within [[systems engineering]].

Correct use of language can also be key to identifying or reducing the risks of [[human error]], which are often the root cause of many failures. This can include proper instructions in maintenance manuals, operation manuals, emergency procedures, and others to prevent systematic human errors that may result in system failures. These should be written by trained or experienced technical authors using so-called simplified English or [[Simplified Technical English]], where words and structure are specifically chosen and created so as to reduce ambiguity or risk of confusion (e.g. an "replace the old part" could ambiguously refer to a swapping a worn-out part with a non worn-out part, or replacing a part with one using a more recent and hopefully improved design).

==Reliability modeling==
Reliability modeling is the process of predicting or understanding the reliability of a component or system prior to its implementation. Two types of analysis that are often used to model a complete system's availability behavior (including effects from logistics issues like spare part provisioning, transport and manpower) are Fault Tree Analysis and reliability block diagrams. At a component level, the same types of analyses can be used together with others. The input for the models can come from many sources including testing; prior operational experience; field data; as well as data handbooks from similar or related industries. Regardless of source, all model input data must be used with great caution, as predictions are only valid in cases where the same product was used in the same context. As such, predictions are often only used to help compare alternatives.

[[File:Reliability block diagram.png|300px|thumb|right|A reliability block diagram showing a "1oo3" (1 out of 3) redundant designed subsystem]]

For part level predictions, two separate fields of investigation are common:
* The [[physics of failure]] approach uses an understanding of physical failure mechanisms involved, such as mechanical [[crack propagation]] or chemical [[corrosion]] degradation or failure;
* The [[parts stress modeling]] approach is an empirical method for prediction based on counting the number and type of components of the system, and the stress they undergo during operation.
[[Software reliability]] is a more challenging area that must be considered when computer code provides a considerable component of a system's functionality.

=== Reliability theory ===
{{main article|Reliability theory|Failure rate|Survival analysis}}

Reliability is defined as the [[probability]] that a device will perform its intended function during a specified period of time under stated conditions. Mathematically, this may be expressed as,

:&lt;math&gt;R(t)=Pr\{T&gt;t\}=\int_{t}^{\infty} f(x)\, dx \ \!&lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;f(x) \!&lt;/math&gt; is the failure [[probability density function]] and &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is the length of the period of time (which is assumed to start from time zero).

There are a few key elements of this definition:

# Reliability is predicated on "intended function:" Generally, this is taken to mean operation without failure. However, even if no individual part of the system fails, but the system as a whole does not do what was intended, then it is still charged against the system reliability. The system requirements specification is the criterion against which reliability is measured.
# Reliability applies to a specified period of time. In practical terms, this means that a system has a specified chance that it will operate without failure before time &lt;math&gt;t \!&lt;/math&gt;. Reliability engineering ensures that components and materials will meet the requirements during the specified time.  Note that units other than time may sometimes be used (e.g. "a mission", "operation cycles"). 
# Reliability is restricted to operation under stated (or explicitly defined) conditions. This constraint is necessary because it is impossible to design a system for unlimited conditions. A [[Mars Rover]] will have different specified conditions than a family car. The operating environment must be addressed during design and testing. That same rover may be required to operate in varying conditions requiring additional scrutiny.
# Two notable references on reliability theory and its mathematical and statistical foundations are Barlow, R. E. and Proschan, F. (1982) and Samaniego, F. J. (2007).

=== Quantitative system reliability parameters—theory ===
Quantitative requirements are specified using reliability [[parameter]]s. The most common reliability parameter is the [[mean time to failure]] (MTTF), which can also be specified as the [[failure rate]] (this is expressed as a frequency or conditional probability density function (PDF)) or the number of failures during a given period. These parameters may be useful for higher system levels and systems that are operated frequently (i.e. vehicles, machinery, and electronic equipment). Reliability increases as the MTTF increases. The MTTF is usually specified in hours, but can also be used with other units of measurement, such as miles or cycles. Using MTTF values on lower system levels can be very misleading, especially if they do not specify the associated Failures Modes and Mechanisms (The F in MTTF).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

In other cases, reliability is specified as the probability of mission success. For example, reliability of a scheduled aircraft flight can be specified as a dimensionless probability or a percentage, as often used in [[system safety]] engineering.

A special case of mission success is the single-shot device or system. These are devices or systems that remain relatively dormant and only operate once. Examples include automobile [[airbags]], thermal [[battery (electricity)|batteries]] and [[missiles]]. Single-shot reliability is specified as a probability of one-time success or is subsumed into a related parameter. Single-shot missile reliability may be specified as a requirement for the probability of a hit. For such systems, the [[safety integrity level|probability of failure on demand]] (PFD) is the reliability measure — this is actually an "unavailability" number. The PFD is derived from failure rate (a frequency of occurrence) and mission time for non-repairable systems.

For repairable systems, it is obtained from failure rate, mean-time-to-repair (MTTR), and test interval. This measure may not be unique for a given system as this measure depends on the kind of demand. In addition to system level requirements, reliability requirements may be specified for critical subsystems. In most cases, reliability parameters are specified with appropriate statistical [[confidence interval]]s.

== Reliability testing ==
The purpose of reliability testing is to discover potential problems with the design as early as possible and, ultimately, provide confidence that the system meets its reliability requirements.

Reliability testing may be performed at several levels and there are different types of testing. Complex systems may be tested at component, circuit board, unit, assembly, subsystem and system levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
|url= http://www.eng.tau.ac.il/~bengal/SCI_paper.pdf
|title=Self-correcting inspection procedure under inspection errors

|publisher=IIE Transactions on Quality and Reliability, 34(6), pp. 529–540. 
|year=2003
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
(The test level nomenclature varies among applications.) For example, performing environmental stress screening tests at lower levels, such as piece parts or small assemblies, catches problems before they cause failures at higher levels. Testing proceeds during each level of integration through full-up system testing, developmental testing, and operational testing, thereby reducing program risk. However, testing does not mitigate unreliability risk.

With each test both a statistical type 1 and type 2 error could be made and depends on sample size, test time, assumptions and the needed discrimination ratio. There is risk of incorrectly accepting a bad design (type 1 error) and the risk of incorrectly rejecting a good design (type 2 error).

It is not always feasible to test all system requirements. Some systems are prohibitively expensive to test; some [[failure mode]]s may take years to observe; some complex interactions result in a huge number of possible test cases; and some tests require the use of limited test ranges or other resources. In such cases, different approaches to testing can be used, such as (highly) accelerated life testing, [[design of experiments]], and [[simulation]]s.

The desired level of statistical confidence also plays a role in reliability testing. Statistical confidence is increased by increasing either the test time or the number of items tested. Reliability test plans are designed to achieve the specified reliability at the specified [[confidence interval|confidence level]] with the minimum number of test units and test time. Different test plans result in different levels of risk to the producer and consumer. The desired reliability, statistical confidence, and risk levels for each side influence the ultimate test plan. The customer and developer should agree in advance on how reliability requirements will be tested.

A key aspect of reliability testing is to define "failure". Although this may seem obvious, there are many situations where it is not clear whether a failure is really the fault of the system. Variations in test conditions, operator differences, weather and unexpected situations create differences between the customer and the system developer. One strategy to address this issue is to use a scoring conference process. A scoring conference includes representatives from the customer, the developer, the test organization, the reliability organization, and sometimes independent observers. The scoring conference process is defined in the statement of work. Each test case is considered by the group and "scored" as a success or failure. This scoring is the official result used by the reliability engineer.

As part of the requirements phase, the reliability engineer develops a test strategy with the customer. The test strategy makes trade-offs between the needs of the reliability organization, which wants as much data as possible, and constraints such as cost, schedule and available resources. Test plans and procedures are developed for each reliability test, and results are documented.

Reliability testing is common in the Photonics industry. Examples of reliability tests of lasers are life test and [[burn-in]]. These tests consist of the highly accelerated aging, under controlled conditions, of a group of lasers. The data collected from these life tests are used to predict laser life expectancy under the intended operating characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Yelo Reliability Testing |url=http://www.yelo.co.uk/laser-diode-life-test/laser-diode-life-test.html|accessdate=6 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reliability test requirements ===
Reliability test requirements can follow from any analysis for which the first estimate of failure probability, failure mode or effect needs to be justified. Evidence can be generated with some level of confidence by testing. With software-based systems, the probability is a mix of software and hardware-based failures. Testing reliability requirements is problematic for several reasons. A single test is in most cases insufficient to generate enough statistical data. Multiple tests or long-duration tests are usually very expensive. Some tests are simply impractical, and environmental conditions can be hard to predict over a systems life-cycle.

Reliability engineering is used to design a realistic and affordable test program that provides empirical evidence that the system meets its reliability requirements. Statistical [[confidence interval|confidence levels]] are used to address some of these concerns. A certain parameter is expressed along with a corresponding confidence level: for example, an [[MTBF]] of 1000 hours at 90% confidence level. From this specification, the reliability engineer can, for example, design a test with explicit criteria for the number of hours and number of failures until the requirement is met or failed. Different sorts of tests are possible.

The combination of required reliability level and required confidence level greatly affects the development cost and the risk to both the customer and producer. Care is needed to select the best combination of requirements—e.g. cost-effectiveness. Reliability testing may be performed at various levels, such as component, [[subsystem]] and [[system]]. Also, many factors must be addressed during testing and operation, such as extreme temperature and humidity, shock, vibration, or other environmental factors (like loss of signal, cooling or power; or other catastrophes such as fire, floods, excessive heat, physical or security violations or other myriad forms of damage or degradation).  For systems that must last many years,  accelerated life tests may be needed.

=== Accelerated testing ===
The purpose of [[accelerated life testing|accelerated life testing (ALT test)]] is to induce field failure in the laboratory at a much faster rate by providing a harsher, but nonetheless representative, environment. In such a test, the product is expected to fail in the lab just as it would have failed in the field—but in much less time.
The main objective of an accelerated test is either of the following:
:* To discover failure modes
:* To predict the normal field life from the high [[stress testing|stress]] lab life
An Accelerated testing program can be broken down into the following steps:
:* Define objective and scope of the test
:* Collect required information about the product
:* Identify the stress(es)
:* Determine level of stress(es)
:* Conduct the accelerated test and analyze the collected data.

Common ways to determine a life stress relationship are:
:* Arrhenius model
:* Eyring model
:* Inverse power law model
:* Temperature–humidity model
:* Temperature non-thermal model

== Software reliability ==
{{further information|Software reliability|Site reliability engineering}}
Software reliability is a special aspect of reliability engineering. System reliability, by definition, includes all parts of the system, including hardware, software, supporting infrastructure (including critical external interfaces), operators and procedures. Traditionally, reliability engineering focuses on critical hardware parts of the system. Since the widespread use of digital [[integrated circuit]] technology, software has become an increasingly critical part of most electronics and, hence, nearly all present day systems.

There are significant differences, however, in how software and hardware behave. 
Most hardware unreliability is the result of a component or material failure that results in the system not performing its intended function. Repairing or replacing the hardware component restores the system to its original operating state. 
However, software does not fail in the same sense that hardware fails. Instead, software unreliability is the result of unanticipated results of software operations. Even relatively small software programs can have astronomically large [[combinations]] of inputs and states that are infeasible to exhaustively test. Restoring software to its original state only works until the same combination of inputs and states results in the same unintended result. Software reliability engineering must take this into account.

Despite this difference in the source of failure between software and hardware, several [[List of software reliability models|software reliability models]] based on statistics have been proposed to quantify what we experience with software: the longer software is run, the higher the probability that it will eventually be used in an untested manner and exhibit a latent defect that results in a failure ([[Shooman]] 1987), (Musa 2005), (Denney 2005).

As with hardware, software reliability depends on good requirements, design and implementation. Software reliability engineering relies heavily on a disciplined [[software engineering]] process to anticipate and design against [[unintended consequence]]s. There is more overlap between software [[quality assurance|quality engineering]] and software reliability engineering than between hardware quality and reliability. A good software development plan is a key aspect of the software reliability program. The software development plan describes the design and coding standards, [[software peer review|peer reviews]], [[unit test]]s, [[configuration management]], [[software metrics]] and software models to be used during software development.

A common reliability metric is the number of software faults, usually expressed as faults per thousand lines of code. This metric, along with software execution time, is key to most software reliability models and estimates. The theory is that the software reliability increases as the number of faults (or fault density) decreases or goes down. Establishing a direct connection between fault density and mean-time-between-failure is difficult, however, because of the way software faults are distributed in the code, their severity, and the probability of the combination of inputs necessary to encounter the fault. Nevertheless, fault density serves as a useful indicator for the reliability engineer. Other software metrics, such as complexity, are also used.  This metric remains controversial, since changes in software development and verification practices can have dramatic impact on overall defect rates.

Testing is even more important for software than hardware. Even the best software development process results in some software faults that are nearly undetectable until tested. As with hardware, software is tested at several levels, starting with individual units, through integration and full-up system testing. Unlike hardware, it is inadvisable to skip levels of software testing. During all phases of testing, software faults are discovered, corrected, and re-tested. Reliability estimates are updated based on the fault density and other metrics. At a system level, mean-time-between-failure data can be collected and used to estimate reliability. Unlike hardware, performing exactly the same test on exactly the same software configuration does not provide increased statistical confidence. Instead, software reliability uses different metrics, such as [[code coverage]].

Eventually, the software is integrated with the hardware in the top-level system, and software reliability is subsumed by system reliability. The Software Engineering Institute's [[capability maturity model]] is a common means of assessing the overall software development process for reliability and quality purposes.

== Comparison to safety engineering ==
Reliability engineering is concerned with overall minimisation of failures that could lead to financial losses for the responsible entity, whereas [[safety engineering]] focuses on minimising a specific set of failure types that in general could lead to large scale, widespread issues beyond the responsible entity.

Reliability hazards could transform into incidents leading to a loss of revenue for the company or the customer, for example due to direct and indirect costs associated with: loss of production due to system unavailability; unexpected high or low demands for spares; repair costs; man-hours; (multiple) re-designs; interruptions to normal production etc.&lt;ref name="Verma, Ajit Kumar 2010"&gt;Reliability and Safety Engineering – Verma, Ajit Kumar, Ajit, Srividya, Karanki, Durga Rao (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

Safety engineering is often highly specific, relating only to certain tightly regulated industries, applications, or areas. It primarily focuses on system safety hazards that could lead to severe accidents including: loss of life; destruction of equipment; or environmental damage. As such, the related system functional reliability requirements are often extremely high. Although it deals with unwanted failures in the same sense as reliability engineering, it, however, has less of a focus on direct costs, and is not concerned with post-failure repair actions. Another difference is the level of impact of failures on society, leading to a tendency for strict control by governments or regulatory bodies (e.g. nuclear, aerospace, defense, rail and oil industries).&lt;ref name="Verma, Ajit Kumar 2010"/&gt;

This can occasionally lead to safety engineering and reliability engineering having contradictory requirements or conflicting choices at a system architecture level.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} For example, in train signal control systems it is common practice to use a "fail-safe" system design concept. In this example, a [[wrong-side failure]] needs an extremely low failure rate as such failures can lead to such severe effects, like frontal collisions of two trains where a signalling failure leads to two oncoming trains on the same track being given GREEN lights. Such systems should be (and thankfully are) designed in a way that the vast majority of failures (e.g. temporary or total loss of signals or open contacts of relays) will generate RED lights for all trains. This is the safe state. This means in the event of a failure, all trains are stopped immediately. This fail-safe logic might, unfortunately, lower the reliability of the system. The reason for this is the higher risk of false tripping, as any failure whether temporary or not may be trigger such a safe – but costly – shut-down state. Different solutions can be applied for similar issues. See the section on fault tolerance below.

=== Fault tolerance ===
{{main article | Fault tolerance}}
Reliability can be increased by using "1oo2" (1 out of 2) redundancy at a part or system level. However, if both redundant elements disagree it can be difficult to know which is to be relied upon. In the previous train signalling example this could lead to lower safety levels as there are more possibilities for allowing "wrong side" or other undetected dangerous failures. Fault-tolerant systems often rely on additional redundancy (e.g. [[triple modular redundancy|2oo3 voting logic]]) where multiple redundant elements must agree on a potentially unsage action before it is performed. This increases both reliability and safety at a system level and is often used for so-called "operational" or "mission" systems. This is common practice in Aerospace systems that need continued availability and do not have a [[fail-safe]] mode. For example, aircraft may use triple modular redundancy for [[flight computer]]s and control surfaces (including occasionally different modes of operation e.g. electrical/mechanical/hydraulic) as these need to always be operational, due to the fact that there are no "safe" default positions for control surfaces such as rudders or ailerons when the aircraft is flying.

=== Basic reliability and mission (operational) reliability ===
The above example of a 2oo3 fault tolerant system increases both mission reliability as well as safety. However, the "basic" reliability of the system will in this case still be lower than a non-redundant (1oo1) or 2oo2 system. Basic reliability engineering covers all failures, including those that might not result in system failure, but do result in additional cost due to: maintenance repair actions; logistics; spare parts etc. For example, replacement or repair of 1 faulty channel in a 2oo3 voting system, (the system is still operating, although with one failed channel it has actually become a 2oo2 system) is contributing to basic unreliability but not mission unreliability. As an example, the failure of the tail-light of an aircraft will not prevent the plane from flying (and so is not considered a mission failure), but it does need to be remedied (with a related cost, and so does contribute to the basic unreliability levels).

=== Detectability and common cause failures ===
When using fault tolerant (redundant architectures) systems or systems that are equipped with protection functions, detectability of failures and avoidance of common cause failures becomes paramount for safe functioning and/or mission reliability.

== Reliability versus quality (Six Sigma) ==
[[Six Sigma]] has its roots in manufacturing. Reliability engineering is a specialty engineering part of systems engineering. The systems engineering process is a discovery process that is quite unlike a manufacturing process. A manufacturing process is focused on repetitive activities that achieve high quality outputs with minimum cost and time. The systems engineering process must begin by discovering a real (potential) problem that needs to be solved; the biggest failure that can be made in systems engineering is finding an elegant solution to the wrong problem&lt;ref&gt;[http://g2sebok.incose.org/app/mss/asset.cfm?ID=INCOSE%20G2SEBOK%202.14&amp;ST=F INCOSE SE Guidelines]&lt;/ref&gt;  (or in terms of reliability: "providing elegant solutions to the wrong root causes of system failures").

The everyday usage term "quality of a product" is loosely taken to mean its inherent degree of excellence. In industry, a more precise definition of quality as "conformance to requirements or specifications at the start of use" is used. Assuming the final product specification adequately captures the original requirements and customer/system needs, the quality level can be measured as the fraction of product units shipped that meet specifications.&lt;ref name="itl.nist.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/apr/section1/apr111.htm|title=8.1.1.1. Quality versus reliability|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Variation of this static output may affect quality and reliability, but this is not the total picture. More inherent aspects may play a role, and in some cases, these may not be readily measured or controlled by any means. At a part level microscopic material variations such as unavoidable micro-cracks and chemical impurities may over time (due to physical or chemical "loading") become macroscopic defects. At a system level, systematic failures may play a dominant role (e.g. requirement errors or software or software compiler or design flaws).

Furthermore, for more complex systems it should be questioned if derived or lower-level requirements and related product specifications are truly valid and correct? Will these result in premature failure due to excessive wear, fatigue, corrosion, and debris accumulation, or other issues such as maintenance induced failures? Are there any interactions at a system level (as investigated by for example Fault Tree Analysis)? How many of these systems still meet function and fulfill the needs after a week of operation? What performance losses occurred? Did full system failure occur? What happens after the end of a one-year warranty period? And what happens after 50 years (a common lifetime for aircraft, trains, nuclear systems, etc.)? That is where "reliability" comes in. These issues are far more complex and can not be controlled only by a standard "quality" (six sigma) way of working. They need a [[systems engineering]] approach.[Statement of creed, not fact.]

Quality is a snapshot at the start of life and mainly related to control of lower-level product specifications. This includes time-zero defects i.e. where manufacturing mistakes escaped final Quality Control. In theory the quality level might be described by a single fraction of defective products. Reliability (as a part of systems engineering) acts as more of an ongoing account of operational capabilities, often over many years. Theoretically, all items will fail over an infinite period of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/thermo/probability.html|title=The Second Law of Thermodynamics, Evolution, and Probability|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Defects that appear over time are referred to as reliability fallout. To describe reliability fallout a probability model that describes the fraction fallout over time is needed. This is known as the life distribution model.&lt;ref name="itl.nist.gov"/&gt; Some of these reliability issues may be due to inherent design issues, which may exist even though the product conforms to specifications. Even items that are produced perfectly may fail over time due to one or more failure mechanisms (e.g. due to human error or mechanical, electrical, and chemical factors). These reliability issues can also be influenced by acceptable levels of variation during initial production.

Quality is therefore related to manufacturing, and reliability is more related to the validation of sub-system or lower item requirements, (system or part) inherent design and life cycle solutions. Items that do not conform to (any) product specification will generally do worse in terms of reliability (having a lower MTTF), but this does not always have to be the case. The full mathematical quantification (in statistical models) of this combined relation is in general very difficult or even practically impossible. In cases where manufacturing variances can be effectively reduced, six sigma tools may be useful to find optimal process solutions which can increase reliability. Six Sigma may also help to design products that are more robust to manufacturing induced failures.

In contrast with Six Sigma, reliability engineering solutions are generally found by focusing on a (system) design and not on the manufacturing process. Solutions are found in different ways, such as by simplifying a system to allow more of the mechanisms of failure involved to be understood; performing detailed calculations of material stress levels allowing suitable safety factors to be determined; finding possible abnormal system load conditions and using this to increase robustness of a design to manufacturing variance related failure mechanisms. Furthermore, reliability engineering uses system-level solutions, like designing redundant and fault-tolerant systems for situations with high availability needs (see [[#Vs Safety engineering|Reliability engineering vs Safety engineering]] above).

Six-Sigma is also more quantified (measurement-based). The core of Six-Sigma is built on empirical research and statistical analysis (e.g. to find transfer functions) of directly measurable parameters. This can not be translated practically to most reliability issues, as reliability is not (easily) measurable due to being very much a function of time (large times may be involved), especially during the requirements-specification and design phases, where reliability engineering is the most efficient. Full quantification of reliability is in this phase extremely difficult or costly (due to the amount of testing required). It also may foster re-active management (waiting for system failures to be measured before a decision can be taken). Furthermore, as explained on this page, Reliability problems are likely to come from many different causes (e.g. inherent failures, human error, systematic failures) besides manufacturing induced defects.

Note: A "defect" in six-sigma/quality literature is not the same as a "failure" (Field failure | e.g. fractured item) in reliability. A six-sigma/quality defect refers generally to non-conformance with a requirement (e.g. basic functionality or a key dimension). Items can, however, fail over time, even if these requirements are all fulfilled. Quality is generally not concerned with asking the crucial question "are the requirements actually correct?", whereas reliability is.

Within an entity, departments related to Quality (i.e. concerning manufacturing), Six Sigma (i.e. concerning process control), and Reliability (product design) should provide input to each other to cover the complete risks more efficiently.

== Reliability operational assessment ==
Once systems or parts are being produced, reliability engineering attempts to monitor, assess, and correct deficiencies. Monitoring includes electronic and visual surveillance of critical parameters identified during the fault tree analysis design stage. Data collection is highly dependent on the nature of the system. Most large organizations have [[quality control]] groups that collect failure data on vehicles, equipment and machinery. Consumer product failures are often tracked by the number of returns. For systems in dormant storage or on standby, it is necessary to establish a formal surveillance program to inspect and test random samples. Any changes to the system, such as field upgrades or recall repairs, require additional reliability testing to ensure the reliability of the modification. Since it is not possible to anticipate all the failure modes of a given system, especially ones with a human element, failures will occur. The reliability program also includes a systematic [[root cause analysis]] that identifies the causal relationships involved in the failure such that effective corrective actions may be implemented. When possible, system failures and corrective actions are reported to the reliability engineering organization.

Some of the most common methods to apply to a reliability operational assessment are [[failure reporting, analysis, and corrective action system]]s (FRACAS). This systematic approach develops a reliability, safety, and logistics assessment based on failure/incident reporting, management, analysis, and corrective/preventive actions. Organizations today are adopting this method and utilizing commercial systems (such as Web-based FRACAS applications) that enable them to create a failure/incident data repository from which statistics can be derived to view accurate and genuine reliability, safety, and quality metrics.

It is extremely important for an organization to adopt a common FRACAS system for all end items. Also, it should allow test results to be captured in a practical way. Failure to adopt one easy-to-use (in terms of ease of data-entry for field engineers and repair shop engineers) and easy-to-maintain integrated system is likely to result in a failure of the FRACAS program itself.

Some of the common outputs from a FRACAS system include Field MTBF, MTTR, spares consumption, reliability growth, failure/incidents distribution by type, location, part no., serial no., and symptom.

The use of past data to predict the reliability of new comparable systems/items can be misleading as reliability is a function of the context of use and can be affected by small changes in design/manufacturing.

== Reliability organizations ==
Systems of any significant complexity are developed by organizations of people, such as a commercial [[company (law)|company]] or a [[government]] agency. The reliability engineering organization must be consistent with the company's [[organizational structure]]. For small, non-critical systems, reliability engineering may be informal. As complexity grows, the need arises for a formal reliability function. Because reliability is important to the customer, the customer may even specify certain aspects of the reliability organization.

There are several common types of reliability organizations. The project manager or chief engineer may employ one or more reliability engineers directly. In larger organizations, there is usually a product assurance or [[specialty engineering]] organization, which may include reliability, [[maintainability]], [[Quality (business)|quality]], safety, [[human factors]], [[logistics]], etc. In such case, the reliability engineer reports to the product assurance manager or specialty engineering manager.

In some cases, a company may wish to establish an independent reliability organization. This is desirable to ensure that the system reliability, which is often expensive and time-consuming, is not unduly slighted due to budget and schedule pressures. In such cases, the reliability engineer works for the project day-to-day, but is actually employed and paid by a separate organization within the company.

Because reliability engineering is critical to early system design, it has become common for reliability engineers, however, the organization is structured, to work as part of an [[integrated product team]].

== Education ==
Some universities offer graduate degrees in reliability engineering. Other reliability engineers typically have an engineering degree, which can be in any field of engineering, from an accredited university or college program. Many engineering programs offer reliability courses, and some universities have entire reliability engineering programs. A reliability engineer may be registered as a [[professional engineer]] by the state, but this is not required by most employers. There are many professional conferences and industry training programs available for reliability engineers. Several professional organizations exist for reliability engineers, including the American Society for Quality Reliability Division (ASQ-RD),&lt;ref&gt;[http://asqrd.org American Society for Quality Reliability Division (ASQ-RD)]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[IEEE Reliability Society]], the [[American Society for Quality]] (ASQ),&lt;ref&gt;[http://asq.org/cert/reliability-engineer American Society for Quality (ASQ)]&lt;/ref&gt; and the Society of Reliability Engineers (SRE).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sre.org Society of Reliability Engineers (SRE)]&lt;/ref&gt;

A group of engineers have provided a list of useful tools for reliability engineering. These include: RelCalc software, Military Handbook 217 (Mil-HDBK-217), and the NAVMAT P-4855-1A manual. Analyzing failures and successes coupled with a quality standards process also provides systemized information to making informed engineering designs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Top Tools for a Reliability Engineer's Toolbox: 7 Reliability Engineering Experts Reveal Their Favorite Tools, Tips and Resources|url = http://www.camcode.com/asset-tags/top-tools-in-a-reliability-engineers-toolbox/#badge|website = Asset Tag &amp; UID Label Blog|access-date = 2016-01-18|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Rundstrecken Challenge Nürburgring (RCN)''' (circuit racing challenge [[Nürburgring]]) or '''BMW Driving Experience Challenge''', previously known as ''Castrol-HAUGG-Cup (CHC)'', is a [[motorsport]] event series. Being run since the early 1960s mainly on the [[Nürburgring]], it is regarded as Germany's oldest [[touring car racing]] series. Unlike in regular races for position, the event that is similar to [[rallying]] on a closed race circuit, with time challenge laps and co-drivers on board.

For many years, the series was sponsored by [[Castrol]] and ''HAUGG'' (a company owned by a race driver, providing car parts like radiators). For 2007, the sponsorship arrangements were changed, putting less emphasis on these two companies.

The event is officially styled by the FIA/[[DMSB]] as a ''Leistungsprüfung 200km'' (''LP200'', performance test over 200&amp;nbsp;km). This means that the RCN is not a race for positions among cars that are started at once from a grid (like [[VLN]] endurance races), but a time trial, with cars being started one by one, about 5 seconds apart. This reduces the risks of collisions, as there is no benefit for a racer to defend his or her position.

Most RCN events are held on the [[Nürburgring]], mainly on the 20.832&amp;nbsp;km long ''Nordschleife'' version, on Saturday afternoon following a [[Gleichmäßigkeitsprüfung]] (GLP) run by the same organizing club. One or two additional events are held on the Grand Prix track, or on the combined tracks as used in VLN or at the 24h. Since 2003, some events were held on the [[Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps]]. As season highlight in front of thousands of spectators, the RCN usually runs on the Thursday before a [[24 Hours Nürburgring]] race, which is a [[holiday]], either [[Ascension Day]] or [[Corpus Christi (feast)]]. The track versions used during that event include various sections of the Grand Prix track. In 2005, the CHC was run on 4 different track versions, three of them at the [[Nürburgring]].

On the Nordschleife, 15 laps of 20.832&amp;nbsp;km have to be run, for 312&amp;nbsp;km overall (longer than an F1 race). Due to being an amateur event without practise, the first (warm up) lap, the last (cool down) and two laps in between for a pit stop are not timed, unless a generous maximum time is exceeded. Of the remaining 11 laps, 9 are run at full speed (like a [[Special stage (rallying)|special stage]] in rallying), with each second counting as one ''penalty point''. Two laps have to be done at a given time similar to a liaison stage in rallying. If the tolerance of +/- 2 seconds is exceeded, each second counts tenfold, so some discipline and precision is required. In wet conditions, these laps can decide the winners, as they can add a significant amount of ''penalty points'' to the tally.

The entry fee is about 400 Euro. As in rallying, a co-driver can be on board, a quite unique possibility to take a passenger within a circuit racing contest. Also, those two drivers can share a drive, which reduces costs for amateurs.

Championship points are awarded according to amateur rules, depending on the number of entrants in the same class. There are also an entry level "Light" classes with fewer laps, focusing on regularity, and a separate championship.

== 2006 Calendar  ==

For this season, no event on the [[Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps]] could be arranged due to construction work there. On the other hand, the Nordschleife is used 7 times, and the GP track only once. During the 24h race weekend, parts of the GP track are connected to the 20.8&amp;nbsp;km Nordschleife for a 25.3&amp;nbsp;km track.

The '''SMP F4 Championship''' (also known as the '''F4 NEZ Championship by SMP Racing''') is a racing series regulated according to [[Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile|FIA]] [[Formula 4]] regulations. It is based in the FIA's North European Zone and the Netherlands, and is only open to drivers from these countries. The inaugural season will be the [[2015 SMP F4 Championship season|2015 SMP F4 Championship]].

==History==
[[Gerhard Berger]] and the FIA Singleseater Commission launched the FIA Formula 4 in March 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FIA reveals Formula 4 plan|url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/106219|work=[[Autosport]]|accessdate=11 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of the Formula 4 is to make the ladder to [[Formula One]] more transparent. Besides sporting and technical regulations, costs are regulated too. A car to compete in this category may not exceed €30.000 in purchase. A single season in Formula 4 may not exceed €100.000 in costs. The SMP F4 will be the one of the second phase Formula 4 championship to be launched. The first phase championships was the [[Italian F4 Championship]] and the [[Formula 4 Sudamericana]] which started in 2014. The SMP championship was launched by [[SMP Racing]], the Russian Automobile Federation, [[Koiranen GP]] and [[AKK-Motorsport]] on 22 July 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.paddockscout.com/koiranen-launches-new-f4-series-for-north-europe/|title=Koiranen announces new F4 series for North Europe|last=Allen|first=Peter|date=22 July 2014|publisher=Paddock Scout|accessdate=11 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Italian race car constructor [[Tatuus]] was contracted to design and build all the cars.

The championship expanded out of the FIA North European Zone for its second season. Following the failure to establish a separate Formula 4 championship in the Benelux region, it  will incorporate two rounds in the Netherlands, and will award a Dutch Formula 4 Trophy for these two rounds plus a standalone Formula 4 Festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paddockscout.com/dutch-f4-concept-to-form-part-of-smp-series-from-2016/32855|title=Dutch F4 concept to form part of SMP series from 2016|last=Allen|first=Peter|date=8 January 2016|publisher=Paddock Scout|accessdate=10 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[MP Motorsport]] will also operate cars alongside Koiranen GP, which ran all drivers in the inaugural season.

==Car==
{{also|Tatuus F4-T014}}
The championship features [[Tatuus]] designed and built cars. The cars will be constructed out of [[carbon fibre]] and feature a [[monocoque]] chassis. The engine is a 1.4 turbo [[Abarth]]. This is the same engine as in the [[Italian F4 Championship]].

'''''Silent Night''''' is an [[opera]] by composer [[Kevin Puts]] and librettist [[Mark Campbell (writer)|Mark Campbell]]. As '''''Silent Night: Opera in Two Acts''''' the work had its [[world premiere]] at the [[Ordway Theater]], Saint Paul, Minnesota, on November 12, 2011 under the directorship and dramaturgy of [[Eric Simonson]]. As ''Silent Night'', the opera had its East Coast premiere at the Philadelphia [[Academy of Music (Philadelphia)|Academy of Music]] on February 8, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.operaphila.org/production/silent-night|title=Opera Philadelphia|accessdate=February 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It premiered in the Southwest at [[Bass Performance Hall]] with [[Fort Worth Opera]] on May 4, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fwopera.org/performances/Silent-Night/|title=Fort Worth Opera|accessdate=May 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The European premiere took place on October 24, 2014, at the [[Wexford Festival Opera]] in Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;[[Telegraph Media Group]], John Allison: "[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/opera/11192714/silent-night-wexford-festival-opera-chad-johnson-ian-beadle-scott-wilde-matthew-worth-christian-carion-joyeux-noel-tomer-zvulun-david-agler.html ''Silent Night'', Wexford Festival Opera]", review, "real conviction"; October 28, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 the work was staged at the [[Calgary Opera]] and the [[Cincinnati Opera]], and in 2015 it was performed at the [[Opéra de Montréal]] and the [[Lyric Opera of Kansas City]]. It received its West Coast premiere at [https://www.operasj.org/production/silent-night/ Opera San Jose] on February 11th, 2017. The Glimmerglass Festival presented the opera in 2018. It won the 2012 [[Pulitzer Prize for Music]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.pulitzer.org/citation/2012-Music|title=The 2012 Pulitzer Prize Winners: Music|accessdate=October 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The libretto is based on the multilingual [[screenplay]] by [[Christian Carion]] for the 2005 film ''[[Joyeux Noël]]'' that tells a story during the historical short-lived spontaneous 1914 [[Christmas truce]] between enemy combatants in [[World War I]].&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/12/arts/music/silent-night-by-kevin-puts-at-opera-philadelphia.html|author=[[Anthony Tommasini]]|title=Tenors Amid the Turmoil of War in the Trenches|work=[[The New York Times]]| date=February 11, 2013|accessdate=February 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to characters and situations, the libretto is mostly sung in English, French and German, but also some Italian and Latin.

The opera was commissioned by [[Minnesota Opera]] as part of its New Works Initiative in co-production with [[Opera Philadelphia]]. For Kevin Puts, it was his first opera, while Mark Campbell had written librettos before.&lt;ref name=phillyb&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phillyburbs.com/entertainment/local_entertainment/music/silent-night-librettist-mark-campbell-bored-at-the-opera/article_99ccfc80-95ae-58ea-b82e-005f7b27c8f2.html|author=Naila Francis|title=''Silent Night'' librettist Mark Campbell: bored at the opera|publisher=phillyburbs|date=February 6, 2013|accessdate=February 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Campbell remarked that the core message of the opera is "'War is not sustainable when you come to know your enemy as a person.' When you see that the person you might be shooting has a child or a wife or has this life at home and they’re just not the enemy, then it becomes very difficult if not impossible to sustain war."&lt;ref name=phillyb /&gt;

==Synopsis==

===Prologue===
Summer, 1914: At a [[Berlin]] opera house the performance is disrupted by the announcement of [[World War I|war]]. The life and career of the singers Anna Sørensen and Nikolaus Sprink changes, as Nikolaus has to go to war. In [[Scotland]], William urges his younger brother Jonathan to enlist. In [[Paris]], pregnant Madeleine is angry as her husband Audebert departs for war.

===Act 1===
December 23, 1914: An attack by French and Scottish soldiers on the German line fails. Nikolaus stabs a man and despairs at the violence. William is shot and dies.
In the bunker later, the soldiers are shocked by the slaughter.

December 24, 1914: In the morning, little Christmas trees are delivered to the German soldiers, a gift of the [[Kronprinz]] who is camping in a chalet nearby. Nikolaus is ordered to sing for him later and looks forward to reunite with Anna at that occasion. The French soldiers receive wine, sausages, and chocolates. The Scottish soldiers get crates of whiskey.
Later, in the evening, Anna and Nikolaus perform for the Kronprinz. Nikolaus has to return to the front, and Anna follows him.
At night, a French soldier moves out with some grenades to infiltrate the German line. Some Scottish soldiers start singing. Nikolaus responds with a Christmas song ("[[Silent Night]]"), soon the Scottish bagpiper starts to accompany him, and Nikolaus raises a Christmas tree on the bunker. The Christmas truce starts as the lieutenants agree to stop fighting until the morning. The soldiers come out and the French soldier returns without using his grenades. The soldiers intermingle, talk, and exchange provisions. Anna appears. Father Palmer conducts a mass. Anna sings of peace. Jonathan, however, finds the body of his brother and vows to take revenge.

===Act 2===
December 25, 1914: In the morning Jonathan buries his brother. A decision is made to extend the truce to allow for the burial of other soldiers.
Later in the morning Father Palmer delivers the [[last rites]] as the bodies are carried away.
During the day, the news of the truce reaches the British, French, and German headquarters. It is received with disbelief, anger, and the determination to punish the soldiers.
In the evening Horstmayer wants to arrest Nikolaus for insubordination, but Anna takes his hand and leads him across the no-man's land toward the French side. Horstmayer's order to shoot him is ignored. Nikolaus and Anna ask the French for asylum.

December 26, 1914: The British Major punishes the Scottish soldiers by transferring them to the front lines. On his order, Jonathan shoots a German soldier crossing the battlefield. The soldier is actually the Frenchman, Ponchel, in a German uniform who was disguised to cross the lines and visit his mother. The French General orders Audebert to Verdun and disbands his unit. The Kronprinz transfers the German soldiers to [[Pomerania]].
The no-man's land is empty at the end.

==Critical reception==
Puts' first opera was very well received – "a remarkable debut"'&lt;ref name=onews /&gt; it was indicated that it usually takes "a few tries to write an effective work".&lt;ref name=nyt /&gt; Larry Fuchsberg opined that "one senses that (Puts) has found his métier," admiring his ability to manage heterogeneous musical materials.&lt;ref name=onews&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.operanews.com/Opera_News_Magazine/2012/2/Reviews/ST__PAUL__Silent_Night.html|author=Larry Fuchsberg|title=Silent Night|work=[[Opera News]]|date=November 12, 2011|accessdate=February 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gale Martin called the work "a contemporary opera but not necessarily a modern opera" as it offered musicality and avoided dissonance, and thought it to be a "work crucial to the development and appreciation of opera as a relevant modern art form".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.bachtrack.com/review-opera-philadelphia-silent-night-puts |author=Gale Martin |title=Opera Philadelphia's ''Silent Night'' a resounding showcase |publisher=Bachtrack |date=February 12, 2013| accessdate=February 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The premiere run in 2011 was sold out.&lt;ref name=nyt /&gt;

==Awards==
In 2012 Kevin Puts was named the [[Pulitzer Prize]] Winner in Music for ''Silent Night: Opera in Two Acts''.

The '''Tauros Programme''', formerly known as '''TaurOs Project''', is a cooperation between the Dutch foundation [[Stichting Taurus]] and universities such as the [[Wageningen University and Research Centre]]. It is an international effort to breed a type of cattle that resembles the extinct [[aurochs]], the wild ancestor of domestic cattle, to a large extent.

The project largely uses hardy cattle breeds with superficial resemblance to the extinct aurochs. By crossbreeding and selective breeding it tries to establish similarity to the aurochs. The long-term goal is to release these Tauros cattle into [[Pleistocene rewilding|rewilding]] areas.

== Background ==
Herbivorous [[megafauna]] are considered important tools of [[conservation biology|nature conservation]] in maintaining the biodiversity of open or park-like landscapes without human interference. Therefore, it is planned to reintroduce large game in several reserves to recreate the natural dynamics of the European ecosystems. The aurochs was one of the most important European [[ungulate]]s but was hunted to extinction over most of Europe in the Middle Ages. Despite attempts at conservation, the last known pure-bred aurochs died in [[Jaktorów]] Forest, Poland in 1627.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rokosz |first=Mieczyslaw |year=1995 |title=History of the Aurochs (''Bos Taurus Primigenius'') in Poland |journal=Animal Genetics Resources Information |publisher=[[Food and Agriculture Organization]] |volume=16 |pages=5–12 |url=http://agtr.ilri.cgiar.org/agtrweb/Documents/Library/docs/agri16_95.pdf |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]] |doi=10.1017/s1014233900004582}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, so-called [[Pleistocene rewilding|rewilding]] has to work with its [[Domestication|domesticated]] descendants, of which several breeds are hardy and robust enough to fill this gap. In many grazing projects, especially in [[Germany]], [[Heck cattle]] are used, together with [[Galloway cattle|Galloway]]s and [[Highland cattle]]. Heck cattle originated in the 1920s as an attempt by [[Lutz Heck|Lutz]] and [[Heinz Heck]] to breed an aurochs look-alike from several cattle breeds. Heck cattle turned out to be a hardy breed, but are found to be considerably different from the aurochs in several aspects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Cis Van Vuure |title=Retracing the Aurochs: History, Morphology &amp; Ecology of an Extinct Wild Ox |publisher=Pensoft Pub |location= |year=2005 |pages= |isbn=954-642-235-5 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

TaurOs Project formed to achieve a breed of cattle which is closer to the aurochs than previous [[breeding back]] attempts. This is based on the idea that original features of the aurochs are still present in some less-derived cattle breeds and can be reunited by crossbreeding and selective breeding to the largest possible degree. Stichting Taurus has been running grazing projects with hardy cattle and horses for years and bought numerous cattle breeds found to be authentic for the project from southern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stichtingtaurus.nl/cStdPage.php?ref=54&amp;userID=5a026820ac22db0fc627bb00ac22f4d5 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203004127/http://www.stichtingtaurus.nl/cStdPage.php?ref=54&amp;userID=5a026820ac22db0fc627bb00ac22f4d5 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=3 December 2013 |title=Project TaurOs &amp;#124;&amp;#124; Stichting Taurus |publisher=Stichtingtaurus.nl |date= |accessdate=10 March 2012 }} &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Wikipedia:Link rot|dead link&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;]]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;http://www.taurosproject.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methods and goal ==
[[File:Limia cattle.jpg|thumb|[[Limia Cattle]] bull and cow in the Netherlands.]]
TaurOs Project uses very hardy cattle breeds, which should preferably resemble the aurochs to a useful extent. Crossbreeding and selective breeding with such breeds should create new lineages which are hoped to come close to the aurochs as much as possible and are fit for being released in European wild reserves. Not only the phenotype and robustness are in the focus of breeding, but also genetic information of the aurochs which might be preserved in these breeds is considered. 
There are variations within each breed, so selection criteria are necessary to select the individuals to be included on the project. Accordingly, studies are running parallel under the umbrella of the project, e.g., to evaluate possible [[introgression]] of wild aurochs into the European cattle population. Furthermore, the food choice and behaviour of the used breeds are examined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.eurowildlife.org/news/the-aurochs-is-coming-back-to-european-forests-and-grasslands/ |title=The Aurochs is coming back to European forests and grasslands &amp;#124; European WILDLIFE |publisher=Eurowildlife.org |date= |accessdate=10 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The breeds which are used for crossbreeding mostly stem from the [[Iberian Peninsula]] and [[Italy]]. For example, these are [[Sayaguesa Cattle]], [[Pajuna Cattle]], Italian [[Podolica]] and [[Maremmana#Maremmana primitivo|Maremmana primitivo]]. Although claimed to be genetically close to the aurochs, the [[Spanish fighting bull|Lidia breed (Spanish fighting bull)]] was not used for the project due to its aggressive behaviour.&lt;ref name='rewildingeurope:growing wings'&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.rewildingeurope.com/blog/2012-when-the-tauros-started-growing-wings/ |author=Ronald Goderie |title=2012 – when the Tauros started growing wings| publisher=rewildingeurope.com |date= |accessdate=14 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
These primitive breeds have decreased in numbers during the last decades, and some are highly endangered. Scottish [[highland cattle]] are used as well, because this breed has a long and dense coat and is very hardy. Several cross individuals have been born already.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.stichtingtaurus.nl/NIEUWS/index.php?newsPeriod=archive |title=Nieuws &amp;#124;&amp;#124; Stichting Taurus |publisher=Stichtingtaurus.nl |date= |accessdate=10 March 2012}} &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Wikipedia:Link rot|dead link&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, the genetic relationship between a number of cattle breeds and the aurochs is examined.&lt;ref name='rewildingeurope:growing wings' /&gt;

== Breeds in use and present crossbreeding results ==
[[File:Sayaguesa 1.jpg|thumb|Sayaguesa cows in Keent]]
Following robust cattle breeds are presently used:

* [[Sayaguesa Cattle]]
* [[Maremmana#Maremmana primitivo|Maremmana primitiva]]
* [[Pajuna Cattle]]
* [[Limia Cattle]]
* [[Maronesa]]
* [[Podolica]]
* [[Highland Cattle]]
* [[Tudanca Cattle]]
* [[Boškarin]]

All breeds except Boškarin are being used for breeding in the Dutch herds.  Outside of the Netherlands, mainly Sayaguesa, Maremmana, Maronesa and Boškarin are being used as founding breeds, supplemented by crossbreeds from the Dutch sites.&lt;ref name="RE-Tauros Programme 2017-02-23"&gt;Rewilding Europe: [https://www.rewildingeurope.com/tauros-programme/ “Tauros Programme.”] Continually updated webpage w/o date. Retrieved 23 February 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;  By the end of 2015, over 150 animals of the founding breeds have been used in breeding, and almost 300 cross animals have been born, among them 17 animals already of the fourth cross-generation.&lt;ref name="RE-Tauros Programme 2017-02-23" /&gt;

The '''Teatro de Cristóbal Colón''' (The Christopher Columbus Theatre), also known as the "Teatro Colón", is located in [[Bogotá]], [[Colombia]] and it is the nation's National Theatre. It was built in the Neoclassical style by the [[Italy|Italian]] architect [[Pietro Cantini]] in 1885 and inaugurated on 27 October 1892 &lt;ref name="Tourism"&gt;Bogota Institute of Tourism website&lt;/ref&gt; on the occasion of the fourth centenary of the discovery of America with a performance of [[Verdi]]'s ''[[Ernani]]''.

The auditorium was constructed in the tradition horseshoe-shape and modelled on the layout of the [[Palais Garnier]] in Paris, but only about half the size.&lt;ref name="Tourism"/&gt;

The Colón Theatre was declared a National Monument on 11 August 1975, and underwent renovations for three years.&lt;ref name="Tourism"/&gt;

Between 2009 and 2010, the theatre was closed for extensive renovations.&lt;ref name="Colon"/&gt;

'''''The Bang-Bang Club''''' is a 2010 Canadian-South African [[Biographical film|biographical]] [[drama film]] written and directed by [[Steven Silver (film director)|Steven Silver]] and stars [[Ryan Phillippe]] as [[Greg Marinovich]], [[Malin Åkerman]] as Robin Comley, [[Taylor Kitsch]] as [[Kevin Carter]], [[Frank Rautenbach]] as [[Ken Oosterbroek]] and Neels Van Jaarsveld as [[João Silva (photographer)|João Silva]]. They portray the lives of four [[Photojournalism|photojournalists]] active within the townships of [[South Africa]] during the [[Apartheid]] period, particularly between 1990 and 1994, from when [[Nelson Mandela]] was released from prison to the 1994 elections.

It is a [[film adaptation]] of the book ''[[The Bang-Bang Club (book)|The Bang-Bang Club: Snapshots from a Hidden War]]'' co-written by Greg Marinovich and João Silva who were part of the group of four photographers known as [[Bang-Bang Club]], the other two members being Kevin Carter and Ken Oosterbroek.

==Plot==
The film tells the story of four young men and the extremes they went to in order to capture their pictures in the days prior to the downfall of [[apartheid]] in South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tribute.ca/tiff/index.php/2010/09/16/steven-silver-frank-rautenbach-the-bang-bang-club/ ''Tribute.ca'': Steven Silver &amp; Frank Rautenbach ''The Bang Bang Club'' Interview]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cast==

* [[Ryan Phillippe]] as [[Greg Marinovich]]
* [[Malin Åkerman]] as Robin Comley
* [[Taylor Kitsch]] as [[Kevin Carter]]

;Other roles
* Patrick Lyster as [[James Nachtwey]]
* Russel Savadier as Ronald Graham
* [[Alf Kumalo]] as himself

==Distribution==
The film had its world premiere at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]] (TIFF).&lt;ref&gt;[http://tiff.net/filmsandschedules/tiff/2010/bangbangclub TIFF: The Bang-Bang Club]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Evans2010&gt;{{Citation

[[Tribeca Film]] acquired American distribution rights. It was released theatrically in the US on 22 April 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/risky-business/tribeca-fest-makes-bang-bang-172371 Tribeca Fest Makes 'The Bang Bang Club' and 'Last Night' Available on VOD ]&lt;/ref&gt; According to The Numbers, the film was only shown in nine theatres in the US where it earned $124,791.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.the-numbers.com/movie/Bang-Bang-Club-The "The Bang Bang Club"], The Numbers.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
[[Judith Matloff]], a veteran foreign correspondent and contributing editor at ''[[Columbia Journalism Review]]'' said in her review of the film that it is "the latest Hollywood production to get the role of the conflict correspondent wrong".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.linkedin.com/in/judith-matloff-26439933/?ppe=1 Judith Matloff&lt;/ref&gt; Matloff wrote: "But the reporters and photographers stationed in South Africa at the time were also compassionate human beings who exposed themselves to danger because they wanted to record history. This doesn't particularly come through in the film. Instead, Silver plays to the Hollywood stereotype of journalists as heartless outsiders. After a fun day taking pictures of black people massacring each other, the lads go back to the white suburbs and party — the implication being that the bloodshed is a game to them."&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.cjr.org/review/bang_bang_off_target.php]  Judith Matloff: Bang Bang Off Target. Columbia Journalism Review, CJR, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Matloff worked with Marinovich and knew Silva, as she was a member of the Johannesburg press corps in the early 1990s. She said of her experiences, "The film depicts the photographers as reckless thrill-seekers, swaggering into newsrooms like rock stars and canoodling with babes, when not jumping into cars to chase 'Bang Bang' (violence)". In her review Matloff said that Marinovich had disassociated himself from the film version. "It has the same title but it is not the same story. It's not my life. I don't see the character as me."{{fact|date=September 2018}}

Miriam Brent in her review for ''[[The Guardian]]'' said "Frustratingly, though, while the film poses pertinent questions about when to put the camera down, it shies away from delving deeper into these moral dilemmas and the emotional strain faced by combat photographers. Instead we're introduced to a testosterone-fuelled world in which dodging bullets is just another way of getting kicks before the partying starts. … It's just a shame the accomplished cinematography isn't matched by a script that lets the true bravery and accomplishments of combat photojournalists shine through, as they deserve."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/apr/25/bang-bang-club-review] Miriam Brent: The Bang Bang Club – review. The Guardian, London, UK  25 April 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Some more reviewers critiqued the missing of the real characters of the members of the [[Bang-Bang Club]] in the film. João Silva was asked in an interview for the French magazine ''[[Paris Match]]'' about the film. His answer described  Michel Peyrard with the words:

{{quote|''Plus tard, le livre est devenu un film, dans lequel le photographe ne se reconnaît guère, et João a poursuivi sa route. Seul, désormais.''

Later, the book became a film, in which the photographer hardly recognizes himself, and João continued his journey alone now.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parismatch.com/Culture/Art/Joao-Silva-La-passion-intacte-526071  ''Paris Match'', Michel Peyrard: João Silva. La passion intacte. (published 31 August 2013]{{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

''The Bang Bang Club'' received mixed reviews. It holds a 49% rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 45 reviews, while the audience rating is 60% (as of April 2016).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/bang_bang_club/ "The Bang Bang Club"], Rotten Tomatoes&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wasteland Weekend''' is an annual festival held in [[California City, California]]. The event is listed as a full immersion event, with all participants required to adhere to the set theme. First held in 2010, it has since been held annually in September. In 2018, Wasteland Weekend was held between September 26th and September 30th.

==History==
Wasteland Weekend has been held annually since 2010. It has grown from approximately 700 attendees in 2010 to approximately 2500 in 2015.&lt;ref name=DM2015&gt;{{cite web|title=Mad Max, the festival|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3251766/Festival-inspired-Mad-Max-movies-sees-enthusiasts-try-survive-post-apocalyptic-world-middle-desert.html|publisher=Daily Mail|accessdate=14 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mad Max Fans Hit the Desert for Apocalyptic Weekend|url=https://www.wired.com/2011/09/mad-max-wasteland-weekend/|publisher=Wired|accessdate=14 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Drawing on ''[[Mad Max (franchise)|Mad Max]]''-themed events in other countries, as well as previous events known as "Roadwar USA", the first event was held in October at Soggy Dry Lake in [[Johnson Valley, California]]. It was organized by founder Karol Bartoszynski and club promoter Jim Howard. The event featured exhibitions of movie replica cars and bikes, a gyrocopter flyover, vendors, fire dancers, and contests.&lt;ref name=SDR&gt;{{cite web|title=Wasteland Weekend|url=http://www.sandiegoreader.com/news/2010/jun/16/blurt3/|publisher=San Diego Reader|accessdate=15 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, the event expanded from four to five days, beginning on the last Wednesday of September.&lt;ref name=WWW /&gt; Wasteland Weekend 2017 was featured in the second season of ''[[The_Boulet Brothers%27 Dragula#Season 2 (2017–2018)|The Boulet Brothers' Dragula]]'', in which the four remaining competitors had to take part in a photoshoot in a nearby desert and perform as a group at Wasteland Weekend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet |user=WastelandHQ |number=941533996986650624 |date=14 December 2017 |title=The latest episode of the Boulet Bros' show Dragula (season 2) was filmed at Wasteland 2017.

==Theme==
The theme of Wasteland Weekend draws heavily from [[apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction]], especially the ''Mad Max'' franchise, and requires all attendees to wear appropriately themed clothing. In the early years Wasteland Weekend was sub titled "Mad Max fun in the California sun".
Other influences include the [[Fallout (series)|''Fallout'' series]] of video games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wasteland Weekend Theme &amp; Costume Guidelines|url=http://www.wastelandweekend.com/about/theme/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://nerdist.com/witness-the-very-best-wasteland-weekend-2015-photos/&lt;/ref&gt;
