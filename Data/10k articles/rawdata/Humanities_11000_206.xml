He was professor at [[Saint Petersburg State University]] an co-founder of [[Tbilisi State University]].

Zagareli was born in [[Kaspi]], Georgia. He studied at the [[University of Tübingen]], [[University of Vienna|Vienna]], [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich|Munich]], and [[Saint Petersburg State University|Saint Petersburg]]. In 1869 he became a member of [[Landsmannschaft Schottland]]. Zagareli habilitated at age 27 at the Saint Petersburg State University. There he became a docent for Georgian Literature and later professor for Oriental Languages. [[Nicholas Marr]] was one of his most famous students. Zagareli remained  at the Georgian language department at Saint Petersburg for over half a century, until his return to Georgia in 1922. The nearly 80-year-old Zagareli left Russia to take up academic positions at Tbilisi State University.

He died in Tbilisi and was interred at the [[Mtatsminda Pantheon]].

'''Arsenical bronze''' is an [[alloy]] in which [[arsenic]], as opposed to or in addition to [[tin]] or other constituent [[metals]], is added to [[copper]] to make [[bronze]]. The use of arsenic with copper, either as the secondary constituent or with another component such as tin, results in a stronger final product and better [[casting]] behaviour.&lt;ref name="Charles, 1967" &gt;{{cite journal

Copper ore is often naturally contaminated with arsenic; hence, the term "arsenical bronze" when used in [[archaeology]] is typically only applied to alloys with an arsenic content higher than 1% by weight, in order to distinguish it from potentially accidental additions of arsenic.&lt;ref&gt;P Budd and B S Ottoway. 1995. Eneolithic Arsenical copper – chance or choice?

Although arsenical bronze occurs in the [[archaeological record]] across the globe, the earliest [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] so far known, dating from the [[5th millennium BC]], have been found on the [[Iranian plateau]].&lt;ref name="Thornton, 2002" &gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to what extent its use arose simply from its presence in copper ores that were then treated by [[smelting]] to produce the metal.

Reconstructing a possible sequence of events in prehistory involves considering the structure of copper ore deposits, which are mostly sulphides.&lt;ref name="Tylecote, 1992" &gt;{{cite book
 |last=Tylecote |first=R.F. 
 |year=1992

 |ref=Tylecote, 1992
 | isbn = 0-901462-88-8
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The surface minerals would contain some [[native copper]] and oxidised minerals, but much of the copper and other minerals would have been washed further into the ore body, forming a secondary enrichment zone. This includes many minerals such as [[tennantite]], with their arsenic, copper and [[iron]]. Thus, the surface deposits would have been used first; with some work, deeper sulphidic ores would have been uncovered and worked, and it would have been discovered that the material from this level had better properties.

Using these various ores, there are four possible methods that may have been used to produce arsenical bronze alloys.&lt;ref name="Thornton, 2002" /&gt; These are:
* The direct addition of arsenic-bearing metals or ores such as [[realgar]] to molten copper.
: This method, although possible, lacks evidence.

* The [[redox|reduction]] of [[antimony]]-bearing [[copper arsenate]]s or [[fahlore]] to produce an alloy high in arsenic and antimony.
: This is entirely practicable.

* The reduction of roasted copper sulfarsenides such as tennantite and [[enargite]].
: This method would result in the production of toxic fumes of [[arsenous oxide]] and the loss of much of the arsenic present in the ores.&lt;ref name="Lechtman, 1996" /&gt;

* The co-smelting of oxidic and sulphidic ores such as [[malachite]] and [[arsenopyrite]] together.
: This method has been demonstrated to work well, with little in the way of dangerous fumes given off during it, because of the reactions together among the different minerals.&lt;ref name="Lechtman &amp; Klein, 1999" /&gt;

Furthermore, greater sophistication of metal workers is suggested by Thornton et al.&lt;ref name="Thornton, 2009" &gt;{{cite journal
 |last=Thornton |first=C.P.
 |last2=Rehren |first2=T.

 |pages=308–316
 |ref=Thornton, 2009
 |doi=10.1016/j.jas.2008.09.017
}}&lt;/ref&gt; They suggest that iron arsenide was deliberately produced as part of the copper-smelting process, to be traded and used to make arsenical bronze elsewhere by addition to molten copper.

Artifacts made of arsenical bronze cover the complete spectrum of metal objects, from axes to ornaments. The method of manufacture involved heating the metal in crucibles, and casting it into moulds made of stone or clay. After solidifying, it would be polished or, in the case of axes and other tools, [[work hardening|work-hardened]] by beating the working edge with a hammer, thinning out the metal and increasing its strength.&lt;ref name="Tylecote, 1992" /&gt; Finished objects could also be engraved or decorated as appropriate.

== Advantages of arsenical bronze ==
Whilst arsenic was most likely originally mixed with copper as a result of the ores already containing it, its use probably continued for a number of reasons. Firstly, it acts as a de-oxidiser, reacting with [[oxygen]] in the hot metal to form arsenous oxides which vaporise from the liquid metal. If a great deal of oxygen is dissolved in liquid copper, when the metal cools the copper oxide separates out at grain boundaries, and greatly reduces the [[ductility]] of the resulting object. However, its use can lead to a greater risk of porous castings, owing to the solution of [[hydrogen]] in the molten metal and its subsequent loss as a bubble (although any bubbles could be forge-welded and still leave the mass of the metal ready to be work-hardened).&lt;ref name="Charles, 1967" /&gt;

Secondly, the alloy is capable of greater work-hardening than is the case with pure copper, so that it performs better when used for cutting or chopping. An increase in work-hardening capability arises with an increasing percentage of arsenic, and the bronze can be work-hardened over a wide range of temperatures without fear of embrittlement.&lt;ref name="Charles, 1967" /&gt; Its improved properties over pure copper can be seen with as little as 0.5 to 2&amp;nbsp;wt% As, giving a 10-to-30% improvement in hardness and tensile strength.&lt;ref name="Lechtman, 1996" &gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thirdly, in the correct percentages, it can contribute a silvery sheen to the article being manufactured. There is evidence of arsenical bronze daggers from the [[Caucasus]] and other artifacts from different locations having an arsenic-rich surface layer which may well have been produced deliberately by ancient craftsmen,&lt;ref&gt;Ryndina, N. 2009. The potential of metallography in investigations of early objects made of copper and copper-based alloys. Journal of the historical metallurgy society. 43, 1-18.&lt;/ref&gt; and Mexican bells were made of copper with sufficient arsenic to colour them silver.&lt;ref name="Lechtman, 1996" /&gt;

== Arsenical bronze, sites and civilisations ==
[[File:Reproductions of bronze age knives made from arsenic and tin bronze.jpg|thumb|right|Reproductions of bronze age knives made from high arsencial bronze (left) and tin bronze (center and right). Depending on the content of arsenic, the alloy is of pale red to silverish colour.]]
Arsenical bronze was used by many societies and cultures across the globe. Firstly, the [[Iranian plateau]], followed by the adjacent Mesopotamian area, together covering modern Iran, Iraq and Syria, has the earliest arsenical bronze metallurgy in the world, as previously mentioned. It was in use from the [[4th millennium BC]] through to mid [[2nd millennium BC]], a period of nearly 2,000 years. There was a great deal of variation in arsenic content of artefacts throughout this period, making it impossible to say exactly how much was added deliberately and how much came about by accident.&lt;ref name="De Ryck, 2005" /&gt; Societies using arsenical bronze include the [[Akkadians]], those of [[Ur]], and the [[Amorites]], all based around the [[Tigris]] and [[Euphrates]] rivers and centres of the trade networks which spread arsenical bronze across the Middle East during the Bronze Age.&lt;ref name="De Ryck, 2005" /&gt;

The [[Chalcolithic]]-period hoard from [[Nahal Mishmar]] in the [[Judean Desert]] west of the [[Dead Sea]] contains a number of arsenical bronze (4–12% arsenic) and perhaps [[arsenical copper]] artifacts made using the [[Lost-wax casting|lost-wax process]], the earliest known use of this complex technique. "Carbon-14 dating of the reed mat in which the objects were wrapped suggests that it dates to at least 3500 B.C. It was in this period that the use of copper became widespread throughout the Levant, attesting to considerable technological developments that parallel major social advances in the region."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/nahl/hd_nahl.htm The Nahal Mishmar Treasure] at [[Metropolitan Museum]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Sulfide deposits frequently are a mix of different metal sulfides, such as copper, zinc, silver, lead, arsenic and other metals. (Sphalerite (ZnS2), for example, is not uncommon in copper sulfide deposits, and the metal smelted would be brass, which is both harder and more durable than copper.) The metals could theoretically be separated out, but the alloys resulting were typically much stronger than the metals individually.

The use of arsenical bronze spread along trade routes into North western China, to the region [[Gansu]] – [[Qinghai]], with the [[Siba culture|Siba]], [[Qijia culture|Qijia]] and [[Tianshanbeilu culture]]s. However it is still unclear as to whether arsenical bronze artefacts were imported or made locally, although the latter is suspected as being more likely due to possible local exploitation of mineral resources. On the other hand, the artefacts show typological connections to the Eurasian steppe.&lt;ref&gt;Jianjun Mei, page 9 in Metallurgy and Civilisation, Eurasia and beyond, ed: Jianjun Mei and Thilo Rehren. Proceedings of the 6th international conference on the beginnings of the use of meals and alloys (BUMA VI), 2009, Archetype publications, London.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Eneolithic period in [[Northern Italy]], with the Remedello and Rinaldone cultures in 2800 to 2200 BC, saw the use of arsenical bronze. Indeed, it seems that arsenical bronze was the most common alloy in use in the Mediterranean basin at this time.&lt;ref&gt;Eaton, E. R. 1980. Early metallurgy in Italy. In: ed. [[William Andrew Oddy|W.A. Oddy]], ''Aspects of early metallurgy'', occasional paper 17, British Museum Publications, London.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[South America]], arsenical bronze was the predominant alloy in Ecuador and north and central Peru, because of the rich arsenic bearing ores present there. By contrast, the south and central Andes, southern Peru, Bolivia and parts of Argentina, were rich in the tin ore [[Cassiterite]] and thus did not use arsenical bronze.&lt;ref name="Lechtman, 1996" /&gt;

The [[Sican Culture]] of northwestern coastal Peru is famous for its use of arsenical bronze during the period 900 to 1350 AD.&lt;ref name="Gerhard, 1998" &gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arsenical bronze co-existed with tin bronze for in the Andes, probably due to its greater ductility which meant it could be easily hammered into thin sheets which were valued in local society.&lt;ref name="Lechtman, 1996" /&gt;

== Arsenical bronze after the Bronze Age ==
The archaeological record in [[Egypt]], [[Peru]] and the Caucasus suggests that arsenical bronze was produced for a time alongside tin bronze. At Tepe Yahya its use continued into the Iron Age for the manufacture of trinkets and decorative objects,&lt;ref name="Thornton, 2002" /&gt; thus demonstrating that there was not a simple succession of alloys over time, with superior new alloys replacing older ones. There are few real advantages metallurgically for the superiority of tin bronze,&lt;ref name="Charles, 1967" /&gt; and early authors suggested that arsenical bronze was phased out due to its health effects. It is more likely that it was phased out in general use because alloying with tin gave castings which had similar strength to arsenical bronze but did not require further work-hardening to achieve useful strength.&lt;ref name="Tylecote, 1992" /&gt; It is also probable that more certain results could be achieved with the use of tin, because it could be added directly to the copper in specific amounts, whereas the precise amount of arsenic being added was much harder to gauge due to the manufacturing process.&lt;ref name="Lechtman, 1996" /&gt;

== Health effects of arsenical bronze use ==
Arsenic is an element with a [[vaporization]] point of 615&amp;nbsp;°C, such that arsenical oxide will be lost from the melt before or during casting, and fumes from fire setting for mining and ore processing have long been known to attack the eyes, lungs and skin.&lt;ref name="Harper, 1987" &gt;{{cite journal

Chronic arsenic poisoning leads to [[peripheral neuropathy]], which can cause weakness in the legs and feet. It has been speculated that this lay behind the legend of lame smiths, such as the Greek god [[Hephaestus]].

This, along with Ötzi's copper axe blade, which is 99.7% pure copper, has led scientists to speculate that he was involved in copper [[smelting]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Iceman's final meal|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/2262615.stm|publisher=BBC News |date=16 September 2002|author1=&lt;Please add first missing authors to populate metadata.&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern uses of arsenical bronze ==
Arsenical bronze has seen little use in the modern period. It appears that the closest equivalent goes by the name of [[arsenical copper]], defined as copper with under 0.5&amp;nbsp;wt% As, below the accepted percentage in archaeological artefacts. The presence of 0.5&amp;nbsp;wt% arsenic in copper lowers the electrical conductivity to 34% of that of pure copper, and even as little as 0.05&amp;nbsp;wt% decreases it by 15%.&lt;ref name="Lechtman, 1996" /&gt;

Students of '''Ascended Master Teachings''' organizations (also known as '''Ascended Master Activities''') believe that their doctrine has been given to humanity by the [[Ascended master|Ascended Masters]], individuals believed to have lived in physical bodies, acquired the wisdom and mastery needed to become immortal and free of the cycles of "re-embodiment" and karma, and have attained their "ascension", a state of "one-ness" with [[God]]. This knowledge is believed to have previously been taught for millions of years only within "Ascended master retreats" and "Mystery schools".

Adherents of the Ascended Master Teachings believe that this wisdom was partially released by the [[Theosophical Society]] beginning in 1875, by [[C.W. Leadbeater]] and [[Alice A. Bailey]], and began to have more detailed public release in the 1930s by the ''Ascended Masters'' through [[Guy Ballard]] in the [[I AM Activity]].&lt;ref name="The_Magic_Presence"&gt;King, Godfre Ray. ''The Magic Presence''. Saint Germain Press 1935. page 89, 95&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Law_of_Life_I"&gt;Luk, A.D.K.. ''Law of Life - Book I''. Pueblo, Colorado: A.D.K. Luk Publications 1989, pages 1 - 78, 91 - 102, 120 - 143, 215 - 216&lt;/ref&gt; However, Theosophists maintain the concept of ''Ascended Masters'' are a corruption of the original Theosophical concept of the [[Masters of the Ancient Wisdom]].

The term ''Ascended Master'' was first introduced in 1934 by Guy Ballard with the publication of ''Unveiled Mysteries'', a book which he said was dictated to him by the Ascended Master: [[St. Germain (Theosophy)|St. Germain]].&lt;ref&gt;King, Godfre Ray. ''Unveiled Mysteries''. Chicago, Illinois: Saint Germain Press 1934 page vii: "The time has arrived, when the Great Wisdom, held and guarded for many centuries in the Far East, is now to come forth in America, at the command of those Great Ascended Masters who direct and protect the evolution of mankind upon this Earth."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Saint Germain Foundation.

==Universal All-Pervading Presence of Life==

Students of the Ascended Master Teachings believe that there is One God, the "Universal All-Pervading Presence of Life", "The One", Who is the Source of all Life, Light, and Love in existence, and that all forms of existence and consciousness emanate from this "Allness of God" - "The One". ''The Voice of the I AM'' states "All Life is One" &lt;ref&gt;''The Voice of the I AM''. Saint Germain Press December 1940 page 32&lt;/ref&gt; and that there is "One Substance, One Energy, One Power, One Intelligence" as the Source of all consciousness and creation.&lt;ref&gt;''The Voice of the I AM''. Saint Germain Press July 1942 page 7&lt;/ref&gt; This Divine Being and Mind is considered to be above and distinct from all creation (in the sense of classical [[theism]]), transcending all creation yet interpenetrating all existence. Belief in this "One God" stresses the essential unity of the spiritual and material components of the universe. God creates through Individualized Identities that have distinct Self-Consciousness and that make up the Spiritual Hierarchy of Creation, yet remain connected through the flow of the "River of Life" and "Lifestream" to the "One Undivided God" - the "All in All" - the "Good" - the "Source from which all Life, Light, and Love come." There is always an uninterrupted "Oneness" that is maintained with the "Allness" of God. From the "One God" all other realities, including hierarchy, humanity and the material universe, are the result of a process of emanation.&lt;ref name="Law_of_Life_I" /&gt;

==The Individualized "I AM" Presence==

Adherents of the Ascended Master Teachings believe that each person is an incarnation of an "Individualized Presence" of the "Most High Living God" - the "Mighty I AM Presence" - as part of our very Nature and Being. God (as Life and Love) manifests in the 7 octaves of the created universe through individual Divine Identities. As embodied individuals, we are the outer expression of that God Self in form. It is our unique and immortal True Identity, yet always sharing in the Allness of the ONE GOD.&lt;ref name="Law_of_Life_I" /&gt;

[[St. Germain (Theosophy)|Ascended Master Saint Germain]], believed by those adherent to the Ascended Master Teachings to have previously been embodied as [[Plato]], [[Proclus]], [[Roger Bacon]], [[Francis Bacon]], and numerous others, was quoted as saying:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"When one individualizes within the Absolute, All-Pervading Life, he chooses of his own [[free will]] to become an intensified individual focus of Self-Conscious Intelligence. He is the conscious director of his future activities. Thus, having once made his choice, he is the only one who can fulfill that Destiny — which is not inflexible circumstance but a definitely designed Plan of Perfection." &lt;ref name="Unveiled_Mysteries"&gt;King, Godfre Ray. ''[http://www.sacred-texts.com/eso/um/index.htm Unveiled Mysteries]''. Saint Germain Press 1934. pages 42, 97, 136 - 137, 142, 167 - 168, 171 - 172, 225 - 226, 228, 236&lt;/ref&gt; When You, the 'Mighty I AM Presence,' will to come forth into an Individualized Focus of Conscious Dominion and use the Creative Word, 'I AM,' Your First Individual Activity is the Formation of a Flame. Then you, the 'Individualized Focus' of the 'Mighty I AM Presence,' begin your Dynamic Expression of Life. This Activity, We term Self-consciousness, meaning the Individual who is conscious of his Source and Perfection of Life, expressing through himself." &lt;ref name="The_Magic_Presence" /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Twin Flames==

Saint Germain explained through Guy Ballard:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The 'Almighty God Flame,' breathing within Itself, projects Two Rays into the 'Great Sea of Pure Electronic Light.' This Intelligent Light-substance becomes the clothing, as it were, for these Rays of the 'Mighty I AM Presence.' Each Ray has all the Attributes of the Godhead within It, and no imperfection can ever enter into or register upon It. The Individualized Flame sends down into each Ray a Focal Point, or Spark, forming a Heart Center upon which gathers the 'Electronic Light Substance,' creating the Electronic Body." &lt;ref name="The_Magic_Presence" /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1937, ''The Voice of the I AM'' article on this subject elaborated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"When the Ascension of both has taken place, each is the complete balance of all masculine and all feminine qualities within himself. Then the Threefold Flame of Life is completely unfolded, the individual becomes Master at Cosmic Levels of creation and does work with [[Planetary system|systems of worlds]], as well as in this physical world. Thus, that which came out of the Great Central Sun as One Flame becomes Three complete Flames, each of the same full Limitless Power and Activity as the Great Central Sun. This becomes the Cosmic Activity of the Power of the 'Three times Three'. "When both Rays have made the Ascension, then the individual works with systems of worlds instead of just in one world. This is the way the Godhead is ever expanding the Perfection of Itself throughout Infinity and keeping order throughout [[interstellar medium|interstellar space]]." &lt;ref&gt;''The Voice of the I AM''. Saint Germain Press July 1937 pages 9 - 17&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Beliefs about Ascended Masters==

It is believed that Ascended Masters are individuals who were once embodied on Earth and learned the lessons of life in their incarnations. They gained mastery over the limitations of the matter planes, balanced at least 51% of negative karma, and fulfilled their [[Dharma]] (Divine Plan). An Ascended Master has become God-like and a source of unconditional Love to all life, and through the Ascension has united with his or her own God Self, the "I AM" Presence. It is claimed that they serve as the teachers of mankind from the realms of Spirit, and that all people will eventually attain their Ascension and move forward in spiritual evolution beyond this planet. According to these teachings, they remain attentive to the spiritual needs of humanity, and act to inspire and motivate its spiritual growth. In many traditions and organizations, they are considered part of the Spiritual Hierarchy for Earth, and members of the Great Brotherhood of Light, also known as the Great White Lodge or [[Great White Brotherhood]].&lt;ref name="Law_of_Life_I" /&gt;

Belief in the Brotherhood and the Masters is an essential part of the beliefs of various organizations that have continued and expanded the concepts released in the original Saint Germain instruction in the 1930s through [["I Am" Activity|The "I AM" Activity]].&lt;ref&gt;''I AM Ascended Master Dictation List'' Saint Germain Press Inc., 1995, Listing of those who are claimed to be Ascended Masters by The I AM Activity&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schroeder, Werner ''Ascended Masters and Their Retreats'' Ascended Master Teaching Foundation 2004, Listing of those who are believed to be Ascended Masters by The I AM Activity and The Bridge to Freedom&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Luk, A.D.K..

Luk Publications 1989, Listing of those who are claimed to be Ascended Masters by The I AM Activity and The Bridge to Freedom&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Booth, Annice ''The Masters and Their Retreats '' Summit Lighthouse Library June 2003, Listing of those who are believed to be Ascended Masters by The I AM Activity, The Bridge to Freedom, and The Summit Lighthouse&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shearer, Monroe &amp; Carolyn ''I AM Adorations, Affirmations &amp; Rhythmic Decrees'' Acropolis Sophia Books and Works 1998, Listing of those who are claimed to be Ascended Masters by The I AM Activity, The Bridge to Freedom, The Summit Lighthouse, and The Temple of The Presence&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of those believed by the ones proposing these teachings to be Ascended Masters would be the [[Master Jesus]], [[Confucius]], [[Gautama Buddha]], [[Mary the Mother of Jesus]], St. [[Paul of Tarsus]] (aka [[Master Hilarion|Hilarion]]), Melchizedek, [[Archangel Michael]], [[Metatron]],  [[Kuan Yin|Kwan Yin]], [[St. Germain (Theosophy)|Saint Germain]] and [[Kuthumi]], as well as dozens of others.&lt;ref&gt;Prophet, Mark L. and Elizabeth Clare  ''Lords of the Seven Rays'' Livingston, Montana, U.S.A.:1986 - Summit University Press - Profiles of the Ascended Masters Pages 13-394--Lists more than 250 different Ascended Masters&lt;/ref&gt;

''Unveiled Mysteries'' records:

&lt;blockquote&gt;

"Truly the Great Ascended Masters are Gods. It is no wonder in the mythology of the ancients that their activities have been brought down to us in the guise of myth and fable. They wield Tremendous God Power at all times because they hold with unwavering determination to the Great God Presence and hence all Power is given unto them for they are All-Perfection.
"'When Jesus said, ''All these things I have done, ye shall do and even greater things shall ye do,'' he knew whereof he spoke,' continued Saint Germain. 'He came forth to reveal the Conscious Dominion and Mastery that it is possible for every human being to attain and express  while still here on Earth." &lt;ref name="Unveiled_Mysteries" /&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Great Sea of Universal Light, Life, and Love==

''Unveiled Mysteries'' states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Try to think upon this Power, which is within you. Call into use the Great Sea of Universal Substance from which you may draw without limit. It obeys, without exception, the direction of thought, and records any quality imposed upon it, through the activity of the feeling nature in mankind. Universal Substance is obedient to your conscious will at all times. It is constantly responding to humanity's thought and feeling whether they realize it or not. There is no instant at which human beings are not giving this Substance one quality or another, and it is only through the knowledge that the individual has conscious control and manipulation of a Limitless Sea of It that he begins to understand the possibilities of his own Creative Powers, and the responsibilities resting upon him in the use of his thought and feeling." &lt;ref name="Unveiled_Mysteries" /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Spiritual Hierarchy==
{{Main|Spiritual Hierarchy}}
Adherents of these ''Ascended Master Teachings'' believe that the All-Pervading Presence of God does not act nor create except through Its Individualizations. All creation comes forth through These Individual Identities and is sustained by Them. According to Elizabeth Clare Prophet, this [[Spiritual Hierarchy]] is a "[[Great chain of being|Universal Chain]]" of Individualized God Free Beings fulfilling Attributes and Aspects of God's Infinite Selfhood.  Included in this Cosmic Hierarchical scheme are [[Spiritual Hierarchy#Cosmic beings functioning within the Sun|Solar Logoi]], [[Spiritual Hierarchy#Cosmic beings attendant to the Sun|Elohim]], Sons and Daughters of God, [[Ascended Master]]s, [[Spiritual Hierarchy#Cosmic beings|Cosmic Beings]], the [[Spiritual Hierarchy#Cosmic beings attendant to the Sun|Twelve Solar Hierarchies]], Archangels, Angels, [[Elementals|Beings of the Elements]], and Twin Flames of the Alpha-Omega Polarity sponsoring [[Planetary system|Systems of Worlds]] and entire [[Galaxy|Galactic Systems]].  This ''Universal Order of Divine Self-Expression'' is the means whereby [[Spiritual Hierarchy#Cosmic beings governing the Cosmos from the Great Central Sun|God in the Great Central Sun]] steps down [ [[spiritual energy]] from ] the Presence and Essence of [[Spiritual Hierarchy#God|His Universal Being / Consciousness]] in order that all Life in [[Space-time|time and space]] might give and receive [[Agape|Unconditional Divine Love]]. One's placement on this "Ladder of Life" in the Spirit / Matter Universes is determined by one's level of Spiritual Attainment - measured by Awareness and Manifestation of balanced  Love, Wisdom, and Power - as well as the embodying of other Divine Qualities."

==Use of "I AM" in decrees, affirmations, and invocations==

A characteristic of students of the Ascended Master Teachings is the use of God's Creative Name - "I AM" - in the use of Decrees, Fiats, Adorations, and Affirmations to invoke and send forth the Light of God to Bless Life, to bring forth the Perfect Divine solution for every situation, and to fulfill the Divine Plan. It is believed to be a way of externalizing more Divine Light, Divine Love, and Divine Life into the lower planes of creation through the dynamic force of sound vibration as creative energy.&lt;ref name="Law_of_Life_I" /&gt;

''The Magic Presence'' states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;

"Only the Self-conscious Individual has ALL the Attributes and Creative Power of the 'Mighty I AM Presence.' Only He can know who and what He is, and express the Fullness of the Creative Power of God whenever He decrees, by the use of the Words, 'I AM.' The outer human part of this activity is what We call the personality. It is but the vehicle through which Perfection should be expressed into the outer substance of the Universe.

"Within the 'Pure God-Flame' is a Breath that pulsates constantly. This `Great Fire-Breath' is a Rhythmic Outpouring of Divine Love, Its Three Attributes being 'Love, Wisdom, and Power in action.' These pour out constantly, into the 'Infinite Sea of Pure Electronic Light.' This Light is the Universal Substance or Spirit, out of which all forms are composed. It is intelligent, mark you, because It obeys law through the command of the Individual who says, or is conscious of, 'I AM.' These Two Words are the Acknowledgment and Release of the Power to Create and bring forth into outer existence, whatever quality follows That Acknowledgment. For Intelligence to act there must be Intelligence to be acted upon, and the Universal Substance, being like a photographic film, takes the record of what-ever quality the Individual imposes upon It through his thought, feeling, and spoken word. The Words 'I AM' whether thought, felt, or spoken, release the Power of Creation instantly. Make no mistake about this. Intelligence is Omnipresent, and It is within the Electronic Light." &lt;ref name="The_Magic_Presence" /&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Violet Flame==

Use of the "[[Violet (color)|Violet]] Flame of Divine Love" is considered to be the [[Seven Rays|7th Ray]] aspect of the Holy Spirit and the "Sacred Fire" that transmutes and consumes the "cause, effect, record, and memory" of sin or negative karma. Also called the "Flame of Transmutation", the "Flame of Mercy", the "Flame of Freedom", and the "Flame of Forgiveness". "Our God is a Consuming Fire" in ''Deuteronomy'' 4:24 (KJV) and ''Hebrews'' 12:29 (KJV) is believed to be refer to this "Sacred Fire of God".

The "Violet Fire" is held to be a raising, transforming, purifying action of "Divine Love" from the "Heart of God" in the "Great Central Sun". It acts to transmute and consume human creation that is not worthy of becoming Immortal, and all negative karmic causes, effects, records, and memories, without the need to individually balance that karma face-to-face with each person back to the earliest beginning of one's individualized manifestation on this or any other world.&lt;ref name="Law_of_Life_I" /&gt;

==Ascension==
{{Main|Initiation (Theosophy)}}
The Ascension is believed to be the returning to complete "Oneness with God" - "raising the outer atomic structure of the physical, emotional, and mental bodies into the Electronic Structure of the I AM Consciousness", becoming an Ascended Master, eventually a Cosmic Being, and beyond. The Ascension into Immortality through reunion with the God Self requires the consuming of at least 51% of the records and memories of "negatively qualified karma" as well as:

===Mastery of the matter planes===

It is believed that the "Individualized Flames of Perfection", emanating as lifestreams taking physical embodiment, can develop further attributes that express a unique Identity, and attain the fullness of the use of Light. This is done by mastery over [[Plane (esotericism)|matter planes]] that have a slower vibratory action, thus requiring more energy and concentration to externalize form. This allows for the development of greater skills of creation and "Causal Body Momentums" of various "Divine Qualities". Physical embodiment gives each individual the opportunity to expand these attributes and faculties through matter substance, and to become a "master of energy" through thought and feeling. This allows for accomplishments and added power which one who does not ever embody on a planet does not possess. Thus an individual may expand the "Flame in the Heart", and expand the "Perfection of the Allness of God's Love" in the created universe, eventually becoming an Ascended Master and later a Cosmic Being.

According to the Ascended Master Teachings, gaining "mastery over matter planes" means learning to consciously use 100% of one's Creative Power of thought, feeling, and spoken word to create greater perfection, joy, and love in the world, as opposed to using thoughts, feelings, and words to create greater limitations, bondage, and chaos in one's own experience and in the world at large through carelessness and lack of awareness of the extent of one's influence in the world. "Matter planes" refers to the differentiations of atomic and molecular structure in which evolution takes place, the lower planes (dimensions / wavelength frequency resonance) sometimes correlated with physical solids, liquids, and gases; the higher subplanes of the Physical Octave are sometimes referred to as [[Etheric plane|"etheric"]] and are not normally perceivable by the physical senses. The emotional and mental octaves are also made up of electrons and atoms of feeling and thought substance and differentiated into levels of density and vibratory rate.&lt;ref name="Law_of_Life_I" /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

"To understand the above explanation concerning the electron and the conscious control the individual has through his thought and feeling to govern the atomic structure of his own body is to understand the One Principle Governing form throughout Infinity. When man will make the effort to prove this to himself or within his own atomic flesh body, he will then proceed to Master Himself. When he has done that, all else in the Universe is his willing co-worker to accomplish whatsoever he wills through Love." &lt;ref name="Unveiled_Mysteries" /&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Fulfillment of the Divine Plan===

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Within the Life of every human being is the Power by which he can express all that the Ascended Masters express every moment — if he but chooses to do so. All Life contains Will but only Self-Conscious Life is free to determine upon its own course of expression. Hence, the individual has free choice to express either in the human, limited body or the Super-Human, Divine Body. He is the chooser of his own field of expression. He is the Self-determining Creator. He has willed and chosen to live as Self-Conscious Life. . . . When one individualizes within the Absolute, All-Pervading Life he chooses of his own free will to become an intensified individual focus of Self-Conscious Intelligence. He is the conscious director of his future activities. Thus, having once made his choice, he is the only one who can fulfill that Destiny - which is not inflexible circumstance but a definitely designed Plan of Perfection.&lt;ref name="Unveiled_Mysteries" /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Threefold Flame==

The Threefold Flame of Life is the Immortal Flame within the Heart of the children of Light and Sons and Daughters of God, and is an actual extension of the Heart of the I AM Presence of each Lifestream in embodiment on Earth.&lt;ref name="Law_of_Life_I" /&gt;

==The fall of man==

It is believed that since the "fall of man" during the time of the incarnation of the [[Root race#The fourth root race (Atlantean)|Fourth Root Race]], imperfection, limitations and discord increasingly entered into our world. The memory body is considered to have become known as a "soul", and this temporary personality has taken on the sense of a self that is separated and not connected to God. It is believed that a "Dictation" from Maitreya further clarified this matter through the "Messenger", [[Geraldine Innocente]], on September 27, 1954 when what occurred during the time of the "Fourth Root Race" was described:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Curiosity, rebellion against holding true to the Divine Pattern and the use of thought and feeling in creation of imperfection, began the building of what you call the 'soul'. It is a consciousness apart from the full Purity of God. The first thought a man had that was imperfect and impure, energized by a secret feeling, was a cause and that, sent out into the atmosphere, created an effect. Like a boomerang, the effect came back into the consciousness and made a record. That record was the beginning of an impression. Energy sent out in a certain manner returned to affect the lifestream who had sent it forth and there began to be created a shadow between the I AM Presence and the human consciousness. Endeavoring to contact the Presence, the individual would find these 'tramp' thoughts and feelings flowing through that line of contact until more and more imperfect was the conscious use of them. Finally, those centers got completely away from the control of the ego and acted independently.&lt;ref&gt;''The Bridge to Freedom Journal'', February 1956 (Reprinted by Ascended Master Teaching Foundation 1989) Purported address from Maitreya on September 27, 1954 "through" Geraldine Innocente&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Dictations==

Within The "I AM" Activity, contact and cooperation with the Ascended Masters became a central part of each member's life. Through the Ballards as "Messengers", the Ascended Masters were believed to have regularly communicated with the students of The "I AM" Activity. Those Addresses (known as "Dictations") were delivered before gatherings of members in Conclaves held throughout the United States of America, published in the monthly periodical, ''The Voice of The "I AM"'', and some were collected and reprinted in the books of ''The Saint Germain Series''. In all, 3,834 Dictations from the Masters were received through Guy and Edna Ballard. Other "Ascended Master Activities" believed that the Ascended Masters, Cosmic Beings, Elohim, and Archangels continued to present a program for both individual development and spiritual transformation in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Partridge, Christopher ed. ''New Religions: A Guide: New Religious Movements, Sects and Alternative Spiritualities'' Oxford University Press, USA 2004. Describes the religious organizations based on a belief in the Ascended Master Teachings, such as The I AM Activity, The Bridge to Freedom and The Summit Lighthouse. pages 330 - 334&lt;/ref&gt; They believe that further instruction from the Ascended Masters and the rest of the Spiritual Hierarchy continued through new Dispensations with new Messengers, such as [[The Bridge to Freedom]],&lt;ref&gt;''The Bridge to Freedom Journal'' 1951 - 1961 Reprinted by Ascended Master Teaching Foundation 1989&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Summit Lighthouse]],&lt;ref name="Lewis, James R. 1994" /&gt; and The Temple of The Presence.

==Dawning Golden Age==

Students of the Ascended Master Teachings believe that this world is destined to again have a [[Golden Age]], a "Heaven on Earth", that will be permanent, unlike previous Golden Ages millions of years ago.&lt;ref name="Law_of_Life_I" /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

"In your beloved America, in the not so far distant future, will come forth a similar recognition of the Real Inner Self, and this her people will express in high attainment. She is a Land of Light, and Her Light shall blaze forth, brilliant as the sun at noonday, among the nations of the Earth. She was a Land of Great Light, ages ago, and will again come into her spiritual heritage, for nothing can prevent it." &lt;ref name="Unveiled_Mysteries" /&gt;

"The Divine Plan for the future of North America is a condition of intense activity in the greatest peace, beauty, success, prosperity, spiritual illumination, and dominion. She is to carry the Christ Light and be the Guide for the rest of the Earth, because America is to be the Heart Center of the 'Golden Age' that is now dimly touching our horizon. The greater portion of the land of North America will stand for a very long time." &lt;ref name="Unveiled_Mysteries" /&gt;

==The Aquarian Church==
The Aquarian Christine Church Universal, Inc. (ACCU) is a denomination founded in 2006 based on ''The [[Aquarian Gospel of Jesus the Christ]]'' transcribed from the [[Akashic records|Akashic Records]] by [[Levi Dowling|Levi H. Dowling]].  The Aquarian Christine Church actively promotes Ascended Master Teachings and shares many beliefs in common with the I AM Movement, White Eagle Lodge and New Thought and Theosophical groups.  The book "Initiations of the Aquarian Masters: The Theosophy of the Aquarian Gospel" by ACCU founder Rev. Dr. Jacob L. Watson, expounds on the church's teachings which draw heavily from the writings of A.D.K. Luk, the Saint Germain Series published Saint Germain Press (The Saint Germain Foundation), and especially from "The Lost Years of Jesus" compiled by [[Elizabeth Clare Prophet]] and published by The Summit Lighthouse.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, Jacob L. "Initiations of the Aquarian Masters: The Theosophy of the Aquarian Gospel"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Skeptical view==

[[K. Paul Johnson]] suggests in his book ''The Masters Revealed: Madam Blavatsky and Myth of the Great White Brotherhood'' that the Masters that Madam Blavatsky claimed she had personally met are idealizations of certain people she had met during her lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, K. Paul ''The Masters Revealed: Madam Blavatsky and Myth of the Great White Brotherhood'' Albany, New York: 1994 State University of New York Press&lt;/ref&gt;

Also see the article “Talking to the Dead and Other Amusements” by Paul Zweig ''New York Times'' October 5, 1980, which maintains that Madame Blavatsky's revelations were fraudulent.

'''Belém''' ({{IPA-pt|beˈlẽj|br}}&lt;!--The [j] is NOT A TYPO--&gt;;&lt;ref&gt;The [[European Portuguese]] pronunciation is {{IPA-pt|bɨˈlɐ̃j|}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] for '''[[Bethlehem]]'''), is a [[Brazil]]ian [[cities of Brazil|city]], the capital and largest city of the state of [[Pará]] in the country's [[North Region, Brazil|north]]. It is the gateway to the [[Amazon River]] with a busy [[port]], airport, and bus/coach station. Belém lies approximately 100&amp;nbsp;km upriver from the [[Atlantic Ocean]], on the [[Pará River]], which is part of the greater Amazon River system, separated from the larger part of the Amazon delta by ''Ilha de Marajó'' ([[Marajó|Marajo Island]]). With an estimated population of 1,439,561 people — or 2,249,405, considering its metropolitan area — it is the [[List of largest cities in Brazil|11th most populous city]] in Brazil, as well as the [[Economy of Brazil|16th by economic relevance]]. It is the second largest in the [[North Region, Brazil|North Region]], second only to [[Manaus]], in the state of [[Amazonas (Brazilian state)|Amazonas]].

Founded in 1616 by the [[Kingdom of Portugal]], Belém was the first [[Colonial Brazil|European colony]] on the Amazon but did not become part of Brazil until 1775. The newer part of the city has modern buildings and skyscrapers. The colonial portion retains the charm of tree-filled squares, churches and traditional blue tiles. The city has a rich history and architecture from colonial times. Recently it witnessed a skyscraper boom.

Belém is also known as the ''Metropolis of the Brazilian Amazon region'' or the ''Cidade das Mangueiras'' (City of [[Mango]] Trees) due to the vast number of those trees found in the city. Brazilians often refer to the city as Belém do Pará ("Belém of Pará") rather than just ''Belém'', a reference to an earlier name for the city, Santa Maria de Belém do Grão Pará, and also to differentiate it from  a number of other towns called Belém in Brazil, as well as the Palestinian city of Bethlehem. It is named after [[Santa Maria de Belém (Lisbon)|Santa Maria de Belém]] in Lisbon, also better known by its shortened name, [[Belém (Lisbon)|Belém]].

Belém is served by two airports: [[Val de Cães International Airport]], which connects the city with the rest of Brazil and other cities in South America, and [[Protásio de Oliveira Airport|Brig. Protásio de Oliveira Airport (formerly called Júlio César Airport)]] dedicated to general aviation. The city is also home to the [[Federal University of Pará]] and the [[Pará State University]].

==Name==
The name '''Belém''' is the [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] word for [[Bethlehem]], the town where Christians believe [[Jesus Christ]] was born. The city had other names before eventually becoming Belém.

==History==
[[File:Ver-oPeso-Belem.jpg|left|thumb|Ver-o-Peso market.]]
{{see also|Timeline of Belém}}
In 1615, Portuguese captain-general [[Francisco Caldeira Castelo Branco]] of the captaincy of [[Bahia]] commanded a military expedition sent by the [[Governorate General of Brazil|Governor General of Brazil]] to check the trading excursions of foreigners (French, Dutch, English) up the river (Amazon) from the Cabo do Norte in Grão Pará.
[[File:Belém (PA).tif|left|thumb|Belém, 1910s. [[Brazilian National Archives|National Archives of Brazil.]]]]
On January 12, 1616, he anchored in what is now known as Guajará Bay, formed by the confluence of the Para and [[Guamá River|Guama]] Rivers, called by the Tupinambás, "Guaçu Paraná". Caldeira mistook the bay for the main channel, and thirty leagues (178&amp;nbsp;km) upstream, he built a wooden fort, covered with straw, which he called "Presépio" (nativity scene), now known as"Forte do Castelo". The colony formed by the fort was given the name Feliz Lusitânia, "Happy Lusitania". It was the embryo of the future city of Belém. The fort failed to suppress Dutch and French trading, but did ward off colonization.

Feliz Lusitânia was later called Nossa Senhora de Belém do Grão Pará (Our Lady of Bethlehem of Grao-Para) and Santa Maria de Belém (St. Mary of Bethlehem). Belém was given city status in 1655 and was made capital of the State when Pará state was split off from [[Maranhão]] in 1772. The early decades of the 19th century were marked by political instability. Uprisings and internecine strife finally ended in 1836, after considerable loss of life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.achetudoeregiao.com.br/PA/belem/historia.htm History of Belém] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090223043907/http://www.achetudoeregiao.com.br/PA/belem/historia.htm |date=February 23, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Brasil Hoje n. 118 (1975) - Documentário da Agência Nacional sobre a cidade de Belém, Pará.webm|thumb|Belém, 1975. [[Brazilian National Archives|National Archives of Brazil.]]]]
The [[sugar trade]] in the Belém region was important up to the end of the 17th century. Thereafter the city's economic importance alternately rose and fell. Cattle ranching supplanted sugar until the 18th century, when cultivation of rice, cotton and coffee became profitable. With the settlement of [[southern Brazil]], where such crops could be produced more efficiently, Belém declined again. The city subsequently became the main exporting centre of the Amazon rubber industry, and by 1866 its position was further enhanced by the opening of the Amazon, [[Tocantins River|Tocantins]] and [[Tapajós]] rivers to navigation. The rubber era ended after the boom of 1910–12, but Belém continued to be the main commercial centre of northern Brazil and the [[entrepôt]] for the Amazon valley.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brasilturismo.com/pa/belem/ Rubber era in Belém]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Geography ==
{{Stack|||float=right}}
The city of Belém, capital of Pará, is full of indentations and recesses forming islands all around it. There are 55 of these islets, most of which are wild and uninhabitable, although some are home to small populations called ''ribeirinhos''.

These include the islands of [[Mosqueiro]], fringed by 14 freshwater beaches, and Caratateua which receive a large number of visitors in summertime. In addition to these and also near Belém, is the island of Tatuoca which is the location of one of the seven [[geophysical]] stations in the world, and the only station in [[Latin America]].

===Climate===
Belém has a [[tropical rainforest climate]] (climate type ''Af''), under [[Köppen climate classification|Köppen’s Climate classification]]. In all 12 months of the year, the city on average sees more than 60&amp;nbsp;mm of rainfall, so the city has no true [[dry season]] month. However, Belém features noticeably wetter and drier seasons. The wetter season spans from December through May, while the drier season covers the remaining six months of the year. Like many cities with a tropical rainforest climate, average temperatures vary little throughout the course of the year, generally hovering around 26.5 degrees Celsius. As one would expect, tropical rainforest is the natural vegetation in and around the city.

[[File:Vitregias02.jpg|thumb|right|[[Vitória Régia]] in [[Paraense Emílio Goeldi Museum]]]]
The Amazon represents more than half the planet's remaining rainforests and comprises the largest and most species-rich tract of tropical rainforest in the world. Wet tropical forests are the most species-rich [[biome]], and tropical forests in the Americas are consistently more species rich than the wet forests in Africa and Asia.&lt;ref name="Turner 2001"&gt;Turner, I. M. 2001. ''The ecology of trees in the tropical rainforest''.  [[Cambridge University Press]], Cambridge. {{ISBN|0-521-80183-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As the largest tract of tropical rainforest in the Americas, the Amazonian rainforests have unparalleled [[biodiversity]]. More than one-third of all species in the world live in the Amazon Rainforest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldwildlife.org/wildplaces/amazon/index.cfm Amazon Rainforest, Amazon Plants, Amazon River Animals]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economy==
The most valuable products now exported from the Amazon by way of Belém are [[aluminium]], iron ore, and other metals.,&lt;ref&gt;[http://geografiaconservadora.blogspot.com/2005/10/minerao-na-amaznia.html Metals in Belém]&lt;/ref&gt; nuts (chiefly [[Brazil nuts]]), pineapples, [[cassava]], [[jute]], wood veneers, and [[hardwoods]]. [[Japanese Brazilian|Japanese immigration]] after the 1930s was an important factor in developing [[jute]] and black pepper, notably at Tomé-Açu, just south of Belém, and near [[Santarém, Brazil|Santarém]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rizoma.ufsc.br/html/1073-of6-st3.htm Japanese Immigration to Pará and Belém] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090213180038/http://www.rizoma.ufsc.br/html/1073-of6-st3.htm |date=February 13, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marajó Island]], the largest [[fluvial]] island in the world, which lies just across the Rio Pará from Belém, has some livestock grazing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://guiadolitoral.uol.com.br/ilha_de_marajo-2587_2009.html About Marajó Island]&lt;/ref&gt; Electricity is provided by the massive [[Tucuruí Dam]], some 300&amp;nbsp;km southwest of the city on the Tocantins River.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eletrobras.gov.br/historia/historia.asp?empresa=eletronorte&amp;texto=02 Tucuruí Dam] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706160224/http://www.eletrobras.gov.br/historia/historia.asp?empresa=eletronorte&amp;texto=02 |date=July 6, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demographics==
According to the [[Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics|IBGE]] of 2012, there were 2,079,699 people residing in the Metropolitan Region of Belém. The population density was {{convert|1337.2|PD/sqkm|PD/sqmi}}. The last PNAD (National Research for Sample of Domiciles) census revealed the following numbers: 1,379,655 [[Pardo]] (brown) people (64.5%), 588,225 [[White Brazilian|White]] (27.5%), 156,147 [[Afro-Brazilian|Black]] (7.3%), 14,973 Asian or Amerindian people (0.7%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.ibge.gov.br/home/estatistica/populacao/condicaodevida/indicadoresminimos/sinteseindicsociais2008/indic_sociais2008.pdf|title=Síntese de Indicadores Sociais 2008|publisher=[[Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics|IBGE]]|location=Belém, Brazil|format=PDF|isbn=85-240-3919-1|accessdate=2009-01-31|year=2008|language=Portuguese|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120710024258/http://www.ibge.gov.br/home/estatistica/populacao/condicaodevida/indicadoresminimos/sinteseindicsociais2008/indic_sociais2008.pdf|archivedate=2012-07-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to an autosomal DNA genetic study from 2011, the ancestral composition of the population of Belém is: 68.6% European ancestry, followed by 20.9% Amerindian ancestry and 10.6% African ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0017063&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education ==
Portuguese is the official national language, and thus the primary language taught in schools. But English and Spanish are part of the official high school curriculum.

===Education institutions===
* [[Universidade Federal do Pará]] (UFPA);
* [[Universidade do Estado do Pará]] (UEPA);
* [[Federal Rural University of Amazonia]] (UFRA);
* [[Universidade da Amazônia]] (UNAMA);
* [[Centro Universitário do Pará]] (Cesupa);
* [[Amazon Valley Academy International School]] (AVA);
* [[Escola Superior da Amazônia]]  (ESAMAZ);
* [[Instituto Federal de Educação, Ciência e Tecnologia do Pará]]  (IFPA)

==Culture==
[[File:Belem-Cathedral1.jpg|thumb|right|[[Cathedral]] of Sé.]]

===Círio de Nazarésed by the patron saint of Pará===

The festivities last 15 days, with religious celebrations, like the Children's Círio, and its procession, held two Sundays after the Círio. The Re-Círio marks the end of the celebrations, with a shorter course back to the Gentil Bittencourt chapel.

===Convention and Fair Centre of the Amazon===
Built in a 23,000-square-metre area, the Hangar Convention and Fair Center of the Amazon has 12 rooms, ticket offices, baggage keeping, press room, and a [[food court]], distributed in two big buildings with a parking lot for 800 vehicles. Genuine Amazonian trees will soon be planted in the outdoor area. With Hangar, Belém joins the market for national conventions that take place in a different city each time, such as the [[Brazilian Computer Society]] Congress. National conventions had not been held in the Northern region previously.

Hangar, whose auditorium has room for 2,160 participants, has some of the best technologies available in the world and is the most modern and functional space for events in the country. According to the Brazilian Association of Convention and Fair Centers (ABRACCEF), there are 17,500 events happening on average throughout the 53 main convention and exhibition centres of Brazil. These activities bring together approximately 28 million participants. Belém has great potential for this type of tourism.

===Architecture===
In many ways, Belém's [[colonial architecture]] reflects the seventeenth-century architecture of [[Lisbon]] in Portugal which served as the inspiration for the main housing projects of the time, with the frequent use of tile-hung façades. [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical architecture]] is also present in buildings such as the [[Theatro da Paz]], built in 1874. Many of the buildings at the end of the nineteenth century and early twentieth century also echo [[French architecture]].

Belém began with the narrow streets of the Cidade Velha (Old City), a district which still preserves some structures that the Portuguese colonials built here, places like Forte do Castelo, a fort built to defend the region against French, Dutch and British colonization attempts, and one of the first structures in the capital. The Ver-o-pêso market is the biggest open market in Latin America where you can find everything, from the most exotic fruit, to the scented baths.

===Cuisine===
The local [[Amerindian]] culture extracts colors, scents, flavors, and native tastes from nature to produce a rich and exotic [[cuisine]], adding up to the most authentic of regional cuisines. One such dish, "Cupuaçu", comes from the Cupuaçu tree, found in the Amazonian woods. Cupuaçu is easily identified by its smell and sour taste and is highly appreciated by both locals and tourists. Its pulp is also extracted to make juices, candies, jellies, liquors, and ice cream. [[Açaí palm|Açaí]] is a palm tree with a long, thin stem. Açaí, also known as Jussara, is purple in color with a delicious taste. Long prized by the local population, it recently it has also reached the national menu.

[[Freshwater crab]], a traditional local delicacy, is a very popular dish in the city's cuisine. Found only in swamps, its well-tempered meat can be served in different forms: as a shell, the so-called unha (the claws) or toc-toc.  "[[Maniçoba]]" is one of the highlights of the local cuisine. Its preparation is time-consuming and its final appearance is quite surprising for those who have never tried it, due to the dark look of the cooked maniva (ground [[manioc]] leaves). But this first impression ends quickly, after you taste the dish with its seemingly awkward ingredients. Maniçoba is often served in ceramic dishes, and can be eaten with rice or with manioc flour and [[capsicum]].

Belém has been part of the [[Creative Cities Network|UNESCO Creative Cities Network]] in the category of gastronomy since 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.unesco.org/new/en/brasilia/about-this-office/single-view/news/belem_salvador_and_santos_join_the_unesco_creative_cities |title=Belém, Salvador and Santos join the UNESCO Creative Cities Network |agency= United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization |website= www.unesco.org |language=en|access-date=2018-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The north's leading educational and cultural centre, it is the seat of a [[Diocese|bishopric]], and its [[cathedral]] (Igreja da Sé, founded in 1917) is one of Brazil's largest. Santo Alexandre, the oldest of Belém's churches, was built in 1616. The Museu (museum) Paraense [[Émil Goeldi|Emílio Goeldi]], the [[Da Paz Theatre|Teatro da Paz]] (a classical theatre), and the public library and archives are other notable institutions. The Universidade Federal do Pará (1957), a teacher-training school, an agricultural institute, and an institute for research on [[tropical diseases]] are also in the city. The Ver-o-Peso (Portuguese: "see the weight") market in the old port centre is a major tourist attraction. The city is also home to a large [[Association football|football]] stadium, the [[Estádio Olímpico do Pará]].

===Utinga State Park===

The municipality of Belém contains 99% of the [[Utinga State Park]], created in 1993 to protect the metropolitan area's water supply.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|language=pt|date=August 2013 |publisher=Secretaria de Estado de Meio Ambiente (SEMA) |title=Plano de Manejo do Parque Estadual do Utinga

[[File:Valdecaes.JPG|thumb|right|[[Val de Cães International Airport|Belém International Airport]].]]
[[Val de Cans International Airport|Belém International Airport (Val de Cans)]] is the major airport serving the city of Belém. The building design uses plane curves on its roof to permit light to enter its entire large terminal hall.

The architect [[Sérgio Parada]] used adopted multiple-use totems integrated with light projectors, a sound system, air conditioning, and public telephones. Currently Belém International Airport serves 2.7 million passengers a year, in a constructed area of {{convert|33,255.17|m2|2|abbr=off}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infraero.gov.br/index.php/br/aeroportos/para/aeroporto-internacional-de-belem.html International Airport of Belém] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130807010619/http://www.infraero.gov.br/index.php/br/aeroportos/para/aeroporto-internacional-de-belem.html |date=2013-08-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Bible Lands Museum''' ({{lang-he| מוזיאון ארצות המקרא ירושלים}}) is an archaeological museum in [[Jerusalem]], [[Israel]], that explores the culture of the peoples mentioned in the [[Bible]], among them the [[ancient Egyptians]], [[Canaanites]], [[Philistines]], [[Arameans]], [[Hittites]], [[Elamites]], [[Phoenicians]] and [[Persia]]ns.
 
==Overview==
The aim of the museum is to put the various peoples covered into historical context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bringing civilizations together |first=Michael |last=Green |newspaper=[[The Jerusalem Post]] |date=May 29, 2008  | url=http://www.jpost.com/Travel/Jerusalem/Bringing-civilizations-together}}&lt;/ref&gt; The museum is located on Museum Row in [[Givat Ram]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/135838|title=Jewish Pride: Prime Minister's Son Wins Bible Contest|website=Israel National News|language=en|access-date=2018-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; between the [[Israel Museum]], The [[Israel Antiquities Authority|National Campus for the Archaeology of Israel]], and the [[Bloomfield Science Museum]].

==History==
The museum was founded by [[Elie Borowski]] in 1992 to house his personal collection. On a visit to Jerusalem in 1981, he met at a hotel, Batya Weiss,  who encouraged him to bring his collection of Ancient Near Eastern Art from biblical times to Israel and establish a museum. She put him in contact with Jerusalem mayor [[Teddy Kollek]]. Borowski heeded her advice, and built the Bible Lands Museum and moved his collection from a museum in Toronto to Jerusalem. Elie and Batya eventually married.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hagshama.org.il/en/resources/view.asp?id=1319 |title=The Bible Lands Museum, Jerusalem |first=Mordechai |last=Beck |publisher=[[Archive.org]] |accessdate=25 November 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928004034/http://www.hagshama.org.il/en/resources/view.asp?id=1319 |archivedate=September 28, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exhibits== 
The main gallery displays hundreds of artifacts: ancient documents, idols, coins, statues, weapons, pottery, and seals from across the ancient Near East. Many topics are elaborated upon in brief articles on the walls (e.g. the origins of the alphabet, embalming, and Abraham's journey). The museum also exhibits scale models of ancient sites in Jerusalem, a [[Ziggurat]] at [[Ur]] and the pyramids at [[Giza]]. While the museum's emphasis is the history of ancient [[Near East]]ern civilizations, the curators draw attention to relevant biblical verses. For example, above a gallery of ancient [[Anatolia]]n jugs is the verse "Behold, Rebecca came forth with her pitcher on her shoulder; and she went down unto the fountain and drew water" ([[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 24:45).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10159">In [[philosophy]], [[sociology]], and [[the arts]], the word "'''biofact'''" is a [[neologism]] coined from the [[Portmanteau|combination of]] the words ''bios'' and [[Cultural artifact|artifact]] and denotes a being that is both an artifact and [[Organism|living being]] or both [[Nature|natural]] and [[Artificiality|artificial]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Tensions and Convergences: Technological And Aesthetic Transformations of Society|last=Heil|first=Reinhard|last2=Kaminski|first2=Andreas|last3=Stippak|first3=Marcus|last4=Unger|first4=Alexander|publisher=Transaction Publishers|year=2007|isbn=9783899425185|location=New Brunswick|pages=145}}&lt;/ref&gt; This being has been created by purposive human action but exists by processes of growth.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There are sources who cite some creations of [[genetic engineering]] as examples of biofacts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Conflicting Philosophies and International Trade Law: Worldviews and the WTO|last=Burkard|first=Michael|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2018|isbn=9783319610665|location=Cham, Switzerland|pages=126}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Responsible Nanobiotechnology: Philosophy and Ethics|last=Grunwald|first=Armin|publisher=CRC Press|year=2012|isbn=9789814364331|location=Boca Raton, FL|pages=241}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of the Concept ==

''Biofact'' was introduced as early as 2001 by the German philosopher [[Nicole C. Karafyllis]]&lt;ref&gt;Nicole C. Karafyllis: ''Biologisch, natürlich, nachhaltig. Philosophische Aspekte des Naturzugangs im 21. Jahrhundert.'' Tuebingen: A. Francke Publisher; chap. 6&lt;/ref&gt; although her book ''Biofakte'' published in 2003 is commonly used as reference for the introduction of the term.&lt;ref&gt;Nicole C. Karafyllis (Hg.), ''Biofakte. Versuch über den Menschen zwischen Artefakt und Lebewesen'', Mentis: Paderborn 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Karafyllis, the word '''biofact''' first appeared in a German article (entitled 'Biofakt und Artefakt') in 1943, written by the Austrian protozoologist Bruno M. Klein.&lt;ref&gt;Bruno Maria Klein: Artefakt und Biofakt, in: Mikrokosmos 1943/44&lt;/ref&gt; Addressing both microscopy and philosophy, Klein named a [[Biofact (biology)|biofact]] something that is a visible dead product emerging from a living being while this being is still alive (e.g. a shell). However, Klein's distinction operated with the difference biotic/abiotic and dead/alive, not with nature/technology and growth/man-made. For her part, Karafyllis described biofact as a [[Hermeneutics|hermeneutic concept]] that allows the comparison between nature and [[technology]] in the domain of the living.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Handbook of Genetics &amp; Society: Mapping the New Genomic Era|last=Atkinson|first=Paul|last2=Glasner|first2=Peter|last3=Lock|first3=Margaret|publisher=Routledge|year=2009|isbn=0203927389|location=Oxon|pages=230}}&lt;/ref&gt; Particularly 

== Philosophy of the Concept ==

With the term ''biofact'', Karafyllis wants to emphasize that living entities can be highly artificial due to methods deriving from agriculture, gardening (e.g. breeding) or [[biotechnology]] (e.g. [[genetic engineering]], [[cloning]]).  Biofacts show signatures of [[culture]] and technique.
Primarily, the concept aims to argue against the common philosophical tradition to summarize all kinds of living beings under the category [[nature]]. The concept ''biofact'' questions if the phenomenon of growth is and was a secure candidate for differentiating between nature and technology.

For the [[philosophy of technology]] the questions arise if a) biotechnology and [[agriculture]] should not be an integral part of ''reflexion'', thereby adding new insights to the common focus on the [[machine]] and the artifact, and if b) established concepts of technique and technology which stress artificiality should not be modified. Karafyllis regards the inclusion of biofacts into a theory of techniques as a chance, to reformulate classic concepts of [[design]] and [[construction]] for defining the making of artifacts. In her view, biofacts depend on the method of provocation.&lt;ref&gt;Karafyllis, N. C.: Provokation als Methode der biotechnischen Evolution, in: Volker Gerhardt, Klaus Lucas and Günter Stock (Eds.): ''Evolution. Theorie, Formen und Konsequenzen eines Paradigmas in Natur, Technik und Kultur''. Berlin: Akademie Verlag 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

For the [[philosophy of nature]], biofacts highlight a need to clarify if nature is self-explanatory in every case. [[Biophilosophy]] is challenged to newly reflect upon the categories organism and [[living being]].&lt;ref&gt;Marianne Schark: ''Lebewesen versus Dinge'', De Gruyter 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;
In the [[philosophy of science]], approaches are challenged which only focus on the category thing (or epistemic thing) without historizing the technicality, mediality and materiality of its emerging as a living object. For the [[sociology of science]] the biofact concept is fruitful to discuss the exclusiveness of scientific knowledge (the role of the [[expert]]) while making scientific objects which are released into the [[lifeworld]] or public sphere.  Particularly because the biofact concept deals with the [[phenomenon]] of growth and the establishing of a [[self]], it is also influential in the philosophical disciplines phenomenology, [[anthropology]] and [[ontology]]. It was [[Jürgen Habermas]] who recently stressed the anthropological consequences if mankind gives up the differentiation of "coming into being" and "making".&lt;ref&gt;Jürgen Habermas: ''Die Zukunft der menschlichen Natur'', Frankfurt am Main: Suhrkamp 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

Artifacts are artificial, i.e. man-made objects. Contrary to biofacts, they cannot be found in nature. Therefore, biofacts demarcate an ontological intersection. They are partially man-made, but growing. Like artifacts, they have been made for a certain [[utility]]. Biofacts can be seen as biotic artifacts which show their character as hybrids in multifold perspectives.

The term is also enabling philosophers to criticize some concepts in [[technoscience]], where the union of scientific knowledge about nature and the technical creation of technonature is seen as progress in the political sense.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Bruno Latour: ''Politics of Natur. How to bring the Sciences into Democracy'', Harvard University Press 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; The term has also been adopted in the new [[BioArt]], not rarely without using its critical impacts.

As Karafyllis complemented the growth and reproduction of organisms with technical entities, she established a typology of different kinds of organisms according to their uses and these are:

* Natural life form
* Unaltered biofacts
* Reshaped biofacts
* Genetically reproduced biofacts
* Genetically modified biofacts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Synthetic Biology: Metaphors, Worldviews, Ethics, and Law|last=Boldt|first=Joachim|publisher=Springer|year=2015|isbn=9783658109875|location=Wiesbaden|pages=114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Black American Sign Language''' ('''BASL''') or '''Black Sign Variation''' ('''BSV''') is a [[dialect]] of [[American Sign Language]] (ASL)&lt;ref&gt;[[#CITEREFEthnologue|Ethnologue 2015]], [http://www.ethnologue.com/language/ase American Sign Language]&lt;/ref&gt; used most commonly by deaf [[African American]]s in the United States. The divergence from ASL was influenced largely by the [[School segregation in the United States|segregation]] of schools in the [[Southern United States|American South]]. Like other schools at the time, schools for the deaf were segregated based upon race, creating two language communities among deaf signers: White deaf signers at White schools and Black deaf signers at Black schools. Today, BASL is still used by signers in the South despite public schools having been legally [[School integration in the United States|desegregated]] since 1954.

Linguistically, BASL differs from other varieties of ASL in its [[American Sign Language phonology|phonology]], [[syntax]], and [[vocabulary]]. BASL tends to have a larger signing space, meaning that some signs are produced further away from the body than in other dialects. Signers of BASL also tend to prefer two-handed variants of signs, while signers of ASL tend to prefer one-handed variants. Some signs are different in BASL as well, with some borrowings from [[African American English]].

==History==
Like many educational institutions for hearing children during the 1800s and early 1900s, schools for deaf children were [[School segregation in the United States|segregated]] based on race.&lt;ref&gt;[[#CITEREFMcCaskill2011|McCaskill, et al. 2011]], p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; The first school for the deaf in the United States, the [[American School for the Deaf]] (ASD), was founded in 1817 but did not admit any Black students until 1952. Of the schools for the deaf that were founded, few admitted [[Person of color|students of color]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#CITEREFMcCaskill2011|McCaskill, et al. 2011]], pp. 16–17&lt;/ref&gt; Seeing a lack of educational opportunities for Black deaf children, [[Platt Skinner]] founded the Skinner School for the Colored Deaf, Dumb, and Blind in 1856 in [[Niagara Falls, New York]]. Skinner described his school as "the first effort of its kind in the country&amp;nbsp;... We receive and instruct those and only those who are refused admission to all other institutions and are despised on account of their color."&lt;ref&gt;[[#CITEREFSkinner1859|Skinner 1859]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#CITEREFMcCaskill2011|McCaskill, et al. 2011]], p.17&lt;/ref&gt; The school moved to [[Trenton, New Jersey]], in 1860. After it closed in 1866,&lt;ref&gt;[[#CITEREFMcCaskill2011|McCaskill, et al. 2011]], p.17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#NFUndergroundRR|Niagara Falls Underground Railroad Heritage Area, n.d.]]&lt;/ref&gt; no Northern state created an institution for Black deaf children. Even after these states outlawed segregation by 1900, integration was sparse, as some institutions allowed Black students and others did not.&lt;ref&gt;[[#CITEREFMcCaskill2011|McCaskill, et al. 2011]], pp. 17–18&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#CITEREFDouglas2005|Douglas 2005]], p. 83&lt;/ref&gt;

After the foundation and success of the American School for the Deaf, many other institutions for the deaf were founded throughout the country. Since schools, particularly in the South, were segregated, many Southern states created separate schools or departments for Black deaf children. The first school established for Black deaf children below the [[Mason–Dixon line]] opened in the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]] in 1857; it remained segregated until 1958. The last Southern state to create an institution for Black deaf children was [[Louisiana]] in 1938. Black deaf children became a language community isolated from White deaf children, with different means of [[language socialization]], allowing for different dialects to develop. Because the education of White children was privileged over that of Black children, [[oralism]]—the prominent [[pedagogy|pedagogical]] method of the time—was not as strictly applied to the Black deaf students. Oralist methods often forbade the use of sign language, so Black deaf students had more opportunities to use ASL than did their White peers. Despite the decision in ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' (1954), which declared racial segregation in public schools to be unconstitutional, integration was slow to come. Schools for the deaf were no exception: the last desegregated in 1978, 24 years after the decision.&lt;ref&gt;[[#CITEREFMcCaskill2011|McCaskill, et al. 2011]], pp. 19–20&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#CITEREFDouglas2005|Douglas 2005]]&lt;/ref&gt;

As schools began to integrate, students and teachers noticed differences in the way Black students and White students signed. [[Carolyn McCaskill]], now professor of ASL and Deaf Studies at [[Gallaudet University]], recalls the challenge of understanding the dialect of ASL used by her White principal and teachers after her segregated school of her youth integrated: "When I began attending the school, I did not understand the teacher and she did not understand me because we used different signs."&lt;ref&gt;[[#CITEREFMcCaskill2014|McCaskill 2014]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carl G. Croneberg]] was the first to discuss differences between BASL and White ASL in his appendices of the 1965 version of the ''Dictionary of American Sign Language.'' Work has continued on BASL since then.&lt;ref&gt;[[#CITEREFMcCaskill2011|McCaskill, et al. 2011]], p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Dictionary /&gt;

As deaf education and sign language research continued to evolve, so did the perception of ASL. With the publication of the ''Dictionary of American Sign Language'', ASL began to be recognized as a legitimate language. The greater acceptance of ASL as a language led to standardization and the development of a [[Prestige (sociolinguistics)|prestige dialect]], which was based upon the signs used at Gallaudet University.&lt;ref&gt;[[#CITEREFHill2015|Hill 2015]], pp. 153–155&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this standardization, ASL has regional, distinct accents similar to those of spoken languages.&lt;ref&gt;[[#CITEREFWalker1987|Walker 1987]], p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; Dialects that are different from the standard one, and especially those spoken by marginalized groups, are often stigmatized.&lt;ref&gt;[[#CITEREFMcCaskill2011|McCaskill, et al. 2011]], p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; As a non-standard dialect, BASL is stigmatized by signers and considered to be inferior to prestige dialects of ASL.&lt;ref&gt;[[#CITEREFMcCaskill2011|McCaskill, et al. 2011]], p. 72&lt;/ref&gt; This difference in prestige has led BASL speakers to [[code switching|code switch]] to a prestige dialect when speaking with different groups of people, despite BASL being [[mutually intelligible]] with other dialects of ASL.&lt;ref&gt;[[#CITEREFLewis1995|Lewis, et al. 1995]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Phonology==
[[File:Typical ASL Signing Space representation.svg|thumb|upright=0.5|alt=Silhouette of a man standing with a gray translucent box superimposed over his torso and face|The gray box represents the typical signing space of ASL. Signers of BASL are more likely to produce signs outside of this area than other signers.&lt;ref name="McCaskill104to105"&gt;[[#CITEREFMcCaskill2011|McCaskill, et al. 2011]], pp. 104–105&lt;/ref&gt;]]
When asked, many signers in the South gave anecdotal accounts of differences between the signing of Black and White signers. These differences turned out to be aspects of the differing [[American Sign Language phonology|phonology]] of BASL. Among these accounts were claims that Black signers had a larger signing space and used more two-handed signs. Investigation into these anecdotes has found correlations.&lt;ref&gt;[[#CITEREFMcCaskill2011|McCaskill, et al. 2011]], p. 75&lt;/ref&gt;

When compared, Black signers were more likely than were White signers to produce signs outside of the typical signing space and to use two-handed signs.&lt;ref name="McCaskill104to105" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#CITEREFMcCaskill2011|McCaskill, et al. 2011]], p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adverb]]s are most likely to use a larger signing space. Less [[Markedness|marked]] forms, such as [[pronoun]]s, [[determiner]]s, plain [[verb]]s, and [[noun]]s, tend to be less likely to be produced outside the typical signing space.&lt;ref name="McCaskill104to105" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#CITEREFMcCaskill2011|McCaskill, et al. 2011]], p. 101&lt;/ref&gt; The selection of two-handed signs over one-handed signs was found to have [[Optimality theory|systematic constraints]] on their production. When the sign could be produced with one or two hands, Black signers often produced the variant that matched the handedness of the following sign; if the following sign was two-handed, they were more likely to produce a two-handed variant, while if the following sign was one-handed, they were more likely to produce the one-handed variant. The use of innovative one-handed forms, though, even in environments which favored them, did not exceed 50 percent.&lt;ref&gt;[[#CITEREFMcCaskill2011|McCaskill, et al. 2011]], pp. 82–86&lt;/ref&gt;

BASL signers further tend to favor lowered variants of side-of-forehead signs resulting in contact at the cheek. The sign {{sc|Know}} is usually produced by placing the fingers of a flat hand on the [[temple (anatomy)|temple]], but when lowered the fingers make contact at the [[cheek]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#CITEREFMcCaskill2011|McCaskill, et al. 2011]], pp. 86–87&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#CITEREFLifeprint|Lifeprint]], n.d. [http://www.lifeprint.com/asl101/pages-signs/k/know.htm KNOW]&lt;/ref&gt; Early research showed that BASL signers used these lowered forms at a rate of 53 percent, with grammatical category being the strongest constraint.&lt;ref&gt;[[#CITEREFLucas2002|Lucas, et al. 2002]]&lt;/ref&gt; Other conditioning environments for lowered signs depend on preceding location; for instance, signs produced in front of the body lead to lowered sign variants, while signs produced at the head cause signers to favor non-lowered forms.&lt;ref&gt;[[#CITEREFMcCaskill2011|McCaskill, et al. 2011]], pp. 92–97&lt;/ref&gt;

==Syntax==
Unlike ASL, BASL allows for the frequent use of [[syntactic repetition]]. In a study conducted by McCaskill, of 26 signers (13 Black and 13 White), Black signers had 57 instances of repetition compared to 19 from White signers, and of those 19 instances, 18 were made by a single signer. The use of repetition by BASL signers is considered to be [[Pragmatics|pragmatic]] rather than as a way to clarify meaning.&lt;ref&gt;[[#CITEREFMcCaskill2011|McCaskill, et al. 2011]], p. 116&lt;/ref&gt;

A study in 2004 by Melanie Metzger and Susan Mather found that Black male signers used [[constructed action]], with or without [[constructed dialogue]], more often than White signers, but never used constructed dialogue by itself.&lt;ref&gt;[[#CITEREFMetzger2004|Metzger and Mathers 2004]]&lt;/ref&gt; These results were not reproduced in a later study into constructed action and constructed dialogue by McCaskill, which found that Black signers not only used constructed dialogue, but did so more frequently than white signers.&lt;ref&gt;[[#CITEREFMcCaskill2011|McCaskill, et al. 2011]], p. 122&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lexical variation==
[[Lexical variation]] between BASL and other dialects of ASL was first noted in the ''Dictionary of American Sign Language.''&lt;ref name=Dictionary&gt;[[#CITEREFStokoe1965|Stokoe 1965]], pp. 313–19&lt;/ref&gt; In a later study of 34 lexical signs, Black signers were found to have 28 signs that White signers did not know.&lt;ref&gt;[[#CITEREFLucas2014|Lucas and McCaskill 2014]], p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; Older signers are more likely to use variant signs than younger signers. Most of these signs, having been developed in segregated schools for the Black Deaf, refer to everyday life. Younger signers of BASL are less likely to use these variants, but when asked about them are aware that older signers have and use these innovative signs.&lt;ref&gt;[[#CITEREFMcCaskill2011|McCaskill, et al. 2011]], p. 150&lt;/ref&gt;

===Borrowing from African-American Vernacular English===
[[File:BentV@InForward.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.5|alt=Person in orange shirt with hand in front of him with index and middle fingers crooked creating a "bent - v" shape|The bent-v handshape used in the sign {{sc|Stop tripping}}]]
A body of work has arisen looking at the similarities between Black American Sign Language and [[African American Vernacular English|African-American English]] (AAVE), since both are language varieties marked by their use in African-American communities. In 1998 John Lewis investigated the incorporation of aspects of AAVE into BASL. He reported that, during narrative storytelling by a Black signer, there were "[[African American Vernacular English|Ebonic shifts]]" marked by shifts in posture and rhythmicity and by incorporating side-to-side head movement. He concluded that this "songified" quality was related to the style of AAE.&lt;ref&gt;[[#CITEREFLewis1998|Lewis, et al. 1998]]&lt;/ref&gt; This finding was not reproduced by McCaskill, which she attributes to the nature of the speech acts: Lewis analyzed a narrative event while McCaskill used natural or elicited data.&lt;ref&gt;[[#CITEREFMcCaskill2011|McCaskill, et al. 2011]], p. 133&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lexical borrowing]] has been seen in BASL signers under age 3, which is likely due to the advances in mass media—younger signers would have more contact with AAE through movies, television, and the Internet.&lt;ref name="Lucas2015"&gt;[[#CITEREFLucas2015|Lucas, et al. 2015]]&lt;/ref&gt;

When asked about distinctive features of their signing, Black Deaf signers tended to identify a number of idioms borrowed from AAVE.&lt;ref&gt;[[#CITEREFSolomon2010|Solomon 2010]], p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; Some were [[Calque|literal translations]], such as {{sc|I feel you}} or {{sc|girl please}}, which are signed the standard way but have meanings different from their literal interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;[[#CITEREFSolomon2010|Solomon 2010]], p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#CITEREFLucas2015|Lucas, et al. 2015]], Figure 3. p. 165&lt;/ref&gt; Other loan words modified existing signs, such as {{sc|stop tripping}}, which took the bent-v handshape of {{sc|trip}} and moved it up to the head to indicate a new meaning of "stop imagining things".&lt;ref&gt;[[#CITEREFLucas2015|Lucas, et al. 2015]], p. 163&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6702">The '''Priene Calendar Inscription''' is an inscription in stone recovered at [[Priene]] (an ancient Greek city sited in Western Turkey) that uses the term "[[The_gospel#Etymology|gospel]]" in referring to [[Augustus Caesar]]. It is called the Priene "Calendar" Inscription because it refers to the birthday of Augustus Caesar as the beginning of an [[calendar era|era]] - the beginning of the gospel announcing his kingdom that heralded peace and salvation for his people - and a Roman decree to start a new calendar system based on the year of Augustus Caesar's birth was published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Evans |first1=Craig A. |title=Mark’s Incipit and the Priene Calendar Inscription: From Jewish Gospel to Greco-Roman Gospel. |journal=Journal of Greco-Roman Christianity and Judaism. |date=2000 |volume=1 |pages=67–81 |url=http://www.craigaevans.com/Priene%20art.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.masseiana.org/priene.htm |website=THE PRIENE INSCRIPTION OR CALENDAR INSCRIPTION OF PRIENE.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Danker |first1=Frederick W. |title=Benefactor: Epigraphic Study of a Graeco-Roman and New Testament Semantic Field |date=1982 |publisher=Clayton Pub.

E. |last2=Berger |first2=K. |last3=Colpe |first3=C. |title=Hellenistic Commentary to the New Testament |date=1995 |publisher=Abingdon |location=Nashville |page=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; Calendar dating of history around a ruler is the principle upon which the [[Julian calendar]] and [[Gregorian calendar]]s are based.

The inscription features the term "gospel", which is the Old English translation of [[Koine Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|εὐαγγέλιον}}, ''evangelion'', meaning "good news".{{sfn|Woodhead|2004|p=4}} As exemplified in the Calendar Inscription of Priene, dated from 9 BC, this [[Koine Greek]] term {{lang|grc|εὐαγγέλιον}} was used at the time of the Roman Empire to herald the good news of the arrival of a kingdom - the reign of a king that brought a war to an end, so that all people of the world who surrendered and pledged allegiance to this king would be granted salvation from destruction. The Calendar Inscription of Priene speaks of the birthday of Caesar [[Augustus]] as the beginning of the gospel announcing his kingdom, with a Roman decree to start a new calendar system based on the year of Augustus Caesar's birth. Into this context, the words of the Gospel of Mark are striking: "The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God." (Mark 1:1 ESV)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Mark 1 |url=http://biblehub.com/esv/mark/1.htm |website=Biblehub |accessdate=26 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jesus]] is thus heralded as the king who ends war by conquering people's allegiance, in contrast to the Roman [[Caesar (title)]].

==Inscription text==
'It seemed good to the Greeks of Asia, in the opinion of the high priest Apollonius
of Menophilus Azanitus: “Since Providence, which has ordered all things and is
deeply interested in our life, has set in most perfect order by giving us Augustus,
whom she filled with virtue that he might benefit humankind, sending him as a
savior, both for us and for our descendants, that he might end war and
arrange all things, and since he, Caesar, by his appearance (excelled
even our anticipations), surpassing all previous benefactors, and not even leaving
to posterity any hope of surpassing what he has done, and since the birthday of the
god Augustus was the beginning of the good tidings for the world that came by
reason of him,” which Asia resolved in Smyrna.'

It is common in [[cathedral]]s and in [[Gothic arch]]es used in [[Gothic architecture]].&lt;ref name="American Scientist"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.americanscientist.org/issues/pub/2011/3/the-perfect-dome|title=Letter to the Editors: The Perfect Dome|author=Handy, Richard L.|date=May 2011|work=American Scientist}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not a [[parabolic arch]].

==In history==
[[File:17 Robert Hooke Engineer.JPG|thumb|250px|right|alt=Painting of Robert Hooke seated in a study, holding a small chain suspended between his hands by the ends|[[Robert Hooke]], holding a hanging [[chain]], which forms a catenary curve]]

The 17th-century scientist [[Robert Hooke]] wrote, "''Ut pendet continuum flexile, sic stabit contiguum rigidum inversum''", or, "As hangs a flexible cable so, inverted, stand the touching pieces of an arch." &lt;ref name="The enigma of Robert Hooke"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://quantumfrontiers.com/2015/08/31/the-enigma-of-robert-hooke/|title=The enigma of Robert Hooke|author=|date=31 August 2015|work=Quantum Frontiers|publisher=Institute for Quantum Information and Matter, California Institute of Technology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A note written by [[Thomas Jefferson]] in 1788 reads, "I have lately received from Italy a treatise on the equilibrium of arches, by the Abbé Mascheroni. It appears to be a very scientifical work. I have not yet had time to engage in it; but I find that the conclusions of his demonstrations are, that every part of the [[catenary]] is in perfect equilibrium".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jefferson|first1=Thomas|title=Memoir, Correspondence, and Miscellanies, from the Papers of Thomas Jefferson, Volume 2|date=1830|publisher=Gray and Bowen|location=Boston|page=416|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qjw-AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA416&amp;lpg=PA416|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structural properties==
What makes the catenary arch important is its ability to withstand weight.&lt;ref name="St. Louis Gateway Arch"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enchantedlearning.com/history/us/monuments/stlouisarch/|title=St. Louis Gateway Arch|author=|date=|work=enchantedlearning.com|accessdate=27 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="strath.ac.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://personal.strath.ac.uk/j.wood/Biomimetics/Engineering%20Areas/structures/PROP%201_files/PROP%201.htm|title=Building an arch that can stand up by itself|author=|date=|work=strath.ac.uk|accessdate=27 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; For an arch of uniform density and thickness, supporting only its own weight, the catenary is the ideal curve.&lt;ref name="The inverted catenary arch"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zonedome.com/?p=167|title=The inverted catenary arch|author=|date=|work=zonedome.com|accessdate=27 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is done by a catenary curve: Catenary arches are strong, as they redirect the vertical force of gravity into compression forces pressing along the arch's curve. In a uniformly loaded catenary arch, the [[line of thrust]] runs through its center.&lt;ref name="Build an arch that can stand up by itself"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.exploratorium.edu/files/cmp/exnet/exhibits/group1/catenary_arch/media/catenary_g.pdf|title=Build an arch that can stand up by itself|author=|date=|work=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Getting the arch back into architecture"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://publications.lib.chalmers.se/records/fulltext/203465/203465.pdf|title=Getting the arch back into architecture|author=Karl Robin Nilsson|date=|work=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term “'''collateral warranty'''” originates in [[property law]]. In 1839 Francis Hilliard wrote: “''A collateral warranty is where the heir neither does nor could derive his title to the land from the warrantor; and yet is both de-barred from claiming title and bound to recompense in case of eviction.”''.&lt;ref&gt;“An Abridgement of the American Law of Real Property”, by Francis Hilliard counsellor at Law, Volume II, entered accordingly to Act of Congress in the year 1839.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of collateral warranty was sometimes regarded as ''“[…] the most unjust, oppressive, and indefensible in the whole range of common law.”''
''.&lt;ref&gt;“An Abridgement of the American Law of Real Property”, by Francis Hilliard counsellor at Law, Volume II, entered accordingly to Act of Congress in the year 1839.&lt;/ref&gt;

The meaning is different when considering the actual and most common use of the term. Today a '''collateral warranty''' generally defines an agreement ancillary to another principal [[contract]] and/or a letter of appointment. For the benefice of a third party, it imposes an extended [[duty of care]] and a broader [[public liability|liability]] on two separate parties involved in a contract. Collateral warranties may be provided by [[designers]], [[building contractor]]s and specialist [[sub-contractor]]s. The need for collateral warranties exists when the party that commissions a building will not carry the burden in the event of defects.

For instance, when an architect is appointed to design a group of dwellings for a developer. If the developer intends to sell the building to a [[housing association]], due to [[privity of contract]] the architect would normally only be contractually liable to the developer should defects arise. The collateral warranty establishes a contractual relationship between the housing association and the architect against defect.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1227">In a historical context, a '''covenant''' applies to formal promises that were made under [[oath]], or in less remote history, agreements in which the name actually uses the term 'covenant', implying that they were binding for all time.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} One of the earliest attested covenants between parties is the so-called Mitanni treaty, dating to the 14th or 15th century BC, between the [[Hittites]] and the [[Mitanni]].

Historically, certain treaties and compacts have been given the name "covenant", most notably the [[Solemn League and Covenant]] that marked the [[Covenanter]]s, a [[Protestant]] political organization important in the [[history of Scotland]]. The term 'covenant' appears throughout Scottish, English and Irish history.

The term covenant could be used in English to refer to either the [[Bundesbrief]] of 1291, or the [[Pfaffenbrief]] of 1370, documents which led to the formation of the Swiss state or "[[Eidgenossenschaft]]". In this usage the German "''Eid''" is being translated as "covenant" rather than "oath" in order to reflect its written status.

[[File:Earth-lighting-winter-solstice EN.png|thumb|right|300px|[[daylight|Illumination]] of [[Earth]] by the [[Sun]] on the day of the December [[solstice]]]]
The '''December solstice''', also known as the '''southern solstice''', is the [[solstice]] that occurs each December, typically between the 20th and the 22nd day of the month according to the [[Gregorian calendar]]. In the [[Southern Hemisphere]], the December solstice is the [[summer solstice]], whilst in the [[Northern Hemisphere]] it is the [[winter solstice]].

==Solar year==
The December solstice solar year is the [[solar year]] based on the December solstice. It is thus the length of time between adjacent December solstices.

The length of the December solstice year has been relatively stable between 6000 BC and 2000 at 49:30 (minutes:seconds) to 50:00 in excess of 365 days and 5 hours. After 2000 it is getting shorter. In 4000 the excess time will be 48:52 and in 10000 46:45.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://individual.utoronto.ca/kalendis/leap/Solar-Year-Length-Variations.pdf| title=Solar Year Length Variations on Earth | publisher=University of Toronto, Canada | accessdate=21 December 2012 | author=Bromberg,  Irv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The figures in the charts show the differences between the Gregorian calendar and [[Iranian calendar|Persian ''Jalāli'' calendar]] in reference to the actual yearly time of the Southern solstice. The error shifts by slightly less than 1/4 day per year; in the Gregorian calendar it is corrected by a leap year every 4th year, omitting three such corrections in every 400 years, so that the average length of a calendar year is 365 97/400 days; while in the Persian calendar every eighth leap-cycle is extended to 5 years, making the average 365 8/33 days, shorter than the Gregorian average by one day every 13200 years.

The date of the solstice is not the same as the date of the latest sunrise and both are not the same as the date of earliest sunset. Because the Earth is moving along its solar orbital path, for each [[solar day]] the Earth has to do more than one full rotation. Because the Earth's orbit is elliptical, the speed at which the Earth moves along its orbit varies. Consequently, solar days are not the same length throughout the year. "[[Local mean time|Mean time]]" is our way of modifying this, for our convenience, making each day the same length, i.e. 24 hours. The maximum correction (see [[Equation of Time]]) is ± 15 minutes to the mean but its value changes quite rapidly around the solstices. If solar time were used rather than mean time, the latest sunrise and earliest sunset and therefore also the shortest day would all be at the December solstice in the northern hemisphere; the opposite would be true in the southern hemisphere, with the earliest sunrise, latest sunset, and longest day.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4169">'''Digital repatriation''' is the return of items of cultural heritage in a digital format to the communities from which they originated. The term originated from within [[anthropology]], and typically referred to the creation of [[digital photography|digital photographs]] of [[ethnography|ethnographic]] material which would then be made available to members of the originating culture.&lt;ref name="DPIC"&gt;{{cite web|title=Digital Repatriation and Virtual Exhibition|url=https://www.sas.upenn.edu/dpic/Drum/Welcome/VirtualMuseum|website=Digital Partnerships with Indian Communities|publisher=University of Pennsylvania,  School of Arts &amp; Sciences|accessdate=26 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the term has also been applied to museum, library, and archives collections&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://americanindian.si.edu/explore/collections/repatriation/%5D|title=Repatriation {{!}} National Museum of the American Indian|website=americanindian.si.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and can refer not only to digital photographs but digital collections and virtual exhibits including 3D scans and audio recordings.&lt;ref&gt;Roy, Loriene &amp; Christal, Mark (2002). "Digital Repatriation: Constructing a Culturally Responsive Virtual Museum Tour". ''Journal of Library and Information Science''. '''28'''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Digital repatriation is becoming increasingly relevant as more cultural institutions make their collections available online. This increased access is sometimes at odds with the desires of the originating culture, since it limits their ability to curate and define terms of access to their cultural materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Christen|first=Kimberly|date=2011|title=Opening Archives: Respectful Repatriation|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/23079006|journal=The American Archivist|volume=74|issue=1|pages=185–210}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many cultural institutions are making efforts to involve communities in collection display and description.


==Digital repatriation and digital surrogates==
When calls for artefacts to be repatriated relate to ancient items or material which is in the public domain, the call for the creation and wide-scale distribution of digital surrogates has been made by Clifford Lynch. He sees the creation of high quality digital surrogates as important. These, he argues, provide an insurance against the destruction of the original objects, and also give scholars access to the surrogates, regardless of where the original artefacts maybe located.&lt;ref name="Lynch"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lynch |first1=Clifford |title=Repatriation, Reconstruction, and Cultural Diplomacy in the Digital World |journal=EDUCAUSE Review |date=2008 |volume=43 |issue=1, (January/February 2008) |pages=70–71 |url=https://er.educause.edu/articles/2008/1/repatriation-reconstruction-and-cultural-diplomacy-in-the-digital-world |accessdate=24 November 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;


==Examples==
The [[National Museum of the American Indian]] (USA) and the [[Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa]] have been particularly active in bicultural co-curation of digital material.&lt;ref name="Basu"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Basu|first1=Paul|title=Reanimating Cultural Heritage Digital Curatorship, Knowledge Networks, and Social Transformation in Sierra Leone Paul|journal=The International Handbooks of Museum Studies|date=2015|volume=Museum Transformations|pages=337–364}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Local Contexts initiative has developed Traditional Knowledge labels, which institutions can utilize in digital collections to allow communities to designate certain material as restricted for access or use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://localcontexts.org/tk-labels/|title=Traditional Knowledge (TK) Labels - Local Contexts|work=Local Contexts|access-date=2018-11-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; This allows for online access to community materials while respecting the origin culture’s traditions and wishes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://localcontexts.org/tk-labels/|title=Traditional Knowledge (TK) Labels - Local Contexts|work=Local Contexts|access-date=2018-11-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Down Girl: The Logic of Misogyny''''' is a book by [[Kate Manne]], treating [[misogyny]] in tradition of analytic feminist philosophy.&lt;ref name=global&gt;Manne, Kate [https://global.oup.com/academic/product/down-girl-9780190604981?q=down%20girl&amp;lang=en&amp;cc=us "Down Girl: The Logic of Misogyny"], Published 8 November 2017 by Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|9780190604981}}, Retrieved on 12 November 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

Manne proposes that [[patriarchy]], [[sexism]], and misogyny are distinct: sexism is an ideology justifying patriarchy, while misogyny enforces patriarchy by punishing women who deviate from patriarchy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/dec/20/down-girl-kate-manne-review "Guardian Review"], Retrieved on 12 November 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; Manne believes dehumanization of women is not necessary for misogynist violence.&lt;ref&gt;[https://kiej.georgetown.edu/kate-manne-girl-logic-misogyny-oxford-university-press-2017/ "Book Review by Kennedy Institute of Ethics Journal"], Retrieved on 12 November 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

No record has been found of any of these discs being displayed in any of the world's museums, and their current whereabouts are unknown.

==Tsum Um Nui==
In 1962 Tsum Um Nui ({{zh|c=楚聞明|p=Chǔ Wénmíng}}) was reported to have concluded that the grooves on the discs were actually very tiny hieroglyphs, none of which were of a pattern that had been seen before, and which can only be seen with the use of a magnifying glass. He announced that he had deciphered them into a story that told of a spacecraft that crash landed in the area of the cave, the [[Bayan Har Mountains]], and that the ship contained the Dropa people who could not fix it and therefore had to adapt to Earth. Further, his research claims that the Dropa people were hunted down and killed by the local [[Han Chinese]] for a period.&lt;ref name=BadArchaeology/&gt; Tsum Um Nui noted specifically that one glyph apparently said: "The Dropa came down from the clouds in their aircraft. Our men, women and children hid in the caves ten times before sunrise. When at last we understood the sign language of the Dropas, we realized that the newcomers had peaceful intentions".&lt;ref name=Hausdorf&gt;{{cite book |last=Hausdorf |first=Hartwig |title=The Chinese Roswell: UFO encounters in the Far East from ancient times to the present |year=1998 |publisher=New Paradigm Books |isbn=978-1-892138-00-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tsum Um Nui is said to have published his findings in 1962 in a professional journal, and was subsequently ridiculed and met with disbelief. Shortly afterwards he is said to have gone to Japan in a self-imposed exile, where he died not long after he completed the manuscript of his work.&lt;ref name=BadArchaeology/&gt;

==Russian examination==
[[Russians|Russian]] researchers requested the discs for studying, and allegedly several were shipped to [[Moscow]]. Once there, it is said that they were scraped for loose particles and put through a chemical analysis which revealed that they contained large amounts of [[cobalt]] and other metallic substances. As recorded in the Soviet magazine ''[[Sputnik (magazine)|Sputnik]]'', Dr. Vyatcheslav Saizev describes an experiment where the discs were supposedly placed on a special turntable whereby they were shown to 'vibrate' or 'hum' in an unusual rhythm as though an electric charge is passing through them.&lt;ref name=Fanthorpe/&gt;

==Ernst Wegerer==
Supposedly, Ernst Wegerer (Wegener) was an [[Austria]]n [[engineer]] who, in 1974, visited the [[Banpo Museum]] in Xi'an, Shaanxi Province, where he saw two of the Dropa stones.&lt;ref name=BadArchaeology/&gt; It is said that when he enquired about the discs the manager could tell him nothing, but permitted him to take one in his hand and photograph them. He claims that in his photos the hieroglyphs cannot be seen as they have been hidden by the flash from the camera and have also deteriorated. By 1994, the discs and the manager had disappeared from the museum.&lt;ref name=Hausdorf/&gt;

== Publications ==

A reference to the Dropa and Dropa stones is found in the July 1962 edition of the [[Germany|German]] vegetarian magazine ''Das vegetarische Universum''.&lt;ref name=Wonders&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vallée|first1=Jacques|last2=Aubeck|first2=Chris|authorlink1=Jacques Vallée|title=Wonders in the Sky: Unexplained Aerial Objects from Antiquity to Modern Times|date=2010|publisher=Penguin/Putnam|isbn=978-1585428205|pages=359–362}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980, they are mentioned in the book ''[[Sungods in Exile]]'' by David Agamon (real name David A. Gamon). This book is written as if it were a documentary of a 1947 expedition with the scientist Karyl Robin-Evans. It follows his supposed travels into the secluded region of the Bayan-Kara-Ula mountain range where he finds dwarfish people called the Dropa. According to his book, the Dropa population consisted of a few hundred members all of which were approximately {{convert|4|feet}} tall. Robin-Evans allegedly lived among the Dropa for half a year and during that time he learned their language and history, and also impregnated one of the Dropa women. He was told that they had crashed there long ago and that their ancestor had come from a planet in the Sirius constellation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Agamon |first=David |title=Sungods in Exile: Secrets of the Dzopa of Tibet|year=1980 |publisher=Sphere |isbn=978-0-7221-7417-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gamon later revealed in the British publication ''[[Fortean Times]]'' that his book was a hoax and that Karyl Robin-Evans was entirely fictitious, as was his expedition.&lt;ref&gt;http://ufologie.patrickgross.org/htm/dropasagamon.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In Japan, they were mentioned in 1996 when a translated version of Hartwig Hausdorf and Peter Krassa's ''Satelliten der Götter'' (''Satellites of the Gods'') is released.&lt;ref name=Hausdorf/&gt;

== Controversies ==
[[File:Bì (bi4) 璧 disc.jpg|thumb|A [[Han dynasty|Han]]-era [[bi (jade)|''bì'' (璧)]], {{convert|16|cm}} in diameter.]]

It has been claimed that Tsum Um Nui is not a real Chinese name. There is no mention of him in [[China]] outside his connection to the Dropa stones.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} According to Dropa enthusiast Hartwig Hausdorf, Tsum Um Nui is a "former Japanese name, but adapted to Chinese language".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Hausdorf |first=Hartwig |title=The Dropa- The Chinese Pyramids |url=http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/arqueologia/esp_dropa_6.htm |accessdate=17 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nor is there any mention in any records about Chi Pu Tei's expedition in 1938.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

''Sungods in Exile'', with its account of Karyl Robin-Evans in all appearances gave credibility to Dropa stones until 1988, when David A. Gamon told ''Fortean Times'' magazine that the book was fiction and Karyl Robin-Evans imaginary.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

The stone discs were supposedly stored in various museums across China. However, none of these museums have any records or traces of Dropa stones ever being there.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

According to the Gould-Parkinson system of transliteration, "Drop-ka" is [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan]] for "solitude" or "inhabitant of pasture lands". It is said to be the name of a tribe of Tibetan nomadic herders on the eastern Tibetan plateau.&lt;ref name=BadArchaeology/&gt;

With Wegerer's photos lacking concrete evidence of the hieroglyphs, they display similarity to [[bi (jade)|''bì'' disc]]s. ''Bì'' are round jade discs with holes in their centres. When buried in the earth, the minerals change them to be multi-colored. ''Bì'' have been dated to 3000 BCE and were common in what is now [[Shaanxi]]. Some ''bì'' are decorated with parallel grooves and other markings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Jinsha Site: A 21st Century Discovery of Chinese Archaeology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v7KgEdSjidoC&amp;pg=PA37|year=2006|publisher=五洲传播出版社|isbn=978-7-5085-0854-2|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''European Heritage Label''' is a recognition awarded by the [[European Union]] to buildings, documents, museums, archives, monuments or events which are seen as milestones in the creation of today's Europe. The program is managed by the [[European Commission]].

==History==

===Intergovernmental initiative===
[[File:Patrimoineeuropeen.png|thumb|Logo for the former intergovernmental scheme]]
The European Heritage Label started as an intergovernmental initiative between 17 individual EU member states during a meeting in [[Granada]], [[Spain]] on 28 April 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thenewfederalist.eu/The-New-European-Heritage-Label-is-Here,05718 | publisher=The New Federalist | title=The New European Heritage Label is Here! | first=Ferghane | last=Azihari | date=27 April 2013 | accessdate=23 April 2016 | archiveurl= | archivedate=23 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Motivations for creating the initiative included the 2005 referenda in France and the Netherlands, which resulted in the two countries not ratifying a constitution for Europe. The initiative's main aim was to identify and designate sites which have played a key role in building a united Europe and to see those sites through a European, rather than national, viewpoint.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.academia.edu/17343457/Transnational_Heritage_in_the_Making._Strategies_for_Narrating_Cultural_Heritage_as_European_in_the_Intergovernmental_Initiative_of_the_European_Heritage_Label._Ethnologica_Europaea_44_1_75_93_2014._Final_Draft_]"&lt;/ref&gt;

The intergovernmental initiative connected both EU member states and non-member states such as Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://euobserver.com/news/29647]"&lt;/ref&gt; The participating countries’ heritage agencies awarded the Label to sites with cross-border or pan-European character.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32011D1194&amp;from=EN]"&lt;/ref&gt; The countries chose their own cultural assets, whether physical sites or more abstract traditions, meaning that the criteria for the Label varied per country. By 2010, 64 sites in 18 different participating countries had been awarded the intergovernmental label.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-10-250_en.htm]"&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transformation into an EU initiative ===

On 20 November 2008, the Council adopted conclusions aimed at transforming the intergovernmental initiative into a Union action by inviting the Commission to submit to it a proposal for the creation by the Union of a European Heritage Label and to specify the practical procedures for the implementation of the project.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32011D1194&amp;from=EN]"&lt;/ref&gt; Public hearings and impact assessments were carried out, confirming the added value of EU involvement. In 2010, the European Commission announced the plans for the EU-wide scheme known as the European Heritage Label&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-15755426]"&lt;/ref&gt; and it was officially established on 16 November 2011.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32011D1194&amp;from=EN]"&lt;/ref&gt;

==European Heritage Label from 2013==

Under the new Label, the first four sites were designated in 2013, with sixteen more designations following in 2014.

Candidate sites for the label must have a symbolic European value and must have played a significant role in the history and culture of Europe and/or the building of the Union. They must therefore demonstrate one or more of the following:

# their cross-border or pan-European nature: how their past and present influence and attraction go beyond the national borders of a Member State;
# their place and role in European history and European integration, and their links with key European events, personalities or movements;
# their place and role in the development and promotion of the common values that underpin European integration.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32011D1194&amp;from=EN]"&lt;/ref&gt;

During the pre-selection stage, EU countries may choose up to two sites biennially, following which, at selection stage, a panel of 13 independent experts select and monitor the sites. The panel examines the applications and recommends to the European Commission which sites should be awarded the label on the basis of an established set of criteria. Candidate sites must also submit a work plan.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://one-europe.info/initiative/the-european-heritage-label]"&lt;/ref&gt;

Conservation is a positive endeavour  including “… the preservation, maintenance, sustainable  use, restoration, and enhancement  of the natural environment”.&lt;ref&gt;IUCN, UNEP and  WWF,  World Conservation Strategy: Living Resource Conservation for Sustainable  Development, IUCN, Gland  (Switzerland),  1980&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Protected Areas|Protected Area]] is "“...a  clearly defined geographical space,  recognised, dedicated and managed, through legal or other effective means,  to achieve the long-term conservation of nature with associated [[ecosystem services]] and cultural values”.&lt;ref&gt;Dudley, N. (Editor) (2008). Guidelines for Applying Protected Area Management Categories. Gland, Switzerland: IUCN. x + 86pp. {{ISBN|978-2-8317-1086-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This IUCN definition applies  equally to land, inland waters and coastal and marine territories and areas  and is widely considered  to be equivalent to the [[Convention on Biological Diversity|CBD]] definition.

[[Governance]] is (the process of) “…interactions among structures, processes and traditions that determine how power and responsibilities are exercised, how decisions are taken and how citizens or other stakeholders have their say…”.&lt;ref&gt;Graham, J., Amos, B., Plumptre, T., 2003. Governance Principles for Protected Areas in the 21st century. Institute On Governance in collaboration with Parks Canada and Canadian International Development Agency, Ottawa.&lt;/ref&gt; In less elegant, but possibly clearer words, governance is about taking decisions and ensuring the conditions for their effective implementation. It is the process of developing and exercising authority and responsibility over time. It is about who takes decisions, and how, including in relation to learning processes and evolving institutions in society.

Governance is related to management but different from it. What is the difference? Management is about what is done in pursuit of given objectives. Governance is about who decides about what is to be done, and how those decisions are taken. It is about who holds power, authority and responsibility and who is, or should be, held accountable. Governance is nothing new: someone, somewhere, has always  been taking decisions  about  protected and conserved areas. What is new is that we are now paying  better attention to governance, adding visibility, articulating concepts, and monitoring and evaluating  practice. There is no ideal governance setting for protected  or conserved areas, but a set of “good  governance” principles  can  always  be taken into account. Governance is appropriate only when tailored  to its specific context and effective in delivering lasting conservation  results, livelihood benefits and the respect  of rights.

== Why governance? ==
Governance can be  improved and provide precious help  in facing  on-going challenges and global change. 
* Governance is the variable  with greatest  potential  to affect conservation coverage.
* Governance is a main factor in determining the effectiveness and efficiency of management.
* Governance is a determinant  of appropriateness and equity of decisions.
* Governance can  ensure that protected  areas are better embedded in society.&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, A., “Turning ideas  on their head – the new paradigm for protected  areas”, pages 1-28  in Jaireth, H. and  D. Smyth, Innovative Governance, Ane Books, Delhi, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Borrini-Feyerabend, G.,  N. Dudley, T. Jaeger, B. Lassen, N. Pathak Broome, A. Phillips and  T. Sandwith,  Governance of Protected Areas: From understanding to action, Best Practice Protected Area Guidelines  Series No.  20,  IUCN, Gland  (Switzerland),  2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Borrini-Feyerabend, G. and  R. Hill , “Governance for the conservation of nature”,  in Worboys, G. L., M. Lockwood, A. Kothari, S. Feary and  I. Pulsford (eds), Protected Area Governance and Management, ANU Press, Canberra, 2014 (in press).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Governance at the IUCN World Parks Congress ==

The [[IUCN|IUCN World Parks Congress]] is held once every decade. Since the Congress in [[Durban]] (2003), governance has been a recurring stream in the deliberations of the Congress. [http://www.worldparkscongress.org/programme/stream_enhancing_the_diversity_and_quality_of_governance.html Governance] was also a major stream at the [[IUCN World Parks Congress 2014]]. The stream, among other things, published a [http://worldparkscongress.org/drupal/node/82 primer] to develop a basic lexicon in the hope that speaking “a common language” may help to better communicate and develop concepts of increasing clarity and meaning.

== Governance Diversity ==

We speak of governance  diversity for protected and conserved areas  when decisions are made by a variety of actors who enrich and strengthen conservation in practice.  For instance, a national system of protected areas  can “enhance  governance  diversity” by including in the system areas  governed by different types of actors and under different arrangements,  and/or by providing better recognition and support to conserved territories and areas  outside the system.

=== Four main governance types ===

The [[IUCN]] and [[Convention on Biological Diversity|CBD]] distinguish four broad governance types for protected and conserved areas&lt;ref&gt;Secretariat of the Convention  on Biological Diversity (SCBD), Biodiversity Issues for Consideration in the Planning, Establishment and Management of Protected Area Sites and Networks, CBD Technical Series no 15,  SCBD, Montreal  (Canada), 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dudley, N.,  Guidelines  for Applying Protected Area Management Categories, IUCN, Gland (Switzerland),  2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Borrini-Feyerabend, G.,  N. Dudley, T. Jaeger, B. Lassen, N. Pathak Broome, A. Phillips and  T. Sandwith,  Governance of Protected Areas: From understanding to action, Best Practice Protected Area Guidelines  Series No.  20,  IUCN, Gland  (Switzerland),  2013&lt;/ref&gt; according to the actors who take or took the fundamental decisions about them (e.g. the actors that “established” them and decided their main purpose and management).
The four main governance types are:
*Type A. governance by government (at various levels and possibly combining various agencies)
*Type B. governance by various rightsholders and stakeholders together (shared governance)
*Type C. governance by private individuals and organizations (usually the landholders)
*Type D. governance by indigenous peoples and/or local communities (often referred to as ICCAs)

=== ICCAs ===

[[Indigenous and community conserved area|ICCAs]] is an abbreviation that refers to the territories and  areas conserved  by indigenous peoples  and  local communities. There are three essential characteristics common to ICCAs:&lt;ref&gt;Borrini-Feyerabend, G.,  B. Lassen, S. Stevens, G. Martin, JC Riasco de la Peña,  E. Raéz Luna and M.T. Farvar, Bio-cultural Diversity Conserved  by Indigenous  Peoples &amp; Local Communities: Examples &amp; Analysis,  IUCN, UNDP GEF SGP, GIZ and  CENESTA, Tehran, 2010 (reprinted  2012)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kothari, A. with C. Corrigan, H. Jonas,  A. Neumann, and  H. Shrumm (eds.), Recognising  and Supporting  Territories and Areas Conserved  by Indigenous  Peoples And  Local Communities: Global  Overview and National  Case  Studies,  CBD Technical Series no. 64,  Secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity, ICCA Consortium, IUCN/TILCEPA, Kalpavriksh and  Natural Justice, SCBD, Montreal  (Canada), 2012&lt;/ref&gt;
* an indigenous people  or local community possesses a close and  profound  relation with a site (territory, area or habitat)
* the people  or community is the major player  in decision- making related  to the site and  has de facto and/or de jure capacity to develop  and  enforce  regulations
* the people’s or community’s decisions and efforts lead to the conservation of biodiversity, ecological functions and associated cultural values, regardless  of original or primary motivations

Management categories and governance types are independent and can be juxtaposed in the “IUCN Matrix”,&lt;ref&gt;Dudley, N.,  Guidelines  for Applying Protected Area Management Categories, IUCN, Gland (Switzerland),  2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Borrini-Feyerabend, G.,  N. Dudley, T. Jaeger, B. Lassen, N. Pathak Broome, A. Phillips and  T. Sandwith,  Governance of Protected Areas: From understanding to action, Best Practice Protected Area Guidelines  Series No.  20,  IUCN, Gland  (Switzerland),  2013&lt;/ref&gt; visualizing a spectrum of area-based options to conserve nature in a given region/ system. The IUCN Matrix can be used to situate protected areas but also conserved territories and areas (the management category, in such case, would not correspond to a key objective but to an observed result).

Conservation depends on well governed systems of protected  and  conserved  areas in the landscape and  seascape and systems  are  made  stronger  by governance  diversity.

=== Conserved Territories or Areas ===
Conserved  territories or areas are  “…area-based measure  that— regardless of recognition  and dedication and  at times even regardless of explicit and  conscious  management practices—  achieve conservation de facto and/or is in a positive conservation trend and  likely to maintain this trend in the long term…”.&lt;ref&gt;Borrini-Feyerabend, G. and  R. Hill , “Governance for the conservation of nature”,  in Worboys, G. L., M. Lockwood, A. Kothari, S. Feary and  I. Pulsford (eds), Protected Area Governance and Management, ANU Press, Canberra, 2014 (in press)&lt;/ref&gt;  This definition applies  equally to land,  inland  waters  and coastal  and  marine territories and  areas.
The governance types apply  to both protected  areas and  conserved territories and  areas that are  NOT recognised as “protected” by the IUCN or any specific national  government.  In this sense,  the terms “Privately Conserved  Areas”  and  “ICCAs” encompass extents of land, inland waters and  coastal  and  marine  territories and  areas that go beyond  those recognised as “protected” by either national  government  or the IUCN.

===Voluntary and ancillary conservation===
Many systems of land and  water  management support high levels of biodiversity,  including critical biodiversity,  outside the formal system of protected  areas, in sites such a tourism and commercial hunting reserves,  private  estates  or village forests. The term voluntary  conservation &lt;ref&gt;Lausche, B. and  F. Burhenne,  Guidelines  for Protected Area Legislation, IUCN, Gland (Switzerland),  2011&lt;/ref&gt; captures the idea  that those who exercise governance do so consciously and  without restriction, in ways that are  fully compatible with conserving biodiversity values while they may or not see conservation as the primary objective  of their management efforts. In other cases, as in military no-go areas or areas abandoned after a natural or man-made  disaster,  the term ancillary conservation is more appropriate, since conservation is an entirely unintended (though welcome) consequence of management for other purposes.
Conservation in the landscape and  seascape is the result of various area-based and  non-area- based measures. Among area-based measures  we find both protected  areas and  conserved territories and areas. Crucially, those should be biologically,  but also socially, well connected.

===Systems of protected  and conserved  areas===
A well-functioning  system of  protected   and  conserved  areas is complete and well-connected in conserving  the representative features  and  functions of nature  in a given environment.

===Other effective area- based conservation measures (OECMs)===
The term “other effective area-based conservation measures”– abbreviated as OECMs—is used by the Convention on Biological Diversity to refer to territories and areas that are  effectively conserved but not part of the official protected  area system of a given country. In this sense,  OECMs can  be seen as “clearly defined  geographical space where  de facto conservation of nature  and  associated ecosystem services and  cultural values is achieved and  expected to be maintained in the long-term regardless of specific recognition  and  dedication”  (11). OECMs can include the following:
* Primary voluntary conservation that the national  government  does  not wish to recognise as a protected  area
* Primary voluntary conservation that refuses the protected  area label and/or inclusion in the national  system (e.g.  because of self- determination  and  self-governance  issues)
* Secondary voluntary conservation
* Ancillary conservation with a reasonable expectation to be maintained in the long-term
The following Table summarises  various ways of classifying conservation efforts and  results:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Conserved  areas (conserved de facto with a reasonable expectation that conservation will be maintained in the long term) !! Conservation  of nature  is the primary management objective !! Conservation  of nature  is not the primary management objective
|-
| The State government recognizes  it as part of its system of protected  areas || The area is a protected  area both according to the IUCN and  in the country at stake || The area is a protected area in the country at stake, although  not internationally; it likely comprises  voluntary conservation; it can  comprise ancillary conservation; it can be considered an OECM from an international  point 
|-
| The State government does not recognize  it as part of its system of protected  areas || The area is a protected area according to the IUCN (but not recognized as such nationally); the area most likely comprises  voluntary conservation; the IUCN recommends to nationally consider  it as an OECM
 || The area is neither recognized as a protected area nationally  nor internationally;  it likely comprises  voluntary conservation and/or ancillary conservation; the area can  be considered nationally  as an OECM

==Governance quality==

===IUCN principles  of good governance for protected  areas===
We  speak  of governance quality when decisions  are  made  while respecting the “good governance” principles developed through time by a variety of peoples, nations  and  UN agencies. A simple and compact  formulation of the “IUCN principles  of good  governance for protected  areas”,&lt;ref&gt;Borrini-Feyerabend, G.,  N. Dudley, T. Jaeger, B. Lassen, N. Pathak Broome, A. Phillips and  T. Sandwith,  Governance of Protected Areas: From understanding to action, Best Practice Protected Area Guidelines  Series No.  20,  IUCN, Gland  (Switzerland),  2013&lt;/ref&gt;  includes:

* Legitimacy and  voice— i.e. enjoying broad acceptance and appreciation in society; ensuring procedural rights of access  to information, participation  and justice; fostering engagement and  diversity; preventing  discrimination; fostering subsidiarity, mutual respect,  dialogue, consensus  and  agreed rules…
* Direction— i.e. following an inspiring and  consistent strategic  vision grounded on agreed values and  an appreciation of complexities; ensuring consistency with policy and practice  at various levels; ensuring clear answers  to contentious questions;  ensuring proper  [[adaptive management]] and  favouring the emergence of champions  and  tested innovations…
* Performance—i.e. achieving  conservation  and  other objectives as planned; promoting a culture of learning;  engaging in advocacy and  outreach;  being  responsive  to the needs  of rightsholders  and  stakeholders; ensuring resources  and  capacities and  their efficient use; promoting sustainability and  resilience…
* Accountability—i.e.  upholding  integrity and  commitment; ensuring appropriate access  to information and  transparency, including for lines of responsibility, allocation of resources,  and  evaluation  of performances; establishing  communication avenues  and encouraging feed-back  and  independent overseeing…
* Fairness and rights—i.e. striving towards equitably shared costs and benefits, without adverse impact for vulnerable people; upholding decency and the dignity of all; being fair, impartial, consistent, non discriminatory, respectful of procedural rights as well as substantive rights, individual and collective human rights, gender equity and the rights of indigenous peoples, including Free, Prior and Informed Consent; promoting local empowerment in conservation…

Thus, a “good governance” situation is one in which decisions  are  taken legitimately, competently,  fairly, with sense  of vision, accountability and  while respecting rights.

===Equitable and effective governance===
The IUCN good  governance situation can  also be summed up as “equitable and  effective governance”. The criteria of legitimacy,  voice, fairness and  (procedural and  substantive) rights contribute to equitable governance. The criteria of direction,  performance and  accountability lead  to governance that is effective.

===Substantive and  procedural rights===
Rights are  usefully distinguished  between substantive and  procedural. Procedural  rights, such as the rights to information,  participation and  access to justice, govern the process  of determining  and adjudicating substantive rights. In turn, substantive rights refer
to the specific powers  and  obligations of individuals and  collective bodies  under accepted customs and legislation.  They span  from basic human  rights (e.g. life, liberty) to material  and  financial rights under specific contractual conditions  (e.g.  access  to a given territory). Procedural  and  substantive rights deserve  respect  in relation to both protected
and  conserved areas and  territories

==Governance vitality==
We  speak  of governance vitality when decision-making actors and  institutions are functional, responsive and  thriving, meeting their role and  responsibilities in timely and appropriate ways. Vitality is expressed  by several of these properties:

* Integration and  connectivity —i.e. having abundant and  meaningful interactions with diverse actors, sectors and  levels of decision-making in society, including those interactions that characterise a system versus scattered  and  isolated single protected  areas, and those interactions that render  decisions effective through the generation of political, social and financial support…
* Adaptability –i.e. being reflexive and  flexible, able to accommodate circumstances, integrate knowledge  from different cultures, learn from experience and  weigh options through dialogue, exchanges, experiment and  debate…  able to take rapid  and  meaningful decisions even under challenging  circumstances...
* Wisdom —i.e. being aware  and respectful of the socio-ecological history and traditional worldviews, knowledge  and  values of the relevant environment and  communities; governing situations of meaningful scope  (e.g. regarding the size and  coherence of the units to manage, the number of actors to involve…) and  in line with solidarity rather than self-interest only (e.g. sharing benefits, avoiding  accumulation  and  waste,  keeping  in mind future generations); not only allowing, but fostering the engagement of as many relevant actors in society as possible…
* Innovation and  creativity — i.e. openness  to new ideas,  ability to re-invent and  renew itself as only a living system does,  ability to conceive and  implement new solutions, support the emergence of new rules and  norms, respond  positively to change and continue to develop…
* Empowerment  – i.e. being self-conscious, self-directed, willing and  capable of demonstrating leadership, such as by organizing timely responses  to emerging  environmental conditions, problems and opportunities… but also being self-disciplined and  self-critical, able to take on responsibilities in effective and  dependable ways…
 
While governance diversity and  quality have  been  explored rather  exhaustively,  the concept of governance vitality has only recently been  identified for further consideration.&lt;ref&gt;Borrini-Feyerabend, G. and  R. Hill , “Governance for the conservation of nature”,  in Worboys, G. L., M. Lockwood, A. Kothari, S. Feary and  I. Pulsford (eds), Protected Area Governance and Management, ANU Press, Canberra, 2014 (in press).&lt;/ref&gt;  All governance properties  are  open  to enrichment and  debate.

==How does  governance improve?==
The IUCN and  CBD have recently published a volume of Guidelines for assessing,  evaluating  and planning  for action with a view to improving governance for a system of protected  areas or a specific site.&lt;ref&gt;Borrini-Feyerabend, G.,  N. Dudley, T. Jaeger, B. Lassen, N. Pathak Broome, A. Phillips and  T. Sandwith,  Governance of Protected Areas: From understanding to action, Best Practice Protected Area Guidelines  Series No.  20,  IUCN, Gland  (Switzerland),  2013&lt;/ref&gt; In both cases,  the methodology  begins with an analysis of the historical, socio-cultural, institutional and  legal contexts. It then proceeds with a spatial analysis of governance vis-à-vis the status of conservation of nature.  This requires a large,  territorial view of the region or area  under consideration, including an assessment of biological,  ecological  and  cultural values and  their potential association  with governance diversity, quality and  vitality. From that, valuable  lessons can be derived and  action plans for improvement can be drawn.

Globally, there remains a need to initiate such systematic governance assessments and evaluations processes in a range of contexts, with the aim and expectation that they will catalyze enhanced  diversity, quality and vitality. A structured programme of governance  assessments, supported by learning and capacity development networks is a short and medium term priority to strengthen both conservation policies and results.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8730">A '''hierarchical organization''' is an [[organizational structure]] where every entity in the [[organization]], except one, is [[subordinate]] to a single other entity. This arrangement is a form of a [[hierarchy]]. In an organization, the hierarchy usually consists of a singular/group of [[Power (social and political)|power]] at the top with subsequent levels of power beneath them. This is the dominant mode of organization among large organizations; most [[corporation]]s, [[Forms of government|governments]], and [[organized religion]]s are hierarchical organizations with different levels of [[management]], power or [[authority]]. For example, the broad, top-level overview of the general organization of the [[Catholic Church hierarchy|Catholic Church]] consists of the [[Pope]], then the [[Cardinal (Catholic)|Cardinals]], then the [[Archbishop]]s, and so on. 

Members of hierarchical organizational structures chiefly communicate with their immediate superior and with their immediate subordinates. Structuring organizations in this way is useful partly because it can reduce the communication overhead by limiting information flow; this is also its major limitation.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}

==Visualization==
A hierarchy is typically visualized as a [[pyramid (geometry)|pyramid]], where the height of the ranking or person depicts their power status and the width of that level represents how many people or business divisions are at that level relative to the whole—the highest-ranking people are at the [[Apex (geometry)|apex]], and there are very few of them; the [[Base (geometry)|base]] may include thousands of people who have no subordinates. These hierarchies are typically depicted with a [[tree structure|tree]] or [[triangle]] [[diagram]], creating an [[organizational chart]] or organigram. Those nearest the top have more power than those nearest the bottom, and there being fewer people at the top than at the bottom. As a result, superiors in a hierarchy generally have higher status and command greater rewards than their subordinates.

==Common models==
All governments and most companies have similar structures. Traditionally, the [[monarch]] was the pinnacle of the [[State (polity)|state]]. In many countries, [[feudalism]] and [[manorialism]] provided a formal [[social structure]] that established hierarchical links at every level of society, with the monarch at the top. 

In modern post-feudal states the nominal top of the hierarchy still remains the [[head of state]], which may be a [[president]] or a [[constitutional monarch]], although in many modern states the powers of the head of state are delegated among different bodies. Below the head, there is commonly a [[senate]], [[parliament]] or [[congress]], which in turn often delegate the day-to-day running of the country to a [[prime minister]]. In many [[democracies]], the people are considered to be the notional top of the hierarchy, over the head of state; in reality, the people's power is restricted to voting in elections.

In business, the business owner traditionally occupied the pinnacle of the [[organization]]. In most modern large companies, there is now no longer a single dominant shareholder, and the collective power of the business owners is for most purposes delegated to a [[board of directors]], which in turn delegates the day-to-day running of the company to a [[managing director]] or [[CEO]]. Again, although the shareholders of the company are the nominal top of the hierarchy, in reality many companies are run at least in part as personal fiefdoms by their management; [[corporate governance]] rules are an attempt to mitigate this tendency.

== Studies ==
The [[organizational development]] theorist [[Elliott Jacques]] identified a special role for hierarchy in his concept of [[requisite organization]]. 
 
The [[iron law of oligarchy]], introduced by [[Robert Michels]], describes the inevitable tendency of hierarchical organizations to become [[oligarchy|oligarchic]] in their decision making.

The [[Peter principle|Peter Principle]] is a term coined by [[Laurence J. Peter]] in which the selection of a candidate for a position in an  hierarchical organization is based on the candidate's performance in their current role, rather than on abilities relevant to the intended role. Thus, employees only stop being promoted once they can no longer perform effectively, and managers in an hierarchical organization "rise to the level of their incompetence." 

[[Hierarchiology]] is another term coined by Laurence J. Peter, described in his humorous book of the same name, to refer to the study of hierarchical organizations and the behavior of their members.

{{quote|Having formulated the Principle, I discovered that I had inadvertently founded a new science, hierarchiology, the study of hierarchies. The term hierarchy was originally used to describe the system of church government by priests graded into ranks. The contemporary meaning includes any organization whose members or employees are arranged in order of rank, grade or class. Hierarchiology, although a relatively recent discipline, appears to have great applicability to the fields of public and private administration.|Dr. [[Laurence J. Peter]] and [[Raymond Hull]]|''[[The Peter Principle]]: Why Things Always Go Wrong''}}

[[The IRG Solution – hierarchical incompetence and how to overcome it]] argued that hierarchies were inherently incompetent, and were only able to function due to large amounts of informal [[lateral communication]] fostered by private informal networks.

==Criticism and alternatives==
In the work of diverse theorists such as [[William James]] (1842–1910), [[Michel Foucault]] (1926–1984) and [[Hayden White]], important critiques of hierarchical epistemology are advanced. James famously asserts in his work "Radical Empiricism" that clear distinctions of type and category are a constant but unwritten goal of scientific reasoning, so that when they are discovered, success is declared. But if aspects of the world are organized differently, involving inherent and intractable ambiguities, then scientific questions are often considered unresolved. A hesitation to declare success upon the discovery of ambiguities leaves heterarchy at an artificial and subjective disadvantage in the scope of human knowledge. This bias is an artifact of an aesthetic or pedagogical preference for hierarchy, and not necessarily an expression of objective observation.

Hierarchies and hierarchical thinking has been criticized by many people, including [[Susan McClary]] and one political philosophy which is vehemently opposed to hierarchical organization: [[anarchism]]. [[Heterarchy]] is the most commonly proposed alternative to hierarchy and this has been combined with [[responsible autonomy]] by [[Gerard Fairtlough]] in his work on [[Triarchy]] theory. The most beneficial aspect of a hierarchical organization is the clear command that is established. However, hierarchy may become dismantled by abuse of power.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

Amidst constant innovation in information and communication technologies, hierarchical authority structures are giving way to greater decision-making latitude for individuals and more flexible definitions of job activities and this new style of work presents a challenge to existing organizational forms, with some research studies contrasting traditional organizational forms against groups that operate as online communities that are characterized by personal motivation and the satisfaction of making one's own decisions.&lt;ref&gt;Zhao, Rosson, Rosson (2007). The Future of Work: What Does Online Community Have to Do with It? 40th Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences (HICSS'07)&lt;/ref&gt;  With all levels of an organization having access to information and communication via digital means, power structures align more as a [[wirearchy]], enabling the flow of power and authority to be based not on hierarchical levels, but on information, trust, credibility, and a focus on results.

A town's symbol, the hill is known for the remains of the large, fortified [[Bronze Age]] settlement and has been declared a nature park. The evidence confirm the almost continuous habitation from the [[Neolithic]] to the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] period,&lt;ref name=hisar&gt;{{ cite news | author = Rada Tamindžić | title = Blago u nedrima Hisara | trans-title = Treasure in the bosom of Hisar | newspaper = Politika | language = Serbian | date = 4 July 2009 | url = http://www.politika.rs/sr/clanak/93820/Blago-u-nedrima-Hisara }}&lt;/ref&gt; and as the town of Leskovac engulfs the hill, until today.

With numerous remains of the equipment for iron processing (grinders, furnaces, charcoal piles), iron ore itself and high quantities of discovered [[slag]], dated from the 14th to the 11th century, indicates that this was the oldest known occurrence of [[ferrous metallurgy]] in Europe and one of the oldest in the world. A nicely preserved needle, discovered on the site in 2001, is considered to be one of the oldest surviving metallic objects on the planet.&lt;ref name=hisar/&gt;

== Location ==
[[File:HisarSeverLeskovac.JPG|right|thumb|250px|Northern side of the hill]]

The hill is located within the urban area of Leskovac, in the valley of the [[Veternica]] river, which passes east of the hill. Almost from all sides it is surrounded by the town's urban tissue, with only southwest and, partially, south side remaining unurbanized. On the north, there is a Park "Devet Jugovića".

== Characteristics ==

The hill makes the westernmost extension of the [[Goljak]] mountain, sloping into the Morava valley.

Name of the hill comes from the Turkish word ''hisar'', which means [[citadel]]. Smaller forts were called ''hisardžik'' and fortresses above several cities in southern Serbia were in time named ''hisar'' (Leskovac, [[Prokuplje]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url = https://fedorani.ni.ac.rs/fedora/get/o:1108/bdef:Content/download | author = Nikola Brkić | title = Докторска дисертација - Насеља и становништво Топлице и Дубочице од XIV до XVI века | trans-title = PhD dissertation - Settlements and population of Toplica and Dubočica from 14th to 17th century | place = [[Niš]] | date = 2013 | publisher = University of Niš - Philosophy Faculty | language = Serbian }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Archaeology ==

The archaeological works began in 1999, they have been continuous ever since and until today covered an area of {{convert|130|ha|abbr=on}}. Head of the excavations is archaeologist Milorad Stojić from the Archaeological Institute in Belgrade.&lt;ref name=hisar/&gt; Remains of the multilayered settlement were discovered in 2001.

=== Older periods ===

There are remains from the [[Neolithic]] and [[Copper Age]].&lt;ref name=hisar/&gt; Over 7,000 artifacts from the prehistoric period were discovered.&lt;ref name=novosti/&gt;

=== Bronze Age ===

Hisar is a multilevel settlement which spawned through several periods, at least from 1350 and 1000 BC, during the [[Late Bronze Age]]. It was a large fortified settlement, located on the highest plateau of the hill. It was protected with the defensive, deep moat and surrounded by the wooden piles palisade on the inner side. The fortification extended into the slopes, where the suburbs on the foothills of Hisar were located.&lt;ref name=Politika&gt;{{Citation | author = Milan Momčilović, Smilja Jović | title = Kuće od pruća i blata, na trpezi kaša od prosa | newspaper = [[Politika]]-Magazin No. 1041 | pages = 26–27 | language = Serbian | date = 10 September 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The fortification is similar to the one discovered on the Gradac locality in [[Novo Lanište]], in the [[Velika Morava]] basin, though Gradac is much younger, originating in the 8th century BC. The settlement belonged to the [[Brnjica culture]].&lt;ref name=dosije1&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.doiserbia.nb.rs/(A(mmFEhxIFygEkAAAAODg1OWJkNTgtYTc2My00YjAxLTk4NDgtZWM3M2Q1ZTFkN2M4y46ilRSELxiqjbk0WwG_owYPOtI1))/img/doi/0350-0241/2006/0350-02410656073S.pdf | author = Milorad Stojić  | title = Regional characteristics of the Brnjica cultural group | date = 2006 | publisher = Institute of Archaeology, Belgrade - ''Starinar'' No. LVI }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The settlement occupies the southeast part of the hill. The Brnjica layers are discovered at the depth of {{convert|1.2|m|abbr=on}}, and consist of 4 strata which mark the 4 development phases (Brnjica I-a, I-b, II-a, II-b). Several thousand of objects were discovered, mostly pottery fragments.&lt;ref name=dosije1/&gt;

People lived in a small houses or in the half-[[Dugout (shelter)|dugouts]]. Houses were mostly made of wood, so they are not preserved, and the reconstruction was based on the imprints of the wooden piles, remains of the ''lep'', a wall plaster made of mud which contains remains of the [[Palisade|paling]] and woven wattles and remaining parts of the floors made of compacted earth. Underground sections of the half-dugouts had a rectangular base with the floor made of the compacted earth. Section above the ground was made of wattle covered with mud with the tent-like [[hipped roof]] covered with the straw or the wood [[Bark (botany)|bark]].&lt;ref name=Politika/&gt;

A furnace was located at the entrance into the house and the discovered pottery includes pots, bowls, cups, etc. House utensils included leverages, weights, flint tools and both parts of [[millstones]]: bedstones and runner tones. Even some three-legged wooden stools have been preserved. Next to the furnace there was a ''piranos'', the pot with the [[Firebox (architecture)|firebox]] and an outer handle, so the food was obviously prepared in the entry section of the house. Several food storages were discovered. Results of the archaeo-botanical researches showed that, concerning grains, the inhabitants cultivated mostly [[millet]], but also [[barley]], [[rye]], [[oats]] and some type of today extinct wild wheat. They also cultivated many [[legumes]]: [[peas]], [[lentils]], [[fava beans]], bitter [[vetch]] and today in Serbia extinct [[ervil]] (''urov''). A diet consisted of barley, millet and, to the lesser extent, wheat. The [[chaff]] was separated from the grain seeds by heating the seeds in the ''piranos'' until they become brittle so that they would separate easily in the [[mortar and pestle]]. The grains ware grinded by hand with the millstones. Due to the predominance of the millet, it is concluded that the most important and everyday meal was a millet porridge. They also made some kind of ''[[pogača]]'' of wheat and rye, while the legumes were cooked like today. The food was prepared and served in the clay dishes and the numerous complete objects were discovered: pots, jugs, pitchers, cups, etc. Large use of legumes is due to the climate as the Leskovac region is even today known for the production of this type of vegetables.&lt;ref name=Politika/&gt;

The inhabitants also grew the [[Camelina sativa|wild flax]] (''lanak''). The stems were used to make fabric, for which the hand operated looms were used. The seeds were used for the oil production.&lt;ref name=Politika/&gt;

In September 2017, experts from the National Museum in Leskovac reconstructed one Bronze Age house and exhibited it in front of the museum. They also placed a stand where, among other things, visitors can try the meals, which are made in the way it is believed they have been prepared, like the millet porridge. Today, Leskovac is the most famous place in Serbia for the grilled meat and especially, for ''[[pljeskavica]]s'', or hamburgers. To add a humorous note, the ''pljeskavicas'' are also prepared, but instead of meat, they are made from peas and millet, with added soybeans.&lt;ref name=Politika/&gt;

==== Metallurgy ====
[[File:Nova stalna postavka Narodnog muzeja u Leskovcu - Vremeplov leskovačkog kraja 08.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Holy Epiphany water vessel, 15th century]]

It is estimated that the metallurgy center in the settlement was operational at least between 1350 BC and 1100 BC and the remains have been found in the layer up to{{convert|2|m|abbr=on}} thick. Iron ore, amorphous iron and vast amount of slag were discovered, but also remains of the grinding stones for crushing the ore (''[[pogača]]''), furnaces, [[charcoal pile]]s, blowers and metal objects.&lt;ref name=hisar/&gt;

Archaeo-metallurgy expert Radomir Pleiner pointed out that the Hittite ferrous metallurgy, until recently considered the oldest on the planet, is known exclusively from the archive in the remains of their capital [[Hattusa]], near [[Boğazkale]] in [[Turkey]] and not from the discovered objects or the smelting equipment. Archives mention iron and gifts made from it, calling it a "royal metal" because only the royal court had rights to produce it. Further importance of iron in that, and later periods, can be seen from [[Homer]]'s labeling of iron as a "metal, more expensive than gold", because it was harder to find it and process it.&lt;ref name=hisar/&gt;

==== Turović needle ====

A nicely preserved needle, discovered on the site in 2002, is considered to be one of the oldest surviving metallic objects on the planet.&lt;ref name=b92&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.b92.net/info/vesti/index.php?yyyy=2005&amp;mm=07&amp;dd=26&amp;nav_id=173384 | title = Praistorijska kopča | date = 26 July 2005 | publisher = [[B92]] | language = Serbian }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Amateur archaeologist Šćepan Turović discovered it, so it was named after him, the Turović needle.&lt;ref name=hisar/&gt;

It was made from the stainless iron, without any hollows. It is {{convert|64.5|cm|abbr=on}} long and dated to the 14th century BC (c.1300 BC). It considered a technological wonder even by modern standards as iron of such purity hardly can be produced even today.&lt;ref name=hisar/&gt; It is 98,86% pure iron and apparently can't rust. Research labs in [[Sartid]] steel factory in [[Smederevo]] and the [[Vinča Nuclear Institute]] and Institute for physics in [[Belgrade]] showed that the needle was not made of pure iron which makes it "globally exquisite". Technologists stated that for such compactness and purity, it will take millions and millions of strokes. It has greater purity than the iron standard forged in space, which was brought from the United States to compare it to the needle.&lt;ref name=novosti&gt;{{ cite web | url = http://www.novosti.rs/vesti/naslovna/reportaze/aktuelno.293.html:671045-Misteriju-igle-sa-Hisara-ne-znaju-ni-Amerikanci | author = Dragan Vujičić | title = Misteriju igle sa Hisara ne znaju ni Amerikanci | trans-title = Mystery of the Hisar needle can't be solved even by Americans | date = 18 June 2017 | publisher = [[Večernje Novosti]] | language = Serbian }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, another needle-shaped object was discovered, also dated to the 14th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url = http://www.srbija.gov.rs/vesti/vest.php?id=35407 | title = На Хисару пронађена још једна гвоздена игла из 14. века пре нове ере | trans-title = Another iron needle from the 14th century BC discovered on Hisar | date = 15 September 2005 | publisher = Government of the Republic of Serbia | language = Serbian }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Dorian hypothesis ====

Stojić hypothesizes that the development of metallurgy confirms the theory of the [[Dorian Invasion]] from the northern route. The discovery of iron and bronze objects from the 12th century BC, coincides with the invasion. The Dorians lived in the basin of the [[South Morava]] and the surrounding Central Balkans regions in the 13th century and, producing the iron weapons, with ease conquered the southern people in [[Greece]].&lt;ref name=hisar/&gt;

=== Iron Age ===

A later [[Iron Age]] settlement existed at Hisar from the 6th to the 4th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.doiserbia.nb.rs/img/doi/0350-0241/2007/0350-02410757175S.pdf | author = Milorad Stojić | title = Hisar in Leskovac at the end of the early Iron Age | date = 2007 | publisher = Institute of Archaeology, Belgrade - ''Starinar'' No. LVII }}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides Greek [[Fibula (brooch)|fibulae]] and pottery, in 2005 a rare example of the silver [[buckle]] was discovered which, with other discovered artifacts, points to the existence of the [[necropolis]] of the old Balkan people, either the [[Thracian]] [[Triballi]] or the [[Thraco-Illyrian]] [[Dardani]].&lt;ref name=b92/&gt;

=== Later periods ===

The fortress was active during the later Roman, Byzantine, medieval Serbian and Ottoman periods.&lt;ref name=hisar/&gt;

The Roman remains include the parts of a [[rampart (fortification)|rampart]],&lt;ref name=hisar/&gt; which was dug into the remains of the old, 14th century BC fortification. The object is decorated with [[fresco]]es and a mosaic and probably was port of a sacral complex.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url = http://www.juznasrbija.info/?view=cir&amp;action=news&amp;id=tajne-brda-hisar-nedaleko-od-centra-leskovca&amp;category=drustvo | author = Dušan Kocić | title = Тајне брда Хисар, недалеко од центра Лесковца | trans-title = Secrets of the Hisar hill, close to downtown Leskovac | date = 10 March 2013 | publisher = Južna Srbija Info | language = Serbian }}&lt;/ref&gt; An ebony tablet, with the visible inscription ''reddeta'' ("return gift"), is also discovered. It is dated to the 4th century.&lt;ref name=hisar/&gt;

During the Byzantine period, the hill hosted a crafts and metallurgy center.&lt;ref name=hisar/&gt;

The "most beautiful 12th century archaeological findings in Serbia" have also been discovered. It most probably originated from the period of [[Grand Župan]] [[Stefan Nemanja]], who included the [[Dubočica]] region and the basin of the South Morava in the Serbian state. Artifacts include the complete dishes and vessels and medieval colored glass ornamented in the multi-color technique. Remains of the settlement from c.1400 are also found, and silver coins minted by [[Stefan Lazarević]], before he obtained his title of a [[Despot (court title)|despot]].&lt;ref name=hisar/&gt;

'''''I, Lucifer''''' is the third studio album by British band [[The Real Tuesday Weld]] and was released in 2003. It was intended as a companion soundtrack to the novel ''[[I, Lucifer (Glen Duncan)|I, Lucifer]]'' by [[Glen Duncan]]. "[[Bathtime In Clerkenwell]]" is the song used by [[Alex Budovsky]] in the short animation ''"Bathtime in Clerkenwell"''.  At least four different versions of the album exist - the first incarnation on Dreamy Records, the second on PIAS recordings in Europe and the third on Six Degrees in the US. A picture-disc vinyl release accompanied the 2004 PIAS re-release of the album. Each version of the album features different sequencing and different mixes of the tracks "Bathtime in Clerkenwell" and "The Ugly &amp; The Beautiful".  Additionally, the entire album was newly remixed for its U.S. release in 2004. It was awarded album of the week in the UK Times and Telegraph and has generally been critically lauded.

'''Interactive art''' is a form of [[art]] that involves the spectator in a way that allows the art to achieve its purpose. Some interactive art installations achieve this by letting the observer or visitor "walk" in, on, and around them; some others ask the artist or the spectators to become part of the artwork.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Soler-Adillon|first=Joan|date=2015-12-21|title=The intangible material of interactive art: agency, behavior and emergence|url=http://journals.uoc.edu/index.php/artnodes/article/view/n16-soler|journal=Artnodes|language=en|volume=0|issue=16|doi=10.7238/a.v0i16.2744|issn=1695-5951}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Works of this kind of art frequently feature [[computer]]s, interfaces and sometimes sensors to respond to motion, heat, meteorological changes or other types of input their makers programmed them to respond to. Most examples of virtual [[Internet art]] and [[electronic art]] are highly interactive. Sometimes, visitors are able to navigate through a [[hypertext]] environment; some works accept textual or visual input from outside; sometimes an audience can influence the course of a [[performance art|performance]] or can even participate in it. Some other interactive artworks are considered as immersive as the quality of interaction involve all the spectrum of surrounding stimuli. Virtual reality environments like works by [[Maurice Benayoun]] and [[Jeffrey Shaw]] are highly interactive as the work the spectators – Maurice Benayoun call them "visitors", Miroslaw Rogala calls them (v)users,  [[Char Davies]] "immersants" –  interact with take all their fields of perception.

Though some of the earliest examples of interactive art have been dated back to the 1920s, most digital art didn’t make its official entry into the world of art until the late 1990s.&lt;ref name="Paul, C page 67"&gt;Paul, C: ''Digital Art'', page 67. Thames &amp; Hudson Inc, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;  Since this debut, countless museums and venues have been increasingly accommodating digital and interactive art into their productions.  This budding genre of art is continuing to grow and evolve in a somewhat rapid manner through internet social sub-culture, as well as through large scale urban installations.

== Interactivity in art ==
[[File:Boundaryfunctions 1.jpg|thumb|right|250 px|alt=Boundary Functions at the Tokyo Intercommunications Center, 1999.|''Boundary Functions'' (1998) interactive floor projection by [[Scott Snibbe]] at the [[NTT InterCommunication Center]] in Tokyo.&lt;ref&gt;[http://snibbe.com/projects/interactive/boundaryfunctions "Boundary Functions"]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Interactive art is a genre of art in which the viewers participate in some way by providing an input in order to determine the outcome.  Unlike traditional art forms wherein the interaction of the spectator is merely a mental event, interactivity allows for various types of navigation, assembly, and/or contribution to an artwork, which goes far beyond purely psychological activity.&lt;ref name="Paul, C page 67"/&gt;  Interactivity as a medium produces meaning.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Muller, L, Edmonds, E, Connel, M: "Living laboratories for interactive art", ''CoDesign'', 2(4):3&lt;/ref&gt;

Interactive art installations are generally computer-based and frequently rely on sensors, which gauge things such as temperature, motion, proximity, and other meteorological phenomena that the maker has programmed in order to elicit responses based on participant action.  In interactive artworks, both the audience and the machine work together in dialogue in order to produce a completely unique artwork for each audience to observe. However, not all observers visualize the same picture. Because it is interactive art, each observer makes their own interpretation of the artwork and it may be completely different than another observer's views.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Interactive art can be distinguished from [[Generative art]] in that it constitutes a dialogue between the artwork and the participant; specifically, the participant has agency, or the ability, even in an unintentional manner, to act upon the artwork and is furthermore invited to do so within the context of the piece, i.e. the work affords the interaction. More often, we can consider that the work takes its visitor into account. In an increasing number of cases an installation can be defined as a [[responsive environment]], especially those created by architects and designers. By contrast, Generative Art, which may be interactive, but not responsive per se, tends to be a monologue – the artwork may change or evolve in the presence of the viewer, but the viewer may not be invited to engage in the reaction but merely enjoy it.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==History==
According to the new media artist and theorist {{Citation needed|date=March 2015}} [[Maurice Benayoun]], the first piece of interactive art should be the work done by [[Parrhasius (painter)|Parrhasius]] during his art contest with [[Zeuxis]] described by [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]], in the fifth century B.C. when Zeuxis tried to unveil the painted curtain. The work takes its meaning from Zeuxis' gesture and wouldn’t exist without it. Zeuxis, by its gesture, became part of Parrhasius' work. This shows that the specificity of interactive art resides often less in the use of computers than in the quality of proposed "situations" and the "Other's" involvement in the process of [[sensemaking]]. Nevertheless, computers and real time computing made the task easier and opened the field of virtuality – the potential emergence of unexpected (although possibly pre-written) futures – to contemporary arts.

Some of the earliest examples of interactive art were created as early as the 1920s.  An example is [[Marcel Duchamp]]’s piece named ''Rotary Glass Plates''.  The artwork required the viewer to turn on the machine and stand at a distance of one meter in order to see an optical illusion.&lt;ref&gt;Paul, C: ''Digital Art'', page 11. Thames &amp; Hudson Inc, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

The present idea of interactive art began to flourish more in the 1960s for partly political reasons.  At the time, many people found it inappropriate for artists to carry the only creative power within their works.  Those artists who held this view wanted to give the audience their own part of this creative process.  An early example is found in the early 1960s "change-paintings" of [[Roy Ascott]], about whom [[Frank Popper]] has written: "Ascott was among the first artists to launch an appeal for total spectator participation".&lt;ref&gt;Popper, Frank (2007). From Technological to Virtual Art. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press. p. 77. {{ISBN|978-0-262-16230-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Aside from the “political” view, it was also current wisdom that interaction and engagement had a positive part to play within the creative process.&lt;ref&gt;Edmonds, E, Muller, L, Connel, M: "On creative engagement", ''Visual Communication'', 5(307):3&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s artists began to use new technology such as video and satellites to experiment with live performances and interactions through the direct broadcast of video and audio.&lt;ref&gt;Paul, C: ''Digital Art'', page 18. Thames &amp; Hudson Inc, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

Interactive art became a large phenomenon due to the advent of computer based interactivity in the 1990s. Along with this came a new kind of art-experience.  Audience and machine were now able to more easily work together in dialogue in order to produce a unique artwork for each audience.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;  In the late 1990s, museums and galleries began increasingly incorporating the art form in their shows, some even dedicating entire exhibitions to it.&lt;ref&gt;Paul, C: ''Digital Art'', page 23. Thames &amp; Hudson Inc, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;  This continues today and is only expanding due to increased communications through digital media.

A hybrid emerging discipline drawing on the combined interests of specific artists and architects has been created in the last 10–15 years. Disciplinary boundaries have blurred, and significant number of architects and interactive designers have joined electronic artists in the creation of new, custom-designed interfaces and evolutions in techniques for obtaining user input (such as dog vision, alternative sensors, voice analysis, etc.); forms and tools for information display (such as video projection, lasers, robotic and mechatronic actuators, led lighting etc.); modes for human-human and human-machine communication (through the Internet and other telecommunications networks); and to the development of social contexts for interactive systems (such as utilitarian tools, formal experiments, games and entertainment, social critique, and political liberation).

== Forms ==
There are many different forms of interactive art.  Such forms range from interactive dance, music, and even drama.&lt;ref&gt;Dannenberg, R, Bates, J: "[https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rbd/papers/interactiveart.pdf A model for interactive art]", ''Proceedings of the Fifth Biennial Symposium for Arts and Technology'', 51(78):2&lt;/ref&gt;  New technology, primarily computer systems and computer technology, have enabled a new class of interactive art.&lt;ref&gt;Dannenberg, R, Bates, J: "A model for interactive art", ''Proceedings of the Fifth Biennial Symposium for Arts and Technology'', 51(78):1&lt;/ref&gt;  Examples of such interactive art are [[installation art]], [[interactive architecture]], [[interactive film]], and [[interactive storytelling]].

== Impact ==
The aesthetic impact of interactive art is more profound than expected.

Supporters of more “traditional” contemporary art saw, in the use of computers, a way to balance artistic deficiencies, some other consider that the art is not anymore in the achievement of the formal shape of the work but in the design of the rules that determine the evolution of the shape according to the quality of the dialogue.

== Events and places ==
There are number of globally significant festivals and exhibitions of interactive and media arts. [[Prix Ars Electronica]] is a major yearly competition and exhibition that gives awards to outstanding examples of (technology-driven) interactive art.  [[SIGGRAPH|Association of Computing Machinery's Special Interest Group in Graphics (SIGGRAPH)]], DEAF Dutch Electronic Arts Festival, Transmediale Germany, [[Electronic Language International Festival|FILE - Electronic Language International Festival]] Brazil, and AV Festival England, are among the others.

CAiiA, Centre for Advanced Inquiry in the Interactive Arts, first established by [[Roy Ascott]] in 1994 at the [[University of Wales, Newport]], and later in 2003 as the [[Planetary Collegium]], was the first doctoral and post doc research center to be established specifically for research in the interactive art field.

[[Interactive architecture]] has now been installed on and as part of building facades, in foyers, museums and large scale public spaces, including airports, in a number of global cities. A number of  leading museums, for example, the [[National Gallery (London)|National Gallery]], [[Tate]], [[Victoria &amp; Albert Museum]] and [[Science Museum (London)|Science Museum]] in [[London]] (to cite the leading UK museums active in this field) were early adoptors in the field of interactive technologies, investing in educational resources, and more latterly, in the creative use of MP3 players for visitors. In 2004 the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum commissioned curator and author Lucy Bullivant to write Responsive Environments (2006), the first such publication of its kind. Interactive designers are frequently commissioned for museum displays; a number specialize in wearable computing.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2116">'''Kenneth Crosby''' (1904–1998) was a British [[Wesleyanism|Wesleyan]] missionary, a Bible translator and language scholar, who worked in [[Sierra Leone]].  He is best known for his work in the [[Mende language]].

Crosby was born on 12 May 1904 at [[Briton Ferry]], near [[Neath]] in South Wales. He graduated with a BD degree from the [[University of London]] in 1927, then a BA in philosophy from the same university.  He left for Sierra Leone in 1929, though returned to Britain temporarily in 31, where he was ordained and also married to his fiancee Dorothy.

In Sierra Leone, his service included being a part of a team that translating the Bible into Mende, helping to found the Bunumbu Press, and serving as the first principal of Bunumbu Union College (now [[Bunumbu Teachers College]]).

In 1939, he was awarded a PhD degree from the University of London for his dissertation ''A study of the Mende Language''. He wrote of the Mende language, "I was brought up on the classics and had been taught that classical Greek was the most perfect instrument of speech ever devised.  I accepted this, of course, unthinkingly and believfed it implicitly until I met the Mende language.  But then I began to think differently.  I marvelled at its incredible beauty, its wonderful cadences, its skillful nuances and the deeper I went the more I learned to wonder" (Tuchscherer 1998:220).

'''''Laissez-faire''''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|l|ɛ|s|eɪ|ˈ|f|ɛər}}; {{IPA-fr|lɛsefɛʁ|lang|Fr-Laissez-faire.oga}}; from {{Lang-fr|laissez faire|lit=let do}}) is an [[economic system]] in which transactions between private parties are free from [[government]] intervention such as [[regulation]], [[Privilege (legal ethics)|privileges]], [[tariff]]s and [[Subsidy|subsidies]]. The phrase ''laissez-faire'' is part of a larger [[French language|French]] phrase and translates to "let (it/them) do", but in this context usually means "let go".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/laissez-faire.html Laissez-faire], Business Dict&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology and usage ==
The term ''laissez faire'' likely originated in a meeting that took place around 1681 between powerful French [[List of Finance Ministers of France|Controller-General of Finances]] [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert]] and a group of French [[businessmen]] headed by M. Le Gendre. When the eager [[Mercantilism|mercantilist]] minister asked how the French state could be of service to the merchants and help promote their commerce, Le Gendre replied simply "''laissez-nous faire''" ("leave it to us" or "let us do [it]", the French verb not having to take an object).&lt;ref&gt;[http://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=File%3AJournal_oeconomique_-_janvier_1751.djvu Journal Oeconomique] 1751, Article by the French minister of finance.&lt;/ref&gt;

The anecdote on the Colbert–Le Gendre meeting appeared in a 1751 article in the ''Journal économique'', written by French minister and champion of [[free trade]] [[René Louis de Voyer de Paulmy d'Argenson|René de Voyer, Marquis d'Argenson]]—also the first known appearance of the term in print.&lt;ref&gt;M. d'Argenson, "Lettre au sujet de la dissertation sur le commerce du marquis de Belloni', Avril 1751, ''Journal Oeconomique'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=k4ABAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=RA3-PA111#v=onepage p. 111]. See A. Oncken, ''Die Maxime Laissez faire et laissez passer, ihr Ursprung, ihr Werden'', 1866&lt;/ref&gt; Argenson himself had used the phrase earlier (1736) in his own diaries in a famous outburst: {{quote|''Laissez faire, telle devrait être la devise de toute puissance publique, depuis que le monde est civilisé&amp;nbsp;... Détestable principe que celui de ne vouloir grandir que par l'abaissement de nos voisins&amp;nbsp;! Il n'y a que la méchanceté et la malignité du cœur de satisfaites dans ce principe, et l’intérêt y est opposé. Laissez faire, morbleu&amp;nbsp;! Laissez faire !!''&lt;ref&gt;as quoted in J. M. Keynes, 1926, "The End of Laissez Faire". Argenson's ''Mémoirs'' were published only in 1858, ed. Jannet, Tome V, p. 362. See A. Oncken (''Die Maxime Laissez faire et laissez passer, ihr Ursprung, ihr Werden'', 1866)&lt;/ref&gt;

"Let go, which should be the motto of all public power, since the world was civilized ... (It is) a detestable principle of those that want to enlarge (themselves) but by the abasement of our neighbours. There is but the wicked and the malignant heart(s) (who are) satisfied by this principle and (its) interest is opposed. Let go, alas".&lt;ref&gt;Original somewhat literal translation using https://fr.wiktionary.org/wiki/laissez-faire#fr&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=René Louis de Voyer de Paulmy d'Argenson|source=}}

[[Vincent de Gournay]], a French [[Physiocracy|Physiocrat]] and intendant of commerce in the 1750s, popularized the term ''laissez faire'' as he allegedly adopted it from [[François Quesnay]]'s writings on China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Baghdiantz McCabe|first= Ina|title= Orientalism in Early Modern France: Eurasian Trade Exoticism and the Ancien Regime|year= 2008|publisher= Berg Publishers|isbn= 978-1-84520-374-0|pages= 271–72}}&lt;/ref&gt; Quesnay coined the phrases ''laissez-faire'' and ''laissez-passer,''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Encyclopædia Britannica|url= http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/487095/Francois-Quesnay|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''laissez-faire'' being a translation of the Chinese term 無為 [[wu wei]].&lt;ref name=Clarke&gt;{{cite book|last= Clarke|first= J.J.|title= Oriental Enlightenment: The Encounter Between Asian and Western Thought|year= 1997|publisher= Routledge|isbn= 978-0415133760|page= 50}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gournay ardently supported the removal of restrictions on trade and the deregulation of industry in France. Delighted with the Colbert-Le Gendre anecdote,&lt;ref&gt;According to J. [[Anne-Robert-Jacques Turgot, Baron de Laune|Turgot]]'s "Eloge de Vincent de Gournay," '' Mercure'', August, 1759 (repr. in ''Oeuvres of Turgot'', vol. 1 [https://books.google.com/books?id=5KQALAckPr8C&amp;pg=PA288#v=onepage p. 288].&lt;/ref&gt; he forged it into a larger maxim all his own: "''Laissez faire et laissez passer''" ("Let do and let pass"). His motto has also been identified as the longer "''Laissez faire et laissez passer, le monde va de lui même!''" ("Let do and let pass, the world goes on by itself!"). Although Gournay left no written tracts on his economic policy ideas, he had immense personal influence on his contemporaries, notably his fellow Physiocrats, who credit both the ''laissez-faire'' slogan and the doctrine to Gournay.&lt;ref&gt;Gournay was credited with the phrase by [[Jacques Turgot]] ("Eloge a Gournay", ''Mercure'' 1759), the [[Victor de Riqueti, marquis de Mirabeau|Marquis de Mirabeau]] (''Philosophie rurale'' 1763 and ''Ephémérides du Citoyen'', 1767.), the [[Comte d'Albon]] (,"Éloge Historique de M. Quesnay", ''Nouvelles Ephémérides Économiques'', May, 1775, pp. 136–37. ) and [[Pierre Samuel du Pont de Nemours|DuPont de Nemours]] (Introduction to ''Oeuvres de Jacques Turgot'', 1808–11, Vol. I, pp. 257, 259 (Daire ed.)) among others&lt;/ref&gt;

Before d'Argenson or Gournay, [[Pierre Le Pesant, sieur de Boisguilbert|P. S. de Boisguilbert]] had enunciated the phrase "''on laisse faire la nature''" ("let nature run its course").&lt;ref&gt;"Tant, encore une fois, qu'on laisse faire la nature, on ne doit rien craindre de pareil", P.S. de Boisguilbert, 1707, ''Dissertation de la nature des richesses, de l'argent et des tributs''.&lt;/ref&gt; D'Argenson himself during his life was better known for the similar, but less-celebrated motto "''Pas trop gouverner''" ("Govern not too much").&lt;ref&gt;DuPont de Nemours, ''op cit'', p. 258. Oncken (''op.cit'') and Keynes (''op.cit''.) also credit the Marquis d'Argenson with the phrase "''Pour gouverner mieux, il faudrait gouverner moins''" ("To govern best, one needs to govern less"), possibly the source of the famous "That government is best which governs least" motto popular in American circles, attributed variously to [[Thomas Paine]], [[Thomas Jefferson]] and [[Henry Thoreau]].&lt;/ref&gt; However, Gournay's use of the ''laissez-faire'' phrase (as popularized by the Physiocrats) gave it its cachet.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

The Physiocrats proclaimed ''laissez-faire'' in eighteenth-century France, placing it at the very core of their economic principles and famous economists, beginning with [[Adam Smith]], developed the idea.&lt;ref name="Fine, Sidney 1964"&gt;Fine, Sidney. ''Laissez Faire and the General-Welfare State''. United States: The University of Michigan Press, 1964. Print&lt;/ref&gt; "It is with the physiocrats and the classical political economy that the term "''laissez faire''" is ordinarily associated".&lt;ref&gt;Macgregor, ''Economic Thought and Policy'' (London, 1949), pp. 54–67&lt;/ref&gt; The book ''Laissez Faire and the General-Welfare State'' states: &lt;blockquote&gt;The physiocrats, reacting against the excessive mercantilist regulations of the France of their day, expressed a belief in a "natural order" or liberty under which individuals in following their selfish interests contributed to the general good. Since, in their view, this natural order functioned successfully without the aid of government, they advised the state to restrict itself to upholding the rights of private property and individual liberty, to removing all artificial barriers to trade, and to abolishing all useless laws.&lt;ref name="Fine, Sidney 1964"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In England, a number of "free trade" and "non-interference" slogans{{which|date=December 2016}} had been coined{{By whom|date=December 2016}} as early as the 17th century,{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} but the French phrase ''laissez-faire'' gained currency in English-speaking countries with the spread of Physiocratic literature in the late 18th century. [[George Whatley]]'s 1774 ''Principles of Trade'' (co-authored with [[Benjamin Franklin]]) re-told the Colbert-LeGendre anecdote—this may mark the first appearance of the phrase in an English-language publication.&lt;ref&gt;Whatley's ''Principles of Trade'' are reprinted in ''Works of Benjamin Franklin, Vol.2'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=C2QUAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA401#v=onepage p. 401]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Herbert Spencer]] was opposed to a slightly different application of ''laissez faire''—to "that miserable ''laissez-faire''" that leads to men’s ruin: &lt;blockquote&gt;Along with that miserable laissez-faire which calmly looks on while men ruin themselves in trying to enforce by law their equitable claims, there goes activity in supplying them, at other men's cost, with gratis novel-reading!&lt;ref&gt;''Justice Part IV of Ethics'' (1892). p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In Spencer's case, the right of private ownership was being assailed and it was that miserable spirit of ''laissez-faire'' in halls of legislation that exhausted men in the effort of protecting their right. So in effect, Spencer decried ''laissez-faire'' socialism.

''Laissez-faire'', a product of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], was "conceived as the way to unleash human potential through the restoration of a natural system, a system unhindered by the restrictions of government".&lt;ref name="Gaspard, Toufick 2004"&gt;Gaspard, Toufick. ''A Political Economy of Lebanon 1948–2002: The Limits of Laissez-faire''. Boston: Brill, 2004. {{ISBN|978-9004132597}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a similar vein, Adam Smith{{When|date=December 2016}} viewed the economy as a natural system and the market as an organic part of that system. Smith saw ''laissez-faire'' as a moral program and the market its instrument to ensure men the rights of [[natural law]].&lt;ref name="Gaspard, Toufick 2004"/&gt; By extension, [[free market]]s become a reflection of the natural system of liberty.&lt;ref name="Gaspard, Toufick 2004"/&gt; For Smith, ''laissez-faire'' was "a program for the abolition of laws constraining the market, a program for the restoration of order and for the activation of potential growth".&lt;ref name="Gaspard, Toufick 2004"/&gt;

However, Smith&lt;ref name=asoae /&gt; and the notable [[Classical economics|classical economists]], such as [[Thomas Malthus]] and [[David Ricardo]], did not use the phrase. [[Jeremy Bentham]] used the term, but it was probably{{original research inline|date=December 2016}} [[James Mill]]'s reference to the ''laissez-faire'' maxim (together with "''pas trop gouverner''") in an 1824 entry for the ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' that really brought the term into wider English usage. With the advent of the [[Anti-Corn Law League]] (founded 1838), the term received much of its English meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author= Abbott P. Usher|title= Economic History – The Decline of Laissez Faire|year= 1931|journal= American Economic Review|volume= 22|issue= 1, Supplement|pages= 3–10|display-authors= etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{qn|date=July 2017}}

Smith first used the metaphor of an "[[invisible hand]]" in his book ''[[The Theory of Moral Sentiments]]'' (1759) to describe the unintentional effects of economic self-organization from economic self-interest.&lt;ref&gt;Andres Marroquin, ''Invisible Hand: The Wealth of Adam Smith'', The Minerva Group, Inc., 2002, {{ISBN|1-4102-0288-7}}, p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt; The idea lying behind the "invisible hand", though not the metaphor itself, belongs to [[Bernard Mandeville|Bernard de Mandeville]] and his ''[[Fable of the Bees]]'' (1705). In [[political economy]], that idea and the doctrine of ''laissez-faire'' have long been{{By whom|date=December 2016}} closely related.&lt;ref&gt;John Eatwell, ''The Invisible Hand'', W.W. Norton&amp;Company, 1989, pp. Preface x1.&lt;/ref&gt; Some have characterized the invisible-hand metaphor as one for ''laissez-faire'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.google.com/books?id=zAIar8Ee80QC&amp;lpg=PA122&amp;pg=PA122#v=onepage&amp;q=laissez%20faire%20invisible%20hand |title= The mathematical century: the 30 greatest problems of the last 100 years (2006) Piergiorgio Odifreddi, Arturo Sangalli, Freeman J Dyson, p. 122 |publisher= Google.com |accessdate= 2013-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; though Smith never actually used the term himself.&lt;ref name=asoae&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Third Millennium Capitalism'' (2000), Wyatt M. Rogers, Jr. notes a trend whereby recently "conservative politicians and economists have chosen the term '[[free-market capitalism]]' in lieu of ''laissez-faire''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rogers|first1=Wyatt M.|chapter=1: Economic Forces in Modern Capitalism|title=Third Millennium Capitalism: Convergence of Economic, Energy, and Environmental Forces|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7adF9D3OJ0EC|series=ABC-Clio ebook|location=Westport, Connecticut|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|publication-date=2000|page=38|isbn=9781567203608|accessdate=2016-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fundamentals==
As a system of thought, ''laissez-faire'' rests on the following axioms:&lt;ref name="Gaspard, Toufick 2004"/&gt;
# The individual is the basic unit in society.
# The individual has a natural right to freedom.
# The physical order of nature is a harmonious and self-regulating system.
# Corporations are creatures of the State and therefore the citizenry must watch them closely due to their propensity to disrupt the Smithian [[spontaneous order]].&lt;ref&gt;Adam Smith, ''Wealth of Nations'', "The exclusive privileges of corporations, statutes of apprenticeship, and all those laws which restrain, in particular employments, the competition to a smaller number than might otherwise go into them, have the same tendency, though in a less degree. They are a sort of enlarged monopolies, and may frequently, for ages together, and in whole classes of employments, keep up the market price of particular commodities above the natural price, and maintain both the wages of the labour and the profits of the stock employed about them somewhat above their natural rate." p. 52, http://www.ibiblio.org/ml/libri/s/SmithA_WealthNations_p.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

These axioms constitute the basic elements of ''laissez-faire'' thought. Another basic principle holds that markets should be [[Competition (economics)|competitive]], a rule that the early advocates of ''laissez-faire'' always emphasized.&lt;ref name="Gaspard, Toufick 2004"/&gt; With the aims of maximizing freedom and of allowing markets to self-regulate, early advocates of ''laissez-faire'' proposed a ''impôt unique'', a [[land value tax|tax on land rent]] to replace all taxes that they saw as damaging welfare by penalizing [[production (economics)|production]].&lt;ref&gt;

==History of ''laissez-faire'' debate==

===Europe===
In Europe, the ''laissez-faire'' movement was first widely promoted by the [[Physiocracy|Physiocrats]], a movement that originated with [[Vincent de Gournay]], a successful merchant. Gournay adopted the concept, which is the translation of Chinese philosophy [[wu wei]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Christian Gerlach]], [http://hsozkult.geschichte.hu-berlin.de/daten/2005/gerlach_christian_wu-wei.pdf Wu-Wei in Europe. A Study of Eurasian Economic Thought], London School of Economics – March 2005 p. 3" the diffusion of wu-wei, co-evolved with the inner-European ''laissez-faire'' principle, the Libaniusian model." p. 8 "Thus, wu-wei has to be recognized as a ''laissez-faire'' instrument of Chinese political economy "p. 10 "Practising wu-wei erzhi. Consequently, it is this variant of the ''laissez-faire'' maxim in which the basis of Physiocracy's ‘moral philosophy’ is to be located. Priddat's work made clear that the wu-wei of the complete économie has to be considered central to Physiocracy; "p. 11 "that wu-wei translates into French as laissez-faire"&lt;/ref&gt; from [[François Quesnay]]'s writings on China.&lt;ref name=Clarke/&gt; Gournay held that the government should allow the [[natural law|laws of nature]] to govern economic activity, with the state only intervening to protect life, liberty and property. His ideas were taken up by [[François Quesnay]] and [[Anne Robert Jacques Turgot]], Baron de l'Aulne. Quesnay had the ear of the King of France, [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]] and in 1754 persuaded him to give ''laissez-faire'' a try. On September 17, the King abolished all tolls and restraints on the sale and transport of grain and for more than a decade the experiment was a success, but then in 1768 there was a poor harvest, and the cost of bread rose so high that there was widespread starvation while merchants exported grain in order to obtain the best profit. In 1770, the edict allowing [[free trade]] was revoked.&lt;ref&gt;Will &amp; Ariel Durant, ''Rousseau and the Revolution'', pp. 71–77, Simon and Schuster, 1967, {{ISBN|067163058X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The doctrine of ''laissez-faire'' became an integral part of [[Classical liberalism|nineteenth-century European liberalism]].&lt;ref name="Fine, Sidney 1964"/&gt; Just as liberals supported [[freedom of thought]] in the intellectual sphere, so were they equally prepared to champion the principles of [[free trade]] and [[free competition]] in the sphere of economics. The state was to be merely a [[Night-watchman state|passive policeman]], protecting [[private property]] and administering justice, but not interfering with the affairs of its citizens. Businessmen and particularly British industrialists were quick to associate these principles with their own economic interests.&lt;ref name="Fine, Sidney 1964"/&gt; Many of the ideas of the physiocrats spread throughout Europe and were adopted to a greater or lesser extent in [[Sweden]], [[Tuscany]], [[Spain]] and after 1776 in the newly created [[United States]]. [[Adam Smith]], author of ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'', met Quesnay and acknowledged his influence.&lt;ref&gt;Will &amp; Ariel Durant, ''Rousseau and the Revolution'', p. 76, Simon and Schuster, 1967, {{ISBN|067163058X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[United Kingdom|Britain]], the newspaper ''[[The Economist]]'' was founded in 1843 and became an influential voice for ''laissez-faire'' [[capitalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Scott Gordon|title=The London Economist and the High Tide of Laissez Faire|year=1955|journal=Journal of Political Economy|volume=63|issue=6|pages=461–88|doi=10.1086/257722}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Laissez-faire'' advocates opposed food aid for famines occurring within the [[British Empire]]. In 1847, referring to the famine then underway in [[Ireland]], founder of ''The Economist'' [[James Wilson (businessman)|James Wilson]] wrote: "It is no man's business to provide for another".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Cormac Ó Gráda]]|title=The Great Irish Famine|year=1995|chapter=section: ''Ideology and relief'' in Chpt. 2|isbn=9780521557870|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, ''The Economist'' campaigned against the [[Corn Laws]] that protected landlords in the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] against competition from less expensive foreign imports of cereal products. The [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Famine]] in Ireland in 1845 led to the repeal of the Corn Laws in 1846. The tariffs on grain which kept the price of bread artificially high were repealed.&lt;ref&gt;George Miller. ''On Fairness and Efficiency''. The Policy Press, 2000. {{ISBN|978-1-86134-221-8}} p. 344&lt;/ref&gt; However, repeal of the Corn Laws came too late to stop Irish famine, partly because it was done in stages over three years.&lt;ref&gt;Christine Kinealy. ''A Death-Dealing Famine:The Great Hunger in Ireland''. Pluto Press, 1997. {{ISBN|978-0-7453-1074-9}}. p. 59&lt;/ref&gt;

A group calling itself the [[Manchester capitalism|Manchester Liberals]], to which [[Richard Cobden]] and Richard Wright belonged, were staunch defenders of free trade and their work was carried on, after the death of Richard Cobden in 1866, by ''The Cobden Club''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=London Clubs in the Late Nineteenth Century |url=http://www.nuff.ox.ac.uk/economics/history/paper28/28taddeiweb1.pdf |format=PDF|author=Antonia Taddei|year=1999|accessdate=2008-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1860, a [[Cobden-Chevalier Treaty|trade treaty]] was signed between Britain and France, after which several of these treaties were signed among other European countries.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} The breakdown of the ''laissez-faire'' practised by the British Empire was partly led by British companies eager for state support of their positions abroad, in particular British oil companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last= Jones |first= G. Gareth |year= 1977 |title= The British Government and the Oil Companies 1912–1924: The Search for an Oil Policy |journal= [[The Historical Journal]] |volume= 20 |issue= 3 |pages= 647–72 |jstor= 2638433 |doi=10.1017/s0018246x00011286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
Frank Bourgin's study of the [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Constitutional Convention]] and subsequent decades argues that direct government involvement in the economy was intended by the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founders]].&lt;ref name=bourgin&gt;{{Cite book|first=Frank|last=Bourgin|title=The Great Challenge: The Myth of Laissez-Faire in the Early Republic|isbn=0-06-097296-3|year=1989|publisher=George Braziller Inc.|location=New York, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reason for this was the economic and financial chaos the nation suffered under the [[Articles of Confederation]]. The goal was to ensure that dearly-won political independence was not lost by being economically and financially dependent on the powers and princes of Europe. The creation of a strong central government able to promote science, invention, industry and commerce was seen as an essential means of promoting the general welfare and making the economy of the United States strong enough for them to determine their own destiny. One later result of this intent was the adoption of Richard Farrington's new plan (worked out with his co-worker John Jefferson) to incorporate new changes during the [[New Deal]]. Others, including Jefferson, view Bourgin's study, written in the 1940s and not published until 1989, as an over-interpretation of the evidence, intended originally to defend the New Deal and later to counter [[Ronald Reagan]]'s economic policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bourgin |first=Frank |url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/frank-bourgin/the-great-challenge-the-myth-of-laissez-faire-i/ |title=THE GREAT CHALLENGE: The Myth of Laissez-Faire in the Early Republic by Frank Bourgin &amp;#124; Kirkus |publisher=Kirkusreviews.com |date=1989-06-01 |accessdate=2013-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian Kathleen G. Donohue argues that [[classical liberalism]] in the United States in the 19th century had distinctive characteristics and that "at the center of classical liberal theory [in Europe] was the idea of ''laissez-faire''. To the vast majority of American classical liberals, however, ''laissez-faire'' did not mean "no government intervention" at all. On the contrary, they were more than willing to see government provide tariffs, railroad subsidies, and internal improvements, all of which benefited producers".

Notable examples of government intervention in the period prior to the Civil War include the establishment of the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office|Patent Office]] in 1802; the establishment of the Office of Standard Weights and Measures in 1830; the creation of the [[Coast and Geodetic Survey]] in 1807 and other measures to improve river and harbor navigation; the various [[United States Army|Army]] expeditions to the west, beginning with [[Lewis and Clark Expedition|Lewis and Clark]]'s [[Corps of Discovery]] in 1804 and continuing into the 1870s, almost always under the direction of an officer from the Army [[Corps of Topographical Engineers]] and which provided crucial information for the overland pioneers that followed; the assignment of Army Engineer officers to assist or direct the surveying and construction of the early railroads and canals; and the establishment of the [[First Bank of the United States]] and [[Second Bank of the United States]] as well as various protectionist measures (e.g. the [[Tariff of Abominations|tariff of 1828]]). Several of these proposals met with serious opposition and required a great deal of horse-trading to be enacted into law. For instance, the First National Bank would not have reached the desk of President [[George Washington]] in the absence of an agreement that was reached between [[Alexander Hamilton]] and several Southern members of Congress to locate the capitol in the [[District of Columbia]]. In contrast to Hamilton and the [[Federalist Party|Federalists]] was [[Thomas Jefferson]] and [[James Madison]]'s opposing political party, the [[Democratic-Republican Party|Democratic-Republicans]].

Most of the early opponents of ''laissez-faire'' capitalism in the United States subscribed to the [[American School (economics)|American School]]. This school of thought was inspired by the ideas of Hamilton, who proposed the creation of a [[First Bank of the United States|government-sponsored bank]] and increased tariffs to favor Northern industrial interests. Following Hamilton's death, the more abiding [[Protectionism|protectionist]] influence in the antebellum period came from [[Henry Clay]] and his ''[[American System (economic plan)|American System]]''.

In the early 19th century, "it is quite clear that the ''laissez-faire'' label is an inappropriate one" to apply to the relationship between the United States government and industry.&lt;ref name="Prince Taylor"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Prince|first1=Carl E.|last2=Taylor|first2=Seth|year=1982|title=Daniel Webster, the Boston Associates, and the U.S. Government's Role in the Industrializing Process, 1815–1830|journal=Journal of the Early Republic|volume=2|issue=3|pages=283–99|jstor=3122975|doi=10.2307/3122975 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-19th century, the United States followed the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]] tradition of [[economic nationalism]], which included increased state control, regulation and [[Macroeconomics|macroeconomic]] development of [[infrastructure]].&lt;ref name=guelzo&gt;{{cite book|first=Allen C.|last=Guelzo|title=Abraham Lincoln: Redeemer President|isbn=0-8028-3872-3|year=1999|url=https://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&amp;d=99466893|publisher=W.B. Eerdmans Pub. Co|location=Grand Rapids, Mich.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Public works]] such as the provision and regulation [[transportation]] such as railroads took effect. The [[Pacific Railway Acts]] provided the development of the [[First Transcontinental Railroad]].&lt;ref name="guelzo"/&gt; In order to help pay for its war effort in the [[American Civil War]], the [[Federal government of the United States|United States government]] imposed its first personal [[income tax]] on August 5, 1861 as part of the [[Revenue Act of 1861]] (3% of all incomes over US $800; rescinded in 1872).

Following the Civil War, the movement towards a [[mixed economy]] accelerated. Protectionism increased with the [[McKinley Tariff]] of 1890 and the [[Dingley Tariff]] of 1897. [[Government regulation]] of the economy expanded with the enactment of the [[Interstate Commerce Act of 1887]] and the [[Sherman Anti-trust Act]].

The [[Progressive Era]] saw the enactment of more controls on the economy as evidenced by the [[Woodrow Wilson]] administration's [[The New Freedom|New Freedom]] program.

Following [[World War I]] and the [[Great Depression]], the United States turned to a mixed economy which combined [[free enterprise]] with a [[Progressive tax|progressive income tax]] and in which from time to time the government stepped in to support and protect American industry from competition from overseas. For example, in the 1980s the government sought to protect the automobile industry by "voluntary" export restrictions from [[Japan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Robert W. Crandall|year=1987|title=The Effects of U.S. Trade Protection for Autos and Steel|journal=Brookings Papers on Economic Activity|volume=1987|issue=1|pages=271–88|doi=10.2307/2534518|publisher=Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, Vol. 1987, No. 1|jstor=2534518}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pietro S. Nivola wrote in 1986:{{quote|By and large, the comparative strength of the dollar against major foreign currencies has reflected high U.S. interest rates driven by huge federal budget deficits. Hence, the source of much of the current deterioration of trade is not the general state of the economy, but rather the government's mix of fiscal and monetary policies – that is, the problematic juxtaposition of bold tax reductions, relatively tight monetary targets, generous military outlays, and only modest cuts in major entitlement programs. Put simply, the roots of the trade problem and of the resurgent protectionism it has fomented are fundamentally political as well as economic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Pietro S. Nivola|year=1986|title=The New Protectionism: U.S. Trade Policy in Historical Perspective|journal=[[Political Science Quarterly]]|volume=101|issue=4|pages=577–600|doi=10.2307/2150795|publisher=Political Science Quarterly, Vol. 101, No. 4|jstor=2150795}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A more recent advocate of total ''laissez-faire'' has been [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivist]] [[Ayn Rand]], who described it as "the abolition of any and all forms of government intervention in production and trade, the separation of State and Economics, in the same way and for the same reasons as the separation of Church and State".&lt;ref&gt;Rand, Ayn ''Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal,'' Ch. 7, New American Library, Signet, 1967.&lt;/ref&gt; This viewpoint is summed up in what is known as the "Iron Law of Regulation", which states that all government economic regulation eventually leads to a net loss in social welfare.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Armstrong|first=J. Scott|last2=Green|first2=Kesten C.|date=2013-10-01|title=Effects of corporate social responsibility and irresponsibility policies|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0148296313000386|journal=Journal of Business Research|series=Strategic Thinking in Marketing|volume=66|issue=10|pages=1922–1927|doi=10.1016/j.jbusres.2013.02.014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Raw capitalism==
A closely related conception is that of raw/pure capitalism or unrestrained capitalism that refers to capitalism free of social [[regulation]]s,&lt;ref name="capfree"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nolan|first1=Peter|title=Capitalism and Freedom: The Contradictory Character of Globalisation|publisher=Anthem Press|isbn=9781843312826|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bQdQDJzOkBMC&amp;pg=PA3|accessdate=9 February 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; with low, minimal&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Orchard|first1=Lionel|last2=Stretton|first2=Hugh|title=Public Goods, Public Enterprise, Public Choice: Theoretical Foundations of the Contemporary Attack on Government|publisher=Springer|isbn=9781349235056|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rwW_DAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA230|accessdate=9 February 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; or no government and operating almost entirely on the [[profit motive]]. Other than ''laissez-faire'' economics and [[anarcho-capitalism]] it is not associated with a school of thought and typically has a bad connotation which hints towards a perceived need for restraint due to social needs and securities that can not be adequately responded to by companies with just a motive for making profit.

[[Robert Kuttner]] states that "for over a century, popular struggles in the [[democracies]] have used the [[nation-state]] to temper raw capitalism. The power of voters has offset the power of capital. But as national barriers have come down in the name of freer commerce, so has the capacity of governments to manage capitalism in a broad public interest. So the real issue is not 'trade' but democratic governance".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kuttner|first1=Robert|title=Globalization and Its Critics|url=|publisher=The American Prospect|accessdate=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main issues of raw capitalism are said to lie in its disregard for quality, [[durability]], [[sustainability]], respect for the [[Environmental protection|environment]] and human beings as well as a lack of [[morality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kerckhove|first1=Gilbert Van|title=Toxic Capitalism: The Orgy of Consumerism and Waste: Are We the Last Generation on Earth?|publisher=AuthorHouse|isbn=9781477219065|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=POefWmtaZcgC&amp;pg=PA17|accessdate=9 February 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; From this more critical angle, companies might (naturally) aim to "maximise profits" at the expense of workers' and broader social interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Müntefering's criticism of raw capitalism strikes a chord|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/6af06832-bdda-11d9-87aa-00000e2511c8.html|publisher=Financial Times|accessdate=9 February 2017}}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Raw/hyper-capitalism is a prime motive of [[cyberpunk]] in dystopian works such as ''[[Syndicate (2012 video game)|Syndicate]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Paris|first1=Jeffrey|title=Rethinking the End of Modernity|journal=Social Philosophy Today|date=1 July 2005|volume=21|pages=173–189|doi=10.5840/socphiltoday20052120|url=https://www.pdcnet.org/pdc/bvdb.nsf/purchase?openform&amp;fp=socphiltoday&amp;id=socphiltoday_2005_0021_0000_0173_0192|accessdate=26 July 2017|publisher=Philosophy Documentation Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kilgore|first1=Christopher D.|title=Bad Networks: From Virus to Cancer in Post-Cyberpunk Narrative|journal=Journal of Modern Literature|date=2017|volume=40|issue=2|pages=165–183|doi=10.2979/jmodelite.40.2.10|jstor=10.2979/jmodelite.40.2.10}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Additional citation needed|date=July 2017}}

==Critiques==
{{Further|Criticism of capitalism}}
Over the years, a number of economists have offered critiques of ''laissez-faire'' economics.

[[Adam Smith]] acknowledges deep moral ambiguities towards the system of capitalism.&lt;ref name="Spencer J. Pack 2010"&gt;Spencer J. Pack. Capitalism as a Moral System: Adam Smith's Critique of the Free Market Economy. Great Britain: Edward Elgar, 2010. Print&lt;/ref&gt; Smith had severe misgivings concerning some aspects of each of the major character-types produced by modern capitalist society: the landlords, the workers and the capitalists.&lt;ref name="Spencer J. Pack 2010"/&gt; Smith claimed "[t]he landlords' role in the economic process is passive. Their ability to reap a revenue solely from ownership of land tends to make them indolent and inept, and so they tend to be unable to even look after their own economic interests"&lt;ref name="Spencer J. Pack 2010"/&gt; and that "[t]he increase in population should increase the demand for food, which should increase rents, which should be economically beneficial to the landlords". According to Smith, the landlords should thus be in favour of policies which contribute to the growth in the wealth of nations. Unfortunately, they often are not in favour of these pro-growth policies because of their own indolent-induced ignorance and intellectual flabbiness.&lt;ref name="Spencer J. Pack 2010"/&gt;

The British economist [[John Maynard Keynes]] condemned ''laissez-faire'' economic policy on several occasions.&lt;ref&gt;Dostaler, Gilles, ''Keynes and His Battles'' (Edward Elgar Publishing, 2007), p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''The End of Laissez-faire'' (1926), one of the most famous of his critiques, Keynes argues that the doctrines of ''laissez-faire'' are dependent to some extent on improper deductive reasoning and Keynes says the question of whether a market solution or state intervention is better must be determined on a case-by-case basis.&lt;ref&gt;Dostaler 2007, p. 91; Barnett, Vincent, ''John Maynard Keynes'' (Routledge, 2013), p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Austrian School|Austrian economist]] [[Friedrich Hayek]] stated that a freely competitive, ''laissez-faire'' banking industry tends to be endogenously destabilizing and pro-cyclical. He stated that the need for [[central banking]] control was inescapable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=White|first=Lawrence H.|title=Why Didn't Hayek Favor Laissez Faire in Banking?|journal=History of Political Economy|year=1999|volume=31|issue=4|url=http://cameroneconomics.com/white-hayek-hope.pdf|accessdate=11 April 2013|doi=10.1215/00182702-31-4-753|pages=753–69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example is the statement by baseball player [[Yogi Berra]], "[[Texas]] has a lot of [[electricity|electrical]] votes", rather than "[[Electoral College (United States)|electoral votes]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://examples.yourdictionary.com/examples-of-malapropism.html Examples of Malapropism]. Examples.yourdictionary.com (2015-10-09). Retrieved on 2015-10-31.&lt;/ref&gt; Malapropisms often occur as [[speech error|errors]] in natural speech and are sometimes the subject of media attention, especially when made by politicians or other prominent individuals. Philosopher [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]] has noted that malapropisms show the complex process through which the brain translates thoughts into language.

Humorous malapropisms are the type that attract the most attention and commentary, but bland malapropisms are common in speech and writing.  

==Etymology==
The word "malapropism" (and its earlier variant "malaprop") comes from a character named "Mrs. Malaprop" in [[Richard Brinsley Sheridan]]'s 1775 play ''[[The Rivals]]''.&lt;ref name="oxforddict"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |year=2000 |title =malapropism, n. |encyclopedia=Oxford English Dictionary |edition=third |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=978-0-19-957112-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mrs. Malaprop frequently misspeaks (to comic effect) by using words which don't have the meaning that she intends but which sound similar to words that do. Sheridan presumably chose her name in humorous reference to the word ''malapropos,'' an adjective or adverb meaning "inappropriate" or "inappropriately", derived from the [[French language|French]] phrase ''mal à propos'' (literally "poorly placed"). According to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', the first recorded use of "malapropos" in English is from 1630,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |year=2000 |title =malapropos, adv., adj., and n. |encyclopedia=Oxford English Dictionary |edition=third |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=978-0-19-957112-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the first person known to have used the word "malaprop" in the sense of "a speech error" is [[Lord Byron]] in 1814.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |year=2000 |title =malaprop, n. and adj. |encyclopedia=Oxford English Dictionary |edition=third |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=978-0-19-957112-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The synonymous term "Dogberryism" comes from the 1598 Shakespeare play ''[[Much Ado About Nothing]]'' in which the character [[Dogberry]] utters many malapropisms to humorous effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Situated Utterances|first=Harry|last=Berger|page=499|publisher=Fordham University Press|year=2005|isbn=0-8232-2429-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though Shakespeare was an earlier writer than Sheridan, "malaprop/malapropism" seems an earlier coinage than "Dogberryism", which is not attested until 1836.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |year=2010 |title =Dogberry, n.2 |encyclopedia=Oxford English Dictionary online |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=978-0-19-957112-3 |url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/56415 |accessdate=2013-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distinguishing features==
An instance of speech error is called a malapropism when a word is produced which is nonsensical or ludicrous in context, yet similar in sound to what was intended.&lt;ref name="AitchisonStraf"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Aitchison |first1=Jeanne |last2=Straf |first2=Miron |editor=Anne Cutler|title=Slips of the Tongue and Language Production|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ILBaZpZIyXEC |accessdate=2013-09-12 |year=1982 |publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=978-3-11-082830-6 |pages=197–242 |chapter=Lexical storage and retrieval: a developing skill?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Definitions differ somewhat in terms of the cause of the error. Some scholars include only errors that result from a temporary failure to produce the word which the speaker intended.&lt;ref name="FayCutler"&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Malapropisms and the Structure of the Mental Lexicon|jstor=4177997|url=http://www.mpi.nl/publications/escidoc-68653 |last1=Fay |first1=David |last2=Cutler |first2=Anne |journal=Linguistic Inquiry |volume=8 |issue=3 |year=1977 |pages=505–520}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such errors are sometimes called "Fay-Cutler malapropism", after David Fay and Anne Cutler, who described the occurrence of such errors in ordinary speech.&lt;ref name="AitchisonStraf" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Zwicky"&gt;{{cite book|last=Zwicky|first=Arnold|editor=Loraine Obler and Lise Menn|title=Exceptional Language and Linguistics|url=http://www.stanford.edu/~zwicky/malapropism-mental-lexicon.pdf|accessdate=2013-09-12|year=1982|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=978-0-12-523680-5|pages=115–132|chapter=Classical malapropisms and the creation of the mental lexicon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most definitions, however, include any actual word that is wrongly or accidentally used in place of a similar sounding, correct word. This broader definition is sometimes called "classical malapropism",&lt;ref name="Zwicky" /&gt; or simply "malapropism".&lt;ref name="AitchisonStraf" /&gt;

Malapropisms differ from other kinds of speaking or writing mistakes, such as [[eggcorn]]s or [[spoonerism]]s, and from the accidental or deliberate production of newly made-up words ([[neologisms]]).&lt;ref name="Zwicky" /&gt;

For example, it is not a malapropism to use ''obtuse'' [wide or dull] instead of ''acute'' [narrow or sharp]; it is a malapropism to use ''obtuse'' [stupid or slow-witted] when one means ''abstruse'' [esoteric or difficult to understand].

Malapropisms tend to maintain the [[part of speech]] of the originally intended word. According to linguist [[Jean Aitchison]], "The finding that word selection errors preserve their part of speech suggest that the latter is an integral part of the word, and tightly attached to it."&lt;ref name="Aitchison"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Aitchison |first=Jean |year=2012 |title=Words in the Mind: An Introduction to the Mental Lexicon |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=1118170962}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, substitutions tend to have the same number of [[syllable]]s and the same [[Metrical phonology|metrical structure]] – the same pattern of [[Stress (linguistics)|stressed]] and unstressed syllables – as the intended word or phrase. If the stress pattern of the malapropism differs from the intended word, unstressed syllables may be deleted or inserted; stressed syllables and the general rhythmic pattern are maintained.&lt;ref name="Aitchison" /&gt;

==Examples from fiction==
The fictional Mrs. Malaprop in Sheridan's play ''[[The Rivals]]'' utters many malapropisms. In Act 3 Scene III, she declares to Captain Absolute, "Sure, if I ''reprehend'' any thing in this world it is the use of my ''[[oracular]]'' tongue, and a nice ''derangement'' of ''[[epitaph]]s''!"&lt;ref name="Rivals"&gt;{{Citation |year=2008 |origyear=1775 |title=The Rivals: A Comedy |last=Sheridan |first=Richard Brinsley |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24761 |accessdate=2012-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; This nonsensical utterance might, for example, be corrected to, "If I ''apprehend'' anything in this world, it is the use of my ''[[vernacular]]'' tongue, and a nice ''arrangement'' of ''[[epithet]]s''",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Quotations from Richard Brinsley Sheridan |publisher=Poem Hunter |url=http://www.poemhunter.com/quotations/famous.asp?people=Richard%20Brinsley%20Sheridan&amp;p=2 |accessdate=2012-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; —although these are not the only words that can be substituted to produce an appropriately expressed thought in this context, and commentators have proposed other possible replacements that work just as well.

Other malapropisms spoken by Mrs. Malaprop include "''illiterate'' him quite from your memory" (instead of "obliterate"), and "she's as headstrong as an ''allegory'' on the banks of the Nile" (instead of ''alligator'').&lt;ref name="Rivals" /&gt;

Malapropisms appeared in many works before Sheridan created the character of Mrs. Malaprop. [[William Shakespeare]] used them in a number of his plays, almost invariably spoken by comic ill-educated lower class characters. [[Mistress Quickly]], the inn-keeper associate of Falstaff in several Shakespeare plays, is a regular user of malapropisms.&lt;ref&gt;Fergusun, Margaret, ''Dido's Daughters: Literacy, Gender, and Empire in Early Modern England and France'', University of Chicago Press, 2007, p.17.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Much Ado About Nothing]]'', Constable Dogberry tells Governor Leonato, "Our watch, sir, have indeed ''comprehended'' two ''auspicious'' persons" (i.e., ''apprehended'' two ''suspicious'' persons) (Act 3, Scene V).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |year=1997 |origyear=1598 |title=Much Ado About Nothing |last=Shakespeare |first=William |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1118 |accessdate=2012-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Malapropism was one of [[Stan Laurel]]'s comic mannerisms. In ''[[Sons Of The Desert]]'', for example, he says that [[Oliver Hardy]] is suffering a nervous "shakedown" (rather than "breakdown"), calls the Exalted Ruler of their group the "exhausted ruler" and says that he and Oliver are like "two peas in a pot" (meaning "pod"); in ''The Music Box'', he inadvertently asked a policeman, "Don't you think you're bounding over your steps?" meaning "overstepping your bounds" – which Hardy corrected, causing the cop to get more angry at him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gehring|first=Wes|title=Laurel and Hardy: A Bio-Bibliography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VcVohkED9e4C|accessdate=11 December 2012|year=1990|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-25172-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; British comedian [[Ronnie Barker]] also made great use of deliberate malapropisms in his comedy, notably in such sketches as his "Appeal on behalf of the Loyal Society for the Relief of Suffers from Pismronunciation", which mixed malapropisms and garbled words for comic effect – including news of a speech which "gave us a few ''well-frozen worms'' (i.e., well-chosen words) in praise of the society."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/media/2005/oct/04/bbc.arts Ronnie Barker monologue: Pismronunciation]", ''The Guardian'', 4 October 2005. Retrieved 6 July 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Primary source inline|date=June 2016}}

[[Ring Lardner]] used malapropism extensively for comic effect. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=|title=The Lost Journalism of Ring Lardner|last=Lardner|first=Ring|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|year=2017|isbn=0803269730|editor-last=Rapoport|editor-first=Ron|location=Nebraska|pages=531}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in his short story ''The Young Immigrunts'' the four-year-old narrator repeatedly refers to a bride and groom as the "bride and glum." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ring Lardner: Stories &amp; Other Writings|last=Lardner|first=Ring|publisher=Library of America|year=2013|isbn=1598532537|editor-last=Frazier|editor-first=Ian|location=New York|pages=310}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The episode entitled "[[List of Monty Python's Flying Circus episodes|E. Henry Thripshaw's Disease]]" of ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]'' features a man who speaks in malapropisms, among other incorrect verbiage. It begins with the sketch "The Man Who Says Words in the Wrong Order," the doctor trying to capitalize on the discovery of his case's malapropism (naming the disease after himself),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.montypython.net/scripts/wrongorder.php |title=The Man Who Says Words in the Wrong Order |author=[[Monty Python]] |date=21 December 1972 |website=MontyPython.net |publisher=[[BBC]] |access-date=8 June 2018 |quote=Well, absolutely, and what makes it worse, sometimes at the end of a sentence I'll come out with the wrong fusebox.}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Primary source inline|date=November 2018}} and ends with the next sketch "Thripshaw's Disease" in which a review of the film based on the disease is instead scenes from the Polish film ''[[Knights of the Teutonic Order (film)|Knights of the Teutonic Order]]''. Believing the first film to miss the point Dr Thripshaw's disease, he remakes the film nearly identical to the first version, but with the addition of a medical office visit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.montypython.net/scripts/thripshaw.php |title=Thripshaw's Disease |author=[[Monty Python]] |date=21 December 1972 |website=MontyPython.net |publisher=[[BBC]] |access-date=8 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Primary source inline|date=November 2018}}

[[Archie Bunker]], a character in the American TV sitcom ''[[All in the Family]]'', is also known for malapropisms. He calls [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jews]] "off-the-docks Jews" and refers to "the Women's ''Lubrication'' Movement" (rather than ''Liberation'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Shapiro|first1=Marianne |last2=Shapiro|first2=Michael |title=From The Critic's Workbench: Essays In Literature And Semiotics |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Vkww4u5BnU0C&amp;pg=PA471 |accessdate=2012-07-10 |year=2005 |publisher=Peter Lang |isbn=978-0-8204-7915-6 |chapter=Chapter 21: The semiotics of Archie Bunker}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Malapropisms do not occur only as comedic literary devices. They also occur as a kind of [[speech error]] in ordinary speech.&lt;ref name="FayCutler" /&gt; Examples are often quoted in the media. Welsh Conservative leader [[Andrew R. T. Davies|Andrew Davies]] encouraged the Conservative party conference to make ''breakfast'' (''[[Brexit]]'') a success. [[Bertie Ahern]], former [[Taoiseach]] of [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], warned his country against "upsetting the ''apple tart''" (''apple cart'') of his country's economic success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1614940,00.html | work=Time | title=Mr. Popularity | date=2007-04-26 | accessdate=2010-05-12 | first=Catherine | last=Mayer}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Brexit means breakfast for Welsh Tory leader Davies|date=2016-10-04|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-politics-37551132|language=en-GB|accessdate=2016-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former Chicago Mayor [[Richard J. Daley]] referred to a [[tandem bicycle]] as a "tantrum bicycle" and made mention of "Alcoholics ''Unanimous''" ([[Alcoholics Anonymous]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kennedy |first=Eugene |title=Himself!: The Life and Times of Mayor Richard J.

Former Australian Prime Minister [[Tony Abbott]] once claimed that no one "is the ''[[suppository]]'' of all wisdom" (i.e., ''[[:wikt:repository|repository]]'' or ''depository'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Liberals squirm as Abbott refers to 'the suppository of wisdom'|publisher=''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]''|date=2013-08-12|url=http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/federal-election-2013/liberals-squirm-as-abbott-refers-to-the-suppository-of-wisdom-20130812-2rryy.html|language=|accessdate=2017-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, as reported in ''[[New Scientist]]'', an office worker had described a colleague as "a vast ''suppository'' of information". The worker then apologised for his "''[[Miss Marple|Miss-Marple-ism]]''" (i.e. ''malapropism'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg18625042.600-feedback.html|title=New Scientist 18 June 2005 '&amp;#39;Malapropism for malapropism'&amp;#39;|last=|first=|date=2005-06-18|website=|publisher=Newscientist.com|url-access=subscription|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2012-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''New Scientist'' noted this as possibly the first time anyone had uttered a malapropism for the word ''malapropism'' itself.

Former Texas Governor [[Rick Perry]] has been known to commonly utter malapropisms; for example, he described states as "[[toilet (room)|lavatories]] of innovation and democracy" instead of "laboratories".&lt;ref&gt;Whittaker, Richard.

==Philosophical implications==
In his essay "A Nice Derangement of Epitaphs", philosopher [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]] suggests that malapropisms reveal something about how people process the meanings of words. He argues that language competence must not simply involve learning a set meaning for each word, and then rigidly applying those semantic rules to decode other people's utterances. Rather, he says, people must also be continually making use of other contextual information to interpret the meaning of utterances, and then modifying their understanding of each word's meaning based on those interpretations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Davidson |first=Donald |chapter=A Nice Derangement of Epitaphs |pages=157–174 |editor=R.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3067">'''Margaret Elizabeth Ashley-Towle''' (January 12, 1902 – November 2, 1985) was an American [[archaeology|archaeologist]]. She born in [[Atlanta, Georgia]] to Claude Lordawick Ashley, a chief of the Atlanta city council, and Elizabeth Miller, the daughter of Captain Hiram Miller, a veteran of the Federal army.

==Education and career==
After graduating from [[Oglethorpe University]] in Atlanta with an A.B. in English literature and a minor in journalism in 1923, Ashley enrolled in [[Columbia University]], pursuing a graduate degree in [[anthropology]]. While at Columbia, she studied under [[Franz Boas]]. In 1926, Ashley began work at what is now known as the [[Shinholser]] site (9Bl12) in [[Baldwin County, Georgia]].

In July 1927, she began working on her dissertation topic, “An Archaeological Survey of Georgia”.  By September of that year, already recognized as an expert in her field, Ashley was asked to organize a department of [[archaeology]] for [[Emory University]] and to represent Emory in [[Warren K. Moorehead]]’s excavations at the [[Etowah River|Etowah]] site in northern Georgia. Ashley accepted this position and discontinued her official studies at Columbia.

While working for Emory, Ashley, along with [[Frank T. Schnell Sr.]], performed significant excavations at Lockett Mound, now known as the [[Neisler]] site (9Tr1), located near the Flint River. Ashley and Schnell spent three weeks at Neisler, performing major trench excavation atop the mound and surveying 250 test units. Two fire pits were uncovered on the mound and fourteen burials excavated in the outlying area.

On February 18, 1930, Ashley married Gerald Towle, a [[Harvard]] graduate and Moorehead's top field assistant. Upon her marriage, Margaret abandoned archaeology for some fourteen years, never to resume field work in Georgia. In 1944, directly after Gerald's death, she returned to her pursuits at Columbia, this time studying [[ethnobotany]].  In 1958, Margaret completed her dissertation, ''The Ethnobotany of Pre-Columbian Peru as Evidenced by Archaeological Materials'', and received her Ph.D.

Upon completing her studies at Columbia, Margaret worked for the [[Harvard Botanical Museum]] as an unpaid associate until her death on November 2, 1985.

In 2000 she completed her post-doctoral qualification (habilitation) at the faculty of History, Philosophy and Social Sciences at Martin-Luther University in Halle-Wittenberg. For her habilitation thesis on the sociology of space she was awarded the Christian-Wolff Prize. 
Löw taught and conducted research as professor of sociology at the [[Darmstadt University of Technology]] from 2002 until 2013, specialising in space-related social analysis, [[urban sociology|urban and regional sociology]], [[gender studies|women’s and gender studies]]. Since August 2013 she is professor for the sociology of planning and architecture at the [[Technical University of Berlin]]. At an earlier stage of her career, she held the position of assistant professor at the [[University of Halle-Wittenberg|Martin Luther University of Halle/Saale]], was a researcher at the famous Institute of Social Research in [[Frankfurt am Main]], and visiting professor at the [[Technical University of Berlin|Technical Universities of Berlin]] and Darmstadt.

==Work==
In 2001, Löw published a [[Sociology of space]], which understands the origination of space as a social phenomenon that depends of societal developments. Löw understands space as a relational ordering of social goods and living beings that is generated by the synthesis and placing of these elements. Such a processual concept of space contrasts with the view that has hitherto prevailed in sociology of space as a rigid backdrop to social processes. On this basis, Löw is conducting empirical research into how spatial constructions change in and through electronic networks. Other focuses of research are “space, power, and social differentiation” and ethnographic urban studies.

In the field of [[urban sociology|urban research]], a range of studies in the topic areas "public security" and "theatre and city" have been carried out. An empirical study on the interactional web of space and gender that examines prostitution in Frankfurt am Main complements the topic area. Among her latest research ventures is the analysis of the intrinsic logic of cities. The intrinsic logic of cities refers to a complex ensemble of knowledge stocks and forms of expression which interrelate internally, are based on rule-governed, routinized and resource-stabilised forms of action and which condense cities into provinces of meaning.

In 2008 Löw became senior coordinator of the University of Technology Darmstadt’s and the University of Applied Sciences’ joint project “Intrinsic Logic of Cities”, sponsored by the Land Hesse’s Ministry of Economics and Arts to promote scientific and economic excellence. “Intrinsic Logic” is a heuristic term trying to conceptualise and capture the specific and “typical” characteristics and qualities of a city, as well as the tacit [[meaning-making]] processes shaping its "image" and contributing to "making sense" of it. The objective is to ultimately work out the fundamental structures shaping a particular city, and to better understand relations, similarities and differences between cities. The method of choice is comparative research between cities.

It is a fresh approach to urban studies that differs fundamentally from other sociological perspectives, which usually take the city under investigation as a given fact(or) requiring no further research, instead of scrutinising its basic formative structures and processes. The focus on the intrinsic logic puts the city itself centrestage and explores its overall make-up in a holistic way in its physical, relational and symbolic dimensions.

==History==
There is no proof for administration of Muslim personal law until 1206 in Indian peninsula, even though there were Muslim invasions during this period.&lt;ref name="abdulrahiman"/&gt; During the reign of Slave dynasty  (1206-1290 A.D), Khalji dynasty (1290- 1321), the Tughlak dynasty (1321-1413), the Lodi dynasty (1451 - 1526) and the Sur dynasty (1539- 1555), the court of Shariat, assisted by the Mufti, dealt with the cases involving personal law among Muslims. During Sher Shah's regime, the powers of Shariat court were restricted and Muslim law was modified to suit the requirements of the times.&lt;ref name="abdulrahiman"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rahiman|first1=Abdul, K.K|title=History of the Evolution of Muslim Personal Law in India|url=http://www.dharmaramjournals.in/ArticleFiles/History%20of%20the%20Evolution%20of%20Muslim%20Personal%20Law--K.%20K.%20Abdul%20Rahiman.pdf|publisher=Journal of Dharma: Dharmaram Journal  of Religions and Philosophies|accessdate=1 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the regime of [[Mughal dynasty|Mughal kings]] [[Babur]] and [[Humayun]], the earlier laws were followed, and the ''ulemas'' (religious scholars) had considerable influence on legal decisions. During Akhbar's regime, Ulemas' powers were significantly reduced and shattered the dominance of the orthodox Sunni school. During [[Jehangir]]'s regime, cutting of noses and ears and death penalty could not be inflicted without the permission of the Emperor. Aurangazeb ordered for the complication of code of law.&lt;ref name="abdulrahiman" /&gt;

===Under East India Company===
Under the East India company, Muslim Law was enforced except when Muslims left the disputes to be determined according to Hindu ''Saastras''.&lt;ref name="abdulrahiman" /&gt; The Regulation 11 of .1772 by Sec. 27 enacted that {{Quote
|text= "in all suits regarding inheritance, succession, marriage and caste and other religious usages or institutions, the laws of the Quran with respect of Mohamedan and those of the Shastras with respect to Gentoos (Hindus) shall be invariably adhered to."}}
In 1822, the Privy Council recognized the right of [[Shia]] Muslims to their own law.

===Under British India===
The Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act was passed on 7 October 1937 in [[British India]] to ensure that Indians following Islamic faith shall be ruled according to their cultural norms.&lt;ref name="indianexpress1"/&gt; This Act gave strength to the pre-existing customary laws, although it was in conflict with Islamic jurisprudence in several aspects.&lt;ref name="abdulrahiman" /&gt; This Act is still being followed in India in matters related to marriage, divorce and succession among Muslims.&lt;ref name="indianexpress1"/&gt;&lt;ref name= scroll&gt;{{cite web|last1=Daniyal|first1=Shoaib|title=A short history of Muslim personal law in  India|url=https://scroll.in/article/849068/a-short-history-of-muslim-personal-law-in-india|website=Scroll.in|publisher=Scroll.in|accessdate=2 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dissolution of Muslim Marriage Act was passed in 1939, in order to give Muslim women the right to seek divorce.

==Marriage and Divorce==
In India, Muslim marriage is a civil contract between a man and a woman. Dissolution of marriage can be done at the instance of the husband (''[[talaq]]''), wife (''[[khula]]'') or mutually (''[[mubarat]]''). Talaq allows Muslim men to legally divorce his wife by stating the word talaq (Arabic word for divorce) three times with 3 months period between all three, in oral. written and electronic form of talaq is not allowed in Islamic law.&lt;ref name= practicallaw&gt;{{cite web|title=Practical Law UK Signon|url=https://uk.practicallaw.thomsonreuters.com/6-581-5985?transitionType=Default&amp;contextData=(sc.Default)&amp;firstPage=true&amp;bhcp=1|website=uk.practicallaw.thomsonreuters.com|publisher=Thompson Reuters|accessdate=2 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Muslim groups recognize [[Triple talaq in India|triple talaq]] (or talaq-i-biddat), stating three talaqs at once and proclaiming instant divorce as valid method of divorce.&lt;ref name="hanafi"&gt;{{cite web|title=Hanafi jurisprudence sanctions triple talaq - Times of India|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/hanafi-jurisprudence-sanctions-triple-talaq/articleshow/60182584.cms|website=The Times of India|accessdate=2 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 August 2017, the [[Supreme Court of India]] deemed instant triple talaq unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Triple Talaq verdict: What exactly is instant divorce practice banned by court?|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/triple-talaq-verdict-what-exactly-is-instant-divorce-practice-banned-by-court/story-mhQ1SbxnCUUgySQq82sdbJ.html|website=hindustantimes.com|publisher=Hindustan Times|accessdate=2 December 2017|language=en|date=22 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other Muslim groups follow ''talaq-i-hasan'', where the husband pronounces three talaqs on three separate instances, each one at least 1 lunar month apart. If the husband changes mind after the first or the second talaq, or cohabits with the wife, the divorce is revoked.&lt;ref name= practicallaw /&gt; In Islam, only husband can pronounce the talaq on his wife, and not vice versa. However, he can delegate this power to his wife or a third person by agreement, called talaq-e-tafweez.&lt;ref name= practicallaw /&gt; The Muslim man does not have to cite a reason for divorce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Supreme Court suspends 'triple talaq' divorce law|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/08/india-supreme-court-suspends-muslim-divorce-law-170822052829982.html|website=www.aljazeera.com|publisher=Al-Jazeera|accessdate=2 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Section 5 of Shariat Act of 1937 concerns with Muslim women seeking dissolution of her marriage. Section 5 was subsequently deleted and replaced by Dissolution of Muslim Marriages Act 1939. Muslim women can seek divorce at the court of law. A woman can ask for divorce in the following circumstances:
* if whereabouts of the husband has not been known for a period of four years
* if the husband has neglected or failed to provide for her maintenance for a period of two years
* if the husband has been sentenced to imprisonment for a period of seven years or upwards
* if the husband has failed to perform his marital obligations for a period of three years
* if the husband was impotent at the time of marriage and continues to do so
* if the husband has been insane for a period of two years or is suffering from leprosy or virulent venereal disease
* if the husband treats the wife with cruelty, even if such conduct does not amount to physical violence
* if the wife has been given in marriage by her father or guardian before she attained 15 years of age
* if the husband associates with women of evil repute or leads an infamous life or attempts to force her to lead an immoral life
* if the husband disposes of her property or prevents her exercising her legal rights over it
* if the husband obstructs her in the observance of her religious profession or practice
* if he has more wives than one, does not treat her equitably in accordance with the injunctions of the Quran; or
carries out any other ground recognised as valid for the dissolution of marriages under Muslim law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Dissolution of Muslim Marriages Act, 1939|url=https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1458498/|website=indiankanoon.org|accessdate=2 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inheritance==
===Rules of inheritance===
* A son gets double the share of the daughter wherever they inherit together.&lt;ref name="makaan" /&gt;
* The wife gets one-eighth of the share if there are children and one-fourth of the share if there are no children. In case the husband has more than one wife, the one-eighth share will be divided equally among all wives. The husband gets one fourth of the share of his dead wife's property,If there are children and one-half if there are no children &lt;ref&gt;mulla mohammaden law vol. 3&lt;/ref&gt;.
* If the parent has more than one daughter, only two-third of the property shall be divided equally among daughters. If the parent has only one daughter, half of the parent's property is inherited by her.
* The mother gets one-sixth of her dead child's property if there are grandchildren, and one-third of the property if there are no grandchildren.
* Parents, children, husband and wife must, in all cases, get shares, whatever may be the number or degree of the other heirs.
* Slavery, homicide, difference of religion and difference of allegiance, exclude from inheritance.

===Mahr===
[[Mahr]] is the total money or property that the husband is required to give the wife at the time of marriage ([[Nikah]]). There are two types of mahr, the prompt mahr which is given to the wife soon after the marriage, and the deferred mahr which is given to the wife when the marriage has ended, either due to the death of the husband or by divorce.&lt;ref name="makaan"&gt;{{cite web|title=A Muslim Woman's Right To Property In Islamic Law|url=https://www.makaan.com/iq/legal-taxes-laws/examining-a-muslim-womans-right-to-property|publisher=Makaan|accessdate=2 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Will===
A Muslim can only give one third of his/her total property through a will ([[Wasiyat]]).&lt;ref name="makaan" /&gt;

===Gift===
Any type of property can be given as gift by a Muslim.&lt;ref name="makaan" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8294">[[File:Mästermyr chest 2.jpg|thumb|300px|Mästermyr chest]]
The '''Mästermyr chest''' is a [[Viking Age]] (793–1066) tool chest found in the [[Mästermyr]] [[mire]] west of [[Hemse]] on the island of [[Gotland]], Sweden. It is the largest tool find from that era in Europe.

== History ==
During the Viking Age, the area where Mästermyr mire is located used to be a lake. The mire was drained in 1902–10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Carlquist|editor-first=Gunnar|date=1937 |title=Svensk uppslagsbok|volume=18|location=Malmö |publisher=Svensk Uppslagsbok AB |page=593–94}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1936, the chest was found by farmer Hugo Kraft in a field owned by Emil Norrby in Snoder, Sproge near Hemse.&lt;ref name=mastermyr /&gt; It was found in an area that was plowed for the first time.&lt;ref name=locks&gt;{{cite web|title=Tidigare publikationer om Mästermyrfyndet|trans-title=Earlier publications about the Mästermyr find|url=http://www.historicallocks.com/sv/site/historical-locks/sakerhetsskap/mastermyr-och-oseberg/tidigare-publikationer-om-mastermyrfyndet/|website=www.historicallocks.com|publisher=[[Assa Abloy]]|accessdate=11 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The chest is on display in the [[Swedish History Museum]] in Stockholm.&lt;ref name=historiska&gt;{{cite web|title=Föremål 107095. SHM 21592:132|trans-title=Object 107095.

== Find ==
[[File:Mästermyr chest 1.jpg|thumb|Back and side of the chest]]
Most of the find had been placed in the chest, but there were also objects around it such as three [[bronze]] [[cauldron]]s, three [[cowbell|bells]] and a fire-grid of iron.&lt;ref name=mastermyr /&gt; A chain, made up of 26 figure-of-eight shaped links, was wrapped around it.&lt;ref name=mastermyr /&gt; It served both as an extra lock and handle since the chest was too heavy for the original handle.&lt;ref name=kistan&gt;{{cite web|title=Beskrivning av kistan|trans-title=Description of the chest|url=http://www.historicallocks.com/sv/site/historical-locks/Sakerhetsskap/Mastermyr-och-Oseberg/Beskrivning-av-kistan/|website=www.historicallocks.com|publisher=[[Assa Abloy]]|accessdate=12 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chest and the other items had probably been placed in a boat which capsized and sank in the lake.&lt;ref name=gute&gt;{{cite web|last1=Enderborg|first1=Bernt|title=Vikingatida verktyg från Mästermyr|trans-title=Viking Age tools from Mästermyr|url=http://www.guteinfo.com/?id=614|website=www.guteinfo.com|publisher=Guteinfo.com|accessdate=12 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another theory is that the chest was temporarily hidden at the water's edge.&lt;ref name=mastermyr /&gt;

The chest contained Viking-era [[blacksmith]]ing and [[woodworking]] tools. It also contained several products of such work, including elements of several [[Lock (security device)|locks]].&lt;ref name=tool&gt;{{cite book|last1=Arwidsson|author1-link=Greta Arwidsson|first1=Greta|last2=Berg|first2=Gösta|title=The Mästermyr find: a Viking Age tool chest from Gotland|date=1983|publisher=Vitterhets-, historie- och antikvitetsakad.|location=Stockholm|isbn=978-91-7402-129-5|url=http://libris.kb.se/bib/7640458}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chest and its contents provide a valuable insight into technology during the Viking Age.

The chest, {{convert|90|cm|in|abbr=on}} long, {{convert|26|cm|in|abbr=on}} wide and {{convert|24|cm|in|abbr=on}} high, was made of oak with iron hinges and lock.&lt;ref name=locks /&gt; It was intact despite the rough encounter with the plow. It was rectangular with a slightly curved lid and flat bottom. The bottom was joined to the ends via a [[Mortise and tenon|mortise and through tenon]]. Pegs were used to attach the sides to the bottom and end pieces. The ends and sides were trapezoidal and slightly angled.&lt;ref name=tool /&gt; A lock wrought from iron was attached to the front side of the chest.&lt;ref name=kistan /&gt;

Given the wide range of tools and objects in varying styles in the find, and the lack of coins or other chronological markers, it has been impossible to determine an exact date for the chest. The wider term "Viking Age" around 1000, is used for dating it.&lt;ref name=mastermyr /&gt;

== Contents of the chest ==
The chest contained over 200 tools and blacksmith works or works in progress, making it the largest Viking tool find in Europe.&lt;ref name=gute /&gt; The tools resemble early [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] tools, now on display in museums in Germany, among those the [[Saalburg]]. Technological influences spread throughout Europe with the expansion of the Roman empire. The ensuing trade carried ideas and craftsmanship further to regions far from Rome.&lt;ref name=kistan /&gt;

The contents of the chest indicate that it belonged to a travelling craftsman who made repairs and produced new items. The tools show that he was a smith and a carpenter, and had some knowledge of locks, [[coppersmith|coppersmithing]] and [[Cooper (profession)|coopering]].&lt;ref name=locks /&gt; Among the items were three [[padlock]]s of a design inspired by Roman locks and of the same kind that were found at excavations in [[Birka]].&lt;ref name=locks /&gt;

'''''Newfangle''''' is a [[BBC Radio 4]] [[Situation comedy|sitcom]] written by [[Adam Rosenthal]] and [[Viv Ambrose]], first broadcast on 1 June 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comedy.org.uk/guide/radio/newfangle/details/|title=Newfangle - Production Details, Plus Regular Cast and Crew|publisher=[[British Comedy Guide]]|accessdate=1 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series is set hundreds of thousands of years ago amongst a tribe of [[Archaic humans|proto-humans]]. Newfangle (played by [[Russell Tovey]]), is a low status member of his tribe who tries to improve his status in the tribe by coming up with new [[invention]]s such as [[language]], [[fire]] and [[money]]. However, all of his inventions are stolen by the tribe's [[alpha male]], Alf ([[Hugh Bonneville]]).&lt;ref name="BCG"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comedy.org.uk/guide/radio/newfangle/|title=Newfangle|publisher=[[British Comedy Guide]]|accessdate=1 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Newfangle is a low status member of an early tribe of proto-humans living hundreds of thousands of years ago. What time exactly is unknown and different times are given on different websites. The BBC website says it takes place in 100,000 B.C.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00knpzk|title=Newfangle|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=1 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; while an earlier statement from the BBC Press Office said it was set, "hundreds of thousands of years ago",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/proginfo/radio/2009/wk22/mon.shtml#mon_radio4|title=Newfangle|publisher=[[BBC|BBC Press Office]]|accessdate=1 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the website for the show's production company, [[Above the Title Productions]], claims it is set two million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abovethetitle.com/product/NEWFANGLE/|title=Newfangle|publisher=[[Above the Title]]|accessdate=1 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Newfangle's father, Fangle, was the alpha male before he was ambushed and killed by the current alpha male Alf. Newfangle tries to constantly improve his position in the tribe by inventing new things such as language, [[warfare]] and [[music]]. However, Alf constantly steals Newfangle's ideas in order to keep his position.&lt;ref name="BCG"/&gt;

Newfangle also tries to use his ideas to impress other members of the tribe, especially a female he is in love with, Snaggle ([[Pippa Evans]]) but his ideas tend to fail rather than impress. Although, in the last episode, she confesses her love for Newfangle to the Voice in the Tree-Stump (unaware it is Newfangle) He also tries to impress his mother Coco ([[Maureen Lipman]]), but she considers him to be weak and places more confidence in Newfangle's half-brother Crag ([[Gabriel Vick]]).&lt;ref name="BCG"/&gt;

==Reception==
''Newfangle'' received positive reviews. [[Gillian Reynolds]] from the ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' described it as a, "Thoughtful, inventive comedy", adding, "Soon prehistory turns out to quite a lot like life anywhere, anytime. But funnier."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Reynolds|first=Gillian|authorlink=Gillian Reynolds|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/culturecritics/gillianreynolds/5408049/Radio-Highlights-Monday-1-June.html|title=Radio Highlights: Monday 1 June|publisher=''[[Daily Telegraph]]''|date=29 May 2009|accessdate=1 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Frances Lass]] from the ''[[Radio Times]]'' also praised the programme saying that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"I love this. I love everything about it - from Russell Tovey's aping of the lowly hominid of the title who invents language to express his unrequited love and his protests about always being beaten up by the alpha male, to Adam Rosenthal and Viv Ambrose's gloriously scrumptious and clever script. Set in the primordial mud, a group of apes on the brink of evolving into humans grapple with those things that progress entails. And yet, their hierarchies and obsessions seem awfully familiar and modern. Probably coming to a TV series near you. Og me if it doesn't!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lass|first=Frances|title=Newfangle|publisher=''[[Radio Times]]''|date=1 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==In linguistics==
In the field of [[sociolinguistics]], the term Observer’s Paradox was coined by [[William Labov]], who stated with regards to the term:

&lt;blockquote&gt;the aim of linguistic research in the community must be to find out how people talk when they are not being systematically observed; yet we can only obtain this data by systematic observation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Labov|first=William|title=Sociolinguistic Patterns|year=1972|publisher=University of Pennsylvania|location=Philadelphia|isbn=0631177205|pages=209}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

The term refers to the challenge sociolinguists face while doing fieldwork, where the task of gathering data on [[Vernacular#An informal register|natural speech]] is undermined by the researcher's presence itself.  As a field worker attempts to observe the daily [[vernacular]] of a speaker in an interview, the speaker, aware that their speech will be used for scholarly research, is likely to adopt a formal [[Register (sociolinguistics)|register]].  This produces data that is not representative of the speaker's typical speech, and the paradox lies in the fact that if the researcher was not present, the speaker would use normal vernacular.

==Hawthorne effect==
{{main article|Hawthorne effect}}
This variant of the phenomenon is named for the Hawthorne Works, a factory built by [[Western Electric]], where efficiency engineers in the 1920s and 1930s were trying to determine if improved working conditions such as better lighting improved the performance of production workers.  The engineers noted that when they provided better working conditions in the production line, efficiency increased. But when the engineers returned the production line to its original conditions and observed the workers, their efficiency increased ''again''.  The engineers determined that it was merely the ''observation'' of the factory workers, not the changes in the conditions in production line, that increased the measured efficiency.  The term "[[Hawthorne effect]]" was coined in 1955 by Henry A. Landsberger.  Many researchers believe that the evidence that a Hawthorne effect exists has been exaggerated.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}

[[Image:Cologne Cathedral-imp01.jpg|thumb|The high choir of [[Cologne Cathedral]] (1248&amp;ndash;1322) is considered one of the finest Rayonnant structures of the Middle Ages.]]
In French Gothic architecture, '''Rayonnant''' ({{IPA-fr|ʁɛjɔnɑ̃}}) was the period between c. 1240 and 1350, characterized by a shift in focus away from the [[High Gothic]] mode of utilizing great scale and spatial rationalism (such as with buildings like [[Chartres Cathedral]] or the nave of [[Amiens Cathedral]]) towards a greater concern for two dimensional surfaces and the repetition of decorative motifs at different scales. After the mid-14th century, Rayonnant gradually evolved into the [[International Gothic|Late Gothic]] [[Flamboyant]] style, although the point of transition is not clearly defined.

==Terminology==
The name ''Rayonnant'' derives from the attempts of 19th-century French art historians (notably [[Henri Focillon]] and Ferdinand de Lasteyrie) to classify Gothic styles on the basis of window tracery. Although such efforts are now regarded as mistaken, the resulting terms have to some extent survived (Rayonnant and [[Flamboyant Gothic|Flamboyant]] are still widely used by art historians, though the misleading old term ''Lancet Gothic'' has generally given way to ''High Gothic''). On this basis, Focillon and his colleagues adopted the term ''Rayonnant'' (from the French word meaning "radiating") specifically to describe the radiating spokes of the [[rose windows]] which flourished during this period. (Some sources incorrectly derive the term from the radiating chapels spreading from the [[apse]], but these were not specifically associated with this period and had been a standard feature of Continental architecture since the 11th century on Romanesque buildings like [[Cluny Abbey]] and the [[Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela]])

==Origins and development==
[[Image:Porche.eglise.Saint.Nicaise.Reims.2.png|thumb|left|Reconstructed view of the portal of St Nicaise, Reims]]
Although elements of the new style can be found at the Cistercian abbey church of [[Royaumont]] (begun 1228, now mostly destroyed), perhaps the most important step in the development of the Rayonnant style was the building of the Abbey Church of [[Nicasius of Rheims|St Nicaise]], in [[Reims]] (begun 1231). Although this church was entirely destroyed during the French Revolution, its facade is well known from 18th-century engravings. The architect ([[Hugues Libergier]]) took various existing elements of the Gothic decorative vocabulary and used them to create a very new visual aesthetic. Perhaps the most influential feature of the Church of St Nicaise was its west facade, constructed as a series of pointed gables decorated with [[crockets]] and a mixture of blind and open [[tracery]], interspersed with narrow pinnacles. Unlike earlier Gothic west facades, with their clear three-part horizontal and vertical divisions, Libergier's design was more screen-like (indeed it may have been inspired by earlier [[choir screens]]) and on a far more human scale than the cavernous doorways of [[Reims Cathedral]]. Several key elements of the St Nicaise facade were soon taken up by other architects and can be recognised, for example, in the treatment of the North [[transept]] portal of [[Notre Dame de Paris]] and around the roof line of the [[Sainte Chapelle]].

==General characteristics==
Whilst all phases of [[Gothic architecture]] were concerned to some degree with levels of illumination and the appearance of structural lightness, Rayonnant takes this to the extreme. More of the wall surface than ever before was pierced by windows (see for example the [[Sainte-Chapelle]] in [[Paris]]) and buildings were often given lace-like tracery screens on the exterior to hide the bulk of load bearing wall elements and buttresses (such as at [[Strasbourg Cathedral]] or the [[Church of St Urbain, Troyes]]).

[[Image:Basilique Saint-Urbain Troyes Façade 110208.jpg|thumb|left|Façade of the [[Basilique Saint-Urbain de Troyes|Church of St Urbain, Troyes]], showing the use of gables, pinnacles and open tracery]]
As well as increasing the size of window openings, the Rayonnant period coincided with the development of the band window, in which a central strip of richly coloured stained glass is positioned between upper and lower bands of clear or [[grisaille]] glass, which allowed even more light to flood in.

Although changes in window design are the most oft-cited feature of the Rayonnant style, they were actually just one part of a more fundamental aesthetic shift. The key precursor was a change in the construction of window [[tracery]]; the replacement of old-fashioned ''plate-tracery'' (in which the window openings look as if they have been punched out of a flat stone plate) with the more delicate ''bar-tracery'' (in which the stone elements separating the glazing panels within a window are constructed out of narrow carved mouldings, with rounded inner and outer profiles). Bar-tracery probably made its first appearance in the clerestory windows at [[Reims Cathedral]] and quickly spread across Europe. As well as being a more effective and flexible way of constructing windows, bar tracery also paved the way for the development of blind tracery (decorating an otherwise blank wall) and of open tracery, typically all using the same decorative motifs as the adjoining windows. 
[[Image:Basilica di saint Denis vetrata 06.JPG|thumb|right|Bar tracery and glazed triforium in the nave of St Denis (the windows themselves are 19th-century replacements)]]
The final architectural innovation that emerged as part of the Rayonnant style in France was the use of glazed triforia. Traditionally, the [[triforium]] of an Early or High Gothic cathedral was a dark horizontal band, usually housing a narrow passageway, that separated the top of the arcade from the clerestory. Although it made the interior darker, it was a necessary feature to accommodate the sloping lean-to roofs over the side aisles and chapels. The Rayonnant solution to this, as employed to brilliant effect in the 1230s nave of the [[Abbey Church of St Denis]], was to use double-pitched roofs over the aisles, with hidden gutters to drain off the rain-water. This meant the outer wall of the triforioum passage could now be glazed, and the inner wall reduced to slender bar tracery. Architects also began to emphasise the linkage between triforium and clerestory by extending the central mullions from the windows of the latter in a  continuous moulding running from the top of the windows down through the blind tracery of the triforium to the string course at the top of the arcading.

==Influences==
[[File:Doorscath.jpg|thumb|[[Lala Mustafa Pasha Mosque|Saint Nicholas's Cathedral]], [[Famagusta]]]]
Key elements of the Rayonnant style were incorporated into English architecture with the rebuilding of [[Westminster Abbey]] by [[Henry III of England|King Henry III]], who had been present at the consecration of Louis IX's Ste Chapelle. The resulting mixture of styles at Westminster (a crucial step in the development of English Decorated Gothic) has been characterised by some art historians as "French architecture with an English accent". Rayonnant was also very influential in the Holy Roman Empire, as evidenced by the cathedrals at Strasbourg, Cologne and Prague. In Spain we find the best examples in the [[León Cathedral]] and the [[Burgos cathedral]], this last one quite modified in the time of [[Flamboyant]] Gothic. The style even reached as far as [[Kingdom of Cyprus|Cyprus]] (a French cultural outpost during the Middle Ages) with the most prominent example being [[Lala Mustafa Pasha Mosque|Saint Nicholas's Cathedral]] in [[Famagusta]].

The various decorative elements employed in the Rayonnant style (bar tracery, blind and open tracery, gables and pinnacles) could also be applied on a much smaller scale, both for the micro-architectural fixtures and fittings within a church (tombs, shrines, pulpits, sacrament houses, etc.) and also for small portable objects like reliquaries, liturgical equipment, ivory diptychs, etc. This combination of flexibility and portability may have been a key factor in the dissemination of Rayonnant and its various offshoots across Europe in the late 13th and early 14th centuries.
[[Image:Ivory adoration crucifixion MRR424.jpg|thumb|left|Typically Rayonnant pierced gables and open tracery employed as a micro-architectural framing device in an ivory diptych]]

The transition (in France) from Rayonnant to Flamboyant Gothic was gradual and evolutionary in form, marked primarily by a shift towards new tracery patterns based on S-shaped curves (these curves resemble flickering flames, from which the new style got its name). However, amidst the chaos of the [[Hundred Years War]] and the various other misfortunes experienced by Europe during the 14th century, relatively little large scale construction occurred and certain elements of the Rayonnant style remained in vogue well into the next century.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22621">During the '''[[American Civil War]], sexual behavior and attitudes''', like many other aspects of life, were affected by the conflict. The advent of photography and easier media distribution, for example, allowed for greater access to sexual material for the common soldier.

==In camp==
At camp, "[[barracks favorites]]" were available. These were inexpensive novels of a sexual nature. Photographs of nudity were available as well, and were purchased by both enlisted men and officers. These twelve by fifteen inch pictures cost $1.20 for a dozen, or ten cents for a single picture. These were usually pictures of nude women doing innocent things; nude women that were engaging in actual sexual activity were usually not white, but either black or Native American. With the soldiers being far away from their wives and sweethearts, it is speculated these were used for [[masturbation]], and not just for entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;Abramson p. 180, D'Emilio pp. 131,132&lt;/ref&gt; Only three of the novels are still known to exist; they are located at the [[Kinsey Institute]] of [[Indiana University]] in [[Bloomington, Indiana]].&lt;ref&gt;Lowry p. 56&lt;/ref&gt;

However, this is not to say females were not available for sex. [[Prostitute]]s, as always, were among the [[camp follower]]s following behind marching troops. Popular legend has it that they were so common around the [[Army of the Potomac]] when Union general [[Joseph Hooker]] was in command that the term "hooker" was coined to describe them; however, the term had been in use since 1845. The number of prostitutes around Hooker's division only "cemented" the term.&lt;ref&gt;Davis p. 280, Goldstein p. 342&lt;/ref&gt;

This led to many cases of [[venereal disease]]. Among white Union soldiers there was a total of 73,382 [[syphilis]] cases and 109,397 [[gonorrhea]] cases. The total rate of VD among the white Union troops was 82 cases per 1000 men, where before and after the war the rate was 87 of 1000. Union black troops, however, had rates of 34 per 1000 for syphilis and 44 per 1000 for gonorrhea.&lt;ref&gt;Lowry p. 104&lt;/ref&gt; Cases were most prominent around larger cities like [[Nashville, Tennessee]]; [[New Orleans]]; [[Richmond, Virginia]]; and [[Washington, D.C.]] Numbers for Confederates are unknown, but are assumed less due to Confederate soldiers being less likely to be in cities.&lt;ref&gt;Davis pp. 231, 232&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prostitution==
{{further|Prostitution in the United States#19th century}}
Prostitution experienced its largest growth during 1861–1865. Some historians have speculated that this growth can be attributed to a depression, and the need for women to support themselves and their families while their husbands were away at war. Other historians considered the growth of prostitution to be related to the women wanting to spread [[Sexually transmitted infection|venereal disease]] to the opposing troops.&lt;ref&gt;Clinton p.9&lt;/ref&gt; The term "public women" was coined for the women that became prostitutes. There was moral outrage at this rising employment, and law officials classified the people they arrested as such.&lt;ref&gt;Clinton p.10&lt;/ref&gt; The word "hooker" predates the Civil War, but became popularized due to Union General Joseph Hooker's reputation of consorting with prostitutes.&lt;ref&gt;Clinton p.16&lt;/ref&gt; After the outbreak of war, the number of [[brothel]]s skyrocketed. "In 1864 there were 450 brothels in Washington, and over 75 brothels in nearby [[Alexandria, Virginia]]. A newspaper estimated there were 5000 public women in the District and another 2500 in Alexandria and Georgetown, bringing the total to 7500 by the war's third year".&lt;ref&gt;Clinton p.14&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was the towns located just outside the camps where prostitution was most prominent. These small towns were overrun by the sex trade when army troops set up nearby camps. One soldier wrote home to his wife, "It is said that one house in every ten is a bawdy house{{mdash}}it is a perfect Sodom."&lt;ref&gt;Clinton p.20&lt;/ref&gt;

The most notorious area for prostitution was in [[Tennessee]]. Before the outbreak of the war, Nashville recorded 207 prostitutes; however, in 1863 reports claimed to have at least 1500 prostitutes. The area where these prostitutes could be found was known as Smokey Row.&lt;ref&gt;Clinton p.25&lt;/ref&gt; In an infamous campaign to rid the city of the "public women", Lt. Col. [[George Spalding]] loaded the women on to the steamboat ''Idahoe''. The women were sent to [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]], where they were not allowed off the ship and sent further along to Cincinnati. Many of the women became sick due to lack of food and were forced to turn around and return to Nashville. Once they arrived back in Nashville, Lt. Col. Spaulding created a system of registration similar to European ones. He inadvertently created the first legal system of prostitution.&lt;ref&gt;Clinton pp.25–26d&lt;/ref&gt;
This is the set of regulations he set up:
# That a license be issued to each prostitute, a record of which shall be kept at this office, together with the number and street of her residence.
# That one skillful [[surgeon]] be appointed as a Board of Examination whose duty it shall be to examine personally every week, each licensed prostitute, giving certificate soundness to those who are healthy and ordering into hospital those who are in the slightest degree diseased.
# That a building suitable for a hospital for the invalids be taken for that purpose, and that a weekly tax of fifty cents be levied on each prostitute for the purpose of defraying the expense of said hospital.
# That all public women found plying their vocation without a license and certificate be at once arrested and incarcerated in the workhouse for a period of not less than thirty days.&lt;ref&gt;Clinton pp.27–28&lt;/ref&gt;

Prostitution experienced a large growth and spread across the [[Northern United States|North]] and [[Southern United States|South]], and was one of the few industries to cross enemy lines throughout the duration of the war.

==Female soldiers==
[[File:Sarah Edmonds.jpg|thumb|Sarah Emma Edmonds, ie. Franklin Thompson]]
The number of female soldiers in the War is estimated at between 400 and 750, although an accurate count is impossible because the women had to disguise themselves as men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.civilwar.org/education/history/untold-stories/female-soldiers-in-the-civil.html |title=Female Soldiers in the Civil War |publisher=Civilwar.org |date= 2013-01-25|accessdate=2015-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Union officer was once quoted regarding how a Union sergeant was "in violation of all military law" by giving birth to child, and this was not the only case where the true sex of a soldier was discovered due to childbirth. A captured Confederate officer whose true gender was previously unknown by the guards gave birth in a Union prison camp.&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein p.110&lt;/ref&gt;

The Civil War was generally a time of challenges to traditional gender norms, as women mobilized themselves to participate in the war effort and left the home in droves to serve as charity workers, nurses, clerks, farm labourers, and political activists.&lt;ref&gt;Jessica Ziparo, “Northern Women, the State, and Wartime Mobilization,” in ''Women and the American Civil War'', ed. Judith Giesberg and Randall Miller (Kent, OH: Kent State University Press, 2018), 72-73.&lt;/ref&gt; Across the Confederacy, upper-class women assembled all-female home guard militias, drilling firearms usage and training to protect their plantations, properties, and neighbourhoods from Union invasion. Military training became mandatory at some private girls’ academies.&lt;ref&gt;Anne J. Bailey, “The Defenders: The Nancy Harts,” in ''Confederate Women'', ed. Muriel Phillips Joslyn (Gretna, LA: Pelican, 1996), 45.&lt;/ref&gt; One female militia in LaGrange, Georgia--a uniquely militarily vulnerable city, poised halfway between the industrial powerhouse of Atlanta and the original Confederate capital at Montgomery, Alabama--engaged in diplomatic negotiations with the invading Union army in April 1865, using the threat of violence to obtain a promise that their city would not be ransacked.&lt;ref&gt;Erin Blakemore, “An All-Woman Confederate Militia Guarded Their Georgia Hometown,” ''History'', 25 June 2018, accessed 1 December 2018. &lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.history.com/news/confederate-women-militia-civil-war&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; As concerted a challenge to gender norms as these all-female militias would seem to pose, however, the participants were careful to otherwise keep well within gender norms, and to avoid the impression of usurping male protective roles.&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, “The Defenders,” 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most dramatic and extreme challenge to gender roles, then, came with those women who participated in the Civil War as fully-enlisted combatants. Though not particularly well-known today, it is estimated that there are over 1000 women who enlisted in both the Union and Confederate armies under assumed male identities.&lt;ref&gt;Bonnie Tsui, ''She Went To the Field: Women Soldiers of the Civil War'' (Guildford, CT: TwoDot, 2006), 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The female soldiers were not operating within a vacuum, responding blindly to the stimulus of war. Unlike the members of the all-female militias, the female enlisted soldiers were drawn disproportionately from working- and lower-middle-class backgrounds--and therefore represented a radically different cultural milieu. Mid-nineteenth-century working-class culture, for example, was generally familiar--if not comfortable--with female cross-dressing, with the phenomenon being prominently featured in popular theatrical and literary pieces with mass audiences.&lt;ref&gt;See Fraser Easton, “Gender’s Two Bodies: Women Warriors, Female Husbands, and Plebeian Life,” ''Past and Present'' 180 (August 2003), 131-174.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Sarah Rosetta Wakeman (Pvt. Lyons Wakeman) (7222921452).jpg|thumb|Sarah Rosetta Wakeman, ie. Pvt. Lyons Wakeman of the 153rd New York Volunteer Infantry]]
Women had different motivations for joining the army, just as did their male counterparts. A common reason was to escape pre-arranged marriages. Sarah Edmonds, for example, left her home in maritime Canada and fled to the United States to avoid marriage--but took the ultimate protective step of dressing as a man and enlisting in the Union Army to avoid detection.&lt;ref&gt;See Sarah E. Edmonds, ''Nurse and Spy in the Union Army'' (Hartford, CT: W.S. Williams &amp; Co., 1865).&lt;/ref&gt; Loreta Janeta Velazquez, on the other hand, was driven to enlist by more personal motivations; inspired by the example of Joan of Arc and other historical women warriors, she was idealistic about feminine potential on the battlefield, insisting that,“when women have rushed to the battlefield, they have invariably distinguished themselves.”&lt;ref&gt;Tsui, ''She Went to the Field: Women Soldiers of the Civil War'', 24&lt;/ref&gt; Sarah Rosetta Wakeman had been living as a man long before the outbreak of the war, hoping to find better-paying work on the riverboats of New York rather than as a female domestic servant. She was, therefore, compelled to enlist by an economic imperative; the prospect of steady pay as an enlisted soldier in the Union Army appeared to be preferable to the instability of day labour.&lt;ref&gt;Eggleston, Larry. “Women of the Civil War: Extraordinary Stories of of Soldiers, Spies,  Nurses, Doctors, Crusaders, and Others.” (McFarland, 2015) pgs 12-15&lt;/ref&gt; Whatever the original motivations of the individual female soldiers, however, they ultimately took part in the war on similar terms as their male brothers-in-arms.

The existence of illicit female soldiers was an open secret in both the wartime Union and Confederacy, with stories commonly shared in both soldiers’ letters and newspaper articles.&lt;ref&gt;DeAnne Blanton and Lauren M. Cook, ''They Fought Like Demons: Women Soldiers in the American Civil War'' (Baton Rouge, LA: Louisiana State University Press, 2002), 145-46.&lt;/ref&gt; Awareness trickled out into the general public--and civilians were duly fascinated by these women warriors. This curiosity is reflected in the literature of the period. Wartime romance novels idealised these women as heroines sacrificing themselves for love of country and menfolk, while Frank Moore’s popular 1866 history ''Women and the Civil War: Their Heroism and Their Sacrifice'' prominently featured an entire chapter on the female soldiers of the war.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Moore, ''Women of the War: Their Heroism and Self-Sacrifice'' (Hartford, CT: Scranton &amp; Co., 1866), 529-535.&lt;/ref&gt; Although it establishes the fact that women warriors were clearly objects of curiosity for the American public, Moore significantly softened and romanticised their experiences in order to make them more palatable to a general audience. For instance, Moore refers to one particular female soldier as an “American Joan of Arc”, attempting to frame her wartime exploits within a recognisable paradigm of holy war and divine inspiration.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, ''Women of the War'', 533.&lt;/ref&gt;

Regardless of generally warm popular opinion, however, female soldiers actually faced significant suspicion and opposition from within the armies themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Ziparo, “Northern Women, the State, and Wartime Mobilization,” in Giesberg and Miller, 73.&lt;/ref&gt; Female soldiers were generally successful at physically disguising themselves; their shorter height, higher voices, and lack of facial hair escaped comment in an army heavily dominated by adolescent boys, while their own feminine shapes could be obscured through breast-binding.&lt;ref&gt;Larry G. Eggleston, ''Women in the Civil War: Extraordinary Stories of Soldiers, Spies, Nurses, Doctors, Crusaders, and Others (''Jefferson, NC: McFarland, 2015), 2; Michael Bronski, ''A Queer History of the United States'' (Boston, Beacon Press, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; Recruits deemed to be of ambiguous gender, for example, were often subjected to improvised tests to check their gendered responses. One such test was to toss a soldier an apple; if he held out his shirttails to catch the apple as if in an apron, he would be deemed to be a woman, and would be subject to further investigation.&lt;ref&gt;Eggleston, ''Women in the Civil War,'' 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Female soldiers who were most successful at blending into military life were those who had been presenting as male even before they had enlisted: Sarah Wakeman, for example, had been living as a man and working on canal boats in New York prior to joining the Union army&lt;ref&gt;Adam Gabbatt, “What Trans Soldier Albert Cashier Can Teach Trump About Patriotism,” ''Guardian'' 22 August 1017. Accessed 10 November 2018, &lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/aug/22/donald-trump-transgender-military-ban-albert-cashier&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;, while Jennie Hodgers had likewise assumed a masculine identity long before the outbreak of the war.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Bronski, ''A Queer History of the United States'' (Boston, Beacon Press, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

Women who passed the scrutiny of their fellow soldiers, however, were nonetheless expected to perform to the same standard--and so female soldiers largely blended in with their male fellows-in-arms, performing the same duties with fairly minimal risk of exposure.&lt;ref&gt;Lisa Tendrich Frank, “‘With Hearts Nerved by the Necessity for Prompt Action’: Southern Women, Mobilization, and the Wartime State,” in Giesberg and Miller, 56.&lt;/ref&gt; Those who were caught typically were exposed while wounded and receiving medical care in battlefront hospitals.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Hall, ''Women on the Civil War Battlefront'' (Wichita, KS, University Press of Kansas, 2006), 49.&lt;/ref&gt; Others, however, escaped detection for the entire war, and returned home to resume their normal lives and feminine gender expression--with a few notable exceptions. Female veteran Sarah Edmonds, the runaway Canadian bride, lived under the masculine identity of Franklin Thompson for the rest of her life, and even was granted a pension for her service by Congress in 1886&lt;ref&gt;Blanton and Cook, ''They Fought Like Demons'', 167-68&lt;/ref&gt;, while Jennie Hodgers continued living as Albert Cashier before being discovered and forced back into feminine dress after having been institutionalized for dementia in 1913.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Bronski, ''A Queer History of the United States'' (Boston, Beacon Press, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; The participation of so many women in the Civil War, however, was an uncomfortable subject for the US Army for many decades; the fact of female service was officially denied by the army until well in the twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;Ziparo, “Northern Women, the State, and Wartime Mobilization,” in Giesberg and Miller, 73.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some soldiers engaged in acts of [[Wartime sexual violence|rape]]. The Confederate records were destroyed, but a perusal of only five percent of Federal records reveal that over thirty court martial trials were held due to instances of rape; hanging or firing squad being the usual punishment if convicted.&lt;ref&gt;Lowry p.123&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes, offering money for sex to a white woman of good standing was considered almost tantamount to rape; in the case of an Illinois private at [[Camp Dennison]], for example, the perpetrator spent a month at the guardhouse for offering a mother a dollar and her daughter three dollars for sex. Federal troops who committed rape while invading the southern states mostly took advantage of black rather than white women, and black soldiers were usually punished more severely for the crime than their white counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;Lowry pp.124,131,132&lt;/ref&gt; Even so, the fear of rape was omnipresent among white Southern women facing the prospect of invasion without male protection; although specific numbers of victims are difficult to trace, the threat of sexual violence committed by Union soldiers lingered in Southern cultural memory long after the war ended.&lt;ref&gt;Feimster, Crystal M. "General Benjamin Butler and the Threat of Sexual Violence during the American Civil War." ''Daedalus'' 138, no. 2, 126-127.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Homosexuality==
The term "[[homosexuality]]" was not coined until thirty years after the war ended. However, no army soldiers were disciplined for such activity, although three pairs of Union Navy sailors were punished, all in 1865.&lt;ref&gt;Lowry p.109&lt;/ref&gt;

There was only one case of [[male prostitution]] reported during the war. ''[[The Richmond Dispatch]]'' reported on May 13, 1862, that since the moving of the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]]'s capital to [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]] that "loose males of the most abandoned character from other parts of the Confederacy" had moved to Richmond and "prostitutes of both sexes" openly displayed themselves in carriages and on sidewalks.&lt;ref&gt;Lowry p.110&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1864, a ball was put on by a [[Massachusetts]] regiment stationed in [[Virginia]] featuring young drummer boys dressed as women. One man wrote to his wife that he had slept with one of the "boy-girls."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lgbtqnation.com/2016/10/confederate-union-untold-history-gay-civil-war-soldiers/ Confederate and Union: The untold history of gay Civil War soldiers]&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars have tried to ascertain if certain Civil War figures were homosexual. The most notable of these was Confederate major general [[Patrick Cleburne]], although it is still disputed.&lt;ref&gt;Lowry pp.113,118&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
After the war, many Southern men felt their manhood diminished in a manner some historians dubbed a "crisis of gender"; a crisis exacerbated after Confederate president [[Jefferson Davis]] was apprehended by Union soldiers wearing his wife's shawl for warmth. The false rumor quickly spread in the North that Davis was caught during his escape while dressed as a woman. Period drawings depicting Davis in full women's dress (bonnet included) were used to ridicule the Confederacy's former President.&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein p.275&lt;/ref&gt;

One thing that came from the spread of pornography during the war was the rise of anti-pornography forces; in particular, the [[Comstock laws]].&lt;ref&gt;Abramson p.180&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investigative archaeology==
Over the past decades, Jacobovici has engaged in what he calls "investigative archaeology". His most controversial claim is the identification of a tomb in Jerusalem as that of [[Jesus of Nazareth]] and his family. The tomb was discovered in the [[Talpiot]] neighbourhood.&lt;ref name=tombofjesus&gt;{{cite web| url=http://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1593893,00.html| title=Is This Jesus's Tomb? - TIME| last= Van Biema| first= David| work=[[TIME Magazine]]|date=February 26, 2007|accessdate=November 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, he investigated a Second Temple-era burial cave in [[Armon Hanatziv]] with a robotic arm that had a camera. He believes the cave may be the burial site of disciples of Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/naked-archaeologist-finds-signs-jerusalem-cave-was-used-to-bury-jesus-disciples-1.415231|title='Naked Archaeologist' Finds Signs Jerusalem Cave Was Used to Bury Jesus' Disciples|first=Nir|last=Hasson|date=28 February 2012|publisher=|via=Haaretz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jacobovici hosted three seasons of ''[[The Naked Archaeologist]]'' on [[VisionTV]] in Canada&lt;ref name=newswire&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.newswire.ca/en/story/703941/associated-producers-acclaimed-documentary-series-the-naked-archaeologist-returns-for-a-third-season-on-vision-tv-monday-march-22| title=VISIONTV - Associated Producers' acclaimed documentary series The Naked Archaeologist returns for a third season on Vision TV, Monday March 22|  work=CNW Group|date=March 10, 2010|accessdate=November 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=apnaked&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.apltd.ca/films/display/16| title=The Naked Archaeologist (Season 3) - Associated Producers Ltd.|  work=Associated Producers Ltd.|accessdate=November 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[History (U.S. TV channel)|The History Channel]] in the United States. In 2013, the series began to be broadcast on the Israel Broadcast Authority (IBA) Channel 1.

Jacobovici has written for ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[International Herald Tribune]]'', ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' and other newspapers. He blogs on ''SimchaJTV'',&lt;ref name=simchajtv&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.simchajtv.com/| title=SimchaJTV|  work=SimchaJTV|accessdate=November 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Times of Israel]]''&lt;ref name=timesblog&gt;{{cite web| url=http://blogs.timesofisrael.com/author/simcha-jacobovici/| title=Simcha Jacobovici - Ops &amp; Blogs - The Times of Israel|  work=[[The Times of Israel]]|accessdate=November 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The Huffington Post]]''.&lt;ref name=huffblog&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/simcha-jacobovici/| title=Simcha Jacobovici|  work=TheHuffingtonPost.com, Inc.|accessdate=December 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;   He occasionally writes for the Jerusalem Post.
 
He has been interviewed on numerous television shows like ''[[Anderson Cooper 360]]'', ''[[Larry King Live]]'',''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'', ''[[NBC Today Show]]'' and ''[[ABC Nightline]]''.

His new book with Professor [[Barrie Wilson]], ''The Lost Gospel: Decoding the Ancient Text That Reveals Jesus' Marriage to Mary the Magdalene'', was published in November 2014 (Pegasus in the US and [[HarperCollins]] in Canada).

== Selected documentaries and television programs ==
=== ''Falasha: Exile of the Black Jews'' ===
In the 1983 documentary ''Falasha: Exile of the Black Jews'', Jacobovici tells the story of [[Beta Israel|Ethiopian Jews]], also called Falasha (strangers) and properly known as ''Beta Israel''. According to the documentary, the group was conquered by neighbouring tribes in the 17th century and suffered persecution.

After the documentary, during the Israeli [[Operation Moses]] ({{lang-he-n|מִבְצָע מֹשֶׁה}}, ''Mivtza Moshe''), the Falasha were evacuated from [[Sudan]] during a famine in 1984 and airlifted to Israel.

=== ''Expulsion &amp; Memory: Descendants of the Hidden Jews'' ===
In the 1996 documentary, Jacobovici studies the [[Crypto-Judaism|Crypto-Jews]] of [[New Mexico]] and tiny populations of Jewish descendants in [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]], known as ''nuevos Cristianos'' ("new Christians"). He explores the Jewish ancestry of the New Mexican Hispanic families now living in New Mexico and finds that many of them have always been aware of their Jewish heritage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishfilm.org/Catalogue/films/expulsion.htm |title=Expulsion and Memory: Descendants of the Hidden Jews |publisher=Jewishfilm.org |date= |accessdate=2012-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Struma''===
In the 2002 documentary, directed by Jacobovici, tells the story of {{MV|Struma}}, a small ship chartered to carry [[Jewish]] refugees from [[Axis powers|Axis]]-allied [[Romania]] to [[Mandatory Palestine]] during [[World War II]]. Ten people were let off the ship in [[Istanbul]], including a woman who had just had a miscarriage,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/24/world/middleeast/david-stoliar-survivor-of-world-war-ii-disaster-dies-at-91.html|title=David Stoliar, Survivor of World War II Disaster, Dies at 91|first=Robert D.|last=McFadden|date=1 November 2017|publisher=|via=www.nytimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and one man who was the representative of the [[Mobil Oil]] Company in Romania and was helped by Mobil's representative in [[Turkey]], [[Vehbi Koc]].{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} Koc asked the favour of the Istanbul Chief of Police, [[Sabri Caglayangil]], who later became a Minister of the Interior. On February 23, 1942, with her engine inoperable and her refugee passengers aboard, Turkish authorities towed ''Struma'' from Istanbul Harbour through the [[Bosphorus]] back to the [[Black Sea]],&lt;ref name=Aroni&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.jewishgen.org/databases/holocaust/0140_Struma.html#P9 |last=Aroni |first=Samuel |title=Who Perished On The Struma And How Many? |year=2002–2007 |publisher=JewishGen.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; where they set her adrift without food, water or fuel. Within hours, on the morning of February 24, she was [[struma disaster|torpedoed and sunk]] by the {{Ship|Soviet submarine|Shch-213||2|up=yes}}, killing at least 768 men, women and children and possibly as many as 791, 785 of whom were Jews.&lt;ref name=Aroni/&gt;

The documentary won the Audience Award at the [[Portland International Film Festival]] for best documentary.

=== ''Quest for the Lost Tribes'' ===
In the 2003 wide-ranging documentary, Jacobovici goes on a worldwide search for the [[Ten Lost Tribes of Israel]] and states that there are actually only nine since the remnant of the [[tribe of Dan]] was confirmed{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} to be the Beta Israel of Ethiopia. Travelling from western [[Europe]] to [[China]] and [[India]], Jacobovici finds tantalizing evidence that the "lost tribes" are, like the tribe of Dan, not really lost. The tribe of Dan is the only original tribe of Israel not to be included in the [[Book of Revelation]]'s list of tribes that are sealed. No mention is made of why it is excluded.

=== ''Impact of Terror'' ===
The 2004 documentary, produced by Jacobovici and directed by [[Tim Wolochatiuk]], is about Israeli victims of terrorism struggling to cope in the aftermath of the August 2001 [[Sbarro restaurant suicide bombing]] in [[Jerusalem]].

=== ''[[The Exodus Decoded]]'' ===
The 2006 [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]] documentary was created by Jacobovici and the producer/director [[James Cameron]]. It explores evidence for the [[biblical]] account of [[the Exodus]]. Its claims and methods were widely criticized by Biblical scholars and by mainstream scientists.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblearchaeology.org/post/2006/09/debunking-the-exodus-decoded.aspx|title=Debunking "The Exodus Decoded"|first=Bryant G. Wood|last=PhD|website=www.biblearchaeology.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heardworld.com/higgaion/?page_id=119 Higgaion » Exodus Decoded&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bib-arch.org/bswbOOexodusbeware.html |title=Biblical Archaeology Society |accessdate=2011-08-15 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070502122212/http://www.bib-arch.org/bswbOOexodusbeware.html |archivedate=May 2, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bib-arch.org/bswbOOexodus.html |title=Biblical Archaeology Society |accessdate=2011-03-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070528054314/http://www.bib-arch.org/bswbOOexodus.html |archivedate=May 28, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jacobovici suggests that the Exodus took place around 1500 BC, during the reign of Pharaoh [[Ahmose I]], and that it coincided with the [[Minoan eruption]]. In the documentary, the biblical [[plagues of Egypt]] are explained as having resulted from that eruption and a related [[limnic eruption]] in the [[Nile Delta]]. While much of Jacobovici's archaeological evidence for the Exodus comes from Egypt, some comes from [[Mycenae]] on Mainland Greece, such as a gold ornament that somewhat resembles the [[Ark of the Covenant]].

The documentary makes extensive use of computer animation and visual effects made by Gravity Visual Effects, Inc. It runs for 90 min and was first aired in [[Canada]] on April 16 ([[Easter Day]]), 2006 (''[[Discovery Channel (Canada)|Discovery Channel Canada]]''). It was shown in the [[United States]] on August 20, 2006 (''[[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel US]]''), [[United Kingdom|UK]] on December 23, 2006 (''[[Discovery Channel (UK and Ireland)|Discovery Channel UK]]'') and [[Spain]] on December 25, 2006 ([[Cuatro (channel)|Cuatro]]).

=== ''[[The Lost Tomb of Jesus]]'' ===
The documentary was co-produced and first broadcast on the [[Discovery Channel]] and [[Vision TV]] in Canada on March 4, 2007, covering the discovery of the [[Talpiot Tomb]]. It was directed by Jacobovici and produced by Felix Golubev and [[Ric Esther Bienstock]], and [[James Cameron]] served as executive producer. It was released in conjunction with a book on the same subject, ''[[The Jesus Family Tomb]]'', issued in late February 2007 and co-authored by Jacobovici and [[Charles R. Pellegrino]]. The documentary and book has claims that are disputed by most [[archaeologists]] and [[theologians]] fields as well as most linguistic and biblical scholars.

=== ''[[The Naked Archaeologist]]'' ===
The television show was produced for [[VisionTV]] in Canada and [[History International]] in the US and was hosted and prepared by Jacobovici and [[Avri Gilad]]. The show ultimately reviewed biblical stories and then tried to find proof for them by exploring the [[Holy Land]] looking for archaeological evidence, making personal inferences and deductions and interviewing scholars and experts. After its original run on [[VisionTV]], it was picked up in the U.S. by [[History (U.S. TV channel)|The History Channel]] and its sister network, [[History International]].

The episode "A Nabatean by Any Other Name" won the Special Jury Prize at the 8th International Archaeological Film Festival in [[Brussels]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kineon.be/Palmares-2009.html|title=List of Award Winners, 2009 Festival International du Film Archaeologique de Bruxelles|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Finding Atlantis'' ===
Jacobovici was involved as executive producer&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apltd.ca/films/display/57 Finding Atlantis - Apltd.]&lt;/ref&gt; in the production of a documentary that was shown in March 2010 on the [[National Geographic Channel]]. He claimed that [[Atlantis]] had been found in Spain, and he said that evidence found by [[University of Hartford]] Professor Richard Freund included the unearthed emblem of Atlantis and that "[[Tarshish]] is Atlantis itself".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hartman|first=Ben|title=The deepest Jewish encampment?|url=http://www.jpost.com/JewishWorld/JewishNews/Article.aspx?id=212935|accessdate=22 March 2011|newspaper=[[The Jerusalem Post]]|date=20 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Atlantis Rising'' ===
In 2016, Jacobovici directed a documentary on Atlantis for National Geographic Channel; its executive producer was James Cameron. Shot in several places in the [[Mediterranean]] ([[Greece]], [[Sardinia]], [[Malta]], [[Santorini]]) such as in Spain ([[Cádiz]], [[Huelva]], [[Sevilla]], [[Jaén, Spain|Jaén]], [[Ciudad Real]], [[Badajoz]] and other undersea places in the [[Gulf of Cádiz]]) and the [[Azores]]. It premiered on January 29, 2017 on National Geographic Channel (US)&lt;ref&gt;https://www.natgeotvpressroom.com/articles/show/587fc611fb8ca7dd374f3bc0&lt;/ref&gt; and at National Geographic Spain as "El Resurgir de la Atlántida" on March 5, 2017&lt;ref&gt;[https://twitter.com/NatGeoEspana/status/838249222675681280 National Geographic España: James Cameron es el productor de 'El Resurgir de la Atlantida', estreno esta tarde en NatGeo]&lt;/ref&gt;.

[[File:Walk-of-fame-joe-edwards.jpg|thumb|Chuck Berry's star in the St. Louis Walk of Fame]]
The '''St. Louis Walk of Fame''' honors [[List of people from St. Louis|notable people from St. Louis]], [[Missouri]], who made contributions to the [[culture of the United States]]. All inductees were either born in the [[Greater St. Louis]] area or spent their formative or creative years there.&lt;ref name="crit"&gt;{{cite web| author = Staff | url=http://www.stlouiswalkoffame.org/criteria/ |title=Nomination Criteria |publisher=St. Louis Walk of Fame |date= n.d. |accessdate= August 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contribution can be in any area; most of the current inductees made their achievements in acting, entertainment, music, sports, art/architecture, broadcasting, journalism, science/education and literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author = Database | date= n.d. | url= http://www.stlouiswalkoffame.org/inductees/?view=achievement |title= St. Louis Walk of Fame Inductees |publisher=St. Louis Walk of Fame | accessdate = August 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{as of|2017|6}}, the walk consisted of 147&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stlouiswalkoffame.org/inductees/|title=St. Louis Walk of Fame - Inductees|website=www.stlouiswalkoffame.org|access-date=2017-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; brass stars and bronze plaques, each containing an inductee's name and a summary of his or her accomplishments. The stars and plaques are set into the sidewalks of [[Delmar Boulevard (St. Louis)|Delmar Boulevard]] in the [[Delmar Loop]] area, which is mostly in [[University City, Missouri|University City]], Missouri, an inner-ring suburb of St. Louis. The walk is about five miles (eight kilometers) west of the indoor [[Gateway Classic Walk of Fame]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://explorestlouis.com/visit-explore/member?mid=1012&amp;c=43&amp;member=Gateway%20Classic%20Walk%20of%20Fame |title=Gateway Classic Walk of Fame : St. Louis, MO |publisher=ExploreStLouis.com |date= |accessdate= March 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; a recognition given by another organization, though some, including [[Dick Gregory]], [[Jackie Joyner-Kersee]], and [[Ozzie Smith]], have received hall of fame recognition from both St. Louis groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Dead link|date=November 2010|bot=H3llBot}} {{cite web|url=http://www.gatewayclassic.org/fot.html |title=:: St. Louis Gateway Classic :: |publisher=Gatewayclassic.org |date= |accessdate= March 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://explorestlouis.com/media-page/news-releases-newsroom/releases/multicultural-st-louis/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111112075409/http://explorestlouis.com/media-page/news-releases-newsroom/releases/multicultural-st-louis/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=November 12, 2011 |title=Multicultural St. Louis |publisher=ExploreStLouis.com |date= January 28, 2008 |accessdate= March 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Selection process==
Anyone can submit a nomination by mail by supplying basic identification information as well as a description of the nominee's accomplishments and connection to St. Louis.&lt;ref name="crit"/&gt;&lt;ref name="commerce"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stlcommercemagazine.com/archives/june2007/famous.html|title=Famous Folks – St. Louis History 101|date=June 2007|publisher=stlcommercemagazine.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080703233624/http://www.stlcommercemagazine.com/archives/june2007/famous.html|archive-date=2008-07-03|dead-url=yes|author=Caba, Susan|accessdate=August 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 30 to 40 finalists are culled from the nominees by the walk's founder and director; the finalists are sent to a selection committee of 120 St. Louisans. The selection committee has been variously described as
* "the chancellors of all area universities, key people from local libraries, arts organizations and historical societies, media journalists, and other citizens with an informed understanding of St. Louis' cultural heritage.".;&lt;ref name="crit"/&gt; or
* "university chancellors, previous inductees and representatives of arts organizations, historical societies and libraries"&lt;ref name="commerce"/&gt;

Prior to 2007, the open-air induction ceremony was always been held the third week of May, though more recently it has depended on the availability of the latest inductees.&lt;ref name="commerce"/&gt;

==History==
The walk was founded by developer [[Joe Edwards (St. Louis)|Joe Edwards]], owner of [[Blueberry Hill (restaurant)|Blueberry Hill]] pub/restaurant and other establishments located along the walk. Its first stars and plaques were installed in 1989; the inductees that year were musician [[Chuck Berry]], dancer and choreographer [[Katherine Dunham]], bridge builder [[James B. Eads]], poet [[T. S. Eliot]], ragtime composer [[Scott Joplin]], aviator [[Charles Lindbergh]], baseball player [[Stan Musial]], actor [[Vincent Price]], newspaper publisher [[Joseph Pulitzer]] and playwright [[Tennessee Williams]].&lt;ref&gt;{{dead link|date=March 2010}} [http://www.explorestlouis.com/media/factSheets/fact_walkOfFame.asp]. ExploreStLouis.com.&lt;/ref&gt; Ten more were selected for each of the next four years (in order to get the walk established), but starting in 1994 no more than three have been awarded in any year.&lt;ref name="commerce"/&gt;

In May 2008, [[Cedric the Entertainer]] received the first star and plaque located in the City of St. Louis portion of the loop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Johnson |first=Kevin C. |url=http://www.stltoday.com/blogzone/the-blender/the-blender/2008/05/st-louis-walk-of-fame-welcomes-cedric-the-entertainer/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20080803002009/http://www.stltoday.com/blogzone/the-blender/the-blender/2008/05/st-louis-walk-of-fame-welcomes-cedric-the-entertainer/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=August 3, 2008 |title=St. Louis Walk of Fame Welcomes Cedric the Entertainer |publisher=''The Blender'' (blog of the ''[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]]'') |date=May 30, 2008 |accessdate=August 22, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The walk (and the boundaries of the Delmar Loop in general) has been expanded eastward by Edwards in recent years as Edwards continues to invest in the area's redevelopment.&lt;ref name="commerce"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24301">A '''student publication''' is a media outlet such as a [[newspaper]], [[magazine]], [[television show]], or [[radio station]] produced by students at an educational institution. These publications typically cover local and school related news, but they may also report on national or international news as well. Most student publications are either part of a curricular class or run as an extracurricular activity.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hapney|first=Terry|date=May 10, 2013|title=Student Newspapers at Public Colleges and Universities: Lessons from the United States|url=|journal=Marshall University|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Student publications serve as both a platform for community discussion and a place for those interested in journalism to develop their skills. These publications report news, publish opinions of students and faculty, and may run advertisements catered to the student body. Besides these purposes, student publications also serve as a watchdog to uncover problems at the school. The majority of student publications are funded through their educational institution. Some funds may be generated through sales and advertisements, but the majority usually comes from the school itself. Because of this, educational institutions have specific way in which they can influence the publications through funding.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Online student publications ==

Due to the rise in adoption of Internet accessible devices such as computers and smartphones, many high schools and colleges have begun offering online editions of their publications in addition to printed copies.  (The very first student newspaper in the United States to completely abandon its printed issues in favor of a website was [[Eastern Connecticut State University#The Campus Lantern student newspaper|''The Campus Lantern'']] at [[Eastern Connecticut State University]], doing so in the 2000s; however paper issues of The Lantern have since been brought back.) Due to publishing content online student publications are now able to reach a much wider audience than before. With many student publications moving to online, content is more accessible to the student body and production of the content is easier and cheaper.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Buckingham|first=David|last2=Harvey|first2=Issy|last3=Sefton-Green|first3=Julian|date=1999-12-01|title=The Difference is Digital? Digital Technology and Student Media Production|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/135485659900500402|journal=Convergence|language=en|volume=5|issue=4|pages=10–20|doi=10.1177/135485659900500402|issn=1354-8565}}&lt;/ref&gt; As printed student publications become more and more scarce and student publications move online to best fit the news needs of today's students, student newspapers will run into several issues. One of these issues is the increase in demand for new content. While an update once a day or even once a week was once acceptable for a student publication, real time information resources will soon be demanded by students who grew up with constant updates of news coverage. This shift in content demand will require more effort and more time by the student newspaper staff.

One of these issues is what is called the "daily me." Coined by [[Cass Sunstein]] in his book ''Republic.com,'' the "daily me" is the current trend of online readers looking for personalized information providers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Republic.com|last=Sunstein|first=Cass|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2002|isbn=0691070253|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this way the reader deals with only the subjects they wish to deal with. In this way readers are not inconvenienced by material they have no interest in and can personalize an information product themselves, providing added value to both themselves and the provider. However, some believe this trend may not be the best for society, who is now faced with a public that chooses how well to be informed. On a campus paper, this trend will likely manifest itself in the increased number of "hits" to the common "sports" and "opinion" sections of the paper, while hard news sections go un-noticed. This new type of print culture could possibly result in drastic formatting and content changes for student newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/7014.html|title=Republic.com|last=Sunstein|first=Cass|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|year=2001|isbn=9780691070254|edition=Cloth|authorlink=Cass Sunstein|accessdate=13 May 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511000855/http://press.princeton.edu/titles/7014.html|archivedate=11 May 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 2006 cartoon controversies ==

{{main|Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy}}
''[[Gair rhydd]]'', the student paper at [[Cardiff University]], courted controversy when, on February 4, 2006, it reproduced the cartoons, originally printed in ''[[Jyllands-Posten]]'', depicting [[Muhammad]]. The issue was withdrawn from publication within a day of being released, the editor and two other student journalists were suspended, and a public apology was published in the next issue.

In the same month, two editors of the ''[[Daily Illini]]'', the independent student newspaper of the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]], were suspended after deciding to publish six of the twelve cartoons.

However, student publications took a lead role in reprinting the Muhammad cartoons, often accompanying them with explanatory [[editorials]]. No fewer than 16 student newspapers and magazines in the United States, and a handful in other countries, ran one or more of the caricatures.

==Student press in Australia==
{{See also|List of student newspapers in Australia}}

University student newspapers in the Australia are usually independent of university administration yet are connected with or run by the student representative organisation operating at the campus. Editors tend to be elected by the student body on a separate ticket to other student representatives and are paid an honorarium, although some student organisations have been known to employ unelected staff to coordinate the production of the newspaper (an example of this is the national ''Student View'' newspaper).

===Controversy surrounding Australian student press===
Australian student newspapers have courted controversy since their inception. One of the more notorious of these controversies involved the publication of an article which allegedly incited readers to shoplift. The July edition of the magazine was banned by the Office of Film and Literature Classication following a campaign by conservative talkback radio hosts and other media to have the material banned. The four editors of the July 1995 edition of [[La Trobe University]] student magazine [[Rabelais Student Media|''Rabelais'']] were subsequently charged with publishing, distributing and depositing an objectionable publication. An objectional publication was defined in this case, as one that incites criminal activity.&lt;ref&gt;Haddad, Nadya. "Rabble-rousing and ''Rabelais'': fear of lawless shoplifting students" (1998) 8(2) ''Polemic'', 32 at 33.&lt;/ref&gt; The editors lodged an appeal, which led to a protracted four-year court case. The appeal was eventually defeated by the full bench of the [[Federal Court of Australia|Federal Court]], who refused the editors application to appeal to the [[High Court of Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Federal Court of Australia]], Annual report 1997–1998, Chapter 2, The Work of the Court, 2.2 Decisions of Interest&lt;/ref&gt; The charges were eventually dropped in March 1999.

==Student press in Canada==
{{See also|List of student newspapers in Canada}}
Many student newspapers in Canada are independent from their universities and student unions. Such autonomous papers are funded by student fees won by referendums, as well as advertising, and are run by their staffs, with no faculty input.

About 55 of Canada's student newspapers belong to a co-operative and [[newswire]] service called the [[Canadian University Press]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://j-source.ca/article/student-newspapers-launch-alternative-newswire-canadian-university-press|title=Student newspapers launch alternative newswire to Canadian University Press - JSource|author=|date=17 September 2013|website=j-source.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; which holds conferences, has correspondents across the country, is run democratically by its member papers, and fosters a sense of community among Canadian student journalists.

The oldest continually published student newspapers in Canada are ''[[The Varsity (newspaper)|The Varsity]]'' (1880), ''[[The Queen's Journal]]'' (1873), and ''[[The Dalhousie Gazette]]'' (1868). The oldest student publication in Canada is ''[[The Brunswickan]]'', which was founded in 1867 as a monthly but then switched to a weekly newspaper.

The only Canadian student newspaper that continues to print on a daily schedule is [[The UWO Gazette|''The Gazette]]'' at the University of Western Ontario.

==Student press in Ireland==
Student publications are produced at Ireland's universities and Institutes of Technology as well as to a lesser extent at Colleges of Further Education. These publications include ''[[College Tribune|The College Tribune]]'' and ''[[The University Observer]]'' at [[University College Dublin]], ''[[Trinity News]]'' and ''[[The University Times]]'' at [[Trinity College Dublin]], ''[[The College View]]'' based at [[Dublin City University]] and ''[[Sin Newspaper]]'' at [[NUI Galway]]. Other publications include ''The Edition'' (stylised as the eDITion),  at [[Dublin Institute of Technology]] and the ''UCC Express'' and ''Motley Magazine'' at [[University College Cork]].

Each publication reports on affairs at its host university as well as on local, national and international news of relevance to students and many student journalists have gone on to work in Ireland's national press. All student publications in Ireland are funded by or linked to their host university or its students' union, with the exception of UCD's ''College Tribune'' which operates independently. Irish student publications are invited each year to enter the national Student Media Awards, run by a Dublin-based marketing firm ''Oxygen.ie'' under various categories.

==Student press in Korea==
Almost every university in Korea runs a student based press. Although many of these press are funded by the school, the students press has a significant amount of say amongst the student body.

==Student press in the Philippines==
The College Editorial Guild of the Philippines or (CEGP)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=History of CEGP |url=http://www.cegp.org/?page_id=34 |publisher=College Editors' Guild of the Philippines |accessdate=26 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the oldest and broadest intercollegiate alliance of student publications in the Asia-Pacific. Since its foundation, the Guild has remained steadfast in its commitment to uphold freedom of expression, press freedom and students' democratic rights. This dedication is what continues to unite and consolidate CEGP's more than 750 member publications from different schools nationwide or worldwide.

==Student press in the United Kingdom==
{{See also|List of student newspapers in the United Kingdom}}

Student newspapers in the UK are often given a constitutionally guaranteed [[editorial independence]] from the universities and [[Students' union|student unions]] whose students they represent, although the majority are financially dependent on their Students' Union. The most successful (in terms of student media awards) include: Orbital Magazine (Royal Holloway, University of London),[https://web.archive.org/web/20130223234939/http://theknowledgeplymouth.co.uk/ The Knowledge] ([[University of Plymouth]]), ''[[Nouse]]'' ([[University of York]]), ''[[York Vision]]'' ([[University of York]]), ''[[Impact (student magazine)|Impact]]'' ([[University of Nottingham]]), [[The Epinal]] ([[Loughborough University]]), ''[[Felix (newspaper)|Felix]]'' ([[Imperial College]]), ''[[Cherwell (newspaper)|Cherwell]]'', ''[[The Oxford Student]]'' ([[University of Oxford]]), ''The Badger'' ([[University of Sussex]]), ''[[gair rhydd]]'' ([[Cardiff University]]), ''[[The Beaver]]'' ([[London School of Economics]]), ''[[Glasgow University Guardian]]'' ([[Glasgow University]]), ''[[The Boar]]'' ([[University of Warwick]]), ''[[Leeds Student]]'' ([[University of Leeds]]), ''[[Student (newspaper)|Student]]'' ([[University of Edinburgh]]), ''[[Forge Press]]'' ([[University of Sheffield]]), ''[[The Courier (Newcastle University)|The Courier]]'' ([[Newcastle University|University of Newcastle]]), ''[[The Saint (UK newspaper)|The Saint]]'' ([[University of St Andrews]]), ''[[Varsity (Cambridge)|Varsity]]'', ''[[The Cambridge Student]]'', ''[[The Tab]]'' ([[University of Cambridge]]), ''[[Epigram (newspaper)|Epigram]]'' ([[University of Bristol]]), ''[[The Ripple (newspaper)]]'' ([[University of Leicester]]), ''[[Exeposé]]'' ([[University of Exeter]]) ''[[Spark (University of Reading Newspaper)|Spark*]]'' ([[University of Reading]]), The ''[[Gaudie]]'' ([[University of Aberdeen]])and LeNurb ([[Brunel University]]). Examples of British student newspapers that are financially as well as editorially independent from their respective student unions are ''Cherwell'', ''Varsity'', ''[[The Tab]]'', ''The Saint'', [http://www.theepinal.co.uk The Epinal], ''[[The Linc (newspaper)|The Linc]]'' ([[University of Lincoln]]), ''[[Palatinate (newspaper)|Palatinate]]'' ([[Durham University]]), ''[[The Founder (newspaper)|The Founder]]'' ([[Royal Holloway]]) ''[[Milk Magazine]]'' ([[Bath Spa University]]), ''[[The Gown]]'' ([[Queen's University, Belfast]]) and ''[[The Manchester Magazine]]'' ([[University of Manchester]]). Since they are not part of their Students' Union at all, their independence is given a stronger guarantee than other papers who rely on their unions for funding and consequently cover stories with that in mind.

In 2003, ''[[The National Student]]'', the UK's first independent national student newspaper was launched. ''[[Scotcampus]]'' a similar publication based in Scotland was founded in 2001. In 2009, ''[[The Student Journals]]'' was founded as an independent online magazine for students, but started allowing international writers one year after launch.

===Case law===

====''Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District''====
{{main|Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District}}
''Tinker v. Des Moines'' concerns a group of students who wanted to wear black armbands to school in 1965 to protest [[Vietnam War|United States involvement]] in [[Vietnam]]. After school officials heard about the planned silent protest, they suspended the students involved. A few of the students involved sued and the [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] sided with the students, saying that provided that these speech acts did not distract themselves or others from academic work, the real purpose of the school, then students were free to wear and say want they liked in school. This is considered the benchmark case in issues of student free speech and contains the famous phrase "students do not shed their constitutional rights at the schoolhouse gate."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.aclu.org/free-speech/tinker-v-des-moines-393-us-503-1969 ''Tinker v. Des Moines''] at ACLU.org&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Hazelwood School District v. Kuhlmeier''====
{{main|Hazelwood School District v. Kuhlmeier}}
''Hazelwood School District v. Kuhlmeier'', heard by the United States Supreme Court in 1987 concerned a public school newspaper that attempted to print two controversial stories about issues of teen pregnancy and divorced families. It was the custom of the principal to look over the proposed paper before publication. With little time left before the publication deadline, the principal decided that the two stories, though names had been changed to protect the stories' subjects, were inappropriate for the paper's younger readers; under direction of the principal, the paper was printed without the offending stories. The students filed suit, but the Supreme Court stood by the principal's ruling, that, because of time constraints, the only proper course of action was to not print the stories. It was decided that the students' [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] rights had not been infringed. This case is often cited by high schools and universities to support the custom of prior review.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bc.edu/bc_org/avp/cas/comm/free_speech/hazelwood.html ''Hazelwood School District v. Kuhlmeier''], ''Freedom of Speech in the United States'', BC.edu&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Kincaid v. Gibson''====

====Interaction of court rulings====
''Hazelwood'' and ''Tinker'' offer conflicting versions of student free expression. Student-directed publications may indeed be considered open or limited [[Forum (legal)|public forums]] for student expression, offering students freedom of expression under both ''Hazelwood'' and ''Tinker''.

''Hazelwood'', for example, does not say administrators must review or [[censorship|censor]] their papers before publication. In fact, journalism education organizations, like the [[Journalism Education Association]], argue that prior review has no legitimate educational merit and is only a tool leading to censorship.

Under certain limited conditions and situations presented by ''Hazelwood'', school administrators may be permitted prior review of (mostly high school) student publications.

Until June 2005, the ''Hazelwood'' standard was not considered to apply to public college and university newspapers, a decision most recently affirmed in the 2001 appeals court decision in ''[[Kincaid v. Gibson]]''. However, in June 2005, the [[7th Circuit Court of Appeals]] ruled, in ''[[Hosty v. Carter]]'', that the ''Hazelwood'' standard could apply to student publications that were not "designated public forums," and in February 2006 the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] declined to hear the students' appeal. At this time, the ''Hosty'' decision applies only in the states of [[Illinois]], [[Indiana]] and [[Wisconsin]].

In response to the Kincaid decision, the [[California State Legislature]] passed [[AB 2581]], which extended existing state-level statutory protection of high school student journalists to college and university students.&lt;ref&gt;[http://customfiles.jacconline.org/pdf/AB2581.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070701192100/http://customfiles.jacconline.org/pdf/AB2581.pdf |date=July 1, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill was signed into law by Governor [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] and took effect on January 1, 2007.

Controversy over alleged censorship actions has led some student newspapers to become independent organizations, such as ''[[The Exponent]]'' of [[Purdue University]] in 1969, ''[[The Daily Californian]]'' of the [[University of California, Berkeley]] in 1971, ''[[The Daily Orange]]'' of [[Syracuse University]] in 1971, ''[[The Independent Florida Alligator]]'' of the [[University of Florida]] in 1973, ''[[The Cavalier Daily]]'' of the [[University of Virginia]] in 1979, ''[[The Paisano]]'' of the [[University of Texas at San Antonio]] in 1981, and most recently{{when|date=November 2011}} ''[[The Mountaineer Jeffersonian]]'' of [[West Virginia University]] in 2008.

Some states have laws which enhance the [[U.S. Constitution]] in protecting student expression documented by the [[Student Press Law Center]].

====John Silber and university newspapers====
University administrations have learned to get around constitutional protections and effectively diminish critical student newspapers by following the example of former [[Boston University]] President [[John Silber]], who on the advice of [[Harvard Law School]] Professor [[Alan Dershowitz]], eliminated all funding for student newspapers in the 1970s in an attempt to suppress on-campus criticism. Silber's policy went so far as to ban student organizations funded by the university from placing advertisements in the student press. With his hands-off policy, Silber was able to eliminate the independence of ''The Daily News'' and financially crippled the more-radical 
''[[B.U. Exposure|b.u. exposure]]''. The ''exposure'' sued Silber and the university for infringement of their [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] rights, but the courts of the Commonwealth of [[Massachusetts]] eventually dismissed their case.

===Issues of diversity in student newspapers===
Studies by the ''Journal of Blacks in Higher Education'' (JBHE) focusing on [[African American]] students have found that as few as 2.6% of editors of all student newspapers are of African-American descent, with other minorities showing similar trending. These numbers are not much higher at schools with credited journalism schools. In these institutions, only 4.4% of editors are of African American descent. Both of these percentages are significantly below the percentage of population African- Americans make up in the total United States. Such skewed demographics in these publications could result in newspapers that only reflect the outlooks and values of a particular segment of the student population. The JBHE does not suggest any type of [[Affirmative action in the United States|affirmative action]] program for student publications at this point in time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=4133740|title=Almost No Black Editors on the Staffs of Student Newspapers at Universities with Programs in Journalism|author=|date=23 May 2018|publisher=|journal=The Journal of Blacks in Higher Education|issue=44|pages=59–59|doi=10.2307/4133740}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It spent 28 weeks on ''[[The New York Times]]'' [[The New York Times best seller list|best-seller list]], and was the basis for a 2015 [[The Big Short (film)|film of the same name]].

==Summary==
''The Big Short'' describes several of the main players in the creation of the [[credit default swap]] market that sought to bet against the [[collateralized debt obligation]] (CDO) [[economic bubble|bubble]] and thus ended up profiting from the [[financial crisis of 2007–08]]. The book also highlights the eccentric nature of the type of person who bets against the market or goes against the grain.

The work follows people who believed the bubble was going to burst, like [[Meredith Whitney]], who predicted the demise of [[Citigroup]] and [[Bear Stearns]]; [[Steve Eisman]], an outspoken [[hedge fund]] manager; [[Greg Lippmann]], a [[Deutsche Bank]] trader; Eugene Xu, a [[quantitative analyst]] who created the first CDO market by matching buyers and sellers; the founders of [[Cornwall Capital]], who started a hedge fund in their garage with $110,000 and built it into $120&amp;nbsp;million when the market crashed; and [[Michael Burry]], an ex-[[neurologist]] who created [[Scion Capital]].&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Michael, [http://www.vanityfair.com/business/features/2010/04/wall-street-excerpt-201004 Betting on the Blind Side"], ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'', April 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The book also highlights some people involved in the biggest losses created by the market crash: like [[Merrill Lynch|Merrill]]'s $300 million mezzanine CDO manager Wing Chau; [[Howie Hubler]], known as the person who lost $9&amp;nbsp;billion in one trade, the largest single loss in history;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.observer.com/people/howie-hubler "Stories on Howie Hubler"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100823043941/http://www.observer.com/people/howie-hubler |date=August 23, 2010 }}, ''[[The New York Observer]]''&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Joseph Cassano]]'s [[AIG Financial Products]], which suffered over $99&amp;nbsp;billion in losses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/29455792/ "U.S. offers more funds to help fraught AIG: $30 billion more in loans; $61.7 billion lost in the fourth quarter"], [[MSNBC]], March 2, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The book was shortlisted for the 2010 [[Financial Times and McKinsey Business Book of the Year Award|''Financial Times'' and Goldman Sachs Business Book of the Year Award]]. It spent 28 weeks on ''[[The New York Times]]''{{'}} non-fiction bestseller list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hawes.com/2010/2010-10-10.pdf|title=The New York Times Bestseller List|publisher=The New York Times|date=October 10, 2010|accessdate=2016-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early in its history, [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) had a series of negative encounters with the [[United States federal government]]. This led to decades of mistrust, armed conflict and the eventual disincorporation of the church by an act of the [[U.S. Congress]]. The relationship between the church and the government eventually improved and in recent times LDS Church members have served in leadership positions in Congress and held other important political offices. The LDS Church reserves the right to become involved in political matters if it perceives that there is a moral issue at stake and wields considerable influence on a national level&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ayers|first1=Michael D.|title=When Mormons Go to Washington|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2012/10/mormon-politicians-lds-church-romney|magazine=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]|date=October 15, 2012|accessdate=September 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Barnes|first1=Jane|title=There Is a Dark Side to Mormonism|url=https://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2012/01/30/what-is-it-about-mormons/there-is-a-dark-side-to-mormonism|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=January 30, 2012|accessdate=September 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Grant|first1=Tobin|title=Five things you should know about Mormon politics|url=http://religionnews.com/2015/04/27/five-things-know-mormon-politics/|agency=Religion News|publisher=Religion News Foundation|date=27 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; with over a dozen members of congress having membership in the church in the early 2000s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mansfield|first1=Stephen|title=The Mormonizing of America|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/stephen-mansfield/the-mormonizing-of-americ_b_2083125.html|publisher=[[Oath Inc.]]|website=[[HuffPost]]|date=November 6, 2012|accessdate=September 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and about 80% of Utah state lawmakers identifying as Mormon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Harrison|first1=Peter|title=The LDS Church and Utah Politics|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/peter-harrison/the-lds-church-and-utah-p_b_9278128.html|publisher=Oath Inc.|website=HuffPost|date=February 22, 2016|accessdate=September 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Davidson|first=Lee|title=How Utah's Capitol marches to a Mormon beat|url=http://archive.sltrib.com/story.php?ref=/sltrib/home3/53709967-200/lds-church-says-position.html.csp|newspaper=[[The Salt Lake Tribune]]|date=March 28, 2012|accessdate=September 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Canham|first=Matt|title=Mormon political clout in Utah: Republicans say it’s about right, but Dems say LDS faith has too much|url=http://www.sltrib.com/news/lds/2421049-155/mormon-political-clout-in-utah-republicans|newspaper=The Salt Lake Tribune|date=February 17, 2016|accessdate=September 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bernick|first1=Bob|title=How Much Influence Does the LDS Church Have on the Legislature?

==19th Century==
Many of the political problems faced by the LDS Church stemmed from the controversial practice of [[Mormonism and polygamy|polygamy]]. The practice started with [[Joseph Smith]], the founder of [[Mormonism]], secretly taking on additional wives and was practiced publicly after his death.

===Joseph Smith===
Early LDS scriptures speak favorably of the United States government. The [[Book of Mormon]] (published 1830) contains a passage that favorably describes the [[American Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bushman|first1=Richard|title=The Book of Mormon and the American Revolution|date=1982|url=https://rsc.byu.edu/archived/book-mormon-authorship-new-light-ancient-origins/8-book-mormon-and-american-revolution|accessdate=24 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; An 1833 revelation from Joseph Smith gives divine credit to the establishment of the [[United States Constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/101?lang=eng|title=D&amp;C 101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1839, [[Joseph Smith]] visited U.S. president [[Martin Van Buren]] to plead for the U.S. to help roughly 20,000 Mormon settlers of [[Independence, Missouri]]. The Governor of Missouri, [[Lilburn Boggs]], in attempt to resolve the [[1838 Mormon War]], had issued [[Missouri Executive Order 44|an executive order]] on October 27, 1838, known as the "Extermination Order". It authorized troops to use force against Mormons to "exterminate or drive [them] from the state".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Extermination Order |website=LDS FAQ |url=http://ldsfaq.byu.edu/emmain.asp?number=74 |accessdate=22 August 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050226050512/http://ldsfaq.byu.edu/emmain.asp?number=74 |archivedate=26 February 2005 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boggs, Extermination Order&lt;/ref&gt; Smith and his party appealed to members of Congress and to President Van Buren to intercede for the Mormons. According to Smith's grandnephew, Van Buren said to Smith, "Your cause is just, but I can do nothing for you; if I take up for you I shall lose the vote of Missouri".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Smith |first=Joseph Fielding |authorlink=Joseph Fielding Smith |title=Church History and Modern Revelation |volume=4 |pages=167–73 |publisher=Deseret |date=1946–1949}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Ann Eliza Young |author2=John Bartholomew Gough |author3=Mary Ashton Rice Livermore |title=Wife no. 19, or, the story of a life of bondage |page=55 |year=1876 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=5URCAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA55#v=onepage&amp;q}}&lt;/ref&gt; After failing to receive the assistance of the President, Smith took his case to the [[Senate Judiciary Committee]] chaired by [[Garret D. Wall|Senator Garret Wall]]. The Judiciary Committee did nothing to help the Mormons, lacking the political willpower to launch an investigation into the Mormon War.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bushman|first1=Richard|title=Rough Stone Rolling}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The negative experience with Van Buren marked the beginning of decades of antagonism between Mormon leaders and government officials. The [[White Horse Prophecy]] that followed, where Joseph Smith predicted that the United States Constitution would "hang like a thread", contrasts with the pro-government rhetoric from the early 1830s and reflects Smith's changing attitude towards the U.S. government.

After his experience with Van Buren and finding no support from any of the other presidential candidates, Smith decided to run as an independent in the [[United States presidential election, 1844|1844 election for President of the United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Garr|first1=Aronld K.|title=Joseph Smith: Candidate for President of the United States}}&lt;/ref&gt; He proposed the redemption of [[slavery|slaves]] by selling public lands and decreasing the size and salary of Congress; the closure of prisons; the annexation of Texas, Oregon, and parts of Canada; the securing of international rights on high seas; [[free trade]]; and the re-establishment of a [[national bank]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Smith|first=Joseph, Jr.|author-link=Joseph Smith|year=1844|title=General Smith's Views on the Powers and Policy of the Government of the United States|url=http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/u?/NCMP1820-1846,2597|postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;&amp;#123;&amp;#123;inconsistent citations&amp;#125;&amp;#125;}}.&lt;/ref&gt; His top aide, [[Brigham Young]], campaigned for Smith saying, "He it is that God of Heaven designs to save this nation from destruction and preserve the Constitution."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kenneth H. Winn|title=Exiles in a Land of Liberty: Mormons in America, 1830-1846|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ESwIEefhOWwC&amp;pg=PA203|year=1990|page=203|isbn=9780807843000}}, quote on p 203&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign ended when Smith was [[Death of Joseph Smith|attacked and killed by a mob]] while in the [[Carthage, Illinois]], jail on June 27, 1844.&lt;ref&gt;[[Carthage Jail]]&lt;/ref&gt;

When the Mormon population was concentrated in [[Nauvoo, Illinois]], an [[Anti-Mormon Party (Illinois)|Anti-Mormon party]] sprung up to oppose Mormon political influence in the state.

===Utah Territory and Statehood===

After Smith's death, the majority of Latter Day Saints [[Mormon pioneers|followed Young]] who made plans to move everyone to the [[Salt Lake Valley]]. Young petitioned President Polk for federal assistance for their westward migration.&lt;ref name = warletter&gt;Robert Leonard Little (2007). ''The War Letter: Jesse Carter Little and the Creation of the Mormon Battalion'' (Sacramento, Calif.: Robert Little Publishing) {{ISBN|0-9800279-1-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Assistance came in the form of the [[Mormon Battalion|enlistment of around 500 Mormons]] in the U.S. Army during the [[Mexican–American War|war 
with Mexico]]. The men's salaries were used to help pay for the migration of the larger body of the saints.

in 1849 the Latter-day Saints petitioned Congress that a huge swath of land which they had settled be admitted into the Union as the [[State of Deseret]]. The Mormons hoped for statehood so that they would have the ability to elect their own leaders, and hopefully avoid the persecution which they had so recently escaped.  Because of their previous experiences, the Latter-day Saints were convinced that [[self-governance]] was the only safeguard to their [[Freedom of religion|religious freedom]], and they worried about the possible introduction of "unsympathetic carpetbag appointees" if Deseret were relegated to territorial status.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Crawley, The Constitution of the State of Deseret, 29 (4) BYU Studies 7 (1989).&lt;/ref&gt; Concern over the practice of polygamy as well as other issues made statehood politically unviable. However, Congress instead incorporated "Deseret" into the greatly reduced but still enormous [[Utah Territory]] as part of the [[Compromise of 1850]]. The compromise struck a delicate balance on the issue of slavery. The Mormons had [[History of slavery in Utah|introduced slavery to the area]] upon their arrival.&lt;ref name=gunnison&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7UIqAAAAYAAJ|title=The Mormons: Or, Latter-day Saints, in the Valley of the Great Salt Lake: a History of Their Rise and Progress, Peculiar Doctrines, Present Condition, and Prospects, Derived from Personal Observation, During a Residence Among Them|author=[[John Williams Gunnison]]|publisher=Lippincott, Grambo &amp; Company|year=1852|page=143|quote=Involuntary labor by negroes is recognized by custom; those holding slaves keep them as part of their family, as they would their wives, without any law on the subject. Negro caste springs naturally from their doctrine of blacks being ineligible to the priesthood}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John M. Bernhisel]], a Mormon representative in [[Washington, D.C.]], strenuously lobbied President Fillmore for an all-Mormon slate of territorial officials.  He urged the president that "the people of Utah cannot but consider it their right, as American citizens to be governed by men of their own choice, entitled to their confidence, and united with them in opinion and feeling."&lt;ref&gt;LDS Church, Church History in the Fullness of Times Student Manual, 354.&lt;/ref&gt;  The president therefore appointed Brigham Young, as the territory's governor, and assigned prominent positions to several other Mormons.  But, Fillmore also gave a number of territorial appointments to non-Mormons. The relationship between the non-Mormon federal officials and the Mormons was frequently contentious.
Not long after their appointment, the federal officials, fearing for their safety, [[Runaway Officials of 1851|abandoned their positions]], which were left unfilled for several years.

During the [[U.S. presidential election, 1856|presidential election of 1856]] a key plank of the newly formed [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]'s [[Party platform|platform]] was a pledge "to prohibit in the territories those twin relics of barbarism: polygamy and slavery."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ushistory.org/gop/convention_1856.htm GOP Convention of 1856 in Philadelphia], Independence Hall Association Website&lt;/ref&gt; Although polygamy was a focus of the Republican party platform, it would take more than three decades would pass before the LDS Church was stopped from performing new polygamous marriages.

President [[James Buchanan]] sent U.S. forces to Utah in 1857–58 in order to appoint a new governor over the territory and take control away from [[President of the Church (LDS Church)|church president]] [[Brigham Young]]. These events were known as the [[Utah War]]. The tragic [[Mountain Meadows Massacre]] occurred in the context of these events.

At the outbreak of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], [[Abraham Lincoln]] was relieved to receive a telegraphed reassurance from [[Brigham Young]] that the Utah territory had no intent to secede from the United States.  Lincoln's policy for dealing with the Mormons was to leave them alone. He told a Mormon messenger, "You go back and tell Brigham Young that if he will let me alone I will let him alone."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Widmer|first=Ted|title=Lincoln and the Mormons|url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/11/17/lincoln-and-the-mormons/?_r=0|newspaper=The New York Times|date=November 17, 2011|accessdate=September 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1862, congress passed the [[Morrill Anti-Bigamy Act]] with the purpose of outlawing polygamy in Mormon territories. However, as part of his decision to leave the Mormons alone, Lincoln choose not to enforce the law.

The passage of the [[Poland Act]] in 1874 paved the way for the first prosecutions under the Morrill act from 12 years earlier. [[George Reynolds (Mormon)|George Reynolds]] was selected as a defendant for a test case before the Supreme Court. The unanimous decision from the court was to uphold the anti-polygamy laws and Reynolds sentence of two years in prison.

In 1882, Congress passed the  [[Edmunds Act]], which made polygamy a felony. A key aspect of the Edmunds Act was that it was no longer necessary to prove a bigamous marriage took place to get a conviction, cohabitation was enough. More than 1,300 Mormon men were imprisoned under the terms of the act.&lt;ref name="Edmunds Anti-Polygamy Act of 1882"&gt;U.S.History.com, [http://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h734.html Edmunds Anti-Polygamy Act of 1882].&lt;/ref&gt; Church president [[John Taylor (Mormon)|John Taylor]] was forced to go into hiding for several years frequently moving to avoid capture from the federal authorities.

In 1887, Congress enacted the [[Edmunds–Tucker Act]]. The act disincorporated the church and seized its assets.&lt;ref&gt;L. Rex Sears, "Punishing the Saints for Their "Peculiar Institution": Congress on the Constitutional Dilemmas," 2001 Utah L. Rev. 581&lt;/ref&gt; The act was also responsible for disenfranchising women, which had been given the right to vote in Utah before any of the 37 states at that time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://historytogo.utah.gov/utah_chapters/statehood_and_the_progressive_era/womenssuffrageinutah.html Women's Suffrage in Utah] Jean Bickmore White, Utah History Encyclopedia&lt;/ref&gt; Women voters in the state were disproportionately Mormon, so giving women the right to vote and rescinding that right was a way to control Mormon influence on elections. The anti-polygamy laws were challenged in court but two Supreme Court rulings  ([[Davis v. Beason]] and [[The Late Corporation of the Mormon Church v. United States|The Late Corporation of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints v. United States]] upheld the right of the government to prohibit polygamous marriages and to seize the property of the LDS Church.

A few months after losing its case before the Supreme Court, church president [[Wilford Woodruff]] stated that the church had ended the contracting of new polygamous marriages, reversing the long-standing practice of evading or ignoring anti-polygamy laws. Woodruff said that this announcement was the result of a revelation from [[Jesus Christ]]. The text of the revelation is known as the [[1890 Manifesto]].  Campaigning against polygamy had been a focus of the [[Liberal Party of Utah|Liberal Party]]. With that issue resolved and with the entrance of the major national parties into the state, the Liberal Party disbanded in 1893. Another effect of the 1890 Manifesto was to weaken any enthusiasm in congress for the passage of more anti-polygamy legislation. This opened up the door for the Utah Territory to be recognized as a state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Poll|first1=Richard|title=the legislative antipolygamy campaign|date=1986|url=https://byustudies.byu.edu/content/legislative-antipolygamy-campaign|accessdate=24 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1870s, the [[People's Party (Utah)|People's Party]] was created in Utah Territory and backed by the LDS Church. The anti-Mormon [[Liberal Party (Utah)|Liberal Party]] existed at the same time but won few elections. The [[Salt Lake Tribune]] was the newspaper of the Liberal Party while the [[Deseret News]] supported the pro-Mormon People's Party. Church leaders realized that one obstacle to achieving statehood was that its population did not participate in either of the two major national political parties. It was decided that the People's Party should be disbanded. The Republican Party had opposed statehood for Utah. Because of this, the majority of Mormons in Utah leaned Democrat. However, church leaders did not want to see the entire body of the church turn Democrat leading to a continuation of the status-quo where there was one political party supported by the church and another party opposed to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mormons and Politics|url=http://www.allaboutmormons.com/misconceptions_mormons_politics.php|website=All About Mormons|accessdate=September 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Q. Cannon]] was sent by the First Presidency of the Church to instruct party leaders to make sure that Church members were split between the Republicans and Democrats. In some instances, local bishops stood in front of their congregations and instructed everyone seated on one side of the building to join one party and those families on the other side should join the other party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Williams|first1=J.D.|title=The Separation of Church and State in Mormon Theory and Practice|journal=Dialogue|url=https://www.dialoguejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/sbi/articles/Dialogue_V01N02_38s.pdf|accessdate=4 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1895, Woodruff instituted a rule, informally known as the [[Mormon Political Manifesto]], that [[general authority|general authorities]] of the church should not seek political office without prior permission of the [[First Presidency (LDS Church)|First Presidency]]. In 1898, [[B. H. Roberts]] became the first church member to be elected to Congress. Due to Roberts being a polygamist, he was refused a seat in the Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Roberts|1965|p=363}}. A [[Special elections to the United States House of Representatives|special election]] was held to fill his seat, and [[William H. King]], the congressman who had preceded him, won the election. Roberts later testified during the [[Smoot Hearings]], when opponents of the LDS Church demanded that Republican [[Reed Smoot (U. S. Senator)|Reed Smoot]], a monogamist, be refused his senate seat because Smoot was a Mormon [[apostle (Latter Day Saints)|apostle]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==20th century==
In 1903, the [[Utah State Legislature]] elected [[Reed Smoot]] to the U.S. Senate. Smoot was an [[Apostle (Latter Day Saints)|apostle]] in the LDS Church. His election was controversial due to fears over his allegiance to the church. A [[Reed Smoot hearings|hearing]] was held to determine if Smoot should be allowed a seat in the Senate; the hearing lasted four years, called 100 witnesses and generated 3,500 pages of testimony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uncpress.unc.edu/chapters/flake_politics.html |title=The Politics of American Religious Identity The Seating of Senator Reed Smoot, Mormon Apostle by Kathleen Flake |publisher=The University of North Carolina Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, Smoot was permitted to take his seat in the Senate.

Church president [[Joseph F. Smith]] was one of the people subpoenaed to testify in the Smoot hearings. In 1906, Smith was brought to trial on a charge of unlawful [[cohabitation]] with four women in addition to his lawful wife; he pleaded guilty and was fined $300, the maximum penalty then permitted under the law.&lt;ref&gt;''Deseret Evening News'', November 23, 1906; ''Salt Lake Tribune'', November 24, 1906.&lt;/ref&gt; Smith was a supporter of the Republican party.

In 1904, the American Party was formed in Utah in an attempt to revive the anti-Mormon Liberal Party.&lt;ref name = may&gt;Dean L. May (1987). ''Utah: A People's History'' (Salt Lake City: University of Utah Press, {{ISBN|978-0-87480-284-9}}) p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt; The party lasted until 1911.

During the administration of [[Heber J. Grant]], an effort was made to remove from church literature, sermons, and ceremonies any suggestion that Latter-day Saints should seek vengeance on the citizens or government of the United States for past persecutions of the church and its members, and in particular for the assassinations of church founder Joseph Smith and his brother [[Hyrum Smith|Hyrum]]. This policy became known as the [[Good Neighbor policy (LDS Church)|Good Neighbor policy]].

Grant, a Democrat, was opposed to the election of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] (FDR) and caused a front-page editorial to be written to that effect in the church-owned ''[[Deseret News]]''. Grant shared the view of [[J. Reuben Clark]] and [[David O. McKay]] that the [[New Deal]] was socialism, something they all despised.&lt;ref name="Covenant Communications"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Winder|first1=Michael Kent|title=Presidents and prophets: the story of America's presidents and the LDS church|date=2007|publisher=Covenant Communications}}&lt;/ref&gt; FDR had campaigned on a platform that included the repeal of alcohol prohibition; meanwhile, Grant was a leader in the Utah state Prohibition movement.&lt;ref name="New York Times"&gt;{{cite news|title=MORMON CHURCH OPPOSES PLACING MX MISSILE IN UTAH AND NEVADA|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/06/us/mormon-church-opposes-placing-mx-missile-in-utah-and-nevada.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=May 6, 1981|accessdate=September 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, FDR won Utah in each of his four elections. Grant, seeing the majority of the church members supporting FDR, regarded this as "one of the most serious conditions that has confronted me since I became President of the Church."&lt;ref name="Covenant Communications"/&gt; Later, when Utah voters agreed by plebiscite to become the 36th state to ratify the [[Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution]], thus completing the process of ratification and repealing Prohibition, Grant was devastated; in a [[General Conference (LDS Church)|general conference]], he told the Latter-day Saints, "I have never felt so humiliated in my life over anything as that the State of Utah voted for the repeal of Prohibition."&lt;ref&gt;Heber J. Grant, ''Conference Report'', October 1934, p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt; (Not unrelated to the passage of prohibition in Utah was Grant's strengthening of the Church's own requirements that its members [[Word of Wisdom|abstain from alcohol]].)

[[David O. McKay]], a Republican who became president of the church in 1951, was able to establish friendly relationships with [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|President Dwight D. Eisenhower]]. McKay supported church apostle [[Ezra Taft Benson]] in his role as Eisenhower's Secretary of Agriculture. President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] invited McKay to visit him in the White House.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://millercenter.org/presidentialrecordings/lbj-wh6401.22-1573|accessdate=16 May 2016|title=Johnson Conversation with David O. McKay on Jan 25, 1964}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Benson was president of the church from 1985 to 1994.) McKay rarely used his position in the church to speak out on political issues. One instance in which he did was to instruct Mormon congressmen that they should support the [[right-to-work]] legislation that was before congress at the time. Some of the congressmen reacted negatively to McKay's message feeling like it was not the place of their religious leader to tell them how to vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Right-to-Work Movement|url=http://www.uen.org/utah_history_encyclopedia/r/RIGHT-TO-WORK.html|accessdate=4 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; McKay considered this a religious issue and not a strictly political decision and in fact apostle [[Joseph F. Merrill]] had spoken on this very issue during his address at the Church's [[General Conference (LDS Church)|General Conference]].

During the [[George Romney presidential campaign, 1968|1968 election]], [[George W. Romney]] was also the first Mormon to stage a credible run for the presidency.&lt;ref&gt;Haws, ''The Mormon Image in the American Mind'', p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;  By this time, he was well known as a Mormon and perhaps the most nationally visible one since [[Brigham Young]].&lt;ref&gt;Haws, ''The Mormon Image in the American Mind'', pp. 13, 17.&lt;/ref&gt;  But his membership in the LDS Church was scarcely mentioned at all during the campaign.&lt;ref name="lfls"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/article.php?id=FRC2007092001 | title=Like Father, Like Son? | author=Cook, Rhodes | publisher=[[Center for Politics at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville]] | date=September 20, 2007 | accessdate=July 19, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080606225654/http://www.centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/article.php?id=FRC2007092001|archivedate=2008-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;White, ''The Making of the President, 1968'', p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bachelder"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Bachelder | first=Chris | title=Crashing the Party: The Ill-Fated 1968 Presidential Campaign of Governor George Romney | journal=[[Michigan Historical Review]] | volume=33 | issue=2 | date=Fall 2007 | pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ap073107"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.nashuatelegraph.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070731/NEWS08/207310301 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070808081534/http://www.nashuatelegraph.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20070731%2FNEWS08%2F207310301 | dead-url=yes | archive-date=August 8, 2007 | title=Presidential candidates' religion playing big role in contest | last=Raum | first=Tom | agency=[[Associated Press]] | newspaper=[[The Telegraph (Nashua)|The Telegraph]] | location=Nashua | date=July 31, 2007 | accessdate=July 20, 2009 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.observer.com/2007/romney-more-ghwb-jfk | title=Romney More G.H.W.B.

During the administration of [[Spencer W. Kimball]], the church spoke out in [[Spencer W. Kimball#Equal Rights Amendment|opposition]] to the [[Equal Rights Amendment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=|first=|title=The Church and the Proposed Equal Rights Amendment: A Moral Issue|url=http://www.lds.org/ensign/1980/03/the-church-and-the-proposed-equal-rights-amendment-a-moral-issue|magazine=[[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]]|publisher=Intellectual Reserve, Inc.|date=March 1980}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1990s, the LDS Church participated in an effort to prevent the passage of gay marriage legislation in [[Hawaii]].

==21st century==
In 2004, church president [[Gordon B. Hinckley]] was awarded the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] by [[George W. Bush]].

In 2008, the church was [[Homosexuality and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints#Political involvement|involved]] in promoting [[California Proposition 8 (2008)|California Proposition 8]], which amended the California constitution to prohibit [[same-sex marriage]]s.

When [[Mitt Romney]], son of former presidential candidate George Romney, ran for President of the United States in 2012, it was the first year that a member of the LDS Church received the nomination from one of the two major American parties. At the time, the Senate Majority Leader, [[Harry Reid]], was also a member of the LDS Church.

A 2012 [[Pew Center]] survey on Religion and Public Life indicates that 74 percent of U.S. Latter-day Saints church members lean towards the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]].&lt;ref name="ABC News"&gt;{{cite news|last=Khan|first=Huma|title=Majority of Mormons Lean Republican; Half Cite Discrimination Against Their Faith|url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2012/01/pew-survey-most-mormons-feel-they-are-misunderstood-not-viewed-as-mainstream/|publisher=[[ABC News]]|date=January 12, 2012|accessdate=November 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some liberal members have stated that they feel that they have to defend their worthiness due to political differences.&lt;ref name="USA Today"&gt;{{cite news|last=Passey|first=Brian|title=Mormon Liberals: A Minority Within a Minority|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2012/10/30/mormon-liberals-minority/1669155/|newspaper=[[USA Today]]|publisher=[[Gannett Company]]|date=October 30, 2012|accessdate=November 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent decades,{{when|date=July 2014}} the Republican Party has consistently won a majority of the LDS vote in most national and state-level elections. As a result, [[Utah]], a state with a majority LDS population, is also one of the most heavily Republican states in the country.

In response to the August 2017 [[Unite the Right rally]] in [[Charlottesville, Virginia]], the Church issued a statement of concern over [[racism]], [[Prejudice|intolerance]], and [[Ethnic hatred|hatred]]— calling for [[peace]] and [[understanding]], and for treating "one another with greater [[kindness]], [[compassion]] and [[good]]ness."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Church Issues Statements on Situation in Charlottesville, Virginia|url=http://www.mormonnewsroom.org/article/church-statement-charlottesville-virginia?__prclt=tNTTIVsb|publisher=Intellectual Reserve, Inc.|website=MormonNewsroom.org|date=August 13, 2017|accessdate=September 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Together with the [[University of Connecticut]], MELUS publishes a quarterly [[academic journal]], ''MELUS''. The aim of the Society is "to expand the definition of [[American literature]] through the study and teaching of [[Latino]] American, [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]], [[African-American]], [[Asian American|Asian and Pacific American]], and ethnically specific Euro-American literary works, their authors, and their cultural contexts".&lt;ref name=UConn&gt;{{cite web |url=http://english.uconn.edu/affiliated_programs/melus_docs/melus.html |title=Department of English &amp;#124; UConn |publisher=English.uconn.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-08-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120330114848/http://english.uconn.edu/affiliated_programs/melus_docs/melus.html |archivedate=2012-03-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Founding ==
The society was formed in response to the perceived practice at the [[Modern Language Association]]'s annual conference American Literature section of discussing only works by white men. The society was founded at the following year's conference and within a few months had almost 100 members. At the conference the following year (1974), society members formally proclaimed their demand, "We must expand the canon of American literature!" At this time, the society's goals included the recovery of lost works by minority authors, the compilation of bibliographies of minority literature, and  the enlisting of the aid of ethnic studies scholars in all fields, as well as publishing book reviews, connecting scholars, and printing abstracts on ethnic studies dissertations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Newman |first=Katherine |title=MELUS Invented: The Rest Is History |journal=MELUS |date=Winter 1989–1990  |volume=16 |issue=4 |pages=99–113 |jstor=467104 |doi=10.2307/467104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[comedy]], a '''throwaway line''' (also: '''throwaway joke''' or '''throwaway gag''') is a [[joke]] delivered "in passing" without being the [[punch line]] to a [[comedy routine]], part of the [[wikt:buildup|build up]] to another joke, or (in the context of [[drama]]) there to advance a story or develop a character. Throwaway lines are often [[one-liner joke|one-liner]]s, or [[in-joke]]s, and often delivered in a [[deadpan]] manner.

In [[comic strip]]s ([[Sunday comics]] in particular) throwaway gags are often placed in the throwaway panels of the comic, and are located there so that removing the throwaway panels for space reasons will not destroy the narrative of the central comic.

In [[episodic fiction]], a line intended originally as a throwaway line in one episode may later be [[retconned]] by being incorporated into the [[back-story]] of the main drama, and used to develop the longer-term plot.

The '''Tito–Stalin Split''', or '''Yugoslav–Soviet Split''', was a conflict between the leaders of [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|SFR Yugoslavia]] and the [[Soviet Union]], which resulted in Yugoslavia's expulsion from the Communist Information Bureau ([[Cominform]]) in 1948. This was the beginning of the [[Informbiro period]], marked by poor relations with the USSR, that came to an end in 1955.

==Views==
It was said by the Soviets to be caused by Yugoslavia's disloyalty to the USSR, while in Yugoslavia and the West it was presented as [[Josip Broz Tito]]'s national pride and refusal to submit to [[Joseph Stalin]]'s will in making Yugoslavia a Soviet [[satellite state]].  The scholar Perovic considered the cause was Stalin's rejection of Tito's plans to absorb the [[People's Socialist Republic of Albania|People's Republic of Albania]] and the [[Kingdom of Greece]] in cooperation with the [[People's Republic of Bulgaria]], thereby setting up a powerful Eastern European bloc outside Moscow's control.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Jeronim Perovic, "The Tito–Stalin Split: A Reassessment in Light of New Evidence." ''Journal of Cold War Studies'' (Spring 2007) 9#2 pp: 32-63&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==
{{Eastern Bloc sidebar}}
During the [[World War II|Second World War]], Yugoslavia was occupied by the [[Axis powers|Axis]]. The occupying powers were opposed by several resistance groups; the Communist resistance, led by Marshal [[Josip Broz Tito]], was the largest and took control of the country by 1945, with minimal Soviet intervention. At this point, Tito was loyal to Moscow.

Tito's leading role in liberating Yugoslavia not only greatly strengthened his position in his party and among the Yugoslav people, but also caused him to be more insistent that Yugoslavia would get more room to follow its own interests than other [[Eastern Bloc]] leaders who had more reason (and came under more pressure) to recognize Soviet efforts in helping them liberate their own countries from Axis control. This had already led to some friction between the two countries before World War II was even over. Although Tito was formally an ally of Stalin after World War II, the Soviets had set up a spy ring in the Yugoslav party as early as 1945, resulting in an uneasy alliance.&lt;ref&gt;Richard West, ''Tito'' (1994)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the immediate aftermath of World War II, there occurred several armed incidents between Yugoslavia and the [[Western Bloc]]. Following the war, Yugoslavia successfully captured the territory of [[Istria]], as well as the cities of [[Zadar]] and [[Rijeka]] that had formed part of Italy from the 1920s. This move was of direct benefit to the Slavic populations of the regions (i.e. mainly [[Croats]] and [[Slovenes]]). Yugoslav leadership was looking to incorporate [[Free Territory of Trieste|Trieste]] into the country as well, which was opposed by the Western Allies and by Stalin. This led to several armed incidents, notably Yugoslav fighter planes shooting down American transport aircraft, causing angry criticism from the West and from Stalin. From 1945 to 1948, at least four US aircraft were shot down.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vojska.net/eng/armed-forces/yugoslavia/airforce/victories/ Air victories of Yugoslav Air Force&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Stalin was opposed to these provocations, as he felt that the USSR was unready to face the West in open war so soon after the losses of World War II.

In addition, Tito was openly supportive of the communist side in the [[Greek Civil War]], while Stalin kept his distance, having agreed with [[Winston Churchill|Churchill]] not to support communism there with the [[Percentages agreement]]. Tito planned to absorb Albania and Greece in cooperation with [[People's Republic of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], thereby setting up a powerful Eastern Europe bloc outside Moscow's control. Stalin could not tolerate that threat.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

== First Cominform ==
However, the world still saw the two countries as the closest of allies. This was evident at the first meeting of the [[Cominform]] in 1947, where the Yugoslav representatives were the most strident critics of the national Communist parties viewed to be insufficiently devoted to the cause, specifically the Italian and French parties for engaging in coalition politics. They were thereby essentially arguing Soviet positions. The headquarters for Cominform were even set up in [[Belgrade]]. However, all was not well between the two countries, due to a number of disputes.

== Trip to Moscow ==
The friction that led to the ultimate split had many causes, many of which can ultimately be linked to Tito's regional focus and his refusal to accept Moscow as the supreme Communist authority. The Yugoslavs were of the opinion that the joint-stock companies favored in the Soviet Union were not effective in Yugoslavia. In addition, Tito's deployment of troops in [[People's Socialist Republic of Albania|Albania]] to prevent the civil conflict in Greece from spreading into neighbouring countries (including Yugoslavia), carried out without consulting the Soviets, had greatly angered Stalin.

Stalin was also enraged by Tito's aspirations to merge Yugoslavia with Bulgaria (and therefore create a true "Land of the South Slavs"), an idea with which he agreed in theory, but which had also taken place without prior Soviet consultation.&lt;ref&gt;Perovic, "The Tito–Stalin Split: A Reassessment in Light of New Evidence."&lt;/ref&gt;   He summoned two of Tito's officials, [[Milovan Đilas]] and [[Edvard Kardelj]], to Moscow to discuss these matters. As a result of these talks, Đilas and Kardelj became convinced that Yugoslav-Soviet relations had already reached an impasse.

== Letter exchange ==
Between the trip to Moscow and the second meeting of the Cominform, the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Soviet Communist Party]] and the [[League of Communists of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav Communist Party]] (CPY) exchanged a series of letters detailing their grievances. The first CPSU letter, on March 27, 1948, accused the Yugoslavs of denigrating Soviet socialism via statements such as "socialism in the Soviet Union has ceased to be revolutionary".&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Clissold, ed. ''Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union, 1939-1973: A Documentary Survey'' (1975) p 172&lt;/ref&gt;  It also claimed that the CPY was not democratic enough, and that it was not acting as a vanguard that would lead the country to socialism.  Stalin retorted, "we cannot consider this kind of organization of the Communist Party as truly Marxist-Leninist or Bolshevik. 'One does not feel any policy of class struggle in the Yugoslav Party."&lt;ref&gt;Edvard Kardelj, ''Reminiscences--the Struggle for Recognition and Independence: The New Yugoslavia, 1944-1957'' (1982) p 217&lt;/ref&gt;

The CPY response on April 13 was a strong denial of the Soviet accusations, both defending the revolutionary nature of the party, and re-asserting its high opinion of the Soviet Union. However, the CPY noted also that "no matter how much each of us loves the land of socialism, the USSR, he can in no case love his own country less."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Dennison Rusinow|title=The Yugoslav Experiment 1948-1974|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kChoC2FaS7EC&amp;pg=PA28|year=1978|publisher=U.  of California Press|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviet answer on May 4 admonished the CPY for failing to admit and correct its mistakes, and went on to accuse the CPY of being too proud of their successes against the Germans, maintaining that the Red Army had "saved them from destruction". The CPY's response on May 17 reacted sharply to Soviet attempts to devalue the success of the Yugoslav resistance movement, and suggested that the matter be settled at the meeting of the Cominform to be held that June.

== Second Cominform ==
Tito did not even attend the second meeting of the Cominform, fearing that Yugoslavia was to be openly attacked. On June 28, the other member countries expelled Yugoslavia, citing "nationalist elements" that had "managed in the course of the past five or six months to reach a dominant position in the leadership" of the CPY. The resolution warned Yugoslavia that it was on the path back to bourgeois capitalism due to its nationalist, independence-minded positions.

{{Main|Informbiro period}}
The expulsion effectively banished Yugoslavia from the international association of socialist states. After the expulsion, Tito suppressed those who supported the resolution, calling them "Cominformists".&lt;ref&gt;Paul Garde, ''Vie et mort de la Yougoslavie'', Fayard, Paris, 2000, p. 91&lt;/ref&gt; Many were sent to a [[gulag]]-like prison camp at [[Goli otok]] ("Barren Island").&lt;ref&gt;Serge Métais, ''Histoire des Albanais'', Fayard, Paris 2006, p. 322&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1948 and 1952, the Soviet Union encouraged its allies to rebuild their military forces—especially [[Hungarian People's Republic|Hungary]], which was to be the leading force in a possible war against Yugoslavia.

[[Titoism]] was denounced by Moscow as a heresy that said Communist countries should take a nationalist road to socialism different from that of the Soviet Union.  Across Eastern Europe, Communist leaders suspected of Tito-like tendencies were purged by pro-Moscow elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Alec Nove|title=Stalinism and After: The Road to Gorbachev|url=https://www.amazon.com/Stalinism-After-Gorbachev-Alec-Nove/dp/0415094453/|year=2005|publisher=Routledge|page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Stalin's death and the repudiation of his policies by [[Nikita Khrushchev]], peace was made with Tito and Yugoslavia re-admitted into the international brotherhood of socialist states. However, relations between the two countries were never completely rebuilt; Yugoslavia would continue to take an independent course in world politics, shunning the influence of both west and east. The [[Yugoslav People's Army|Yugoslav Army]] maintained two official defense plans, one against a [[NATO]] invasion and one against a [[Warsaw Pact]] invasion.

Tito used the estrangement from the USSR to obtain US aid via the [[Marshall Plan]], as well as to found the [[Non-Aligned Movement]], in which Yugoslavia was a leading force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Yugoslav-American economic relations since World War II|authors=John R.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="95363">'''Torture and the United States''' includes documented and alleged cases of [[torture]] both inside and outside the [[United States]] by members of the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. government]], the [[United States Armed Forces|U.S. military]], [[Law enforcement in the United States|U.S. law enforcement agencies]], [[United States Intelligence Community|U.S. intelligence agencies]], [[Health Care in the United States|U.S. health care services]], and other U.S. public organizations.

While the term "torture" is defined in numerous places, including [[dictionaries]] and [[encyclopedias]] of various [[nation]]s or [[culture]]s, this article addresses only those practices qualifying as torture under the definition of that term articulated in the [[Codification (law)|codified]] (primarily [[Statutory law|statutory]]) law and [[case law]] of the United States of America.&lt;ref group=nb&gt;''See'' article on [[precising definition]].&lt;/ref&gt; After the U.S. dismissed [[United Nations]] concerns about torture in 2006,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/feb/16/guantanamo.usa |title=UN calls for Guantánamo Bay to close |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=16 February 2006 |accessdate=22 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; one UK judge observed 'America's idea of what is torture ... does not appear to coincide with that of most civilized nations'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/feb/17/politics.world |title=Judge's anger at US torture |author=Norton-Taylor, Richard |author2=Goldenberg, Suzanne |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=17 February 2006 |accessdate=26 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A two-year study by U.S. independent group [[The Constitution Project]] concluded that it was "indisputable" that U.S. forces had employed torture as well as "[[cruel and unusual punishment|cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment]]" in many [[interrogations]]; that "the nation's most senior officials" bear ultimate responsibility for allowing and contributing to the spread of these techniques, and that there is substantial evidence that information obtained by these methods was neither useful nor reliable.

== Legislation, regulation, and treaties regarding torture ==

[[Torture]] is illegal and punishable within U.S. territorial bounds. Prosecution of abuse occurring on foreign soil, outside of usual U.S. territorial jurisdiction, is difficult.

=== Prohibition under domestic law ===

==== Bill of Rights ====

It is debated as to whether or not torture as a punishment falls under the cruel and unusual punishment clause of the [[Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution]]. The text of the Amendment states that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[[Excessive bail]] shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor [[cruel and unusual punishments]] inflicted.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[U.S. Supreme Court]] has held since at least the 1890s that punishments which involved torture are forbidden under the Eighth Amendment.&lt;ref&gt;''In re Kemmler'', 136 U.S. 436, 447 (1890) ("Punishments are cruel when they involve torture or a lingering death.").&lt;/ref&gt;

====18 U.S.C. § 2340 (the "Torture Act")====

An act of torture committed outside the United States by a U.S. national or a non-U.S. national who is present in the United States is punishable under {{UnitedStatesCode|18|2340}}. The definition of torture used is as follows:

{{quote|As used in this chapter—
:(1) "torture" means an act committed by a person acting under the [[color of law]] specifically intended to inflict severe physical or mental pain or suffering (other than pain or suffering incidental to lawful sanctions) upon another person within his custody or physical control;
:(2) "severe mental pain or suffering" means the prolonged mental harm caused by or resulting from—
:: (A) the intentional infliction or threatened infliction of severe physical pain or suffering;
:: (B) the administration or application, or threatened administration or application, of mind-altering substances or other procedures calculated to disrupt profoundly the senses or the personality;
:: (C) the threat of imminent death; or
:: (D) the threat that another person will imminently be subjected to death, severe physical pain or suffering, or the administration or application of mind-altering substances or other procedures calculated to disrupt profoundly the senses or personality; and
: (3) "United States" means the several [[U.S. states|states]] of the United States, the [[District of Columbia]], and the [[Commonwealth (U.S. insular area)|commonwealths]], [[Territories of the United States|territories, and possessions of the United States]].}}

====Military Commissions Act of 2006====

In October 2006, the United States enacted the [[Military Commissions Act of 2006]], authorizing the [[U.S. President|President]] to conduct [[military tribunals]] of [[enemy combatants]] and to hold them indefinitely without judicial review under the terms of [[habeas corpus]]. Testimony coerced through humiliating or degrading treatment would be admissible in the tribunals. [[Amnesty International]] and numerous commentators have criticized the Act for approving a system that uses torture, destroying the mechanisms for judicial review created by [[Hamdan v. Rumsfeld]], and creating a parallel legal system below international standards.&lt;ref&gt;[[Amnesty International]], [http://web.amnesty.org/library/index/ENGAMR511552006 Rubber stamping violations in the "war on terror": Congress fails human rights] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070112130534/http://web.amnesty.org/library/index/ENGAMR511552006 |date=2007-01-12 }}, 27 September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Martin Scheinin, [http://www.unhchr.ch/huricane/huricane.nsf/view01/13A2242628618D12C12572140030A8D9?opendocument U.N.

====U.S. Army Field Manuals====

In late 2006, the military issued updated [[U.S. Army Field Manuals]] on intelligence collection ([http://www.fas.org/irp/doddir/army/fm2-22-3.pdf FM 2-22.3. Human Intelligence Collector Operations], September 2006) and counterinsurgency ([http://www.fas.org/irp/doddir/army/fm3-24.pdf FM 3-24. Counterinsurgency], December 2006). Both manuals reiterated that "no person in the custody or under the control of [[United States Department of Defense|DOD]], regardless of nationality or physical location, shall be subject to torture or cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment, in accordance with and as defined in U.S. law."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fas.org/irp/doddir/army/fm2-22-3.pdf FM 2-22.3. Human Intelligence Collector Operations], 6 September 2006, p. 5-20.&lt;/ref&gt; Specific techniques prohibited in the intelligence collection manual include:
* Forcing the detainee to be naked, perform sexual acts, or pose in a sexual manner;
* [[Hooding]], that is, placing hoods or sacks over the head of a detainee; using duct tape over the eyes;
* Applying beatings, electric shock, burns, or other forms of physical pain;
* [[Waterboarding]];
* Using military [[working dogs]];
* Inducing [[hypothermia]] or heat injury;
* Conducting [[mock execution]]s;
* Depriving the detainee of necessary food, water, or medical care.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fas.org/irp/doddir/army/fm2-22-3.pdf FM 2-22.3. Human Intelligence Collector Operations], 6 September 2006, p. 5-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Prohibition under international law ===

Torture in all forms is banned by the 1948 [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (UDHR), which the United States participated in drafting. The United States is a party to the following conventions (international treaties) that prohibits torture, such as the 1949 [[Geneva Conventions]] (signed 1949; ratified 1955), the [[American Convention on Human Rights]] (signed 1977), the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] (signed 1977; ratified 1992), and the [[United Nations Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment]] (signed 1988; ratified 1994). It has neither signed nor ratified the [[Inter-American Convention to Prevent and Punish Torture]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oas.org/juridico/English/Treaties/a-51.html Inter-American Convention to Prevent and Punish Torture]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[International law]] defines [[jus in bello|torture during an armed conflict]] as a [[war crime]]. It also mandates that any person involved in ordering, allowing, and even insufficiently preventing and prosecuting war crimes is criminally liable under the [[command responsibility]] doctrine.

== Historical practices of torture ==

=== Slavery ===
[[File:Scourged back by McPherson &amp; Oliver, 1863, retouched.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Peter, aka [[Gordon (slave)|Gordon]], a slave from [[Louisiana]], 1863. The scars are a result of a whipping by his overseer, who was subsequently discharged. It took two months to recover from the beating.]]{{main|Slavery in the United States}}

People living as slaves were regulated both in their service and when walking in public by legally authorized violence. On large [[Slave plantation|plantations]], slave overseers were authorized to whip and brutalize noncompliant slaves. [[Slave codes]] authorized, indemnified or even required the use of violence and were long criticized by [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionists]] for their brutality. Slaves as well as free [[African Americans|Blacks]] were regulated by the [[Black Codes (United States)|Black Codes]], and had their movements regulated by [[Slave patrols|patrollers]], conscripted from the white population, who were allowed to use summary punishment against escapees, which included maiming or killing them.

=== Lynching ===
{{Main|Lynching in the United States}}

Lynching was a public act of murder, torture, and mutilation carried out by crowds, primarily against [[African Americans]]. A form of mob violence and social control, usually involving (but by no means restricted to) the illegal hanging and burning of suspected criminals, lynch law cast its pall over the [[Southern United States]] from the mid-19th to the mid-20th centuries. Victims were usually black men, often accused of acting [[uppity]] towards (being insolent), assaulting, having sex with, or raping white people.

The documented murders of 4,743 people who were lynched in the United States between 1882 and 1968 were not often publicized. It is likely that many more unrecorded lynchings occurred during and after this period which influenced The Great Migration of 6.5 million African Americans away from southern states. A 1970s lynching site found in Noxubee County, Mississippi, a location central to regional mob violence, belies the continuation of lynching as a torture method.

Most lynchings were inspired by unsolved crime, [[racism]], and innuendo. 3,500 of its victims were African Americans. Lynchings took place in every state except four, but were concentrated in the Cotton Belt ([[Mississippi]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Alabama]], [[Texas]] and [[Louisiana]]).&lt;ref&gt;Dahleen Glanton, "Controversial exhibit on lynching opens in Atlanta" May 5, 2002, ''Chicago Tribune''. [https://web.archive.org/web/20050311100917/http://www.deltasigmatheta.com/archiv13.htm Reproduced online] on the site of deltasigmatheta.com, archived on the [[Internet Archive]] March 11, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Forms of violence and torture also included genital mutilation, strangulation, maiming and the severing of limbs. Both police and lawmakers, and later federal agents, were frequently complicit in lynching while affiliated with Ku Klux Klan groups, releasing prisoners to lynch crowds and/or refusing to prosecute the participants in a public act of murder. Despite numerous attempts to do so, federal anti-lynching legislation was consistently defeated.&lt;ref&gt;Robin D.G. Kelley, "'Slangin' Rocks ... Palestinian Style,'" chapter 1 of ''Police Brutality,'' Jill Nelson (ed.), 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== "Third degree" ===
The use of "[[Third degree (interrogation)|third degree]] interrogation" techniques in order to compel confession, ranging from "psychological duress such as prolonged confinement to extreme violence and torture", was widespread and considered acceptable in early American policing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Interrogations, Confessions, and Entrapment
 |author=G. Daniel Lassiter|isbn=0-306-48470-6|publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media]]|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|47|date=May 2009}} In 1910 the direct application of physical violence in order to force a confession became a media issue and some courts began to deny obviously compelled confessions.&lt;ref name="leo"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Crime, Law and Social Change|volume=18|title=From coercion to deception: the changing nature of police interrogation in America|year=1992|publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|42|date=May 2009}} In response to this, "''covert'' third degree torture" became popular, since it left no signs of physical abuse. The publication of the [[Wickersham Commission]]'s "Report on Lawlessness in Law Enforcement" in 1931 highlighted the widespread use of covert third degree torture by the police to force confessions, and led to a subsequent decline in its use over the 1930s and 1940s.&lt;ref name="leo"/&gt;{{Rp|38|date=May 2009}}

=== World War II ===
During [[World War II]], the U.S. military interrogated high-level Nazis at a secret camp, "[[P. O. Box 1142]]," outside [[Washington D.C.]] The interrogators did not use physical torture, but did use psychological tricks, like threatening to turn the prisoner over to the Soviets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/secret-wwii-camp-interrogators-say-torture-wasnt-needed/|title=Secret WWII camp interrogators say torture wasn't needed|last=Strickler|first=Laura|date=December 9, 2014|work=CBS News|access-date=2016-10-13|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some captured German [[U-boat]] crewmen were subjected to "shock interrogation" techniques, including exhausting physical exercise and beatings, after their capture during [[Operation Teardrop]].

After the war, in 1948, the [[United States Air Force]] invited [[Luftwaffe|German Luftwaffe]] interrogator [[Hanns Scharff]] to brief them on his interrogation techniques, which did not use physical means to obtain information.

=== Torture abroad during the Cold War ===
{{See also|United States and state terrorism}}
American officials were involved in counter-insurgency programs in which they encouraged their allies, such as the [[ARVN]] to use torture, and actively participated in it, during the 1960s to the 1980s. From 1967 to at least 1972, the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] coordinated the [[Phoenix Program]], which targeted the infrastructure of the Communist [[National Front for the Liberation of South Vietnam]] ("Viet Cong"). The program killed 26,000 Viet Cong and captured over 60,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://usacac.army.mil/CAC/milreview/English/MarApr06/Andrade-Willbanks.pdf Counterinsurgency Lessons from Vietnam for the Future], (PDF), Military Review, March–April 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Critics of the program assert that many of those identified by the program as Viet Cong members were actually civilians, who when captured suffered torture by the South Vietnamese Army, under CIA supervision.{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}}

American trainers and intelligence coordination officials supported the internal security apparatus of the regimes of South America's [[southern cone]] as those regimes carried out kidnappings, "[[forced disappearance|disappearances]]", torture and assassinations during the 1970s and 1980s as part of [[Operation Condor|Operation ''Condor'']].&lt;ref&gt;[[J.

==== U.S. intelligence training manuals ====
{{main|U.S. Army and CIA interrogation manuals}}

The Torture Manuals was a nickname for seven training manuals that had excerpts declassified to the public on September 20, 1996, by the Pentagon.

One was the 1963 CIA document, [[KUBARK Counterintelligence Interrogation]], which describes [[interrogation]] techniques, including, among other things, "coercive counterintelligence interrogation of resistant sources."  The CIA techniques involved were used in the CIA's [[Phoenix Program]] in [[South Vietnam]].  Eventually the CIA's psychological methods were spread worldwide through the [[U.S. Agency for International Development]]'s Public Safety program and U.S. Army [[Mobile Training Teams]].&lt;ref&gt;James Hodge and Linda Cooper, "[http://ncronline.org/NCR_Online/archives2/2004d/110504/110504a.php Roots of Abu Ghraib in CIA techniques]," ''National Catholic Reporter'', November 5, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other manuals were prepared by the U.S. military and used between 1987 and 1991 for intelligence training courses at the U.S. Army School of the Americas (SOA). The manuals were also distributed by Special Forces Mobile Training teams to military personnel and intelligence schools in Colombia, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, and Peru.

The manuals advise that torture techniques can backfire and that the threat of pain is often more effective than pain itself. The manuals describe coercive techniques to be used "to induce psychological regression in the subject by bringing a superior outside force to bear on his will to resist." These techniques include prolonged constraint, prolonged exertion, extremes of heat, cold, or moisture, deprivation of food or sleep, disrupting routines, solitary confinement, threats of pain, deprivation of sensory stimuli, [[hypnosis]], and use of drugs or [[placebos]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lawg.org/misc/Publications-manuals.htm Lawg.org] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060419172911/http://www.lawg.org/misc/Publications-manuals.htm |date=2006-04-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a July 2002 memo sent to the Pentagon's chief lawyer by the military's [[Joint Personnel Recovery Agency]], or [[Joint Personnel Recovery Agency|JPRA]], the military agency that provided advice on harsh interrogation techniques for use against terrorism suspects, not only referred to the application of extreme duress as "torture" but warned that it would produce "unreliable information".&lt;ref name="JPRA_memo"&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/nation/pdf/JPRA-Memo_042409.pdf JPRA Operational Concerns Over Application of Various Means of Induced Duress], (PDF), July 25, 2002, hosted by the Washington Post&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WP_JPRA_4-24"&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/04/24/AR2009042403171_pf.html Document: Military Agency Referred to 'Torture,' Questioned Its Effectiveness], April 24, 2009, the Washington Post&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Police brutality ====
{{main|Police brutality in the United States}}
{{see also|List of wrongful convictions in the United States}}
In more modern policing, police brutality has involved torture. Police officials have generally described these cases as aberrations or the actions of criminals in police uniform, as [[New York City Police Commissioner]] [[Howard Safir]] described the attack on [[Abner Louima]].&lt;ref name=ABC1997&gt;Safir on ABC Good Morning America, August 18, 1997; quoted in Human Rights Watch, "[https://www.hrw.org/reports98/police/uspo99.htm New York]", ''Shielded from Justice: Police Brutality and Accountability in the United States'', 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Police brutality critics, such as law professor Susan Bandes, have argued that such a view is erroneous and that it "allows police brutality to flourish in a number of ways, including making it easier to discount individual stories of police brutality, and weakening the case for any kind of systemic reform."&lt;ref name=Bandes2001&gt;Susan Bandes, [http://llr.lls.edu/volumes/v34-issue2/bandes.pdf Tracing the Pattern of No Pattern: Stories of Police Brutality], 34 ''Loyola Law Review'', 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1936, the Supreme Court recognized in ''[[Brown v. Mississippi]]'' that confessions extracted through police violence are inadmissible as evidence.

In the 1970s and 80s the [[Chicago Police Department]]'s Area 2 unit under Commander [[Jon Burge]] repeatedly used electroshock, near-suffocation by plastic bags and excessive beating on suspects. The City of Chicago's Office of Professional Standards (OPS) concluded that the physical abuse was systematic and, "The type of abuse described was not limited to the usual beating, but went into such esoteric areas as psychological techniques and planned torture."&lt;ref name=Progr1994&gt;Paige Bierma, [http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1295/is_n7_v58/ai_15533722 Torture behind bars: right here in the United States of America], ''[http://progressive.org/about The Progressive]'', July 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, [[Abner Louima]] was [[sodomized]] with a plunger by [[New York Police Department|New York City police]].&lt;ref name=Louima&gt;Justin Volpe plead guilty and was sentenced to 30 years in prison. "[http://www.cnn.com/US/9905/25/police.torture.02/index.html Policeman in torture case changes plea to guilty]," CNN, May 25, 1999. "[http://www.courttv.com/archive/national/louima/121399_volpe_sentence_ctv.html Volpe receives 30-year sentence for sodomy in Louima brutality case] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050330000636/http://www.courttv.com/archive/national/louima/121399_volpe_sentence_ctv.html |date=2005-03-30 }}," Court TV, December 13, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; The officer was convicted and sentenced to 30 years in prison

In May 2006 in Geneva, Switzerland the [[United Nations Committee against Torture]] released a report, which took note of the "limited investigation and lack of prosecution" in connection to accusations of torture in Areas 2 and 3 of the Chicago Police Department and called on American authorities to "promptly, thoroughly and impartially" investigate the accusations, and provide the committee with more information.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Judge Rules Report on Police in Chicago Should Be Released |first=Monica |last=Davey |date=2006-05-20 |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/20/us/20chicago.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Report of the Committee against Torture, Thirty-sixth session |date=May 2006 |url=http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/G06/445/95/PDF/G0644595.pdf |publisher=[[United Nations]] |access-date=2012-01-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150204012129/http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/G06/445/95/PDF/G0644595.pdf |archive-date=2015-02-04 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983 Texas sheriff James Parker and three of his deputies were convicted for conspiring to use [[waterboarding]] to force confessions. The complaint said they "subject prisoners to a suffocating water torture ordeal in order to coerce confessions. This generally included the placement of a towel over the nose and mouth of the prisoner and the pouring of water in the towel until the prisoner began to move, jerk, or otherwise indicate that he was suffocating and/or drowning."&lt;ref name="wp"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/11/02/AR2007110201170_pf.html|title=Waterboarding Used to Be a Crime|author=Evan Wallach|publisher=Washington Post|date=2007-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sheriff was sentenced to ten years in prison, and the deputies to four years.&lt;ref name="wp"/&gt;&lt;ref name="npr"&gt;{{cite news|title=Waterboarding: A Tortured History|author=Eric Weiner|publisher=National Public Radio|date=2007-11-03|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=15886834}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1997, two former officers from the Adelanto Police Department, San Bernardino County, California, were jailed for two years on federal charges, after pleading guilty to beating a suspect during questioning and forcing another man to lick blood off the floor in 1994.&lt;ref name=Amnesty_International1996&gt;Amnesty International, ''[http://web.amnesty.org/library/index/engAMR510351998 Rights for All] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070317035600/http://web.amnesty.org/library/index/engAMR510351998 |date=2007-03-17 }}'', 1 October 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Innocence Project]], about 25 percent of [[wrongful conviction|wrongfully convicted]] innocent people{{how many?|date=July 2012}} were coerced into making false confessions or false incriminating statements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=False Confessions |publisher=The Innocence Project |url=http://www.innocenceproject.org/understand/False-Confessions.php |accessdate=June 6, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120607020132/http://www.innocenceproject.org/understand/False-Confessions.php |archivedate=June 7, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the victims were threatened by the terror of harsher sentences if they remained non-compliant.

==== Prisoner abuse ====
{{further|Human rights in the United States#Prison system}}

In 2005, a [[Channel 4]] documentary "Torture: America's Brutal Prisons" showed video of naked prisoners being beaten, bitten by dogs, forced to crawl like worms, kicked in the groin, stunned with [[Taser]] guns and electric cattle prods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/news/microsites/T/torture/cases.html|title=Torture cases|publisher=Channel 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=torture&gt;{{it}} {{cite news|url=http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/1998/03/05/stupri-torture-gladiatori-gli-orrori-delle-carceri.html|title=Stupri, torture e gladiatori Gli orrori delle carceri|author=Vittorio Zucconi|newspaper=[[la Repubblica]]|date=March 5, 1998|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The guards also had them fight in a deadly duel: the refusal to duel would be result in the death of prisoner, shot by the guards.&lt;ref name=torture/&gt; The same fate would be reserved to the loser of duel, only for the guards' fun.&lt;ref name=torture/&gt;&lt;ref name=barbieri&gt;{{it}} {{cite web|url=http://www.labottegadelbarbieri.org/come-si-uccide/|title=How to kill|website=labottegadelbarbieri.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; A prisoner executed in 2004, Dominique Green, told that two his row mates were beaten up; the guards then flooded the room, destroying every object owned by one of them: his letters, photos, legal documents, the book he was writing, his typewriter.&lt;ref name=barbieri/&gt; The date of his execution, en other, was fixed for the following day.&lt;ref name=barbieri/&gt; Other police officers hit a man, Nanon Williams, [[Phenacyl chloride|macing]] him in eyes: the subsequently beat-up resulted, for him, in a partial loss of sight.&lt;ref name=barbieri/&gt; In one case a prisoner is strapped to a [[restraint chair]] and left for sixteen hours; two hours after being unshackled he dies from a blood clot. In another, mentally ill prisoner Charles Agster is suffocated to death. Another prisoner is found with a broken neck, broken toes and internal injuries following an argument with guards; after one month in a [[coma]] he dies from [[septicaemia]]. Fire extinguisher sized canisters of [[pepper spray]] are used to cover prisoners with chemicals, and they are then left, resulting in [[burn|second degree burns]]. Photos are shown of Frank Valdes, a convicted killer on [[Death Row]], who was beaten to death after writing to local Florida newspapers with allegations of prison officer corruption and brutality. Many of the segments in the documentary were several years old, ''e.g.'' from 1996, and were originally released to lawyers seeking justice for the victims of the offenses shown. Several Lawsuits was filed against the Prison which resulted in the Inmates favor. Other prison officers involved in the incidents were suspended from duty or discharged of their employment.

A 2010 memoir by [[Wilbert Rideau]], an inmate at [[Angola Prison]] from 1961 through 2001, states that "slavery was commonplace in Angola with perhaps a quarter of the population in bondage" throughout the 1960s and early 1970s.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/13/books/review/Oshinsky-t.html | work=The New York Times | first=David | last=Oshinsky | title=Book Review - In the Place of Justice - By Wilbert Rideau | date=June 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The New York Times]]'' states that weak inmates served as slaves who were raped, gang-raped, and traded and sold like cattle. Rideau stated that "The slave's only way out was to commit suicide, escape or kill his master."&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt; Herman Wallace and Albert Woodfox, members of the [[Angola 3]], arrived at Angola in the late 1960s and became active members of the prison's chapter of the [[Black Panther Party]], where they organized petitions and hunger strikes to protest conditions at the prison and helped new inmates protect themselves from rape and enslavement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://motherjones.com/politics/2009/12/herman-wallace-angola-3-solitary-confinement |title=Southern Injustice |publisher=Mother Jones |date= |accessdate=2013-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; C. Murray Henderson, one of the wardens brought in to clean up the prison, states in one of his memoirs that the systemic sexual slavery was sanctioned and facilitated by the prison guards.&lt;ref&gt;Butler, Anne, and C.

From the year 2000 onwards, the Supermax facility at the [[Maine State Prison]] was the scene of video-taped forcible extractions that Lance Tapley in the [[Portland Phoenix]] wrote "look[ed] like torture."&lt;ref name=Tapley&gt;Lance Tapley, [http://www.portlandphoenix.com/features/top/ts_multi/documents/05081722.asp Torture in Maine’s prison] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060316080202/http://portlandphoenix.com/features/top/ts_multi/documents/05081722.asp |date=2006-03-16 }}, Portland Phoenix, November 11–17, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, audio recordings were made of the torture of [[Lester Siler]] in Campbell County, Tennessee. Officers involved in the incident were convicted in court and sentenced to 2–5 years in prison

=== Border Patrol and immigration detention ===

The [[U.S. Border Patrol]] interdicts people crossing the border and maintains checkpoints and carries out raids in border regions. Human Rights Watch has documented severe human rights abuses by the Border Patrol, "including unjustified killing, torture, and rape, and routine beatings, rough physical treatment, and racially motivated verbal abuse."&lt;ref&gt;Human Rights Watch, ''World Report'', 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

Detained immigrants, including refugees seeking asylum, at the [[Esmor]] Inc. facility in [[Elizabeth, New Jersey]], rebelled after practices of verbal and physical abuse, humiliation and corporal punishment. After the uprising, two dozen of them were beaten, stripped, forced to crawl through a gauntlet of officers, and made to chant, "America is number one."&lt;ref&gt;Human Rights Watch, ''Locked Away: Immigration Detainees in Jails in the United States'', September 1998. Dan Frosch, "Detention Center
Blues," ''In These Times'', June 14, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

A report by the Justice Department Office of the Inspector General on the experience of 762 post-9/11 detainees found confirmed the physical and verbal abuse of detainees. On arrival at the [[Metropolitan Detention Center]] in [[Brooklyn, New York]], the detainees were slammed face first into a wall against a shirt with an American flag; the bloodstain left behind was described by one officer as the print of bloody noses and a mouth. Once inside they were threatened with detention for the rest of their lives, verbally abused, exposed to cold, [[deprived of sleep]], and had their hands, cuffed arms, and fingers severely twisted.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Justice Office of the Inspector General, ''The September 11 Detainees: A Review of the Treatment of Aliens Held on Immigration Charges in Connection with the Investigation of the September 11 Attacks'', June 2003.

== Torture abroad ==

=== Khalid el-Masri ===
In 2007, the U.S. Supreme Court deferred to [[state secrets privilege]] when they refused to hear the case of [[Khalid el-Masri]], who was kidnapped and tortured by the [[CIA]] under the Bush administration on December 21, 2003.The [[ACLU]] said that torture included  methods of "forced anal penetration".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.aclu.org/files/pdfs/safefree/elmasri_iachr_20080409.pdf ACLU petition, 2006]. (PDF) . Retrieved on 2012-05-28.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Burke Hansen. [https://www.theregister.co.uk/2007/10/09/el_masri_state_secrets/ Supreme Court denies cert in el-Masri rendition case]. The Register (2007-10-09)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Forms of torture and abuse ===
Certain practices of the [[United States military]], civilian agencies such as the [[CIA]], and private contractors have been condemned both domestically and internationally as  torture. A fierce debate regarding non-standard interrogation techniques exists within the U.S. civilian and military intelligence community, with no general consensus as to what practices under what conditions are acceptable.

These practices have resulted in a number of deaths.  According to [[Human Rights First]], at least as many as 8 detainees have been tortured to death in U.S. custody in Iraq and Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/media/2006_alerts/etn_0222_dic.htm Human Rights First Releases First Comprehensive Report on Detainee Deaths in U.S. Custody] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070428145752/http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/media/2006_alerts/etn_0222_dic.htm |date=2007-04-28 }}, 2006-02-22, Human Rights First, Press Release&lt;/ref&gt; The aversion of some military personnel forced to administer torture has been so strong, that one soldier, [[Alyssa Peterson]], is believed to have committed suicide to avoid further participation.

=== Application of Fifth Amendment to overseas torture ===
In 1999, a U.S. court found that the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]] does not apply in the case of overseas torture of aliens. [[Jennifer Harbury]], a U.S. citizen whose husband Efraín Bámaca Velásquez had been [[Guatemala Human Rights Commission|tortured and murdered by CIA officials in Guatemala]], complained that these actions violated her husband's Fifth Amendment right not to be deprived of life or liberty without due process of law. On December 12, 2000, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit|Court of Appeals for the District Court of Columbia]] rejected this claim, citing a lack of jurisdiction, since the events were planned and controlled in the United States, but the actual torture and murder occurred in Guatemala, a location where the U.S. did not exercise "de facto political control".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Application of Fifth Amendment to Overseas Torture of Alien|journal=The American Journal of International Law|volume=95|date=July 2001|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== "Stress and duress" ====
In 2003 and 2004 there was substantial controversy over the "[[stress and duress]]" methods that were used in the U.S.'s [[War on Terrorism]], that had been sanctioned by the U.S. Executive branch of government at Cabinet level.&lt;ref name=WP_June20&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A56753-2004Jun20.html Torture Policy (cont'd)] Editorial in the  [[Washington Post]] 21 June 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Similar methods in 1978 were ruled by [[European Court of Human Rights|ECHR]] to be ''inhuman and degrading treatment'', but not torture,  when used by the United Kingdom in the early 1970s in [[Northern Ireland]]. [[CIA]] agents have anonymously confirmed to the ''[[Washington Post]]'' in a December 26, 2002 report that the CIA routinely uses so-called "[[stress and duress]]" interrogation techniques, which human rights organizations claim are acts of torture, in the U.S.-led [[War on Terrorism]]. These sources state that CIA and military personnel beat up uncooperative suspects, confine them in cramped quarters, duct tape them to stretchers, and use other restraints that maintain the subject in an awkward and painful position for long periods of time.&lt;ref name=WPDec02&gt;Dana Priest and Barton Gellman, "[https://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename=article&amp;node=&amp;contentId=A37943-2002Dec25&amp;notFound=true U.S. Decries Abuse but Defends Interrogations]" Washington Post, December 26, 2002; Page A01&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase 'torture light' has been reported in the media and has been taken to mean acts that would not be legally defined as torture.

Some techniques within the "stress and duress" category, such as [[water boarding]], have long been considered as torture, by both the United States government and human rights groups.&lt;ref&gt;"The United States has long considered waterboarding to be torture and a war crime." Human Rights Watch, "[http://hrw.org/english/docs/2006/10/26/usdom14465.htm U.S.: Vice President Endorses Torture]," October 26, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In its annual "Country Reports on Human Rights Practices," the U.S. [[State Department]] has described the following practices as torture:
* stripping and blindfolding of prisoners ([[Egypt]])
* subjecting prisoners to prolonged sun exposure in high temperatures and tying of hands and feet for extended periods ([[Eritrea]])
* sleep deprivation and "suspension for long periods in contorted positions" ([[Iran]])
* sleep deprivation and solitary confinement ([[Jordan]])
* prolonged standing and isolation ([[Turkey]])&lt;ref&gt;Human Rights Watch, "[http://hrw.org/english/docs/2005/11/21/usdom12071.htm Descriptions of Techniques Allegedly Authorized by the CIA]," November 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Legal analyses ====
In June 2004, the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', the ''Washington Post'', and the ''[[New York Times]]'' obtained copies of legal analyses prepared for the CIA and the Justice Department in 2002. These documents developed a legal basis for the use of torture by U.S. interrogators if acting under the directive of the President of the United States.  The legal definition of torture by the Justice Department tightly narrowed to define as torture only actions which "must be equivalent in intensity to the pain accompanying serious physical injury, such as organ failure, impairment of bodily function, or even death," and argued that actions that inflict any lesser pain, including moderate or fleeting pain, do not necessarily constitute torture.

It is the position of the United States government that the legal memoranda constituted only permissible legal research, and did not signify the intent of the United States to use torture, which it opposes. Secretary of Defense [[Donald Rumsfeld]] has complained about this prominent newspaper coverage and its implications.&lt;ref name="WP_June20" /&gt; However, many influential U.S. thinkers also believe that Rumsfeld himself is a major part of the problem, quote the ''New York Times'' columnist [[Bob Herbert]]:

{{quote|... there is also the grotesque and deeply shameful issue that will always be a part of Mr. Rumsfeld's legacy—the manner in which American troops have treated prisoners under their control in Iraq, Afghanistan and Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. There is no longer any doubt that large numbers of troops responsible for guarding and interrogating detainees somehow loosed their moorings to humanity, and began behaving as sadists, perverts and criminals.|[[Bob Herbert]]|3=&lt;ref name="NYT_May23"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/23/opinion/23herbert.html?ex=1270785600&amp;en=37bef79604f97228&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland Much of what has happened to the military on Donald Rumsfeld's watch has been catastrophic] by Bob Herbert [[New York Times]] 23 May 2005&lt;/ref&gt;}}
&lt;!-- [http://service.spiegel.de/cache/international/0,1518,357140,00.html article syndicated] --&gt;

The Bush administration told the CIA in 2002 that its interrogators working abroad would not violate U.S. prohibitions against torture unless they "have the specific intent to inflict severe pain or suffering," according to a previously secret Justice Department memo released on 24 July 2008. The interrogator's "good faith" and "honest belief" that the interrogation will not cause such suffering protects the interrogator, the memo adds. "Because specific intent is an element of the offense, the absence of specific intent negates the charge of torture," [[Jay Bybee]], then the [[Assistant Attorney General]] for the [[Office of Legal Counsel]], wrote in the memo. The 18-page memo is heavily redacted, with 10 its 18 pages completely blacked out and only a few paragraphs legible on the others.

Another memo released on the same day advises that "the [[waterboarding|waterboard]]" does "not violate the [[Torture Statute]]." It also cites a number of warnings against torture, including statements by President Bush&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

A third memo instructs interrogators to keep records of sessions that use "enhanced interrogation techniques." The memo is signed by then-CIA director George Tenet and dated January 28, 2003.

The memos were made public by the [[American Civil Liberties Union]], which obtained the three CIA-related documents under [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] requests.&lt;ref name="ACLUmemos2008"&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/07/24/cia.torture/index.html Previously secret torture memo released], July 24, 2008, CNN.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Authorization and methods of torture and abuse ====
The ''Post'' article continues that [[sensory deprivation]], through the use of hoods and spraypainted goggles, sleep deprivation, and selective use of painkillers for at least one captive who was shot in the groin during his apprehension are also used. The agents also indicate in the report that the CIA as a matter of course hands suspects over to foreign intelligence services with far fewer qualms about torture for more [[enhanced interrogation|intensive interrogation]].&lt;ref name=WPDec02 /&gt; (The act of handing a suspect to another organization or country, where it is foreseeable that torture would occur, is a violation of the [[UNCAT|Convention against torture]]; see [[torture by proxy]].) The ''Post'' reported that one U.S. official said, "If you don't violate someone's human rights some of the time, you probably aren't doing your job."&lt;ref name=WPDec02 /&gt;

Based on the Justice Department analyses, Defense Secretary [[Donald Rumsfeld]] later approved in 2003 the use of 24 classified interrogation techniques for use on detainees at Guantanamo Bay, which after use on one prisoner were withdrawn. In court filings made public in January 2007, [[FBI]] agents reported that detainees at Guantanamo Bay were: chained in a fetal position to the floor for at least 18 hours, urinating and defecating on themselves; subjected to extremes of temperature; gagged with duct tape; held in stress positions while shackled; and subjected to loud music and flashing lights.&lt;ref name=FBIJan07&gt;FBI, [http://foia.fbi.gov/guantanamo/detainees.pdf FOIA document]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mark Tran, "[https://www.theguardian.com/guantanamo/story/0,,1981955,00.html FBI files detail Guantánamo torture tactic]," Guardian, January 3, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Senior administration officials have repeatedly denied that torture is being conducted in the detention camps at [[Camp X-ray|Guantanamo Bay]]. However, the Bush administration explicitly endorsed the use of interrogation techniques such as waterboarding in memos to the CIA,&lt;ref name="WPOct08"&gt;Joby Warrick, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/10/14/AR2008101403331_pf.html CIA Tactics Endorsed In Secret Memos], Washington Post Staff Writer, October 15, 2008; A01&lt;/ref&gt; and one Pentagon official has publicly admitted that torture was conducted at Guantanamo Bay.&lt;ref name="APJan09"&gt;{{cite news | title=Pentagon official says 9/11 suspect was tortured | url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2009-01-14-pentagon-torture_N.htm | agency=Associated Press | date=2009-01-14 | accessdate=2009-01-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Manfred Nowak]], [[United Nations Special Rapporteur]] on [[torture]], said that numerous cases of torture ordered by U.S. officials and perpetrated by U.S. authorities are well documented.

&lt;blockquote&gt;We possess all the evidence which proves that the torture methods used in interrogation by the U.S. government were explicitly ordered by former U.S. defence minister Donald Rumsfeld...Obviously, these orders were given with the highest U.S. authorities' knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.commondreams.org/headline/2009/02/02 Call to Try Bush] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090205075303/http://www.commondreams.org/headline/2009/02/02 |date=2009-02-05 }}, Inter Press Service, February 2, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Allegations emerged that in the Coalition occupation of Iraq after the second Gulf war, there was extensive use of torture techniques, allegedly supported by American military intelligence agents, in Iraqi jails such as [[Abu Ghraib]] and others. In 2004 photos showing humiliation and abuse of prisoners leaked from [[Abu Ghraib]] prison, causing a political and media scandal in the U.S. and the whole world.

[[Condoleezza Rice]], [[Secretary of State]] ultimately told the CIA the harsher interrogation tactics were acceptable,&lt;ref name="RiceOkayedWaterboarding"&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2009/04/22/timeline-released-senate-shows-condoleezza-rice-okd-waterboarding/ ''As Bush Adviser, Rice Gave OK to Waterboard'' Fox News, April 22, 2009] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090426232931/http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2009/04/22/timeline-released-senate-shows-condoleezza-rice-okd-waterboarding/ |date=April 26, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SenateReportRice"&gt;''Senate Report: Rice, Cheney OK'd CIA use of waterboarding'' CNN, April 23, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 Rice stated, "We never tortured anyone." &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/Politics, April 30, 2009, "Rice Defends Enhanced Interrogation" by Glenn Kessler]&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 14, 2010, in an appearance on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s [[This Week (ABC TV series)|This Week]], Vice-President [[Dick Cheney]] reiterated his support of [[waterboarding]] and [[enhanced interrogation techniques]] for captured terrorist suspects, saying, "I was and remain a strong proponent of our enhanced interrogation program."&lt;ref name=ABCTW20100214&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Pressed by the BBC in 2010 on his personal view of waterboarding, Presidential Advisor [[Karl Rove]] said: "I'm proud that we kept the world safer than it was, by the use of these techniques. They're appropriate, they're in conformity with our international requirements and with U.S. law." &lt;ref&gt;http://www.timesonline.co.uk, March 13, 2010, "Karl Rove says water torture is justified - and a source of pride" by Giles Whittell&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Secret detention facilities ===
{{main|Black site}}

Both United States citizens and foreign nationals are occasionally captured outside of the United States and transferred to secret U.S. administered detention facilities, sometimes being held incommunicado for periods of months or years. Overseas detention facilities are known to be or to have been maintained at least in [[Thailand]], the [[Philippines]], [[Pakistan]], [[Afghanistan]], [[Uzbekistan]], [[Azerbaijan]], [[Jordan]], [[Egypt]], [[Iraq]], [[Kuwait]], [[UAE]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Morocco]], [[Cyprus]], [[Cuba]], [[Diego Garcia]], and unspecified [[Oceania|South Pacific]] island nation(s). In addition, individuals are suspected to be or to have been held in temporary or permanent U.S. controlled facilities in [[Indonesia]], [[El Salvador]], [[Nigeria]], [[Equatorial Guinea]], [[Libya]], [[Israel]], [[Denmark]], [[Poland]], [[Romania]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Albania]], [[Hungary]], [[Germany]], and [[Scotland]]. There are also allegations that persons categorized as prisoners of war have been tortured, abused or humiliated; or otherwise have had their rights afforded by the Geneva Convention violated.{{facts|date=October 2018}}

[[Extraordinary Rendition]] is the apprehension and [[extrajudicial]] transfer of a person from one country to another.&lt;ref name=MJC-2009-09-08&gt;Michael John Garcia, Legislative Attorney American Law Division.

It has been claimed, though, that torture has been employed with the knowledge or acquiescence of U.S. agencies (a transfer of anyone to anywhere for the purpose of torture is a violation of U.S. law), although [[Condoleezza Rice]] (then the [[United States Secretary of State]]) stated that:&lt;ref name=rice1&gt;{{cite web|title=Remarks of Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice Upon Her Departure for Europe, 5 Dec 2005|url=http://2001-2009.state.gov/secretary/rm/2005/57602.htm|publisher=U.S. State Department|accessdate=17 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;the United States has not transported anyone, and will not transport anyone, to a country when we believe he will be tortured. Where appropriate, the United States seeks assurances that transferred persons will not be tortured.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Whilst the Obama administration has tried to distance itself from some of the harshest counterterrorism techniques, it has also said that at least some forms of renditions will continue.&lt;ref name="LA-Times-2009-Feb-01"&gt;"[http://articles.latimes.com/2009/feb/01/nation/na-rendition1 Obama preserves renditions as counter-terrorism tool]".

The U.S. program has also prompted several official investigations in Europe into alleged secret detentions and unlawful inter-state transfers involving [[Council of Europe]] member states. A [[#27 June 2006 Council of Europe resolution|June 2006 report]] from the Council of Europe estimated 100 people had been kidnapped by the CIA on EU territory (with the cooperation of Council of Europe members), and rendered to other countries, often after having transited through secret detention centres ("[[black site]]s") used by the CIA, some located in Europe. According to the separate [[#The European Parliament's 14 February 2007 report|European Parliament report of February 2007]], the CIA has conducted 1,245 flights, many of them to destinations where suspects could face torture, in violation of Article 3 of the [[United Nations Convention Against Torture]].&lt;ref&gt;

== United Nations Convention Against Torture ==

=== History of U.S. Accession ===
The United Nations Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (commonly known as the [[United Nations Convention against Torture]]) was adopted on 10 December 1984 at the thirty-ninth session of the [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]] of the [[United Nations]].&lt;ref name=Official&gt;
[http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/cat.htm  Official Text of Convention] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071109055454/http://www.ohchr.org/english/law/cat.htm |date=2007-11-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=nb&gt;The United States was one of the primary sponsors of a Convention to prohibit torture and to protect human rights.[https://www.state.gov/www/global/human_rights/torture_intro.html Report]; ''See In Matter of J-E,'' discussed herein.&lt;/ref&gt; It was registered, and came into force, on 27 June 1987 in accordance with Article 27(1) of the Convention.&lt;ref name=A&gt;[http://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;id=129&amp;chapter=4&amp;lang=en Convention Status]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States signed the Convention in the spring of the following year, officially declaring at the time of its signature on 18 April 1988&lt;ref name=A/&gt; that

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Government of the United States of America reserves the right to communicate, upon ratification, such reservations, interpretive understandings, or declarations as are deemed necessary.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Thereafter, the United States formally notified the United Nations and its member states, a few months prior to its ratification, that &lt;ref&gt;[http://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;id=129&amp;chapter=4&amp;lang=en Convention Status - footnote 12]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;...nothing in this Convention requires or authorizes legislation, or other action, by the United States of America prohibited by the Constitution of the United States as interpreted by the United States.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Ratification ===
The U.S. ratification itself, on 21 October 1994, came some six years after the spring 1988 signature and was subject to numerous (A) reservations, (B) understandings and (C) declarations. These can be read verbatim at the UN treaty website&lt;ref name=A/&gt; and are parsed here as follows:

:'''A. Reservations''': The U.S. made two reservations in connection with its ratification.

:'''B. Understandings''': The U.S. announced certain interpretive understandings, "which shall apply to the obligations of the United States under this Convention:"

:(2)  Pursuant to treaty option, the U.S. is not bound to resolve questions by international [[arbitration]], but it "reserves the right specifically to agree to follow this or any other procedure for arbitration in a particular case."&lt;ref&gt;Yee (2004), p. 208, Footnote 18. cites ''Convention Against Torture'', Annex I, I(2).&lt;/ref&gt;

:'''B. Understandings''': The U.S. announced certain interpretive understandings, "which shall apply to the obligations of the United States under this Convention:"

:(1) Regarding the definition of certain terms in the Convention,
::(a) "Torture"&lt;ref group=nb&gt;The term "torture" is legally defined in Article 1(1) of the Convention, as follows::''For the purpose of this Convention, the term "torture" means any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or a third person information or a confession, punishing him for an act he or a third person has committed or is suspected of having committed, or intimidating or coercing him or a third person, or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind, when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity. It does not include pain or suffering arising only from, inherent in or incidental to lawful sanctions.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, the U.S. has declared that the Convention is not self-executing and therefore the Convention's definition does not directly apply in U.S. law. The U.S. has implemented the Convention definition through its [[Code of Federal Regulations]].&lt;/ref&gt; must be specifically intended to inflict severe physical or mental pain. Furthermore, "mental pain" refers to prolonged mental harm resulting from either
:::(1) the intentional infliction of severe physical pain;
:::(2) the administration of mind altering drugs;
:::(3) the use of other procedures that are also "calculated to disrupt profoundly the senses or the personality;"
:::(4) the threat of imminent death; or
:::(5) the threat that another person (e.g. a spouse or relative) will imminently be subjected to the foregoing.

::(b)  "Torture" must be an action against a victim in the torturer's custody.

::(c)  "Sanction"&lt;ref group=nb&gt;The term "sanction" is used in Article 1.&lt;/ref&gt; includes judicially imposed sanctions and other enforcement actions authorized by United States law or by judicial interpretation of such law.

::(d)  "Acquiescence"&lt;ref group=nb&gt;The term "acquiescence" is used in Article 1.&lt;/ref&gt; requires that the public official, prior to the activity constituting torture, be aware that such activity is imminent, thereafter violating his or her duty to prevent such activity.

::(e)  A non-compliance with applicable legal procedural standards&lt;ref group=nb&gt;For instance, a failure to promptly inform a suspect that he has a right to see a lawyer, free of charge if he is indigent.&lt;/ref&gt; does not ''[[wikt:per se|per se]]'' constitute torture.

:(2)  Article 3 forbids deporting a person "where there are substantial grounds for believing that he would be in danger of being subjected to torture." The U.S., attempting to avoid the difficulty of interpreting "substantial grounds for belief," interprets the phrase to mean "if it is more likely than not that he would be tortured." This is essentially the [[preponderance of evidence]] test.

:(3)  Article 14 requires a State Party to provide, in its domestic legal system, a private right of action for damages to victims of torture. The U.S. understands this to apply only for torture committed within territory under the jurisdiction of that State Party.

:(4)  The U.S. does not consider this Convention to restrict or prohibit the United States from applying the [[death penalty]] consistent with the Constitution of the United States.

:(5)  The Convention will only be implemented by the United States "to the extent that it exercises legislative and judicial jurisdiction over the matters covered by the Convention." In other words, the Convention ''per se'' is not U.S. law. By itself, it has no legal effect within the U.S. or upon its representatives. Rather, the Convention imposes an obligation&lt;ref group=nb&gt;This "obligation" might itself only be enforceable in the court of world opinion or through United Nations resolution against the US.&lt;/ref&gt; on the U.S. to enact and implement such domestic laws as will cause it to come into conformity with the requirements of the Convention. This understanding is echoed in the declaration below.

:'''C. Declarations''': The U.S. declared that the provisions of Articles 1 through 16 the Convention are not [[self-executing right|self-executing]].

=== Evidence of violations ===
By transferring military detainees to Iraqi control, the U.S. appears knowingly to have violated the Convention Against Torture. The Convention proscribes signatory states from transferring a detainee to other countries "where there are substantial grounds for believing that he would be in danger of being subjected to torture." The U.S. had received reports of more than a thousand allegations, many of them substantiated by medical evidence, of torture in Iraqi jails. Yet U.S. authorities transferred thousands of prisoners to Iraqi custody, including almost 2,000 who were transferred to the Iraqi government as recently as July 2010.&lt;ref&gt;Al Jazeera, 2010 October 24, "The Secret Iraq Files: The War US Turned Blind Eye to Torture; Leaked Documents on Iraq War Contain Thousands of Allegations of Abuse, But a Pentagon Order Told Troops to Ignore Them," http://english.aljazeera.net/secretiraqfiles/2010/10/20101022161828428516.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== U.S. case law on the convention ==

=== Burden of proof ===

In the U.S., an alien seeking protection against deportation under Article 3 of the Convention&lt;ref group=nb&gt;Article 3 provides that&lt;blockquote&gt;
1. No State Party shall expel, return ("refouler") or extradite a person to another State where there are substantial grounds for believing that he would be in danger of being subjected to torture.&lt;br /&gt;
2. For the purpose of determining whether there are such grounds, the competent authorities shall take into account all relevant considerations including, where applicable, the existence in the State concerned of a consistent pattern of gross, flagrant or mass violations of human rights.&lt;/blockquote&gt; As noted, the U.S. opted to interpret the vague language of "substantial grounds" in article 3(1) as synonymous with the preponderance of evidence standard found in the common law; the "preponderance" standard has been subject of ample decided cases in the US, creating plenty of judicial [[precedent]].&lt;/ref&gt; must establish that it is more likely than not that he will be tortured in the country of removal.&lt;ref group=nb&gt;''See'' Understanding number 2 attached to the U.S. ratification of the Convention, establishing the preponderance of evidence rule for the US.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CFR/&gt; Thus, the alien seeking to stop his deportation bears the [[Legal burden of proof|burden of proof]] (or risk of non-persuasion) to show that torture is "more likely than not" to occur in the destination country.

=== ''In re M-B-A'' ===
''In re M-B-A'', a 2002 decision by the [[Board of Immigration Appeals|BIA]],&lt;ref&gt;23 I&amp;N December 474 (BIA 2002) (ID#3480), available at [http://www.usdoj.gov/eoir/efoia/bia/Decisions/Revdec/pdfDEC/3480.pdf USDOJ.gov] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090513075350/http://www.usdoj.gov/eoir/efoia/bia/Decisions/Revdec/pdfDEC/3480.pdf |date=2009-05-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; concerned a 40-year-old Nigerian woman who was facing a deportation order due to a drug conviction in the US. She claimed that if returned to Nigeria, she would be imprisoned and tortured as a result of her U.S. conviction.

In her December 1999 hearing before the immigration judge, she presented evidence of Nigeria's Decree No. 33, which authorized imprisonment in her situation. When asked how she knew she would be tortured, she said that some years ago, she had spoken with a Nigerian friend,&lt;ref group=nb&gt;She suggested that she had spoken to this person by telephone sometime in 1995, more than four years before she was giving her testimony.&lt;/ref&gt; who had been convicted of a U.S. drug offense and then returned to Nigeria in 1995. The friend had told her that her family had to bring money to the jail for protection, that she slept on the floor and that "you probably get raped" by the guards because they have authority to do "whatever they can do." The friend remained in jail for 2 months until the family paid a bribe. M-B-A did not know if the friend had seen a judge before being incarcerated, or if the friend had been raped in the prison.

M-B-A also presented evidence that she had a chronic ulcer, asthma and suffered from depression; that she was on medication but had no one to help her with medicine if she ended up in jail; that her father was deceased and her mother lived in the UK and that she had no relations to help her in Nigeria, aside from an uncle who had sexually abused her as a child. She claimed she would be beaten and raped in prison by the guards and that most women suffered this treatment, and that her ex-fiancé (who lived in Nigeria) would bribe prison guards to beat her.

The full Board of Appeals&lt;ref group=nb&gt;The Board consists of up to fifteen immigration law specialists, who sit as immigration appellate administrative law judges. The Board is a part of the [[executive branch]] of the U.S. Government, rather than the judicial branch; it is not an "Article III" court under the U.S. Constitution, but rather a type of administrative court within the executive branch. Its decisions are subject to appeal to a U.S. Court of Appeals.&lt;/ref&gt; considered the question of whether M-B-A had carried her burden of proof in showing that it was more likely than not that she would be tortured by a public official upon her return to Nigeria.

In a close 7-6 decision, the Board found that M-B-A had not demonstrated that it was more likely than not that she would be imprisoned in Nigeria on the basis of Decree 33. She did not present any evidence on the question of the extent to which the Decree was enforced, or against whom it was enforced. Her own evidence about enforcement was either (a) her own speculation or (b) based on the conversation with her friend's experience during a different Nigerian regime.&lt;ref group=nb&gt;In May 1999 the military regime in Nigeria was replaced with a civilian regime under President Obasanjo. Note 2 of decision.&lt;/ref&gt; The Board stated

&lt;blockquote&gt;she has [not] met her burden of [establishing] that it is more likely than not that her return to Nigeria would result in her detention or imprisonment. . . . [She] must provide some current evidence, or at least more meaningful historical evidence, regarding . . . enforcement of Decree 33 on individuals similarly situation to herself. . . . [Her] case is based on a chain of assumptions and a fear of what might happen, rather than . . . demonstrating that it is ''more likely than not'' that she will be subjected to torture. . . .&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Accordingly, the BIA held that M-B-A should be deported.

There were two separate dissenting opinions,&lt;ref group=nb&gt;A total of six judges dissented, four of them joining in one of the dissenting opinions.&lt;/ref&gt; both of which agreed with the enunciated standard of proof to be used ("more likely than not"), but disagreed over the question of whether the burden had been met by M-B-A. Judge Schmidt's dissent cited the U.S. State Department's report on Nigeria's prison system, reported that one area of abuse in Nigerian prison was the intentional withholding of medical aid or medication. He found on the basis of this report that such withholding (for purposes of e.g. gaining bribes or inflicting punishment) was common in Nigeria and that death from such actions was common. He did not, however, address the majority's assertion that M-B-A had failed to establish, by a preponderance of the evidence, that she would be imprisoned in the first place under Decree No. 33, apparently taking this for granted.&lt;ref group=nb&gt;The majority decision does not address the question of the likelihood of torture within prison; instead, it finds that M-B-A did not show, by the required evidence standard, that she would be imprisoned at all, which rendered the question of treatment within prison as moot.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Defining "torture" ===

"Torture" within the meaning of the Convention (and 8 Code of Federal Regulations, Section 208.18)&lt;ref name=CFR&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;tpl=%2Fecfrbrowse%2FTitle08%2F8cfr208_main_02.tpl |title=CFR Provisions |access-date=2018-12-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120319210707/http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;tpl=%2Fecfrbrowse%2FTitle08%2F8cfr208_main_02.tpl |archive-date=2012-03-19 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; is an extreme form of cruel and inhuman treatment and does not extend to lesser forms of cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment.&lt;ref name=CFR/&gt;&lt;ref name=JE&gt;[http://www.usdoj.gov/eoir/vll/intdec/nfvol23.html ''In the Matter of J-E-''], volume 23, [http://www.usdoj.gov/eoir/efoia/bia/Decisions/Revdec/pdfDEC/3466.pdf  case 3466] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090513075021/http://www.usdoj.gov/eoir/efoia/bia/Decisions/Revdec/pdfDEC/3466.pdf |date=2009-05-13 }} (BIA decisions).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=nb&gt;This does not imply that such "lesser" forms can be committed by governments with impunity. Article 16 the Convention, for example, imposes on each State Party an obligation to try to prevent such "lesser" forms of cruel treatment, even though they do not rise to the level of torture. But only such severe actions that do rise to the level of "torture" are grounds for preventing deportation under the terms of Article 3 of the Convention.&lt;/ref&gt;

For an act to constitute "torture" it must satisfy each of the following five elements in the definition of torture:&lt;ref name=JE/&gt;
* the act must cause severe physical or mental pain or suffering
*  the act must be intentionally inflicted
* the act must be inflicted for a proscribed purpose
* the act must be inflicted by (or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of) a public official who has custody of the victim
* the act cannot arise from lawful sanctions

=== Matter of J-E ===

Thus, in the U.S. immigration case of ''Matter of J-E-, 23 I&amp;N December 291'' (BIA 2002)(ID 3466), the indefinite detention of criminal deportees by Haitian authorities did not constitute "torture" where there was no evidence that the authorities intentionally and deliberately detained deportees in order to inflict torture. Likewise, substandard prison conditions in Haiti did not constitute "torture" where there is no evidence that the authorities intentionally created and maintained such conditions in order to inflict torture.&lt;ref name=JE/&gt;

J-E was a Haitian who had entered the U.S. illegally and who was later convicted of selling cocaine. The Government sought to deport him, but J-E claimed that he would be imprisoned and tortured if he were returned to Haiti. Therefore, he argued, Article 3 of the Convention prevented his being deported. The Board set out the five-part test for torture and noted that&lt;blockquote&gt;While the Convention Against Torture makes a clear distinction between torturous and non torturous acts, actually differentiating between acts of torture and other bad acts is not so obvious. Although not binding on the United States, the opinions of other governmental bodies adjudicating torture claims can be instructive.&lt;/blockquote&gt; The Board thereupon considered ''Ireland v. United Kingdom'', 2 Eur. Ct. H.R. 25 (1978),  where the European Court held that suspected terrorists who were subjected to wall standing, hooding, a constant loud and hissing noise and who were deprived of sleep, food and drink by the British Army were subjected to "inhuman and degrading treatment" but not to "torture."

It was admitted by all parties that J-E would be indefinitely detained upon return to Haiti. Deportees were held by police in holding cells for weeks before release. However, the State Department report (relied upon by all parties) confirmed that the Haitian government used this policy as a warning and a deterrent, to try to prevent deportees from committing crimes in Haiti.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Thus, Haiti's detention policy in itself appears to be a lawful enforcement sanction ... to protect the populace from criminal acts by Haitians who are forced to return to the country after having been convicted of crimes abroad. ... this policy is a lawful sanction and, therefore, does not constitute torture.... [Also] there is no evidence that Haitian authorities are detaining criminal deportees with the specific intent to inflict severe physical or mental pain or suffering. Nor is there evidence that the procedure is inflicted on criminal deportees for a proscribed purpose, such as obtaining information or a confession.... Haiti's detention practice alone does not constitute torture within the meaning of the regulations.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

J-E contended that in any case, the combination of indefinite detention with the admittedly substandard conditions of Haitian prison constitute torture. However, the Board noted that the Convention required that "torture" required a "specific intent" by the accused country in order for torture to result:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Although Haitian authorities are 
intentionally detaining criminal deportees knowing that the detention facilities are substandard, there is no evidence that they are intentionally and deliberately creating and maintaining such prison conditions in order to inflict torture. ... the Haitian prison conditions are the result of budgetary and management problems as well as the country's severe economic difficulties.... there is no effective delivery system [for food]... we cannot find that these inexcusable prison conditions constitute torture within the meaning of the regulatory definition.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Finally, J-E maintained that mistreatment was common in Haitian prison and that he would be subjected to such mistreatment, and that constituted torture. The Board found that there was, in Haiti,

&lt;blockquote&gt;Beating with fists, sticks and belts ... by far the most common form of abuse. However [there are] other forms of mistreatment, such as burning with cigarettes, choking, hooding and ... severe boxing of the ears, which can result in eardrum damage.... there were also isolated allegations of electric shock...[and] withholding medical treatment.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Board considered all the evidence submitted and concluded that it showed that isolated incidents of torture did occur in Haitian detention facilities. However, this evidence was not sufficient to demonstrate that it was ''more likely than not'' that J-E would be subjected to torture upon his detention. There was no evidence that the torture was persistent or widespread; or that the Haitian government used torture as a policy; or that there was no meaningful international oversight.&lt;ref group=nb&gt;The Board noted that the Haitian government cooperated with the Red Cross in delivering aid and allowed a ''Miami Herald'' reporter access to the prisons (part of the newspaper story was used by J-E as his evidence in the hearing). Furthermore, the U.S. had urged the Haitian government to discontinue the indefinite detention practice and the President of Haiti had visited jails and had pardoned several women there, due to the awful conditions.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Board accordingly held—in yet another 7-6 opinion with substantial dissenting opinions—that J-E had failed to carry his burden of showing that the admitted mistreatment was so pervasive that it therefore was ''more likely than not'' that he would be ''tortured'' in a Haitian jail, as opposed to being subjected to cruel and inhuman acts that, while despicable, were less than torture within the meaning of the applicable law. Most of the actions reported against Haiti, the Board decided, were sanctioned under Article 16 the Convention as acts that were "cruel and inhuman" and that State Parties were obliged to correct, but nevertheless did not constitute "torture" within the meaning of Article 1 of the Convention.

J-E's appeal to the BIA was therefore dismissed and the deportation order remained in effect.

'''Žaliakalnis Funicular Railway''' ([[English language|English]]: ''Green Hill Funicular'') is a [[funicular railway]] in [[Kaunas]], [[Lithuania]]. Built in 1931, it is the oldest funicular in Lithuania and is among the oldest vehicles of such type in the world still operational.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ekskursijos po Kauną: ir patys galite skaityti architektūrą|url=http://kauno.diena.lt/dienrastis/namai/ekskursijos-po-kauna:-ir-patys-galite-skaityti-architektura-361935|website=Kauno.Diena.lt|accessdate=4 July 2011|language=lt}}&lt;/ref&gt; The funicular is made of a wood-paneled coachwork and climbs {{convert|142|m|0}} up from behind the [[Vytautas the Great War Museum]] to the [[Christ's Resurrection Church, Kaunas|Basilica of the Resurrection]].

It was constructed by engineering firm Curt Rudolph Transportanlagen from [[Dresden]], [[Germany]] with electrical equipment from [[AEG]] and mechanical parts from [[Bell Maschinenfabrik]], [[Switzerland]]. The official opening was on 5 August 1931 with one passenger car, while the second car was only a platform ballasted with stones used to counterbalance the passenger car. The electric overhead power cable and the [[Pantograph (rail)|pantographs]] of the coaches are only used for lighting and heating of the cars. The upper station housed the electrically driven funicular mechanism in the basement, whilst the lower end of the line did not even have a shelter until 1932.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://test.svs.lt/?Nemunas;Number%2830%29;Article%28262%29;/|title=Nemunas; Koks jis, Žaliakalnio ir "Nemuno" funikulierius?|accessdate=13 August 2011|language=lt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The funicular succeeded and became very popular transportation for the city inhabitants and guests. It is known that about 5 million passengers were moved using it between 1950 and 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Funikulieriai – vieni įdomiausių technikos paminklų ne tik Lietuvoje|url=http://kaunas.kasvyksta.lt/2016/04/18/miestas/funikulieriai-vieni-idomiausiu-technikos-paminklu/|website=Kaunas.kasvyksta.lt|accessdate=18 April 2016|language=lt-LT}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The funicular was renovated between 1935 and 1937. New, larger cars with car bodies from Napoleonas Dobkevičius on [[underframe]]s from Bell Maschinenfabrik were built, and the lower station was given a proper building. 

The Žaliakalnis Funicular Railway was included into the Registry of Immovable Cultural Heritage Sites of the Republic of Lithuania in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=The Registry of Immovable Cultural Heritage Sites: Unique object code: 16773| url=http://kvr.kpd.lt/heritage/Pages/KVRDetail.aspx?lang=lt&amp;MC=16773| accessdate=14 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, the funicular was one of 44 objects in Kaunas to receive the [[European Heritage Label]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=KAUNAS WAS AWARDED A EUROPEAN HERITAGE LABEL|url=http://visit.kaunas.lt/en/to-see/interwar-architecture/kaunas-was-awarded-a-european-heritage-label/|website=visit.kaunas.lt|accessdate=8 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
