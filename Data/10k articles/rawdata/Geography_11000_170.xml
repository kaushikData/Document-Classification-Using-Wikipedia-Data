The '''A165''' is a road that links [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire|Scarborough]] and [[Kingston upon Hull]], both in [[Yorkshire]], [[England]].  The road is designated as a Primary Route from its junction with the A64 in Scarborough to its southern terminus in Hull.

==History==
[[File:New A165 by-pass, Osgodby. - geograph.org.uk - 1544541.jpg|thumb|left|New A165 by-pass, Osgodby.]]
The route follows partly that of two of the Turnpikes in the area in the 18th&amp;nbsp;century. In 1767, the Bridlington to White Cross Turnpike was established by Act of Parliament and the modern road follows this old route from Bridlington as far as the junction of current A165 and A1035. The modern road also follows part of the Hull-Preston-Hedon Turnpike that was established in 1745, from the point where it is known as Holderness Road in Hull to the river. Where North Bridge now stands there used to be a ferry to link the Holderness Road to the Hessle and Beverley roads as far back as 1305.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.turnpikes.org.uk/map%20Yorkshire%20East%20turnpikes.jpg|title=East Riding of Yorkshire Turnpikes|accessdate=29 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/yorks/east/vol1/pp387-397#highlight-first|title=A History of the County of York East Riding: Volume 1, the City of Kingston Upon Hull|pages=387–397|accessdate=29 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Road developments===

In 1999, Scarborough Borough Council made plans to improve several sections of the A165. These included diverting the route of the road away from Filey Road along a new route starting at the entrance to Scarborough Golf Club to a new roundabout outside the village of Lebberston. This work was completed in December 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thescarboroughnews.co.uk/news/local/filey-road-residents-enjoy-some-peace-and-quiet-thanks-to-new-diversion-1-1443474|title=A165 Lebberston Diversion|accessdate=29 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new route included a new roundabout at Osgodby and at the Cayton Bay Holiday Camp. Also included was a separate piece of work to improve the roundabout at Reighton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scarborough.objective.co.uk/portal/planning/lp/local_plan_1999?pointId=d2063871e15766|title=A165 Planning Policy|accessdate=29 December 2015}}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Route==
The details in this section are taken from Ordnance Survey Open Viewer and Hull City Council.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/opendata/viewer/ Ordnance Survey Open Viewer ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hullcc.gov.uk/portal/page?_pageid=221,518147&amp;_dad=portal&amp;_schema=PORTAL Hull City Council]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:A165 Bridge - geograph.org.uk - 138672.jpg|thumb|left|A165 running over North Bridge in Kingston upon Hull]]
From the northern terminus of the road, at the junction with the '''A171''' in [[Burniston]], the route goes through the northern suburbs of Scarborough, and past Peasholme Park before heading to the town centre. The road forms the eastern terminus of the '''A64''' near to Scarborough Rail Station. The road exits Scarborough along a new route, parallel to the old Filey Road route, past the villages of [[Osgodby, Scarborough|Osgodby]], [[Cayton Bay]], [[Lebberston]] and [[Gristhorpe]] before becoming the Filey bypass. The old route used to go into the town centre and rejoin the current route at the junction with the A1039 road. The '''A1039''' now merges with the A165 for a short distance. The road continues through open countryside until it reaches the outskirts of [[Bridlington]].

The route diverts away from the original road that went into the town centre, now the '''A1038''', and instead goes around the western side to the junction with the '''A164''' near Bridlington Hospital. It turns towards the town centre here until it reaches the junction with the old route at Kingsgate. The road then exits the town in a south-west direction. The road goes through open countryside again, passing the villages of [[Fraisthorpe]], [[Barmston, East Riding of Yorkshire|Barmston]], [[Lissett]], [[Beeford]], [[Brandesburton]] and [[Leven, East Riding of Yorkshire|Leven]]. At Leven, the road merges with the '''A1035''' forming the bypass to the village of Leven.  At the roundabout with Beverley Road, the two roads separate and the A165 continues southward through [[Long Riston]]. It then passes through [[Skirlaugh]], [[Coniston, East Riding of Yorkshire|Coniston]] and [[Ganstead]] before reaching the outskirts of [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]].

Within the city limits the A165 is first known as Holderness Road which it follows all the way into the centre crossing the '''A1033''' (Mount Pleasant). According to the Road Classifying Authority for Hull City Council, at the junction of Witham and Clarence Street, the road splits. One section continues on Witham crossing the '''A1165''' (New Cleveland Street/Great Union Street) and the [[River Hull]] over the Grade II listed&lt;ref&gt;{{IoE|387563|New North Bridge, George Street|accessdate=26 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; North Bridge in George Street (a [[Bascule bridge|Scherzer rolling lift bridge]]). It then becomes Freetown Way before terminating at the '''A1079''' (Beverley Road/Ferensway) junction. The other section continues down Clarence Street to terminate at the junction with the A1165 on Great Union Street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hullcc.gov.uk/portal/page?_pageid=221,518147&amp;_dad=portal&amp;_schema=PORTAL|title=Hull City Council - Classified Roads|accessdate=29 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Speed limits==

Much of the road is through countryside, and has the [[National speed limit]] ({{convert|60|mph}}) applied. A {{convert|3.5|mi|km}} stretch of the road passing the village of Leven in East Yorkshire (known as the Leven bypass) is [[dual carriageway]], carrying a {{convert|70|mph}} speed limit. The road does pass through many villages and settlements, where the limit is reduced. A {{convert|30|mph}} speed limit is in operation through Beeford, Bridlington, Filey, [[Skirlaugh]]. A {{convert|40|mph}} limit exists through other villages such as Fraisthorpe and Coniston. In Scarborough, Bridlington, and the [[Kingston upon Hull]] boundary, the limit is {{convert|30|mph}} or {{convert|40|mph}}. Some stretches of {{convert|30|mph}} or {{convert|40|mph}} limits are monitored at certain times by mobile speed cameras, operated by Safer Roads Humber.

==Safety==
In the [[European Road Assessment Programme]] ([http://www.eurorap.org/ EuroRAP]) survey, which gives all major roads in Europe a safety rating, the A165 is categorised as 'Medium-high risk'.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110726043442/http://www.eurorap.org/road_lookup?map_type=risk&amp;country=GB&amp;road=a165]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:A380 on Haldon.jpg|The A380 on the top of Haldon.|thumb|right]]
The '''A380''' is a road in [[South West England]], connecting the [[Torbay]] area to the [[A38 road|A38]], and hence to the rest of [[Great Britain]]'s main road network.

==Route==
The A380 leaves the A38 at [[Kennford]], some {{convert|3|mi}} from that road's junction with the [[M5 motorway]], and {{convert|6|mi}} from the centre of the city of [[Exeter]]. It then proceeds in a generally southerly direction, climbing over the [[Haldon|Haldon Hills]] before descending past the towns of [[Kingsteignton]] and [[Newton Abbot]] and continuing on a single carriageway flyover over the Penn Inn roundabout heading towards [[Torquay]].

Beyond Newton Abbot, the road [[bypass (road)|bypass]]es the village of [[Kingskerswell]] on the South Devon Highway. The road soon comes to Edginswell (a signal controlled junction) at Torquay where it meets the A3022 that (as [[Dual carriageway]]) serves the large seaside resort of Torquay. The road then heads right up a hill towards Gallows Gate roundabout then Preston Down roundabout and then Churscombe Cross roundabout on the Paignton ring road where the road reduces to single carriageway and enters Paignton finally ending at [[Collaton St Mary]] {{convert|1|mi}} inland from Paignton, where it meets the A3022 (again) and the [[A385 road|A385]] at [[List of road junctions in the United Kingdom: T#tweenaways|Tweenaways Cross]].&lt;ref name=sab380&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.sabre-roads.org.uk/roadlists/r10/notes.php?number=A380 | title = A380: Kennford - Collaton St Mary | publisher = The Society for All British Road Enthusiasts | accessdate = 2009-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kingskerswell bypass==
There have been plans to alleviate the traffic congestion on the stretch of the road between Newton Abbot and Torquay since 1951.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In October 2010 the government refused to fund the scheme,&lt;ref&gt;BBC Spotlight News 27 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and placed it in a funding pool to compete against 33 other schemes nationwide for a £600 million development fund. However, in November 2011 the government awarded £74.6 million towards the cost of the bypass, with construction to start the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-devon-15951459 |title=Kingskerswell bypass work could start in 2012 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=2011-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Construction began in October 2012 with the road completed and opened in December 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-devon-19931255 |title=Work starts on Kingskerswell bypass |publisher=BBC News |date=12 October 2012|accessdate=2013-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; This new section of road is designated the South Devon Highway.

==Penn Inn Roundabout==

[[File:Penn Inn roundabout - South Devon - geograph.org.uk - 25832.jpg|thumb|Penn Inn roundabout - northern approach]]
The Penn Inn [[Roundabout]] is a [[Traffic light|signal]]-[[Roundabout#Controlled roundabouts|controlled]] roundabout interchange at Newton Abbot where the A380 used to meet the [[A381 road|A381]] and an unclassified road at one of the busiest roundabouts in [[Devon]]. The A380 now continues over the roundabout on a single carriageway flyover continuing to [[Exeter]] as part of the South Devon Highway (Traffic can still get to the roundabout off the dual carriageway using the other lane). This is to relieve congestion especially at peak times. There is a completely separate system of subways for pedestrians underneath the roundabout.

It is a junction which is noted for being subject to very high vehicle flows (in 2008, 73000 vehicles per day entered the roundabout)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Black|first=David|title=A380 South Devon Link Highway (Kingskerswell Bypass) Traffic and Economics p.90|url=http://www.devon.gov.uk/kkbp-dccp4.pdf|publisher=Devon County Council|date=June 2009|accessdate=3 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as a result can be subject to long queues at peak times. Various upgrades have been made to the junction since its construction in an effort to increase capacity; it now has four lanes on the A381 approach and northern section of the roundabout. The Kingskerswell bypass completed in December 2015 has a single carriageway flyover north-south so that through traffic on the A380 dual carriageway does not have to negotiate the junction.

The junction takes its name from the similarly-named adjacent Pen Inn [[pub]] which in May 2015 was acquired by [[Mitchells &amp; Butlers]] and rebranded as [[Toby Carvery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Clark|first1=Daniel|title=Toby Carvery in Newton Abbot to open next week|url=http://www.torquayheraldexpress.co.uk/toby-carvery-newton-abbot-open-week/story-26484881-detail/story.html|accessdate=28 October 2016|publisher=Local World|date=12 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alonzo de Santa Cruz''' (or Alonso, Alfonso) (1505 – 1567) was a Spanish [[cartographer]], mapmaker, instrument maker, historian and teacher. He was born about 1505, and died in November 1567. His maps were inventoried in 1572.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.as.ua.edu/ant/Mabila/Braund%20MS.pdf{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.larramendi.es/Poligrafos/alonso_de_santa_cruz.htm |title=Biblioteca Virtual Ignacio Larramendi&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |access-date=2006-10-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070217102651/http://www.larramendi.es/Poligrafos/alonso_de_santa_cruz.htm |archive-date=2007-02-17 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alonzo de Santa Cruz was a renowned cartographer on the [[Consejo de Indias]] (Council of the Indies) and a [[cosmographer]] at the ''[[Casa de  Contratación]]'' (House of Trade). There, he worked on the [[Padrón Real]], a Spanish map documenting the discoveries in the New World.&lt;ref&gt;

  --&gt;libraryTreasures.html?libraryid=41  TEL-41].&lt;/ref&gt;

Alonzo de Santa Cruz, described cosmography as a way of making a painting of the earth, "because (gra)phia is the same as painting and cosmos is world"&lt;ref&gt;"Apuntes y Borrador para el Prologo al Yslario General de Alonso de Santa Cruz," Seccion de Patronato, Legajo 260, No. 2, Ramo 6, folio 8, Archive of the Indies, Seville (n.d.).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://mlab.uiah.fi/simultaneous/Text/Leonardo.html ''A Simultaneous View of History: The Creation of A Hypermedia Database'', Lily Díaz]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1530, Alonzo de Santa Cruz produced the first map of magnetic variations from true north. He believed it would be of use in finding the correct longitude. Alonso de Santa Cruz designed new nautical instruments,&lt;ref&gt;''Alonso de Santa Cruz, cartógrafo y fabricante de instrumentos náuticos de la Casa de Contratación'', Mariano Cuesta Domingo, ''[[Revista Complutense de Historia de América]]'', Vol 30, pages 7-40, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; was interested in navigational methods, and wrote about [[John Cabot]]'s method for finding longitude which made use of the declination of the sun, observed with the quadrant.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biographi.ca/EN/ShowBioPrintable.asp?BioId=34224 Dictionary of Canadian Biography&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Alonzo also taught [[astronomy]] and cosmography in the court of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]]. Alonzo then wrote a five-volume biography about Charles V which described some of the Spanish atrocities in the New World. This upset Charles' son, [[Philip II of Spain|Phillip II]], and so Phillip removed three chapters of the biography.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.opwest.org/Archive/2003/200303_OriqueThesis/200303_06_OriqueThesis.htm |title=''Confesionario: Avisos y Reglas Para Confesores by Bartolomé de Las Casas: A Translation and Introduction to Its Historical Context and Legal Teaching'', a thesis by David Thomas Orique, O.P. |access-date=2006-10-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061114222006/http://www.opwest.org/Archive/2003/200303_OriqueThesis/200303_06_OriqueThesis.htm |archive-date=2006-11-14 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also produced the ''Islario general de todas las islas del mundo'' (sometimes called the [[Islario]] General), a map and document describing the world's islands, at the request of King [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]] in 1542. He also continued [[Hernando del Pulgar]]'s work titled, ''History of the Catholic Monarchs''.

The '''Amenthes Fossae''' are a system of troughs in the [[Amenthes quadrangle]] of [[Mars]] centered  at 9.07°N and 102.68°E.  They are 850&amp;nbsp;km across and were named after a classical [[albedo]] feature.  The classical albedo feature name was based on the [[Egypt]]ian name for a place where souls of the dead go ([[Amenthes]] or Duat).  The name Amenthes Fossae was approved in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{GPN|227}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The term "fossae" is used to indicate large troughs when using geographical terminology related to Mars. Troughs, sometimes also called [[graben]]s, form when the crust is stretched until it breaks, which forms two breaks with a middle section moving down, leaving steep cliffs along the sides. Sometimes, a line of pits form as materials collapse into a void that forms from the stretching.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msss.com/mars_images/moc/2004/01/29/index.html Mars Global Surveyor MOC2-620 Release]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Politics of Germany}}
'''Amt''' is a type of [[administrative division]] governing a group of municipalities, today only in Germany, but formerly also common in other countries of [[Northern Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=FCe1BgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA334&amp;dq=Verbandsgemeinde&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjHjauI55zTAhXjCcAKHQBFBkU4FBDoAQg7MAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=ortsgemeinde&amp;f=false|title=Handbuch der kommunalen Wissenschaft und Praxis: Band 1: Grundlagen und Kommunalverfassung|last=Püttner|first=Günter|date=2013-11-21|publisher=Springer-Verlag|year=|isbn=9783662119679|location=|pages=333|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its size and functions differ by country and the term is roughly equivalent to a US [[township]] or [[county]] or English [[Non-metropolitan district|shire district]].

== Current usage ==
===Germany===
====Prevalence====
The ''Amt'' (plural: ''Ämter'') is unique to the [[Germany|German]] ''[[States of Germany|Bundesländer]]'' (federal states) of [[Schleswig-Holstein]], [[Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania]] and [[Brandenburg]]. 

Other German states had this subdivision in the past.
Some states have similar administrative units called ''[[Samtgemeinde]]'' ([[Lower Saxony]]), ''[[Verbandsgemeinde]]'' ([[Rhineland-Palatinate]]) or ''[[Municipal association (Germany)|Verwaltungsgemeinschaft]]'' ([[Baden-Württemberg]], [[Bavaria]], [[Saxony]], [[Saxony-Anhalt]], [[Thuringia]]).

====Definition====
An ''Amt'', as well as the other above-mentioned units, is subordinate to a ''Kreis'' ([[district]]) and is a collection of municipalities. The amt is lower than district-level government but higher than municipal government, and may be described as a supra-municipality or "municipal confederation". Normally, it consists of very small municipalities (''Gemeinden'', plural of [[Gemeinde (Germany)|Gemeinde]]).

Larger municipalities do not belong to an ''Amt'' and are called ''amtsfreie Gemeinden'' (independent municipalities); some of these municipalities may also not depend from a ''Kreis'' (district) and are called ''kreisfreie Gemeinden'', and when they do also not belong to any other ''Land'' they are also called ''Stadtstaaten'' (plural of ''Stadtstaat''), i.e. city-states ([[Berlin]] and [[Hamburg]]).

These large municipalities (cities, in German ''Städte'', plural of ''Stadt'') may be further subdivided into local offices named ''Ortsämter'' (plural of ''Ortsamt''), each of them possibly grouping several suburbs (or small townships in rural areas) of the municipality named ''Ortsteile'' (plural of ''Ortsteil''), named from small villages or hamlets or localities. The ''Ortsteil'' (suburb or township) may have been a former parish, but today it is meant only for civil purpose and essentially used for planning within the municipality; the ''Ortsamt'' (sometimes just named informally but confusingly as an ''Amt'', or informally translated as an "urban district") is used to offer decentralized services of the municipality within local administrative offices for the residents in neighbouring suburbs. The ''Ortsteil'' itself may also be confusingly translated as a "municipality", but it is incorrect because it belongs to a city which is the only effective municipality (''Gemeinde'').

==Former usage ==
===Denmark===
The ''{{lang|da|amt}}'' (plural, ''{{lang|da|amter}}''; commonly translated as "province" or, less accurately, "county") was an administrative unit of [[Denmark]] (and, historically, of [[Denmark-Norway]]). The provinces were established by royal decree in 1662 as replacements for the former ''{{lang|da|Len}}'' (fiefs). The ''{{lang|da|amter}}'' were originally composed of independent towns (''{{lang|da|købstæder}}'') and parishes, and held only small areas of responsibility. During the 20th century, they were granted responsibility for the hospital service for the non-urban population.&lt;!--the Danish population was predominantly non-urban at the time. The købstæder (towns) assumed the same responsibility for townspeople--&gt; A 1970 administrative reform reduced the number of provinces to fourteen&lt;!--includes Bornholm. Copenhagen and Frederiksberg held similar responsibilities but didn't hold the actual title as "amt" --&gt; and eliminated the administrative distinction between (rural) parish and town. From then on, the ''amter'' were composed of a number of municipalities (''{{lang|da|[[Municipalities of Denmark|kommuner]]}}''). The reform granted the provinces wider areas of responsibility, most notably running the national health service and the ''[[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]]'' secondary schools.

The [[Municipalities of Denmark#Municipal Reform 2007|Danish Municipal Reform]] of January 1, 2007 abolished the ''amter'' and replaced them with five administrative [[Regions of Denmark|regions]], now solely charged with running the national health service. In contrast to the ''amter'' the regions hold no authority to levy taxes. The reform re-delegated all other areas of responsibility to either the municipalities or the state. At the same time, smaller municipalities were merged into larger units, cutting the number of municipalities from 270 to 98. See [[Counties of Denmark]] for more information about the Danish usage of the term.

=== Germany ===
In Germany an ''Amt'' was a medieval administrative district covering a manorial estate or the land owned by a castle or village. It was headed by an ''[[Amtmann]]'', usually a lesser nobleman or cleric, appointed by a [[territorial lord]] to administer and dispense justice within the ''Amt''.

===Netherlands and Flanders===
''Ambacht'' can be seen as the [[Dutch language|Dutch]] equivalent to ''amt''. ''Ambachten'' existed in [[Holland]], [[Zeeland]] and [[Flanders]] up to about 1800.

===Iceland===
While Iceland was a territory of the Danish-Norwegian realm, amts (singular: ''{{lang|is|amt}}''; plural: ''{{lang|is|ömt}}'') were established in the country on top of the existing [[Counties of Iceland|counties]]. From 1684 to 1770, Iceland as whole was a single amt in the Kingdom of Denmark-Norway but was then split into two amts: North and East Amt (''{{lang|is|Norður- og Austuramt}}'') and South and West Amt (''{{lang|is|Suður- og Vesturamt}}''). The latter was in 1787 split into a West Amt (''{{lang|is|Vesturamt}}'') and South Amt (''{{lang|is|Suðuramt}}''). Iceland was thus divided into three amts until 1872, when the South and West amts were again merged. Amts were abolished in 1904, when Iceland gained [[home rule]] from Denmark.

Amts are not used to denote a geographical region in Iceland but the name lives on in the names of two public libraries in Iceland that were established during the amt era. The Amts libraries in [[Akureyri]] and [[Stykkishólmur]] which were established as the designated archives for the North and East Amt and the West Amt respectively.

===Norway===
From 1662 to 1919, the [[counties of Norway]] were called ''amter''. They are now referred to as ''[[fylke]]r'', a term revived from the Middle Ages.

He was born during the 16th century in [[Milos]] and he lived part of his life in [[Venice]] as shown from records of the Greek community of Venice. According to the 1st Book of Marriages 1599–1701 of the Greek community of Venice, someone called "Antonio Damilos" was married on 10 August 1599.&lt;ref&gt;Η Βενετία των Ελλήνων, Χρύσα Μαλτέζου, copyright Εκδόσεις Γένους Άλιμος,Εκδόσεις Μίλητος, {{ISBN|960-8460-14-X}}, σελ 455 (2005)&lt;br&gt;

Initiated in 1947, the '''Association for the Sciences of Limnology and Oceanography (ASLO)''', formerly known as the '''American Society of Limnology and Oceanography''', is a scientific society with the goal of Advancing the Sciences of [[Limnology]] and [[Oceanography]]. With approximately 4000 members in nearly 60 different countries, ASLO is the largest scientific society, worldwide, devoted to either limnology or oceanography or both. ASLO’s mission is to foster a diverse, international scientific community that creates, integrates and communicates knowledge across the full spectrum of aquatic sciences, advances public awareness and education about aquatic resources and research, and promotes scientific stewardship of aquatic resources for the public interest. Its products and activities are directed toward these ends.

ASLO publishes four scientific journals:&lt;br /&gt;
[http://aslo.org/lo/ ''Limnology and Oceanography''];&lt;br /&gt;
[http://aslo.org/lofe/ ''Limnology and Oceanography: Fluids and Environments'']; &lt;br /&gt;

Much of the content of ASLO journals is [[Open access (publishing)|open access]].  In addition to occasional small workshops (LINK) ASLO hosts regularly scheduled major scientific [https://web.archive.org/web/20070701205254/http://aslo.org/meetings/aslomeetings.html meetings] around the world including the Aquatic Science Meetings; the Ocean Science Meetings and the Summer ASLO Meetings. ASLO presents five annual [https://web.archive.org/web/20070707065951/http://aslo.org/information/awards.html awards] in recognition of professional excellence in the field. Active in outreach and [[Public administration|public affairs]] related to the aquatic sciences and related fields, ASLO has a [https://web.archive.org/web/20070903120653/http://www.aslo.org/policy/index.html Public Affairs Office].  ASLO is governed by an elected [http://aslo.org/information/board.html Board of Directors], which includes 2 student members with full voting privileges.  ASLO offers its members many [http://aslo.org/information/benefits.html benefits] and provides information to the general public and educators as well.

Association for the Sciences of Limnology and Oceanography gives out the following awards:
* the ''Raymond L. Lindeman Award'' for an outstanding paper written by a young aquatic scientist
* the ''[[G. Evelyn Hutchinson Award]]'' to an outstanding mid-career scientists in limnology or oceanography

'''Corbio''' was an ancient town of [[Latium]] in central [[Italy]].

In around 488 BC, Corbio was captured by an invading army of the [[Volsci]], led by [[Gaius Marcius Coriolanus]] and [[Attius Tullus Aufidius]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Livy]], ''[[Ab urbe condita (book)|Ab urbe condita]]'', 2.39&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Deriba''' is a [[Pleistocene]] or [[Holocene]] [[caldera]] in [[Darfur]], [[Sudan]]. Part of the volcanoes of the [[Marrah Mountains|Marra Mountains]], it lies on the [[Darfur Dome|Darfur dome]] and like the [[Tagabo Hills]] and [[Meidob volcanic field|Meidob Hills]] volcanism may be the consequence of a [[mantle plume]]. The highest point of Sudan (after the separation of [[South Sudan]]) lies on the margin of the caldera.

The caldera lies atop a [[shield volcano]] or ash cone in the southern Marra Mountains, which developed first as a pile of [[Basalt|basaltic]] [[lava flows]] and later as layers of [[volcanic ash]] and [[tuff]], including the eruptions that formed the caldera. A large eruption occurred about 3,520 ± 100 years [[before present]], and [[Hot spring|hot springs]] and [[Fumarole|fumaroles]] are active to the present day.

Deriba contains two lakes, one in the northeastern side of the main caldera and the other in a cone in the southwestern sector of the Deriba caldera. The fresher southwestern lake is smaller but considerably deeper than the saltier northeastern lake; in the late Pleistocene the caldera was filled with a larger lake.

== Geography and geomorphology ==
[[File:Deriba map.jpg|thumb|Map of the Deriba caldera]]
Deriba lies in the [[Marra Mountains]] of [[Sudan]],{{sfn|Green|Moghraby|Ali|2009|p=493}} Africa's geographic centre;&lt;ref name="IssawiSallam2017" /&gt; Deriba is in the southern sector of these mountains and close to the main summit thereof.{{sfn|Gillan|1918|p=263}}  The caldera rim became Sudan's new highest point, after the independence of [[South Sudan]].&lt;ref name="Forbes" /&gt; The town of [[Nyala, Sudan|Nyala]] lies south of Deriba.{{sfn|Vail|1972|p=251}} 

Deriba is an oval, {{convert|3|x|4|mi|km|order=flip}}{{sfn|Gillan|1918|p=265}} wide and {{convert|500|-|1000|m}} deep [[caldera]], with a [[volcanic cone]] occupying the southwestern part of the caldera floor. The rim of the caldera reaches a maximum elevation of {{convert|3024|m}} in the southwest.{{sfn|Green|Moghraby|Ali|2009|p=493}} The caldera is cut into [[volcanic ash]], [[lapilli]], [[lava]]s, [[obsidian]] and [[tuff]]s, and the floor is strewn with [[pumice]] blocks.{{sfn|Lynes|Lynes|1921|p=123}}{{sfn|Vail|1972|p=259}} A gap lies in the eastern caldera wall.{{sfn|Williams|Morton|Parry|Adamson|1980|p=323}}

=== Lakes ===

Deriba contains two lakes, which are known as the "Deriba lakes". A {{convert|11.5|m}} deep lake occupies the northeastern area of the caldera,{{sfn|Green|Moghraby|Ali|2009|p=493}} and being located in the lowest part of the caldera floor{{sfn|Hammerton|1968|p=136}} it is the [[sink]] of Deriba.{{sfn|Lynes|Lynes|1921|p=123}} In 1918 it had dimensions of {{convert|1350|x|1950|yd|m|order=flip}}, but by 1964 the size of the lake had increased.{{sfn|Hammerton|1968|p=138}} The lake is surrounded by a gradually sloping muddy beach with the exception of the northern shore.{{sfn|Hobbs|1918|p=360}} This lake is also known as the "female" lake, with green salty water.{{sfn|Gillan|1918|p=265}} The salt consists of [[chloride]], [[potassium]] and [[sodium]] salts.&lt;ref name="FottKarim1973" /&gt;

The volcanic cone has a lake as well, which is {{convert|108|m}} deep{{sfn|Green|Moghraby|Ali|2009|p=493}} and smaller, with a roughly rectangular shape that extends in north-south direction.{{sfn|Green|Moghraby|Ali|2009|p=494}} In comparison to the other lake {{convert|0.75|mi|km|order=flip}} northwest, this "male" lake had dimensions of {{convert|900|x|1550|yd|m|order=flip}} in 1918. Steep slopes surround this lake,{{sfn|Gillan|1918|p=265}} which is filled with [[freshwater|fresh]]er water.{{sfn|Lynes|Lynes|1921|p=123}} Reportedly, the local [[Fur]] people considered the lake [[haunted house|haunted]],{{sfn|Hobbs|1918|p=361}} but the lakes were also used as a source for [[salt]].{{sfn|Hammerton|1968|p=141}}

Water levels in these lakes are fairly stable{{sfn|Lynes|Lynes|1921|p=124}} from season to season{{sfn|Hammerton|1968|p=139}} although evidence for substantial fluctuations have been found.{{sfn|Hammerton|1968|p=138}}{{sfn|Williams|Morton|Parry|Adamson|1980|p=305}} Together with several perennial [[stream]]s they are thus perennial waterbodies.{{sfn|Vail|1972|p=252}} Around the Deriba caldera, [[drainage]] occurs either southward or westward,{{sfn|Vail|1972|p=256}} leading into the [[Bahr al-Arab|Bahr El-Arab]] of the [[White Nile]] and the [[Chari River]] of [[Lake Chad]] respectively.&lt;ref name="IssawiSallam2017" /&gt; The lakes themselves have no surface outlets.{{sfn|Hobbs|1918|p=362}}

In the past, larger lakes existed inside the Deriba caldera. The first such lake stage has been dated to 19,000 years [[before present]] when water levels rose {{convert|25|m}} above the present-day levels, the second 19,600 - 16,000 years before present when they were {{convert|8|-|5|m}} higher than currently and the third 14,000 years before present, then {{convert|9|m}} above present-day. Similar lake stages have been documented in [[Trou au Natron]] in Tibesti, where shifts of the position of the [[Subtropical jet stream]] and the [[tropical depression]]s associated with the jet stream have been invoked as an explanation.&lt;ref name="Maley2000" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Soulié-Märsche2010" /&gt; These lake stages have left [[limestone]] deposits in the caldera,{{sfn|Williams|Morton|Parry|Adamson|1980|p=305}} and it's likely that the lakes sometimes overflowed through the eastern caldera rim gap.{{sfn|Williams|Morton|Parry|Adamson|1980|p=325}}

== Geology ==

Deriba is part of [[Jebel Marra]] volcano, which together with the [[Tagabo Hills]] and the [[Meidob Hills]] is one of three [[volcanic field]]s in [[Darfur]];{{sfn|Wickens|1975|p=110}} these form the little known Darfur Volcanic Province.{{sfn|Franz|Pudlo|Urlacher|Haussmann|1994|p=614}} The Jebel Marra volcano is maximally {{convert|80|km}} wide and {{convert|200|km}} long in north-south direction, where the northern segment is centered around Jebel Gurgei.{{sfn|Vail|1972|p=251}} 

Jebel Marra consists of a pile of mostly [[basalt]]ic lava which has been covered by [[pumice]] and [[volcanic ash]] as well as [[pyroclastic]] rocks and [[ignimbrite]]s.&lt;ref name="Francis1973" /&gt; The Deriba caldera which forms the top of the entire complex,{{sfn|Wickens|1975|p=112}} which around Deriba has the appearance of a large ash cone{{sfn|Vail|1972|p=258}} or [[shield volcano]].{{sfn|Franz|Pudlo|Urlacher|Haussmann|1994|p=618}} Other, less spectacular [[Volcano|vents]] are found elsewhere in the Marra Mountains. Erosion has cut [[canyon]]s into the volcanic complex.{{sfn|Vail|1972|p=253}} The occurrence of volcanism has been explained with a [[mantle plume]] centered between Meidob and Jebel Marra.{{sfn|Franz|Pudlo|Urlacher|Haussmann|1994|p=621}}

The basement is formed by crystalline rocks, mainly [[metamorphosed]] [[gneiss]]es and [[schist]]s,{{sfn|Vail|1972|p=257}} and is a [[mobile belt]] of [[Pan-African orogeny|Panafrican]] age.{{sfn|Franz|Pudlo|Urlacher|Haussmann|1994|p=614}} They are in part covered by the [[Nubian Sandstone]]s of [[Cretaceous]] age and [[aeolian processes|aeolian]] sands,{{sfn|Wickens|1975|p=111}} and by the Jebel Marra massif which occupies a surface of {{convert|13000|km2}}.{{sfn|Wickens|1975|p=112}} Tectonic [[Geologic uplift|uplift]] of the [[Darfur Dome|Darfur dome]] commenced in the [[Cretaceous]]&lt;ref name="DavidsonWilson1989" /&gt; and resulted in a noticeable upwarp of the basement beneath Jebel Marra.&lt;ref name="Francis1973" /&gt; Two major tectonic [[lineament]]s intersect at Jebel Marra.{{sfn|Wickens|1975|p=111}}

=== Eruptive history ===

Volcanism in the southwestern Marra mountains took place between 4.35 million years ago and 60,000 years ago,{{sfn|Franz|Pudlo|Urlacher|Haussmann|1994|p=618}} subdivided into an Old Series and a New Series which is younger than 2 million years ago. The Deriba caldera probably formed either 60,000&lt;ref name="DavidsonWilson1989" /&gt; or 3,520 ± 100 years [[before present]] (BP), but activity continued with the volcanic cone inside of the caldera and peripheral vents, possibly into historical time.{{sfn|Wickens|1975|p=112}}

The 3,520 ± 100 BP eruption was a [[Plinian eruption]] that deposited [[pyroclastic]] material containing blocks of basement material. The ash fall from the eruption reaches thicknesses of {{convert|20|m}} as far as {{convert|5|km}} away from Deriba,&lt;ref name="Francis1973" /&gt; while [[pyroclastic flow]]s have been identified as far as {{convert|30|km}} from the caldera. The eruption has an estimated [[volcanic explosivity index]] of 4&lt;ref name="GVP" /&gt; and may be associated with the volcanic cone inside the caldera.{{sfn|Williams|Morton|Parry|Adamson|1980|p=305}}

The volcano was formerly considered to be [[extinct]].&lt;ref name="Nature1966" /&gt; [[Hot spring]]s whose temperature reaches {{convert|65|-|85|C}} and which may be supplied by [[magmatic water]]&lt;ref name="Nature1966" /&gt; and [[fumarole]]s, both within the caldera around the volcanic cone and in the surrounding Marra Mountains,{{sfn|Wickens|1975|p=112}}{{sfn|Green|Moghraby|Ali|2009|p=494}} indicate that Jebel Marra and the Deriba caldera are a [[dormant volcano]].{{sfn|Green|Moghraby|Ali|2009|p=494}} Reportedly, the exhalations of the fumaroles can kill birds and insects,&lt;ref name="Nature1966" /&gt; and some fumarolic vents may have formed between 1964 and 1966,&lt;ref name="USGS" /&gt; implying that the fumarolic activity may reflect a recent change of volcanic activity.{{sfn|Hammerton|1968|p=143}}

== Climate ==

Precipitation on Jebel Marra is about {{convert|1200|mm/year|in/year}},{{sfn|Wickens|1975|p=109}} the mountain lies at the southern margin of the [[Sahara]]&lt;ref name="Soulié-Märsche2010" /&gt; and receives more precipitation than the surrounding region.{{sfn|Hammerton|1968|p=136}} Between 12,000 and 8,000 years before present, the climate was wetter as a consequence of a northward shift of climate zones.{{sfn|Wickens|1975|p=120}}

== Biology ==

Vegetation around Deriba consists of grassland with scarce trees such as the [[wild olive]].{{sfn|Lynes|Lynes|1921|p=126}} The plant life is classified as [[Afromontane]], it also includes species from [[temperate]] climates.{{sfn|Wickens|1975|p=109}} It is likely that past humid periods permitted the expansion of [[Mediterranean]] species into the Jebel Marra mountains.{{sfn|Wickens|1975|p=118}} Presently, Jebel Marra may be a suitable site for agriculture.{{sfn|Vail|1972|p=252}} [[Semidesert]] and [[desert]] landscapes dominate the region around the Marra Mountains.{{sfn|Hammerton|1968|p=136}}

Generally, the lakes are salty, [[oxygen]] poor and remote and thus contain little plant or animal life.{{sfn|Green|Moghraby|Ali|2009|p=502}} Some vegetation grows around the smaller lake, as well as in other parts of the Deriba caldera where water is available.{{sfn|Lynes|Lynes|1921|p=124}}

[[Copepod]]s live in the smaller lake, while the larger one is populated by [[blue-green alga]]e and [[rotifer]]s.{{sfn|Green|Moghraby|Ali|2009|p=494}} ''[[Spirulina (genus)|Spirulina]]'' occurs in the large lake,{{sfn|Green|Moghraby|Ali|2009|p=497}} and ''[[Melosira]]'' and ''[[Nitzscia]]'' [[diatom]]s have been identified in the small lake.{{sfn|Green|Moghraby|Ali|2009|p=498}} The copepod ''[[Eucyclops gibsoni]]'' has been encountered in the small lake. Among the rotifers are ''[[Brachionus dimidiatus]]'', ''[[Brachionus plicatilis]]'', ''[[Hexarthra jenkinae]]''{{sfn|Green|Moghraby|Ali|2009|p=498}} and ''[[Lecane bulla]]'', some of which also occur in the smaller lake.{{sfn|Green|Moghraby|Ali|2009|p=499}} ''[[Ephedra]]'' flies are widespread around the large lake, and other insects were collected on the small lake.{{sfn|Green|Moghraby|Ali|2009|p=500}} Birds are uncommon, with [[greenshank]]s, [[little grebe]]s, [[sacred ibis]] and [[stilt]]s.{{sfn|Green|Moghraby|Ali|2009|p=501}}

'''Deuteronilus Mensae''' is a region on [[Mars]] 937&amp;nbsp;km across and centered at {{coord|43.9|N|337.4|W|globe:Mars}}. It covers 344° -325° West and 40°-48° North.&lt;ref name="MooreHunt1997"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Patrick Moore|author2=Garry Hunt|title=The atlas of the solar system|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jb87PgAACAAJ|accessdate=21 March 2011|date=1 January 1997|publisher=Chancellor|isbn=978-0-7537-0014-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Deuteronilus region lies just to the north of [[Arabia Terra]] and is included in the [[Ismenius Lacus quadrangle]]. It is along the dichotomy boundary, that is between the old, heavily cratered southern highlands and the low plains of the northern hemisphere. The region contains flat-topped knobby terrain that may have been formed by glaciers at some time in the past.

==Source of ice==

It is now widely believed that ice accumulated in many areas of Mars, including Deuteronilus Mensae, when the planet's orbital tilt was very different from now (the axis of Mars has considerable "wobble," meaning its angle changes over time).&lt;ref&gt;Madeleine, J. et al. 2007.  Mars:  A proposed climatic scenario for northern mid-latitude glaciation.  Lunar Planet. Sci. 38.  Abstract 1778.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Madeleine, J. et al.  2009.  Amazonian northern mid-latitude glaciation on Mars:  A proposed climate scenario.  Icarus: 203. 300-405.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mischna, M. et al.  2003.  On the orbital forcing of martian water and CO2 cycles:  A general circulation model study with simplified volatile schemes.  J. Geophys. Res.  108. (E6).  5062.&lt;/ref&gt;  A few million years ago, the tilt of the axis of Mars was 45 degrees instead of its present 25 degrees.  Its tilt, also called obliquity, varies greatly because its two tiny moons cannot stabilize it, like our relatively large moon does the Earth.

Many features on Mars, including Deuteronilus Mensae, are believed to contain large amounts of ice.  The most popular model for the origin of the ice is climate change from large changes in the tilt of the planet's rotational axis.  At times the tilt has even been greater than 80 degrees&lt;ref&gt;Touma J. and J. Wisdom.  1993.  The Chaotic Obliquity of Mars.  Science 259, 1294-1297.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Laskar, J., A.

Icarus 170, 343-364.&lt;/ref&gt;   Large changes in the tilt explains many ice-rich features on Mars.

Studies have shown that when the tilt of Mars reaches 45 degrees from its current 25 degrees, ice is no longer stable at the poles.&lt;ref&gt;Levy, J., J. Head, D. Marchant, D. Kowalewski.  2008.  Identification of sublimation-type thermal contraction crack polygons at the proposed NASA Phoenix landing site: Implications for substrate properties and climate-driven morphological evolution. Geophys. Res. Lett. 35. doi:10.1029/2007GL032813.&lt;/ref&gt;   Furthermore, at this high tilt, stores of solid carbon dioxide (dry ice) sublimate, thereby increasing the atmospheric pressure.  This increased pressure allows more dust to be held in the atmosphere.  Moisture in the atmosphere will fall as snow or as ice frozen onto dust grains.  Calculations suggest this material will concentrate in the mid-latitudes.&lt;ref&gt;Levy, J., J. Head, D. Marchant.   2009a.

Martian Geomorphology.  Geological Society, London.  Special Publications: 356.  111-131&lt;/ref&gt;  General circulation models of the Martian atmosphere predict accumulations of ice-rich dust in the same areas where ice-rich features are found.&lt;ref&gt;Laskar, J., A.

When the tilt begins to return to lower values, the ice sublimates (turns directly to a gas) and leaves behind a lag of dust.&lt;ref name="Mellon, M. 1995"&gt;Mellon, M., B.  Jakosky. 1995.

Dynamics of ice ages on Mars. Nature 449, 192–194.&lt;/ref&gt;   The lag deposit caps the underlying material so with each cycle of high tilt levels, some ice-rich mantle remains behind.&lt;ref&gt;Madeleine, J., F. Forget, J. Head, B. Levrard, F. Montmessin.   2007.  Exploring the northern mid-latitude glaciation with a general circulation model.  In:  Seventh International Conference on Mars.  Abstract 3096.&lt;/ref&gt;   Note, that the smooth surface mantle layer probably represents only relative recent material.

==[[Polygonal patterned ground]]==

Polygonal, patterned ground is quite common in some regions of Mars.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.diss.fu-berlin.de/diss/servlets/MCRFileNodeServlet/FUDISS_derivate_000000003198/16_ColdClimateLandforms-13-utopia.pdf?hosts=&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Kostama, V.-P., M.

S&lt;/ref&gt;  It is commonly believed to be caused by the sublimation of ice from the ground.  [[Sublimation (phase transition)|Sublimation]] is the direct change of solid ice to a gas.  This is similar to what happens to [[dry ice]] on the Earth.  Places on Mars that display polygonal ground may indicate where future colonists can find water ice.  Patterned ground forms in a mantle layer, called [[latitude dependent mantle]], that fell from the sky when the climate was different.&lt;ref&gt;Hecht, M.  2002.  Metastability of water on Mars.

==[[Upper Plains Unit]]==

Remnants of a 50-100 meter thick mantling, called the upper plains unit, has been discovered in the mid-latitudes of Mars.  First investigated in the Deuteronilus Mensae region, but it occurs in other places as well.  The remnants consist of sets of dipping layers in craters and along mesas.&lt;ref&gt;Carr, M.  2001.  Mars Global Surveyor observations of martian fretted terrain.  J. Geophys. Res.  106, 23571-23593.&lt;/ref&gt; Sets of dipping layers may be of various sizes and shapes—some look like Aztec pyramids from Central America

ESP 028418 2240pyramidsmall.jpg|Group of small sets of dipping layers, as seen by HiRISE under HiWish program

&lt;/gallery&gt;

This unit also degrades into [[brain terrain]].  Brain terrain is a region of maze-like ridges 3–5 meters high.  Some ridges may consist of an ice core, so they may be sources of water for future colonists.

&lt;gallery class="center" widths="190px" heights="180px" &gt;
ESP 028273 2240pyramidbrain.jpg|Layered features and brain terrain, as seen by HiRISE under HiWish program  The upper plains unit often changes into brain terrain.
&lt;/gallery&gt;

Some regions of the upper plains unit display large fractures and troughs with raised rims; such regions are called ribbed upper plains.  Fractures are believed to have started with small cracks from stresses.  Stress is suggested to initiate the fracture process since ribbed upper plains are common when debris aprons come together or near the edge of debris aprons—such sites would generate compressional stresses.  Cracks exposed more surfaces, and consequently more ice in the material sublimates into the planet’s thin atmosphere.  Eventually, small cracks become large canyons or troughs.

&lt;gallery class="center" widths="190px" heights="180px"&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

Small cracks often contain small pits and chains of pits; these are thought to be from [[sublimation (phase transition)]] of ice in the ground.&lt;ref&gt;Morgenstern, A., et al.  2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Baker, D. 2015"&gt;Baker, D., J. Head.  2015.  Extensive Middle Amazonian mantling of debris aprons and plains in Deuteronilus Mensae, Mars:  Implication for the record of mid-latitude glaciation.  Icarus: 260, 269-288.&lt;/ref&gt;
Large areas of the Martian surface are loaded with ice that is protected by a meters thick layer of dust and other material.  However, if cracks appear, a fresh surface will expose ice to the thin atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;Mangold, N.  2003.  Geomorphic analysis of lobate debris aprons on Mars at Mars Orbiter Camera scale: Evidence for ice sublimation initiated by fractures.  J. Geophys. Res.  108, 8021.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Levy, J. et al.  2009.  Concentric&lt;/ref&gt;  In a short time, the ice will disappear into the cold, thin atmosphere in a process called [[sublimation (phase transition)]]  .  Dry ice behaves in a similar fashion on the Earth.  On Mars sublimation has been observed when the [[Phoenix lander]] uncovered chunks of ice that disappeared in a few days.&lt;ref name=Press&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/phoenix/news/phoenix-20080619.html Bright Chunks at ''Phoenix'' Lander's Mars Site Must Have Been Ice] – Official NASA press release (19.06.2008)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nasa.gov"&gt;http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/phoenix/news/phoenix-20080619.html&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, HiRISE has seen fresh craters with ice at the bottom.  After a time, HiRISE saw the ice deposit disappear.&lt;ref&gt;Byrne, S. et al.  2009.  Distribution of Mid-Latitude Ground Ice on Mars from New Impact Craters: 329.1674-1676&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

The upper plains unit is thought to have fallen from the sky.  It drapes various surfaces, as if it fell evenly.  As is the case for other mantle deposits, the upper plains unit has layers, is fine-grained, and is ice-rich.   It is widespread; it does not seem to have a point source.  The surface appearance of some regions of Mars is due to how this unit has degraded.  It is a major cause of the surface appearance of [[lobate debris apron]]s.&lt;ref name="Baker, D. 2015"/&gt;
The layering of the upper plains mantling unit and other mantling units are believed to be caused by major changes in the planet’s climate.  Models predict that the obliquity or tilt of the rotational axis has varied from its present 25 degrees to maybe over 80 degrees over geological time.  Periods of high tilt will cause the ice in the polar caps to be redistributed and change the amount of dust in the atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;Head, J. et al.  2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Madeleine, et al.  2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schon, et al.  2009.

==Development==
The satellite was developed by 11 scholars under the Philippine [[Department of Science and Technology (Philippines)|Department of Science and Technology]] (DOST), in cooperation with the [[Tohoku University]] and [[Hokkaido University]] in contrast to 9 DOST scholars who worked with [[Diwata-1]], Diwata-2's predecessor.&lt;ref name="sunstar"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mondonedo-Ynot|first1=Laureen|title=Diwata 2's payload includes amateur radio|url=http://www.sunstar.com.ph/manila/local-news/2017/01/18/diwata-2s-payload-includes-amateur-radio-520807|accessdate=25 January 2017|work=Sun Star Manila|date=18 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike its predecessor, Diwata-2 takes advantage of radio communication technology by carrying an amateur radio payload for disaster relief purposes.&lt;ref name="sunstar"/&gt; The satellite also hosts all embedded features of its predecessor.&lt;ref name="davaotoday"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://davaotoday.com/main/headline/change-is-coming-how-space-technology-is-changing-disaster-risk-management-in-phl/|title=Change is coming (1/2): How space technology is changing disaster risk management in PHL|last1=Sambalud|first1=Mark|date=7 December 2016|work=Davao Today|accessdate=25 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The planning phase of the Diwata-2's development includes a simulation model, a mechanical test model, an engineering model and a flight model. This stage ended with the flight model which was completed on August 29, 2018 and was handed over to the [[Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency]] (JAXA) on the following day.&lt;ref name="bm1"&gt;{{cite news |title=Diwata-2 microsatellite launching on Oct. 29 |url=https://businessmirror.com.ph/diwata-2-microsatellite-launching-on-oct-29/ |accessdate=28 October 2018 |work=BusinessMirror |date=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Instruments==
Weighing {{convert|56|kg|lb|abbr=on}}&lt;ref name="spaceflight"/&gt;, Diwata-2 will host an amateur radio payload which will enable people in the Philippines to relay messages through ham radio to any part of the country. This function is meant for disaster relief operations. The satellite will also carry Spaceborne Multispectral Imager (SMI) with liquid crystal tunable filter (LCTF) for environmental monitoring, and a high precision telescope (HPT) for rapid post-disaster assessment. Compared to Diwata-1 which hosted wide and middle field cameras, Diwata-2 will host enhanced resolution cameras.&lt;ref name="sunstar"/&gt; The SMI, is equipped with an upgraded enhanced spatial resolution camera allowing the satellite to produced sharper images than the Diwata-1. It will also have a deployable solar panels to power the satellite's payloads.&lt;ref name="flyhigh"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Tumampos |first1=Stephanie |last2=Resurreccion |first2=Lyn |title=PHL flying high–into space |url=https://businessmirror.com.ph/phl-flying-high-into-space/ |accessdate=29 October 2018 |work=BusinessMirror |date=29 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Launch and mission==
The satellite was targeted by the DOST to be deployed as early as the second quarter of 2018.&lt;ref name="diwata2better"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rappler.com/technology/features/171988-diwata-1-diwata-2-improvements-up-tech-fair|title=How Diwata-2 is better than PH's first satellite, Diwata-1|last1=Usman|first1=Edd|date=5 June 2017|work=Rappler|accessdate=6 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The projected launch date was later adjusted at least twice; June 2018&lt;ref name=fail&gt;{{cite news |last1=Yee |first1=Jovic |title=Pinoy students fail to reach astronauts at space station |url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/969721/pinoy-students-fail-to-reach-astronauts-at-space-station |accessdate=2 June 2018 |work=Philippine Daily Inquirer |date=19 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later pushed forward to fourth quarter of 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Reyes |first1=Rizal Raoul |title=Russia’s elite space program opens doors to Filipino scholar |url=https://businessmirror.com.ph/russias-elite-space-program-opens-doors-to-filipino-scholar/ |accessdate=15 October 2018 |date=23 September 2018 |quote=Diwata 2 is expected to be launched in the last quarter of this year.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was announced that on October 26, 2018 the satellite would be launched to space via the [[H-IIA]] from Japan&lt;ref name="ptvnews"&gt;{{cite news |title=DOST to launch microsatellite to gather data on disasters |url=https://www.ptvnews.ph/dost-to-launch-microsatellite-to-gather-data-on-disasters/ |accessdate=27 October 2018 |work=PTV News |date=27 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[Tanegashima Space Center]] at around 13:08 and 13:20 ([[Japan Standard Time|JST]]).&lt;ref name="flyhigh"/&gt; Unlike [[Diwata-1]], Diwata-2 will be directly deployed from the rocket that will carry it from space and not from the [[International Space Station]] like its predecessor.&lt;ref name=fail/&gt;&lt;ref name="ptvnews"/&gt; The satellite, which will piggyback on the bigger Japanese satellite [[Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite|Gosat-2]] will be propelled to an elevation of {{convert|620|km|mi|abbr=on}} above sea level.&lt;ref name="flyhigh"/&gt;

On October 29, 2018, the satellite was launched directly into orbit at 13:51 ([[UTC+9]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Panela |first1=Shaira |title=PH-made microsatellite Diwata-2 flies into space |url=https://www.rappler.com/science-nature/earth-space/215468-philippine-made-microsatellite-diwata-2-space-launch-october-29-2018 |accessdate=29 October 2018 |work=Rappler |date=29 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Communication between the satellite and the DOST-ASTI's ground station in Quezon City was first established on October 29 at 21:52 ([[UTC+8]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Resurreccion |first1=Lyn |title=Diwata-2 makes first contact with receiving station in PHL |url=https://businessmirror.com.ph/diwata-2-makes-first-contact-with-receiving-station-in-phl/ |accessdate=2 November 2018 |work=BusinessMirror |date=1 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Diwata-2 will have the same mission as its predecessor, [[Diwata-1]]. It will have a [[Sun-synchronous orbit|sun-synchronous orbit]]&lt;ref name="diwata2better"/&gt; having been equip with an experimental sun sensor which would allow the operators to determine the position of the satellite in respective to the sun and it will orbit at an altitude of {{convert|620|km|mi|abbr=on}} above sea level. It will also have a fixed visit interval time unlike its predecessor, meaning it will hover above the same position on Earth for every 16 days. The satellite has a projected life expectancy of five years.&lt;ref name="flyhigh"/&gt;

[[File:Londinio Mogontio.jpg|thumb|A tablet from c. 65 AD, reading "Londinio Mogontio"- "In London, to Mogontius"]]

The name of [[London]] is derived from a word first attested, in Latinised form, as ''[[Londinium]]''. By the first century CE, this was a commercial centre in [[Roman Britain]].

The etymology of the name is uncertain. There is a long history of mythicising etymologies, such as the twelfth-century [[Historia Regum Britanniae]] asserting that the city's name is derived from the name of [[Lud son of Heli|King Lud]] who once controlled the city. However, in recent times a variety of alternative theories have also been proposed. As of 2017, the trend in scholarly publications supports derivation from a British Celtic form *[Londonjon], which would itself have been of Celtic origin.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Schrijver, &lt;i&gt;[[Language Contact and the Origins of the Germanic Languages]]&lt;/i&gt;, Routledge Studies in Linguistics, 13 (New York: Routledge, 2014), p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Theodora Bynon, 'London's Name', ''Transactions of the Philological Society'', 114:3 (2016), 281–97, doi: 10.1111/1467-968X.12064.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attested forms==
[[Richard Coates]], in the 1998 article where he published his own theory of the etymology, lists all the known occurrences of the name up to around the year 900, in [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Latin language|Latin]], [[British language (Celtic)|British]] and [[Anglo-Saxon language|Anglo-Saxon]].&lt;ref name=coates&gt;{{cite journal|last=Coates|first=Richard|year=1998|title=A new explanation of the name of London|journal=Transactions of the Philological Society|volume=96|issue=2|pages=203–229|url=http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/1467-968X.00027|doi=10.1111/1467-968X.00027}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the older sources begin with ''Londin-'' (Λονδίνιον, ''Londino'', ''[[Londinium]]'' etc.), though there are some in ''Lundin-''. Later examples are mostly ''Lundon-'' or ''London-'', and all the Anglo-Saxon examples have ''Lunden-'' with various terminations. He observes that the modern spelling with &amp;lt;o&gt; derives from a medieval writing habit of avoiding &amp;lt;u&gt; between letters composed of [[minim (palaeography)|minim]]s.

The earliest written mention of London occurs in a letter discovered in London in 2016. Dated AD 65–80, it reads ''Londinio Mogontio'' which translates to "In London, to Mogontius".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.archaeology.co.uk/articles/features/earliest-written-reference-to-london-found.htm "Earliest written reference to London found"], on ''Current Archaeology'', 1 June 2016.

Retrieved on 26 January 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Phonology==
Coates (1998) asserts that "It is quite clear that these vowel letters in the earliest forms [viz., ''Londinium'', ''Lundinium''], both &amp;lt;o&gt; and &amp;lt;u&gt;, represent phonemically long vowel sounds". He observes that the ending in Latin sources before 600 is always ''-inium'', which points to a British double termination ''-in-jo-n''.

It has long been observed that the Anglo-Saxon form ''Lunden'' and the Welsh name  {{lang|cy|Llundein}} cannot be directly derived from [[Common Brittonic]] ''*Londinjon''. Following regular sound changes in the two languages, Welsh would have had *''Lunnen'' or similar, and Old English would have *''Lynden'' via [[I-mutation|''i''-mutation]].&lt;ref name="Schrijver "&gt;Peter Schrijver, ''[[Language Contact and the Origins of the Germanic Languages]]'' (2013), p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt;

Coates (1998) tentatively accepts the argument by Jackson (1938)&lt;ref name=jackson&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jackson|first=Kenneth H.|journal=Antiquity|title=Nennius and the 28 cities of Britain|volume=12|pages=44–55|year=1938}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the British form was ''-on-jo-n'', with the change to ''-inium'' unexplained. Coates speculates further that the first ''-i-'' could have arisen by [[Metathesis (linguistics)|metathesis]] of the ''-i-'' in the last syllable of his own suggested etymon (see below).

[[Peter Schrijver]] (2013) by way of explaining the medieval forms  ''Lunden'' and ''Llundein'' considers two possibilities:
* In the local dialect of Lowland British Celtic, which later became extinct, ''-ond-'' became ''-und-'' regularly, and ''-ī-'' became ''-ei-'', leading to ''Lundeinjon'', later ''Lundein''. The Welsh and English forms were then borrowed from this. This hypothesis requires that the Latin form have a long ''ī'': ''Londīnium''.
* The early [[British Latin]] dialect probably developed similarly as the dialect of Gaul (the ancestor of [[Old French]]). In particular, Latin stressed short ''i'' developed first into close-mid {{IPA|/e/}}, then diphthongised to {{IPA|/ei/}}. The combination ''-ond-'' also developed regularly into ''-und-'' in pre-Old French. Thus, he concludes, the remaining Romans of Britain would have pronounced the name as ''Lundeiniu'', later ''Lundein'', from which the Welsh and English forms were then borrowed. This hypothesis requires that the Latin form have a short ''i'': ''Londinium''.

Schrijver therefore concludes that the name of ''Londinium'' underwent phonological changes in a local dialect (either British Celtic or British Latin) and that the recorded medieval forms in Welsh and Anglo-Saxon would have been derived from that dialectal pronunciation.

==Proposed etymologies==

===Celtic===
Coates says (p.&amp;nbsp;211) that "The earliest non-mythic speculation ... centred on the possibility of deriving London from Welsh {{lang|cy|Llyn din}}, supposedly 'lake fort' (? or 'fort lake'). But {{lang|cy|llyn}} derives from British ''*Lind-'', which is incompatible with all the early attestations.&lt;ref name=coates/&gt; Another suggestion, published in ''[[The Geographical Journal]]'' in 1899, is that the area of London was previously settled by [[Belgae]] who named their outposts after townships in [[Belgium]]. Some of these Belgic toponyms have been attributed to the namesake of London including ''[[Limé]]'', ''[[Douvrend]]'', and ''[[Londinières]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=rDAMAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA299 | work = The Geographical Journal | year = 1899}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marie Henri d'Arbois de Jubainville|H. D'Arbois de Jubainville]] suggested in 1899 that the name meant ''Londino's fortress''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=D'Arbois de Jubainville|first=H|year=1899|title=La Civilisation des Celtes et celle de l'épopée homérique|publisher=Albert Fontemoing|location=Paris|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; But Coates argues that there is no such personal name recorded, and that D'Arbois' suggested etymology for it (from Celtic ''*londo-'', 'fierce') would have a short vowel. Coates notes that this theory was repeated by linguistics up to the 1960s, and more recently still in less specialist works. It was revived in 2013 by Peter Schrijver, who suggested that the sense of the proto-Indo-European root *''lend&lt;sup&gt;h&lt;/sup&gt;-'' ('sink, cause to sink'), which gave rise to the Celtic noun *''londos'' ('a subduing'), survived in Celtic. Combined with the Celtic suffix *-''injo''- (used to form singular nouns from collective ones), this could explain a Celtic form *''londinjon'' 'place that floods (periodically, tidally)'. This, in Schrijver's reading, would more readily explain all the Latin, Welsh, and English forms.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Schrijver, &lt;i&gt;[[Language Contact and the Origins of the Germanic Languages]]&lt;/i&gt;, Routledge Studies in Linguistics, 13 (New York: Routledge, 2014), p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar approaches to Schrijver's have been taken by [[Theodora Bynon]], who in 2016 supported a similar Celtic etymology, while demonstrating that the place-name was borrowed into the [[West Germanic]] ancestor-language of Old English, not into Old English itself.&lt;ref&gt;Theodora Bynon, 'London's Name', ''Transactions of the Philological Society'', 114:3 (2016), 281–97, doi: 10.1111/1467-968X.12064.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-Celtic===
Among the first scientific explanations was one by Giovanni Alessio in 1951.&lt;ref name=coates/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|last=Alessio|first=Giovanni|title=L'origine du nom de Londres|booktitle=Actes et Mémoires du troisième congrès international de toponymie et d'anthroponymie|location=Louvain|publisher=Instituut voor naamkunde|language=fr|year=1951|pages=223–224}}&lt;/ref&gt; He proposed a [[Ligurian language (ancient)|Ligurian]] rather than a Celtic origin, with a root ''*lond-/lont-'' meaning 'mud' or 'marsh'. Coates' major criticisms are that this does not have the required long vowel (an alternative form Alessio proposes, ''*lōna'', has the long vowel, but lacks the required consonant), and that there is no evidence of Ligurian in Britain.

Jean-Gabriel Gigot in a 1974 article discusses the toponym of [[Saint-Martin-de-Londres]], a commune in the French [[Hérault (département)|Hérault département]]. Gigot derives this ''Londres'' from a Germanic root  ''*lohna'', and argues that the British toponym may also be from that source.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Notes sur le toponyme "Londres" (Hérault)|last=Gigot|first=Jean-Gabriel|journal=Revue international d'onomastique|volume=26|year=1974|pages=284–292}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coates (1998) proposes a [[Common Brittonic]] form of either ''*Lōondonjon'' or ''*Lōnidonjon'', which would have become ''*Lūndonjon'' and hence ''Lūndein'' or ''Lūndyn''. An advantage of the form ''*Lōnidonjon'' is that it could account for Latin ''Londinium'' by [[Metathesis (linguistics)|metathesis]] to ''*Lōnodinjon''. The etymology of this ''*Lōondonjon'' would however lie in [[pre-Celtic]] [[Old European hydronymy]], from a hydronym ''*Plowonida'', which would have been applied to the Thames where it becomes too wide to ford, in the vicinity of London. The settlement on its banks would then be named from the hydronym with the suffix ''-on-jon'', giving ''*Plowonidonjon'' and [[Insular Celtic]] ''*Lowonidonjon''.

The name of the river itself would be derived from the [[Indo-European root]]s ''*plew-'' "to flow, swim; boat" and  ''*nejd-'' "to flow", found in various river names around Europe.  Coates does admit that compound names are comparatively rare for rivers in the Indo-European area, but they are not entirely unknown.&lt;ref name=coates/&gt; Lacey Wallace describes the derivation as "somewhat tenuous".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gbMkBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA8&amp;lpg=PA8&amp;dq=%22plowonida%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=5VMiS5rite&amp;sig=EcOvXFRkzj0qqr7OOnMfrpnbQdQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj1opLGoJ7NAhXoJcAKHQHtDls4ChDoAQgrMAU#v=onepage&amp;q=%22plowonida%22&amp;f=false|first=Lacey|last=Wallace|page=8|title=The Origin of Roman London|year=2015|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location =Cambridge, UK|isbn=9781107047570}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Museum of London]] is more positive, stating on its web site "philologists now equate the name with the Indo-European word 'plowonida', meaning 'fast-flowing river' and referring to the Thames".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.museumoflondon.org.uk/MuseumOfLondon/Templates/microsites/londinium/article.aspx?NRMODE=Published&amp;NRNODEGUID=%7B43F5954B-D51C-4FAF-AF8D-63644DECA2D6%7D&amp;NRORIGINALURL=%2FLondinium%2Fanalysis%2Fpubliclife%2Fadministration%2F4%2BLondin.htm&amp;NRCACHEHINT=NoModifyGuest|title=From Londinium to London|publisher=Museum of London|accessdate=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The display on Roman London in the museum state the etymology as fact.

==Historical and popular suggestions==
The earliest account of the toponym's derivation can be attributed to [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]]. In ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]'', the name is described as originating from [[Lud son of Heli|King Lud]], who seized the city [[Trinovantum]] and ordered it to be renamed in his honour as ''Kaerlud''. This was then eventually slurred into ''Karelundein'' and then ''London''. However, Geoffrey's work contains many fanciful suppositions about place-name derivation and the suggestion has no basis in linguistics.&lt;ref name=legend&gt;[http://chr.org.uk/legends.htm Legends of London's Origins&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other fanciful theories over the years have been:
* [[William Camden]] reportedly suggested that the name might come from [[Common Brittonic|Brythonic]] ''lhwn'' (modern Welsh {{lang|cy|Llwyn}}), meaning "grove", and "town". Thus, giving the origin as ''Lhwn Town'', translating to "city in the grove".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=lqkHAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA4 | title = The history and antiquities of Highgate, Middlesex | author1 = Prickett | first1 = Frederick | year = 1842}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* John Jackson, writing in the ''[[Gentleman's Magazine]]'' in 1792,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jackson|first=John|year=1792|journal=The Gentleman's Magazine|title=Conjecture on the Etymology of London|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xj8lAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA453&amp;lpg=PA453&amp;dq=%22etymology+of+london%22|publisher=Longman, Hurst, Rees, Orme, and Brown}}&lt;/ref&gt; challenges the ''Llyn din'' theory (see below) on geographical grounds, and suggests instead a derivation from {{lang|cy|Glynn din}} – presumably intended as 'valley city'.
* Some [[British Israelism|British Israelites]] claimed that the Anglo-Saxons, assumed to be descendants of the [[Tribe of Dan]], named their settlement ''lan-dan'', meaning "abode of Dan" in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=English words of supposed Hebrew origin in George Crabb's ''English Synonymes|last=Gold|first=David L|journal=American Speech|year=1979|volume=51|pages=61–64|issue=1|doi=10.2307/454531|jstor=454531|publisher=Duke University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* An unsigned article in ''The Cambro Briton'' for 1821&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=The Cambro Briton|title=Etymology of 'London'|year=1821|pages=42–43|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tnEEAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA42}}&lt;/ref&gt; supports the suggestion of ''Luna din'' ('moon fortress'), and also mentions in passing the possibility of ''Llong din'' ('ship fortress').
* Several theories were discussed in the pages of ''[[Notes and Queries]]'' on 27 December 1851,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=DuX6reRuEaMC&amp;pg=PA505&amp;lpg=PA505&amp;dq=%22etymology+of+london%22 | title = Notes and Queries | year = 1852}}&lt;/ref&gt; including ''Luandun'' (supposedly "city of the moon", a reference to the temple of [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]] supposed to have stood on the site of [[St Paul's Cathedral]]), and ''Lan Dian'' or ''Llan Dian'' ("temple of Diana"). Another correspondent dismissed these, and reiterated the common ''Llyn din'' theory.
* In ''The Cymry of '76'' (1855),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Cymry of '76|last=Jones|first=Alexander|year=1855|publisher=Sheldon, Lamport|location=New York|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NFLJNoaq4G4C&amp;pg=PA132&amp;lpg=PA132&amp;dq=%22etymology+of+london%22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander Jones says that the Welsh name derives from ''Llyn Dain'', meaning 'pool of the Thames'.
* An 1887 Handbook for Travellers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|year=1887|title=London and Its Environs: Handbook for Travellers|last=Baedeker|first=Karl|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EawMAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA60|publisher=K. Baedeker}}&lt;/ref&gt; asserts that "The etymology of London is the same as that of Lincoln" (Latin {{lang|la|Lindum}}).
* The general [[Henri Nicolas Frey]], in his 1894 book ''Annamites et extrême-occidentaux: recherches sur l'origine des langues'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Annamites et extrême-occidentaux: recherches sur l'origine des langues.|last=Henry|first=Frey|year=1894|publisher=Hachette et Cie|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SxkTAAAAYAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; emphasises the similarity between the name of the city and the two Vietnamese words lœun and dœun which can both mean "low, inferior, muddy".
* [[Edward P. Cheney]], in his 1904 book ''A Short History of England'' (p.&amp;nbsp;18), attributes the origin of the name to [[dun]]: "Elevated and easily defensible spots were chosen [in pre-Roman times], earthworks thrown up, always in a circular form, and palisades placed upon these. Such a fortification was called a dun, and London and the names of many other places still preserve that termination in varying forms."
* ''A New Variorum Edition of Shakespeare'' (1918)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A New Variorum Edition of Shakespeare''|year=1918|last=Furness (ed)|first=Horace Howard|publisher=J B Lippincott &amp;amp; co|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3UgvAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA175|isbn=0-486-21187-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; mentions a variant on Geoffrey's suggestion being ''Lud's town'', although refutes it saying that the origin of the name was most likely [[Old English language|Saxon]].

[[File:Florida Platform02.png|thumb|right|250px|Depiction of Florida Platform with depths]]
The '''Florida Platform''' is a flat geological feature with the emergent portion forming the [[Florida]] [[peninsula]].

==Structure==
The platform forms a [[Defensive wall|rampart]] between the [[Gulf of Mexico]] and the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. The platform's western edge, or '''Florida Escarpment''', is normally defined where water depths at {{convert|300|ft}} drop dramatically and in a short distance to {{convert|10000|ft}}. The [[Florida peninsula]] is located on the eastern side of the platform, where in places it lies only {{convert|3|to|4|mi}} from the platform's edge. On the Gulf side the platform ends over {{convert|100|mi}} to the west of the modern shoreline, where a massive cliff rises over {{convert|6000|ft}} from the {{convert|10600|ft}} depth of the Gulf floor. The western reaches of the platform just off [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]] were explored by the submersible [[DSV Alvin]]. Examination has placed the depth of [[carbonate]] rocks at greater than {{convert|20000|ft}}.

==Geology==

===Basement===
The platform's basement rocks include [[Precambrian]]-[[Cambrian]] [[igneous rock]]s, [[Ordovician]]-[[Devonian]] [[sedimentary rock]]s, and [[Triassic]]-[[Jurassic]] [[volcanic rock]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur, J. D., 1988, Petrogenesis of Early Mesozoic tholeiite in the Florida basement and overview of Florida basement geology: Florida Geological Survey Report of Investigation 97, 39 p.&lt;/ref&gt; Florida's igneous and sedimentary foundation separated from what is now the [[African Plate]] when the super-continent [[Pangea]] rifted apart in the Triassic and possibly pre-Middle Jurassic. It then secured to the [[North American craton]].&lt;ref&gt;Smith, D.L., 1982, Review of the tectonic history of the Florida basement: ''Tectonophysics'', v. 88, p. 1-22.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the early geologic structures is the [[Peninsular Arch]] which formed during the Jurassic.

===Emergent portion===
The oldest sediments that are exposed are [[Middle Eocene]] carbonates found in the [[Avon Park Formation]]. Most of the state of Florida is covered by [[Pliocene]], [[Pleistocene]], and [[Holocene]] [[siliciclastic]]-bearing sediments deposited during sea-level fluctuations and filling in of the [[Gulf Trough]] beginning in the late [[Tertiary]] and [[Quaternary]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5973">The '''geology of [[Denmark]]''' includes 12 kilometers of unmetamorphosed sediments lie atop the [[Precambrian]] Fennoscandian Shield, the Norwegian-Scottish Caledonides and buried North German-Polish Caledonides. The stable Fennoscandian Shield formed from 1.45 billion years ago to 850 million years ago in the [[Proterozoic]]. The Fennoscandian Border Zone is a large fault, bounding the deep basement rock of the Danish Basin—a trough between the Border Zone and the Ringkobing-Fyn High. The Sorgenfrei-Tornquist Zone is a fault-bounded area displaying Cretaceous-Cenozoic inversion. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Moores, E.M.; Fairbridge, Rhodes W.|year=1997|title=Encyclopedia of European &amp; Asian Regional Geology|publisher=Springer|p=183-190}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geologic History, Stratigraphy &amp; Tectonics==
===Paleozoic (541-251 million years ago)===
[[Cambrian]] rocks record successive [[marine transgression]] and regression events. Feldspar-rich red bed sandstones deposited in windy floodplains followed by layers of glauconite-rich marine sandstones and offshore siltstone. Black alum shales deposited in the mid-Cambrian in a nearly anoxic epeireic basin with limestone layers, rich in [[trilobite]] fossils. Condensed, shallow limestone succeeded the black shales in the [[Ordovician]], with numerous [[graptolite]] fossils.

[[Devonian]] rocks have never been found in Denmark and marine [[Carboniferous]] rocks are only known from drill holes at the southern edge of the Ringkobing-Fyn High, which formed at the time as a bulging area north of the Variscan collision zone. 

Rotational block faulting in the Late Carboniferous resulted from Variscan wrench deformation, active along the Sorgenfrei-Tornquist Zone. Syn-rift clastic wedges began to accumulate in an emerging half-graben. Continental [[red beds]] deposited and volcanism occurred. 
Regional sagging began in the mid-Permian, leaving the Ringkobing-Fyn High as a high point. Marine transgression began, connecting the region with a narrow seaway to the Shetland Islands. The Danish Basin and the neighboring North German Basin were both highly saline and brackish, leaving behind carbonate and anhydrite layers on southern edge of the High. Up to 1.2 kilometers of [[halite]] accumulated in the North Permian Basin, thinning toward the Fennoscandian Border Zone. Subsequent salt tectonism has produced salt diapirs 10 kilometers in diameter, rising five kilometers through overhead rock and some are less than 200 meters deep in Quaternary rocks. {{sfn| Moores, E.M.; Fairbridge, Rhodes W.|1997|p=184-187}}
	
===Mesozoic (251-66 million years ago)===
North-south rifting with the breakup of [[Pangea]] in the [[Triassic]] segmented the Ringkobing-Fyn High into a narrow graben. Sedimentation occurred in fault-bound alluvial fan deposits with occasional small marine transgressions, such as the Muschekalk Sea in the mid-Triassic in the Ringkobing-Fyn High. Triassic outcrops are only found on southern shore of Bornholm. Extensional faulting occurred throughout the [[Mesozoic]], but overall, conditions remained the same into the [[Cretaceous]]. Oscillating marine transgressions in the [[Rhaetian]] to [[Middle Jurassic]] shifted deposition from delta sands to offshore mudstones and regional updoming took place at the junction of the Central Graben, Moray Firth and Viking Graben. Deltas were drowned and replaced with deepwater basins and major rifting in the Late Jurassic produced block tilting. 

Sedimentation shifted in [[Albian]] through [[Danian]] times from siliclastic to carbonaceous, marked by [[marl]] and glauconite sandstones. Sea level fell in the [[Maastrichtian]], restricting the sea to deeper areas of the Central Graben. The Stevns Klint type locality contains the Fish Clay with an iridium anomaly indicative at the [[K-Pg mass extinction]]. {{sfn| Moores, E.M.; Fairbridge, Rhodes W.|1997|p=187}}

===Cenozoic (66 million years ago-present)===
During the Damian Stage, carbonate deposit stopped, bringing an erosional unconformity. As the [[Selandian]] transgressive phase got underway [[glauconite]] sand and older, reworked Cretaceous and Devonian sediments deposited, overlain by pelagic [[smectite]] clay. Erosion in the [[Neogene]] and [[Pleistocene]] has eroded most rock units that would likely have indicated open marine conditions. A break in sedimentation in the [[Oligocene]] was followed by a marine transgression and sediment accumulated in the Danish Basin, with significant coarse quartz sand compared to older Paleogene clays. 

The deepest point of deposition—the depocenter—moved toward the North Sea and Central Graben during the Oligocene and the coastline shifted to the Fennoscandian Border Zone in Jylland. This was a result of regional uplift of the Norwegian Caledonides and the Fennoscandian Shield. The Caledonides were actually eroded to a nearly flat [[peneplain]] by the Permian and so the uplift was a non-orogenic and comparatively recent one. Shallow marine deposition continued until the [[Pleistocene]] with increasing sand and coal from the [[Miocene]]. Up to three kilometers of sand accumulated in the Central Graben. 

During the Pleistocene the region was glaciated multiple times, leaving glaciofluvial plains in the west and clay soils in the east. Isostatic rebound and post-glacial thin-skinned folding and thrusting have been common geologic forces in the [[Holocene]]. {{sfn| Moores, E.M.; Fairbridge, Rhodes W.|1997|p=188-189}}

==Natural resource geology==
Denmark has few natural resources although some small oil and gas fields have been found offshore since the 1970s. Gravel, sand, and chalk are all mined for building material and in North Jylland plastic clay and [[diatomite]] are extracted as insolation material. {{sfn| Moores, E.M.; Fairbridge, Rhodes W.|1997|p=189}}

{{wiktionary|ghyll}}
A '''gill''' or '''ghyll''' is a [[ravine]] or narrow valley in the North of England and other parts of the United Kingdom. The word originates from the [[Old Norse]] {{lang|non|gil}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Anderson | first1 = G. K. | title = Two Ballads from Nineteenth Century Ohio | journal = The Journal of American Folklore | volume = 51 | issue = 199 | pages = 38–46 | doi = 10.2307/535942 | year = 1938 | pmid =  | pmc = }} "I suggest-and it is only a tentative suggestion-that "g(u)ile" is "gill," spelled by Wordsworth "ghyll,"
a ravine or valley inclosing a small water-course."&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include [[Dufton]] Ghyll Wood, [[Dungeon Ghyll]], [[Troller's Gill]] and [[Trow Ghyll skeleton|Trow Ghyll]]. As a related usage, [[Gaping Gill]] is the name of a cave, not the associated stream, and [[Cowgill, Cumbria|Cowgill]], [[Masongill]] and [[Halton Gill]] are derived names of villages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.daelnet.co.uk/placenames/index.cfm Daelnet placenames index], accessed 1 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[stream]] flowing through a gill is often referred to as a ''beck'': for example in [[Swaledale]], Gunnerside Beck flows through Gunnerside Ghyll. ''Beck ''is also used as a more general term for streams in the north of England – examples include [[Aisgill|Ais Gill Beck]] and [[Arkle Beck]]. In the [[North Pennines]], the word ''sike'' or ''syke''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/archiveDS/archiveDownload?t=arch-2055-1/dissemination/pdf/Article_Level_Pdf/tcwaas/001/1886/vol8/tcwaas_001_1886_vol8_0039.pdf|title=The earthworks and keep, Appleby Castle}}&lt;/ref&gt; is found in similar circumstances. This is particularly common in the [[Appleby Fells]] area where sikes significantly outnumber the becks and gills; it can also be seen in the name of [[Eden Sike Cave]] in [[Mallerstang]].

In the [[High Weald]] gills are deeply cut ravines, usually with a stream in the base&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://publications.naturalengland.org.uk/file/5851972632576000|title=National Character Area profile:122: High Weald|isbn=978-1-78367-068-0|author=Natural England|author-link=Natural England}}&lt;/ref&gt; which eroded the ravine.  These gills may be up to {{convert|200|ft}} deep, which represents a significant physiographic feature in lowland England.&lt;ref&gt;Rose F &amp; Patmore J M (1997) "Weald Gill Woodlands"&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gotska Sandön''' (literally translated as [[Gotland]]ic Sand Island) is an uninhabited [[Sweden|Swedish]] island, since 1909 also a [[List of national parks of Sweden|national park]], situated {{convert|38|km|mi|abbr=on}} north of [[Fårö]] in the [[Baltic Sea]]. Legally a part of [[Gotland]] province, it is approximately {{convert|9|km|mi|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|6|km|mi|abbr=on}} wide, with a total area of approximately {{convert|36|sqkm|sqmi|abbr=on}}. The island consists mostly of sand and is dominated by beaches, dunes and especially pine forests. Aside from a colony of [[grey seal]]s, the higher [[fauna]] is not very rich. Terrestrial or aerial mammals contain [[bat]]s and [[mountain hare]]s. However, the island is home to many rare insects and plants, including the [[Vicia#Selected species|Kashubian vetch]] and several species of [[Orchidaceae|orchid]]. During the summer, there are regular boat tours from [[Fårö]] Island and [[Nynäshamn]] on the mainland.

== Climate ==
Despite its isolation from sizeable landmasses, Gotska Sandön's [[oceanic climate]] is warm for its latitude. The [[Scandinavian Peninsula]] to the west contributes to warmer summers and frequent winter frost, giving the island a far broader temperature range than, for example, the similarly isolated [[Fair Isle]], which lies one degree further north some distance off the coast of [[Scotland]]. In spite of this range, summer highs are cool by the standards of southern Sweden, and winter nights are among the mildest in the country.

Gotska Sandön has significant [[seasonal lag]]: despite dwindling daylight hours, August is much warmer than June, while March days are both longer and colder than those in December.

An '''inverted river delta''' is special category of [[river delta]] in which the narrow end of the delta emerges on the seafront and the wide end is located further inland, so that with respect to the seafront, the locations of both ends of the delta are inverted.

== Explanation ==
[[Image:Wpdms usgs photo sacramento delta 2.jpg|thumb|225px|right|A picture of California's [[Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta]], with [[Suisun Bay]] at left-center and the [[Carquinez Strait]] at far left]]

River deltas typically form on flat, coastal floodplains: the narrow end located at the point where a river fans out and deposits sediment in a region extending outward into the body of water which the river empties. In the case of an inverted delta, the delta is located at the waterway's exit from a large, flat valley, yet still inside the valley. The sediment is dropped within the valley and the clear water then exits into a bay or the ocean, so the apex of the delta is at this exit, a configuration said to be [[:wikt:inverted|inverted]] from that usually seen. Inverted deltas typically do not last long in geological terms, since they tend to fill up with sediments rather quickly and eventually become normal deltas.

== Examples ==
===The Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta===
A classic example of an inverted river delta is the [[Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta]], which lies at the confluence of the [[Sacramento River|Sacramento]] and [[San Joaquin River|San Joaquin]] rivers in [[California]].  The water from the rivers that drain the entire, large [[California Central Valley]] exit through the [[Carquinez Strait]], a narrow gap in the [[California Coast Ranges|Coast Range]].  An inverted river delta exists behind this strait.

===The Tagus River===
Another example is the delta of the [[Tagus]] river in Portugal, although due to sedimentation this delta is now only very partially inverted, with the valley now mostly filled with sediment. It is still about 15 km wide and 25 km long, compared with the 2 km wide exit into the sea, and forms a large lagoon with large and very shallow sand banks which go uncovered during low tides. The delta used to be even bigger thousands of years ago.

The '''Korea Strait''' is a [[strait|sea passage]] between [[South Korea]] and [[Japan]], connecting the [[East China Sea]], the [[Yellow Sea]] (West sea) and the [[Sea of Japan]] (East sea) in the northwest [[Pacific Ocean]]. The strait is split by the [[Tsushima Island]] into the Western Channel and the [[Tsushima Strait]] or Eastern Channel.

==Geography==
To the north it is bounded by the southern coast of the [[Korean Peninsula]], and to the south by the southwestern [[Japanese islands]] of [[Kyūshū]] and [[Honshū]]. It is about {{convert|200|km|mi|abbr=on}} wide and averages about 90 to 100&amp;nbsp;meters (300&amp;nbsp;ft) deep.

Tsushima Island divides the Korea Strait into the western channel and the Tsushima Strait. The western channel is deeper (up to 227&amp;nbsp;meters) and narrower than the Tsushima Strait.

==Currents==
A branch of the [[Kuroshio Current]] passes through the strait. Its warm branch is sometimes called the Tsushima Current. Originating along the Japanese islands this current passes through the [[Sea of Japan]] then divides along either shore of  [[Sakhalin|Sakhalin Island]], eventually flowing into the northern Pacific Ocean via the strait north of [[Hokkaidō]] and into the [[Sea of Okhotsk]] north of Sakhalin Island near [[Vladivostok]]. The water-mass characteristics vary widely because of the low-salinity waters of the southeast coasts of Korea and China.

==Economic significance==
Numerous international shipping lanes pass through the strait, including those carrying much of the traffic bound for the ports of southern South Korea. Both South Korea and Japan have restricted their territorial claims in the strait to {{convert|3|nmi|km}} from shore, so as to permit free passage through it.{{Ref|vandyke2}}{{Ref|vandyke3}}

Passenger ferries travel numerous routes across the strait. Commercial ferries run from South Korean [[Busan]], [[Geoje]] to Japanese ports including [[Fukuoka, Fukuoka|Fukuoka]], [[Tsushima, Nagasaki|Tsushima]], [[Shimonoseki, Yamaguchi|Shimonoseki]], and [[Hiroshima]]. Ferries also connect [[Tsushima Island]] with Fukuoka, and South Korea's [[Jeju Island]] with the Korean mainland. Ferries connecting Busan and Japanese cities with ports in [[China]] also traverse the strait.

Japan's territorial waters extend to three nautical miles (5.6&amp;nbsp;km) into the strait instead of the usual twelve, reportedly to allow [[Nuclear weapon|nuclear]]-armed [[United States Navy]] warships and submarines to transit the strait without violating Japan's prohibition against nuclear weapons in its territory.&lt;ref&gt;[[Kyodo News]], "[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20090622a1.html Japan left key straits open for U.S. nukes]", ''[[Japan Times]]'', June 22, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historic impact==
===Land bridge===
:''See article'': [[Land bridge]]
During the [[Pleistocene]] glacial cycles, the Korea Strait and the [[Bering Strait]]s, and the [[Yellow Sea]] (West sea) were often narrowed and the [[Japanese islands]] may at times have been connected to the [[Eurasia|Eurasian Continent]] through the [[Korean Peninsula]] or [[Sakhalin]]. At times, the [[Korea sea|East sea]] was said to be a frozen inner lake due to the lack of warm [[Tsushima Current]] and various plants and large animals, such as the ''[[Palaeoloxodon naumanni]]'' are believed to have spread into Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Park|first=S.-C. |author2=Yoo, D.-G. |author3=Lee, C.-W. |author4=Lee, E.-I. |title=Last glacial sea-level changes and paleogeography of the Korea (Tsushima) Strait|journal=Geo-Marine Letters|date=26 September 2000|volume=20|issue=2|pages=64–71|doi=10.1007/s003670000039}}&lt;!--|accessdate=2 April 2011--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early history===
Historically, these narrows served as a highway for high risk voyages. The shortest distance between Busan, South Korea, and the Tsushima Island is about 50&amp;nbsp;km, as is the shortest distance from Tsushima to [[Iki Island]], Japan.

Japan's [[Yamatai]] periodically sent year-long embassies to Chinese dynasties, believed to have traveled through the Korean strait and the Korean peninsula, to obtain the latest culture and technologies. In the 6th century, [[Buddhism]] ([[Mahayana|Mahāyāna Buddhism]]) was transmitted by [[Baekje]] people to the easternmost Japan of the [[Emperor Kinmei]]'s era over this strait (''See also'': [[East Asian Buddhism]] and [[Buddhism in Japan]]).

===Mongolian invasion===
:''See main article'': [[Mongol invasions of Japan]]
A joint Mongol-Korea fleet crossed this strait and attempted to invade Japan in 1274 and 1281. The force severely ravaged the [[Tsushima Island]] on the way to Japan but failed to defeat Japan. The [[typhoon]] (''[[kamikaze]]'', usually translated as "''divine wind''") is said to have saved Japan from a [[Mongol]] invasion fleet led by [[Kublai Khan]] in 1281.

===Wokou and Ōei Invasion===
:''See main article'': [[Wokou]] and [[Ōei Invasion]]
After the Mongolian invasion ravaged Tsushima, it became a base of the Wokou (Japanese pirates). The Korean [[Joseon Dynasty]] sent a fleet to Tsushima in 1419 for the suppression of Wokou activity. Korea subsequently agreed to grant the Japanese limited trading privileges.

===Battle of Tsushima===
:''See main article'': [[Battle of Tsushima]]
The Battle of Tsushima, fought between the Japanese and Russian navies on May 27 and May 28, 1905, took place in the Tsushima Strait part of the Korea Strait, east of the north part of Tsushima and due north of Iki Island. The Russian fleet was virtually destroyed by the Japanese.

===Battle of Korea Strait===
{{main|Battle of Korea Strait}}
The [[Battle of Korea Strait]] was a naval battle fought on the first day of the [[Korean War]], 25–26 June 1950, between the navies of [[South Korea]] and [[North Korea]]. A North Korean [[troop transport]] carrying hundreds of soldiers attempted to land its cargo near [[Busan]] but was encountered by a South Korean [[patrol ship]] and sunk. It was one of the first surface actions of the war and resulted in an important South Korean victory.&lt;ref name="J.

===Future===
The possibility of a [[Japan–Korea Undersea Tunnel]] or bridge, similar to the [[Channel Tunnel]] running under the [[English Channel]] between [[France]] and the [[United Kingdom]], has been discussed for decades.

==Standards==
===Presidential standards===
Throughout the republican era, the Standard of the [[President of Egypt]] has been identical to the national flag, with the addition of the [[Coat of arms of Egypt|coat of arms]] (eagle or hawk) in the upper-left corner.&lt;ref name="Ansary 146"/&gt; Even though the [[Constitution of Egypt]] states that the President is the Supreme Commander of the [[Egyptian Armed Forces|Armed Forces]] (article 150), the flag of the Supreme Commander differs from the Presidential Standard. It is identical to the national flag, with the addition in the upper-left corner of a white Eagle of Saladin contained between two crossed swords. The Supreme Commander also has his own naval ensign, air force flag and air defence flag. Military ordinances state that the flags of the Supreme Commander must be hoisted during the President's visits to each military unit. The national flag must be hoisted in the middle, with the Presidential Standard on its right side, and the flag of the Supreme Commander on its left side.&lt;ref name="Ansary 147"&gt;[[#Ans01|el Ansary 2001]], p. 147&lt;/ref&gt;

Their rivals chose other colours in reaction; among these, forces loyal to [[Marwan II]] adopted red. {{cite book | author=Patricia Crone | title=The Nativist Prophets of Early Islam |year=2012 |page=122}}.  The choice of black as the colour of the Abbasid Revolution was already motivated by the "black standards out of Khorasan" tradition associated with the [[Mahdi]]. The contrast of white vs. black as the Umayyad vs. Abbasid dynastic colour over time developed in white as the colour of Shia Islam and black as the colour of Sunni Islam: "The proselytes of the ʿAbbasid revolution took full advantage of the eschatological expectations raised by black banners in their campaign to undermine the Umayyad dynasty from within. Even after the ʿAbbasids had triumphed over the Umayyads in 750, they continued to deploy black as their dynastic colour; not only the banners but the headdresses and garments of the ʿAbbasid caliphs were black [...] The ubiquitous black created a striking contrast with the banners and dynastic color of the Umayyads, which had been white [...] The Ismaili Shiʿite counter-caliphate founded by the Fatimids took white as its dynastic color, creating a visual contrast to the ʿAbbasid enemy [...] white became the Shiʿite color, in deliberate opposition to the black of the ʿAbbasid 'establishment'." Jane Hathaway, ''A Tale of Two Factions: Myth, Memory, and Identity in Ottoman Egypt and Yemen'', 2012,  [https://books.google.com/books?id=L-lPC7DgepEC&amp;pg=PA96 p. 97f.]  After the revolution, Islamic apocalyptic circles admitted that the Abbasid banners would be black but asserted that the Mahdi's standard would be black and larger. David Cook (2002). ''Studies in Muslim Apocalyptic'', p. 153.
Anti-Abbasid circles cursed "the black banners from the East", "first and last". {{cite book | author=Patricia Crone | title=The Nativist Prophets of Early Islam |year=2012 |page=243}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Original research|date=August 2017}}

This is a '''list of the European cities with the highest [[population density]]'''. The population, population density, and land area for the cities listed are based on the entire [[city proper]], the defined boundary or border of a [[city]] or the city limits of the city. The population density of the cities listed is based on the average number of people living per square mile or per square kilometer. This list does not refer to the population, population density, or land area of the greater [[metropolitan area]] or [[urban area]] and also does not target a particular city district of any of the cities listed.

Of course there exist parts of every city which are denser than the average.  It has been noted that especially dense sections of cities exist in the suburbs of Barcelona, in certain Parisian arrondissements and in Inner London.&lt;ref&gt;http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Urban_Europe_%E2%80%94_statistics_on_cities,_towns_and_suburbs_%E2%80%94_life_in_cities&lt;/ref&gt;  This list, however, is of the average densities of cities.

Given that the status of the UK within the EU is in a state of flux, its top 4 most densely populated cities are counted separately within the list.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10416">This is a list of the '''mammal species recorded in Saint Lucia'''. These are the mammal species in [[Saint Lucia]], of which 0 are critically endangered, 0 are endangered, 2 are vulnerable, and 0 are near-threatened. 2 of the species listed for Saint Lucia is considered to be extinct.&lt;ref&gt;This list is derived from the [[IUCN Red List]] which lists species of mammals and includes those mammals that have recently been classified as extinct (since 1500 AD). The taxonomy and naming of the individual species is based on those used in existing Wikipedia articles as of 21 May 2007 and supplemented by the common names and taxonomy from the IUCN, Smithsonian Institution, or University of Michigan where no Wikipedia article was available.
&lt;/ref&gt;

The following tags are used to highlight each species' conservation status as assessed by the [[World Conservation Union|IUCN]]:
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:left"
|-
| EX ||'''Extinct'''|| No reasonable doubt that the last individual has died.
|-
| EW ||'''Extinct in the wild'''|| Known only to survive in captivity or as a naturalized populations well outside its previous range.
|-
| CR ||'''Critically Endangered'''|| The species is in imminent risk of extinction in the wild.
|-
| EN ||'''Endangered'''|| The species is facing an extremely high risk of extinction in the wild.
|-
| VU ||'''Vulnerable'''|| The species is facing a high risk of extinction in the wild.
|-
| NT ||'''Near Threatened'''|| The species does not meet any of the criteria that would categorise it as risking extinction but it is likely to do so in the future.
|-
| LC ||'''Least Concern'''|| There are no current identifiable risks to the species.
|-
| DD ||'''Data Deficient'''|| There is inadequate information to make an assessment of the risks to this species.
|}

Some species were assessed using an earlier set of criteria. Species assessed using this system have the following instead of Near Threatened and Least Concern categories:
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:left"
|-
| LR/cd || '''Lower Risk/conservation dependent''' || Species which were the focus of conservation programmes and may have moved into a higher risk category if that programme was discontinued.
|-
| LR/nt || '''Lower Risk/near threatened''' || Species which are close to being classified as Vulnerable but are not the subject of conservation programmes.
|-
| LR/lc || '''Lower Risk/least concern''' || Species for which there are no identifiable risks.
|}

'''Malwa''' is a [[historical region|historical]] [[list of regions in India|region]] of west-central [[India]] occupying a [[plateau]] of volcanic origin. Geologically, the '''Malwa Plateau''' generally refers to the [[volcanic plateau|volcanic upland]] north of the [[Vindhya Range]]. Politically and administratively, the historical Malwa region includes districts of central part of western [[Madhya Pradesh]] and parts of south-eastern [[Rajasthan]]. The definition of Malwa is sometimes extended to include the [[Nimar]] region south of the Vindhyas.

The Malwa region had been a separate political unit from the time of the ancient [[Malava Kingdom]]. It has been ruled by several kingdoms and dynasties, including the [[Avanti (India)|Avanti Kingdom]], the [[Maurya Empire|Mauryans]], the [[Malavas]], the [[Gupta Empire|Guptas]], the [[Paramara]]s, the [[Malwa Sultanate|Malwa sultans]], the [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]] and the [[Maratha Empire|Marathas]]. Malwa continued to be an administrative division until 1947, when the [[Malwa Agency]] of [[British India]] was merged into [[Madhya Bharat]] (also known as Malwa Union) state of independent India.

Although its political borders have fluctuated throughout history, the region has developed its own distinct culture, influenced by the Rajasthani, Marathi and Gujarati cultures. Several [[List of people from Malwa|prominent people]] in the history of India have hailed from Malwa, including the poet and dramatist [[Kalidasa]], the author [[Bhartrihari]], the mathematicians and astronomers [[Varahamihira]] and [[Brahmagupta]], and the polymath king [[Bhoja]]. [[Ujjain]] had been the political, economic, and cultural capital of the region in ancient times, and [[Indore]] is now the largest city and commercial centre.

Overall, [[agriculture]] is the main occupation of the people of Malwa. The region has been one of the important producers of [[opium]] in the world. Wheat and soybeans are other important cash crops, and textiles are a major industry.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name  ''Malwa'' is derived from the name of the ancient Indian tribe of ''[[Malava Kingdom|Malavas]]''. The name ''Malava'' is said to be derived from the Sanskrit term ''Malav'', which means “part of the abode of ''[[Lakshmi]]''”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9050395/Malwa-Plateau Malwa Plateau on Britannica]&lt;/ref&gt; The location of the Malwa or ''Moholo'', mentioned by the 7th-century Chinese traveller [[Xuanzang]], is plausibly identified with present-day Gujarat.&lt;ref name="encyclopbr"&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Malwa |volume=17 |page=518}}&lt;/ref&gt; The region is cited as ''Malibah'' in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] records, such as ''Kamilu-t Tawarikh'' by [[Ibn Asir]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.panhwar.com/Adobe/Article22.pdf Panhwar, M.H., ''Sindh: The Archaeological Museum of the world.'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Malwa culture|Malwa Culture]] was a [[Chalcolithic]] [[archaeological culture]] which existed in the Malwa region, as well as nearby parts of [[Maharashtra]] to the south, during the 2nd millennium BCE.&lt;ref&gt;P. K. Basant (2012), [https://books.google.com/books?id=KOJ8aT3xYPoC''The City and the Country in Early India: A Study of Malwa''], p.85&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Upinder Singh (2008), [https://books.google.com/books?id=H3lUIIYxWkEC ''A History of Ancient and Early Medieval India: From the Stone Age to the 12th Century''], p.227&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ujjain]], also known historically as ''Ujjaiyini'' and ''Avanti'', emerged as the first major centre in the Malwa region during India's second wave of [[urbanization|urbanisation]] in the 7th century BC (the first wave was the [[Indus Valley Civilization]]). Around 600 BC an earthen rampart was built around Ujjain, enclosing a city of considerable size. Ujjain was the capital city of the [[Avanti (India)|Avanti]] kingdom, one of the prominent [[mahajanapada]]s of ancient India. In the post-[[Mahabharata]] period—around 500 BC—Avanti was an important kingdom in western India; it was ruled by the [[Haihayas]], a people who were responsible for the destruction of Naga power in western India.&lt;ref name="ahmad"&gt;Ahmad, S. H., ''Anthropometric measurements and ethnic affinities of the Bhil and their allied groups of Malwa area.'', Anthropological Survey of India,1991, ''{{ISBN|81-85579-07-5}}''&lt;/ref&gt;

The region was conquered by the [[Nanda Empire]] in the mid-4th century BC, and subsequently became part of the [[Maurya Empire]]. [[Ashoka]], who was later a Mauryan emperor, was governor of Ujjain in his youth. After the death of Ashoka in 232 BC, the Maurya Empire began to collapse. Although evidence is sparse, Malwa was probably ruled by the [[Kushan]]as, the [[Indo-Scythians|Shakas]] and the [[Satavahana dynasty]] during the 1st and 2nd century CE. Ownership of the region was the subject of dispute between the [[Western Kshatrapas]] and the [[Satavahana]]s during the first three centuries AD. Ujjain emerged a major trading centre during the 1st century AD.

Malwa became part of the [[Gupta Empire]] during the reign of [[Chandragupta II]] (375–413), also known as ''Vikramaditya'', who conquered the region, driving out the [[Western Kshatrapa]]s. The Gupta period is widely regarded as a golden age in the history of Malwa, when Ujjain served as the empire's western capital. Kalidasa, [[Aryabhata]] and Varahamihira were all based in Ujjain, which emerged as a major centre of learning, especially in [[astronomy]] and [[mathematics]]. Around 500, Malwa re-emerged from the dissolving [[Gupta Empire]] as a separate kingdom; in 528, [[Yasodharman]] of Malwa defeated the [[Hunas]], who had invaded India from the north-west. During the seventh century, the region became part of [[Harsha]]'s empire, who disputed the region with the [[Chalukya]] king [[Pulakesin II]] of [[Badami]] in the [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]].

In 756 AD [[Gurjara-Pratiharas]] advanced into Malwa.&lt;ref&gt;Asiatic Society of Bombay, ''Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bombay'', The Society, 1951, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; In 786 the region was captured by the [[Rashtrakuta]] kings of the Deccan, and was disputed between the Rashtrakutas and the Gurjara Pratihara kings of [[Kannauj]] until the early part of the tenth century. The Emperors of the [[Rashtrakuta dynasty]] appointed the [[Paramara]] rulers as governors of Malwa.&lt;ref&gt;Ancient India  by Ramesh Chandra Majumdar p.294&lt;/ref&gt;  From the mid-tenth century, Malwa was ruled by the [[Paramara]]s, who established a capital at [[Dhar]]. King [[Bhoja|Bhoj]], who ruled from about 1010 to 1060, was known as the great [[polymath]] philosopher-king of medieval India; his extensive writings cover philosophy, poetry, medicine, veterinary science, phonetics, yoga, and archery. Under his rule Malwa became an intellectual centre of India. His successors ruled until about 1305, when Malwa was [[Alauddin Khalji's conquest of Malwa|conquered by the Delhi Sultanate]].

[[Dilawar Khan]], previously Malwa's governor under the rule of the Delhi sultanate, declared himself sultan of Malwa in 1401 after the [[Mughals|Mughal]] conqueror [[Timur]] attacked Delhi, causing the break-up of the sultanate into smaller states. Khan started the ''[[Malwa Sultanate]]'' and established a capital at Mandu, high in the [[Vindhya Range]] overlooking the [[Narmada River]] valley. His son and successor, [[Hoshang Shah]] (1405–35), developed Mandu as an important city. Hoshang Shah's son, Ghazni Khan, ruled for only a year and was succeeded by [[Mahmud Khalji]] (1436–69), the first of the [[Khalji dynasty|Khalji]] sultans of Malwa, who expanded the state to include parts of Gujarat, Rajasthan, and the [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]]. The Muslim sultans invited the Rajputs to settle in the country. In the early 16th century, the sultan sought the aid of the sultans of Gujarat to counter the growing power of the Rajputs, while the Rajputs sought the support of the [[Sesodia]] Rajput kings of [[Mewar]].

[[Gujarat]] stormed Mandu in 1518.  In 1531, [[Bahadur Shah of Gujarat]], captured Mandu, executed Mahmud II (1511–31), and shortly after that, the Malwa sultanate collapsed.&lt;ref name="sen2"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Sen |first=Sailendra |title=A Textbook of Medieval Indian History |publisher=Primus Books |year=2013 |isbn=978-9-38060-734-4 |pages=116}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] emperor [[Akbar]] captured Malwa in 1562 and made it a [[Subah (province)|subah]] (province) of his empire. The [[Malwa Subah]] existed from 1568 to 1743. Mandu was abandoned by the 17th century.

[[File:Holkar courtian coolspark.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Sculpture of a Holkar courtier from Fort Ahilya]]
As the Mughal state weakened after 1700, the [[Marathas]] held sway over Malwa under dispatchment of [[Baji Rao I]] under leadership of [[Chimnaji Appa]], [[Nemaji Shinde]] and [[Chimnaji Damodar]] were the first [[Maratha]] generals to cross the boundary of [[Maharashtra]] and to invade in Malwa in 1698. Subsequently, [[Malharrao Holkar]] (1694–1766) became leader of Maratha armies in Malwa in 1724, and in 1733 the Maratha [[Peshwa]] granted him control of most of the region, which was formally ceded by the Mughals in 1738. [[Ranoji Scindia]], noted Maratha commander, established his headquarters at Ujjain in 1721. This capital was later moved to [[Gwalior State]] by [[Daulatrao Scindia]]. Another Maratha general, Anand Rao [[Pawar]], established himself as the Raja of [[Dhar State|Dhar]] in 1742, and the two Pawar brothers became Rajas of [[Dewas State (Maratha Confederacy)|Dewas State]].

At the end of the 18th century, Malwa became the venue of fighting between the rival Maratha powers and the headquarters of the [[Pindari]]s, who were irregular plunderers. The Pindaris were rooted out in a campaign by the British general &lt;!--Check my insertion of 'general'; btw, Enc Brit. is not a high-status source ...--&gt;[[Lord Hastings]], and further order was established under [[Sir John Malcolm]].&lt;ref name="encyclopbr" /&gt; The [[Holkar]] dynasty ruled Malwa from [[Indore]] and [[Maheshwar]] on the [[Narmada river|Narmada]] until 1818, when the Marathas were defeated by the British in the [[Third Anglo-Maratha War]], and the Holkars of Indore became a [[princely state]] of the [[British Raj]].

After 1818 the British organised the numerous princely states of central India into the [[Central India Agency]]; the Malwa Agency was a division of Central India, with an area of {{convert|23,100|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} and a population of 1,054,753 in 1901. It comprised the states of [[Dewas State]] ([[Dewas Senior|senior]] and [[Dewas Junior|junior branch]]), [[Jaora]], [[Ratlam]], [[Sitamau]] and [[Sailana]], together with a large part of [[Gwalior]], parts of Indore and [[Tonk (princely state)|Tonk]], and about 35 small estates and holdings. Political power was exercised from Neemuch.&lt;ref name="encyclopbr" /&gt;

Upon [[Indian Independence Movement|Indian independence]] in 1947, the Holkars and other princely rulers acceded to India, and most of Malwa became part of the new state of [[Madhya Bharat]], which was merged into Madhya Pradesh in 1956.

== Geography ==
[[File:Hindostan 1814.jpg|thumb|right|Malwa (central India, in yellow), as depicted in the ''Ostell's New General Atlas'', 1814]]
The Malwa region occupies a plateau in western Madhya Pradesh and south-eastern [[Rajasthan]] (between {{Coord|21|10|N|73|45|E|}} and {{Coord|25|10|N|79|14|E|}}),&lt;ref name="ahmad" /&gt; with [[Gujarat]] in the west. The region includes the Madhya Pradesh districts of [[Agar malwa|Agar]], [[Dewas District|Dewas]], [[Dhar District|Dhar]], [[Indore District|Indore]], [[Jhabua District|Jhabua]], [[Mandsaur District|Mandsaur]], [[Neemuch District|Neemuch]], [[Rajgarh District|Rajgarh]], [[Ratlam District|Ratlam]], [[Shajapur District|Shajapur]], [[Ujjain District|Ujjain]], and parts of [[Guna District|Guna]] and [[Sehore District|Sehore]], and the Rajasthan districts of [[Jhalawar]] and parts of [[Kota, Rajasthan|Kota]],  [[Banswara]] and [[Pratapgarh district, Rajasthan|Pratapgarh]].

Malwa is bounded in the north-east by the [[Hadoti]] region, in the north-west by the [[Mewar]] region, in the west by the [[Vagad]] region and [[Gujarat]]. To the south and east is the Vindhya Range and to the north is the [[Bundelkhand]] upland.

The plateau is an extension of the [[Deccan Traps]], formed between 60 and 68 [[geologic timescale|million years ago]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ksgeo.kj.yamagata-u.ac.jp/~iwata/personal/Deccan-e.htm |title= Geochronological Study of the Deccan Volcanism by the 40Ar-39Ar Method |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060225205236/http://ksgeo.kj.yamagata-u.ac.jp/~iwata/personal/Deccan-e.htm |archivedate=2006-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mantleplumes.org/Deccan.html The Deccan beyond the plume hypothesis]&lt;/ref&gt; at the end of the [[Cretaceous]] [[Geologic period|period]]. In this region the main classes of soil are [[Vertisol|black]], brown and ''bhatori'' (stony) soil. The volcanic, clay-like soil of the region owes its black colour to the high [[iron]] content of the [[basalt]] from which it formed. The soil requires less irrigation because of its high capacity for moisture retention. The other two soil types are lighter and have a higher proportion of sand.

The average elevation of the plateau is 500&amp;nbsp;m. Some of the peaks over 800&amp;nbsp;m high are at Sigar (881&amp;nbsp;m), [[Janapav]] (854&amp;nbsp;m) and Ghajari (810&amp;nbsp;m). The plateau generally slopes towards the north. The western part of the region is drained by the [[Mahi River]], while the [[Chambal River]] drains the central part, and the [[Betwa River]] and the headwaters of the [[Dhasan River|Dhasan]] and [[Ken River|Ken]] rivers drain the east. The [[Shipra River]] is of historical importance because of the [[Ujjain Simhastha|Simhasth mela]], held every 12 years. Other notable rivers are [[Parbati River (Madhya Pradesh)|Parbati]], [[Gambhir river, Rajasthan|Gambhir]] and [[Choti Kali Sindh]].

Due to its altitude of about 550 to 600 meters above mean sea level, the region has comparatively cool evenings against the hot days during the summer season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Omkareshwar and Maheshwar: Travel Guide|date=2011|publisher=Goodearth Publications|isbn=9789380262246|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=_0RpUoGiou4C|language=en|page=79}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even if the day temperature reaches 42 to 43 degrees Celsius, the night temperatures are always in range of 20 to 22 degrees making the climate much cooler than the other areas of the region.  The cool morning wind, the ''karaman'', and an evening breeze, the ''{{vanchor|Shab-e-Malwa}}'', make the summers less harsh. The term ''Shab-e-Malwa'', meaning dusk in Malwa (from ''shab'', [[Urdu]] for night), was introduced by the [[Mughals]].

[[File:Mhow2 coolspark.jpg|left|250px|thumb| The Vindhya Range marks the southern boundary of the plateau, and is the source of many rivers of the region.]]
The year is popularly divided into three seasons: summer, the rains, and winter. Summer extends over the months of [[Chaitra]] to [[Jyestha]] (mid-March to mid-May). The average maximum temperature during the summer months is 37&amp;nbsp;°C, which typically rises to around 40&amp;nbsp;°C on a few days. The rainy season starts with the first showers of [[Aashaadha]] (mid-June) and extends to the middle of [[Ashvin]] (September). Most of the rain falls during the southwest [[monsoon]] spell, and ranges from about 80&amp;nbsp;cm in the west to about 10.5&amp;nbsp;cm in the east. Indore and the immediately surrounding areas receive an average of 90&amp;nbsp;cm of rainfall a year. The growing period lasts from 90 to 150 days, during which the average daily temperature is below 30&amp;nbsp;°C, but seldom falls below 20&amp;nbsp;°C. Winter is the longest of the three seasons, extending for about five months (mid-Ashvin to [[Phalgun]], i.e., October to mid-March). The average daily minimum temperature ranges from 6&amp;nbsp;°C to 9&amp;nbsp;°C, though on some nights it can fall as low as 3&amp;nbsp;°C. Some cultivators believe that an occasional winter shower during the months of [[Pausha]] and [[Maagha]]—known as Mawta—is helpful to the early summer wheat and germ crops.&lt;ref name="ahmad" /&gt;

[[File:Sambar chennai.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The Sambhar is one of the most common wild animals found in the region.]]
The region is part of the [[Kathiawar-Gir dry deciduous forests]] [[ecoregion]].

[[Vegetation]]: The natural vegetation is [[tropical dry forest]], with scattered [[teak]] ''(Tectona grandis)'' forests. The main trees are ''[[Butea]]'', ''[[Bombax]]'', ''[[Anogeissus]]'', ''[[Acacia]]'', ''[[Buchanania]]'' and ''[[Boswellia]]''. The shrubs or small trees include species of ''[[Grewia]], [[Ziziphus mauritiana]], [[Casearia]], [[Prosopis]], [[Capparis]], [[Woodfordia]], ''[[Phyllanthus]],'' and ''[[Carissa]]''.

[[Wildlife]]: [[Sambar Deer|Sambhar]] ''(Cervus unicolor)'', [[Blackbuck]] ''(Antilope cervicapra)'', and [[Chinkara]] ''(Gazella bennettii)'' are some common [[ungulate]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dewas.nic.in/index_01.htm Dewas district] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060109062050/http://www.dewas.nic.in/index_01.htm |date=9 January 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
During the last century, deforestation has happened at a fast rate, leading to environmental problems such as acute water scarcity and the danger that the region is being desertified.

== Demographics ==
[[File:gaduliya.jpg|right|250px|thumb| A girl from the [[Gadia Lohar]]s nomadic tribe of [[Marwar]], cooking on the outskirts of a village in Ratlam district]]
The population of the Malwa region was about 18.9 million in 2001, with a population density of a moderate 231/km². The annual birth rate in the region was 31.6 per 1000, and the death rate 10.3. The infant mortality rate was 93.8, slightly higher than the overall rate for the Madhya Pradesh state.

There are numerous tribes in the region, such as the [[Bhils]]—and their allied groups, the [[Meo]]s the [[Bhilala]]s, [[Barela]]s and [[Patelia]]s—and the [[Meenas]], who all differ to a remarkable degree from the regional population in their dialects and social life. They encompass a variety of languages and cultures. Some tribes of the region, notably the [[Kanjar]]s, were [[Denotified Tribes|notified]] in the 19th century for their criminal activities, but have since been denotified. A nomadic tribe from the [[Marwar]] region of Rajasthan, the [[Gadia Lohar]]s—who work as ''lohars'' (blacksmiths)—visit the region at the start of the agricultural season to repair and sell agricultural tools and implements, stopping temporarily on the outskirts of villages and towns and residing in their ornate metal carts. The [[Kalbelia]] is another nomadic tribe from Rajasthan that regularly visits the region.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nativeplanet.org/indigenous/cultures/india/kalbeliya/kalbeliya.shtml Kalbeliya nomads]&lt;/ref&gt;

Malwa has a significant number of [[Dawoodi Bohras]], a subsect of [[Shia]] Muslims from Gujarat, who are mostly businessmen by profession. Besides speaking the local languages, the Bohras have their own language, [[Lisan al-Dawat]]. The [[Patidar]]s, who probably originated from the [[Kurmi]]s of [[Punjab region|Punjab]], are mostly rural farmers who settled in Gujarat around 1400. Periods of [[Maratha Empire|Maratha rule]] led to the growth of sizeable Marathi communities. The region of [[Indore]], [[Dhar]], [[Dewas]] and [[Ujjain]] has a considerable [[Marathi language|Marathi]] speaking populace. A significant number of [[Marwari people|Marwari]]s, [[Jats]] and [[Rajput]]s also live in the region. The [[Sindhi people|Sindhis]], who settled in the region after the [[partition of India]], are an important part of the business community. Like southern Rajasthan&lt;!--'neighbouring' and 'southern' is awkward: can we have both as directions or both as neighbours? Re: "southern Rajasthan" and are the neighbours, the assertion being valid for the whole of Gujarat, but only southern parts of Rajasthan--&gt;, the region has a significant number of [[Jain]]s, who are mostly traders and business people. The region is home to smaller numbers of [[Goa]]n Catholics, [[Anglo-Indian]]s, [[Punjabi people|Punjabis]] and [[Zoroastrian|Parsis]] or Zoroastrians. The Parsis are closely connected to the growth and evolution of [[Mhow]], which has a Parsi fire temple and a [[Tower of Silence]].

== Economy ==
[[File:Children in opium field - Malwa.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Children in an [[opium]] field in Malwa]]
[[Indore]] is the commercial capital of Malwa region. Malwa is one of the world's major opium producers. This crop resulted in development of close connections between the economies of Malwa, the western Indian ports and [[China]], bringing international capital to the region in the 18th and 19th centuries. Malwa opium was a challenge to the [[monopoly]] of the [[British East India Company]], which was supplying [[Bengal]] opium to China. This led the British company to impose many restrictions on the production and trade of the drug; eventually, opium trading was pushed underground. When smuggling became rife, the [[British Empire|British]] eased the restrictions. Today, the region is one of the largest producers of legal opium in the world. There is a central, government-owned opium and alkaloid factory in the city of Neemuch. Nevertheless, there is a still a significant amount of illicit opium production, which is channelled into the black market. The headquarters of India's Central Bureau of Narcotics is in [[Gwalior]]. The [[Rajputana-Malwa Railway]] was opened in 1876.

The region is predominantly agricultural. The brown soil in parts of the region is particularly suitable for the cultivation of such ''unalu'' (early summer) crops as wheat, gram (''[[Cicer arietinum]]'') and til (''[[Sesamum indicum]]''). Relatively poor soil is used for the cultivation of such ''syalu'' (early winter) crops as millet (''[[sorghum|Andropogon sorghum]]''), maize (''[[Zea mays]]''), [[mung bean]] (''Vigna radiata''), [[urad (bean)|urad]] (''Vigna mungo''), batla (''[[Pisum sativum]]'') and peanuts (''[[peanut|Arachis hypogaea]]''). Overall, the main crops are jowar, rice, wheat, coarse millet, peanuts and pulses, soya bean, cotton, linseed, sesame and sugarcane. Sugar mills are located in numerous small towns.

The black, volcanic soil is ideal for the cultivation of cotton, and textile manufacture is an important industry. Large centres of textile production include Indore, Ujjain and Nagda. Maheshwar is known for its fine ''Maheshwari'' saris, and Mandsaur for its coarse woollen blankets. Handicrafts are an important source of income for the tribal population. Coloured lacquerware from Ratlam, rag dolls from Indore, and papier-mâché articles from Indore, Ujjain and several other centres are well known.

Mandsaur district is the sole producer in India of white- and red-coloured [[slate]], used in the district's 110 slate pencil factories&lt;!--check 'factories'--&gt;. There is a cement factory in &lt;!--name the town?--&gt;. Apart from this, the region lacks mineral resources. The region's industries mainly produce consumer goods—but there are now many centres of large- and medium-scale industries, including Indore, Nagda and Ujjain. Indore has a large-scale factory that produces diesel engines. [[Pithampur]], an industrial town 25&amp;nbsp;km from Indore, is known as the Detroit of India for its heavy concentration of automotive industry. Indore is recognised as the commercial capital of Madhya Pradesh, and is the main centre for trade in textiles and agro-based products. It has one of the six [[Indian Institute of Management Indore|Indian Institutes of Management]] and one of sixteen [[Indian Institute of Technology Indore|Indian Institute of Technology]].

== Culture ==
[[File:Figurine coolspark.jpg|thumb|200px|right|A Maratha-styled sculpture from Maheshwar]]
The culture of Malwa has been significantly influenced by Rajasthani culture, because of their geographic proximity. [[Marathi people|Marathi]] influence is also visible, because of recent rule by the [[Marathas]].

The main language of Malwa is [[Malvi language|Malvi]], although Hindi is widely spoken in the cities. This Indo-European language is subclassified as Indo-Aryan. The language is sometimes referred to as Malavi or Ujjaini. Malvi is part of the [[Rajasthani language|Rajasthani]] branch of languages; Nimadi is spoken in the [[Nimar]] region of Madhya Pradesh and in Rajasthan. The dialects of Malvi are, in alphabetical order, Bachadi, Bhoyari, Dholewari, Hoshangabadi, Jamral, Katiyai, Malvi Proper, Patvi, Rangari, Rangri and Sondwari. A survey in 2001 found only four dialects: Ujjaini (in the districts of Ujjain, Indore, Dewas and Sehore), Rajawari (Ratlam, Mandsaur and Neemuch), Umadwari (Rajgarh) and Sondhwari (Jhalawar, in Rajasthan). About 55% of the population of Malwa can converse in and about 40% of the population is literate in Hindi, the official language of the Madhya Pradesh state.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=mup Ethnologue]&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional Malwa food has elements of [[Rajasthani cuisine|Rajasthani]], [[Gujarati cuisine|Gujarati]] and [[Maharashtrian cuisine|Maharashtrian]] cuisine. Traditionally, [[jowar]] was the staple cereal, but after the [[Green Revolution in India]], wheat has replaced jowar as the most important food crop; many are [[vegetarian]]s. Since the climate is mostly dry throughout the year, most people rely on stored foods such as pulses, and green vegetables are rare. A typical snack of Malwa is the ''bhutta ri kees'' (made with grated corn roasted in [[ghee]] and later cooked in milk with spices). ''Chakki ri shaak'' is made of wheat dough, which is washed under running water, steamed and then used in a gravy of curd. The traditional bread of Malwa is called ''baati/bafla'', which is essentially a small, round ball of wheat flour, roasted over dung cakes, in the traditional way. ''[[Baati]]'' is typically eaten with dal (pulses), while ''baflas'' are dripping with ghee and soaked with dal. The ''amli ri kadhi'' is ''kadhi'' made with tamarind instead of yogurt. Sweet cakes, made of a variety of wheat called ''tapu'', are prepared during religious festivities. Sweet cereal called ''thulli'' is also typically eaten with milk or yoghurt. Traditional desserts include ''mawa-bati'' (milk-based sweet similar to [[Gulab jamun]]), ''khoprapak'' (coconut-based sweet), ''[[shreekhand]]'' (yogurt based) and ''malpua''.

''[[Lavani]]'' is a widely practised form of folk music in southern Malwa, which was brought to the region by the [[Marathas]]. The ''Nirguni Lavani'' (philosophical) and the ''Shringari Lavani'' (erotic) are two of the main genres. The Bhils have their own folk songs, which are always accompanied by dance. The folk musical modes of Malwa are of four or five notes, and in rare cases six. The devotional music of the ''Nirguni'' cult is popular throughout Malwa. Legends of ''Raja'' Bhoj and ''Bijori'', the ''Kanjar'' girl, and the tale of ''Balabau'' are popular themes for folk songs. Insertions known as ''stobha'' are commonly used in Malwa music; this can occur in four ways: the ''matra stobha'' (syllable insertion), ''varna stobha'' (letter insertion), ''shabda stobha'' (word insertion) and ''vakya stobha'' (sentence insertion).

[[File:Mhow coolspark.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Typical countryside near Mhow during the [[monsoon]] season]]

Malwa was the centre of [[Sanskrit literature]] during and after the Gupta period. The region's most famous playwright, [[Kalidasa]], is considered to be the greatest Indian writer ever. His first surviving play is ''Malavikagnimitra'' (Malavika and Agnimitra). Kalidasa's second play, his masterpiece, is the [[Abhijñānaśākuntalam]], which tells the story of king Dushyanta, who falls in love with a girl of lowly birth, the lovely Shakuntala. The last of Kalidasa's surviving plays is ''[[Vikramuurvashiiya]]'' ("Urvashi conquered by valour"). Kalidasa also wrote the epic poems ''[[Raghuvamsha]]'' ("Dynasty of Raghu"), ''[[Ritusamhaara|Ritusamhāra]]'' and ''Kumarasambhava'' ("Birth of the war god"), as well as the lyric ''[[Meghaduuta]]'' ("The cloud messenger").

''[[Swang (dance drama)|Swang]]'' is a popular dance form in Malwa; its roots go back to the origins of the Indian theatre tradition in the first millennium BC. Since women did not participate in the dance-drama form, men enacted their roles. ''Swang'' incorporates suitable theatrics and mimicry, accompanied alternately by song and dialogue. The genre is dialogue-oriented rather than movement-oriented.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boloji.com/dances/00123.htm 'Swang'&amp;nbsp;– The Folk Dance of Malwa]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Mandana'' (literally painting) wall and floor paintings are the best-known painting traditions of Malwa. White drawings stand out in contrast to the base material consisting of a mixture of red clay and cow dung. Peacocks, cats, lions, goojari, bawari, the [[swastika]] and chowk are some motifs of this style&lt;!--Consider omitting 'swastika' unless it's really important—many readers will take it the wrong way Re: swastika is an important motif throughout India, absolutely essential in many places. --&gt;. ''Sanjhya'' is a ritual wall painting done by young girls during the annual period when Hindus remember and offer ritual oblation to their ancestors. Malwa miniature paintings are well known for their intricate brushwork.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://ignca.nic.in/nl002903.htm |title=Paintings of Mewar and Malwa |access-date=15 November 2005 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050830194450/http://ignca.nic.in/nl002903.htm |archive-date=30 August 2005 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 17th century, an offshoot of the Rajasthani school of miniature painting, known as ''Malwa painting'', was centred largely in Malwa and Bundelkhand. The school preserved the style of the earliest examples, such as the ''Rasikapriya'' series dated 1636 (after a poem analysing the love sentiment) and the ''Amaru Sataka'' (a 17th-century Sanskrit poem). The paintings from this school are flat compositions on black and chocolate-brown backgrounds, with figures shown against a solid colour patch, and architecture painted in vibrant colours.&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.uor.edu:80/validate/http://0-www.search.eb.com.library.uor.edu:80/eb/article-9050393 Malwa painting on Encyclopædia Britannica]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The biggest festival of Malwa is the ''Simhastha mela'', held every 12 years, in which more than 40 million pilgrims take a holy dip in river [[Shipra]]. The festival of ''Gana-gour'' is celebrated in honour of [[Shiva]] and [[Parvati]]. The history of the festival goes back to ''Rano Bai'', whose parental home was in Malwa, but who was married in Rajasthan. Rano Bai was strongly attached to Malwa, and did not want to stay in Rajasthan. After marriage, she was allowed to visit Malwa only once a year; ''Gana-gour'' symbolises these annual return visits. The festival is observed by women in the region once in the month of ''Chaitra'' (mid-March) and ''Bhadra'' (mid-August). The ''Ghadlya'' (earthen pot) festival is celebrated by the girls of the region, who gather to visit every house in their village in the evenings, carrying earthen pots with holes for the light from oil lamps inside to escape. In front of every house, the girls recite songs connected with the Ghadlya and receive food or money in return. The ''Gordhan'' festival is celebrated on the 16th day in the month of Kartika. The [[Bhil]]s of the region sing ''Heeda'', anecdotal songs to the cattle, while the women sing the ''Chandrawali'' song, associated with [[Krishna]]'s romance.

The most popular fairs are held in the months of ''[[Phalguna]]'', ''[[Chaitra]]'', ''[[Bhadra (Hindu calendar)|Bhadra]]'', ''Ashvin'' and ''[[Kartika (month)|Kartik]]''. The ''Chaitra'' fair, held at Biaora, and the ''Gal yatras'', held at more than two dozen villages in Malwa are remarkable. Many fairs are held in the tenth day of the month of ''Bhadra'' to mark the birth of [[Tejaji]]. The ''Triveni mela'' is held at Ratlam, and other fairs take place in ''Kartika'' at Ujjain, Mandhata (Nimad), among others.

== Tourism ==

The main tourist destinations in Malwa are places of historical or religious significance. The river Shipra and the city of Ujjain have been regarded as sacred for thousands of years. The [[Mahakaleshwar Jyotirlinga|Mahakal Temple]] of Ujjain is one of the 12 ''[[jyotirling]]as''. Ujjain has over 100 other ancient temples, including ''[[Harsidhhi]]'', ''Chintaman Ganesh'', ''Gadh [[Kali]]ka'', ''Kaal [[Bhairava]]'' and ''Mangalnath''. The Kalideh Palace, on the outskirts of the city, is a fine example of ancient Indian architecture. The [[Bhartrihari]] caves are associated with interesting legends. Since the fourth century BC, Ujjain has enjoyed the reputation of being India's [[Greenwich]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ujjain.nic.in/mpdistrictsroot.htm Ujjain district official portal] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051217214342/http://www.ujjain.nic.in/mpdistrictsroot.htm |date=17 December 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
as the [[Prime Meridian]] of the Hindu geographers. The observatory built by [[Jai Singh II]] is one of the four such observatories in India and features ancient astronomical devices. The ''Simhastha mela'', celebrated every 12 years, starts on the full moon day in Chaitra (April) and continues into Vaishakha (May) until the next full moon day.

Mandu was originally the fort capital of the Parmar rulers. Towards the end of the 13th century, it came under the sway of the Sultans of Malwa, the first of whom named it Shadiabad (city of joy). It remained as the capital, and in it the sultans built exquisite palaces like the Jahaz Mahal and Hindola Mahal, ornamental canals, baths and pavilions. The massive Jami Masjid and Hoshang Shah's tomb provided inspiration to the designers of the [[Taj Mahal]] centuries later. [[Baz Bahadur]] built a huge palace in Mandu in the 16th century. Other notable historical monuments are ''Rewa Kund'', [[Rupmati]]'s Pavilion, Nilkanth Mahal, Hathi Mahal, Darya Khan's Tomb, Dai ka Mahal, Malik Mughit is Mosque and Jali Mahal.

Close to Mandu is Maheshwar, a town on the northern bank of [[Narmada River]] that served as the capital of the [[Indore]] state under [[Rajmata Ahilya Devi Holkar]]. The Maratha ''rajwada'' (fort) is the main attraction. A life-size statue of Rani Ahilya sits on a throne within the fort complex. Dhar was the capital of Malwa before Mandu became the capital in 1405. There, the fort is in ruins but offers a panoramic view. The Bhojashala Mosque (built in 1400) is still used as a place of worship on Fridays. The abandoned [[Lat Masjid]] (1405) and the tomb of Kamal Maula (early 15th century), a Muslim saint, are other places of interest.

Modern [[Indore]] was planned and built by Rajmata Ahilya Devi Holkar. The grand Lal Baag Palace is one of its grandest monuments. The ''Bada Ganpati'' temple houses what is possibly the largest Ganesh idol in the world, measuring 7.6&amp;nbsp;m from crown to foot. The ''[[Kanch Mandir]]'' is a Jain temple entirely inlaid with glass. The Town Hall was made in 1904 in indo-gothic style; originally named [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|King Edward]] Hall, it was renamed [[Mahatma Gandhi]] Hall in 1948. The ''chhatris'' are the tombs or cenotaphs erected in memory of dead Holkar rulers and their family members.

The shrine of [[Hussain Tekri]], built by the [[Nawab of Jaora]], [[Mohammad Iftikhar Ali Khan Bahadur]], in the 19th century, is on the outskirts of Jaora in the Ratlam district. Mohammad Iftikhar Ali Khan Bahadur was buried in the same graveyard where Hussain Tekri was buried. During the month of [[Moharram]], thousands of people from all over the world visit the shrine of [[Husayn ibn Ali|Hazrat Imam Hussain]] there, which is a replica of the Iraqi original. The place is famous for the rituals called ''Hajri'' to cure mental illness.

== Sports ==

[[Cricket]] is one of the most popular sports in the region. [[Indore]] is also home to the [[Madhya Pradesh Cricket Association]]. The city has two international cricket ground,  the [[Holkar Cricket Stadium]]. The first cricket ODI match in state was played in Indore at [[Nehru Stadium, Indore|Indore]].

'''Mount Everest''', known in [[Nepali language|Nepali]] as '''Sagarmatha''' ({{lang|ne|सगरमाथा}})  and in [[Tibetic languages|Tibetan]] as '''Chomolungma''' ({{lang|bo-Tibt|ཇོ་མོ་གླང་མ}}), is [[Earth]]'s [[List of highest mountains on Earth|highest mountain]] above [[sea level]], located in the [[Mahalangur Himal]] sub-range of the [[Himalayas]]. The international border between [[Nepal]] ([[Province No. 1]]) and [[China]] ([[Tibet Autonomous Region]]) runs across its [[Summit|summit point]].

The current official elevation of {{convert|8848|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, recognized by China and Nepal, was established by a 1955 Indian survey and subsequently confirmed by a Chinese survey in 1975.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; In 2005, China remeasured the rock height of the mountain, with a result of 8844.43 m. There followed an argument between China and Nepal as to whether the official height should be the rock height (8,844 m., China) or the snow height (8,848 m., Nepal). In 2010, an agreement was reached by both sides that the height of Everest is 8,848 m, and Nepal recognizes China's claim that the rock height of Everest is 8,844 m.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/8608913.stm|title=Official height for Everest set|date=8 April 2010|work=BBC|access-date=16 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1865, Everest was given its official English name by the [[Royal Geographical Society]], upon a recommendation by [[Andrew Scott Waugh|Andrew Waugh]], the British [[:Category: Surveyors General of India|Surveyor General of India]]. As there appeared to be several different local names, Waugh chose to name the mountain after his predecessor in the post, [[Sir George Everest]], despite George Everest's objections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Papers relating to the Himalaya and Mount Everest|journal=Proceedings of the London Royal Geographical Society of London|date=April–May 1857|volume=IX|pages=345–351}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mount Everest attracts many climbers, some of them highly experienced mountaineers. There are two main climbing routes, one approaching the summit from the southeast in Nepal (known as the "standard route") and the other from the north in Tibet. While not posing substantial technical climbing challenges on the standard route, Everest presents dangers such as [[altitude sickness]], weather, and wind, as well as significant hazards from avalanches and the [[Khumbu Icefall]]. {{Asof|2017}}, nearly 300 people have [[List of people who died climbing Mount Everest|died on Everest]], many of whose bodies remain on the mountain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20151008-the-graveyard-in-the-clouds-everests-200-dead-bodies|work=BBC Future|title=Death in the clouds: The problem with Everest's 200+ bodies|author= Nuwer, Rachel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first recorded efforts to reach Everest's summit were made by British [[mountaineering|mountaineers]]. As Nepal did not allow foreigners into the country at the time, the British made several attempts on the north ridge route from the Tibetan side. After the first [[1921 British Mount Everest reconnaissance expedition|reconnaissance expedition by the British in 1921]] reached {{convert|7000|m|ft|-1|abbr=on}} on the North Col, the [[1922 British Mount Everest Expedition|1922 expedition]] pushed the north ridge route up to {{convert|8320|m|ft|-1|abbr=on}}, marking the first time a human had climbed above {{convert|8000|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}. Seven porters were killed in an avalanche on the descent from the North Col. The [[1924 British Mount Everest Expedition|1924 expedition]] resulted in one of the greatest mysteries on Everest to this day: [[George Mallory]] and [[Andrew Irvine (mountaineer)|Andrew Irvine]] made a final summit attempt on 8 June but never returned, sparking debate as to whether or not they were the first to reach the top. They had been spotted high on the mountain that day but disappeared in the clouds, never to be seen again, until Mallory's body was found in 1999 at {{convert|8155|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} on the north face. [[Tenzing Norgay]] and [[Edmund Hillary]] made the [[1953 British Mount Everest expedition|first official ascent of Everest in 1953]], using the southeast ridge route. Norgay had reached {{convert|8595|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} the previous year as a member of the [[1952 Swiss Mount Everest expedition|1952 Swiss expedition]]. The Chinese mountaineering team of [[Wang Fuzhou]], [[Gongbu (mountaineer)|Gonpo]], and Qu Yinhua made the first reported [[1960 Chinese Mount Everest expedition|ascent of the peak from the north ridge]] on 25 May 1960.&lt;ref name=NorthRidge&gt;{{cite book|last=Lewis|first=Jon E.|title=The Mammoth Book of How it Happened – Everest|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vWqeBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT212|date=1 March 2012|publisher=Little, Brown Book Group|isbn=978-1-78033-727-2|page=212|chapter=Appendix 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=1stNorthSlopeClimb&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cctv.com/english/special/tibet/20091014/103993.shtml|title=Gonpo: first Chinese atop Mount Qomolangma|date=14 October 2009|work=CCTV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1715, the [[Qing Empire]] of China surveyed the mountain while mapping its territory and depicted it as Mount Qomolangma no later than 1719.&lt;ref name="PeoplesDaily2002"/&gt;
[[File:MountEverestRelief.png|thumb|300px|Mount Everest [[Cartographic relief depiction|relief map]]]]
&lt;!-- [[File:Sunny Everest.JPG|thumb|300px|Morning view, Mount Everest from its southern side]]--&gt;

In 1802, the British began the [[Great Trigonometric Survey]] of India to fix the locations, heights, and names of the world's highest mountains. Starting in southern India, the survey teams moved northward using giant [[theodolite]]s, each weighing {{convert|500|kg|lb|abbr=on}} and requiring 12 men to carry, to measure heights as accurately as possible. They reached the Himalayan foothills by the 1830s, but Nepal was unwilling to allow the British to enter the country due to suspicions of political aggression and possible annexation. Several requests by the surveyors to enter Nepal were turned down.&lt;ref name=everest_bwp70&gt;{{cite book |title= Everest – The Best Writing and Pictures from Seventy Years of Human Endeavour |editor=Peter Gillman| year=1993 |publisher=Little, Brown and Company|isbn=978-0-316-90489-6 |pages=10–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The British were forced to continue their observations from [[Terai]], a region south of Nepal which is parallel to the Himalayas. Conditions in Terai were difficult because of torrential rains and [[malaria]]. Three survey officers died from malaria while two others had to retire because of failing health.&lt;ref name=everest_bwp70/&gt;

Nonetheless, in 1847, the British continued the survey and began detailed observations of the Himalayan peaks from observation stations up to {{convert|240|km|mi|abbr=on}} distant. Weather restricted work to the last three months of the year. In November 1847, [[Andrew Scott Waugh|Andrew Waugh]], the British [[Surveyor General of India]] made several observations from the [[Sawajpore]] station at the east end of the Himalayas. [[Kangchenjunga]] was then [[List of past presumed highest mountains|considered the highest peak in the world]], and with interest, he noted a peak beyond it, about {{convert|230|km|mi|abbr=on}} away. John Armstrong, one of Waugh's subordinates, also saw the peak from a site farther west and called it peak "b". Waugh would later write that the observations indicated that peak "b" was higher than Kangchenjunga, but given the great distance of the observations, closer observations were required for verification. The following year, Waugh sent a survey official back to Terai to make closer observations of peak "b", but clouds thwarted his attempts.&lt;ref name=everest_bwp70/&gt;

In 1849, Waugh dispatched James Nicolson to the area, who made two observations from [[Jirol]], {{convert|190|km|mi|abbr=on}} away. Nicolson then took the largest [[theodolite]] and headed east, obtaining over 30 observations from five different locations, with the closest being {{convert|174|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the peak.&lt;ref name=everest_bwp70/&gt;

Nicolson retreated to [[Patna]] on the [[Ganges]] to perform the necessary calculations based on his observations. His raw data gave an average height of {{convert|9200|m|ft|abbr=on}} for peak "b", but this did not consider [[light refraction]], which distorts heights. However, the number clearly indicated that peak "b" was higher than Kangchenjunga. Nicolson contracted malaria and was forced to return home without finishing his calculations. Michael Hennessy, one of Waugh's assistants, had begun designating peaks based on [[Roman numerals]], with Kangchenjunga named Peak&amp;nbsp; IX. Peak "b" now became known as Peak&amp;nbsp;XV.&lt;ref name=everest_bwp70/&gt;

In 1852, stationed at the survey headquarters in [[Dehradun]], [[Radhanath Sikdar]], an Indian mathematician and surveyor from [[Bengal]], was the first to identify Everest as the world's highest peak, using [[trigonometry|trigonometric]] calculations based on Nicolson's measurements.&lt;ref name=BBC_mwde&gt;{{cite news|title=The man who "discovered" Everest|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/3193576.stm|work=BBC News|date=20 October 2003|accessdate=11 April 2008|first=Soutik|last=Biswas}}&lt;/ref&gt; An official announcement that Peak&amp;nbsp;XV was the highest was delayed for several years as the calculations were repeatedly verified. Waugh began work on Nicolson's data in 1854, and along with his staff spent almost two years working on the numbers, having to deal with the problems of light refraction, barometric pressure, and temperature over the vast distances of the observations. Finally, in March 1856 he announced his findings in a letter to his deputy in [[Kolkata|Calcutta]]. Kangchenjunga was declared to be {{convert|28156|ft|m|abbr=on|order=flip}}, while Peak&amp;nbsp;XV was given the height of {{convert|29002|ft|m|abbr=on|order=flip}}. Waugh concluded that Peak&amp;nbsp;XV was "most probably the highest in the world".&lt;ref name=everest_bwp70/&gt; Peak&amp;nbsp;XV (measured in feet) was calculated to be exactly {{convert|29000|ft|m|abbr=on|sigfig=5|}} high, but was publicly declared to be {{convert|29002|ft|m|abbr=on|sigfig=5|}} in order to avoid the impression that an exact height of {{convert|29000|ft|m|sigfig=5|}} was nothing more than a rounded estimate.&lt;ref name=tas1982&gt;{{cite journal|title=Letters to the Editor|journal=The American Statistician|volume=36|number=1|date=February 1982|pages=64–67|jstor=2684102|doi=10.1080/00031305.1982.10482782|last1=Stegman|first1=Charles E|last2=Bellhouse|first2=David|last3=Ehrenberg|first3=A.

{{anchor|Etymology}}

==Name==
[[File:"Papers relating to the Himalaya and Mount Everest" in Proceedings of the Royal Geographical Society of London, Vol. I (1857), p. 346.jpg|thumb|The name "Mount Everest" was first proposed in this 1856 speech, later published in 1857, in which the mountain was first confirmed as the world's highest]]
While the survey wanted to preserve local names if possible (e.g., [[Kangchenjunga]] and [[Dhaulagiri]]), Waugh argued that he could not find any commonly used local name. Waugh's search for a local name was hampered by Nepal and Tibet's exclusion of foreigners. Many local names existed, including "Deodungha" ("Holy Mountain") in [[Darjeeling]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.harappa.com/engr/darjeeling.html#everest |title=Mt. Everest 1857 |publisher=harappa.com |accessdate=23 January 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071226022726/http://www.harappa.com/engr/darjeeling.html |archivedate=26 December 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Tibetan "Chomolungma", which appeared on a 1733 map published in Paris by the French geographer [[Jean Baptiste Bourguignon d'Anville|D'Anville]]. In the late 19th century, many European [[cartography|cartographers]] incorrectly believed that a native name for the mountain was [[Gaurishankar]], a mountain between [[Kathmandu]] and Everest.&lt;ref name="Waddell"&gt;{{cite journal|first=LA|last=Waddell|title=The Environs and Native Names of Mount Everest|journal=The Geographical Journal|volume=12|number=6|date=December 1898|pages=564–569|jstor=1774275|doi=10.2307/1774275}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Waugh argued that because there were many local names, it would be difficult to favour one name over all others, so he decided that Peak XV should be named after Welsh surveyor [[George Everest|Sir George Everest]], his predecessor as Surveyor General of India.&lt;ref name=everest_bwp70/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{Cite news|work= The Times |title=India and China|date=4 October 1856|page=8|issue=22490}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rgs1857"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Papers relating to the Himalaya and Mount Everest | journal=Proceedings of the Royal Geographical Society of London | date=April–May 1857 | volume=IX | pages=345–351}}&lt;/ref&gt; Everest himself opposed the name suggested by Waugh and told the [[Royal Geographical Society]] in 1857 that "Everest" could not be written in [[Hindi]] nor pronounced by "the native of India".

The [[Classical Tibetan|Tibetan]] name for Mount Everest is {{lang|bo|ཇོ་མོ་གླང་མ}} ({{IPA-all|t͡ɕʰòmòlɑ́ŋmɑ̀}},{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} &lt;small&gt;lit.&lt;/small&gt;&amp;nbsp;"Holy Mother"), whose official [[Tibetan pinyin]] form is ''Qomolangma''.

In 1856, Andrew Waugh announced Everest (then known as Peak XV) as {{convert|29002|ft|m|abbr=on|order=flip}} high, after several years of calculations based on observations made by the [[Great Trigonometric Survey]].

The elevation of {{convert|8848|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} was first determined by an Indian survey in 1955, made closer to the mountain, also using [[theodolite]]s.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} It was subsequently reaffirmed by a 1975 Chinese measurement of {{convert|8848.13|m|ft|2|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=ABC_au/&gt; In both cases the snow cap, not the rock head, was measured. In May 1999 an American Everest Expedition, directed by [[Bradford Washburn]], anchored a [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] unit into the highest bedrock. A rock head elevation of {{convert|8850|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, and a snow/ice elevation {{convert|1|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} higher, were obtained via this device.&lt;ref name="alpres"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alpineresearch.ch/alpine/en/presse1.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070103165811/http://www.alpineresearch.ch/alpine/en/presse1.html|archivedate=3 January 2007|title=Elevation of Mount Everest newly defined|publisher=Swiss Foundation for Alpine Research|date=12 November 1999|accessdate=1 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although it has not been officially recognised by Nepal,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nepalgov.gov.np/countryprofile.php|title=Country Profile|publisher=Government of Nepal|year=2001|accessdate=1 April 2007|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070314011131/http://www.nepalgov.gov.np/countryprofile.php |archivedate = 14 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; this figure is widely quoted. [[Geoid]] uncertainty casts doubt upon the accuracy claimed by both the 1999 and 2005 surveys.

A detailed [[photogrammetry|photogrammetric]] map (at a scale of 1:50,000) of the [[Khumbu]] region, including the south side of Mount Everest, was made by Erwin Schneider as part of the 1955 International Himalayan Expedition, which also attempted [[Lhotse]]. An even more detailed [[topography|topographic]] map of the Everest area was made in the late-1980s under the direction of Bradford Washburn, using extensive [[aerial photography]].&lt;ref name="washburn_map"/&gt;

On 9 October 2005, after several months of measurement and calculation, the [[Chinese Academy of Sciences]] and State Bureau of Surveying and Mapping officially announced the height of Everest as {{convert|8844.43|m|ft|2|abbr=on}} with accuracy of ±{{convert|0.21|m|in|1|abbr=on}}. They claimed it was the most accurate and precise measurement to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2005-10/09/content_3597013.htm| title=China says Mount Qomolangma stands at 8844.43|agency=Xinhua News Agency|website=Xinhua online|date=9 October 2005|accessdate=17 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This height is based on the highest point of rock and not the snow and ice covering it. The Chinese team also measured a snow-ice depth of {{convert|3.5|m|ft|0|abbr=on}},&lt;ref name=ABC_au&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/science/news/enviro/EnviroRepublish_1478658.htm |title=Everest not as tall as thought|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|website=News in Science|date=5 October 2005 |accessdate=1 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is in agreement with a net elevation of {{convert|8848|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}. The snow and ice thickness varies over time, making a definitive height of the snow cap impossible to determine.

It is thought that the [[plate tectonics]] of the area are adding to the height and moving the summit northeastwards. Two accounts suggest the rates of change are {{convert|4|mm|in|abbr=on}} per year (upwards) and {{convert|3|to|6|mm|in|2|abbr=on}} per year (northeastwards),&lt;ref name="alpres"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalgeographic.com/features/99/everest/roof_content.html|title=Roof of the World|publisher=[[National Geographic Society]]|year=1999|accessdate=1 April 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070712170109/http://www.nationalgeographic.com/features/99/everest/roof_content.html|archivedate=12 July 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; but another account mentions more lateral movement ({{convert|27|mm|in|abbr=on|disp=or}}),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mos.org/Everest/exhibit/platetectonics.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061108172757/http://www.mos.org/Everest/exhibit/platetectonics.htm|archivedate=8 November 2006|title=Everest: Plate Tectonics|publisher=Museum of Science|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; and even shrinkage has been suggested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/4204539.stm|title=China fears Everest is shrinking|work=BBC News|date=25 January 2005|accessdate=1 April 2007|first=Louisa|last=Lim}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comparisons===
The summit of Everest is the point at which earth's surface reaches the greatest distance above sea level. Several other mountains are sometimes claimed to be the "tallest mountains on earth". [[Mauna Kea]] in Hawaii is tallest when measured from its base;&lt;ref name="base"&gt;The "base" of a mountain is a problematic notion in general with no universally accepted definition. However, for a peak rising out of relatively flat terrain, such as Mauna Kea or Denali, an "approximate" height above "base" can be calculated. Everest is more complicated since it only rises above relatively flat terrain on its north (Tibetan Plateau) side. Hence the concept of "base" has even less meaning for Everest than for Mauna Kea or Denali, and the range of numbers for "height above base" is wider. In general, comparisons based on "height above base" are somewhat suspect.&lt;/ref&gt; it rises over {{convert|10200|m|ft|1|abbr=on}} when measured from its base on the mid-ocean floor, but only attains {{convert|4205|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} above sea level.

By the same measure of base to summit, [[Denali]], in [[Alaska]], also known as Mount McKinley, is taller than Everest as well.&lt;ref name="base"/&gt; Despite its height above sea level of only {{convert|6190|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, Denali sits atop a sloping plain with elevations from {{convert|300|to|900|m|ft|abbr=on}}, yielding a height above base in the range of {{convert|5300|to|5900|m|ft|abbr=on}}; a commonly quoted figure is {{convert|5600|m|ft|-2|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/denali/expedition/mission.html|title=Surviving Denali, The Mission|publisher=Public Broadcasting Corporation|website=NOVA|year=2000|accessdate=7 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.upi.com/blog/2013/09/12/Mount-McKinley-83-feet-shorter-than-thought-new-data-show/4061379016741/|title=Mount McKinley 83 feet shorter than thought, new data show|agency=United Press International}}&lt;/ref&gt; By comparison, reasonable base elevations for Everest range from {{convert|4200|m|ft|-2|abbr=on}} on the south side to {{convert|5200|m|ft|-2|abbr=on}} on the [[Tibetan Plateau]], yielding a height above base in the range of {{convert|3650|to|4650|m|ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="washburn_map"&gt;''Mount Everest'' (1:50,000 scale map), prepared under the direction of [[Bradford Washburn]] for the Boston Museum of Science, the Swiss Foundation for Alpine Research, and the [[National Geographic Society]], 1991, {{ISBN|3-85515-105-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The summit of [[Chimborazo (volcano)|Chimborazo]] in Ecuador is {{convert|2168|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} farther from earth's centre ({{convert|6384.4|km|mi|1|abbr=on}}) than that of Everest ({{convert|6382.3|km|mi|1|abbr=on}}), because the earth bulges at the equator.&lt;ref name="Robert Krulwich"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=9428163|title=The 'Highest' Spot on Earth?|date=7 April 2007|work=NPR|author=Robert Krulwich}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is despite Chimborazo having a peak {{convert|6268|m|ft|1|abbr=on}} above sea level versus Mount Everest's {{convert|8848|m|ft|1|abbr=on}}.

==Geology==
[[File:EverestfromKalarPatarcrop.JPG|thumb|500px|Mount Everest with snow melted, showing upper geologic layers in bands.]]
Geologists have subdivided the rocks comprising Mount Everest into three units called [[Geologic formation|formations]].&lt;ref name="Scientiav5"&gt;Yin, C.-H., and S.-T.  Kuo. 1978. "Stratigraphy of the Mount Jolmo Langma and its north slope." Scientia Sinica. v. 5, pp. 630–644&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IslandArcv14"&gt;Sakai, H., M. Sawada, Y. Takigami, Y. Orihashi, T. Danhara, H. Iwano, Y. Kuwahara, Q. Dong, H. Cai, and J. Li. 2005. "Geology of the summit limestone of Mount Qomolangma (Everest) and cooling history of the Yellow Band under the Qomolangma detachment." [[Island Arc (journal)|Island Arc]]. v. 14 no. 4 pp. 297–310.&lt;/ref&gt; Each formation is separated from the other by low-angle [[Fault (geology)|faults]], called [[Detachment fault|detachments]], along which they have been thrust southward over each other. From the summit of Mount Everest to its base these rock units are the Qomolangma Formation, the [[North Col]] Formation, and the [[Rongbuk Glacier|Rongbuk Formation]].

The Qomolangma Formation, also known as the Jolmo Lungama Formation,&lt;ref name=Everest1953Geo/&gt; runs from the summit to the top of the Yellow Band, about {{convert|8,600|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level. It consists of greyish to dark grey or white, parallel laminated and bedded, [[Ordovician]] [[limestone]] interlayered with subordinate beds of recrystallised [[dolomite]] with [[argillaceous minerals|argillaceous]] [[Sediment|laminae]] and [[siltstone]]. Gansser first reported finding microscopic fragments of [[crinoid]]s in this limestone.&lt;ref&gt;Gansser, A. 1964. ''Geology of the Himalayas'', John Wiley Interscience, London, 1964 289 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rosenberg |first=Matt |url=http://geology.about.com/library/bl/peaks/bleverest.htm |title=A site which uses this dramatic fact first used in illustration of "deep time" in John McPhee's book '&amp;#39;'Basin and Range'&amp;#39;' |publisher=Geology.about.com |date= |accessdate=17 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later [[petrograph]]ic analysis of samples of the limestone from near the summit revealed them to be composed of carbonate pellets and finely fragmented remains of [[trilobite]]s, crinoids, and [[ostracods]]. Other samples were so badly sheared and recrystallized that their original constituents could not be determined. A thick, white-weathering [[thrombolite]] bed that is {{convert|60|m|ft|abbr=on}} thick comprises the foot of the "[[Three Steps|Third Step]]", and base of the summit pyramid of Everest. This bed, which crops out starting about {{convert|70|m|ft|abbr=on}} below the summit of Mount Everest, consists of sediments trapped, bound, and cemented by the biofilms of micro-organisms, especially [[cyanobacteria]], in shallow marine waters. The Qomolangma Formation is broken up by several high-angle faults that terminate at the low angle [[normal fault]], the Qomolangma Detachment. This detachment separates it from the underlying Yellow Band. The lower five metres of the Qomolangma Formation overlying this detachment are very highly deformed.&lt;ref name="Scientiav5"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IslandArcv14"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MyrowOthers2009"&gt;Myrow, P. M., N. C. Hughes, M. P. Searle, C. M. Fanning, S.-C. Peng, and S. K. Parcha, 2009, "Stratigraphic correlation of Cambrian Ordovician deposits along the Himalaya: Implications for the age and nature of rocks in the Mount Everest region". ''Geological Society of America Bulletin''. v. 121, no. 3-4, pp. 323–332.&lt;/ref&gt;

The bulk of Mount Everest, between {{convert|7,000|and|8,600|m|ft|abbr=on}}, consists of the [[North Col]] Formation, of which the Yellow Band forms its upper part between {{convert|8,200|to|8,600|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The Yellow Band consists of [[intercalation (geology)|intercalated]] beds of Middle [[Cambrian]] [[diopside]]-[[epidote]]-bearing [[marble]], which weathers a distinctive yellowish brown, and [[muscovite]]-[[biotite]] [[phyllite]] and [[schist|semischist]]. Petrographic analysis of marble collected from about {{convert|8,300|m|ft|abbr=on}} found it to consist as much as five percent of the ghosts of recrystallised crinoid ossicles. The upper five metres of the Yellow Band lying adjacent to the Qomolangma Detachment is badly deformed. A {{convert|5|–|40|cm|in|abbr=on}} thick fault [[breccia]] separates it from the overlying Qomolangma Formation.&lt;ref name="Scientiav5"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IslandArcv14"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MyrowOthers2009"/&gt;

The remainder of the North Col Formation, exposed between {{convert|7,000|to|8,200|m|ft|abbr=on}} on Mount Everest, consists of interlayered and deformed schist, phyllite, and minor marble. Between {{convert|7,600|and|8,200|m|ft|abbr=on}}, the North Col Formation consists chiefly of biotite-quartz phyllite and chlorite-biotite phyllite intercalated with minor amounts of biotite-[[sericite]]-quartz schist. Between {{convert|7,000|and|7,600|m|ft|abbr=on}}, the lower part of the North Col Formation consists of biotite-quartz schist intercalated with epidote-quartz schist, biotite-calcite-quartz schist, and thin layers of [[quartz]]ose [[marble]]. These metamorphic rocks appear to be the result of the metamorphism of Middle to Early Cambrian deep sea [[flysch]] composed of interbedded, [[mudstone]], [[shale]], clayey [[sandstone]], calcareous sandstone, [[graywacke]], and sandy limestone. The base of the North Col Formation is a regional low-angle normal fault called the "Lhotse detachment".&lt;ref name="Scientiav5"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IslandArcv14"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MyrowOthers2009"/&gt;

Below 7,000&amp;nbsp;m (23,000&amp;nbsp;ft), the Rongbuk Formation underlies the North Col Formation and forms the base of Mount Everest. It consists of [[sillimanite]]-[[K-feldspar]] grade schist and [[gneiss]] intruded by numerous [[sill (geology)|sills]] and [[dike (geology)|dikes]] of [[granite|leucogranite]] ranging in thickness from 1&amp;nbsp;cm to 1,500&amp;nbsp;m (0.4&amp;nbsp;in to 4,900&amp;nbsp;ft).&lt;ref name="IslandArcv14"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Searle1999a"&gt;Searle, M.P.

Journal of Asian Earth Sciences. v. 17, no. 5-6, pp. 773–783.&lt;/ref&gt; These leucogranites are part of a belt of Late [[Oligocene]]–[[Miocene]] intrusive rocks known as the Higher Himalayan leucogranite. They formed as the result of partial melting of [[Paleoproterozoic]] to Ordovician high-grade metasedimentary rocks of the Higher Himalayan Sequence about 20 to 24 million years ago during the subduction of the Indian Plate.&lt;ref name="GuoOthers2012"&gt;Guo, Z., and M.

Climbers typically aim for a 7- to 10-day window in the spring and fall when the Asian [[monsoon]] season is either starting up or ending and the winds are lighter. The air pressure at the summit is about one-third what it is at sea level, and by [[Bernoulli's principle]], the winds can lower the pressure further, causing an additional 14 percent reduction in oxygen to climbers.&lt;ref name=Peplow2004/&gt; The reduction in oxygen availability comes from the reduced overall pressure, not a reduction in the ratio of oxygen to other gases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.thetech.org/exhibits/online/everest/about/physiology.htm| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150713003833/https://www.thetech.org/exhibits/online/everest/about/physiology.htm|archivedate=13 July 2015|title=The Physiological Effects of Altitude|website=TheTech|accessdate=20 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer, the Indian monsoon brings warm wet air from the Indian Ocean to Everest's south side. During the winter the west-southwest flowing jet stream shifts south and blows on the peak.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

[[File:1963 reunion of the 1953 Everest-climbing expedition.jpg|thumb|Reunion of the 1953 British team]]
Because Mount Everest is the highest mountain in the world, it has attracted considerable attention and climbing attempts. A set of climbing routes has been established over several decades of climbing expeditions to the mountain. Whether the mountain was climbed in ancient times is unknown. It may have been climbed in 1924.

===Overview===
Everest's first known summitting occurred by 1953, and interest by climbers increased.&lt;ref name=la&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1987-01-04/news/mn-1935_1_everest-climb-mt|title=Mt. Everest's Popularity Is Still Climbing|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=20 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the effort and attention poured into expeditions, only about 200 people had summitted by 1987.&lt;ref name=la/&gt; Everest remained a difficult climb for decades, even for serious attempts by professional climbers and large national expeditions, which were the norm until the commercial era began in the 1990s.&lt;ref name=japtimes&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/life/2012/05/27/general/japans-everest-timeline/#.VZ6oDfBdgnd|last1=James |first1=Victoria|title=Japan's Everest timeline|date=27 May 2012|website=The Japan Times|accessdate=20 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By March 2012, Everest had been climbed 5,656 times with 223 deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/IOTD/view.php?id=82578|title=The World's Tallest Mountain|date=2 January 2014|website=Earth Observatory|publisher=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although lower mountains have longer or steeper climbs, Everest is so high the [[jet stream]] can hit it. Climbers can be faced with winds beyond {{convert|200|mph|km/h|abbr=on|order=flip}} when the weather shifts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alanarnette.com/kids/everestfacts.php|title=Everest Facts for Kids}}&lt;/ref&gt; At certain times of the year the jet stream shifts north, providing periods of relative calm at the mountain.&lt;ref name=wind&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accuweather.com/en/weather-news/window-of-opportunity-everest/64450|title=Window of Opportunity: Everest Climbing Season Underway|website=Accuweather}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other dangers include blizzards and avalanches.&lt;ref name=wind/&gt;

By 2013, [[The Himalayan Database]] recorded 6,871 summits by 4,042 different people.&lt;ref name="alanarnette.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alanarnette.com/blog/2014/02/20/everest-numbers-latest-summit-stats/|title=Everest by the Numbers: The Latest Summit Stats|website=alanarnette.com|format=Blog|accessdate=20 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early attempts===
In 1885, [[Clinton Thomas Dent]], president of the [[Alpine Club (UK)|Alpine Club]], suggested that climbing Mount Everest was possible in his book ''Above the Snow Line''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.billbuxton.com/everest.pdf |title=From First Sight to Summit: A Guide to the Literature on Everest up to the 1953 Ascent |date=5 October 2015|accessdate=31 January 2017 |format=PDF |author=William Buxton}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The northern approach to the mountain was discovered by [[George Mallory]] and [[Guy Bullock]] on the initial [[1921 British Mount Everest reconnaissance expedition|1921 British Reconnaissance Expedition]]. It was an exploratory expedition not equipped for a serious attempt to climb the mountain. With Mallory leading (and thus becoming the first European to set foot on Everest's flanks) they climbed the North Col to an altitude of {{convert|7005|m|ft|0}}. From there, Mallory espied a route to the top, but the party was unprepared for the great task of climbing any further and descended.

The British returned for a [[1922 British Mount Everest Expedition|1922 expedition]]. [[George Finch (chemist)|George Finch]] climbed using oxygen for the first time. He ascended at a remarkable speed—{{convert|290|m|ft|0}} per hour, and reached an altitude of {{convert|8320|m|ft|-1|abbr=on}}, the first time a human reported to climb higher than 8,000 m. Mallory and [[Edward Felix Norton|Col. Felix Norton]] made a second unsuccessful attempt. Mallory was faulted{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} for leading a group down from the North Col which got caught in an avalanche. Mallory was pulled down too but survived. Seven native porters were killed.

The [[1924 British Mount Everest Expedition|next expedition was in 1924]]. The initial attempt by Mallory and [[Geoffrey Bruce (mountaineer)|Geoffrey Bruce]] was aborted when weather conditions prevented the establishment of Camp&amp;nbsp;VI. The next attempt was that of Norton and Somervell, who climbed without oxygen and in perfect weather, traversing the North Face into the [[Great Couloir]]. Norton managed to reach {{convert|8550|m|ft|abbr=on}}, though he ascended only {{convert|30|m|ft|abbr=on}} or so in the last hour. Mallory rustled up oxygen equipment for a last-ditch effort. He chose young Andrew Irvine as his partner.

[[File:Condor Films 1952.jpg|thumb|left|upright|1952 documentary]]

On 8 June 1924, George Mallory and [[Andrew Irvine (mountaineer)|Andrew Irvine]] made an attempt on the summit via the North Col-North Ridge-Northeast Ridge route from which they never returned. On 1 May 1999, the [[Mallory and Irvine Research Expedition]] found Mallory's body on the North Face in a snow basin below and to the west of the traditional site of Camp&amp;nbsp;VI. Controversy has raged in the mountaineering community whether one or both of them reached the summit 29&amp;nbsp;years before the confirmed ascent and safe descent of Everest by Sir [[Edmund Hillary]] and [[Tenzing Norgay]] in 1953.

In 1933, [[Lucy, Lady Houston|Lady Houston]], a British [[millionairess]], funded the ''Houston Everest Flight of 1933'', which saw a formation of [[Westland Wallace|aircraft]] led by the [[Douglas Douglas-Hamilton, 14th Duke of Hamilton|Marquess of Clydesdale]] fly over the [[summit (topography)|summit]] in an effort to deploy the British [[Union Flag]] at the top.&lt;ref name=flymicro&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flymicro.com/everest/index.cfm?page=docs%2FHistory%2FAeroplanes.htm |title=Aeroplane expeditions to Everest|publisher=flymicro.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=k2news_woe&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.k2news.com/wingsover.htm |title=Wings Over Everest 2003|publisher=Everestnews.com|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Flying Over World's Highest Peak|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8ScDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA20|issue=5|journal=[[Popular Science]]|volume=122|date=May 1933|page=20|publisher=Bonnier Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early expeditions—such as [[Charles Granville Bruce|General Charles Bruce]]'s in the 1920s and [[Hugh Ruttledge]]'s two unsuccessful attempts in [[1933 British Mount Everest expedition|1933]] and [[1936 British Mount Everest expedition|1936]]—tried to ascend the mountain from [[Tibet]], via the North Face. Access was closed from the north to Western expeditions in 1950 after China took control of Tibet. In 1950, [[Bill Tilman]] and a small party which included [[Charles Snead Houston|Charles Houston]], Oscar Houston, and Betsy Cowles undertook an [[Mount Everest reconnaissance from Nepal#1950 Houston–Tilman exploration of Solu Khumbu|exploratory expedition to Everest through Nepal]] along the route which has now become the standard approach to Everest from the south.&lt;ref name=evhist_timeline&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.everesthistory.com/time3.htm |title=Everest History Time Line |website=Everest History |year=2003 |accessdate=17 June 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100526185812/http://www.everesthistory.com/time3.htm |archivedate=26 May 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[1952 Swiss Mount Everest Expedition|Swiss Expedition]] of 1952, led by [[Edouard Wyss-Dunant]], was granted permission to attempt a climb from Nepal. The expedition established a route through the Khumbu icefall and ascended to the South Col at an elevation of {{convert|7986|m|ft|abbr=on}}. No attempt at an ascent of Everest was ever under consideration in this case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Excerpt from: Swiss Foundation for Alpine Research, 1939 to 1970|location=Zurich|date=1972|url=http://www.sfar-evev06.ch/en/expeditions/everest52f.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110308015050/http://www.sfar-evev06.ch/en/expeditions/everest52f.html|archivedate=8 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Raymond Lambert]] and [[Sherpa people|Sherpa]] [[Tenzing Norgay]] were able to reach an elevation of about {{convert|8595|m|ft|abbr=on}} on the southeast ridge, setting a new climbing altitude record.

===First successful ascent by Tenzing and Hillary===
{{Main article|1953 British Mount Everest expedition}}
[[File:Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay.jpg|thumb|[[Edmund Hillary]] and [[Tenzing Norgay]]]]

In 1953, a ninth British expedition, led by [[John Hunt, Baron Hunt|John Hunt]], returned to Nepal. Hunt selected two climbing pairs to attempt to reach the summit. The first pair, [[Tom Bourdillon]] and [[Charles Evans (mountaineer)|Charles Evans]], came within {{convert|100|m|ft|abbr=on}} of the summit on 26 May 1953, but turned back after running into oxygen problems. As planned, their work in route finding and breaking trail and their oxygen caches were of great aid to the following pair. Two days later, the expedition made its second and final assault on the summit with its second climbing pair, the New Zealander [[Edmund Hillary]] and [[Tenzing Norgay]], a Nepali [[Sherpa people|Sherpa]] climber. They reached the summit at 11:30 local time on 29 May 1953 via the South Col route. At the time, both acknowledged it as a team effort by the whole expedition, but Tenzing revealed a few years later that Hillary had put his foot on the summit first.&lt;ref name="Ullman" /&gt; They paused at the summit to take photographs and buried a few sweets and a small cross in the snow before descending.

News of the expedition's success reached London on the morning of Queen [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Elizabeth II's]] [[coronation]], 2 June. A few days later, the Queen gave orders that Hunt (a Briton) and Hillary (a New Zealander) were to be [[Knighthood|knighted]] in the [[Order of the British Empire]] for the ascent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/39886/page/3273 |title=The London Gazette |date=6 June 1953 |access-date=27 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tenzing, a Nepali Sherpa who was a citizen of India, was granted the [[George Medal]] by the UK. Hunt was ultimately made a [[life peer]] in Britain, while Hillary became a founding member of the [[Order of New Zealand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.honours.govt.nz/honours/lists/onz |title= THE ORDER OF NEW ZEALAND (Instituted 1987) |website= Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet |access-date= 27 December 2015 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160106081352/http://www.honours.govt.nz/honours/lists/onz |archivedate= 6 January 2016 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hillary and Tenzing are also recognised in Nepal, where annual ceremonies in schools and offices celebrate their accomplishment.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}&lt;!-- not in the footnote--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.alpinist.com/doc/web07-08w/rb-ang-tshering-sherpa-hillary-tribute |title= Tribute to Sir Ed Hillary From Nepal |accessdate= 20 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next successful ascent was on 23 May 1956 by Ernst Schmied and [[Juerg Marmet]].&lt;ref name=swiss/&gt; This was followed by Dölf Reist and Hans-Rudolf von Gunten on 24 May 1957.&lt;ref name=swiss&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.everesthistory.com/climbers/schmied.htm|title=Ernst Schmied|publisher=EverestHistory.com|accessdate=10 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wang Fuzhou]], [[Gongbu (mountaineer)|Gonpo]] and Qu Yinhua of China made the first reported [[1960 Chinese Mount Everest expedition|ascent of the peak from the North Ridge]] on 25 May 1960.&lt;ref name=NorthRidge/&gt;&lt;ref name=1stNorthSlopeClimb/&gt; The first American to climb Everest, [[Jim Whittaker]], joined by [[Nawang Gombu]], reached the summit on 1 May 1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.everesthistory.com/climbers/whittaker.htm |title=Jim Whittaker |publisher=EverestHistory.com |accessdate=13 February 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="test"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/2007/1/2007_1_58.shtml|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081203164307/http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/2007/1/2007_1_58.shtml|

===1970 disaster===
{{see also|1970 Mount Everest disaster}}

In 1970 Japanese mountaineers conducted a major expedition. The centerpiece was a large "siege"-style expedition led by [[Saburo Matsukata]], working on finding a new route up the southwest face.{{sfnp|Unsworth|2000|p=594}} Another element of the expedition was an attempt to ski Mount Everest.&lt;ref name="japtimes"/&gt; Despite a staff of over one hundred people and a decade of planning work, the expedition suffered eight deaths and failed to summit via the planned routes.&lt;ref name=japtimes/&gt; However, Japanese expeditions did enjoy some successes. For example, [[Yuichiro Miura]] became the first man to ski down Everest from the South Col (he descended nearly 4,200 vertical feet from the South Col before falling with extreme injuries).

===1979/1980: Winter Himalaism===
[[File:Mount Everest winter 1980 cert.jpg|thumb|Confirmation of the summit obtained by the Nepalese Ministry of Tourism]]
The Polish climber [[Andrzej Zawada]] headed the first winter ascent of Mt. Everest, the first winter ascent of an eight-thousander. The team of 20 Polish climbers and 4 Sherpas established a base camp on [[Khumbu Glacier]] in early January 1980. On 15 January, the team managed to set up Camp III at 7150 meters above sea level, but further action was stopped by hurricane-force winds. The weather improved after 11 February, when [[Leszek Cichy]], Walenty Fiut and [[Krzysztof Wielicki]] set up camp IV on [[South Col]] (7906 m). Cichy and Wielicki started the final ascent at 6:50 AM on 17 February. At 2:40 PM [[Andrzej Zawada]] at base camp heard the climbers' voices over the radio - "We are on the summit! The strong wind blows all the time. It is unimaginably cold."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.alpinejournal.org.uk/Contents/Contents_1984_files/AJ%201984%2050-59%20Zawada%20Everest.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="theclymb.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.theclymb.com/passions/history-2/ice-warriors-polands-golden-alpine-generation/|title=The Ice Warriors: Poland's Golden Alpine Generation|date=30 March 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://winterclimb.com/articles/item/111-mount-everest-first-winter-ascent-1980|title=The first winter ascent of Mount Everest - WinterClimb.com|first=Damian|last=Granowski|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://himalman.wordpress.com/2007/11/13/krzysztof-wielicki-polish-winter-expedition-1980-part-1/|title=Krzysztof Wielicki – Polish Winter Expedition 1980  – part 1|date=13 November 2007|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The successful winter ascent of Mt.

===1996 disaster===
{{main article|1996 Mount Everest disaster}}
On 11 May 1996 eight climbers died after several expeditions were caught in a blizzard high up on the mountain. During the 1996 season, 15 people died while climbing on Mount Everest. These were the highest death tolls for a single event, and for a single season, until the sixteen deaths in the [[2014 Mount Everest avalanche]]. The disaster gained wide publicity and raised questions about the commercialisation of climbing Mount Everest.

Journalist [[Jon Krakauer]], on assignment from ''[[Outside (magazine)|Outside]]'' magazine, was in one of the affected parties, and afterward published the bestseller ''[[Into Thin Air]]'', which related his experience. [[Anatoli Boukreev]], a guide who felt impugned by Krakauer's book, co-authored a rebuttal book called ''[[The Climb (book)|The Climb]].'' The dispute sparked a debate within the climbing community.&lt;!-- sentence regarding Krakauer as a personna non-grata removed until someone cites a source --&gt;

In May 2004, Kent Moore, a physicist, and John L. Semple, a surgeon, both researchers from the [[University of Toronto]], told ''[[New Scientist]]'' magazine that an analysis of weather conditions on 11 May suggested that freak weather caused oxygen levels to plunge approximately 14 percent.&lt;ref name="NewScientist"&gt;{{cite journal| title = The day the sky fell on Everest| journal = New Scientist| issue = 2449| page = 15| date = 29 May 2004| url = http://www.newscientisttech.com/article/mg18224492.200-the-day-the-sky-fell-on-everest.html| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070703183045/http://www.newscientisttech.com/article/mg18224492.200-the-day-the-sky-fell-on-everest.html| archivedate = 3 July 2007| accessdate = 11 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BioEd Online"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.bioedonline.org/news/news.cfm?art=986| title=High winds suck oxygen from Everest. Predicting pressure lows could protect climbers| accessdate=11 December 2006| last=Peplow| first=Mark| date=25 May 2004| publisher=BioEd Online| quote=Moore explains that these jet streaks can drag a huge draught of air up the side of the mountain, lowering the air pressure. He calculates that this typically reduces the partial pressure of oxygen in the air by about 6%, which translates to a 14% reduction in oxygen uptake for the climbers. Air at that altitude already contains only one third as much oxygen as sea-level air.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the survivors was [[Beck Weathers]], an American client of New Zealand-based guide service Adventure Consultants. Weathers was left for dead about 275 metres (900 feet) from Camp 4 at 7,950 metres (26,085 feet). After spending a night on the mountain, Weathers managed to find his way to Camp 4 with massive frostbite and vision impaired due to snow blindness.&lt;ref name="badassoftheweek.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=Beck Weathers|url=http://www.badassoftheweek.com/weathers.html|website=Badass of the Week}}&lt;/ref&gt; When he arrived at Camp 4, fellow climbers considered his condition terminal and left him in a tent to die overnight.&lt;ref name="DMag"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weathers|first1=Beck|title=MY JOURNEY HOME FROM EVEREST|journal=D Magazine|date=May 2000|url=http://www.dmagazine.com/publications/d-magazine/2000/may/my-journey-home-from-everest/|accessdate=31 January 2017|quote=They left me alone in [[Scott Fischer]]'s tent that night, expecting me to die. On a couple of occasions, I heard the others referring to 'a dead guy' in the tent. Who could that be? I wondered as I slipped in and out of wakefulness.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before leaving Camp 4 Jon Krakauer heard Weathers calling for help from his tent. Weathers' condition had not improved and an immediate descent to a lower elevation was deemed essential.&lt;ref name="DMag"/&gt; A helicopter rescue was considered but was out of the question: Camp 4 was higher than the rated ceiling of any available helicopter and in any case would be extraordinarily dangerous. Eventually, a rescue was organised thanks to a lieutenant colonel of the Nepalese Army who conducted the second-highest known helicopter [[medical evacuation]] up to that time.&lt;ref name="badassoftheweek.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DMag"/&gt;

The storm's impact on climbers on the North Ridge of Everest, where several climbers also died, was detailed in a first-hand account by British filmmaker and writer [[Matt Dickinson]] in his book ''The Other Side of Everest''. 16-year-old Mark Pfetzer was on the climb and wrote about it in his account, ''Within Reach: My Everest Story''.

The 2015 feature film ''[[Everest (2015 film)|Everest]]'', directed by [[Baltasar Kormákur]], is based on the events of this disaster.&lt;ref name=Baltasar&gt;{{cite news|last=Hopewell|first=John|title='2 Guns' Helmer Kormakur Set to Climb 'Everest'|url=https://variety.com/2013/film/international/2-guns-kormakur-set-to-climb-everest-1200574821/|accessdate=17 January 2014|newspaper=Variety|date=6 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 12 people died. One death in particular (see below) triggered an international debate and years of discussion about climbing ethics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/05/25/travel/everest-2012-anniversary/|title=Striving for Everest: World's highest battle - CNN.com|author=Ashley Strickland, CNN|date=25 May 2013|work=CNN|accessdate=20 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The season was also remembered for the rescue of [[Lincoln Hall (climber)|Lincoln Hall]] who had been left by his climbing team and declared dead, but was later discovered alive and survived being helped off the mountain.

====David Sharp ethics controversy====
There was an international controversy about the death of a solo British climber [[David Sharp (mountaineer)|David Sharp]], who attempted to climb Mount Everest in 2006 but died in his attempt. The story broke out of the mountaineering community into popular media, with a series of interviews, allegations, and critiques. The question was whether climbers that season had left a man to die and whether he could have been saved. He was said to have attempted to summit Mount Everest by himself with no Sherpa or guide and fewer oxygen bottles than considered normal.&lt;ref name=top&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.outsideonline.com/1909966/over-top|title=Over the Top|website=Outside Online|accessdate=20 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He went with a low-budget Nepali guide firm that only provides support up to Base Camp, after which climbers go as a "loose group", offering a high degree of independence. The manager at Sharp's guide support said Sharp did not take enough oxygen for his summit attempt and did not have a Sherpa guide.&lt;ref name="washingtontimes.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2006/may/22/20060522-110420-9433r/|title=Everest climber left to die alone|website=The Washington Times|accessdate=20 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is less clear who knew Sharp was in trouble, and if they did know, whether they were qualified or capable of helping him.&lt;ref name=top/&gt; 

Double-amputee climber [[Mark Inglis]] said in an interview with the press on 23 May 2006, that his climbing party, and many others, had passed Sharp, on 15 May, sheltering under a rock overhang {{convert|450|m|ft}} below the summit, without attempting a rescue.&lt;ref name=abcnews052006&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200605/s1645603.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060823184345/http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200605/s1645603.htm|archivedate=23 August 2006|title=Everest climber defends leaving dying Briton|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|date=23 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inglis said 40 people had passed by Sharp, but he might have been overlooked as climbers assumed Sharp was the corpse nicknamed "[[Green Boots]]",&lt;ref name=Sharp&gt;{{cite news |last1=Breed |first1=Allen G. |last2=Gurubacharya |first2=Binaj | url = http://english.ohmynews.com/articleview/article_view.asp?menu=c10400&amp;no=305837&amp;rel_no=1 | title = Part II: Near top of Everest, he waves off fellow climbers: 'I just want to sleep' | date = 18 July 2006 | work = Oh My News}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Inglis was not aware that Turkish climbers had tried to help Sharp despite being in the process of helping an injured woman down (a Turkish woman named [[Burçak Özoğlu Poçan|Burçak Poçan]]). There has also been some discussion about [[Himex]] in the commentary on Inglis and Sharp. In regards to Inglis's initial comments, he later revised certain details because he had been interviewed while he was "...physically and mentally exhausted, and in a lot of pain. He had suffered severe frostbite — he later had five fingertips amputated." When they went through Sharp's possessions they found a receipt for $7,490USD, believed to be the whole financial cost.&lt;ref name=thefever&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/3662508/Summit-fever.html|title=Summit fever|author=Ed Douglas|date=13 January 2007|website=Telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=20 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Comparatively, most expeditions are between $35,000 to $100,000USD plus an additional $20,000 in other expenses that range from gear to bonuses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://business.time.com/2012/01/23/the-economics-of-everest/|title=How Much it Costs to Climb Mount Everest - TIME.com|website=TIME.com|accessdate=20 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was estimated on 14 May that Sharp summitted Mount Everest and began his descent down, but 15 May he was in trouble but being passed by climbers on their way up and down.&lt;ref name=change/&gt; On 15 May 2006 it is believed he was suffering from hypoxia and was about 1,000 feet from the summit on the North Side route.&lt;ref name=change/&gt;

Some climbers who left him said that the rescue efforts would have been useless and only have caused more deaths.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} [[Beck Weathers]] of the [[1996 Mount Everest disaster]] said that those who are dying are often left behind and that he himself had been left for dead twice but was able to keep walking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/07/16/AR2006071600309_pf.html|title=Did Everest Climber Sharp Have to Die?|website=washingtonpost.com|accessdate=20 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Tribune'' of India quoted someone who described what happened to Sharp as "the most shameful act in the history of mountaineering".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2006/20061210/spectrum/main6.htm|title=The Sunday Tribune – Spectrum|website=tribuneindia.com|accessdate=20 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to Sharp's death, at least nine other climbers perished that year, including multiple Sherpas working for various guiding companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.explorersweb.com/everest_k2/news.php?id=7925|title=Everest K2 News ExplorersWeb – Un-named Everest Sherpa gets a name – and fatality details|website=explorersweb.com|accessdate=20 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of this controversy was captured by the ''[[Discovery Channel]]'' while filming the television program ''[[Everest: Beyond the Limit]]''. A crucial decision affecting the fate of Sharp is shown in the program, where an early returning climber Lebanese adventurer [[Maxim Chaya]] is descending from the summit and radios to his base camp manager ([[Russell Brice]]) that he has found a frostbitten and unconscious climber in distress. Chaya is unable to identify Sharp, who had chosen to climb solo without any support and so did not identify himself to other climbers. The base camp manager assumes that Sharp is part of a group that has already calculated that they must abandon him, and informs his lone climber that there is no chance of him being able to help Sharp by himself. As Sharp's condition deteriorates through the day and other descending climbers pass him, his opportunities for rescue diminish: his legs and feet curl from [[frostbite]], preventing him from walking; the later descending climbers are lower on oxygen and lack the strength to offer aid; time runs out for any Sherpas to return and rescue him.

David Sharp's body remained just below the summit on the Chinese side next to "Green Boots"; they shared a space in a small rock cave that was an ad hoc tomb for them.&lt;ref name="change"&gt;{{cite book|author1=D.

====Lincoln Hall rescue====
As the Sharp debate kicked off, on 26 May 2006 Australian climber [[Lincoln Hall (climber)|Lincoln Hall]] was found alive, after being left for dead the day before.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; He was found by a party of four climbers ([[Dan Mazur]], Andrew Brash, Myles Osborne and Jangbu Sherpa) who, giving up their own summit attempt, stayed with Hall and descended with him and a party of 11 Sherpas sent up to carry him down. Hall later fully recovered. His team assumed he had died from cerebral edema, and they were instructed to cover him with rocks.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/nepal/1519597/Climber-declared-dead-on-Everest-is-brought-down-alive.html|title=Climber declared dead on Everest is brought down alive|last=Sydney|first=By Nick Squires in|work=Telegraph.co.uk|access-date=16 May 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There were no rocks around to do this and he was abandoned.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/25/world/asia/lincoln-hall-australian-mountaineer-dies-at-56.html|title=Lincoln Hall, Australian Mountaineer, Dies at 56|first=Bruce|last=Weber|date=24 March 2012|publisher=|accessdate=23 October 2017|via=www.nytimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The erroneous information of his death was passed on to his family.

{{quote|I imagine you are surprised to see me here.|Lincoln Hall&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;}}
Lincoln Hall went on to live for several more years, often giving talks about his near-death experience and rescue, before dying from medical issues in 2012 at the age of 56 (born in 1955).&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/25/world/asia/lincoln-hall-australian-mountaineer-dies-at-56.html|title=Lincoln Hall, Australian Mountaineer, Dies at 56|last=Weber|first=Bruce|date=24 March 2012|work=The New York Times|access-date=16 May 2017|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2007===
Similar heroic rescue actions have been recorded since Hall, including on 21 May 2007, when Canadian climber Meagan McGrath initiated the successful high-altitude rescue of [[Nepal]]i Usha Bista. Recognising her heroic rescue, Major Meagan McGrath was selected as a 2011 recipient of the [[Sir Edmund Hillary]] Foundation of Canada Humanitarian Award, which recognises a Canadian who has personally or administratively contributed a significant service or act in the Himalayan Region of Nepal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesiredmundhillaryfoundation.ca/ |title=Sir Edmund Hillary Foundation of Canada |publisher=Thesiredmundhillaryfoundation.ca |accessdate=15 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ascent statistics up to 2010 season===
[[File:EverestAscents.svg|thumb|left|Ascents of Mount Everest by year through 2010]]
[[File:Sunrise over Everest.jpg|thumb|The sun rising on Everest in 2011]]
By the end of the 2010 climbing season, there had been 5,104 ascents to the summit by about 3,142 individuals, with 77% of these ascents being accomplished since 2000.&lt;ref name=8000ers /&gt; The summit was achieved in 7 of the 22 years from 1953 to 1974 and was not missed between 1975 and 2014.&lt;ref name=8000ers /&gt; In 2007, the record number of 633 ascents was recorded, by 350 climbers and 253 [[Sherpa people|sherpas]].&lt;ref name=8000ers /&gt;

A remarkable illustration of the explosion of popularity of Everest is provided by the numbers of daily ascents. Analysis of the [[1996 Mount Everest disaster]] shows that part of the blame was on the bottleneck caused by a large number of climbers (33 to 36) attempting to summit on the same day; this was considered unusually high at the time. By comparison, on 23 May 2010, the summit of Mount Everest was reached by 169 climbers – more summits in a single day than in the cumulative 31 years from the first successful summit in 1953 through 1983.&lt;ref name=8000ers /&gt;

There have been 219 fatalities recorded on Mount Everest from the [[1922 British Mount Everest Expedition]] through the end of 2010, a rate of 4.3 fatalities for every 100 summits (this is a general rate, and includes fatalities amongst support climbers, those who turned back before the peak, those who died en route to the peak and those who died while descending from the peak). Of the 219 fatalities, 58 (26.5%) were climbers who had summited but did not complete their descent.&lt;ref name=8000ers /&gt; Though the rate of fatalities has decreased since the year 2000 (1.4 fatalities for every 100 summits, with 3938 summits since 2000), the significant increase in the total number of climbers still means 54 fatalities since 2000: 33 on the northeast ridge, 17 on the southeast ridge, 2 on the southwest face, and 2 on the north face.&lt;ref name=8000ers /&gt;

Nearly all attempts at the summit are done using one of the two main routes. The traffic seen by each route varies from year to year. In 2005–07, more than half of all climbers elected to use the more challenging, but cheaper northeast route. In 2008, the northeast route was closed by the Chinese government for the entire climbing season, and the only people able to reach the summit from the north that year were athletes responsible for [[2008 Summer Olympics summit of Mt. Everest|carrying the Olympic torch]] for the [[2008 Summer Olympics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/15/world/asia/15nepal.html|title=Nepal Puts Everest Off Limits During China's Olympic Torch Relay in May | work=The New York Times | first=Somini|last=Sengupta|date=15 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The route was closed to foreigners once again in 2009 in the run-up to the 50th anniversary of the Dalai Lama's exile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/china/4806464/China-closes-Tibetan-side-of-Everest-to-climbers-ahead-of-anniversary-of-Dalai-Lamas-exile.html|title=China closes Tibetan side of Everest to climbers ahead of anniversary of Dalai Lama's exile | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Malcolm|last=Moore|date=25 February 2009|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; These closures led to declining interest in the north route, and, in 2010, two-thirds of the climbers reached the summit from the south.&lt;ref name=8000ers /&gt;

===2014 avalanche and season===
{{main article|2014 Mount Everest avalanche}}
[[File:Mt Everest.jpg|thumb|Mount Everest, 2014]]

On 18 April 2014, an avalanche hit the area just below the Base Camp 2 at around 01:00 UTC (06:30 local time) and at an elevation of about {{convert|5,900|m}}.&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{Cite news |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-27075638 |title= Everest avalanche kills at least 12 Sherpa guides |work= BBC News |date= 18 April 2014 |accessdate= 18 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sixteen people were killed in the avalanche (all Nepalese guides) and nine more were injured.&lt;ref name=NYr&gt;{{cite news |last=Krakauer |first= Jon |title= Death and Anger on Everest |url= http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/newsdesk/2014/04/everest-sherpas-death-and-anger.html |accessdate= 22 April 2014 |work= [[The New Yorker]] |date=21 April 2014 |quote=Of the twenty-five men hit by the falling ice, sixteen were killed, all of them Nepalis working for guided climbing teams.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was not the only tragedy in the region, with over 43 killed in the [[2014 Nepal snowstorm disaster]], and they were not even summiting but rather trekking the [[Annapurna Circuit]].

One positive outcome of the season was a 13-year-old girl, Malavath Purna, reaching the summit, breaking the record for youngest female.&lt;ref name="Times of India"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/13-year-old-Andhra-teen-becomes-youngest-woman-to-scale-Everest/articleshow/35598021.cms | work= Times of India |title= 13-year-old Andhra teen becomes the youngest woman to scale Everest |accessdate= 25 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, one team used a helicopter to fly from south base camp to Camp 2 to avoid the Khumbu Icefall, then reached the Everest summit. This team had to use the south side because the Chinese had denied them a permit to climb. Nepal turned Chinese reluctance into a success for the country, with the executive donating tens of thousands of dollars to local hospitals and achieving a new hybrid aviation-mountaineering technique. She was named the Nepalese "International Mountaineer of the Year".&lt;ref name="news.nationalgeographic.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2014/08/140805-mount-everest-sherpa-mountain-climbing-jing-wang-avalanche/ |title= Woman Whose Post-Avalanche Everest Ascent Sparked Outrage Defends Her Feat |website= National Geographic |accessdate=20 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2015 avalanche, earthquake, season===
{{main article|2015 Mount Everest avalanches}}
[[File:Everest from Kalatop April 2015.jpg|thumb|Everest, April 2015]]

2015 was set to be a record-breaking season of climbs, with hundreds of permits issued in Nepal and many additional permits in Tibet (China). However, a magnitude 7.8 earthquake on 25 April 2015 effectively shut down the Everest climbing season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alanarnette.com/blog/2015/05/06/everest-2015-season-summary-summits-dont-matter-2/ |title= Everest 2015: Season Summary – Summits Don't Matter |website= alanarnette.com |format=Blog |accessdate=20 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2015 was the first time since 1974 with no spring summits, as all climbing teams pulled out after the quakes and avalanche.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://snowbrains.com/everest-will-not-be-climbed-for-first-time-since-1974/ |title= Mt.

One of the reasons for this was the high probability of aftershocks (over 50 percent according to the [[USGS]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://snowbrains.com/no-one-will-climb-everest-this-year/ |title= No One Will Climb Everest This Year – The Last Team Pulls Out |website= snowbrains.com |format= Blog |accessdate= 20 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Just weeks after the first quake, the region was rattled again by a 7.3 magnitude quake and there were also [[list of aftershocks of April 2015 Nepal earthquake|many considerable aftershocks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://theconversation.com/nepal-earthquake-such-huge-aftershocks-are-rare-41833 |title= Nepal earthquake: such huge aftershocks are rare |author=Nick Rawlinson |date=15 May 2015 |website= The Conversation |accessdate= 20 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of a death in which Dex was implicated was Dr. Eberhard Schaaf in 2012 on Everest. Schaaf died on descent at the south summit from altitude sickness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Billera |first=Michael |url= http://www.ibtimes.com/three-climbers-reported-dead-scaling-mount-everest-eberhard-schaaf-shriya-shah-and-song-won-bin-dead |title=Three Climbers Reported Dead Scaling Mount Everest: Eberhard Schaaf, Shriya Shah, and Song Won-bin Dead, Two Others Missing |website=IB Times |date=17 February 2010 |accessdate= 17 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has a good reputation as a life saver, and is commonly given to Everest climbers for its ability to intervene in last desperate moments when altitude sickness sets in. For example, in the 2016 season Robert Gropel said he gave Dex to his wife (as reported by the ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'') in attempt to save her as they tried to descend Everest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Chris Graham |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/05/31/it-breaks-my-heart-australian-climber-blames-himself-for-wifes-d/ |title= 'It breaks my heart': Australian climber blames himself for wife's death on Everest |work= The Daily Telegraph |date=31 May 2016 |location=London |accessdate= 17 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dex is just the tip of the iceberg, with the UIAA noting the aforementioned dexamethasone, but also [[acetazolamide]] (aka Diamox), [[amphetamine]], and [[alcohol]] use;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://docplayer.net/5637829-Official-standards-of-the-uiaa-medical-commission-vol-22a.html |title= UIAA OFFICIAL STANDARDS OF THE UIAA MEDICAL COMMISSION.

One of the big activities is trips to base camp (aka trekking), which can be higher than some of the highest mountains. The other big activity is serious attempts to make it to the top of Everest, and those in support of those attempts. The peak time for this is late May, because that is when the monsoons push the jet stream away, there is another time later in the year when the monsoon ends yielding another break in the weather, but there is more snow then. Some technology for climbing include [[crampons]], [[fixed ropes]], various cold-weather gear, [[bottled oxygen]], and weather prediction. Predicting the weather is critical; one of the big disasters came in 1996 when a storm hit during a summit bid.{{cn|date=December 2017}} 

In modern times, there is greater on-demand logistical support available such as internet access, but also some new challenges like not offending the locals and watching out for oxygen-bottle thefts. Helicopter support has grown and the availability of helicopter rescues increased, but there are limits on how high and in what weather they are able to fly. Modern dangers include unexpected avalanches (these claimed many lives in 2014 and 2015), sudden onset of altitude sickness, and classic climbing danger - falling. For a price, permits are available from both China in the Tibet region and from Nepal; there is a multitude of mountaineering firms from all over the world operating on the mountain.

===Permits===
There were 334 climbing permits issued in 2014 in Nepal, these were extended until 2019 due to the closure.&lt;ref name="ekantipur1"/&gt; In 2015 there was 357 permits to climb Everest, but the mountain was closed again because of the avalanche and earthquake, and these permits were given a two-year extension to 2017 (not to 2019 as with the 2014 issue).&lt;ref name="kathmandupost.ekantipur.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kathmandupost.ekantipur.com/news/2017-05-11/everest-expeditions-likely-to-be-delayed-by-bad-weather.html|title=Everest expeditions likely to be delayed by bad weather|website=ekantipur.com|accessdate=23 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ekantipur1"&gt;{{cite web|author=Sangam Prasain |url=http://kathmandupost.ekantipur.com/news/2016-02-20/everest-permits-to-be-extended.html |title=Kathmandu Post- Everest permits to be extended |publisher=Kathmandupost.ekantipur.com |date= |accessdate=17 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=June 2016}} This was an example of hospitality that Nepalis have become famous for; an extension was especially requested by expedition firms (which in turn bring resources into the country due for mountaineering). Nepal is essentially a "fourth world" country, as of 2015 one of the poorest non-African countries along with [[Haiti]] and [[Myanmar]], and the 19th poorest country in the world overall.&lt;ref name="bbc.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-31587654 |title=Everest permits: Climbers want Nepal 'to honour 2014 promise' – BBC News |publisher=Bbc.com |date= |accessdate=17 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/the-23-poorest-countries-in-the-world-2015-7|title=The 23 poorest countries in the world|website=businessinsider.com|accessdate=23 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, Nepal has been very welcoming to tourists and a significant tourism industry has been established.&lt;ref name="ekantipur1"/&gt; Although there are some difficulties, especially since it can be hard to maintain order in distant areas or control the actions of trouble-makers, there is a long history of going the extra kilometre for tourists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-4544860/Nepal-lets-Everest-permit-dodger-22-000-fine.html|title=Nepal lets Everest permit dodger off $22,000 fine|website=dailymail.co.uk|accessdate=23 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2017 a permit evader who tried to climb Everest without the 11,000 dollar permit, faced among other penalties a 22,000 dollar fine, bans, and a possible four years in jail after he was caught (he had made it up past the Khumbu icefall).&lt;ref name="Mail Online"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-4544860/Nepal-lets-Everest-permit-dodger-22-000-fine.html|title=Nepal lets Everest permit dodger off $22,000 fine|work=Dail Mail|access-date=26 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the end he was given a ten-year mountaineering ban in Nepal and allowed to return home according to the British newspaper ''[[Daily Mail]]''.&lt;ref name="Mail Online"/&gt; The rogue mountaineer, who in fact had not climbed other mountains, said he was "ecstatic" and that he would try again but buy a permit next time.&lt;ref name="Mail Online"/&gt;

===Routes===
[[File:STS058-101-12 2.JPG|thumb|Overview South Col route and North Col/Ridge route]]
Mt. Everest has two main climbing routes, the southeast ridge from [[Nepal]] and the north ridge from [[Tibet]], as well as many other less frequently climbed routes.&lt;ref name=evhist&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.everesthistory.com/routes.htm |title=Ascent Routes on Everest |publisher=EverestHistory.com |accessdate=21 January 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080115161830/http://www.everesthistory.com/routes.htm |archivedate=15 January 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the two main routes, the southeast ridge is technically easier and more frequently used. It was the route used by [[Edmund Hillary]] and [[Tenzing Norgay]] in 1953 and the first recognised of 15 routes to the top by 1996.&lt;ref name=evhist/&gt; This was, however, a route decision dictated more by politics than by design, as the Chinese border was closed to the western world in the 1950s, after the People's Republic of China [[Invasion of Tibet (1950)|invaded Tibet]].&lt;ref name=ngetl&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com//news/2003/04/0401_030401_everesttimeline.html| title=Everest Time Line: 80 Years of Triumph and Tragedy|publisher=National Geographic Society|last=Thompson|first=Kalee|date=2 April 2003|accessdate=28 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most attempts are made during May, before the summer [[monsoon]] season. As the monsoon season approaches, the [[jet stream]] shifts northward, thereby reducing the average wind speeds high on the mountain.&lt;ref name=nytimes&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E01EFDD1E38F93AA25756C0A961958260|title= Climbing Mount Everest|work=The New York Times|date=19 May 1997|accessdate=24 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=te03&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teameverest03.org/everest_info/index.html|title=Mt. Everest Information|author=Team Everest 03|accessdate=24 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; While attempts are sometimes made in September and October, after the monsoons, when the jet stream is again temporarily pushed northward, the additional snow deposited by the monsoons and the less stable weather patterns at the monsoons' tail end makes climbing extremely difficult.

====Southeast ridge====
The ascent via the southeast ridge begins with a trek to [[Everest Base Camp|Base Camp]] at {{convert|5380|m|ft|-2|abbr=on}} on the south side of Everest, in Nepal. Expeditions usually fly into [[Lukla]] (2,860&amp;nbsp;m) from [[Kathmandu]] and pass through [[Namche Bazaar]]. Climbers then hike to Base Camp, which usually takes six to eight days, allowing for proper altitude acclimatisation in order to prevent [[altitude sickness]].&lt;ref name=Acclimatization&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Muza, SR |author2=Fulco, CS |author3=Cymerman, A |title=Altitude Acclimatization Guide |journal=US Army Research Inst. Of Environmental Medicine Thermal and Mountain Medicine Division Technical Report |issue=USARIEM–TN–04–05 |year=2004 |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/7616 |accessdate=5 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Climbing equipment and supplies are carried by [[yak]]s, [[dzo]]pkyos (yak-cow hybrids), and human [[porter (carrier)|porters]] to Base Camp on the [[Khumbu Glacier]]. When Hillary and Tenzing climbed Everest in 1953, the British expedition they were part of (comprising over 400 climbers, porters, and Sherpas at that point) started from the [[Kathmandu Valley]], as there were no roads further east at that time.

Climbers spend a couple of weeks in Base Camp, acclimatising to the altitude. During that time, [[Sherpa (people)|Sherpas]] and some expedition climbers set up ropes and ladders in the treacherous [[Khumbu Icefall]].

[[Serac]]s, [[crevasse]]s, and shifting blocks of ice make the icefall one of the most dangerous sections of the route. Many climbers and Sherpas have been killed in this section. To reduce the hazard, climbers usually begin their ascent well before dawn, when the freezing temperatures glue ice blocks in place.

Above the icefall is Camp I at {{convert|6065|m|ft|-1}}.
[[File:Inside Khumbu-Icefall.jpg|thumb|Climber traversing Khumbu Icefall]]
From Camp I, climbers make their way up the [[Western Cwm]] to the base of the [[Lhotse]] face, where Camp II or Advanced Base Camp (ABC) is established at {{convert|6500|m|ft|-2|abbr=on}}. The Western Cwm is a flat, gently rising glacial valley, marked by huge lateral crevasses in the centre, which prevent direct access to the upper reaches of the Cwm. Climbers are forced to cross on the far right, near the base of [[Nuptse]], to a small passageway known as the "Nuptse corner". The Western Cwm is also called the "Valley of Silence" as the topography of the area generally cuts off wind from the climbing route. The [[high altitude]] and a clear, windless day can make the Western Cwm unbearably hot for climbers.&lt;ref name=nova-climb&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/everest/climb/waytosummitsou.html|title=The Way to the Summit|publisher=Public Broadcasting Corporation|website=NOVA Online|year=2000|accessdate=28 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From Advanced Base Camp, climbers ascend the Lhotse face on [[fixed rope]]s, up to Camp III, located on a small ledge at {{convert|7470|m|ft|-2|abbr=on}}. From there, it is another 500 metres to Camp IV on the [[South Col]] at {{convert|7920|m|ft|-2|abbr=on}}.

From Camp III to Camp IV, climbers are faced with two additional challenges: the [[Geneva Spur]] and the [[Yellow Band]]. The Geneva Spur is an anvil shaped rib of black rock named by the [[1952 Swiss Mount Everest Expedition|1952 Swiss expedition]]. Fixed ropes assist climbers in [[scrambling]] over this snow covered rock band. The Yellow Band is a section of interlayered [[marble]], [[phyllite]], and [[schist|semischist]], which also requires about 100 metres of rope for traversing it.&lt;ref name=nova-climb/&gt;

On the [[South Col]], climbers enter the [[death zone]]. Climbers making summit bids typically can endure no more than two or three days at this altitude. That's one reason why clear weather and low winds are critical factors in deciding whether to make a summit attempt. If the weather does not cooperate within these short few days, climbers are forced to descend, many all the way back down to Base Camp.

From Camp IV, climbers begin their summit push around midnight, with hopes of reaching the summit (still another 1,000 metres above) within 10 to 12 hours. Climbers first reach "The Balcony" at {{convert|8400|m|ft|-2|abbr=on}}, a small platform where they can rest and gaze at peaks to the south and east in the early light of dawn. Continuing up the ridge, climbers are then faced with a series of imposing rock steps which usually forces them to the east into the waist-deep snow, a serious [[avalanche]] hazard. At {{convert|8750|m|ft|-2|abbr=on}}, a small table-sized dome of ice and snow marks the [[South Summit (Everest)|South Summit]].&lt;ref name=nova-climb/&gt;

From the South Summit, climbers follow the knife-edge southeast ridge along what is known as the "Cornice traverse", where snow clings to intermittent rock. This is the most exposed section of the climb, and a misstep to the left would send one {{convert|2,400|m|ft|abbr=on}} down the southwest face, while to the immediate right is the {{convert|3,050|m|ft|abbr=on}} [[Kangshung Face]]. At the end of this traverse is an imposing {{convert|12|m|ft|abbr=on}} rock wall, the [[Hillary Step]], at {{convert|8790|m|ft|-1|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=qJjIBFOMsQsC&amp;pg=PT111&amp;dq=hillary+step#v=onepage&amp;q=hillary%20step&amp;f=false|title=ON TOP OF WORLD: My Everest Adventure|last=Vajpai|first=Arjun|date=10 November 2010|publisher=Penguin UK|isbn=9788184753042|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hillary and Tenzing were the first climbers to ascend this step, and they did so use primitive ice climbing equipment and ropes. Nowadays, climbers ascend this step using fixed ropes previously set up by Sherpas. Once above the step, it is a comparatively easy climb to the top on moderately angled snow slopes—though the [[exposure (heights)|exposure]] on the ridge is extreme, especially while traversing large cornices of snow. With increasing numbers of people climbing the mountain in recent years, the Step has frequently become a bottleneck, with climbers forced to wait significant amounts of time for their turn on the ropes, leading to problems in getting climbers efficiently up and down the mountain.

After the Hillary Step, climbers also must traverse a loose and rocky section that has a large entanglement of fixed ropes that can be troublesome in bad weather. Climbers typically spend less than half an hour at the summit to allow time to descend to Camp IV before darkness sets in, to avoid serious problems with afternoon weather, or because supplemental oxygen tanks run out.

====North ridge route====
{{see also|Three Steps}}
[[File:Mount Everest North Face.jpg|thumb|Mount Everest north face from [[Rongbuk Monastery|Rongbuk]] in Tibet]]
The north ridge route begins from the north side of Everest, in Tibet. Expeditions trek to the [[Rongbuk Glacier]], setting up base camp at {{convert|5180|m|ft|-1|abbr=on}} on a gravel plain just below the glacier. To reach Camp II, climbers ascend the medial moraine of the east Rongbuk Glacier up to the base of [[Changtse]], at around {{convert|6100|m|ft|-2|abbr=on}}. Camp III (ABC—Advanced Base Camp) is situated below the [[North Col]] at {{convert|6,500|m|ft|abbr=on}}. To reach Camp IV on the North Col, climbers ascend the glacier to the foot of the col where fixed ropes are used to reach the North Col at {{convert|7010|m|ft|-2|abbr=on}}. From the North Col, climbers ascend the rocky north ridge to set up Camp V at around {{convert|7775|m|ft|-2|abbr=on}}. The route crosses the North Face in a diagonal climb to the base of the Yellow Band, reaching the site of Camp VI at {{convert|8230|m|ft|-2|abbr=on}}. From Camp VI, climbers make their final summit push.

Climbers face a treacherous traverse from the base of the First Step: ascending from {{convert|8501|to|8534|m|ft|-1|abbr=on}}, to the crux of the climb, the Second Step, ascending from {{convert|8577|to|8626|m|ft|-1|abbr=on}}. (The Second Step includes a climbing aid called the "Chinese ladder", a metal ladder placed semi-permanently in 1975 by a party of Chinese climbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.affimer.org/hemmleb7.html|publisher=AFFIMER|title=Chinese ladder}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been almost continuously in place since, and ladders have been used by virtually all climbers on the route.) Once above the Second Step the inconsequential Third Step is clambered over, ascending from {{convert|8690|to|8800|m|ft|-1|abbr=on}}. Once above these steps, the summit pyramid is climbed by a snow slope of 50 degrees, to the final summit ridge along which the top is reached.&lt;ref name=NOVA_wtsn&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/everest/climb/waytosummitnor.html|title=The Way to the Summit (North)|publisher=Public Broadcasting Corporation|website=NOVA Online|year=2000|accessdate=28 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Summit===
[[File:Amanecer desde la cima del Everest por Carlos Pauner.JPG|thumb|left|A view from the summit of Mount Everest in May 2013]]
The routes usually share one spot in common, the summit itself. The summit of Everest has been described as "the size of a dining room table".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swindonadvertiser.co.uk/news/local/9046854.Swindon_explorer_on_top_of_the_world/|title=Swindon explorer on top of the world|website=Swindon Advertiser|accessdate=20 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The summit is capped with snow over ice over rock, and the layer of snow varies from year to year.&lt;ref name=sci&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.extremescience.com/everest.htm|title=Highest Mountain – Everest|website=extremescience.com|accessdate=20 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rock summit is made of Ordovician [[limestone]] and is a low-grade metamorphic rock according to Montana State University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.montana.edu/everest/facts/morefacts/ff06.htm |title=Montana State University – Everest Education Expedition – Everest Facts |publisher=Montana.edu |date= |accessdate=17 June 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305013250/http://www.montana.edu/everest/facts/morefacts/ff06.htm |archive-date=5 March 2016 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; (see survey section for more on its height and about the Everest rock summit)

Below the summit there is an area known as "rainbow valley", filled with dead bodies still wearing brightly coloured winter gear. Down to about 8000 metres is an area commonly called the "death zone", due to the high danger and low oxygen because of the low pressure.&lt;ref name=dz/&gt;

Below the summit the mountain slopes downward to the three main sides, or faces, of Mount Everest: the [[North Face (Everest)|North Face]], the South-West Face, and the East/[[Kangshung Face]].&lt;ref name="facts"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.everest1953.co.uk/Facts.php |title=Everest Facts |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150509045702/http://www.everest1953.co.uk/Facts.php |archivedate=9 May 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death zone===
{{See also|Effects of high altitude on humans}}
[[File:Everest Peace Project - Everest summit.jpg|thumb|The summit of Mount Everest from the North side]]
[[File:Everest-fromKalarPatar.jpg|thumb|From [[Kala Patthar]]]]
At the higher regions of Mount Everest, climbers seeking the summit typically spend substantial time within the [[Effects of high altitude on humans#Death zone|death zone]] (altitudes higher than {{convert|8000|m|ft}}), and face significant challenges to survival. Temperatures can dip to very low levels, resulting in [[frostbite]] of any body part exposed to the air. Since temperatures are so low, snow is well-frozen in certain areas and death or injury by slipping and falling can occur. High winds at these altitudes on Everest are also a potential threat to climbers.

Another significant [[Breathing#Air pressure|threat to climbers is low atmospheric pressure]]. The atmospheric pressure at the top of Everest is about a third of sea level pressure or {{convert|0.333|atm|mbar}}, resulting in the availability of only about a third as much oxygen to breathe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.altitude.org/calculators/air_pressure.php |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120729214053/http://www.altitude.org/calculators/air_pressure.php |dead-url=yes |archive-date=29 July 2012 |title=Online high altitude oxygen calculator |publisher=altitude.org |accessdate=15 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Debilitating effects of the death zone are so great that it takes most climbers up to 12 hours to walk the distance of {{convert|1.72|km|mi}} from South Col to the summit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alanarnette.com/everest/everestsouthroutes.php|title=Mount Everest South Col Route Maps|publisher=alanarnette.com|accessdate=15 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Achieving even this level of performance requires prolonged altitude acclimatisation, which takes 40–60 days for a typical expedition. A sea-level dweller exposed to the atmospheric conditions at the altitude above {{convert|8500|m|abbr=on}} without acclimatisation would likely lose consciousness within 2 to 3 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.semae.es/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/climbers-on-mt-everest-.pdf|title=Arterial Blood Gases and Oxygen Content in Climbers on Mount Everest|journal=The New England Journal of Medicine|year=2009|first=Michael P.W.|last=Grocott|doi=10.1056/NEJMoa0801581|volume=360|issue=2|pages=140–9|pmid=19129527|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2007, the Caudwell Xtreme Everest undertook a medical study of oxygen levels in human blood at extreme altitude. Over 200 volunteers climbed to Everest Base Camp where various medical tests were performed to examine blood oxygen levels. A small team also performed tests on the way to the summit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xtreme-everest.co.uk/news_detail.php?article=196|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080606065437/http://www.xtreme-everest.co.uk/news_detail.php?article=196|archivedate=6 June 2008|title=Everest 2007|publisher=Caudwell Xtreme Everest 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even at base camp, the low [[partial pressure]] of oxygen had direct effect on blood oxygen saturation levels. At sea level, [[Oxygen saturation (medicine)#Oxygen saturation|blood oxygen saturation]] is generally 98–99%. At base camp, blood saturation fell to between 85 and 87%. Blood samples taken at the summit indicated very low oxygen levels in the blood. A side effect of low blood oxygen is a greatly increased breathing rate, often 80–90 breaths per minute as opposed to a more typical 20–30. Exhaustion can occur merely attempting to breathe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.altitude.org/oxygen_levels.php |title=Altitude physiology |publisher=altitude.org |accessdate=6 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lack of oxygen, exhaustion, extreme cold, and climbing hazards all contribute to the death toll. An injured person who cannot walk is in serious trouble, since rescue by helicopter is generally impractical and carrying the person off the mountain is very risky. People who die during the climb are typically left behind. As of 2006, about 150 bodies had never been recovered. It is not uncommon to find corpses near the standard climbing routes.&lt;ref name="theage"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/world/the-deadly-business-of-climbing-everest/2006/06/02/1148956544080.html?page=fullpage#contentSwap2|title=The deadly business of climbing Everest|work=The Age| location=Melbourne|date=3 June 2006|first1=Connie|last1=Levett}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2008 study noted that the "death zone" is indeed where most Everest deaths occur, but also noted that most deaths occur during descent from the summit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.climbing.com/climber/climbing-everest-who-makes-it-to-the-top/|title=CLIMBING EVEREST: WHO MAKES IT TO THE TOP?|website=Climbing|accessdate=20 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2014 article in the magazine The Atlantic about deaths on Everest noted that while falling is one of the greatest dangers the DZ presents for all 8000ers, avalanches are a more common cause of death at lower altitudes.&lt;ref name=atlan&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/04/mortality-on-mount-everest/360927/|title=Charting Deaths on Mount Everest|author=Svati Kirsten Narula|website=The Atlantic|accessdate=20 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, Everest climbing is more deadly than [[BASE jumping]], although some have combined extreme sports and Everest including a Russian who base-jumped off Everest in a [[Wingsuit flying|wingsuit]] (he did survive, though).&lt;ref name=extreme&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.therichest.com/expensive-lifestyle/entertainment/the-top-ten-most-extreme-sports-in-the-world/|title=The Top Ten Most Extreme Sports in the World|website=TheRichest|accessdate=20 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Everest Base Jumper"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redbull.com/us/en/adventure/stories/1331647282718/watch-a-record-setting-base-jump-from-mt-everest|title=Everest Base Jumper|publisher=Red Bull}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite this, Everest is safer for climbers than a number of peaks by some measurements, but it depends on the period.&lt;ref name=safer&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/30757/5-mountains-deadlier-everest |title=5 Mountains Deadlier Than Everest |website=Mental Floss |accessdate=20 September 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923175946/http://mentalfloss.com/article/30757/5-mountains-deadlier-everest |archivedate=23 September 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some examples are [[Kangchenjunga]], [[K2]], [[Annapurna Massif|Annapurna]], [[Nanga Parbat]], and the [[Eiger]] (especially the ''&lt;abbr title="north wall"&gt;nordwand&lt;/abbr&gt;'').&lt;ref name=safer/&gt; [[Mont Blanc]] has more deaths each year than Everest, with over one hundred dying in a typical year and over eight thousand killed since records were kept.&lt;ref name=killermountains&gt;{{cite web|url=https://uk.news.yahoo.com/everest-anniversary--world-s-five-deadliest-mountain-ranges-siula-grande-k2-mont-blanc-annapunna-155951170.html#9eTWTzo|title=Everest anniversary: World's five deadliest mountains|date=28 May 2013|website=Yahoo News UK|accessdate=20 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some factors that affect total mountain lethality include the level of popularity of the mountain, the skill of those climbing, and the difficulty of the climb.&lt;ref name=killermountains/&gt;

Another health hazard is [[retinal haemorrhage]]s, which can damage eyesight and cause blindness.&lt;ref name=eyes&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/everest-team-forced-to-leave-sick-british-climber-to-die-1988979.html|title=Everest team forced to leave sick British climber to die|work=The Independent|accessdate=20 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Up to a quarter of Everest climbers can experience retinal haemorrhages, and although they usually heal within weeks of returning to lower altitudes, in 2010 a climber went blind and ended up dying in the death zone.&lt;ref name=eyes/&gt;

Humans do not think clearly with low oxygen, and the combination of extreme weather, low temperatures, and steep slopes often requires quick, accurate decisions. While about 95 percent of climbers who reach the summit use [[bottled oxygen]] in order to reach the top, about five percent of climbers have summited Everest without supplemental oxygen. The death rate is double for those who attempt to reach the summit without supplemental oxygen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title =Field Test on Everest: To Os or not to Os| work=National Geographic| date =18 May 2012| url =http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/everest/blog/2012-05-18/to-os-or-not-to-os| accessdate = 11 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Travelling above 8,000 feet altitude is a factor in [[cerebral hypoxia]].&lt;ref name=hypo&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.healthline.com/health/cerebral-hypoxia#Causes2|title=Brain Hypoxia|date=25 July 2012|website=Healthline|accessdate=20 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This decrease of oxygen to the brain can cause dementia and brain damage, as well as other symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dementia.org/oxygen-deprivation-dementia|title=Dementia From Oxygen Deprivation|website=Dementia.org|accessdate=20 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; One study found that Mount Everest may be the highest an acclimatised human could go, but also found that climbers may suffer permanent neurological damage despite returning to lower altitudes.&lt;ref name=thom/&gt;

The use of bottled oxygen to ascend Mount Everest has been controversial. It was first used on the [[1922 British Mount Everest Expedition]] by [[George Finch (chemist)|George Finch]] and [[Geoffrey Bruce (mountaineer)|Geoffrey Bruce]] who climbed up to {{convert|7800|m|ft|abbr=on}} at a spectacular speed of 1,000 vertical feet per hour (vf/h). Pinned down by a fierce storm, they escaped death by breathing oxygen from a jury-rigged set-up during the night. The next day they climbed to {{convert|8100|m|ft|abbr=on}} at 900 vf/h—nearly three times as fast as non-oxygen users. Yet the use of oxygen was considered so unsportsmanlike that none of the rest of the Alpine world recognised this high ascent rate.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} 

[[George Mallory]] described the use of such oxygen as unsportsmanlike, but he later concluded that it would be impossible for him to summit without it and consequently used it on his final attempt in 1924.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Tom Holzel|author2=Audrey Salkeld|title=The Mystery of Mallory &amp; Irvine|year=1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Tenzing Norgay|Tenzing]] and Hillary made the first successful summit in 1953, they used bottled oxygen, with the expedition's physiologist [[Griffith Pugh]] referring to the oxygen debate as a "futile controversy", noting that oxygen "greatly increases subjective appreciation of the surroundings, which after all is one of the chief reasons for climbing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Ascent of Everest|first=John|last=Hunt|publisher=Hodder &amp; Stoughton|year=1953|chapter=Appendix VII}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the next twenty-five years, bottled oxygen was considered standard for any successful summit.

[[Reinhold Messner]] was the first climber to break the bottled oxygen tradition and in 1978, with [[Peter Habeler]], made the first successful climb without it. In 1980, Messner summited the mountain solo, without supplemental oxygen or any porters or climbing partners, on the more difficult northwest route. Once the climbing community was satisfied that the mountain could be climbed without supplemental oxygen, many purists then took the next logical step of insisting that is how it ''should'' be climbed.&lt;ref name=Krakauer-1997&gt;{{cite book|last1=Krakauer|first1=Jon|title=Into Thin Air: A Personal Account of the Mt. Everest Disaster|date=1997|publisher=Villard|location=New York|isbn=978-0-679-45752-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{RP|154}}

The aftermath of the [[1996 Mount Everest disaster|1996 disaster]] further intensified the debate. [[Jon Krakauer]]'s ''[[Into Thin Air]]'' (1997) expressed the author's personal criticisms of the use of bottled oxygen. Krakauer wrote that the use of bottled oxygen allowed otherwise unqualified climbers to attempt to summit, leading to dangerous situations and more deaths. The disaster was partially caused by the sheer number of climbers (34 on that day) attempting to ascend, causing bottlenecks at the Hillary Step and delaying many climbers, most of whom summitted after the usual 14:00 turnaround time. He proposed banning bottled oxygen except for emergency cases, arguing that this would both decrease the growing pollution on Everest—many bottles have accumulated on its slopes—and keep marginally qualified climbers off the mountain.

The 1996 disaster also introduced the issue of the guide's role in using bottled oxygen.&lt;ref name="salon"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.salon.com/wlust/feature/1998/08/07featurea.html|title=Everest controversy continues| website=Salon|date=7 August 1998|accessdate=17 June 2016|author=DeWalt, Weston|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514043017/http://www.salon.com/wlust/feature/1998/08/07featurea.html | archive-date=14 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Guide [[Anatoli Boukreev]]'s decision not to use bottled oxygen was sharply criticised by Jon Krakauer. Boukreev's supporters (who include G. Weston DeWalt, who co-wrote ''[[The Climb (book)|The Climb]]'') state that using bottled oxygen gives a false sense of security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.boukreev.org/The%20Oxygen%20Illusion.htm |title=The Oxygen Illusion|publisher=The Anatoli Boukreev Memorial Fund|accessdate=24 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Krakauer and his supporters point out that, without bottled oxygen, Boukreev could not directly help his clients descend.&lt;ref name="salongarner"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.salon.com/wlust/feature/1998/08/cov_03feature3.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000303032319/http://www.salon.com/wlust/feature/1998/08/cov_03feature3.html|archivedate=3 March 2000|title=Coming Down|page=3|first=Dwight|last=Garner|work=Salon|date=August 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; They state that Boukreev said that he was going down with client Martin Adams,&lt;ref name="salongarner"/&gt; but just below the south summit, Boukreev determined that Adams was doing fine on the descent and so descended at a faster pace, leaving Adams behind. Adams states in ''The Climb'', "For me, it was business as usual, Anatoli's going by, and I had no problems with that."&lt;ref name=The_Climb&gt;{{cite book|title=The Climb|last1=Boukreev|first1=Anatoli| last2=DeWalt|first2=Weston|publisher=St. Martins Paperbacks|isbn=978-0-312-96533-4|page=182|year=1998|title-link=The Climb (book)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The low oxygen can cause a mental fog-like impairment of cognitive abilities described as "delayed and lethargic thought process, clinically defined as bradypsychia" even after returning to lower altitudes.&lt;ref name=altitude&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boulderweekly.com/article-8924-this-is-your-brain-this-is-your-brain-at-altitude.html|title=This is your brain.

In 2014, a team financed and led by mountaineer [[Wang Jing (mountaineer)|Wang Jing]] used a helicopter to fly from South base camp to Camp 2 to avoid the Khumbu Icefall, and thence climbed to the Everest summit.&lt;ref name="nationalgeographic2"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brown|first1=Chip|title=Chinese Woman Becomes First to Summit Everest After Avalanche|url=https://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2014/05/140525-everest-nepal-sherpas-climber-climbing-chinese-summit-avalanche-namche/|website=National Geographic|publisher=National Geographic Society|accessdate=16 December 2017|language=en|date=25 May 2014|quote=Next year I think maybe I will relax.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This climb immediately sparked outrage and controversy in much of the mountaineering world over the legitimacy and propriety of her climb.&lt;ref name="news.nationalgeographic.com" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gornyack"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Yelkov|first1=Alexander|title=Ван Цзин – миллионерша, красавица, мама и скандальная рекордсменка мира (Wang Jing - millionaire, beauty, mother and scandalous world record holder)|url=http://xn--80afvlem1dxc.xn--p1ai/articles/all/article_8058/|website=ГорнЯшкА.рф|publisher=Gornyack.com|accessdate=18 December 2017|language=ru|date=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nepal ended up investigating [[#Jing Wang|Wang]], who initially denied the claim that she had flown to Camp 2, admitting only that some support crew were flown to that higher camp, over the Khumbu Icefall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sharma |first=Gopal |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-nepal-china-everest-idUSKBN0E70UO20140527 |title=Nepal probes if Chinese woman used helicopter on Everest climb |website=Reuters |publisher=Reuters |date=27 May 2014 |accessdate=17 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2014, however, she stated that she had flown to Camp 2 because the icefall was impassable. "If you don't fly to Camp II, you just go home," she said in an interview. In that same interview she also insisted that she had never tried to hide this fact.&lt;ref name="news.nationalgeographic.com" /&gt; 

Her team had had to use the south side because the Chinese had denied them a permit to climb. Ultimately, the Chinese refusal may have been beneficial to Nepalese interests, allowing the government to showcase improved local hospitals and provided the opportunity for a new hybrid aviation/mountaineering style, triggering discussions about helicopter use in the mountaineering world.&lt;ref name="news.nationalgeographic.com"/&gt; National Geographic noted that a village festooned Wang with honours after she donated 30,000 USD to the town's hospital. Wang won the [[International Mountaineer of the Year Award]] from the Nepal government in June 2014.&lt;ref name="nationalgeographic2"/&gt;

===2016: Helicopter business increases===
In 2016 the increased use of helicopters was noted for increased efficiency and for hauling material over the deadly Khumbu icefall.&lt;ref name="blogs.dw.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.dw.com/adventuresports/2016/04/23/helicopter-transport-flights-to-everest-high-camps/ |title=Helicopter transport flights to Everest high camps - Mount Everest - Adventure Sports - DW.COM |publisher=Blogs.dw.com |date=25 April 2015 |accessdate=17 June 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160902225132/http://blogs.dw.com/adventuresports/2016/04/23/helicopter-transport-flights-to-everest-high-camps/ |archivedate=2 September 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular it was noted that flights saved icefall porters 80 trips but still increased commercial activity at Everest.&lt;ref name="blogs.dw.com"/&gt; After many Nepalis died in the icefall in 2014, the government had wanted helicopters to handle more transportation to Camp 1 but this was not possible because of the 2015 deaths and earthquake closing the mountain, so this was then implemented in 2016 (helicopters did prove instrumental in rescuing many people in 2015 though).&lt;ref name="blogs.dw.com"/&gt; That summer Bell tested the [[Bell 412#Variants|412EPI]], which conducted a series of tests including hovering at 18,000 feet and flying as high as 20,000 feet altitude near Mount Everest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bergqvist |first=Pia |url=http://www.flyingmag.com/bell-helicopter-tests-412epi-near-mount-everest |title=Bell Helicopter Tests 412EPI Near Mount Everest &amp;#124; Flying Magazine |publisher=Flyingmag.com |date= |accessdate=17 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Financial cost of guided climbs==
Going with a "celebrity guide", usually a well-known mountaineer typically with decades of climbing experience and perhaps several Everest summits, can cost over £100,000 as of 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/active/11794351/Kenton-Cool-my-journey-from-a-wheelchair-to-the-peak-of-Mount-Everest.html|title=Kenton Cool: my journey from a wheelchair to the peak of Mount Everest|date=11 August 2015|website=The Telegraph|accessdate=20 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, a limited support service, offering only some meals at base camp and bureaucratic overhead like a permit, can cost as little as US$7,000 as of 2007.&lt;ref name=thefever/&gt; There are issues with the management of guiding firms in Nepal, and one Canadian woman was left begging for help when her guide firm, which she had paid perhaps US$40,000 to, couldn't stop her from dying in 2012. She ran out of bottled oxygen after climbing for 27 hours straight. Despite decades of concern over inexperienced climbers, neither she nor the guide firm had summited Everest before. The Tibetan/Chinese side has been described as "out of control" due to reports of thefts and threats.&lt;ref name=stolen/&gt; By 2015, Nepal was considering requiring that climbers have some experience and wanted to make the mountain safer, and especially increase revenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jason Burke |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/28/mount-everest-to-be-declared-off-limits-to-inexperienced-climbers |title=Mount Everest to be declared off-limits to inexperienced climbers, says Nepal |website=The Guardian |date= |accessdate=17 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; One barrier to this is that low-budget firms make money ''not'' taking inexperienced climbers to the summit.&lt;ref name="heraldsun.com.au"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/mt-everest-summit-fever-why-climbers-make-poor-decisions-near-peak/news-story/3502b64dc81a65fec0466bf1983efff5 |title=Mt Everest 'summit fever': Why climbers make poor decisions near peak |website=Herald Sun |date=28 May 2016 |accessdate=17 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Subscription required|date=June 2016}} Those turned away by Western firms can often find another firm willing to take them for a price{{mdash}}that they return home soon after arriving after base camp, or part way up the mountain.&lt;ref name="heraldsun.com.au"/&gt; Whereas a Western firm will convince those they deem incapable to turn back, other firms simply give people the freedom to choose.&lt;ref name="heraldsun.com.au"/&gt;

==Commercial climbing==
[[File:The World’s Tallest Mountain (15473492788).jpg|thumb|Top down view showing the location of the summit, and its three main faces/sides]]
[[File:Kathmandu , Nepal , Himalayas ,Everest 2.jpg|thumb|Everest base camp]]

Climbing Mount Everest can be a relatively expensive undertaking for climbers. Climbing gear required to reach the summit may cost in excess of US$8,000, and most climbers also use bottled oxygen, which adds around US$3,000. The permit to enter the Everest area from the south via Nepal costs US$10,000 to US$25,000 per person, depending on the size of the team. The ascent typically starts at one of the two base camps near the mountain, both of which are approximately {{convert|100|km|mi|-1}} from [[Kathmandu]] and {{convert|300|km|mi}} from [[Lhasa]] (the two nearest cities with major airports). Transferring one's equipment from the airport to the base camp may add as much as US$2,000.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

By 2016, most guiding services cost between US$35,000–200,000.&lt;ref name="heraldsun.com.au"/&gt; However, the services offered vary widely and it is "buyer beware" when doing deals in Nepal, one of the poorest and least developed countries in the world.&lt;ref name="heraldsun.com.au"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://developingworldconnections.org/destination/nepal/ |title=Nepal |publisher=Developing World Connections |date=25 April 2015 |accessdate=17 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tourism is about four percent of Nepal's economy, but Everest is special in that an Everest porter can make nearly double the nations's average wage in a region in which other sources of income are lacking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Conger |first=Cristen |url=http://adventure.howstuffworks.com/outdoor-activities/climbing/mt-everest-tourism.htm |title=How has Mount Everest tourism affected Nepal? &amp;#124; HowStuffWorks |publisher=Adventure.howstuffworks.com |date=1 April 2008 |accessdate=17 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond this point, costs may vary widely. It is technically possible to reach the summit with minimal additional expenses, and there are "budget" travel agencies which offer logistical support for such trips. However, this is considered difficult and dangerous (as illustrated by the case of [[David Sharp (mountaineer)|David Sharp]]). Many climbers hire "full service" guide companies, which provide a wide spectrum of services, including acquisition of permits, transportation to/from base camp, food, tents, [[fixed ropes]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mounteverest.net/expguide/ropes.htm|title=Fixed ropes}}&lt;/ref&gt; medical assistance while on the mountain, an experienced mountaineer guide, and even personal porters to carry one's backpack and cook one's meals. The cost of such a guide service may range from US$40,000–80,000 per person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://outdoors.whatitcosts.com/mt-everest-pg3.htm|title=What It Costs To Climb Mount Everest}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since most equipment is moved by [[Sherpa people|Sherpas]], clients of full-service guide companies can often keep their backpack weights under {{convert|10|kg}}, or hire a Sherpa to carry their backpack for them. By contrast, climbers attempting less commercialised peaks, like [[Denali]], are often expected to carry backpacks over {{convert|30|kg}} and, occasionally, to tow a [[sled]] with {{convert|35|kg}} of gear and food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alpineinstitute.com/media/79087/denali_phycond.pdf|title=The Physical Demands of Climbing Denali}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Jon Krakauer]], the era of [[commercialization|commercialisation]] of Everest started in 1985, when the summit was reached by a guided expedition led by [[David Breashears]] that included [[Richard Bass]], a wealthy 55-year-old businessman and an amateur mountain climber with only four years of climbing experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1985-05-02/news/mn-20109_1_climbed-mt-everest|title=Conquers Mt. Everest to Fulfill Dream: Millionaire First to Climb Summits of All Continents|journal=Los Angeles Times|first=Bill|last=Stall|date=2 May 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the early-1990s, several companies were offering guided tours to the mountain. [[Rob Hall]], one of the mountaineers who died in the [[1996 Mount Everest disaster|1996 disaster]], had successfully guided 39 clients to the summit before that incident.&lt;ref name=Krakauer-1997/&gt;{{RP|24,42}}

The degree of commercialisation of Mount Everest is a frequent subject of criticism.&lt;ref name="NG-20130600"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jenkins|first1=Mark|title=Maxed Out on Everest|url=http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2013/06/125-everest-maxed-out/jenkins-text|accessdate=31 January 2017|work=National Geographic|date=June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jamling Tenzing Norgay]], the son of [[Tenzing Norgay]], said in a 2003 interview that his late father would have been shocked to discover that rich thrill-seekers with no climbing experience were now routinely reaching the summit, "You still have to climb this mountain yourself with your feet. But the spirit of adventure is not there any more. It is lost. There are people going up there who have no idea how to put on [[crampons]]. They are climbing because they have paid someone $65,000. It is very selfish. It endangers the lives of others."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/guardianweekly/story/0,12674,961195,00.html|title=Everest's decline blamed on trail of rich tourists |work=The Guardian | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Reinhold Messner]] concurred in 2004, "You could die in each climb and that meant you were responsible for yourself. We were real mountaineers: careful, aware and even afraid. By climbing mountains we were not learning how big we were. We were finding out how breakable, how weak and how full of fear we are. You can only get this if you expose yourself to high danger. I have always said that a mountain without danger is not a mountain....High altitude alpinism has become tourism and show. These commercial trips to Everest, they are still dangerous. But the guides and organisers tell clients, "Don't worry, it's all organised." The route is prepared by hundreds of Sherpas. Extra oxygen is available in all camps, right up to the summit. People will cook for you and lay out your beds. Clients feel safe and don't care about the risks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/osm/story/0,,1315445,00.html|title=Home on the range |work=The Guardian | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, not all opinions on the subject among prominent mountaineers are strictly negative. For example, [[Edmund Hillary]], who went on record saying that he has not liked "the commercialization of mountaineering, particularly of Mt. Everest"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.askmen.com/celebs/interview_400/455b_sir-edmund-hillary-the-right-stuff.html|title=Sir Edmund Hillary: The Right Stuff}}&lt;/ref&gt; and claimed that "Having people pay $65,000 and then be led up the mountain by a couple of experienced guides...isn't really mountaineering at all",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/2938596.stm|title=Hillary laments Everest changes |work=BBC News | date=26 May 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; nevertheless noted that he was pleased by the changes brought to Everest area by Westerners, "I don't have any regrets because I worked very hard indeed to improve the condition for the local people. When we first went in there they didn't have any schools, they didn't have any medical facilities, all over the years we have established 27 schools, we have two hospitals and a dozen medical clinics and then we've built bridges over wild mountain rivers and put in fresh water pipelines so in cooperation with the Sherpas we've done a lot to benefit them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.abc.net.au/foreign/stories/s843061.htm| title=Interview with Sir Edmund Hillary|website=Foreign Correspondent|publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]]|date=29 April 2003|accessdate=26 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the early guided summiters, Richard Bass (of [[Seven Summits]] fame) responded in an interview about Everest climbers and what it took to survive there, "Climbers should have high altitude experience before they attempt the really big mountains. People don't realise the difference between a 20,000-foot mountain and 29,000 feet. It's not just arithmetic. The reduction of oxygen in the air is proportionate to the altitude alright, but the effect on the human body is disproportionate—an exponential curve. People climb Denali [20,320 feet] or Aconcagua [22,834 feet] and think, 'Heck, I feel great up here, I’m going to try Everest.' But it's not like that."&lt;ref name=bass&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/2003/11/12/cz_jc_1112sport.html|title=The Adventurer: Dick Bass' Many Summits|author=James Clash|date=12 November 2003|website=Forbes|accessdate=20 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Law and order===
Some climbers have reported life-threatening thefts from supply caches. [[Vitor Negrete]], the first Brazilian to climb Everest without oxygen and part of David Sharp's party, died during his descent, and theft from his high-altitude camp may have contributed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Everest fatality silence mystery solved: British David Sharp left to die by 40 climbers|url=http://www.explorersweb.com/everest_k2/news.php?id=2092|publisher=Explorersweb}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brazilian Vitor Negrete lost on Everest after a no O2 summit|url=http://www.explorersweb.com/everest_k2/news.php?id=2069|publisher=Explorersweb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Several members were bullied, gear was stolen, and threats were made against me and my climbing partner, Michael Kodas, making an already stressful situation even more dire." said one climber.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://views.washingtonpost.com/leadership/guestinsights/2010/04/everest-climb.html|title=Guest Insights: A leadership nightmare turned Everest triumph – Anne Parmenter|website=Washington Post|accessdate=20 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to theft, Michael Kodas describes in his book ''High Crimes: The Fate of Everest in an Age of Greed'' (2008),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kodas, Michael|title=High Crimes: The Fate of Everest in an Age of Greed |date=2008|publisher=Hyperion|isbn= 9781401302733 }}&lt;/ref&gt; unethical guides and Sherpas, [[Prostitution in Tibet|prostitution]] and gambling at the Tibet Base Camp, fraud related to the sale of oxygen bottles, and climbers collecting donations under the pretense of removing trash from the mountain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.motherjones.com/arts/books/2008/02/go-sell-it-on-the-mountain.html|title=Go Sell It on the Mountain|website=Mother Jones|date=1 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bristow|first=Michael|title=Everest base camp a 'wild-west town'|work=BBC News|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/6897591.stm|date=13 July 2007|accessdate=31 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chinese side of Everest in Tibet was described as "out of control" after one Canadian had all his gear stolen and was abandoned by his Sherpa.&lt;ref name=stolen&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.explorersweb.com/everest_k2/news.php?id=15994|title=Manny Pizarro robbed and abandoned by Sherpa after summiting Everest – being helped down by DCXP's sirdar|author=Duncan Chessell}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another sherpa helped him get off the mountain safely and gave him some spare gear. Other climbers have also reported missing oxygen bottles, which can be worth hundreds of dollars each. One problem is that hundreds of climbers pass by people's tents. Also weather can damage or even blow people's equipment away.&lt;ref name=stolen/&gt;

In the late 2010s the reports of theft of oxygen bottles from camps became more common.&lt;ref name="nationalgeographic.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalgeographic.com/adventure/features/everest/cory-richards-adrian-ballinger-climbers-mount-everest-unfiltered-expedition-2017/|title=Two Climbers Return to Everest to Snapchat the Summit|date=14 April 2017|website=nationalgeographic.com|accessdate=23 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Westerners have sometimes struggled to understand the ancient culture and desperate poverty that drives some locals, some with a different concept of the value of a human life.&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/nepal/11170488/Nepal-trekkers-kicked-out-of-lodge-during-snow-storm-blame-local-greed-for-eight-deaths.html|title=Nepal trekkers 'kicked out of lodge during snow storm' blame local greed for eight deaths|first=Dean|last=Nelson|date=17 October 2014|publisher=|accessdate=23 October 2017|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/16/nepal-blizzard-survivor-deaths-annapurna-refuge|title=Nepal blizzard: survivor tells of friends' deaths on Annapurna circuit|first=Jason|last=Burke|date=16 October 2014|publisher=|accessdate=23 October 2017|via=www.theguardian.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, for just 1,000 rupees (£6.30) per person several foreigners were forced to leave the lodge where they were staying and tricked into believing they were being led to safety.

==2014 Sherpa strike==
On 18 April 2014, in one of the worst disasters to ever hit the Everest climbing community up to that time, 16 Sherpas died in Nepal due to the [[2014 Mount Everest avalanche|avalanche that swept them off Mount Everest]]. In response to the tragedy numerous Sherpa climbing guides walked off the job and most climbing companies pulled out in respect for the Sherpa people mourning the loss.&lt;ref name=npr&gt;{{cite news |work=NPR|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2014/04/24/306390312/injured-sherpa-explains-why-hell-never-climb-mount-everest-again|title=Sherpas Walk Off The Job After Deadly Avalanche |author=McCarthy, Julie |date=24 April 2014|accessdate=26 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sherpas Consider Boycott After Everest Disaster|agency=Associated Press|work=NPR|date=21 April 2014|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=305178526|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140421083304/http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=305178526|archivedate=21 April 2014|accessdate=26 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some still wanted to climb but there was really too much controversy to continue that year.&lt;ref name=npr/&gt; One of the issues that triggered the work action by Sherpas was unreasonable client demands during climbs.&lt;ref name=npr/&gt;

==Extreme sports at Mount Everest==
[[File:Img20040730 0302 at neustift.jpg|thumb|A paraglider at Neustift, Tirol, Austria]]

Mount Everest has been host to other winter sports and adventuring besides mountaineering, including snowboarding, skiing, paragliding, and BASE jumping.

[[Yuichiro Miura]] became the first man to ski down Everest in the 1970s.

==Everest and religion==
[[File:Rongbuk Monastery Everest.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Rongphu Monastery]], with Mt. Everest in the background]]
The southern part of Mt. Everest is regarded as one of several "hidden valleys" of refuge designated by [[Padmasambhava]], a ninth-century "[[Lotus birth|lotus-born]]" Buddhist saint.&lt;ref name="natgeo1"/&gt;

Near the base of the north side of Everest lies [[Rongbuk Monastery]], which has been called the "sacred threshold to Mount Everest, with the most dramatic views of the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Gilbert |first=Jeanne-Marie |title=Rongbuk Monastery |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/everest/history/rongbukmon.html |website=[[PBS]] |access-date=14 September 2013 |date=November 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; For [[Sherpa people|Sherpas]] living on the slopes of Everest in the [[Khumbu]] region of Nepal, Rongbuk Monastery is an important pilgrimage site, accessed in a few days of travel across the Himalayas through [[Nangpa La]].&lt;ref name="Ullman"&gt;{{cite book |first=Tenzing |last=Norgay |first2=James |last2=Ramsey Ullman |author-link1=Tenzing Norgay |author-link2=James Ramsey Ullman |title=Man of Everest: The Autobiography of Tenzing |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iJR6nQEACAAJ |year=1955 |publisher=[[G. G. Harrap]] |others=also published as ''Tiger of the Snows'' |pages=320}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Miyolangsangma]], a [[Tibet]]an [[Buddhist]] "''Goddess of Inexhaustible Giving''", is believed to have lived at the top of Mt Everest. According to Sherpa Buddhist monks, Mt Everest is Miyolangsangma's palace and playground, and all climbers are only partially welcome guests, having arrived without invitation.&lt;ref name="natgeo1"/&gt;

The [[Sherpa people]] also believe that Mt. Everest and its flanks are blessed with spiritual energy, and one should show reverence when passing through this sacred landscape. Here, the [[karma|karmic]] effects of one's actions are magnified, and impure thoughts are best avoided.&lt;ref name="natgeo1"&gt;{{cite news |last=Coburn |first=Broughton |title=Mount Everest Fight Raises Questions About Sherpas |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2013/13/130501-mount-everest-fight-sherpas-sahibs-world-mountain-climbing/ |work=[[National Geographic News]] |access-date=14 September 2013 |publisher=[[National Geographic Society]] |agency=[[National Geographic Partners, LLC.]] |date=1 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Waste management==
In 2015 the president of the Nepal Mountaineering Association warned that pollution, especially human waste, has reached critical levels. As much as "26,500 pounds of human excrement" each season is left behind on the mountain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Holley |first=Peter |title=Morning Mix Decades of human waste have made Mount Everest a 'fecal time bomb' |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/03/03/decades-of-human-waste-have-made-mount-everest-a-fecal-time-bomb/ |access-date=31 January 2017 |newspaper=[[Washington Post]] |date=3 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Human waste is strewn across the verges of the route to the summit, making the four sleeping areas on the route up Everest's south side minefields of human excrement. Climbers above Base Camp—for the 62-year history of climbing on the mountain—have most commonly either buried their excrement in holes they dug by hand in the snow, or slung it into crevasses, or simply defecated wherever convenient, often within meters of their tents. The only place where climbers can defecate without worrying about contaminating the mountain is Base Camp. At approximately 18,000 feet, Base Camp sees the most activity of all camps on Everest because climbers acclimate and rest there. In the late-1990s, expeditions began using toilets that they fashioned from blue plastic 50-gallon barrels fitted with a toilet seat and enclosed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Bishop |first=Brent |title=Peak Poop: The Feces Problem on Everest Needs a Solution |url=https://www.outsideonline.com/1965696/peak-poop-feces-problem-everest-needs-solution |access-date=31 January 2017 |magazine=[[Outside Online]] |date=7 April 2015 |publisher=Mariah Media Network LLC.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The problem of human waste is compounded by the presence of more anodyne waste: spent oxygen tanks, abandoned tents, empty cans and bottles. The Nepalese government now requires each climber to pack out eight kilograms of waste when descending the mountain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Saul |first=Heather |title=Human waste left by climbers on Mount Everest is causing pollution and could spread diseases |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/human-waste-left-by-climbers-on-mount-everest-is-causing-pollution-and-could-spread-diseases-10081562.html |access-date=31 January 2017 |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |date=3 March 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171222105040/http://www.independent.co.uk/environment/human-waste-left-by-climbers-on-mount-everest-is-causing-pollution-and-could-spread-diseases-10081562.html |archive-date=22 December 2017 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Context and maps==
Nearby peaks include [[Lhotse]], {{convert|8516|m|ft|abbr=on}}; [[Nuptse]], {{convert|7855|m|ft|abbr=on}}, and [[Changtse]], {{convert|7580|m|ft|abbr=on}} among others. Another nearby peak is [[Khumbutse]], and many of the highest mountains in the world are near Mount Everest. On the southwest side, a major feature in the lower areas is the Khumbu icefall and glacier, a famous obstacle to climbers on those routes but also to the base camps.

[[File:Carte réduite de lisle de Cube (7537862886) - Parcel.jpg|thumb|The ''[[Placer de los Roques]]'' marked as ''Pracel'' in a 1762 French map.]]
'''Placer''' ({{lang-pt|parcel}} or ''pracel'') is a term used by [[Spanish discoveries|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese discoveries|Portuguese]] navigators and cartographers to refer to a certain kind of [[submerged bank]] or [[reef]]. Commonly the bottom of such a reef is [[sand]]y, but there are some where the bottom is [[mud]]dy or [[stone]]y. Although most reefs designated as placer are flat and shallow, exceptionally there are some that do not share those characteristics and are known as ''placer acantilado''. A placer usually provides an [[Anchorage (shipping)|anchorage]] for seagoing vessels.&lt;ref name="dme"&gt;[https://books.google.es/books?pg=PA425&amp;dq=diccionario&amp;id=0HUDAAAAYAAJ&amp;hl=es#v=onepage&amp;q=diccionario&amp;f=false Martín Fernández de Navarrete, ''Diccionario marítimo español'', 1831]&lt;/ref&gt;
==Etymology==
Spanish navigator and explorer [[Pedro Sarmiento de Gamboa]] commented that ''placer'' likely originated as a term derived from [[placer mining]] in the [[Antilles]], where [[pearl fishing]] was done mostly on shallow sandy reefs, which were compared to the sandy grounds in rivers where gold nuggets were found.&lt;ref name="dme"/&gt; 

Since the word ''Placer'' in Spanish means 'pleasure', according to 16th century scientist [[Juan Pérez de Moya]] a placer is every dangerous submerged shallow bank. Moya claims that the landforms that received this denomination did so in an ironical manner, for it would be everything but a pleasure to navigate those treacherous waters under the constant risk of running aground.
However, other navigators contradict Moya by claiming that such a shallow ground would provide mariners with a much welcome anchorage after a long open sea journey, for in some ''placeres'' the waters are not as rough as in the open seas.&lt;ref name="dme"/&gt;

==Use of the term==
The term appears in Spanish [[nautical chart]]s as ''placer'', although Pedro Sarmiento de Gamboa writes it as ''placel''.
The [[Portuguese language]] equivalent and derived term is ''pracel'' or ''parcel''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dicio.com.br/parcel/ Dicio = Significado de Parcel]&lt;/ref&gt; In present times some of the geographical names used by the Spanish cartographers, such as ''Placer de los Colorados,'' ''Placer de los Estudios,'' ''Placer de Playa Grande,'' ''Placer de Montechristi,'' ''Placer de Quatro Cayos'', ''Placer de la Gallega'', ''Placer de las Tortugas'' and ''Placer de los Siete Hermanos'' have become obsolete or have been superseded by English terms. Still, many other ''placeres'' mentioned in 19th-century Spanish Navigation Instruction Manuals were not even named.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/derroterodelasi00spaigoog/derroterodelasi00spaigoog_djvu.txt Derrotero de las Islas Antillas, de las costas de tierra firme y de las del Seno Mexicano]&lt;/ref&gt; Not all ''placeres'' are in the open sea; the ''Isla Cangrejos'' in the [[Orinoco Delta]] was described as having a ''placer'' that stretched from its NE point composed of ground-coffee coloured hard sand.&lt;ref name="ReferenceO"&gt;[https://books.google.co.th/books?id=irQBAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA50&amp;lpg=PA50&amp;dq=%22isla+cangrejos%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=8AkJgq7gIQ&amp;sig=vtsiCSllK46Hqp4VZB23pc4Xu8A&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwimqfToiqbLAhXNHY4KHQsyB_wQ6AEIRTAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22isla%20cangrejos%22&amp;f=false ''Derrotero de las islas Antillas, de las costas de Tierra Firme y de las del Seno Mexicano'' p. 50]&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Paracel Islands]]. [[Portuguese discoveries|Portuguese]] navigators whose vessels frequented the [[South China Sea]] as early as at the beginning of the 16th century, were the first to refer to the Paracel Islands as ''Ilhas do Pracel''. [[French colonial empire|French explorers]] and cartographers used the Portuguese terms ''Pracel'' or ''Parcel''. In the "Map of the coast of Tonquin and Cochinchina", made in 1747 by Pierre d'Hondt, the dangerous cluster of reefs of the ''Ilhas do Pracel'' was labeled ''"Le Paracel"''.&lt;ref name="NDV"&gt;Nguyễn Đại Việt, ''Paracel and Spratly Islands on Charts and Maps made by Westerners'', [http://www.nguyenthaihocfoundation.org/lichsuVN/haidotayphuong.htm Hoàng Sa và Trường Sa trên Bản đồ Tây Phương], 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The defiance campaign was launched here in 1952, this was the first mass anti-apartheid campaign led by Nelson Mandela as volunteer-in chief of the [[African National Congress]].Completed in 1976, the Plaza was built to accommodate Indian traders evicted by the apartheid government from the main trading street, 14th Street as well as other streets including the eastern and western boundary street, Delarey and Krause streets of Pageview, [[Fietas]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.orientalplaza.co.za/Tourist-Info.php?pid=88&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Red Square or Freedom Square was an open community square in [[Fordsburg]].  During the 1940s and 1950s it was a political meeting place particularly popular with the Communist Party and the site for numerous defiance campaigns and gatherings. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.southafrica.net/za/en/articles/entry/article-southafrica.net-fordsburg&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1952, leaders of the African National Congress sent an ultimatum to the apartheid government to repeal all unjust laws.  The Defiance Campaign was launched when the government failed to comply. 

On 6 April 1952, the 300 year anniversary after Jan van Riebeeck and the first European settlers arrived at the Cape, thousands marched to and gathered at Red Square from various locations and outlying towns.  The Defiance Campaign was launched at the square by [[James Moroka]], president of the ANC and Yusuf Dadoo, head of the South African Indian Congress, together with many other African, Indian and Coloured leaders.  They protested against the unjust and oppressive laws and called for volunteers to defy them.  This culminated in groups of defiers who protested non-violently and offered themselves for arrest.  

Volunteers included Nelson Mandela, Yusuf Dadoo, Walter Sisulu, Ahmed Kathrada and many more who all defied apartheid laws in [[Johannesburg]] and other main city centres.  Mandela, working with Maulvi Cachalia also actively worked to mobilise volunteers for the campaign.  This marked the beginning of non-racial co-operation in the resistance against apartheid and led to the drafting and adoption of the Freedom Charter in 1955.

Forced removals were enforced in the nearby suburb of Pageview, destroying the existing vibrant commercial 14th Street and other streets.  The Oriental Plaza was built as a compromise between the Johannesburg City Council and the Department of Community Development in the 1970s, in an attempt to reluctantly address the loss of the evicted Indian traders.  In the process a substantial part of Fordsburg’s urban fabric including the Red Square was demolished.  The Red Square still however holds social, cultural and historical significance.

The '''Regional Plan Association''' of the United States is an independent, not-for-profit regional planning organization, founded in 1922, that focuses on recommendations to improve the quality of life and economic competitiveness of a 31-county [[New York (state)|New York]]–[[New Jersey]]–[[Connecticut]] region in the [[New York metropolitan area]].{{sfn |Danielson|Doig|1982| pp=35–37}} Headquartered in [[New York City]], it has offices in [[Princeton, New Jersey]], and [[Stamford, Connecticut]].&lt;ref name="Contact - Regional Plan Association"&gt;{{cite web|title=Contact - Regional Plan Association|url=http://www.rpa.org/about/contact-us|publisher=Regional Plan Association|accessdate=7 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Regional plans ==

RPA has produced four strategic regional plans for the New York metropolitan region since the 1920s. The chronology of their plans is as follows:
# The First Plan in 1929, developed under the leadership of [[Thomas Adams (architect)|Thomas Adams]], provided a guide for the area's road and transportation network.{{sfn |Fishman|2000| pp=65–88}}
# The Second Plan, published as a series of reports in the 1960s, aimed at restructuring mass transit and reinvigorating deteriorating urban centers.
# The Third Plan in 1996, "A Region at Risk," recommended improving regional mass transit, increasing protection of open space and maintaining employment in traditional urban centers.
# The Fourth Plan in 2017 suggested improving the area's transportation network, making more affordable housing, implementing measures to fight climate change, and restructure the area's public institutions.&lt;ref name="Fourth Regional Plan - Regional Plan Association"&gt;{{cite web|title=Fourth Regional Plan - Regional Plan Association|url=http://fourthplan.org/|publisher=Regional Plan Association|accessdate=30 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Planning philosophy ==

The RPA program represents a philosophy of planning described by historian Robert Fishman as "metropolitanism," associated with the [[Chicago School of Sociology]]. It promotes large scale, industrial centers and the concentration of population rather than decentralized development. Its critics point out that this results in windfall real estate profits for downtown interests. Whether this approach to regional planning is efficient, particularly because of the infrastructure and energy required to sustain such concentration, has been questioned by scholars including James Howard Kunstler.{{sfn |Fishman|2000| pp=65–88}}

== Impact in the Tri-state area ==
Regional Plan Association's strategic plans have proposed numerous ideas and investments for the New York metropolitan area that have turned into major public works, economic development and open space projects, including:
*  The location of the [[George Washington Bridge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=For Hudson Bridge Above 125th Street|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9F03E2D81439E033A2575BC2A9649D946295D6CF|accessdate=7 October 2014|publisher=The New York Times|date=December 28, 1923}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Agricultural Information and Documentation Service of the Americas''' (SIDALC) is an international agricultural, livestock, forestry and environmental information service in which institutions in 23 countries of the Americas share information and services on line. Created in 1999, today it is one of the most important sources of knowledge and information in LAC{what is that?}.

It provides access to information generated throughout the hemisphere and stored in libraries and other related information centers. It contains some two million reference materials including books, magazines and journals, graduate theses, reports, audiovisual materials, maps and photographs.

At present, the SIDALC [[information system]] is open to the public at www.sidalc.net (no subscription required), which also permits on-line searches of available digital collections, including full texts, audiovisual materials, photographs, etc. Furthermore, SIDALC is linked to other [[information systems]] in a number of countries of the Americas, which provide stakeholders in agriculture and rural territories with access to relevant information and knowledge.

SIDALC's provides access to the [[intellectual capital]] of at least 166 national institutions. It is the result of earlier initiatives aimed at management of knowledge and information, all promoted by IICA, such as the Orton Commemorative Library (founded in 1943); the Scientific Exchange Service (SIC), created in 1958; the Inter-American Association of Agricultural Librarians, Documentalists and Information Specialists (AIBDA), founded in 1965; and the Inter-American Agricultural Information System (AGRINTER), created in 1972.

==Operation==
SIDALC was created thanks to a grant from the [[W. K. Kellogg Foundation|Kellogg Foundation]], to the technical leadership assumed by IICA and CATIE and to the participation of a number of national, regional and international organizations.

SIDALC is a community of agricultural, forestry and other information specialists located in different institutions of the Americas interested in providing services openly. They collaborate with one another, “sharing a little so that all can have more,” while conserving their identity and their policies on providing specialized services at no cost or for a fee.

That is greatest competitive advantage of SIDALC. With a hemispheric system to which more than 20 national information systems are linked it is possible to provide access to specialized knowledge on agriculture and rural life in the Americas and to share it with the world.

Also, through SIDALC, it is possible to mobilize human and information resources among countries and regions, promoting and supporting national information management initiatives, facilitating the flow of information and promoting the dissemination and transfer of successful experiences.

==Benefits==

– Participation in the largest hemispheric information system specializing in agriculture and rural life in the Americas
– Linkage to international information system, essential for accrediting the quality of institutional services, such as university majors
– Recognition, nationally and internationally, of the networks and libraries and other related information centers
– Increase in the demand for services on the part of users, and the positive impact on the reference services of specialized libraries
– Access to a larger collection of specialized information on agriculture, the environment, forestry and related areas; the AGRI2000 mega base
– [[Open access (publishing)|Open access]] to tools and methodologies for the management of specialized information
– Exchanges of experiences with specialists and institutions, which helps identify opportunities and find solutions to specific problems
– International backing of institutional catalogues
– Greater visibility, at the international level, of institutional collections through SIDALC.NET and Google.com, without the institute losing its identity.

==Products of SIDALC==

– A "community of practice" made up of specialists in information management
– A directory of national networks, libraries and other information centers in Latin America and the Caribbean specializing in agriculture and rural life
– The AGRI2000 mega base, which contains collections specializing in agriculture, environment, forestry and related areas, with references and electronic resources of all types: texts, audiovisual materials, photographs, maps, etc.
– A direct link to the [[United States National Agricultural Library|National Agricultural Library]] of the United States, the Agricultural Library of Canada, the [[Agriculture Network Information Center]] AGNIC in the United States, the [[Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research|CGIAR]] [[virtual library]] and the AGRIS global system promoted by FAO
– Access to different agricultural information systems available via Internet, as well as to resource centers and specialized packages of agricultural and rural information from LAC
– A platform for sharing information management services among countries, and contacting directly the units that provide reference services in the most important specialized libraries of LAC.

== More information ==

See IICA [http://www.iica.int] 
 
The Inter-American Institute for Cooperation on Agriculture (IICA) recognizes that the management of information and knowledge is fundamental for improving agriculture and rural life in the countries of [[United Nations geoscheme for the Americas|Latin America and the Caribbean]] (LAC). Both information and knowledge are essential in decision making, in the fields of education and innovation, and in achieving competitiveness and sustainable development.

The '''tropics''' are a region of the [[Earth]] surrounding the [[Equator]]. They are delimited in [[latitude]] by The [[Tropic of Cancer]] in the [[Northern Hemisphere]] at {{Circle of latitude|Tropical|Convert}}&amp;nbsp;N and the [[Tropic of Capricorn]] in
the [[Southern Hemisphere]] at {{Circle of latitude|Tropical|Convert}}&amp;nbsp;S; these latitudes correspond to the [[axial tilt]] of the Earth. The tropics are also referred to as the '''tropical zone''' and the '''torrid zone''' (see [[geographical zone]]). The tropics include all the areas on the Earth where the [[Sun]] contacts the [[zenith]], a point directly overhead, at least once during the [[solar year]] (which is a [[subsolar point]]).

The tropics are distinguished from the other climatic and biomatic regions of Earth, which are the [[middle latitudes]] and the [[polar regions of Earth|polar regions]] on either side of the equatorial zone.

The tropics comprise 40% of the Earth's surface area&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://godplaysdice.blogspot.co.uk/2007/12/how-much-land-is-in-tropics.html|date=2007-12-04|accessdate=2017-06-26|website=God Plays Dice|title=How much land is in the tropics?}}&lt;/ref&gt; and contain 36% of the Earth's [[landmass]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/tropics/|accessdate=2017-06-26|website=National Geographic Encyclopedia|title=tropics|publisher=National Geographic Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{asof|2014}}, the region is home to 40% of the [[world population]], and this figure is projected to reach 50% by the late 2030s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2014/06/expanding-tropics-will-play-greater-global-role-report-predicts|title=Expanding tropics will play greater global role, report predicts|date=29 June 2014|work=Science Magazine|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Tropical" is sometimes used in a general sense for a [[tropical climate]] to mean warm to hot and moist year-round, often with the sense of lush vegetation. 

Many tropical areas have a dry and wet season.  The [[wet season]], rainy season or green season is the time of year, ranging from one or more months, when most of the average annual [[rainfall]] in a region falls.&lt;ref&gt;Glossary of Meteorology (2009).

Retrieved on 2008-12-27&lt;/ref&gt; typical vegetation in these areas ranges from moist [[seasonal tropical forest]]s to [[savannah]]s.

When the wet season occurs during the warm season, or [[summer]], [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] falls mainly during the late afternoon and early evening hours.  The wet season is a time when [[air quality]] improves, freshwater quality improves and vegetation grows significantly, leading to crop yields late in the season.  Floods cause rivers to overflow their banks, and some animals to retreat to higher ground.  [[Soil]] nutrients diminish and erosion increases.  The incidence of [[malaria]] increases in areas where the rainy season coincides with high temperatures.  Animals have adaptation and survival strategies for the wetter regime.  The previous dry season leads to food shortages into the wet season, as the crops have yet to mature.

However, regions within the tropics may well not have a tropical climate. Under the [[Köppen climate classification]], much of the area within the geographical tropics is classed not as "tropical" but as "dry" ([[desert climate|arid]] or [[semi-arid climate|semi-arid]]), including the [[Sahara|Sahara Desert]], the [[Atacama Desert]] and [[Australian Outback]]. Also, there are [[alpine tundra]] and snow-capped peaks, including [[Mauna Kea]], [[Mount Kilimanjaro]], and the [[Andes]] as far south as the northernmost parts of [[Chile]] and [[Argentina]].

== Ecosystems ==

[[File:Tropical forest.JPG|thumb|[[Tropical forest]] near [[Fonds-Saint-Denis]], [[Martinique]]]]

[[Tropical plants]] and animals are those species native to the tropics. Tropical ecosystems may consist of [[tropical rainforest]]s, [[seasonal tropical forests]], [[Tropical and subtropical dry broadleaf forests|dry (often deciduous) forests]], spiny forests, [[desert]] and other habitat types. There are often significant areas of [[biodiversity]], and species [[endemism]] present, particularly in rainforests and seasonal forests. Some examples of important biodiversity and high endemism ecosystems are [[El Yunque National Forest]] in [[Puerto Rico]], [[Costa Rica]]n and [[Nicaragua]]n rainforests, [[Amazon Rainforest]] territories of several [[South America]]n countries, [[Madagascar dry deciduous forests]], the [[Waterberg Biosphere]] of [[South Africa]], and eastern [[Madagascar]] rainforests. Often the soils of tropical forests are low in [[nutrient]] content, making them quite vulnerable to [[slash-and-burn]] [[deforestation]] techniques, which are sometimes an element of [[shifting cultivation]] agricultural systems.

In [[biogeography]], the tropics are divided into [[Paleotropical Kingdom|Paleotropics]] (Africa, Asia and Australia) and [[Neotropical realm|Neotropics]] (Caribbean, Central America, and South America). Together, they are sometimes referred to as the Pantropic. The Neotropical region should not be confused with the [[ecozone]] of the same name; in the Old World, there is no such ambiguity, as the Paleotropics correspond to the Afrotropical, Indomalayan, and partly the Australasian and Oceanic ecozones.

==Tropicality==

"Tropicality" refers to the geographic imagery that many people outside the tropics have of that region. The idea of tropicality gained renewed interest in modern geographical discourse when French geographer [[Pierre Gourou]] published ''Les Pays Tropicaux'' (''The Tropical World'', in English), in the late 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold, David. "Illusory Riches: Representations of the Tropical World, 1840-1950", p. 6. Journal of Tropical Geography&lt;/ref&gt;

Tropicality encompasses at least two contradictory imageries. One is that the tropics represent a Garden of Eden, a heaven on Earth;&lt;ref name="Arnold, David p. 7"&gt;Arnold, David. "Illusory Riches: Representations of the Tropical World, 1840-1950", p. 7. Journal of Tropical Geography&lt;/ref&gt; the alternative is that the tropics are primitive and essentially lawless. The latter view was often discussed in Western literature—more so than the first.&lt;ref name="Arnold, David p. 7"/&gt; Evidence suggests that over time the more primitive view of the tropics in popular literature has been supplanted by more nuanced interpretations that reflect historical changes in values associated with tropical culture and ecology, although some primitive associations are persistent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Menadue|first=Christopher B.|date=2017-05-30|title=Trysts Tropiques: The Torrid Jungles of Science Fiction|url=https://journals.jcu.edu.au/etropic/article/view/3570|journal=eTropic: electronic journal of studies in the tropics|language=en|volume=16|issue=1|doi=10.25120/etropic.16.1.2017.3570|issn=1448-2940}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Western scholars also theorized about the reasons that tropical areas were deemed "inferior" to regions in the Northern Hemisphere. A popular explanation focused on the differences in climate—tropical regions typically have much warmer weather than northern regions. This theme led some scholars, including Gourou, to argue that warmer climates correlate to primitive indigenous populations lacking control over nature, compared to northern populations having "mastered nature".&lt;ref&gt;Arnold, David. "Illusory Riches: Representations of the Tropical World, 1840-1950", p. 13. Journal of Tropical Geography&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Western Canada map.png|right|thumb|250px|Western Canada, defined politically]]
[[File:Political map of Canada.png|right|thumb|250px|Political map of Canada]]

In [[Politics of Canada|Canadian politics]], '''Western alienation''' is the notion that the [[Western Canada|Western provinces]] – [[British Columbia]], [[Alberta]], [[Saskatchewan]] and [[Manitoba]] – have been alienated, and in extreme cases excluded, from mainstream Canadian political affairs in favour of the [[central Canada|central]] provinces of [[Ontario]] and [[Quebec]]. Western alienation claims that these latter two are politically represented, and economically favoured, more significantly than the former, which has given rise to the sentiment of alienation among many western Canadians. 
Dr. Roger Gibbins, author and former CEO of [[Canada West Foundation]] defines western alienation as "a political ideology of regional discontent rooted in the dissatisfaction of western Canadians with their relationship to and representation within the federal government".&lt;ref&gt;Gibbins, Roger.  1980.  Prairie Politics &amp; Society: Regionalism in Decline. Toronto:  Butterworths&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of alienation ==
Following [[Canadian confederation|Confederation]] in 1867, the first Canadian [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]], Sir [[John A. Macdonald]], announced a "[[National Policy]]" to "broaden the base of the Canadian economy and restore the confidence of Canadians in the development of their country".&lt;ref name=NationalPolicy&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/articles/national-policy |last = Brown| first= Robert Craig |title=National Policy |work=The Canadian Encyclopedia |accessdate=February 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The policy aimed to build a [[transcontinental railway]], to settle the [[Canadian Prairies|prairies]], and to develop a manufacturing base in Eastern Canada.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

Following a rapid increase in the price of oil between 1979 and 1980, the government of Prime Minister [[Pierre Trudeau]] introduced the [[National Energy Program]] (NEP), which intended to increase Canadian ownership in the oil industry, increase Canada's oil self-sufficiency and redistribute the wealth generated by oil production towards the federal government.&lt;ref name=NEP&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/articles/national-energy-program |last = Bregha| first= Francois |title=National Energy Program |work=The Canadian Encyclopedia |accessdate=February 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The program was extremely unpopular in the west,&lt;ref name=NEP /&gt; where most of Canada's oil is produced.&lt;ref name=oilproduction&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.neb.gc.ca/clf-nsi/rnrgynfmtn/nrgyrprt/nrgyvrvw/cndnnrgyvrvw2010/cndnnrgyvrvw2010-eng.html |author= National Energy Board |title=Canadian Energy Overview 2010 – Energy Briefing Note |accessdate=February 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It heightened distrust of the federal government, especially in Alberta. Many Albertans believed that the NEP was an unjustified intrusion of the federal government into an area of provincial jurisdiction, designed to strip their province of its natural wealth.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} By keeping the oil prices below world market prices, the eastern provinces were essentially being subsidized at the expense of the Western provinces.

== Current factors of alienation ==
There are a number of factors that have fueled discontent in Western Canada. Political factors include low political representation and the pronounced attention paid to the ongoing issue of [[Quebec sovereignty]] by the federal government.  A more potent, but ambiguous claim, is that the political agenda is controlled predominantly by politicians from Eastern Canada; who focus more on the vote-rich central regions of Quebec and Ontario at the expense of western interests. Economic factors include a general redistribution of income from western provinces to eastern ones through taxation and [[equalization payments]].

=== Political factors ===
{{Original research|section|date=December 2008}}
One source of western alienation is the [[List of Canadian provinces and territories by population|distribution of population]] in Canada. As of 2011, it was estimated that 23.6% in Quebec and 38.4% in Ontario—62% of the national population; on the other hand, 13.1%, 10.9%, 3.6%, 3.1% live in B.C., Alberta, Manitoba and Saskatchewan, 30.7 per cent of the overall population – all together less than half that of Ontario and Quebec.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2011/dp-pd/hlt-fst/pd-pl/Table-Tableau.cfm?LANG=Eng&amp;T=101&amp;SR=1&amp;S=3&amp;O=D Statistics Canada]&lt;/ref&gt; Westerners who feel alienated from the rest of Canada believe that politicians favour areas with larger populations, namely Quebec and Ontario where they can win more seats, and therefore formulate policies that favour them. Such policies may not be directly detrimental to the west, or intentionally discriminatory towards the region, but such perceived favouritism can have the effect of alienating Western Canadians.&lt;ref&gt;[http://esask.uregina.ca/entry/western_alienation.html The Encyclopedia of Saskatchewan]. Esask.uregina.ca (March 26, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of this uneven population distribution, Western Canadians are less represented in both the [[House of Commons of Canada|House of Commons]] and the [[Senate of Canada|Senate]]. While Alberta and B.C. have 607,543 and 733,343 citizens per senator respectively, Quebec and Ontario have 329,292 and 535,493. Because the constitution entitles a province to at least the same number of members of the House of Commons as the province had senators in 1982,&lt;ref&gt;[http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/const/annex_e.html#(99) Constitutional Act, 1982] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070101013244/http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/const/annex_e.html#(99) |date=January 1, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; some provinces, notably the [[Maritime Provinces]], have more members in the House of Commons than their population would otherwise warrant. The average number of citizens per riding in B.C. and Alberta (124,443 and 132,285 respectively) is somewhat higher than the national average of 109,167. Nonetheless, Ontario also has disproportionately few seats (at 123,767 per riding) while Manitoba and Saskatchewan have levels similar to the Maritimes.

Another source of Western irritation can be traced to the [[Quebec sovereignty]] movement. Some Western Canadians argue that Quebec receives undue attention from the rest of the country due to concerns about its desire to secede from Canada or obtain [[sovereignty-association]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/node/5243147 The Economist – Alienating the West]&lt;/ref&gt; The immense amounts of time and resources allowed to make sure Quebec stays within Canada, such as [[Bilingualism (Canada)|official bilingualism]], have been deemed excessive by some in the Western and Eastern separatist movements. For example, the Canadian government paid for actors and their transportation from all over Canada to participate in "love-ins" across Quebec during the [[1995 referendum]], in an attempt to promote Canadian federalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ici.radio-canada.ca/nouvelle/457258/rdi-15-love-in|title=Love-in à Montréal|last=ICI.Radio-Canada.ca|first=Zone Aucun thème sélectionné -|website=Radio-Canada.ca|language=fr-ca|access-date=2017-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/quebec-1995-referendum-look-back-1.3292214|title=1995 referendum: 20 years later, country still standing, but so is sovereignty|newspaper=CBC News|access-date=2017-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the referendum, citizens were even more outraged to learn about the now infamous [[sponsorship scandal]], which saw millions of federal dollars being illegally funneled into Quebec in an attempt to bolster Canadian nationalism.

[[Bloc Québécois]] (BQ) have nationalist policies and their entry into federal politics in 1991 has further irritated the west, as the party strongly supports policies perceived by the west as detrimental to them, including: [[carbon tax]]es and other measures specifically aimed at the oil industry, and the [[gun registry]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} During the same-sex marriage debate, some Albertan conservatives suggested that the federal law be amended to make the [[definition of marriage]] strictly a provincial issue,{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} believing the Bloc reasonably ought be swayed to support that as opposed to a law compelling the Albertan government to recognize the change.

=== Economic factors ===
{{Update|date=November 2010}}
Economic factors, including [[equalization payments#Canada|equalization payments]] and other [[Canadian Transfer Payments|transfer payments]], have caused great discontent, especially in Alberta. In 2005, Alberta's share of equalization payments was calculated to be approximately [[Canadian dollar|$]]1.1 billion,&lt;ref&gt;[http://bouquetsofgray.blogspot.com/2005/07/equalization-math.html Bouquets of Gray: Equalization math]. Bouquetsofgray.blogspot.com (July 18, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; less than that provided by, but significantly higher on a per capita basis than, Ontario.  Equalization payments are made by the federal government to the six current "have-not" provinces.  Unlike social and health transfers, there are no restrictions over how this money is spent at the provincial level. In 2009–2010, Quebec received $8.552 billion,&lt;ref name=FedSupport&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fin.gc.ca/fedprov/mtp-eng.asp#Quebec |title=Federal Support to Quebec |publisher=Department of Finance Canada |accessdate=May 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; making it the single largest beneficiary, as it has been throughout the program's history.  In the 2009–2010 fiscal year, Ontario received an equalization payment of $347 million,&lt;ref name=FedSupport/&gt; the first time in the 51-year history of the program.

British Columbia was a "have-not" province for just over five years, ending in 2006–2007, when it received $459 million.&lt;ref name=FedSupport/&gt;

===Geographic factors===

Geographically, the densely populated areas of the four western provinces are separated from [[Southern Ontario]] by [[Northern Ontario]], a very sparsely populated region. In particular, [[Northwestern Ontario]] borders [[Manitoba]] and is almost equal in size to Manitoba, but contains less than one fifth of Manitoba's population.

The implications of these facts were recognized as early as the 1880s, when the government of [[Sir John A. Macdonald]] attempted to make much of what is now Northwestern Ontario part of Manitoba. Although Macdonald justified this transfer on the basis that it would be easier to administer the region from Winnipeg as opposed to Toronto, Ontario fiercely protested and Macdonald was compelled to back down.

Other than by air, the "all-Canadian" travel links between Eastern and Western Canada are considered poor by modern North American standards. One option is to take [[The Canadian]], a [[passenger train]] now operated by [[Via Rail]] two or three times weekly depending on the season. By train, it takes roughly 36 hours on average to travel from [[Winnipeg]] to [[Toronto]]. The only other options by land is to travel on [[Ontario Highway 17]] or [[Ontario Highway 11]], which are both two lane highway for most of their length. Most Canadians who wish to travel from East to West and/or vice versa (and for whatever reason are unable or unwilling to fly) reject the all-Canadian routes in favour of travelling through the [[United States]]{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}, which is both shorter and less expensive. This preference has persisted even in the face of stricter border controls instituted since the [[September 11 attacks]].

Therefore, some commentators have compared the [[Canadian Shield]] to an ocean in the way that it physically separates the peoples of Western and Eastern Canada. For the people of Western Canada, this has the potential to create the perception that the West is little more than a colony, ruled from distant [[Ottawa]] in much the same way that the British North American colonies were once ruled from distant [[London]].

== State of affairs since 2005 ==

Between 2006 and 2015, Western alienation was not a significant force in Canadian politics. For the first time since 1993, Western provinces were represented by primarily governing MPs. Protests over equalization payments from former Alberta [[Premier of Alberta|premier]] [[Ralph Klein]] and others objected to the formula the federal government used to determine the distribution of the payments. Klein had been quoted as threatening to drop out of the program, although this would have been a symbolic act with no legal weight since the program is funded from the federal government's general revenues. Alberta and Saskatchewan were successful in lowering the degree of non-renewable resources used in calculating a province's equalization status.

There were also calls for the [[Alberta separatism|separation]] of at least Alberta from Canada, most notably from [[University of Alberta]] professor [[emeritus]] Leon Craig; however, such arguments were rare, while not necessarily new, and were not expected to materialize into a significant political movement in the near future.

Later decisions of the minority [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservative]] government of [[Stephen Harper]] – on issues such as [[Income trusts#New rules|income trusts]] and the [[Québécois nation motion|recognition of the Québécois]] as a "nation within a united Canada" – caused some dissent amongst a segment of Western Canadians who traditionally supported the Tories. These feelings fostered only a small ripple in the Tories' popularity in Alberta.
