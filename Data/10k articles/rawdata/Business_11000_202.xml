[[image:Zscore.JPG|thumb|Example of an [[Microsoft Excel|Excel]] spreadsheet that uses Altman Z-score to predict the [[probability]] that a firm will go into [[bankruptcy]] within two years ]]
The '''Z-score formula for predicting bankruptcy''' was published in 1968 by [[Edward I. Altman]], who was, at the time, an Assistant Professor of Finance at [[New York University]]. The formula may be used to predict the probability that a firm will go into [[bankruptcy]] within two years.  Z-scores are used to predict corporate defaults and an easy-to-calculate control measure for the [[financial distress]] status of companies in academic studies.  The Z-score uses multiple corporate income and balance sheet values to measure the financial health of a company.

==The formula==
The Z-score is a [[linear combination]] of four or five common business ratios, weighted by coefficients.  The coefficients were estimated by identifying a set of firms which had declared bankruptcy and then collecting a [[pair-matched sample|matched sample]] of firms which had survived, with matching by industry and approximate size (assets).

Altman applied the statistical method of [[discriminant analysis]] to a dataset of publicly held manufacturers. The estimation was originally based on data from publicly held manufacturers, but has since been re-estimated based on other datasets for private manufacturing, non-manufacturing and service companies.

The original data sample consisted of 66 firms, half of which had filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 7.  All businesses in the database were manufacturers, and small firms with assets of &lt;&amp;nbsp;$1 million were eliminated.

The original Z-score formula was as follows:&lt;ref&gt;realequityresearch.dk/Documents/Z-Score_Altman_1968.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

: ''Z'' = 1.2''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + 1.4''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 3.3''X''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 0.6''X''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 1.0''X''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;.

: ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = working capital / total assets.  Measures liquid assets in relation to the size of the company.

: ''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = retained earnings / total assets.  Measures profitability that reflects the company's age and earning power.

: ''X''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = earnings before interest and taxes  / total assets. Measures operating efficiency apart from tax and leveraging factors.  It recognizes operating earnings as being important to long-term viability.

: ''X''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; = market value of equity / book value of total liabilities. Adds market dimension that can show up security price fluctuation as a possible red flag.

: ''X''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; = sales / total assets.  Standard measure for total asset turnover (varies greatly from industry to industry).

Altman found that the ratio profile for the bankrupt group fell at −0.25 avg, and for the non-bankrupt group at +4.48 avg.

==Precedents==
Altman's work built upon research by accounting researcher [[William Beaver]] and others.  In the 1930s and on, Mervyn and others had collected matched samples and assessed that various accounting ratios appeared to be valuable in predicting bankruptcy. Altman's Z-score is a customized version of the discriminant analysis technique of [[R. A. Fisher]] (1936).

William Beaver's work, published in 1966 and 1968, was the first to apply a statistical method, [[t-tests]] to predict bankruptcy for a pair-matched sample of firms.  Beaver applied this method to evaluate the importance of each of several accounting ratios based on univariate analysis, using each accounting ratio one at a time.  Altman's primary improvement was to apply a statistical method, discriminant analysis, which could take into account multiple variables simultaneously.

==Accuracy and effectiveness==
In its initial test, the Altman Z-Score was found to be 72% accurate in predicting bankruptcy two years before the event, with a Type II error (false negatives) of 6% (Altman, 1968). In a series of subsequent tests covering three periods over the next 31 years (up until 1999), the model was found to be approximately 80%–90% accurate in predicting bankruptcy one year before the event, with a Type II error (classifying the firm as bankrupt when it does not go bankrupt) of approximately 15%–20% (Altman, 2000).&lt;ref&gt;[http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~ealtman/Zscores.pdf Predicting Financial Distress of Companies: Revisiting the Z-SCORE and ZETA Models]&lt;/ref&gt;

From about 1985 onwards, the Z-scores gained wide acceptance by auditors, management accountants, courts, and database systems used for loan evaluation (Eidleman). The formula's approach has been used in a variety of contexts and countries, although it was designed originally for publicly held manufacturing companies with assets of more than $1 million. Later variations by Altman were designed to be applicable to privately held companies (the Altman Z'-Score) and non-manufacturing companies (the Altman Z"-Score).

Neither the Altman models nor other balance sheet-based models are recommended for use with financial companies. This is because of the opacity of financial companies' balance sheets and their frequent use of off-balance sheet items. There are market-based formulas used to predict the default of financial firms (such as the [[Merton Model]]), but these have limited predictive value because they rely on market data (fluctuations of share and options prices to imply fluctuations in asset values) to predict a market event (default, i.e., the decline in asset values below the value of a firm's liabilities).&lt;ref&gt;[http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~ealtman/Zscores.pdf Predicting Financial Distress of Companies:Revisiting the Z-SCORE and ZETA Models]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hyundai car assembly line.jpg|thumb|[[Hyundai]]'s car assembly line]]

An '''assembly line''' is a [[manufacturing]] process (often called a ''progressive assembly'') in which parts (usually [[interchangeable parts]]) are added as the semi-finished assembly moves from workstation to workstation where the parts are added in sequence until the final assembly is produced. By mechanically moving the parts to the assembly work and moving the semi-finished assembly from work station to work station, a finished product can be assembled faster and with less labor than by having workers carry parts to a stationary piece for assembly.

Assembly lines are common methods of assembling complex items such as [[automobile]]s and other [[transportation]] equipment, [[household]] appliances and [[Consumer electronics|electronic goods]].

==Concepts==
[[File:Final assembly 3.jpg|thumb|[[Lotus Cars]] assembly line as of 2008]]
Assembly lines are designed for the sequential organization of [[worker]]s, [[tool]]s or machines, and parts. The motion of workers is minimized to the extent possible. All parts or assemblies are handled either by [[conveyor]]s or motorized vehicles such as [[fork lifts]], or [[gravity]], with no manual trucking. Heavy lifting is done by machines such as [[overhead crane]]s or fork lifts. Each worker typically performs one simple operation.

According to [[Henry Ford]]:

{{quote|The principles of assembly are these:

(1) Place the tools and the men in the sequence of the operation so that each component part shall travel the least possible distance while in the process of finishing.

(2) Use work slides or some other form of carrier so that when a workman completes his operation, he drops the part always in the same place—which place must always be the most convenient place to his hand—and if possible have gravity carry the part to the next workman for his own.

(3) Use sliding assembling lines by which the parts to be assembled are delivered at convenient distances.&lt;ref name="Ford1922"&gt;{{Harvnb|Ford|Crowther|1922}}, p. 45 (on line version), p. 80 (print version)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Simple example==

Consider the assembly of a [[car]]: assume that certain steps in the assembly line are to install the engine, install the hood, and install the wheels (in that order, with arbitrary interstitial steps); only one of these steps can be done at a time. In traditional production, only one car would be assembled at a time. If [[engine]] installation takes 20 minutes, [[Hood (vehicle)|hood]] installation takes five minutes, and [[wheel]]s installation takes 10 minutes, then a car can be produced every 35 minutes.

In an assembly line, car assembly is split between several stations, all working simultaneously. When one station is finished with a car, it passes it on to the next. By having three stations, a total of three different cars can be operated on at the same time, each one at a different stage of its assembly.

After finishing its work on the first car, the engine installation crew can begin working on the second car. While the engine installation crew works on the second car, the first car can be moved to the hood station and fitted with a hood, then to the wheels station and be fitted with wheels. After the engine has been installed on the second car, the second car moves to the hood assembly. At the same time, the third car moves to the engine assembly. When the third car's engine has been mounted, it then can be moved to the hood station; meanwhile, subsequent cars (if any) can be moved to the engine installation station.

Assuming no loss of time when moving a car from one station to another, the longest stage on the assembly line determines the [[throughput (business)|throughput]] (20 minutes for the engine installation) so a car can be produced every 20 minutes, once the first car taking 35 minutes has been produced.

==History==
Before the [[Industrial Revolution]], most manufactured products were made individually by hand. A single [[Artisan|craftsman]] or team of craftsmen would create each part of a product. They would use their skills and tools such as [[File (tool)|files]] and [[knives]] to create the individual parts. They would then assemble them into the final product, making cut-and-try changes in the parts until they fit and could work together ([[craft production]]).

[[Division of labor]] was practiced in China where state run monopolies [[mass-produced]] metal agricultural implements, china, armor, and weapons centuries before it appeared in Europe on the eve of the Industrial Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Merson|1990||p=}}{{page needed|date=December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adam Smith]] discussed the [[division of labour]] in the manufacture of [[pins]] at length in his book ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'' (published in 1776).

The [[Venetian Arsenal]], dating to about 1104, operated similar to a production line. Ships moved down a canal and were fitted by the various shops they passed. At the peak of its [[efficiency]] in the early 16th century, the [[Venetian Arsenal]] employed some 16,000 people who could apparently produce nearly one ship each day, and could fit out, arm, and provision a newly built [[galley]] with standardized parts on an assembly-line basis. Although the Venice Arsenal lasted until the early [[Industrial Revolution]], production line methods did not become common even then.

===Industrial revolution===

The [[Industrial Revolution]] led to a proliferation of manufacturing and invention. Many industries, notably [[textile]]s, [[firearm]]s, [[clockmaking|clocks and watches]],&lt;ref name = "xovodv"&gt;[[G.N. Georgano]] 1985.{{full citation needed|date=December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[horse-drawn vehicle]]s, [[Locomotive|railway locomotive]]s, [[sewing machine]]s, and [[bicycle]]s, saw expeditious improvement in materials handling, machining, and assembly during the 19th century, although modern concepts such as [[industrial engineering]] and [[logistics]] had not yet been named.

[[File:PulleyShip.JPG|thumb|right|The [[Pulley#Block and tackle|pulley block]] was the first manufacture to become fully automated at the [[Portsmouth Block Mills]] in the early 19th century.]]

The automatic [[flour]] [[Mill (grinding)|mill]] built by [[Oliver Evans]] in 1785 was called the beginning of modern [[bulk material handling]] by Roe (1916). Evans's mill used a leather belt bucket elevator, [[screw conveyor]]s, canvas belt conveyors, and other mechanical devices to completely automate the process of making flour. The innovation spread to other mills and breweries.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Roe|1916|p=}}{{page needed|date=December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hounshell|1984|p=}}{{page needed|date=December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Probably the earliest industrial example of a linear and continuous assembly process is the [[Portsmouth Block Mills]], built between 1801 and 1803. [[Marc Isambard Brunel]] (father of [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]]), with the help of [[Henry Maudslay]] and others, designed 22 types of machine tools to make the parts for the rigging [[Block (sailing)|blocks]] used by the [[Royal Navy]]. This factory was so successful that it remained in use until the 1960s, with the workshop still visible at [[HMNB Portsmouth|HM Dockyard]] in [[Portsmouth]], and still containing some of the original machinery.

One of the earliest examples of an almost modern factory layout, designed for easy material handling, was the [[Nasmyth, Gaskell and Company|Bridgewater Foundry]]. The factory grounds were bordered by the [[Bridgewater Canal]] and the [[Liverpool and Manchester Railway]]. The buildings were arranged in a line with a railway for carrying the work going through the buildings. [[Crane (machine)|Crane]]s were used for lifting the heavy work, which sometimes weighed in the tens of tons. The work passed sequentially through to erection of framework and final assembly.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Musson|Robinson|1969|pp=491–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bridgewater foundary.gif|thumb|left|The [[Nasmyth, Gaskell and Company|Bridgewater Foundry]], pictured in 1839, one of the earliest factories to use an almost modern [[Process layout|layout]], workflow, and material-handling system]]

The first flow assembly line was initiated at the factory of [[Richard Garrett &amp; Sons]], Leiston Works in [[Leiston]] in the [[English county]] of [[Suffolk]] for the manufacture of [[portable steam engine]]s. The assembly line area was called '[[Long Shop Museum|The Long Shop]]' on account of its length and was fully operational by early 1853. The [[boiler]] was brought up from the foundry and put at the start of the line, and as it progressed through the building it would stop at various stages where new parts would be added. From the upper level, where other parts were made, the lighter parts would be lowered over a balcony and then fixed onto the machine on the ground level. When the machine reached the end of the shop, it would be completed.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.industriouseast.org.uk/index.php?pageId=147&amp;anchor=164&amp;filter=gb |title= Long Shop Museum |accessdate= 2012-12-17}}{{full citation needed|date= December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interchangeable parts===

During the early 19th century, the development of [[machine tool]]s such as the [[screw-cutting lathe]], [[Planer (metalworking)|metal planer]], and [[milling machine]], and of toolpath control via [[Jig (tool)|jigs]] and [[Fixture (tool)|fixtures]], provided the prerequisites for the modern assembly line by making [[interchangeable parts]] a practical reality.

===Late 19th century steam and electric conveyors===

Steam powered [[conveyor lift]]s began being used for loading and unloading ships some time in the last quarter of the 19th century.&lt;ref name="Wells1890"&gt;{{harvnb|Wells|1890|p=}}{{page needed|date=December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hounshell (1984) shows a {{circa|1885}} sketch of an electric powered conveyor moving cans through a filling line in a canning factory.

The [[meatpacking]] industry of [[Chicago]] is believed to be one of the first industrial assembly lines (or dis-assembly lines) to be utilized in the United States starting in 1867. Workers would stand at fixed stations and a pulley system would bring the meat to each worker and they would complete one task. Henry Ford and others have written about the influence of this [[slaughterhouse]] practice on the later developments at Ford Motor Company.

===20th century===

According to Domm, the implementation of mass production of an automobile via an assembly line may be credited to [[Ransom Olds]], who used it to build the first mass-produced automobile, the [[Oldsmobile Curved Dash]].&lt;ref name="michigan yesterday"&gt;{{harvnb|Domm|2009|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Olds [[patented]] the assembly line concept, which he put to work in his [[Olds Motor Vehicle Company]] factory in 1901.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first= Phil |last= Ament |url= http://www.ideafinder.com/history/inventions/assbline.htm |title= Assembly Line History: Invention of the Assembly Line |publisher= Ideafinder.com |accessdate= 2011-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At [[Ford Motor Company]], the assembly line was introduced by William "Pa" Klann upon his return from visiting [[Gustavus Franklin Swift|Swift &amp; Company's slaughterhouse]] in Chicago and viewing what was referred to as the "disassembly line", where carcasses were butchered as they moved along a conveyor. The efficiency of one person removing the same piece over and over without himself moving caught his attention. He reported the idea to [[Peter E. Martin]], soon to be head of Ford production, who was doubtful at the time but encouraged him to proceed. Others at Ford have claimed to have put the idea forth to [[Henry Ford]], but Pa Klann's slaughterhouse revelation is well documented in the archives at the Henry Ford Museum&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Klann |first= W. C. |date= n.d. |title= Reminiscences |id= Accession 65 |publisher= Henry Ford Museum &amp; Greenfield Village Archives}}&lt;/ref&gt; and elsewhere, making him an important contributor to the modern automated assembly line concept. Ford was appreciative, having visited the highly automated 40-acre [[Sears]] [[mail order]] handling facility around 1906. At Ford, the process was an evolution by trial and error&lt;ref name=Weber2013&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.assemblymag.com/articles/91581-the-moving-assembly-line-turns-100 |title=The Moving Assembly Line Turns 100 |last=Weber |first=Austin |publisher=Assembly Magazine |date=2013-10-01 |accessdate=2017-03-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160826161557/http://www.assemblymag.com/articles/91581-the-moving-assembly-line-turns-100 |archive-date=2016-08-26 |dead-url=no |quote=The assembly line ... was the result of a long period of trial and error. The assembly line wasn't a planned development; rather, it emerged in 1913 from a dynamic situation. People such as Carl Emde, William Klann and William Knudsen all played key roles in early automation efforts at Ford's Highland Park factory. Two individuals were essential to the success of the moving assembly line: Clarence Avery and Charles Sorensen. constant redesign of the Model T. Many components were tweaked regularly to make the vehicle easier to assemble. In 1913 alone, Ford made more than 100 design changes every month. Continuous experimentation was the rule rather than the exception at Ford's Highland Park plant. Ford engineers were constantly redesigning and tweaking jigs and fixtures, and planning new machine tools or fixing old ones, to achieve higher production. }}&lt;/ref&gt; of a team consisting primarily of [[Peter E. Martin]], the factory superintendent; [[Charles E. Sorensen]], Martin's assistant; [[Clarence W. Avery]]; [[C. Harold Wills]], draftsman and toolmaker; [[Charles Ebender]]; and [[József Galamb]]. Some of the groundwork for such development had recently been laid by the intelligent layout of [[machine tool]] placement that [[Walter Flanders]] had been doing at Ford up to 1908.

The moving assembly line was developed for the [[Ford Model T]] and began operation on October 7, 1913, at the [[Highland Park Ford Plant]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=October 7, 2013|title=Ford's Assembly Line Turns 100: How It Changed Manufacturing and Society|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/autos/ford-assembly-line-turns-100-changed-society-article-1.1478331|publisher=[[New York Daily News]]|accessdate=August 27, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131130021237/http://www.nydailynews.com/autos/ford-assembly-line-turns-100-changed-society-article-1.1478331|archivedate=November 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/moving-assembly-line-at-ford |title=Moving Assembly Line at Ford|publisher=[[History (U.S. TV channel)|The History Channel]]|work=This Day in History|accessdate=September 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and continued to evolve after that, using [[time and motion study]].&lt;ref name=Weber2013/&gt; The assembly line, driven by [[conveyor belts]], reduced production time for a [[Model T]] to just 93 minutes&lt;ref name="michigan yesterday"/&gt; by dividing the process into 45 steps.&lt;ref name=Weber2008&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.assemblymag.com/articles/85803-how-the-model-t-was-assembled |title=How the Model T Was Assembled |last=Weber |first=Austin |publisher=Assembly Magazine |date=2008-09-02 |accessdate=2017-03-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306031306/http://www.assemblymag.com/articles/85803-how-the-model-t-was-assembled |archive-date=2016-03-06 |dead-url=no |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Producing cars quicker than paint of the day could dry, it had an immense influence on the world.

In 1922, Ford (through his ghostwriter Crowther) said of his 1913 assembly line:

{{quote|I believe that this was the first moving line ever installed. The idea came in a general way from the overhead trolley that the Chicago packers use in dressing beef.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ford|Crowther|1922|p= 81}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Charles E. Sorensen]], in his 1956 memoir ''My Forty Years with Ford'', presented a different version of development that was not so much about individual "inventors" as a gradual, logical development of [[industrial engineering]]:

{{quote|What was worked out at Ford was the practice of moving the work from one worker to another until it became a complete unit, then arranging the flow of these units at the right time and the right place to a moving final assembly line from which came a finished product. Regardless of earlier uses of some of these principles, the direct line of succession of mass production and its intensification into automation stems directly from what we worked out at Ford Motor Company between 1908 and 1913. Henry Ford is generally regarded as the father of mass production. He was not. He was the sponsor of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sorensen|1956|p=116}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

As a result of these developments in method, Ford's cars came off the line in three-minute intervals, or six feet per minute.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ford|Crowther|1922|Chapter IV}}{{page needed|date=March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was much faster than previous methods, increasing production by eight to one (requiring 12.5 man-hours before, 1 hour 33 minutes after), while using less manpower.&lt;ref name = "xovodv"/&gt; It was so successful, [[paint]] became a bottleneck. Only [[japan black]] would dry fast enough, forcing the company to drop the variety of colors available before 1914, until fast-drying [[Duco]] [[lacquer]] was developed in 1926.&lt;ref name = "xovodv"/&gt;

The assembly line technique was an integral part of the diffusion of the automobile into American society. Decreased costs of production allowed the cost of the Model T to fall within the budget of the American middle class. In 1908, the price of a Model T was around $825, and by 1912 it had decreased to around $575. This price reduction is comparable to a reduction from $15,000 to $10,000 in dollar terms from the year 2000. In 1914, an assembly line worker could buy a Model T with four months' pay.&lt;ref name = "xovodv"/&gt;

Ford's complex safety procedures—especially assigning each worker to a specific location instead of allowing them to roam about—dramatically reduced the rate of [[injury]]. The combination of high wages and high efficiency is called "[[Fordism]]", and was copied by most major industries. The efficiency gains from the assembly line also coincided with the take-off of the United States. The assembly line forced workers to work at a certain pace with very repetitive motions which led to more output per worker while other countries were using less productive methods.

In the [[automotive industry]], its success was dominating, and quickly spread worldwide. Ford France and Ford Britain in 1911, Ford Denmark 1923, Ford Germany and Ford Japan 1925; in 1919, Vulcan (Southport, Lancashire) was the first native European manufacturer to adopt it. Soon, companies had to have assembly lines, or risk going broke by not being able to compete; by 1930, 250 companies which did not had disappeared.&lt;ref name = "xovodv"/&gt;

The massive demand for military hardware in World War II prompted assembly-line techniques in shipbuilding and aircraft production. Thousands of [[Liberty Ship]]s were built making extensive use of prefabrication, enabling ship assembly to be completed in weeks or even days. After having produced fewer than 3,000 planes for the United States Military in 1939, American aircraft manufacturers built over 300,000 planes in World War II. [[Vultee]] pioneered the use of the powered assembly line for aircraft manufacturing. Other companies quickly followed. As [[William S. Knudsen]] (having worked at Ford,&lt;ref name=Weber2013/&gt; GM and the National Defense Advisory Commission) observed, "We won because we smothered the enemy in an avalanche of production, the like of which he had never seen, nor dreamed possible."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Herman|2012|pp=176–91}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Parker|2012|pp=5–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Improved working conditions==
In his 1922 autobiography,&lt;ref name="Ford1922"/&gt; Henry Ford mentions several benefits of the assembly line including:

*Workers do no heavy lifting.
*No stooping or bending over.
*No special training required.
*There are jobs that almost anyone can do.
*Provided employment to immigrants.

The gains in [[productivity]] allowed Ford to increase worker pay from $1.50 per day to $5.00 per day once employees reached three years of service on the assembly line. Ford continued on to reduce the hourly work week while continuously lowering the Model T price. These goals appear altruistic; however, it has been argued that they were implemented by Ford in order to reduce high employee turnover: when the assembly line was introduced in 1913, it was discovered that "every time the company wanted to add 100 men to its factory personnel, it was necessary to hire 963" in order to counteract the natural distaste the assembly line seems to have inspired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Crawford |first=Matthew |title=Shop Class as Soulcraft |url=http://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/shop-class-as-soulcraft |work=[[The New Atlantis (journal)|The New Atlantis]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130601015022/http://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/shop-class-as-soulcraft |archivedate=2013-06-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sociological problems==
[[Sociology|Sociological]] work has explored the [[social alienation]] and [[boredom]] that many workers feel because of the repetition of doing the same specialized task all day long.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |jstor= 4105309 |title= Alienation and Freedom: The Factory Worker and His Industry |authorlink= Bob Blauner |first= Robert |last= Blauner |journal= [[Technology and Culture]] |volume= 6 |issue= 3 |date= Summer 1965 |pages= 518–519}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of capitalism's most famous critics, [[Karl Marx]], expressed in his ''[[Marx's theory of alienation|Entfremdung]]'' theory the belief that in order to achieve job satisfaction workers need to see themselves in the objects they have created, that products should be "mirrors in which workers see their reflected essential nature." Marx viewed labour as a chance for us to externalize facets of our personality. Marxists argue that specialization makes it very difficult for any worker to feel they may be contributing to the real needs of humanity. The repetitive nature of specialized tasks causes, they say, a feeling of disconnection between what a worker does all day, who they really are, and what they would ideally be able to contribute to society. Marx also argued that specialised jobs are insecure, since the worker is expendable as soon as costs rise and technology can replace more expensive human labour.&lt;ref&gt;Marx, Karl. "Comment on James Mill," ''Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844'': 1844.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since workers have to stand in the same place for hours and repeat the same motion hundreds of times per day [[Repetitive strain injury|repetitive stress injuries]] are a possible pathology of [[occupational safety]]. [[Industrial noise]] also proved dangerous. When it was not too high, workers were often prohibited from talking. [[Charles Piaget]], a [[skilled worker]] at the [[LIP factory]], recalled that beside being prohibited from speaking, the semi-skilled workers had only 25 centimeters in which to move.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview|url = http://www.mouvements.asso.fr/spip.php?article52|title = Leçons d'autogestion|trans-title = Autogestion Lessons|interviewer = |language = fr|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070707192357/http://www.mouvements.asso.fr/spip.php?article52|archivedate = 7 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Industrial [[ergonomics]] later tried to minimize physical trauma.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5395">A '''batey''' (plural is '''bateyes''') is a settlement around a [[sugar]] mill. They can be found in [[Cuba]], [[Dominican Republic]] and [[Puerto Rico]].

[[Image:Sugar mill consuelo.jpg|thumb|250px|Sugar mill in Ingenio Consuelo, Dominican Republic.]]

In [[Cuba]] and the [[Dominican Republic]], the basic conglomerate unit of a sugar production is usually called an ''ingenio.'' An ingenio consists of a central administrative office, a [[sugar cane mill]], a [[sugar refinery]], the town around the office and refinery, sugar fields (''campos de caña''), and miscellaneous production equipment like [[truck]]s, [[train]]s, [[tractor]]s, weighing scales, and housing for workers, usually in what is called a ''batey.''

[[Image:Bateymargsign.jpg|thumb|250px|Canefields beside a batey near Ingenio Consuelo, Dominican Republic.]]
A batey is a company town consisting of barracks and a few houses. Bateyes vary in size considerably. They are located close to [[sugarcane|cane]] fields so that groups of workers can live nearby their labor site.

[[Image:Batey Marg 2.jpg|thumb|250px|Dwellings on a batey in [[Holguín]], Cuba.]]

==Dominican Republic==

Every year since 1933, seasonal [[immigrant]]s from [[Haiti]] have arrived to work the sugar [[harvest]] in the [[Dominican Republic]]. The migrants are lodged in rooms at the batey sometimes with no facilities and expected to work cropping sugar cane in long days with hard hours. In the past, Dominican [[head of state|heads of state]] paid Haitian heads of state a finder's fee to round up large numbers of Haitians. However, the Dominican Government has sent police officers to kidnap Haitian men, women, and children, destroyed their documents and have forcibly moved them to the bateys in the Dominican Republic.

These days, individual ingenios and land owners (''colonos'') pay [[recruiter|headhunters]] (''buscones''), a fee for each cane cutter (''picador'') the headhunter provides. A headhunter may entice the prospective labourer with promises of a [[work permit]], and often requires a large fee from the prospective immigrant. When immigrants arrive, they may find that they are not free to leave the batey until they finish the labor.

Over time, some of these migrants have stayed through the six months that follow the cane harvest (''zafra''), called "dead time" (''tiempo muerto''), and have started families with Haitian women that have migrated as well. Bateys are unique in culture and language in their mix of which is [[Haitian people|Haitian]] and which is [[People of the Dominican Republic|Dominican]].

[[Image:First Batey 4.jpg|thumb|250px|Kitchen facilities in a dwelling on a batey.]]
The [[government of the Dominican Republic|Dominican government]] has historically provided fewer public services to bateys than to similarly sized communities in the rest of the country. The bateys were regarded as exceptions to the country's governance system. It was often left to the State Sugar Council (CEA: Consejo Estatal de Azúcar) or private companies to provide basic services, a responsibility that all too often they did not fulfill. Bateys were often still regarded as places where only Haitians (non-citizens) live.

Since the Haitians who originally filled the bateys were not legal immigrants, their children have often been denied [[citizenship]] papers because they are in transit. Without citizenship papers from Haiti, these children of Haitian immigrants cannot go to school nor can they receive the benefits of other [[public services]]; however, a number of non-governmental organizations have attempted to address this problem by operating [[primary schools]] on bateys trying to get them Dominican citizenship.

[[Image:BATEY SCHOOL.JPG|thumb|250px|School established on a batey near [[Consuelo, San Pedro de Macorís|Consuelo]], Dominican Republic.]]
In the past, sugar was a profitable industry. However, the Dominican sugar industry is no longer competitive, and when combined with the historical lack of educational and health services to these communities, the low wages have tended to make bateys some of the poorest communities in the country.

The current trend in the Dominican Republic is for the ingenios to stop production, and thus the only source of income for the community and for the bateys to very slowly transform themselves into new sorts of communities. [[Los Alcarrizos]] in the [[Santo Domingo Province|Santo Domingo province]] is a good example of something that used to be a batey but now is a [[municipality]] which survives through jobs in the area and in Santo Domingo. The Batey is a modern form of slavery where Haitians are paid less than $2.00 American dollars for 12-14 hours of labor. They are forced to sleep on foam boards and live without electricity,running water.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9768">'''Bernard Ades''' (July 3, 1903 – May 27, 1986) was an American [[Communist]] who is most known for his defense of Euel Lee, an [[African American]] accused of murdering a white family in [[Maryland]] in 1931. During a murder trial which was still heavily influenced by “[[Jim Crow]]” laws, Ades set precedents that allowed a [[change of venue]] outside a highly prejudiced environment, and he fought for the right to have African Americans serve on jury panels.

== Early life ==
Bernard Ades was born in [[Baltimore, Maryland]], the second child of Harry and Fanny Levine Ades. His father, a Russian born and devout traditionalist [[Jew]], moved to [[United States|America]] and started an umbrella manufacturing business with his brother, Simon Ades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Marcus|first1=Jacob Rader|title=United States Jewry, 1776-1985|date=January 1, 1990|publisher=Wayne State University Press|isbn=978-0814321867|pages=102|edition=1st}}&lt;!--|accessdate=1 December 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This would later be of significance during the [[McCarthy Era]] when Bernard Ades would be put under special surveillance for his ties to [[Russia]] and his Communist beliefs.

== Education ==
Ades graduated from [[Baltimore City College]] (a secondary school). Afterward, he attended the [[University of Maryland Law School]] for his LLB and later earned a bachelor's degree in economics at [[Johns Hopkins University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bernard Ades|url=http://www.alba-valb.org/volunteers/bernard-ades|website=www.alba-valb.org|publisher=The Abraham Lincoln Brigade Archives|accessdate=1 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life and career ==

=== Legal career ===
Ades was a part of the [[Communist Party USA|Communist Party]] which influenced the types of legal cases he took. For the Euel Lee, “Orphan Jones” Case in 1931, Ades was employed by the [[International Labor Defense]] (affiliated with the Communist Party) in a campaign against [[lynching]]. Among others he represented Euel Lee (aka Orphan Jones) whose capital case captured national attention.

Euel Lee, an African American farmhand, was accused of murdering a white family of four for refusing to pay his full wages. The case took place in the Eastern Shore of Maryland, still heavily influenced by [[Jim Crow Laws]] with [[institutionalized discrimination]]. The tactics that Ades used to ensure a fair trial brought him infamy in Maryland and resulted in one instance of being mobbed and beaten.&lt;ref&gt;"Governor's Aid Sought in Case of Orphan Jones". The Afro American. 7 November 1931.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Governor Will "Wash Hands" in Murder Case". The Afro American. November 14th, 1931. Retrieved 1 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though Ades won his client a change of venue, two new trials and the right to have African Americans on jury panels,&lt;ref&gt;"Guard Lee Judges After 'Crank's' Note". ''The Sunday Morning Star''. 24 Jan 2934. Retrieved 1 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  Ades lost the trial and Lee was soon after executed by [[hanging]] on October 28, 1933. However, his defense of Lee set precedents that would be used throughout the [[civil rights movement]].&lt;ref&gt;José F. (2009). "Freedom of Association, the Communist Party, and the Hollywood Ten: The Forgotten First Amendment Legacy of Charles Hamilton Houston".McGeorge Law Review 40 (25): 25–54. Retrieved 1 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

A fight ensued over the body where Ades demanded the right to bury Euel Lee in [[New York (state)|New York]] as he was granted the right to his client's body in Lee's [[last will and testament]]. Fearing riots and further racial unrest, Ades was denied the right to bury the body in New York and is currently interred in an unmarked grave in [[Brooklyn, Maryland]].&lt;ref&gt;Moore, Joseph E. (7 Nov 2011). Murder on Maryland's Eastern Shore: Race, Politics and the Case of Orphan Jones. The History Press. pp. 160, 202–204.{{ISBN|9781614230953}}. Retrieved 1 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Charges of unprofessional conduct were lodged in Maryland and before the US [[Bar association|Bar]] for his handling of the case, and the ensuing social unrest which the coverage of the case caused.&lt;ref&gt;Matthews, Ralph (December 15, 1934). "Watching the Big Parade". The Afro American. Retrieved 1 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Ades was defended by Charles Houston of [[Howard University Law School]] and by [[Thurgood Marshall|“Young Thurgood” Marshall]] of the [[NAACP]]. This also set a precedent as the first case of a white man being defended in court by an African American.&lt;ref&gt;Burghardt Du Bois, William Edward (1973). The Correspondence of W. E. B. Du Bois: Selections, 1877-1934. Univ of Massachusetts Press. p. 39. {{ISBN|9781558491038}}. Retrieved 1 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The Maryland Bar publicly reprimanded Ades for his conduct while also praising his defense of Lee: 
"It does not seem to the court that the extreme punishment of disbarment should be inflicted. Much that *482 is blameworthy in the respondent's conduct carries its own antidote, for no one can succeed at the bar who comports himself as he has done. Taking into consideration the unquestioned service rendered in the Lee case, the injuries which the respondent suffered at the hands of lawless men while acting as counsel in that case, and the fact that he has already suffered a suspension from the bar of this court for approximately five months, it is believed that a public reprimand will suffice. This will be the judgment of the court." (RE Ades Court Case)

Re Ades sets the precedent that organizations could provide counsel to individuals thus setting up the later defense for the NAACP in the school desegregation cases of the 1960s.

=== Brief political aspirations ===

In 1934 Ades ran for Governor of Maryland on the Communist Party ticket and received less than 8,000 votes.&lt;ref&gt;"Bernard Ades Promises Something". The Afro American. 13 October 1934. Retrieved 1 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the support of the African American community,&lt;ref&gt;"Bernard Ades to Speak at Forum" (November 24, 1934). ''Baltimore Afro-American''. Retrieved 1 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; he lost by a significant margin.

=== Military volunteer ===
On February 20, 1937 Ades sailed to [[Spain]] on the [[Ile de France]] to join in the [[Spanish Civil War]] on the side of the [[Loyalists]]. Later he was commissioned as a [[First Lieutenant]] and served as Company [[Commissar]] in the [[Lincoln Brigade]] which was part of a volunteer based military organization known as the [[International Brigades]] who were dedicated to fighting [[fascism]].  He fought in the battles of [[Brunete]], Villanueva, Pardillo and at Fuentes de Ebro. He returned to the United States on September 30, 1937 aboard the [[SS Normandie]] .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bernard Ades|url=http://edit.alba-valb.org/volunteers/bernard-ades|website=The Abraham Lincoln Brigade Archives|publisher=Plone CMS|accessdate=1 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Later years===
After returning to the United States, Ades was employed as an auditor with the [[Federal Housing Authority]] by 1940. Following his exposure by [[Congressman]] Del’Assandro of Baltimore for being a Communist, he was forced to resign in 1941 and was placed on [[J. Edgar Hoover]]’s list for security detention in case of war.

In 1941 New York State certified Ades as a Public Accountant&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Anderson|first1=Joseph Felipe|title=Freedom of Association, the Communist Party, and the Hollywood Ten: The Forgotten First Amendment Legacy of Charles Hamilton Houston|journal=McGeorge Law Review|date=2009|volume= 40|pages=25–39}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he practiced out of offices at 505 Fifth Avenue, New York, NY. His clients included ''Our World'' magazine (published by his best friend [[John P. Davis]]), [[United Electrical Workers]], the American Soviet Trading Organization (AMTORG), and the [[Communist Party of the United States of America]] as well as a slew of smaller left wing organizations.

Active in the Bronx Reform Democrats Ades served as a delegate to the [[New York State Constitutional Convention]].  He opposed the war in [[Vietnam]], participated in the marches on Washington against it and helped start the [[Dump Johnson movement]] in the Bronx.

In 1940, the FBI began their surveillance of Ades which only ceased when he entered Isabella House, a nursing home, in 1979. He died there and was buried in Baltimore Hebrew Congregation Cemetery, 2100 Belair Road, Maryland.

=== Personal ===
An early marriage was dissolved by divorce. In 1935 Ades married Mary Ethel Hechler, also a Communist Party devotee and had two daughters, Janet and Judith. Widowed in 1959 he married Dora Rubinfine Ziebel who predeceased him by four years.

== Documentary ==
“Red Father” is a documentary directed by [[Tova Beck-Friedman]] which explores the life of Ades through the eyes of his daughter Janet. She admires his wisdom, his generosity and his world outlook, and though as a child she thought him larger than life, as an adult she questions his ideology, its implementation and her father's [[Communist]] involvement. Throughout his trial and later tribulations, Ades remained true to his ideals.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8596">'''Beverley Robinson''' (11 January 1721 – 9 April 1792), a wealthy colonist from New York, was a son of the Hon. John Robinson of [[Virginia Colony|Virginia]], who was the President of that colony. He is mostly remembered as the commander of the [[Loyal American Regiment]], a loyalist regiment in the [[American Revolutionary War]] and for his work with the British secret service during the war. After the war he retired to Britain.

== Early life ==
[[File:Map of Philipse Patent (showing the Oblong and Gore).png|thumb|Map of the [[Philipse Patent]] showing the holdings of Philip, Susanna, and [[Roger Morris (British Army officer)|Mary Philipse]]]] Beverley Robinson was born in [[Middlesex County, Virginia]]. He moved to New York and married Susanna Philipse, the middle daughter of [[Frederick Philipse II|Frederick Philipse]], second Lord of [[Philipsburg Manor]].  She had been a possible love interest of [[George Washington]], and owned a one-third share of the [[Philipse Patent]], an immense landed estate on the [[Hudson River]].

By this connection, Mr. Robinson became rich. When the [[American Revolutionary War]] began, he was living upon that portion of the Phillipse estate which had been given to his wife, and there he desired to remain in the quiet enjoyment of country life, and in the management of his large domain. He was opposed to the measures of the Ministry, gave up the use of imported merchandise, and clothed himself and his family in fabrics of domestic manufacture.

== Colonel in American Revolutionary War ==
Robinson was also opposed to the separation of the colonies from England. However, he wished to take no part in the conflict of arms. Before long, however, friends helped to overrule his own judgment, and he entered the military service of the Crown. His standing entitled him to high rank and he was commissioned Colonel of the "[[Loyal American Regiment]]", raised principally in New York, by himself. He also commanded the corps of [[Guides and Pioneers]], which included black Loyalist soldiers from the [[Black Company of Pioneers]]. His sons figured prominently in the selection of officers for the Loyal American Regiment. His son, Beverley, was Lieutenant-Colonel. The regiment, which saw much fighting in the course of the war, figured most prominently in the attack on [[Fort Montgomery (Hudson River)|Fort Montgomery]], NY, on October 6, 1777, when British and Loyalist forces overwhelmed the rebel fort on the Hudson River.

== Involvement with Benedict Arnold ==
[[File:Appletons' Arnold Benedict - Beverley Robinson house.jpg|thumb|Col. Beverley Robinson's house, occupied by Arnold as his headquarters]]
Robinson was also heavily involved in the treason of [[Benedict Arnold]] and it is generally believed that he was acquainted with the traitor's purpose before it was known to [[Henry Clinton (American War of Independence)|Sir Henry Clinton]], or any other person. And it appears certain that Arnold addressed him a letter on the subject of going over to the Royal side, before soliciting the command of [[West Point]]. As the plot matured, he accompanied [[John André]] to Dobb's Ferry to meet Arnold, according to a previous arrangement; but an accident prevented an interview, and both returned to New York. Subsequently, he went up the [[Hudson River]] in the Vulture, for the purpose of furthering the objects in view; but failed in his most material designs. Arnold now sent Smith on board of the Vulture with a letter, which was delivered to Colonel Robinson, and on the faith of which André went on shore. The treacherous Whig had been expected on the ship in person, and it has been said that Robinson was much opposed to André's trusting himself to the honour "of a man who was seeking to betray his country." But the zealous young officer would not listen to the prudent counsel, and determined to embark upon the duty from which he never returned.

On the 23rd of September, 1780, André was captured and on the 26th was conveyed a prisoner to Colonel Robinson's own house, which, with the lands adjacent, had been confiscated by the state, which Arnold had occupied as his headquarters, and of which Washington was then a temporary occupant. After André's trial and conviction, Sir Henry Clinton sent three commissioners to the Whig camp, in the hope of producing a change in the determination of Washington, and of showing André's innocence; to this mission Robinson was attached in the character of a witness. He had previously addressed the Commander-in-Chief on the subject of André's release; and, as he and Washington had been personal friends until political events had produced a separation, he took occasion to speak of their former acquaintance in his letter.

On September 6, 1781, Robinson was not in command of the Loyal American Regiment that accompanied Benedict Arnold in the burning of New London, Connecticut.  His son, Lieut. Colonel Beverly Robinson Jr. commanded it in his place. &lt;ref&gt;The Battle of Groton Heights, page 60-by William Wallace Harris, 1870&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-war years in England and death ==
As [[Loyalists]], the Philipse-Robinson family was not in favor in the new United States. Property belonging to Philipse heirs was forfeited and seized by provincial New York authorities. This included Susanna's share of the Philipse Patent,&lt;ref&gt;The Beginnings of Holy Trinity [http://www.holytrinitypawling.org/hist_files/histbeg.htm] "Tory Beverly Robinson's lands were seized by the commissioners of forfeiture and sold at auction in 1782 to one Joseph Roskrans."&lt;/ref&gt; which was auctioned off by the Commissioners of Forfeiture without compensation to the prior holder&lt;ref&gt;Description of the Abstract of Sales, Commissioners of Forfeiture [http://westchesterarchives.com/ht/muni/wca/forfeitSumm.html] "'Article V of the peace treaty signed by Britain and the United States in Paris on September 3, 1783, insists on 'the restitution of all estates, rights, and properties, which have been confiscated belonging to real British subjects" and to noncombatant loyalists. Tories who fought the United States were to be given one year to reclaim their property and leave the country. Payments were to be made to loyalists whose estates had already been sold. Article VI prohibited any future confiscations."&lt;/ref&gt; in spite of assurances of restitution in the 1783 [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] that Revolutionary representatives signed with the British.&lt;ref&gt;Description of the Abstract of Sales, Commissioners of Forfeiture [http://westchesterarchives.com/ht/muni/wca/forfeitSumm.html] "Many citizens of New York, however, still harbored strong resentment against the loyalists, leading the Provincial Congress to effectively nullify the Treaty of Paris of 1783 by an act of May 12, 1784."&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the war, Colonel Robinson, with a part of his family, went to England. Like many loyalists who moved there, he reportedly felt out of place and unappreciated. He resided at [[Thornbury, South Gloucestershire|Thornbury]], near Bristol, and died there on April 9, 1792, at the age of seventy.

'''BioViva''' is a [[Bainbridge Island, Washington]]-based [[biotechnology]] company developing treatments to slow the [[Senescence|ageing process]] in humans.

== History ==
BioViva was founded in 2015.&lt;ref name="bberg"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=302346686 |title=Company Overview of BioViva USA Inc. |publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]] |accessdate=November 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early 2016, [[Sierra Sciences]] announced that they were working with BioViva to start a new [[medical tourism]]-based venture, BioViva FIJI, on [[Fiji]] and that they will be the first company to use gene therapy to treat biological aging in humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tayag|first1=Yasmin|title=BioViva Plans an Age Reversal Clinic in Fiji as Medical Tourism Gets Weird|url=https://www.inverse.com/article/15895-bioviva-plans-an-age-reversal-clinic-in-fiji-as-medical-tourism-gets-weird|accessdate=24 July 2016|date=22 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; CEO Liz Parrish explained the reason for setting up in Fiji: "The current regulatory authorities have an outdated model that does not accommodate these new technologies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bainbridge|first1=Bill|title='Fountain of youth' clinic proposed for Fiji called into question by Australian expert|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-05-31/proposed-fiji-fountain-of-youth-clinic-meets-with-scepticism/7458984|accessdate=24 July 2016|date=31 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2016, government sources in Fiji denied knowledge of the venture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pratibha|first1=Jyoti|url=http://fijisun.com.fj/2016/06/08/authorities-deny-anti-ageing-clinic-being-set-up-here/|title=Authorities Deny Anti-Ageing Clinic Being Set Up Here|accessdate=31 July 2016|date=8 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

BioViva released data gathered post-therapy in 2016, claiming that independent testing by SpectraCell Laboratories had revealed Parrish's leukocyte [[telomere]] length had been extended from 6.71kb to 7.33kb, an amount they state is equivalent to a reversal of 20 years of telomere attrition. The company also released data suggesting an improvement in insulin sensitivity, an increase in muscle mass, a more favourable blood lipid profile and a reduction in C-reactive protein, a potent marker of inflammation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://bioviva-science.com/blog/2017/3/2/dual-gene-therapy-has-beneficial-effects-on-blood-biomarkers-and-muscle-composition|title=Dual Gene Therapy Has Beneficial Effects On Blood Biomarkers And Muscle Composition|work=BioViva USA Inc™|access-date=2017-03-31|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

BioViva's CEO Liz Parrish appeared on Norwegian television in the program Trygdekontoret to discuss the use of gene and cell therapies to improve health in an aging population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=NRK TV - Se Trygdekontoret|url=https://tv.nrk.no/serie/trygdekontoret/muhh48000416/sesong-12/episode-4|language=no|accessdate=2017-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parrish has also appeared on Australian network ABC's Lateline, discussing BioViva's development of therapies to treat biological ageing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/lateline/content/2016/s4625411.htm|title=Interview: Liz Parrish|date=2017-02-23|access-date=2017-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parrish appeared at WIRED Health 2017 in London to discuss BioViva's testing of gene therapies targeting hallmarks of the ageing process. Appearing in WIRED, Parrish stated, "The company was built essentially to prove these therapies work or not. Remember BioViva is not a research organisation. We are taking things like gene therapies and using them like technology."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/article/elizabeth-parrish-bioviva-gene-therapy|title=Ageing is a disease. Gene therapy could be the 'cure'|last=Medeiros|first=João|work=WIRED UK|access-date=2017-03-31|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Response ==
Parrish's treatment, often labelled as [[self-experimentation]], is highly controversial. As the requirements to progress to human trials had not started, the US [[Food and Drug Administration]] did not authorize Parrish's experiments. Parrish travelled to Colombia for the treatments.&lt;ref name="woman"/&gt;

Some have criticised BioViva's release of data claiming an extension of Parrish's leukocyte telomeres following her therapy, suggesting that the aforementioned extension is within the error change for telomere measurements. Dr. Bradley Johnson, Associate Professor of Pathology and Lab Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania said, "Telomere length measurements typically have low precision, with variation in measurements of around 10 percent, which is in the range of the reported telomere lengthening apparently experienced by Elizabeth Parrish."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/crux/2016/04/29/liz-parrish-is-an-ceo-and-patient-zero/#.WNEvwSbyjDc|title=Liz Parrish Is Patient Zero in Her Own Anti-Aging Experiment - The Crux|date=2016-04-29|work=The Crux|access-date=2017-03-31|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Altering the genetic makeup of humans, or gene therapy, by lengthening telomeres has been described as dangerous, as the ageing process is poorly understood. The telomeres' function is to restrict the number of times a cell can divide (thereby multiplying) to suppress cancer. Duncan Baird, a professor of Cancer and Genetics at Cardiff University's School of Medicine states, "Meddling with a fundamentally important tumor-suppressive mechanism that has evolved in long-lived species like ours doesn't strike me as a particularly good idea."&lt;ref name="woman"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Nicola Davis|author2=Dara Mohammadi|title=Can this woman cure ageing with gene therapy?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/jul/24/elizabeth-parrish-gene-therapy-ageing|website=www.theguardian.com|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=1 August 2016|date=24 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Timothy Caulfield, professor in the Faculty of Law and the School of Public Health at the University of Alberta, characterized BioViva's work as '[[pseudoscience]]' and lacking scientific rigor. George M Martin, professor of pathology at the University of Washington had agreed to be an adviser to the company but resigned upon hearing about Parrish's self-experiments.&lt;ref name="woman" /&gt;

Antonio Regalado, reporter for the [[MIT Technology Review]] states, "The experiment seems likely to be remembered as either a new low in medical [[quackery]] or, perhaps, the unlikely start of an era in which naive people receive genetic modifications not just to treat disease, but to [[Anti-aging movement|reverse aging]]."&lt;ref name="MIT"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Regalado|first1=Antonio|title=A Tale of Do-It-Yourself Gene Therapy|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/542371/a-tale-of-do-it-yourself-gene-therapy/|website=www.technologyreview.com|publisher=MIT Technology Review|accessdate=25 July 2016|date=14  October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parrish's decision to be 'patient zero' and test the company's technology on herself in a personalised N=1 study has been both criticised and lauded. Dr. Lawrence Altman, author of "Who Goes First? The Story of Self-Experimentation in Medicine" has said, "N's of 1 have had their value through history, and will. But you're not going to license a drug based on an N-of-1."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.statnews.com/2016/07/07/guinea-pig-biotech-ceo/|title=Biotech executives using themselves as human guinea pigs|date=2016-07-07|website=STAT|access-date=2017-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Science ==
BioViva's technology is based on preclinical research of inhibition of both the enzyme telomerase and myostatin.

Telomerase gene therapy utilizing an adeno-associated virus undertaken by María Blasco's [https://www.cnio.es/ing/grupos/plantillas/curriculum.asp?pag=39 group] at the Spanish National Cancer Research Centre (CNIO), has demonstrated several beneficial effects and an increase in median lifespan of up to 24% in mice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bernardes de Jesus|first=Bruno|last2=Vera|first2=Elsa|last3=Schneeberger|first3=Kerstin|last4=Tejera|first4=Agueda M.|last5=Ayuso|first5=Eduard|last6=Bosch|first6=Fatima|last7=Blasco|first7=Maria A.|date=2012-08-01|title=Telomerase gene therapy in adult and old mice delays aging and increases longevity without increasing cancer|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/emmm.201200245/abstract|journal=EMBO Molecular Medicine|language=en|volume=4|issue=8|pages=691–704|doi=10.1002/emmm.201200245|issn=1757-4684|pmc=3494070|pmid=22585399}}&lt;/ref&gt; Discussing her team's research, Blasco has stated in discussion with [http://www.the-scientist.com/ The Scientist], "We demonstrated that AAV9-Tert gene therapy was sufficient to delay age-related pathologies and extend both median and maximum longevity in mice. Many pathologies were delayed, including cancer. Translating these results to human diseases (telomere syndromes or certain age-related diseases without effective treatments) may be of interest in the context of clinical trials approved by the corresponding regulatory agencies."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/45947/title/First-Data-from-Anti-Aging-Gene-Therapy/|title=First Data from Anti-Aging Gene Therapy {{!}} The Scientist Magazine®|website=The Scientist|access-date=2017-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Myostatin inhibition gene therapy, utilizing the gene follistatin (a known inhibitor of myostatin), has been tested in a phase 1/2 trial on 6 people, for Becker's muscular dystrophy. 4 of the 6 patients showed improvements in walking ability following application of the gene therapy, with some muscle growth especially in response to the higher dosage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mendell|first=Jerry R.|last2=Sahenk|first2=Zarife|last3=Malik|first3=Vinod|last4=Gomez|first4=Ana M.|last5=Flanigan|first5=Kevin M.|last6=Lowes|first6=Linda P.|last7=Alfano|first7=Lindsay N.|last8=Berry|first8=Katherine|last9=Meadows|first9=Eric|date=2015-01-01|title=A phase 1/2a follistatin gene therapy trial for becker muscular dystrophy|journal=Molecular Therapy: The Journal of the American Society of Gene Therapy|volume=23|issue=1|pages=192–201|doi=10.1038/mt.2014.200|issn=1525-0024|pmc=4426808|pmid=25322757}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''José Bruno Carranza Ramírez''' (October 5, 1822 – January 25, 1891) was briefly [[President]] of [[Costa Rica]] (albeit with the title ''Temporary Head of the Republic'') in 1870. Bruno Carranza came to power in the [[coup d'état]] of 27 April 1870  that deposed President [[Jesús Jiménez Zamora|Jesús Jiménez]]. He resigned three months later.

His parents were [[Miguel Carranza Fernández]] (Vice-Head of State between 1838 and 1841) and Joaquina Ramírez y García. In 1847 he married [[Gerónima Montealegre]], sister of President [[José María Montealegre Fernández]]. His great-great-granddaughter is actress [[Madeleine Stowe]].

== Studies and Career ==

Carranza graduated in medicine from the University of San Carlos in [[Guatemala]].

After returning to Costa Rica he practiced both privately and in the State-run Hospital San Juan de Dios. He was inspector general of vaccinations and proto-medicines. He served in [[Nicaragua]] as a military doctor during the 1856 Campaign against [[William Walker (filibuster)|William Walker]], but had to return almost immediately due to a Costa Rican Army retreat and a [[cholera]] epidemic.

He also worked as a journalist, publishing several newsletters and newspapers such as ''El Álbum'' (''"The Album"'') and ''La Estrella del [[Irazú Volcano National Park|Irazú]]'' (''"The Irazú Star"''). He was also active in other diverse economic and commercial ventures, and among other businesses he owned coffee plantations, a book store, and a boutique. From 1855 to 1859 he was awarded the administration of the [[Guaro (drink)|National Liquor Factory]] and thus became the only official State supplier of alcohol.

== Public office ==

He was deputy for several periods under the [[Juan Rafael Mora Porras|Mora Porras]] administration. He became the Costa Rican ambassador to [[El Salvador]] in 1857. He represented San José in the Constituent Assembly of 1869, although he stepped down soon after his election. Politically he was considered a liberal, sometimes even [[anti-clerical]], and was exiled more than once because of his political beliefs.

The coup d'état of 27 April 1870 turned him into the head of state with the official title of ''Temporary Head of the Republic'' (in Spanish ''Jefe Provisorio de la República''). During his administration the district of [[Limón]] was created, laws outlining personal and religious freedoms were dictated, and a law of guarantees was passed which for the first time in the country's history banned the [[death penalty]]. The so-called ''Secretarías de Estado'' were also regulated and new elections for a Constituent Assembly were held.

The principal figure in his administration and author of his policies towards external relations and freedom of creed was the Guatemalan lawyer [[Lorenzo Montúfar y Rivera]], noted advocated of anti-clericalism. Other notable Secretaries of State during his time in office were [[Joaquín Lizano Gutiérrez]] (government, police, justice, agriculture, and industry), [[Rafael Gallegos Sáenz]] (housing and commerce), and [[Buenaventura Carazo Alvarado]] (war, navy, and public works).

Due to differences with [[Tomás Guardia Gutiérrez]] on August 8, 1870 he presented his resignation to the Constituent Assembly, which was accepted the next day on August 9. General Guardia succeeded him.

He was later a member of the Grand National Counsel and Plenipotentiary Minister of Costa Rica in El Salvador, where he signed the Carranza-Arbizú Accord.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11289">'''Business process interoperability''' ('''BPI''') is a property referring to the ability of diverse [[business process]]es to work together, to so called "inter-operate".&lt;ref&gt;Christina Tsagkani (2005) "[http://cgi.di.uoa.gr/~s3lab/papers/2005/iesa2005.pdf Inter-Organisational Collaboration on the Process Layer]". ''Proceedings of the IFIP/ACM SIGAPP INTEROP-ESA conference, February 23–25, Geneva, Switzerland'', Springer Science publisher. Tsagkani states:
:''Business process interoperability is characterised as the ability of business activities of one party to interact with those of another party, whether or not these business activities belong to different units of the same business or to different businesses''.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a state that exists when a [[business process]] can meet a specific objective [[automation|automatically]] utilizing essential human labor only. Typically, BPI is present when a process conforms to [[standardization|standards]] that enable it to achieve its objective regardless of ownership, location, make, version or design of the [[computer system]]s used.

== Overview ==
The main attraction of BPI is that a business process can start and finish at any point worldwide regardless of the types of hardware and software required to automate it. Because of its capacity to offload human "mind" labor, BPI is considered by many as the final stage in the evolution of [[business]] computing.  BPI's twin criteria of ''specific objective'' and ''essential human labor'' are both subjective.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

The objectives of BPI vary, but tend to fall into the following categories:
* Enable end-to-end [[Straight Through Processing|straight-through processing ("STP")]] by interconnecting data and procedures trapped in [[information silo]]s
* Let systems and products work with other systems or products without special effort on the part of the customer
* Increase [[productivity (economics)|productivity]] by automating human labor
* Eliminate redundant [[business process]]es and data replications
* Minimize errors inherent in manual processes
* Introduce mainstream enterprise [[Software as a service|software-as-a-service]]
* Give top managers a practical means of [[Regulation|overseeing]] processes used to run [[business operations]]
* Encourage development of [[innovation|innovative]] Internet-based business processes
* Place emphasis on business processes rather than on the systems required to operate them  
* Strengthen [[security]] by eliminating gaps among [[Proprietary software|proprietary]] software systems
* Improve [[privacy]] by giving users complete control over their data
* Enable realtime enterprise [[scenario]]s and [[forecasting|forecast]]s

Business process [[interoperability]] is limited to enterprise software [[system]]s in which functions are designed to work together, such as a payroll module and a general ledger module that are part of the same  program suite, and in controlled software environments that use [[Electronic Data Interchange|EDI]]. Interoperability is also present between incompatible systems where [[middleware]] has been applied. In each of these cases, however, the processes seldom meet the test of BPI because they are constrained by [[information silo]]s and the systems' inability to freely communicate among each other.

== History ==
The term "Business process interoperability" (BPI) was coined in the late 1990s, mostly in connection with the [[value chain]] in [[electronic commerce]].&lt;ref&gt;Asuman Doğaç ed. (1998) ''Workflow Management Systems and Interoperability''. Springer-Verlag New York.
Dimitrios Georgakopoulos and Aphrodite Tsalgatidou discussed the
: ''...need to manage the business process lifecycle effectively, i.e., to perform business process management''. and ways ''how interoperability between WFMSs and BPMTs can provide complete support for the management of the entire business process lifecycle.''. (p. 358)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Derek Leebaert (1999) ''The Future of the Electronic Marketplace''. p. 297. Leebaert acknowledged that
: ''Achieving a robust electronic marketplace will require new concepts that promote "business process interoperability."''&lt;/ref&gt; BPI has been utilized in promotional materials by various companies, and appears as a subject of research at organizations concerned with [[Ontology (computer science)|computer science ontologies]].

Despite the attention it has received, business process interoperability has not been applied outside of limited information system environments. A possible reason is that BPI requires universal conformance to standards so that a business process can start and finish at any point worldwide. The standards themselves are fairly straightforward—organizations use a finite set of shared processes to manage most of their operations. Bringing enterprises together to create and adopt the standards is another matter entirely. The world of management systems is, after all, characterized by [[information silo]]s. Moving away from silos requires organizations to deal with cultural issues such as ownership and sharing of processes and data, competitive forces and security, not to mention the effect of automation on their work forces.

While the timetable or adoption of BPI cannot be predicted, it remains a subject of interest in organizations and [[think tank]]s alike.

== Testing for BPI ==
To test for BPI, an organization analyzes a business process to determine if it can meet its ''specific objective'' utilizing ''essential human labor'' only.

The ''specific objective'' must be clearly defined from start to finish. Start and finish are highly subjective, however. In one organization, a process may start when a customer orders a product and finish when the product is delivered to the customer. In another organization, the same process may be preceded with product manufacture and distribution, and may be followed by management of after-sale warranty and repairs.

''Essential human labor'' includes:
*Tasks that must be performed by people because no practical means of automation is available. Examples include fighting a fire, driving a bus and preparing a meal.
*Tasks that, in the opinion of management, are more effectively performed by people. Examples include answering a telephone call with a human voice and offering investment advice in person.
*Tasks where the cost of automation is greater than the cost of human labor.

To qualify for BPI, every process task must be taken into account from start to finish, including the labor that falls between the cracks created by incompatible software applications, such as gathering data from one system and re-inputting it in another, and preparing reports that include data from disparate systems. The process must flow uninterrupted regardless of the underlying computerized systems used. If non-essential human labor exists at any point, the process fails the test of BPI.

== Achieving BPI ==
To assure that [[business process]]es can meet their specific objectives [[automation|automatically]] utilizing essential human labor only, BPI takes a “service-oriented architecture“ ([[Service-oriented architecture|SOA]]) approach, which focuses on the processes rather than on the technologies required to automate them. A widely used SOA is an effective way to address the problems caused by any [[disparate system]] that is the heart of each [[information silo]].

SOA makes practical sense because organizations cannot be expected to replace or modify their current enterprise software to achieve BPI, regardless of the benefits involved. Many workers' jobs are built around the applications they use, and most organizations have sizable investments in their current information infrastructures which are so complex that even the smallest modification can be very costly, time-consuming and disruptive. Even if software makers were to unite and conform their products to a single set of standards, the problem would not be solved. Besides software from well-known manufacturers, organizations use a great many [[Legacy systems|legacy software systems]], custom applications, manual procedures and paper forms. Without SOA, streamlining such a huge number of disparate internal processes so that they interoperate across the entire global enterprise spectrum is simply out of the question.

To create an SOA for widespread use, BPI relies on a centralized database [[wikt:repository|repository]] containing shared data and procedures common to applications in every industry and geographical area. In essence, the repository serves as a top application layer, enabling organizations to export their data to its distributed database and obtain the programs they need by simply logging on via a [[web portal|portal]]. To assure [[security]] and commercial neutrality, the repository conforms to standards promulgated by the community of BPI [[Project stakeholder|stakeholders]].

Organizations and [[interest group]]s that wish to achieve business process interoperability begin by establishing one or more [[BPI Initiative|BPI initiatives]].

'''Business process re-engineering''' ('''BPR''') is a [[Strategic management|business management strategy]], originally pioneered in the early 1990s, focusing on the analysis and design of [[workflow]]s and [[business process]]es within an organization. BPR aimed to help [[organization]]s fundamentally rethink how they do their work in order to dramatically improve [[customer service]], cut [[operational costs]], and become world-class [[competitor]]s.&lt;ref name="GAO97"&gt;[http://www.gao.gov/assets/80/76302.pdf Business Process Re-engineering Assessment Guide], United States General Accounting Office, May 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

BPR seeks to help companies radically restructure their organizations by focusing on the ground-up design of their business processes. According to early BPR proponent Thomas Davenport (1990), a business process is a set of logically related tasks performed to achieve a defined business outcome. Re-engineering emphasized a [[Holism|holistic]] focus on business objectives and how processes related to them, encouraging full-scale recreation of processes rather than iterative optimization of sub-processes.&lt;ref name="GAO97"/&gt;

Business process reengineering is also known as business process redesign, [[business transformation]], or business process change management.

== Overview ==
[[Image:Reengineering guidence.jpg|thumb|240px|Reengineering guidance and relationship of mission and work processes to information technology.]]
Business process reengineering (BPR) is the practice of rethinking and redesigning the way work is done to better support an organization's [[Mission statement|mission]] and reduce [[cost]]s. Organizations reengineer two key areas of their businesses. First, they use modern technology to enhance data dissemination and decision-making processes. Then, they alter functional organizations to form functional teams.{{cn|date=October 2018}} Reengineering starts with a high-level assessment of the organization's mission, strategic goals, and [[requirements|customer needs]]. Basic questions are asked, such as "Does our mission need to be redefined? Are our strategic goals aligned with our mission? Who are our customers?" An organization may find that it is operating on questionable assumptions, particularly in terms of the wants and needs of its customers. Only after the organization rethinks what it should be doing, does it go on to decide how best to do it.&lt;ref name="GAO97"/&gt;

Within the [[Conceptual framework|framework]] of this basic assessment of mission and goals, re-engineering focuses on the organization's business processes—the steps and procedures that govern how resources are used to create [[Product (business)|product]]s and [[Service (economics)|service]]s that meet the needs of particular [[customer]]s or [[Market (economics)|market]]s. As a structured ordering of work steps across time and place, a business process can be decomposed into specific activities, measured, modeled, and improved. It can also be completely redesigned or eliminated altogether. Re-engineering identifies, analyzes, and re-designs an organization's core business processes with the aim of achieving dramatic improvements in critical performance measures, such as cost, quality, service, and speed.&lt;ref name="GAO97"/&gt;

Re-engineering recognizes that an organization's [[business process]]es are usually fragmented into sub-processes and tasks that are carried out by several specialized functional areas within the organization. Often, no one is responsible for the overall performance of the entire process. Reengineering maintains that optimizing the performance of sub-processes can result in some benefits, but cannot yield dramatic improvements if the process itself is fundamentally inefficient and outmoded. For that reason, re-engineering focuses on re-designing the process as a whole in order to achieve the greatest possible benefits to the organization and their customers. This drive for realizing dramatic improvements by fundamentally re-thinking how the organization's work should be done distinguishes the re-engineering from process improvement efforts that focus on functional or incremental improvement.&lt;ref name="GAO97"/&gt;

== History ==
Business process reengineering (BPR) began as a private sector technique to help [[organization]]s fundamentally rethink how they do their work in order to dramatically improve [[customer service]], cut [[operational costs]], and become world-class [[competitor]]s. A key stimulus for re-engineering has been the continuing development and deployment of sophisticated [[information system]]s and [[Computer network|networks]]. Leading organizations are becoming bolder in using this technology to support innovative business processes, rather than refining current ways of doing work.&lt;ref name="GAO97"/&gt;

=== Reengineering Work: Don't Automate, Obliterate, 1990 ===
In 1990, [[Michael Martin Hammer|Michael Hammer]], a former professor of computer science at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT), published the article "Reengineering Work: Don't Automate, Obliterate" in the ''[[Harvard Business Review]]'', in which he claimed that the major challenge for managers is to obliterate forms of work that do not add value, rather than using technology for automating it.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Hammer, [http://hbr.org/1990/07/reengineering-work-dont-automate-obliterate "Reengineering Work: Don’t Automate, Obliterate"], ''Hardvard Business Review'', July, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; This statement implicitly accused managers of having focused on the wrong issues, namely that technology in general, and more specifically information technology, has been used primarily for automating existing processes rather than using it as an enabler for making non-value adding work obsolete.

Hammer's claim was simple: Most of the work being done does not add any value for customers, and this work should be removed, not accelerated through automation. Instead, companies should reconsider their inability to satisfy customer needs, and their insufficient cost structure{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}. Even well-established management thinkers, such as [[Peter Drucker]]  and [[Tom Peters]], were accepting and advocating BPR as a new tool for (re-)achieving success in a dynamic world.&lt;ref name="Forbes93"&gt;[http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1993/08/23/78237/index.htm Forbes: Reengineering, The Hot New Managing Tool], August 23, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; During the following years, a fast-growing number of publications, books as well as journal articles, were dedicated to BPR, and many consulting firms embarked on this trend and developed BPR methods. However, the critics were fast to claim that BPR was a way to dehumanize the work place, increase managerial control, and to justify [[Layoff|downsizing]], i.e. major reductions of the work force,&lt;ref&gt;(Greenbaum 1995, Industry Week 1994)&lt;/ref&gt; and a rebirth of [[Taylorism]] under a different label.

Despite this critique, reengineering was adopted at an accelerating pace and by 1993, as many as 60% of the [[Fortune 500]] companies claimed to either have initiated reengineering efforts, or to have plans to do so.&lt;ref name="AAAI"&gt;[http://aaaipress.org/ojs/index.php/aimagazine/article/download/1113/1031 Hamscher, Walter: "AI in Business-Process Reengineering"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140311194739/http://aaaipress.org/ojs/index.php/aimagazine/article/download/1113/1031|date=11 March 2014}}, AI Magazine Volume 15 Number 4, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; This trend was fueled by the fast adoption of BPR by the consulting industry, but also by the study ''Made in America'',&lt;ref&gt;Michael L. Dertouzos, Robert M. Solow and Richard K. Lester (1989) ''Made In America: Regaining the Productive Edge''. MIT press.&lt;/ref&gt; conducted by MIT, that showed how companies in many US industries had lagged behind their foreign counterparts in terms of competitiveness, [[time-to-market]] and [[productivity]].

=== Development after 1995 ===
With the publication of critiques in 1995 and 1996 by some{{Who|date=August 2016}} of the early BPR proponents{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}, coupled with abuses and misuses of the concept by others, the reengineering fervor in the U.S. began to wane. Since then, considering business processes as a starting point for business analysis and redesign has become a widely accepted approach and is a standard part of the change methodology portfolio, but is typically performed in a less radical way than originally proposed.

More recently, the concept of [[Business Process Management]] (BPM) has gained major attention in the corporate world and can be considered a successor to the BPR wave of the 1990s, as it is evenly driven by a striving for process efficiency supported by information technology. Equivalently to the critique brought forward against BPR, BPM is now accused{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} of focusing on technology and disregarding the people aspects of change.

== Topics ==
The most notable definitions of reengineering are:
* "... the fundamental rethinking and radical redesign of business processes to achieve dramatic improvements in critical contemporary modern measures of performance, such as cost, quality, service, and speed."&lt;ref&gt;Hammer and Champy (1993)&lt;/ref&gt;
* "encompasses the envisioning of new work strategies, the actual process design activity, and the implementation of the change in all its complex technological, human, and organizational dimensions."&lt;ref name="dav93"&gt;[[Thomas H. Davenport]] (1993)&lt;/ref&gt;

BPR is different from other approaches to organization development (OD), especially the continuous improvement or TQM movement, by virtue of its aim for fundamental and radical change rather than iterative improvement.&lt;ref&gt;Johansson ''et al.'' (1993):  "Business Process Reengineering, although a close relative, seeks radical rather than merely continuous improvement. It escalates the efforts of JIT and TQM to make process orientation a strategic tool and a core competence of the organization. BPR concentrates on core business processes, and uses the specific techniques within the JIT and TQM ”toolboxes” as enablers, while broadening the process vision."&lt;/ref&gt; In order to achieve the major improvements BPR is seeking for, the change of structural organizational variables, and other ways of managing and performing work is often considered insufficient. For being able to reap the achievable benefits fully, the use of [[information technology]] (IT) is conceived as a major contributing factor. While IT traditionally has been used for supporting the existing business functions, i.e. it was used for increasing organizational efficiency, it now plays a role as enabler of new organizational forms, and patterns of collaboration within and between organizations{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}.

BPR derives its existence from different disciplines, and four major areas can be identified as being subjected to change in BPR – organization, technology, strategy, and people – where a process view is used as common framework for considering these dimensions.

Business strategy is the primary driver of BPR initiatives and the other dimensions are governed by strategy's encompassing role. The organization dimension reflects the structural elements of the company, such as hierarchical levels, the composition of organizational units, and the distribution of work between them{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}. Technology is concerned with the use of computer systems and other forms of [[communication technology]] in the business. In BPR, information technology is generally considered to act as enabler of new forms of organizing and collaborating, rather than supporting existing business functions. The people / [[human resources]] dimension deals with aspects such as education, training, motivation and reward systems. The concept of business processes – interrelated activities aiming at creating a value added output to a customer – is the basic underlying idea of BPR. These processes are characterized by a number of attributes: Process ownership, customer focus, value adding, and cross-functionality.

===The role of information technology===
Information technology (IT) has historically played an important role in the reengineering concept.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/aca0b8dc-dfc0-11df-bed9-00144feabdc0.html#axzz1VySiR5f7 Business efficiency: IT can help paint a bigger picture, Financial Times, featuring Ian Manocha, Lynne Munns and Andy Cross]&lt;/ref&gt; It is regarded by some as a major enabler for new forms of working and collaborating within an organization and across organizational borders{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}.

BPR literature&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Hammer &amp; Champy (1993)&lt;/ref&gt; identified several so called ''disruptive technologies'' that were supposed to challenge traditional wisdom about how work should be performed.
* Shared databases, making information available at many places  
* Expert systems, allowing generalists to perform specialist tasks
* Telecommunication networks, allowing organizations to be centralized and decentralized at the same time
* Decision-support tools, allowing decision-making to be a part of everybody's job
* [[Wireless data communication]] and [[portable computer]]s, allowing field personnel to work office independent
* Interactive videodisk, to get in immediate contact with potential buyers
* Automatic identification and tracking, allowing things to tell where they are, instead of requiring to be found
* High performance computing, allowing on-the-fly planning and revisioning

In the mid-1990s, especially workflow management systems were considered a significant contributor to improved process efficiency. Also, ERP ([[enterprise resource planning]]) vendors, such as [[SAP AG|SAP]], [[JD Edwards]], Oracle, [[PeopleSoft]], positioned their solutions as vehicles for business process redesign and improvement.

===Research and methodology ===
[[Image:Bpr1.png|thumb|240px|Model based on PRLC approach]]
Although the labels and steps differ slightly, the early methodologies that were rooted in IT-centric BPR solutions share many of the same basic principles and elements. The following outline is one such model, based on the PRLC (Process Reengineering Life Cycle) approach developed by Guha.&lt;ref&gt;Guha et al. (1993)&lt;/ref&gt; Simplified schematic outline of using a business process approach, exemplified for pharmaceutical R&amp;D
# Structural organization with functional units
# Introduction of New Product Development as cross-functional process
# Re-structuring and streamlining activities, removal of non-value adding tasks

Benefiting from lessons learned from the early adopters, some BPR practitioners advocated a change in emphasis to a customer-centric, as opposed to an IT-centric, methodology.  One such methodology, that also incorporated a Risk and Impact Assessment to account for the effect that BPR can have on jobs and operations, was described by Lon Roberts (1994).&lt;ref&gt;Lon Roberts (1994) ''Process reengineering: the key to achieving breakthrough success''.&lt;/ref&gt; Roberts also stressed the use of change management tools to proactively address resistance to change—a factor linked to the demise of many reengineering initiatives that looked good on the drawing board.

Some items to use on a process analysis checklist are: Reduce handoffs, Centralize data, Reduce delays, Free resources faster, Combine similar activities. Also within the management consulting industry, a significant number of methodological approaches have been developed.&lt;ref&gt;A set of short papers, outlining and comparing some of them can be found here, followed by some guidelines for companies considering to contract a consultancy for a BPR initiative:

=== Framework ===
An easy to follow seven step INSPIRE framework is developed by Bhudeb Chakravarti which can be followed by any Process Analyst to perform BPR. The seven steps of the framework are '''Initiate''' a new process reengineering project and prepare a business case for the same; '''Negotiate''' with senior management to get approval to start the process reengineering project; '''Select''' the key processes that need to be reengineered; '''Plan''' the process reengineering activities; '''Investigate''' the processes to analyze the problem areas; '''Redesign''' the selected processes to improve the performance and '''Ensure''' the successful implementation of redesigned processes through proper monitoring and evaluation.

== Factors for success and failure ==
{{tone|date=February 2014}}
Factors that are important to BPR success include:

# BPR team composition.
# Business needs analysis.
# Adequate IT infrastructure.
# Effective [[change management]]. 
# Ongoing continuous improvement

The aspects of a BPM effort that are modified include organizational structures, management systems, employee responsibilities and performance measurements, incentive systems, skills development, and the use of IT. BPR can potentially affect every aspect of how business is conducted today.  Wholesale changes can cause results ranging from enviable success to complete failure.

If successful, a BPM initiative can result in improved quality, customer service, and competitiveness, as well as reductions in cost or cycle time. However, 50-70% of reengineering projects are either failures or do not achieve significant benefit.&lt;ref&gt;Asian Productivity Organization: Business Process re-engineering. http://www.apo-tokyo.org/productivity/pmtt_016.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many reasons for sub-optimal business processes which include:

# One department may be optimized at the expense of another
# Lack of time to focus on improving business process
# Lack of recognition of the extent of the problem
# Lack of training
# People involved use the best tool they have at their disposal which is usually [[Microsoft Excel|Excel]] to fix problems
# Inadequate infrastructure
# Overly bureaucratic processes
# Lack of motivation

Many unsuccessful BPR attempts may have been due to the confusion surrounding BPR, and how it should be performed.  Organizations were well aware that changes needed to be made, but did not know which areas to change or how to change them.  As a result, process reengineering is a management concept that has been formed by trial and error or, in other words, practical experience. As more and more businesses reengineer their processes, knowledge of what caused the successes or failures is becoming apparent.&lt;ref name="Covert, 1997"&gt;(Covert, 1997)&lt;/ref&gt;  To reap lasting benefits, companies must be willing to examine how strategy and reengineering complement each other by learning to quantify strategy in terms of cost, milestones, and timetables, by accepting ownership of the strategy throughout the organization, by assessing the organization’s current capabilities and process realistically, and by linking strategy to the budgeting process.  Otherwise, BPR is only a short-term efficiency exercise.&lt;ref&gt;(Berman, 1994)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Organization-wide commitment ===
Major changes to business processes have a direct effect on processes, technology, job roles, and workplace culture.  Significant changes to even one of those areas require resources, money, and leadership.  Changing them simultaneously is an extraordinary task.&lt;ref name="Covert, 1997"/&gt; Like any large and complex undertaking, implementing reengineering requires the talents and energies of a broad spectrum of experts.  Since BPR can involve multiple areas within the organization, it is important to get support from all affected departments. Through the involvement of selected department members, the organization can gain valuable input before a process is implemented; a step which promotes both the cooperation and the vital acceptance of the reengineered process by all segments of the organization.

Getting enterprise wide commitment involves the following: top management sponsorship, bottom-up buy-in from process users, dedicated BPR team, and budget allocation for the total solution with measures to demonstrate value. Before any BPR project can be implemented successfully, there must be a commitment to the project by the management of the organization, and strong leadership must be provided.&lt;ref name="Campbell &amp; Kleiner, 1997"&gt;(Campbell &amp; Kleiner, 1997)&lt;/ref&gt; Reengineering efforts can by no means be exercised without a company-wide commitment to the goals.  However, top management commitment is imperative for success.&lt;ref name="Dooley &amp; Johnson, 2001"&gt;(Dooley &amp; Johnson, 2001)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(Jackson, 1997)&lt;/ref&gt;  Top management must recognize the need for change, develop a complete understanding of what BPR is, and plan how to achieve it.&lt;ref name="Motwani, et al., 1998"&gt;(Motwani, et al., 1998)&lt;/ref&gt;

Leadership has to be effective, strong, visible, and creative in thinking and understanding in order to provide a clear [[company vision|vision]].&lt;ref name="Al-Mashari &amp; Zairi, 1999"&gt;(Al-Mashari &amp; Zairi, 1999)&lt;/ref&gt;  Convincing every affected group within the organization of the need for BPR is a key step in successfully implementing a process.  By informing all affected groups at every stage, and emphasizing the positive end results of the reengineering process, it is possible to minimize resistance to change and increase the odds for success. The ultimate success of BPR depends on the strong, consistent, and continuous involvement of all departmental levels within the organization.&lt;ref&gt;(King, 1994)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Team composition ===
Once organization-wide commitment has been secured from all departments involved in the reengineering effort and at different levels, the critical step of selecting a BPR team must be taken. This team will form the nucleus of the BPR effort, make key decisions and recommendations, and help communicate the details and benefits of the BPR program to the entire organization. The determinants of an effective BPR team may be summarized as follows: 
* competency of the members of the team, their motivation,&lt;ref&gt;(Rastogi, 1994)&lt;/ref&gt; 
* their credibility within the organization and their creativity,&lt;ref&gt;(Barrett, 1994)&lt;/ref&gt; 
* team empowerment, training of members in process mapping and brainstorming techniques,&lt;ref name="Carr, 1993"&gt;(Carr, 1993)&lt;/ref&gt; 
* effective team leadership,&lt;ref&gt;(Berrington &amp; Oblich, 1995)&lt;/ref&gt; 
* proper organization of the team,&lt;ref&gt;(Guha, et al., 1993)&lt;/ref&gt; 
* complementary skills among team members, adequate size, interchangeable accountability, clarity of work approach, and 
* specificity of goals.&lt;ref&gt;(Katzenbach &amp; Smith, 1993)&lt;/ref&gt;

The most effective BPR teams include active representatives from the following work groups: top management, business area responsible for the process being addressed, technology groups, finance, and members of all ultimate process users’ groups. Team members who are selected from each work group within the organization will affect the outcome of the reengineered process according to their desired requirements.  The BPR team should be mixed in depth and knowledge.  For example, it may include members with the following characteristics:

* Members who do not know the process at all.
* Members who know the process inside-out.
* Customers, if possible.
* Members representing affected departments.
* One or two members of the best, brightest, passionate, and committed technology experts.
* Members from outside of the organization&lt;ref name="Dooley &amp; Johnson, 2001"/&gt;

Moreover, Covert (1997) recommends that in order to have an effective BPR team, it must be kept under ten players.  If the organization fails to keep the team at a manageable size, the entire process will be much more difficult to execute efficiently and effectively.  The efforts of the team must be focused on identifying breakthrough opportunities and designing new work steps or processes that will create quantum gains and competitive advantage.&lt;ref name="Motwani, et al., 1998"/&gt;

=== Business needs analysis ===
Another important factor in the success of any BPR effort is performing a thorough business needs analysis.  Too often, BPR teams jump directly into the technology without first assessing the current processes of the organization and determining what exactly needs reengineering. In this analysis phase, a series of sessions should be held with process owners and stakeholders, regarding the need and strategy for BPR.  These sessions build a consensus as to the vision of the ideal business process. They help identify essential goals for BPR within each department and then collectively define objectives for how the project will affect each work group or department on individual basis and the business organization as a whole. The idea of these sessions is to conceptualize the ideal business process for the organization and build a business process model.  Those items that seem unnecessary or unrealistic may be eliminated or modified later on in the diagnosing stage of the BPR project. It is important to acknowledge and evaluate all ideas in order to make all participants feel that they are a part of this important and crucial process.  Results of these meetings will help formulate the basic plan for the project.

This plan includes the following: 
* identifying specific problem areas, 
* solidifying particular goals, and 
* defining business objectives.  
The business needs analysis contributes tremendously to the re-engineering effort by helping the BPR team to prioritize and determine where it should focus its improvements efforts.&lt;ref name="Dooley &amp; Johnson, 2001"/&gt;

The business needs analysis also helps in relating the BPR project goals back to key business objectives and the overall strategic direction for the organization.  This linkage should show the thread from the top to the bottom of the organization, so each person can easily connect the overall business direction with the re-engineering effort. This alignment must be demonstrated from the perspective of financial performance, customer service, associate value, and the vision for the organization.&lt;ref name="Covert, 1997"/&gt;  Developing a business vision and process objectives relies, on the one hand, on a clear understanding of organizational strengths, weaknesses, and market structure, and on the other, on awareness and knowledge about innovative activities undertaken by competitors and other organizations.&lt;ref name="Vakola &amp; Rezgui, 2000"&gt;(Vakola &amp; Rezgui, 2000)&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
BPR projects that are not in alignment with the organization’s strategic direction can be counterproductive.  There is always a possibility that an organization may make significant investments in an area that is not a core competency for the company and later outsource this capability.  Such reengineering initiatives are wasteful and steal resources from other strategic projects. Moreover, without strategic alignment, the organization’s key stakeholders and sponsors may find themselves unable to provide the level of support the organization needs in terms of resources, especially if there are other more critical projects to the future of the business, and are more aligned with the strategic direction.&lt;ref name="Covert, 1997"/&gt;

=== Adequate IT infrastructure ===
Researchers consider adequate [[IT infrastructure]] reassessment and composition as a vital factor in successful BPR implementation.&lt;ref name="Al-Mashari &amp; Zairi, 1999"/&gt;  Hammer (1990) prescribes the use of IT to challenge the assumptions inherent in the work process that have existed since long before the advent of modern computer and communications technology.&lt;ref&gt;(Malhotra, 1998)&lt;/ref&gt; Factors related to IT infrastructure have been increasingly considered by many researchers and practitioners as a vital component of successful BPR efforts.&lt;ref name="Ross, 1998"&gt;(Ross, 1998)&lt;/ref&gt;  
* Effective alignment of IT infrastructure and BPR strategy, 
* building an effective IT infrastructure,
* adequate IT infrastructure investment decision, 
* adequate measurement of IT infrastructure effectiveness,
* proper information systems (IS) integration, 
* effective reengineering of legacy IS, 
* increasing IT function competency, and 
* effective use of software tools are the most important factors that contribute to the success of BPR projects.

These are vital factors that contribute to building an effective IT infrastructure for business processes.&lt;ref name="Al-Mashari &amp; Zairi, 1999"/&gt;  BPR must be accompanied by strategic planning which addresses leveraging IT as a competitive tool.&lt;ref name="Weicher, et al., 1995"&gt;(Weicher, et al., 1995)&lt;/ref&gt; An IT infrastructure is made up of physical assets, intellectual assets, shared services,&lt;ref&gt;(Broadbent &amp; Weill, 1997)&lt;/ref&gt; and their linkages.&lt;ref name="Kayworth, et al., 1997"&gt;(Kayworth, et al., 1997)&lt;/ref&gt; The way in which the IT infrastructure components are composed and their linkages determines the extent to which information resources can be delivered.  An effective IT infrastructure composition process follows a top-down approach, beginning with business strategy and IS strategy and passing through designs of data, systems, and computer architecture.&lt;ref&gt;(Malhotra, 1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

Linkages between the IT infrastructure components, as well as descriptions of their contexts of interaction, are important for ensuring integrity and consistency among the IT infrastructure components.&lt;ref name="Ross, 1998"/&gt;  Furthermore, IT standards have a major role in reconciling various infrastructure components to provide shared IT services that are of a certain degree of effectiveness to support business process applications, as well as to guide the process of acquiring, managing, and utilizing IT assets.&lt;ref name="Kayworth, et al., 1997"/&gt; The IT infrastructure shared services and the human IT infrastructure components, in terms of their responsibilities and their needed expertise, are both vital to the process of the IT infrastructure composition.  IT strategic alignment is approached through the process of integration between business and IT strategies, as well as between IT and organizational infrastructures.&lt;ref name="Al-Mashari &amp; Zairi, 1999"/&gt;

Most analysts view BPR and IT as irrevocably linked.  Walmart, for example, would not have been able to reengineer the processes used to procure and distribute mass-market retail goods without IT.  Ford was able to decrease its headcount in the procurement department by 75 percent by using IT in conjunction with BPR, in another well-known example.&lt;ref name="Weicher, et al., 1995"/&gt; The IT infrastructure and BPR are interdependent in the sense that deciding the information requirements for the new business processes determines the IT infrastructure constituents, and a recognition of IT capabilities provides alternatives for BPR.&lt;ref name="Ross, 1998"/&gt; Building a responsive IT infrastructure is highly dependent on an appropriate determination of business process information needs.  This, in turn, is determined by the types of activities embedded in a business process, and their sequencing and reliance on other organizational processes.&lt;ref&gt;(Sabherwal &amp; King, 1991)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Effective change management ===
Al-Mashari and Zairi (2000) suggest that BPR involves changes in people behavior and culture, processes, and technology.  As a result, there are many factors that prevent the effective implementation of BPR and hence restrict innovation and continuous improvement. [[Change management]], which involves all human and social related changes and cultural adjustment techniques needed by management to facilitate the insertion of newly designed processes and structures into working practice and to deal effectively with resistance, is considered by many researchers to be a crucial component of any BPR effort.One of the most overlooked obstacles to successful BPR project implementation is resistance from those whom implementers believe will benefit the most.  Most projects underestimate the cultural effect of major process and structural change and as a result, do not achieve the full potential of their change effort.  Many people fail to understand that change is not an event, but rather a management technique.

Change management is the discipline of managing change as a process, with due consideration that employees are people, not programmable machines.&lt;ref name="Covert, 1997"/&gt;  Change is implicitly driven by motivation which is fueled by the recognition of the need for change.  An important step towards any successful reengineering effort is to convey an understanding of the necessity for change.&lt;ref name="Dooley &amp; Johnson, 2001"/&gt;  It is a well-known fact that organizations do not change unless people change; the better change is managed, the less painful the transition is.

[[Organizational culture]] is a determining factor in successful BPR implementation.&lt;ref&gt;(Zairi &amp; Sinclair, 1995)&lt;/ref&gt;  Organizational culture influences the organization’s ability to adapt to change.  Culture in an organization is a self-reinforcing set of beliefs, attitudes, and behavior.  Culture is one of the most resistant elements of organizational behavior and is extremely difficult to change. BPR must consider current culture in order to change these beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors effectively.  Messages conveyed from management in an organization continually enforce current culture.  Change is implicitly driven by motivation which is fueled by the recognition of the need for change.

The first step towards any successful transformation effort is to convey an understanding of the necessity for change.&lt;ref name="Dooley &amp; Johnson, 2001"/&gt;  Management rewards system, stories of company origin and early successes of founders, physical symbols, and company icons constantly enforce the message of the current culture. Implementing BPR successfully is dependent on how thoroughly management conveys the new cultural messages to the organization.&lt;ref name="Campbell &amp; Kleiner, 1997"/&gt;  These messages provide people in the organization with a guideline to predict the outcome of acceptable behavior patterns.  People should be the focus for any successful business change.
  
BPR is not a recipe for successful business transformation if it focuses on only computer technology and process redesign.  In fact, many BPR projects have failed because they did not recognize the importance of the human element in implementing BPR.  Understanding the people in organizations, the current company culture, motivation, leadership, and past performance is essential to recognize, understand, and integrate into the vision and implementation of BPR.  If the human element is given equal or greater emphasis in BPR, the odds of successful business transformation increase substantially.&lt;ref name="Campbell &amp; Kleiner, 1997"/&gt;

=== Ongoing continuous improvement ===
Many organizational change theorists hold a common view of organizations adjusting gradually and incrementally and responding locally to individual crises as they arise&lt;ref name="Dooley &amp; Johnson, 2001"/&gt; Common elements are:  
* BPR is a successive and ongoing process and should be regarded as an improvement strategy that enables an organization to make the move from traditional functional orientation to one that aligns with strategic business processes.&lt;ref name="Vakola &amp; Rezgui, 2000"/&gt;  
* Continuous improvement is defined as the propensity of the organization to pursue incremental and innovative improvements in its processes, products, and services.&lt;ref name="Dooley &amp; Johnson, 2001"/&gt;  The incremental change is governed by the knowledge gained from each previous change cycle.  
* It is essential that the automation infrastructure of the BPR activity provides for performance measurements in order to support continuous improvements.  It will need to efficiently capture appropriate data and allow access to appropriate individuals.  
* To ensure that the process generates the desired benefits, it must be tested before it is deployed to the end users.  If it does not perform satisfactorily, more time should be taken to modify the process until it does.  
* A fundamental concept for quality practitioners is the use of feedback loops at every step of the process and an environment that encourages constant evaluation of results and individual efforts to improve.&lt;ref name="Gore, 1999"&gt;(Gore, 1999)&lt;/ref&gt;  
* At the end user’s level, there must be a proactive feedback mechanism that provides for and facilitates resolutions of problems and issues.  This will also contribute to a continuous risk assessment and evaluation which are needed throughout the implementation process to deal with any risks at their initial state and to ensure the success of the reengineering efforts.  
* Anticipating and planning for risk handling is important for dealing effectively with any risk when it first occurs and as early as possible in the BPR process.&lt;ref&gt;(Clemons, 1995)&lt;/ref&gt;  It is interesting that many of the successful applications of reengineering described by its proponents are in organizations practicing continuous improvement programs.  
* Hammer and Champy (1993) use the IBM Credit Corporation as well as Ford and Kodak, as examples of companies that carried out BPR successfully due to the fact that they had long-running continuous improvement programs.&lt;ref name="Gore, 1999"/&gt;

In conclusion, successful BPR can potentially create substantial improvements in the way organizations do business and can actually produce fundamental improvements for business operations.  However, in order to achieve that, there are some key success factors that must be taken into consideration when performing BPR.

BPR success factors are a collection of lessons learned from reengineering projects and from these lessons common themes have emerged.  In addition, the ultimate success of BPR depends on the people who do it and on how well they can be committed and motivated to be creative and to apply their detailed knowledge to the reengineering initiative. Organizations planning to undertake BPR must take into consideration the success factors of BPR in order to ensure that their reengineering related change efforts are comprehensive, well-implemented, and have minimum chance of failure. This has been very beneficial in all terms

== Critique ==
Many companies used reengineering as a pretext to [[layoff|downsizing]], though this was not the intent of reengineering's proponents; consequently, reengineering earned a reputation for being synonymous with downsizing and layoffs.&lt;ref name="Obit"&gt;[http://www.livemint.com/2008/09/06000936/Michael-Hammer-who-made-reeng.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

In many circumstances, reengineering has not always lived up to its expectations. Some prominent reasons include:
* Reengineering assumes that the factor that limits an organization's performance is the ineffectiveness of its processes (which may or may not be true) and offers no means of validating that assumption.
* Reengineering assumes the need to start the process of performance improvement with a "clean slate," i.e. totally disregard the ''[[status quo]].''
* According to [[Eliyahu M. Goldratt]] (and his [[Theory of Constraints]]) reengineering does not provide an effective way to focus improvement efforts on the organization's constraint{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}.

Others have claimed that reengineering was a recycled [[buzzword]] for commonly-held ideas. Abrahamson (1996) argued that fashionable management terms tend to follow a lifecycle, which for Reengineering peaked between 1993 and 1996 (Ponzi and Koenig 2002). They argue that Reengineering was in fact nothing new (as e.g. when Henry Ford implemented the [[assembly line]] in 1908, he was in fact reengineering, radically changing the way of thinking in an organization).

The most frequent critique against BPR concerns the strict focus on efficiency and technology and the disregard of people in the organization that is subjected to a reengineering initiative. Very often, the label BPR was used for major workforce reductions. Thomas Davenport, an early BPR proponent, stated that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"When I wrote about "business process redesign" in 1990, I explicitly said that using it for cost reduction alone was not a sensible goal. And consultants Michael Hammer and James Champy, the two names most closely associated with reengineering, have insisted all along that layoffs shouldn't be the point. But the fact is, once out of the bottle, the reengineering genie quickly turned ugly."&lt;ref&gt;(Davenport, 1995)&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hammer similarly admitted that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"I wasn't smart enough about that. I was reflecting my engineering background and was insufficient appreciative of the human dimension. I've learned that's critical."&lt;ref&gt;(White, 1996)&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Professional life==

In 2015, Mattes founded ''42.cx Center of Excellence for Artificial Intelligence'', a start-up that focuses on the commercialization of [[Artificial Intelligence]] ("AI"). The company is based in Vienna, Austria and was incorporated in November 2015.&lt;ref name="Futurezone"/&gt;

In 2010, Mattes founded [[Jumio]] Inc., a start-up for online authentication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://microsoft-news.tmcnet.com/news/2010/06/11/4840943.htm|title=Jajah founder unveils online payments start-up Jumio|publisher=tmcnet|accessdate=2010-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Davis Elkins''' (January 24, 1876 – January 5, 1959) was a [[United States Senator]] from [[West Virginia]]. 

==Biography==
Born in Washington, D.C., he attended the [[Lawrenceville, New Jersey|Lawrenceville School]], [[Phillips Academy]] in [[Andover, Massachusetts]] and [[Harvard University]]. During the [[Spanish–American War]] he enlisted as a private in the First West Virginia Volunteer Infantry, becoming assistant [[adjutant general]] in 1898.

Elkins was an [[industrialist]] with interests in railroads, banking, utilities, and coal mining; he was appointed as a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] to the U.S. Senate to fill the vacancy caused by the death of his father, [[Stephen B. Elkins]], and served from January 9 to January 31, 1911, when a successor was elected. During the [[First World War]] he served in the [[United States Army]] in [[European theatre of World War I|France]], 1917–18. He was then elected to the U.S. Senate and served from March 4, 1919, to March 3, 1925; he was not a candidate for renomination in 1924. While in the Senate he was chairman of the Committee on Expenditures in the Department of Commerce (Sixty-sixth Congress).

From 1936 to 1956 he was owner of the [[Washington and Old Dominion Railroad]] Company. Davis Elkins died in [[Richmond, Virginia]] in 1959; interment was in Maplewood Cemetery, [[Elkins, West Virginia]].

Davis Elkins was a son of Stephen Benton Elkins and a grandson of [[Henry Gassaway Davis]], both U.S. Senators from West Virginia. He was married to Mary Reagan Elkins and had 3 children. His sister Katherine Hallie "Kitty" Elkins (Jan. 14, 1886 – Sept. 3, 1936) was engaged for some time to [[Prince Luigi Amedeo, Duke of the Abruzzi]] (1873–1933), a cousin of the king of Italy.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1529">'''Dump leaching''' is an [[industrial process]] to extract [[precious metal]]s and [[copper]] from [[ore]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Atak|Önal|Çelik|1998|pp=439–440}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Much more can be incorporated from this article --&gt;

Dump leaching is similar to [[heap leaching]], however in the case of dump leaching ore is taken directly from the mine and stacked on the leach pad without crushing where, in the case of [[gold]] and [[silver]], the dump is irrigated with a dilute [[cyanide]] solution that percolates through the ore to dissolve gold and silver. The solution containing gold and silver exits the base of the dump, is collected and precious metals extracted. The resultant barren solution is recharged with additional cyanide and returned to the dump.

This method of leaching is usually suitable for low grade ores because it is very low cost. However, it operates with slow kinetics and may take up about 1 to 2 years to extract 50% of the desired mineral.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2868">In the [[United States]] '''Enhanced Use Lease''' ('''EUL''') is a method for funding [[construction]] or renovations on [[Federal government of the United States|federal]] property by allowing a private developer to [[lease]] underutilized property, with rent paid by the developer in the form of cash or in-kind services.  Currently, EULs are used by the Department of Defense and the Veterans Administration.  Temporary authority has also been granted to the General Services Agency and the National Aeronatics and Space Administration.  EUL authority is derived from Congress and is specific to each agency (e.g. 10 USC 2667 for the DoD).  The information below is specific to DoD EULs.

Granted a ground lease (the term may vary by agency or project), the developer is able to make improvements to the property which can be leased at market rents to any interested tenants.  Under EUL, the U.S. government retains control over the leased property, the EUL developer (lessee) retaines a lease interest only.

Since the agency can issue enhanced use leases only on land that is unneeded, the improvements must not be directly tied to any programmatic requirements of the installation.   

The advantages to the developer include prime secure convenient locations on military installations, and the opportunity to provide sole-source services and products in lieu of rent for the ground lease. 

The advantages to the federal agency include the possibility of fast-tracking alterations, repairs or new construction so that the improved space becomes available for lease.  In-kind considerations or cash to no less than the fair market value of the property is provided in return by the developer.

The enhanced use lease is becoming a very popular tool to accommodate realignment of military functions under [[Base Realignment and Closure]] (BRAC).  Military installations are legally bound, but not necessarily funded, to accommodate BRAC-mandated realignments of functions.  

The use of EULs has mushroomed with the expanded authority of Title 10 USC, Section 2667, of the [[National Defense Authorization Act]].  It remains to be seen whether this form of privatization will create increased financial, security or environmental risks.  Legal complications that have emerged include how EUL-encumbered property will be treated when an installation is targeted for closure under BRAC (example, Building 40 at [[Walter Reed Army Medical Center|Walter Reed]]).

The '''Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago Detroit Branch Building''' is a bank building located at 160 West Fort Street in [[downtown Detroit]], [[Michigan]]. It was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 2008.&lt;ref name="nris"/&gt;

==History==
In 1913 the United States Congress created the [[Federal Reserve System]], which established twelve regional Federal Reserve Banks, including the [[Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago]]. Detroit was included in the Chicago region. Regional banks had the authority to create branch offices, and in 1917 the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago authorized the establishment of a [[Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago Detroit Branch|Detroit Branch]]. In March 1918, the Detroit Branch opened, operating out of three local institutions. However, Detroit operations soon outgrew this operation, and in 1921 a site was chosen for a new building.&lt;ref name = "nom"&gt;{{citation | title = NATIONAL REGISTER OF HISTORIC PLACES REGISTRATION FORM: Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago Detroit Branch Building | author = Rebecca Binno Savage | date = July 2007 | url = https://catalog.archives.gov/id/25341114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This site was within the [[Detroit Financial District]], at a location that had once been part of [[Fort Shelby (Michigan)|Fort Shelby]]. After the fort was demolished, the land associated with it was divided into lots. [[Hiram Walker]] purchased several lots and constructed a house there. After Walker's death, the University Club purchased the house, and in 1916 the property was purchased by [[James Couzens]]. Couzens sold the land this building is located on to the Federal Reserve in 1921. In 1926, Congress authorized the  construction of this building. The Federal Reserve hired the Chicago firm of  Graham, Anderson, Probst &amp; White to design it, and construction began in 1927.&lt;ref name = "nom"/&gt;

The building officially opened in December 1927. However, by the early 1940s, the branch office had outgrown the building's capacity. In 1945, the Federal Reserve purchased lots adjacent to the building, and hired the firm of [[SmithGroupJJR|Smith, Hinchman &amp; Grylls]] to design an annex. The firm's head designer, [[Minoru Yamasaki]], planned the building. Construction began in 1949, and by 1951, the eight-story glass-and-marble annex, was opened.&lt;ref name="aia"&gt;{{cite book| first1=Eric J.| last1=Hill| first2=John| last2=Gallagher| title=AIA Detroit| url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=es&amp;id=sZGskamYzjUC&amp;q=federal+reserve#v=snippet&amp;q=federal%20reserve&amp;f=false| publisher=[[Wayne State University Press]]| year=2003| isbn=0-8143-3120-3| page=90}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Modern architecture|Modern]] annex is clearly designed not to mimic the original building, but to make a statement all its own. After completion of the annex, the original building was gutted and renovated, and the entire complex was opened in 1953.&lt;ref name = "nom"/&gt;

In 2004, the Federal Reserve Bank moved to a new building at 1600 East Warren Avenue, leaving the building on Fort empty.

==Description==
The Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago Detroit Branch Building consists of a 1927 three-and-one-half-story marble-faced [[Neoclassical architecture|Classical Revival]] bank building and a 1951 eight-story [[International Style (architecture)|International Style]] Annex. The Annex is set back 30 feet from the front of the original building, and a small raised plaza is sited in front of the Annex and beside the original building. The floor levels of the two buildings are aligned, and the original building was gutted with the Annex was constructed, providing a seamless transition between the structures. The fourth floor of the original building was demolished to provide space for a penthouse projecting from the Annex, and a terrace for outdoor seating.&lt;ref name = "nom"/&gt;

The original 1927 building measures 75 feet by 130 feet, and has a black marble base approximately four feet high, with the upper section sheathed in white marble. A heavy stringcourse above the second-story windows separates the lower floors from the third (attic) story. The first-floor windows are multi-paned six-over-six windows with a cast-iron spandrel between each pair. The second and third floors originally had one-over-one double-hung windows, but these have been replaced with a single pane. The original main entrance of the building was eliminated in the 1951 renovation.&lt;ref name = "nom"/&gt;

The 1951 Annex measures 115 feet by 100 feet. The curtain walls are constructed from a grid of stainless steel from which 1-1/2" marble slabs are suspended. The ground floor is divided into seven bays by marble piers. The curtain walls on the upper floors extend three feet beyond the recessed ground floor piers. The white marble used in this structure was carefully chosen to match the color of the original building, and the glass was tinted green to reduce glare.&lt;ref name = "nom"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2422">The [[U.S. Department of Defense]]'s '''Foreign Military Sales''' ('''FMS''') program facilitates sales of U.S. arms, defense equipment, defense services, and military training to foreign governments. The purchaser does not deal directly with the [[defense contractor]]; instead, the [[Defense Security Cooperation Agency]] serves as an intermediary, usually handling procurement, logistics and delivery and often providing product support, training, and infrastructure construction (such as hangars, runways, utilities, etc.). The [[Defense Contract Management Agency]] often accepts FMS equipment on behalf of the [[US government]].

FMS is based on countries being authorized to participate, cases as the mechanism to procure services, and a deposit in a US Trust Fund or appropriate credit and approval to fund services.

Some [[U.S. Air Force]] FMS programs are assigned two-word [[code name|codename]]s beginning with the word PEACE, indicating oversight by USAF Headquarters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.designation-systems.net/usmilav/codenames.html|title=U.S. Military Code Names|work=designation-systems.net|accessdate=25 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second word in these codenames is often chosen to reflect some facet of the customer, such as MARBLE for Israel or ONYX for Turkey. Codenames appear in all capital letters.

No partner nation has yet succeeded in applying strict schedule clauses to a FMS program.&lt;ref&gt;Tae-hoon, Lee. [http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2012/03/205_106346.html "Seoul fears delivery delays of F-35 jets."] ''Korea Times''. March 6, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;{{cn|date=November 2014}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6062">[[Image:Van Eyck - Arnolfini Portrait.jpg|thumb|260px|''[[Portrait of Giovanni Arnolfini and his Wife]]'' by [[Jan van Eyck]].]]

'''Giovanni di Nicolao Arnolfini''' (c. 1400 – after 1452) was a [[merchant]] from [[Lucca]], a city in [[Tuscany]], [[Italy]], who spent most of his life in [[Flanders]], then part of the [[Duchy of Burgundy]], probably always based in [[Bruges]], a wealthy trading city and one of the main towns of the Burgundian court.

The Arnolfini were a powerful family in Lucca, involved in the politics and trade of the small but wealthy city, which specialised (like [[Florence]]) in weaving expensive cloth. 

Giovanni, called here ''di Nicolao'' or "son of Nicolao" to distinguish him from his cousin ''Giovanni di Arrigo Arnolfini'' (see below), moved to Bruges in Flanders at an early age to work in the family business and lived there for the rest of his life.  He became wealthy trading in [[silk]] and other [[fabrics]], [[tapestries]] and other precious objects, although in later years he seems to have suffered business reverses, and to have retired from trading.  His fame arises because he is the most likely candidate, out of a number of male Arnolfinis, to have been the subject of two portraits by [[Jan van Eyck]], the famous Flemish painter. These are: ''[[The Arnolfini Portrait]]'' of Giovanni and his wife, dated 1434 and now in London, and another portrait, evidently of the same sitter when slightly older, now in Berlin (below). 

He was presumably born in Lucca, where his parents lived, but neither the place nor the date are documented. He was sent to Bruges whilst still technically a child, as the first record of him is a letter from his father Nicolao in Lucca to his agent in Bruges in 1419 empowering the agent to "emancipate" Giovanni - that is, to declare him adult. Since there was no fixed age for this, it gives no real clue as to his date of birth. 

In the next few years Giovanni di Nicolao worked with a very successful Italian merchant, Marco Guidiccioni, another Lucchese who was connected to him by marriage. Records of some of his dealings with the Ducal court have survived, but these were probably only part of his business activities. In 1422 he tried to sell a valuable gold collar to King [[Henry V of England]], and 1423 he sold [[Philip III, Duke of Burgundy|Duke Phillip the Good]] six tapestries of scenes from the [[life of the Virgin]], which the Duke gave to the Pope. Other sales to the Court are recorded, although he may have been acting on behalf of Guidiccioni. 

In 1426 he married Costanza Trenta, who is at first sight not the wife in the portrait, as a letter by her mother of February 26, 1433 mentions that she had died. She was also from Lucca, and her aunt Ginevra Cavalcanti was married to [[Lorenzo the Elder|Lorenzo de' Medici]], brother of [[Cosimo de' Medici]]. On the other hand, Margaret Koster has recently proposed that the double portrait may be a memorial one, including an image of Costanza, but painted a year after her death. 

In 1442 he signed an agreement whereby, for a moderate fee, he became a [[burgess (title)|burgess]] of Bruges after promising not to trade as a merchant. He was permitted to practise "the small burgess's crafts", but whether he ever did is unknown. In 1446 and 1452 he is documented as an arbitrator in disputes between other Lucchese merchants (in 1446 including his cousin Giovanni) over property; these are his last appearances in the documentary record. The double portrait remained in Flanders (see the Provenance section in that article), which suggests that Giovanni died there. 

There is no documentary evidence of a further marriage, but one has been assumed by art historians; it is not at all implausible that such a marriage would be undocumented. The appearance of the woman in the double portrait perhaps suggests she was Flemish, rather than Italian.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}

A slightly younger first cousin of Giovanni, called '''Giovanni de Arrigo Arnolfini''', (or "Jehan Arnoulphin le jeune" by the Burgundian accountants) also came to live in Bruges and was even more successful than Giovanni de Nicolao. 'Giovanni de Arrigo Arnolfini married, and was survived by, Giovanna (Jeanne) Cenami, and they were the couple thought to be the shown in the Arnolfini Portrait from 1861 until 1994, when a French naval historian, Jacques Paviot, discovered in the Ducal accounts that the Duke had in 1447 presented two silver pots to "Jehan Arnoulphin" on his marriage - by this time Van Eyck had been dead for six years.  Jane or Jeanne Arnolfini is documented further until her death in Bruges in 1480. A further two Arnolfinis, each a younger brother of one of the two Giovannis, are possible candidates as the subject of the Van Eyck portraits, as they lived in, or passed through, Bruges; but neither was apparently there in 1434.

'''Global Infrastructure Partners''' (GIP) is an infrastructure  investment fund making both equity and selected debt investments. GIP is headquartered in New York City and its equity investments are in infrastructure assets in the energy, transport and water/waste sectors. GIP employs approximately 150 investment and operational professionals and has offices in New York, London and Sydney and operational headquarters in Stamford, Connecticut.  In the aggregate, its portfolio companies employ approximately 21,000 people.

==History==
Global Infrastructure Partners was established in May 2006. Two of GIP's founding investors in its first fund, GIP I, were Credit Suisse and General Electric.  Each of these investors committed approximately 9% of the US$5.64 billion of GIP I's total committed capital.

The firm's first investment was announced in October 2006. It was a 50:50 joint venture between GIP and American International Group (AIG) to acquire London City Airport (LCY) for an undisclosed sum.  GIP announced the sale of LCY in February 2016 for a significant multiple of its 2006 acquisition price.

Subsequently, GIP has made two additional airport investments: the October 2009 acquisition of [[Gatwick Airport]], the second largest airport in the United Kingdom by passenger traffic, for £1.5 billion from [[BAA Limited|BAA]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/transport/6394265/Gatwick-airport-sold-for-1.5bn.html|title=Gatwick airport sold for £1.5bn|accessdate=15 October 2012|publisher=The Telegraph|date=21 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/8317662.stm|title=BAA agrees Gatwick airport sale |accessdate=15 October 2012|publisher=BBC News|date=21 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the 2012 acquisition of [[Edinburgh Airport]] for £807 million.&lt;ref name=bbc23412&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-17814024|title=Edinburgh Airport sold to Global Infrastructure Partners for £807m|accessdate=15 October 2012|publisher=BBC News|date=23 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bbc1612&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-edinburgh-east-fife-18287180|title=Edinburgh Airport changes hands to Global Infrastructure Partners|accessdate=15 October 2012|publisher=BBC News|date=1 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, GIP has made a cross section of investments in other areas of the transport sector as well as the natural resource and power generation areas of the energy sector. These assets include sea ports, freight rail facilities, midstream natural resources and power generation businesses.
 
Global Infrastructure Partners' first fund, GIP I, completed its fund raising in May 2008 with $5.64 billion in investor capital commitments.  The fund became fully invested during 2012. 
In September 2012, GIP's second fund, GIP II, completed fund raising with US$8.25 billion in investor capital commitments, making it the largest independent infrastructure fund in the world at that time.&lt;ref name=reut31012&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/10/03/us-gip-infrastructure-idUSBRE89213S20121003|title=Global Infrastructure Partners raises record $8.25 billion|accessdate=15 October 2012|publisher=Reuters|date=3 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exceeding what it had initially projected,&lt;ref&gt;Krouse, Sarah, and Ryan Dezember, [https://www.wsj.com/articles/blackrock-goes-3-7-billion-deeper-into-pipelines-and-power-1485943380 "BlackRock Goes $3.7 Billion Deeper Into Pipelines and Power"], ''Wall Street Journal'', February 1, 2017. Retrieved 2017-02-01.&lt;/ref&gt; GIP's third fund—GIP III—completed fund raising in January 2017 with approximately $15.8 billion in investor capital commitments. 

==Current Investments==
As of September 2018, Global Infrastructure Partners had aggregate assets under management of approximately US$48 billion with its investments largely concentrated in [[OECD]] countries. At this time, the Fund's portfolio included investments in the following assets:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://global-infra.com/investments/ |title= Investments |accessdate= 16 October 2012 |publisher= Global Infrastructure Partners}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''import license''' is a document issued by a national government authorizing the importation of certain goods into its territory. Import licenses are considered to be [[non-tariff barriers to trade]] when used as a way to discriminate against another country's goods in order to protect a domestic industry from foreign competition.

Each license specifies the volume of imports allowed, and the total volume allowed should not exceed the [[Import quota|quota]]. Licenses can be sold to importing companies at a competitive price, or simply a fee. However, it is argued that this allocation methods provides incentives for political lobbying and bribery. Government may put certain restrictions on what is imported as well as the amount of imported goods and services. For example, if a business wishes to import agricultural products such as vegetables, then the government may be concerned about the impact of such importations of the local market and thus impose a restriction.

==Système Intégré de Gestion de Licenses==
The '''Système Intégré de Gestion de Licenses''' (SIGL) is the [[European Union]] [[Directorate-General for Trade|Directorate General for Trade]]'s integrated IT system for the management of licences for imports of textiles, clothing, footwear, steel and wood to the EU.&lt;ref&gt;European Commission, [http://trade.ec.europa.eu/sigl/index.html Système Intégré de Gestion de Licenses], accessed 11 June 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Born in [[Licking County, Ohio]], Creighton's first job was working for his brother [[Edward Creighton|Edward]], installing a [[telegraph]] line from [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]] to [[Toledo, Ohio|Toledo]]. In 1852 he enrolled in St. Joseph's Dominican School near [[Somerset, Ohio]]. In 1856 he came to Omaha as a clerk with a local merchant, and in 1860 he took two jobs moving cattle and freight from Omaha to [[Denver, Colorado]]. Around that same period Edward accepted a contract installing {{convert|700|mi|km}} of the [[Pacific Telegraph]], the [[First Transcontinental Telegraph]] in the United States. John was hired as the superintendent of the construction. In the early 1860s Creighton traveled to [[Montana]] to mine gold, eventually installing a telegraph line from [[Salt Lake City, Utah]] to [[Helena, Montana]].&lt;ref name="query.nytimes.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="South Omaha"&gt;(1880) [http://www.rootsweb.com/~neresour/OLLibrary/Omaha_book/omaha042.htm "South Omaha"], ''Omaha Illustrated.'' D.C. Dunbar and Company. p. 114. Retrieved 1/22/08.&lt;/ref&gt;

During Creighton's life in Montana he is credited with helping rid the state of the [[outlaw|desperados]] who made it inhospitable towards settlement. In 1865 after he was assaulted and his leg was broken, a local newspaper wrote, "We believe that the only way to kill John Creighton would be to cut his head off and then carry away the body." During this same period of time Creighton was named a "[[Colonel]]" by Montana's acting Governor General [[Thomas Francis Meagher]].&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt;

In 1868 John Creighton returned to Omaha permanently,&lt;ref name="query.nytimes.com"/&gt; where he established a grocery business in [[Jobber's Canyon]]. In 1868 John married [[Sarah Emily Wareham]], the sister of [[Mary Lucretia Creighton]], who was married to John's brother Edward. When Edward died suddenly in 1874, his wife Mary became committed to his notion of creating a free college in Nebraska. She died in 1876, leaving a considerable amount of money along with strict instructions for the foundation of the college in her husband's honor. John, his cousin James, and [[Herman Kountze]], a banker and family friend, were the executors of Edwards will. Acting in that capacity they purchased the present site of the University and proceeded to erect what is now called Creighton Hall.&lt;ref&gt;Morton, J. and Watkins, A. (1918) [http://www.rootsweb.com/~neresour/OLLibrary/MWHNE/mwhne492.htm "Creighton University"], ''History of Nebraska from the Earliest Explorations of the Trans-Mississippi Region''.

John's wife Sarah died September 3, 1888; before her death she bequeathed a business block near [[Downtown Omaha]] to the yet-to-be-established Creighton College. By the early 1890s he was attributed to holding, "more of the valuable real estate of the city [of Omaha] than any other individual."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rootsweb.com/~neresour/OLLibrary/Omaha_book/omaha042.htm "South Omaha"], ''Omaha Illustrated.'' Retrieved 1/22/08.&lt;/ref&gt; He owned a [[South Omaha Terminal Railway|railroad company]], was a large stockholder in the [[Omaha Cable Tramway Company]], heavily interested in the [[South Omaha]] syndicate responsible for building up much of that area, and was Vice-President of the [[First National of Nebraska|First National Bank of Omaha]].&lt;ref name="South Omaha"/&gt;

In 1884 Creighton was a delegate to the Democratic National Convention at [[Chicago]] where [[Grover Cleveland]] was nominated for [[President of the United States]].&lt;ref name="South Omaha"/&gt;

===Philanthropy===
From its founding in 1878 to the time of his death in 1907 Creighton was said to have donated at least $2,000,000 to Creighton University.&lt;ref&gt;Federal Writers' Project Staff (1939) ''Nebraska: A guide to the Cornhusker state.'' Federal Writers' Project of the Works Progress Administration for the State of Nebraska. p. 242.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1888 Creighton financed the [[Creighton University Observatory]], and in 1898 he gave money towards a medical school, which was named in his honor. In 1904 he created the Edward Creighton Institute.&lt;ref name="query.nytimes.com"/&gt; Creighton is also credited with establishing Omaha's [[Saint Joseph Hopital at Creighton University Medical Center|St. Joseph's Hospital]] and bringing the first monastery of the [[Poor Clares]] in the country to the city.&lt;ref&gt;[https://people.creighton.edu/~bjk79676/JACreighton.htm "John A. Creighton"], Creighton University. Retrieved 1/22/08.&lt;/ref&gt; He paid for almost the entire cost of [[St. John's Parish (Omaha, Nebraska)|St. John's Parish]] at Creighton, where the cornerstone was laid in 1888.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.creighton.edu/ministry/stjohns/history/index.php "The cornerstone laying must have been an impressive event..."] St. John's Parish. Retrieved 1/22/08.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recognition===
Today [[Creighton University]] in Omaha is viewed as being named in honor of the entire Creighton family, particularly John and his brother Edward, as well as their wives Sara and Emily.&lt;ref&gt;The town of [[Creighton, Nebraska]] was also named in his honor.  [http://www.nebraskahistory.org/publish/markers/texts/creighton_university.htm "Creighton University"], Nebraska State Historical Society. Retrieved 1/23/08.&lt;/ref&gt; He was named a [[Knight of St. Gregory]] on January 15, 1895 by [[Pope Leo XIII]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://press.creighton.edu/111403/cu1252.html "Creighton's history by the numbers"], ''Creightonian Online.'' Retrieved 1/23/08.&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1898 was titled a [[Count]] by the same.&lt;ref name="query.nytimes.com"/&gt; In 1900 Creighton received the [[Laetare Medal]] from the [[University of Notre Dame]].&lt;ref&gt;Dowling, MP [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04480a.htm "Creighton University"], ''Catholic Encyclopedia.

Retrieved 1/23/08.&lt;/ref&gt; as is the existent "John A. Creighton University Professorship" at Creighton University.

The [[Orpheum Theater (Omaha)|Creighton Orpheum Theater]] in [[Downtown Omaha]] was named in honor of John after he donated a significant portion of its construction costs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.operaomaha.org/tickets/orpheum/index.asp "Venue information"], Opera Omaha.

'''Julia Gardiner Tyler''' (May 4, 1820 – July 10, 1889&lt;ref&gt;{{Britannica|611489|Julia Tyler}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was the second wife of [[John Tyler]], who was the tenth [[President of the United States]], and served as the [[First Lady of the United States]] from June 26, 1844, to March 4, 1845.

==Early life==

Julia Gardiner Tyler was born in 1820 on [[New York (state)|New York]]'s [[Gardiner's Island]],&lt;ref name="NYTObit1889"/&gt; one of the largest privately owned islands in the United States.&lt;ref name=inside /&gt; She was the daughter of [[David Gardiner (politician)|David Gardiner]], a landowner and [[New York State Senate|New York State Senator]] (1824 to 1828), and Juliana MacLachlan Gardiner. Her ancestry was part [[Dutch people|Dutch]], part [[Scottish people|Scottish]] and part [[English people|English]].&lt;ref name=fl&gt;[http://www.firstladies.org/biographies/firstladies.aspx?biography=11 First Ladies]&lt;/ref&gt;

She was raised in the town of [[East Hampton (town), New York|East Hampton]] and the small [[Administrative divisions of New York|hamlet]] of [[Bay Shore]], and educated at the Chegary Institute in New York.&lt;ref name="NYTObit1889"/&gt;  In 1839, she shocked [[Upper class|polite society]] by appearing, posed with an unidentified man and identified as "The Rose of Long Island", in a newspaper advertisement for a [[middle-class]] [[department store]]. Her family took her to Europe to avoid further publicity and allow her notoriety to subside.&lt;ref name=inside /&gt; They first left for London, arriving on October 29, 1840. They visited England, France, Italy, Switzerland, Germany, Holland, Belgium, Ireland and Scotland before returning to New York in September 1841.&lt;ref name=fl/&gt;

===Courtship with President Tyler===
On January 20, 1842, the 21-year-old Julia was introduced to President [[John Tyler]] at a [[White House]] reception. After the death of his first wife, [[Letitia Christian Tyler]], on September 10, 1842, Tyler made it clear that he wished to get involved with Julia. Initially the high-spirited and independent-minded northern beauty felt little attraction to the grave, reserved Virginia gentleman, who was thirty years her senior. He first proposed to her on February 22, 1843, when she was 22, at a White House Masquerade Ball. She hated that and hated later proposals he made. The increased time spent together prompted public speculation about their relationship.&lt;ref name=fl/&gt;

Julia, her sister Margaret, and her father joined a Presidential excursion on the new steam frigate [[USS Princeton (1843)|''Princeton'']]. During this excursion, her father, David Gardiner, along with a number of others, lost his life in the explosion of a huge naval gun called the ''Peacemaker''.&lt;ref name="NYTObit1889"/&gt; Julia was devastated by the death of her adored father. She spoke often in later years of how the President's quiet strength sustained her during this difficult time. Tyler comforted Julia in her grief and won her consent to a secret engagement, proposing in 1844 at the George Washington Ball.&lt;ref name="TylerWHHA"/&gt;

==First Lady of the United States==
After a wedding trip to Philadelphia, a White House reception, and a stay at [[Sherwood Forest Plantation|Sherwood Forest]], an estate the president had recently acquired for his retirement, the newlyweds returned to Washington.&lt;ref name="Rattiner2013"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rattiner|first1=Dan|title=Julia Gardiner, John Tyler, the White House and the Princeton|url=http://www.danspapers.com/2013/02/the-greatest-love-julia-gardiner-john-tyler-the-white-house-and-the-princeton/|accessdate=May 2, 2017|work=Dans Papers|date=February 21, 2013|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although her husband was often visibly fatigued, his youthful wife thoroughly enjoyed the duties of First Lady.&lt;ref name="TylerWHHA"/&gt;

The anthem "[[Hail to the Chief]]" had been played at a number of events associated with the arrival or presence of the President of the United States before Julia Tyler became First Lady, but she ordered its regular use to announce the arrival of the President. It became established practice when her successor, [[Sarah Childress Polk]] did likewise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | work = New York Times | accessdate = March 22, 2017 | title = 'Hail to the Chief': The Musical Strains of Presidential Power | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/20/us/presidential-song-hail-to-the-chief.html | date = January 20, 2017 | first = Christine | last = Hauser}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the last month of the Tyler administration, she hosted a grand White House ball for 3,000 guests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Julia Tyler|url=https://us-first-ladies.insidegov.com/l/46/Julia-Tyler|website=us-first-ladies.insidegov.com|accessdate=May 2, 2017|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later life===

==Personal life==
Because of the circumstances surrounding her father's death, Julia and John agreed to marry with a minimum of celebration. On June 26, 1844, the President slipped into [[New York City]],&lt;ref name="NYTObit1889"/&gt; where the nuptials were performed by the Right Reverend [[Benjamin Treadwell Onderdonk]], fourth bishop of the [[Episcopal Diocese of New York]], at the [[Church of the Ascension (New York)|Church of the Ascension]], not too far from the Gardiner's residence on [[Colonnade Row|LaGrange Terrace]].&lt;ref name=inside /&gt; President Tyler was 54 years old, while Julia was just 24. Tyler's oldest daughter, Mary, was 5 years older than her father's new wife.&lt;ref name=inside&gt;{{cite inside}}, pp.84-85&lt;/ref&gt; The marriage made Julia the first First Lady to marry a President who was already in office at the time of the wedding.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.firstladies.org/biographies/firstladies.aspx?biography=11 Julia Gardiner Tyler-National First Ladies Library]&lt;/ref&gt;

The bride's sister, Margaret, and brother, Alexander, were bridesmaid and best man. Only the President's son, John Tyler III, represented the groom's family. Tyler was so concerned about maintaining secrecy that he did not confide his plans to the rest of his children. Although his sons readily accepted the sudden union, the Tyler daughters were shocked and hurt. The news was then broken to the American people, who greeted it with keen interest, much publicity, and some criticism about the couple's 30-year difference in age.&lt;ref name="TylerWHHA"&gt;{{cite web|title=Julia Tyler|url=https://www.whitehousehistory.org/bios/julia-tyler|website=whitehousehistory.org|publisher=[[White House Historical Association]]|accessdate=May 2, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was awkward for the eldest Tyler daughter, Mary, to adjust to a new [[stepmother]] five years younger than herself.  One daughter, Letitia, never made peace with her stepmother.

Between 1846 and 1860, Julia and John had seven children together:

* [[David Gardiner Tyler]] (1846–1927), a lawyer and public official.&lt;ref name="DavidTylerObit1927"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Times|first1=Special To The New York|title=JUDGE TYLER, 81, SON OF EX-PRESIDENT, DEAD; Former Congressman Dies in Late Father's Home, Sherwood Forest -- Fought With Confederates.|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1927/09/06/archives/judge-tyler-81-son-of-expresident-dead-former-congressman-dies-in.html|accessdate=May 2, 2017|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=September 6, 1927}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[John Alexander Tyler|John "Alex" Alexander Tyler]] (1848–1883), an engineer who, like his older brother, dropped out of Washington College to join the [[Confederate army]] and, after the war, resumed his studies in Germany.  There he joined the Saxon Army during the [[Franco-Prussian War]] and took part in the occupation of France in 1871.  For his service he was decorated by the Prussian government.  He became a mining engineer and, returning to the United States, was appointed U.S. surveyor of the Interior Department in 1879.  While working in that capacity in New Mexico, he drank contaminated water and died at 35.&lt;ref name=Todd&gt;{{cite book |last1=Todd |first1=Charles Burr |authorlink1=Charles Burr Todd |editor1-first=Henry Reed |editor1-last=Stiles  |editor1-link=Henry Reed Stiles |title=In olde New York; sketches of old times and places in both the state and the city |url=https://archive.org/stream/inoldenewyorkske00toddch#page/174/mode/2up |accessdate=February 25, 2012 |type= |edition= |series=The Grafton historical series |year=1907 |publisher=The Grafton press |location=New York, NY |oclc=3985699 |pages=174–175 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Leo Melamed Shinzo Abe and Tsuyoshi Takagi 20140701 1.jpg|thumb|200px|with [[Shinzō Abe]] and [[Tsuyoshi Takagi]] (at the [[Prime Minister's Official Residence]] on July 1, 2014)]]
Melamed, an attorney by profession, became involved in futures trading by accident. In law school he was looking for a law clerk job and answered a want ad from a firm looking for a 'runner', thinking the firm, [[Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Beane]], with that many names could be nothing but an established law firm, looking for a clerk to run to court. He worked as a runner in the produce futures markets of the CME throughout law school, learning about the business. He practiced law until 1965 and was elected to the CME board in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;"The World According to Leo Melamed," Derivatives Strategy, April 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

Melamed became chairman of the [[Chicago Mercantile Exchange]] in 1969. In 1972, under his leadership, the CME created the [[International Monetary Market]] (IMM), the world's first financial futures exchange, and launched currency futures. In the years that followed, Melamed led the CME and IMM in the creation of a number of financial instruments, including futures on [[United States Treasury security#Treasury bill|US Treasury bills]] in 1976, [[Eurodollars]] in 1981, and stock [[Index Futures|index futures]] in 1982.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

In 1987, Melamed spearheaded the creation and introduction of [[Globex]], the world's first electronic trading system, and became its founding chairman.

Throughout the next three decades and into the 21st century, Melamed held many CME titles including: Special Counsel to the Board; Chairman of the Executive Committee; and Senior Policy Advisor, but remained the acknowledged leader of the CME. In 2002, he led the CME membership to become the first U.S. financial exchange to go public.

In 2014 he was a board member of [[CME Group]] and chairman of its Strategic Steering Committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://cmegroup.mediaroom.com/index.php?s=43&amp;item=2773|title=CME Group Foundation Launched With More Than $600,000 in Grants|work=CME Group|date=December 28, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991 he founded his own consulting firm, Melamed &amp; Associates, of which he is chairman and [[chief executive officer]]. He used to be a member of the global markets advisory committee of the U.S. [[Commodity Futures Trading Commission]] (CFTC) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cftc.gov/aboutthecftc/globalmarketsadvisorycommittee/gmac_members.html|title=Global Markets Advisory Committee Members|publisher=U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission|date=December 29, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;   and has served as a special advisor on futures markets to governments worldwide. Melamed serves on the prestigious Chinese International Advisory Council of Chinese Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC).

== Recognition and awards==
Twenty years after their inception, Nobel Laureate in Economics, [[Merton Miller]], named [[financial futures]] "the most significant innovation of the past two decades." At the close of 1999, the former editor of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' named Melamed "among the ten most important Chicagoans in business of the 20th Century."

He was named a [[The Lincoln Academy of Illinois|Lincoln Laureate]] in 2016 in the area of Business, Industry &amp; Communications.&lt;ref&gt;http://thelincolnacademyofillinois.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Governors-press-release.2.12.16.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:C-130 airdrop.jpg|thumb|right|An [[M551 Sheridan]] being dropped from a [[C-130 Hercules]].]]

The '''low-altitude parachute-extraction system''' ('''LAPES''') is a tactical military [[airlift]] delivery method where a [[fixed wing]] [[cargo aircraft]] can deposit supplies in situations in which [[landing]] is not an option, in an area that is too small to accurately [[parachute]] supplies from a high altitude.

This method was developed by the [[US Military]] with the assistance of the 109th Quartermaster Company (Air Drop) in 1964. In May 1965, a detachment of the 109th was formed as the 383rd Quartermaster (Aerial Supply) Detachment and sent to Vietnam. In 1966 the 109th was sent to Vietnam and took operational control of the 383rd. Both units provided Air Drop and LAPES support during the [[Siege of Khe Sanh]] in the [[Vietnam War]]. LAPES was used to provide a method of supplying heavy loads into Khe Sanh which could not effectively be supplied by air drop.&lt;ref name=KheSanh/&gt; This practice was perfected at [[Mactan Air Base]] in [[Cebu]], [[Philippines]].

Preparation for a LAPES delivery includes loading cargo on a [[pallet]] rigged with two types of parachutes (chutes).  The drogue chute is used to pull a cluster of larger extraction chutes out.  The deployed extraction chutes will then pull the load out of the plane.  Floor locks hold the pallet in place until extraction time.

The LAPES delivery procedure begins by slowing to approach speed, lowering the ramp, and opening the cargo door.  To preclude damage to the aircraft from an inadvertent contact with the ground, the landing gear is lowered.  The aircraft approaches the extraction zone in a manner similar to landing.  On command of the pilot, the drogue chute is released and allowed to trail behind the aircraft on a tether.  As the pilot flares and achieves a wheel height of 1-2 meters above ground, the drogue chute is allowed to pull the extraction chutes out into the airstream.  The force of these chutes overcomes the floor locks, pulling the pallet across the ramp, out of the aircraft, and onto the extraction zone.  The pilot adjusts the flight controls to remain level during the extreme change in the aircraft center of gravity caused by the pallet movement.  While the pallet slides to a stop using the extraction chutes as a brake, the pilot climbs away from the extraction zone and raises the landing gear.  On climb out, the rear cargo door is closed and the ramp is raised, completing the sequence. 

LAPES enables planes to quickly deploy large cargo in a timely fashion instead of having to land and take off, which exposes the plane to enemy fire. The technique also allows delivery of loads that are too heavy for a direct parachute descent (high altitude drop). However, the drop sequence's low altitude allows for no margin of [[pilot error]] and the risk of [[plane crash]] is heightened.&lt;ref name="KheSanh"&gt;{{cite news|title=The Siege of Khe Sanh|url=https://www.pbs.org/battlefieldvietnam/khe/g_02.html|author=Geiger, Bruce M|work=PBS}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On July 1, 1987, during a [[capabilities exercise]] (CAPEX), a USAF C-130E (68-10945 c/n 4325) crashed while performing a LAPES demo at the Sicily Drop Zone, on Fort Bragg. The pilot of the C-130 had performed a LAPES drop with the same extreme rate of descent two days earlier during a practice run. The crash killed three on board and one soldier on the ground, and injured two crew.&lt;ref name="Ft Bragg"&gt;{{cite news |title=Plane Crashes in Military Exercise, Narrowly Missing Spectators|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/02/us/plane-crashes-in-military-exercise-narrowly-missing-spectators.html|date=2 July 1987|work=New York Times|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171106044910/https://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/02/us/plane-crashes-in-military-exercise-narrowly-missing-spectators.html|archive-date=6 November 2017|access-date=2 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''NHL Network''' is an [[United States|American]] [[sports channel|sports-oriented]] [[cable television|cable]] and [[satellite television|satellite]] [[television network]] that is a [[joint venture]] between the [[National Hockey League]] (which owns a controlling 84.4% interest) and [[NBCUniversal]] (which owns the remaining 15.6%). Dedicated to [[ice hockey]], the network features live game telecasts from the NHL and other professional and collegiate hockey leagues, as well as NHL-related content including analysis programs, [[television special|specials]] and [[documentary film|documentaries]].

The channel's headquarters and studios are located in the Secaucus, New Jersey facilities also utilized by [[MLB Network]].

==History==
[[File:Nhlnetwork.svg|135px|thumb|left|The original logo used from 2007 to 2009.]]
Launched on October 1, 2007, the NHL Network was developed out of a [[joint venture]] between the NHL and cable provider [[Comcast]], as part of a broadcast rights agreement that resulted in the [[NBCSN|NBC Sports Network]] (then known as Outdoor Life Network) acquiring partial cable television rights to regular season, and [[Stanley Cup]] [[Stanley Cup Playoff|playoff]] and [[Stanley Cup Finals|finals]] games from the National Hockey League.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nhl.com/features/iceage/mailbag112505.html NHL.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

The NHL Network originally shared some programming with its former [[NHL Network (Canada)|sister network]] in [[Canada]], with the main differences in programming between the two networks being the carriage of domestically targeted commercials and live game telecasts; NHL Network in the U.S. primarily carries broadcasts from Canadian national rightsholders (such as [[CBC Television|CBC]]'s ''[[Hockey Night in Canada]]'', [[NHL on Sportsnet|Sportsnet]], and formerly [[TSN Hockey|TSN]]), while the Canadian feed primarily carried games from U.S. broadcasters. The channel also picks up simulcasts of games from regional rightsholders; live games on NHL Network that involve U.S. teams are non-exclusive, and are [[Blackout (broadcasting)|blacked out]] in the markets of U.S. teams involved in favor of local broadcasters.

[[File:NHL Network 2009.png|140px|thumb|right|Logo used from 2009 to 2011.]]
The league hired [[Ascent Media]] to manage and distribute the channel, through its publicly traded subsidiary, Ascent Media Network Services. When it launched, the NHL Network became the third sports-oriented cable network devoted to programming from and controlled by a major sports league, following the [[National Basketball Association]]-owned [[NBA TV]] (which launched in March 1999) and the [[National Football League]]-owned [[NFL Network]] (which launched in November 2003); [[Major League Baseball]] would launch its own sports channel, [[MLB Network]], on January 1, 2009.

[[File:NHL Network 2011.svg|135px|thumb|left|Logo used from 2011 to 2012.]]
On June 1, 2015, ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' columnist David Shoalts reported that NHL Network in Canada would cease operations on September 1, 2015; national media rights to the NHL in Canada had been acquired by [[Rogers Communications]] beginning in the 2014-15 season, and the [[Bell Media]] staff members who managed the network's Canadian arm on behalf of the NHL were laid off that July.&lt;ref name=aa-mlbamdeal/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite tweet |author=Shoalts, David |author-link= |user=dshoalts |number=605470627458215937 |date=June 1, 2015 |title=Bad news last week for about 20 staffers at NHL Network Canada. They were told league is closing  Canadian operation Sept. 1. |retweet= |accessdate=July 17, 2015 |language= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2015, it was announced that the NHL had reached a six-year deal with [[Major League Baseball Advanced Media]] (MLBAM) to take over the management of the NHL's digital properties, as well as NHL Network. Operations and production of NHL Network's programming was shifted from [[Toronto]] to the [[Secaucus, New Jersey]] facilities of [[MLB Network]].&lt;ref name=aa-mlbamdeal&gt;{{cite web|title=The NHL/MLBAM deal is worth $1.2 billion over six years, involves equity, NHL Network shift|url=http://awfulannouncing.com/2015/the-nhlmlbam-deal-is-worth-1-2-billion-over-six-years-involves-equity-nhl-network-shift.html|website=Awful Announcing|accessdate=4 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=aa-mlbnhlnetwork&gt;{{cite web|title=What we know about the NHL on TV, radio and streaming media in 2015-16|url=http://awfulannouncing.com/2015/what-we-know-about-the-nhl-on-tv-radio-and-streaming-media-in-2015-16.html|website=Awful Announcing|accessdate=8 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; There has been minor talent sharing between the networks, and MLB Network also helped to cross-promote an [[NHL Stadium Series]] game at [[Coors Field]] by building a scale hockey rink in its Studio 42, which itself is designed to resemble a scaled baseball field.&lt;ref name="aa-rink"&gt;{{cite web|title=MLB and NHL Networks to cross-promote this weekend's NHL Stadium Series game in Denver|url=http://awfulannouncing.com/2016/mlb-and-nhl-networks-to-cross-promote-this-weekends-nhl-stadium-series-game-in-denver.html|website=Awful Announcing|accessdate=25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; For much of the 2015-16 season, NHL Network studio programming originated from re-themed versions of MLB Network's existing sets (much of the NHL regular season falls during the MLB offseason). In April 2016, coinciding with the start of the [[2016 Stanley Cup Playoffs|playoffs]], NHL Network introduced a dedicated, 1,200 square-foot arena-themed set.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NHL Network unveils new hockey-themed set "The Rink"|url=http://awfulannouncing.com/2016/nhl-network-unveils-new-hockey-themed-set.html|website=Awful Announcing|accessdate=14 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Carriage agreements==
Comcast, owners of the league's current cable partner NBCSN, is also the largest cable television provider in the United States. The company was contractually obligated to carry NHL Network on its systems by the summer of 2007 at the latest, so it would be available in time for the [[2007–08 NHL season]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mediaweek.com/mw/search/article_display.jsp?schema=&amp;vnu_content_id=1001016934 Media Week]&lt;/ref&gt; Both Comcast and the NHL had an option to terminate their contract after the 2006–07 season, which would have voided Comcast's obligation to launch a U.S. version of NHL Network, but opted to proceed with the launch.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sportsbusinessjournal.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=page.feature&amp;featureId=1694 Sports Business Journal]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since its official launch in the United States, the NHL Network announced on October 8, 2007 that it would begin being carried that month on [[Cablevision]], [[Charter Communications|Charter]], [[Cox Communications]], [[DirecTV]], [[Dish Network]], [[Xfinity]] and [[Time Warner Cable]] through carriage agreements that were struck with each of the providers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nhl.com/nhl/app?articleid=339497&amp;page=NewsPage&amp;service=page nhl.com]&lt;/ref&gt;  DirecTV has aired NHL Network on channel 215 since October 31, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dishnetwork.com/content/whats_on_dish/programming_packages/americas_everything_pack/packages.aspx DishNetwork.com(Packages)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dishnetwork.com/content/whats_on_dish/pay_per_view/sports/hockey/index.shtml DishNetwork.com(CenterIce Package)]&lt;/ref&gt; Going forward, any provider that already carries [[NHL Center Ice]] was expected to begin carrying NHL Network on one of its programming tiers. Some providers offer NHL Network's [[High-definition television|high definition]] simulcast feed, which broadcasts all live games in HD.

NHL.com announced on January 12, 2009 that [[AT&amp;T U-verse]] would begin carrying the channel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=403683|title=AT&amp;T U-Verse TV channel lineup scores NHL Network and NHL Network HD|accessdate=January 19, 2009|date=January 12, 2009|publisher=NHL.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed on June 2, 2009 with the announcement that NHL Network and Comcast had reached an agreement to carry the channel on the provider's Digital Classic Tier, which increased subscribership of the channel from the then-estimated two million subscribers in its placement on the "Sports Entertainment" tier to over 10 million on its Digital Classic package.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/277905-Comcast_To_Carry_NHL_Network_on_Digital_Classic_Tier.php Comcast to Carry NHL Network on Digital Classic Tier], ''Broadcasting &amp; Cable'', June 2, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Internationally, the network began to be distributed in [[Taiwan]] in 2010 on satellite provider [[DishHD]].

The channel is also available on over-the-top services like [[DirecTV Now]] and [[Sling TV]].

On October 1, 2011, AT&amp;T U-verse dropped NHL Network due to a carriage dispute over a planned increase in [[retransmission consent|retransmission]] payments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.multichannel.com/article/474595-The_Puck_Stops_Here_NHL_Net_Goes_Dark_On_U_Verse.php The Puck Stops Here: NHL Net Goes Dark On U-Verse] ''Multichannel News'' October 1, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; On November 18, 2016, the NHL Network returned to AT&amp;T U-verse following a five-year hiatus.

If the recipient of the payment is legally required to collect [[sales tax]] or [[Value-added tax|VAT]] from the customer, the amount would be added to the receipt and the collection would be deemed to have been on behalf of the relevant tax authority. In many countries, a retailer is required to include the sales tax or VAT in the displayed price of goods sold, from which the tax amount would be calculated at point of sale and remitted to the tax authorities in due course. Similarly, amounts may be deducted from amounts payable, as in the case of wage withholding taxes. On the other hand, tips or other gratuities given by a customer, for example in a restaurant, would not form part of the payment amount or appear on the receipt.

In some countries, it is obligatory for a business to provide a receipt to a customer confirming the details of a transaction. In most cases, the recipient of money provides the receipt, but in some cases the receipt is generated by the payer, as in the case of goods being returned for a refund. A receipt is not the same as an [[invoice]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.law.com/Default.aspx?selected=1740 |title=Legal Dictionary &amp;#124; Law.com |publisher=Dictionary.law.com |date=2010-12-09 |accessdate=2013-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is usually no set form for a receipt, such as a requirement that it be machine generated. Many point-of-sale terminals or cash registers can automatically produce receipts. Receipts may also be generated by accounting systems, be manually produced or generated electronically, for example if there is not a face-to-face transaction. To reduce the cost of postage and processing, many businesses do not mail receipts to customers, unless specifically requested or required by law, with some transmitting them electronically. Others, to reduce time and paper, may endorse an invoice, account or statement as "paid".

==Process==
===Shop receipts===
[[Image:ReceiptSwiss.jpg|thumb|upright|A receipt, obtained in a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] mountain restaurant on the top of the [[Grosse Scheidegg]]. Includes a list of food and drink items with prices, Tisch (table) number (7/01), total price information in two currencies ([[Swiss franc|Swiss Francs]] and [[Euro]]s), a note about the 7.6% tax, contact information and name of the cashier (Ursula).{{clarify|date=June 2017}}]]
The practice in most shops at the [[point of sale]] is for a salesperson to scan or in some way record the price of a customer's proposed purchases, including tax, [[discounts and allowances|discounts]], credits and other adjustments. In traditional situations and still in some family businesses today, the salesperson would then show the customer the summary, the invoice, for their agreement; but many shops today bypass this stage. The practice of presenting an invoice is most common in restaurants where a "bill" is presented after a meal.

The salesperson would indicate to the customer (whether by way of an invoice or otherwise) the total amount payable, and the customer would indicate the proposed [[payment|method of payment]] of the amount. Payment in cash or by payment is regarded as payment of the amount tendered, but payment by store account is not. After processing the payment, the salesperson would then generate in the one document an [[invoice]] and receipt. If payment was made by a [[payment card]], a payment record would normally also be generated.

The invoice and receipt are the printed record of the transaction, and are legal documents.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; A copy of these documents would normally be handed to the customer, though this step may be dispensed with. In many countries, a retailer may be under a legal obligation to provide a receipt to a customer which shows the details of a transaction and the shop and other information, so that the tax authority can check that sales and related taxes are not being hidden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/publications/p552/ar02.html |title=Recordkeeping for Individuals |publisher=Irs.gov |date= |accessdate=2013-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The document may also include messages from the retailer, [[warranty]] or return details, special offers, advertisements or [[coupons]], but these are merely promotional and not part of the formal receipt.

===Other receipts===
Receipts may also be provided for non-retail operations such as banking transactions.

===Barcodes===
Shops that use [[barcode]] readers may generate receipts with a barcode of the receipt identification number, that enables a salesperson to scan the barcode and quickly retrieve the details of the original transaction, for example:if a customer seeks to return or exchange goods or there is some other query.

===Customer history===
If linked to a customer shop account, some retailers' point-of-sale systems also allow the salesperson to see a complete record of the customer's buying history. A receipt (or a copy of a receipt) is the proof of purchase usually needed in order to make a return and often plays a vital part in a company's return and exchange policy.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

==Recipients==
An invoice goes to the person responsible for paying the bill while the shipping list (or packaging slip) goes to the recipient. The shipping list is included in the shipped box. In some scenarios, the same person will pay the bill and receive the shipment. However, a person can buy and pay for a product and send it to someone else (i.e. a gift).&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://smallbusiness.chron.com/difference-between-packing-slip-invoice-55059.html|title=The Difference Between a Packing Slip &amp; an Invoice|last=Thompson|first=Leigh|publisher=http://www.chron.com|accessdate=2015-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shipping list details==
Shipping lists vary depending on the business and its products. Every shipment to a customer should contain a shipping list that includes the order date, the products included within the box, and the quantity of each product. Some businesses may want to include the weight of the product next to the item. Many receivers use the shipping list as a guide or checklist when unpacking their order. If something is missing from the box, they cross-check it with the shipping list and then alert the seller.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==Manual receipts==
Hand-written or hand-completed receipts are more often used for infrequent or irregular transactions, or for transactions conducted in the absence of a terminal, cash register or point of sale: for example, as provided by a landlord to a tenant to record the receipt of rent. It can also be required when company representatives buy goods, because tax deduction rules might require hand signed receipts.

==Related industries==
Organizing receipts and similar financial documents is a multimillion-dollar industry in the United States. Consumers can use both desktop and online software to organize electronic receipts; sometimes, receipts are sent digitally from point of sale devices directly to consumers. The growing trend of digital receipts has led to the launch of new businesses focused on digital receipt management. Analytics predict a steady decline in the popularity of traditional paperwork in the near future, as entrepreneurs now seem to almost completely switch to online document-management software.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

Bahraini-based businessman Salah Nooruddin, CEO of Envest Limited, initially bought a 3.33% stake in LUFC Holding Limited following the takeover of Leeds United by [[GFH Capital]]&lt;nowiki&gt; - an &lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Islamic]] [[investment bank]] with headquarters in [[Bahrain]]. Nooruddin was initially appointed vice-chairman&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/sport/leeds-united/latest-whites-news/salah-nooruddin-named-as-new-leeds-united-vice-chairman-1-5692630 | title=Salah Nooruddin named as new Leeds United vice-chairman | publisher=Yorkshire Evening Post | date=21 May 2013 | accessdate=2 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; on 21 May 2013 but following the end of [[Ken Bates]]' tenure as chairman Nooruddin became chairman on 1 July 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.motforum.com/article.php?page=28998 | title=A good day for Leeds United | publisher=Marching on Together | date=1 July 2013 | accessdate=28 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later revealed that he had increased his stake in the club to 10%.

In early 2014 GFH Capital sold their majority stake in the club to Italian Businessman Massimo Cellino who then became majority shareholder by 75% this means GFH Capitol would only retain a 5% stake in the club while Nooruddin would retain a 10% stake through his company Envest Ltd while he would also look after the 10% stake in the club owned by the International Investment Bank.

In 2014 Nooruddin was removed as club chairman by new owner Massimo Cellino but would remain on the board of directors until April 2014 when he resigned from the board.

The '''Social Enterprise Association''', also known as "SE Association", is a platform to bring together social entrepreneurs, social enterprises, academic institutions, and businesses in [[Singapore]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://app1.mcys.gov.sg/PressRoom/TheLaunchoftheSocialEnterpriseAssociation.aspx "The Launch of the Social Enterprise Association"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120317013118/http://app1.mcys.gov.sg/PressRoom/TheLaunchoftheSocialEnterpriseAssociation.aspx |date=2012-03-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of the SE Association is to strengthen the culture of [[social entrepreneurship]] and [[social enterprise]]s so as to bring about positive [[social]] [[Social influence|impact]] within [[Singapore]].

This is done through:&lt;ref&gt;[http://seassociation.sg/downloads/Press%20Release-20%20Oct%202009-Launch%20of%20SEassociation.pdf "Press Release for Launch of SE Association - 20 Oct 09"]{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
	
# Cultivating an environment which supports peer-learning within the social enterprise community 	
# Organising [[capacity building]] programmes and business services
# Fostering synergistic partnerships among key [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]] (the Government, businesses and people)

==History==
In August 2006, a Social Enterprise Committee chaired by Mr [[Philip Yeo]] was formed to explore growth opportunities within the local social enterprise sector.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/315250/1/.html "Panel suggests more funding for social enterprises"]&lt;/ref&gt; The 26 recommendations provided by the Committee included setting up a Social Enterprise Association and a Social Enterprise Development Centre to cultivate a thriving culture of [[social entrepreneurship]] and related enterprises. The Social Enterprise Implementation Committee chaired by [[Gerard Ee]] then carried out the relevant operational procedures to materialize the recommendations listed previously. In June 2009, the Association was officially registered as a [[Company Limited by Guarantee]]. Currently, SE Association is co-chaired by Mr Seah Kian Peng, CEO (Singapore) of [[NTUC Fairprice Co-operative]] Ltd, and Ms Penny Low, President and Founder of Social Innovation Park Ltd. The other two board members are Mr Alfie Othman, director of Ikhlas Holdings Pte Ltd, and Dr Gillian Koh, senior research fellow of the Institute of Policy Studies at [[Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy]] in the National University of Singapore.

==Community and membership==
The SE Association's primary objective is to bring about positive social impact and an inclusive community among Singaporeans. It aims, first and foremost, to address the needs and interests of its target community – social enterprises, social entrepreneurs and would-be social innovators (see [[social innovation]]) – and then further engage other potential partners from the private sector and government to work on synergistic partnerships to promote the strength of its members and the sector as a whole. SE Association's members are social enterprises, individuals, students, voluntary welfare organisations / non-profit organisations, and corporate. Seminars, talks, [[focus groups]], consultations and networking sessions have been organized by the Association to provide learning opportunities for both members and the public. Their members are mostly located in the social enterprises in Singapore.

==Social Enterprise Development Centre (SEDC)==
The SEDC belongs to the training and consultancy arm of SE Association. The SEDC was launched&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/1088784/1/.html "Social Enterprise Development Center Launched"]&lt;/ref&gt; in October 2010 to build up the institutional capacity of social enterprises by working alongside social entrepreneurs to nurture and develop their social enterprises from infancy to maturity, and thereafter integrate them with the mainstream business communities.

SEDC offers two main advisory services: SE Start-up Advisory, and SE Business Advisory which includes advice and coaching. Advisory services offered without implementation plans is free- of- charge, but a fee is charged if SEDC is required to facilitate the development and execution of plans or where third party expertise is required. In addition, SEDC offers training and capability-building programmes for [[social enterprise]]s.

'''''The Biz''''' is a management simulation game published by [[Virgin Group|Virgin Games]] for the [[ZX Spectrum]] in 1984. In ''The Biz'', the player manages a [[rock music|rock]] band. The price of the game on release was £6.95, which is equivalent to £{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|6.95|1984|r=2}}}} today. The tape cassette contained the program, an interview with [[Frank Sidebottom]] and [[Chris Sievey]], and eight singles.&lt;ref name="zxspectrumreviews"/&gt;

==Gameplay==
[[File:TheBizZXSpectrumScreenshot.jpg|250px|left|In this screeenshot, the player's father has won £40,000 while gambling on football. Unfortunately, the player only gets £10 as a way to keep the game balanced.]]

Players set up their rock band with [[Gig (musical performance)|gig]]s, make them [[rehearsal|rehearse]] new [[song]]s, and hire a [[recording studio]] for producing new [[album]]s. The player starts out with no talent or [[pound sterling|money]] and an [[talent agent|agent]] must be hired in order to better co-ordinate the band. The stage presence of the band and the [[fandom|fanbase]] are improved with every gig performed. School [[Dance party|dance]]s and [[YMCA]]s are the first places that accept the player's newly formed band. Real television stations are included: a band from either [[Swansea]] or [[Cardiff]] would perform on [[S4C]] while a local band from [[Coventry]] would get promoted on [[Central Independent Television|Central Television]]. Players can sometimes record a [[List of Peel sessions|session]] with [[John Peel]]; whose broadcasting influence opened up new bands to people between the ages of 20 and 60 years of age.

Mundane details such as [[insurance]], standard [[musical instrument]]s and transportation [[expense]]s are all tabulated against the player's savings in the game. The game also contains an anti-[[drug]] message for bands who consider experimenting with them.

==Reviews==
The game only contains sound effects and no music, although eight singles were included on the cassette.  There are no graphics to speak of and the game is [[text-based game|text-based]].
