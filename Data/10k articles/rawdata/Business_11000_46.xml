'''277 Park Avenue''' is an office building in the [[Midtown Manhattan]] neighborhood of [[New York City]]. It stands on the east side of [[Park Avenue]] between East 47th and 48th Streets; it is {{Convert|687|ft|m|0}} tall, with 50 floors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aviewoncities.com/buildings/nyc/277parkavenue.htm |title=277 Park Avenue |work=aviewoncities.com |accessdate=2010-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The building currently houses parts of [[JPMorgan Chase|JPMorgan Chase's]] Investment Bank, Commercial Bank, and other corporate functions. JP Morgan's takeover of [[Bear Stearns]] in 2008 resulted in most investment banking employees moving to [[383 Madison Avenue]] to reduce the leased real estate footprint in Midtown. 277 Park Avenue remains under the ownership of the family-owned Stahl Organization, the building's original developer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Stanley Stahl, a Bank Owner And Real Estate Investor, 75 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/08/06/nyregion/stanley-stahl-a-bank-owner-and-real-estate-investor-75.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=August 6, 1999 |accessdate=2014-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Previous tenants have included [[Penthouse Magazine]], [[Schlumberger]], [[Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Chase Says It Has Deal for Park Avenue Spot |first=Charles V. |last=Bagli |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/12/02/nyregion/chase-says-it-has-deal-for-park-avenue-spot.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=December 2, 2000 |accessdate=2010-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Chemical Bank]] (Predecessor to today's JPMorgan Chase). The office building opened on July 13, 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Chemical Bank Opens Doors of Tower on Park Avenue |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1964/07/13/archives/chemical-bank-opens-doors-of-tower-on-park-avenue.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=July 13, 1964 |accessdate=2010-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Albino Sousa Cruz''' (1869 in [[Palmeira (Santo Tirso)|Santa Eulália da Palmeira]], [[Santo Tirso]] &amp;ndash; 1962 in [[Rio de Janeiro]]) was a Brazilian businessman, founder of Souza Cruz, later (and to this day) the subsidiary of [[British American Tobacco]] in Brazil.&lt;ref name="unicamp.br"&gt;Raquel C. Santos. ''Loira Infernal''. In [http://www.unicamp.br/unicamp/unicamp_hoje/ju/jornalPDF/ju163.pdf Jornal da Unicamp, n. 163, June 2001]. pp 6-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Born in a small hinterland village in Portugal, he emigrated on November 15, 1885, landing in Rio de Janeiro. There he worked for 18 years in a tobacco factory, ''Fábrica de Fumos Veado''. At age 33, having saved some earnings and acquired a solid knowledge of the trade, he established a small manufacture of paper wrapped [[cigarettes]], which were then a novelty. Production soon reached industrial scale, and Souza Cruz became the CEO of Brazil's biggest tobacco company.&lt;ref name="unicamp.br"/&gt;

Souza Cruz's cigarettes were often branded in feminine names, such as ''Yolanda'', ''Dalila'', ''Rosita'' or ''Marly'', and their ads featured sensual women (for instance, Yolanda Alencar, who featured the ads for the cigarettes branded after her). Other innovative marketing techniques were used, such as vouchers included in the packs that could be exchanged by prizes.&lt;ref name="unicamp.br"/&gt;

He retired in 1962 and died in 1966. At the time of his death the first controversies about the health issues related to tobacco were spreading; he was not a smoker.&lt;ref name="unicamp.br"/&gt;

'''Andrew Ehrenberg''' (1 May 1926 – 25 August 2010) was a statistician and marketing scientist. For over half a century, he made contributions to the methodology of data collection, analysis and presentation, and to understanding buyer behaviour and how advertising works.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}
 
==Biography==
Andrew Ehrenberg was born in Germany in 1926 into a well-known academic family. His father was [[Hans Ehrenberg]], his uncle was the historian [[Victor Ehrenberg (historian)|Victor Ehrenberg]], and [[Geoffrey Rudolph Elton|Geoffrey]] and [[Lewis Elton]] his cousins. He moved to England with his parents in 1938, and attended [[Queen's College, Taunton]]. Subsequently, he studied statistics at [[Kings College, Newcastle]] and [[Cambridge University]].

In 1951, he became Lecturer in Statistics at the [[Institute of Psychiatry]] in London, and in 1955 moved into commercial marketing research and consulting, where his writings on statistical methodology in marketing research and wider fields soon became well-known. In 1970, he was invited to take the Chair of Marketing and Communication at the [[London Business School]], where he remained for 23 years, eventually taking up a Research Chair.

In 1993, Ehrenberg became Professor of Marketing at the London [[South Bank University]] where he founded the Centre for Research in Marketing, and started the Research and Development Initiative which was funded by businesses internationally to pursue and disseminate quantitative marketing knowledge. The R. and D. I. became closely associated with the Marketing Science Centre at the [[University of South Australia]] and in 2004, Ehrenberg was succeeded as Director of the R. and D. I. by Professor [[Byron Sharp]] of the School of Marketing at UNISA. In 2005, Ehrenberg retired completely from the R. and D. I.

The Marketing Science Centre has now been expanded by the University of South Australia to form [[The Ehrenberg-Bass Institute for Marketing Science]] and the Centre for Research in Marketing at LSBU was renamed the Ehrenberg Centre for Research in Marketing in 2005, and Dr. Dag Bennett is now the director. The former R. and D. I. has been incorporated into both the above.

Ehrenberg held the rare distinction of having been awarded the Gold Medal of the British Market Research Society twice, first in 1969 and again in 1996. He also held the Honorary Fellowship of the [[Royal Statistical Society]]. In December 2005 he was awarded an Honorary Doctorate by the University of South Australia.  In 2010, he received the Lifetime Achievement Award of the (American) Advertising Research Foundation.
 
Ehrenberg wrote six books and over 200 publications. He retired at the age of 80.

==Research methods==

An early interest in social science applications of statistics had already begun to show through in Cambridge (such as extensive experiments into the reliability of trained taste-testers for quality assessments and into price subsidies in the food industry).  Also developed were two early aversions, the first to multivariate techniques imposed on simple data, and the second to mathematics for its own sake in applied statistics.

Ehrenberg's belief that the methods of physical science are applicable to social science was expressed in an article in the hard science journal Nature.&lt;ref&gt;Ehrenberg, A. (1993a), Even the social sciences have laws, ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', 365, 30 September 385.&lt;/ref&gt; In it he asserted that even in a field dominated by people's impulses to buy, that of marketing, there are striking regularities.

The discovery and development of such lawlike relationships, was described in series of papers.&lt;ref&gt;Ehrenberg, A., (1966) Laws in Marketing – A tailpiece, Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series C, 15, 257–268.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ehrenberg, A., (1968) The Elements of lawlike relationships, ''Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series A'', 131, 280–329.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ehrenberg, A. (1969), The discovery and use of laws of Marketing, ''Journal of Advertising Research'', 9,2, 11–17.&lt;/ref&gt; The definitive statement of this position came later in another paper read to the Royal Statistical Society.&lt;ref&gt;Ehrenberg A. and Bound, J. (1993b), "Predictability and Prediction, ''Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series A'', 156, 2, 167–206.&lt;/ref&gt; The summary stated baldly: 
{{quote|''A result can be regarded as routinely predictable when it has recurred consistently under a known range of different conditions. This depends on the previous analysis of many sets of data, drawn from different populations. There is no such basis of extensive experience when a prediction is derived from the analysis of only a single set of data. Yet that is what is mainly discussed in our statistical texts.''}}

Ehrenberg always pointed out that very many models of very different functional form may be generated with almost identical goodness of fit.  The selection of an appropriate model form to express a quantitative relationship is governed in his view by the need for:

#Previous knowledge. This seems obvious but standard statistical modelling techniques seldom if ever start from any reference to any earlier model.
#Simplicity. Models with many parameters cannot be tested in their variations by new data.
#Adequate but not unnecessarily wide scope. Scope means the range of conditions in which the model has been found to apply. Empirical models are not of universal application. Decision on whether the scope is adequate depends on technical knowledge of the topic being modelled.
#The absence of bias in predictions. Closeness of fit is secondary to this. Exceptions to the model may be noted.
#A structural model, which remains meaningful under algebraic transformation. This rules out regression techniques – even simple regression produces two different equations.

The failure to use any technique of optimisation either in model form selection or parameter determination has however been widely criticised. Ehrenberg has answered these criticisms by pointing to the absence of published and widely used models generated by conventional techniques. Another criticism is that Ehrenberg's published models deal with relationships between the averages of groups, and thus ignore variability between individuals.

The ideas in this section were used in one of Ehrenberg's principal fields of work, the study of buyer behaviour.

==Buyer behaviour==
In 1955, Ehrenberg moved into marketing research working on consumer panels. His first milestone paper was "The Pattern of Consumer Purchases" &lt;ref&gt;Ehrenberg, A. (1959) The pattern of consumer Purchases, Applied Statistics, 8,1, 26–41.&lt;/ref&gt; which showed the applicability of the [[negative binomial distribution]] to the numbers of purchases of a brand of consumer goods.

In the early 1980s, with Gerald Goodhardt and Chris Chatfield, he extended the NBD model to account for brand choices. The generalisation to the multi-brand case was put forward in "The Dirichlet: A Comprehensive Model of Buying behaviour" &lt;ref&gt;Goodhardt G.J., Ehrenberg, A. and Chatfield (1984), The Dirichlet: A comprehensive model of buying behaviour, Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series A, 147, 621–655.&lt;/ref&gt; and was read to the Royal Statistical Society. Finally published in 1984 the NBD-Dirichlet model of brand choice successfully modelled the repeated category and brand purchases within a wide variety of markets. 'The Dirichlet', as it became known, accounts for a number of empirical generalisations, including Double Jeopardy, the Duplication of Purchase law, and Natural Monopoly. It has been shown to hold over different product categories, countries, time, and for both subscription and repertoire repeat-purchase markets. It has been described as one of the most famous empirical generalisations in marketing, along with the Bass model of diffusion of innovation. In an independent effort, Bemmaor,&lt;ref&gt;Bemmaor, A. C.(1981a) [https://hal-essec.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01277068/document "Stochastic Modeling of Consumer Purchase Behavior: I. Analytical Results"], Working paper No. 81006, ESSEC Business School, Cergy-Pontoise, France.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bemmaor, A. C.(1981b)  [https://hal-essec.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01277071/document "Stochastic Modeling of Consumer Purchase Behavior: II. Applications"], Working paper No. 81007, ESSEC Business School, Cergy-Pontoise, France.&lt;/ref&gt; and Schmittlein, Bemmaor and Morrison  &lt;ref&gt;Schmittlein, D. C., A. C. Bemmaor and D. G. Morrison (1985) "Why Does the NBD Model Work?
Robustness in Representing Product Purchases, Brand Purchases and Imperfectly Recorded Purchases," Marketing Science, Vol. 4, No. 3,  255–266.&lt;/ref&gt; reported the same model. They studied its statistical properties, and in particular as it reduces to the simple NBD model. They labelled the univariate model as the Beta Binomial/Negative Binomial Distribution (BB/NBD). The model has since been extensively applied under this name by both academics and practitioners. 
Ehrenberg's work in this field was summarised in the book "Repeat Buying".&lt;ref&gt;Ehrenberg A.(1988)  Repeat-buying: facts, theory and applications, 2nd ed., Edward Arnold, London; Oxford University Press, New York. Reprinted in the Journal of Empirical Generalisations in Mark Science, 2000, 5, 392–770 (www.empgens.com).&lt;/ref&gt;

Ehrenberg derived from these models of buyer behaviour a view on advertising for established brands.&lt;ref&gt;Goodhardt GJ, Ehrenberg A., Collins M. (1987), The television audience, 2nd ed. Gower, Aldershot, UK.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barwise, P. and Ehrenberg, A. (1988), Television and its Audience, Sage, London, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; It mostly serves to publicise the advertised brand, but seldom seems to persuade.&lt;ref&gt;Ehrenberg, A., Barnard N., Kennedy R., and Bloom, H. (2002), Brand advertising as creative publicity, Journal of Advertising Research, 42, 4, 7–18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Promotions have only a short-term effect, and do not affect a brand's subsequent sales or brand loyalty. The extra buyers during the promotion have been seen almost all to have bought it before the promotion rather than being the hoped for new buyers.&lt;ref&gt;Ehrenberg A., Hammond K. and Goodhardt G. (1994), The after-effects of price-related consumer Promotions, Journal of Advertising Research, 34,4, 11–21.&lt;/ref&gt;

==[[Data reduction]]==
This is another strand in Ehrenberg's work. In 1975, he first published ''Data Reduction''.&lt;ref&gt;Ehrenberg, A. (1975,1981), Data Reduction, John Wiley, Chichester. Reprinted in the Journal of Empirical Generalisations in Marketing Science, 2000, 5, 1–391 (www.empgens.com).&lt;/ref&gt; The book has been revised, reprinted and translated (Ehrenberg 1981). It maintains that much of the approach to research methods and prediction depends on finding patterns in data and this is much aided by its presentation in simple tables. Such tables also aid communication of results.

The basic ideas are very simple. They depend on the principles of how memory works: clear layout of simple tables, rounding of figures, placing figures to be compared in the same column and showing averages.

This work has had a major effect in on the way data are presented in academia, commerce but less in the British public sector. There the layout of the official British Monthly Digest of Statistics under Sir Harry Campion antedated Ehrenberg by many years, but set a pattern in many ways the same.

==Communication==
Over more than fifty years, Ehrenberg worked not only to discover new principles and understanding, nearly always using data already available. He worked just as hard to communicate — to write simply and understandably, and to present figures in such a way as to tell an understandable story. His tables and charts always supported his communication. They did not ask the readers themselves to undertake the work of extracting meaning from the data.  In consequence, they have been criticised as showing only carefully selected data.

Ehrenberg drafted and re-drafted, often to the exasperation of his collaborators. He was tireless in presenting and publicising his conclusions on both sides of the Atlantic, though recently to the present writer he observed that his own major failure was in effectively communicating his principles to the users of statistics. His work continues, though, to influence the practice of both statistical science and marketing.

'''André Borschberg''' [[Royal Scottish Geographical Society|FRSGS]] (born December 13, 1952) is a Swiss entrepreneur, explorer, pilot and speaker. He is the co-founder of the [[Solar Impulse project]], the first ever round-the-world solar flight, successfully completed in July 2016. During the Japan-to-Hawaii leg, André broke the world record for longest solo flight in an airplane of any kind: 117 hours and 52 minutes, breaking [[Steve Fossett]]'s 2006 record. Before that, on 7 July 2010, André completed the first 24-hour solar powered flight. The flight set records for the longest manned [[Solar power|solar-powered]] flight and the greatest height reached by a manned [[Electric aircraft|solar aircraft]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/09/world/europe/09plane.html|accessdate=8 July 2010|work=The New York Times|author=Alan Cowell|title=Solar-Powered Plane Flies for 26 Hours | date=8 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He currently holds 14 [[Fédération Aéronautique Internationale|FAI]] world records in: free distance, free distance along a course, straight distance, straight distance predeclared waypoints, distance along a course, duration, absolute altitude, gain of height.
His groundbreaking record: the longest solo flight in an airplane of any kind: 117 hours and 52 minutes.

Borschberg flew as a jet pilot in the [[Swiss Air Force]] prior to his work with Solar Impulse. An engineer by education and a graduate of the [[MIT Sloan School of Management]], André Borschberg has solid experience in creating and managing companies. His passion for aviation and his interest in innovative solutions have led him to team up with [[Bertrand Piccard]] as CEO, co-founder and pilot of Solar Impulse.

For his role in delivering and piloting Solar Impulse, André was awarded the prestigious Mungo Park Medal by the Royal Scottish Geographical Society in 2018. This was awarded jointly with [[Bertrand Piccard]].

==Pilot career==
Fascinated by aviation from his earliest youth, André Borschberg trained as a pilot in the [[Swiss air force]], flying first [[De Havilland Venom|Venoms]] and then [[Hawker Hunter|Hunters]] and [[Northrop F-5E Tiger II|Tigers]] for over 20 years. Today he holds both professional aeroplane and helicopter pilots' licences and also does aerobatics in his spare time.

==Engineer and management career==
After graduating from the [[École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne]] (EPFL) in mechanics and thermodynamics, André Borschberg has constantly developed and led numerous technology projects, companies and start-ups, as both investor and entrepreneur. He very quickly supplemented his training with a Master's in Management Science from the [[MIT Sloan School of Management]], preceded by certificates in financial management and business management at HEC Lausanne. He first joined McKinsey, one of the world's leading business consultancies, as a consultant for five years, before starting his own entrepreneurial activities.

His strong points are business organisation, management and development. From finance to marketing, from engineering to human resources, André Borschberg has acquired solid experience as an entrepreneur, manager and consultant for over 20 years. He went initially into partnership with a venture capital company, Lowe Finance. His vast range of professional skills, his versatility and his perseverance enabled him to successfully launch two start-ups in the Internet and new technologies field. With a technical team from EPFL, he co-founded Innovative Silicon, a technology company in the field of microprocessor memories.

===Management===
At the head of the project Solar Impulse with Bertrand Piccard, André Borschberg brings the essential skills of an entrepreneur who contributes to convert vision into reality. As the CEO, he has put together and motivated a team of 65 top specialists and numerous partners, all from very diverse horizons and origins. "This diversity we have sought at every level stimulates their creativity and gives them their strength. It is from this pooling of experiences that original and totally-new solutions arise.”

===Engineering===
As a mechanical engineer and pilot, he is directing the construction of the aircraft and the preparation of the flight missions. "We need to find a way to build an aircraft that is super-robust &amp; super-light at the same time, and above all extremely efficient with energy consumption, so as to need only minuscule amounts of energy in order to fly. But with the same degree of resistance as a normal airplane. Hence the great complexity of the project, which gives the true measure of its philosophy and its objectives."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/video/?/video/tech/2011/11/29/solar-impulse-aircraft.cnn|accessdate=29 November 2011|work=CNN|author=CNN|title=Can solar power fuel future flight| date=29 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Solar Impulse 1'' missions===
* ''Solar Night Flight'':

On 7 July 2010, André Borschberg has, for the first time in history, flown 26 hours with the Solar Impulse aeroplane, demonstrating at the same time the possibilities to fly day and night with only solar energy to propel the aeroplane.

* ''European Solar Flights'':

Solar Impulse HB-SIA, piloted by André Borschberg, completed three international flights during the European campaign: Payerne to Brussels on 13 May (630&amp;nbsp;km), Brussels to Paris-Le Bourget on 14 June (395&amp;nbsp;km) and Paris-Le Bourget to Payerne on 3 July (426&amp;nbsp;km).

* ''Crossing frontiers'':

Solar Impulse, piloted alternately by André Borschberg and Bertrand Piccard, made its first intercontinental flight in 2012 from Switzerland (Payerne) to Toulouse, and then on to Morocco.&lt;ref&gt;"Bertrand Piccard; Explorer, c'est aller au delà des évidences", ''L'Express'', 1 August 2012, pp. 6–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Across America'':

Solar Impulse has completed the historic crossing of the United States over a 2-month period of the summer of 2013. Bertrand Piccard and André Borschberg, the two pilots, flew from San Francisco to New York, stopping over in cities along the way.

With the goal of the [[Solar Impulse#Circumnavigation flight .282015.29|world's first solar powered round the world flight]] initiated on March 9, 2015, these flights have provided good learning opportunities in terms of slotting the solar aircraft into international air space and landing at international airports.

===''Solar Impulse 2'' missions===

Taking turns at the controls of the airplane with his partner Bertrand Piccard for the first ever round-the-world solar flight, successfully achieved in July 2016.

===FAI world records===
André Borschberg achieved 8 [[Fédération Aéronautique Internationale|FAI]] world records flying with ''Solar Impulse 1''. During three historical flights (2010 night flight, 2012 Payerne to Madrid and 2013 Phoenix to Dallas), he was awarded 8 FAI World records: free distance, free distance along a course, straight distance, straight distance predeclared waypoints, distance along a course, duration, absolute altitude, gain of height.

With the ''Solar Impulse 2'', he broke the record of the longest solo flight, previously held by [[Steve Fosset]]. On 3 July 2015, Borschberg flew the solar powered airplane between [[Nagoya]] (Japan) and [[Kalaeloa, Hawaii]] (US) for a duration of 4 days, 21 hours and 52 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;Emma Howard, [https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jul/03/solar-impulse-lands-in-hawaii-after-longest-non-stop-solo-flight-in-history "Solar Impulse lands in Hawaii after longest non-stop solo flight in history "], ''[[The Guardian]]'', Friday 3 July 2015 (page visited on 5 July 2015); FAI, [http://www.fai.org/records/news-of-records/39587-he-made-it-borscherg-flies-solar-impulse-across-the-pacific-ocean] (page visited on Wednesday 8 July 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Angie Sanselmente Valencia''' also known as '''Angie Sanclemente Valencia''' (born 25 May 1979)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.interpol.int/public/Data/Wanted/Notices/Data/2010/38/2010_10938.asp Interpol Wanted Notice for Angie Sanclemente Valencia]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; is a former [[Colombia]]n beauty queen and lingerie model believed to be the ringleader of one of the world's largest drug syndicates.

==Background==
Valencia is originally from Colombia. where she won the Reinado Nacional del Café, a national qualifying competition for the prestigious [[Reinado Internacional del Café]] (International Queen of Coffee) beauty pageant, in 2000 but was dethroned two days later when it was found she was married. The title was awarded to Ximena Andrea García Buitrago.&lt;ref name="CNN"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/americas/03/24/colombia.drug.queen/index.html?hpt=C1|title=Model, allegedly drug queen, on the lam|publisher=CNN|author= Karl Penhaul|date=2010-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Zamora | first =Héctor Fabio | title =Destronada la Reina Nacional del Café | work =Archives | publisher =El Tiempo | date =2000-07-06 | url =http://www.eltiempo.com/archivo/documento/MAM-1220246 | accessdate =2011-10-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Syndicate==
Valencia's operation is believed to be a "rival empire" to that of her former boyfriend, a Mexican drug baron known as "The Monster".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/southamerica/argentina/7304510/Lingerie-model-runs-one-of-worlds-largest-drug-gangs-according-to-police.html Telegraph.co.uk: Lingerie model runs one of world's largest drug gangs, according to police]&lt;/ref&gt; She formed her own cartel after splitting with him.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.ninemsn.com.au/world/1016790/police-hunt-ex-model-turned-cocaine-kingpin NineMSN: Police hunt ex-model turned 'cocaine kingpin'] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100227091035/http://news.ninemsn.com.au/world/1016790/police-hunt-ex-model-turned-cocaine-kingpin |date=February 27, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  She is alleged to have recruited other models, whom she is quoted referring to as her "unsuspicious, beautiful angels" as drug traffickers, paying them up to around $5,000 (£3,200) per trip to transport [[cocaine]] from Argentina to England by way of [[Cancún]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.usatoday.com/communities/ondeadline/post/2010/02/lingerie-model-sought-for-allegedly-hiring-beautiful-models-to-smuggle-cocaine/1 USAToday: Lingerie model allegedly hired beautiful models to smuggle cocaine]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investigation==
Valencia's alleged syndicate was believed to have been exposed on 13 December 2009, when a 21-year-old woman, "Ariel L", was arrested with a suitcase containing 55&amp;nbsp;kg (121 pounds) of cocaine at [[Ezeiza International Airport]], Buenos Aires, Argentina.  "L" made no attempt to hide the drugs inside her bags, leading authorities to suspect the ring had help from employees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/2010/02/24/2010-02-24_lingerie_model_angie_valencia_running_global_cocaine_ring__using_fellow_catwalke.html NY Daily News: Lingerie model Angie Valencia running global cocaine ring -- using fellow catwalkers as mules: cops]&lt;/ref&gt;  She is reported to have been told that no one at the airport would try to stop her, and an investigation was launched to find employees of the airport with possible links to the syndicate.  After questioning "L", three additional arrests were made and a warrant was issued for Valencia's arrest.  Authorities believed she was still in Argentina after she fled a hotel where she had been staying with her [[Pomeranian (dog)|pomeranian]]. Investigators attempted to trace her location through the address under which the animal was registered, but it only led them to an abandoned warehouse.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/worldnews/article-1253347/Runaway-lingerie-model-Angie-Sanselmente-Valencia-named-head-drug-gang.html DailyMail.co.uk: On the run, the lingerie model who heads an all-women cocaine-smuggling cartel]&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2010 [[Interpol]] issued an international warrant for her arrest.&lt;ref name="CNN"/&gt;

Valencia was finally arrested in Buenos Aires, Argentina, on May 26, 2010, while staying in a local [[hostel]]. Police reported that she had registered under a false name and had tried to alter her appearance by dyeing her hair blonde.&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/americas/05/26/argentina.model.arrested/?hpt=T2 CNN: Former model arrested in Argentina on drug charges]&lt;/ref&gt;

She was initially jailed on 27 May 2010 in the "Centro Federal de Detención de Mujeres Unidad número 31" in the city of Ezeiza, Province of Buenos Aires, Argentina. In October of the same year she was moved to the "Instituto Correccional de Mujeres Unidad número 3" also in Ezeiza after she suffered some violent attacks.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ambito.com/noticia.asp?id=543682&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Hurley | first =Bevan | title ='Cocaine queen' moved after assaults in prison | work =New Zealand Herald | publisher =APN Holdings NZ | date =1 May 2011 | url =http://www.nzherald.co.nz/bevan-hurley/news/article.cfm?a_id=645&amp;objectid=10722644 | accessdate =19 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was released from prison and deported back to Colombia on 27 September 2013&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.insightcrime.org/news-briefs/argentina-frees-deports-colombia-narco-model InsightCrime.org: Argentina Frees, Deports Colombia 'Narco Model']&lt;/ref&gt; after serving only half of her original 6 year and 8-month prison sentence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clarin.com/narcotrafico/Confirman-anos-prision-Angie-Sanclemente_0_827317508.html Clarin.com: Confirman la pena de casi 7 años de prisión para Angie Sanclemente]&lt;/ref&gt; She is banned from returning to Argentina.

He is the son of [[Bancha Lamsam]] and M.R. Sam-angwan Lamsam (maiden name Devakula; half-sister of M.R. [[Pridiyathorn Devakula]]). The [[Lamsam family]] is one of the wealthiest and most powerful families in Thailand.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://library.uru.ac.th/webdb/images/sakulthai13.htm|title=สกุลไทย (Sakul Thai Magazine). ชีวิตและงานของ บัณฑูร ล่ำซำ กรรมการผู้จัดการและประธานเจ้าหน้าที่บริหารธนาคารกสิกรไทย (Life and Work of Bantoon Lamsam, President and CEO of KBank).|accessdate=September 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bantoon is Lamsam 5th generation and heading family's banking and insurance flagship. He is currently the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of [[Kasikornbank]], the top financial service provider group in Thailand.

== Early life ==
Banthoon Lamsam was born on 15 January 1953, a son of Bancha Lamsam and [[Thanphuying]] Sam-angwan Lamsam (maiden name [[Mom Rajawongse]] Sam-angwan Devakula; daughter of Prince [[Priditheppong Devakula]] and Mom Rajawongse Sa-ang Pramoj). Bantoon has two younger sisters. Bantoon is a grandson of [[Choti Lamsam]] who founded [[Kasikornbank]] in 1945 as Thai Farmers Bank. Banthoon graduated from [[Saint Gabriel's College]] and [[Srinakharinwirot University Prasarnmit Demonstration School]]. He studied at [[Phillips Exeter Academy]] from 1967 to 1971&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2005/11/07/entertainment/data/entertainment_19080450.html&lt;/ref&gt; before going on to earn a bachelor's degree in chemical engineering from Princeton University and a masters of business administration (MBA) from [[Harvard Business School]] (HBS).&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

After graduation, he spent two years with the military's Directorate of Joint Intelligence in the Ministry of Defence. In 1979, Banthoon joined Thai Farmers Bank (later changed to Kasikornbank) in the international banking department, where he was promoted to first vice president in 1986. In 1987 he moved to the domestic banking department as a senior vice president. In 1992, Banthoon was nominated president as of Thai Farmers Bank (TFB).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.kasikornbank.com/picture1/BoardofDirecter/Documents/BANTHOON_EN.pdf|title = Bantoon Lamsam, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, Kasikornbank|date = |accessdate = September 26, 2014|website = Kasikorn }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[1997 Asian financial crisis]] (known as วิกฤตต้มยำกุ้ง, literally translated as [[Tom Yam|Tom Yam Kung]]  crisis), he was the first to introduce the term "reengineering" to Thailand's banking industry. The Lamsam family became a minority shareholder of Kasikornbank. Banthoon Lamsam is an important contributor to the [[Democrat Party (Thailand)|Democratic Party]]. Banthoon was skeptical of the country's economic policies during [[Thaksin Shinawatra|Pol. Lt. Col Thaksin Shinawatra]]'s term as the prime minister of Thailand, and it was rumored that he had been approached by the Democratic Party for the position of the party leader in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thairath.co.th/content/432603|title=Thairath Online. เปิดประวัติผู้ทรงคุณวุฒิ 'ซุปเปอร์บอร์ด รสก.' เป็นใครมาจากไหน?.|accessdate=July 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, Banthoon became president and CEO of TFB. In 2003, he changed the logo and name of the bank from Thai Farmers Bank (TFB) to the current name, Kasikornbank (KBank), improvising Chinese characters style into the logo, "K".&lt;ref name="Matichon" /&gt; In 2010, after Dr. Prasarn Trairatvorakul, then the president of KBank, left to become the Governor of the [[Bank of Thailand]], Banthoon assumed the role of both president and CEO of KBank. He also instituted a senior executive position called "domain coordinator" and nominated four executive vice presidents to assume the positions of business domain, risk domain, infrastructure domain, and resource domain. Two of these executives later became the presidents of KBank and the other two became board directors.

In May 2013, Banthoon published a 608-page novel, ''Sinaeha Montra Lanna'', which he wrote in 13 months. The publisher printed 20,000 copies in the first two months.&lt;ref&gt;รายงานพิเศษ มติชนสุดสัปดาห์ (Matichon Weekend Special Report). Volume 33, No. 1716. 5–11 July 2013.

He is a staunch feng shui believer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.forbes.com/profile/banthoon-lamsam/|title = #21 Banthoon Lamsam, Thailand's 50 Richest|last = |first = |date = June 2014|work = Forbes|accessdate = 26 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Buyer credit''' is a short  term [[Credit (finance)|credit]] available to an [[Importer|importer (buyer)]] from overseas lenders such as [[bank]]s and other [[financial institution]] for goods they are importing. The overseas banks usually lend the importer (buyer) based on the [[letter of comfort]] (a bank guarantee) issued by the importer's bank. For this service the importer's bank or buyer's credit consultant charges a fee called an arrangement fee.

Buyer's credit helps local importers gain access to cheaper foreign funds  that may be closer to [[London Interbank Offered Rate|LIBOR]] rates as against local sources of funding which are more costly.

The duration of buyer's credit may vary from country to country, as per the local regulations. For example, in India, buyer's credit can be availed for one year in case the import is for tradeable goods and for three years if the import is for capital goods.

== Benefits to importer ==
Buyer's credit has several advantages for the importer.
The exporter gets paid on due date; whereas importer gets extended date for making an import payment as per the cash flows.
The importer can deal with exporter on sight basis, negotiate a better discount and use the buyers credit route to avail financing.
The funding currency can be depending on the choice of the customer and availability of LIBOR rates in the exchange market.  
The importer can use this financing for any form of payment mode, such as: open account, collections, or LCs.

== Steps involved  ==
# The customer requests the Buyer's Credit Arranger to arrange the credit before the due date of the bill 
# Arrange to request overseas bank branches to provide a buyer's credit offer letter in the name of the importer. Best rate of interest is quoted to the importer
# Overseas bank to fund Importer's bank [[Nostro and vostro accounts|Nostro account]] for the required amount
# Importer's bank to make import bill payment by utilizing the amount credited (if the borrowing currency is different from the currency of Imports then a cross currency contract is utilized to effect the import payment)
# Importer's bank will recover the required amount from the importer and remit the same to overseas bank on due date.
# It helps importer in working capital management.

== Cost involved ==
Interest cost is charged by overseas bank as a financing cost.

== Risk involved ==
Buyer's credit is associated with [[currency risk]].
Thus, [[Hedge (finance)|Hedging]] may be required as foreign currency is involved, making Buyer's Credit risky at times.

== Indian regulatory framework ==
Banks can provide buyer’s credit up to US$20 million (US$ 2 crore) per import transactions for a maximum maturity period of one year from date of shipment. In case of import of capital goods, banks can approve buyer’s credits up to $20 million per transaction with a maturity period of up to three years. No rollover beyond that period is permitted.

As per RBI directives dated 11.07.13, at the time of availment of trade credit, the period of trade credit should be linked to the operating cycle and trade transaction. AD banks need to  ensure that these instructions are strictly complied with.

RBI has issued directions under Sec 10(4) and Sec 11(1) of the [[Foreign Exchange Management Act]], 1999, stating that authorized dealers may approve proposals received (in Form ECB) for short-term credit for financing—by way of either suppliers' credit or buyers' credit—of import of goods into India, based on uniform criteria. Credit is to be extended for a period of less than three years; amount of credit should not exceed $20 million, per import transaction; the `all-in-cost' per annum, payable for the credit is not to exceed 6 months LIBOR + 350 basis points for credit up to one year, and LIBOR + 125 basis points for credits for periods beyond one year but less than three years, for the currency of credit.

All applications for short-term credit exceeding $20 million for any import transaction are to be forwarded to the Chief General Manager, Exchange Control Department, [[Reserve Bank of India]], Central Office, External Commercial Borrowing (ECB) Division, Mumbai. Each credit has to be given `a unique identification number' by authorised dealers and the number so allotted should be quoted in all references. The International Banking Division of the authorised dealer is required to furnish the details of approvals granted by all its branches, during the month, in Form ECB-ST to the RBI, so as to reach not later than 5th of the following month. (Circular AP (DIR Series) No 24 dated September 27, 2002.

As per RBI Master circular on External Commercial Borrowing and Trade Finance 1 July 2011, the all-in cost ceiling for interest is now six month L + 200 {{Not a typo|bps}}(bps is Basis Points  . A unit that is equal to 1/100th of 1%) for buyer's credit arrange for tenure up to three years. All cost ceiling includes arranger fee, upfront fee, management fee, handling and processing charges, out-of-pocket and legal expenses, if any.

The above ceiling got revised on 15/11/2011 to 6 Month Libor + 350 {{Not a typo|bps}} and got further extended on 30/03/2012 till 30/09/2012. From 01-10-2012 Maximum cap of 6 Month Libor + 350 bsp has been extended till further review.

'''Carbon dioxide cleaning''' ('''CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cleaning''') comprises a family of methods for [[parts cleaning]] and [[sterilization (microbiology)|sterilization]], using [[carbon dioxide]] in its various [[phase (matter)|phases]].&lt;ref name=co2clean-methods/&gt; It is often preferred for use on delicate surfaces.&lt;ref name=co2clean-main/&gt;&lt;ref name=coldjet-main/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sherman/&gt;{{rp|275}} CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cleaning has found application in the [[aerospace manufacturer|aerospace]], [[automotive industry|automotive]], [[Electronics manufacturing services|electronics]], [[Health care industry|medical]], and other industries.&lt;ref name=co2clean-applications/&gt;&lt;ref name=coldjet-industries/&gt; Carbon dioxide snow cleaning has been used to remove particles and organic residues from metals, [[polymer]]s, [[ceramic]]s, [[glass]]es, and other materials, and from surfaces including [[hard drive]]s and [[lens (optics)|optical surfaces]].&lt;ref name=Sherman/&gt;{{rp|270}}

==Applications==
{{co2}} cleaning has found application in many industries and technical areas, including aerospace, automotive, electronics, medical, manufacturing, basic and applied research, and [[optics]].&lt;ref name=co2clean-applications/&gt;&lt;ref name=coldjet-industries/&gt; The different carbon dioxide cleaning methods can remove gross contamination, [[paint]], [[overlayer]]s, [[grease (lubricant)|grease]], [[fingerprint]]s, particles down to nanometers in size, [[hydrocarbon]] and [[organic compound|organic]] [[Residue (chemistry)|residue]]s, and [[radioactive]] residues.  Materials cleaned include metals, polymers, ceramics, and glasses.&lt;ref name=Sherman/&gt;{{rp|270}} The key limitation is that the contamination must be on the surface, not buried within the material.  Porous materials are not good candidates for pellets or snow, but can be cleaned using liquid or supercritical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

==Methods==
Carbon dioxide cleaning refers to several different methods for parts cleaning, making use of all phases of {{co2}}:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.co2clean.com/#!afm/cfrpf|title=co2clean|website=co2clean|access-date=2016-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; basic methods include solid [[dry ice]] pellets, liquid {{co2}}, {{co2}} snow (a hybrid method), and [[supercritical fluid|supercritical]] {{co2}}. The different forms of {{co2}} cleaning can clean many types of objects, from large generators to small and delicate parts, including hard drives and optics.&lt;ref name=Sherman/&gt;{{rp|270}}

=== Pellets ===
[[Image:Bakerycleaning.jpg|thumb|Dry-ice blasting used to clean bakery equipment]]
In pellet cleaning ("[[dry-ice blasting]]"), relatively large pellets of solid CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are fired at the surface to be cleaned. These pellets impinge on the surface, mechanically dislodging contaminant particles. Pellet cleaning is only appropriate for surfaces which can withstand significant impacts.&lt;ref name=co2clean-methods/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sherman/&gt;{{rp|276}}

===Snow cleaning===
In CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; snow cleaning, compressed liquid or gaseous [[carbon dioxide]] is expelled from a nozzle, condensing into a mixture of solid particles and gas, which impact the surface to be cleaned.&lt;ref name=co2clean-methods/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sherman/&gt;{{rp|276}} Jet velocities are frequently supersonic.&lt;ref name=coldjet-how/&gt; Snow cleaning works by a combination of momentum transfer (mechanically dislodging contaminant particles) and [[solvent]] action.&lt;ref name=co2clean-methods/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sherman/&gt;{{rp|273}} The CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; [[sublimation (phase transition)|sublimates]] on contact, increasing in volume up to 800 times, thereby generating pressure to sweep particles away.&lt;ref name=coldjet-how/&gt; The CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; also dissolves hydrocarbon contaminants, and its low temperature [[wikt:embrittlement|embrittles]] residues such as fingerprints, making them easier to blow away.&lt;ref name=co2clean-main/&gt;&lt;ref name=fraunhofer-gesellschaft/&gt;

Snow cleaning has found application in the [[aerospace manufacturer|aeronautical]], [[automotive industry|automotive]], [[medical device|medical]], [[optics|optical]], [[semiconductor device fabrication|semiconductor]], and [[space industry|space]] industries. It can provide a gentle cleaning, appropriate for delicate surfaces.&lt;ref name=co2clean-main/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sherman/&gt;{{rp|270}}&lt;ref name=fraunhofer-gesellschaft/&gt; The effectiveness of carbon dioxide snow cleaning has been demonstrated via light [[microscopy]], particle counting, [[scanning electron microscope|scanning electron microscopy]], [[microprobe|microprobing]], [[X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy]], [[atomic-force microscopy]],&lt;ref name=co2clean-afm/&gt;&lt;ref name= Chernoff /&gt; and [[mass spectroscopy]].&lt;ref name=Sherman/&gt;{{rp|279}}

Equipment costs for a carbon dioxide snow cleaning system can range from US$1500 for a basic system to $50,000 for a high-end automated unit.&lt;ref name=Sherman/&gt;{{rp|292}} Material costs are comparatively low, although ultra-pure CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; must often be used to avoid the introduction of new contaminants.

===Supercritical fluid===
At temperatures and pressures above its [[Critical point (thermodynamics)|critical point]], CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; can be maintained as a [[supercritical fluid]], exhibiting extremely low [[viscosity]] and high [[solvent|solvency]]. To apply this method, parts to be cleaned are enclosed in a pressure vessel that is then filled with supercritical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. This method is appropriate for small and delicate parts such as microelectronics, and is not ideal for particulate removal.&lt;ref name=Ober/&gt;&lt;ref name=co2clean-methods/&gt; Aside from cleaning, applications of [[supercritical carbon dioxide]] include targeted chemical [[extraction (chemistry)|supercritical fluid extraction]] and materials processing.

===Liquid CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; washing===
Liquid CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; washing, like supercritical fluid CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; washing, relies on the high solvent power of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&lt;ref name=Sherman/&gt;{{rp|275}} but at lower temperatures and pressures, the latter making it simpler to implement. Because liquid CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; does not have the solvent power of supercritical fluid, agitation and [[surfactant]]s may be added to improve the effectiveness of the method.&lt;ref name=co2clean-methods/&gt;  Liquid CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; has been used in [[dry cleaning]] and machined parts [[solvent degreasing|degreasing]].

==History==
Carbon dioxide cleaning was contemplated in the 1930s, and the "pellet" approach was developed in the 1970s by E.E. Rice, C.H. Franklin, and C.C. Wong.&lt;ref name=Sherman/&gt;{{rp|276}}

The introduction of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; snow cleaning, with its ability to remove sub-micron-scale particles, is credited to Stuart Hoenig of the [[University of Arizona]], who first published on the topic in 1985-1986.&lt;ref name=Sherman/&gt;{{rp|277}}&lt;ref name=US5125979/&gt; Hoenig traveled the US to demonstrate the technology, eventually attracting the interest of [[The BOC Group]], which developed [[Venturi tube|Venturi nozzle]]s for the process, and [[Hughes Aircraft Company|Hughes Aircraft]], which developed straight nozzles.&lt;ref name=co2clean-faqs/&gt; CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; snow cleaning was further developed by the [[Fraunhofer Society|Fraunhofer Institute for Manufacturing Engineering and Automation IPA]], for the purpose of removing [[paint]] from aircraft [[fuselage]]s.&lt;ref name=fraunhofer-gesellschaft/&gt;

Nozzle design is the most significant factor in carbon dioxide snow cleaning performance, affecting the size and velocity of the dry ice particles.&lt;ref name=Sherman/&gt;{{rp|277–278}} Variations in nozzle design have been developed by W.H. Whitlock, L.L. Layden, Applied Surface Technologies, and Sierra Systems Group.&lt;ref name=Sherman/&gt;{{rp|277}}

==Issues==

===Safety===
CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cleaning may present certain safety risks. If the process is used to remove hazardous materials, precautions must be taken to avoid exposure to these materials in the vent stream. Because the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; stream is [[cryogenic]], it may cause injury with direct skin contact. In addition, care must be taken to prevent the concentration of carbon dioxide in the work area from [[hypercapnia|exceeding safe levels]].&lt;ref name=Sherman/&gt;{{rp|272}}&lt;ref name=co2clean-safety/&gt;

===Contamination===
Some commercial grades of carbon dioxide may contain traces of heavy [[hydrocarbon]]s, which can be left behind on the surface being cleaned. Abrasive particles originating in the cleaning equipment itself may need to be filtered out as well. The low temperature of the carbon dioxide stream can also induce moisture [[condensation]] on the part, which may be mitigated with [[hot plates]], [[heat gun]]s, [[infrared lamp|heat lamp]]s, or [[dry box]]es.&lt;ref name=Sherman/&gt;{{rp|292–294}}

===Static charge===
[[Ionization]] caused by the flowing gas can result in potentially damaging [[static charge]] buildup on non-[[Electrical resistivity and conductivity|conductive]] parts. This can be mitigated by [[Ground (electricity)|grounding]] or positive ionization sources.&lt;ref name=Sherman/&gt;{{rp|294}}

'''''Chiropractic Economics''''' is an [[United States|American]] [[magazine]] published 20 times a year in [[Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida]]. The magazine provides news and information for practicing [[chiropractic|chiropractor]]s, with a focus on office management, patient relations, personal development, financial planning, legal, clinical and research data, and wellness/nutrition.

== Overview ==
The first issue of ''Chiropractic Economics'' was published in 1954 as the ''Digest of Chiropractic Economics'' by William L. Luckey and Helen C. Luckey.

The magazine conducts two [[Survey methodology|surveys]] on a yearly basis; the ''Annual Salary and Expense Survey'' and the ''Annual Fees and Reimbursements Survey'' have been used by the [[United States Department of Labor]] to compile wage [[statistics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Occupational Outlook Handbook - Chiropractors | work=www.bls.gov |url=http://www.bls.gov/ooh/healthcare/chiropractors.htm#tab-5 |accessdate=2013-04-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130401174403/http://www.bls.gov/ooh/healthcare/chiropractors.htm#tab-5 |archive-date=7 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Chiropractic Economics'' started a website in 1996, billing itself as the "Online Chiropractic Community". The site now features chiropractic news, videos, blogs, book reviews, a job board, and current and past magazine content.

According to the 2015 BPA Worldwide audit of Chiropractic Economics subscriber list, total qualified circulation is 29,174 subscriptions.

'''''Chris Sawyer's Locomotion''''' is a [[video game]] by [[Independent video game developer|independent]] [[video game developer|game developer]] [[Chris Sawyer|Chris Sawyer Productions]] from 2004. According to Sawyer, it is the "spiritual successor to ''[[Transport Tycoon]]''".

==Gameplay==
The game allows the player to use [[Rail transport|railroads]], [[tram]]s, [[truck|trucking lines]], [[buses]], [[airplanes]] and [[ships]] to earn money in a [[transport]] company between the years 1900 to 2100. It contains over 40 pre-designed scenarios and a scenario editor, and can also be played in multiplayer mode with another human-controlled competitor. The game is played in an 2D [[Isometric projection|isometric]] view like the other games by Chris Sawyer, particularly ''[[RollerCoaster Tycoon (video game)|RollerCoaster Tycoon]]'', which uses the [[Game engine|engine]] that was originally developed for ''[[Transport Tycoon]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Gamespot Staff|title=RollerCoaster Tycoon designer offers first details on new title|url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/2004/04/02/news_6092788.html|website=GameSpot|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091007050504/http://www.gamespot.com/news/2004/04/02/news_6092788.html|archivedate=7 Oct 2009|format=Interview|date=2 April 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The scenarios have five difficulty levels: Beginner, Easy, Medium, Challenging and Expert. Different objectives are available, some require the player to finish on a certain position in the company ranking list while others require the transportation of a specific amount of cargo. In some cases these objectives have additional limits, such as that the player must finish within a certain time limit. While many of the scenarios are fictional, some are based on real-world countries such as the United States, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.

In recent years, several add-ons have been created for the game, including hundreds of trains, trucks, airplanes and other vehicles. Some people have used special programs to convert [[Microsoft Train Simulator]] rolling stock for use in Locomotion.

==Development==
''Locomotion'' was developed by [[video game developer|game developer]] [[Chris Sawyer]] as "spiritual successor to ''[[Transport Tycoon]]''". The game was published and released by [[Atari]] in the U.S. on September 7, 2004 and a few days later in the rest of the world.

In 2013 an [[iOS]] version of ''Transport Tycoon''was released that uses the graphics from ''Locomotion''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/management-geeks-rejoice-as-transport-tycoon-arrives-on-ios/|title=Transport Tycoon Review: Infrastructure Has Never Been So Fun|last=Brookes|first=Tim|date=14 October 2013|work=[[MakeUseOf]]|accessdate=24 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 17 2015, the game was re-released through [[digital distribution]] on [[Steam (software)|Steam]] and [[gog.com]].

In January 2018, an [[Open-source software development|open-source]] project, based on ''OpenRCT2'' engine known as ''OpenLoco'', was launched to enhance the gameplay of ''Locomotion'', including fixing [[Software bug|bugs]], translating to more languages and allowing the game to run natively on [[macOS]] and [[Linux]]. In order to create an accurate [[Clone (computing)|clone]], the incrementally [[reverse engineer]]ed [[RollerCoaster_Tycoon_2|Roller Coaster Tycoon 2]] engine was used. OpenLoco features reduced limitations compared to the original, i.e disabling vehicle breakdowns, unlocked building options or using custom resolutions.

==Reception==
{{unsourced-section|date=August 2017}}
Reviews of the game were generally not favorable, with many noting that the game's [[user interface]] and [[artificial intelligence|AI]] were both poor in comparison to the original ''Transport Tycoon''.

The '''counting method''' ('''CM'''), also known as '''Ochberg's counting method''', is a therapeutic treatment designed to help with the desensitization of [[posttraumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD) symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.countingmethod.com/ The Counting Method official website]&lt;/ref&gt;  The method was designed by psychiatrist [[Frank Ochberg]] in the early 1990s.  Ochberg, who'd previously helped to define and characterize posttraumatic stress disorder, began using the CM in his private practice as a means of combating PTSD symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.countingmethod.com/ The Counting Method official website]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The method==

During the CM, the clinician asks the PTSD client to recall a traumatic memory while the clinician counts out loud to 100.  After the counting the client is asked to discuss their memory.  Subsequently, clinician and client work to reframe that traumatic memory and minimize or eliminate the discomfort associated with it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.giftfromwithin.org/html/counting.html "The Counting Method for Ameliorating Traumatic Memories". [[Frank Ochberg]]. Journal of Traumatic Stress, Vol.9 No.4 1996]&lt;/ref&gt;

==See also==
*[[Progressive counting (PC)]]

==Results==

A recent study sought to compare the CM to other existing forms of PTSD treatment.  The study divided 38 women among three forms of PTSD therapy, including the CM.  All three treatments worked very well in minimizing PTSD symptoms; additionally, the study showed that the CM may be as effective as other pre-established techniques in the treatment of PTSD.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.countingmethod.com/images/The_Counting_Method_as_Exposure_Therapy.pdf "The Counting Method as Exposure Therapy: Revisions and Case Examples".

'''Elizabeth Wharton "Bessie" Drexel Hope de la Poer Beresford, Baroness Decies''' (April 22, 1868 – June 13, 1944) was an American author and [[Manhattan]] socialite.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

== Birth ==
She was born on April 22, 1868 in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]] to Lucy Wharton (1841–1912) and [[Joseph William Drexel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Mrs. J.W. Drexel Dead. Former Social Leader of Philadelphia and Mother of Mrs. Harry Lehr. |quote= |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=January 26, 1912}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joseph was the son of [[Francis Martin Drexel]], the immigrant ancestor of the Drexel banking family in the United States.

== Career ==
[[File:Drexel-Elizabeth 013.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Drexel and [[Henry Symes Lehr|Lehr]] at their wedding, 1901]]
Elizabeth was an author, who published two books, ''"King Lehr" and the Gilded Age'' (1935) and ''Turn of the World'' (1937). Her first novel, published after the death of her second husband, was described as follows in ''[[Time Magazine]]'', "A bitter, disillusioned book, 'King Lehr' is memorable for the lurid light it throws on U. S. Society of the Gilded Age, may confidently be opened as one of the most startling and scandalously intimate records of life among the wealthy yet written by one of them." It tells the story of her unhappy marriage to Lehr, which was referred to as a "tragic farce" of a 28-year marriage.&lt;ref name=time1/&gt;

As with her first book, her second, and first as Lady Decies, ''Turn of the World'' was a fascinating semi-autobiographical history of American high society during the [[Gay Nineties]] up through the [[first World War]].  Upon the book's publication, [[The Pittsburgh Press]] wrote, "The magnificent spectacle that went on behind the scenes in pre-war days of society's Gilded Age at Saratoga, Newport, New York and Paris is detailed by an insider, Elizabeth, Lady Decies, who was Miss Elizabeth Wharton Drexel interesting, amusing and sometimes revolting, as with evident nostalgia she tells of extravagant parties and fortunes spent for clothes and jewels."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Former Mrs. Lehr|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1937/12/12/archives/the-former-mrs-lehr.html|accessdate=23 February 2017|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=12 December 1937}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''GAO Human Capital Reform Act''' of 2004 ({{USStatute|108|271|118|811|2004|07|07}}) is a [[United States federal law]] designed to provide new [[human capital]] flexibilities with respect to the [[Government Accountability Office]], and for other purposes.  The most visible provision of the law was to change the name of the organization from the General Accounting Office, which it had been known as since its founding in 1921, to the Government Accountability Office.  Besides the name change, the law:

* Decouples GAO from the federal employee pay system,
* Establishes a compensation system that places greater emphasis on job performance while protecting the purchasing power of employees  who are performing acceptably,
* Gives GAO permanent authority to offer voluntary early retirement opportunities and voluntary separation payments (buy-outs),
* Provides greater flexibility for reimbursing employees for relocation benefits,
* Allows certain employees and officers with less than three years of federal service to earn increased amounts of annual leave, and
* Authorizes an exchange program with private sector organizations.

'''Henry A. G. Lee''' (c. 1818 – 1851) was a soldier and politician in [[Oregon Country]] in the 1840s. A member of Virginia’s Lee family, he was part of the [[John C. Frémont|Fremont Expedition]] and commanded troops during the [[Cayuse War]] in what became the [[Oregon Territory]]. He also was a member of the [[Oregon Provisional Government]] and the second editor of the ''[[Oregon Spectator]]''.

==Early life==
Lee was born in [[Virginia]], circa 1818.&lt;ref name=Oregon&gt;Corning, Howard M. ''Dictionary of Oregon History''. Binfords &amp; Mort Publishing, 1956.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1843, Lee was a part of [[John C. Frémont]]’s Army expedition through the Western United States, including what is now the state of Oregon.&lt;ref name=pioneers&gt;Flora, Stephenie. [http://www.oregonpioneers.com/1843.htm Emigrants to Oregon in 1843.] Oregon Pioneers, accessed September 25, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; During the expedition he was sent with a note to [[Kit Carson]] ordering Carson to catch up to the group, and later when the party split into two Lee remained with Fremont before returning to Oregon on September 22.&lt;ref name=pioneers/&gt;

==Oregon Country==
After settling in Oregon, Lee was elected to the [[Provisional Legislature of Oregon]] in 1845.&lt;ref name=prov1845b&gt;[https://sos.oregon.gov/archives/Pages/records/legislators_guide.aspx Oregon Legislative Assembly (1st Provisional) 1845 Regular Session]&lt;/ref&gt; He represented the [[Clackamas County, Oregon|Clackamas District]] and served as Speaker of the body for part of the December session.&lt;ref name=prov1845b/&gt; In 1846, Lee became the second editor of the ''[[Oregon Spectator]]'', the first newspaper in the region.&lt;ref name=Oregon/&gt; He replaced [[William G. T'Vault]] and would remain editor for nine issues of the paper before [[George Law Curry]] took over the position.&lt;ref name=Oregon/&gt;

===Cayuse War===
{{main|Cayuse War}}
On November 29, 1847, the [[Whitman Mission]] near present day [[Walla Walla, Washington]], was attacked by members of the [[Cayuse people|Cayuse tribe]] in the [[Whitman Massacre]]. This led to further violence in the ensuing [[Cayuse War]] prosecuted by the [[Provisional Government of Oregon]] and later the United States government against the Native Americans in what became the [[Oregon Territory]] in 1848. In December 1847 when word of the attack reached the [[Willamette Valley]], the Provisional Government and Gov. [[George Abernethy]] called for volunteers to fight against the Cayuse, with Lee volunteering and being selected as captain of a 50-man unit to be dispatched immediately to [[The Dalles, Oregon|The Dalles]].&lt;ref name=Oregon/&gt; The [[Oregon Rifles]] under the command of Lee formed on December 8, and gathered at [[Fort Vancouver]] on December 10 where they purchased supplies from the [[Hudson’s Bay Company]] (HBC) post.&lt;ref name=fagan&gt;Fagan, David D. 1885.

Fagan.&lt;/ref&gt; The HBC would not extend credit to the Provisional Government, so the volunteer soldiers pledged their individual credit in order to purchase supplies with the hope that the government would be able to repay them at a later time.&lt;ref name=gs&gt;[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/ops/rogue-river-war.htm Rogue River War.] GlobalSecurity.org, accessed September 25, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The group was to protect the [[Methodist Mission]] there and prevent any hostile forces from reaching the Willamette Valley.&lt;ref name=Oregon/&gt;

While preparation were made for war, the Provisional Government also attempted to negotiate with the Cayuse and other tribes.&lt;ref name=Oregon/&gt; Lee was appointed as one of the peace commissioners, along with [[Joel Palmer]] and [[Robert Newell (Oregon politician)|Robert Newell]] to seek a truce with the Cayuse and demand they turn over the killers from the massacre at the start of hostilities.&lt;ref&gt;[https://sos.oregon.gov/blue-book/Pages/facts/history/pre-cayuse.aspx Oregon Blue Book: Oregon History: Cayuse Indian War.] Oregon Secretary of State, accessed September 25, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Lee and his troops, with John E. Ross and Joseph Magone as lieutenants, then marched off to The Dalles, arriving on December 21.&lt;ref name=fagan/&gt; Upon arriving there, Lee led his men against a band of Native Americans and drove them off, but not before they stole 300 head of cattle.&lt;ref name=gs/&gt; There the troops built a stockade and named the post [[Fort Dalles|Fort Lee]] for the commander, though the small fortification was also called Fort Wascopam.&lt;ref name=Oregon/&gt; Lee’s forces continued defending the [[Wascopam Mission]] and settlers until Colonel [[Cornelius Gilliam]] arrived with a larger force in February 1848, at which point Lee became third in command after Gilliam and Lieutenant-Colonel James Waters.&lt;ref name=fagan/&gt;

With a larger force, the militia forces pressed east towards the [[Whitman Mission]], with Lee commanding some troops and carrying out reconnaissance.&lt;ref name=fagan/&gt; By March 4 the forces reached the mission after a battle at [[Battle of Sand Hollows|Sand Hollows]]. After reaching the mission, Gilliam set out for The Dalles with a small force to supply that settlement, before continuing to Oregon City to report to the governor when he was accidentally shot and killed.&lt;ref name=fagan/&gt; Lee continued west with Gilliam’s body and was promoted to Colonel before returning to the front.&lt;ref name=fagan/&gt; Once at the front he discovered that the troops had elected Waters as Colonel, so Lee resigned as colonel and took the role as a subordinate to Waters.&lt;ref name=fagan/&gt;

==Later life==
After leaving the war, Governor Abernethy appointed Lee as superintendent of Indian Affairs in 1848.&lt;ref name=Oregon/&gt; In 1849, he sought his fortune in the gold mines of the [[California Gold Rush]].&lt;ref name=Oregon/&gt; He successfully mined there before returning to Oregon and setting up business in [[Oregon City, Oregon|Oregon City]] in 1850. That year Lee traveled by ship to New York to acquire inventory for his store, but died of Panama fever on his return to Oregon in 1851.&lt;ref name=Oregon/&gt;

'''Investor-state dispute settlement''' ('''ISDS''') or '''investment court system''' ('''ICS''') is a system through which investors can sue countries for alleged discriminatory practices. ISDS is an instrument of [[public international law]] and provisions are contained in a number of [[Bilateral Investment Treaty|bilateral investment treaties]], in certain international [[trade treaty|trade treaties]], such as [[North American Free Trade Agreement|NAFTA]] (chapter 11), and the proposed [[Trans-Pacific Partnership|TPP]] (chapter 9) and [[Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement|CETA]] (sections 3 and 4) agreements. ISDS is also found in [[international investment agreement]]s, such as the [[Energy Charter Treaty]]. If an investor from one country (the "home state") invests in another country (the "host state"), both of which have agreed to ISDS, and the host state violates the rights granted to the investor under the treaty, then that investor may bring the matter before an [[arbitral tribunal]].

While ISDS is often associated with [[international arbitration]] under the rules of ICSID (the [[International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes]] of the [[World Bank]]), it often takes place under the auspices of international arbitral tribunals governed by different rules or institutions, such as the [[London Court of International Arbitration]], the [[International Chamber of Commerce]], the [[Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre]] or the [[UNCITRAL]] Arbitration Rules.

== Foreign investment protection ==
=== Historical development ===
Under [[customary international law]] a state can vindicate injury caused to its nation by the host state by exercising [[diplomatic protection]], which may include [[retorsion]] and/or [[reprisals]]. In addition to diplomatic protection and to avoid having to resort to coercive means, states can and do establish ad hoc commissions and [[arbitral tribunal]]s to adjudicate claims involving treatment of foreign nationals and their property by the Host State ("state-state-dispute-settlement", SSDS). Notable examples of this practice are the [[Jay Treaty]] commissions, the [[Iran–United States Claims Tribunal]] and the [[American-Mexican Claims Commission]].&lt;ref name="NewcombeParadell" /&gt; However, these treaties were limited to the treatment of foreign investors during a past period of time, whereas modern ISDS allows investors to make claims against states in general and on a prospective basis.

=== Modern practice ===
Currently, the legal protection of [[Foreign Direct Investment]] under [[public international law]] is guaranteed by a network of more than 2750 [[Bilateral Investment Treaty|bilateral investment treaties]] (BITs), Multilateral Investment Treaties, most notably the [[Energy Charter Treaty]] and number of Free Trade Agreements such as [[NAFTA]] containing a chapter on investment protection. Most of these treaties were signed by states in the late 1980s and early 1990s, before the current explosion of investor claims under the treaties began in the late 1990s.

The majority of these legal instruments provides foreign investors with a substantive legal protection (including the right to "fair and equitable treatment", "full protection and security", "free transfer of means" and the right not to be directly or indirectly expropriated without full compensation) and access to ISDS for redress against Host States for breaches of such protection. Some of these standards are framed in vague terms, given extensive discretion to arbitrators in their interpretation and application. The overall number of known cases reached over 500 in 2012. Of these, 244 were concluded, of which approximately 42% were decided in favour of the Host State and approximately 31% in favour of the investor. Approximately 27% of the cases were settled out of court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unctad.org/en/PublicationsLibrary/webdiaepcb2013d3_en.pdf|format=PDF|title=Recent Developments in Investor-State Disputes|publisher=Unctad.org|accessdate=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:NAFTA logo.png|right|150px|thumb|Chapter 11 of [[NAFTA]] includes an Investor-State provision.]]

Notably, only foreign investors can sue states under investment treaties, because states are the parties to the treaty, and only states can be held liable to pay damages for breach of the treaty. States have no corresponding right to bring an original claim against a foreign investor under such treaties, again because investors are not parties to the treaty and therefore cannot be in breach of it. Thus, a decision in favour of the State means that the state has not been ordered to pay compensation, not that it has received any compensation from the investor, although costs can be awarded against the investor. A state cannot "win" in ISDS in the manner of a foreign investor - a state which wishes to sue a foreign investor does so through its own domestic courts, without the need for a treaty.

ISDS cannot overturn local laws (unlike the [[World Trade Organization]]) which violate trade agreements,&lt;ref name=":23"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://piie.com/publications/piie-briefings/assessing-trans-pacific-partnership-volume-1-market-access-and-sectoral|title=Assessing the Trans-Pacific Partnership, Volume 1: Market Access and Sectoral Issues {{!}} PIIE|website=piie.com|access-date=22 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":27"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibanet.org/Document/Default.aspx?DocumentUid=f30e1893-08fb-4c8e-93bd-eac8442faf5e|title=Investor-state dispute settlement: the importance of an informed, fact-based debate|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=International Bar Association|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but can grant monetary damages to investors adversely affected by such laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jun/10/obscure-legal-system-lets-corportations-sue-states-ttip-icsid|title=The obscure legal system that lets corporations sue countries|date=10 June 2015|publisher=The Guardian|author=Claire Provost and Matt Kennard|accessdate=22 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Office of the United States Trade Representative]], ISDS requires specific treaty violations, and does not allow corporations to sue solely over "lost profits".&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ustr.gov/about-us/policy-offices/press-office/blog/2015/march/isds-important-questions-and-answers|title=ISDS: Important Questions and Answers {{!}} United States Trade Representative|website=ustr.gov|access-date=20 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, such violations may be difficult to foresee, and the threat of exorbitant fines may cause a [[chilling effect]] which halts regulation or legislation in the public interest (e.g. human health and environmental protection).&lt;ref name="SCint"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/933590566|title=Shadow courts : the tribunals that rule global trade|last=Sweetland,|first=Edwards, Haley|publisher=Colombia Global Reports|year=2016|isbn=9780997126402|location=|pages=Chapter: Introduction|oclc=933590566}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics also state that treaties are written so that any legislation causing lost profits is per definition a treaty violation, rendering the argument null that only treaty violations are subject to ISDS.&lt;ref name="SCint"/&gt;

==== NAFTA Chapter 11 ====
{{main|North American Free Trade Agreement}}
A notable example of ISDS, which has been in existence for two decades now, is Chapter 11 of the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA). NAFTA Chapter 11 allows investors of one NAFTA party (Canada, United States or Mexico) to bring claims directly against the government of another NAFTA party before an international [[arbitral tribunal]]. Because NAFTA Article 1121 waives the local remedies rule, investors are not required to exhaust local remedies before filing Chapter 11 claims. While this fact has been amply criticized in public, proponents of ISDS tend to point out that speedy dispute resolution through ISDS is critical in modern economic environments and would be defeated by adding several instances of local remedies. On the other hand, there is no other situation in international law where a private party can sue a state without showing that the state's domestic courts are not independent or reliable. The removal of the customary duty to exhaust local remedies, where they are reasonably available, is claimed to be a factor in the explosion of investment treaty claims since the late 1990s, although a more obvious explanation is the explosion in the number of bilateral free trade agreements since the breakdown of the multilateral WTO Doha round in the mid 2000s.

Investors may initiate an arbitration against the NAFTA Party under the Arbitration Rules of the [[United Nations Commission on International Trade Law]] ("UNCITRAL Rules") or under the Rules of the [[International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes]] ("ICSID Rules"). NAFTA Chapter 11 was the first instance of an ISDS provision receiving widespread public attention, especially in the United States in the wake of the [[Methanex]] case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/s/l/c5818.htm|title=Methanex Corp. v.

=== TTIP ===
Resistance from the EU side to the US proposal to include an ISDS clause in the draft [[Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership]] treaty was such as to cause this element to be abandoned in September 2015. In its place, the [[European Commission]] proposed an investment court system (ICS).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://euobserver.com/economic/130297|title=EU proposes new trade court with US|last=Nielsen|first=Nikolaj|date=16 September 2015|website=EUobserver|access-date=23 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.greenpeace.org/eu-unit/Global/eu-unit/reports-briefings/2016/2016_02_11_Greenpeace%20Position%20Paper%20ICS_Final.pdf|title=From ISDS to ICS: A Leopard Can't Change Its Spots|date=11 February 2016|publisher=Greenpeace Position Paper|page=1|access-date=23 February 2016|author=Greenpeace}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-15-5651_en.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Not long afterwards, ICS was declared illegal by the German Association of Magistrates,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://euobserver.com/economic/132142|title=TTIP investor court illegal, say German judges|last=Nielsen|first=Nikolaj|date=4 February 2016|website=EUobserver|access-date=6 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; though the Commission dismissed the magistrates' judgement as based on a misunderstanding.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://euobserver.com/economic/132295|title=EU defends TTIP investor court after German backlash|last=Nielsen|first=Nikolaj|date=17 February 2016|website=EUobserver|access-date=23 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; For its part, the United States wants ISDS reinstated.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Proponents of ISDS argue that governments retain their regulatory ability, if the agreements in question specify that regulations protecting health, the environment, labour rights and human rights are allowed. The [[Office of the United States Trade Representative]] challenges the notion that ISDS challenges "the sovereign ability of governments impose any measure they wish to protect labor rights, the environment, or other issues of public welfare".&lt;ref name=":152"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ustr.gov/about-us/policy-offices/press-office/blog/2015/march/isds-important-questions-and-answers|title=ISDS: Important Questions and Answers {{!}} United States Trade Representative|website=ustr.gov|access-date=20 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Bar Association|International Bar Association (IBA)]] mirrors these sentiments, noting that "while investment treaties limit states’ ability to inflict arbitrary or discriminatory treatment, they do not limit (and, in fact, expressly safeguard) a state’s sovereign right to regulate in the public interest in a fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory manner."&lt;ref name=":272"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibanet.org/Document/Default.aspx?DocumentUid=f30e1893-08fb-4c8e-93bd-eac8442faf5e|title=Investor-state dispute settlement: the importance of an informed, fact-based debate|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=International Bar Association|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[White House Office|White House]] notes that investment protections are a component of more than 3,000 trade agreements, the vast majority of which have some form of neutral arbitration.&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2015/02/26/investor-state-dispute-settlement-isds-questions-and-answers|title=Investor-State Dispute Settlement (ISDS) Questions and Answers|date=26 February 2015|access-date=22 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States is party to at least 50 such agreements, has only faced 13 ISDS cases and never lost an ISDS case.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;

The [[Peterson Institute for International Economics]] claims that ISDS provisions are necessary, as they boost investment: "empirical evidence has shown that treaties including these provisions have a positive effect on foreign direct investment (FDI) flows between signatory countries."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://piie.com/blogs/trade-investment-policy-watch/what-do-data-say-about-relationship-between-investor-state|title=What Do the Data Say about the Relationship between Investor-State Dispute Settlement Provisions and FDI? {{!}} PIIE|website=piie.com|access-date=22 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; PIIE challenges the claim that ISDS "arbitrators lack integrity", noting that arbitrators take an oath of impartiality and both sides of a case choose arbitrators.&lt;ref name=":232"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://piie.com/publications/piie-briefings/assessing-trans-pacific-partnership-volume-1-market-access-and-sectoral|title=Assessing the Trans-Pacific Partnership, Volume 1: Market Access and Sectoral Issues {{!}} PIIE|website=piie.com|access-date=22 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a February 2016 op-ed against the TPP, Senator [[Elizabeth Warren]] used the example of a French company suing Egypt because Egypt raised its minimum wage as an argument against the ISDS provisions of the TPP.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The Washington Post editorial board has however challenged this characterization of the case, noting that "[[Veolia]] of France, a waste management company, invoked ISDS to enforce a contract with the government of [[Alexandria|Alexandria, Egypt]], that it says required compensation if costs increased; the company maintains that the wage increases triggered this provision. Incidentally, Veolia was working with Alexandria on a [[World Bank]]-supported project to reduce greenhouse gases, not some corporate plot to exploit the people. The case — which would result, at most, in a monetary award to Veolia, not the overthrow of the minimum wage — remains in litigation."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/dont-buy-the-trade-deal-alarmism/2015/03/11/41575fee-c1d5-11e4-9271-610273846239_story.html|title=Don’t buy the trade deal alarmism|last=Board|first=Editorial|date=11 March 2015|access-date=1 August 2016|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286|newspaper=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[International Bar Association|International Bar Association (IBA)]], states have won a higher percentage of ISDS cases than investors, and that around one-third of all cases end in settlement.&lt;ref name=":273"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibanet.org/Document/Default.aspx?DocumentUid=f30e1893-08fb-4c8e-93bd-eac8442faf5e|title=Investor-state dispute settlement: the importance of an informed, fact-based debate|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=International Bar Association|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Claimant investors, when successful, recover on average less than half of what the amounts claimed.&lt;ref name=":273" /&gt; IBA notes that "only 8 per cent of ISDS proceedings are commenced by very large multinational corporations."&lt;ref name=":273" /&gt; IBA challenges the notion that ISDS is biased against developing countries, noting that there is "no correlation between the success rates of claims against states and their income levels or development status."&lt;ref name=":273" /&gt; IBA notes that ISDS is necessary even in countries with sophisticated domestic legal systems because those domestic courts rule according to domestic laws, not international law.&lt;ref name=":273" /&gt; IBA notes that "increasingly, awards require the losing party to pay arbitration costs and legal fees to the winning party", which deters investors from initiating unmeritorious cases.&lt;ref name=":273" /&gt;

A 2017 study found that the success rates of investors in investor-state disputes has sharply fallen over time because most legal challenges today seek compensation for regulation implemented by democracies, not expropriation by non-democracies.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pelc|first=Krzysztof J.|date=31 May 2017|title=What Explains the Low Success Rate of Investor-State Disputes?|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/international-organization/article/what-explains-the-low-success-rate-of-investorstate-disputes/7AE6CEA67B5A0FADAE3B11703C4A1442|journal=International Organization|pages=1–25|doi=10.1017/S0020818317000212|issn=0020-8183}}&lt;/ref&gt; The author of the study argues that the likely goal of investors is not to obtain compensation through ISDS, but to impose costs on governments contemplating regulations and therefore deter the regulatory ambitions of governments.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Transparency ===
Opponents of ISDS argue that arbitrations are sometimes carried out in secret by trade lawyers who do not enjoy the typical safeguards of judicial independence and procedural fairness, who earn income only if a case is brought and proceeds, and who are not accountable to the public or required to take into account broader constitutional and international law human rights norms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://justinvestment.org/2011/05/oecd-document-discusses-investor-state-dispute-settlement/ Van Harten, Gus. "OECD Document Discusses Investor State Dispute Settlement".] Accessed: 7 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Peterson Institute for International Economics]] agrees "that secrecy has gone too far" in many ISDS cases, but notes that agreements such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership did ensure greater transparency in ISDS.&lt;ref name=":232" /&gt; Proponents of ISDS point out that confidentiality is a standard feature of all [[arbitration]] and one that enables a constructive, de-politicized and fact-oriented atmosphere of dispute resolution. On the other hand, such traditional confidentiality is limited to disputes that affect the parties in question and not the broader public. Also, most ICSID awards, although confidential, are de facto published by consent of the parties. However, many awards under other arbitration rules are not public and, in the case of investor-arbitration at the International Chamber of Commerce, there is a requirement for blanket confidentiality for all aspects of a case.

It is further pointed out that judges are not elected in most countries outside the US, so that "public accountability of judges" may not be considered a standard of [[public international law]]. In any event, they say, the qualification of ISDS arbitrators matches or exceeds the qualification of most court judges.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} In response, critics make the point that any judge, whether domestic or international, who is part of a legal system not shown to be systematically biased or unreliable, has a greater claim to independence than an arbitrator because they are insulated from conflicts of interest that arise when arbitrators work on the side as lawyers, and is assigned cases in an objective manner rather than by the discretion of a disputing party or an executive official. Arbitrators are appointed by both parties at dispute, so such conflicts of interest may arise on both sides.

While ISDS has traditionally been confidential as any other [[arbitration]], the general trend in the last decade has been to allow for more openness and transparency. On the other hand, there is still widespread confidentiality in the system.

Under Art. 29 of the U.S. Model-BIT of 2004, all documents pertaining to ISDS have to be made public and [[amicus curiae]] briefs are allowed. However, no investment treaty allows other parties who have an interest in the dispute, other than the claimant investor and respondent government, to obtain [[standing (law)|standing]] in the adjudicative process.

Under the [[Trans-Pacific Strategic Economic Partnership]], the tribunals shall, subject to the consent of the disputing parties, conduct hearings open to the public. The tribunal will make available to the public documents relating to the dispute such as the notice of intent, the notice of arbitration, pleadings, memorials, minutes or transcripts of the hearings of the tribunal, where available; orders, awards and decisions of the tribunal. In addition, third parties can and increasingly do participate in investor-state arbitration by submitting ''[[amicus curiae]]'' petitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://icsid.worldbank.org/ICSID/StaticFiles/basicdoc/partF-chap04.htm#r37 |title=ICSID, Arbitration Rules |publisher=Icsid.worldbank.org |date= |accessdate=2013-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[World Bank]]'s [[International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes]] (ICSID) is required by ICSID Administrative and Financial Regulation 22 to make public, information on the registration of all requests for arbitration and to indicate in due course the date and method of the termination of each proceeding. It also publishes the vast majority of awards with the consent of the parties. If the parties do not consent, ICSID publishes excerpts showing the tribunal's reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://icsid.worldbank.org/ICSID/FrontServlet?requestType=CasesRH&amp;actionVal=ShowHome&amp;pageName=Cases_Home |title=International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes, ICSID Cases |publisher=Icsid.worldbank.org |date= |accessdate=2013-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ICSID website has published awards for most completed arbitrations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://icsid.worldbank.org/ICSID/FrontServlet?requestType=CasesRH&amp;reqFrom=Main&amp;actionVal=OnlineAward |title=International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes, View Decisions and Awards |publisher=Icsid.worldbank.org |date= |accessdate=2013-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and decisions in investor-state arbitrations outside of ICSID are also publicly available online.

On 1 April 2014, the [[UNCITRAL]] Rules on Transparency in Treaty-based Investor-State Arbitration entered into force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uncitral.org/pdf/english/texts/arbitration/rules-on-transparency/Rules-on-Transparency-E.pdf|format=PDF|title=UNCITRAL : Rules on Transparency in Treaty-based Investor-State Arbitration|publisher=Uncitral.org|accessdate=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Article 3 foresees a general duty to publish all documents pertaining to an ISDS-procedure under UNCITRAL Rules, where the treaty establishing the ISDS-mechanism has been concluded after 1 April 2014 or where the parties so consent, subject to certain overwhelming confidentiality interests listed in Article 7. Original proposals to make all UNCITRAL arbitration under investment treaties public were not adopted after opposition by some states and by representatives of the arbitration industry who participated in the UNCITRAL working group negotiations as state representatives.

On 17 March 2015, the United Nations Convention on Transparency in Treaty-based Investor-State Arbitration ('Mauritius Convention') was opened for signatures in Port Louis, Mauritius.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uncitral.org/uncitral/en/uncitral_texts/arbitration/2014Transparency_Convention.html|title=2014 - UNCITRAL Rules on Transparency in Treaty-based Investor-State Arbitration|work=uncitral.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Mauritius Convention will render the UNCITRAL Rules on Transparency in Treaty-based Investor State Arbitration also applicable to disputes arising out of investment treaties that were concluded prior to 1 April 2014 if both parties to the investment treaty are also party to the Mauritius Convention.&lt;ref&gt;Article 3, Mauritius Convention http://www.uncitral.org/pdf/english/texts/arbitration/transparency-convention/Transparency-Convention-e.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The Convention has not yet entered into force since the three required ratifications have not yet been submitted.&lt;ref name="uncitral.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uncitral.org/uncitral/en/uncitral_texts/arbitration/2014Transparency_Convention_status.html|title=Status|work=uncitral.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; 10 States have signed the Mauritius Convention so far.&lt;ref name="uncitral.org"/&gt;

== Tribunals ==
Investment disputes can be initiated by corporations and natural persons and in almost all cases, investment tribunals are composed of three arbitrators (unless otherwise agreed by the parties). As in most [[arbitration]]s, one is appointed by the investor, one by the state, and the third is usually chosen by agreement between the parties or their appointed arbitrators or selected by the appointing authority, depending on the procedural rules applicable to the dispute. If the parties do not agree who to appoint, this power is assigned to executive officials usually at the World Bank, the International Bureau of the Permanent Court of Arbitration, or a private chamber of commerce.

Other individuals cannot initiate a claim against a state under an investment treaty. Also, no individual or state can initiate a claim against a foreign investor under an investment treaty. This has led to criticisms that investor-state arbitration is not balanced and that it favours the "haves" over the "have nots" by giving foreign investors, especially major companies, access to a special tribunal outside any court. While the arbitration process itself does not provide explicitly privileged access for larger investors over individuals or SMEs, the costs of ISDS, as in any court or arbitration system, tend to be off-putting for smaller claimants.

== Examples ==
According to a May 2011 working paper, "In terms of wins and losses, [the] U.S. has never lost a case as the respondent country. U.S. investors have won 15 cases, lost 22 cases and settled 14 cases. In terms of performance with respect to developing countries, U.S. investors have won 14 cases and lost 17."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ageconsearch.umn.edu/bitstream/179093/2/11-01TreatyArbitrationReappraisal.pdf|title=Working Paper No. 11-01: Investment Treaty Arbitration and Developing Countries: A Re-Appraisal|authors=Kevin P.

; ''Ethyl Corporation v. Canada''

: In April 1997 the Canadian parliament banned the import and transport of [[Methylcyclopentadienyl manganese tricarbonyl|MMT]], a gasoline additive, over concerns that it poses a significant public health risk.

=== Cases won by government ===

; ''Apotex v. the United States''

: Under Chapter 11 of NAFTA, [[Apotex Inc.]], a Canadian pharmaceuticals corporation, has alleged that U.S. courts committed errors in interpreting federal law, and that such errors were in violation of NAFTA Article 1102 (national treatment) and Article 1105 (minimum standard of treatment under international law). [[Apotex]] also alleged that the challenged U.S. court decision in favor of the [[Pfizer]] drug company expropriated Apotex’s investments in generic versions of the antidepressant [[Zoloft]] under NAFTA Article 1110 as was manifestly unjust.&lt;ref name=apotex&gt;[https://www.state.gov/s/l/c27648.htm "Apotex Inc v USA", US Department of State.] Accessed: 12 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

: Apotex relied on the doctrine that a manifestly unjust domestic legal decision breaches international law and can be viewed as a substantive denial of justice.&lt;ref&gt;McFadden, M. 1995. "Provincialism in US Courts", ''[[Cornell Law Review]]'' 81:31 at 32.&lt;/ref&gt; Apotex has also brought a similar claim involving U.S. regulatory provisions concerning an abbreviated new drug development application for [[Pravastatin]] and patents allegedly held by [[Bristol Myers Squibb]].&lt;ref name=apotex /&gt; Apotex has two claims involving different generic products. On 14 June 2013, the Tribunal issued an Award on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, dismissing all of the claims and ordering Apotex to pay the United States' legal fees and arbitral expenses.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/s/l/c27648.htm "Apotex Inc. v. United States of America", US Department of State.] Accessed: 18 April 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

; ''Chemtura Corporation v. Canada''

: [[Chemtura Corporation]], a United States agricultural [[pesticide]] products manufacturer, alleged that the Canadian government's [[Pest Management Regulatory Agency]] (PMRA) wrongfully terminated its pesticide business in [[lindane]]-based products, which are used on [[canola]], [[rapeseed]], [[mustard seed]] and cole crops to control [[flea beetle]] infestations, and on cereal crops to control [[wireworm]]. Chemtura alleged NAFTA violations of Article 1105 (on minimum standards of treatment) and Article 1110 (on expropriation). All claims were dismissed by the Tribunal, given that the measure did not amount to a substantial deprivation of the Claimant's investment and was taken legitimately and without bad faith.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/s/l/c29737.htm "Chemtura Corp. v. Government of Canada", US Department of State.] Accessed: 12 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

; ''Philip Morris v. Uruguay''

: The [[Philip Morris v. Uruguay]] case (Spanish: [[:es:Caso Philip Morris contra Uruguay]]) started on 19 February 2010, when the multinational tobacco company Philip Morris International filed a complaint against Uruguay seeking $25 million in damages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=[[Alfred-Maurice de Zayas]]|title=How can Philip Morris sue Uruguay over its tobacco laws?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/nov/16/philip-morris-uruguay-tobacco-isds-human-rights|website=The Guardian|accessdate=22 October 2016|date=16 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company complained that Uruguay's anti-smoking legislation devalued its cigarette trademarks and investments in the country and based its lawsuit on the bilateral investment treaty between Switzerland and Uruguay. The [[International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes]] (ICSID), a part of the [[World Bank]] decided it had jurisdiction on 2 July 2013,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.italaw.com/sites/default/files/case-documents/italaw1531.pdf |title =Decision on Jurisdiction |date =4 July 2013|accessdate = 22 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and three years later ruled in favor of Uruguay, ordering Philip Morris to pay Uruguay $7 million, in addition to all court costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.reuters.com/article/us-pmi-uruguay-lawsuit-idUSKCN0ZO2LZ|title= Phillip Morris loses tough-on-tobacco lawsuit in Uruguay|date= 8 July 2016|accessdate= 9 July 2016|website= Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dismissed cases ===

; ''KT Asia Investment Group v. Kazakhstan''

: The claimant (company incorporated in Holland) was a shell company owned by Kazakh national (Mr. Ablyazov). It owned shares in BTA Bank, which the claimant alleged were nationalized by the respondent (Kazakhstan). The state position was that as owned by a Kazakh national the claimant was not eligible for investment protection under the Dutch-Kazakh BIT. This argument was dismissed by the Arbitrage. The Kazakh state than alleged that it didn’t nationalize the bank, but it bailed it out (wiping out the shares’ value in the process). The latter was due to the embezzlement of depositors’ trust (and funds) by Mr. Ablyazov. Investigating the matter the Arbitrage reached the conclusion that the investment doesn’t meet the Salini test, thus it is not protected under the BIT. As a result the Arbitrage decided it has no jurisdiction to decide the dispute.&lt;ref&gt;ICSID Case No. ARB/09/8 http://icsidfiles.worldbank.org/icsid/ICSIDBLOBS/OnlineAwards/C620/DC3912_En.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prospects for ISDS ==
After ISDS claims by investors sharply increased starting in the late 1990s, ISDS came under greater public attention and criticism. This was true for the NAFTA claims against the United States in the late 1990s, for Germany in the wake of the [[Vattenfall]] claims in the late 2000s and also for Australia in 2011, when confronted with the Philip Morris claim.&lt;ref name=economist-20141011&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21623756-governments-are-souring-treaties-protect-foreign-investors-arbitration |title=Investor-state dispute settlement - The arbitration game |newspaper=The Economist |date=11 October 2014 |accessdate=1 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the Australian government announced that it would discontinue the practice of seeking inclusion of investor state dispute settlement provisions in trade agreements with developing countries. It stated that it:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"...supports the principle of national treatment — that foreign and domestic businesses are treated equally under the law. However, the Government does not support provisions that would confer greater legal rights on foreign businesses than those available to domestic businesses. Nor will the Government support provisions that would constrain the ability of Australian governments to make laws on social, environmental and economic matters in circumstances where those laws do not discriminate between domestic and foreign businesses. The Government has not and will not accept provisions that limit its capacity to put health warnings or plain packaging requirements on tobacco products or its ability to continue the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme... In the past, Australian Governments have sought the inclusion of investor-state dispute resolution procedures in trade agreements with developing countries at the behest of Australian businesses. The Gillard Government will discontinue this practice. If Australian businesses are concerned about sovereign risk in Australian trading partner countries, they will need to make their own assessments about whether they want to commit to investing in those countries... Foreign businesses investing in Australia will be entitled to the same legal protections as domestic businesses but the Gillard Government will not confer greater rights on foreign businesses through investor-state dispute resolution provisions."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acci.asn.au/getattachment/b9d3cfae-fc0c-4c2a-a3df-3f58228daf6d/Gillard-Government-Trade-Policy-Statement.aspx "Trade Policy Statement", Australian Government.] Accessed: 5 September 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This statement is a reaction to Philip Morris' ISDS claim under [[UNCITRAL]] rules to challenge Australian tobacco Advertising Restrictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ag.gov.au/internationalrelations/internationallaw/pages/tobaccoplainpackaging.aspx|title=Tobacco plain packaging—investor-state arbitration|publisher=Ag.gov.au|accessdate=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2013,{{Update inline|date=April 2017}} Australia had not terminated any bilateral investment treaties allowing for ISDS. Even if it were to do so, most such treaties foresee post-termination-protection for many years after the termination has become effective. In any event, since the election of the conservative Coalition Government in 2013, the Government has entered into free trade agreements (such as the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement, Ch 9 section B) that include ISDS.&lt;ref&gt;http://dfat.gov.au/trade/agreements/chafta/Pages/australia-china-fta.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative way ahead may be the preservation of investor protection under [[public international law]], including ISDS, but with more concern for transparency and the balancing of economic and non-economic interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/bibliotheque/briefing/2014/130710/LDM_BRI(2014)130710_REV2_EN.pdf|format=PDF|title=Investor-State Dispute Settlement (ISDS) : State of play and prospects for reform|publisher=Europarl.europa.eu|accessdate=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As noted [[#Debates|above]], the [[European Commission]] proposed September 2015) an 'Investment Court System' to replace ISDS clauses (notably in the draft TTIP), with the scope for investor challenge much reduced and with 'highly skilled judges' rather than arbitrators used to determine cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Commission proposes new Investment Court System for TTIP and other EU trade and investment negotiations | url = http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-15-5651_en.htm | work = The European Commission| date = 16 September 2015 | accessdate = 25 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this vein, [[Karel De Gucht]], the [[European Commissioner for Trade|EU commissioner]] in charge of negotiating [[International Investment Agreement]]s declared on 18 December 2014 that future agreements shall become more transparent, shall "fully enshrine democratic prerogatives" and "explicitly state that legitimate government public policy decisions – on issues such as the balance between public and private provision of healthcare or "the European ban on chicken carcasses washed with chlorine" – cannot be over-ridden".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/dec/18/wrong-george-monbiot-nothing-secret-eu-trade-deal|title=You're wrong, George Monbiot – there is nothing secret about this EU trade deal|author=Karel De Gucht|work=the Guardian|accessdate=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He announced to "crack down on companies using legal technicalities to build frivolous cases against governments", to "open up investment tribunals to public scrutiny – documents will be public and interested parties, including NGOs, will be able to make submissions". Also, he said, the EU "will eliminate any conflicts of interest – the arbitrators who decide on EU cases must be above suspicion". However, insisting equally on the advantages of such investment protection agreements, he states along that [they] "protect job-creating investment from discrimination and unfair treatment" and that "the task here is to find the right balance between preventing abuse and protecting investments".

Current controversies over ISDS appear driven by attempts to expand its scope to new countries and, especially, to relations between developed countries with mature court systems and democratic governments.

In 2014, several members of the [[United States House of Representatives]] expressed opposition to inclusion of ISDS in the proposed [[Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership]] (TTIP) between the United States and the [[European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Drake | first = Celeste | title = Powerful Members of Congress Oppose Special 'Corporate Court' Rights for European Firms | publisher = [[AFL–CIO]] | date = 18 December 2014 | url = http://www.aflcio.org/Blog/Political-Action-Legislation/Powerful-Members-of-Congress-Oppose-Special-Corporate-Court-Rights-for-European-Firms | accessdate = 2014-12-21 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://archive.is/20141221072048/http://www.aflcio.org/Blog/Political-Action-Legislation/Powerful-Members-of-Congress-Oppose-Special-Corporate-Court-Rights-for-European-Firms | archivedate = 21 December 2014 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, faced with opposition to ISDS in several European countries, the European Parliament adopted a resolution requiring any new dispute settlement scheme included in TTIP "must be replaced by a new public and transparent system of investment protection, in which private interests cannot undermine public policy and which is subject to public law".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Euractiv: European Parliament backs TTIP, rejects ISDS|url = http://www.euractiv.com/sections/global-europe/european-parliament-backs-ttip-rejects-isds-316142|accessdate = 2015-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; (The Commission's 2015 proposal in response is noted [[#Debates|above]]).

South Africa has stated it will withdraw from treaties with ISDS clauses, and India is also considering such a position. Indonesia plans to let treaties with ISDS clauses lapse when they need renewal. Brazil has refused any treaty with ISDS clauses.&lt;ref name="economist-20141011" /&gt;

In 2018, the Court of Justice of the European Union ruled that "The arbitration clause in the Agreement between the Netherlands and Slovakia on the protection of investments is not compatible with EU law".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://curia.europa.eu/jcms/upload/docs/application/pdf/2018-03/cp180026en.pdf|title=Judgment in Case C-284/16 - Slowakische Republik v Achmea BV|author=Court of Justice of the European Union|accessdate=9 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This ruling could imply that any similar arbitration tribunal considering corporate sovereignty cases would also be illegal under EU law.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2523">'''John Rockefeller Prentice''' (December 17, 1902 &amp;ndash; June 13, 1972) was born to [[Chicago]] lawyer Ezra Parmalee Prentice and [[Alta Rockefeller Prentice]] in [[New York City|New York]]. Prentice's maternal grandfather is the [[Standard Oil]] [[tycoon]], [[John D. Rockefeller]] (1839&amp;ndash;1937).

==Biography==
While attending [[Yale University]], Prentice became a member of the [[Skull and Bones]] society&lt;ref name="Tap Day 1927"&gt;{{cite news | title=SENATOR'S SON GETS FINAL 'TAP' AT YALE: Charles T. Bingham of Connecticut Receives Chief Honor at Traditional Elections. FOUR REFUSE FIRST SLAP John D.

During his years at Yale, Prentice had accumulated debts and consequently was cut off from his parents. He worked in [[Boston]] for a wholesale hardware firm for four years to make enough money to return to Yale. Upon his return to the [[Ivy League]] school, Prentice continued to work to support himself. He graduated from [[Yale Law School]] in 1932 and practiced [[law]] with a Chicago law firm throughout the 1930s. In March 1941, before the Japanese attack at Pearl Harbor, Prentice volunteered in the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] as a [[Private (rank)|private]]. While serving in the [[Asiatic-Pacific Theater|Pacific Theatre]] of [[World War II]], he became a [[Captain (United States)|Captain]] in the [[Artillery]].

Prentice became a cattle breeder and is known as a pioneer of [[artificial insemination]] in farm animals as a means of improving their genetic pool.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.absglobal.com/company-info/abs-history/ ABS &amp; the A.I.

On August 11, 1941, Prentice married Abbie Cantrill. The couple had one daughter, Chicago [[philanthropist]], [[Abra Prentice Wilkin]].

He is the only child of Jamaican supermodel Althea Laing and banking innovator Lloyd Laing Snr.

Since graduation from Munro College in 1994, Laing has established himself as a groundbreaking pioneer, most known for his forays in telecommunications, Internet development, entertainment production and digital product development.

He began his career in 1994 at Jamaica Communication Limited where he served as a system administrator to Worldtelenet a small ISP based in Kingston. He was introduced to product development by Victor Lowe who later challenged Laing to create new product offerings to maintain WTI's market position. Laing convinced Lowe and his other partners to introduce a flat rate internet model, which helped revolutionized internet service provision in Jamaica.

He was a  co-founder and a managing Partner at JL Mobile,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jlmobile.net|title=JL Mobile}}&lt;/ref&gt; a Jamaican based technology research and development firm, that created the SmartTab, a low budget android tablet, piloted at the University of the West Indies in 2012.

In 2013 he founded The Jamaica App factory, a mobile app development studio, which has been involved in the development of groundbreaking web and mobile applications such as emerging music streaming service Dippso.com&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dippso.comt|title=Dippso}}&lt;/ref&gt; and appnng.com, a cloud based enterprise level SaaS provider.

In 2015 Laing was invited to the board of AnSuen Holdings LLC, a  US based digital asset management firm, and helped to establish its corporate presence in Jamaica which serves to incubate concepts and accelerate early stage startups, such as the contactless payment processing platform ClickPaye&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clickpaye.comt|title=ClickPaye}}&lt;/ref&gt; a PitchIT Caribbean 2016 Top 10 finalist.

He is a lead volunteer at ThinkJamaica, a non-profit focused on bridging Jamaica's digital divide through the use of digital education, and emerging technology.

An avid advocate of live reggae music in his early years, Laing has been involved in a number of groundbreaking music productions including noted artists such Courtney John, Winston Mcanuff, Protoje, Nomaddz, Raging Fyah, and Black as Cole amongst others. His label Red Records UK continues to selectively release some of the Reggae industry's most understated productions.

'''Samuel-Louis Louis Crommelin''' (1652–1727) was a French [[Huguenot]] exile, who became director of an Irish [[linen]] business.

==Life==
Crommelin was born in May 1652 at [[Armandcourt]], near [[Saint-Quentin, Aisne|Saint-Quentin]] in [[Picardy]], into a family of landowners with a tradition of growing [[flax]]; his father, Louis Crommelin, married in 1648 to Marie Mettayer, was wealthy and had four sons, Samuel-Louis, Samuel, William, and Alexander. Samuel-Louis Crommelin, called Louis, was in business flax-spinning and linen-weaving. The family was [[Protestant]], and the [[Revocation of the Edict of Nantes]] in 1685 hit hard even though Louis was a Catholic convert of 1683. With his son and two daughters he made his way to [[Amsterdam]]. There he became partner in a bank, and was joined by his brothers Samuel and William.&lt;ref name="DNB"&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Crommelin, Samuel-Louis|volume=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under [[William III of England|William III]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary II]], [[Thomas Southwell, 1st Baron Southwell|Thomas Southwell]] had access to funds to develop Irish industry.&lt;ref name="Southwell"&gt;{{cite ODNB|id=26068|first=Kilbutn|last=Matthew|title=Southwell, Thomas}}&lt;/ref&gt; Huguenot linen-workers had been encouraged to settle at [[Lisburn]]  where already there was some manufacture of linen. In 1696 the English parliament passed an act admitting all products of [[hemp]] and flax duty free from Ireland to England; the Irish parliament in November 1697 passed an act for fostering the linen manufacture. William III's policy was to discourage the Irish woollen trade, but to build up linen manufacture there.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt; Crommelin was the most prominent Huguenot attracted by Southwell.&lt;ref name="Southwell"/&gt; He arrived at Lisburn in the autumn of 1698, and made recommendations for improving the linen industry in a memorial of 16 April 1699; which were implemented quickly. Crommelin was made "overseer of the royal linen manufacture of Ireland", and lent money for the scheme. In 1702 [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] confirmed its royal patent.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

Crommelin began by ordering looms from Flanders and Holland, and Huguenot weavers were introduced. He adopted Irish [[spinning-wheel]] but worked to improve it. His maker of the reeds, which control the [[warp thread]]s, was Henry Mark du Pré (d. 1750), of [[Cambrai]].&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.craigavonhistoricalsociety.org.uk/rev/luttonlinentrade.html|title=''The Linen Trade in Co. Armagh'', craigavonhistoricalsociety.org.uk|accessdate=26 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Francis Seymour-Conway, 1st Baron Conway|Baron Conway]] gave a site for weaving workshops, and Irish apprentices were taken on. Dutchmen were engaged to teach flax-growing to farmers, and to superintend bleaching operations. It is not without some reason that Crommelin has been credited with originating, as regards Ulster, a system of technical education for the textile art. Crommelin was assisted by his brothers, and the linens and [[cambric]]s could replace imported textiles. In 1705 a factory was opened at [[Kilkenny]], under the management of William Crommelin.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

Crommelin expanded operations, with the manufacture of hempen [[sailcloth]] at [[Rathkeale]] and other locations. He was given a pension in 1716, and died at Lisburn on 14 July 1727, aged 75. He was buried, with other Huguenots, in the eastern corner of the graveyard of [[Lisburn Cathedral]].&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

==Family==
[[File:CrommelinGraveLisburnCathedral.JPG|thumb|Crommelin grave, Lisburn Cathedral]]
The wife of Louis Crommelin was named Ann. She survived her husband by twenty-eight years, dying August 17, 1755, at the age of 97. Their only son, Louis, born at St Quentin, died at Lisburn on 1 July 1711, aged 28. Their daughter, Mary Madelien, who married Captain de Bernière, died 8 July 1715, aged 21. All four are buried in the family vault in the churchyard of Christ Church Cathedral, Lisburn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Crommelin|first1=Jacob|title=Early History of the Crommelin Family, Part 3|url=http://www.crommelin.org/history/Ancestors/Scheffer/Part3/History03.htm|website=Crommelin.org|accessdate=21 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Crommelin family became extinct in the main line, but the name survived in a branch of the family of de la Cherois, connections by marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gordon|first1=Alexander, ed.|title=Dictionary of National Biography, 1885-1900|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Crommelin,_Samuel-Louis_(DNB00)|website=Wikisource|accessdate=21 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2016 session====
[[File:Ricketts, Pete 2013-11-04a.JPG|right|thumb|upright|Ricketts in 2013]]
In its 2016 session, the legislature passed three bills that Ricketts then vetoed.  LB580 would have created an independent commission of citizens to draw new district maps following censuses; supporters described it as an attempt to de-politicize the redistricting process, while Ricketts maintained that the bill delegated the legislature's constitutional duty of redistricting to "an unelected and unaccountable board".  The bill's sponsor, [[John Murante]], opted not to seek an override of the veto.&lt;ref name=2016session1&gt;Matheny, Ryan.

At the 2016 Republican state convention, Ricketts denounced several legislators who had failed to support his and the party's positions on various bills, and called for the election of more "platform Republicans" to the officially nonpartisan legislature.  In response to this, thirteen legislators, including five registered Republicans, released a statement in which they accused Ricketts of placing partisanship above principle.  One of the signers of the statement, [[Laura Ebke]], changed her registration from Republican to [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian]] shortly thereafter, citing Ricketts's speech as one of the factors that drove her to make the change.&lt;ref name=platform&gt;Szalewski, Susan.

==== 2018 election ====
On June 5, 2017, Ricketts announced his re-election bid for the 2018 election. During his speech, he stated that "lowering property taxes" will be his main concern if he is elected to a second-term. Ricketts also asked Nebraskans to "re-hire" current Lt. Governor [[Mike Foley (Nebraska politician)|Mike Foley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.omaha.com/news/politics/nebraska-gov-pete-ricketts-announces-re-election-bid-says-he/article_d7b5839e-4946-11e7-9c3a-b3bddfae93a0.html|title=Nebraska Gov.

==Political positions==
Ricketts voiced his support for the [[Keystone XL]] Pipeline, as he stated it would "create jobs here in Nebraska, lots of tax revenues here in Nebraska, of course help us become less dependent on foreign oil."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last1=Brown | first1=Ben | title=Gov.

The '''Phillips catalyst''', or the Phillips supported chromium catalyst, is the [[catalyst]] used to produce approximately half of the world's [[polyethylene]].  A [[heterogeneous catalyst]], it consists of a [[chromium]] [[oxide]] [[catalyst support|supported]] on [[silica gel]].&lt;ref&gt;Max P. McDaniel "A Review of the Phillips Supported Chromium Catalyst and Its Commercial Use for Ethylene Polymerization" Advances in Catalysis, 2010, Volume 53, p. 123. {{DOI|10.1016/S0360-0564(10)53003-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Polyethylene, the most abundant synthetic polymer, is produced industrially by the [[polymerization]] of [[ethylene]]:
:n C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;    →  (C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;
Although exergonic (i.e., thermodynamically favorable), the reaction requires catalysts.  Three main catalysts are employed commercially: the Phillips catalyst, [[Ziegler-Natta catalyst]]s (based on [[titanium trichloride]]), and, for specialty polymers, [[metallocene]]-based catalysts.

==Preparation and mechanism of action==
The Phillips catalyst is prepared by impregnating high surface area silica gel with [[chromium trioxide]] or related chromium compounds.  The solid precatalyst is then [[calcine]]d in air to give the active catalyst.  Only a fraction of the chromium is catalytically active, a fact that interferes with elucidation of the catalytic mechanism.  The active catalyst is often depicted as a [[chromate]] [[ester]] bound to the silica surface.  The mechanism for the polymerization process is the subject of much research, the central question being the structure of the active species, which is assumed to be an [[organochromium chemistry|organochromium compound]].&lt;ref&gt;Klaus H. Theopold "Deprotonation of coordinated ethylene may start Phillips catalysis" Proceedings, U.S. National Academy of Sciences, 2014, vol. 111, pp. 11578–11579, {{doi|10.1073/pnas.1411822111}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Banks (chemist)|Robert L. Banks]] and [[J. Paul Hogan]], both at [[Phillips Petroleum]], filed the first patents on the Phillips catalyst in 1953.  Four years later, the process was commercialized.&lt;ref&gt;J.P. Hogan, R.L. Banks, U.S. Patent 2,825,721 to Phillips Petroleum Company, filed August, 1954 and issued March, 1958.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Proactive Contracting''' is akin to [[Proactive Law]] and focuses on the same properties, namely to prevent problems and promote relationships. The legal area of research developed in Scandinavia in the 1990s and has gradually gained attention. Proactive Contracting deals with [[Contract Management]], [[Relational Management]], [[Risk Management]] and [[Business Process Management]].

The word [[proactive]] is the opposition to reactive and refers to acting in anticipation of future problems, needs, or changes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/proactive Proactive - Definition from Merriam-Webster Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;

A survey conducted by IACCM shows that businesses urge a [[paradigm shift]] in contracting, favoring a more relational approach.&lt;ref name="iaccm1"&gt;[http://www.iaccm.com/news/contractingexcellence/?storyid=1196 Contracting Excellence&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the focus of future contracting becomes more relational. Businesses may therefore face increased [[complexity]] as trading is done not only across physical boundaries, but also across religious, [[cultural boundary|cultural]], and ethical boundaries.

The IACCM survey has underpinned the need for re-thinking contracts and the approach to business relationships, as international, and long relationships, make it hard to draft and agree upon every single event that might occur in the future.

Proactive Contracting is moving away from the path of responding to these complex relationships with complex contracts.&lt;ref&gt;http://pta-consult.com/theory/future-contracting/&lt;/ref&gt; However, as it is hard to imagine realistic alternatives to [[contract]]s, Proactive Contracting suggest businesses to change perception of contracts to meet the needs of the future. Add to this the increased complexity of products due to [[technological evolution]] and it becomes clear that businesses need to actively deal with the danger of increasing complexity and uncertainty.
In fact, a survey conducted by [[IBM Corporation]] revealed that 79% of [[Chief Executive Officers]] (CEOs) see increased global complexity as a major challenge over the coming years.&lt;ref&gt;http://public.dhe.ibm.com/common/ssi/ecm/en/gbe03530usen/GBE03530USEN.PDF{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the legal framework increases in complexity, it becomes apparent that there is a need for creating certainty in order to support [[future trading]].
Businesses need to manage this complexity in order to avoid unnecessary losses, but also in order to exploit all the possibilities deriving from [[globalization|global interaction]].

Empirical studies on contracting capabilities&lt;ref&gt;Haapio, H.: An Ounce of Prevention…- Proactive Legal Care for Corporate Contracting Success. (2007) Tidskrift utgiven av Juridiska Föreningen i Finland, 1/2007, pp. 39-68.&lt;/ref&gt;  and research on [[dynamic capabilities]]&lt;ref&gt;Teece, D.J., Pisano, G. &amp; Shuen, A.: Dynamic Capabilities and Strategic Management. (1997) Strategic Management Journal, vol. 18, no. 7, pp. 509-533&lt;/ref&gt; have shown that promoting proactive behavior in businesses is a key in the quest of future success.
As [[globalization]] increases, [[sustainability]] and certainty become more urgent, resulting in [[decentralization]] of the traditional legal environment. The reason for this [[decentralization]] is that the traditional legal environment does not fulfill the task of creating the certainty and sustainability that businesses need in order to prosper.

After the launch of the [[United Nations Decade of Education for Sustainable Development]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/new/en/education/themes/leading-the-international-agenda/education-for-sustainable-development/ Education for Sustainable Development | Education | United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; mechanisms have evolved through which future development is achieved. According to these mechanisms, a sound development must be focusing on [[ethics|ethically]] acceptable, [[moral]]ly fair and economically sound processes.
Management tools for global value chains have already been developed, and focus is especially on self- and [[private regulation]] instruments and standards - this is where '''proactive contracting''' and [[proactive law]] is coming to the fore.

== Preventive Law ==

The proactive law movement has become more visible in recent years, but the idea of an [[ex ante]] view is not new. It is generally known that the earlier a dispute or a potential dispute is addressed, the better the chances of a fair and prompt solution.  [[Louis M. Brown]] was the first to introduce the ex ante view in his ground-laying book “Preventive Law”&lt;ref name=brown1950&gt;{{cite book|last=Brown|first=Louis M.|title=Preventive Law|year=1950|publisher=Prentice-Hall|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although he identified and organized the [[preventive law]] into a distinctive way of thinking, he was not the inventor of this approach. It has been, and still is, well known to many legal professionals and every business manager that:

"''It usually costs less to avoid getting into trouble than to pay for getting out of trouble."''&lt;ref name=brown1950/&gt;

In order to understand the general principles of proactive law, [[Edward E. Dauer]] has identified the core principles of preventive law, as these principles create the foundation on which proactive law and proactive contracting is built. The four core principles of preventive law are:&lt;ref&gt;Dauer E. A., Four Principles for a Theory of Preventive Law, p. 13-35&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Predicting human behavior'': A legal solution, which anticipates and takes into account what people will do and by doing so, preventing litigation. This improves personal and business relationships, and constitutes an essential part of the preventive law.
* ''Conflict management'': Preventive law is drawing parallels from the medical context, illustrated by the fact that successful medical treatment is prophylactic.
* ''Embracement of risks'': Instead of focusing solely on reducing one or a few elements of risks to zero, the preventive law approach focuses on the overall sum of risks and strive to reduce the overall risk.
* ''Preventive legal service'': Lawyers and in-house counsels must participate with others in multi-disciplinary teams in the planning of the business’ venture. By bringing in legal expertise earlier, it becomes possible to detect and prevent legal problems from occurring.

The proactive law movement encompasses the basic principles of preventive law stated by Edward E. Dauer, namely preventing what is not desirable, and keeping problems and risks from materializing. Thus, preventive law constitute the foundation of [[proactive law]].
To this preventive dimension of law, proactive law adds a second aspect, which is often neglected in traditional law – known as the [[promotive]] dimension.

== The Promotive Dimension ==

The nature of the promotive dimension is positive and promotes what is desirable while encouraging good behavior. This is the distinction to preventive law.

In a legal context, proactive law emphasizes the importance of collaboration between legal professionals and other disciplines, in order to achieve the desired goals in circumstances where legal expertise works in collaboration with other professionals involved. In proactive law the need for dialogue between different understandings is thus emphasized. In a medical context the [[preventive law]] prevents ill health, while proactive law [[promotes]] well-being.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iaccm.com/news/contractingexcellence/?storyid=338 Contracting Excellence&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The proactive law approach is based on legal certainty, [[literacy]] and cross-professional collaboration in order to “localize the mines and preventing them from exploding.”&lt;ref&gt;http://www.scandinavianlaw.se/pdf/49-2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Businesses need to manage their compliance with the law and align it to business objectives. In order to do this, not only lawyers, in-house counsels and regulators need to know the law, but also managers and other stakeholders need to have basic knowledge and understanding of the legal ''mines''. When the business have the capability of navigating past the ''mines'' through [[legal literacy|legal literacy and awareness]], it has used the law in a proactive manner that in the end may constitute a source of [[competitive advantage]].

Contracts and contracting processes are complex and often involve cross-professional collaboration. The different stakeholders to a contract each represent their respective area of responsibility, e.g. technical, [[financial]], [[legal]] area, etc. A successfully executed contract is thus dependent on the stakeholder’s ability to [[communicate]] and [[collaborate]].
In order to promote successful contracting, the stakeholders to a contract thus need mutual understanding in order to collaborate efficiently.

==How to Apply Proactive Contracting==
The quest is thus to go from theoretically to practically applicable solutions, in order to obtain a [[competitive advantage]]. One big leap in this process is recognition of the benefits that proactive law brings into contracting.

It all starts with the managers. If they are not confident that the proactive approach is beneficial, then the implementation has no foundation. It is crucial that the managers are convinced that this new approach maximizes the business opportunities while minimizing the risk. Just as important, the managers need tools in order to be able to see that implementation of the proactive approach in business processes is within reach.

In order to achieve a sustainable competitive advantage through proactive contracting, there is a strong consensus that the following points need to be integrated in the business overall strategy and business processes. When the manager knows about the following contracting elements, she/he has the prerequisite to take an informed decision about going the proactive way.

===Alternative Dispute Resolution===
It is obvious that the earlier a potential [[dispute processing|dispute]] is addressed, the better the chance of a prompt and fair solution.&lt;ref&gt;Siedel, G. J., Haapio, H.: Proactive Law for Managers (2011), p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt; However, even the most proactive manager may face difficulties in [[Alternative dispute resolution|ADR]] as a dispute involves at least two parties, and their mutual willingness to follow the proactive approach.

This implies that even in situations where the parties have applied the best thinkable proactive approach to their contract, not all disputes can be avoided. If the parties lack common understanding of what they have agreed upon, this will trigger disputes.&lt;ref&gt;Sorsa K. (ed.): Proactive Management and Proactive Business Law – A Handbook. (2011) 1. ed., Turku: Tampereen Yliopistopaino Oy – Juvenes Print. p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;

The proactive law approach to contracting tells us that the essential thing is to anticipate [[human behavior]], thus being prepared to take control of situations that the parties in their agreement did not predict.

The parties should take control of [[contingencies]] by considering the best method to resolve a dispute.
The aim in ADR is to avoid unnecessary [[Conflict escalation|escalation]] of problems, as value is protected through proper [[dispute resolution]].
The most successful approach in solving disputes is based on ''preventing'' them from occurring by ''promoting'' a mutually healthy relationship.

By handling problems early, businesses might prevent time consuming resolutions from evolving and thereby save costs and promote value. This requires proper understanding of the mutual goals of the relationship through disclosure of procedures that aim at identifying possible sources of disagreements before they arise.
Therefore, a clear [[dispute resolution]] policy provides an important strategic advantage in identifying the source of disagreement and deals with them before they develop into severe disputes. Besides avoiding costs from occurring, an ADR strategy limits the time spent by management on [[litigation]]. Thus, the costly disruption of [[litigation]] and the [[opportunity cost]] are limited.&lt;ref&gt;http://pure.au.dk/portal-asb-student/files/55302637/Overcoming_the_Challenges_of_Future_Contracting_through_the_Use_of_Proactive_Law.pdf p. 39&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides preventing escalation of the dispute, the parties are able to anticipate the next step of the resolution process, as the procedure has been contractually agreed.&lt;ref&gt;Sorsa K. (ed.): Proactive Management and Proactive Business Law – A Handbook. (2011) 1. ed., Turku: Tampereen Yliopistopaino Oy – Juvenes Print. p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt;
The parties’ incentives to incorporate an ADR clause in their contract is both economically, but also legally grounded. The optimal resolution for the parties is not reached through traditional litigation, by referring to their rights and obligations.
Instead the parties should be more proactive and find a solution that is in the best interest of both parties in order to minimize losses derived from their disagreement. This enhances the chances that their relationship will continue in the future.
A recent survey shows that the most favored ADR in international contracts is, [[arbitration]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pwc.com/gx/en/arbitration-dispute-resolution/assets/pwc-international-arbitration-study.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Arbitration is considered the last resort in the escalation, along with [[court litigation]]. This indeed shows that businesses miss the opportunities provided by avoiding immediate escalation.

===Visualization===
The proactive approach to law suggests that contracts are more than just a legal insurance policy that handles the case that one party does not perform. Contracts should be considered as a management tool that [[visualizes]] the goals to reach and how to reach them. Thus, it is not enough that the legal department and the [[in-house counsels]] read and understand the business’ contracts, and furthermore these legal professionals should not craft contracts alone as contractual literacy is required by every user of the contract.

One of these processes concerns the issue of making all the business’ contracts accessible and easily understandable to all the users. The quest is thus to change the way contracts are communicated, [[perceived]] and [[taught]].
A promising new direction for contracting practice is developing though the use of [[non-textual communication]], which deals with visualization of legal information combined with strategy visualization. In order to facilitate a meeting of the parties' mind, visual techniques is considered a proactive contracting-resource.
The idea of using visuals in contracting processes has evolved in [[Europe]] and especially [[Germany]]. This field of research is also known as - ''[[Rechtsvisualisierung]]''.

A survey conducted by IACCM&lt;ref&gt;IACCM: The future of contracting, (2012).&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that the majority of businesses expect that there will be greater use of visual techniques in contracting, and that visualization will play a main role in achieving better and more successful contracts in the coming years.

In general, visualization is understood as a [[graphic]] presentation that depicts information in a way that is conductive to acquiring insight, developing and elaborating understanding, or communicating experience.
In this context, the idea of visualization is to communicate through visual legal tools in order to convey information in a way that makes it easily understandable by the users of the contract. The need for visual communication is reflected in the growing use of visual tools in businesses to explain legal concepts in [[legal education]].
However, most contracts still lack visualization, and instead use text in black and white. Businesses that take this traditional approach face huge opportunities for improvements.
The research field of visual contracts is quite new, and lack solutions.

===The Holistic View of Business Managers===
In addition to visual contracts, managers need to avoid focusing on single objectives. Instead emphasis should be on the duration of their customer relationship, the [[innovation]] that have resulted from their interactions, and the referral business that can be traced to those customers.  As stated by [[George J. Siedel]]: “Rather than focusing on whether they achieved price discounts, purchasers should emphasize a full cost approach that considers matters such as the operating efficiencies gained through using the supplier, the reductions in defects achieved by the supplier, and even the supplier’s role in developing products or service innovations.”&lt;ref&gt;Siedel, G. J., Haapio, H.: Using Proactive Law for Competitive Advantages. (2010), American Business Law Journal, vol. 47, no. 4, pp. 641- 686.&lt;/ref&gt;

By ''going to the balcony'' - symbolizing the holistic view - [[managers]] become proactive as they view contracts in a big picture perspective. The focus on contracts is thus changed from a ''legal tool'' to the broader view of contracts as a ''management tool''. Managers, who want to become proactive, need to challenge the conventional wisdom that contracts are legal documents and instead adopting a view of contracts as a source of [[innovation]] through collaboration.

The fundamental components that managers need to adapt into [[contracting processes]], in order to become proactive, are centralized around [[leadership]]. Proactive leadership facilitates the environment needed for supporting an organization that enables high performance and good behavior that encourages collaborative contracting. ''The balcony view'' provides managers with a [[holistic]] mindset that facilitates the foundation for [[proactive]] [[leadership]].
With this revised focus, the parties can attempt to establish procedures for more open information flows and greater transparency in order to signalize their intentions to collaborate and work together to manage risks and optimize results.
Thus, contracts are no longer a necessary evil, but rather an instrument that, when handled proactively, facilitates a [[competitive advantage]].

===Coase Theorem and Proactive Contracting===
As trading becomes more relational, the traditional role of contracts is changing, favoring the informality of traditional sales and business development. However, this seems somewhat unlikely considering the pressure for [[regulatory compliance]] on the one hand, and the demand for better management of risk and delivery of financial return on the other hand. This leads to an overwhelming view that the result of growing complexity will be a different form of contract, adjusted to the needs of the market. Ways that this will be achieved include a growth in [[Technical standard|industry standard]]s and in some cases increased use of [[private law]]. There will also be a continued drive towards international standards that enable agreement through reference, rather than requiring case-by-case [[negotiation]].  This view is also reflected by an IACCM survey, which shows that businesses expect international standard terms in contracting to prevail in the future.  A response to this anticipated change in contracting could be based on the [[CISG]].
It is shown how the CISG can fulfill the need of standard terms in [[international contracting]], in accordance with the proactive [[philosophy]].

Since [[Ronald Coase]] in 1960 stated that when moving from an economic regime supposing zero [[transaction cost]]s to an economic regime of positive transaction costs, the legal system becomes crucially important.&lt;ref&gt;Coase, R. H.: [[The Problem of Social Cost]] (1960), Journal of Law and Economics, vol. 3, pp. 1-44.&lt;/ref&gt;

The insight of the [[Coase theorem]] is in short that if transaction costs are higher than the gains from trade, then the initial assignment of [[property rights]] determines how resources are ultimately allocated.&lt;ref&gt;Flechtner, H. M. et al.: Drafting Contracts under the CISG. (2008), New York, Oxford University Press, 1. ed.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the slipstream of the Coase theorem, professionals increasingly focused on understanding the roles of transaction costs and the legal system in the economy. In particular, the focus was on institutions that could enable a reduction of transaction costs called [[New Institutional Economics]].&lt;ref&gt;Klein, Peter G., New Institutional Economics. July 1998. Available at SSRN: {{DOI|10.2139/ssrn.115811}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A great deal of the research has been based on the assumption that economic growth is reflected in the ease of doing business. Accordingly, a key recommendation is to develop institutions that reduce transaction costs and facilitate trade.

In the traditional legal framework, some managers [[derogate]] from or [[opt out]] of the CISG. In general, this is not in accordance with the mutual economic incentives that derive through the use of the CISG. Instead the proactive manager bears in mind the CISG benefits on macro level, and recognizes this as an opportunity to limit transaction costs on a micro level between businesses.
The proactive characteristics support the use of tools that enable a maximization of the value in each business relationship. Thus, the CISG is truly a proactive tool that should be seen as kind of an agreed document between the contracting parties on sales of goods. This implies that rights and obligations to a large extent are subject to CISG regulation.

By using the CISG as an agreed document, the parties’ rights and obligations are distributed in a fair and balanced way that is widely recognized as promoting international trade.

Of course the CISG does not fit completely to specific transactions, thus the parties need to negotiate provisions that are dealing with the transaction, e.g. [[delivery (commerce)|delivery]], [[payment]], [[price]], ADR, etc. In addition to ''transactional terms'', the parties need to negotiate a [[limitation of liability]], as the CISG does not govern this issue.  Further, there is a need to emphasize that the use of the CISG in [[commodity]] sales is often not suitable because of string trading and the lack of strict avoidance provisions in the CISG.&lt;ref&gt;Bridge, G., Michael: Uniformity and Diversity in the Law of International Sale, (2003) Pace International Law Review, spring 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, with these constraints, the proactive manager should emphasize the CISG as an agreed document, as the default rules roughly reflect the same result, which the parties would have [[bargained]]. This implies that the parties reach agreement in less time and with less effort, in accordance with the proactive philosophy.
The use of and need for international legal standard terms will increase in the future, and as a response to this need, the CISG provides a framework that can easily be adopted into contracting.

Another fact that speaks pro the use of Proactive Contracting, is decisions of the German Supreme Court in cases on interpretation of the CISG.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cisgw3.law.pace.edu/cases/950308g3.html Germany 8 March 1995 Supreme Court (New Zealand mussels case) [translation available&amp;#93;&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; It seems that even in transactions leading to dispute, judgments seem to favor the most economic solution, supporting economic cost considerations and bargaining-for-risk theories.&lt;ref&gt;Henschel, René Franz: The Use of Law and Economics Arguments in Cases Governed by CISG. (2011), in: Schwenzer, I. &amp; Spagnolo, L.: State of play – The 3rd Annual Maa Sclechtriem CISG-conference, International Commerce and Arbitration, vol. 11, pp. 29-49.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Proactive Contracting as a Competitive Advantage ==
To transform the traditional legal approach to contracting into a proactive approach to contracting, businesses must strive to maximize the value of their business relationships through a change in mindset towards relational contracting. This view is no longer disputed as IACCM has valid measuring showing this fact.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iaccm.com/userfiles/file/CE_April2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[paradigm shift]] that businesses urge, which IACCM has identified,&lt;ref name="iaccm1"/&gt; must be supported by an ex ante view on contracting that emphasizes the need for preventing problems from materializing, when possible, and resolving unavoidable disputes early using the most appropriate methods.
Further, businesses are encouraged to promote procedures that can help identify opportunities before they pass in order to maximize value, strengthen business relationships and manage risk. Managing the desired goals and securing the most appropriate mix of means to achieve them require early involvement of stakeholders, alignment of objectives, creation of a shared vision, and development of support and guidance for successful implementation.
By adopting a proactive view on contracting, businesses may be able to turn the view on future contracting from uncertain threat into a proactive resource of value.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1993">'''Raul Cuadra Chamberlain''' (1924&amp;ndash;1974) was a musician and advertising pioneer in Nicaragua, Central America. He was a son of the economist [[Vicente Cuadra Gomez]] and grandson of [[José Vicente Cuadra]].

In the 1940s, he traveled through Nicaragua and the rest of Central America with his orchestra - ''El Champu de Carino''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=El champú y la música |url=http://www.elnuevodiario.com.ni/opinion/40156 |work=[[El Nuevo Diario]] |date=12 February 2009 |accessdate=29 December 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Audiences were delighted with his singing and the music of his orchestra. In order to defray traveling expenses, he started to advertise various products and services of different businesses during the intermissions of ''Champu de Carino'' shows. 

In 1950, he founded one of the first advertising agencies in the country - ''Publicidad Cuadra Chamberlain''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Fallece pionero del ingenio publicitario |url=http://archivo.laprensa.com.ni/archivo/2000/noviembre/15/nacionales/nacionales-20001115-20.html |work=[[La Prensa (Managua)|La Prensa]] |date=15 November 2000 |accessdate=29 December 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the right idea at the right time. Nicaragua was experiencing a post World War II economic boom. In 1956, his elder brother [[Vicente Cuadra Chamberlain|Vicente]] joined the agency as general manager and the two brothers paved the way for advertising success in the country. In 1961, due to health problems, Raul stepped down to concentrate on his music. He still worked as a consultant on special projects for the agency until his death in 1974.

{{Business administration}}

In [[organizational studies]], '''resource management''' is the efficient and effective development of an organization's resources when they are needed. Such resources may include financial resources, inventory, human skills, production resources, or [[information technology]] (IT).

In the realm of [[project management]], processes, techniques and philosophies as to the best approach for allocating resources have been developed.  These include discussions on functional vs. cross-functional [[resource allocation]] as well as processes espoused by organizations like the [[Project Management Institute]] (PMI) through their [[Project Management Body of Knowledge]] (PMBOK) methodology of project management. Resource management is a key element to activity resource estimating and project human resource management. Both are essential components of a comprehensive project management plan to execute and monitor a project successfully.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge, Third Edition|year=2004|publisher=Project Management Institute (PMI)|location=Newtown Square, Pennsylvania|isbn=1-930699-45-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge, Fourth Edition|year=2008|publisher=Project Management Institute (PMI)|location=Newtown Square, Pennsylvania|isbn=978-1-933890-51-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; As is the case with the larger discipline of [[project management]], there are [[list of resource management software|resource management software]] tools available that automate and assist the process of resource allocation to projects and portfolio resource transparency including [[supply and demand]] of resources.  The goal of these tools typically is to ensure that: (i) there are employees within our organization with required specific [[skill set]] and desired profile required for a project, (ii) decide the number and skill sets of new employees to hire, and (iii) allocate the workforce to various projects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bizmerlin.com/resource_management_process.php Resource Management Process]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[https://meisterplan.com/project-portfolio-management/resource-management/ Resource Management Method]&lt;/ref&gt;Within professional services and consulting organizations, the effectiveness of these tools and processes is typically monitored by measuring billable [[utilization rate]].

==Corporate Resource Management Process==


Large organizations usually have a defined corporate resource management process which mainly guarantees that resources are never over-allocated across multiple projects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pmhut.com/modern-project-management Modern Project Management]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://pdware.com/ Enterprise Resource Management]&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Drucker wrote of the need to focus resources, abandoning a less promising initiatives for every new project taken on, as fragmentation inhibits results. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Growing in Turbulent Times'|url=http://www.projectauditors.com/Papers/Growing_a_Company/Growing_in_Turbulent_Times.html |author=Frank Parth}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Techniques==

One resource management technique is [[resource leveling]]. It aims at smoothing the stock of resources on hand, reducing both excess inventories and shortages.

The required data are: the [[Demand (economics)|demand]]s for various resources, forecast by time period into the future as far as is reasonable, as well as the resources' configurations required in those demands, and the [[Supply (economics)|supply]] of the resources, again forecast by time period into the future as far as is reasonable.

The goal is to achieve 100% [[utilization]] but that is very unlikely, when weighted by important metrics and subject to constraints, for example: meeting a minimum service level, but otherwise minimizing [[cost]].  A Project Resource Allocation Matrix (PRAM) is maintained to visualize the resource allocations against various projects.

The principle is to invest in resources as stored capabilities, then unleash the capabilities as demanded.

A dimension of resource development is included in resource management by which investment in resources can be retained by a smaller additional investment to develop a new capability that is demanded, at a lower investment than disposing of the current resource and replacing it with another that has the demanded capability.

In [[Habitat conservation|conservation]], resource management is a set of practices pertaining to maintaining natural systems integrity.  Examples of this form of management are [[Air#Air pollution|air resource]] management, [[soil conservation]], [[forestry]], [[wildlife]] management and [[water resource]] management.  The broad term for this type of resource management is [[natural resource management]] (NRM).

In addition, we can use [[Ishikawa diagram]] to analyze Man, Money, Material and Machine needed.

'''Revolo''' is a [[plug-in hybrid|plug-in]] [[Parallel hybrid|parallel]] [[Hybrid vehicle|hybrid]] technology that can be [[Retrofitting|retrofitted]] in both existing and new [[cars]]. This technology can also be used in buses and trucks.  The technology was developed by [[KPIT Technologies]] and the product will be manufactured through a [[joint venture]] between [[Bharat Forge]] and KPIT. As part of the joint venture, KPIT will license the hybrid technology while Bharat Forge will provide manufacturing, assembly, and integration.

Pre-compliance tests conducted at the Automotive research Association of India (ARAI), [[Pune]] have confirmed that the technology provides [[fuel efficiency]] improvements by over 40 percent and reduction in [[green house gas]] (GHG) emissions by over 30%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.nasscom.in/Nasscom/templates/NormalPage.aspx?id=59416 |title = Bharat Forge And KPIT To Form A Joint Venture - Announce ‘New Hybrid Technology Solution’ for Automobiles |publisher = [[Nasscom]] |date = 2010-06-16 |accessdate = 2010-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The technology is to be marketed to [[OEM]]s and individual vehicle owners through a network of dealerships.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.indianexpress.com/news/Bharat-Forge--KPIT-to-float-joint-venture/630376 |title = Bharat Forge, KPIT to float joint venture | publisher = [[Indian Express]] |date = 2010-06-07 |accessdate = 2010-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

===Planning and concept===
The idea of Revolo first occurred to Tejas Kshatriya in 2008&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.livemint.com/2010/07/29211227/Cleaner-greener-cheaper.html |title = Cleaner, greener, cheaper | publisher = [[Mint (newspaper)|Mint]] |date = 2010-07-29 |accessdate = 2010-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; when he was stuck in [[Mumbai]] traffic en route to [[Pune]].

KPIT sanctioned a team of four engineers for the project, which was kept separate from [[KPIT Cummins#Research and development|CREST]], the research and development center at KPIT. It took 2 years of research&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.thenational.ae/business/hybrid-car-makeover-to-hit-the-road |title = Hybrid car makeover to hit the road | publisher = [[The National (Abu Dhabi)]] |date = 2010-06-20 |accessdate = 2010-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a budget under US$2 million&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.livemint.com/2010/07/29211227/Cleaner-greener-cheaper.html |title = Cleaner, greener, cheaper | publisher = [[Mint (newspaper)|Mint]] |date = 2010-07-29 |accessdate = 2010-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; to evolve the idea through trial and error and several failures, including the inability of the system to withstand sudden surge in power when brakes were applied.

The research and development team studied the firing pattern of [[internal combustion engines]] and identified the weak spots that lead to fuel waste&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.thenational.ae/business/fill-the-gap-between-petrol-and-electric |title = Fill the gap between petrol and electric | publisher = [[The National (Abu Dhabi)]] |date = 2010-06-20 |accessdate = 2010-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and created a technology that can convert a passenger car to a hybrid that is environmentally friendly, cheap, fuel-efficient and at the same time offers good performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.thenational.ae/business/hybrid-car-makeover-to-hit-the-road |title = Hybrid car makeover to hit the road | publisher = [[The National (Abu Dhabi)]] |date = 2010-06-20 |accessdate = 2010-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Revolo is designed to work in typical stop-and-go city traffic and allows cars to cruise at about 30&amp;nbsp;km/h in the third gear without straining the engine.

===Latest developments===
KPIT continues the road tests of pilot vehicles as well as consumer trials with results so far having validated the pre-announced performance results. The team has further reduced the overall weight of the solution, improved on the durability and standardized many components across multiple vehicle platforms. Construction at the assembly and manufacturing plants continues. It is expected to be operational by March 2014.

The company will test various vehicles, including [[Automobiles|passenger cars]], with engines sizes between 800 cc and 2,500 cc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/2010/11/16/stories/2010111652720200.htm |title = KPIT plans road tests for hybrid tech soon | publisher = [[Business Line]] |date = 2010-11-15 |accessdate = 2010-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Production of limited hybrid kits is planned to start by first half of 2012.{{update inline|date=November 2017}} The commercial production would begin in 2012-13.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/2010/11/16/stories/2010111652720200.htm |title = KPIT Cummins plans road tests for hybrid tech soon | publisher = [[Business Line]] |date = 2010-11-15 |accessdate = 2010-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{update inline|date=November 2017}}

==Technology==

===Revolo technology details===
The Revolo kit is similar to a [[retrofitting|retrofit]] [[compressed natural gas]] (CNG) kit which contains all required mechanical and electrical components in the package.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.wheelosphere.org/bharat-forge-india-unveil-retrofit-revolo-hybrid-kits-on-sale-in-india-in-six-months | title = Bharat Forge India unveil retrofit Revolo hybrid kits; on sale in India in six months | publisher = Wheelosphere | date = 2010-06-17 |accessdate = 2010-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The kit can be installed in both [[petrol]] and [[Diesel fuel|diesel vehicles]] within 4–6 hours by trained technicians who will be trained by a [[joint venture]] that KPIT has formed with [[Bharat Forge]].

The Revolo kit comprises a 7.5 to 10 [[horsepower]] [[electric motor]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://blogs.edmunds.com/greencaradvisor/2010/09/phev-conversions-slow-to-catch-on-in-us-but-could-be-big-elsewhere.html | title = PHEV Conversions Slow to Catch On in U.S., But Could Be Big Elsewhere | publisher = [[Edmunds.com]] | date = 2010-09-13 |accessdate = 2010-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; developed and patented by KPIT, an electronic [[motor controller]], [[lead–acid battery]] pack, mechanical assembly and [[coupling]], [[proprietary software]] for control [[algorithms]] of the motor and batteries, and  [[battery management system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.thenational.ae/business/fill-the-gap-between-petrol-and-electric |title = Fill the gap between petrol and electric | publisher = [[The National (Abu Dhabi)]] |date = 2010-06-20 |accessdate = 2010-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a parallel hybrid the motor and engine will work simultaneously and as a plug-in, the vehicle can be charged through a standard external electricity source such as a domestic [[power outlet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.nasscom.in/Nasscom/templates/NormalPage.aspx?id=59416 |title = Bharat Forge And KPIT Cummins To Form A Joint Venture - Announce ‘New Hybrid Technology Solution’ for Automobiles |publisher = [[Nasscom]] |date = 2010-06-16 |accessdate = 2010-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike an electric vehicle, the vehicle will operate as a conventional fuel vehicle even if the batteries are completely drained.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.nasscom.in/Nasscom/templates/NormalPage.aspx?id=59416 |title = Bharat Forge And KPIT Cummins To Form A Joint Venture - Announce ‘New Hybrid Technology Solution’ for Automobiles |publisher = [[Nasscom]] |date = 2010-06-16 |accessdate = 2010-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plug-in parallel hybrid conversion kit===
The conversion kit is a lot less complex and light in weight in context of the moving engine components which effectively enhances the [[fuel efficiency]] to twice as compared to existing solutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.nasscom.in/Nasscom/templates/NormalPage.aspx?id=59416 |title = Bharat Forge And KPIT Cummins To Form A Joint Venture - Announce ‘New Hybrid Technology Solution’ for Automobiles |publisher = [[Nasscom]] |date = 2010-06-16 |accessdate = 2010-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Battery specifications: The solution is battery agnostic. It can be adopted to work with various types of batteries such as [[lead–acid batteries]] or [[Lithium-ion batteries]]. The solution typically produces 60 volts from five valve-regulated, lead–acid batteries, and can be recharged from the standard Indian household current of 230 volts in 4 to 6 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://blogs.edmunds.com/greencaradvisor/2010/09/phev-conversions-slow-to-catch-on-in-us-but-could-be-big-elsewhere.html | title = PHEV Conversions Slow to Catch On in U.S., But Could Be Big Elsewhere | publisher = [[Edmunds.com]] | date = 2010-09-13 |accessdate = 2010-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Revolo also consists of an in-built device that recognizes driving patterns and self-adjusts to provide optimum efficiency in stop-and-go traffic situations.

===Pricing===
Revolo is said to be 80 percent cheaper as compared to the [[retrofitting|after-market]] [[hybrid car]] kits available in the United States which cost around US$20,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://blogs.edmunds.com/greencaradvisor/2010/09/phev-conversions-slow-to-catch-on-in-us-but-could-be-big-elsewhere.html | title = PHEV Conversions Slow to Catch On in U.S., But Could Be Big Elsewhere | publisher = [[Edmunds.com]] | date = 2010-09-13 |accessdate = 2010-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be retrofitted into any vehicle at an average cost of [[Rupee|Rs.]] 100,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.livemint.com/2010/07/29211227/Cleaner-greener-cheaper.html |title = Cleaner, greener, cheaper | publisher = [[Mint (newspaper)|Mint]] |date = 2010-07-29 |accessdate = 2010-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Rochdale Principles''' are a set of ideals for the operation of [[cooperative]]s. They were first set out in 1844 by the [[Rochdale Pioneers|Rochdale Society of Equitable Pioneers]] in [[Rochdale]], England and have formed the basis for the principles on which co-operatives around the world continue to operate. The implications of the Rochdale Principles are a focus of study in [[co-operative economics]]. The original Rochdale Principles were officially adopted by the [[International Co-operative Alliance]] (ICA) in 1937 as the Rochdale Principles of Co-operation. Updated versions of the principles were adopted by the ICA in 1966 as the Co-operative Principles and in 1995 as part of the [[Statement on the Co-operative Identity]].&lt;ref name="icapr"&gt;[http://www.ica.coop/coop/principles-revisions.html ICA Co-operative Principles] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091029163330/http://www.ica.coop/coop/principles-revisions.html |date=2009-10-29 }}, 1937, 1966, and 1995 revisions.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current ICA version of co-operative principles==

The Rochdale Principles, according to the 1995 ICA revision, can be summarised as follows.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ica.coop/en/whats-co-op/co-operative-identity-values-principles ICA Co-operative identity, values &amp; principles.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Voluntary and open membership===
The first of the Rochdale Principles states that co-operative societies must have an open and [[wikt:voluntary|voluntary]] membership. According to the ICA's Statement on the Co-operative Identity, "Co-operatives are voluntary organisations, open to all persons able to use their services and willing to accept the responsibilities of membership, without gender, social, racial, political or religious discrimination."

====Anti-discrimination====

To discriminate [[socially]] is to make a distinction between [[people]] on the basis of [[Social class|class]] or [[Categorization|category]]. Examples of social discrimination include [[racism|racial]], [[Religious discrimination|religious]], [[Sexism|sexual]], [[sexual orientation]], [[Disability discrimination act|disability]], and [[Ethnic persecution|ethnic]] discrimination.  To fulfil the first Rochdale Principle, a Co-operative society should not prevent anyone willing to participate from doing so on any of these grounds.  However, this does not prohibit the co-operative from setting reasonable and relevant ground rules for membership, such as residing in a specific geographic area or paying a membership fee to join, so long as all persons meeting such criteria are able to participate if they so choose.

====Motivations and rewards====

Given the voluntary nature of co-operatives, members need reasons to participate. Each person's motivations will be unique and will vary from one co-operative to another, but they will often be a combination of the following:
*Financial&amp;nbsp;– Some co-operatives are able to provide members with financial benefits.
*Quality of life&amp;nbsp;– Serving the community through a co-operative because doing service makes one's own life better is perhaps the most significant motivation for volunteering. Included here would be the benefits people get from being with other people, staying active, and above all having a sense of the value of ourselves in society that may not be as clear in other areas of life.
*Giving back&amp;nbsp;– Many people have in some way benefited from the work of a co-operative and volunteer to give back.
*Altruism&amp;nbsp;– Some volunteer for the benefit of others.
*A sense of duty&amp;nbsp;– Some see participation in community as a responsibility that comes with citizenship. In this case, they may not describe themselves as volunteers.
*Career experience&amp;nbsp;– Volunteering offers experiences that can add to career prospects.

===Democratic member control===
The second of the Rochdale Principles states that co-operative societies must have democratic member control. According to the ICA's Statement on the Co-operative Identity, “Co-operatives are democratic organizations controlled by their members, who actively participate in setting their policies and making decisions. Men and women serving as elected representatives are accountable to the membership. In primary co-operatives members have equal voting rights (one member, one vote) and co-operatives at other levels are also organised in a democratic manner.”

===Member economic participation===
Member economic participation is one of the defining features of co-operative societies, and constitutes the third Rochdale Principle in the ICA's Statement on the Co-operative Identity. According to the ICA, co-operatives are enterprises in which “Members contribute equitably to, and democratically control, the capital of their co-operative. At least part of that capital is usually the common property of the co-operative. Members usually receive limited compensation, if any, on capital subscribed as a condition of membership. Members allocate surpluses for any or all of the following purposes: developing their co-operative, possibly by setting up reserves, part of which at least would be indivisible; benefiting members in proportion to their transactions with the co-operative; and supporting other activities approved by the membership.” This principle, in turn, can be broken down into a number of constituent parts.

====Democratic control====

The first part of this principle states that “Members contribute equitably to, and democratically control, the capital of their co-operative. At least part of that capital is usually the common property of the co-operative.” This enshrines [[democracy|democratic control]] over the co-operative, and how its capital is used.

====Limitations on member compensation and appropriate use of surpluses====

The second part of the principle deals with how members are compensated for funds invested in a Co-operative, and how surpluses should be used. Unlike for-profit [[corporations]], co-operatives are a form of [[social enterprise]]. Given this, there are at least three purposes for which surplus funds can be used, or distributed, by a Co-operative.
* “Members usually receive limited compensation, if any, on capital subscribed as a condition of membership.”
* “Developing their co-operative, possibly by setting up reserves, part of which at least would be indivisible;” in other words, the surplus can be reinvested in the co-operative.
* "Benefiting members in proportion to their transactions with the co-operative;” for example, a [[Consumers' Co-operative]] may decide to pay [[dividend]]s based on purchases (or a 'divvi').
* “Supporting other activities approved by the membership.”

===Autonomy and independence===
The fourth of the Rochdale Principles states that co-operative societies must be autonomous and independent. According to the ICA's Statement on the Co-operative Identity, “Co-operatives are autonomous, self-help organizations controlled by their members. If they enter into agreements with other organizations, including governments, or raise capital from external sources, they do so on terms that ensure democratic control by their members and maintain their co-operative autonomy.”

===Education, training, and information===
The fifth of the Rochdale Principles states that co-operative societies must provide education and training to their members and the public. According to the ICA's Statement on the Co-operative Identity, “Co-operatives provide education and training for their members, elected representatives, managers and employees so they can contribute effectively to the development of their co-operatives. They inform the general public – particularly young people and opinion leaders – about the nature and benefits of co-operation.”

===Cooperation among cooperatives===
The sixth of the Rochdale Principles states that co-operatives cooperate with each other. According to the ICA's Statement on the Co-operative Identity, “Co-operatives serve their members most effectively and strengthen the co-operative movement by working together through local, national, regional and international structures.”

===Concern for community===
The seventh of the Rochdale Principles states that co-operative societies must have concern for their communities. According to the ICA's Statement on the Co-operative Identity, “Co-operatives work for the sustainable development of their communities through policies approved by their members.”

The '''Santa Fe Terminal Complex''' is an {{convert|18|acre|m2|adj=on}} complex of historic buildings in the [[Government District, Dallas|Government District]] of [[downtown Dallas|downtown]] [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]], [[Texas]] ([[United States|USA]]). Constructed in 1924 as the headquarters for the [[Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe Railway]] and the Southwest's largest merchandising center, three of the original four buildings remain today and have been renovated into various uses. Santa Fe Buildings No.&amp;nbsp;1 and No.&amp;nbsp;2 were listed in the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1997, and the buildings are [[Dallas Landmark]]s.  The Santa Fe Freight Terminal is regarded as one of the chief factors in the development of Dallas commercially.&lt;ref name="thc"&gt;http://atlas.thc.state.tx.us/common/view_narrative.asp?narrative=97000478.htm&amp;title=Sante%20Fe%20Terminal%20Buildings&amp;filepath=E:\atlas_text\nr_listed\html&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The site chosen for the terminal complex was already owned by the railroad and served by tracks connecting with the East Dallas GC&amp;SF yard. The original Santa Fe station in Dallas was built on the site in 1884 and replaced by the 1896 Richardsonian Romanesque passenger station. The latter was one of six depots belonging to different railroads which became redundant with the completion of [[Union Station (Dallas)|Union Station]] in 1916. The depot was razed and a vast, 100,000 cubic yard excavation done with the equivalent of a box car load of dynamite.

Project architect Lloyd R. Whitson, working with engineers and railroad planners from the AT&amp;SF, planned the complex so that four buildings, in a line running north to south from Commerce to Young Streets, could be served by up to three sets of underground railroad tracks branching from a central subsurface line, which emerged from the underground farther south near the present [[Dallas Convention Center]].

The complex was constructed in 1924-25 as one of the more ambitious Texas building projects of the 1920s and one of the Southwest's largest merchandising centers.&lt;ref name="thc"/&gt; All four buildings were linked by a subterranean rail tunnel served by small steam locomotives. Construction of the buildings and the {{convert|750|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} underground freight house was a massive undertaking and work continued around the clock.

'''Building No.&amp;nbsp;1''', also known as the Santa Fe Office Building, was constructed as the main building at 1114 Commerce Street and opened in late 1924. It contained 20 floors of offices and included a restaurant and drug store, and was the most elaborately decorated building of the complex. The structure featured several setbacks and ornamental arches designed in the [[Mission Revival]] style topped by a barrel vaulted roof.&lt;ref name="shell"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://atlas.thc.state.tx.us/shell-desig.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-01-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120709163423/http://atlas.thc.state.tx.us/shell-desig.htm |archivedate=2012-07-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The office building provided some of the most desirable office space in Dallas in the 1925-42 period, housing many national corporations and representatives of insurance companies. The rear of the building connected to a 10-story warehouse wing fronting Jackson Street and served as the terminus of the freight depot.

'''Building No.&amp;nbsp;2''', also known as the Garment Center, followed the same design as Building No.&amp;nbsp;1's warehouse. This structure was built as 10-story warehouses in light brown brick with large open industrial spaces and concrete columns. The building housed offices and showrooms for manufacturing companies, chemical companies, and building supplies. Near the end of construction, a 2-story structure was added on the roof of the building to serve as the clubhouse for the University Club, a major private men's club. A [[skybridge]] was erected to connect the member entrance on the eleventh floor of Santa Fe Building No.&amp;nbsp;1 with the clubhouse. The penthouse included an auditorium/great hall, library and dining room with bedrooms for resident members and nonresident members' guests on the second level. Trees, shrubs and a putting green surrounded the clubhouse. Plans were made to expand the club to the roofs of Buildings No.&amp;nbsp;1 and No.&amp;nbsp;3, but the club only used the penthouse until the late 1930s. Radio station [[WFAA]] moved into and converted the former University Club space for a broadcast station in 1940.&lt;ref name="shell"/&gt;

'''Building No.&amp;nbsp;3 and Building No.&amp;nbsp; 4''' were similar in design to the other warehouses, with each being 8 stories in height and connected to the rail tunnel. Building No.&amp;nbsp;3, also known as the Ingram Freezer Building, was designed for cold storage.

===Rail operations===
Thirty-five to forty rail cars entered the tunnel each day, pulled by a "hot water bottle" locomotive. It was specially designed to prevent smoke in the main line and its six spurs in the tunnels by being charged with steam, which would last from four to five hours from a central, high pressure boiler under the office building. A 1924 Santa Fe Magazine article called the engine a "unique feature in locomotive construction, only one other of its type being in existence." They remained in service until about 1950, when diesel locomotives assumed the duty. Rail cars carried goods into the buildings and then the 21 freight elevators lifted merchandise to upper-level showrooms and first-floor trucking platforms.

===Change of ownership===
In 1942 the United States Government acquired Building No.&amp;nbsp;1 by eminent domain, converting portions of the building to serve as headquarters for the U.S. Army 8th Service Command as well as an enlistment center. Thousands of draftees, after reporting to the enlistment center in Building No. 1, proceeded to platforms beneath the buildings where they boarded trains bound for training centers. Informal sources suggest the building has among the strongest associations with the war effort of any building in North Texas.

After the government's acquisition of the complex, the warehouse buildings passed into various ownership. Construction of the nearby [[Dallas Convention Center]] severed the link to the main rail lines, and over time the warehouses became vacant. Santa Fe Building No.&amp;nbsp;3 was demolished in 1988 and replaced with a large parking lot.&lt;ref name="dnews"&gt;{{cite web|title=1924: Santa Fe tunnels|url=http://www.dallasnews.com/s/dws/spe/2002/hiddenhistory/1901-1925/070002dnhhtunnels.44332667.html |accessdate=August 21, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090211232137/http://www.dallasnews.com/s/dws/spe/2002/hiddenhistory/1901-1925/070002dnhhtunnels.44332667.html |archivedate=February 11, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Santa Fe Buildings No.&amp;nbsp;1 and No.&amp;nbsp;2 were listed in the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1997 and renovated over the years, although the isolated No.&amp;nbsp;4 building remained abandoned for many years.

==Current use==
Santa Fe Building No.&amp;nbsp;1 still houses offices for the federal government, with additional space in the adjacent [[Earle Cabell Federal Building and Courthouse]]. Santa Fe Building No.&amp;nbsp;2 was redeveloped into SoCo Urban lofts. Santa Fe Building No.&amp;nbsp;4, at the complex's southernmost point, reopened in 2009 as the downtown Dallas [[Aloft Hotels|Aloft Hotel]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/news/localnews/stories/DN-dalhotel_27met.ART.State.Edition1.50adf87.html&lt;/ref&gt; Remnants of the tunnels still remain in the buildings today.&lt;ref name="dnews"/&gt;

}}
'''Vito Gamberale''' (born 1944) is an Italian manager.&lt;br /&gt;
In 1968 he obtained his master's degree in mechanical engineering at [[La Sapienza]] University in Rome,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uniroma1.it/&lt;/ref&gt; and started working as assistant professor at the mechanical Engineering department.
From 1968 to 1969 he worked at [[Azienda Nazionale Idrogenazione Combustibili]] ([[Eni]] group's society) in Milan; later he became the [[Istituto Mobiliare Italiano]] (IMI)'s evaluation expert in textile, clothing, iron and steel, and mechanical industries, until 1977.

He worked in GEPI SpA (a state-owned group), as acquisitions and privatizations manager, until 1984. Later, he held top offices in companies controlled by the Eni group and he settled the textile industry privatization (Lanerossi and [[Marzotto]]). In 1991 he left the company to work at the [[STET - Società Finanziaria Telefonica|STET]] group, and held a primary role in telecommunication companies as [[CEO]]. In 1995 he established [[Telecom Italia Mobile]] SpA leading Italy to reach the highest [[mobile phone penetration rate]] worldwide.

His daughter, Chiara Gamberale – a well-known writer and anchor woman – (then only seventeen) drew on that event to write her first novel, "Una vita sottile" (Marsilio, 1999), turned into a fiction for the [[RAI]].

In 1997, the company privatization and the new share structure got him to resign from general director of [[Telecom Italia]].
In 1998 Vito Gamberale joined the [[Benetton Group]] with the aim of taking part in the [[Autostrade]] privatization. He became vicepresident of 21 Investimenti SpA, an industrial participation company controlled by Benetton, [[Banca Intesa]], [[Deutsche Bank]] and [[Assicurazioni Generali]].
In 2000, he became CEO of Autostrade SpA, European leader among motorways construction and management concessionaires; under his management, the group [[EBITDA]] grew from 1 to 2 billion euro. When the property announced a merger project with the [[Abertis]] Spanish company, he did not agree and resigned (2006).

Gamberale had a quick experience as [[Italian Football Federation]] (FIGC) deputy commissioner while Guido Rossi was commissioner and general manager.
After that, he worked to create F2i SGR (Italian Funds for Infrastructures asset management company - [[Fondi Italiani per le Infrastrutture SGR]]),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.f2isgr.it/f2isgr/index.html
{{Failed verification|date=March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; a company that would manage close-end investment fund dedicated to long-term investments (maximum 15 years) in the infrastructure sector.
In 2007 he received the [[laurea honoris causa]] in Telecommunication Engineering.
He is the President of “Amici della speranza”,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.amicidellasperanza.it/&lt;/ref&gt; a non-profit group supporting the San Giovanni Hospital haematology ward in Rome.

On October 21, 2014, Gamberale resigned as CEO of F2i SGR.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.f2isgr.it/en/allegati/comunicati_stampa/F2i_CS70_ENG.pdf Renato Ravanelli, Chief Executive Officer ad F2i]&lt;/ref&gt;

From July 2015 to September 2018 He was Chairman of Quercus Assets Selection&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20150716005656/en/Vito-Gamberale-Appointed-Chairman-Quercus-Assets-Selection Vito Gamberale Appointed as Chairman of Quercus Assets Selection]&lt;/ref&gt;, a fund specialized in utility-scale renewable Energy infrastructure investments.

In June 2015 he entered the share capital and was appointed Chairman of Iterchimica&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iterchimica.it/en/vito-gamberale-president-iterchimica/ Eng. Vito Gamberale nominated President of Iterchimica S.r.l.]&lt;/ref&gt;,  an Italian company which operates in over 70 countries, producing and distributing products for the enhancement of asphalt performance and the laying of road surfaces.
