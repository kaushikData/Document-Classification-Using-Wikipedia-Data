:''For the fictional character in the Marvel Universe series, see [[Ahura (comics)]]; for the river, see [[Akhurian River]].''
'''Ahura''' (Avestan: ê¨Äê¨µê¨éê¨≠ê¨Ä) is an [[Avestan language]] designation for a particular class of [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] angelic divinities.

==Etymology==
[[Avestan]] ''ahura'' "lord" derives from [[Proto-Indo-Iranian language|Indo-Iranian]] ''*H√°suras'', also attested in an Indian context as [[Rigvedic]] ''[[asura]]''. As suggested by the similarity to the [[Old Norse]] ''[[√¶sir]]'', Indo-Iranian ''*H√°suras'' may have an even earlier [[Proto-Indo-European language|Indo-European]] root.

It is commonly supposed{{sfn|Thieme|1960|p=308}}{{sfn|Gershevitch|1964|p=23}}{{sfn|Kuiper|1983|p=682}} that Indo-Iranian ''*H√°suras'' was the proper name of a specific divinity with whom other divinities were later identified. 

For obscure reasons, the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] lists ''asura'', rather than ''ahura'', as a Zoroastrian term.

==In scripture==
===Gathas===
In the [[Gathas]], the oldest hymns of Zoroastrianism and thought to have been composed by [[Zoroaster]] himself, the prophet exhorts his followers to pay reverence to only the ''ahura''s and to rebuff the [[daeva|''daeva''s]] and others who act ''"at Lie's command"''. That should not, however, be construed to reflect a view of a primordial opposition. Although the ''daeva''s would, in later Zoroastrian tradition, appear as malign creatures, in the Gathas the ''daeva''s are (collectively) gods that are to be rejected.

In the Gathas, the prophet does not specify which of the divinities other than [[Ahura Mazda]] are considered to be  ''ahura''s.

===Younger Avesta===
In the ''Fravaraneh'', the Zoroastrian credo summarized in ''[[Yasna]]'' 12.1, the adherent declares: "I profess myself a Mazda worshiper, a follower of the teachings of Zoroaster, rejecting the ''daevas'', ... " This effectively defines ''ahura'' by defining what ''ahura'' is not.

In the Younger [[Avesta]], three divinities of the Zoroastrian pantheon are repeatedly identified as ahuric. These three are [[Ahura Mazda]], [[Mithra]], and [[Apam Napat]], the "Ahuric triad". Other divinities with whom the term "Ahuric" is associated include the six [[Amesha Spenta]]s, and (notable among the lesser [[yazata|''yazata''s]]) [[Aredvi Sura Anahita|Aredvi Sura]] of the Waters and [[Ashi]] of Reward and Recompense.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8124">The '''All-night vigil''' is a service of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] (and Eastern Catholic Church) consisting of an aggregation of the three [[canonical hours]] of [[Vespers]], [[Matins]], and the [[First Hour]].  The vigil is celebrated on the eves of Sundays and of major liturgical feasts.&lt;ref name="dunlop"&gt;{{cite book

The [[vigil]] has been set to music most famously by [[Sergei Rachmaninoff]], whose [[All-Night Vigil (Rachmaninoff)|setting]] of selections from the service is one of his most admired works. [[Tchaikovsky]]'s [[All-Night Vigil (Tchaikovsky)|setting]] of the all-night vigil, along with his [[Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom (Tchaikovsky)|Divine Liturgy]] and his collection of nine sacred songs were of seminal importance in the later interest in Orthodox music in general, and settings of the all-night vigil in particular.{{sfn|''The Cambridge History of Russia''|2006|p=115}}{{sfn|Swain|2006|p=212}}{{sfn|Morozan|2013}} Other musical settings include those by [[Pavel Grigorievich Chesnokov|Chesnokov]], [[Alexander Gretchaninov|Grechaninov]], [[Mikhail Ippolitov-Ivanov|Ippolitov-Ivanov]], Alexander Kastalsky,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Order==
When celebrated at the All-night vigil, the orders of Great Vespers and Matins vary somewhat from when they are celebrated by themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://biserica.org/Publicatii/ServiceBook/Gvespers.htm|title=The Order of Great Vespers|work=The Priest's Service Book|publisher=Diocese of the South|accessdate=2007-03-06| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070330103441/http://biserica.org/Publicatii/ServiceBook/Gvespers.htm| archivedate= 30 March 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://biserica.org/Publicatii/ServiceBook/Smatins.htm|title=The Order of Matins on Sundays and Feast Days|work=The Priest's Service Book|publisher=Diocese of the South|accessdate=2007-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In parish usage, many portions of the service such as the readings from the Synaxarion during the Canon at Matins are abbreviated or omitted, and it therefore takes approximately two or two and a half hours to perform.

His novels have been translated around the world. He has won two Edgars from the Mystery Writers of America, the Thumping Good Read Award from W.H. Smith, and been nominated for Anthonys and the International Thriller Writers award.

''True Crime'' was filmed by Clint Eastwood in 1999. ''Don‚Äôt Say a Word'' was filmed starring Michael Douglas in 2001. Donald Cammell‚Äôs 1987 cult classic ''White of the Eye'' was based on the novel ''Mrs. White'', which Klavan co-wrote under the pseudonym Margaret Tracy with his brother, playwright Laurence Klavan. Andrew wrote the screenplay for the 1990 Michael Caine film ''Shock to the System,'' based on the novel by Simon Brett, and for the hit 2008 horror film ''One Missed Call'', which starred Shannyn Sossamon and Ed Burns. He also wrote the screenplay for the award winning movie-in-an-app ''Haunting Melissa'' and its sequel ''Haunting Melissa 2: Dark Hearts.'' He recently scripted ''Gosnell'', a crime film based on the true story of an abortion doctor charged with murder.

As an essayist, Klavan has written for the ''[https://www.wsj.com/articles/faith-that-upholds-humanityand-liberty-1483053830 Wall Street Journal]'', the ''[https://www.nytimes.com/2001/10/05/opinion/at-the-movies-losing-our-fears.html New York Times]'', the ''[http://articles.latimes.com/2010/nov/02/opinion/la-oe-klavan-toy-story-3-20101102 Los Angeles Times]'', the ''[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/10/10/AR2008101002454.html Washington Post]'' and elsewhere. A contributing editor to the Manhattan Institute‚Äôs ''[https://www.city-journal.org/contributor/andrew-klavan_525 City Journal]'', he has produced articles ranging from an examination of the poet William Wordsworth to a description of his 2008 embed with American troops in Afghanistan.

Klavan has produced several popular series of satirical online videos including ''Klavan on the Culture, The Revolting Truth,'' and ''A Very Serious Commentary'' for Glenn Beck''.'' He currently releases a daily podcast for t''he Daily Wire.'' Klavan's most recent book was a memoir of his spiritual journey, ''The Great Good Thing: A Secular Jew Comes to Faith in Christ.''

=== Awards ===
Klavan has received a number of award wins and nomination in the various mystery-genre awards ceremonies. ''Mrs. White'', which he wrote under the pen-name Margaret Tracy, won the 1984 [[Edgar Award]] for "Best Paperback Original".&lt;ref name="ed1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mysterynet.com/edgars/previous/original/ |title=Best Paperback Original Mystery Novel Edgar Award Winners and Nominees - Complete Lists |publisher=Mysterynet.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Klavan's next win came in 1989, with his novel ''Trapdoor'' (this time as Keith Peterson) picking up a nomination again in the "Best Paperback Original" category.&lt;ref name="ed1"/&gt; The following year he won the Edgar Award in this same category for ''The Rain'', as well as a nomination at the [[Bouchercon XXI#Anthony Awards|1990 Anthony Awards]] for ''Rough Justice'' again in the paperback running.&lt;ref name="ed1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="anthony"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bouchercon.info/nominees.html |title=Bouchercon World Mystery Convention : Anthony Awards Nominees |publisher=Bouchercon.info |date=2003-10-02 |accessdate=2012-03-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207060829/http://www.bouchercon.info/nominees.html |archivedate=2012-02-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Klavan was nominated under his own name for the first time in 1992 for his novel ''Don't Say a Word'', which was nominated for the "Best Novel" Edgar Award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mysterynet.com/edgars/previous/novel/ |title=Best Mystery Novel Edgar Award Winners and Nominees - Complete Lists |publisher=Mysterynet.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; He received another [[Anthony Awards]] nomination at the [[Bouchercon XXVII#Anthony Awards|1996 ceremony]] for his novel, ''True Crime'', again for "Best Novel".&lt;ref name="anthony"/&gt;

During the final war between the [[Nephites]] and the [[Lamanites]], at the cataclysmic [[Battle of Cumorah]], Antionum and his entire army of ten thousand men were killed, along with the other dozens of Nephite military commanders and their armies of ten thousand apiece.  The Battle of Cumorah marked the end of the Nephite civilization.

'''''Ardaas''''' is a [[Balmiki]] ritual performed in the [[Ashram (Balmiki)|Ashram]] at the beginning of the community service called [[Puja (Hinduism)|Puja]]. It is performed standing facing the [[murti]] of [[Valmiki]] with hands folded, and the following words are repeated (in Punjabi):&lt;ref&gt;Amarjit Thaper, Wolverhampton Balmiki Ashram, Steelhouse Lane/Cable Street, Wolverhampton&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Oh Lord we stand before you and pray, we beg for your protection.
Bless us to call upon you with every breath we take and beg you to protect us from all sins, guide us so that we always pray to you. Bless us so that we always do good deeds Oh Lord and Creator of all things.
Bless us with peace of mind and infinite wisdom, show us the way of righteousness so our soul be cleansed. Bless us so that we never forget your teaching Oh Lord and that we shall sing your praises, light candles and incense, Oh Lord those who pray to you with all their heart shall go and meet you in heaven.
Oh Lord those who read and listen to your holy scriptures, you are so merciful upon them.
Oh Lord we beg you to show us the way so that we can be spared from evil.

Assists are claimed to address the spirit, the person themselves, in bringing about a speedier recovery from illness and injury. For this reason it is made very clear that Assists do not "heal the body", it is the spirit that helps heal the body and that is what assists are actually addressing and there are many records where parishioners of the Church have attested to their effectiveness either receiving or administering them.

There are many different types of Assists that anyone can easily and swiftly learn to do at home for aiding recovery of all manner of illnesses, accidents and injuries and even domestic upsets, of any and all age groups including babies and even pets. There are also assists to, Scientologists believe, help make someone sober or recover from the loss of a loved one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hubbard|first1=L. Ron|title=Assists for Illness and Injuries|date=1994|publisher=Bridge Publications|isbn=9780884049135|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7Ig0RcHSCbEC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=isbn:0884049132&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiLj4_1junMAhVBaT4KHaGVDBwQ6AEIHTAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

No drugs or medication are used. They are not intended to replace competent professional medical treatment, which is why they are correctly called ASSISTS and not "medicine" or "healing". They are thought to assist the ill or injured person themselves to recover more swiftly in the way they were designed and prescribed, as well as in conjunction with competent professional medical treatment where necessary. Assists can and often are administered without any medical treatment necessary, but does not replace it when it is necessary. {{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}

Thousands of examples of miraculous results of Assists are claimed.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}

The Church and its founder have been accused of unauthorized "healing" or "practicing medicine" (i.e. addressing the body) with Assists, when internal publications within the Church on Assist procedure state this is not the case.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.minnpost.com/global-post/2011/04/scientology%E2%80%99s-global-disaster-squad&lt;/ref&gt;

In the past, the Church of Scientology has received negative attention from law enforcement and regulatory agencies for practicing medicine without proper licensing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, even though assists are intended to treat pain, injuries, and even death, modern Church of Scientology publications are careful to note that they are not intended to replace medicine, since it often goes against current scientific understanding of the subject and may result in direct conflict with the relevant authorities.

As the ''[[Scientology Handbook]]'' (1994 edition) states, "Medical examination and diagnosis should be sought where needed, and where treatment is routinely successful, medical treatment should be obtained.  An assist is not a substitute for medical treatment and does not attempt to cure injuries requiring medical aid, but is complementary (adds) to it."&lt;ref name="Heal Himself"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scientologyhandbook.org/SH6_2.HTM|title=Helping an Individual Heal Himself|work=Scientology Handbook|publisher=Church of Scientology International|accessdate=2009-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Types of assists==

===The "Bring Back to Life" Assist===
This action is supposed to resuscitate a person who has recently died, or "done a bunk," by speaking to or shouting commands at their corpse within a few minutes of his or her death.  Scientology founder [[L. Ron Hubbard]] described the process in his 1972 lecture "Illness Breakthrough":
&lt;blockquote&gt;I was just a couple of minutes late. State cops were in my way, but a Negro had been drowned and I was just... They were in my road to a point where I couldn‚Äôt get to the guy and tell him to pick up the body again, where he would have, don‚Äôt you see. And they were busy resuscitating him and that was the end of that. It was too late. He really had done a bunk. He finished.&lt;br /&gt; 
&lt;br /&gt; 
We‚Äôve actually brought little kids back to life and that sort of thing‚Äîjust tell them ‚Äúpick up the body,‚Äù you know. Now, you just tell them with [[Emotional tone scale|Tone 40]], just say it around the vicinity.&lt;br /&gt; 
&lt;br /&gt; 
They‚Äôre still around. And back they come again.&lt;ref name=Breakthrough /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;

Description of the Bring Back to Life Assist also appears in official orders entitled HCO BULLETIN OF 8 APRIL 1988:

&lt;blockquote&gt;If a person has done a bunk, you can simply order him to come back and bring the body to life. The commands are addressed to the person and should be given in a tone of authority.&lt;br /&gt; 
&lt;br /&gt; 
It would be as simple as commanding, ‚ÄúCome back and bring this body to life!‚Äù Or ordering the person, ‚ÄúCome back here and pick up your body! At once! Pick it up! I order you! Right now!‚Äù&lt;br /&gt; 
&lt;br /&gt; 
You just keep commanding him with Tone 40. He is still around and can be gotten to come back again.&lt;br /&gt; 
&lt;br /&gt; 
There is another means of bringing a person back to life. You can coax the person back. In one case, an auditor pleaded along the lines that the person should remember her husband, should think of her children, and so on, all with no response. He couldn‚Äôt get her to pick up the body at all. Finally, the auditor said, ‚ÄúThink of your poor auditor!‚Äù at which point she came back and brought the body to life.&lt;br /&gt; 
&lt;br /&gt; 
Once you have brought the person back to life, that is the end of this assist action.&lt;ref name=HCO /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Touch assist===
{{Main|Touch assist}}
Scientologists are taught that all physical illnesses are caused by lack of communication with the ill body part.&lt;ref&gt;''Scientology Handbook''. "Every single physical illness stems from a failure of the being to communicate with the thing or area that is ill."&lt;/ref&gt; In the touch assist, a Scientologist repeatedly touches a person near the injury and while calling attention to the touch. This process is claimed to reestablish communication and promote healing.

===Contact assist===
According to the ''Scientology Handbook'' (pg.207), "There is a basic principle in Scientology which consists of putting an injured body member exactly on and in the place it was injured. Doing this can have a therapeutic effect and is called a Contact Assist."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scientologyhandbook.org/SH6_3.HTM |title=Contact Assist - Assists for Illnesses and Injuries, How can Scientology help me |publisher=Church of Scientology International |date= |accessdate=2009-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Handbook'' then goes on to give an example:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Let‚Äôs say a child stubbed his shin on the lawn mower and now doesn‚Äôt want to come nearer than one hundred feet from that lawn mower. You would make him do a Contact Assist with his shin and body at that point (one hundred feet from the same lawn mower), having him go through the motions of the accident. Gradually, gradient by gradient, you narrow the distance that he is willing to approach it and eventually he will go up and do a Contact Assist on the lawn mower."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scientologyhandbook.org/SH6_3.HTM |title=Contact Assist - Assists for Illnesses and Injuries, How can Scientology help me |publisher=Scientologyhandbook.org |date= |accessdate=2009-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Nerve assist===
The Nerve Assist is based on Scientology's teaching that [[standing wave]]s of energy can form in nerves and cause pain. The assist involves stroking a person along the spine, around the torso, and down the limbs. This process is claimed to dissipate the standing wave. There is, however, no evidence at all to suggest that standing waves are present in the spinal cord or that pain is stored in the nerves. Other information given by the Church of Scientology about the anatomical effects of nerve assists are patently false (e.g.: There are not 12 major nerves in the spinal cord&lt;ref&gt;http://northeastspineandsports.com/important-nerves-in-the-body-and-what-they-do/&lt;/ref&gt;).

===Unconscious person assist===
This assist is intended for "a person who is unconscious, even someone who has been in a long-continued coma". The person doing the assist takes the unconscious person's hand and places it on various objects, commanding them to feel it as they go along. The idea is to reach not only the person's subconscious mind, but the person's [[Thetan]]. The ''Handbook'' states: "Don‚Äôt fall for the belief that ‚Äúunconscious‚Äù people are unable to think or be aware in any way. A thetan is seldom unconscious regardless of what the body is doing or not doing". It also notes: "If you are handling a person in a coma, you may not get him back to consciousness in a single assist session."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scientologyhandbook.org/SH6_9.HTM |title=Unconscious Person Assist - Assists for Illnesses and Injuries, How can Scientology help me |publisher=Church of Scientology International |date= |accessdate=2009-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Locational processing assist===
In this assist, one simply points to various objects and asks the subject to acknowledge them. The purpose is "directing a person‚Äôs attention off the painful area of his body or his difficulties and out onto the environment." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scientologyhandbook.org/SH6_7.HTM |title=Locational Processing Assist - Assists for Illnesses and Injuries, How can Scientology help me |publisher=Church of Scientology International |date= |accessdate=2009-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Locational Processing Assist is touted as an antidote to alcohol intoxication. The ''Handbook'' claims "It can make a drunk person sober in a very few minutes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scientologyhandbook.org/SH6_8.HTM |title=How to Make a Person Sober - Assists for Illnesses and Injuries, How can Scientology help me |publisher=Church of Scientology International |date= |accessdate=2009-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research materials==
* L. Ron Hubbard's ''Assists Processing Handbook'' lists over 130 different Scientology Assists, giving "detailed instructions for assists to handle toothaches, a fight with a spouse, nosebleeds, newborn babies, people with fevers, even a person in coma".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rehabilitatenz.co.nz/pages/assists-handbook.html |title=RehabilitateNZ / Assists To Handle Toothaches, A Fight With A Spouse, Nosebleeds, Newborn Babies |publisher=RehabilitateNZ |date= |accessdate=2009-10-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100524234055/http://www.rehabilitatenz.co.nz/pages/assists-handbook.html |archivedate=2010-05-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Scientology book ''Assists for Illnesses and Injuries'' deals with the most common and basic Assists, such as the ones described here.
* The basic Assists are also covered in ''The Scientology Handbook''.

'''Biblical and Talmudic units of measurement''' were used primarily by ancient [[Israelites]] and appear frequently within the [[Hebrew Bible]] as well as in later [[Judaism|Judaic]] scripture, such as the [[Mishnah]] and [[Talmud]]. These units of measurement are still an important part of Jewish life today.
There is much debate within Judaism, as well as by outside scholars, about the exact relationship between measurements in the system and those in other [[system of measurement|measurement systems]]. Classical statements, such as that an ''Etzba'' was seven [[barley]]corns laid side by side, or that a ''Log'' was equal to six medium-sized eggs, are so indefinite and vague as to be nearly useless.
Nevertheless, the entire system of measurement corresponds almost exactly with [[Ancient Mesopotamian units of measurement|the Babylonian system]], and in all probability the Israelite measurement system was derived from the Babylonian measurement system, with some lesser level of influence from [[Ancient Egyptian units of measurement|the Egyptian system]].&lt;ref name="Jewish Encyclopedia"&gt;''[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]''&lt;/ref&gt; It may therefore be assumed that the relationship between the Israelite measurements and contemporary units is the same as the relationship between the Babylonian system and contemporary units.&lt;ref name="Jewish Encyclopedia"/&gt;

Note: The listed measurements of this system range from the lowest to highest acceptable [[Halakha|halachic value]], in terms of conversion to either English or SI units.

== Length and distance ==
The original measures of length were clearly derived from the human body ‚Äî the finger, hand, arm, span, foot, and pace ‚Äî but since these measures differ between individuals, they are reduced to a certain standard for general use. The Israelite system thus used divisions of the '''[[digit (unit)|digit]]''' or fingerbreadth (Hebrew: ◊ê◊¶◊ë◊¢, ''Etzba''; plural ''etzba'ot''), the '''[[Palm (measurement)|palm]]''' or handbreadth (Hebrew: ◊ò◊§◊ó, ''Tefah''/''Tefach''; plural ''Tefahim''/''Tefachim''), the '''[[span (measurement)|span]]''' (Hebrew: ◊ñ◊®◊™, ''Zeret''), the '''[[ell]]''' (Hebrew: ◊ê◊û◊î, ''Amah'', plural ''Amot''), the '''mile''' (Hebrew: ◊û◊ô◊ú, ''Mil''; plural ''milin''), and the '''parsa''' (Hebrew: ◊§◊®◊°◊î, ''Parasa''). The latter two are [[loan word]]s into the Hebrew language, and borrowed measurements - the [[Roman mile|Latin ''mille'']], and [[Iranian languages|Iranian]] ''[[parasang]]'', respectively; both were units of [[wikt:itinerant|itinerant]] distance, and thus varied according to terrain and stride length, and, in the case of the ''parasang'', also on the speed of travel.

The Israelite measurements were related as follows:
* 1 palm (''Tefach'') = 4 digit (''Etzba'ot'')
* 1 span (''Zeret'') = 3 palms (''Tefahim'')
* 1 ell (''Amah'') = 2 spans (''Zeret'')
* 1 [[Biblical mile|mil]] (''Mil'') = 2000 ells (''Amot'')
* 1 parasang (''Parasa'') = 4 mils (''Milin'')

=== Discrepancies of ell ===
{{details|ell}}

The biblical ''ell'' is closely related to the [[cubit]], but two different factors are given in the Bible; Ezekiel's measurements imply that the ell was equal to 1 cubit plus 1 palm (''Tefah''),&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref|Ezekiel|40:5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref|Ezekiel|43:13}}&lt;/ref&gt; while elsewhere in the Bible, the ell is equated with 1 cubit exactly. Ezekiel's ell, by which he gave measurements in his guided vision through a future Jerusalem Temple, is thus one sixth larger than the standard ell, for which an explanation seems to be suggested by the [[Book of Chronicles]]; the Chronicler writes that Solomon's Temple was built according to "cubits following the first measure",&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref|2|Chronicles|3:3|}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting that over the course of time the original ell was supplanted by a smaller one.&lt;ref name="Jewish Encyclopedia"/&gt; The Egyptians also used two different ells, one of which ‚Äî the ''royal'' ell ‚Äî was a sixth larger than the common ell;&lt;ref name="Jewish Encyclopedia"/&gt; this ''royal'' measurement was the earlier of the two in Egyptian use, and the one which the [[Pyramid]]s of the 3rd and 4th Dynasties seem to be measured in integer multiples of.&lt;ref name="Peakes"&gt;''[[Peake's commentary on the Bible]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

The smaller of the Egyptian ells measured {{convert|17.72|in|cm|sp=us|abbr=on|0}}, but the standard Babylonian ell, cast in stone on one of the [[statues of Gudea|statues of King Gudea]], was 49.5&amp;nbsp;cm (19.49&amp;nbsp;in), and the larger Egyptian ell was between 52.5 and 52.8&amp;nbsp;cm (20.67 and 20.79&amp;nbsp;in).&lt;ref name="Jewish Encyclopedia"/&gt; The [[Books of Samuel]] portray the Temple as having a [[Phoenicia]]n architect, and in Phoenicia it was the Babylonian ell which was used to measure the size of parts of ships.&lt;ref name="Jewish Encyclopedia"/&gt; Thus scholars are uncertain whether the standard Biblical ell would have been 49.5 or 52.5&amp;nbsp;cm (19.49 or 20.67&amp;nbsp;in), but are fairly certain that it was one of these two figures.&lt;ref name="Jewish Encyclopedia"/&gt; From these figures for the size of a Biblical ell, that of the basic unit ‚Äî the finger-breadth (''Etzba'') ‚Äî can be calculated to be either 2.1 or 2.2&amp;nbsp;cm (0.83 or 0.87&amp;nbsp;in); Rav [[Avraham Chaim Naeh]] approximates at 2&amp;nbsp;cm (0.79&amp;nbsp;in); Talmudic scholar [[Chazon Ish]] at 2.38&amp;nbsp;cm (0.94&amp;nbsp;in). The ''mile'' (''Mil'') is thus about 963 or 1146 meters (3160 or 3760&amp;nbsp;ft) ‚Äî approximately six or seven tenths of a mile, and significantly shorter than the modern statute or land [[mile]] of 5280&amp;nbsp;ft or 1760 yd (approximately 1.6&amp;nbsp;km).

The precise width of the ''etzba'' (finger) has been a subject of controversy among halakhic authorities. The best known are those of the Rav Chayim No'eh and Chazon Ish.

See also Rabbi Chaim P. Benish's "Midos V'Shiurei Torah" where he brings an alternative view in understanding the ''Rambam'' and therefore suggests that the ''etsba'', according to the ''Rambam'', is 0.748‚Äì0.756&amp;nbsp;in (1.90‚Äì1.92&amp;nbsp;cm). This would affect the other measurements in the following ways: ''Tefah'' 2.99‚Äì3.02&amp;nbsp;in (7.59‚Äì7.67&amp;nbsp;cm); ''Zeret'' 8.98‚Äì9.07&amp;nbsp;in (22.81‚Äì23.03&amp;nbsp;cm); ''Amah'' 17.95‚Äì18.14&amp;nbsp;in (45.59‚Äì46.08&amp;nbsp;cm).

Alternatively, according to some early authorities{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} a ''zeret'' is two ''tefahim'' instead of three.

===Talmudic additions===
To the somewhat simple system of distance, the Talmud adds a few more units, namely the '''double palm''' (Hebrew: ◊ó◊°◊ô◊ò, ''hasit''), the '''pace''' (Hebrew: ◊§◊°◊ô◊¢◊î, ''pesiah''), the '''cord''' (Hebrew: ◊ó◊ë◊ú, ''hebel''), the '''stadium''' (Hebrew: ◊®◊ô◊°, ''ris''), the '''day's journey''' (Hebrew:◊ì◊®◊ö ◊ô◊ï◊ù, ''derekh yom''), and an undetermined quantity named the '''garmida''' (Hebrew: ◊í◊®◊û◊ô◊ì◊ê). The ''stadium'' appears to have been adopted from Persia, while the ''double palm'' seems to have been derived from the Greek ''[[dichas]]''.&lt;ref name="Jewish Encyclopedia"/&gt;
The relationship between four of these ''additional'' units and the earlier system is as follows:
* 1 double palm (''hasit'') = 2 palms (''tefah'')
* 1 pace (''pesiah'') = 1 ell (''amah'')
* 1 stadium (''ris'') = 1600 palms (2/15 mile) (''tefah''). {{citation needed|date=September 2017}} Others say that 1 stadium was equivalent to 470‚Äì500 [[cubits]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Josephus]], ''[[Antiquities of the Jews|Antiquities]]'' (15.11.3; XV.415‚Äì416), who described the dimensions of the [[Temple Mount]] in the following terms (apparently not including the extension made to the Temple Mount): ‚ÄúThis hill was walled all round, and in compass four furlongs; [the distance of] each angle containing in length a furlong (Gr. ''stadion'').‚Äù Compare [[Mishnah]] [http://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Middot.2.1?lang=bi ''Middot'' 2:1] which states that the Temple Mount measured five-hundred cubits (Heb. ''amah'') by five-hundred cubits. If it can be ascertained that Josephus' ''stadion'' is equivalent to the 500 cubits mentioned in the Mishnah, and being that the Southern Wall measured 281 meters, this would place each cubit (Heb. ''amah'') at 56.205 cm. Rabbi [[Saadia Gaon]], on the other hand, holds that a ''stadion'' was equivalent to only 470 cubits (v. Uziel Fuchs, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/24174679?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents ''"Millot HaMishnah" by R. Saadia Gaon ‚Äî the First Commentary to the Mishnah''], Sidra: A Journal for the Study of Rabbinic Literature, pub. [[Bar-Ilan University]] Press (2014), p. 66), in which case , each cubit was 59.792 cm, close to the 60 cm. cubit espoused by the [[Chazon-Ish]]. Moreover, Josephus, in his ''[[The Life of Flavius Josephus|Vita]]'' (¬ß 12), says that ''Bethmaus'' (Heb. '''◊ë◊ô◊™ ◊û◊¢◊ï◊ü''') was distant from Tiberias four ''stadia'', or what was actually one [[biblical mile]]; meaning, each ''stadia'' equalled roughly 500 cubits.&lt;/ref&gt;  
* 1 day's journey (''derekh yom'') = 10 parasangs (''parasa'')

The other two additional units are more ambiguous. The ''garmida'' is mentioned repeatedly but without its size being indicated; it is even sometimes treated as an area,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Baba Batra]]'', 27a&lt;/ref&gt; and as a volume.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Erubin]]'', 14b&lt;/ref&gt; The ''cord'' is given two different definitions; in the [[Mishnah]] it is 50 ells,&lt;ref&gt;''Erubin'', 5:4&lt;/ref&gt; but in the [[Gemara]] it is only 4 ells.&lt;ref&gt;''Erubin'', 58b&lt;/ref&gt;

==Area==
The Israelite system of measuring area was fairly informal; the biblical text merely measures areas by describing how much land could be sown with a certain volume measure of seed, for example the amount of land able to be sown with 2 ''seah''s of barley.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|1|Kings|18:32|}}&lt;/ref&gt; The closest thing to a formal area unit was the '''yoke''' (Hebrew ''semed'')&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref||Isaiah|5:10|}}&lt;/ref&gt; (sometimes translated as ''acre''), which referred to the amount of land that a pair of yoked oxen could plough in a single day; in [[Mesopotamia]] the standard estimate for this was 6,480 square cubits, which is roughly equal to a third of an [[acre]].&lt;ref name="Peakes"/&gt;

"Beit seah" ({{Lang-he-n|'''◊ë◊ô◊™ ◊°◊ê◊î'''}}) - (pl. ''batei seah'') space for sowing a ''seah'' 576 to 829.5 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (689-992 yd&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)

"Beit kor" ({{Lang-he-n|'''◊ë◊ô◊™ ◊õ◊ï◊®'''}}) - (pl. ''batei kor'') space for sowing a ''kor'' of seed, or what is 30 ''seah'' in volume; the area needed is appx. 1.73 to 2.48 hectares (4.27-6.15 acres), or about 23,000 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in area.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopaedia Judaica'', vol. 2, Jerusalem 1971, s.v. Agricultural Methods and Implements in Ancient Ere·∫ì Israel (p. 395).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Volume and capacity==
The Israelite system of powder/liquid volume measurements corresponds exactly with the Babylonian system. Unlike the Egyptian system, which has units for multiples of 1, 10, 20, 40, 80, and 160 of the base unit, the Babylonian system is founded on multiples of 6 and 10, namely units of 1, 12, 24, 60, 72 (60 plus 12), 120, and 720.&lt;ref name="Jewish Encyclopedia"/&gt; The basic unit was the ''mina'', which was defined as 1 sixtieth of a ''maris'', which itself was the quantity of water equal in weight to a light royal [[talent (measurement)|talent]]; the ''maris'' was thus equal to about 30.3 litres, and hence the ''mina'' is equal to about 0.505 litres.&lt;ref name="Jewish Encyclopedia"/&gt; In the Israelite system, the term ''log'' is used in place of the Babylonian ''mina'' but the measurement is otherwise the same.&lt;ref name="Jewish Encyclopedia"/&gt;

Although they both use the ''log'' as the basic unit, the Israelites differentiated their systems of volume measure between dry and liquid states.

===Dry measure===
For dry measurements, the smallest unit was the '''egg''' (Hebrew: ''Beitza''), then came the ''Log'' (◊ú◊í), ''Kab'' (◊ß◊ë), ''Se'ah'' (◊°◊ê◊î), ''Eiphah'' (◊ê◊ô◊§◊î), ''Lethek'' (◊ú◊™◊ö), and ''Kor'' (◊õ◊ï◊®). The ''Lethek'' is mentioned only once in the [[masoretic text]], and the [[Septuagint]] translates it by the Greek term ''nebeloinou'', meaning ''wine-skin''. These measurements were related as follows:
* 6 ''Eggs'' (''Beitza'') = 1 ''Log''
* 4 ''Log'' = 1 ''Kab''
* 6 ''Kav'' = 1 ''Se'ah''
* 3 ''Se'ah'' = 1 ''Eiphah''
* 5 ''Eipha'' = 1 ''Lethek''
* 2 ''Letek'' = 1 ''Kor''

The smaller unit the [[Ke'zayit]] is, by different sources, considered equal to 1/2 a beitza, 1/3 of a beitza, or not directly related to the other units of volume.

The ''[[Omer (unit)|Omer]]'', which the [[Torah]] mentions as being equal to one-tenth of an ''Eiphah'',&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Exodus|16:36|}}&lt;/ref&gt; is equivalent to the capacity of 43.2 eggs, or what is also known as one-tenth of three ''seahs''.&lt;ref&gt;Based on the [[Aramaic Targum]] of pseudo-Jonathan ben Uzziel on Exodus 16:36 who says: "an omer is one-tenth of three ''seahs''." In Hebrew measures, 1 ''seah'' is equal to the capacity of 144 eggs. Three seahs are the equivalent of 432 eggs; one-tenth of this is 43.2 eggs (''The Mishnah'', ed. Herbert Danby, Oxford University Press: Oxford 1977, Appendix II, p. 798)&lt;/ref&gt; In dry weight, the ''omer'' weighed between 1.560 kg. to 1.770 kg., being the quantity of flour required to separate therefrom the [[dough offering]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Maimonides]] brings down its approximate weight in Egyptian ''[[dirham]]s'', writing in [[Mishnah]] ''Eduyot'' 1:2: "...And I found the rate of the dough-portion in that measurement to be approximately five-hundred and twenty ''dirhams'' of wheat flour, while all these ''dirhams'' are the Egyptian [''dirham'']." This view is repeated by [[Yosef Karo|Maran]]'s ''[[Shulhan Arukh]]'' (Hil. Hallah, [[Yoreh Deah]] ¬ß{{nbsp}}324:3) in the name of the [[Arba'ah Turim|Tur]]. In Maimonides' commentary of the Mishnah (''Eduyot'' 1:2, note 18), Rabbi [[Yosef Qafih]] explains that the weight of each Egyptian ''dirham'' was approximately 3.333 grammes, which total weight of flour requiring the separation of the dough-portion comes to appx. 1 kilo and 733 grammes. Rabbi [[Ovadiah Yosef]], in his ''Sefer Halikhot  øOlam'' (vol. 1, pp. 288-291), makes use of a different standard for the Egyptian ''dirham'', saying that it weighed appx. 3.0 grammes, meaning the minimum requirement for separating the priest's portion is 1 kilo and 560 grammes. Others (e.g. Rabbi [[Avraham Chaim Naeh]]) say the Egyptian ''dirham'' weighed appx. 3.205 grammes, which total weight for the requirement of separating the dough-portion comes to 1 kilo and 666 grammes. Rabbi Shelomo Qorah (Chief Rabbi of [[Bnei Barak]]) brings down the traditional weight used in Yemen for each ''dirham'', saying that it weighed 3.36 grammes, making the total weight for the required separation of the dough-portion to be 1 kilo and 770.72 grammes.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Torah, it is the [[Priestly Code]] which refers to the ''Omer'', rather than to the ''Se'ah'' or ''Kab'';&lt;ref name="Jewish Encyclopedia"/&gt; [[textual criticism|textual scholars]] view the Priestly Code as one of the later sources of the Torah, dating from a period when Egypt and Assyria had much more direct influence over [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Elliott Friedman]], ''Who wrote the Bible?''&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Ezekiel 45:11 both the eipha and the bath were one tenth an omer (◊î◊ï◊û◊® ''HOMeR'').  Boadt notes the word homer comes from the Hebrew for an "ass."  "It is one ass-load."&lt;ref&gt;The New Jerome Biblical Commentary, Brown, Fitzmyer, and Murphy, Printice Hall, 1990 ISMN 0-12-614934, p. 327&lt;/ref&gt;

===Liquid measure===
For liquid measure, the main units were the ''Log'', ''Hin'', and ''Bath'', related as follows:
* 1 ''Hin'' =  12 ''Logs''&lt;ref&gt;''Mishnah - with a Commentary of Moses ben Maimon'' (ed. [[Yosef Qafih]]), vol. 3, [[Mossad Harav Kook]]: Jerusalem 1967, s.v. Introduction to Tractate ''Menahoth'', p. 67 (Hebrew); a ''log'' has the capacity of six eggs. A ''hin'' is the equivalent of 12 logs.&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1 ''Bath'' = 6 ''Hin''&lt;ref name="Dever2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=William G. Dever|title=What Did the Biblical Writers Know and When Did They Know It?: What Archeology Can Tell Us About the Reality of Ancient Israel|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6-VxwC5rQtwC&amp;pg=PA215|date=10 May 2001|publisher=Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing|isbn=978-0-8028-2126-3|page=215}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Bath'', equal to 72 ''Logs'', is thus the liquid equivalent of the ''Ephah'', also equal to 72 ''Logs''. The liquid equivalent of the ''omer'', which appears without a special name, only being described as the tenth part of a bath,&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref|Ezekiel|45:14}}&lt;/ref&gt; is as much of an awkward fit as the ''omer'' itself, and is only mentioned by Ezekiel and the Priestly Code; scholars attribute the same explanation to it as with the ''Omer'' ‚Äî that it arose as a result of decimalisation.&lt;ref name="Jewish Encyclopedia"/&gt; The Omer is mentioned as a tenth of an ephah in Exodus 16:36, before the Priestly code.

According to Herbert G. May, chief editor of two classic Bible-related reference books, the bath may be archaeologically determined to have been about 22 liters (5.75 US gal) from a study of jar remains marked 'bath' and 'royal bath' from [[Tell Beit Mirsim]].&lt;ref&gt;The Interpreter's Bible, Buttrick ed., Abingden Press, Nashville, 1956, volume VI, p. 317 (p155 in the Internet Archive copy of the text)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Talmudic additions===
In Talmudic times many more measures of capacity were used, mostly of foreign origin, especially from Persia and Greece, which had both held dominance over [[Judea]] by the time the Talmud came to be created. The definitions for many of these are disputed. Those that were certain (disputed) fractions of the ''Kab'' include, in increasing order of size, ''ukla'' (◊¢◊ï◊õ◊ú◊ê), ''tuman'' (◊™◊ï◊û◊ü), and ''kapiza'' (◊ß◊§◊ô◊ñ◊ê). Those that were larger, in increasing order of size, included the ''modius'' (◊û◊ï◊ì◊ô◊ê),&lt;ref&gt;[[Babylonian Talmud]], ''Gittin'' 57a; traditionally associated with the ''seah''.&lt;/ref&gt; ''geriwa'' (geriwa), ''garab'' (◊í◊®◊ë). Of unidentified size were the ''ardaba'' (◊ê◊ì◊®◊ë), the ''kuna'' (◊õ◊ï◊†◊ê), and the ''qometz'' (◊ß◊û◊•); the latter two of these were said to equate to a ''handful''.

==Weight and coins==
The Babylonian system, which the Israelites followed, measured weight with units of the ''talent'', ''mina'', ''[[shekel]]'' (Hebrew: ◊©◊ß◊ú), and ''[[Gerah|giru]]'', related to one another as follows:
* 1 ''shekel'' = 24  ''giru''
* 1 ''mina'' = 60 ''shekels'' (later 100 zuz)
* 1 ''talent'' = 60 ''mina''

In the Israelite system, the ratio of the ''giru'' to the ''shekel'' was altered, and the ''talent'', ''mina'', and ''giru'', later went by the names ''kikkar'' (◊õ◊õ◊®), ''litra'', and ''gerah'' (◊í◊®◊î), respectively; ''litra'' is a loan word from Latin - ''libra'', meaning ''pound''.&lt;ref name="Peakes"/&gt;
The Israelite system was thus as follows:

* 1 ''shekel'' = 20 ''[[gerah]]''
* 1 ''litra'' = 60 ''shekels''
* 1 ''kikkar'' = 60 ''litra''

There were, however, different versions of the ''talent''/''kikkar'' in use; a ''royal'' and a ''common'' version. In addition, each of these forms had a heavy and a light version, with the heavy version being exactly twice the weight of the lighter form; the light ''royal'' talent was often represented in the form of a duck, while the heavy ''royal'' talent often took the form of a lion. The ''mina'' for the heavy ''royal'' talent weighed 1.01 kilograms (2.23&amp;nbsp;lbs), while that for the heavy ''common'' talent weighed only 984 grams (2.17&amp;nbsp;lbs); accordingly, the heavy ''common'' shekel would be about 15.87 grams (0.56&amp;nbsp;oz).&lt;ref name="Jewish Encyclopedia"/&gt; According to [[Josephus]], it was the heavy ''common'' talent, and its ''mina'' and ''shekel'', that was the normal measure of weight in [[Syria]] and [[Judea]];&lt;ref&gt;Josephus, ''Antiquities of the Jews'', volume 14, 106&lt;/ref&gt; Josephus also mentions an additional unit ‚Äì the ''bekah'' ‚Äì which was exactly half a shekel.

Gradually, the system was reformed, perhaps under the influence of Egypt, so that a ''mina'' was worth only 50 shekels rather than 60; to achieve this, the shekel remained the same weight, while the weight of the standard ''mina'' was reduced. [[Moses]] mandated that the standard coinage would be in single shekels of [[silver]]; thus each shekel coin would constitute about 15.86 grams (0.51 troy ounces) of pure silver. In Judea, the Biblical shekel was initially worth about 3‚Öì [[denarii]], but over time the measurement had enlarged so that it would be worth exactly four denarii.&lt;ref name="Jewish Encyclopedia"/&gt;

*"Pruta" (pl. ''prutot'') - a [[copper]] coin (Hebrew ◊§◊®◊ï◊ò◊î [[prutah]]) - 22&amp;nbsp;mg (0.34 troy grains)

* Dinar (pl. ''dinarim'' or ''dinerei'') - a Roman gold coin ([[Aureus]]) (Hebrew "Dinerei zahav") - 7.99 grams (0.257 ozt) of gold (106.25 grams or 3.416 ozt in silver)

* "Kikar" (pl. ''kikarim'') - as a gold weight, equivalent to a talent of gold - 3000 shekel

== Time ==

=== Year ===
{{main|Hebrew calendar}}
The [[Hebrew calendar]] is a [[lunar calendar]] synchronised with the seasons by [[Intercalation (timekeeping)|intercalation]], i.e. a [[lunisolar calendar]]. There are thus 12 ordinary months plus an extra month that is added in (intercalated) every few years. Some months vary in length by a day, as well. The months originally had very descriptive names, such as ''Ziv'' (meaning ''light'') and ''Ethanim'' (meaning ''strong'', perhaps in the sense of ''strong rain'' - i.e. ''[[monsoon]]''), with [[Canaan]]ite origins, but after the [[Babylonian captivity]], the names were changed to [[Babylonian calendar|the ones used by the Babylonians]]. With the Babylonian naming, the intercalary month has no special name of its own, and is merely referred to as ''[[Adar I]]'', the following month being ''Adar''/''[[Adar II]]'' (in the Babylonian calendar, it was ''Adar II'' that was considered to be the intercalary month).

=== Week ===
The Israelite month was clearly broken up into weeks, since the [[Genesis creation]] (and biblical references to [[Shabbat]]) describe a seven-day week.  The seven-day cycle is not seen as a cycle in nature and is rather a custom biblically originating from {{bibleverse||Genesis|1:3-2:3|HE}}.

The modern Hebrew calendar follows a seven-day [[Hebrew calendar#Weeks|weekly cycle]], which runs concurrently but independently of the monthly and annual cycles. The origin of Hebrew seven day week and the [[Sabbath]], as well as the true meaning of the name, is uncertain. The earliest Biblical passages which mention it (Exodus 20:10 and 24:21; Deut. 5:14; Amos 8:5) presuppose its previous existence, and analysis of all the references to it in the canon makes it plain that its observance was neither general nor altogether spontaneous in either pre-exilic or post-exilic Israel. It was probably originally connected in some manner with the cult of the moon [http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/12962-sabbath#anchor10], as indeed is suggested by the frequent mention of Sabbath and New-Moon festivals in the same sentence (Isa. 1:13; Amos 8:5; H Kings 6:23).

The names for the days of the week are simply the day number within the week. In Hebrew, these names may be abbreviated using the numerical value of the Hebrew letters, for example "Day 1, or Yom Rishon".

=== Day ===
In addition to "tomorrow" (''machar'') and "yesterday" (''etmol''), the Israelite vocabulary also contained a distinct word for ''two days ago'' (''shilshom''). ''Ma·∏•aratayim'' ("the day after tomorrow"), is a dual form of ''machar'', literally "two tomorrows". In the Bible, the day is divided up vaguely, with descriptions such as ''midnight'', and ''half-night''.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse-lb||Exodus|12:29|}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse-lb||Judges|16:3|}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse-lb||Psalms|119:62|}})&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, it is clear that the day was considered to start at [[dusk]].

By Talmudic times, the Babylonian system of dividing up the day (from sunset to sunrise, and sunrise to sunset), into '''hours''' (Hebrew: ◊©◊¢◊î, ''sha'ah''), '''parts''' (Hebrew: ◊ó◊ú◊ß, ''[[helek|heleq]]'', plural ''halaqim''), and '''moments''' (Hebrew: ◊®◊í◊¢, ''rega'', plural ''rega'im''), had been adopted; the relationship of these units was:

* 1 part  (''heleq'') = 76 moments  (''rega'im'') (each moment, ''rega'', is 0.04386 of a second; 22.8 ''rega'im'' is 1 second)
* 1 hour (''sha'ah'') = 1080 parts (''halaqim'') (each ''heleq'' is 3‚Öì seconds)
* 1 day = 24 hours (''sha'ah'')

To complicate matters, [[Halakha]], speaking of the [[Relative hour (Jewish law)|relative hour]], states that there are always 12 hours between the break of [[dawn]] and sunset, so these measurements are averages. For example, in the summer, a day time hour is much longer than a night time hour.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12176">The "'''Christian Communities'''" were [[Christianity|Christian]] [[intentional community|intentional communities]] with an [[Anabaptist]] worldview, founded and led by [[Elmo Stoll]] (1944{{dash}}1998), a former Old Order Amish bishop. They were founded in 1990 and disbanded some two years after Stoll's early death in 1998. At the time of Stoll's death there were five "Christian Communities", four in the U.S. and one in [[Canada]]. [[G.C. Waldrep]] calls them "perhaps the most important "[[para-Amish]]" group".&lt;ref&gt;G.C. Waldrep: "The New Order Amish And Para-Amish Groups: Spiritual Renewal Within Tradition." in Mennonite Quarterly Review 3 (2008), page 417.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Elmo Stoll ==

Elmo Stoll of [[Aylmer, Ontario]], born 1945, was ordained as an Amish minister in 1971 and as an Amish bishop in 1984. As such he forced the members of his church to [[plain dress|dress plainer]] and he also enforced other changes in the direction of stricter plainness and less modern technology , e. g. he forbade to use of [[calculator|electronic calculators]]. Moreover, he became an ardent preacher.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irawagler.com/?p=511 ''The Shepherd at Dawn: The Early Years'' at irawagler.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irawagler.com/?p=511 ''The Shepherd at Noon: Empire &amp; Exodus'' at irawagler.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mtsu.edu/borders/archives/14/BS_2003_archive.pdf Richard A. Pride: ''Elmo Stoll and the Christian Community at Cookeville'' in Border States: Journal of the Kentucky Tennessee American Studies Association, Volume 14 : 2003, pages 38-39.] 
&lt;/ref&gt; He also wrote a regular column in the Amish magazine "[[Family Life (Amish magazine)|Family Life]]", until he left the Amish and created the ‚ÄúChristian Communities‚Äù.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Crossan: ''Community: Looking at the Possibilities'', Sugarcreek, OH  2012, page 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

Elmo Stoll helped a young couple, [[Seeker (Anabaptism)|seekers]] of [[French-Canadian]] background, Marc Villeneuve and his wife, to join the Amish community at Aylmer. This young man started to raise questions about several religious practices and was backed by Elmo's sons and more and more by Elmo himself. In December 1989 the ministers of the Aylmer Amish settlement met to discuss five issues, Elmo and his followers had raised: Evangelizing outside the Plain churches, the use of the English language to reach seekers, Christian community of goods (like the Hutterites), the mandatory wearing of hats for men and the question of fellowship with other plain churches. Elmo Stoll was favoring fellowship with the [[Noah Hoover Mennonite]]s and the [[Orthodox Mennonites]]. No decision was made after this meeting. Elmo Stoll then explained his ideas in the Book ''Let Us Reason Together''.

== Separation from the Amish ==

In July 1990 the disunion was that strong that the other bishops of Aylmer consulted with outside bishops and the decision was made to let Elmo start a new community, separated from the Aylmer community. Elmo and his followers were not excommunicated, but it was not allowed that individuals could freely move between the two communities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mtsu.edu/borders/archives/14/BS_2003_archive.pdf Richard A. Pride: ''Elmo Stoll and the Christian Community at Cookeville'' in Border States: Journal of the Kentucky Tennessee American Studies Association, Volume 14 : 2003, pages 39-40.]&lt;/ref&gt; So Elmo Stoll and his followers withdrew from the Amish church in Aylmer in September 1990 to organize a plain, horse-and-buggy, English-speaking community in [[Cookeville, Tennessee]], that was rooted in [[Anabaptism]]. Cookeville was chosen because of its proximity to the like-minded [[Noah Hoover Mennonite]]s in [[Scottsville, Kentucky]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://uwaterloo.ca/mennonite-archives-ontario/personal-collections/elmo-stoll Elmo Stoll at University of Waterloo, Mennonite Archives of Ontario]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irawagler.com/?p=511 ''The Shepherd at Noon: Empire &amp; Exodus'' at irawagler.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

Elmo Stoll intended to create a church mostly modeled on the Amish, but with community of goods and without the German language and other obstacles in order to help Christian [[Seeker (Anabaptism)|seekers]] from a non-plain background to integrate into a very plain, low technology Christian life without materialism.&lt;ref&gt;G.C. Waldrep :"The New Order Amish And Para-Amish Groups: Spiritual Renewal Within Tradition." in Mennonite Quarterly Review 3 (2008), page 417.&lt;/ref&gt;

== ‚ÄúChristian Communities‚Äù ==

Two hundred acres with a dilapidated barn on it were bought in Cookeville, Tennessee and on October 5, 1990, Elmo Stoll and his followers arrived there. In the beginning they lived in two small houses rented on a nearby farm. Building houses without modern appliances was hard and with the help of several men from nearby [[Noah Hoover Mennonite]]s from [[Scottsville, Kentucky|Scottsville]], they dug the basements and foundations by hand. There was no indoor plumbing, that is no running water, no showers or bath tubes and  no toilets in the houses, instead there were outhouse.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irawagler.com/?p=595 ''The Shepherd at Dusk: His Vision &amp; Legacy'' at irawagler.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

From the beginning there was disunion among the members, because some members wanted a communal living, with all meals shared, and only private rooms, while other members wanted private houses and meals only with a communal purse. In the end it was decided that each family would have its own household. Within months more and more people arrived and in spring each family started to plant a [[market garden]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irawagler.com/?p=595 ''The Shepherd at Dusk: His Vision &amp; Legacy'' at irawagler.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though officially there was no [[Ordnung]] (set of rules), the people of the Christian Community at Cookeville dressed very plain, but in a way distinctive from the Amish. The men wore collarless shirts, suspenders and untrimmed beards with mustaches. Hats for men were allowed, but strongly discouraged. The women wore some kind of kerchiefs, instead of bonnets and plain dresses with capes. Cars were forbidden, but bicycles were allowed. Power tools and other modern equipment, for example gasoline engines, were also not allowed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irawagler.com/?p=595 ''The Shepherd at Dusk: His Vision &amp; Legacy'' at irawagler.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

Stoll's charisma and the spiritual and theological openness of the group did not only attract Amish and people with an [[Old Order Mennonite]] or an [[Old German Baptist Brethren|Old German Baptist]] background, but also dozens of families and individuals from [[Plain people|non-plain]] churches. The community at Cookeville had to struggle to accommodate all the visitors, who wanted to move in.&lt;ref&gt;G.C. Waldrep :"The New Order Amish And Para-Amish Groups: Spiritual Renewal Within Tradition." in Mennonite Quarterly Review 3 (2008), page 418.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irawagler.com/?p=595 ''The Shepherd at Dusk: His Vision &amp; Legacy'' at irawagler.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

The emphasis on voluntary poverty and the community of goods in the beginning made it impossible to save money to buy more land in other locations. Therefore the community of goods was soon abandoned and the ‚ÄúChristian Community"  could spread to other places. When Elmo Stoll died in 1998, there were five ‚ÄúChristian Communities‚Äù: 
* Cookeville, Tennessee (founded in 1990), 
* [[Decatur, Tennessee]] (founded in 1993), 
* [[Woodstock, New Brunswick]] in Canada (founded in 1994), 
* [[Holland, Kentucky]] (founded in 1996) and 
* [[Smyrna, Maine]] (founded in 1996).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mtsu.edu/borders/archives/14/BS_2003_archive.pdf Richard A. Pride: ''Elmo Stoll and the Christian Community at Cookeville'' in Border States: Journal of the Kentucky Tennessee American Studies Association, Volume 14 : 2003, page 48]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irawagler.com/?p=595 ''The Shepherd at Dusk: His Vision &amp; Legacy'' at irawagler.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

After the early death of Elmo Stoll by heart failure two of the "Christian Communities", Cookeville and Woodstock, disbanded while the one in Holland, KY and part of the one in Decatur, who moved to [[Delano, Tennessee]], joined the [[Noah Hoover Mennonite]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Philip Crossan: ''Community: Looking at the Possibilities'', Sugarcreek, OH  2012, page 31.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anabaptistchurch.org/community_by_elmo_stoll.htm ''Community'' by Elmo Stoll at anabaptistchurch.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150928001251/http://www.anabaptistchurch.org/community_by_elmo_stoll.htm |date=2015-09-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a very plain horse and buggy Old Order group, that is rather [[Intentional community|intentionalist minded]] than traditional.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Donnermeyer|Donnermeyer, Joseph]], and Cory Anderson: "The Growth of Amish and Plain Anabaptists in Kentucky." in Journal of Amish and Plain Anabaptist Studies 2(2):215, page 232, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The community in Smyrna, after having lost most of its members without Amish background, developed a fellowship with an Amish community in [[Manton, Michigan]], which is affiliated with the Amish [[Michigan Churches]]. The community in Smyrna, that became Amish, was the first Amish community in Maine. Several of Elmo Stoll's sons and others with Amish background returned to the Amish community in Aylmer, Ontario.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mtsu.edu/borders/archives/14/BS_2003_archive.pdf Richard A. Pride: ''Elmo Stoll and the Christian Community at Cookeville'' in Border States: Journal of the Kentucky Tennessee American Studies Association, Volume 14 : 2003, page 46]&lt;/ref&gt;

A community in [[Kentucky]] of some 15 families, the [[Caneyville Christian Community]], founded in 2004 by three men, among them one of Elmo Stoll's sons, still adheres to Elmo Stoll's vision.&lt;ref&gt;Donnermeyer, Joseph, and Cory Anderson: "The Growth of Amish and Plain Anabaptists in Kentucky." in Journal of Amish and Plain Anabaptist Studies 2(2):215, page 231, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Williams, Lovina Eicher: ''Amish Cooks Across America: Recipes and Traditions from Maine to Montana'', Kansas City 2013, page 145.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Publishing ==

Between 1991 and 1998 the "Christian Communities" at Cookeville published a small bimonthly pamphlet, called "The Update", which contained lengthy "community news", columns, letters (both approving and critical) and long articles on faith and practice written by Elmo Stoll and other ministers. Very important for the community were two books written by Elmo Stoll: ''Let Us Reason Together'' (1990) and ''Why We Live Simply'' (1996).&lt;ref&gt;G.C.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15110">In [[Bible prophecy]], several verses relate to the future of the [[Davidic line]]. Christians argue that [[Jesus]] fulfills these prophecies, while skeptics and Jews disagree.

==The prophecies==
===David's line===
After Zedekiah, the last king of Judah was forced out by Nebuchadnezzar in the siege of Jerusalem (Jeremiah 32:4-5), the {{Lord}} says: 'David will never fail to have a man to sit on the throne of the house of Israel...'"(Jeremiah 33:17) [[Jehoiachin]] was placed in a position of authority during Babylonian exile at the end of 2 Kings.&lt;ref&gt;2 Kings 25:27-30&lt;/ref&gt; He was called king under exile in several Babylonian food-rationing lists.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;Harper Collins Bible Dictionary (Revised Edition)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jehoiakim and Jeconiah===
Jeremiah prophesied that [[Jehoiakim]] will have no one to sit on the throne of David (Jeremiah 36:30). His son [[Jehoiachin]] succeeded him as king for three months and ten days before Nebuchadnezzar forced him out, ending the reign of Jehoiakim's descendants (2 Chron. 36:8,9; 2 Kings 24:8).  After Jehoiachin spent 37 years in prison, Nebuchadnezzar's successor [[Evil-merodach]] released the imprisoned king Jehoiachin and elevated him above all other captive kings that were in Babylon(2 Kings 25:27). Jehoiakim is the ancestor of Jesus' earthly father Joseph according to Matt. 1:11 (skipped in  list) (see 1 Chronicles 3:15-16 and 2 Kings 24:8).

In Jeremiah 22:30, God states that neither Jehoiachin (also called Jeconiah) or his offspring will prosper, for none of his offspring will sit on throne of David and rule over Judah.

Jehoiachin's offspring did not sit on the throne of David or rule over Judah.  2 Kings 25:27 records that Jehoiachin was a prisoner for thirty seven years.  For two years, [[Evil-merodach]] king of Babylon gave Jehoiachin a seat of honor higher than those of the other kings who were with him in Babylon and gave him a regular daily allowance all the days of his life. (2 Kings 25:27-30) His family retained leadership of the Babylonian exiles (Ezek. 1:2), and his descendants were at the head of those who returned to Zion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0011_0_10047.html|title=Jehoiachin|publisher=Jewishvirtuallibrary.org|accessdate=2 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-OZKcJplc8wC&amp;pg=PA235|title=The Book of the Prophet Jeremiah, Chapters 26-52|publisher=Books.google.com|accessdate=2 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=198&amp;letter=J&amp;search=jehoiachin|title=JEHOIACHIN - JewishEncyclopedia.com|publisher=Jewishencyclopedia.com|accessdate=2 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is the ancestor of Jesus' earthly father Joseph according to Matt. 1:12.

===Solomon's line===
God states that the house, throne and kingdom of David and his offspring (called "the one who will build a house for my Name" in the verse) will last forever.(2 Sam. 7:12-16, 2 Chronicles 13:5, Psalm 89:20-37) 1 Kings 9:4-7 as well as 1 Ch 28:5 and 2 Ch 7:17 state that Solomon's establishment is conditional on Solomon obeying God's commandments.

[[Solomon]] built the temple in Jerusalem (2 Chron. 6:7-10, 2 Chronicles 2:1) and did not obey God's commandments (1 Kings 11:1-14).

The destruction of the [[Kingdom of Judah]] by Nebuchadnezzar in 586 BCE brought an end to the rule of the royal house of David.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=593&amp;letter=J|title=JUDAH, KINGDOM OF - JewishEncyclopedia.com|publisher=Jewsihencyclopedia.com|accessdate=2 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Debate==
Some scholars state that God has promised an eternal dynasty to David unconditionally.(1 Kings 11:36, 15:4, 2 Kings 8:19) They feel the conditional promise of 1 Kings 9:4-7 seems to undercut this unconditional covenant. Most interpreters have taken the expression "throne of Israel" as a reference to the throne of the [[United Monarchy]]. They see this as a conditionalization of the unconditional dynastic promise to David's house expressed in 1 Kings 11:36, 15:4 and 2 Kings 8:19. They argue the presence of both unconditional and conditional promises to the house of David would create intense theological dissonance in the [[Books of Kings|Book of Kings]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RCgUvQOIvD0C&amp;pg=PA29|title=First and Second Kings|publisher=Books.google.com|accessdate=2 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-J6rtnfjHQoC&amp;pg=PA672|title=The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia|publisher=Books.google.com|accessdate=2 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pWNohGTPy48C&amp;pg=PA125|title=A Short Introduction to the Hebrew Bible|publisher=Books.google.com|accessdate=2 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4Zr8LHuec38C&amp;pg=PA145|title=Major Bible Themes|publisher=Books.google.com|accessdate=2 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christians believe that the promise is of surviving descendants that could fulfill the role of king, which they state Jesus did, rather than a permanent earthly kingship.&lt;ref&gt;Richards, L. O. (1991; Published in electronic form by Logos Research Systems, 1996). The Bible readers companion (electronic ed.) (468). Wheaton: Victor Books.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Henry, M. (1996, c1991).

Joplin, Mo.: College Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The Bible Knowledge Commentary states:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
God did not promise an unbroken monarchy but an unbroken line of descendants from David who would be qualified to sit on that throne when it was reestablished. David‚Äôs line would not fail before the righteous Branch came to claim His throne (cf. Luke 1:31-33). The genealogies of Matthew and Luke show that this promise was fulfilled as Christ was able to trace both His legal line through Joseph and His physical line through Mary back to David (Matt. 1:1-16; Luke 3:23-31).&lt;ref&gt;Walvoord, J. F., Zuck, R. B., &amp; Dallas Theological Seminary. (1983-c1985). The Bible knowledge commentary : An exposition of the scriptures (1:1176). Wheaton, IL: Victor Books.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Christians believe that Matthew and Luke present two different genealogies. They point out that some names are common to both, but many names are different. Matthew begins at the patriarch Abraham and works his way to Jesus the Christ, while Luke begins at Jesus and works his way back to Adam. They argue Matthew presents the genealogy of Joseph, and Luke presents the genealogy of Mary. In Luke's days they argue, it was proper and correct to cite Joseph's name in Mary's genealogy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lookinguntojesus.net/ata20010401.htm|title=Looking Unto Jesus - Who is Joseph's father? - Limestone Church of Christ, Kingston, Ontario, Standing for New Testament Christianity, Bible, faith, Bible study, word of God, Christianity, Christian, church, truth, atheism, answers, gospel, salvation, heaven, hope, baptism, Bible studies, Bible church|publisher=Lookinguntojesus.net|accessdate=2 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christians argue that Joseph adopted Jesus as his legal son and thus Jesus became both David's direct descendant through David's son [[Nathan (son of David)|Nathan]] (Luke's genealogy) and David's legal royal heir through [[Solomon]] (Matthew's genealogy).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abideinchrist.com/messages/onlylegitimatemessiah.html|title=Jesus Christ: The Only Possible Legitimate Messiah|publisher=Abideinchrist.com|accessdate=2 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics claim this is just a required reinterpretation of the prophecy.&lt;ref name="books.google.com" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8G4bJD87LecC&amp;pg=PR22#PPR21,M1|title=The Messiah|publisher=Books.google.com|accessdate=2 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8G4bJD87LecC&amp;pg=PR22|title=The Messiah|publisher=Books.google.com|accessdate=2 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In rabbinic thinking, the reestablishment of the Davidic kingdom was tied to the [[Messiah]], who was to be a descendant of King David. He would redeem the Jews from exile and reestablish their independence in the land of Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/581644/Talmud/34886/Messianic-kingdom|title=Talmud and Midrash|work=Encyclop√¶dia Britannica|accessdate=2 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jews argue this is not fulfilled in Jesus. Jews&lt;ref name=messiahtruth&gt;[http://www.messiahtruth.com/jesusgen.html]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090402025726/http://www.messiahtruth.com/jesusgen.html |date=April 2, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and skeptics&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZokGkvix4REC&amp;pg=PA94|title=Truth|publisher=Books.google.com|accessdate=2 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; argue that Matthew and Luke made numerous mistakes in their genealogies of Jesus that eliminate him from [[Messiah|Messianic]] consideration. Matthew and Luke traced Jesus' lineage through Joseph back to King David. (However, the gospels also assert that Jesus was conceived through the power of the [[Holy Spirit]], not Joseph. There is, nonetheless, an implied indication in the Gospels that Joseph adopted Jesus.).

If he was adopted, they argue, based on a distinction between full-blooded Jews and half-blooded Jews in the scripture,(Numbers 1:18-44, 34:14; Leviticus 24:10) under Jewish law certain family and tribal affiliations must be through the birth father and cannot be claimed by adoption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tx5qrKz6dRMC&amp;pg=PA62#PPA63,M1|title=Twenty-six Reasons why Jews Don't Believe in Jesus|publisher=Books.google.com|accessdate=2 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Jews argue that the Messiah must descend through David's son Solomon (2 Sam 7:12-16, Psalm 89:28-38, 1 Chronicles 17:11-14, 22:9-10, 28:6-7). Luke's genealogy of Joseph is traced back to David through his son Nathan (who was not a king). They argue this eliminates Jesus' genealogy in Luke. In addition, to presume that Mary was of Davidic descent in Luke  presents the problem that Mary could not pass on what she did not possess: (1) Maternal connection does not enter into consideration for succession to the throne of David which is passed on only through a continuous male line: "''There shall not be cut off from David a man to sit upon the throne of the house of Israel''" (Jeremiah 33:17); (2) Biblically, the right of lineal privilege, that is, kingship and priesthood, are exclusively passed on through the male line.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110613191637/http://www.jewsforjudaism.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=59&amp;Itemid=360] &lt;/ref&gt; Matthew's genealogy of Joseph is traced back to David through his son Solomon, but ultimately down to the cursed [[Jeconiah]], son of [[Jehoiakim]] who was also cursed in Jeremiah 36:30. Jeconiah was told that none of his descendants could ever sit on the throne of David.(Jeremiah 22:30) Jews thus argue the Messiah must descend from King Solomon but not from King Jeconiah. Jews point out that Jeconiah's grandson, Zerubbabel, held power granted by God, though he was never king.&lt;ref name=messiahtruth/&gt; Jews argue that on top of Nathan not being king, Luke 3:27 includes [[Shealtiel]] and [[Zerubbabel]], both of whom are descendants of the cursed Jeconiah in Matthew 1:12. This is part of the reason Jews give for rejecting Jesus as the promised future descendant of David who would once again rule over Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/biography/David.html|title=King David|publisher=Jewishvirtuallibrary.org|accessdate=2 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christians respond that a virgin birth avoids what they claim is a physical but not legal curse of Jehoiakim&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lifeofchrist.com/life/genealogy/print.html|title=Life of Christ: Genealogy of Jesus Christ|publisher=Lifeofchrist.org|accessdate=2 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; (while a reversal of the curse may have even occurred;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewsforjesus.org/answers/prophecy/jeconiah|title=The Problem of the Curse on Jeconiah in Relation to the Genealogy of Jesus|publisher=Jewsforjesus.org|accessdate=2 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and even if no reversal occurred, an adoption by a descendant of King Solomon gives Jesus legal inheritance rights to that kingdom‚Äîthus, again, protecting him from the physical curse.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apocalipsis.org/difficulties/genealogies.htm]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725052524/http://www.apocalipsis.org/difficulties/genealogies.htm |date=July 25, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="christian-thinktank.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christian-thinktank.com/fabprof4.html|title=Response to the Fabulous Prophecies of the Messiah|publisher=Christian-thinktank.com|accessdate=2 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Christians and the [[New Testament]] itself also argue that the names Zerubbabel and Shealtiel in the two lineages have different parents and children and therefore are just common names that do not refer to the same people.&lt;ref name="christian-thinktank.com" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%203:23-34;%20Matthew%201:1-17&amp;version=NKJV|title=Luke 3:23-34|work=Bible Gateway|accessdate=2 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christians also argue that the promise that the Messiah would descend from Solomon is conditional.(1 Kings 9:4-7; 1 Chron. 28:7)&lt;ref name="christian-thinktank.com" /&gt; Christians point to Solomon violating this condition.(1 Kings 11:1-14)  Furthermore, Christians argue that although Jewish nationality and tribal identity were normally determined by the father, with the Messiah it would be different.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jewsforjesus.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jewsforjesus.org/publications/issues/5_6/genealogy|title=The Genealogy of the Messiah - Jews for Jesus|author=|publisher=Jewsforjesus.org|accessdate=2 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This exception to the rule became apparent, it is argued, when Isaiah 7:14 prophesied that the Messiah would be born of a virgin: "Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign: Behold, a virgin will be with child and bear a son, and she will call his name Immanuel."&lt;ref name="jewsforjesus.org" /&gt;

Jews respond that the [[Miraculous births|virgin birth]] is substantiated by a misused excerpt of Isaiah(see [[Isaiah 7:14]]). Accordingly, Jewish scholars never considered Isaiah 7:14 as a messianic prophecy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.messiahtruth.com/is714a.html]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090528072052/http://www.messiahtruth.com/is714a.html |date=May 28, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dexter Morgan''' is a [[fictional character]] and the [[antihero]] of the Dexter book series, written by [[Jeff Lindsay (writer)|Jeff Lindsay]], as well as the [[Dexter (TV series)|television series of the same name]], where he is portrayed by American actor [[Michael C. Hall]], and by [[Devon Graye]], [[Dominic Janes]], and [[Maxwell Huckabee]] as a youth. 

In both the novels and the TV series, Dexter is a [[forensic science|forensic]] [[blood spatter analysis|blood spatter analyst]] who works for the fictitious Miami-Metro Police Department. In his spare time, he is a [[vigilante]] [[serial killer]] who targets other murderers who have evaded the justice system. He follows a code of ethics taught to him in childhood by his adoptive father, [[Harry Morgan (Dexter)|Harry]], which he refers to as "The Code" or "The Code of Harry" and hinges on two principles: Dexter can only kill people after finding conclusive evidence that they are guilty of murder, and he must not get caught.

== Characterization ==

=== Psychological profile ===
Since childhood, Dexter Morgan has felt homicidal urges directed by an inner voice he calls "the Dark Passenger"; when that voice cannot be ignored, he "lets the Dark Passenger do the driving". He abides by a moral code taught to him by his adoptive father, [[Harry Morgan (Dexter)|Harry]], in which he only allows himself to kill people who are themselves murderers.

Dexter considers himself emotionally divorced from the rest of humanity; in his narration, he refers to "humans" as if he is not one himself. He makes frequent references to an internal feeling of emptiness and says he kills to feel alive. He claims to have no feelings or [[conscience]], and that all of his emotional responses are part of a well-rehearsed act to conceal his true nature. He has no interest in romance or sex; he considers his relationship with his girlfriend (and eventual wife) [[Rita Bennett]] to be part of his "disguise".

Dexter likes children, finding them much more interesting than adults; accordingly, he treats victims who prey on children with particular wrath. His connection to Rita's children, Astor, and Cody, sometimes supersedes his relationship with Rita herself. For example, in the novels, Dexter continues his relationship with Rita because he realizes that Rita's children are exhibiting the same [[antisocial personality disorder|sociopathic]] tendencies he did at their age, and he tries to control their violent urges by providing them with "guidance" similar to that which Harry provided him. In the show, Dexter deviates from his code of only killing murderers to dispose of a [[pedophile]] who is [[stalking]] Astor.

Animals do not like Dexter, which can cause noise problems when he stalks a victim who has pets. The novels reveal that he once owned a dog that barked and growled at him until he was forced to get rid of it and a turtle that hid from him in its shell until it died of starvation.

Dexter occasionally behaves in a way that suggests that he does feel some rudimentary human connection. He acknowledges loyalty to family, particularly to his late adoptive father, saying: "If I were capable of love, how I would have loved Harry." Since Harry's death, Dexter's only family is his sister [[Debra Morgan|Debra]], Harry and Doris' biological daughter. Dexter admits that he cannot hurt Debra or allow anyone else to harm her because he is "fond of her". In the [[Dexter (episode)|first episode]] of [[Dexter (season 1)|season one]], he says: "I don't have feelings about anything, but if I could have feelings at all, I'd have them for Deb".

In the first season, Dexter's relationship with Rita sets in motion his slow but steady introduction to human feelings, progressing further each season. During the episode "[[Shrink Wrap (Dexter episode)|Shrink Wrap]]", when his current target is a psychologist, Dexter infiltrates the doctor's office by posing as a patient, and the doctor astutely speculates that part of Dexter's problem in admitting to his feelings is his need for control. In the second season finale, "[[The British Invasion (Dexter)|The British Invasion]]", Dexter finally admits that he needs the people in his life.&lt;ref name="The British Invasion"&gt;{{cite episode
| title = The British Invasion | episodelink = | series = Dexter| serieslink = Dexter (TV series) | network = [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] | airdate = October 14, 2007| season = 2 | number = 9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Dexter (season 3)|season three]], when he is threatened by a target, Dexter fights to live because he wants to see his unborn child. In [[Dexter (season 4)|season four]], before killing a police officer who has murdered her own husband and daughter, Dexter is overwhelmed with the realization that he does not want to lose his new family. He is also horrified when he finds out that one of his potential victims is an abusive husband and father; Dexter vehemently insists he is nothing like that and would never hurt his family. In [[Dexter (season 5)|season five]], after Rita is murdered, Dexter realizes that he genuinely loved her and is devastated by losing her.&lt;ref name="My Bad"&gt;{{cite episode| title = My Bad | episodelink = | series = Dexter| serieslink = Dexter (TV series) | network = [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] | airdate = September 26, 2010| season = 5 | number = 1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Modus operandi'' ===
In both the books and the show, Dexter selects his victims according to his adoptive father's code and kills them only after he has discovered enough evidence to prove their guilt.  For each victim, he ritually prepares a kill site that has some symbolic relevance to the killer (e.g., killing a boxer in a [[boxing ring]] or a gambler in a casino's storage shed). He completely drapes the site in clear plastic [[tarpaulin]] to catch all spilled blood, and often adorns it with evidence or photos of his victim's crimes.

The actual capture of his victims differs between the books and the show. On the show, it usually entails approaching the victims from behind and injecting an [[anesthetic]] (specified to be an animal [[tranquilizer]] called [[Etorphine|etorphine hydrochloride]], or M99), which renders his victims temporarily unconscious.&lt;ref name="Return to Sender"&gt;{{cite episode| title = Return to Sender | episodelink = Return to Sender (Dexter) | series = Dexter| serieslink = Dexter (TV series) | network = [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] | airdate = May 11, 2006| season = 1 | number = 06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The injection is a tradition established with his first victim, the hospital nurse.&lt;ref name="Popping Cherry"&gt;{{cite episode| title = Popping Cherry | episodelink = | series = Dexter| serieslink = Dexter (TV series) | network = [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] | airdate = October 15, 2006| season = 1 | number = 03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He uses the alias [[Patrick Bateman]] (the serial killer protagonist of [[Bret Easton Ellis]]' ''[[American Psycho]]'') to procure these tranquilizers.&lt;ref name="Return to Sender"/&gt; Other times, Dexter incapacitates his target by using either his hands or a [[garrote]] to cut off blood flow to the brain. In the books (and twice in the television program), he hides in the back seat of his victim's vehicle, then wraps a noose of fishing line around his victim's throat when he sits down. Dexter then uses the threat of [[asphyxiation]] to force his victim to drive them to his prepared kill site.

Once they have arrived, he either strangles them into unconsciousness or uses the noose to drag them to the kill site proper. In such cases, he anesthetizes them once he has informed them of his judgment. When victims awaken, they are naked and secured to a table with plastic wrap, and for stronger victims, duct tape. If he has not already done so, he confronts them with narrative evidence of their crimes. In the novels, the method usually involves an extended "exploration" with various sharp knives; on the show, Dexter's favored method usually involves an immediately fatal wound to the chest, neck, or gut with a variety of weapons. He occasionally varies his methods to fit particular victims; he kills his brother (and fellow serial killer) Brian by cutting his throat with a dinner knife (with the manner of the death and Dexter's own hesitation at inflicting the wound causing pathologists to conclude that Brian killed himself);&lt;ref name="Born Free"&gt;{{cite episode| title = Born Free | episodelink = Born Free (Dexter) | series = Dexter| serieslink = Dexter (TV series) | network = [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] | airdate = December 17, 2006| season = 1 | number = 12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; he stabs gang lord [[List of Dexter characters#Little Chino|Little Chino]] in the chest with a [[machete]].&lt;ref name="Waiting to Exhale"&gt;{{cite episode| title = Waiting to Exhale | episodelink = | series = Dexter| serieslink = Dexter (TV series) | network = [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] | airdate = October 7, 2007| season = 2 | number = 02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He kills Santos Jimenez‚Äîthe man who murdered his mother‚Äîin the same manner in which his mother was killed, by dismembering him with a chainsaw.  On other occasions, he uses hammers, drills, and other power tools.

Just before the murder, Dexter collects trophies from his victims so he can relive the experience. Dexter's trophy signature is to slice the victim's right cheek with a surgical scalpel to collect a small blood sample, which he preserves on a [[microscope slide]]. In the TV show, Dexter keeps blood slides from all his victims neatly organized in a wooden filing box, which he hides inside his air conditioner. In the novels, he keeps them in a [[rosewood]] box on his bookcase.

Ultimately, he dismembers the bodies into several pieces, stows them and the plastic sheeting in black, heavy duty, [[biodegradable]] garbage bags, then adds rocks from the dock where he keeps his boat as anchor weight, and seals the bags with duct tape. He then takes the wrapped bags out on his boat and disposes of them by dumping them overboard into the ocean at a defined location; in the TV series, his dumping ground is a small [[oceanic trench]] just offshore. In one episode, the dump site and remains are inadvertently discovered by scuba divers, so he changes tactics, cutting the bodies into smaller pieces and dumping them further offshore, where they will be dispersed by the [[Gulf Stream]].  The books give less detail about disposal, with Dexter usually improvising depending on the victim. He has dumped some victims into the ocean due to the victim's owning a boat and doing the same with their own victims, but uses anchors to weight the bags. He disposes of another body in a vat of [[hydrochloric acid]].

=== General biography ===
Dexter was born on February 15, 1971 (though according to Dr. Evelyn Vogel‚Äôs journal in S8 E4, Dexter‚Äôs date of birth was notated as ‚Äú2/1/71‚Äù).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title=This Is the Way the World Ends |episodelink=This Is the Way the World Ends |series= Dexter|serieslink=Dexter (TV series) |credits=[[James Manos, Jr.]] |network=[[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] |station= |airdate=December 18, 2011 |season=6 |episode=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the story's outset, Dexter knows very little about his life prior to being adopted by Harry Morgan (a Miami detective) and his wife Doris. Harry only tells Dexter that his parents were killed in a car accident, and Harry brought him home from the crime scene. When Dexter is seven, Harry discovers that the boy has been killing neighborhood pets and realizes that Dexter is a [[antisocial personality disorder|sociopath]] with a deep need to kill. Consequently, Harry decides to channel the boy's homicidal urges in a "positive" direction by teaching him to be a careful, meticulous killer of people who "deserve it"‚Äîmurderers who have escaped justice. Doris died when Dexter was 16, and Harry died when Dexter was 20.&lt;ref name="Our"&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Our Father|episodelink=Dexter (season 3)#ep1|series=Dexter|serieslink=Dexter (TV series)|network=Showtime|airdate=September 28, 2008|season=3|number=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the second season, Dexter's nemesis, [[James Doakes|Sergeant James Doakes]], discovers that Dexter forsook a career in medicine to pursue blood spatter analysis, despite being top of his class at medical school.  He also notes that Dexter studied advanced [[jujutsu]] in college.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Resistance is Futile|episodelink=Dexter (season 2)#ep9|series=Dexter|serieslink=Dexter (TV series)|network=Showtime|airdate=November 25, 2007|season=2|number=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both the television show and the first novel gradually reveal Dexter's complete back story. Dexter was born out of wedlock in 1971 to a young woman named Laura (Laura Moser on the show). In the novels, Laura was involved in the [[Illegal drug trade|drug trade]].&lt;ref name="Born Free"/&gt; On the show, Laura was a [[police informant]] for Harry Morgan and his secret mistress. Dexter's father (named Joseph Driscoll on the show) was in the [[US Army]] and served in the [[Vietnam War]], but later became a drug-addicted criminal. Dexter also had an older brother, named Brian.&lt;ref name="Born Free"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Truth Be Told"&gt;{{cite episode | title = Truth Be Told | episodelink = | series = Dexter | serieslink = Dexter (TV series) | network = [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] | airdate = October 12, 2006| season = 1 | number = 11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 1, 1973, Dexter and Brian witnessed their mother's brutal murder at the hands of three drug dealers.  For two days, the brothers were left in a crate, surrounded by dismembered body parts and sitting in a pool of blood.{{cref|a}}  Harry adopted the three-year-old Dexter, while Brian was left to the [[child welfare]] [[Child and family services|system]].{{cref|b}}

Dexter only remembers his mother's murder later in life, when he is called to an extremely bloody crime scene left by his brother‚Äîwho has also grown up to be a serial killer.  In the novel, Brian escapes Miami, but returns in ''[[Dexter Is Delicious]]''. On the show, however, Dexter catches and (reluctantly) kills Brian, aware that Brian would never stop trying to kill Debra or other innocent people.&lt;ref name="Born Free"/&gt;

== Character development in the book series ==

=== ''Darkly Dreaming Dexter'' ===
Doris Morgan, Dexter's adoptive mother, dies of [[cancer]] when he is 16. When Dexter reaches puberty, he realizes that he is uninterested in sex and needs instruction by his father on how to behave with women. Around this time, Harry discovers that Dexter has been killing neighborhood pets and realizes that the boy has an innate need to kill. Harry decides to channel Dexter's urges in a "positive" direction by teaching him to kill people who "deserve it", and to get rid of any evidence so he does not get caught.

When Dexter is 18, Harry is diagnosed with cancer and hospitalized. There, Harry gives Dexter his "permission" to kill his first human victim, a nurse who is murdering her patients with overdoses of morphine.

Throughout the novel, Dexter is involved in the investigation of the "Tamiami Butcher", a serial killer who dismembers his victims and puts the body parts in refrigerated trucks. The killer begins leaving taunting clues for Dexter to draw him in personally. The killer kidnaps Deborah and meets with Dexter in a storage container, and reveals their true connection: he is Brian, Dexter's biological brother. Brian tells Dexter that as children, they witnessed their mother's brutal murder at the hands of drug dealers, and were locked in a crate for two days, surrounded by dead bodies. Dexter persuades Brian to spare Deborah, and instead the two of them kill Lieutenant [[Maria LaGuerta|Migdia LaGuerta]] (this does not occur in the TV series, in which LaGuerta &amp;mdash; whose first name is changed to "Maria" &amp;mdash; is a recurring character until her death at the end of the seventh season).

At the end of the novel, Deborah learns of Dexter's secret life after he saves her from Brian. She appears to accept it, but in subsequent books feels torn between her duties as a police officer and her loyalty to Dexter, whom she loves as her real brother.

=== ''Dearly Devoted Dexter'' ===
Dexter's nemesis, [[James Doakes|Sergeant Doakes]], suspects Dexter of being involved in LaGuerta's murder, and starts following him around.  Doakes and Dexter are soon forced to work together to stop "Dr. Danco", a [[psychopath]]ic surgeon who removes his victims' limbs and sensory organs, leaving them in a state of living death.

Doakes' pursuit forces Dexter to spend more time with Rita and her children. While attempting to bond with Astor and Cody, he realizes that they both have "Dark Passengers" of their own, and he resolves to provide them with the same "guidance" that Harry had given him. After finding [[FBI]] agent Kyle Chutsky's ring in Dexter's pocket, Rita believes Dexter is about to propose to her, and happily accepts before Dexter can explain.

At the climax of the book, Danco kidnaps Dexter and Doakes, mutilating the latter by removing his hands, feet, and tongue. Just as Danco is about to turn his attentions to Dexter, however, Deborah bursts in and kills him, saving Dexter's life.

=== ''Dexter in the Dark'' ===
In ''[[Dexter in the Dark]],'' the third novel of the series, third-person narrative reveals through an entity referred to as "IT" that the Dark Passenger is an independent agent inhabiting Dexter, rather than a [[abnormal psychology|deviant psychological construction]]. Later, Dexter realizes the Dark Passenger is related to [[Moloch]], a [[Middle East]]ern deity worshiped in [[Bible|Biblical]] times. The Dark Passenger is one of Moloch's many offspring; Moloch had many children (formed through [[human sacrifice]]), and learned to share its knowledge with them. Eventually, there were too many, and Moloch killed the majority; however, some of them escaped into the world. In the novel, Dexter learns of the Dark Passenger's true nature when it briefly "leaves" him, frightening him into researching possible reasons for its existence.

By now, Dexter has embraced his role as stepfather to both children, but is annoyed when thoughts of them ‚Äì wondering if Cody had brushed his teeth before bed and if Astor had set out her Easter dress for picture day at her school ‚Äì distract him from hunting an intended victim. By the end of the book, he has begun training Astor and Cody to be careful, efficient killers, with great success: when the novel's antagonist, a Moloch-worshipping cult leader, kidnaps the three of them, Cody saves Dexter's life by killing one of his henchmen.

The novel ends with the Dark Passenger returning to Dexter on his wedding day.

=== ''Dexter by Design'' ===
''[[Dexter by Design]]'' opens in Paris, with Dexter and Rita on their honeymoon.  There, while visiting an art gallery, Dexter and Rita see an ''[[avant-garde]]'' performance piece called "Jennifer's Leg" in which the artist amputates her own limb.  When they return to Miami, Dexter crosses paths with a suspicious homicide detective and a serial killer who preys on tourists. In the novel's closing paragraphs, Dexter learns that Rita is pregnant with his child.

===''Dexter is Delicious''===
In ''[[Dexter is Delicious]]'', Dexter grapples with raising his infant daughter, Lily-Anne, and wonders if she can help restore his humanity. Brian reappears in Dexter's life, situating himself with Dexter's family. The main event for the Miami Police Department is related to the appearance of cooked, partially eaten bodies and the disappearance of a teenaged girl, Samantha. Dexter has sex with Samantha while under the influence of [[Ecstasy (drug)|ecstasy]], and tries to prevent Rita from finding out while helping Deborah solve the murders.

The novel reintroduces Dexter's brother, Brian, who shows up unexpectedly at Dexter's doorstep and inserts himself into his brother's new family. Dexter is reluctant at first to let Brian back into his life, but changes his mind when he sees him bond with Astor and Cody over their shared bloodlust.

===''Double Dexter''===
In ''[[Double Dexter]]'', Dexter is seen by an anonymous Shadow while killing a victim in a secluded house. He continues on with his life until he starts receiving threatening emails from the person who claims to have seen him over a pile of dead body parts. Instead of turning him in, the Shadow, as he is referred to, takes it upon himself to take Dexter down. While Dexter tries to find and dispose of this Shadow, he quickly finds out that this person is much more capable than he initially suspected. Dexter is eventually framed for a murder, at least circumstantially, by his still anonymous Shadow.

While on suspension from the police force for being a 'person of interest' in a murder investigation, Dexter finally finds out who his Shadow is: Doug Crowley. When he goes to dispatch Crowley, he finds he is once again being tailed by Doakes. Realizing that no way exists to take down Crowley with Doakes on his tail, he enlists the help of his brother, Brian, and finally thinks that his problems have been taken care of.

While Brian is dispatching Doug Crowley, Dexter goes down to Key West with his family. Despite learning from his brother that a Doug Crowley had been taken care of, he finds the body of Detective Hood, the lead detective investigating him for murder, in his hotel suite, with the only explanation being that Brian killed the wrong Doug Crowley.

While Dexter is preoccupied with the Key West police, Crowley finally attacks Dexter by abducting his step children, Cody and Astor. Dexter hunts down Crowley to a small island off the coast of Key West. He finally gets the drop on him, and Crowley escapes with Astor on a speedboat. Dexter manages to sneak aboard and overpower Crowley, with some assistance from Astor. They shove Crowley overboard, where he is eaten by a hammerhead shark.

With Crowley dispatched, Dexter can finally focus on clearing his name in the murder investigation. He plants evidence in Hood's apartment, thoroughly discrediting him, while Doakes is now under review for excessive force and intimidating a witness. These developments leave Dexter in the clear.

===''Dexter's Final Cut''===
In ''[[Dexter's Final Cut]]'', a famous celebrity becomes obsessed with Dexter Morgan after researching him for his new role. When the Big Ticket Network comes to Miami, Deborah and Dexter are assigned as "technical advisors" to the stars of the show. Deborah is shadowed by female lead Jackie Forrest and Dexter is left with over-the-hill star Robert Chase. Sensing a strangeness in him, Dexter keeps Robert at arm's length. When a series of murders leads Miami Metro's Detective Anderson through a loop, Dexter is assigned to guard Jackie.

Deborah and Dexter quickly realize that the string of bodies all bear a striking resemblance to Jackie. Dexter is assigned to protect her in her hotel room. At first, things seem perfectly routine; Dexter accompanies Jackie to the station each morning and returns with her to the hotel at night, but when the killer's identity is revealed to him, Dexter's "Dark Passenger" leads him out into the streets in pursuit.

While working a crime scene where police have found another body matching the pattern of Jackie's obsessed fan, Dexter notices a man fitting the description in a kayak out in the bay watching the scene. Stealing away to his boat, Dexter slips alongside the man and kills him. After a hard day's work, they return to the hotel only to be disturbed in the night by sirens; Jackie's assistant Kathy has been murdered in the room below. The murder seems to fit the pattern, but Dexter notices several errors. That night, Dexter and Jackie fall into bed together and start a brief but intense affair. Dexter thinks he has fallen in love with Jackie, and considers leaving Rita.

Dexter is called onto the set to appear as a minor character in the series following a conversation with Jackie and Robert. Suddenly, Dexter gets a panicked phone call from Rita: Astor has disappeared. Fearing the worst, Dexter goes in search of Robert, who had shown a suspicious interest in Astor. He questions the show's director, who confirms that Robert is a [[pedophile]]. Moments later, he finds Jackie's dead body in her trailer. Dexter then pieces it together: Robert killed Kathy after she caught him in a compromising position with Astor, and then killed Jackie when she found out what he had done. Dexter follows a hunch and heads to Rita and his new house. Robert catches him sneaking in and knocks him unconscious.

Waking some time later, Dexter finds Astor and Robert together in the house. Robert has lured Astor with promises of stardom, and she appears ready to help him to kill Dexter. Thinking quickly, Dexter tells Astor that Robert will be arrested and sent to prison, and is thus useless to her. When Robert tries to take Astor as a hostage, she stabs him to death. Dexter realizes that circumstantial evidence implicates him as the murderer of Robert and Jackie, and that the only person who can exonerate him is Rita. When Dexter searches the house, however, he finds that Rita is dead, murdered by Robert. Dexter sees that his luck has finally run out, and waits for the police to arrive.

===''Dexter is Dead''===
In the final book of the series' ''[[Dexter is Dead]]''; Dexter is in jail after being charged with Robert's crimes - thanks to the corrupt Detective Anderson, who has falsified evidence and reports to make it seem that Dexter is guilty. Only Masuoka tries to clear Dexter's good name, but he gets swatted down by everyone from the beat cops to the state attorney. Deborah, meanwhile, disowns Dexter for cheating on Rita and putting Astor in danger, and decides to take custody of his children.

Dexter's brother Brian bails him out of prison and gets him the best lawyer in town, but the lawyer happens to be in the pocket of a very powerful Mexican drug cartel led by a man named Raul, who is after Brian. The cartel tries to kill Dexter several times to get to Brian. Eventually, Dexter and Brian find out their lawyer sold them out to the cartel, so they kill him and all the cartel's members, save for one, whom they torture to find out where Raul is holding Cody and Astor. 

Brian, Deborah, and Dexter team up, storm Raul's yacht, and take the kids back. Deborah and the kids get away, but Brian is killed by a bomb and Raul shoots Dexter in the shoulder. Dexter kills Raul and sets a bomb so no evidence is left, then jumps off the boat into the water and sinks into the ocean. The book leaves it open to interpretation whether he survives.

== Dexter in the television show ==

=== Season one ===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:DexterBornFree.jpg|thumb|Dexter with his biological brother, Brian.]] --&gt;
By the start of season one, Dexter is a [[Bloodstain Pattern Analysis|blood spatter analyst]] for the Miami Metro Police Department; in his "secret life", he is a serial killer who preys on people who are themselves murderers. In his private life, Dexter maintains superficial relationships &amp;ndash; with his sister [[Debra Morgan|Debra]] ([[Jennifer Carpenter]]), his girlfriend [[Rita Bennett|Rita]] ([[Julie Benz]]), and Rita's children, [[Astor Bennett|Astor]] ([[Christina Robinson (actress)|Christina Robinson]]) and [[List of Dexter characters#Cody Bennett|Cody]] (Daniel Goldman in season one, Preston Bailey in subsequent seasons) to appear normal. Dexter has internal conversations with his late foster father, [[Harry Morgan (Dexter)|Harry Morgan]] ([[James Remar]]), who gives him advice about killing and navigating his personal life.

Rita's previous, abusive marriage leaves her afraid to have sex, which suits the [[asexuality|asexual]] Dexter perfectly.  When she overcomes her demons and becomes more amorous, however, Dexter considers ending the relationship, fearing that she will see him as he really is if they become a real couple.&lt;ref name="Shrink"&gt;{{cite episode| title = Shrink Wrap | episodelink = | series = Dexter| serieslink = Dexter (TV series) | network = [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] | airdate = November 19, 2006| season = 1 | number = 8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, during a therapy session with one of his intended victims, psychologist Emmett Meridian ([[Tony Goldwyn]]), Dexter is put into a state of deep relaxation, wherein he sees a frightening image of a small boy sitting in a pool of blood. In a heightened emotional state, he runs to Rita's house for comfort, and they have sex.&lt;ref name="Shrink"/&gt;

Meanwhile, a serial killer of prostitutes appears in Miami, and Dexter notices that the killer is leaving hidden clues at the scene that have personal significance to Dexter. One day, Dexter receives official notification that a man named Joseph Driscoll is his biological father, and that, since Dexter is the only next of kin, he must come settle the estate and claim the body.  Debra's new boyfriend, Rudy Cooper ([[Christian Camargo]]), insists that they accompany Dexter and Rita to clean out the house.  Dexter doubts that Driscoll is his father, but while cleaning, discovers a thank-you card that he sent his blood donor as a child, as Dexter has a rare [[blood type]] ([[AB-]]).&lt;ref name="Father Knows Best"&gt;{{cite episode

Dexter's rivalry with Rita's recently paroled ex-husband Paul ([[Mark Pellegrino]]) turns violent; Paul tries to fight Dexter, who knocks him unconscious. To cover his tracks, Dexter injects Paul with [[heroin]] and leaves him to be found.  Paul fails a drug test (thus breaking his probation) and returns to jail.

Dexter is called to analyze a hotel room flooded with the blood of multiple persons. The sight triggers a panic attack and calls up several memories of himself as a child sitting in blood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode| title = Seeing Red | episodelink = | series = Dexter| serieslink = Dexter (TV series) | network = [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] | airdate = June 12, 2006| season = 1 | number = 10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His research leads him to discover he witnessed his mother's murder as a child, and he had a brother named Brian. 
Eventually, the Ice Truck Killer (who turns out to be none other than Rudy) kidnaps Debra after proposing to her, then drugs her and takes her to Dexter's childhood home. When Dexter goes to rescue Debra, he finally recognizes Rudy as his long-lost brother, Brian Moser.

Brian proposes that they begin to murder together, and leads Dexter to a bound and drugged Debra, suggests that she be their first kill. After wrestling with internal conflicts from his attachment to his biological brother and need to protect his adoptive sister, Dexter ultimately decides that his loyalty lies with Debra. Later on, Brian begins to hunt down Debra himself, but Dexter apprehends Brian and then ties him down to an operating table in Brian's apartment. Dexter tearfully slits Brian's throat, staging the crime scene to make it look like Brian committed suicide. Eventually, the police find the body and close the case. The season ends with Dexter wondering what it would be like if everyone knew his secrets and imagining being celebrated outside the police station by an adoring crowd.&lt;ref name="Born Free"/&gt;

=== Season two ===
In season two, Dexter is so haunted by killing his own brother that he cannot resume killing. To make matters worse, Debra, traumatized by her ordeal with the Ice Truck Killer, moves in with Dexter, which hinders his secret life. Dexter's nemesis, [[James Doakes|Sergeant James Doakes]] ([[Erik King]]), harbors lingering suspicions about Dexter's possible connection with the Ice Truck Killer, and he begins to tail Dexter everywhere. To throw him off, Dexter reluctantly refrains from killing for a month. Just as Dexter finds a chance to kill again, over 30 bodies are found in a Miami harbor, provoking a massive search for the so-called "Bay Harbor Butcher".

Rita soon figures out that Dexter has been lying to her and concludes that Dexter is a heroin addict, with which he goes along to hide his real secret. Rita forces him to attend [[Narcotics Anonymous]] meetings, where he meets [[Lila West|Lila Tournay]] ([[Jaime Murray]]), who becomes his sponsor. Lila convinces him to explore his past, and while under extreme duress after confronting and killing his mother's murderer, his relationship with Lila becomes sexual. Dexter confesses to Rita, who dumps him. Lila becomes obsessed with Dexter, believing he is her soulmate. Eventually, however, Dexter's desire to be with Astor and Cody compels him to ask for Rita's forgiveness; she grants it, and they get back together. Dexter learns that Lila is in fact a sociopath who attends NA meetings to vicariously experience emotions she is incapable of feeling, and tells her to leave him alone. Lila retaliates by framing Dexter's colleague and friend [[Angel Batista]] ([[David Zayas]]) for [[rape]], though he is eventually cleared.

Doakes' suspicions subside some when he realizes that Dexter is attending Narcotics Anonymous, but he begins to suspect this is a cover for an even worse secret. As Doakes gets closer to discovering the truth, Dexter provokes him into a physical altercation at work, resulting in Doakes' suspension. In "[[The British Invasion (Dexter)|The British Invasion]]", Doakes finally catches Dexter in the act of disposing of a dismembered body in the [[Florida Everglades]]. Dexter is forced to take Doakes captive and sets about framing him. Lila discovers the cabin in the Everglades where Dexter is holding Doakes and blows it up (with Doakes inside), to protect Dexter. The police eventually find Doakes' charred body, surrounded by Dexter's murderous paraphernalia, and conclude that Doakes was the Bay Harbor Butcher, much to Dexter's relief.&lt;ref name="The British Invasion"/&gt;

Dexter pretends to want to run away with Lila, but she soon discovers that he intends to kill her. Lila kidnaps Astor and Cody, and when Dexter finds them at her house, she sets it on fire and leaves the three of them locked inside. Dexter manages to save the children and escape unhurt. Weeks later, he follows Lila to Paris, where he thanks her for showing him his "true self" before killing her.&lt;ref name="The British Invasion"/&gt;

=== Season three ===
In season three, Dexter finds his life manageable until he discovers that Rita is pregnant.&lt;ref name="Our"/&gt;  Rita and he tacitly consider terminating the pregnancy, until Rita announces she will keep the baby regardless of whether or not Dexter wants to be a father to the child.  Dexter, afraid of what kind of father he would be, considers leaving Rita to parent alone, until Debra convinces him that he would be a great father.  After a few failed marriage proposals, Dexter proposes again by mimicking a declaration of love from a criminal. Rita finally accepts, with her children's blessing.&lt;ref name="Our"/&gt;

Meanwhile, after killing an unknown man in self-defense while attempting to murder a homicidal drug dealer named Freebo, Dexter forms an unlikely friendship with the man's brother, [[Miguel Prado]] ([[Jimmy Smits]]), a popular assistant district attorney.&lt;ref name="Our"/&gt; While hunting down Freebo at night, Prado stumbles upon Dexter, bloody from murdering Freebo; Dexter claims he killed Freebo in self-defense. Prado offers Dexter Freebo's bloody shirt as proof that he will not reveal Dexter's secret.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode| title = Finding Freebo | episodelink = | series = Dexter| serieslink = Dexter (TV series) | network = [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] | airdate = October 5, 2008| season = 3 | number = 2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The two men grow closer, and Dexter even makes Prado his best man. Prado gradually discerns that Dexter is a serial killer, and they begin to murder together according to Dexter's "code". When Prado deviates from the code to murder a rival defense attorney, it sets off a game of competing leverage and blackmail between the two men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode| title = The Damage a Man Can Do | episodelink = | series = Dexter| serieslink = Dexter (TV series) | network = [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] | airdate = November 16, 2008| season = 3 | number = 8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dexter discovers the blood on the shirt is actually bovine, meaning that Prado was just using him as an excuse to kill.

After being tipped off by Prado, a serial killer called "the Skinner" ([[Jesse Borrego]]), who is searching for Freebo, kidnaps Dexter on Dexter's wedding day. Facing certain death, Dexter resolves to keep fighting so he can live to see his son; he frees himself and kills the Skinner by snapping his neck and throwing his body into an arriving police car. Dexter then kills Prado&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode| title = I Had a Dream | episodelink = | series = Dexter| serieslink = Dexter (TV series) | network = [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] | airdate = December 7, 2008| season = 3 | number = 11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and marries Rita, with Debra as his "best man".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode| title = Do You Take Dexter Morgan? | episodelink = | series = Dexter| serieslink = Dexter (TV series) | network = [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] | airdate = December 14, 2008| season = 3 | number = 12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the course of the season, Dexter justifies killing two people who do not fit his code: Nathan Marten (Jason Kaufman), a [[pedophile]] who is stalking Astor;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode| title = The Lion Sleeps Tonight | episodelink = | series = Dexter| serieslink = Dexter (TV series) | network = [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] | airdate = October 12, 2008| season = 3 | number = 3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and his old friend Camilla Figg ([[Margo Martindale]]), who is dying of cancer and asks him to end her suffering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode| title = Easy as Pie | episodelink = | series = Dexter| serieslink = Dexter (TV series) | network = [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] | airdate = November 9, 2008| season = 3 | number = 7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Season four ===
At outset of season four, Rita has given birth to a baby boy, Harrison. Dexter is happy to have a child of his own, but his responsibilities as a new father leave him too exhausted to kill.&lt;ref name="Living"&gt;{{cite episode| title = Living the Dream | episodelink = | series = Dexter| serieslink = Dexter (TV series) | network = [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] | airdate = September 19, 2009| season = 4 | number = 1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dexter finds it increasingly difficult to keep concealing his secret life, which leads to conflict with Rita and Astor, who has entered [[adolescence]].  At Rita's urging, Dexter and she enter couple's therapy.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Dexter episode 412 screenshot.jpg|thumb|left|Dexter, ready to kill [[Arthur Mitchell (Dexter)|Arthur Mitchell]].]] --&gt;
After his first kill of the new season, Dexter falls asleep while driving and has an accident, and the resultant short-term memory loss causes him to forget where his victim's body is.&lt;ref name="Living"/&gt; He eventually retraces his steps and disposes of the body.  After retired Special Agent [[Frank Lundy]] ([[Keith Carradine]]) is murdered, Dexter begins his pursuit of the so-called [[Arthur Mitchell (Dexter)|"Trinity Killer"]], who has been committing ritualistic murders across the country for 30 years.&lt;ref name="Living"/&gt; Once Dexter finds the killer, however, he is shocked to discover that "Trinity" is actually Arthur Mitchell ([[John Lithgow]]), a family man and pillar of his community.

Dexter assumes the alias Kyle Butler and begins to insinuate himself into Mitchell's personal life in an effort to learn how Mitchell balances his family responsibilities with his secret life as a serial killer. To that end, Dexter repeatedly puts off murdering Mitchell, thwarts police efforts to apprehend him, and even saves Mitchell's life when he attempts suicide. Upon getting to know Mitchell, however, Dexter realizes that he misjudged him; after spending Thanksgiving with the Mitchell family, Dexter learns that his would-be mentor is an abusive tyrant whose family is terrified of him. After getting into a violent altercation with Mitchell, Dexter insists that they are nothing alike and thinks he may be able to silence his Dark Passenger permanently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode| title = Hungry Man | episodelink = | series = Dexter| serieslink = Dexter (TV series) | network = [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] | airdate = November 22, 2009| season = 4 | number = 9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When he returns home, Dexter makes arrangements for Rita and him to take a belated honeymoon.  He sends Rita ahead and entraps Mitchell as Mitchell tries to skip town. Before Dexter kills him with a hammer, Mitchell tells him that Dexter will not be able to control his violent urges for long, and "it's already over" &amp;mdash; the same thing Mitchell tells his victims just before killing them. {{Rquote|right|Harry was right. I thought I could change what I am, keep my family safe. But it doesn't matter what I do, what I choose... ''I'm'' what's wrong. This is... fate|Dexter Morgan|"The Getaway", Episode 4.12}}
After returning home, Dexter calls Rita's phone to find out if her and Harrison made it alright. He immediately hears Rita's phone start to ring, indicating that she is in the house. Harrison then starts crying and Dexter is devastated to find Rita lying dead in the bathtub, with Harrison on the floor in a pool of his mother's blood; she was Trinity's final victim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode| title = The Getaway | episodelink = | series = Dexter| serieslink = Dexter (TV series) | network = [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] | airdate = December 13, 2009| season = 4 | number = 12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Season five ===
The season opens with a shocked, guilt-ridden Dexter clutching Harrison as the police respond to his call, in which Dexter says "It was me". While he means that he killed her by letting Trinity know his identity, the police interpret this as an admission of direct guilt. The FBI, however, soon clear Dexter, as he was with the police at Arthur Mitchell's house at the time Rita was murdered.

Dexter spends the next day completely numb, unable to even fake any sort of emotion or grief. As Dexter plans to disconnect and restart, he finds himself confronted by Rankin ([[Brad Carter]]), a brash, foul-mouthed hillbilly. When Rankin insults Rita, Dexter kills him in a fit of rage. Harry tells Dexter that this act is the first human thing he has seen Dexter do since Rita's death.&lt;ref name="My Bad"/&gt;

Distraught over Rita's death, Astor and Cody leave to go live with their grandparents. A struggling Dexter attempts to move on by hiring an Irish nanny to look after Harrison while he goes out to find his next kill. He settles on Boyd Fowler ([[Shawn Hatosy]]), a convicted [[rape|rapist]] whose connection to a string of missing women makes him the perfect target. Dexter kills Fowler, only to find Fowler's latest victim, a young woman named [[Lumen Pierce]] ([[Julia Stiles]]), who is still alive. After debating whether or not to kill her (and thus eliminate a potential witness), Dexter gives in to his better nature and decides to protect her.
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Dexter the big one.jpg|right|thumb|Dexter and Lumen are captured by Jordan Chase.]] --&gt;
Lumen is slow to trust Dexter, but comes to realize he means her no harm. She reveals that Fowler was not the only man who raped her. As Lumen gradually becomes integrated into Dexter's life, she begs him to help her to go after her attackers; Dexter reluctantly agrees. They stalk a children's dentist and the head of security for a high-profile motivational speaker named [[Jordan Chase]] ([[Jonny Lee Miller]]). As the plot thickens, it becomes clear that Chase was also one of Lumen's attackers. Complicating the situation further is Detective [[Joey Quinn]] ([[Desmond Harrington]]), who believes that Dexter killed Rita and is getting too close to finding out Dexter's secrets.

To keep the police occupied, Dexter puts them on Fowler's trail. Dexter becomes personally acquainted with Chase and stumbles onto a photo that proves that all of Lumen's attackers (who are also guilty of [[torture|torturing]], raping, and murdering 12 other women) have known each other since childhood.

Dexter eventually finds a vial of blood that Chase wears around his neck. After extracting a sample, he discovers that the blood belongs to Emily Birch ([[Angela Bettis]]), the rape club's first victim. She provides Lumen and Dexter with the identity of the mysterious fourth attacker in the photo, Alex Tilden ([[Scott Grimes]]). Dexter allows Lumen to kill Tilden by stabbing him in the heart. Dexter and Lumen then become lovers, before continuing their hunt for Chase. As Lumen and Dexter plan to capture Chase, Dexter realizes cameras are in his apartment. Dexter, assuming he is being watched by Quinn, waits for him to return to the surveillance van. As Dexter opens the door to capture Quinn, Stan Liddy ([[Peter Weller]]), a private investigator Quinn had hired to tail Dexter, stuns Dexter with a taser. After Liddy calls Quinn to bust Dexter, Dexter attacks Liddy and kills him in self-defense, after Liddy tries to stab him.

While Dexter deals with Liddy, Lumen gets a call from Emily. Emily appears frightened of Chase and threatens to call the police, but she is revealed to be setting a trap to allow Chase to capture them. Dexter returns to the apartment to find Lumen gone. He tracks Chase to the camp where the rape club had started. In a fit of emotion, he accidentally wrecks the stolen car he is driving, allowing Chase to take him prisoner. Chase brings Dexter to the building in which he is holding Lumen. As Chase is about to kill them, Dexter frees himself with a knife he had stashed and immobilizes Chase by stabbing him through his foot and into the floor. Dexter cuts Lumen free and knocks Chase out. When Chase wakes up, Dexter allows Lumen to kill him. While they are still in the kill room, preparing to move the body, Debra arrives on the scene, though her view of Dexter and Lumen is obstructed by a sheet of plastic. Dexter and Lumen, trapped, remain silent. Without requesting their identity, Debra warns them that she is about to call in backup and allows them to flee before the police arrive.

The next day, when Dexter returns from work, Lumen tells him that she no longer feels the need to kill, and they cannot be together because Dexter's homicidal urges will never leave him. She then leaves to return to the life she had before her kidnapping. The season ends with Dexter surrounded by friends and family at Harrison's first birthday party.

===Season six===
About a year later, Harrison is old enough to walk, and Dexter has begun searching for a preschool, though his [[atheism]] conflicts with the largely religious preschools to which he applies. He finds a greater understanding through Brother Sam ([[Mos Def]], credited as Mos and later as yasiin bey&lt;!-- DO NOT CAPITALIZE yasiin bey AS THIS IS THE EXACT MANNER HE WAS CREDITED ON THE SHOW! --&gt;), an ex-con and murderer whom Dexter once considered killing, who has since become a [[born-again Christian]] who counsels other ex-cons. Dexter initially sees Brother Sam's religious conversion as a scam, but Brother Sam proves himself a truly changed man, and even helps Dexter through a crisis when Harrison undergoes an [[appendectomy]].

However, things go awry when Brother Sam is shot and mortally wounded in his garage. Dexter realizes that a friend of Sam's, Nick ([[Germaine De Leon]]), is responsible, and swears revenge. On his deathbed, Sam forgives Nick and implores Dexter to also forgive him. Dexter considers sparing Nick when he initially appears remorseful, but that proves to be an act; after Sam refuses to press charges on his deathbed, Nick brags about what he did.  An enraged Dexter drowns Nick in the surf, reawakening in him the presence of his dead brother, Brian, who begins to guide him in much the same way that Harry's presence once had.

Brian convinces Dexter to go after Arthur Mitchell's son Jonah ([[Brando Eaton]]), who appears to have also become a killer. Dexter adheres to his father's code, however, causing a schism between his personalities. Dexter finally catches Jonah with the intent of killing him, but relents when he sees that Jonah feels guilty about failing to protect his sister, who committed suicide by slitting an artery in a bathtub, similar to how her father killed his victims. When Jonah and his mother discovered Jonah's sister, their mother blamed the children for their father's shortcomings. This enraged Jonah, who then killed his mother. Learning this new information, Dexter rejects Brian and reaffirms the "Code of Harry", leaving Jonah alive to forgive himself.

In the meantime, Dexter begins investigating "the Doomsday Killer", a serial killer who models his crimes after the [[Book of Revelation]]. Dexter soon finds that the murders are being committed by two people: a [[religious fanaticism|fanatically religious]] college professor named [[List of Dexter characters#James Gellar|James Gellar]] ([[Edward James Olmos]]) and his prot√©g√©, [[Travis Marshall]] ([[Colin Hanks]]). Dexter tracks Marshall down, but balks at killing him, believing that Marshall has a conscience and is simply being led down the wrong path. Dexter then resolves to save Marshall from himself.

After the death of Marshall's sister, Dexter follows him to the old church and discovers Gellar's body in a freezer, concluding that Marshall had been acting alone the whole time, with Gellar as a [[dissociative identity]]. After being forced to accept Gellar's death, Marshall begins to target Dexter, managing to capture him and enact the [[lake of fire]]. Dexter escapes, however, and is rescued by a fishing boat carrying illegal immigrants bound for Florida. Marshall kidnaps Harrison to sacrifice him as the "[[lamb of God]]" during a solar eclipse, but Dexter rescues Harrison and takes Marshall to the old church. Debra walks into the church‚Äîseeking to find Dexter after a recent meeting with a therapist helped her realize that she was in love with her adoptive brother‚Äîonly to see Dexter kill Marshall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode

===Season seven===
In the season-seven opener, Dexter tells a bewildered Debra that he killed Marshall on impulse after Marshall ambushed him. Debra believes him at first, and helps him destroy the old church, with Marshall's body inside. A few days later, however, Debra finds Dexter's knives and collection of blood slides, and asks him point blank if he is a serial killer. Not knowing what else to say, Dexter replies that he is. Debra is horrified, but resolves to help Dexter stop killing by moving in with him and keeping a constant eye on him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode

After weeks under Debra's surveillance, a stressed out Dexter kidnaps Louis Greene ([[Josh Cooke]]), a former coworker with a grudge against him, with the intent of killing him. Dexter relents at the last minute, however, and calls Debra so she can talk him out of it, reassuring her that  some good is in him after all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode| title = Buck the System | episodelink = | series = Dexter| serieslink = Dexter (TV series) | network = [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] | airdate = October 14, 2012| season = 7 | number = 3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dexter escapes Debra's watch long enough to dispose of Ray Speltzer ([[Matt Gerald]]), a brutal serial killer who had evaded prison on a technicality, and Debra comes to understand why Dexter kills. She makes a deal with him: she will not stop Dexter as long he does not tell her about it or interfere with Miami-Metro investigations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode| title = Run | episodelink = | series = Dexter| serieslink = Dexter (TV series) | network = [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] | airdate = October 21, 2012| season = 7 | number = 4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dexter sets his sights on killing [[Hannah McKay]] ([[Yvonne Strahovski]]), a serial poisoner, who as a teenager, had gone on a cross-country killing spree with her boyfriend. Dexter subdues her and prepares to kill her, but stops when Hannah does not appear to fear him. They are both suddenly overcome with attraction and have sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode| title = Do the Wrong Thing | episodelink = | series = Dexter| serieslink = Dexter (TV series) | network = [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] | airdate = November 4, 2012| season = 7 | number = 6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dexter falls in love with Hannah, who helps him realize that his "Dark Passenger" does not control his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode| title = The Dark...

Dexter's romance with Hannah complicates his relationship with Debra, however. Debra is intent on arresting Hannah for the murder of Sal Price, a crime writer for whom Debra had feelings, and Dexter has trouble reconciling his feelings for his girlfriend with his responsibility to his adoptive sister. To make matters worse, Miami-Metro Captain [[Maria LaGuerta]] ([[Lauren Velez]]) reopens the Bay Harbor Butcher case, convinced that Doakes was innocent and that Dexter is hiding something.  When Dexter tries to kill Hector Estrada ([[Nestor Serrano]]), the man who ordered Dexter's mother's murder, LaGuerta arrives at the scene, forcing him to let Estrada go so he can escape. Dexter deduces that LaGuerta had orchestrated Estrada's release from prison to set Dexter up.&lt;ref name="Do You See What I See?"&gt;{{cite episode| title = Do You See What I See? | episodelink = | series = Dexter| serieslink = Dexter (TV series) | network = [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] | airdate = December 9, 2012| season = 7 | number = 11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of the season, mobster [[List of Dexter characters#Isaak Sirko|Isaak Sirko]] ([[Ray Stevenson (actor)|Ray Stevenson]]) vows to kill Dexter to avenge his lover, Viktor Baskov ([[Enver Gjokaj]]), a cop killer and one of Dexter's victims. Fearing for his family's safety, Dexter engineers Sirko's arrest, but Sirko is soon released on bail and resumes his vendetta. Sirko asks for Dexter's protection against his former associates, who fear that he will testify against them; in return, he promises Dexter that he will let him live. Dexter refuses, but ends up inadvertently coming to Sirko's aid when one of his former henchmen attacks them both. Dexter kills the mobster, but is too late to save Sirko, who is mortally wounded during the struggle. As he dies, Sirko tells Dexter that it is not too late for Dexter to find happiness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode| title = Helter Skelter | episodelink = | series = Dexter| serieslink = Dexter (TV series) | network = [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] | airdate = October 25, 2012| season = 7 | number = 9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Debra gets into a near-fatal car accident following a confrontation with Hannah, and insists to Dexter that Hannah poisoned her. Dexter refuses to believe it at first, but he is suspicious enough to order a tox screen on Debra's water bottle found on the driver's floorboard of her car after the accident. To Dexter's horror, the results prove that Hannah had spiked Debra's water with an overdose of [[Xanax]]. Left with no other choice, Dexter gives Debra proof that Hannah murdered Price and looks on, heartbroken, as Debra arrests her.&lt;ref name="Do You See What I See?"/&gt;

LaGuerta has Dexter arrested for the Bay Harbor Butcher murders, but Dexter is released thanks to evidence with which he had tampered to throw LaGuerta off. Dexter is certain that LaGuerta will not give up, however, and resolves to kill her, though doing so would be a violation of his "code". He kidnaps and kills Estrada to lure LaGuerta in, and then knocks her unconscious, planning to shoot her to make it look like Estrada killed her. At that moment, Debra bursts in, holding Dexter at gunpoint and begging him not to go through with it. LaGuerta regains consciousness and urges Debra to kill Dexter. Seeing no way out, Dexter resigns himself to his fate and tells Debra to "do what you have to do". Much to Dexter's surprise, however, Debra turns the gun on LaGuerta, and shoots her dead. As the countdown to the new year begins, Dexter wonders if this is the "beginning of the end".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode| title = Surprise, Motherfucker! | episodelink = | series = Dexter| serieslink = Dexter (TV series) | network = [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] | airdate = December 16, 2012| season = 7 | number = 12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Season eight===
The eighth season opens six months later, with Dexter growing increasingly worried about Debra, who has quit the police force and spiraled into depression and self-destructive behavior. Dexter goes to her new job as a private investigator and learns that Debra is pursuing, and sleeping with, drug dealer Andrew Briggs ([[Rhys Coiro]]). When Dexter confronts her, Debra tells him that she wishes she had killed him instead of LaGuerta. A few days later, Dexter learns that an assassin, El Sapo ([[Nick Gomez (actor)|Nick Gomez]]), is going to kill Briggs and Debra, and Dexter goes to Debra's hotel to save her. A scuffle ensues, in which Dexter kills Briggs. He begs Debra to come with him, but she refuses.&lt;ref name="beautiful"&gt;{{cite episode| title = A Beautiful Day | episodelink = | series = Dexter| serieslink = Dexter (TV series) | network = [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] | airdate = June 30, 2013| season = 8 | number = 1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Soon afterward, El Sapo is found dead, and Dexter is called in to investigate.

Dexter meets Dr. Evelyn Vogel ([[Charlotte Rampling]]), a [[neuropsychiatry|neuropsychiatrist]] consulting with Miami Metro about a serial killer dubbed "the Brain Surgeon" who removes parts of his victims' brains. She tells Dexter that she knew Harry, with whom she came up with Dexter's "code". Vogel believes the killer is one of her former patients and asks Dexter to kill him before the killer goes after her.&lt;ref name="beautiful"/&gt;

Quinn calls Dexter to tell him that Debra has shown up at Miami Metro, blind drunk, and confessed to killing LaGuerta. Panicked, Dexter rushes over with Vogel in tow, and knocks Debra unconscious with a low dose of the tranquilizer he uses on his victims. He realizes he cannot help Debra and asks Vogel to treat her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode| title = [[What's Eating Dexter Morgan?]] | episodelink = | series = Dexter| serieslink = Dexter (TV series) | network = [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] | airdate = July 13, 2013| season = 8 | number = 3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dexter starts looking into another of Vogel's former patients, serial killer A.J. Yates ([[Aaron McCusker]]). He saves one of Yates' victims and confronts the killer, who escapes. The following day, Debra asks Dexter to take a drive with her so they can talk. During the drive, she intentionally crashes the car into the bay, intent on killing them both.

Dexter sets his sights on a new victim: Zach Hamilton ([[Sam Underwood]]), a teenager from a wealthy family who murdered his father's mistress and is now preparing to kill his father. Dexter kidnaps Zach, who admits that he enjoys killing and will do it again. Seeing in Zach a kindred spirit, Dexter promises to teach him how to kill.&lt;ref name="reflection"&gt;{{cite episode| title = A Little Reflection | episodelink = | series = Dexter| serieslink = Dexter (TV series) | network = [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] | airdate = August 4, 2012| season = 8 | number = 6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When Dexter's neighbor Cassie Jollenston ([[Bethany Joy Lenz]]) is murdered, he at first believes Zach is responsible and decides to kill him.

Hannah reappears in Dexter's life when she nonlethally poisons Debra and him,  to get his attention.&lt;ref name="reflection"/&gt; Dexter investigates and finds that she has changed her name and married Miles Castner ([[Julian Sands]]), a wealthy businessman. Dexter goes to see Hannah, who says she had wanted him to kill Castner, but changed her mind after realizing she is still in love with Dexter.

After investigating, Dexter discovers that Zach's killer is related to Vogel. Vogel tells Dexter that she had a son, Daniel, who as a teenager murdered his younger brother Richard before apparently dying in a fire. Dexter discovers that Daniel set the fire himself to fake his own death, and that he is now living under the identity of Cassie's boyfriend Oliver Saxon ([[Darri Ingolfsson]]). Dexter suspects that Saxon is the "Brain Surgeon" and warns Vogel, who tells him to stay out of it; Dexter is unaware that she is sheltering her son.&lt;ref name="music"/&gt; Dexter makes preparations to move while hunting Saxon, the last "loose end". He goes to Vogel's house to make sure she is safe &amp;mdash; only to see Saxon slit her throat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode| title = Goodbye Miami| episodelink = | series = Dexter| serieslink = Dexter (TV series) | network = [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] | airdate = September 8, 2013| season = 8 | number = 10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Days later, Saxon shows up at Dexter's apartment and offers a truce: he will spare Dexter's family if Dexter will leave him alone. Dexter pretends to accept, but is now more than ever determined to kill Saxon. He finds proof of Saxon's murders, which he turns over to the police so that Saxon will be forced to come after him before he leaves Miami. Dexter then enlists Debra's help in subduing Saxon and prepares to kill him. At the last moment, however, Dexter realizes that his love for Hannah is stronger than his need to kill, and he spares Saxon's life. He calls Debra so she can arrest Saxon, and says his goodbyes to  Harry and her. Saxon escapes his bindings, however, and shoots Debra in the gut when she tries to arrest him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode| title = Monkey in a Box | episodelink = | series = Dexter| serieslink = Dexter (TV series) | network = [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] | airdate = September 15, 2013| season = 8 | number = 11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the series finale, "[[Remember the Monsters?]]", Dexter's flight to Argentina is delayed by a hurricane, and he tells Hannah and Harrison to go on without him, intending to take care of Saxon. When he learns what has happened to Debra, Dexter rushes to her side at the hospital, but she tells him to go on and live a good life. Moments later, she suffers a major stroke that leaves her in a [[persistent vegetative state]]. Dexter blames himself and realizes that he will always destroy those he loves; he sees at last that he can never have a happy life. After Saxon is arrested, Dexter kills him in his cell, and convinces Quinn and Batista that he acted in self-defense. Dexter goes to see Debra one last time, turns off her life support, and buries her at sea. He then fakes his own death by wrecking his boat. The series' final scene reveals that he has assumed a new identity as a lumberjack and begun a new life, alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode| title = [[Remember the Monsters?]] | episodelink = | series = Dexter| serieslink = Dexter (TV series) | network = [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] | airdate = September 22, 2013| season = 8 | number = 12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Critical reception ===
[[File:Michael C Hall at SD Comic Con 2013.jpg|thumb|[[Michael C. Hall]] at [[San Diego Comic-Con|Comic-Con]]]]

[[Michael C. Hall]]'s portrayal of Dexter Morgan has received critical acclaim and has won many awards. ''[[Daily News (New York)|The New York Daily News]]'' reported that it was "a central character and performance that takes your breath away". ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' noted that "Hall... is brilliant at conveying the subtle complexity of Dexter". ''[[The Detroit Free Press]]'' gave season two of the series a 70/100 and said: "Hall invests strange, demented Dexter with real heart and humanity". ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' said that "Michael C. Hall's portrayal of the title character remains a towering achievement, one that eclipses the show's other shortcomings and rough patches".

{{cnote|a|While Harry finds the boys in the shipping container on the television show, the investigating officer who finds Dexter is never specified in the novels.}}
{{cnote|b| Brian was ultimately sent to a [[mental institution]] for disturbed children.

'''Divination''' (from Latin ''divinare'' "to foresee, to be inspired by a god",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/SMIGRA*/Divinatio.html|title=LacusCurtius ‚Ä¢ Greek and Roman Divination (Smith's Dictionary, 1875)|work=uchicago.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; related to ''divinus'', [[divinity|divine]]) is the attempt to gain insight into a question or situation by way of an [[occult]]ic, standardized process or ritual.&lt;ref&gt;Peek, P.M. ''African Divination Systems: Ways of Knowing.'' page 2. Indiana University Press. 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; Used in various forms throughout history, diviners ascertain their interpretations of how a [[querent]] should proceed by reading signs, events, or [[omen]]s, or through alleged contact with a [[supernatural]] agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Silva|first=S√≥nia|date=|year=2016|title=Object and Objectivity in Divination|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17432200.2016.1227638|journal=Material Religion|volume=12|issue=4|pages=507‚Äì509|doi=10.1080/17432200.2016.1227638|issn=1743-2200|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Divination can be seen as a systematic method with which to organize what appear to be disjointed, random facets of existence such that they provide insight into a problem at hand. If a distinction is to be made between divination and [[fortune-telling]], divination has a more formal or ritualistic element and often contains a more social character, usually in a [[religion|religious]] context, as seen in [[traditional African medicine]]. Fortune-telling, on the other hand, is a more everyday practice for personal purposes. Particular divination methods vary by culture and religion.

Divination is dismissed by the [[scientific community]] and skeptics as being [[superstition]].&lt;ref&gt;Yau, Julianna. (2002). ''Witchcraft and Magic''. In [[Michael Shermer]]. ''The Skeptic Encyclopedia of Pseudoscience''. ABC-CLIO. pp. 278-282. {{ISBN|1-57607-654-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Regal, Brian. (2009). ''Pseudoscience: A Critical Encyclopedia''.

==History==

===Antiquity===
The Oracle of [[Amun]] at the [[Siwa Oasis]] was made famous when [[Alexander the Great]] visited it after conquering Egypt from Persia in 332 BC.
 
{{bibleref2|Deuteronomy|18:10-12}} or {{bibleref2|Leviticus|19:26}} can be interpreted as categorically forbidding divination. However, some would claim that divination is indeed practiced in the Bible, such as in Exodus 28, when the [[Urim and Thummim]] are mentioned. Some would also say that [[Gideon]] also practiced divination, though when he uses a piece of fleece or wool in {{bibleref2|Judges|6:36-40}}, he is not attempting to predict the outcome of an important battle; rather, he is communicating with [[Yahweh|God]]. Communicating with God through prayer may in some cases be considered divination; both are open, typically two-way conversations with God. In addition, the method of "casting lots" used in {{bibleref2|Joshua|14:1-5}} and {{bibleref2|Joshua|18:1-10}} to divide the conquered lands of [[Canaan]] between the twelve tribes is not seen by some as divination, but as done at the behest of God (Numbers 26:55).

{{See also|Oracle|Greek divination}}
Both oracles and seers in ancient Greece practiced divination. [[Oracle#Greece|Oracles]] were the conduits for the gods on earth; their prophecies were understood to be the will of the gods verbatim. Because of the high demand for oracle consultations and the oracles‚Äô limited work schedule, they were not the main source of divination for the ancient Greeks. That role fell to the seers (''ŒºŒ¨ŒΩœÑŒµŒπœÇ'' in Greek).

Seers were not in direct contact with the gods; instead, they were interpreters of signs provided by the gods. Seers used many methods to explicate the will of the gods including [[extispicy]], bird signs, etc. They were more numerous than the oracles and did not keep a limited schedule; thus, they were highly valued by all Greeks, not just those with the capacity to travel to Delphi or other such distant sites.

The disadvantage to seers was that only direct yes-or-no questions could be answered. Oracles could answer more generalized questions, and seers often had to perform several sacrifices in order to get the most consistent answer. For example, if a general wanted to know if the omens were proper for him to advance on the enemy, he would ask his seer both that question and if it were better for him to remain on the defensive. If the seer gave consistent answers, the advice was considered valid.

At battle, generals would frequently ask seers at both the [[campground]] (a process called the ''hiera'') and at the [[battle]]field (called the ''sphagia''). The hiera entailed the seer slaughtering a sheep and examining its liver for answers regarding a more generic question; the sphagia involved killing a young female goat by slitting its throat and noting the animal‚Äôs last movements and blood flow. The battlefield sacrifice only occurred when two armies prepared for battle against each other. Neither force would advance until the seer revealed appropriate [[omen]]s.

Because the seers had such power over influential individuals in ancient Greece, many were skeptical of the accuracy and honesty of the seers. The degree to which seers were honest depends entirely on the individual seers. Despite the doubt surrounding individual seers, the craft as a whole was well regarded and trusted by the Greeks.&lt;ref&gt;Flower, Michael Attyah. ''The Seer in Ancient Greece.'' Berkeley: University of California Press, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Middle Ages and Early Modern period===
{{see|Medieval magic|Renaissance magic|Folk Catholicism}}
The divination method of casting lots ([[Cleromancy]]) was used by the remaining eleven disciples of Jesus in {{bibleref2|Acts|1:23-26}} to select a replacement for [[Judas Iscariot]]. Therefore, divination was arguably an accepted practice in the early church. However, divination became viewed as a pagan practice by Christian [[emperor]]s during [[ancient Rome]].&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, Michael David. (2007). ''Magic and Superstition in Europe''. Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, Inc. pp. 52-53. {{ISBN|0-7425-3386-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 692 the [[Quinisext Council]], also known as the "Council in Trullo" in the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], passed canons to eliminate pagan and divination practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apostolicconfraternityseminary.com/council_of_trullo.html|title=Council of Trullo - Apostolic Confraternity Seminary|work=apostolicconfraternityseminary.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707152243/http://apostolicconfraternityseminary.com/council_of_trullo.html|archivedate=2011-07-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fortune-telling]] and other forms of divination were widespread through the [[Middle Ages]].&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, Michael David. (2007). ''Magic and Superstition in Europe''.

===Mesoamerica===
{{see also|Mesoamerican religion}}
Divination was a central component of ancient [[Mesoamerican]] religious life. Many [[Aztec religion|Aztec gods]], including central [[creator deity|creator gods]], were described as diviners and were closely associated with [[Magic (paranormal)|sorcery]]. [[Tezcatlipoca]] is the patron of sorcerers and practitioners of [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]]. His name means "smoking mirror", a reference to a device used for divinatory [[scrying]].&lt;ref name="Miller 2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=Miller|first=Mary|title=Gods and Symbols of Ancient Mexico|year=2007|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Maya mythology|Mayan]] ''[[Popol Vuh]]'', the creator gods [[Xmucane and Xpiacoc]] perform divinatory hand casting during the creation of people.&lt;ref name="Miller 2007"/&gt;

Every civilization that developed in [[pre-Columbian Mexico]], from the [[Olmecs]] to the [[Aztecs]], practiced divination in daily life, both public and private. Scrying through the use of reflective water surfaces, [[Mirrors in Mesoamerican culture|mirrors]], or the [[Cleromancy|casting of lots]] were among the most widespread forms of divinatory practice. [[Vision (spirituality)|Vision]]s derived from [[hallucinogens]] were another important form of divination, and are still widely used among contemporary diviners of Mexico. Among the more common [[hallucinogenic plants]] used in divination are [[morning glory]], [[jimson weed]], and [[peyote]].&lt;ref name="Miller 2007"/&gt;

===Taiwan===
As seen previous to this section, many different cultures around the world use divination as a way of understanding the future. The most common act of divination in the Bao‚Äôan village in Taiwan is called the Poe, Bao‚Äôan is not the actual name of the village, but for privacy purposes that is what it will be called. The Poe translated to English means ‚Äúmoon boards‚Äù. The Poe consists of two wood or bamboo blocks cut into the shape of a crescent moon. The one edge is rounded while the other is flat; the two are mirror images. Both crescents are held out in one‚Äôs palms and while kneeling, they are raised to the forehead level. Once in this position the blocks are dropped and the future can be understood depending on their landing. If both fall flat side up or both fall rounded side up, that can be taken as a failure of the deity to agree. If the blocks land one rounded and one flat, the deity agrees. ‚ÄúLaughing poe‚Äù is when rounded sides land down and they rock before coming to a standstill. ‚ÄúNegative poe‚Äù is seen when the flat sides fall downward and abruptly stop, this indicates anger. When there is a positive fall, is called ‚Äúsacred poe‚Äù, although the negative falls are not usually taken seriously. As the blocks are being dropped the question is said in a murmur, and if the answer is yes, the blocks are dropped again. To make sure the answer is definitely a yes, the blocks must fall in a ‚Äúyes‚Äù position three times in a row.
 
A more serious type of divination is the Ki≈ç-√°. There is a small wooden chair, and around the sides of the chair are small pieces of wood that can move up and down in their sockets, this causes a clicking sounds when the chair is moved in any way. Two men hold this chair by its legs before an altar, during this incense are being burned, and the supernatural agent is asked to descend into the chair. It is seen that it is in the chair by an onset of motion. Eventually the chair crashes onto a table prepared with wood chips and burlap. The characters on the table are then traced and these are said to be written by the god who possessed the chair, these characters are then interpreted &lt;ref&gt;Rohsenow, Hill Gates, and David K.

In [[Japan]], divination methods include [[Futomani]] from the [[Shinto]] tradition.

Divination is one of the tenets of [[Serer religion]]. However, only those who have been initiated as [[Saltigue]]s (the [[Serer people|Serer]] high priests and priestesses) can divine the future.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alioune Sarr|Sarr, Alioune]], ¬´ Histoire du Sine-Saloum ¬ª (introduction, bibliographie et notes par Charles Becker), in Bulletin de l'IFAN, tome 46, s√©rie B, nos 3-4, 1986-1987 pp 31-38&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kalis"&gt;Kalis, Simone, "Medecine Traditionnele Religion et Divination Chez Les [[Serer people|Seereer]] [[Kingdom of Sine|Siin]] du [[Senegal]]", L'Harmattan (1997), pp 11-297 {{ISBN|2-7384-5196-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are the "hereditary rain priests"&lt;ref name="Galvan"/&gt; whose role is both religious and medicinal.&lt;ref name="Kalis"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Galvan"&gt;Galvan, Dennis Charles, "The State Must be our Master of Fire : How Peasants Craft Culturally Sustainable Development in Senegal", Berkeley, University of California Press, (2004), pp 86-135, {{ISBN|978-0-520-23591-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Specialized diviners called Ob'guega (doctor of Oguega oracle), as well as Ob'Oronmila (doctor of Oronmila oracle) from the [[Edo people]] of [[West Africa]] for thousands have used divination as a means of foretelling the past, present and future. These diviners are initiated and trained in Iha (divination) of either Ominigbon or Oronmila (Benin Orunmila).

The  [[Yoruba people]] of [[West Africa]] are internationally known for having developed the [[If√°]] system, an intricate process of divination that is performed by an ''[[Babalawo|Awo]]'', an initiated priest or priestess of [[Orunmila]], the spirit of the Yoruba [[oracle]].

{{APhistory}}
'''Eastern Chalukyas''', also known as the '''Chalukyas of Vengi''', were a dynasty that ruled parts of [[South India]] between the 7th and 12th centuries. They started out as governors of the [[Chalukyas of Badami]] in the [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]] region. Subsequently, they became a sovereign power, and ruled the [[Vengi]] region of present-day [[Andhra Pradesh]] until {{circa|1130 CE}}. They continued ruling the region as feudatories of the [[Cholas]] until 1189 CE. 

Originally, the capital of the Eastern Chalukyas was located at the Vengi city (modern [[Pedavegi]] near [[Eluru]]). It was subsequently moved to Rajamahendravaram (modern [[Rajahmundry]]). Throughout their history the Eastern Chalukyas were the cause of many wars between the more powerful [[Cholas]] and [[Western Chalukyas]] over the control of the strategic Vengi country. The five centuries of the Eastern Chalukya rule of Vengi saw not only the consolidation of this region into a unified whole, but also saw the efflorescence of [[Telugu people|Telugu]] culture, literature, poetry and art during the later half of their rule.{{sfn|Rao|1994|p=36}}

== Origin ==

The Chalukyas of Vengi branched off from the [[Chalukyas of Badami]]. The Badami ruler [[Pulakeshin II]] (608‚Äì644 C.E) conquered the [[Vengi]] region in eastern [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]], after defeating the remnants of the [[Vishnukundina]] dynasty. He appointed his brother [[Kubja Vishnuvardhana]] the governor of this newly acquired territory in 624 CE.{{sfn|K. A. Nilakanta Sastri|N Venkataramanayya|1960|p=471}} Vishnuvardhana's viceroyalty subsequently developed into an independent kingdom, possibly after Pulakeshin died fighting the [[Pallavas]] in the [[Battle of Vatapi]].{{sfn|N. Ramesan|1975|p=7}}

From the 11th century onward, the dynasty started claiming legendary [[lunar dynasty]] origins. According to this legend, the dynasty descended from [[Chandra|the Moon]], via [[Budha]], [[Pururava]], the [[Pandavas]], Satanika and Udayana. 59 unnamed descendants of Udayana ruled at [[Ayodhya]]. Their descendant Vijayaditya was killed in a battle with Trilochana [[Pallava dynasty|Pallava]], during an expedition in [[Dakshinapatha]] (Deccan). His pregnant widow was given shelter by Vishnubhatta Somayaji of Mudivemu (modern [[Jammalamadugu]]). She named her son Vishnuvardhana after her benefactor. When the boy grew up, he became the ruler of Dakshinapatha by the grace of the goddess Nanda Bhagavati.{{sfn|N. Ramesan|1975|pp=4-5}}

== History ==

Between 641 CE and 705 CE some kings, except Jayasimha I and Mangi Yuvaraja, ruled for very short durations. Then followed a period of unrest characterised by family feuds and weak rulers. Meanwhile, the [[Rashtrakutas]] of Malkhed ousted [[Western Chalukyas]] of [[Badami]]. The weak rulers of Vengi had to meet the challenge of the Rashtrakutas, who overran their kingdom more than once. There was no Eastern Chalukya ruler who could check them until Gunaga [[Vijayaditya III]] came to power in 848 CE. The then Rashtrakuta ruler [[Amoghavarsha]] treated him as his ally and after Amoghavarsha's death, Vijayaditya proclaimed independence.{{sfn|Nagabhusanasarma|2008|p=62}}

== Administration ==

In its early life, the Eastern Chalukya court was essentially a republic of [[Badami]], and as generations passed, local factors gained in strength and the Vengi monarchy developed features of its own. External influences still continued to be present as the Eastern Chalukyas had long and intimate contact, either friendly or hostile, with the [[Pallavas]], the [[Rashtrakutas]], the [[Cholas]] and the [[Chalukyas]] of Kalyani.{{sfn|The Early History of the Deccan, Volume 2|2009|498}}

=== Type of Government ===

The Eastern Chalukyan government was a monarchy based on the [[Hindu]] philosophy. The inscriptions refer to the traditional seven components of the state (Saptanga), and the eighteen Tirthas (Offices), such as:{{sfn|Rao|1994|pp=53,54}}

* Mantri (Minister)
* [[Purohit]]a (Chaplain)
* Senapati (Commander)
* Yuvaraja (Heir-apparent)
* Dauvarika (Door keeper)
* Pradhana (Chief)
* Adhyaksha (Head of department) and so on.

No information is available as to how the work of administration was carried out. The ''Vishaya'' and ''Kottam'' were the administrative subdivisions known from records. The ''[[Karmarashtra]]'' and the ''Boya-Kottams'' are examples of these. The royal edicts (recording gifts of lands or villages) are addressed to all ''Naiyogi Kavallabhas'', a general term containing no indication of their duties, as well as to the ''Grameyakas'', the residents of the village granted. The ''Manneyas'' are also occasionally referred in inscriptions. They held assignments of land or revenue in different villages.{{sfn|Kumari|2008|p=134}}

Fratricidal wars and foreign invasions frequently disturbed the land. The territory was parcelled out into many small principalities (estates) held by the nobility consisting of collateral branches of the ruling house such as those of Elamanchili, [[Pithapuram]] and Mudigonda, and a few other families such as the Kona Haihayas ([[Heheya Kingdom|Heheya]], Kalachuris, Kolanu Saronathas, [[Chagi]]s, [[Pericchedi|Parichedas]], [[Kota Vamsa]]s, [[Telugu Cholas|Velanadus]] and Kondapadamatis, closely connected by marriage ties with the Eastern Chalukyas and families who were raised to high position for their loyal services. When the Vengi ruler was strong, the nobility paid allegiance and tribute to him, but when the weakness was apparent, they were ready to join hands with the enemies against the royal house.{{sfn|Rao|1994|pp=49,50}}

== Society ==
The population in the [[Vengi]] country was heterogeneous in character. [[Xuanzang]], who travelled in the Andhra country after the establishment of the Eastern Chalukya kingdom, noted that the people were of a violent character, were of a dark complexion and were fond of arts. The society was based on hereditary [[caste system]]. Even the [[Buddhists]] and [[Jainism|Jains]] who originally disregarded caste, adopted it. Besides the four traditional castes, minor communities like Boyas and Savaras (Tribal groups) also existed.{{sfn|Rao|1994|p=55}}

The [[Brahmins]] were held in high esteem in the society. They were proficient in [[Vedas]] and Shastras and were given gifts of land and money. They held lucrative posts such as councillors, ministers and members of civil service. They even entered the army and some of them rose to positions of high command. The [[Rajus|Kshatriyas]] were the ruling class. Their love of intrigue and fighting was responsible for civil war for two centuries. The [[Komati caste|Komatis]] ([[Vaishyas]]) were a flourishing trading community. Their organisation into a powerful guild (Nakaram) which had its headquarters in [[Penugonda]] ([[West Godavari]]) and branches in seventeen other centres had its beginnings in this period. It seems there used to be a minister for communal affairs (Samaya Mantri) in the government. The [[Shudras]] constituted the bulk of the population and there were several sub-castes among them. The army furnished a career for most of them and some of them acquired the status of [[Samanta Raju]] and Mandalika.{{sfn|Rao|1994|p=56}}

== Religion ==
[[File:Eastern Chalukya coin.jpg|thumb|300px|Eastern Chalukya coin. Central punchmark depicting lion standing left. Incuse of punchmarks.]]
[[Hinduism]] was the prominent religion of the Eastern Chalukya kingdom, with [[Shaivism]] being more popular than [[Vaishnavism]]. The Mahasena temple at [[Chebrolu, Guntur district|Chebrolu]] became famous for its annual [[Yatra|Jatra]], which involved a procession of the deity's idol from Chebrolu to [[Vijayawada]] and back.{{sfn|N. Ramesan|1975|p=2}} Some of the rulers, declared themselves as ''Parama Maheswaras'' (Emperors). The Buddhist religious centres eventually attained great celebrity as [[Shiva|Siva]] pilgrim centres. Eastern Chalukya rulers like Vijayaditya II, Yuddhamalla I, Vijayaditya III and Bhima I took active interest in the construction of many temples. The temple establishments like dancers and musicians show that during this period, temples were not only a centre of religious worship but a fostering ground for fine arts.{{sfn|Rao|1994|pp=54,55}}

[[Buddhism]], which was dominant during the [[Satavahanas]] was in decline.{{sfn|N. Ramesan|1975|p=2}} Its monasteries were practically deserted. Due to their love of sacred relics in stupas, a few might have lingered on, [[Xuanzang]] noticed some twenty or more Buddhist monasteries in which more than three thousand monks lived.{{sfn|Rao|1994|p=55}}

[[Jainism]], unlike Buddhism, continued to enjoy some support from the people.{{sfn|N. Ramesan|1975|p=2}} This is evident from the several deserted images in ruined villages all over [[Andhra Pradesh|Andhra]]. The inscriptions also record the construction of Jain temples and grants of land for their support from the monarchs and the people. The rulers like Kubja Vishnuvardhana, [[Vishnuvardhana III]] and [[Amma II]] patronised Jainism. [[Vimaladitya]] even became a declared follower of the doctrine of [[Mahavira]]. [[Vijayawada]], Jenupadu, Penugonda (West Godavari) and Munugodu were the famous Jain centres of the period.{{sfn|Rao|1994|p=56}}

== Literature ==
[[File:Copper plates NMND-9.JPG|thumb|{{circa|10th century}} Sanskrit copper plates of [[Amma II]] written in [[Telugu-Kannada]] script.]]
Telugu literature owes its origin to the Eastern Chalukyas. Poetry makes its first appearance in the [[Addanki]],  [[Kandukur]] and [[Dharmavaram, Anantapur district|Dharmavaram]] inscriptions of Pandaranga, Army Chief of [[Vijayaditya III]], in the later half of the 9th century. However, literary compositions dating earlier than 11th century CE are not clearly known. [[Nannaya]] was the poet-laureate of [[Rajaraja Narendra]] in the middle of the 11th century. An erudite scholar, he was well-versed in the [[Vedas]], [[Shastra]]s and the ancient epics, and undertook the translation of the [[Mahabharata]] into Telugu. Narayana Bhatta who was proficient in eight languages assisted him in his endeavour. Though incomplete, his work is acclaimed as a masterpiece of Telugu literature.{{sfn|Rao|1994|p=48}}
=== Connection between Kannada and Telugu literature ===
Kubja Vishnuvardhana, the founder of the Eastern Chalukya dynasty, was the brother of the [[Chalukya]] king, [[Pulakeshin II]]. The Chalukyas therefore governed both the Karnata and Andhra countries and patronised Kannada as well as Telugu. This very likely led to a close connection between Telugu and Kannada literature. A number of Telugu authors of the age also wrote in Kannada and vice versa. Nannaya-Bhatta's ''Bharata'' in Telugu includes the ''Akkara'', a metre considered unique to Kannada works. The same metre is also found in Yudhamalla's [[Bezwada]] inscription. Another inscription notes that Narayana-Bhatta, who assisted Nannaya-Bhatta in composing the ''Bharata'', was also a Kannada poet and was granted a village by Rajaraja Narendra in 1053 for his contribution. Later Kannada poets, [[Pampa I]] and [[Nagavarma I]], also hailed from families originally from Vengi.&lt;ref name="rnlit"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Narasimhacharya|first1=Ramanujapuram|title=History of Kannada Literature: Readership Lectures|date=1988|orig-year=1934&lt;!--Worldcat estimate--&gt;|publisher=Asian Educational Services|isbn=9788120603035|pages=27, 68|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nOTmIt3wumwC|accessdate=13 September 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Architecture ==
[[File:Draksharama temple - Main entrance.jpg|thumb|The Bhimeshvara temple at Draksharama]]
Due to the widely spread [[Shiva]] devotional cult in the kingdom, the Eastern Chalukyan kings undertook construction of temples on a large scale. [[Vijayaditya II]] is credited with the construction of 108 temples. Yuddhamalla I erected a temple to [[Kartikeya]] at [[Vijayawada]]. [[Bhima I]] constructed the famous [[Draksharama]] and Chalukya [[Bhimavaram]] ([[Samalkot]]) temples. Rajaraja Narendra erected three memorial shrines at [[Kalidindi]] (West Godavari). The Eastern Chalukyas, following the [[Pallava]] and Chalukya traditions, developed their own independent style of architecture, which is visible in the [[Pancharama Kshetras|Pancharama]] shrines (especially the Draksharama temple) and [[Biccavolu]] temples. The Golingeshvara temple at Biccavolu contains some richly carved out sculptures of deities like [[Ardhanarishvara]], Shiva, [[Vishnu]], [[Agni]], [[Chamundi]] and [[Surya]].{{sfn|Rao|1994|pp=42,55}}

'''''Faidherbia''''' is a genus of [[Fabaceae|leguminous]] plants containing one species, '''''Faidherbia albida''''', native to [[Africa]] and the [[Middle East]]. The species was formerly widely included in the genus ''[[Acacia]]'' as ''Acacia albida''. It has also been introduced to [[Pakistan]] and [[India]]. Common names for it include '''apple-ring acacia''' (their circular, indehiscent seed pods resemble apple rings),&lt;ref name=wpa1&gt;{{cite web |last1=Armstrong |first1=W.

It is a thorny [[tree]] growing up {{convert|6‚Äì30|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall and {{convert|2|m|ft|abbr=on}} in trunk diameter. Its deep-penetrating [[tap root]] makes it highly resistant to drought. The bark is grey, and fissured when old. There are 11,000 seeds/kg. ''Faidherbia albida'' is not listed as being a [[threatened species]].&lt;ref name="ILDIS"/&gt;&lt;ref name=apd&gt;African Plants Database: [http://www.ville-ge.ch/cjb/bd/africa/details.php?langue=an&amp;id=62154 ''Faidherbia albida''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926230106/http://www.ville-ge.ch/cjb/bd/africa/details.php?langue=an&amp;id=62154 |date=2007-09-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fao"&gt;FAO: [http://www.fao.org/docrep/006/Q2190E/Q2190E10.htm Handbook on Seeds of Dry-Zone Acacias]&lt;/ref&gt;

It grows in areas with {{convert|250‚Äì600|mm|in|abbr=on}} of rain per year.&lt;ref name="fao"/&gt;

''Faiderbia albida'' is known in the [[Bambara language]] as ''balanzan'' and is the official tree of the city of [[Segou]] on the [[Niger River]] in central [[Mali]]. According to legend, Segou is home to 4,444 ''balanzan'' trees, plus one mysterious "missing tree" the location of which cannot be identified.

In [[Serer language|Serer]] and some of the [[Cangin languages]], it is called ''Saas''. [[Serer creation myth#Saas|Saas]] figures prominently in the [[Serer creation myth|creation myth of the Serer people]]. According to their [[creation myth]], it is the [[tree of life]] and fertility.&lt;ref name="Serer civilisation"&gt;{{fr icon}} [[Henry Gravrand|Gravrand, Henry]], "La civilisation [[Serer people|sereer]]", vol. II : Pangool, Nouvelles √©ditions africaines, [[Dakar]], 1990, pp. 125‚Äì127, {{ISBN|2-7236-1055-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The northernmost natural populations are found in [[relict]] groves in [[Israel]] (in the [[Shimron]] nature reserve, near the [[community settlement (Israel)|community settlement]] of [[Timrat]]). All of the trees in a given grove are genetically identical and seem to have multiplied by [[vegetative reproduction]] only, for thousands of years.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

==Cultivation and uses==
''Faidherbia albida'' is important in the [[Sahel]] for raising [[bee]]s, since its flowers provide bee [[Forage (honeybee)|forage]] at the close of the rainy season, when most other local plants do not.&lt;ref name="world"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070928031700/http://www.worldagroforestry.org/Sites/TreeDBS/aft/speciesPrinterFriendly.asp?Id=1 World AgroForestry]&lt;/ref&gt;

The seed pods are important for raising [[livestock]], are used as [[camel]] [[fodder]] in [[Nigeria]],&lt;ref name="world"/&gt; and are relished by elephant, antelope, buffalo, baboons and various browsers and grazers, though strangely ignored by warthog and zebra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal = Journal of Tropical Ecology | volume = 6  | issue = 04 | date = 1990 | pages = 445‚Äì457 | title = Fruit production by Acacia albida trees in Zambezi riverine woodlands | author = Kevin M. Dunham | doi = 10.1017/S0266467400004843}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The wood is used for canoes, mortars, and pestles and the bark is pounded in Nigeria and used as a packing material on pack animals. The wood has a density of about 560&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; at a water content of 12%.&lt;ref name="fao2"&gt;FAO: [http://www.fao.org/docrep/V5360E/v5360e0f.htm Role of acacia species in the rural economy of dry Africa and the Near East]&lt;/ref&gt; The energy value of the wood as fuel is 19.741 kJ/kg.&lt;ref name="world"/&gt;

Ashes of the wood are used in making soap and as a depilatory and tanning agent for hides. The wood is used for carving; the thorny branches useful for a natural barbed fence.&lt;ref&gt;VITA (1977) {{full citation needed|date=March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Pods and foliage are highly regarded as livestock fodder. Some 90% of Senegalese farmers interviewed by Felker (1981) collected, stored, and rationed Acacia alba pods to livestock. Zimbabweans use the pods to stupefy fish. Humans eat the boiled seeds in times of scarcity in Zimbabwe.

It is also used for [[nitrogen fixation]], [[erosion control]] for crops, for food, drink and medicine. Unlike most other trees, it sheds its leaves in the rainy season; for this reason, it is highly valued in [[agroforestry]] as it can grow among field crops without shading them.&lt;ref name="ILDIS"/&gt;  The leaves from this legume tree are high in nitrogen, and can double yields in maize crops when added to the soil.&lt;ref name="Evergreen Agriculture"&gt;http://www.evergreenagriculture.net/sites/default/files/Evergreen%20Agriculture%20Garrity%20et%20al%20Food%20Security.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Medicinal uses ===
The extract is used to treat ocular infections in [[farm]] animals.&lt;ref name="world"/&gt;

{{coord|32.648124|51.570339|format=dms|region:IR_type:landmark|name=Atashgah complex, Isfahan, Iran|display=title}}
The '''Fire temple of Isfahan''' ({{lang-fa|ÿ¢ÿ™ÿ¥⁄ØÿßŸá ÿßÿµŸÅŸáÿßŸÜ}} ''√Çta≈°g√¢h-e Esfah√¢n'', also Romanized as ''ƒÄtashgƒÅh-e EsfahƒÅn'') is a [[Sassanid|Sassanid-era]] archaeological complex located on a hill of the same name about eight kilometers west of city center of [[Isfahan]], [[Iran]].

The hill, which rises about 210&amp;nbsp;meters above the surrounding plain, was previously called Maras or Marabin after a village near there, and it is by that name that the site is referred to by Arab historians.

==Description==
[[File:Atashgah firetemple Isfahan.jpg|thumb|260px|A view of the fire temple structure on the top of the hill]]

One part of the complex, on the southern flank of the hill, are the remains of a citadel of about twenty buildings (or rooms within buildings), many of which‚Äîparticularly those in the lower half of cluster‚Äîare however only evident as foundation traces. Several buildings in the cluster have a classic ''[[chartaq]]'' "four arch" floor-plan, characteristic of [[Fire temple|Zoroastrian fire-temples]] of the 3rd century onwards and that are the actual ''atashgah''s that housed sacred fires. Other buildings include what may have been storage rooms and living quarters for priests and affluent pilgrims. A tentative identification of the purpose of the ruins was first made in 1937 by Andre Godard,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Godard|first=Andr√©|year=1937|title=L'ƒÄteshkƒÅh d'IsfƒÅhan|journal=AthƒÅr-√© ƒ™rƒÅn: Annales du Service Arch√©ologique de l‚Äôƒ™rƒÅn|volume=2|issue=1|pages=164‚Äì165}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Godard|first=Andr√©|year=1937|title=Les monuments du feu|journal=AthƒÅr-√© ƒ™rƒÅn: Annales du Service Arch√©ologique de l‚Äôƒ™rƒÅn|volume=3|issue=1|pages=7‚Äì80}}, pp. 60-62.&lt;/ref&gt; but it was not until 1960, when architect Maxine Siroux made the first drawings, that the site could be properly studied. Godard's identifications were subsequently confirmed by Klaus Schippman in 1971.&lt;ref name="Schippmann"&gt;{{citation|last=Schippmann|first=Klaus|title=Die iranischen Feuerheiligt√ºmer|year=1971|location=Berlin-New York|publisher=de Gruyter|pages=460‚Äì465}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another feature of the complex are the remains of a tower-like circular building on the very top of the same hill. This structure, which was once at least twenty meters high, is known by the local populace as the ''Burj-i Gurban'', or ''Burj-i Kurban'',&lt;ref name="Jackson"&gt;{{citation|last=Jackson|first=Abraham Valentine Williams|title=Persia Past and Present: A Book of Travel and Research|year=1906|location=New York|publisher=Macmillan|pages=162, 259}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--162 here--&gt; "Tower of Sacrifice," and appears to have been a military watch-tower with a [[Flare (pyrotechnic)|flare]] that could be lit to warn of an approaching enemy (i.e. a [[beacon]]).&lt;ref name="Schippmann"/&gt;

In both cases, the remaining walls are of baked brick, held together with a clay-reed mixture. In the 10th century, the buildings were used by the [[Ismaili|EsmƒÅ'ili]] inhabitants of Isfahan to hide from tax collectors. The Arab historian [[Masudi]] visited the site around the same time, and records local tradition as having believed that the site was converted from one of idol worship to one of fire by "King Yustasf (i.e. [[Vishtaspa]], the patron of [[Zoroaster]]) when he adopted the religion of the Magi."&lt;ref name="Jackson" /&gt;&lt;!-- 259 here --&gt;

==Publications on the structure==
In 2002 archaeologist Alireza Jafari Zand published a report on pre-Islamic Isfahan in which he emphasizes the religious role of the complex, and with reference to [[radiocarbon dating]] suggests that the construction was [[Elamite]] (pre-6th century). A doctoral thesis suggests a "similarity" between the tower and an edifice in Qom known as the ''Chahak'' fire temple; the similarity being that the building in Qom has a cylindrical structure at the top while the tower in Isfahan is based on a circular plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Kazemi|first=Yaghesh|title=Atashgah of Isfahan|location=Isfahan|publisher=Esfahanology center and home of nations|year=2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{refimprove|date=November 2016}}
In [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church), a '''general authority''' is a member of the highest levels of leadership in the church&lt;ref name=eom&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=[[Encyclopedia of Mormonism]] |editor-last=Ludlow |editor-first=Daniel H. |editor-link=Daniel H. Ludlow |year=1992 |publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]] |location=New York |isbn=0028796055 |pages=538‚Äì540 |url=http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/cdm/ref/collection/EoM/id/3724 |title=General Authorities |first=Marvin K. |last=Gardner |authorlink=Marvin K. Gardner}}&lt;/ref&gt; who has administrative and [[ecclesiastical]] authority over the church. A general authority's jurisdiction is church-wide, in contrast to the responsibilities of a local authority or an area authority, which relate to a particular area, unit, or department of the church. As a group, the general authorities are often referred to as "'''the Brethren'''".&lt;ref name=eom/&gt; As of October 2017, there are 109 general authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.lds.org/church/leaders?lang=eng |title=General Authorities and General Officers |department=Organization |website=LDS Church |access-date= 2014-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin of the term ==
The first scriptural use of the term ''general authority'' was in minutes of a meeting for the organization of the [[Presiding High Council]] in 1834. Though the original minutes did not refer to the term ''general authorities'', the revised minutes, which were included in the 1835 edition of the [[Doctrine and Covenants]], stated that decisions of the [[Quorum of the Twelve Apostles (LDS Church)|Quorum of the Twelve Apostles]] "can only be called into question by the general authorities of the church in case of transgression."&lt;ref&gt;Doctrine and Covenants, {{sourcetext|source=The Doctrine and Covenants|book=Section 102|verse=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of the term ''general authorities'' at this time and in this context is generally interpreted to include the [[First Presidency (LDS Church)|First Presidency]] and the [[Presiding High Council]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

== Composition and distinction from general officers ==
By definition, general authorities are members of the church's [[Priesthood (LDS Church)|priesthood]].&lt;ref name=eom/&gt; In order of precedence,&lt;ref name=eom/&gt; the general authorities include the members of the following leadership organizations:

Most have become Assistants to the Twelve or members of the First Quorum of Seventy; [[Robert D. Hales]] was called as member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. In 2012, [[H. David Burton]] and his counselors were released and designated as emeritus general authorities.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== General officers ===
Not all church leaders with church-wide responsibility are considered general authorities. The [[General auxiliary presidencies|general presidencies]] of the church's [[Auxiliary organization (LDS Church)|auxiliary organizations]], which are sustained as general officers of the church, but are not general authorities,&lt;ref name = eom/&gt; include the general presidencies of the following organizations:

* [[Young Men Organization|Young Men]]
* [[Sunday School (LDS Church)|Sunday School]]
* [[Relief Society]]
* [[Young Women Organization|Young Women]]
* [[Primary (LDS Church)|Primary]]

The latter three groups are composed of women and represent the only three organizations in which women are given church-wide authority. 

Also excluded from the definition of general authorities are members of the [[Seventy (LDS Church)|Third through the Eighth Quorums of the Seventy]], who are called ''[[Seventy (LDS Church)|area seventies]]'' and have responsibilities relating to a limited [[Area (LDS Church)|geographical area]], not church-wide authority.&lt;ref Name="Quorums of the Seventy"&gt;{{citation |title=Quorums of the Seventy |url=http://www.lds.org/church/leaders/quorums-of-the-seventy?lang=eng |department=Organization |website=LDS Church |access-date=2013-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until 2004, general leadership for the [[Sunday School (LDS Church)|Sunday School]] and [[Young Men Organization|Young Men]] organizations had historically been filled by general authorities. However, in the church's April 2004 [[General Conference (LDS Church)|general conference]], [[Thomas S. Monson]], of the First Presidency, announced that "a recent decision [has been made] that members of the Quorums of the Seventy [will] not serve in the general presidencies of the Sunday School and Young Men."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://www.lds.org/ensign/2004/05/the-sustaining-of-church-officers |title= The Sustaining of Church Officers |journal= [[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]] |date=May 2004 |page= 24 |first= Thomas S. |last= Monson |authorlink= Thomas S. Monson }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to this change, no general auxiliary presidencies are composed of general authorities. Rather, the general authority seventies remain active in general church committees and have less jurisdiction over local [[Stake (Mormonism)|stakes]], particularly in [[North America]]. Generally, [[stake president]]s now report to area seventies, who in turn report to [[area presidencies]], which are usually composed of general authority seventies. In [[North America]], there are no area presidencies, with members of the Presidency of the Seventy taking the responsibility of overseeing the [[Area (LDS Church)|areas]].

Typically, general authorities are given the [[sealing power]], while general officers and area seventies are not.

== Tenure ==
A person is typically called to be a general authority or general officer by a member of the First Presidency or the Quorum of the Twelve. The president of the church and members of the Quorum of the Twelve are typically called for life, although there have been more than a dozen instances when an apostle has been released from his service in the Quorum of the Twelve due to disfellowshipment, excommunication, or resignation.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://rsc.byu.edu/archived/prophets-and-apostles-last-dispensation/members-quorum-twelve-called-each-president-church |contribution= Members of the Quorum of the Twelve Called By Each President of the Church |first= Lawrence R. |last= Flake |title= Prophets and Apostles of the Last Dispensation |location= Provo, Utah |publisher= [[Religious Studies Center]], [[Brigham Young University]] |year= 2001 |pages= 321‚Äì322 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

As with any calling in the church, general authorities and general officers serve "until they are released". In current church practice, men called to the First Quorum of the Seventy typically remain general authorities for life, but are granted [[emeritus]] status in the October following their 70th birthday.&lt;ref&gt;This practice had become more flexible for a period of time when [[Gordon B. Hinckley]] was church president.  For example, as of the October 2004 General Conference, three of the seven members of the Presidency of the Seventy, two other members of the First Quorum, and four members of the Second Quorum were aged 70 or more and continued in office.  During the administration of [[Thomas S. Monson]], the typical pattern described has been used.&lt;/ref&gt;  Members of the [[Second Quorum of the Seventy]] are typically called for a period of five to seven years. When members of the Second Quorum are released, they are no longer general authorities of the church. When members of the [[Presiding Bishop (LDS Church)|presiding bishopric]] are released, they typically become members of the First Quorum of the Seventy and are therefore retained as lifetime general authorities, including later being granted emeritus status.&lt;ref&gt;The April 2012 release of [[H. David Burton]] and his counselors was an exception to this, as they were simply designated as emeritus general authorities, rather than members of the First Quorum.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Common consent ==
In the biannual [[General Conference (LDS Church)|general conferences]] of the church held in April and October, all of the general authorities and general officers of the church are presented to the [[Latter-day Saints]] for a sustaining vote, in accordance with the church's interpretation of the principle of [[common consent (Mormonism)|"common consent"]].&lt;ref name=eom/&gt; This is a voluntary indication made by each member (usually by raising the right hand) that the member assents to be led by the individuals presented as general authorities and general officers. Members of the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles are always named by name, as are any persons being added or released from a position or any general authority or general officer moving from one organization to another (e.g., a member of the First Quorum of the Seventy being called to the Presidency of the Seventy). Otherwise, the general authorities and general officers of the church are simply sustained "as presently constituted".

This biannual procedure is dictated by church theology, which states that the church shall be governed by the common consent of its membership.&lt;ref&gt;Doctrine and Covenants, {{sourcetext|source=The Doctrine and Covenants|book=Section 20|verse=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dissenting votes are rare and have even more rarely prevented a person from holding the proposed position. General authorities and general officers are also assigned to deliver sermons during the two-day conferences.

[[Utrecht]], [[Museum Catharijneconvent]]. The orb, or the globe of the world, is almost exclusively associated with the Father in depictions of the [[Trinity]].&lt;ref name="George Ferguson page 222"&gt;George Ferguson, 1996 ''Signs &amp; symbols in Christian art'' {{ISBN|0-19-501432-4}} page 222&lt;/ref&gt;]]
For about a thousand years, in obedience to interpretations of specific [[Bible]] passages, pictorial '''depictions of God in Western Christianity''' had been avoided by [[Christian]] artists. At first only the [[Hand of God (art)|Hand of God]], often emerging from a cloud, was portrayed.  Gradually, portrayals of the head and later the whole figure were depicted, and by the time of the [[Renaissance]] artistic representations of [[God the Father]] were freely used in the Western Church.&lt;ref&gt;George Ferguson, 1996 ''Signs &amp; symbols in Christian art'', {{ISBN|0-19-501432-4}} page 92&lt;/ref&gt;

God the Father can be seen in some late Byzantine [[Cretan School]] icons, and ones from the borders of the Catholic and Orthodox worlds, under Western influence, but after the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] came down firmly against depicting him in 1667, he can hardly be seen in Russian art.  Protestants generally disapprove of the depiction of God the Father, and originally did so strongly.

==Background and early history==
Early Christians believed that the words of [[Book of Exodus]] 33:20 "Thou canst not see my face: for there shall no man see Me and live" and of the [[Gospel of John]] 1:18: "No man hath seen God at any time" were meant to apply not only to the Father, but to all attempts at the depiction of the Father.&lt;ref name="James Cornwell page 2"&gt;James Cornwell, 2009 ''Saints, Signs, and Symbols: The Symbolic Language of Christian Art'' {{ISBN|0-8192-2345-X}} page 2&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Enluminure Drogon c.jpg|thumb|The [[Hand of God (art)|Hand of God]] symbol in the [[Ascension of Christ|Ascension]] from the [[Drogo Sacramentary]], c. 850]]
The [[Hand of God (art)|Hand of God]], an artistic metaphor, is found several times in the only ancient [[synagogue]] with a large surviving decorative scheme, the [[Dura Europos Synagogue]] of the mid-3rd century, and was probably adopted into [[Early Christian art]] from [[Jewish art]]. It was common in [[Late Antique]] art in both East and West, and remained the main way of depicting the actions or approval of God the Father in the West until about the end of the [[Romanesque art|Romanesque period]]. It also represents the ''[[bath Kol]]'' (literally "daughter of a voice") or voice of God,&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;A matter disputed by some scholars&lt;/ref&gt; similar to Jewish depictions.

Historically considered, God the Father is more frequently manifested in the [[Old Testament]], while the Son is manifested in the [[New Testament]]. Hence it might be said that the Old Testament refers more especially to the history of the Father and the New Testament to that of the Son. Yet, in early depictions of scenes from the Old Testament, artists used the conventional [[depiction of Jesus]] to represent the Father,&lt;ref&gt;Adolphe Napol√©on Didron, 2003 ''Christian iconography: or The history of Christian art in the middle ages, Volume 1'' {{ISBN|0-7661-4075-X}} pages 167&lt;/ref&gt; especially in depictions of the story of [[Adam and Eve]], the most frequently depicted Old Testament narrative shown in Early Medieval art, and one that was felt to require the depiction of a figure of God "walking in the garden" (Genesis 3:8).

The account in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] naturally credits the [[Creation according to Genesis|Creation]] to the single figure of God, in Christian terms, God the Father.  However the first person plural in Genesis 1:26 "And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness", and New Testament references to Christ as Creator (John 1:3, Colossians 1:15) led Early Christian writers to associate the Creation with the [[Logos (Christianity)|Logos]], or pre-existing Christ, [[God the Son]].  From the 4th century the church was also keen to affirm the doctrine of [[consubstantiality]] confirmed in the [[Nicene Creed]] of 325.


It was therefore usual to have depictions of Jesus as Logos taking the place of the Father and creating the world alone, or commanding [[Noah's Ark|Noah]] to construct the ark or speaking to Moses from the [[Burning bush]].&lt;ref&gt;Adolphe Napol√©on Didron, 2003 ''Christian iconography: or The history of Christian art in the middle ages, Volume 1'' {{ISBN|0-7661-4075-X}} pages 167-170&lt;/ref&gt;  There was also a brief period in the 4th century when the [[Trinity]] were depicted as three near-identical figures, mostly in depicting scenes from Genesis; the [[Dogmatic Sarcophagus]] in the Vatican is the best known example.  In isolated cases this iconography is found throughout the Middle Ages, and revived somewhat from the 15th century, though it [[Trinity#Less common types of depiction|attracted increasing disapproval]] from church authorities.  A variant is [[Enguerrand Quarton]]'s contract for the [[Coronation of the Virgin]] requiring him to represent the Father and Son of the Holy Trinity as identical figures.&lt;ref&gt;Dominique Thi√©baut: "Enguerrand Quarton", Grove Art Online. Oxford University Press, 2007, [http://www.groveart.com/]&lt;/ref&gt;

One scholar has suggested that the enthroned figure in the centre of the [[apse]] mosaic of [[Santa Pudenziana]] in Rome of 390-420, normally regarded as Christ, in fact represents [[God the Father]].&lt;ref&gt;Suggestion by F.W. Sclatter, see review by W. Eugene Kleinbauer of ''The Clash of Gods: A Reinterpretation of Early Christian Art'', by Thomas F. Mathews, ''Speculum'', Vol. 70, No. 4 (Oct., 1995), pp. 937-941, Medieval Academy of America, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2865390 JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

In situations, such as the [[Baptism of Jesus|Baptism of Christ]], where a specific representation of God the Father was indicated, the [[Hand of God (art)|Hand of God]] was used, with increasing freedom from the [[Carolingian art|Carolingian period]] until the end of the [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]].  This motif now, since the discovery of the 3rd-century [[Dura Europos synagogue]], seems to have been borrowed from [[Jewish art]], and is found in Christian art almost from its beginnings.

The use of religious images in general continued to increase up to the end of the 7th century, to the point that in 695, upon assuming the throne, [[Byzantine emperor]] [[Justinian II]] put an image of Christ on the obverse side of his gold coins, resulting in a rift which ended the use of [[Byzantine]] coin types in the Islamic world.&lt;ref&gt;Robin Cormack, 1985 ''Writing in Gold, Byzantine Society and its Icons'', {{ISBN|0-540-01085-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the increase in religious imagery did not include depictions of God the Father. For instance, while the eighty second canon of the [[Council of Trullo]] in 692 did not specifically condemn images of The Father, it suggested that icons of [[Christ]] were preferred over Old Testament shadows and figures.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Bigham, 1995 ''Image of God the Father in Orthodox Theology and Iconography'' {{ISBN|1-879038-15-3}} page 27&lt;/ref&gt;

The beginning of the 8th century witnessed the suppression and destruction of religious icons as the period of [[Byzantine iconoclasm]] (literally ''image-breaking'') started. Emperor [[Leo III the Isaurian|Leo III]] (717&amp;ndash;741), suppressed the use of icons by [[emperor|imperial]] [[edict]] of the [[Byzantine Empire]], presumably due to a military loss which he attributed to the undue veneration of icons.&lt;ref&gt;According to accounts by Patriarch Nikephoros and the chronicler Theophanes&lt;/ref&gt; The edict (which was issued without consulting the Church) forbade the veneration of religious images but did not apply to other forms of art, including the image of the emperor, or religious symbols such as the cross.&lt;ref&gt;Warren Treadgold, A History of the Byzantine State and Society, Stanford University Press, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; Theological arguments against icons then began to appear with [[iconoclasm|iconoclasts]] arguing that icons could not represent both the divine and the human natures of Jesus at the same time. In this atmosphere, no public depictions of God the Father were even attempted and such depictions only began to appear two centuries later.

==The end of iconoclasm==
[[File:Gottvater thronend Westfalen 15 Jh.jpg|thumb|240px|God the Father on a throne, with the [[Virgin Mary]] and Jesus, [[Westphalia]], Germany, late 15th century.]]
The [[Second Council of Nicaea]] in 787 effectively ended the first period of [[Byzantine iconoclasm]] and restored the honouring of icons and holy images in general.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Gibbon, 1995 ''The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire'' {{ISBN|0-679-60148-1}} page 1693&lt;/ref&gt; However, this did not immediately translate into large scale depictions of God the Father. Even supporters of the use of icons in the 8th century, such as Saint [[John of Damascus]], drew a distinction between images of God the Father and those of Christ.

In his treatise ''On the Divine Images'' John of Damascus wrote: "In former times, God who is without form or body, could never be depicted. But now when God is seen in the flesh conversing with men, I make an image of the God whom I see".&lt;ref&gt;St. John of Damascus, ''Three Treatises on the Divine Images'' {{ISBN|0-88141-245-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The implication here is that insofar as God the Father or the Spirit did not become man, visible and tangible, images and portrait icons can not be depicted. So what was true for the whole [[Trinity]] before Christ remains true for the Father and the [[Holy Spirit|Spirit]] but not for the Word. John of Damascus wrote:&lt;ref&gt;Steven Bigham, 1995 ''Image of God the Father in Orthodox Theology and Iconography'' {{ISBN|1-879038-15-3}} page 29&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"If we attempt to make an image of the invisible God, this would be sinful indeed. It is impossible to portray one who is without body:invisible, uncircumscribed and without form."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Ermitorio del Calvario 5.jpg|thumb|left|Calvary hermitage, [[L'Alcora|Alcora]], Spain, 18th century.]]
Around 790 [[Charlemagne]] ordered a set of four books that became known as the [[Libri Carolini]] (i.e. "Charles' books") to refute what his court mistakenly understood to be the iconoclast decrees of the Byzantine [[Second Council of Nicaea]] regarding sacred images. Although not well known during the Middle Ages, these books describe the key elements of the Catholic theological position on sacred images. To the [[Western Church]], images were just objects made by craftsmen, to be utilized for stimulating the senses of the faithful, and to be respected for the sake of the subject represented, not in themselves.

The [[Council of Constantinople (869)]] (considered ecumenical by the Western Church, but not the [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Eastern Church]]) reaffirmed the decisions of the Second Council of Nicaea and helped stamp out any remaining coals of [[iconoclasm]]. Specifically, its third canon required the image of Christ to have veneration equal with that of a Gospel book:&lt;ref&gt;Gesa Elsbeth Thiessen, 2005 ''Theological aesthetics'' {{ISBN|0-8028-2888-4}} page 65&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
We decree that the sacred image of our Lord Jesus Christ, the liberator and Savior of all people, must be venerated with the same honor as is given the book of the holy Gospels. For as through the language of the words contained in this book all can reach salvation, so, due to the action which these images exercise by their colors, all wise and simple alike, can derive profit from them.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

But images of God the Father were not directly addressed in Constantinople in 869. A list of permitted icons was enumerated at this Council, but images of God the Father were not among them.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Bigham, 1995 ''Image of God the Father in Orthodox Theology and Iconography'' {{ISBN|1-879038-15-3}} page 41&lt;/ref&gt; However, the general acceptance of icons and holy images began to create an atmosphere in which God the Father could be depicted.{{cn|date=June 2016|reason=this was before the schism between Catholic and Orthodox}}

==Middle ages to the Renaissance==
[[File:God the Father with His Right Hand Raised in Blessing.jpg|thumb|240px|''God the Father with His Right Hand Raised in Blessing'', with a triangular halo representing the Trinity, [[Girolamo dai Libri]] c. 1555.]]
Prior to the 10th century no attempt was made to represent a separate depiction as a full human figure of [[God the Father]] in [[Western art]].&lt;ref name="James Cornwell page 2"/&gt; Yet, Western art eventually required some way to illustrate the presence of the Father, so through successive representations a set of artistic styles for the depiction of the Father in human form gradually emerged around the 10th century AD.

It appears that when early artists designed to represent God the Father, fear and awe restrained them from a delineation of the whole person. Typically only a small part would be represented, usually the hand, or sometimes the face, but rarely the whole person.  In many images, the figure of the Son supplants the Father, so a smaller portion of the person of the Father is depicted.&lt;ref&gt;Adolphe Napol√©on Didron, 2003 ''Christian iconography: or The history of Christian art in the middle ages'' {{ISBN|0-7661-4075-X}} pages 169&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 12th century depictions of God the Father had started to appear in French [[illuminated manuscript]]s, which as a less public form could often be more adventurous in their iconography, and in [[stained glass]] church windows in England. Initially the head or bust was usually shown in some form of frame of clouds in the top of the picture space, where the Hand of God had formerly appeared; the [[Baptism of Jesus|Baptism of Christ]] on the famous [[Baptismal font at St Bartholomew's Church, Li√®ge|baptismal font in Li√®ge]] of [[Rainer of Huy]] is an example from 1118 (a Hand of God is used in another scene).  Gradually the amount of the body shown can increase to a half-length figure, then a full-length, usually enthroned, as in [[Giotto]]'s [[fresco]] of c. 1305 in [[Padua]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Arena Chapel]], at the top of the triumphal arch, ''God sending out the angel of the Annunciation''. See Schiller, I, fig 15&lt;/ref&gt;   In the 14th century the [[Naples Bible]] carried a depiction of God the Father in the [[Burning bush]]. By the early 15th century, the [[Tr√®s Riches Heures du Duc de Berry]] has a considerable number of images, including an elderly but tall and elegant full-length figure walking in the [[Garden of Eden]] (gallery), which show a considerable diversity of apparent ages and dress.  The [[Battistero di San Giovanni (Florence)#Lorenzo Ghiberti|"Gates of Paradise" of the Florence Baptistry]] by [[Lorenzo Ghiberti]], begun in 1425 show a similar tall full-length Father.  The [[Rohan Book of Hours]] of about 1430 also included depictions of God the Father in half-length human form, which were now becoming standard, and the Hand of God becoming rarer.  At the same period other works, like the large Genesis [[altarpiece]] by the Hamburg painter [[Meister Bertram]], continued to use the old depiction of Christ as ''Logos'' in Genesis scenes.  In the 15th century there was a brief fashion for depicting all three persons of the Trinity as [[Trinity#Less common types of depiction|similar or identical figures with the usual appearance of Christ]].

[[File:Andrea_del_Verrocchio,_Leonardo_da_Vinci_-_Baptism_of_Christ_-_Uffizi.jpg|thumb|left|Two "''Hands of God''" (relatively unusual) and the [[Holy Spirit]] as a dove in [[The Baptism of Christ (Verrocchio)|''Baptism of Christ'', by Verrocchio]], 1472.]]
[[File:Damian. The Ancient of Days.jpg|thumb|''The Ancient of Days'', a 14th-century fresco from [[Ubisi]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]].]]
In an early Venetian school ''[[Coronation of the Virgin]]'' by [[Giovanni d'Alemagna]] and [[Antonio Vivarini]], (c. 1443) (see gallery below) The Father is shown in the representation consistently used by other artists later, namely as a patriarch, with benign, yet powerful countenance and with long white hair and a beard, a depiction largely derived from, and justified by, the description of the [[Ancient of Days]] in the [[Old Testament]], the nearest approach to a physical description of God in the Old Testament:&lt;ref&gt;Bigham Chapter 7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;. ...the Ancient of Days did sit, whose garment was white as snow, and the hair of his head like the pure wool: his throne was like the fiery flame, and his wheels as burning fire. ([[Book of Daniel|Daniel]] 7:9) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
In the ''Annunciation'' by [[Benvenuto di Giovanni]] in 1470, God the Father is portrayed in the red robe and a hat that resembles that of a Cardinal. However, even in the later part of the 15th century, the representation of the Father and the Holy Spirit as "hands and dove" continued, e.g. in [[The Baptism of Christ (Verrocchio)|Verrocchio's ''Baptism of Christ'']] in 1472.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur de Bles, 2004 ''How to Distinguish the Saints in Art by Their Costumes, Symbols and Attributes'' {{ISBN|1-4179-0870-X}} page 32&lt;/ref&gt;

In Renaissance paintings of the adoration of the Trinity, God may be depicted in two ways, either with emphasis on The Father, or the three elements of the Trinity. The most usual depiction of the Trinity in Renaissance art depicts God the Father as an old man, usually with a long beard and patriarchal in appearance, sometimes with a triangular halo (as a reference to the Trinity), or with a papal tiara, specially in Northern Renaissance painting. In these depictions The Father may hold a globe or book. He is behind and above Christ on the Cross in the [[Throne of Mercy]] iconography. A dove, the symbol of the [[Holy Spirit]] may hover above. Various people from different classes of society, e.g. kings, popes or martyrs may be present in the picture. In a Trinitarian [[Piet√†]], God the Father is often shown wearing a papal dress and a papal tiara, supporting the dead Christ in his arms. They float in heaven with angels who carry the [[instruments of the Passion]].&lt;ref&gt;Irene Earls, 1987 ''Renaissance art: a topical dictionary'' {{ISBN|0-313-24658-0}} pages 8 and 283&lt;/ref&gt;

The orb, or the globe of the world, is rarely shown with the other two persons of the Trinity and is almost exclusively restricted to God the Father, but is not a definite indicator since it is sometimes used in depictions of Christ. A book, although often depicted with the Father is not an indicator of the Father and is also used with Christ.&lt;ref name="George Ferguson page 222"/&gt;

==From Renaissance to Baroque==
Representations of God the Father and the Trinity were attacked both by Protestants and within Catholicism, by the [[Jansenist]] and [[Baianist]] movements as well as more orthodox theologians.  As with other attacks on Catholic imagery, this had the effect both of reducing Church support for the less central depictions, and strengthening it for the core ones.  In the [[Western Church]], the pressure to restrain religious imagery resulted in the highly influential decrees of the final session of the [[Council of Trent]] in 1563. The Council of Trent decrees confirmed the traditional Catholic doctrine that images only represented the person depicted, and that veneration to them was paid to the person, not the image.&lt;ref&gt;[http://history.hanover.edu/texts/trent/ct25.html Text of the 25th decree of the Council of Trent]&lt;/ref&gt;

Artistic depictions of God the Father were uncontroversial in Catholic art thereafter, but less common depictions of the [[Trinity]] were condemned.  In 1745 [[Pope Benedict XIV]] explicitly supported the [[Throne of Mercy]] depiction, referring to the "Ancient of Days", but in 1786 it was still necessary for [[Pope Pius VI]] to issue a [[papal bull]] condemning the decision of an Italian church council to remove all images of the Trinity from churches.&lt;ref&gt;Bigham, 73-76&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Dividing Light from Darkness.jpg|thumb|302x302px|''[[Separation of Light from Darkness]]'', by [[Michelangelo]], c.first half of 1512.]]
God the Father appears in several Genesis scenes in [[Michelangelo]]'s [[Sistine Chapel ceiling]], most famously ''[[The Creation of Adam]]''. God the Father is depicted as a powerful figure, floating in the clouds in ''[[Assumption of the Virgin (Titian)|Titian's Assumption of the Virgin]]'' (see gallery below) in the [[Frari of Venice]], long admired as a masterpiece of [[High Renaissance]] art.&lt;ref&gt;Louis Lohr Martz, 1991 ''From Renaissance to baroque: essays on literature and art'' {{ISBN|0-8262-0796-0}} page 222&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Church of the Ges√π]] in Rome includes a number of 16th-century depictions of [[God the Father]]. In some of these paintings the [[Trinity]] is still alluded to in terms of three angels, but  [[Giovanni Battista Fiammeri]] also depicted God the Father riding on a cloud, above the scenes.&lt;ref&gt;Gauvin A. Bailey, 2003 ''Between Renaissance and Baroque: Jesuit art in Rome'' {{ISBN|0-8020-3721-6}} page 233&lt;/ref&gt;

In both the ''Last Judgment'' and the ''Coronation of the Virgin'' paintings by [[Rubens]] (see gallery below) he depicted God the Father in the form that by then had become widely accepted, as a bearded patriarchal figure above the fray.  In the 17th century, the two Spanish artists [[Diego Vel√°zquez|Vel√°zquez]] (whose father-in-law [[Francisco Pacheco]] was in charge of the approval of new images for the Inquisition) and [[Bartolom√© Esteban Murillo|Murillo]] both depicted God the Father as a patriarchal figure with a white beard (see gallery below) in a purple robe.

While representations of God the Father were growing in Italy, Spain, Germany and the Low Countries, there was resistance elsewhere in Europe, even during the 17th century. In 1632 most members of the [[Star Chamber]] court in England (except the [[Archbishop of York]]) condemned the use of the images of the Trinity in church windows, and some considered them illegal.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Winston, 1847 ''An Inquiry Into the Difference of Style Observable in Ancient Glass Paintings, Especially in England'' {{ISBN|1-103-66622-3}}, (2009) page 229&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the 17th century [[Sir Thomas Browne]] wrote that he considered the depiction of God the Father as an old man "a dangerous act" that might lead to Egyptian symbolism.&lt;ref&gt;Sir Thomas Browne's Works, 1852, {{ISBN|0559376871}}, 2006 page 156&lt;/ref&gt; In 1847, Charles Winston was still critical of such images as a "''[[Romish|Romish trend]]''" (a term used to refer to [[Roman Catholic (term)|Roman Catholics]]) that he considered best avoided in England.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Winston, 1847 ''An Inquiry Into the Difference of Style Observable in Ancient Glass Paintings, Especially in England'' {{ISBN|1-103-66622-3}}, (2009) page 230&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1667 the 43rd chapter of the [[Moscow Sobor of 1666‚Äì1667|Great Moscow Council]] specifically included a ban on a number of depictions of God the Father and the Holy Spirit, which then also resulted in a whole range of other icons being placed on the forbidden list,&lt;ref&gt;Oleg Tarasov, 2004 ''Icon and devotion: sacred spaces in Imperial Russia'' {{ISBN|1-86189-118-0}} page 185&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://genuineorthodoxchurch.com/moscow_1666.htm Orthodox church web site]&lt;/ref&gt; mostly affecting Western-style depictions which had been gaining ground in Orthodox icons. The Council also declared that the person of the Trinity who was the "Ancient of Days" was Christ, as ''Logos'', not God the Father. However some icons continued to be produced in Russia, as well as [[Greece]], [[Romania]], and other Orthodox countries.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3023">'''''Govinda [[Bhashya]]''''' is a [[Gaudiya Vaishnavism|Gaudiya Vaishnava]] commentary on [[Vedanta Sutra]]. It was written in the year 1628 Sakabda (1718 CE) at [[Galtaji]] (Galta) near the present city of [[Jaipur]], [[Rajasthan]], by [[Baladeva Vidyabhushana]] to defend [[Gaudiya Vaishnava Theology]].

==Govinda Bhashya: Gaudiya Vaishnava commentary on Vedanta==
Around this time (1718 CE), a branch of the Sri ([[Ramanuja]]) [[Sampradaya]] known as the [[Ramanandi sect]], in the court of the king Sadacari Raja at [[Jaipur]], [[Rajasthan]], complained that since the Gaudiya Vaisnavas had no commentary on the [[Vedanta Sutra]], they were not qualified to worship the Deity and therefore the worship should be turned over to the Sri Sampradaya. They also objected to the worship of Srimati [[Radharani]] along with Sri [[Krishna]] as not being authorised anywhere in the [[shastra]]s.

The king was initiated within the Gaudiya sampradaya and he sent word to Vrindavana, informing the devotees what had happened. At that time Srila [[Visvanatha Chakravarti]] was very aged so in his place he sent his student, Sri Baladeva. In a great assembly he posed such forceful arguments to the followers of Ramanuja that they could not reply to them. He further explained: "The originator of the Gaudiya Vaisnava sampradaya, Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, has accepted [[Bhagavata Purana|Srimad Bhagavatam]] as the natural commentary on the Vedanta-sutra, as composed by Srila Vyasadeva Himself. This is proven in the [[Sat-sandarbhas]]."

The scholars in the assembly, however, refused to accept anything other than a direct commentary on the sutra. Having no other recourse, Baladeva promised to present them with one.

Feeling very aggrieved, Sri Baladeva came to Sri [[Govindaji]]'s mandira (temple) and informed Sri Govinda of everything that had happened. That night the Lord appeared to him in a dream and instructed him to write a commentary on the Vedanta-sutra: "I will dictate to you what to write and therefore no one will be able to refuse to accept it."

Thus Baladeva began to write, and within a few days completed the commentary which was titled 'Sri Govinda Bhashya'. It convinced the Ramanandi scholars and they bestowed upon Sri Baladeva the title 'Vidyabhushana' ('ornament of knowledge ([[vidya]])').

They expressed their desire to accept initiation from Sri Baladeva Vidyabhushana. However, he declined their request by stating that amongst the four authorized sampradayas, the Sri sampradaya was highly respectable and the foremost adherent of dasya-bhakti (devotion in servitorship). If there was any cause of loss of respect to the sampradaya this might be considered an offense.

An English translation of this text was presented by Rai Bahadur [[Srisa Chandra Vasu]] in 1916.

The 2000 census reported 27,839 residents of [[Switzerland]] self-identifying as [[Hindu]]s (0.38% of the total population; 1.11% in [[Berne]], 1% in [[Zurich]], 0.27% in Geneva).

In earlier censuses, Hinduism figured together with other non-Abrahamic traditions (mainly [[Buddhism]]) as "other churches and communities". These accounted for 0.12% in 1970, 0.19% in 1980, 0.42% in 1990 and 0.78% in 2000 (0.38% Hinduism, 0.29% Buddhism, 0.11% other). Hinduism overtook Judaism as the third largest religion in Switzerland (after Christianity and Islam) during the 1990s and was tied at 0.38% with the [[New Apostolic Church]] in 2000.

According to the [[Pew Research Center]] in 2010, there were 50 Muslim-majority countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/06/22/what-is-each-countrys-second-largest-religious-group/|title=What is each country‚Äôs second-largest religious group?}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pewmuslim5"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pewforum.org/future-of-the-global-muslim-population-muslim-majority.aspx |title=Muslim-Majority Countries |work=The Future of the Global Muslim Population |publisher=Pew Research Center |accessdate=22 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around 62% of the world's Muslims live in the Asia-Pacific region (from Turkey to Indonesia), with over 1&amp;nbsp;billion adherents.&lt;ref name="pewmuslim6"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pewforum.org/future-of-the-global-muslim-population-regional-asia.aspx |title=Region: Asia-Pacific |work=The Future of the Global Muslim Population |publisher=Pew Research Center |accessdate=22 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest Muslim population in a country is in Indonesia, a nation home to 12.7% of the world's Muslims, followed by Pakistan (11.0%), and India (10.9%).&lt;ref name="pewmuslim12" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Islam_by_country"&gt;{{cite web

About 20% of Muslims live in [[Arab world|Arab countries]].&lt;ref&gt;See:
* Esposito (2002b), p.21
* Esposito (2004), pp.2,43&lt;/ref&gt; In the Middle East, the non-Arab countries of Iran and [[Turkey]] are the largest Muslim-majority countries; in Africa, [[Egypt]] and [[Nigeria]] have the most populous Muslim communities.&lt;ref name="pewmuslim12" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Islam_by_country" /&gt;  The study found more Muslims in the [[United Kingdom]] than in [[Lebanon]] and more in [[China]] than in [[Syria]]. Indian state of [[Uttar Pradesh]] has more Muslims than all the other Muslim majority countries except Indonesia, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Egypt, Iran and Turkey.&lt;ref name="pewmuslim12" /&gt;

==Countries==
Most of the percentages of Muslim populations of each country, if not stated otherwise, were taken from the study by the [[Pew Research Center]] report of ''The Future of the Global Muslim Population'', as of 27 January 2011.&lt;ref name="pewmuslim12" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pewmuslim7"&gt;{{citation|url=http://pewforum.org/future-of-the-global-muslim-population-preface.aspx|title=Preface|work=The Future of the Global Muslim Population|publisher=Pew Research Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the near-100% figures are likely overestimates as many of those same countries have laws against blasphemy and/or apostasy, punishable by prison or even death&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://freethoughtreport.com/countries/|title=Blog - Freedom of Thought Report|website=Freedom of Thought Report|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;. As such, there is a strong incentive for irreligious poll respondents to lie.

[[File:Jedi census phenomenon 2001.pdf|thumb|A 2001 map of Jedi census phenomenon's effect in England and Wales]]

The '''Jedi census phenomenon''' is a [[grassroots]] movement that was initiated in 2001 for residents of a number of [[English-speaking countries]], urging them to record their [[religion]] as "[[Jedi]]" or "Jedi Knight" (after the quasi-religious order of Jedi Knights in the fictional ''[[Star Wars]]'' [[fictional universe|universe]]) on the national [[census]].

==Impact==

===Australia===
In [[Australia]] more than 70,000 people (0.37%) declared themselves members of the Jedi order in the 2001 census.&lt;ref name="smh"/&gt; The [[Australian Bureau of Statistics]] issued an official press release&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.abs.gov.au/websitedbs/D3110124.NSF/0/86429d11c45d4e73ca256a400006af80?OpenDocument| title=Census of Population and Housing&amp;nbsp;‚Äî The 2001 Census, Religion and the Jedi| publisher=Australian Bureau of Statistics| accessdate=2006-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; in response to media interest on the subject. The ABS announced that any answers that were Jedi-related in the religion question were to be classified as "not defined" and stressed the social impact of making misleading or false statements on the census. An ABS spokesperson said that "further analysis of census responses has been undertaken since the release of census data on June 17 to separately identify the number of Jedi-related responses".&lt;ref name="smh"&gt;{{cite news | title= May the farce be with you | url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2002/08/27/1030053053578.html | accessdate=26 March 2006 | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | date=27 August 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It is believed that there is no numerical value that determines a religion per definition of the ABS, but there would need to be a belief system or philosophy as well as some form of institutional or organisational structure in place.&lt;ref name="snopes"&gt;{{cite web | title=snopes | url=http://www.snopes.com/religion/jedi.htm | accessdate=7 August 2006 }}{{Dead link|date=June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The push for Australians to declare themselves as members of the Jedi order was one of the first examples of a concept going "[[viral phenomenon|viral]]" on the internet in Australia. The website which was set up to promote the concept was visited over 100,000 times in a five-week period and was first archived by the [[Wayback Machine]] on 21 October 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010415000000*/http://geocities.com/ausjedi |title=Internet Archive Wayback Machine |work=archive.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2006 census recorded 58,053 Jedi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.smh.com.au/opinion/politics/portrait-of-a-nation-squid-jiggers-and-all-20110805-1ifgc.html | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | title=Portrait of a nation, squid jiggers and all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/opinion/be-counted-to-fulfil-your-destiny/story-e6frfhqf-1226106206036|title=Be counted to fulfil your destiny|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2011 census, the numbers listing their faith as Jedi had picked up from the 2006 census to 65,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/world/lachlan-murdoch-with-rupert-on-scientology-being-weird-cult-20120704-21ggy.html|title=Lachlan Murdoch with Rupert on Scientology being 'weird cult'|work=The Sydney Morning Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/lateline/content/2012/s3536106.htm|title=Lateline - 29/06/2012: Scientology membership in drastic decline|work=abc.net.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jedi Census phenomenon attracted the attention of [[Sociology of religion|sociologist of religion]] [[Adam Possamai]] who discusses it in his book ''Religion and Popular Culture: A Hyper-Real Testament''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peterlang.com/index.cfm?event=cmp.ccc.seitenstruktur.detailseiten&amp;seitentyp=produkt&amp;pk=14609&amp;concordeid=29272 |title=Religion and Popular Culture |work=peterlang.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715065820/http://www.peterlang.com/index.cfm?event=cmp.ccc.seitenstruktur.detailseiten&amp;seitentyp=produkt&amp;pk=14609&amp;concordeid=29272 |archivedate=2011-07-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Possamai‚Äôs study placed Jediism in the context of a specific [[Methodology|methodological]] classification (‚Äòhyper-real religions‚Äô) and attempted to demonstrate that hostility existed towards [[New religious movement|new religions]] in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ashgate.com/default.aspx?page=637&amp;calctitle=1&amp;pageSubject=542&amp;title_id=8972&amp;edition_id=12007 Invented Religions: Imagination, Fiction and Faith] - Carol Cusack (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the lead-up to the 2006 census, there were reports that writing Jedi on the 2006 census could lead to a fine for providing "false or misleading" information. This is despite previous admissions by the ABS that they were "fairly relaxed" about the issue in 2001 and that nobody had been prosecuted in at least 15 years.&lt;ref name="smh2006"&gt;{{cite news | title= Come to your census - no kidding, they're serious|  url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/come-to-your-census/2006/08/08/1154802890319.html | accessdate=29 August 2006 | date=9 August 2006 | work=The Sydney Morning Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the lead-up to the 2016 census, there was a push from atheists warning not to use Jedi, imploring that it could be counted as being religious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/atheists-urge-australians-not-to-joke-around-by-putting-jedi-as-their-religion-on-the-census-20160729-gqgqx4.html|title=Atheists urge Australians not to joke around by putting Jedi as their religion on the census|first=Matthew|last=Knott|date=30 July 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
In the 2001 census, 21,000 Canadians put down their religion as Jedi Knight.  This fact was referenced by the prime minister's office as a rationale for making the 40-page long census form voluntary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://westernstandard.blogs.com/shotgun/2010/07/does-canada-lead-the-world-in-jedi-knights.html |title=The Shotgun: Does Canada lead the world in Jedi knights? |publisher=Westernstandard.blogs.com |date=2010-07-18 |accessdate=2011-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2011 National Household Survey the number fell to 9,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=National Household Survey: Number of ‚ÄòJedi Knights‚Äô in Canada dwindling |author=Ben Makuch and Steve Rennie|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2013/05/08/national_household_survey_number_of_jedi_knights_in_canada_dwindling.html |newspaper=Toronto Star| agency=The Canadian Press |date=May 8, 2013 |accessdate=8 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Croatia===
In the 2011 census, 303 Croats put Jedi as their religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dnevnik.hr/vijesti/hrvatska/u-rh-zivi-vise-jugoslavena-nego-hercegovaca-broj-jedi-vitezova-nepoznat.html|title=U RH ≈æivi 20 Klingonaca i 24 Marsovca!|author=D.M.|work=Dnevnik.hr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Czech Republic===
The 2011 census preliminarily recorded 15,070 people answering the voluntary question on religion as belonging to the Jedi religion, described by the Czech Statistics Office as "the moral values of the Jedi knights". The office noted that this is an international phenomenon. As the 2011 census form did not list religions, these having to be filled out, the total number of Jedi is not artificially boosted by those who were not aware of the phenomenon prior to filling out the census form. On the other hand, many people encouraged others in discussions and then media to fill the Jedi religion prior 2011 census (as a form of protest against range, overall cost and obligatory filling of the census), which is probably the cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zpravy.idnes.cz/pri-scitani-uvedme-viru-z-hvezdnych-valek-vyzyvaji-se-lide-na-internetu-1as-/domaci.aspx?c=A110127_141219_domaci_hv|title=P≈ôi sƒç√≠t√°n√≠ uveƒème v√≠ru z Hvƒõzdn√Ωch v√°lek, vyz√Ωvaj√≠ se lid√© na internetu|trans-title=In census let's declare the faith in Star Wars call people on the Internet|date=2011-01-27|accessdate=2011-12-16|language=Czech}}&lt;/ref&gt; The highest number of Jedi were recorded to live in Prague.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.czso.cz/sldb2011/redakce.nsf/i/predbezne_vysledky_scitani_lidu_domu_a_bytu_2011 |title=P≈ôedbƒõ≈æn√© v√Ωsledky Sƒç√≠t√°n√≠ lid≈Ø, dom≈Ø a byt≈Ø 2011 |trans-title=Preliminary results of the Census and Housing 2011 |date= |accessdate=2011-12-15 |language=Czech |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120104161044/http://czso.cz/sldb2011/redakce.nsf/i/predbezne_vysledky_scitani_lidu_domu_a_bytu_2011 |archivedate=2012-01-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ireland===
In a May 2012 review of the 2011 census, the [[D√°il]] Public Accounts Committee asked the [[Central Statistics Office (Ireland)|Central Statistics Office]] about the reliability of self-reported answers, instancing people listing Jedi as their religion. The response was "We could probably tell you the number of people who have declared themselves as such, but we don't publish it".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.breakingnews.ie/ireland/dail-committee-ponders-existence-of-jedi-knights-550110.html|title=D√°il committee ponders existence of Jedi knights|date=3 May 2012|work=BreakingNews|accessdate=4 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://thedailyedge.thejournal.ie/a-td-wants-to-know-how-many-jedi-knights-are-there-in-ireland-438677-May2012/|title=A TD wants to know: How many Jedi Knights are there in Ireland?|last=Reilly|first=Gavan|date=3 May 2012|work=The Daily Edge|publisher=thejournal.ie|accessdate=4 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://debates.oireachtas.ie/ACC/2012/05/03/00004.asp#N178 |title=Vote 4 - Central Statistics Office |date=3 May 2012 |work=Committee of Public Accounts proceedings |publisher=Oireachtas |accessdate=10 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 2016 census results list all religions receiving more than 30 responses, including 2,050 under "Jedi Knight".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cso.ie/px/pxeirestat/Statire/SelectVarVal/Define.asp?maintable=EY036&amp;PLanguage=0|title=Y036: Actual and Percentage Change in Population Usually Resident and Present 2011 to 2016 by Sex, Religion, CensusYear and Statistic|year=2017|work=Census 2016|publisher=[[Central Statistics Office (Ireland)|Central Statistics Office]]|accessdate=20 April 2017|location=Cork}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/census-finds-2000-devotees-to-star-wars-jedi-religion-35634436.html|title=Census finds 2,000 devotees to Star Wars 'Jedi' religion |last=Bray|first=Allison|date=19 April 2017|work=[[Irish Independent]]|accessdate=20 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Montenegro===
In the 2011 census in [[Montenegro]], a group of young men declared themselves as "Jedi" on the ethnicity question, as they believe that ethnicity should not be an issue today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.b92.net/eng/news/region-article.php?yyyy=2011&amp;mm=04&amp;dd=07&amp;nav_id=73677 |title=News - Montenegro's Jedi minority attracts attention |publisher=B92 |date= |accessdate=2011-06-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110410040123/http://www.b92.net/eng/news/region-article.php?yyyy=2011&amp;mm=04&amp;dd=07&amp;nav_id=73677 |archivedate=2011-04-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Zealand===
Over 53,000 people listed themselves as Jedi in [[New Zealand]]'s 2001 census. New Zealand had the highest per capita population of reported Jedi in the world that year, with 1.5% marking "Jedi" as their religion. The city of [[Dunedin]] had the highest population of reported Jedi per capita.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=2352142| title=Jedi Order lures 53,000 disciples| publisher=New Zealand Herald| date=2002-08-31| first=Alan| last=Perrott| accessdate=2006-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Statistics New Zealand]] treated Jedi responses as "Answer understood, but will not be counted". The percentages of religious affiliations were:
* [[Christian]]: 58.9%
* [[irreligion|No religion]]: 29.6%
* Object to answering: 6.9%
* [[Jedi]]: 1.5%
* [[Buddhism]]: 1.2%
* [[Hindu]]: 1.2%
There was a fall in the number of New Zealand Jedi five years later, with some 20,000 people giving this as their religion in the 2006 census. It is unknown whether the numbers have continued to fall as the 2011 census was not completed due to an earthquake in Christchurch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://norightturn.blogspot.com/2006/12/fate-of-jedi.html| title=The fate of the Jedi| publisher=No Right Turn| date=2006-12-08| accessdate=2007-09-16 |quote=A story in the Dominion-Post [http://www.stuff.co.nz/stuff/0,2106,3892378a11,00.html has the answer]: '...&amp;nbsp;census general manager Nancy McBeth told The Dominion Post there were more than 20,200 followers of the force&amp;nbsp;‚Äî down from 54,000 in 2001.'}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Serbia===
In 2012, it was reported that 640 Serbs had identified as Jedi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nadlanu.com/pocetna/info/vesti/Popis-Sve-manje-Srba-sve-vise-vanzemaljaca-teletabisa-Strumpfova.a-159350.295.html|title=Popis: Sve manje Srba, sve vi≈°e vanzemaljaca, teletabisa, ≈†trumpfova|language=sr|trans-title=List: Fewer Serbs, more aliens, Teletubbies, Smurfs|date=30 November 2012|quote=There are 640 Jedi, while there are 268 Martians.

===Turkey===

On April 6, 2015, thousands of Turkish students raised their voices in campaigns to build Jedi and Buddhist temples at their universities, after a series of mosques were constructed on their campuses by rectors who stressed "huge demand."&lt;ref name="hurriyetdailynews.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/turkish-university-students-demand-jedi-buddhist-temples-amid-mosque-frenzy.aspx?pageID=238&amp;nID=80634&amp;NewsCatID=341|title=Turkish university students demand Jedi, Buddhist temples amid mosque frenzy - LOCAL|work=hurriyetdailynews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of [[Dokuz Eyl√ºl University]] students in the western province of [[Izmir]] have demanded a Jedi temple to be built on their campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/thousands-turkish-students-demand-jedi-and-buddhist-temples-campus-320413|title=Thousands of Turkish Students Demand Jedi Temples On Campus|date=7 April 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "There are less and less Jedi left on the Earth... the nearest temple [is] billions of light years away," the petition says. It adds that "uneducated [[Jedi Padawan|Padawan]]" are moving to the [[Dark side (Star Wars)|dark side]]... To recruit new Jedi and to bring balance to the Force, we want a Jedi temple," said the petition that received more than 6,000 signatures on change.org, referring to the famed knights of the fictional ''Star Wars'' universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/04/08/europe/jedi-temple-turkey/|title=Turkish students petition for Jedi temple  - CNN.com|author=Mairi Mackay, for CNN|date=8 April 2015|work=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt; The page on Change.org also features a still of Jedi Grand Master Yoda from ''Star Wars: Episode II -- Attack of the Clones'' teaching young Jedi how to use a light saber.  The petition was started by Akin Cagatay Caliskan, an 18-year-old computer science student from Ankara: "We want freedom of worship. There are mosques everywhere, but no [[Jedi temple]]!"  Caliskan says he is surprised by the impact his petition has made: "I did not expect so many supporters. I thought maybe it might (have) 100."&lt;ref name="hurriyetdailynews.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dailycaller.com/2015/04/08/turkish-students-demand-jedi-buddhist-temples-alongside-campus-mosques/|title=Turkish Students Demand Jedi, Buddhist Temples Alongside Mosques - The Daily Caller|work=The Daily Caller}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/turkey-students-demand-jedi-buddhist-temples-after-surge-mosques-university-campuses-1495319|title=Turkey: Students demand Jedi temples after surge of mosques on university campuses|author=Ludovica Iaccino|work=International Business Times UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europe.newsweek.com/thousands-turkish-students-demand-jedi-and-buddhist-temples-campus-320413|title=Thousands of Turkish Students Demand Jedi Temples On Campus|date=7 April 2015|work=Newsweek}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rt.com/news/247753-turkey-jedi-buddhist-temples/|title=Build Jedi, Buddhist temples next to mosques in Turkish universities, students say|work=RT English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
====England and Wales====
In [[England and Wales]] 390,127 people (almost 0.8%) stated their religion as Jedi on their 2001 Census forms, surpassing [[Sikhism]], [[Judaism]], and [[Buddhism]], and making it the fourth largest reported religion in the country.&lt;ref name="nationalstatistics"&gt;{{cite web | title=Ethnicity and Religion: 'Jedi' | work=Census 2001| url=http://www.statistics.gov.uk/census2001/profiles/rank/jedi.asp/ | accessdate=20 November 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2001 Census, 2.6% of the population of [[Brighton]] claimed to be Jedi. The percentages of religious affiliations were:
* [[Christian]]: 70%
* [[Irreligion|No religion]]: 16%
* Chose not to respond: 7.8%
* [[Muslim]]: 3.1%
* [[Hindu]]: 2.1%
* [[Jedi]]: 0.7%

It was confirmed prior to the census that citizens were not liable for a fine in relation to question 10 (on religion).&lt;ref name="register"&gt;{{cite web | work=theregister.co.uk | title=UK Jedi get green light | url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2001/04/23/uk_jedi_get_green_light/ | accessdate=26 March 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was based on section 1(2) of the [[Census (Amendment) Act 2000]],&lt;ref name="englishact"&gt;{{cite web | work=opsi.gov.uk | title=Census (Amendment) Act 2000 | url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/24/contents | accessdate=14 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which amended section 8 of the Census Act 2000 to state that "no person shall be liable to a penalty under subsection (1) for refusing or neglecting to state any particulars in respect of religion". The change in the law was implemented by The Census (Amendment) Order 2000&lt;ref name="englishorder"&gt;{{cite web | work=opsi.gov.uk | title=The Census (Amendment) Order 2000 | url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2000/3249/contents/made | accessdate=14 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and The Census (Amendment) Regulations 2000.&lt;ref name="englishregs"&gt;{{cite web | work=opsi.gov.uk | title=The Census (Amendment) Regulations 2000 | url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2000/3351/contents/made | accessdate=14 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jedi was assigned its own code in the United Kingdom for census processing, the number 896.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Census of Population and Housing&amp;nbsp;‚Äî The 2001 Census, Religion and the Jedi| url=http://www.statistics.gov.uk/census2001/pdfs/section5part3.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Officials from the [[Office for National Statistics]] pointed out that this merely means that it has been registered as a common answer to the "religion" question and that this does not confer on it the status of official recognition. John Pullinger, Director of Reporting and Analysis for the Census, noted that many people who would otherwise not have completed a Census form did so solely to record themselves as Jedi, so this joke helped to improve the quality of the Census. The Office for National Statistics revealed the total figure in a press release entitled "390,000 Jedi there are".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/census/census-2001-summary-theme-figures-and-rankings/390-000-jedis-there-are/jedi.html|title=Census 2001 Summary theme figures and rankings - 390,000 Jedi There Are|work=ons.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2005, [[Jamie Reed]], newly elected [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Copeland (UK Parliament constituency)|Copeland]] in [[Cumbria]], declared himself to be the first Jedi Member of Parliament during his [[maiden speech]].&lt;ref name="jamiereed"&gt;{{cite web | work=publications.parliament.uk | title=House of Commons Hansard Debates for 21 June 2005| url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo050621/debtext/50621-24.htm#50621-24_spnew3 | accessdate=20 March 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The statement, made in the context of an ongoing debate regarding the [[Racial and Religious Hatred Act 2006|Incitement to Religious Hatred Bill]], was confirmed by Reed's office to be a joke instead of a serious statement of faith. During a subsequent committee debate on the bill, the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] Member of Parliament for [[Beaconsfield (UK Parliament constituency)|Beaconsfield]], [[Dominic Grieve]], proposed as "a bit of a joke" to exclude Jedi Knights from the protection of the proposed act, along with [[Satanist]]s and proponents of [[animal sacrifice]], illustrating the difficulty of defining religious belief in legislation.&lt;ref name="parldebate"&gt;{{cite web | work=publications.parliament.uk | title=Racial and Religious Hatred Bill: Standing Committee Debates | url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmstand/e/st050629/pm/50629s01.htm | accessdate=14 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in April 2006, [[Edward Leigh]], the Conservative Member of Parliament for [[Gainsborough (UK Parliament constituency)|Gainsborough]], asked whether he would be allowed to set up a Jedi knights faith school during a Committee debate on the Education and Inspections Bill.&lt;ref name="parldebate1"&gt;{{cite web | work=publications.parliament.uk | title=Education and Inspections Bill: Standing Committee Debates | url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmstand/e/st060420/pm/60420s10.htm | accessdate=14 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 November 2006, two Jedi delivered a protest letter to UN officials in recognition of the [[International Day for Tolerance]]. The letter, written by [[Simon Cohen]] of the Global Tolerance public relations agency,&lt;ref name="GT letter"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.northampton.ac.uk/news/jedi-knights-global-tolerance-and-a-1million-giveaway-simon-cohen-shares-it-all-as-part-of-refreshers2016/|date=18 January 2016|website=University of Northampton|title=Jedi Knights, global tolerance and a 1million pound giveaway}}&lt;/ref&gt; requested that it be renamed the "UN Interstellar Day of Tolerance" and cited the 2001 Census showing 390,000 Jedi in England and Wales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Jedi demand Britain's fourth largest 'religion' receives recognition | url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-416761/Jedi-Knights-demand-Britains-fourth-largest-religion-receives-recognition.html | location=London | work=Daily Mail | date=16 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to 2011 census figures, the number of Jedi had fallen to 176,632, placing it in seventh place, having been overtaken by Judaism and Buddhism, but still comfortably outnumbering any other alternative or mock religions.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/census/2011-census/key-statistics-for-local-authorities-in-england-and-wales/rft-table-qs210ew.xls&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine ''[[Metal Hammer]]'' also encouraged readers to mark "Heavy Metal" as their religion, leading to over 6,000 responses.&lt;ref name="census2011"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/religion/9737886/Jedi-religion-most-popular-alternative-faith.html |title='Jedi' religion most popular alternative faith |last=Taylor |first=Henry |date=2012-12-11 |accessdate=2012-12-13 |publisher=''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Scotland====
In [[Scotland]], 14,052 people stated that Jedi was their current religion (14,014 "Jedi", 24 "Jedi Order" and 14 "Sith") and 2,733 stated that it was their religion of upbringing (2,682 "Jedi", 36 "Jedi Order" and 15 "The Dark Side") in the 2001 census.&lt;ref name="scottishbreakdown"&gt;{{cite web | work=scottishpf.org | title=The Pagan Federation (Scotland): Complete data for the: Q13 'Another Religion' (Current Religion) and Q14 'Another Religion' (Religion of Upbringing) write-in boxes, Scottish Census of 2001| url=http://www.scottishpf.org/data.html | accessdate=14 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The proportion of people stating their religion as Jedi in Scotland was lower than that in England and Wales, at 0.277%.&lt;ref name="scottishpercentage"&gt;{{cite web | work=scotland.gov.uk | title=Analysis of Religion in the 2001 Census: Summary Report| url=http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2005/02/20757/53576 | accessdate=14 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2009, it became known that eight police officers serving with Scotland's largest police force, Strathclyde, listed their official religion as Jedi in voluntary diversity forms. The details were obtained in a Freedom of Information request by ''[[Jane's Police Review]]''.&lt;ref name="Strathclyde"&gt;{{cite news | title=Force is strong for Jedi police | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/glasgow_and_west/8003067.stm | accessdate=2009-04-18  | work=BBC News | date=16 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
The Australian Atheist Foundation objects to non-religious individuals answering with any joke answer, because this would lead to a census undercount of non-religious people, and lessen their political influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://censusnoreligion.org/ |title=Atheist Foundation of Australia - Mark NO Religion |publisher=Censusnoreligion.org |date= |accessdate=2011-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kafa'ah''' or '''Kafaah''' ({{lang-ar|ÿßŸÑŸÉŸÅÿßÿ°ÿ©}}; ''{{transl|ar|ALA|al-kafƒÅ'a·∏•}}'') is a term used in the field of [[Fiqh|Islamic jurisprudence]] with regard to [[marriage in Islam]], which in [[Arabic]], literally means, ''equality'' or ''equivalence''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://islamicencyclopedia.org/public/islamic-discussions/index.php?p=/discussion/520/kafaah-%D9%83%D9%8E%D9%81%D8%A7%D8%A6%D9%8E%D8%A9|title=Kafaah ŸÉŸéŸÅÿßÿ¶Ÿéÿ© - Islamic Encyclopedia|website=islamicencyclopedia.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=IfIyAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA149&amp;lpg=PA149&amp;dq=kafaah+encyclopedia&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=OlctPfb2KX&amp;sig=phytebw6oDomN0E6XGFshISVUIo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj16dK11YXZAhXD8qQKHas3A0QQ6AEIOTAE#v=onepage&amp;q=kafaah+encyclopedia&amp;f=false|title=The Lineaments of Islam: Studies in Honor of Fred McGraw Donner|first=Paul|last=Cobb|date=22 June 2012|publisher=BRILL|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is thus defined as the compatibility or equivalence between a prospective husband and his prospective wife which should be adhered to.&lt;ref name="awakening" /&gt; This compatibility is dependent on multiple factors that include religion, social status, morality, piety, wealth, lineage or custom.&lt;ref name="kafaah"&gt;{{cite book| url=https://archive.org/details/leqaaashr| title= ÿßŸÑŸÉŸÅÿßÿßÿ© ŸÅŸä ÿßŸÑŸÜŸÉÿßÿ≠ (Kafa'ah in Marriage)| author= ÿπÿ®ÿØ ÿßŸÑÿ≥ÿ™ÿßÿ± ÿßÿ®Ÿà ÿ∫ÿØŸëŸá (Abdul Sattaar Abu Ghuddah) | publisher=Daarul Basharail Islamiyah| location=Beirut| year=2002| language=ar}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Sayyids and Sharifs in Muslim Societies|last = Kazuo|first = Morimoto|publisher = Routledge|year = 2012|isbn = 978-0-415-51917-5|pages = 79, 87, 91|url = https://books.google.com.sg/books?id=5VnmEMh0MF4C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal Rulings ==
Islamic scholars ([[Ulema|ulama]]) hold differing opinions and arguments on the doctrine of Kafa'ah based on the [[Quran]] and [[Hadith]]. What is consistently agreed upon by the four [[Sunni]] [[Madhab]]s is the compatibility of religion. Muslim women can thus marry only Muslim men, but Muslim men are also permitted to marry Jewish or Christian women. In [[Shia|Shia Islam,]] there is no concept of Kafa'ah on the basis of lineage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.saffar.org/?act=artc&amp;id=950| script-title=ar:ÿßŸÑŸÉŸÅÿßÿ°ÿ© ŸÅŸä ÿßŸÑÿ≤Ÿàÿßÿ¨ |language=ar| accessdate=June 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media| url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6KAZy1oUUU| script-title=ar:ÿßŸÑŸÅÿ±ŸÇ ÿ®ŸäŸÜ ÿßŸÑÿ¥Ÿäÿπÿ© ŸàÿßŸÑÿ≥ŸÜÿ© ŸÅŸä ÿßÿπÿ™ÿ®ÿßÿ± ŸÉŸÅÿßÿ°ÿ© ÿßŸÑÿ≤Ÿàÿ¨  |language=ar | accessdate=June 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Hanafi Position ===
According to the traditional [[Hanafi]] [[Madhhab|school of thought]], kafa'ah represents a special proportionality between a man and a woman in marriage.

=== The Maliki Position ===
The traditional [[Maliki]] position states that kafa'ah is the proportionality in religion for both husband and wife who are not in disgrace so it allows the woman to exercise rights to decide her marriage.

=== The ShƒÅfi'i Position ===
According to the [[Shafi'i|ShƒÅfi'i]] school of thought, kafa'ah concerns the factors of lineage, religiousness, profession, and being free of defects that permit annulling the marriage contract ([[nikah]]).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Reliance of the Traveller|last = ibn Naqib al-Misri|first = Ahmad|publisher = Amana Publications|year = 1994|isbn = 0-915957-72-8|pages = 523‚Äì524; [m4.0]-[m.4.5]|editor-last = Nuh Ha Mim Keller}}&lt;/ref&gt; It must not be misunderstood as a recommendation of whom to marry. Rather, it should be taken as a legal restriction to protect a woman's interest in her marriage.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; If a woman wishes to marry someone who is seemingly incompatible based these factors, there is nothing wrong in her doing so.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Accordingly, an Arab woman should not marry a non-Arab man; similarly, a virtuous woman should not marry a corrupt man, (though it is sufficient should the husband give up his wrongdoing).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; A daughter of someone with a higher profession should not marry a man of a lowly profession.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The wealth of either parties is not a factor to be considered, as it is merely temporary and "those with self-respect and intelligence do not take pride in it."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== The Hanbali Position ===
Scholars of the [[Hanbali]] school of thought state that kafa'ah represents the similarities and proportionality based on five factors, namely, religion, lineage, independence, jobs and wealth.&lt;ref name="kafaah" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://benmashoor.wordpress.com/2008/12/22/pengertian-kafa%E2%80%99ah/| author=ben Mashhoor, Idrus| title=Pengertian Kafa‚Äôah| language=id|accessdate=June 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Objectives ==
The main goal of Kafa'ah is to make a peaceful and lasting marriage. The argument is that a household built based on the common perceptions, equivalent views, and understandings would make a peaceful and happy marriage. However, if such a rationale is to be accepted, it begs the question as to why these restrictions only apply to a prospective wife and not the husband.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; An objective more congruous with the legal rulings would be to protect the interests of the prospective wife by ensuring that she is not in disgrace in her conjugal bond. This however, raises the question as to why it would be a disgrace for an Arab woman to marry a non-Arab man.

== The Hadhrami Controversy ==

=== Social Stratification Between Sayyids and Non-Sayyids ===
The controversies associated with the doctrine of kafa'ah were exemplified in a chain of events which occurred in [[Hadhramaut]], [[Yemen]], in 1905. People of the [[Ba 'Alawi sada]], especially of [[Hadhrami people|Hadhrami]] descent, adhered to a stricter and more rigid system of social stratification based on the kafa'ah of descent. In particular, a [[Sayyid]] woman is prohibited from marrying a non-Sayyid man.&lt;ref name="awakening"&gt;{{cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=c45Xvsq2q4UC&amp;pg=PA95&amp;dq=kafa%27ah&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=FXqoU8itAtjdoASbmYKoDg&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=kafa'ah&amp;f=false|title = The Hadrami Awakening: Community and Identity in the Netherlands East Indies, 1900-1942|first = Natalie|last = Mobini-Kesheh|edition = illustrated|publisher = SEAP Publications|year = 1999|pages = 94‚Äì96, 98|isbn = 978-0-8772-7727-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; It must be noted, however, that this extreme position is absent in the canon of orthodox ShƒÅfi'i scholarship, the school to which the Hadramis otherwise adhered.&lt;ref name="awakening" /&gt; Controversy erupted when a number of marriages between Sayyid women and non-Sayyid men were publicly discovered, which thus became a subject of public condemnation and clamour because of their perceived unsuitability.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== The Dissent by Rashid Rida and Ahmad S≈´kartƒ´ ===
In response to the heated controversy, an Islamic reformer by the name of [[Rashid Rida]] argued that such marriages were valid and permissible, in his journal ''al-ManƒÅr'' in Egypt.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There was nothing in Islamic law, as he argued, that prohibited marriages between Sayyid women and non-Sayyid men.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Rida's views were echoed by [[Ahmad Surkati]], who wrote a pamphlet in 1915 titled ''Surah al-JawƒÅb'' (The Form of the Answer) in permitting such marriages based on the principle of equality.&lt;ref name="awakening" /&gt; According to Surkati, kafa'ah should be restricted to the rationale of ensuring a good relationship between the partners; accordingly, if a woman decides to marry someone seemingly inferior, because "of other such qualities which please women", she is allowed to do so.&lt;ref name="awakening" /&gt;

It must be stressed again that the traditional Hadhrami interpretation of kafa'ah (in restricting marriage between Sayyid women and non-Sayyid men) is not found in the canon of orthodox Islamic scholarship.&lt;ref name="awakening" /&gt; The arguments promulgated by Rida and S≈´kartƒ´ are thus merely a defense of traditional Islamic scholarship as much as they are a rejection of Hadhrami societal attitudes determined by self-interest.&lt;ref name="awakening" /&gt;

=== Rebuttal by Sayyid Umar al-Attas ===
These arguments, however, were strongly rebutted by Sayyids, one of whom was Sayyid Umar al-Attas, a leading Hadhrami scholar residing in [[Singapore]], who declared such marriages to be unlawful. In doing so, he identified four levels of compatibility based on descent (which always applies for women and not for men, ''i.e.,'' a man can marry someone from a lower rank, but a woman cannot): Arabs must not marry non-Arabs, Qurashƒ´s must not marry non-Qurashƒ´s, HƒÅshimites must not marry non-HƒÅshimites, and descendants of Hasan and Husayn must not marry anyone other than other Hasanids and Husaynids.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In his book published in 1905, ''The Marriage Between A Sharifah and A Non-Sharif and Esteemed Position of Ahl al-Bayt'', he concluded that it is impermissible for a Sayyid woman to marry a non-Sayyid man, even if it is based on her own desires or with the consent of her wali.&lt;ref name="surkati"&gt;{{cite paper| format=thesis| url=http://digitool.library.mcgill.ca/webclient/StreamGate?folder_id=0&amp;dvs=1404950374608~334| title=Ahmad Surkati: His role in al-Irshad movement in Java| first=Bisri| last=Affandi| publisher=McGill University | location=Montreal | date=March 1976| pages=52‚Äì54}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, AbdullƒÅh Da·∏•lƒÅn attacked Surkati's stance that all humans were equal, arguing instead that God had created some humans like the Prophet's family as superior to others. The dispute quickly deteriorated into racist diatribes. Da·∏•lƒÅn reportedly remarked about Sukarti, "''Will the Negro stand corrected of his saying or persist in his stubbornness?''" Other Hadhrami Sayyids insulted Sukarti by calling him "the black death", "black slave", "the black", "the Sudanese" or "the Negro", all while claiming that he could not speak Arabic and that he was a non-Arab.&lt;ref name="awakening" /&gt;

=== Consequences ===
The far-reaching consequences of this heated discussion went beyond the doctrine of kafa'ah and sparked a power struggle in Hadhramƒ´ communities in [[Southeast Asia|South East Asia]]. People began to openly question the rigid system of social stratification dominated by the Sayyids, their status and privileges.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="awakening" /&gt; Some of the practices that became publicly contentious include the custom of [[taqbil]] (kissing the hands of Sayyids), and the exclusive use of the title, "Sayyid" itself.&lt;ref name="awakening" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2552">'''Kawus ibn Kharakhuruh''' was the ruler ([[Sogdian language|Sogdian]]: ''[[afshin]]'') of the [[Principality of Ushrusana]] during the 9th-century. He was the son and successor of [[Kharakhuruh]].

== Biography ==
Kawus is first mentioned in ca. 802, when the [[Abbasid]] prince [[al-Ma'mun]] made several campaigns against Osrushana in order to ensure that Kawus stayed loyal to him. However, when al-Ma'mun ascended the Abbasid throne in 813, Kawus declared independence from the Abbasid Caliphate. In ca. 818, a civil war ensued in Osrushana between several princes. Kawus managed to emerge victorious, while his son [[Khaydhar ibn Kawus al-Afshin|Khaydar]] fled to the Abbasid court in [[Baghdad]].

In 822, a Abbasid army under [[Ahmad ibn Abi Khalid al-Ahwal]] conquered Osrushana and captured Kawus ibn Kharakhuruh; he was sent to Baghdad, where he submitted to the [[Caliph]] and converted to [[Islam]].&lt;ref&gt;Bosworth, p. 590; Kramers, p. 925; Kennedy, p. 125; al-Baladhuri, pp. 204-05; al-Tabari, v. 32: pp. 107, 135&lt;/ref&gt; From this point on, Osrushana was generally considered to be part of the Abbasid state, although the ''afshƒ´n''s were allowed to retain their control over the country as subjects of the caliph.&lt;ref&gt;Kramers, p. 925. The dynasty remained in power until 893, when Osrushana became a directly-administered province of the [[Samanids]].&lt;/ref&gt; Kawus died sometime later, and was succeeded by his son Khaydar.

{{nihongo|'''Kikoe-≈çgimi'''|ËÅûÂæóÂ§ßÂêõ|}} was the highest ranking ''[[Noro (priestess)|noro priestess]]'' of the [[Ryukyuan religion]] during the period of the [[Ryukyu Kingdom]].

The position of kikoe-≈çgimi was formally established during the reign of King [[Sh≈ç Shin]] (r. 1477-1526) in order to centralize the religious order. Only a royal woman could be appointed to the position of kikoe-≈çgimi.

After Ryukyu's annexation by Japan in 1879, this position was formally abolished, but the last kikoe-≈çgimi continued her role until her death in 1944.

The '''Lao Ga''' ({{lang-th|‡∏•‡∏≤‡∏ß‡∏Å‡∏≤}}, {{RTGS|''Lao Ka''}}, {{IPA-th|lƒÅÀêw kƒÅÀê|pron}}), are a [[Tai peoples|Tai]] sub-ethnic group of [[Lao people]].

==Location==
The Lao Ga are only found in Ban Thap Luang (‡∏ö‡πâ‡∏≤‡∏ô‡∏ó‡∏±‡∏û‡∏´‡∏•‡∏ß‡∏á), [[Ban Rai District]], [[Uthai Thani Province]].  The Lao Ga speak a dialect of the [[Lao language]], and number around 1,900.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20050501232240/http://www.joshuaproject.net/peopctry.php?rop3=210124&amp;rog3=TH Joshua Project - Lao Ga of Thailand Ethnic People Profile&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternate names==
They are also known as ''Lao Gao'' (Thai: ‡∏•‡∏≤‡∏ß‡πÄ‡∏Å‡∏≤) or just plain ''Ga'' referencing the creaky, crow-like way of speaking peculiar to their dialect of [[Lao language|Lao]].  ''Gao'' literally means ''scratchy'', another attribute of the way Lao Ga speakers come across.  Naturally, these terms are offensive.&lt;ref&gt;Hattaway, Paul. (2004). ''Peoples of the Buddhist World: A Christian Prayer Guide.'' Pasadena: William Carey Library.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Like many [[Isan]] people and more specifically, other ethnic Lao groups of Central Thailand, the Lao Ga are descendants of slaves and forced [[corv√©e]] labourers brought after the Siamese conquest of the successor kingdoms of [[Lanxang]], mostly from the region of [[Vientiane]].  This makes them historically related to the [[Lao Wiang]].  Although many Lao groups assimilated into the greater Thai population (unlike in [[Isan]] where their large numbers and close contact with other Lao peoples in [[Laos]] prevented complete [[Thaification]]), the Lao Ga were able to maintain their Lao language and traditions.

==Culture==
The Lao Ga practise [[Therevada Buddhism]] with various amounts of animism and ancestor veneration.  Their culture is very similar to the Lao people from which they descend.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9714">{{Main|List of Catholicoi of all Armenians}}
This is a list of the '''Armenian Catholicoi of Cilicia''' of the [[Holy See of Cilicia]] (full name: the Armenian Catholicosate of the Great House of Cilicia, {{lang-hy|‘ø’°’©’∏’≤’´’Ø’∏’Ω’∏÷Ç’©’´÷Ç’∂ ’Ä’°’µ’∏÷Å  ’Ñ’•’Æ’´ ’è’°’∂’∂ ‘ø’´’¨’´’Ø’´’∏’µ}}).

The Armenian patriarchate was transferred from [[Armenia]] to [[Cilicia]] in 1058. Although the see at [[Echmiadzin]] was restored in 1441, the Cilician catholicosate continued in existence, and continues to exist to the present day. Today the see is located in [[Antelias]], [[Lebanon]].  The [[Catholicos of Armenia and All Armenians]] claims sovereignty over the Catholicos of Cilicia, though the latter operates independently.

==Catholicoi==
''(Name in English, dates, [[Armenian language|Armenian]] name)''

The Catholicoi of the [[Holy See of Cilicia|Great House of Cilicia]] (the traditional name of the Holy See) include:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3477">The '''Catholic Church of Iraq''' has no national (Latin) episcopal conference, but is united in an inter-rite Assembly of the Catholic Bishops of Iraq, given its diversity :
* a Latin non-Metropolitan Archdiocese (participation in the transcontinental Arab Region Latin Bishops conference)
* divided over four [[Eastern Catholic]] rite-specific particular churches : a Patriarchate, two Metropolitan - and six other archeparchies, three more eparchies and two (pre-diocesan) [[Patriarchal exarchate]]s.

There is an [[Apostolic Nunciature]] to Iraq in the national capital [[Baghdad]], as papal diplomatic representation at embassy-level (Established as [[Apostolic Delegation]] of Mesopotamia, Kurdistan and Lesser Armenia, in 1937 renamed as Apostolic Delegation of Iraq, promoted on 1966.10.14), into which is also vested the Apostolic Nunciature to neighbouring (Trans)[[Jordan]].

'''List of different terms by Christian denominations in Japanese''' presents the difference of terms between [[List of Christian denominations|Christian denominations]] in [[Japanese language|Japanese]]. This article presents Japanese terms of [[Eastern Orthodoxy]] ([[Japanese Orthodox Church]]), [[Roman Catholic]], [[Anglican Church]] ([[Nippon Sei Ko Kai|Anglican Church in Japan]]), and [[Protestant]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Oriental Orthodoxy]] in Japan has extremely few believers, and their translations are also very few.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Japan, the [[Roman Catholic]] mission began in August 1549, [[Protestant]] mission - in 1859, [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] mission - 1861.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08297a.htm CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Japan]&lt;/ref&gt;

Each different mission founded their churches, determined terms in Japanese, and translated the [[Bible]] and other religious books, whose activities are almost separately by denominations.

{{see also|Bible translations (Japanese)}}

Their terms have concepts found by each theology or history, etc. They are suitable for using in own denomination. Thus Japanese Christians use many different terms in each denomination.

As Protestantism does not have a [[hierarchy]], its frames are omitted here.

In some of Protestants, bishop is "[[:ja:Áõ£Áù£|Áõ£Áù£]]", pastor is "[[:ja:ÁâßÂ∏´|ÁâßÂ∏´]]" and deacon is "[[:ja:Âü∑‰∫ã|Âü∑‰∫ã]]".

[[File:MetternichStela.jpg|thumb|Center panel of the Metternich Stela]]

The '''Metternich Stela''' is a magico-medical [[stele]] that is part of the Egyptian Collection of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in [[New York City]]. It dates to the [[thirtieth dynasty of Egypt]] around 380‚Äì342 B.C. during the reign of [[Nectanebo II]]. The provenance of the stele is unknown.

==History==

The stela belongs to a group of stelae known as the "Cippi of [[Horus]]" or 'Stelae of Horus on the crocodiles'. These types of stelae were used to protect the ancient Egyptian people from dangerous animals such as crocodiles and snakes. The Magical Stela is one of the largest and most complete of this kind.  

It is theorized that in the reign of Nectanebo II, a priest named Esatum traveled to the burial place of the [[Mnevis]] bulls at [[Heliopolis (Ancient Egypt)|Heliopolis]]. There he noticed certain inscriptions that he thought were interesting and ordered them to be copied onto a large block of stone. There the stela was created and stood for many years until [[Alexander the Great]] conquered the [[Persian people|Persians]] in Egypt and it was brought to [[Alexandria]].  

For over two thousand years, the stela was missing until it was discovered in a wall that was excavated in a [[Franciscan]] [[monastery]]. The stela was then presented to [[Austrian Empire|Austrian]] statesman, [[Klemens Wenzel von Metternich|Prince Metternich]] in 1828 by [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali Pasha]], the ruler of Egypt, and Metternich had stored it in his [[Kyn≈ævart Castle]] (in [[Bohemia]]) where the stela remained until 1950, being then purchased by the Metropolitan Museum of Art (where it was known for many years as the Metternich Stela).

==Construction==

The stela is a large block below, (a [[plinth]]) connected to a thinner block with a curved top. The dimensions are a height of 35 12/16 inch and a width of 13 ¬º inch. The piece was made from one huge block of fine grained, hard, gray-green stone made from [[greywacke]]. The stela is well preserved with only a few small visible chips. It seems to have been created with exact precision and care therefore making it a most intriguing and valuable addition to the Metropolitan Museum of Art. 

The top portion of the stela portrays a disk of the sun that identifies [[Ra]], the sun god of the ancient Egyptian religion. On each side of Ra are four baboons. On the far left of the baboons is the messenger god [[Djehuty|Thoth]]. On the far right of the baboons is the reigning pharaoh Nectanebo II bowing towards Ra. 

The main portion of the relief is separated by the top portion with five lines of [[Egyptian hieroglyph|hieroglyphics]]. The center of the stela portrays Horus as a child standing on crocodiles. Above his head is the face of [[Bes]], who is the guardian of the newborn and childbirth. Horus is holding in each hand a serpent and scorpion, along with a lion and oryx in either hand. 

On the near left of Horus is Re'Horakhty, which is the combination of the two sky gods Horus and Re, standing on a serpent and surrounding both of them are two divine symbols. On the far left of the relief is Isis standing upon a serpent and on her left is the standard of the vulture goddess of the south. On the far right is again the god Thoth standing on a serpent and on his right is the standard of the serpent goddess of the north. Above the gods are the eyes of Horus, the sun and the moon. 

The rest of the stela is covered with hieroglyphics from top to bottom and also on both sides. These hieroglyphics document the stories of the gods and their experiences with poisonous animals. There are also many curses and spells for different types of sickness caused by these animals. 

Another point of interest with the stela is on the upper portion of the reverse side. There is a winged man who represents the demonic solar god Harmeti. He is standing upon his enemies, which are evil animals enclosed in a circle to prevent their escape.

==Mythology==

The main function of the Metternich Stela was for the magical healing of poisons, mostly caused by animals. Water was poured over the Stela and collected. The water from the Stela was then drunk by the person suffering from the poisonous ailment. That person would identify with the child Horus who had also suffered such tragedies. During the entire process religious rites from the Stela were recited by local priests. 

The first few spells on the stela are related to reptiles and other harmful creatures. The most prominent was the serpent demon [[Apep|Apophis]] who was the enemy of Ra for he is the equivalent of the devil. The spell forced the serpent to decapitate and burn into pieces. The second half of the spell would force the serpent to vomit and while the priest recited this spell the person inflicted would also vomit freeing their body of the poison. 

The next spell was directed towards a cat. The cat contained a bit of a god or goddess and would be able to destroy any sort of poison. The spell asks for Ra to aid the cat in her time of need. 

Most of the Stela has inscriptions that describe stories such as the ones above in relation to being poisoned and spells to be cured. The most famous is the story of Isis and the Seven Scorpions. The story takes up the majority of the stela and is most referenced when it came to ailments dealing with poisons. 

[[Isis]] was the mother of Horus, along with his father [[Osiris]] who was the ruler of the living world. Osiris was killed by his brother [[Set (mythology)|Set]] who was incredibly jealous of his power. When Isis and [[Nephthys]] discovered this, they brought Osiris back to life with the use of magic. Set was enraged and so he killed Osiris once again, but this time he chopped up his body into many parts and scattered them throughout Egypt. Osiris then became the pharaoh of the dead and the underworld, while the land of the living was ruled by no one. 

Set was content thinking he would become the pharaoh of the living, but what he didn't know was that Isis was pregnant with Osiris's child. He would become pharaoh of the living because of his birthright. After Isis gave birth to Horus, it was thought that he would become the new pharaoh of the living, but once Set found out he became very angry. 

At this point the actual spell starts on the Magical Stela. Set had the child poisoned by a scorpion, which is often associated with the serpent demon, Apophis. Isis was outraged with grief at the death of her child. She called out to Ra and asked him for his aid. He sent Thoth who restored the child to life. From that point Ra would act as an advocate to Horus, just as his father Osiris would've done if alive.

Horus lived but later fought Set to see who would become the pharaoh of the living. During the fight Set ripped out Horus's eye and won the battle. This is where the symbol 'the Eye of Horus' is from. Set then became the pharaoh of the living once again. 

Isis could not stand by and let this happen because her son was the rightful ruler. She went into the underworld disguised and sought out Set. She told him how an evil man took something from her son that was rightfully his. Set ordered to have this corrected, not knowing who she was referring to. Isis revealed herself to Set and he tried to recant, but Ra witnessed the event and made Horus the pharaoh of the living. 

The majority of the stela relates to how Horus was poisoned and cured. The ancient Egyptians would also use this cure for their own people who suffered from poisons. The sick would have the spirit of Horus within them and they would be cured just as Horus was. (Egyptian Art) The stories inscribed on this stela, especially the one regarding Isis and Horus are the most comprehensive found on any monument.

'''''Nymphaea caerulea''''', known primarily as '''blue lotus''' (or '''blue Egyptian lotus'''), but also '''blue water lily''' (or '''blue Egyptian water lily'''), and '''sacred blue lily''', is a [[Nymphaeaceae|water lily]] in the [[genus]] ''[[Nymphaea]]''. Like other species in the genus, the plant contains the psychoactive alkaloid [[aporphine]] (not to be confused with [[apomorphine]]). It was known to the [[Ancient Egypt]]ian civilizations.

==Distribution==
Its original habitat may have been along the [[Nile]] and other parts of East Africa. It spread more widely in ancient times, including to the [[Indian subcontinent]] and [[Thailand]].

==Description==
The [[leaf|leaves]] are broadly rounded, {{convert|25‚Äì40|cm|abbr=on|0}} across, with a notch at the leaf stem. The [[flower]]s are {{convert|10‚Äì15|cm|abbr=on|0}} in diameter.

Reports in the literature by persons unfamiliar with its actual growth and blooming cycle have suggested that the flowers open in the morning, rising to the surface of the water, then close and sink at dusk.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} In fact, the flower buds rise to the surface over a period of two to three days, and when ready, open around 9:30&amp;nbsp;am and close about 3:00&amp;nbsp;pm.  The flowers and buds do not rise above the water in the morning, nor do they submerge at night.  The flowers have pale bluish-white to sky-blue or [[mauve]] [[petal]]s, smoothly changing to a pale yellow in the centre of the flower.

==Religion and art==
[[Image:Funerary Stele of Ba.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Ancient Egypt]]ian funerary stele showing a dead man, named Ba, seated in the center, sniffing a sacred lily, New Kingdom, Dynasty XVIII, ''circa'' 1550‚Äì1292 BC]]

Along with the white lotus, ''[[Nymphaea lotus]] are'' also native to Egypt. The plant and flower are very frequently depicted in Egyptian art. They have been depicted in numerous stone carvings and paintings, including the walls of the famous temple of Karnak, and are frequently depicted in connection with "party scenes", dancing or in significant spiritual or magical rites such as the rite of passage into the afterlife. ''N. caerulea'' was considered extremely significant in [[Egyptian mythology]], regarded as a symbol of the sun, since the flowers are closed at night and open again in the morning.  At [[Heliopolis (Ancient Egypt)|Heliopolis]], the origin of the world was taught to have been when the sun god [[Ra]] emerged from a lotus flower growing in "primordial waters". At night, he was believed to retreat into the flower again.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jessica Rawson|Rawson, Jessica]], ''Chinese Ornament: The lotus and the dragon'', pp. 200 (quoted)‚Äì202, 1984, British Museum Publications, {{ISBN|0-714-11431-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to its colour, it was identified, in some beliefs, as having been the original container, in a similar manner to an [[egg]], of [[Atum]], and in similar beliefs Ra, both [[solar deity|solar deities]]. As such, its properties form the origin of the "lotus variant" of the [[Ogdoad (Egyptian)|Ogdoad]] [[cosmogeny]]. It was the symbol of the Egyptian deity [[Nefertem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Wilkinson | first=Richard H. | title=The Complete Gods and Goddesses of Ancient Egypt | publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson | date=2003 | page=133 | isbn=0-500-05120-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Properties and uses==

Some evidence indicates the medicinal effects of plants including ''N. caerulea'' that contain the psychoactive alkaloid [[aporphine]] were known to both the [[Maya civilization|Mayans]] and the [[Ancient Egypt]]ians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bertol|first1=Elisabetta|last2=Fineschi|first2=Vittorio|last3=Karch|first3=Steven B. |last4=Mari |first4=Francesco |last5=Riezzo |first5=Irene |title=Nymphaea cults in ancient Egypt and the New World: a lesson in empirical pharmacology |journal=Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine |date=2004 |volume=97 |issue=2 |pages=84‚Äì85 |pmc=1079300 |doi=10.1258/jrsm.97.2.84 |pmid=14749409}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mildly sedating effects of ''N. caerulea'' makes it a likely candidate (among several) for the lotus plant eaten by the mythical [[Lotophagi]] in [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]''.

This lotus has been used to produce [[perfume]]s since ancient times; it is also used in [[aromatherapy]].

'''Premarital sex'''  is [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]] practiced by people before they are [[Marriage|married]]. Historically, premarital sex was considered a moral issue which was taboo in many cultures and considered a sin by a number of religions, but [[sexual revolution|since about the 1960s]], it has become more widely accepted, especially in [[Western countries]]. A 2014 Pew study on global morality found that premarital sex was considered particularly unacceptable in "predominantly Muslim nations", such as [[Malaysia]], [[Indonesia]], [[Jordan]], [[Pakistan]] and [[Egypt]], each having over 90% disapproval, while people in Western European countries were the most accepting, with [[Spain]], [[Germany]] and [[France]] expressing less than 10% disapproval.&lt;ref name="pewtable"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewglobal.org/2014/04/15/global-morality/table/premarital-sex/|title=Global Views on Morality - Premarital Sex|date=15 Apr 2014|publisher=PewResearch Global Attitudes Project}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within Christianity, the Roman Catholic Church calls premarital sex a sin that must be forgiven through [[Confession (religion)|confession]].

==Definition==
Until the 1950s,{{sfn|Sex and Society 663-666}} "premarital sex" referred to sexual relations between two people prior to marrying each other.{{sfn|Regnerus|Uecker|2011|Introduction}} During that period, it was the norm in Western societies for men and women to marry by the age of 21 or 22, and there was no considerations that one who had sex would not marry. The term was used instead of [[fornication]], which had negative connotations,{{sfn|Sex and Society 663-666}} and was closely related to the concept and approval of [[virginity]], which is sexual abstinence until marriage.

The meaning has since shifted to refer to any sexual relations a person has prior to marriage and removing the emphasis on the relationship of the people involved.{{sfn|Regnerus|Uecker|2011|Introduction}} The definition has a degree of [[ambiguity]]. It is not clear whether sex between individuals [[Marriage law#Marriage restrictions|legally forbidden from marrying]], or the sexual relations of one uninterested in marrying would be considered premarital.{{sfn|Sex and Society 663-666}}

Alternative terms for premarital sex have been suggested, including ''non-marital sex'' (which overlaps with [[adultery]]), ''youthful sex'', ''adolescent sex'', and ''young-adult sex''. These terms also suffer from a degree of ambiguity, as the definition of ''having sex'' differs from person to person.{{sfn|Sex and Society 663-666}}

==Prevalence==
In some cultures, for example in many modern Western cultures, many people do not hold value in [[sexual abstinence]] before marriage.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018|reason=Cite source for this statement}}

Historically, at least a significant portion of people have engaged in premarital sex, although the number willing to admit to having done so was not always high. In a study conducted in the United States, 61 percent of men and 12 percent of women born prior to 1910 admitted to having premarital sex; the [[gender disparity]] may have been caused by cultural double standards regarding the admission of sexual activity or by men frequenting prostitutes.{{sfn|Sex and Society 663-666}}

Starting in the 1920s, and especially after [[World War II]], premarital sex became more common; this was especially prevalent among women. By the end of the 20th century, between 75 and 80 percent of Americans had vaginal intercourse before the age of 19. This has been attributed to numerous causes, including the increasing median age at marriage and the widespread availability of efficient [[contraceptive]]s.{{sfn|Sex and Society 663-666}}

According to a 2001 [[UNICEF]] survey, in 10 out of 12 developed nations with available data, more than two-thirds of young people have had sexual intercourse while still in their teens. In Denmark, Finland, Germany, Iceland, [[Norway]], the United Kingdom and the [[United States]], the proportion is over 80%.

A majority of Americans have had premarital sex, according to a 2007 article in Public Health Reports. This fact is true for current young adults and also young adults in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Data from the National Survey of Family Growth indicate that in 2002, 77% of Americans had sex by age 20, and of that percent, 75% had premarital sex. In comparison, of women who turned 15 between 1964 and 1993, approximately 91% had premarital sex by age 30. Of women who turned 15 between 1954 and 1963, 82% of them had had premarital sex by age 30.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author= L.B. Finer | publisher=[[Public Health Report]] | title=Trends in Premarital Sex in the United States, 1954‚Äì2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, when comparing the General Social Survey of 1988‚Äì1996 to the one of 2004‚Äì2012, researchers found that participants of 2004‚Äì2012 did not report more sexual partners since the age of 18, nor more frequent sex or sex partners during the past year than those respondents of the 1988-1996 survey. Furthermore, there appears to be no substantial change in sexual behavior contrasting the earlier era to the current one. However, one of the differences included sexually active respondents of the current era were more likely to report having sex with a casual date or friend than reporting having sex with a spouse or regular partner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=M.A. Monto |author2=A.G.

===Gender differences===
Within the United States, a [[cohort study]] of young adults in university found men self-report more permissive attitudes about casual sex than women.&lt;ref name="pmid23842785"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Sprecher S, Treger S, Sakaluk JK | title=Premarital sexual standards and sociosexuality: gender, ethnicity, and cohort differences. | journal=Arch Sex Behav | year= 2013 | volume= 42 | issue= 8 | pages= 1395‚Äì405 | pmid=23842785 | doi=10.1007/s10508-013-0145-6 | pmc= | url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10508-013-0145-6  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study found university students can be grouped by their ideal relationships‚Äîthose who express a desire for sex exclusively in a committed partnership have fewer hookups and friends with benefits partners than those categorised as desiring "flexible" relationships and recreational sex.&lt;ref name="pmid23297148"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Olmstead SB, Billen RM, Conrad KA, Pasley K, Fincham FD | title=Sex, commitment, and casual sex relationships among college men: a mixed-methods analysis. | journal=Arch Sex Behav | year= 2013 | volume= 42 | issue= 4 | pages= 561‚Äì71 | doi=10.1007/s10508-012-0047-z | pmc= | pmid=23297148 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One 2006 study that analysed the [[Toledo Adolescent Relationships Study]] found that more boys report having non-dating sexual partners than girls. Of this sample, a third of boys only have had sex with their romantic partner, another third of boys who have had sex with a partner they are not dating within the past year are believed to wish for the girl to be their girlfriend.&lt;ref name="pmiddoi: 10.1177/0743558406291692"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Schmoldt A, Benthe HF, Haberland G | title=The Relationship Contexts of "Nonrelationship" Sex | journal= Journal of Adolescent Research | year= 2006 | volume= 21 | issue= 5 | pages= 459‚Äì483 | doi= 10.1177/0743558406291692| pmc= | url=http://jar.sagepub.com/content/21/5/459.short  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many young adults are more likely to engage in sex with romantic partners than with casual acquaintances or friends with benefits.&lt;ref name="pmid21128155"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Furman W, Shaffer L | title=Romantic partners, friends, friends with benefits, and casual acquaintances as sexual partners. | journal=J Sex Res | year= 2011 | volume= 48 | issue= 6 | pages= 554‚Äì64 | pmid=21128155 | doi=10.1080/00224499.2010.535623 | pmc=3163778  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One 2011 study surveyed young adults about their emotional reactions after sexual encounters, finding that men reported more positive and fewer negative emotional reactions, and both men and women reported that the experience was largely more positive than negative.&lt;ref name="pmid20809375"/&gt; Women reported that condom use was associated with fewer positive and more negative emotional reactions, and for men condom use was associated with fewer negative emotional reactions.&lt;ref name="pmid20809375"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Owen J, Fincham FD | title=Young adults' emotional reactions after hooking up encounters. | journal=Arch Sex Behav | year= 2011 | volume= 40 | issue= 2 | pages= 321‚Äì30 | doi=10.1007/s10508-010-9652-x | pmc= | pmid=20809375  }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 23-year study in a Human Sexuality class investigated gender differences in men and women‚Äôs reactions to their first sexual experience. In the earlier years of the study, men reported more pleasure and greater anxiety than women, while women reported more feelings of guilt than men. Cohort studies carried out over 23 years found that in later years, women expressed greater pleasure and less guilt. The differences between emotional reactions among men and women decreased slightly during the 23 years.&lt;ref name="pmid24611882"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Sprecher S| title=Evidence of change in men's versus women's emotional reactions to first sexual intercourse: a 23-year study in a human sexuality course at a midwestern university. | journal=J Sex Res | year= 2014 | volume= 51 | issue= 4 | pages= 466‚Äì72 | doi=10.1080/00224499.2013.867923 | pmc= | pmid=24611882  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such decreases in differences to first sexual intercourse may be a result of the increasing normality of premarital sex in America. An international online sex survey compared responses of residents of 37 countries against World Economic Forum figures for gender equality in those countries, finding that countries with high gender equality had respondents report more casual sex, a greater number of sex partners, younger ages for first sex, and greater tolerance of premarital sex.&lt;ref name="pmid21675186"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Baumeister RF, Mendoza JP | title=Cultural variations in the sexual marketplace: gender equality correlates with more sexual activity. | journal=J Soc Psychol | year= 2011 | volume= 151 | issue= 3 | pages= 350‚Äì60 | doi=10.1080/00224545.2010.481686 | pmc= | pmid=21675186  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethnicity differences===
Different ethnic and cultural groups in America have varied religiosity and sexual attitudes. Researchers conducted a study with college participants and they found Asians had more conservative sexual attitudes compared to Hispanics and Euro-Americans. Hispanics reported sexual attitudes similar to that of Euro-Americans. Asian, Hispanic, and Euro-American women with high levels of spirituality were found to have a correlation between conservative sexual attitudes and perceived religiosity. Religiosity and religious fundamentalism predicted conservative sexual attitudes most strongly in Euro-Americans and Asians.&lt;ref name="pmid18839302"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Ahrold TK, Meston CM | title=Ethnic differences in sexual attitudes of U.S. college students: gender, acculturation, and religiosity factors. | journal=Arch Sex Behav | year= 2010 | volume= 39 | issue= 1 | pages= 190‚Äì202 | doi=10.1007/s10508-008-9406-1 | pmc= 4426857| pmid=18839302  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[India]]n city of [[Mumbai]], research showed that among college-age students, 3% of females affirmed having premarital sex and 26% of college-aged men affirmed having premarital sex.&lt;ref name="JosephNa«ßmƒÅbƒÅdƒ´2003"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Joseph|first1=Suad|last2=Na«ßmƒÅbƒÅdƒ´|first2=AfsƒÅna|title=Encyclopedia of Women &amp; Islamic Cultures: Family, Body, Sexuality And Health|year=2003|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|language=English |isbn=9789004128194|page=387}}&lt;/ref&gt; Population Council, an international NGO, released a working report showing similar statistics nationally in India, with fewer than ten percent of young females reporting having had premarital sex, compared with 15% to 30% of young males.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Pre-marital-sex-Girls-like-to-keep-mum/articleshow/2236263.cms|title=Pre-marital sex: Girls like to keep mum|last=Himanshi|first=Dhawan|last2=Kurup|first2=Saira|date=24 October 2006|publisher=[[The Times of India]]|language=English|accessdate=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Pakistan]], 11% of men were reported as having participated in pre-marital sex, although a greater percentage, 29% reported having participated in non-marital sex.&lt;ref name="Mir2013"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mir |first=Ali M. |author2= Abdul Wajid, Stephen Pearson |author3= Mumraiz Khan and Irfan Masood |year=2013 |title= Exploring urban male non-marital sexual behaviours in Pakistan |journal= Reproductive Health |volume=10 |issue=1 |issn=1742-4755|doi=10.1186/1742-4755-10-22 |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Safe sex practices==
People who have premarital sex are recommended by health professionals to take precautions to protect themselves against [[sexually transmitted infection]]s (STIs) such as [[HIV/AIDS]].{{sfn|Center for Disease Control}} There is also a risk of an [[unintended pregnancy|unplanned pregnancy]] in [[heterosexual]] relationships.{{sfn|Speidel, Harper, and Shields; 2008}} Around the world, [[sex education]] programs are run to teach school students about [[reproductive health]], [[safe sex|safer sex]] practices, [[sexual abstinence]] and [[birth control]].

Sexual activity among unmarried people who do not have access to information about reproductive health and birth control can increase the rate of [[teenage pregnancies]] and contraction of [[sexually transmitted infections]]. The rates of teenage pregnancy vary and range from 143 per 1000 girls in some sub-Saharan African countries to 2.9 per 1000 in South Korea. The rate for the United States is 52.1 per 1000, the highest in the developed world ‚Äì and about four times the European Union average.&lt;ref name=oecd /&gt;&lt;ref name=ncbi&gt;{{cite journal |author=Treffers PE |title=Teenage pregnancy, a worldwide problem |language=Dutch, Flemish |journal=Ned Tijdschr Geneeskd |volume=147 |issue=47 |pages=2320‚Äì5 |date=November 2003  |pmid=14669537 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The teenage pregnancy rates between countries must take into account the level of general [[sex education]] available and access to contraceptive options.

==Cultural views==
[[File:Non marital by countries.gif|450px|thumb|Percentage of births to unmarried women, selected countries, 1980 and 2007.&lt;ref name="non_mar1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/databriefs/db18.htm|title=Changing Patterns of Nonmarital Childbearing in the United States |work=CDC/National Center for Health Statistics|date=May 13, 2009|accessdate=September 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The cultural acceptability of premarital sex varies between individuals, cultures and time periods. Western cultures have traditionally been disapproving of it, on occasions forbidding it. In other cultures, such as the [[Muria people]] of [[Madhya Pradesh]], sexuality prior to marriage is accepted and at times expected.{{sfn|Sex and Society 663-666}}

Individual views within a given society can vary greatly, with expectations ranging from total [[abstinence]] to frequent [[casual sex]]. These views are dependent on the holders' [[value system]], as formed by his or her parents, religion, friends, experiences, and in many cases the media.{{sfn|Sex and Society 663-666}} Unmarried [[cohabitation]] and births outside marriage have increased in many Western countries during the past few decades.

===Britain===
Sex before the public marriage ceremony was normal in the Anglican Church until the [[Hardwicke Marriage Act of 1753]], which for the first time required all marriages in England and Wales occur in their [[Church of England parish church|parish church]]. (The law also applied to [[Catholic Church in England and Wales|Catholics]], but Jews and Quakers were exempt.) Before its enactment couples lived and slept together after their [[betrothal]] or "the spousals", considered a legal marriage. Until the mid-1700s it was normal and acceptable for the bride to be pregnant at the [[nuptials]], the later public ceremony for the marriage. The Marriage Act combined the spousals and nuptials, and by the start of the 19th century social convention prescribed that brides be virgins at marriage. Illegitimacy became more socially discouraged, with first pregnancies outside marriage declining from 40% to 20% during the Victorian era. At the start of the 21st Century, the figure was back up to 40%.&lt;ref name="bbc20021003"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/2296151.stm |title=The no-sex 'myth' |work=BBC News |date=2002-10-03 |accessdate=May 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Britain, births outside marriage were up to 47.6% by 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/tgm/table.do?tab=table&amp;plugin=1&amp;language=en&amp;pcode=tps00018 Eurostat - Tables, Graphs and Maps Interface (TGM) table&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, only 13% of the population found premarital sex unacceptable.&lt;ref name="pewtable"/&gt;

===United States===
During the colonial period, premarital sex was publicly frowned upon but privately condoned to an extent. Unmarried teenagers were often allowed to spend the night in bed together, though some measures such as [[Bundling (tradition)|bundling]] were sometimes attempted to prevent sexual intercourse. Even though premarital sex was somewhat condoned, having a child outside wedlock was not. If a pregnancy resulted from premarital sex, the young couple were expected to marry. Marriage and birth records from the late 1700s reveal that between 30 and 40 percent of New England brides were pregnant before marriage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://maghis.oxfordjournals.org/content/18/4/9.extract Courtship and Sexual Freedom in Eighteenth-Century America&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The growing popularity of the automobile, and corresponding changes in dating practices, caused premarital sex to become more prevalent. [[Alfred Kinsey]] found that American women who became sexually mature during the 1920s were much less likely to be virgins at marriage than those who became mature before World War I. A majority of women during the 1920s under the age of 30 were nonetheless virgins at marriage, however, and half of those who were not only had sex with their fianc√©s.&lt;ref name="ling198911"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.historytoday.com/peter-ling/sex-and-automobile-jazz-age |title=Sex and the Automobile in the Jazz Age |author=Ling, Peter |journal=History Today |date=November 1989 |volume=39 |issue=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 1938 survey of American college students found that 52% of men and 24% of women had had sex. 37% of women were virgins but believed sex outside marriage was acceptable.&lt;ref name="life1938060666"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LU8EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA66 | title="Youth and Sex": 1,300 boys and girls answer questions |work=Life |date=1938-06-06 |accessdate=December 9, 2011 |page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the middle of the 20th century, sexuality was generally constrained. Sexual interactions between people without plans to marry was considered unacceptable, with [[betrothal]] slightly lessening the stigma. However, premarital sex was still frowned upon.{{sfn|Sex and Society 663-666}}

Beginning in the 1950s, as premarital sex became more common, the stigma attached to it lessened for many people. In 1969, 70% of Americans disapproved of premarital sex, but by 1973 this number had dropped to 50%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Alesha Doan|title=Opposition and Intimidation: The Abortion Wars and Strategies of Political Harassment|date=2007|publisher=University of Michigan Press|isbn=9780472069750|pages=58‚Äì59}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2000, roughly a third of couples in the United States had lived together prior to marriage.

However, premarital sex was still considered unacceptable by 30% of the population in a 2014 study, while 29% found it acceptable and 36% considered it not a moral issue.{{sfn|Sex and Society 663-666}}&lt;ref name="pewtable"/&gt;

'''''Psilocybe aztecorum''''' is a species of [[psilocybin mushroom]] in the family [[Hymenogastraceae]]. Known from Arizona, Colorado, central Mexico, India and Costa Rica, the fungus grows on decomposing woody debris and is found in mountainous areas at elevations of {{convert|2000|to|4000|m|abbr=on}}, typically in meadows or open, grassy conifer forests. The mushrooms have convex to bell-shaped [[pileus (mycology)|caps]] {{convert|1.5|‚Äì|2|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} in diameter, atop slender cylindrical [[stipe (mycology)|stems]] that are up to {{convert|7.5|cm|in|abbr=on}} long. The color of the caps [[hygrophanous|changes with variations in hydration]], ranging from dark [[chestnut (color)|chestnut]] brown to straw yellow or whitish when dry. The base of the stem is densely covered with conspicuous white [[rhizomorph]]s, a characteristic uncommon amongst ''[[Psilocybe]]'' species.

The species was first reported by French mycologist [[Roger Heim]] in 1956 as a [[variety (botany)|variety]] of ''[[Psilocybe mexicana]]'' before he officially [[species description|described]] it under its current name a year later. Named for its association with the [[Nahua people]] also called [[Aztec]]s, ''P.&amp;nbsp;aztecorum'' may have been one of the sacred mushroom species, or ''teonan√°catl'' (A [[Nahuatl]] word translated variously as "sacred mushroom" or "flesh of the gods"), reported in the [[Aztec codices|codices]] of 16th-century Spanish chronicler [[Bernardino de Sahag√∫n]]. The mushrooms are still used for spiritual ceremonies by Nahua Indians in the [[Popocat√©petl]] region, although this traditional usage is waning. The variety ''P.&amp;nbsp;aztecorum'' var. ''bonetii'' has smaller [[spore]]s than the main variety, and is found at lower elevations with [[Montezuma pine]] (''Pinus montezumae'') and [[sacred fir]] (''Abies religiosa''). ''P.&amp;nbsp;aztecorum'' may be distinguished from similar [[temperate]] species such as ''[[Psilocybe baeocystis|P.&amp;nbsp;baeocystis]]'' and ''[[Psilocybe quebecensis|P.&amp;nbsp;quebecensis]]'' by their ranges, and by differences in the [[morphology (biology)|morphology]] of microscopic structures like [[cystidia]].

==Taxonomy and nomenclature==
The species was first mentioned by French mycologist [[Roger Heim]] in 1956 based on material collected by American [[ethnomycologist]] [[R. Gordon Wasson]] in [[Paso de Cort√©s]], on the slopes of Popocat√©petl mountain in Mexico. Heim originally named the species as a [[variety (botany)|variety]] of ''[[Psilocybe mexicana]]''; limited to dried mushroom material for analysis, he only described the spores, which he explained were "relatively longer and narrower than that of ''Psilocybe mexicana''".&lt;ref name=Heim1956/&gt; A year later, Heim renamed the fungus ''Psilocybe aztecorum'' and officially [[species description|described]] it, in addition to several other Mexican ''[[Psilocybe]]'' taxa.&lt;ref name=Heim1957/&gt; Some of these mushrooms, including ''P.&amp;nbsp;aztecorum'', were illustrated in the popular American weekly magazine ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' ("[[Seeking the Magic Mushroom]]"), in which Wasson recounted the [[psychedelic experience|psychedelic visions]] that he experienced during the [[divination|divinatory]] rituals of the [[Mazatec people]], thereby introducing psilocybin mushrooms to Western popular culture.&lt;ref name=Wasson1957/&gt;

In 1978, Mexican mycologist and ''Psilocybe'' specialist [[Gast√≥n Guzm√°n]] [[Emendation (taxonomy)|emended]] the description of ''P.&amp;nbsp;aztecorum'' to include the color variation of the [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] resulting from its strongly [[hygrophanous]] nature, the [[Mycena|mycenoid]] form, the [[rhizoid]]s at the base of the [[stipe (mycology)|stem]], the [[lignicolous]] habitat, and the size of the spores‚Äîall features that he thought were either confused, or not sufficiently detailed, in Heim's original description.&lt;ref name=Guzman1978/&gt; In the same publication, Guzm√°n also characterized the variety ''P.&amp;nbsp;aztecorum'' var. ''bonetii'', distinguished from the main variety by its smaller spores.&lt;ref name=Guzman1978/&gt; He had originally described this variant as a separate species, ''Psilocybe bonetii'', in 1970.&lt;ref name=Guzman1968/&gt; Further, Guzm√°n later published ''[[Psilocybe natarajanii]]'', originally described by him from [[Tamil Nadu]] in southern India,&lt;ref name=Guzman1995/&gt; as a [[synonym (biology)|synonym]] of ''P.&amp;nbsp;aztecorum'' var. ''bonetii'';&lt;ref name=Guzman2000/&gt; this putative synonymy, however, is confirmed by neither [[MycoBank]] nor [[Index Fungorum]].&lt;ref name="urlMycoBank: Psilocybe natarajanii"/&gt;&lt;ref name="urlFungorum: Psilocybe natarajanii"/&gt; Guzm√°n called the main variety ''P.&amp;nbsp;aztecorum'' var. ''aztecorum''; for this reason, the species authority is often cited as "''P.&amp;nbsp;aztecorum'' var. ''aztecorum'' R. Heim emend. Guzm√°n".&lt;ref name="Stamets pp.92-93"&gt;Stamets (1996), [https://books.google.com/books?id=GAmfNNwHkjIC&amp;pg=PA92 pp. 92‚Äì3.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Guzman2008/&gt;

''Psilocybe aztecorum'' is the [[type species]] of Guzm√°n's [[section (biology)|section]] ''Aztecorum'', a group of bluing (i.e., [[psilocybin]]-containing) ''Psilocybe'' mushrooms characterized by having a strongly hygrophanous cap that dries to brown or brownish white when dry; spores that appear asymmetrical when seen in side view; and [[pleurocystidia]] that, when present, are [[hyaline]] (translucent). Other species [[classification (biology)|classified]] in section ''Aztecorum'' are ''[[Psilocybe baeocystis|P.&amp;nbsp;baeocystis]]'' and ''[[Psilocybe quebecensis|P.&amp;nbsp;quebecensis]]''.&lt;ref name=Guzmanp323-6/&gt;

The [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] ''aztecorum'' refers to the [[Aztec]] Indians of central Mexico, who used this mushroom in traditional ceremonies long before the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish came to America]]. The variety ''P.&amp;nbsp;aztecorum'' var. ''bonneti'' is named after Dr. Federico Bonet (died 1980), [[emeritus]] professor of the [[Escuela Nacional de Ciencias Biol√≥gicas]], who assisted Guzm√°n with his [[Doctor of Philosophy|doctoral]] studies.&lt;ref name=Guzmanp323-6/&gt; The popular names of ''P.&amp;nbsp;aztecorum'' are ''ni√±os'' or ''ni√±itos'' (children or little children), or in the Nahuatl language ''apipiltzin''&lt;ref name=Guzmanp323-6/&gt; which means  ''ni√±os del agua'' ("children of the water"), alluding to their habitat along [[ravine]]s.&lt;ref name=Singer1958/&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Psilocybe aztecorum 106711.jpg|thumb|left|The gills have an adnate or adnexed attachment to the stem, sometimes with whitish edges.]]
The [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] is convex to bell-shaped, sometimes developing a broad [[umbo (mycology)|umbo]] before expanding and flattening in age; it reaches a diameter of {{convert|1.5|‚Äì|2|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}. In maturity, the cap eventually forms a central depression, and, in some old specimens, opens into the hollow stem. The cap surface is slimy to the touch, and has translucent striations along the margin when moist. The cap is strongly [[hygrophanous]], meaning that it will change color depending on its level of hydration. The color ranges from yellowish brown to golden yellow in young button forms to brownish gray in age, with greenish-gray tints on the margin. The color later changes to whitish from the center to the margin, finally remaining completely white; dried specimens are straw-colored to pale brownish. In contrast to most psilocybin mushrooms, the cap of ''P.&amp;nbsp;aztecorum'' does not have a strong bluing reaction upon injury‚Äîonly the margin stains slightly green-blue.&lt;ref name=Guzmanp323-6/&gt;
[[File:Psilocybe aztecorum 108691 crop.jpg|thumb|right|A young specimen with prominent rhizomorphs at the stem base, a silky-fibrillose stem surface, and a cobweb-like partial veil covering the gills]]
The [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] are [[adnation|adnate]] (broadly attached to the stem slightly above the bottom of the gill) or adnexed (reaching the stem, but not attached to it), and are light violet gray to dark violet brown. They are either uniform in color, or have whitish edges. The hollow [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] is {{convert|5.5|to|7.5|cm|in|abbr=on}} by {{convert|3|to|4|mm|in|abbr=on}} thick, equal in width throughout or thicker at the top, cylindric or sometimes flattened, and either straight or with turns and windings. Its surface is smooth, silky-[[wikt:fibrillose|fibrillose]], whitish to greyish, and stains blue-green irregularly when touched or in age. The base of the stem is densely covered with well-developed white [[rhizomorph]]s. Young mushrooms have a white cobweb-like [[partial veil]] that does not last long before it disappears, although it sometimes remains as a non-permanent [[annulus (mycology)|ring]] on the upper part of the stem. The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is whitish to yellowish or reddish yellow in the cap, or reddish brown in the stem, and shows little or no bluing reaction to injury. Like most of the bluing ''Psilocybe'' mushrooms, the odor and taste of ''P.&amp;nbsp;aztecorum'' is slightly farinaceous (similar to freshly ground flour) in fresh specimens; dried specimens have a more intense odor. A drop of dilute [[potassium hydroxide]] (KOH) stains the cap, stem, and flesh reddish brown; sometimes, the stem does not stain or stains slightly yellowish red. The [[spore print]] is blackish violet.&lt;ref name=Guzmanp323-6/&gt;

===Microscopic characteristics===
The spores are elongated-ellipsoid in face view, roughly terete (more or less cylindrical but usually tapering at both ends), slightly inequilateral or asymmetrical in side view‚Äîthe so-called "mango" form. They typically have dimensions of 12‚Äì14 by 6.6‚Äì7.7 by 6‚Äì7.5&amp;nbsp;[[micrometre|Œºm]], although some spores have irregular shapes and are strongly elongated, up to 23&amp;nbsp;Œºm. Spores are thick-walled (generally between 1‚Äì1.5&amp;nbsp;Œºm), dark yellowish brown, and have a broad [[germ pore]]. The variety ''bonetii'' has smaller spores measuring 10‚Äì13 by 6‚Äì7.5 by 6‚Äì7&amp;nbsp;Œºm.&lt;ref name=Guzmanp323-6/&gt;

The [[basidia]] (spore-bearing cells) measure 24‚Äì33 by 6.6‚Äì8.8&amp;nbsp;Œºm, and may be attached to anywhere from one to four spores, although four-spored basidia are most common. They are hyaline to sometimes somewhat yellowish, club-shaped or roughly cylindrical, and some have a slight constriction around the middle. The cheilocystidia ([[cystidia]] on the edge of a gill) are abundant, forming a sterile band on the gill edge. They are hyaline, fusoid-ampullaceous (with a shape ranging from a spindle to a swollen bottle), with dimensions of 20‚Äì45 by 5‚Äì8.2&amp;nbsp;Œºm, and have a filamentous neck measuring 6‚Äì11 by 1.6‚Äì2.5&amp;nbsp;Œºm. The pleurocystidia (cystidia on the gill face) are scattered, similar to the cheilocystidia in form and size, hyaline, and some have bifurcated or branched necks.&lt;ref name=Guzmanp323-6/&gt;

==Habitat and distribution==
[[File:Psilocybe aztecorum 189397.jpg|thumb|left|''P. aztecorum'' fruits in high-elevation meadows and open woodlands.]]
A [[lignicolous]] species, ''Psilocybe aztecorum''  lives in and decays dead wood, leaves, sticks, or other similar organic debris. Mushrooms typically fruit in groups of 5 to 20, sometimes in bundles. Usual [[substrate (biology)|substrates]] include wood debris buried in soil, twigs or very rotten logs, and, rarely, [[pine cone]]s. The mushroom is found in [[woodland]]s (a low-density forest or wooded area that allows sunlight to penetrate to the forest floor) containing [[Hartweg's pine]] (''Pinus hartwegii'') in addition to grasses such as ''[[Festuca tolucensis]]'' and ''[[Muhlenbergia quadridentata]]'', and the [[herbaceous plant|herbaceous]] plant ''[[Alchemilla procumbens]]'', at elevations of {{convert|3200|‚Äì|4000|m|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=Guzman1998/&gt; Heim found the [[type (biology)|type]] specimens at an altitude of {{convert|3500|m|abbr=on}} in an alpine [[pine]] forest.&lt;ref name=Heim1957/&gt; ''P.&amp;nbsp;aztecorum'' fruits from August to October.&lt;ref name=Guzmanp323-6/&gt;

''Psilocybe aztecorum'' is known only from the high mountains of central Mexico, such as [[Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt|Sierra Nevada]], [[Nevado de Toluca]], and [[Matlalcueitl (volcano)|La Malinche]] in the States of [[Mexico State|Mexico]], [[Puebla]], and [[Tlaxcala]]. According to Guzm√°n, it is likely that the species also grows in other areas with high mountains, such as the States of [[Nuevo Leon]], [[Veracruz]], [[Colima]], and [[Chiapas]], which have ecological conditions similar to those of the known localities. Variety ''bonetii'' grows in the same substrata as the type variety, mainly on [[humus]], but only in forests with [[Montezuma pine]] (''Pinus montezumae'') and [[sacred fir]] (''Abies religiosa''), between {{convert|2000|‚Äì|3300|m|abbr=on}} elevation; it has not been recorded from Hartweg's pine forests. Also known only from Mexico, in the states of Mexico and [[Morelos]], and in the [[Distrito Federal de M√©xico|Federal District]], ''P.&amp;nbsp;aztecorum'' var. ''bonetii'' usually fruits from August to November.&lt;ref name=Guzmanp323-6/&gt; According to Guzm√°n, ''P.&amp;nbsp;aztecorum'' should be of [[Conservation of fungi|conservation]] concern owing to [[habitat loss|loss]] of its natural habitat.&lt;ref name=Guzman1998/&gt;

==Entheogenic use==
[[File:StoneStairMusDF.JPG|thumb|160px|right|Some of the flower-like decorations on the statue of [[Xochipilli]] have been interpreted as ''P.&amp;nbsp;aztecorum'']]
''Psilocybe aztecorum'' contains the [[psychoactive]] compound [[psilocybin]]. In 1958, Swiss chemist [[Albert Hofmann]] reported a relatively low concentration of 0.02% psilocybin, but this analysis was performed on two-year-old specimens.&lt;ref name=Guzmanp323-6/&gt; [[Jonathan Ott]] and Guzm√°n indicated the presence of psilocybin in the variety ''bonartii''.&lt;ref name=Ott1976/&gt; In terms of psychoactive [[potency (pharmacology)|potency]], [[Paul Stamets]] rates ''P.&amp;nbsp;aztecorum'' as "moderately to highly active".&lt;ref name="Stamets pp.92-93"/&gt;

The statue of the [[Aztec]] "god of flowers", [[Xochipilli]], a 16th-century stone [[effigy]] unearthed on the side of the volcano [[Popocat√©petl]], depicts a single figure seated cross-legged upon a temple-like base; his body is covered in carvings of sacred and psychoactive organisms. Circular patterns on his kneecaps, right forearm, and headdress have been interpreted by [[R. Gordon Wasson]] as stylized fruit bodies of ''Psilocybe aztecorum''. Wasson says that the convex shape and incurved margins depicted in these images show the mushroom caps just before maturity.&lt;ref name=Wasson1974/&gt;&lt;ref name=Granziera2001/&gt; ''P.&amp;nbsp;aztecorum'' is, in addition to ''[[Psilocybe caerulescens|P.&amp;nbsp;caerulescens]]'', one of two mushrooms thought to be the species described by 16th-century Spanish chronicler [[Bernardino de Sahag√∫n]] as the ''teonan√°catl''. The word ''teonan√°catl'' ({{IPA-nah|teoÀênaÀànakatÕ°…¨}}) has been variously translated as "sacred or divine mushroom" or as "flesh of the gods".&lt;ref name=Singer1958/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hoffman1971/&gt;&lt;ref name=Knauth1962/&gt; These mushrooms, considered holy [[sacrament]]s by the Aztecs, were consumed during spiritual and divinatory rituals to induce hallucinatory visions.&lt;ref name=Guzmanp323-6/&gt;&lt;ref name="Stamets pp.92-93"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stamets (1996), [https://books.google.com/books?id=GAmfNNwHkjIC&amp;pg=PA11 pp. 11‚Äì2.]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Psilocybe aztecorum'' is still used ceremonially by the [[indigenous people of Oaxaca]],&lt;ref&gt;Stamets (1996), [https://books.google.com/books?id=GAmfNNwHkjIC&amp;pg=PA110 p. 110.]&lt;/ref&gt; and by [[Nahua people]] in the Popocat√©petl region,&lt;ref name=Guzman2008/&gt;&lt;ref name=Montoya2003/&gt; although this usage is gradually diminishing.&lt;ref name=Guzmanp323-6/&gt; Traditional [[folk healer]]s, or ''curanderos'', maintain familiarity with psychoactive mushrooms (and other mind-altering plants used in ceremonial rituals), and diagnose illnesses by having the client ingest the mushrooms. One [[Mixe people|Mixe]] ''curandero''  initiation ritual involves ingestion of mushrooms following a period of "abstinence from talking, sexual intercourse, and all foods except nuts for three days, whereupon the individual goes up to a mountain, subsists on nothing but a little honey, and prays to God for the power to heal."&lt;ref&gt;Lipp (1998), [https://books.google.com/books?id=t3rbkYjLsh8C&amp;pg=PA150 pp. 150‚Äì1.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In accordance with old belief, all objects, animals and plants had its own ''r√•'' or spirit which protected them. A ''r√•'' could also have power over areas and phenomena belonging to humans, such as the ''skeppsr√•et'' (r√• of the ship) and the ''gruvr√•et'' (r√• of the mine). The r√• was not only known in the Nordic culture, but was also known in the Sami culture, where it was called ''radie''. 
Though the specific ''R√•'''s, such as the ''skogsr√•'' and the ''bergsr√•'', was normally defined as feminine, the species ''r√•'' as such could be both masculine and feminine. It was important for humans to cultivate a good relationship to them, as it had power over the nature forces and animals belonging to them, and could cause humans who interfered with them both luck and the opposite.

{{Hinduism}}
A '''sadhu''' ([[IAST]]: ''{{IAST|sƒÅdhu}}'' (male), ''sƒÅdhvƒ´'' or ''sƒÅdhvƒ´ne'' (female)), also spelled '''saddhu''', is a religious [[ascetic]], mendicant (monk) or any holy person in [[Hinduism]] and [[Jainism]] who has renounced the worldly life.&lt;ref name=britsadhu&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/515896/sadhu-and-swami Brian Duignan, ''Sadhu and swami'', Encyclop√¶dia Britannica]&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Jaini|1991|p=xxviii, 180}}&lt;ref name=klaus299&gt;{{cite book|author=Klaus K.

It literally means one who practises a ‚Ä≥[[sadhana]]‚Ä≥ or keenly follows a path of spiritual discipline.&lt;ref name="Yogananda, Paramhamsa 1997 p.16"&gt;‚Ä≥Autobiography of an Yogi‚Ä≥, Yogananda, Paramhamsa,Jaico Publishing House, 127, Mahatma Gandhi Road, Bombay Fort Road, Bombay (Mumbai) - 400 0023 (ed.1997) p.16&lt;/ref&gt; Although the vast majority of sƒÅdhus are [[yogi|yogƒ´s]], not all yogƒ´s are sƒÅdhus. The sƒÅdhu is solely dedicated to achieving [[moksha|mok·π£a]] (liberation), the fourth and final [[Ashrama (stage)|a≈õrama]] (stage of life), through meditation and contemplation of [[Brahman]]. SƒÅdhus often wear simple clothing, such [[saffron]]-coloured clothing in Hinduism, white or nothing in Jainism, symbolising their [[sannyasa|sannyƒÅsa]] (renunciation of worldly possessions). A female mendicant in Hinduism and Jainism is often called a '''sadhvi''', or in some texts as [[aryika]].{{sfn|Jaini|1991|p=xxviii, 180}}&lt;ref name=klaus299/&gt;

==Etymology==
[[File:Sadhu and a picture of Siva.jpg|thumb|250px|A sadhu in [[yoga]] position, reading a book in [[Varanasi]]]]
The term ''sadhu'' (Sanskrit: ‡§∏‡§æ‡§ß‡•Å) appears in ''[[Rigveda]]'' and ''[[Atharvaveda]]'' where it means "straight, right, leading straight to goal", according to [[Monier Monier-Williams]].&lt;ref name=mmwsadhu&gt;[http://www.ibiblio.org/sripedia/ebooks/mw/1200/mw__1234.html Sadhu], Monier Williams Sanskrit English Dictionary with Etymology, Oxford University Press, page 1201&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|See for example:&lt;br&gt;‡§Ö‡§ó‡•ç‡§®‡•á ‡§µ‡§ø‡§∂‡•ç‡§µ‡•á‡§≠‡§ø‡§É ‡§∏‡•ç‡§µ‡§®‡•Ä‡§ï ‡§¶‡•á‡§µ‡•à‡§∞‡•Ç‡§∞‡•ç‡§£‡§æ‡§µ‡§®‡•ç‡§§‡§Ç ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§•‡§Æ‡§É ‡§∏‡•Ä‡§¶ ‡§Ø‡•ã‡§®‡§ø‡§Æ‡•ç ‡•§ ‡§ï‡•Å‡§≤‡§æ‡§Ø‡§ø‡§®‡§Ç ‡§ò‡•É‡§§‡§µ‡§®‡•ç‡§§‡§Ç ‡§∏‡§µ‡§ø‡§§‡•ç‡§∞‡•á ‡§Ø‡§ú‡•ç‡§û‡§Ç ‡§®‡§Ø ‡§Ø‡§ú‡§Æ‡§æ‡§®‡§æ‡§Ø '''‡§∏‡§æ‡§ß‡•Å''' ‡••‡•ß‡•¨‡•• ‚Äì Rigveda 6.15.16 ([https://sa.wikisource.org/wiki/‡§ã‡§ó‡•ç‡§µ‡•á‡§¶:_‡§∏‡•Ç‡§ï‡•ç‡§§‡§Ç_‡•¨.‡•ß‡•´ Rigveda Hymn ‡§∏‡•Ç‡§ï‡•ç‡§§‡§Ç ‡•¨.‡•ß‡•´], Wikisource)&lt;br&gt;‡§™‡•ç‡§∞ ‡§Ø‡§ú‡•ç‡§û ‡§è‡§§‡•Å ‡§π‡•á‡§§‡•ç‡§µ‡•ã ‡§® ‡§∏‡§™‡•ç‡§§‡§ø‡§∞‡•Å‡§¶‡•ç‡§Ø‡§ö‡•ç‡§õ‡§ß‡•ç‡§µ‡§Ç ‡§∏‡§Æ‡§®‡§∏‡•ã ‡§ò‡•É‡§§‡§æ‡§ö‡•Ä‡§É ‡•§  ‡§∏‡•ç‡§§‡•É‡§£‡•Ä‡§§ ‡§¨‡§∞‡•ç‡§π‡§ø‡§∞‡§ß‡•ç‡§µ‡§∞‡§æ‡§Ø '''‡§∏‡§æ‡§ß‡•Ç'''‡§∞‡•ç‡§ß‡•ç‡§µ‡§æ ‡§∂‡•ã‡§ö‡•Ä‡§Ç‡§∑‡§ø ‡§¶‡•á‡§µ‡§Ø‡•Ç‡§®‡•ç‡§Ø‡§∏‡•ç‡§•‡•Å‡§É ‡••‡•®‡•• ‚Äì Rigveda 7.43.2 ([https://sa.wikisource.org/wiki/‡§ã‡§ó‡•ç‡§µ‡•á‡§¶:_‡§∏‡•Ç‡§ï‡•ç‡§§‡§Ç_‡•≠.‡•™‡•© Rigveda Hymn ‡§∏‡•Ç‡§ï‡•ç‡§§‡§Ç ‡•≠.‡•™‡•©], Wikisource)&lt;br&gt;‡§Ø‡§•‡§æ‡§π‡§æ‡§®‡•ç‡§Ø‡§®‡•Å‡§™‡•Ç‡§∞‡•ç‡§µ‡§Ç ‡§≠‡§µ‡§®‡•ç‡§§‡§ø ‡§Ø‡§• ‡§ã‡§§‡§µ ‡§ã‡§§‡•Å‡§≠‡§ø‡§∞‡•ç‡§Ø‡§®‡•ç‡§§‡§ø '''‡§∏‡§æ‡§ß‡•Å''' ‡•§ ‡§Ø‡§•‡§æ ‡§® ‡§™‡•Ç‡§∞‡•ç‡§µ‡§Æ‡§™‡§∞‡•ã ‡§ú‡§π‡§æ‡§§‡•ç‡§Ø‡•á‡§µ‡§æ ‡§ß‡§æ‡§§‡§∞‡§æ‡§Ø‡•Ç‡§Ç‡§∑‡§ø ‡§ï‡§≤‡•ç‡§™‡§Ø‡•à‡§∑‡§æ‡§Æ‡•ç ‡••‡•´‡•• ‚Äì Rigveda 10.18.5 ([https://sa.wikisource.org/wiki/‡§ã‡§ó‡•ç‡§µ‡•á‡§¶:_‡§∏‡•Ç‡§ï‡•ç‡§§‡§Ç_‡•ß‡•¶.‡•ß‡•Æ Rigveda Hymn ‡§∏‡•Ç‡§ï‡•ç‡§§‡§Ç ‡•ß‡•¶.‡•ß‡•Æ], Wikisource), etc.}} In the [[Brahmana]]s layer of Vedic literature, the term connotes someone who is "well disposed, kind, willing, effective or efficient, peaceful, secure, good, virtuous, honourable, righteous, noble" depending on the context.&lt;ref name=mmwsadhu/&gt; In the Hindu Epics, the term implies someone who is a "saint, sage, seer, holy man, virtuous, chaste, honest or right".&lt;ref name=mmwsadhu/&gt;

The Sanskrit terms ''sƒÅdhu'' ("good man") and ''sƒÅdhvƒ´'' ("good woman") refer to renouncers who have chosen to live lives apart from or on the edges of society to focus on their own spiritual practices.&lt;ref&gt;Flood, Gavin. ''An introduction to Hinduism''. (Cambridge University Press: Cambridge, 1996) p. 92. {{ISBN|0-521-43878-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The words come from the root ''sƒÅdh'', which means "reach one's goal", "make straight", or "gain power over".&lt;ref&gt;[[Arthur Anthony Macdonell]]. ''A Practical Sanskrit Dictionary''. p. 346.&lt;/ref&gt; The same root is used in the word [[sƒÅdhanƒÅ]], which means "spiritual practice". It literally means one who practises a ‚Ä≥sadhana‚Ä≥ or a path of spiritual discipline.&lt;ref name="Yogananda, Paramhamsa 1997 p.16"/&gt;

==Demographics and lifestyle==
There are 4 to 5 million sadhus in India today and they are widely respected for their holiness.&lt;ref&gt;Dolf Hartsuiker. ''[http://www.adolphus.nl/sadhus/ Sadhus and Yogis of India] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071015040933/http://www.adolphus.nl/sadhus/ |date=15 October 2007 }}.''&lt;/ref&gt; It is also thought that the austere practices of the sadhus help to burn off their [[karma]] and that of the community at large. Thus seen as benefiting society, sadhus are supported by donations from many people. However, reverence of sadhus is by no means universal in India. For example, Nath yogi sadhus have been viewed with a certain degree of suspicion particularly amongst the urban populations of India, but they have been revered and are popular in rural India.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last =White | first =David Gordon | year =2012 | title =The Alchemical Body: Siddha Traditions in Medieval India | publisher =University of Chicago Press | pages=7‚Äì8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David N. Lorenzen and Adri√°n Mu√±oz (2012), Yogi Heroes and Poets: Histories and Legends of the Naths, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-1438438900}}, pages x-xi&lt;/ref&gt;

There are naked ([[digambara]], or "sky-clad") sadhus who wear their hair in thick [[dreadlocks]] called ''jata''. Sadhus engage in a wide variety of religious practices. Some practice asceticism and solitary meditation, while others prefer group praying, chanting or meditating. They typically live a simple lifestyle, have very few or no possessions, survive by food and drinks from leftovers that they beg for or is donated by others. Many sadhus have rules for alms collection, and do not visit the same place twice on different days to avoid bothering the residents. They generally walk or travel over distant places, homeless, visiting temples and pilgrimage centers as a part of their spiritual practice.&lt;ref&gt;M Khandelwal (2003), Women in Ochre Robes: Gendering Hindu Renunciation, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0791459225}}, pages 24-29&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mariasusai Dhavamony (2002), Hindu-Christian Dialogue: Theological Soundings and Perspectives, {{ISBN|978-9042015104}}, pages 97-98&lt;/ref&gt; Celibacy is common, but some sects experiment with consensual tantric sex as a part of their practice. Sex is viewed by them as a transcendence from a personal, intimate act to something impersonal and ascetic.&lt;ref&gt;Gavin Flood (2005), The Ascetic Self: Subjectivity, Memory and Tradition, Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|978-0521604017}}, Chapter 4 with pages 105-107 in particular&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sadhu sects==

[[File:Ambubachi Mela at Kamakhya Temple by Vikramjit Kakati.jpg|thumb|250px|Sadhus gathered at [[Assam]]'s Kamakhya Temple for the [[Ambubachi Mela]]]]

===Hinduism===
[[Shaivism|Shaiva]] sadhus are renunciates devoted to [[Shiva]], and [[Vaishnavism|Vaishnava]] sadhus are renouncers devoted to [[Vishnu]] (or his avatar like Rama or Krishna). The Vaishnava sadhus are sometimes referred to as ''vairagis''.&lt;ref name=britsadhu/&gt; Less numerous are [[Shaktism|Shakta]] sadhus, who are devoted to [[Shakti]]. Within these general divisions are numerous sects and subsects, reflecting different lineages and philosophical schools and traditions (often referred to as "[[sampradaya]]s").

Within the Shaiva sadhus are many subgroups. Most Shaiva sadhus wear a [[Tripundra]] mark on their forehead, dress in saffron, red or orange color clothes, and live a monastic life. Some sadhus such as the [[Aghori]] share the practices of ancient [[Kapalika]]s, where they beg with a skull, smeared their body with ashes from the cremation ground, and experiment with substances or practices that are generally abhorred by society.&lt;ref&gt;Gavin Flood (2008). The Blackwell Companion to Hinduism. John Wiley &amp; Sons, pp. 212‚Äì213, {{ISBN|978-0-470-99868-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David N. Lorenzen (1972). The KƒÅpƒÅlikas and KƒÅlƒÅmukhas: Two Lost ≈öaivite Sects. University of California Press, pp. 4-16, {{ISBN|978-0-520-01842-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Dashanami Sampradaya]] sadhus belong to the [[Smarta Tradition]]. They are said to have been formed by the philosopher and renunciant [[Adi Shankara]], believed to have lived in the 8th century CE, though the full history of the sect's formation is not clear. Among them are the Naga subgroups, naked sadhu known for carrying weapons like tridents, swords, canes, and spears. Said to have once functioned as an armed order to protect Hindus from the Mughal rulers, they were involved in a number of military defence campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;1953: 116; cf. also Farquhar 1925; J. Ghose 1930; Lorenzen 1978&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/view?docId=ft6n39p104&amp;chunk.id=ch09&amp;toc.depth=1&amp;toc.id=ch09&amp;brand=eschol |title=The Wrestler's Body |publisher=Publishing.cdlib.org |accessdate=29 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally in the ambit of non-violence at present, some sections are known to practice [[indian wrestling|wrestling]] and [[Indian martial arts|martial arts]]. Their retreats are still called ''chhaavni'' or armed camps, and mock duels are still sometimes held between them.

Female sadhus (''sadhvi''s) exist in many sects. In many cases, the women that take to the life of renunciation are widows, and these types of sadhvis often live secluded lives in ascetic compounds. Sadhvis are sometimes regarded by some as manifestations or forms of the Goddess, or Devi, and are honoured as such. There have been a number of charismatic sadhvis that have risen to fame as religious teachers in contemporary India‚Äîe.g.,&amp;nbsp;[[Anandamayi Ma]], [[Sarada Devi]], [[Mata Amritanandamayi]], and Karunamayi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.karunamayi.org/|title=Home - Amma Sri Karunamayi|publisher=|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jainism===
The Jain community is traditionally discussed in its texts with four terms: ''sadhu'' (monks), ''sadhvi or aryika'' (nuns), ''sravaka'' (laymen householders) and ''sravika'' (laywomen householders). As in Hinduism and Buddhism, the Jain householders support the monastic community.{{sfn|Jaini|1991|p=xxviii, 180}} The ''sadhus'' and ''sadhvis'' are intertwined with the Jain lay society, perform ''Murtipuja'' (Jina idol worship) and lead festive rituals, and they are organized in a strongly hierarchical monastic structure.&lt;ref name=cort651&gt;{{cite journal | last=Cort | first=John E. | title=The Svetambar Murtipujak Jain Mendicant | journal=Man | publisher=Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland | volume=26 | issue=4 | year=1991 | pages=651‚Äì671 | doi=10.2307/2803774 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are differences between the Digambara and Svetambara sadhus and sadhvi traditions.&lt;ref name="cort651" /&gt; The Digambara sadhus own no clothes as a part of their interpretation of [[Ethics of Jainism|Five vows]], and they live their ascetic austere lives in nakedness. The Digambara sadhvis wear white clothes. The Svetambara sadhus and sadhvis both wear white clothes. According to a 2009 publication by Harvey J. Sindima, Jain monastic community had 6,000 sadhvis of which less than 100 belong to the Digambara tradition and rest to Svetambara.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Harvey J.

==Becoming a sadhu==
[[File:Baba in Kathmandu.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|A Vaishnava sadhu in [[Kathmandu]], with a [[Urdhva Pundra]] mark on his forehead.]]
The processes and rituals of becoming a sadhu vary with sect; in almost all sects, a sadhu is initiated by a guru, who bestows upon the initiate a new name, as well as a mantra, (or sacred sound or phrase), which is generally known only to the sadhu and the guru and may be repeated by the initiate as part of meditative practice.

Becoming a sadhu is a path followed by millions. It is supposed to be the fourth phase in a Hindu's life, after studies, being a father and a pilgrim, but for most it is not a practical option. For a person to become sadhu needs [[vairagya]]. Vairagya means desire to achieve something by leaving the world (cutting familial, societal and earthly attachments).{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

A person who wants to become sadhu must first seek a [[guru]]. There, he or she must perform 'guruseva' which means service. The guru decides whether the person is eligible to take [[sannyasa]] by observing the sisya (the person who wants to become a sadhu or sanyasi). If the person is eligible, ''guru upadesa'' (which means teachings) is done. Only then, the person transforms into sanyasi or sadhu. There are different types of sanyasis in India who follow different sampradya. But, all sadhus have a common goal: attaining [[moksha]] (liberation).{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

==Festive gatherings==
[[File:Indian sadhu performing namaste.jpg|thumb|250px|A sadhu in [[Madurai]], India.]]

[[Kumbh Mela]], a mass-gathering of sadhus from all parts of India, takes place every three years at one of four points along sacred rivers in India, including the holy River [[Ganges]]. In 2007 it was held in Nasik, Maharashtra. Peter Owen-Jones filmed one episode of "Extreme Pilgrim" there during this event. It took place again in Haridwar in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/15/world/asia/15india.html|title=Taking a Sacred Plunge, One Wave of Humanity at a Time|last=Yardley|first=Jim|author2=Kumar, Hari |date=14 April 2010|publisher=[[New York Times]]|accessdate=24 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sadhus of all sects join in this reunion. Millions of non-sadhu pilgrims also attend the festivals, and the [[Kumbh Mela]] is the largest gathering of human beings for a single religious purpose on the planet; the most recent Kumbh Mela started on 14 January 2013, at [[Allahabad]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}} At the festival, sadhus appear in large numbers, including those "completely naked with ash-smeared bodies, [who] sprint into the chilly waters for a dip at the crack of dawn".&lt;ref name=geeta&gt;{{cite news|last=Pandey|first=Geeta|title=Kumbh Mela: 'Eight million' bathers on first day of festival|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-21017217|newspaper=BBC News|date=14 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Second Temple''' ({{lang-he-n|◊ë÷µ÷º◊ô◊™÷æ◊î÷∑◊û÷¥÷º◊ß÷∞◊ì÷∏÷º◊©◊Å ◊î÷∑◊©÷µ÷º◊Å◊†÷¥◊ô}}, ''[[Bet HaMikdash|Beit HaMikdash HaSheni]]'')  was the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Jewish holy temple]] which stood on the [[Temple Mount]] in [[Jerusalem]] during the [[Second Temple period]], between 516 BCE and 70 CE. According to Jewish tradition, it replaced [[Solomon's Temple]] (the First Temple), which was destroyed by the [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]] in 586 BCE, when [[Siege of Jerusalem (587 BC)|Jerusalem was conquered]] and part of the population of the [[Kingdom of Judah]] was taken into [[Babylonian captivity|exile to Babylon]].

The Second Temple was originally a rather modest structure constructed by a number of Jewish exile groups returning to the [[Levant]] from [[Babylon]] under the [[Achaemenid]]-appointed governor [[Zerubbabel]]. However, during the reign of [[Herod the Great]], the Second Temple was completely refurbished, and the original structure was totally overhauled into the large and magnificent edifices and facades that are more recognizable. Much like the Babylonians destroyed the First Temple, the Romans [[Siege of Jerusalem (AD 70)|destroyed the Second Temple]] and Jerusalem in 70 CE as retaliation for [[First Jewish‚ÄìRoman War|an ongoing Jewish revolt]].

[[Jewish eschatology]] includes a belief that the Second Temple will be replaced by a future [[Third Temple]].

==Biblical narrative==
{{main|Second Temple period}}
[[File:105.The Rebuilding of the Temple Is Begun.jpg|thumb|Rebuilding of the Temple (illustration by [[Gustave Dor√©]] from the 1866 ''La Sainte Bible'')]]
The accession of [[Cyrus the Great]] of the [[Achaemenid Empire]] in 559 BCE made the re-establishment of the city of Jerusalem and the rebuilding of the Temple possible.&lt;ref name="Albright 1963"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Biblical Period from Abraham to Ezra: An Historical Survey |last=Albright |first=William |authorlink=William F. Albright |year=1963 |publisher= HarperCollins College Division |isbn= 0-06-130102-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="je"/&gt; According to the closing verses of the [[Books of Chronicles|second book of Chronicles]] and the books of [[Book of Ezra|Ezra]] and [[Book of Nehemiah|Nehemiah]], when the Jewish exiles returned to Jerusalem following a decree from Cyrus the Great ({{Bibleref2|Ezra 1:1‚Äì4}}, {{Bibleref2|2 Chron 36:22‚Äì23}}), construction started at the original site of Solomon's Temple. After a relatively brief halt due to opposition from peoples who had filled the vacuum during the Jewish captivity ({{Bibleref2|Ezra 4}}), work resumed c. 521 BCE under [[Darius I]] ({{Bibleref2|Ezra 5}}) and was completed during the sixth year of his reign (c. 516 BCE), with the temple dedication taking place the following year.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

These events represent the final section in the historical narrative of the [[Hebrew Bible]].&lt;ref name="Albright 1963"/&gt;

The original core of the book of Nehemiah, the first-person memoir, may have been [[Ezra-Nehemiah|combined]] with the core of the [[Book of Ezra]] around 400 BCE. Further editing probably continued into the [[Second Temple period#Hellenistic era|Hellenistic era]].&lt;ref&gt;Paul Cartledge, Peter Garnsey, Erich S. Gruen (editors), ''Hellenistic Constructs: Essays In Culture, History, and Historiography'', p. 92 (University of California Press, 1997). {{ISBN|0-520-20676-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book tells how Nehemiah, at the court of the king in [[Susa]], is informed that Jerusalem is without walls and resolves to restore them. The king appoints him as governor of the province [[Yehud Medinata]] and he travels to Jerusalem. There he rebuilds the walls, despite the opposition of Israel's enemies, and reforms the community in conformity with the [[law of Moses]]. After 12 years in [[Jerusalem]], he returns to [[Susa]] but subsequently revisits Jerusalem. He finds that the Israelites have been [[backsliding]] and taking non-Jewish wives, and he stays in Jerusalem to enforce the Law.

Based on the biblical account, after the return from Babylonian captivity, arrangements were immediately made to reorganize the desolated [[Yehud Province]] after the demise of the [[Kingdom of Judah]] seventy years earlier. The body of pilgrims, forming a band of 42,360,&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|Ezra|2:65|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; having completed the long and dreary journey of some four months, from the banks of the [[Euphrates]] to Jerusalem, were animated in all their proceedings by a strong religious impulse, and therefore one of their first concerns was to restore their ancient house of worship by rebuilding their destroyed Temple&lt;ref name="Temple, the Second"&gt;{{Cite EBD|wstitle=Temple, the Second}}&lt;/ref&gt; and reinstituting the sacrificial rituals known as the ''[[korbanot]]''.

On the invitation of [[Zerubbabel]], the governor, who showed them a remarkable example of liberality by contributing personally 1,000 golden [[Persian daric|daric]]s, besides other gifts, the people poured their gifts into the sacred treasury with great enthusiasm.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Ezra|2|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; First they erected and dedicated the altar of God on the exact spot where it had formerly stood, and they then cleared away the charred heaps of debris which occupied the site of the old temple; and in the second month of the second year (535 BCE), amid great public excitement and rejoicing, the foundations of the Second Temple were laid. A wide interest was felt in this great movement, although it was regarded with mixed feelings by the spectators ({{bibleverse||Haggai|2:3|HE}}, {{bibleverse||Zechariah|4:10|HE}}).&lt;ref name="Temple, the Second"/&gt;

The [[Samaritan]]s wanted to help with this work but Zerubbabel and the elders declined such cooperation, feeling that the Jews must build the Temple unaided. Immediately evil reports were spread regarding the Jews. According to {{Bibleref2|Ezra 4:5}}, the Samaritans sought to "frustrate their purpose" and sent messengers to [[Ecbatana]] and Susa, with the result that the work was suspended.&lt;ref name="Temple, the Second"/&gt;

Seven years later, [[Cyrus the Great]], who allowed the Jews to [[Return to Zion|return]] to their homeland and rebuild the Temple, died ({{bibleverse|2|Chronicles|36:22‚Äì23|HE}}) and was succeeded by his son [[Cambyses]]. On his death, the "false [[Smerdis]]", an impostor, occupied the throne for some seven or eight months, and then [[Darius I of Persia|Darius]] became king (522 BCE). In the second year of his rule the work of rebuilding the temple was resumed and carried forward to its completion ({{bibleverse||Ezra|5:6‚Äì6:15|HE}}), under the stimulus of the earnest counsels and admonitions of the prophets [[Haggai]] and [[Zechariah (Hebrew prophet)|Zechariah]]. It was ready for consecration in the spring of 516 BCE, more than twenty years after the return from captivity. The Temple was completed on the third day of the month [[Adar]], in the sixth year of the reign of Darius, amid great rejoicings on the part of all the people ({{bibleverse||Ezra|6:15,16|HE}}), although it was evident that the Jews were no longer an independent people, but were subject to a foreign power. The [[Book of Haggai]] includes a prediction that the glory of the second temple would be greater than that of the first ({{bibleverse||Haggai|2:9|HE}}).&lt;ref name="Temple, the Second"/&gt;

Some of the original artifacts from the Temple of Solomon are not mentioned in the sources after its destruction in 597 BCE, and are presumed lost. The Second Temple lacked the following holy articles:
* The [[Ark of the Covenant]]&lt;ref name="je"&gt;{{Jewish Encyclopedia |no-prescript=1|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=128&amp;letter=T&amp;search=second|title=Temple, The Second}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Temple, the Second"/&gt; containing the [[Tablets of Stone]], before which were placed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1007197/jewish/Chapter-4.htm|title=Mishneh Torah, Sefer Avodah, Beis Habechirah, Chapter 4, Halacha 1|author=Maimonides|authorlink=Maimonides|accessdate=2013-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; the pot of [[manna]] and [[Aaron's rod]]&lt;ref name="Temple, the Second"/&gt;
* The [[Urim and Thummim]]&lt;ref name="je"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Temple, the Second"/&gt; (divination objects contained in the [[priestly breastplate|Hoshen]])
* The [[Holy anointing oil|holy oil]]&lt;ref name="Temple, the Second"/&gt;
* The sacred fire.&lt;ref name="je"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Temple, the Second"/&gt;

In the Second Temple, the [[Kodesh Hakodashim]] ([[Holy of Holies]]) was separated by curtains rather than a wall as in the First Temple. Still, as in the [[Tabernacle]], the Second Temple included:
* The [[Menorah (Temple)|Menorah]] (golden lamp) for the ''[[Hekhal]]''
* The Table of [[Showbread]]
* The golden [[Altar (Judaism)#Altar of Incense|altar of incense]], with golden [[censer]]s.&lt;ref name="Temple, the Second"/&gt;

According to the [[Mishnah]] (''[[Middot (Talmud)|Middot]]'' iii. 6), the "[[Foundation Stone]]" stood where the Ark used to be, and the [[High Priest (Judaism)|High Priest]] put his censer on it on [[Yom Kippur]].&lt;ref name="je"/&gt;

The Second Temple also included many of the original vessels of gold that had been taken by the [[Babylonians]] but restored by [[Cyrus the Great]].&lt;ref name="Temple, the Second"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref|Ezra|1:7‚Äì11}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Babylonian Talmud]] (''[[Yoma]]'' 22b),&lt;ref name="je"/&gt; however, the Temple lacked the ''[[Shekinah]]'', the dwelling or settling divine presence of God, and the ''[[Ruach HaKodesh]]'', the Spirit of Holiness, present in the first.

==Rabbinical literature==
Traditional [[rabbinic literature]] state that the Second Temple stood for 420 years and based on the 2nd-century work ''[[Seder Olam Rabbah]]'', placed construction in [[350s BC|350 BCE]] (3408 [[Anno Mundi|AM]]), [[Missing years (Jewish calendar)|166 years later than secular estimates]], and destruction in 70 CE (3829 [[Anno Mundi|AM]]).&lt;ref&gt;Goldwurm, Hersh.

The fifth order, or division, of the [[Mishnah]], known as [[Kodashim]], provides detailed descriptions and discussions of the religious laws connected with [[Temple in Jerusalem#Temple services|Temple service]] including the [[korban|sacrifices]], the Temple and its furnishings, as well as [[Kohen|the priests]] who carried out the duties and ceremonies of its service. [[Masekhet|Tractates]] of the order deal with the sacrifices of animals, birds, and [[Gift offering|meal offerings]], the laws of bringing a sacrifice, such as the [[sin offering]] and the [[guilt offering]], and the laws of misappropriation of sacred property. In addition, the order contains a description of the Second Temple ([[Masekhet|tractate]] [[Middot (Talmud)|Middot]]), and a description and rules about the daily sacrifice service in the Temple ([[Masekhet|tractate]] [[Tamid]]).&lt;ref name=Birnbaum&gt;{{cite book|title=A Book of Jewish Concepts|last=Birnbaum|first=Philip |chapter=Kodashim|year=1975|publisher=Hebrew Publishing Company|location=New York, NY|isbn=088482876X|pages=541‚Äì542}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Soncino"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Epstein|editor1-first=Isidore|editor-link=Isidore Epstein|others=Singer, M.H.

==Rededication by the Maccabees==
Following the conquest of [[Judea]] by [[Alexander the Great]], it became part of the [[Ptolemaic Kingdom]] of Egypt until 200 BCE, when King [[Antiochus III the Great]] of Syria defeated King [[Ptolemy V Epiphanes]] of Egypt at the [[Battle of Panium|Battle of Paneion]].&lt;ref&gt;De Bellis Antiquitatis (DBA) [http://www.fanaticus.org/DBA/battles/panion200bc.html The Battle of Panion (200 BC)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091223040459/http://www.fanaticus.org/DBA/battles/panion200bc.html |date=2009-12-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Judea became at that moment part of the [[Seleucid empire]] of Syria. When the Second Temple in Jerusalem was looted and its religious services stopped, [[Judaism]] was effectively outlawed. In 167 BCE, [[Antiochus IV Epiphanes]] ordered an altar to [[Zeus]] erected in the Temple. He also banned [[Religious male circumcision|circumcision]] and ordered pigs to be sacrificed at the altar of the Temple.&lt;ref&gt;[http://old.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0148:book=1:section=31 Flavius Josephus, The Wars of the Jews]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} ''Jewish War'' i. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[Maccabean Revolt]] against the Seleucid empire, the Second Temple was rededicated and became the religious pillar of the Jewish [[Hasmonean kingdom]], as well as culturally associated with the Jewish holiday of [[Hanukkah]].

==Hasmonean dynasty and Roman conquest==
There is some evidence from archaeology that further changes to the structure of the Temple and its surroundings were made during the Hasmonean rule. [[Salome Alexandra]], the queen of Hasmonean Kingdom appointed her elder son [[Hyrcanus II]] as the [[High Priest of Israel|high priest of Judaea]]. Her younger son [[Aristobulus II]] was determined to have the throne, and as soon as she died he seized the throne. Hyrcanus, who was in line to be the king, agreed to be contented with being the high priest. [[Antipater the Idumaean|Antipater]], the governor of Idum√¶a, encouraged Hyrcanus not to give up his throne. Eventually Hyrcanus fled to [[Aretas III]], king of the [[Nabateans]], and returned with an army to take back the throne. He defeated Aristobulus and besieged Jerusalem. The [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] general [[Pompey]], who was in Syria fighting against the [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Armenians]] in the [[Third Mithridatic War]], sent his lieutenant to investigate the conflict in Judaea. Both Hyrcanus and Aristobulus appealed to him for support. Pompey was not diligent in making a decision about this which caused Aristobulus to march off. He was pursued by Pompey and surrendered but his followers closed Jerusalem to Pompey's forces. The Romans [[Siege of Jerusalem (63 BC)|besieged]] and took the city in 63 BCE. The priests continued with the religious practices inside the Temple during the siege. The temple was not looted or harmed by the Romans. Pompey himself, perhaps inadvertently, went into the [[Holy of Holies]] and the next day ordered the priests to repurify the Temple and resume the religious practices.&lt;ref name= "Lester2010"&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/?id=i89-9fdNUcAC&amp;pg=PA20&amp;lpg=PA20|title= An Introduction to Second Temple Judaism: History and Religion of the Jews in the Time of Nehemiah, the Maccabees, Hillel, and Jesus|author= [[Lester L.

==Herod's Temple==
[[File:Jerus-n4i.jpg|right|thumb|This picture shows the temple as imagined in 1966 in the [[Holyland Model of Jerusalem]].]]
Reconstruction of the temple under [[Herod the Great|Herod]] began with a massive expansion of the Temple Mount.&lt;ref&gt;Herod's work on the Temple is generally dated from 20/19 BCE until 12/11 or 10 BCE. Mahieu (''Between Rome and Jerusalem'', OLA 208, Leuven: Peeters, 2012, pp. 147-165) begins the work on the Temple enclosures in 25 BCE, that on the Temple building in 19 BCE, and situates the dedication of both in November 18 BCE.&lt;/ref&gt; Religious worship and temple rituals continued during the construction process.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Secrets of Jerusalem's Temple Mount, [[Leen Ritmeyer]], Kathleen Ritmeyer, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; When the Roman emperor [[Caligula]] planned to place his own statue inside the temple, Herod's grandson [[Agrippa I]] was able to intervene and convince him against this.

===Construction===

&lt;/gallery&gt;
Herod's Temple was one of the larger construction projects of the 1st century BCE.&lt;ref name="Flavius Josephus: The Jewish War"&gt;Flavius Josephus: The Jewish War&lt;/ref&gt; Josephus records that Herod was interested in perpetuating his name through building projects, that his construction programs were extensive and paid for by heavy taxes, but that his masterpiece was the Temple of Jerusalem.&lt;ref name="Flavius Josephus: The Jewish War"/&gt;

The old temple built by [[Zerubbabel]] was replaced by a magnificent edifice. An agreement was made between Herod and the Jewish religious authorities: the sacrificial rituals, called [[korbanot|offerings]], were to be continued unabated for the entire time of construction, and the Temple itself would be constructed by the priests. Later the Exodus 30:13 [[sanctuary shekel]] was reinstituted to support the temple as the [[temple tax]].

===Platform===
[[Moriah|Mt. Moriah]] had a plateau at the northern end, and steeply declined on the southern slope. It was Herod's plan that the entire mountain be turned into a giant square platform. The Temple Mount was originally intended to be 1600 feet wide by 900 feet broad by 9 stories high, with walls up to 16 feet thick, but had never been finished. To complete it, a trench was dug around the mountain, and huge stone "bricks" were laid.  Some of these weighed well over 100 tons, [[Western Stone|the largest]] measuring 44.6 feet by 11 feet by 16.5 feet and weighing approximately 567 to 628 tons,&lt;ref&gt;The History Channel cited the 16.5 depth 567 ton estimate in "Lost Worlds of King Herod"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dan Bahat: Touching the Stones of our Heritage, Israeli ministry of Religious Affairs, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; while most were in the range of 2.5 by 3.5 by 15 feet (approximately 28 tons). King Herod had architects from Greece, Rome and Egypt plan the construction. The blocks were presumably quarried by using pickaxes to create channels. Then they hammered in wooden beams and flushed them with water to force them out. Once they were removed, they were carved into precise squares and numbered at the quarry to show where they would be installed. The final carving would have been done by using harder stones to grind or chisel them to create precise joints. They would have been transported using oxen and specialized carts. Since the quarry was uphill from the temple they had gravity on their side but care needed to be taken to control the descent. Final installation would have been done using pulleys or [[Roman crane|cranes]]. Roman pulleys and cranes weren't strong enough to lift the blocks alone so they may have used multiple cranes and levers to position them.&lt;ref&gt;"Modern Marvels: Bible tech" History channel&lt;/ref&gt; As the mountainside began to rise, the western side was carved away to a vertical wall and bricks were carved to create a virtual continuation of the brick face, which was continued for a while until the northern slope reached ground level. Part of the Antonian hill to the north of Moriah was annexed to the complex and the area between was filled up with landfill.

The project began with the building of giant underground vaults upon which the temple would be built so it could be larger than the small flat area on top of Mount Moriah. Ground level at the time was at least 20&amp;nbsp;ft. (6m) below the current level, as can be seen by walking the [[Western Wall]] tunnels. Legend has it that the construction of the entire complex lasted only three years, but other sources such as [[Josephus]] say that it took far longer, although the Temple itself may have taken that long. During a Passover visit by Jesus the Jews replied that it had been under construction for 46 years.&lt;ref&gt;Gospel of John 2:20&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible that the complex was only a few years completed when the future Emperor [[Titus]] destroyed the Temple in 70 CE.

===Court of the Gentiles===
This area was primarily a bazaar, with vendors selling souvenirs, sacrificial animals, food, as well as currency changers, exchanging Roman for [[Tyrian shekel|Tyrian]] money because the Jews were not allowed to coin their own money and they viewed Roman currency as an abomination to the Lord,&lt;ref&gt;Beasley-Murray, G. (1999). Word biblical commentary: John (2 ed., Vol. 36). Nashville, Tennessee: Thomas Nelson.&lt;/ref&gt; as also mentioned in the New Testament account of [[Jesus and the Money Changers]] when Jerusalem was packed with Jews who had come for Passover, perhaps numbering 300,000 to 400,000 [[pilgrims]].&lt;ref&gt;[[E. P. Sanders|Sanders, E. P.]] The historical figure of Jesus. Penguin, 1993. p. 249&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "ActJ"&gt;[[Robert W. Funk|Funk, Robert W.]] and the [[Jesus Seminar]]. ''The acts of Jesus: the search for the authentic deeds of Jesus.'' HarperSanFrancisco. 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Guides that provided tours of the premises were also available. Jewish males had the unique opportunity to be shown inside the temple itself.

The [[Kohanim|priests]], in their white linen robes and tubular hats, were everywhere, directing pilgrims and advising them on what kinds of sacrifices were to be performed.

Behind them, as they entered the Court of the Gentiles from the south through the [[Huldah Gates]], was the Royal Porch, which contained a marketplace, administrative quarters, and a synagogue. On the upper floors, the [[Zugot|great Jewish sages]] held court, priests and [[Levites]] performed various chores, and from there, tourists were able to observe the events. The Royal Porch is widely accepted to be part of Herod's work; however, recent archaeological finds in the Western Wall tunnels suggest that it was built in the first century during the reign of Agripas, as opposed to the first century BCE,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.antiquities.org.il/Article_eng.aspx?sec_id=25&amp;subj_id=240&amp;id=1882&amp;hist=1|title=Israel Antiquities Authority|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the theory that Herod began the extension and the Royal Porch is based mainly on Josephus's possibly politically motivated claim. During Herod's reign the porch was not yet open to the public.

To the east of the court was [[Solomon's Porch]], and to the north, the ''soreg'', the "middle wall of separation",&lt;ref&gt;In verse 14 of {{bibleref2|Ephesians|2:11‚Äì18|9|Ephesians 2:11‚Äì18}}&lt;/ref&gt; a stone wall separating the public area from the inner sanctuary where only Jews could enter, described as being 3 cubits high by Josephus (Wars 5.5.2 [3b] 6.2.4).

===Pinnacle===
The accounts of [[Jesus|Jesus's]] [[Temptations of Christ|temptations]] in [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]]'s and [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]]'s gospels both suggest that the Second Temple had one or more [[pinnacle]]s ({{lang-gr|œÑŒø œÄœÑŒµœÅœÖŒ≥ŒπŒøŒΩ œÑŒøœÖ ŒπŒµœÅŒøœÖ}}):
{{quote|Then he {{bracket|[[Satan]]}} brought Him to Jerusalem, set Him on the pinnacle of the temple, and said to Him, "If You are the Son of God, throw Yourself down from here."&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Luke|4:9|NKJV}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
The Greek word used here is pterugion, which literally means a little wing, or by extension anything like a wing such as a battlement or parapet.&lt;ref&gt;Strong‚Äôs Concordance 4419&lt;/ref&gt; The archaeologist Benjamin Mazar thought it referred to the southeast corner of the Temple overlooking the Kidron Valley.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Mazar,The Mountain of the Lord, Doubleday;1975, p 149&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inside the Soreg===
According to Josephus, there were ten entrances into the inner courts, four on the south, four on the north, one on the east and one leading east to west from the Court of Women to the court of the Israelites, named the Nicanor Gate.&lt;ref&gt;Josephus, War 5.5.2; 198; m. Mid. 1.4&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- The following text seems to have gotten scrambled--&gt; The gates were: On the south side (going from west to east) the Fuel Gate, the Firstling Gate, the Water Gate. On the north side, from west to east, are the Jeconiah Gate, the Offering Gate, the Women's Gate and the Song Gate. On the Eastern side, the Nicanor gate, which is where most Jewish visitors entered. A few pieces of the Soreg have survived to the present day.

Within this area was the [[Court of the women|Court of the Women]], open to all Jews, male and female. Even a ritually unclean [[Kohen|Cohen]] could enter to perform various housekeeping duties. There was also a place for lepers (considered ritually unclean), as well as a ritual barbershop for [[Nazirites]]. In this, the largest of the temple courts, one could see constant dancing, singing and music.

Only men were allowed to enter the Court of the Israelites, where they could observe sacrifices of the high priest in the Court of the Priests. The Court of the Priests was reserved for Levite priests.

===Temple sanctuary===
[[File:The rock of the Dome of the Rock Corrected.jpg|thumb|The ''[[Foundation Stone]]'' under the Dome of the Rock, a possible historical location for the Kodesh Hakodashim]]
Between the entrance of the building and the curtain veiling the [[Kadosh Hakadashim|Holy of Holies]] were the famous vessels of the temple: the [[Menorah (Temple)|menorah]], the incense-burning altar, and various other implements.

==Pilgrimages==

Jews from distant parts of the Roman Empire would arrive by boat at the port of [[Jaffa]] (now part of [[Tel Aviv]]), where they would join a caravan for the three-day trek to the Holy City and would then find lodgings in one of the many hotels or hostelries. Then they changed some of their money from the [[Sacred‚Äìprofane dichotomy|profane]] standard [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] currency for [[Shekel|Jewish]] and [[Tyrian shekel|Tyrian money]], the latter two considered religious.&lt;ref name = "Sanders"&gt;Sanders, E. P. The historical figure of Jesus. Penguin, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "JInt"&gt;[[Bart D. Ehrman|Ehrman, Bart D.]]. [[Jesus, Interrupted]], HarperCollins, 2009. {{ISBN|0-06-117393-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pilgrims would purchase sacrificial animals, usually a pigeon or a lamb, in preparation for the following day's events.

The first thing pilgrims would do would be to approach the public entrance on the south side of the Temple Mount complex. They would check their animals, then visit a [[mikveh]], where they would [[Ritual purification|ritually cleanse and purify]] themselves. The pilgrims would then retrieve their sacrificial animals, and head to the Huldah gates. After ascending a staircase three stories in height, and passing through the gate, the pilgrims would find themselves in the Court of the Gentiles.

{{Main|Siege of Jerusalem (AD 70)}}
In 66 CE the Jewish population [[First Jewish‚ÄìRoman War|rebelled]] against the Roman Empire. Four years later, on 4 August 70 CE&lt;ref&gt;Roman Calendar 70 CE http://www.cgsf.org/dbeattie/calendar/?roman=70 [http://www.cgsf.org/dbeattie/calendar/?roman=70]&lt;/ref&gt; (Tisha B'Av - 9th Day of Av) or 30 August 70 CE,&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Bunson [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=HsrGEFpW80UC&amp;pg=PA212 A Dictionary of the Roman Empire p.212]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roman legions]] under [[Titus]] retook and destroyed much of Jerusalem and the Second Temple. The [[Arch of Titus]], in [[Rome]] and built to commemorate Titus's victory in [[Iudaea Province|Judea]], depicts a Roman [[Roman triumph|victory procession]] with soldiers carrying spoils from the Temple, including the [[Menorah (Temple)|Menorah]]. According to an inscription on the Colosseum, Emperor [[Vespasian]] built the Colosseum with war spoils in 79 CE‚Äîpossibly from the spoils of the Second Temple.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1311985/Colosseum-built-with-loot-from-sack-of-Jerusalem-temple.html|title=Colosseum 'built with loot from sack of Jerusalem temple'|first=By Bruce Johnston in|last=Rome|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sects of Judaism that had their base in the Temple dwindled in importance, including the [[Priesthood (Ancient Israel)|priesthood]] and the [[Sadducees]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Alf√∂ldy|first=G√©za |title=Eine Bauinschrift aus dem Colosseum |journal=[[Zeitschrift f√ºr Papyrologie und Epigraphik]] |year=1995|volume=109|pages=195‚Äì226 |jstor=20189648 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The destruction date according to the [[Hebrew calendar]] was the 9th of [[Av]], also known as [[Tisha B'Av]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aish.com/h/9av/oal/96779149.html?s=mpw|title=Tisha B'Av ‚Äì Ninth of Av|last=Simmons|first=Shraga|authorlink=Shraga Simmons|accessdate=2013-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Temple was on the site of what today is the [[Dome of the Rock]]. The gates let out close to [[Al-Aqsa Mosque]] (which came much later).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Although Jews continued to inhabit the destroyed city, Emperor [[Hadrian]] established a new city called [[Aelia Capitolina]]. At the end of the [[Bar Kokhba revolt]] in 135 CE, many of the Jewish communities were massacred and Jews were banned from living inside Jerusalem. A pagan [[Roman temple]] was set up on the former site of Herod's Temple.&lt;ref name= "Lester2010"/&gt;

==Archaeology==
{{refimprove|section|date=August 2018}}
In 1871, a hewn stone measuring 60 √ó 90&amp;nbsp;cm. and engraved with Greek uncials was discovered near a court on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem and identified by [[Charles Simon Clermont-Ganneau]] as being the [[Temple Warning inscription]]. The stone inscription outlined the prohibition extended unto those who were not of the Jewish nation to proceed beyond the ''soreg'' separating the larger Court of the Gentiles and the inner courts. The inscription read in seven lines:
{{poemquote|{{lang|grc|ŒúŒóŒüŒïŒùŒëŒëŒõŒõŒüŒìŒïŒùŒóŒïŒôŒ£Œ†Œü
Œ°ŒïŒ•ŒïŒ£ŒüŒëŒôŒïŒùŒ§ŒüŒ£Œ§ŒüŒ•Œ†Œï
Œ°ŒôŒ§ŒüŒôŒïŒ°ŒüŒùŒ§Œ°Œ•Œ¶ŒëŒöŒ§ŒüŒ•ŒöŒëŒô

Œ§ŒëŒôŒîŒôŒëŒ§ŒüŒïŒûŒëŒöŒüŒõŒüŒ•
ŒòŒïŒôŒùŒòŒëŒùŒëŒ§ŒüŒù}}}}
Translation: "Let no foreigner enter within the parapet and the partition which surrounds the Temple precincts. Anyone caught [violating] will be held accountable for his ensuing death." Today, the stone is preserved in Istanbul's Museum of Antiquities.

In 1936 a fragment of a similar Temple warning inscription was found.

After 1967, archaeologists found that the wall extended all the way around the Temple Mount and is part of the city wall near the [[Lions' Gate]]. Thus, the Western Wall is not the only remaining part of the [[Temple Mount]]. Currently, Robinson's Arch (named after American [[Edward Robinson (scholar)|Edward Robinson]]) remains as the beginning of an arch that spanned the gap between the top of the platform and the higher ground farther away. This had been used by the priests as an entrance. Commoners had entered through the still-extant, but now plugged, gates on the southern side which led through [[colonnade]]s to the top of the platform. One of these colonnades is still extant and reachable through the Temple Mount. The [[Southern wall]] was designed as a grand entrance. Recent archeological digs have found thousands of ''[[mikveh]]s'' (ceremonial bathtubs) for the ritual purification of the worshipers, and a grand stairway leading to the now blocked entrance. Inside the walls, the platform was supported by a series of vaulted archways, now called [[Solomon's Stables]], which still exist and whose current renovation by the ''[[Jerusalem Islamic Waqf|Waqf]]'' is extremely controversial. The temple was constructed of imported white marble that gleamed in the daylight.

On September 25, 2007, [[Yuval Baruch]], [[archaeologist]] with the [[Israeli Antiquities Authority]] announced the discovery of a quarry compound which may have provided King Herod with the stones to build his Temple on the [[Temple Mount]]. Coins, pottery and an iron stake found proved the date of the quarrying to be about 19 BCE. &lt;!-- How? --&gt; Archaeologist [[Ehud Netzer]] confirmed that the large outlines of the stone cuts is evidence that it was a massive public project worked by hundreds of slaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gaffney |first=Sean |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2007-09-24-1382898922_x.htm |title=USATODAY.com, Report: Herod's Temple quarry found |publisher=Usatoday.com |date=2007-09-24 |accessdate=2013-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Magdala stone]] is thought to be a representation of the Second Temple carved before its destruction in the year 70.&lt;ref name=Kershner&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kershner|first1=Isabel|title=A Carved Stone Block Upends Assumptions About Ancient Judaism|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/09/world/middleeast/magdala-stone-israel-judaism.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;module=second-column-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news|accessdate=9 December 2015|publisher=[[New York Times]]|date=8 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Second Temple Judaism==
{{main|Second Temple Judaism}}
The period between the construction of the Second Temple in 515 BCE and its destruction by the Romans in 70 CE witnessed major historical upheavals and significant religious changes that would affect most subsequent [[Abrahamic religions|Abrahamic]] religions. The origins of the [[Development of the Hebrew Bible canon|authority of scripture]], of the [[Noahide Law|centrality of law and morality in religion]], of the [[synagogue]] and of [[Jewish eschatology|apocalyptic expectations for the future]] all developed in the [[Judaism]] of this period.

[[File:Shankha with rosette.jpg|thumb|A Shankha (conch shell) with Vishnu emblem carved.]]
A '''Shankha''' is a [[conch]] [[Gastropod shell|shell]] of ritual and religious importance in [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]]. It is the shell of a large predatory sea snail, ''[[Turbinella pyrum]]'', found in the [[Indian Ocean]].{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

In [[Hindu mythology]], the shankha is a sacred [[emblem]] of the Hindu preserver god [[Vishnu]]. It is still used as a [[trumpet]] in Hindu ritual, and in the past was used as a war trumpet. The shankha is praised in Hindu scriptures as a giver of fame, longevity and prosperity, the cleanser of sin and the abode of goddess [[Lakshmi]], who is the goddess of wealth and consort of [[Vishnu]].{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

The shankha is displayed in [[Hindu art]] in association with Vishnu. As a symbol of water, it is associated with female fertility and serpents ([[NƒÅga]]s). The shankha is the state emblem of the Indian state of [[Seal of Kerala|Kerala]] and was also the national emblems of the Indian [[princely state]] of [[Travancore]], and the [[Kingdom of Cochin]].{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

The shankha is one of the eight auspicious symbols of [[Buddhism]], the [[Ashtamangala]], and represents the pervasive sound of Buddhism.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

A powder made from the shell material is used in [[ayurveda]] as a treatment for stomach ailments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ayurtimes.com/shankh-shankha-bhasma/|title=Shankh (Shankha) Bhasma|access-date=2016-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Western world]], in the [[English language]], the shell of this species is known as the "divine conch" or the "sacred chank". It may also be simply called a "chank" or conch. The more common form of this shell is known as "left-turning" in a religious context, although scientists would call it "dextral". A very rarely encountered form has reverse coiling which is called "right-turning" in a religious context, but is known as "sinistral" or left-coiling in a scientific context.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

==Characteristics==
This [[gastropod shell|shell]] is from a [[sea snail]] species ''[[Turbinella pyrum]]'' in the family [[Turbinellidae]]. This species is found living in the Indian Ocean and surrounding seas. The shell is porcelaneous (i.e. the surface of the shell is strong, hard, shiny, and somewhat translucent, like [[porcelain]]).{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

The overall shape of the main body of the shell is oblong or conical. In the oblong form, it has a protuberance in the middle, but tapers at each end. The upper portion (the [[Siphon (mollusc)|siphonal canal]]) is corkscrew-shaped, while the lower end (the [[Spire (mollusc)|spire]]) is twisted and tapering. Its colour is dull, and the surface is hard, brittle and translucent. Like all snail shells, the interior is hollow. The inner surfaces of the shell are very shiny, but the outer surface exhibits high tuberculation.&lt;ref name= Nadkarni&gt;{{Cite book|last= Nadkarni |first= K. M. |title= Dr. K. M.

===Types===
Based on its direction of coiling, the shankha has two varieties:&lt;ref name= Mookerji&gt;{{Cite book|last= Mookerji |first= Bhudeb |title= The wealth of Indian alchemy &amp; its medicinal uses: being an...|volume = 1| work=Shankh| page=195| accessdate=2009-12-21| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aWxGAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=Shankha&amp;dq=Shankha&amp;lr=&amp;ei=c20cS4eCMYGQkATM4PycDA|publisher= Sri Satguru|year=1998|isbn=81-7030-580-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= Thottam &gt;{{Cite book|last= Thottam |first= Dr. P.J. |title= Modernising Ayurveda|work=Shankh|pages=38‚Äì39|accessdate=2009-12-21|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JdsQSIX5WH8C&amp;pg=PA38&amp;dq=Shankha&amp;lr=&amp;ei=emkcS6F6obKQBLGBmYcM#v=onepage&amp;q=Shankha&amp;f=false

====Significance of the ''Dakshinavarta shankha''====
*A [[Dakshinavarti Shankh]]: This is the very rare sinistral form of the species, where the shell coils or whorls expand in a counterclockwise spiral if viewed from the apex of the shell.
*The ''Vamavarta'' ("left-turned" as viewed with the aperture uppermost): This is the very commonly occurring dextral form of the species, where the shell coils or whorls expand in a clockwise spiral when viewed from the apex of the shell. In Hinduism, a ''dakshinavarta shankha'' symbolizes infinite space and is associated with Vishnu. The ''Vamavarta shankha'' represents the reversal of the laws of nature and is linked with [[Shiva]].&lt;ref name = "J43"&gt;Jansen p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Dakshinavarta shankha'' is believed to be the abode of the wealth goddess [[Lakshmi]] - the consort of Vishnu, and hence this type of shankha is considered ideal for medicinal use. It is a very rare variety from the [[Indian Ocean]]. This type of shankha has three to seven ridges visible on the edge of the [[aperture (mollusc)|aperture]] and on the [[columella (mollusc)|columella]] and has a special internal structure. The right spiral of this type reflects the motion of the planets. It is also compared with the hair whorls on [[the Buddha]]'s head that spiral to the right. The long white curl between Buddha's eyebrows and the conch-like swirl of his navel are also akin to this shankha.&lt;ref name= Thottam/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.navaratna-museum.info/Shells.html|title=Sri Navaratna Museum of Natural Wonders|accessdate=2009-12-21|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091206204802/http://navaratna-museum.info/Shells.html|archivedate=2009-12-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Varaha Purana]]'' tells that bathing with the ''Dakshinavarta shankha'' frees one from sin. [[Skanda Purana]] narrates that bathing Vishnu with this shankha grants freedom from sins of seven previous lives. A ''Dakshinavarta shankha ''is considered to be a rare "jewel" or ''ratna'' and is adorned with great virtues. It is also believed to grant longevity, fame and wealth proportional to its shine, whiteness and largeness. Even if such a shankha has a defect, mounting it in gold is believed to restore the virtues of the shankha.&lt;ref name= aiyar/&gt;

==Uses==
[[File:Hindu priest blowing conch during punja.jpg|thumb|right|Hindu priest blowing a shankha during a [[Puja (Hinduism)|''puja'']]]]
In its earliest references, shankha is mentioned as a [[trumpet]] and in this form it became an emblem of Vishnu. Simultaneously, it was used as a votive offering and as a charm to keep away the dangers of the sea. It was the earliest known sound-producing agency as manifestation of sound, and the other elements came later, hence it is regarded as the original of the elements. It is identified with the elements themselves.&lt;ref name= Krishna&gt;{{Cite book|last= Krishna |first= Nanditha|title= The art and iconography of Vishnu-Narayana|work=Shankh|pages=31, 36 and 39|accessdate=2009-12-21|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ahrqAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Shankha&amp;dq=Shankha&amp;lr=&amp;ei=emkcS6F6obKQBLGBmYcM|publisher= D.B.

To make a trumpet or wind instrument, one drills a hole near the tip of the [[apex (mollusc)|apex]] of the shankha. When air is blown through this hole, it travels through the whorls of the shankha, producing a loud, sharp, shrill sound. This sound is the reason the shankha was used as a war trumpet, to summon helpers and friends. Shanka continued to be used in battles for a long time. The sound it produced was called ''shankanad''.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

Nowadays, the shankha is blown at the time of worship in Hindu temples and homes, especially in the ritual of the Hindu ''[[aarti]]'', when light is offered to the deities. The shankha is also used to bathe images of deities, especially Vishnu, and for ritual purification. No hole is drilled for these purposes, though the aperture is cut clean or rarely the whorls are cut to represent five consecutive shells with five mouths.&lt;ref name="mitra"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rajendralala Mitra|title=Indo-aryans|series=285-8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V8KoGspmBGgC&amp;pg=PA287&amp;dq=sankha&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;cd=44#v=onepage&amp;q=sankha&amp;f=false | isbn=978-1-4067-2769-2 | year=2006 | publisher=Read Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= Avtar&gt;{{Cite book|last= Avtar |first= Ram |title= Musical instruments of India: history and development|work=Shankh|pages=41, 42|accessdate=2009-12-21|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lL3oAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=Shankha&amp;dq=Shankha&amp;lr=&amp;ei=c20cS4eCMYGQkATM4PycDA|publisher= Pankaj Publications |year=1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shankha is used as a material for making bangles, bracelets and other objects.&lt;ref name="mitra"/&gt; Because of its aquatic origin and resemblance to the [[vulva]], it has become an integral part of the [[Tantra|Tantric]] rites. In view of this, its symbolism is also said to represent female fertility. Since water itself is a fertility symbol, shankha, which is an aquatic product, is recognised as symbolic of female fertility. In ancient [[Greece]], shells, along with [[pearl]]s, are mentioned as denoting sexual love and marriage, and also mother goddesses.&lt;ref name= Krishna/&gt;

Different magic and sorcery items are also closely connected with this trumpet. This type of device existed long before the [[Buddha|Buddhist]] era.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

India's Shankaracharya Roopnand Saraswati believes that such a conch is also known as greedy by tracing gold, diamonds and treasures like diamonds. Some such conch shells were stolen from the Mahakalal temple in Ujjain in 2014, which was bought by a German company for 12 crores, which, when it was found, the Indian government brought the conch into India by having a case on that company.

===Ayurveda===
Shankha is used in [[Ayurveda]] medicinal formulations to treat many ailments. It is prepared as conch shell ash, known in Sanskrit as ''shankha [[bhasma]]'', which is prepared by soaking the shell in lime juice and calcinating in covered crucibles, 10 to 12 times, and finally reducing it to powder ash.&lt;ref name= Nadkarni/&gt; Shankha bhasma contains calcium, iron and magnesium and is considered to possess antacid and digestive properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lakshmi Chandra Mishra|title=Scientific basis for Ayurvedic therapies |page=96|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qo0VPGr0RF4C&amp;pg=PT120&amp;dq=sankha&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;cd=57#v=onepage&amp;q=sankha&amp;f=false | isbn=978-0-8493-1366-0 | year=2004 | publisher=CRC Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A compound pill called ''shankavati'' is also prepared for use in [[dyspepsia]]. In this case, the procedure followed is to mix ''shankha bhasma'' with [[tamarind]] seed ash, five salts ([[panchlavana]]), [[asafoetida]], [[ammonium chloride]], [[black pepper|pepper]], [[carui]], [[caraway]], [[ginger]], [[long pepper]], purified [[mercury (element)|mercury]] and [[aconitine|aconite]] in specified proportions.

==Significance==
[[File:Travancore State Flag.png|thumb|A sacred shankha on the flag of [[Travancore]], [[India]]]]
The sound of the shankha symbolises the sacred ''[[Om]]'' sound. Vishnu holding the conch represents him as the god of sound. [[Brahma Vaivarta Purana]] declares that shankha is the residence of both Lakshmi and Vishnu, bathing by the waters led through a shankha is considered as like bathing with all holy waters at once. [[Sankha Sadma Purana]] declares that bathing an image of Vishnu with cow milk is as virtuous as performing a million ''[[yajna]]s'' (fire sacrifices), and bathing Vishnu with [[Ganges]] river water frees one from the cycle of births. It further says "while the mere sight of the conch (shankha) dispels all sins as the Sun dispels the fog, why talk of its worship?"&lt;ref name="aiyar"&gt;{{cite book|last=Aiyar V.AK|title=Symbolism In Hinduism|pages=283‚Äì6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kMqD8YrB23QC&amp;pg=PA283&amp;dq=sankha&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;cd=37#v=onepage&amp;q=sankha&amp;f=false | isbn=978-81-7597-149-3 | publisher=Chinmaya Mission}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Padma Purana]] asserts the same effect of bathing Vishnu by Ganges water and milk and further adds doing so avoids evil, pouring water from a shankha on one's own head before a Vishnu image is equivalent to bathing in the pious Ganges river.&lt;ref name="mitra"/&gt;

In [[Buddhism]], the conch shell has been incorporated as one of the eight auspicious symbols, also called ''[[Ashtamangala]]''. The right-turning white conch shell ({{bo|t=‡Ωë‡Ω¥‡ΩÑ‡ºã‡ΩÇ‡æ±‡Ω¶‡ºã‡Ω†‡ΩÅ‡æ±‡Ω≤‡Ω£|w=dung gyas 'khyil}}), represents the elegant, deep, melodious, interpenetrating and pervasive sound of Buddhism, which awakens disciples from the deep slumber of ignorance and urges them to accomplish their own welfare and the welfare of others.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

Shankha was the Royal State Emblem of [[Travancore]] and also figured on the Royal Flag of the [[Jaffna kingdom]]. It is also the election symbol of the Indian political party [[Biju Janata Dal]].{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

Shankha is one of the main attributes of Vishnu. Vishnu's images, either in sitting or standing posture, show him holding the shankha usually in his left upper hand, while ''[[Sudarshana Chakra]]'' (''chakra'' - discus), [[Kaumodaki|''gada'']] (mace) and ''[[padma]]'' (lotus flower) decorate his upper right, the lower left and lower right hands, respectively.&lt;ref name=sacred&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.religiousportal.com/SacredShankha.html|title=Sacred Shankha (Conch Shell)|accessdate=2009-12-21|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070702120045/http://www.religiousportal.com/SacredShankha.html|archivedate=2007-07-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shankar Raju|author2=Kampar, Tulasƒ´dƒÅsa |title= A comparative study of Kamba Ramayanam and Tulasi Ramayan| work=Shank| pages=44,148| accessdate=2009-12-21| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=okVXAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Shankha&amp;dq=Shankha&amp;lr=&amp;ei=emkcS6F6obKQBLGBmYcM|publisher= University of Madras|year=1971}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the great Mahabharata war, Krishna, as the charioteer of the [[Pandava]] prince and a protagonist of the epic - [[Arjuna]] - resounds the Panchajanya to declare war. Panchajanya in Sanskrit means 'having control over the five classes of beings'.&lt;ref name= Avtar/&gt; All five Pandava brothers are described having their own shankhas. [[Yudhishthira]], [[Bhima]], Arjuna, [[Nakula]] and [[Sahadeva]] are described to possess shankhas named Ananta-Vijaya, Poundra-Khadga, Devadatta, Sughosha and Mani-pushpaka, respectively.&lt;ref name= aiyar/&gt;

==Association with NƒÅgas==
Because of the association of the shankha with water, [[nƒÅga]]s are often named after the shankha. The list of NƒÅgas in the ''[[Mahabharata]]'', the ''[[Harivamsha]]'' and the ''[[Bhagavat Purana]]'' includes names like Shankha, Mahashankha, Shankhapala and Shankachuda. The last two are also mentioned in the Buddhist [[Jataka Tales]] and the ''[[Jimutavahana]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Indian Serpent Lore Or the Nagas in Hindu Legend and Art |pages=215‚Äì16|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nU8JRyvXWnYC&amp;pg=PA215&amp;dq=sankha&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;cd=16#v=onepage&amp;q=sankha&amp;f=true | first=J. | last=Vogel | isbn=978-0-7661-9240-9 | year=2005 | publisher=Kessinger Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt; A legend states that while using Shankha as part of meditative ritual, a [[sadhu]] blew his shankha in the forest of village Keoli and a snake crept out of it. The snake directed the sadhu that he should be worshipped as NƒÅga Devata (Serpent God) and since then it has been known as Shanku Naga. Similar legends are narrated at many other places in [[Kullu district]] in [[Himachal Pradesh]].&lt;ref name= Handa&gt;{{Cite book|last= Handa |first= Omacanda |title= Naga cults and traditions in the western Himalaya|work=Shankh|page=200|accessdate=2009-12-21|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Xd50t19YpJEC&amp;pg=PA200&amp;dq=Shankha&amp;lr=&amp;ei=U3QcS9HbKJTmlATTmqDaCw#v=onepage&amp;q=Shankha&amp;f=false

'''Suhag Raat''' (Hindi: ‡§∏‡•Å‡§π‡§æ‡§ó ‡§∞‡§æ‡§§, {{lang-ur|{{Nastaliq|ÿ≥€Åÿß⁄Ø ÿ±ÿßÿ™}}}}, {{lang-bn|‡¶´‡ßÅ‡¶≤‡¶∂‡¶Ø‡ßç‡¶Ø‡¶æ}}), a significant ritual in the life of a newlywed couple in the [[Indian subcontinent]], refers to the first night when the marriage is [[Consummation|consummated]]. Prior to then, both the bride and bridegroom are assumed to be virgins. The bed of the newlywed couple is decorated with flowers, which are believed to bring sweetness to their relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hindu Wedding|url=http://www.hinduwedding.info/marriage-ceremony.html|accessdate=22 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is an important custom followed in [[Marriage in Hinduism|Vedic Hindu marriages]]. The tradition also extends to [[Jainism|Jains]], [[Buddhism]], and [[Muslims]]. In some areas, especially in eastern India, "Suhag Raat" is also referred to as "Fourth Night" because this ritual is observed on the fourth night of [[Oriya Hindu wedding|marriage]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Oriya Wedding|url=http://www.culturalindia.net/weddings/regional-weddings/oriya-wedding.html|accessdate=1 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bengali Wedding|url=http://www.gingerevents.com/weddings/traditional_weddings/bengali_wedding.html|accessdate=22 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the wedding.

==Custom==
The female members of the bridegroom's family customarily guide the bride to the decorated bedroom where she waits for her husband's arrival{{mdash}}optionally, with a glass of milk.

It is traditional for the groom to wait outside with the relatives and family for some time before he joins the bride in the decorated bedroom. The bride supposedly waits for her husband behind a veil ("[[ghoonghat]]"). The husband slowly takes the veil off to reveal the bride's face in a ritual called "Muh Dekhai" i.e. showing of bride's face.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Importance of Suhag Raat|url=http://www.exoticindiaart.com/product/paintings/first-time-suhag-raat-MF18|accessdate=22 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; After consummation, the wife is also known as "Ardhangini" in Hindu Philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wedding Night customs or Suhag Raat|url=http://www.freeindianmatrimony.com/blog/Wedding-night-customs-or-Suhagraat.html|accessdate=22 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Suhag Raat Customs|url=http://www.bollywoodshaadis.com/articles/suhagrat-customs--a-night-to-remember-995|accessdate=22 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is customary that the couple wakes up early next morning before anyone else, bathe, and change their clothing. The clothing worn the previous night is considered dirty, so the [[dhobi]] customarily arrives the next morning to collect them for cleaning. The Suhag Raat may extend to a honeymoon tour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Suhag Raat|url=https://bollywoodinbritain.wordpress.com/tag/suhaag-raat|accessdate=22 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Father Jurewicz is also an archpriest of the [[Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia]], and serves the parish of the Nativity of the Lord in [[Erie, Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Michael |last=Woerl |url=http://www.orthodoxinfo.com/ecumenism/bookrev_woerl.aspx |title=Book Review: A History of the Orthodox Church in America (1917-1934) |publisher=Orthodox Christian Information Centre |accessdate=26 December 2009 |quote=Father Theodore Jurewicz is a priest of the Russian Orthodox Church Abroad, serving the parish of the Nativity of the Lord in Erie, Pennsylvania.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Art==
Fr. Theodore was born Frank Jurewicz in 1949 into a [[Roman Catholic]] family in [[Erie, Pennsylvania]].

As a child he attended church assiduously and often visited the Old Believer parish of the Nativity of Christ in Erie. From these visits he developed a deep interest in the [[Orthodox Church]], and, while still a teenager, converted to Orthodoxy and joined the [[Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia]].

He married and attended the [[Holy Trinity Orthodox Seminary|Holy Trinity Seminary]] as a married seminarian.

In January 1974, Theodore Jurewicz was ordained priest.

Fr. Jurewicz is held to be one of the most renowned icon painters in [[North America]] today,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stgeorgehermitage.org/frescoes.html |title=As of June 2009, our Fresco Fund is currently at $18,163.80 |publisher=St George Serbian Orthodox Church (Hermitage, PA) |accessdate=26 December 2009 |quote=We are very fortunate to have as our neighbor, the world-renowned iconographer, Fr. Theodore Jurewicz, archpriest to the Church of the Nativity Russian Orthodox Church in Erie. Only one hour away is one of the greatest Orthodox painters of our time!}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has painted about a dozen [[Eastern Orthodox church architecture|Eastern Orthodox churches]] across [[North America]]. He was a student of the late Archimandrite Cyprian, founder of the Russian school of iconography outside of Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.holy-transfiguration.org/ourchurch.html |title=Our Iconostasis |publisher=Transfiguration of Our Lord Russian Orthodox Church (Baltimore, USA) |accessdate=26 December 2009 |quote=Father Theodore Jurewicz was the student of the late Archimandrite Cyprian, founder of the Russian school of iconography outside of Russia. From his teacher Father Theodore acquired the ancient Russian style of iconography, which adorns the iconostasis of the church of Transfiguration.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
One of his more famous works was his commission to paint the entire church at [[New Graƒçanica Monastery]] in [[Third Lake, Illinois]], a faithful replica of the original [[Graƒçanica monastery]] in [[Kosovo]], which is listed on the [[UNESCO World Heritage List]] as an endangered example of medieval monuments. Done over the span of three years, it is painted in a [[Byzantine]] style and features richly colored designs and religious scenes covering the [[wall]]s, [[vault (architecture)|vaults]], [[Column|pillars]] and [[dome]] of the church. The [[fresco]]es are painted in [[Acrylic paint|acrylics]] on dry [[plaster]].&lt;ref name="Gracanica"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newgracanica.com |title=New Gracanica Monastery: The Frescoes |publisher=New Gracanica Monastery (Third Lake, IL) |accessdate=26 December 2009 |quote=In 1995, the fresco project began. Fr. Theodore Jurewicz was commissioned to paint the entire church. The project took three years. Fr. Theodore, one of the most profound and celebrated iconographers in America today, came in stretches of three weeks to a month to do the work. The style is Byzantine and the richly colored designs and religious scenes that cover the walls, vaults, pillars and dome of the church are imbued with bright colors. ... The frescoes painted by Fr. Theodore and other contemporary iconographers are done in acrylics on dry plaster.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another notable commission of Fr. Theodore is the [[Saint Sava Serbian Orthodox Church (Merrillville, Indiana)|Saint Sava Serbian Orthodox Church in Merrillville, Indiana]] where he painted the original frescoes lining the walls and a fresco of the Virgin Mary and the Christ child over the center altar.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nwitimes.com/uncategorized/new-st-sava-serbian-church-a-work-of/article_9a13de2b-9259-5bfa-9666-bc696ac4fcfe.html|title=New St. Sava Serbian church a 'work of love'|last=Calderone Jostes|first=Diane|website=nwitimes.com|access-date=2016-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fr. Theodore has also mastered the art of [[Coptic art#Iconography|Coptic Orthodox iconography]]. His Coptic iconography can be seen at St. George Coptic Orthodox Church in [[Toledo, Ohio]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stgeorgetoledo.com/Home.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Born in 1949 in [[Kham]], East Tibet, the Third Bardor Tulku Rinpoche is believed, according to Tibetan Buddhist tradition, to be a rebirth of a nineteenth/twentieth century meditation master, Terchen Barway Dorje (1836-1920).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

After the failed [[1959 Tibetan uprising]], Rinpoche and his family left Tibet for [[India]]. The journey on foot over the [[Himalayas]] and later the tropical climate of [[Assam]] killed Rinpoche's family. Rinpoche eventually traveled to [[Darjeeling]] where [[Rangjung Rigpe Dorje|the 16th Karmapa]] (1924-1981) found him and arranged for him to be taken to [[Rumtek Monastery]] in [[Sikkim]].&lt;ref&gt;More detailed description of the Third Bardor Tulku Rinpoche's escape from Tibet can be found on the [http://www.kunzang.org/btr-biography.html Kunzang Palchen Ling] web site.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Third Bardor Tulku Rinpoche is mentioned among the prominent [[lama]]s of the [[Kagyu]] tradition of Tibetan Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2000/02/18/nyregion/finding-karma-through-youth-woodstock-s-tibetan-monastery-prepares-for-a-lama.html'' Finding Karma Through Youth; Woodstock's Tibetan Monastery Prepares for a Lama''], [[New York Times]], February 2000&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snowlionpub.com/pages/N57_12.html|title=Tibetan / Vajrayana|work=Shambhala Publications|accessdate=30 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sptimes.com/2004/01/11/Northoftampa/A_visit_from_the__pre.shtml ''Bardor Tulku, a Buddhist spiritual leader, visits Tampa's Buddhist community''], [[St. Petersburg Times]], January 2004&lt;/ref&gt;
He underwent his training as a ''[[tulku]]'' (reincarnate lama) under the tutelage of the 16th Karmapa at Rumtek Monastery. He remained close to the Karmapa throughout his life, serving as his attendant and traveling with him overseas. At his request, he stayed in the United States to help [[Khenpo Karthar Rinpoche]] and Mr. Tenzin Chonyi establish the Karmapa‚Äôs Seat in North America, [[Karma Triyana Dharmachakra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

In 2000, Bardor Tulku Rinpoche established the Raktrul Foundation&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.raktrul.org Raktrul Foundation] is a non-profit organization, the mission of which is to assist underprivileged communities in Tibet by developing and implementing programs for education, medical care, and basic community support.&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2003 a Tibetan Buddhist center, Kunzang Palchen Ling (KPL),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kunzang.org|title=Kunzang Palchen Ling}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Red Hook, New York. A ceremony of a symbolic breaking of the ground for the new building at KPL was held in 2006.

In the fall of 2008, Bardor Tulku Rinpoche resigned from his responsibilities at KTD and is now focusing fully on the activities of KPL. In February 2012, Bardor Tulku Rinpoche‚Äôs vision for the new center became reality as KPL received the Certificate of Occupancy for the first floor of its new building.

KPL is a Buddhist center that offers teachings from the rich and diverse Tibetan Buddhist tradition. One of the significant traits of KPL's activity is providing access to and the preservation of the treasure ([[Terma (Buddhism)|''terma'']]) teachings of Terchen Barway Dorje and the teachings of the [[Kagyu#Barom Kagyu|Barom Kagyu]] lineage. In addition to overseeing translations of Terchen Barway Dorje's treasure teachings into English, Bardor Tulku Rinpoche himself composes liturgies and [[songs]] (''dohas'').&lt;ref&gt;Some of Bardor Tulku Rinpoche's songs can be viewed on [http://www.kunzang.org/btr-songs-marpa.html Kunzang Palchen Ling] web site.&lt;/ref&gt; Rinpoche also guides the activities of Kunzang Ch√∂ling centers affiliated with KPL and Palchen Study Groups&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kunzang.org/kpl-psg.html|title=Palchen Study Groups}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the U.S.

Bardor Tulku Rinpoche travels and teaches across the U.S. His teaching schedule can be found on the KPL website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kunzang.org/btr-calendar.html|title=Bardor Tulku Rinpoche's Schedule}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4914">'''Tiddy Mun''' was a legendary [[bog]] [[spirit]] in [[Lincolnshire]], [[England]], who was believed to have the ability to control the waters and mists of [[The Fens]] of South Lincolnshire and The Carrs of North Lincolnshire.

==Legend==
The belief in Tiddy Mun was first documented in June 1891 in an article by M. C. Balfour in [[the Folklore Society]] journal ''Folk-Lore''. In the article she recalls a story, collected in the [[River Ancholme|Ancholme Valley]], told to her by an older person who spoke of a [[curse]] of pestilence that had been cast upon his village by the Tiddy Mun, who was angered at the [[The Fens#Early modern attempts to drain the Fens|draining of the Fens]] by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]], led by [[Cornelius Vermuyden]], in the seventeenth century. According to the story the Tiddy Mun was eventually placated after the villagers gathered at twilight at the time of the new moon, poured buckets of water into the dyke and apologised for the damage caused.

He was not exclusively malevolent; if the Fens flooded and the waters reached the villages, people would go out at night and call ''Tiddy Mun wi'out a name, tha watters thruff!'' ("Tiddy Mun without a name, the water's through!&lt;ref&gt;Peacock, E (1889) A Glossary of Words used in the Wapentakes of Manley and Corringham, Lincolnshire. English Dialect Society: Trubner page 562&lt;/ref&gt;") until they heard the cry of a [[Northern lapwing|peewit]], and the next morning the waters would have receded.&lt;ref name="Balfour"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Legends Of The Cars|journal=Folk-Lore|date=June 1891|first=M. C. |last=Balfour|volume=2|issue=2|pages=145‚Äì170|jstor=1253522|publisher=Folklore Enterprises, Ltd.|doi=10.1080/0015587x.1891.9720054}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1987 ''[[The Folklore Society#Publications|Folklore]]'' paper "Tiddy Mun's Curse and the Ecological Consequences of Land Reclamation", Darwin Horn argues that all but one of Tiddy Mun's specific curses may be connected to misfortune and disease brought about by the effect of draining the fenland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Tiddy Mun's Curse and the Ecological Consequences of Land Reclamation |journal=Folklore|year=1987 |last=Horn |first=Darwin |volume=98 |issue=1 |pages=11‚Äì15 |jstor=1259396 |doi=10.1080/0015587x.1987.9716391}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The Tiddy Mun was described, by folklorist M.C. Balfour in 1891, as being no bigger than a three-year-old child, but looking like an old man with long, tangled white hair and a matted white beard. He is said to have worn a grey gown so that at dusk he was difficult to see. His laughter was said to resemble the call of the peewit.&lt;ref name="Balfour" /&gt;

==The Tiddy people==
Writing in 1955, folklorist E. H. Rudkin also records another Ancholme Valley belief of an imp-like race of beings who were generally considered mischievous but benevolent. They were 'called the Tiddy people', but also ''the Strangers'', ''Greencoaties'' and ''Yarthin''. The 'Tiddy' name related to their size and Rudkin quotes a source describing them: 'They be tiddy critturs, no more than a span high, wi' arms an' legs as thin as thread, but great big feet an' hands, an' heads rollin' aboot on their shoulders'.&lt;ref name="Rudkin"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Folklore of Lincolnshire: Especially the Low-Lying Areas of Lindsey |journal=Folklore |year=1955 |last=Rudkin |first=E.H. |volume=66 |issue=4 |pages=393‚Äì395 |jstor=1258804 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tiddy people would dance, by moonlight, on large flat stones, known as ''Strangers Stones'', found in the area. Rudkin records a local tradition of smearing the stones with blood and lighting fires on them, but was unable to determine a meaning, or specific belief, behind the practice.&lt;ref name="Rudkin"/&gt; The first of the crops would also be left on the ''Strangers Stones'', as well as bread and salt, to keep the Tiddy people happy and ensure a good harvest.&lt;ref name="Rudkin"/&gt;
