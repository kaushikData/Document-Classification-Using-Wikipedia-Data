      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18547">'''Banjee''' or '''banjee boy''' is a term from the 1980s (or earlier) that describes a certain type of young [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Latino]] or [[African American]] [[men who have sex with men|man who has sex with men]] and who dresses in [[stereotype|stereotypical]] masculine [[Hip hop fashion|urban fashion]] for reasons which may include expressing [[masculinity]], hiding his [[sexual orientation]] and attracting male partners. The term is mostly associated with [[New York City]] and may be [[Nuyorican]] in origin.&lt;ref&gt;"'''Bangee'''" and "'''Banjy'''" should probably be regarded as a misspellings rather than variant spellings based on the well-established use of "banjee" in print since at least the 1990 release of ''Paris Is Burning''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="decon"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.bravesoulcollective.org/perspectives/topic-of-the-month/maskulinity/deconstructing-banjee-realness/ |title=Deconstructing Banjee Realness |author=Tim'm T. West |work=Brace Soul Collective |date=May 25, 2006 |accessdate=September 2, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Sleeveless shirt|Tank tops]], "[[wifebeater (shirt)|wifebeaters]]" and other [[muscle shirt]]s that show off the wearer's physique are a major part of banjee fashion (as evidenced by the promotional shots for the play ''Banjee'' discussed herein, as well as the costumes worn between sex scenes in the porn movies mentioned). Considering that these shirts are a ubiquitous trapping of hip hop culture and are arguably more popular among young gay men than they are in general, the banjee predilection for them makes sense.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Attitude (psychology)|Attitude]], [[clothing]], [[ethnicity]], [[masculinity]], [[physical attractiveness|physique]] and [[youth]] are all elements of what has been called "banjee realness".

An African-American man writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Banjee. That was the identity I was given back in the summer of 1991, when I, [[closeted|half out/half in]] approached the colored museum of the [[Christopher Street pier]]s. I was new to the life, so I had no reference for what people were talking about, but I soon gathered that "banjee" meant that I wasn't a "queen." Whatever the terms of identification, all I knew was that there was one thing that brought both the banjees and the queens (and whatever lies between) to the pier: we were men who loved men. An anxious 19 year old, I wore my banjee realness designation like a badge of honor. [...] a queen schooled me on how my masculinity was something that carried great weight, not only in the gay world, but the straight world as well.&lt;ref name="decon"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The 1990 [[documentary film]] ''[[Paris Is Burning (film)|Paris Is Burning]]'' featured "banjee realness" as one of the categories in which contestants competed for [[trophy|trophies]].  According to ''[[The Village Voice]]'' "banjee boy categories have been a part of [[ball culture|vogue balls]] since at least the early 1980s".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.villagevoice.com/news/0002,trebay,11690,5.html |title=Legends of the Ball: Paris Is Still Burning |author=Guy Trebay |work=[[The Village Voice]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061104210627/https://www.villagevoice.com/news/0002,trebay,11690,5.html |deadurl=y |date=January 12–18, 2000 |archivedate=November 4, 2006 |accessdate=September 2, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''banjee'' never entered mainstream [[popular culture|pop culture]], but it had currency as gay slang throughout the 1990s. In 1998, a report in the [[medical journal]] ''[[AIDS]] Patient Care and [[Sexually transmitted disease|STDs]]'' regarding [[safer sex]] practices among young Black and Latino men was entitled "Banjee Boys Are Down" (''down'', in this [[vernacular]], meaning "supportive of it"), named for a project of [[Brooklyn]]'s Unity Fellowship Church to get safer sex information to young men of color.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/apc.1998.12.71 |title=HIV and STD Prevention Update |author=Gail S. Makulowich |journal=AIDS Patient Care and STDs |date=January 1998 |volume=12 |issue=1 |page=71 |doi=10.1089/apc.1998.12.71 |url-access=limited |PMID=11361901 |quote='''Banjee Boys Are Down'''&lt;br/&gt;Banjee Boys Are Down is the newly funded project of the Unity Fellowship Church in [[Brooklyn]] to help the 56% of blacks (including people of Caribbean descent) living with AIDS in Brooklyn, where some neighborhoods have been severely stricken by AIDS. For example, it is estimated that 1 in 37 people living in [[Bedford-Stuyvesant]] and 1 in 36 people living in [[Fort Greene]], both predominantly black neighborhoods and believed to be home to many black/Caribbean [[men who have sex with men|MSM]], are HIV positive. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1999 play ''Banjee'', written by playwright A.B. Lugo, presented at the Milagro Theater/[[Clemente Soto Vélez]] Cultural and Educational Center (and in another NYC venue in 2004), is "the story of Angel (played by Indio Meléndez), a [[heterosexuality|straight]] homeboy, and Tony (played by Will Sierra), an admittedly [[bisexuality|bi]] banjee, who've known each other since childhood".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theatrereviews.com/pastreviews/banjee.html |title=''Banjee'' by A.

The term ''banjee'' has also been used by several producers of [[gay pornography]] in presenting the type of young man described herein. For example, in 1995 a company called Pleasure Productions produced a [[DVD]] called ''Banjee Black Boys''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.tlagay.com/765534/banjee-black-boyz-porn-videos.html |title=''Banjee Black Boyz'' |publisher=TLA Video |date=December 20, 2013 |accessdate=September 2, 2018 |postscript=Note: Adult content. }}&lt;/ref&gt; (and five similarly named [[sequel]]s)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gayeroticvideoindex.com/C/1/191.html |title=Pleasure Productions |work=Gay Erotic Video Index |date=2018 |accessdate=September 2, 2018 |postscript=Note: Adult content. }}&lt;/ref&gt; and {{circa|1999–2003}} a company called Banjee Boy, Inc. produced films with taglines such as "Wanna see some of the sexiest, thugged out [[gangsta rap|gangstas]] that NY has to offer?".{{cn |date=September 2018 }} There are other examples from adult films, as well as several pornographic [[website]]s (such as "Banjee Boy Group Slam") that still use the term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kinkyandwild.com/1209/inter/2/index.html |title=Banjee Boy Group Slam |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030412205130/http://www.kinkyandwild.com/1209/inter/2/index.html |date= |archivedate=2003-04-12 |accessdate=September 2, 2018 |postscript=Note: Adult content. |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While seeming to have peaked in popularity during the 1990s, the term ''banjee'' is still in use. For example, a 2003 web page for a [[restaurant]] in [[East Harlem]] describes its clientele as an "eclectic mix of patrons that range from pretty neighborhood Banjee boys to some of the [[made man|wise guys]] that once populated the space formerly."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.orbiteastharlem.com/about.html |title=About us |publisher=Orbit East Harlem |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030425215116/http://www.orbiteastharlem.com/about.html |date=2003 |archivedate=2003-04-25 |accessdate=September 2, 2018 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2008 the band [[Hercules &amp; Love Affair]] has performed wearing matching shirts with the word printed on them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.stereogum.com/9867/hercules_love_affair_played_the_first_show_studi/video/ |title=Hercules &amp; Love Affair Played Their First Show @ Studio B, Brooklyn 5/17/08 |author=Amrit Singh |work=[[Stereogum]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150411043255/https://www.stereogum.com/9867/hercules_love_affair_played_the_first_show_studi/video/ |date=May 19, 2008 |archivedate=April 11, 2015 |accessdate=September 2, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2000s and 2010s, New York clothing label [[Hood By Air]]'s designer Shayne Oliver used banjee culture as a general point of reference&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.essentialhommemag.com/hood-by-air-goes-online-for-real-this-time/ |title=Hood By Air Goes Online (For Real This Time) |author=Joshua Glass |work=Essential Homme |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322021131/http://www.essentialhommemag.com/hood-by-air-goes-online-for-real-this-time/ |date=January 20, 2014 |archivedate=2014-03-22 |accessdate=September 2, 2018 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalamerica.org/why-hood-by-air-is-relevant-beyond-the-world-of-fashion-kenta-murakami/ |title=Why Hood By Air Is Relevant Beyond The World Of Fashion |author=Kenta Murakami |work=Digital America |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141005024750/http://www.digitalamerica.org/why-hood-by-air-is-relevant-beyond-the-world-of-fashion-kenta-murakami/ |date=February 18, 2014 |archivedate=2014-10-05 |accessdate=September 2, 2018 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://nylon.com/articles/hood-by-air-hiatus |title=Hood By Air Is Going On Hiatus |author=Eric Shorey |work=[[Nylon (magazine)|Nylon]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170408220335/https://nylon.com/articles/hood-by-air-hiatus |date=April 6, 2017 |archivedate=April 8, 2017 |accessdate=September 2, 2018 |quote=Hood By Air had always stunned at fashion shows with spectacular displays that in 2014 included a live vogue performance.

==Related terms==
'''Homo thug''' is a more recent and more popular term which is nearly synonymous with banjee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ronntaylor.com/bulbs/000030.html |title=Homie-Sexuals, Homo-Thugs &amp; Banjee Queens Galore |work=RonnTaylor.com |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040903224824/http://www.ronntaylor.com/bulbs/000030.html |date=August 8, 2002 |archivedate=2004-09-03 |accessdate=September 2, 2018 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uwff.com/program.cfm?view=film&amp;film_id=17 |title=''Life On Christopher St.'' (Documentary) |publisher=Urbanworld Film Festival |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20021009095014/http://www.uwff.com/program.cfm?view=film&amp;film_id=17 |archivedate=2002-10-09 |accessdate=September 2, 2018 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, ''homo'' thug does imply that the man in question is primarily [[homosexuality|homosexual]]. In contrast, a banjee might be homosexual but might also be bisexual or only have opportunistic homosexual sex with men when women are unavailable — a theme in many of the pornographic films mentioned above.

'''Gayngsta''', a [[portmanteau]] derived from ''[[gay]]'' and ''gangsta'', is another recent coinage. It has mostly been used in relation to the [[underground hip hop|underground]] [[LGBT]] [[hip hop music|hip hop]] scene as shown in the documentary ''[[Pick Up the Mic]]'' and featured in the "Homorevolution Tour 2007" with these artists.  While easily discernible in writing, pronunciation is barely discernible from ''gangsta''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.peaceoutfestival.com/id28.html |title=''Pick Up the Mic'': The Movie! |publisher=Peace Out: The 5th Annual World Homohop Festival |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051222115832/http://www.peaceoutfestival.com/id28.html |date=2005 |archivedate=December 22, 2005 |accessdate=September 2, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/rockdaily/index.php/2007/01/24/gayngsta-rapper-deadlee-launches-a-homorevolution/ |title=Gayngsta Rapper Deadlee Launches a “Homorevolution” |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070127223252/https://www.rollingstone.com/rockdaily/index.php/2007/01/24/gayngsta-rapper-deadlee-launches-a-homorevolution/ |date=January 24, 2007 |archivedate=January 27, 2007 |accessdate=September 2, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;To pronounce ''gayngsta'' differently from ''gangsta'', one has to either draw out the first syllable, accent it, create a stop after it, or take care to pronounce it as ''gay'' and the rest of the word as ''ngster''.  As all of these options run contrary to the flow of conversational English, it seems unlikely this term will see much use outside of writing.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Banjee girl''' is heard so rarely that it is difficult to define. In discussing a fashion show in [[Paris]], one reviewer wrote in 2005:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The low-rise skirt in denim is the first of its kind seen on the Paris [[Runway (fashion)|runways]]. What is now clear to me is that no self-respecting Banjee [[Latina]], or [[ghetto-fabulous]] “Shamecka-girl” or high rolling white chick will be ever able to resist its urban appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.fashionwindows.com/fashion_review/paris/2005S/xuly_bet.asp |title=Xuly Bët Consolidates Paris Return in Grand Pomp |work=Fashion Windows |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928025004/http://www.fashionwindows.com/fashion_review/paris/2005S/xuly_bet.asp |date=October 17, 2004 |archivedate=September 28, 2007 |accessdate=September 2, 2018 }}  While the reviewer does seem to understand that banjee has some relation to urban fashion and may be deliberately mixing cultural associations for humorous effect, they seem to have confused {{lang|ar-Latn|Shamecka}} (a female first name in [[Arabic language|Arabic]]) with ''[[wikt:shmatte|shmatte]]'' (from {{lang-yi|שמאַטע}}, from {{lang-pl|szmata}}) meaning "rag".  The reviewer in question may be similarly confused about the meaning of banjee.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Several examples of the use of the term ''banjee girl'' exist in the [[blogosphere]] but it has rarely, if ever, made it into print or [[mass media]]. Exceptions include [[RuPaul]]'s [[Billboard charts|''Billboard'' charting]] single "[[Back to My Roots]]", which includes the term in a list of hair fashions, an episode of the [[RuPaul's Drag Race (season 6)|2014 season of ''RuPaul's Drag Race'']]&lt;ref name="Pancocojams"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://pancocojams.blogspot.com/2014/04/the-changing-meaning-of-banji-banjee.html |title=The Changing Meaning Of "Banji" (Banjee) — From ''Paris Is Burning'' to Sharaya J's "Banji" Record |author=Azizi Powell |work= |publisher= |date= |accessdate=September 2, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Sharaya J]], whose 2013 début single was called "BANJI"; she also used the name for her production company when she split from [[Missy Elliott]]'s label [[The Goldmind Inc.]] in 2016.&lt;ref name="Pancocojams"/&gt;

In the 1990 documentary film ''[[Paris Is Burning (film)|Paris is Burning]]'', ''banjee girl'' and ''banjee boy'' were used in comparable frequency. Coupled with the film's focus on the [[ball culture]], an inextricably-connected transgender and drag subculture of 1980s [[New York City]], this lends itself to a contextual definition of those performers impersonating females and attempting to exhibit the ultimately judged quality of holistic visual verisimilitude—"realness".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9532">'''Botanical Latin''' is a technical language based on [[New Latin]], used for descriptions of [[botanical]] [[taxon|taxa]]. Until 2012, [[International Code of Botanical Nomenclature]] mandated Botanical Latin to be used for the descriptions of most new taxa.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|McNeill et al. 2011|ref=ICN2011|Article 39}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is still the only language other than English accepted for descriptions. The [[Botanical name|names]] of organisms governed by the Code also have forms based on Latin.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|McNeill et al. 2011|ref=ICN2011|Principle V}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Botanical Latin is primarily a written language. It includes taxon names derived from any language or even arbitrarily derived,&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|McNeill et al. 2011|ref=ICN2011|e.g., articles 20 and 23.2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and consequently there is no single consistent pronunciation system. When speakers of different languages use Botanical Latin in speech, they use pronunciations influenced by their own languages, or, notably in French, there may be variant spellings based on the Latin. There are at least two pronunciation systems used for Latin by English speakers. All of these systems, however, will inevitably be unsustainable across the spectrum of botanical names.&lt;ref name=Pronunciation&gt;{{harv|Stearn 1992|ref=Stearn|chapter=Pronunciation|p. 51–54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
[[Augustin Pyramus de Candolle]] described the language in 1880:
&lt;blockquote&gt;C'est le latin arrangé par Linné à l'usage des descriptions et, j'oserai dire, à l'usage de ceux qui n'aiment ni les complications grammaticales, ni les phrases disposées sens desus dessous." (Quoted by W. T. Stearn&lt;ref name=Stearn1&gt;{{harv|Stearn 1992|ref=Stearn|p. 6}}&lt;/ref&gt;) [It is the Latin chosen by [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]] for the purpose of descriptions, and, I dare to say, for the use of those who love neither grammatical complications nor phrases arranged with senses on top of one another.]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

De Candolle estimated that to learn Botanical Latin would take three months' work for an English speaker not already familiar with any language of Latin origin, and one month for an Italian.&lt;ref name=Stearn1/&gt;

[[William T. Stearn]] wrote:&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Stearn 1992|ref=Stearn|p. 6–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Botanical Latin is best described as a modern Romance language of special technical application, derived from [[Renaissance Latin]] with much plundering of ancient Greek, which has evolved, mainly since 1700 and primarily through the work of Carl Linnaeus (1707–78), to serve as an international medium for the scientific naming of plants in all their vast numbers and manifold diversity. These include many thousands of plants unknown to the Greeks and Romans of classical times and for which names have had to be provided as a means of reference. Their description necessitates the recording of structures often too small for comprehension by the naked eye, hence unknown to the ancients and needing words with precise restricted applications foreign to [[classical Latin]].&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Orthography of taxon names==
Latin names of organisms are generally used in English without alteration, but some informal derivatives are used as common names. For example, the -''idae'' ending of [[class (biology)|subclass]] names is changed to -ids (e.g., ''[[Rosidae]]'' produces rosids); the [[subfamily]] ending -''oideae'' is changed to -oids (e.g., ''[[Papilionoideae]]'' produces papilionoids). The -ids common names have, however also been adopted as rankless [[clade]] names, sometimes containing further -ids clade names, so that, for example, in the APG IV classification, rosids contain both fabids and malvids.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=The Angiosperm Phylogeny Group |year=2016 |title=An update of the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group classification for the orders and families of flowering plants: APG IV |journal=Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society |volume=181 |issue=1 |pages=1–20 |doi=10.1111/boj.12385}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Side box
|above=In French wikipedia
|text=[[:fr:Francisation des termes en latin scientifique|''Francisation des termes en latin scientifique'']]
}}
More extensive modifications to the spelling and pronunciation are routinely used in some other languages. French organism names are usually [[Francization|gallicized]]. For example: ''[[Chlorophyceae]]'' becomes Chlorophycées; ''Portulacineae'' becomes Portulacinées.

===Alphabet===
The Classical Latin alphabet consisted of 21 letters, to which w, y, and z were later added, and the vowel/consonant pairs i and j, u and v, were later separated. This 26-letter alphabet is used for taxon names in Botanical Latin.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Stearn 1992|ref=Stearn|chapter=Pronunciation|p. 49–51}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|McNeill et al. 2011|ref=ICN2011|Article 60.4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Diacritic]]s are not used in names, and a [[Diaeresis (diacritic)|dieresis]] is considered an optional mark that does not affect spelling.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|McNeill et al. 2011|ref=ICN2011|Article 60.6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==English pronunciation==
Some English speakers, and some speakers of other languages, use the reconstructed pronunciation guide for [[Latin#Phonology|Classical Latin]] when speaking Botanical Latin.&lt;ref name=Pronunciation/&gt; Latin names pronounced by gardeners and English botanists usually follow a system close to English.&lt;ref name=Pronunciation/&gt; It differs greatly from Classical pronunciation, and also from [[Ecclesiastical Latin]] pronunciation (which is based on Italian, and has, for example, ''c'' before ''i'' or ''e'' pronounced as ''ch'').&lt;ref name=Pronunciation/&gt;

Every vowel is pronounced, except diphthongs, which are treated as single long vowels.
&lt;blockquote&gt;In classical Latin words of several syllables the stress falls on the syllable next to the last one (the penultimate) when this syllable is long ... e.g., ''for-mō'-sus'', or when two consonants separate the two last vowels, e.g., ''cru-ěn'-tus'' ... on the last syllable but two (the antepenultimate) when the last but one is short, e.g. ''flō-ri-dus''.&lt;ref name=Pronunciation/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"These rules cannot satisfactorily be applied to all generic names and specific epithets commemorating persons. About 80 per cent of generic names and 30 per cent of specific epithets come from languages other than Latin and Greek. A simple and consistent method of pronouncing them does not exist."&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Stearn 1992|ref=Stearn|chapter=Pronunciation|p. 53}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The rules also create difficulties with the -''ii'' and -''iae'' endings derived from personal names, because the stress falls in a place that is not usual for those names.

===Traditional English pronunciation===

The following table is simplified from Stearn 1992.&lt;ref name=Pronunciation/&gt; The pronunciation transcriptions for medical terminology in major medical dictionaries, such as ''[[Dorland's medical reference works|Dorland’s Illustrated Medical Dictionary]]'' and ''[[Stedman's Medical Dictionary]]'', match these values.

The '''Bunak language''' (also known as '''Bunaq''', '''Buna'''', '''Bunake''') is the language of the [[Bunak]] people of the mountainous region of central [[Timor]], split between the political boundary between [[West Timor]], [[Indonesia]], particularly in Lamaknen District and [[East Timor]]. It is one of the few on Timor which is not an [[Austronesian language]], but rather a [[Papuan language]] like groups on [[New Guinea]]. It is usually classified in the [[Trans–New Guinea]] language family. The language is surrounded by [[Malayo-Polynesian languages]], like [[Uab Meto language|Uab Meto]] and [[Tetum]].

Pronouns seem to tie Bunak more closely to the [[Alor–Pantar languages]], in a group Ross (2005) calls "West Timor", than with the Papuan [[East Timor languages]]. The independent pronouns and object prefixes, which appear to retain the proto-Trans–New Guinea dual suffix *-li, are as follows:

Wilson]] (Edited), ''The Church on the Move: A Quest to Affirm the Biblical Faith - Essays in honour of P. Victor Premasagar'', CLS, Chennai, 1988, pp.135-144 [https://books.google.co.in/books/about/Church_on_the_Move.html?id=hMJIygAACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y]&lt;/ref&gt; especially Hymn Number 94 titled ''Yesuku Samanulevaru'' (Translated ''Who is equal to you Lord?'') with direct reference to [[Psalm]] 71:19 and strikingly similar to [[Tyagaraja]]'s composition in [[Kharaharapriya]]. Dayanandan Francis brings Chetti Bhanumurti in the line of another Hymn writer, [[Purushottam Choudari]] and writes,

{{quote|Like Choudari, Bhanumurti also is interested in picking up ideas, thought-forms and even [[ragas]] from popular [[Hindu]] poems and lyrics, while at the same time endeavouring to broaden the perspectives found in such religious literary forms with distinctive Christian ideas.}}

==Studies==
In 1915,&lt;ref name="Directory"&gt;[[S. J. Samartha]], [[M. P. John]] (Compiled), ''Directory of students 1910-1967'', Serampore College (Theology Department), Serampore, 1967, p.1.&lt;/ref&gt; Bhanumurthy discerned his avocation towards priesthood and went for ministerial formation to the [[Serampore College]], [[Serampore]], a constituent College of the nation's first University,&lt;ref name="Murli"&gt;[[Murli Manohar Joshi]], ''Higher Education in India Vision and Action, A paper presented at the UNESCO World Conference on Higher Education in the Twenty First Century, Paris, 5–9 October 1998. Internet, accessed 22 August 2008. {{cite web |url=http://education.nic.in/unhighedu.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-11-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120223010953/http://education.nic.in/unhighedu.asp |archivedate=23 February 2012 |df=dmy }}''&lt;/ref&gt; studying up to 1918,&lt;ref name="Directory"/&gt; during the Principalship of [[George Howells]], as a candidate of the Canadian Baptist Mission/Convention of Baptist Churches of Northern Circars where Bhanumurthy obtained a [[Licentiate in Theology]] ([[L.Th.]]).&lt;ref name="Trophies"/&gt;

==Theological Teacher==
Bhanumurthy taught at the [[Ramayapatnam]] Baptist Theological Seminary in Ramayapatnam&lt;ref name="Trophies"/&gt; and later on moved to Kakinada where he taught at the Baptist Theological Seminary in Kakinada along with [[Muthyala Theophilus]] who was his colleague.  This was the period when [[A. B. Masilamani]] joined the seminary for spiritual formation.  In 1952, Bhanumurthy became Principal of the [[seminary]].

==Hymns==
[[Roger E. Hedlund]], the [[Missiologist]] writes that along with the [[Bible]], the Christian Hymnal in Telugu also forms the main bulwark of Christian spiritual life for the [[Telugu language|Telugu]] folk and of equal use to both the non-literates and the literates as well.&lt;ref&gt;Roger E. Hedlund, Quest for Identity: India's Churches of Indigenous origin: The "Little" Tradition in Indian Christianity, New Delhi, 2000, p.261. [https://books.google.co.in/books?id=W3sGM-wp1msC&amp;pg=PA261&amp;dq=andhra+christian+hymnal&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=CcyYVaCtJcSdugSGmqo4&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;  In such a context, it is noteworthy that sixteen of Bhanumurthy's compositions are found in the Christian Hymnal in Telugu with the following sequence,

* 9, ''Stuti Geethamu'',&lt;ref name="ACH"/&gt;
* 84, ''Neeti Suryudu'',&lt;ref name="ACH"/&gt;

'''Clothna mac Aenghusa''', [[Irish people|Irish]] [[poet]], died 1008.

Clothna held the post of [[Chief Ollam of Ireland]].  Some of his poems are held in the Library of [[Trinity College Dublin]].
His obit is given in the [[Annals of the Four Masters]] as follows- “M1008.11 Clothna, son of Aenghus, chief poet of Ireland in his time, died.”

His obit is given in the [[Annals of Ulster]] as follows- “U1009.10 Clothgna son of Aengus, chief poet of Ireland, dies.”
His obit is given in the [[Chronicon Scotorum]] as follows- "Annal CS1009 Kalends. Clothna son of Óengus, chief poet of Ireland, dies.”

His appellation appears to be a [[patronymic]], not a [[surname]].

[[Image:Double hyphen in Walbaum-Fraktur.png|300px|thumb|right|Double oblique hyphen in a [[Fraktur (typeface)|Fraktur]] typeface]]

The '''double hyphen''' (&amp;#xFF1D; or &amp;#x30A0;) is a [[punctuation|punctuation mark]] that consists of two parallel [[hyphen]]s. It was a development of the earlier {{nowrap|'''double oblique hyphen'''}} (&amp;#x2E17;) which developed from a [[Central Europe]]an variant of the [[slash (punctuation)#History|virgule slash]], originally a form of [[comma (punctuation)|scratch comma]]. In order to avoid its being confused with the [[equals sign]] (&amp;#x3D;), the double hyphen is often given as double oblique hyphen in modern typography. The double hyphen is also not to be confused with two consecutive hyphens (&amp;#x2D;&lt;span style="padding-left: 0.1em;&gt;&amp;#x2D;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!--CSS tweak makes the two characters more distinguishable.--&gt;), which are often used to represent an [[em dash]] (&amp;mdash;) or [[en dash]] (–); that practice arose due to the limitations of typewriter character sets which did not have both hyphen and dash.

==Usage==
[[File:Double oblique hyphen used in a Hittite dictionary.png|thumb|Double oblique hyphens (besides ordinary hyphens) used in a [[Hittite language|Hittite]] dictionary&lt;ref&gt;Hans G. Güterbock, Harry A. Hoffner, Theo P. J. van den Hout: ''The Hittite Dictionary of the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago (CHD)'', volume L–N, Chicago (USA) 1989, {{ISBN|0-918986-58-3}}, p. 355. – Detail of the left border of the second column.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[File:Double Hyphen in a work from Arno Schmidt.png|thumb|Double (straight) hyphen in an edition of stories by [[Arno Schmidt]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Arno Schmidt]]: ''Erzählungen'', Frankfurt am Main (Germany) 1994, {{ISBN|3-10-373505-7}}, p. 525. – Detail of the right border of the printed text.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The double hyphen is used for several different purposes throughout the world:

* Some [[typeface]]s, such as [[Fraktur (typeface)|Fraktur]] faces, use the double hyphen as a [[glyph]]ic variant of the single hyphen. (With Fraktur faces, such a double hyphen usually is oblique.)
* It may be also used for artistic or commercial purposes to achieve a distinctive visual effect. For example, the name of [[Waldorf&amp;#x3D;Astoria Hotel|The Waldorf=Astoria]] hotel was officially written with a double hyphen from 1949 to 2009.
* In [[Merriam-Webster]] dictionaries if a word is divided at the end of the line, and the division point happens to be a hyphen, it is replaced with a double hyphen to graphically indicate that the divided word is normally hyphenated, for example ''cross&amp;#x2E17;&lt;br /&gt;country''.
* In several dictionaries published in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, all such compound words are linked with double hyphens, whether at the end of the line or not, and the normal use of the single hyphen for non-compound words is retained. An example from the first or second page of such dictionaries is ''[[Aaron's rod|Aaron's&amp;#x2E17;rod]]''. Examples include the [[Century Dictionary]] and [[Funk &amp;amp; Wagnalls]] New Standard Dictionary of the English Language.
* It is used as a distinct punctuation mark by [[Coptic language]] and ancient Near Eastern language scholars.
* It is used as a distinct punctuation mark in [[Ojibwe language]] publications in the Fiero Roman orthography, as a hyphen is used to separate compound preverb units regardless of their line position, while a double hyphen is used to divide a word at the end of a line and can be treated as a [[soft hyphen]]. However, due to lack of availability of a double hyphen in most fonts, an equal sign is often used as a substitute.
* In Ojibwe, [[Cree language|Cree]] and other languages using [[Unified Canadian syllabics]], as final ''c'' ( ᐨ )—encoded as {{sc2|CANADIAN SYLLABICS FINAL SHORT HORIZONTAL STROKE}} (U+1428)—resembles a hyphen, a double hyphen (᐀) named {{sc2|CANADIAN SYLLABICS HYPHEN}} (U+1400) is used to distinguish the punctuation from the syllabics letter.
* In [[Japanese language|Japanese]], the {{Nihongo|double hyphen|ダブルハイフン|daburu haifun}} in rare cases replaces an English en dash or hyphen when writing foreign words in [[katakana]] due to their potential confusion with the [[chōon|prolonged sound mark]] ({{Lang|ja|&amp;#x30FC;}}). It may be used to separate a person's given and family names, such as transcribing the name of [[Galileo Galilei]] as: ガリレオ＝ガリレイ&lt;ref&gt;https://dictionary.goo.ne.jp/jn/138522/meaning/m2u/%E3%83%80%E3%83%96%E3%83%AB%E3%83%8F%E3%82%A4%E3%83%95%E3%83%B3/&lt;/ref&gt;. The [[middle dot]] ({{Lang|ja|&amp;#x30FB;}}) is however much more commonly used for these purposes. (For foreign names that include both spaces and hyphens, both the middle dot and double hyphen may appear together as in [[Catherine Zeta-Jones]]: キャサリン・ゼタ゠ジョーンズ.) The double hyphen is part of the [[JIS X 0213]] standard, but is not included in more commonly used character encodings, such as [[Shift-JIS]] and [[EUC-JP]]. For this reason, the equals sign is frequently used in its place.

==Unicode==
When the double hyphen is used as a functionally equivalent graphical variant of the single hyphen, it is represented in [[Unicode]] as a normal hyphen.

When used as a punctuation mark distinct from the single hyphen, the double hyphen is represented in Unicode by several different points.

'''Essie Honiball''' (12 April 1924 – 25 November 2013), was a South African author and health educator in the fields of [[fruitarianism]], [[fasting]] and [[healing|natural healing]].

==Biography==
'''Early life'''

Essie Honiball was born Esther Maria Wiese, in [[Edenburg]], [[Orange Free State Province|Orange Free State]], [[South Africa]]. She attended Orange Girl High School in [[Bloemfontein]], before studying at the Universities of [[Stellenbosch]] and Orange Free State, where she graduated in Biology (B.s.c.), Physical Education (Performers Licentitate) and Music (piano). She then travelled to Europe to continue her Physical Education studies in the [[Netherlands]], [[Denmark]] and [[London]].

'''Later life'''

After teaching Physical Education at schools in South Africa, Honiball lectured in health and biology education at the [[Cape Town]] Training College and at the [[Pretoria Normal College]] in Physical Education. She also served as Assistant Head of the Elizabeth Conradie School for disabled children.

'''Illness'''

A keen swimmer, she became a junior diving champion of Orange Free State, and a senior diving champion of Western Province (in the Western Cape) in 1946. However, in 1958, Honiball became very ill with tuberculosis and was hospitalized in [[Kimberley, Northern Cape|Kimberley]], Northern Cape. Although the illness disappeared, Honiball failed to regain her strength and fell into depression. After hearing of the healing power of fruits by a friend, the author Cornelius Valkenburg de Villiers-Dreyer,&lt;ref&gt;The Supreme Law, Cornelius Valkenburg de Villiers-Dreyer, Rushkin Press, 1931&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Bible of Nature and Book of Wisdom, Cornelius Valkenburg de Villiers-Dreyer, Rushkin Press, 1936&lt;/ref&gt; whom she married in 1959, and influenced by the writings of South African author [[Johanna Brandt]], she recovered from her condition. When her husband died in 1962, Honiball went on to marry, [[T. O. Honiball]] in 1973, a notable cartoonist for The Burger ([[South Africa]]) and its magazines.&lt;ref&gt;T. O. Honiball: culture with a smile, Francois Philippus Verster, AFRICAN SUN MeDIA, 2004, page 56 "Mrs Honiball believes that a study of her late husband's work can do much to help foster better relations between cultural groups in South Africa."&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rebirth'''

After withdrawing from normal life, and adopting a fruit diet (fruits, berries, nuts, seeds, and sometimes vegetables) which she later described in her book ''I Live On Fruit'', she felt transformed, acquiring a healthy body, new outlook on life and new lifestyle, to the surprise of her family and friends. Inspired by the results she had obtained, Honiball initiated the Hokaai! Movement with Herma Loubsa, establishing clubs in different regions of [[South Africa]]. The club members, known as Hokaaiers, met every year to attend lectures about the fruit diet and relax in natural surroundings.

'''Writings'''

Honiball went on to write several books about her experiences with the fruit diet which were published in [[Afrikaans]] and some in [[English language|English]] including ''I Live On Fruit'',&lt;ref&gt;The fruit hunters: a story of nature, adventure, commerce and obsession, Adam Gollner, Simon and Schuster, 2008, page 97, "Morris Krok's Fruit: The Food and Medicine for Man relates how he attended a fruitarian lecture with Essie Honiball, author of I Live On Fruit. Asked what one should eat, the answer is: "Fruit, of course."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blatant raw foodist propaganda!, or, Sell your stove to the junkman and feel great!, or, Consider your true nature, Joe Alexander, Blue Dolphin Publishers, 1990, page 60, "Essie tells how she converted her husband to fruitarianism, though he had no interest in changing his conventional diet."&lt;/ref&gt; ''I Live On Fruit And Nothing Else'', and, ''A Fruit Eater Is Born'', which documented 50 years of her life’s work and experiences with diet. According to her writings, she sustained an exclusive fruitarian diet, for a period of 20 years without break, and has continued with the fruitarian diet throughout her life. In 2010, her books ''Ek leef van vrugte'' and ''I Live On Fruit'' will be updated and republished by [[Benedic Books]].

'''Biography'''

In 2010, well-known South African author [[Anoeschka von Meck]], signed an agreement with [[Benedic Books]] for the writing of Essie Honiball's biography. Initially the book will be published in Afrikaans with the title: ''Essie Honiball: Die Ontwaking'', and later translated into English with the title: ''Essie Honiball: The Awakening''. The Afrikaans edition is scheduled for release at the end of 2010, and the English edition, at the beginning of 2011.

==Legacy==
Honiball is one of a series of latter-20th century writers who writes about fruitarianism, raw nutrition, fasting and detoxification. She has produced a series of 12 books in [[Afrikaans]] and [[English language|English]], about the fruit diet and is featured in the book ''Stellenbosch Writers'' by Rosemarie Breuer.&lt;ref&gt;Stellenbosch Writers, Rosemarie Breuer, 2005, {{ISBN|0-620-32948-3}}, {{ISBN|978-0-620-32948-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; She is also cited in
''Raw Knowledge: Enhancing The Powers of the Mind, Body and Soul'', by health author,  Paul Nison.&lt;ref&gt;Raw Knowledge, Paul Nison, Three Forty Three Pub Co; 3rd edition, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, [[Morris Krok]], republished her book ''I Live On Fruit''. The high fruit, low fat and all raw diet, which Honiball promotes has been referred to in the writings of health authors including Anne Osborne, Brian R. Clement Ph.D, Dr. Douglas Graham, and [[Viktoras Kulvinskas]].&lt;ref&gt;The 80 10 10 Diet, Douglas N Graham, FoodnSport Press, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; She received an honorary certificate from Orange Girl High School, Bloemfontein, in 2006.

==Criticisms==
Honiball's fruitarian diet consisted of fruits, berries, nuts and seeds. Health writers including Robert Gray, [[Arnold Ehret]], [[Morris Krok]] and [[Johnny Lovewisdom]], have described how nuts and seeds are not botanically fruits, and too concentrated to form part of the optimum fruitarian diet.&lt;ref&gt;The Mucusless Diet Healing System, Arnold Ehret, Ehret Literature Publishing Company, 1994, chapter, The Destructive Diet Of Civilization&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hadza''' is a [[language isolate]] spoken along the shores of [[Lake Eyasi]] in [[Tanzania]] by around 1,000 [[Hadza people]], the last full-time [[hunter-gatherer]]s in Africa. Despite the small number of speakers, language use is vigorous, with most children learning it. In the late 20th century Hadza was included in a proposed [[Khoisan languages|Khoisan]] language family, largely on the basis of its use of [[click consonant|clicks]], but this classification is no longer accepted.

==Classification==
Hadza is a language isolate (Sands 1998, Starostin 2013). It was once classified by many linguists as a [[Khoisan languages|Khoisan language]], along with its neighbor [[Sandawe language|Sandawe]], primarily because they both have [[click consonant]]s. However, Hadza has very few proposed [[cognate]]s with either Sandawe or the other Khoisan languages, and many of the ones that have been proposed appear doubtful. The links with Sandawe, for example, are [[Cushitic languages|Cushitic]] loan words, whereas the links with southern Africa are so few and so short (usually single consonant–vowel syllables) that they are most likely coincidental. A few words link it with [[Oropom language|Oropom]], which may itself be spurious; the numerals ''itchâme'' 'one' and ''pie'' 'two' suggest a connection with [[Kw'adza language|Kw'adza]], an extinct language of hunter-gatherers who may have had recently shifted to Cushitic. (Higher numerals were borrowed in both languages.)

According to ''[[Ethnologue]]'', Bali may be a dialect of Hadza. The language is marked as "[[Endangered language|threatened]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ethnologue.com/language/hts |title=Hadza |website=Ethnologue.com |date= |accessdate=2017-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Phonology==
Hadza syllable structure is limited to CV, or CVN if nasal vowels are analyzed as a coda nasal. Vowel-initial syllables do not occur initially, and medially they appear to be equivalent to /hV/.

Hadza is noted for having medial clicks (clicks within morphemes). This distribution is also found in [[Sandawe language|Sandawe]] and the [[Nguni languages|Nguni Bantu languages]], but not in the Khoisan languages of southern Africa. Some of these words are historically derivable from clicks in initial positions (many appear to reflect lexicalized reduplication, for example, and some are due to prefixes), but others are opaque. As in Sandawe, most medial clicks are glottalized, but not all: ''puche'' 'a spleen', ''tanche'' 'to aim', ''tacce'' 'a belt', ''minca'' 'to lick one's lips', ''laqo'' 'to trip someone', ''keqhe-na'' 'slow', ''penqhenqhe ~ peqeqhe'' 'to hurry', ''haqqa-ko'' 'a stone', ''shenqe'' 'to peer over', ''exekeke'' 'to listen', ''naxhi'' 'to be crowded', ''khaxxe'' 'to jump', ''binxo'' 'to carry kills under one's belt'.

===Tone===
It is not known if Hadza has lexical [[tone (linguistics)|tone]]. It may have a [[pitch accent]] system, but the details have not been worked out. There are no known lexical [[minimal pair]]s for stress/tone, though the suffix for the habitual mood is tonic.

===Vowels===
Hadza has five vowels, {{IPA|[i e a o u]}}. Long vowels may occur when intervocalic {{IPA|[ɦ]}} is elided. For example, {{IPA|[kʰaɦa]}} or {{IPA|[kʰaː]}}, ''to climb''. [[Nasal vowel]]s, although uncommon, do occur, though not before consonants that have [[prenasalized consonant|prenasalized]] homologues. (That is, {{IPA|CṼCV}} and {{IPA|CVNCV}} are in [[complementary distribution]].) All vowels are nasalized before glottalized nasal clicks.

#The nasalization of the [[glottalization|glottalized]] nasal clicks is apparent on preceding vowels, but not during the click itself. The labial {{IPA|[ᵑʘˀ]}} (or {{IPA|[ᵑʘʷ]}}) is found in a single mimetic word where it alternates with {{IPA|[ᵑǀ]}}.
#The labial ejective {{IPA|/pʼ/}} is only found in a few words.
#The palatal affricates may be pronounced with an alveolar onset ({{IPA|/t͜{{PUA|&amp;#xf267;}}/}} ''etc.''), but this is not required. (If the transcriptions do not display properly, they can also be written {{IPA|[c͜ʎ̥˔]}} ''etc.'')
#The velar ejective {{IPA|/k͜xʼ/}} varies between a plosive {{IPA|[kʼ]}}, a central affricate {{IPA|[k͜xʼ]}}, a lateral affricate {{IPA|[k͜{{PUA|&amp;#xf268;}}ʼ]}}, and a fricative {{IPA|[xʼ]}}. The other ejective affricates may also appear as ejective fricatives.
#The lateral approximant {{IPA|/l/}} is found as a [[flap consonant|flap]] {{IPA|[ɾ]}} between vowels and occasionally elsewhere, especially in rapid speech.
#The [[voiceless velar fricative]] {{IPA|[x]}} is known from only a single word, where it alternates with {{IPA|/kʰ/}}.
#{{IPA|/ɦ/}} and [[zero onset]] appear to be allophones. 
#The prenasalized consonants, as well as the voiced and nasal consonants {{IPA|/ɲ ŋ ŋʷ d ɡ ɡʷ dʒ/}} and perhaps {{IPA|/dz/}} (on darker background) seem to be borrowed (Elderkin 1978).

===Orthography===
A practical orthography has been devised by Miller and Anyawire (Miller et al. 2013). As of 2015, this orthography is not being used by any Hadza speakers and is therefore of limited value for communication in Hadza. It is broadly similar to the orthographies of neighboring languages such as Swahili, [[Isanzu language|Isanzu]], [[Iraqw language|Iraqw]], and [[Sandawe language|Sandawe]]. The apostrophe, which is ubiquitous in transcription in the anthropological literature but causes problems with literacy, has been reduced: Glottal stop between like vowels is indicated by vowel sequences (that is, {{IPA|/beʔe/}} is written {{angle bracket|bee}}, as in {{angle bracket|Hazabee}} {{IPA|/ɦadzabeʔe/}} 'the Hadza'), and ejectives and glottalized clicks by gemination (apart from reduced {{angle bracket|dl}} instead of *ddl for {{IPA|/c{{PUA|&amp;#xf267;}}ʼ/}}). The ejectives are based on the voiced consonants, {{angle bracket|bb zz jj dl gg ggw}}, because these are otherwise found mostly in borrowings and thus not common. ''Tc'' {{IPA|/tʃ/}} and ''tch'' {{IPA|/tʃʰ/}} are as in Sandawe, ''sl'' {{IPA|/ɬ/}} as in Iraqw. (This is ultimately a French convention.) Nasalized vowels are {{angle bracket|an en in un}}. Long vowels are {{angle bracket|â}} or {{angle bracket|aha}}, because they are usually due to an elided {{IPA|/ɦ/}}. A tonic syllable may be written with an acute accent, {{angle bracket|á}}, but is generally not marked.

==Grammar==
Source: Miller (2008).

Hadza is a [[head-marking]] language in both clauses and noun phrases. [[Constituent order|Word order]] is flexible; the default constituent order is VSO, though VOS and fronting to SVO are both very common. The order of determiner, noun, and attributive also varies, though with morphological consequences. There is number and gender agreement on both attributives (for head nouns) and verbs (for subjects).

Reduplication of the initial syllable of a word, usually with tonic accent and a long vowel, is used to indicate 'just' (meaning either 'merely' or 'solely') and is quite common. It occurs on both nouns and verbs, and reduplication can be used to emphasize other things, such as the habitual suffix ''-hé-'' or the pluractional infix ''{{angle bracket|kV}}''.

===Nouns and pronouns===
Nouns have grammatical gender (masculine and feminine) and number (singular and plural). They are marked by suffixes as follows:

{|class=wikitable
|-
! ||sg.||pl
|-
!m
| ||-bii
|-
!f
| -ko||-bee
|}
The feminine plural is used for mixed natural gender, as in ''Hazabee'' 'the Hadza'. For many animals, the grammatical singular is [[transnumeric]], as in English: ''dongoko'' 'zebra' (either one or a group). The masculine plural may trigger vowel harmony: ''dongobee'' 'zebras' (an individuated number), ''dungubii'' 'zebra bucks'. A couple kin terms and the diminutive suffix ''-nakwe'' take ''-te'' in the m.sg., which is otherwise unmarked.

Gender is used metaphorically, with ordinarily feminine words made masculine if they are notably thin, and ordinarily masculine words made feminine if they are notably round. Gender also distinguishes such things as vines (m) and their tubers (f), or berry trees (f) and their berries (m). Mass nouns tend to be grammatically plural, such as ''atibii'' 'water' (cf. ''ati'' 'rain', ''atiko'' 'a spring').

The names reported for dead animals do not follow this pattern. Calling attention to a dead zebra, for example, uses the form ''hantaii'' (masculine ''hantaee'', plural (rare) ''hataetee'' and ''hantaitchii''). This is because these forms are not nouns, but imperative verbs; the morphology is clearer in the imperative plural, when addressing more than one person: ''hantatate, hantâte, hantaetate, hantaitchate'' (substitute ''-si'' for final ''-te'' when addressing only men; see below for the verbal object suffixes ''-ta-, -a-, -eta-, -itcha-'').

====The copula====
The ''-pe'' and ''-pi'' forms of nouns often seen in the anthropological literature (actually ''-phee'' and ''-phii'') are [[Copula (linguistics)|copula]]r: ''dongophee'' 'they are zebras'. The copular suffixes distinguish gender in all persons as well as [[clusivity]] in the 1st person. They are:

{|class=wikitable
|-
! ||m.sg.||f.sg.||f.pl.||m.pl
|-
!1.ex
|rowspan=2|-nee ||rowspan=2|-neko ||-'ophee ||-'uphii
|-
!1.in
| -bebee||-bibii
|-
!2
| -tee||-teko||-tetee||-titii
|-
!3
| -a||-ako||-phee||-phii
|}
Forms with high vowels (''i, u'') tend to raise preceding mid vowels to high, just as ''-bii'' does. The 3.sg copula tends to sound like a ''-ya(ko)'' or ''-wa(ko)'' after high and often mid vowels: {{IPA|/oa, ea/}} ≈ {{IPA|[owa, eja]}}, and transcriptions with ''w'' and ''y'' are common in the literature. 

====Pronouns====
Personal and demonstrative pronouns are:
{|class=wikitable
|+Pronouns
! ||m.sg.||f.sg.||f.pl.||m.pl
|-
!1.exclusive
|rowspan=2|ono ||rowspan=2|onoko ||ôbee ||ûbii
|-
!1.inclusive
|onebee||unibii
|-
!2
|the||theko||ethebee||ithibii
|-
!3.proximal

|-

|-
!3.distal
|naha||nâko||nâbee||nâbii
|-
!3.invisible
|himiggê||himiggîko||himiggêbee||himiggîbii
|}
There are some additional 3rd-person pronouns, including some compound forms. Adverbs are formed from the 3rd-person forms by adding locative ''-na'': ''hamana'' 'here', ''beena'' 'there', ''naná'' 'over there', ''himiggêna'' 'in/behind there'.

===Verbs and adjectives===
An [[infix]] {{angle bracket|kV}}, where V is an [[echo vowel]], occurs after the first syllable of verbs to indicate [[pluractional]]ity.

The copula was covered above. Hadza has several [[auxiliary verb]]s: sequential ''ka-'' and ''ya-'' 'and then', negative ''akhwa-'' 'not', and [[subjunctive]] ''i-''. Their inflections may be irregular or have different inflectional endings from those of lexical verbs,&lt;ref&gt;''Ya'' and ''ka'' take ''-ˆto, -tikwa, -ˆte, -ˆti'' in the 3rd-person posterior rather than ''-amo, -akwa, -ame, -ami'', for example. In lexical verbs, those endings are used with habitual ''-hé-'' to emphasize it.&lt;/ref&gt; which are as follows:

{|class=wikitable
|+Hadza [[tense–aspect–mood]] inflections
! ||anterior/&lt;br&gt;non-past||posterior/&lt;br&gt;past||potential&lt;br&gt;conditional||[[veridical]]&lt;br&gt;conditional||imperative/&lt;br&gt;[[hortative]]||purposive&lt;br&gt;(subjunctive)

|-
!3m.pl

|}

The functions of the anterior and posterior differ between auxiliaries; with lexical verbs, they are non-past and past. The potential and veridical conditionals reflex the degree of certainty that something would have occurred. 1sg.npst ''-ˆta'' and a couple other forms lengthen the preceding vowel. The 1.ex forms apart from ''-ya'' begin with a glottal stop. The imp.sg is a glottal stop followed by an [[echo vowel]].

Habitual forms take a tonic ''-hé'', which tends to reduce to a long vowel, before these endings. In some verbs, the habitual has become lexicalized (marking the {{sc|3.post}} forms with glottal stop), and so an actual habitual takes a second ''-hé''. Various compound tense-aspect-moods occur by doubling up the inflectional endings. There are several additional inflections which have not been worked out.

The inflectional endings are [[clitic]]s and may occur on an adverb before the verb, leaving a bare verb stem (verb root plus object suffixes).

====Attributives====
As is common in the area, there are only a few bare-root adjectives in Hadza, such as ''pakapaa'' 'big'. Most attributive forms take a suffix with cross-gender&amp;nbsp;number marking: ''-e'' (m.sg. and f.pl.) or ''-i'' (f.sg. and m.pl.). These agree with the noun they modify. The ''-i'' form tends to trigger vowel harmony, so that, for example, the adjective ''one-'' 'sweet' has the following forms:

{|class=wikitable
|+''one'' 'sweet'
! ||sg.||pl
|-
!m
| onê (onehe)||unîbii
|-
!f
| unîko||onêbee
|}
The ''-ko/-bee/-bii'' ending may be replaced by the copula, but the ''e/i'' cross-number&amp;nbsp;gender marking remains.

Demonstratives, adjectives, and other attributives may occur before or after a noun, but nouns only take their gender&amp;nbsp;number endings when they occur first in the noun phrase: ''Ondoshibii unîbii'' 'sweet cordia berries', ''manako unîko'' 'tasty meat', but ''unîbii ondoshi'' and ''unîko mana''. Similarly, ''dongoko bôko'' but ''bôko dongo'' 'those zebra'.

Verbs may also be made attributive: ''dluzîko akwiti'' 'the woman (''akwitiki'') who is speaking', from ''dlozo'' 'to say'. This attributive form is used with the copula to form the [[progressive aspect]]: ''dlozênee'' 'I am speaking' (male speaker), ''dluzîneko'' 'I am speaking' (female speaker).

====Object marking====
Verbs may take up to two object suffixes, for a direct object (DO) and indirect object (IO). These only differ in the 1ex and 3sg. The IO suffixes are also used on nouns to indicate possession (''mako-kwa'' 'my pot', ''mako-a-kwa'' 'it is my pot').

{|class=wikitable
|+Object/possessive suffixes
!rowspan=2| !!colspan=2|sing.!!colspan=2|plural
|-
!DO||IO||DO||IO
|-
!1.ex
|rowspan=2 colspan=2| -kwa || -oba || -ya
|-
!1.in
|colspan=2| -ona ~ -yona
|-
!2m
|colspan=2| -ena||colspan=2 rowspan=2| -ina
|-
!2f
|colspan=2| -na
|-
!3m
| -a ~ -ya ~ -na||-ma||colspan=2| -itcha
|-
!3f
| -ta||-sa||colspan=2| -eta
|}
Two object suffixes are only allowed if the first (the DO) is 3rd person. In such cases the DO reduces to the form of the attributive suffix: ''-e'' (m.sg. / f.pl.) or ''-i'' (f.sg. / m.pl.); only context tells which combination of number and gender is intended. 3rd-singular direct objects also reduce to this form in the imperative singular; 3rd-plural change their vowels but do not conflate with the singular: see 'dead zebra' under nouns above for an example of the forms.

===Word order===
The factors governing the word order within noun phrases are not known. Constituent order tends to be SXVO (where X is an auxiliary) for a new or emphasized subject, with the subject moving further back (XSVO, XVSO, and XVOS), or simply not mentioned (XVO) the better it is established. Where context, semantics, and the verbal suffixes fail to disambiguate, ''verb–noun–noun'' is understood to be VSO.

==Numerals==
The Hadza did not have numerals before the introduction of [[Swahili language]]. Native numerals are ''itchâme'' 'one' and ''pie'' 'two'. ''Sámaka'' 'three' is a [[Datooga language|Datooga]] loan, and ''bone'' 'four', ''bothano'' 'five', and ''ikhumi'' 'ten' are [[Sukuma language|Sukuma]]. ''Aso'' 'many' is commonly used instead of ''bothano'' for 'five'. There is no systematic way to express other numbers without using Swahili.

==Dead animal names==
Hadza has received some attention&lt;ref&gt;E.g. in Parkvall (2006) ''Limits of language''&lt;/ref&gt; for a dozen 'celebratory' (Woodburn) or 'triumphal' (Blench) names for dead animals. These are used to announce a kill. They are (in the imperative singular):

{|class=wikitable
|-
!Animal!!Generic name!!Triumphal name
|-
|zebra||dóngoko||hantáii
|-
|giraffe||zzókwanako||háwaii
|-
|buffalo||naggomako||tíslii
|-
|leopard||nqe, tcanjai||henqêe
|-
|lion||séseme||hubuee
|-
|eland||khomatiko||hubuii
|-
|impala||p(h)óphoko||dlunkúii
|-
|wildebeest&lt;br&gt;hartebeest||bisoko&lt;br&gt;qqeleko||zzonoii
|-
|colspan=2|other large antelope||hephêe
|-
|colspan=2|small antelope||hingcíee
|-
|rhinoceros||tlhákate||hukhúee
|-
|elephant&lt;br&gt;hippopotamus||beggáuko&lt;br&gt;wezzáiko||kapuláii
|-
|warthog&lt;br&gt;boar||dláha&lt;br&gt;kwa'i||hatcháee
|-
|baboon||neeko||nqokhóii
|-
|ostrich||khenangu||hushúee
|}
The words are somewhat generic: ''henqêe'' may be used for any spotted cat, ''hushuee (hushuwee)'' for any running ground bird. 'Lion' and 'eland' use the same root. Blench (2008) thinks this may have something to do with the eland being considered magical in the region.

An IO suffix may be used to reference the person who made the kill. Compare ''hanta-'' 'zebra' with the more mundane verbs, ''qhasha'' 'to carry' and ''kw-'' 'to give', in the imperative singular and plural (Miller 2009):
:{{interlinear|italics2=yes|glossing3=yes| lang1=hts|lang2=hts
|hanta-i-i hanta-i-ko-o
|hanta-ta-te hanta-i-kwa-te
|zebra-DO.{{gcl|3fs}}-IMP zebra-DO.{{gcl|3fs}}-IO.{{gcl|3fs}}-IMP
|{"A zebra!"} {"I got a zebra!"}&lt;ref&gt;These glosses are crude; these words do not translate into Swahili or English&lt;/ref&gt;|}}

:{{interlinear|italics2=yes|glossing3=yes| lang1=hts|lang2=hts
|qhasha-i-i kw-i-ko-o
|qhasha-ta-te kw-i-kwa-te
|carry-DO.{{gcl|3fs}}-IMP give-DO.{{gcl|3fs}}-IO.{{gcl|3fs}}-IMP
|{"Carry it!} {"Give it to me!"}|}}

==Speculations about early human language==
In 2003 the press widely reported suggestions by Alec Knight and Joanna Mountain of [[Stanford University]] that the original human language may have had clicks. The purported evidence for this is genetic: speakers of [[Juǀ'hoan dialect|Juǀ'hoan]] and Hadza have the most divergent known [[mitochondrial DNA]] of any human populations, suggesting that they were the first, or at least among the first, surviving peoples to have split off the family tree. In other words, the three primary genetic divisions of humanity are the Hadza, the Juǀʼhoan and relatives, and everyone else. Because two of the three groups speak languages with clicks, perhaps their common ancestral language, which by implication is the ancestral language for all humankind, had clicks as well.

However, besides the genetic interpretation, this conclusion rests on several unsupported assumptions: 
* Both groups have kept their languages, without [[language shift]], since they branched off from the rest of humanity;
* Neither group borrowed clicks as part of a [[sprachbund]], as the Bantu languages [[Zulu language|Zulu]], [[Sotho language|Sotho]], and [[Yeyi language|Yeyi]] did; and
* Neither the ancestors of the Juǀʼhoan nor those of the Hadza developed clicks independently.

There is no evidence that any of these assumptions are correct, or even likely. Linguistic opinion is that click consonants may well be a relatively late development in human language, that they are no more resistant to change or any more likely to be linguistic relics than other speech sounds, and that they are easily borrowed: at least one Khoisan language, [[ǁXegwi language|ǁXegwi]], is believed to have reborrowed clicks from Bantu languages, which had earlier borrowed them from Khoisan languages, for example. The Knight and Mountain article is the latest in a long line of speculations about the primitive origin of click consonants, which have been largely motivated by the outdated idea that primitive people speak primitive languages, which has no empirical support.&lt;ref&gt;Sands &amp; Güldemann, 2009, "What click languages can and can't tell us about language origins". In Botha &amp; Knight, eds, ''The Cradle of Language'', Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hamid Umar Dalwai''' (20 September 1932 – 3 May 1977) was a Muslim social reformer, thinker, activist and [[Marathi language]] writer in [[Maharashtra]], [[India]].&lt;ref name="toi"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/575825.cms|title=Liberal India on the Defensive|author=Guha, Ramachandra|authorlink=Ramchandra Guha|date=23 March 2004|work=The Times of India|accessdate=15 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
He was born in a [[Marathi language|Marathi]]-speaking [[Muslim]] family in the [[Ratnagiri district]] of [[Konkan]].&lt;ref name="ind"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/oldStory/1957/|title=Remembering Hamid Dalwai, and an age of questioning|author=Chitre, Dilip|authorlink=Dilip Chitre|date=3 May 2002|work=Indian Express}}&lt;/ref&gt; His Village is Mirjoli near Chiplun.

==Career==
Dalwai joined the [[Socialist Party (India)#Indian Socialist Party|Indian Socialist Party]] of [[Jai Prakash Narayan]] in his early adulthood, but left it to devote himself to social reforms in the Muslim community, especially regarding women's rights. Despite living in a period when most people were staunchly religious and orthodox, Hamid Dalwai was one among the few religiously secular people. He strove towards a [[uniform civil code]] rather than religion specific laws, and fought to abolish [[Triple talaq in India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/maharashtra-51-years-ago-hamid-dalwai-took-out-first-march-against-triple-talaq-4617356/|title=Maharashtra: 51 years ago, Hamid Dalwai took out first march against triple talaq|date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To create a platform for his views and work, he established the ''Muslim Satyashodhak Mandal'' (Muslim Truth Seeking Society) in Pune on 22 March 1970. Through the medium of this Society, Hamid worked towards reforming bad practices in the Muslim community especially towards women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://punemirror.indiatimes.com/news/india/triple-talaq-verdict-51-years-ago-hamid-dalwai-among-those-who-began-the-fight-for-rights-of-muslim-women/articleshow/60174701.cms|title=Triple Talaq Verdict: 51 Years Ago, Hamid Dalwai Among Those Who Began the Fight for Rights of Muslim Women|date=22 August 2017|work=[[Mumbai Mirror]]|via=[[Pune Mirror]]|accessdate=15 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He helped many Muslim women who were victimised to get justice. He campaigned for encouraging Muslims in acquiring education in the State language rather than Urdu, their mother tongue. He also tried to make adoption an acceptable practice in the Indian Muslim community.

He also established the Muslim Secular Society. He organised many public meetings, gatherings, conventions and conferences to campaign for better social practices. He was also a great Marathi litterateur. He wrote Indhan (Fuel) - a novel, Laat (Wave) - a collection of short stories and Muslim Politics in Secular India - a thought provoking book. He used the medium of his writing for social reform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.livemint.com/Politics/LsHfiKKArFEALIqF2HKBgP/Hamid-Dalwai-the-man-who-led-triple-talaq-stir-in-1967.html|title=Hamid Dalwai, the man who led triple talaq stir in 1967|author1=Abhiram Ghadyalpatil|author2=Shreya Agarwal|date=24 August 2017|accessdate=15 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An unprecedented event in his social work was the Muslim women’s march that he organised on the Mantralaya (the administrative headquarters of Maharashtra in South Mumbai, built in 1955) to fight for their rights. Hamid Dalwai dealt with opposition with tremendous equanimity and worked towards social reform without getting discouraged at the slow rate of success. It is because of these traits that the great Marathi genius P. L. Aka PuLa Deshpande described him as a great social reformer and put him in the same bracket as the great Indian leaders Mahatma Jyotiba Phule and Ambedkar.

He died of progressive [[kidney failure]] on 3 May 1977, at the age of 44.&lt;ref name="ind"/&gt;

==Literary works==
Dalwai worked as a journalist. His works include ''Lat'' (The Wave) and ''Indhan'' (Fuel) in Marathi, and ''Muslim Politics In Secular India'' in English, ''Islam che Bhartiya Chitr'' (Islam's Indian story) in Marathi, ''Rashtriya Ekatmata aani Bhartiya Musalman'' (National Unity and Indian Muslim) in Marathi.He also has written  a short story namely "10 rupayachi goshta" which was later published in "Dhanurdhara" magazine.

==Family==
Dalwai's brother [[Husain Dalwai]] is a Congress leader in Maharashtra. He is currently a member of Parliament upper house - Rajya Sabha. He also served as a Congress spokesperson in Maharashtra.

'''Independent radio''' indicates a [[radio station]] that is run in a manner different from usual for the country it broadcasts in. In countries where there exist government-run radio stations that served as the primary or only the variety of licensed broadcaster, the term independent radio generally means [[commercial radio]] stations which are not operated by the government, and thus ''independent'' of the government.

Conversely, in places such as the [[United States]], where [[commercial broadcaster]]s are the norm, independent radio is sometimes used to refer to [[non-commercial educational]] radio stations that are primarily supported by listener contributions and are thus ''independent'' of commercial [[advertising]] concerns.  With the advent of large commercial broadcast [[radio network]] companies, and the general adoption of the term ''[[public radio]]'' in the United States to refer to non-[[religious radio]]-oriented listener-supported stations, the term has also been used to refer to [[commercial radio]] stations that are run ''independently'' of the large radio conglomerates.

'''Iorwerth Peate''', also known as '''Cyfeiliog''', (27 February 1901 – 19 October 1982) was a [[Welsh people|Welsh]] [[poet]] and scholar, best known as the founder, along with [[Cyril Fox]], of [[St Fagans National History Museum]]. Born in [[Llanbrynmair]] into a family of carpenters, his interest in folk studies and anthropology was kindled when studying Colonial History and Geography at [[Aberystwyth University]] under professor [[Herbert John Fleure]] and writer [[Thomas Gwynn Jones|T.

Peate began his career by lecturing in rural [[Ceredigion]] and [[Merionethshire|Meirioneth]], before being appointed in 1927 to catalogue the [[National Museum of Wales]]' folk collections.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Inspired by the open-air museums of Scandinavia, Peate had a vision of recreating this style of attraction, but for Welsh life and culture.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; His initial attempts were challenged by those outside and inside the academic world. The work on the museum commenced in 1946, thanks to the donation of land from the [[Earl of Plymouth]].

Peate published work on the study of folk life in both [[English language|English]] and [[Welsh language|Welsh]]. He was a pacifist who registered as a [[conscientious objector]] in 1941 and believed in a monoglot Welsh-speaking Wales.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Peate was a judge for the [[National Eisteddfod of Wales|National Eisteddfod]] for a number of years.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

Peate received a number of honours over his life. He was awarded an [[Honorary degree|honourary doctorate]] by both the [[National University of Ireland]] and the [[University of Wales]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; He declined a 1963 New Years honour appointment as an Officer of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (OBE).{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

Peate, along with his wife, is buried in the Unitarian chapel on the grounds of St Fagans National History Museum.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4643">'''Irish kinship''' is a system of [[kinship terminology]] (descended from the original [[Celts|Celtic]] practices) which shows a bifurcate collateral pattern. This system is used by a minority of people living in the [[Gaeltacht]] regions of Ireland. Irish [[kinship]] terminology varies from English kinship as it focuses on gender and generation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kelly|first=Fergus|title=A guide to early Irish law&amp;ndash;Volume 3 of Early Irish law series|year=1988|publisher=Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies|location=the University of Michigan|isbn=0-901282-95-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TQOQAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=isbn:0901282952&amp;dq=isbn:0901282952&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=RRaCT8rYMoapiQLT37jsAg&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAA|edition=Reprint, Digitized.|accessdate=Oct 24, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; with less emphasis on differentiating lineal vs. collateral.&lt;ref name=EveryCulture.com&gt;{{cite web|title=Countries and Their Cultures&amp;ndash;Gaels (Irish) Kinship|url=http://www.everyculture.com/Europe/Gaels-Irish-Kinship.html|publisher=EveryCulture.com|accessdate=April 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
Irish kinship is limited to a small number of words of [[Irish language|Gaelic]] origin used in identifying relatives.

Máthair - Mother&lt;br /&gt;
Athair - Father&lt;br /&gt;
Mac - Son&lt;br /&gt;
Iníon - Daughter&lt;br /&gt;
Deartháir - Brother&lt;br /&gt;
Deirfiúr - Sister&lt;br /&gt;
Aintín- Aunt&lt;br /&gt;
Uncail - Uncle&lt;br /&gt;
Nia - Nephew&lt;br /&gt;
Neacht - Niece&lt;br /&gt;
Seanmháthair - Grandmother&lt;br /&gt;
Seanathair - Grandfather&lt;br /&gt;
Garmhac - Grandson&lt;br /&gt;
Gariníon - Granddaughter&lt;br /&gt;
Col Gaolta - Cousin&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Irish Lessons|url=http://www.phouka.com/irish/ir_family.html|accessdate=8 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use of terminology==
A majority of the terms used in the kinship system are similar to the English kinship system, but the terms for aunt, uncle, nephew, niece and cousin have a far vaguer and different use. These terms, however, vary in degree of use as this system is largely confined to the Gaeltacht regions, and hence not widely used among other members of Irish society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Gaeltacht Mary proud to represent her heritage|journal=Donegal Democrat|date=July 2, 2010|url=http://www.donegaldemocrat.ie/news/local/gaeltacht_mary_proud_to_represent_her_heritage_1_2005478#|accessdate=8 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system has, however, been previously taught in primary schools around the country, including in non-Gaeltacht areas.

===Aintin and Uncail, Nia and Neacht===
''Aintin'' is the word for ''aunt'' and ''Uncail'' for ''uncle'' but in the Irish kinship system aunt and uncle have a wider definition; in common kinship an aunt or uncle is the sister or brother of either the mother or the father. However, in Irish kinship, ''Aintin'' and ''Uncail'' are used for not only the siblings of the parents, but as well for any relative whose age is of a great distance from the child. This effectively means the cousin of a parent is called an aunt or uncle, while those who are aged or in their senior years (aunts or uncles of a parent, or cousins of a grandparent) are termed ''Seanaintin'' and ''Seanuncail'' ([[Cousin chart|great aunt]] and great uncle). Using this system, the children of cousins in a person’s own generation (however distant) are called nephews and nieces, using the terms ''Nia'' and ''Neacht.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chadwick|first=Nora|title=The Celts|year=1998|publisher=Penguin History (Non-Classics)|isbn=0-14-025074-3|edition=Second}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grandchildren of brothers, sisters or cousins of the same generation are termed ''Garnia'' (great-nephew) or ''Garneacht'' (great-niece).

===Col Gaolta===
''Col Gaolta'' is a word for cousin; in the Irish kinship system, this word is used for all relatives in one's generation or those near your age, except in the case of a brother or a sister. The word actually means ''related by blood''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Green|first=Miranda J.|title=The Celtic World "Politics and Status &amp;ndash; Timothy Champion"|year=1996|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=0-415-14627-5|pages=85&amp;ndash;94|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I8dA94h22S4C&amp;dq=ISBN+0415146275&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|accessdate=7 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mo Mhuintir===
Mo Mhuintir, being Irish for ''My People'', is a vague term used for relatives people believe they are related to, but do not have enough information to determine how.&lt;ref name="EveryCulture.com" /&gt;

==Role in Esperanto literature==
Karel Píč was a famous and influential Esperanto author.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.transparent.com/esperanto/five-periods-of-esperanto-literature/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bl.uk/reshelp/findhelplang/esperanto/esperantocollections/esperantocols.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://literaturo.org/HARLOW-Don/Esperanto/Literaturo/Recenzoj/litrev.html|title=Recenzo: Kvar priliteraturaj verkaj^oj (William AULD, Vilmos BENCZIK)|last=Harlow|first=Donald J.|website=literaturo.org|access-date=2016-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; He introduced and used many [[neologism]]s, which was controversial.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://literaturo.org/HARLOW-Don/Esperanto/Literaturo/Recenzoj/la_bona_lingvo.html|title=Review: La bona lingvo (Don HARLOW)|website=literaturo.org|access-date=2016-09-29}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from neologisms, he was noted for his experimental usage of [[Esperanto]]; some commentators go so far as to call his usage "piĉido" and imply it is almost another language.&lt;ref&gt;[[:eo:Karolo Piĉ]]&lt;/ref&gt;

His best known work, epitomizing his linguistic experimentation&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://literaturo.org/HARLOW-Don/Esperanto/EBook/app04.html|title=The Esperanto Book: Appendix 4|website=literaturo.org|access-date=2016-09-29}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
, is the semi-autobiographical novel ''La Litomiŝla tombejo (The Litomyšl Cemetery)'' (1981) set in his hometown of [[Litomyšl]]. Upon his death, Píč was buried in that cemetery, and his tombstone bears the Czech words “Esperantský spisovatel” (“Esperanto writer”).

The "Concise Encyclopedia of the Original Literature of Esperanto" quotes several influential Esperantists about the importance of ''La Litomiŝla tombejo''. [[Osmo Buller]] wrote "it is something truly important in Esperanto literature", and [[Jorge Camacho (writer)|Jorge Camacho]] claimed it as "probably the highest achievement of [Esperanto's] original literature". Esperanto poet [[William Auld]] included the novel on his list of Esperanto classics.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.esperanto-usa.org/en/node/1512&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
[[Image:Klas Östergren at Göteborg Book Fair 2014.JPG|thumb|Klas Östergren in 2014.]]
Östergren was born in 1955 on [[Lilla Essingen]] in [[Stockholm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dn.se/kultur-noje/klas-ostergren-en-gentleman-med-twist/|title=Klas Östergren – En gentleman med twist|work=DN.SE}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the youngest of four siblings.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;http://www.svenskaakademien.se/akademien/de_aderton/klas_östergren {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141221114804/http://www.svenskaakademien.se/akademien/de_aderton/klas_%C3%B6stergren |date=21 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His father was Finnish and his mother was Swedish.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Östergren|first=Klas|author2=Farran-Lee Stephen|title=Östergren om Östergren: i samtal med Stephen Farran-Lee|year=2007|publisher=Bonnier|location=Stockholm|language=sv|isbn=9789100111052}}&lt;/ref&gt; He went to secondary school at [[Södra Latins gymnasium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fokus.se/2013/03/vart-jag-an-gar-sa-traffar-jag-darar/|title=»Vart jag än går så träffar jag dårar«|work=Fokus – Sveriges nyhetsmagasin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Klas Östergren was soon to turn twenty years old when his first novel, ''Attila'', was published in 1975.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; He gained critical acclaim and high readership five years later with the novel, ''[[Gentlemen (novel)|Gentlemen]]''.  As a writer of screenplays and teleplays, he was honored in 1999 when ''Veranda för en tenor'' [''Waiting for the Tenor''], the screen treatment (which he co-wrote with Lisa Ohlin) of a short story from ''Med stövlarna på och andra berättelser'', was nominated for the [[Guldbagge Award for Best Screenplay]] (Sweden's equivalent of the [[Academy Award]]).  He is also one of his country's most highly regarded literary translators, having published a [[Swedish-language]] version of [[J. D. Salinger]]'s ''[[The Catcher in the Rye]]'' and also having translated a two-volume edition (issued in September 2008) of the plays of [[Henrik Ibsen]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.norstedtsforlagsgrupp.se/templates/norstedts/NorBook.aspx?id=48851 New edition of the plays of Henrik Ibsen, translated by Klas Östergren] (on the website of [[Norstedts Förlag|Norstedts]], Sweden's oldest publishing house)&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1982 to 1989, Klas Östergren was married to Swedish actress, Pernilla Wallgren, who subsequently continued her career using the name Pernilla Östergren.  They became the parents of a daughter, Agnes; and following their divorce and Pernilla's marriage to director [[Bille August]], she appeared, using her new professional name, [[Pernilla August]], in two films for which Östergren wrote the screenplays.  The first, 1996's ''[[Jerusalem (1996 film)|Jerusalem]]'', adapted from [[Jerusalem (novel)|the novel]] by [[Selma Lagerlöf]], was directed by her husband, Bille August, and the other, ''Offer och gärningsmän'', was a 1999 [[miniseries]] directed for Sweden's national television broadcaster, [[Sveriges Television|SVT]], by [[Tomas Alfredson]]. His second and current wife is Cilla, with whom he has three children, Åke, Gösta, and Märta.

The 1980 novel ''[[Gentlemen (novel)|Gentlemen]]'' was filmed in 2014 by director [[Mikael Marcimain]].&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

'''Kom''' is a [[Kuki-Chin languages|Kuki-Chin language]] of [[India]]. Kohlreng is usually considered a dialect of Kom, but may be a distinct language. [[Kom people (India)|Speakers of Kom]] live in the hilly provinces of [[Northeastern India]]. The dialect of [[Manipur]] has at least partial mutual intelligibility with the other Kukish dialects of the area, including [[Thadou language|Thadou]], [[Hmar language|Hmar]], [[Vaiphei language|Vaiphei]], [[Simte language|Simte]], [[Paite language|Paite]], and [[Gangte language|Gangte]] languages.&lt;ref name=Singh&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Singh|first1=Chungkham Yashawanta|title=The linguistic situation in Manipur|journal=Linguistics of the Tibeto-Burman Area|date=1995|volume=18|issue=1|pages=129–134|url=http://sealang.net/sala/archives/pdf8/singh1995linguistic.pdf|accessdate=19 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aimol language|Aimol]], [[Koireng language|Koireng]] and [[Chiru language|Chiru]] speakers also understand Kom.

'''Komi Nje''' (Ԋ&amp;nbsp;ԋ; italics: &lt;span style="font-family: times, Times New Roman, serif; font-size: larger"&gt;''Ԋ&amp;nbsp;ԋ''&lt;/span&gt;) is a letter of the [[Molodtsov alphabet]], a variant of [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]]. It was used only in the writing of the [[Komi language]] in the 1920s and in the [[Mordvin language]].{{citation needed | date=May 2011 | reason=not shown anywhere in the Mordvin language articles}} Its form is similar to the [[Hwair|Latin letter Hwair]] (Ƕ&amp;nbsp;ƕ), but the lowercase form is a small version of the capital letter. 
Komi Nje represents the [[palatal nasal]] {{IPA|/ɲ/}}, somewhat like the pronunciation of {{angbr|ni}} in "o'''ni'''on". It corresponds to the [[Nje|Cyrillic letter Nje]] (Њ&amp;nbsp;њ), and to the [[Ǌ|Latin digraph Ǌ]] (Ǌ&amp;nbsp;ǋ&amp;nbsp;ǌ) used in the [[Serbo-Croatian|Croatian and Serbian]] languages.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10623">The '''LRE Map''' (Language Resources and Evaluation) is a freely accessible large database on resources dedicated to [[Natural language processing]]. The original feature of LRE Map is that the records are collected during the submission of different major [[Natural language processing]] conferences. The records are then cleaned and gathered into a global database called "LRE Map".&lt;ref&gt;Nicoletta Calzolari, Claudia Soria, Riccardo Del Gratta, Sara Goggi, Valeria Quochi, Irene Russo, Khalid Choukri, Joseph Mariani, Stelios Piperidis, 2010 The LREC Map of Language Resources and Technologies. LREC-2010, Malta&lt;/ref&gt;

The LRE Map is intended to be an instrument for collecting information about language resources and to become, at the same time, a community for users, a place to share and discover resources, discuss opinions, provide feedback, discover new trends, etc. It is an instrument for discovering, searching and documenting language resources, here intended in a broad sense, as both data and tools.

The large amount of information contained in the Map can be analyzed in many different ways. A few, general analyses are available on the Resource Map website at http://www.resourcebook.eu (click on the “Show (Hide) Quick Pies” link). For instance, the LRE Map can provide information about the most frequent type of resource, the most represented language, the applications for which resources are used or are being developed, the proportion of new resources vs. already existing ones, or the way in which resources are distributed to the community.

== Context ==
Several institutions worldwide maintain catalogues of language resources
([[Elra|ELRA]], [[Linguistic Data Consortium|LDC]], [[NICT]] Universal Catalogue, [[Association for Computational Linguistics|ACL]] Data and Code Repository, [[Olac|OLAC]], LT World, etc.)&lt;ref&gt;FlaReNet Technical report, the language resources and evaluation (LRE) Map, Nicoletta Calzolari (CNR-ILC Pisa, Italy), Claudia Soria, Irene Russo, Francesco Rubino, Riccardo Del Gratta. eContentPlus project [http://www.flarenet.eu]&lt;/ref&gt; However, it has been estimated that only 10% of existing resources are known, either through distribution catalogues or via direct publicity by providers (web sites and the like). The rest remains hidden, the only occasions where it briefly emerges being when a resource is presented in the context of a research paper or report at some conference. Even in this case, nevertheless, it might be that a resource remains in the background simply because the focus of the research is not on the resource ''per se''.

== History ==
The LRE Map originated under the name "LREC Map" during the preparation of [[LREC]] 2010 conference.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lrec-conf.org/proceedings/lrec2010/introductory/nc.pdf Nicoletta Calzolari, Introduction of the Conference Chair LREC 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; More specifically, the idea was discussed within the FlaReNet project, and in collaboration with [http://www.elra.info ELRA] and the [http://www.ilc.cnr.it Institute of Computational Linguistics of CNR in Pisa], the Map was put in place at LREC 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lrec-conf.org/lrec2010 7th edition of the Language Resources and Evaluation Conference, Valletta, Malta]&lt;/ref&gt; The LREC organizers asked the authors to provide some basic information about all the resources (in a broad sense, i.e. including tools, standards and evaluation packages), either used or created, described in their papers. All these descriptors were then gathered in a global matrix called the LREC Map.

The same methodology and requirements from the authors has been then applied and extended to other conferences, namely COLING-2010,&lt;ref&gt;The 23rd International Conference on Computational Linguistics, Beijing, China [http://www.coling-2010.org]&lt;/ref&gt; EMNLP-2010,&lt;ref&gt;Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing 9–11 October, MIT Stata Center, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA [http://www.lsi.upc.edu/events/emnlp2010]&lt;/ref&gt; RANLP-2011,&lt;ref&gt;Recent advances in Natural Language Processing 12–14 September, Hissar, Bulgaria [http://lml.bas.bg/ranlp2011/start3.php]&lt;/ref&gt; LREC 2012,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lrec-conf.org/lrec2012 8th edition of the Language Resources and Evaluation Conference, Istanbul, Turkey]&lt;/ref&gt; LREC 2014&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lrec-conf.org/lrec2014 9th edition of the Language Resources and Evaluation Conference, Reykjavik, Iceland]&lt;/ref&gt; and LREC 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lrec-conf.org/lrec2016 10th edition of the Language Resources and Evaluation Conference, Portoroz, Slovenia]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;
After this generalization to other conferences, the LREC Map has been renamed as the '''LRE Map'''.

== Size and content ==
The size of the database increases over time. The data collected amount to 4776 entries.

Each resource is described according to the following attributes:
* Resource type, e.g. [[lexicon]], annotation tool, [[Parser|tagger/parser]].
* Resource production status, e.g. newly created finished, existing-updated.
* Resource availability, e.g. freely available, from data center.
* Resource modality, e.g. [[speech]], written, [[sign language]].
* Resource use, e.g. [[named entity recognition]], [[language identification]], [[machine translation]].
* Resource language, e.g. English, 23 European Union languages, official languages of India.

== Uses ==
The LRE map is a very important tool to chart the NLP field. Compared to other studied based on subjective scorings, the LRE map is made of real facts.

The map has a great potential for many uses, in addition to being an information gathering tool:

* It is a great instrument for monitoring the evolution of the field (useful for funders), if applied in different contexts and times.
* It can be seen as a huge joint effort, the beginning of an even larger cooperative action not just among few leaders but among all the researchers.
* It is also an "educational" means towards the broad acknowledgment of the need of meta-research activities with the active involvement of many.
* It is also instrumental in introducing the new notion of "citation of resources" that could provide an award and a means of scholarly recognition for researchers engaged in resource creation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1591">"'''The law of the suppression of radical potential'''" is an idea first described by [[Brian Winston]] in his book, ''Misunderstanding Media''. According to the law, when a communications technology is realized, its growth is suppressed through the constraining influence of already prevailing institutions and other mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=McQuail's Mass Communication Theory |authorlink=Denis McQuail |last=McQuail |first=Denis |page=156 |year=2010 |publisher=[[SAGE Publications]] |isbn=978-1-84920-292-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Winston shows how the law can be used as a model for describing the life cycle of many communications technologies. His approach is in particular directed against [[technological determinism]] and instead proposes that the [[emergence]] of new media and new technologies is mediated and controlled by society. According to Winston, a supervening social necessity creates a need for a particular technology, but the Law of the suppression of radical potential means that new technology will be integrated into the status quo as opposed to radically disrupting it. 

Winston has elaborated his model of technological change in particular in the books ''Technologies of Seeing: Photography, Cinematography and Television'' (1997) and ''Media Technology and Society: A History: From the Telegraph to the Internet'' (1998; Kindle publication in 2007 )

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="34923">An [[endangered language]] is a [[language]] that is at risk of falling out of use, generally because it has few surviving speakers. If it loses all of its native speakers, it becomes an [[extinct language]]. [[UNESCO]] defines [[Endangered language#UNESCO definitions|four levels of language endangerment]] between "safe" (not endangered) and "extinct":&lt;ref name="UNESCO"&gt;

=== Oneida (Iroquoian Language) ===
* Critically Endangered
* Visual Information/Cues teach the language&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
There is a "phonological process," or patterns used to simplify speech&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.superduperinc.com/handouts/pdf/66_Phonological.pdf|title = What Are Phonological Processes?|date = 2004|accessdate = October 27|website = Super Duper Inc|publisher = Super Duper Publications|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the Oneida language that has been passed down for generations, this process is described as the loss of voicing in the vowel of the last syllable of a word.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This process is vital to the preservation of the language, and has been changing among the speakers, such that some speakers have introduced a degree of voiced vowels in these final forms, which poises additional stress on the small population of speakers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The introduction in voicing the last syllable in words that typically are unvoiced is that it changes the traditional morphology of the language, pushing the original dialect towards language death, especially since the majority of speakers are older in age.

=== Blackfoot (Algonquian Language) ===
* Definitely Endangered
* Visual Information/Cues teach the language&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 
The Blackfoot language consists of the loss of voicing in the last syllable of a word, which is typically inaudible.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Certain inflections, or the use of inaudible vowels has been identified as "old Blackfoot" (traditional), and are not in frequent use by younger speakers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Similarly, a minority of Blackfoot speakers use the "soundless" suffixes, which is pushing the traditional language towards more extreme language endangerment and potentially language death.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Chipewyan (Athapaskan Language) ===
* Definitely Endangered
* Most speakers from Mid-to-late adulthood&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
The Chipewyan language exhibits morphological characteristics that are far more complex than the majority of European languages.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This includes conditioning of tone and morphology of phonemes, as well as frequent contractions, elisions, metatheses, and consonantal substitutions.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Chipewyan is mainly endangered due to its complex structure, which makes it difficult to decipher the morphological code, as well as the fact that the majority of the speakers are in their mid-late adulthood.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Assiniboine ===
*Critically Endangered
*Also called  Nakoda or Hohe
Assinibone is one of the language divisions out of five main language divisions within the Dakotan group of the Siouan family. The sound of this language differs from the other languages in the group because it merges voiceless stops with voiced stops. There are reports that syllabics to have been used by Assinibone speakers. (A written character to represent a syllable).  The Assiniboine language is spread over 2 communities in Canada, and is mainly used by older adults.

=== Central  Objiwe ===
*Definitely Endangered
*Also called Anishinaabemowin, Ojibway, and Chippewa
There are about 8,000 speakers in the central Ojibwe language, and it has been spread over 16 communities in Canada. The language is spoken from Ontario Canada to Manitoba. It is also spoken in places from Michigan to Montana next to the Great Lakes which is the home of the Ojibwe people. The language today is spoken by people over the age of 70. The people of the Ojibwe language note that double vowels in their language are treated as standing for unit sounds, therefore they are alphabetized after corresponding single values.

=== Lakota (Siouan Language) ===
* Critically Endangered
* Mutually intelligible with Dakota language
There are about 6,000 speakers in the Northern Plain States of North Dakota and South Dakota. Most native speakers are in their mid-50s.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Lakota: The Revitalization of Language and the Persistence of Spirit|url = http://www.truth-out.org/news/item/11971-lakota-the-revitalization-of-language-and-the-persistence-of-spirit|website = Truthout|accessdate = 2015-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a growing interest to revitalize the language.&lt;ref&gt;http://search.proquest.com/docview/305329568/&lt;/ref&gt; At the Red Cloud Indian school, there are immersion classes for children to teach the language. However, at the moment, there are no children on the Standing Rock Indian Reservation that are fluent in the language.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Within the next ten years, there will be children fluent in Lakota.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Dakota (Siouan Language) ===
* Definitely Endangered
* Mutually intelligible with Lakota language
There are about 20,000 native speakers, primarily in the North Dakota and South Dakota area, about 4,000 of which live in Minnesota.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;[http://search.proquest.com/docview/893756015/ Dakota language a resurgence among Native youth Guntzel, Jeff Severns. The Circle : News from an American Indian Perspective &amp;#91;Minneapolis&amp;#93; 01 Sep 2011: 7. ]&lt;/ref&gt; Dakota Wicohon is an after school camp that helps children learn the language, since it is not taught in the government-run boarding schools for American Indian youth.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; To help preservation efforts, technology like phraselators come into play, allowing learners to type in the words they want or orally speak the word they want and the machine will find it for them.&lt;ref&gt;http://search.proquest.com/docview/368736984/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dogrib (Northern Athabaskan Language) ===
* Vulnerable 
* Also called Tlinchon
There are about 2,640 speakers of the language in the Canadian Northwest Territories from the Great Slave Lake to the Great Bear Lake. Dogrib phonology is rather intricate and is organized into 5 levels.&lt;ref&gt;http://search.proquest.com/docview/922660326/&lt;/ref&gt; The first person to write a book in Dogrib was Herb Zimmerman, who translated the Bible into the language in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;http://search.proquest.com/docview/121496604/&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike many other Native American languages, there are children who are fluent in the language.&lt;ref&gt;http://search.proquest.com/docview/304122812/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Kaska (Athabaskan Language) ===
* Severely Endangered
This was typically a First Nations speaking language, and mainly lived in northern British Columbia and some from southeast Yukon in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.langcom.2014.05.004|title="She can do it in English too": Acts of intimacy and boundary-making in language revitalization|journal=Language &amp; Communication|volume=38|pages=73|year=2014|last1=Meek|first1=Barbra A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; People who speak Kaska today still live within the British Columbia and Yukon Territory area. The speakers are elders, such as grandparents, and their children and grandchildren would speak English. First Nations have started work to re-create and preserve their heritage language.&lt;ref&gt;http://search.proquest.com/docview/218126971&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ottawa (Ojibwe Language) ===
* Severely Endangered
* Also called Odawa
The number of people who speak the Ottawa dialect is unknown, though it is predicted to be around 13,000. Native communities received $5 million a year for 7 years (2007-2014) to help them in their efforts to preserve their languages and teach it to their children.&lt;ref&gt;http://search.proquest.com/docview/362648263&lt;/ref&gt; The language is written with Latin letters and is a dialect of the Ojibwe language. Many descendants of migrants now live in Kansas and Oklahoma.

=== Stoney (Siouan Language) ===
* Vulnerable
* Also called Nakoda or Alberta Assiniboine
There are roughly 3,200 people who speak Stoney in the Northern Plains and the Alberta province of Canada. Stoney has a Latin alphabet. The stress is one of the harder aspects about the language.&lt;ref&gt;http://search.proquest.com/docview/304340124/&lt;/ref&gt; The Stoney Indian Language Project was created to help make a standard format of the Stoney language. The project created 6 books for adults and children, as well as a videotape for third graders.&lt;ref&gt;http://search.proquest.com/docview/62818428/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Potawatomi (Central Algonquian Language) ===
* Critically Endangered

The Native American Cayuga speaking people are located in Oklahoma and Ontario.

=== Upper Tanana Language ===
* Critically Endangered
The Upper Tanana Language originally was spoken in only five villages, each with a different dialect. Those villages were Beaver Creek, Scottie Creek, Northway, Nabesna, and Tetlin. Today, the language is only spoken by about 95 people, above the age of 50, in eastern interior Alaska. Depending on the dialect, the Upper Tanana Language has about six to seven phonemic vowels. the primary difference between the dialects is by the pitch of the tone. Also a major factor in the split of different dialects is that different dialects have different vowel inventories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Web of Science [v.5.19]  -      Web of Science Core Collection Full Record|url = http://apps.webofknowledge.com/full_record.do?product=WOS&amp;search_mode=GeneralSearch&amp;qid=57&amp;SID=1BtUsNFXmHGkDita1au&amp;page=1&amp;doc=2|website = apps.webofknowledge.com|accessdate = 2015-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nootka Language ===
* Severely Endangered
Despite misinterpretation of studies which describe the phonetic inventory of Nootka, these studies do not suggest that its phonemic inventory is the main reason why the Nootka language may be severely endangered. A process known as glottalization is a key factor in being able to articulate certain sounds in the language, called ejective consonants. Though these sounds are not in English, they not linguistically rare. Many languages with a large body of speakers, including Arabic and Amharic contain these sounds, an observation which immediately discredits this theory. It is clear that Nootka, like all Canadian aboriginal languages, is endangered due to social factors alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Glottal stop, glottalized resonants, and pharyngeals: A reinterpretation with evidence from a laryngoscopic study of Nuuchahnulth (Nootka)|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095447005000197|journal = Journal of Phonetics|date = 2005-10-01|pages = 383–410|volume = 33|issue = 4|doi = 10.1016/j.wocn.2005.01.003|first = John H.|last = Esling|first2 = Katherine E.|last2 = Fraser|first3 = Jimmy G.|last3 = Harris}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, in the most common pronunciation of the phrase "doctors use penicillin" (if said out-of-the-blue), the syllable '-ci-' is the strongest or most stressed syllable in the phrase, but the syllable 'doc-' is more stressed than the syllable '-tors'. Previously, [[Generative linguistics|generative]] phonologists and the American [[Structuralism|Structuralists]] represented [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosodic]] prominence as a [[Feature (linguistics)|feature]] that applied to individual [[phonemes]] (segments) or [[syllables]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper

This feature could take on multiple values to indicate various levels of stress. Stress was assigned using the cyclic reapplication of rules to words and phrases. 

Metrical phonology holds that stress is separate from [[pitch accent]] and has phonetic effects on the realization of syllables beyond their [[Intonation (linguistics)|intonation]], including effects on their duration and [[amplitude]].&lt;ref name=Liberman-Prince/&gt; 
The perceived stress of a syllable results from its position in the metrical tree and metrical grid for the phrase it appears in.

==Metrical trees==
Linguistic prominence in metrical phonology is partially determined by the relations between nodes in a branching [[Tree structure|tree]], in which one node is Strong (S) and the other node or nodes are Weak (W). The labels Strong and Weak have no inherent phonetic realization, and only have meaning relative to the rest of the labels in the tree. A Strong node is stronger than its Weak sister node. The most prominent syllable in a phrase is the one that does not have any Weak nodes above it. This syllable is called the Designated Terminal Element. In the example tree (1), the syllable '-ci-' is the Designated Terminal Element. 

'''(1)'''[[Image:Metrical tree broad focus.JPG]]

Metrical trees allow us to change the stress pattern for a phrase by switching S and W sister nodes. The tree in (1) represents the metrical structure for the sentence "Doctors use penicillin". when the sentence is providing all new information. This is called [[Focus (linguistics)|broad focus]], and might be used in response to a question like "What did you learn at the hospital today?" The same metrical structure would be used when the sentence has [[Focus (linguistics)|narrow focus]] on the word 'penicillin'; for example, if it was used in response to a question like "What do doctors use to treat that disease?". However, we need a new metrical structure to put narrow focus on the word 'doctors', for example, if the phrase is used in response to the question "Who uses penicillin?" In this case, the S and W nodes at the intermediate phrase (ip) level have to switch, resulting in (2). 

'''(2)'''[[Image:Metrical tree narrow focus.JPG]]

In metrical phonology there has been debate about whether nodes on metrical trees must have two children, making them binary branching,&lt;ref name=Liberman-Prince/&gt;

Proponents of binary branching trees have claimed that such trees can constrain the restructuring of very long and very short constituents because new nodes created in this restructuring have to correspond to nodes in the original tree.&lt;ref name=Nespor-82/&gt; Proponents of n-ary branching trees point out that only multiple branches allow a limited number of tree levels, which can correspond to predetermined levels of prosodic constituents, whereas binary branching trees require intermediate levels that do not correspond to any prosodic constituent. A number of levels of prosodic constituents have been proposed, including: [[Mora (linguistics)|moras]], [[syllables]], [[Foot (prosody)|feet]], [[phonological word]]s, [[clitic]] groups, phonological phrases, intermediate phrases, [[Prosodic unit|intonational phrases]], and phonological utterances. The relations between prosodic constituents at different levels is commonly thought to be governed by the Strict Layer Hypothesis (SLH).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper
 | first = Elizabeth
 | last = Selkirk

 | version = 
 | publisher = MIT Press: Cambridge, MA
 | year = 1984
 | url =
 | page = 
 | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; This hypothesis states that in metrical trees, all prosodic constituents at a particular level consist exclusively of constituents from the level below. The SLH forbids a number of types of tree structures, including trees in which: a node has two parents in the level above, a node has two or more different types of children, a node has children from a level that is not the level immediately below it, a node does not correspond to any of the specified levels, or a node has children of the same type as itself. 

The various levels of the prosodic hierarchy are independently justified by the phonological phenomena that make reference to them. For instance, in English the sounds /p/, /t/, and /k/ are aspirated (followed by a puff of air) only if they are the first segment in a [[Foot (prosody)|foot]].&lt;ref name=Nespor /&gt; Similarly, in the Gorgia Toscana variety of Italian, the intonation phrase is the domain of a rule that changes [[Voice (phonetics)|voiceless]] [[plosives]] (/p/, /t/, /k/) between vowels into [[fricative consonant]]s, like /θ/ (th) and /h/.&lt;ref name=Nespor /&gt;

In addition to describing prominence relations between words, metrical trees can also describe prominence relations within words. Indeed, a set of rules developed by Liberman and Prince&lt;ref name=Liberman-Prince/&gt; can be used to quite accurately predict stress in English words. Their Lexical Category Prominence Rule states that the second node in a pair of sister nodes is labeled W unless one of a number of conditions are met, such as the node branching or dominating a particular suffix, in which case it is labeled S. Allowable tree structures and node labels for a particular word in Liberman and Prince's system are constrained by the two-value feature [± stress], which can be assigned to segments or syllables by separate rules that refer to the number and type of segments in the syllable and the syllable's position in the word.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper

==Metrical grids==
In a Metrical grid, all the words in the phrase are arranged along the bottom and the rows of the grid indicate different levels of prominence, as in (3).

(3) Example metrical grid

The higher the column of Xs above a syllable, the more prominent the syllable is. The metrical grid and the metrical tree for a particular utterance are related in such a way that the Designated Terminal Element of an S node must be more prominent than the Designated Terminal Element of its sister W node.&lt;ref name=Liberman-Prince/&gt; So in (3), the metrical grid for the utterance in (1), '-ci-' must be more prominent than 'doc-' because '-ci-' is the Designated Terminal Element of the highest S node and 'doc-' is the Designated Terminal Element of its sister W node. 

The structure of the metrical grid explains a number of otherwise surprising features of prominence patterns in language. For example, the main stress in English phrases may be placed several syllables away from the end of the phrase, even though the rule assigning this stress looks for a lexically stressed syllable near this boundary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper

 | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Using a metrical grid, this rule can simply apply to the rightmost element in the highest row of the grid. Therefore, what seemed to be a non-local application of the phrasal stress rule is reinterpreted as the local application of the rule to the highest row of the metrical grid. 

Metrical grids were originally developed to handle a phenomenon that appears in some languages, including English, German, and Masoretic Hebrew, in which stress shifts to avoid a 'stress clash'.&lt;ref name=Liberman-Prince/&gt; A stress clash can occur when two stressed syllables are too close to each other. For example, the word 'nineteen' spoken in isolation has stress on the second syllable. But when it is placed before 'girls' the stress on 'nineteen' can shift to the first syllable. Two syllables exhibit stress clash if there are two successive rows in the grid in which their columns are adjacent (i.e. there is no X between them). For example, in grid (4) the columns for 'teen' and 'girls' are adjacent in both the first and second rows, indicating a stress clash.

(4) Pre-stress-shift metrical grid

Stress clashes can be resolved by the Rhythm Rule, which reverses the S-W relation for some pair of sister nodes, as long as such a reversal does not put a Designated Terminal Element of an Intonational Phrase under any W node, and doesn't put a [- stress] syllable directly under an S node. In (4) the W and S nodes over 'nine-' and '-teen' can be reversed, leading to the non-clashing grid in (5).

This process is optional, and seems to be applied more often in some circumstances than others.

#Right-dominant vs. left-dominant: In a right-dominant language nodes on the right are labeled S, while in a left-dominant language nodes on the left are labeled S.
#Bounded vs. unbounded: In a bounded language the main stress appears a fixed distance from the word boundary and the secondary stress appears at fixed intervals from other stressed syllables. In an unbounded language the main stress is drawn to [[Syllable weight|'heavy' syllables]] (syllables with long vowels and/or consonants at the end of the syllable). Within bounded languages, two more parameters apply: left-to-right vs. right-to-left and quantity sensitive vs. insensitive.
#Left-to-right vs. right-to-left: In a left-to-right language metrical trees are constructed starting at the left edge of the word, while in a right-to-left language, they start at the right edge of the word.
#Quantity-sensitive vs. quantity-insensitive: In a quantity-sensitive language a W node cannot dominate a heavy syllable, while in a quantity-insensitive language tree construction is not influenced by the internal makeup of the syllables

Hayes (1995)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Metrical Stress Theory: Principles and Case Studies|last=Hayes|first=Bruce|publisher=The University of Chicago Press, Ltd.|year=1995|isbn=|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; describes metrical parameters that can analyse/predict word-level stress placement:
# Quantity-sensitive vs. quantity-insensitive: whether stress is sensitive to syllable weight
# Foot Type: Iambs or trochees.
# Parsing Directionality: whether the feet are built from the left edge of the word to the right or right to left
# Main Stress: does the stress fall on towards the right or left edge of the word
# Extrametricality: is there a unit consistently ignored for stress assignment, such as a final consonant, mora, syllable, or foot.

==Music==
Hierarchical patterns of prominence like those represented in metrical trees can also apply to [[rhythm]] in music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper

 | publisher = Psychological Review 79(6)
 | year = 1972
 | url =
 | pages = 487–509
 | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The prominence level of a note is determined by the relative prominence of all the nodes above it. The timing of notes also depends on the metrical tree for a particular tune. Each node at the bottom level of the tree (terminal nodes) receives a beat. Empty terminal nodes correspond to rests or form part of a note that spans several beats. Syncopation in music can result when relatively strong nodes are empty.

==Advantages==
Metrical phonology offers a number of advantages over a system representing stress as a feature that applies to individual segments or syllables, without reference to the other syllables in a phrase. Creators of traditional feature systems posited the stress feature, which differed from other phonological features in several key ways. For instance, the feature stress had an arbitrary number of values or levels, rather than two or some justified number more than two. In addition, the non-primary stress values in these systems were only defined relative to the primary stress value, and did not have local acoustic or articulatory effects. By not treating stress as a feature of an individual segment, metrical phonology avoids the inexplicable differences between the stress feature and other phonological features.&lt;ref name=Liberman-Prince/&gt;

Metrical phonology also correctly predicts the ambiguity between broad and narrow [[Focus (linguistics)|focus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper
 | first = D. Robert
 | last = Ladd
 | author = 
 | authorlink = 
 | title = Intonational Phonology
 | version =

 | year = 1996
 | url =
 | page = 
 | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are two possible metrical patterns for two-word phrases: S-W and W-S. However, there are three possible patterns of focus for such phrases: narrow focus on the first word, narrow focus on the second word, and broad focus. For instance, the phrase "Gus skied" can either be pronounced "GUS skied" (S-W) or "Gus SKIED" (W-S). These two realizations are the only options for answering the three questions: Who skied? (narrow focus on 'Gus'), What did Gus do? (narrow focus on 'skied'), and What happened yesterday? (broad focus).

Finally, metrical phonology is consistent with patterns of deaccenting in which accents can shift both left and right.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper

 | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is because swapping S and W nodes will cause stress to move left if the S node was originally on the right, and move right if it was originally on the left. Such bi-directional movement is more difficult to predict under a stress-shift rule, which would specify the direction of movement.

'''Mezzotint''' is a [[printmaking]] process of the [[intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio]] family, technically a [[drypoint]] method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/mezzotint|title=Definition of MEZZOTINT|author=|date=|website=www.merriam-webster.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first [[Grayscale|tonal method]] to be used, enabling half-tones to be produced without using line- or dot-based techniques like [[hatching]], cross-hatching or [[stipple]]. Mezzotint achieves tonality by roughening a metal plate with thousands of little dots made by a metal tool with small teeth, called a "rocker".  In printing, the tiny pits in the plate hold the ink when the face of the plate is wiped clean. A high level of quality and richness in the print can be achieved.

==History==
[[Image:Ludwig von Siegen - Portrait of Amelie Elisabeth von Hessen.jpg|thumb|The first known mezzotint, by [[Ludwig von Siegen]], 1642]]
The mezzotint printmaking method was invented by the German amateur artist [[Ludwig von Siegen]] (1609–{{circa|1680}}). His earliest mezzotint print dates to 1642 and is a portrait of [[Countess Amalie Elisabeth of Hanau-Münzenberg]].  This was made by working from light to dark. The rocker seems to have been invented by [[Prince Rupert of the Rhine]], a famous cavalry commander in the [[English Civil War]], who was the next to use the process, and took it to England.  Sir [[Peter Lely]] saw the potential for using it to publicise his portraits, and encouraged a number of Dutch printmakers to come to England.  [[Godfrey Kneller]] worked closely with [[John Smith (engraver)|John Smith]], who is said to have lived in his house for a period; he created about 500 mezzotints, some 300 copies of portrait paintings.  

The process was especially widely used in England from the eighteenth century, to reproduce portraits and other paintings.  Since the mid-nineteenth century it has been relatively little used. [[Robert Kipniss]] and [[Peter Ilsted]] are two notable 20th-century exponents of the technique; [[M. C. Escher]] also made eight mezzotints.

British mezzotint collecting was a great craze from about 1760 to the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929|Great Crash]] of 1929, also spreading to America.  The main area of collecting was British portraits; hit oil paintings from the [[Royal Academy Summer Exhibition]] were routinely, and profitably, reproduced in mezzotint throughout this period, and other mezzotinters reproduced older portraits of historical figures, or if necessary, made them up.  The favourite period to collect was roughly from 1750 to 1820, the great period of the British portrait.  There were two basic styles of collection: some concentrated on making a complete collection of material within a certain scope, while others aimed at perfect condition and quality (which declines in mezzotints after a relatively small number of impressions are taken from a plate), and in collecting the many "[[State (printmaking)|proof states]]" which artists and printers had obligingly provided for them from early on.  Leading collectors included [[William Eaton, 2nd Baron Cheylesmore]] and the Irishman [[John Chaloner Smith]].&lt;ref&gt;Griffiths, 134–137 and 141–142&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dark to light method==
This became the most common method.  The whole surface (usually) of a [[metal]], usually copper, plate is roughened evenly, manually with a rocker, or mechanically.  If the plate were printed at this point it would show as solid black. The image is then created by selectively burnishing areas of the surface of the metal plate with metal tools; the smoothed parts will print lighter than those areas not smoothed by the burnishing tool. A burnisher has a smooth, round end, which flattens the minutely protruding points comprising the roughened surface of the metal printing plate.  Areas smoothed completely flat will not hold ink at all; such areas will print "white," that is, without ink.  By varying the degree of smoothing, mid-tones between black and white can be created, hence the name ''mezzo-tinto'' which is [[Italian language|Italian]] for "[[half-tone]]" or "half-painted".  This is called working from "dark to light", or the "subtractive" method.

==Light to dark method==
[[Image:6409 bassenge2vaillerant.jpg|thumb|left|Early mezzotint by Vaillerant, Siegen's assistant or tutor. Young man reading, with statue of Cupid. Probably made using light to dark technique. 27.5 &amp;times; 21.3 cm]]
Alternatively, it is possible to create the image directly by only roughening a blank plate selectively, where the darker parts of the image are to be.  This is called working from "light to dark", or the "additive" method.  The first mezzotints by [[Ludwig von Siegen]] were made in this way. Especially in this method, the mezzotint can be combined with other intaglio techniques, such as engraving, on areas of the plate not roughened, or even with the dark to light method.

==Printing==
Printing the finished plate is the same for either method, and follows the normal way for an intaglio plate; the whole surface is inked, the ink is then wiped off the surface to leave ink only in the pits of the still rough areas below the original surface of the plate. The plate is put through a high-pressure printing press next to a sheet of paper, and the process repeated.

Because the pits in the plate are not deep, only a small number of top-quality impressions (copies) can be printed before the quality of the tone starts to degrade as the pressure of the press begins to smooth them out.  Perhaps only one or two hundred really good impressions can be taken.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

==Detailed technique==
Plates can be mechanically roughened; one way is to rub fine metal filings over the surface with a piece of glass; the finer the filings, the smaller the grain of the surface. Special roughening tools called 'rockers' have been in use since at least the eighteenth century. The method commonly in use today is to use a steel rocker approximately five inches wide, which has between 45 and 120 teeth per inch on the face of a blade in the shape of a shallow arc, with a wooden handle projecting upwards in a T-shape. Rocked steadily from side to side at the correct angle, the rocker will proceed forward creating burrs in the surface of the [[copper]]. The plate is then moved – either rotated by a set number of degrees or through 90 degrees according to preference – and then rocked in another pass. This is repeated until the plate is roughened evenly and will print a completely solid tone of black.

==Tone==
Mezzotint is known for the luxurious quality of its tones: first, because an evenly, finely roughened surface holds a lot of ink, allowing deep solid colors to be printed; secondly because the process of smoothing the plate with [[Burin (engraving)|burin]], ''burnisher'' and ''scraper'' allows fine gradations in tone to be developed. The scraper is a triangular ended tool, and the burnisher has a smooth round end – not unlike many spoon handles.

'''Micrographia''' is an acquired disorder that features abnormally small, cramped [[handwriting]] or the progression to progressively smaller handwriting.&lt;ref name="Larner2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=A.J. Larner|title=A Dictionary of Neurological Signs|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mY-6eweiQm8C&amp;pg=PA221|date=12 November 2010|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-4419-7095-4|pages=221}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is commonly associated with neurodegenerative disorders of the [[basal ganglia]], such as in [[Parkinson's disease]], but it has also been ascribed to subcortical focal lesions.&lt;ref name="book"&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Movement Disorders, Three-Volume Set|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9OMOfruKosgC&amp;pg=RA1-PA177|date=26 February 2010|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=978-0-12-374105-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; O'Sullivan and Schmitz describe it as an abnormally small handwriting that is difficult to read, as seen in the photo to the right.&lt;ref name="OSullivan1339"&gt;{{harvnb|O'Sullivan| pp=1339}}&lt;/ref&gt; Micrographia is also seen in patients with [[Wilson's disease]], [[Obsessive Compulsive Disorder]], [[Metamorphopsia]], or with isolated focal lesions of the [[midbrain]] or basal ganglia.&lt;ref name="Larner2010" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://jnnp.bmj.com/content/jnnp/70/5/605.full.pdf Kinematic analysis of handwriting movements in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder]&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Parkinson's disease==
A common feature of [[Parkinson's disease]] (PD) is difficulty in routine activities due to lack of motor control.&lt;ref name="OSullivan858"&gt;{{harvnb|O'Sullivan| pp=858}}&lt;/ref&gt; More specifically, patients have difficulty maintaining the scale of movements and have reduced amplitude of movement; also known as [[hypokinesia]].&lt;ref name="OSullivan857"&gt;{{harvnb|O'Sullivan| pp=857}}&lt;/ref&gt; These difficulties with scaling and controlling the amplitude of movement cause patients with PD to have difficulty with complex, sequential movements.&lt;ref name="OSullivan858"/&gt; This helps to explain why micrographia is a common symptom of the disease. Another reason is a lack of physical [[dexterity]].

[[James Parkinson]] may have been aware of micrographia in patients with shaking palsy (later renamed Parkinson's disease), when he described "the hand failing to answer with exactness to the dictates of the will".&lt;ref name="book"/&gt;

=== Occurrence in Parkinson's ===
Micrographia is seen in 9 to 75% of PD patients and often appears before other cognitive symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 4564706 | pmid=26361595 | doi=10.5535/arm.2015.39.4.586 | volume=39 | title=Handwriting Rehabilitation in Parkinson Disease: A Pilot Study | year=2015 | journal=Ann Rehabil Med | pages=586–91 |vauthors=Ziliotto A, Cersosimo MG, Micheli FE }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pharmacological management===
Micrographia may worsen when a PD patient is under-medicated or when the effects of the medication are wearing off.&lt;ref name="MDMD2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Paul Tuite |author2=Hubert Fernandez |author3=Cathi Thomas |author4=Laura Ruekert |title=Parkinson's Disease: A Guide to Patient Care|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YSdU__2VrXoC&amp;pg=PA28|date=23 March 2009|publisher=Springer Publishing Company|isbn=978-0-8261-2269-8|pages=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mir-Mohsun Navvab''' ([[Azerbaijani language|Azeri]]: ''Mir Möhsün Nəvvab'') (1833, in [[Shusha]] – 1918, in [[Shusha]]) occupies a prominent place in the history of [[Culture of Azerbaijan|Azerbaijani culture]] as the last representative of old traditional school of science, arts and literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MİR MÖHSÜN NƏVVAB VƏ ONUN ELMİ İRSİ|url=http://xezer.libmks.az/secme2/768-mr-mhsn-nvvab-v-onun-elm-rs.html|website=xezer.libmks.az|accessdate=29 June 2014|language=Azerbaijani|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140702002907/http://xezer.libmks.az/secme2/768-mr-mhsn-nvvab-v-onun-elm-rs.html|archivedate=2 July 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Navvab was versatile person of his time. He is known as a poet, artist, music historian, astronomer, carpenter, chemist and mathematician.

Navvab was born in 1833 in [[Shusha]] and spent all his life in this city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Qarabağ ədəbiyyatı: xronoqraf &gt; XIX əsr &gt; Mir Möhsün Nəvvab|url=http://azerbaycanli.org/az/page782.html|website=azerbaycanli.org|accessdate=29 June 2014|language=Azerbaijani}}&lt;/ref&gt; His life and works reflect a period of history, when [[Azerbaijan]] was on the turning point of old and new, traditional and novel trends in culture and general way of life. And although, Navvab remained a traditionalist in the arts, he was a progressive person in the public life of Karabakh, who did a lot for the growth of literacy, culture and arts in [[Nagorno-Karabakh|Karabakh]].

Navvab created first typography in Shusha, which was also the first typography in Azerbaijan. He published the poems of Karabakh poets and spread them among the local population. Navvab established a second literary society in Azerbaijan called “Majlis-i-Faramushan” (‘Society of the Forgotten') and also established the first music society “Majlis-i-Khanende” (‘Society of Singers').

Navvab wrote more than 20 books dedicated to various fields of science and arts. He is the author of “Vuzuh-ul-Argam” (‘Explanation of the numbers'), a significant work which offers 82 mugams (an original improvisational classical folk music popular in Azerbaijan) and songs, performed in Karabakh at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Miklashevskaya|first1=Nadejda|title=[[Soviet Encyclopedia]]|date=1954|pages=102–108|accessdate=29 June 2014|chapter=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also provides information about the origins of these mugams and the rules for their performance. Navvab is also the author of the book “Tezkirey-i-Navvab”, which gives information about one hundred poets and writers of Karabakh at the time.

Navvab was also a talented artist. He illustrated his manuscripts with colorful pictures and portraits, and also decorated the interiors of the buildings with various ornaments. Before Shusha's occupation by the Armenian forces in 1992 some of these wall decorations were preserved in the house where he lived, school where he taught and the Minarets of the Shusha's main Upper Govharaga Mosque.

Navvab died in 1918 in Shusha.

He returned to Satara in 1911 and worked with Dattātraya Baḷavanta Pārasanīs (co-writer with Charles Augustus Kincaid), who wrote "a history of the maratha people". The main work was to convert Modi daftar to [[Marathi language|Marathi]]/English language.

===[[Savkari Pash]]===

===Duniya Na Mane(Hindi) / Kunku (Marathi)===
Duniya Na Mane is a 1937 Hindi social classic based on the Marathi novel, ''Na Patnari Goshta'' (न पटणारी गोष्ट) by Apte, who also wrote the film's screenplay. This film was released on Dussehara in 1937 &lt;http://epaper.dnaindia.com/story.aspx?edorsup=Sup&amp;wintype=popup&amp;queryed=820043&amp;querypage=1&amp;boxid=27115212&amp;id=29895&amp;eddate=2012-10-21&amp;ed_date=2012-10-21&amp;ed_code=820043&gt; and was shown at the Venice International Film Festival in 1937.

The movie was remade in Marathi as Kunku.

Kunku is the story of a young woman who refuses to accept her marriage with an older man. However, this presents its own problems for the young woman who is now widowed and subject to widowhood, a severe punishment in orthodox Hindu society. The film ends with the husband killing himself to set his wife free of him. Shantaram tells his story as realistically as possible, with background music limited to natural sounds. It was shown at the Venice International Film FestivalThe storyline revolves around a young woman, Nirmala, rebelling against her arranged marriage to a much older widower, Kakasaheb, according to a social practice fairly prevalent in India until the second quarter of the 20th century.

After a long discussion with his widowed daughter Sushila, who is roughly Nirmala's age, Kakasaheb agrees to the only way out—suicide—since divorces were not possible in those times. Sushila also provides a forceful feminist speech to the young bride. Just before committing suicide, Kakasaheb implores his would-be wife to find a younger husband.

An interesting aspect of Duniya Na Mane is its characterisation: The widower is not a villain. He has acted without questioning the prevalent custom of his society and is now faced with the tragic consequences of that act.

===Bhagyarekha (Marathi)===
Bhagyarekha is the story of Manik, a young Gandhian freedom fighter who has a child out of wedlock. Condemned by all the members of her family expect her mother, she battles on steadfastly, even after her lover dies in a police encounter leaving her to fend for herself. The film, directed by Shantaram Athavale, also stars Baburao Pendharkar, and harks back to an era when Marathi cinema tackled unconventional subjects. [[Keshavrao Bhole]] composed its music and Narayan Hari Apte wrote the songs, screenplay and dialogues.he wrote it on 1785

===Rajput Ramani (Marathi)===
Rajput Ramani is an adventure movie. The movie shows a medieval Rajput court. The legendary warrior Mansingh (Phatak) is the nation's strong man but he is cordially hated even by his own people. Claiming to have been offended by Taramati (Tarkhad), he insists to her eminent father only a marriage (on terms insulting to her) can placate him. He becomes a dictator imprisoning large numbers of people, and eventually Taramati's father, also in prison, leads a popular revolt, threatening to kill his son-in-law.

Her father has little choice but to comply silently without protest. Mansingh soon evolves into an iron-fisted autocrat—He becomes a tyrant imprisoning large number of the population, including Taramati's father. The old man eventually leads a rebellion that almost kills the muscle-bound tyrant, but Taramati intercedes on behalf of her husband at the last moment.

===Umaj Padel Tar (Marathi)===
On the eve of a big US-Japan trade summit, a reporter gets a hot tip that the Japanese-American head of a big aerospace firm will be selling trade secrets to a Japanese contact. Intent on getting a scoop, the reporter hires private investigator John Blaylock to help her find out just what information is being handed over. In the course of snooping, the pair are discovered, but not before they learn that the Japanese contact is a member of the Yakuza. When the aerospace executive turns up dead after an apparent suicide, the investigators realise that some very big secrets are being kept by some very important people.

===Amrit Manthan===
[[Amrit Manthan (film)|Amrit Manthan]], which was produced and directed by V. Shantaram. Shantaram used this film to comment subtly on life and times in contemporary society too. He was the first director to use a telephoto lens for his film Amrit Manthan (1934). It uses several film techniques from German Expressionist cinema. Apart from all its notable achievements, this film is best remembered for its shot of the close-up of a priest's right eye. This film is also important for introducing several talented artistes such as Durga Khote and [[Shanta Apte]] to a film-hungry audience.

It tells the story of a very old society where Buddhism goes against orthodox ritualistic practices.  This film was set in the Buddhist age and makes a strong statement against the practice of making human sacrifices. Avanti Nagar residents worship Devi Maa Chandika and sacrifice humans and animals to appease her. When Raja Krantivarma bans this sacrifice, his very own Rajguru rebels and incites a group of religious zealots to assassinate him

'''Palauan''' (''a tekoi er a Belau'') is one of the two [[official languages]] of the [[Palau|Republic of Palau]], the other being [[English language|English]]. It is part of the [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian family of languages]]. The Palauan language is widely used in day-to-day life in Palau.

==Classification==
It is a member of the [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian family of languages]], and is one of only two indigenous languages in [[Micronesia]] that is not part of the [[Oceanic languages|Oceanic]] branch of that family, the other being [[Chamorro language|Chamorro]] (see {{Harvnb|Dempwolff|1934}}, {{Harvnb|Blust|1977}}, {{Harvnb|Jackson|1986}}, and {{Harvnb|Zobel|2002}}).

[[Roger Blench]] (2015)&lt;ref&gt;Blench, Roger. 2015. [https://www.academia.edu/10239971/Early_Oceanic_contact_with_Palau_the_evidence_of_fish_names Early Oceanic contact with Palau: the evidence of fish names].&lt;/ref&gt; notes that based on evidence from fish names, Palauan had early contact with [[Oceanic languages]] either directly or indirectly via the [[Yapese language]]. These include fish names for the [[sea eel]], [[yellowfin tuna]] (''[[Thunnus albacares]]''), [[left-eye flounder]] (''[[Bothus mancus]]''), [[triggerfish]], [[sailfish]], [[barracuda]] (''[[Sphyraena barracuda]]''), [[damsel fish]] (''[[Abudefduf]]'' sp.), [[squirrelfish]] (''[[Holocentrus]]'' spp.), [[Naso (genus)|unicorn fish]] (''[[Naso (genus)|Naso]]'' spp.), [[trevally]], [[land crab]] (''[[Discoplax rotunda|Cardisoma rotundus]]''), and [[wrasse]]. This suggests that Oceanic speakers had influenced the fishing culture of Palau, and had been fishing and trading in the vicinity of Palau for quite some time. Blench (2015) notes that the Palauan language also displays influence from [[Central Philippine languages]] and [[Sama-Bajaw languages|Samalic languages]].

==Phonology==
The [[phoneme|phonemic]] inventory of Palauan consists of 10 consonants and 6 vowels.&lt;ref&gt;Only 5 vowel phonemes are listed in {{Harvnb|Wilson|1972}} because she avoids the issue of how to treat indeterminate underlying vowels.  The vowel chart here tentatively reflects the analysis of {{Harvcoltxt|Flora|1974}}, who treats indeterminate vowels as instances of underlying {{IPAlink|ə}}.  Furthermore, the analysis of Palauan {{IPAblink|w}} in {{Harvnb|Flora|1974}} treats it as a phoneme distinct from {{IPAslink|u}}, while {{IPAblink|w}} is merely an allophone of {{IPAslink|u}} according to {{Harvcoltxt|Wilson|1972}}.  The consonant chart tentatively reflects Wilson's analysis.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[phonetics|Phonetic]] charts of the vowel and consonant phonemes are provided below, utilizing the [[help:IPA|International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)]].

While the phonemic inventory of Palauan is relatively small, comparatively, many phonemes contain at least two [[allophone]]s that surface as the result of various [[phonology|phonological processes]] within the language.  The full phonetic inventory of consonants is given below in [[help:IPA|IPA]] (the phonemic inventory of vowels, above, is complete).

===Diphthongs===
Palauan contains several [[diphthongs]] (sequences of [[vowel]]s within a single [[syllable]]).  A list of diphthongs and corresponding Palauan words containing them are given below, adapted from {{Harvcoltxt|Zuraw|2003}}.

The extent to which it is accurate to characterize each of these vowel sequences as diphthongs has been a matter of debate, as in {{Harvnb|Wilson|1972}}, {{Harvnb|Flora|1974}}, {{Harvnb|Josephs|1975}}, and {{Harvnb|Zuraw|2003}}.  Nevertheless, a number of the sequences above, such as {{IPA|/ui/}}, clearly behave as diphthongs given their interaction with other aspects of Palauan phonology like stress shift and vowel reduction.  Others do not behave as clearly like monosyllabic diphthongs.

==Writing system==
In the early 1970s, the Palau Orthography Committee worked with linguists from the [[University of Hawaii]] to devise an [[alphabet]] based on the [[Latin script]].&lt;ref&gt;The final report of the Palau Orthography Committee was released as {{Harvcolnb|Yaoch|Morei|Polloi|Sisior|1972}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The resulting orthography was largely based on the "one phoneme/one symbol" notion, producing an alphabet of twelve native consonants, six consonants for use in loan words, and ten vowels.  The 20 vowel sequences listed under [[#Diphthongs|Diphthongs]] are also all officially recognized in the orthography.

Most of the letters/graphemes in written Palauan correspond to phonemes that can be represented by the corresponding segments in the International Phonetic Alphabet {{Harvcol|Nuger|2016|pp=308}}, e.g., Palauan ''b'' is the phoneme {{IPAslink|b}}.  Three notable exceptions are worth mentioning.  The first is ''ch'', which is invariably pronounced as a glottal stop {{IPAblink|ʔ}}.  The ''ch'' [[Digraph (orthography)|digraph]] is a remnant of an earlier writing system developed during German occupation when the glottal stop was pronounced as a fricative {{IPAblink|x}}.  Some older Palauans still remember their grandparents pronouncing ''ch'' this way.  In modern Palauan usage the sound {{IPAblink|x}} has been completely replaced by {{IPAblink|ʔ}}, but the ''ch'' spelling persists.  The second is ''e'', which represents either the full vowel {{IPAblink|ɛ}} in primary and secondary stressed syllables, or a schwa {{IPAblink|ə}} in unstressed syllables; the conditions are similar to those of [[Stress and vowel reduction in English|English vowel reduction]] (and note that stress in Palauan is largely penultimate, with many semi-regular exceptions).  The third is the [[Digraph (orthography)|digraph]] ''ng'', which is a (phonemic) velar nasal {{IPAslink|ŋ}} but can assimilate to be pronounced as {{IPAblink|m}} or {{IPAblink|n}}. There is no phonemic {{IPAslink|n}} in Palauan.

On May 10, 2007, the [https://web.archive.org/web/20071231075550/http://www.palauoek.net/senate/welcome.asp Palauan Senate] passed [https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20080410090502/http://www.palauoek.net/senate/legislation/sb/sb_7-79.pdf Bill No. 7-79], which mandates that educational institutions recognize the Palauan orthography laid out in {{Harvnb|Josephs|1997}} and {{Harvnb|Josephs|1999}}.  The bill also establishes an Orthography Commission to maintain the language as it develops as well as to oversee and regulate any additions or modifications to the current official orthography.

==Morphology==

===Noun Inflection===
Palauan nouns inflect based on humanness and number via the plural prefix ''re-'', which attaches to plural human nouns (see {{Harvcolnb|Josephs|1975|pp=43}}).  For example, the word ''chad'' "person" is a human noun that is unambiguously singular, whereas the noun ''rechad'' people is a human noun that is unambiguously plural.  Non-human nouns do not display this distinction, e.g., the word for stone, ''bad'', can denote either a singular "stone" or multiple "stones."&lt;ref&gt;Note that some non-human animate plural nouns (animals) can stylistically inflect with the plural prefix ''re-'' if they are considered to be "sufficiently human" in some contexts, such as when talking about household pets that are like family members, or when anthropomorphized animal characters are described in stories.  See {{Harvcolnb|Nuger|2016|pp=172, fn. 9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some possessed nouns in Palauan also inflect to agree with the person, number, and humanness of their possessors.  For example, the unpossessed noun ''tebel'' means simply "table," whereas one of its possessed forms ''tebelek'' means "my table."  Possessor agreement is always registered via the addition of a suffix to the noun (also triggering a shift in stress to the suffix).  The possessor agreement suffixes have many different irregular forms that only attach to particular nouns, and they must be memorized on a noun-by-noun basis {{Harvcol|Josephs|1997|pp=96}}.  However, there is a "default" set (see {{Harvcolnb|Josephs|1997|pp=93}} and {{Harvcolnb|Nuger|2016|pp=28}}), shown below:

==Syntax==

===Word order===
The [[word order]] of Palauan is usually thought to be [[verb–object–subject|verb–object–subject (VOS)]], but this has been a matter of some debate in the linguistic literature.&lt;ref&gt;See {{Harvnb|Waters|1980}}, {{Harvnb|Georgopoulos|1986}}, and {{Harvnb|Georgopoulos|1991}} for arguments in favor of treating Palauan as VOS.  cf. {{Harvnb|Wilson|1972}} and {{Harvnb|Josephs|1975}}, which assume an [[subject–verb–object|SVO]] order for Palauan.  {{Harvcoltxt|Georgopoulos|1991|pp=32–41}} and {{Harvcoltxt|Josephs|1999|pp=Chap. 15}} provide clear and concise summaries of the debate and evidence in favor of the VOS analysis over the SVO analysis.&lt;/ref&gt;  Those who accept the VOS analysis of Palauan word order generally treat Palauan as a [[pro-drop language]] with preverbal [[subject (grammar)|subject]] [[agreement (linguistics)|agreement]] [[morpheme]]s, final pronominal subjects are deleted (or [[null morpheme|null]]).

Example 1: Ak milenga er a ringngo ''pro''.  (means: "I ate the apple.")

In the preceding example, the null pronoun ''pro'' is the subject "I," while the clause-initial ''ak'' is the first person singular subject agreement morpheme.

On the other hand, those who have analyzed Palauan as SVO necessarily reject the pro-drop analysis, instead analyzing the subject agreement morphemes as subject pronouns.  In the preceding example, SVO-advocates assume that there is no ''pro'' and that the morpheme ''ak'' is simply an overt subject pronoun meaning "I."  One potential problem with this analysis is that it fails to explain why overt (3rd person) subjects occur clause-finally in the presence of a co-referring 3rd person "subject pronoun" --- treating the subject pronouns as agreement morphemes circumvents this weakness.  Consider the following example.

Example 2: Ng milenga er a ringngo an Olilai.  (means: "Olilai ate the apple.")

Proponents of the SVO analysis must assume a shifting of the subject ''a Alan'' "Alan" from clause-initial to clause-final position, a movement operation that has not received acceptance cross-linguistically, but see {{Harvnb|Josephs|1975}} for discussion.

==Palauan numerals==

# tang
# erung

# tacher

Palauans have different numbers for different objects. For example, to count people it is: tang, terung, tedei, teuang, teim, telolem, teuid, teai, tetiu, and teruich.  Traditionally, there were separate counting sets for people, things, counting, ordinals, bunches of bananas, units of time, long objects, and rafts; however, several of these are no longer used.&lt;ref&gt;Palauan Language Online [http://tekinged.com/grammar/numbers.php tekinged.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1892">'''Positional advantage''' is a combative position relative to an opponent. It is used extensively to describe a situation of significant tactical advantage over an opponent in open-hand conflict (i.e. without weapons) in [[William Cheung]]'s [[Traditional Wing Chun Kung Fu]] and [[Ian Protheroe]]'s [[Classical Wing Chun]].&lt;ref name="Positional Advantage"&gt;[http://www.wingchun-kungfu.org/positioning_n.htm Positional Advantage&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927003236/http://www.wingchun-kungfu.org/positioning_n.htm |date=2007-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In physical altercations, positional advantage is significant because a defender who has attained positional advantage:
*is not as open to an attack from the attacker's rear hand
*may control the attacker's lead limbs (one arm and one leg)
*is in range to attack or defend both hands
*is able to redirect their opponent's force

In the words of [[Sifu]] Ian Protheroe, "as long as your strongest side is facing your opponent's weakest side, you have the advantage".&lt;ref&gt;Ian Protheroe ''Wing Chun Theory and Composition'', 1998, p.47 {{isbn|978-0646356389}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although positional advantage has been adopted specifically by Classical and Traditional Wing Chun practitioners, the term is applicable to all martial styles, both with and without weapons.&lt;ref name="Positional Advantage"/&gt; Related concepts include centre and central line theory.&lt;ref name="Positional Advantage"/&gt; These terms are used to describe many different things by Wing Chun practitioners (see the Wikipedia entry for [[Wing Chun]] for more information).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2725">In [[philately]], '''primitives''', also called '''natives''', are postage stamps that were crudely designed and printed as compared with the sophisticated productions of industrialized countries such as the [[Postage stamps and postal history of the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]] or the [[Postage stamps and postal history of the United States|United States]]{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}.  A number of such stamps were produced in the [[classic stamp]] period in remote or undeveloped locales such as [[Mauritius]]. &lt;ref&gt; L. N. Williams, ''Fundamentals of Philately'', American Philatelic Society, State College, Pennsylvania (rev. ed. 1990), p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt;  Due to their charm and sometimes rarity, primitives are among the most popular stamps with [[Stamp collecting|stamp collectors]].

Several well known primitives copied the designs of standard postage stamps of major countries.  For example, the early stamps of [[Postage stamps and postal history of Mauritius|Mauritius]] were crude, locally produced copies of the then current postage stamps of the United Kingdom.  Similarly, the stamps of [[Postage stamps and postal history of Argentina#Corrientes|Corrientes]], a province in northern Argentina, were inept imitations of earlier stamps of France, depicting the agricultural goddess [[Ceres (Roman mythology)|Ceres]].   Other primitives are of their own unique design.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30003">In [[recursion theory|computability theory]], '''primitive recursive functions''' are a class of [[function (mathematics)|functions]] that are defined using [[function composition|composition]] and '''primitive recursion''' – described below – as central operations. They are a strict [[subset]] of those [[µ-recursive function]]s (also called [[computable function|partial recursive functions]]) which are also [[total function]]s. Primitive recursive functions form an important building block on the way to a full formalization of computability.  These functions are also important in [[proof theory]].

Most of the functions normally studied in [[number theory]] are primitive recursive. For example, [[addition]] and [[division (mathematics)|division]], the [[factorial]] and [[exponential function|exponential]] function, and the function which returns the ''n''th prime are all primitive recursive. So are many approximations to real-valued functions.&lt;ref&gt;Brainerd and Landweber, 1974&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, it is difficult to devise a [[computable function|total recursive function]] that is ''not'' primitive recursive, although some are known (see the section on [[Primitive recursive function#Limitations|Limitations]] below).
The set of primitive recursive functions is known as [[PR (complexity)|PR]] in [[computational complexity theory]].

== Definition ==
The primitive recursive functions are among the number-theoretic functions, which are functions from the [[natural number]]s (nonnegative integers) {0, 1, 2, ...} to the natural numbers. These functions take ''n'' arguments for some natural number ''n'' and are called ''n''-[[arity|ary]].

The basic primitive recursive functions are given by these [[axiom]]s:

{{ordered list|start=1
| 1='''Constant function''': The 0-ary [[constant term|constant function]] 0 is primitive recursive.
| 2='''Successor function''': The 1-ary successor function ''S'', which returns the successor of its argument (see [[Peano postulates]]), is primitive recursive. That is, ''S''(''k'') = ''k'' + 1.
| 3='''Projection function''': For every ''n''≥1 and each ''i'' with 1≤''i''≤''n'', the ''n''-ary projection function ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, which returns its ''i''-th argument, is primitive recursive.
}}
More complex primitive recursive functions can be obtained by applying the [[operation (mathematics)|operation]]s given by these axioms:
{{ordered list|start=4
| 4='''Composition''': Given a ''k''-ary primitive recursive function ''f'', and ''k'' many ''m''-ary primitive recursive functions ''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''g''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;, the [[Function composition|composition]] of ''f'' with ''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''g''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;, i.e. the ''m''-ary function &lt;math&gt;h(x_1,\ldots,x_m) = f(g_1(x_1,\ldots,x_m),\ldots,g_k(x_1,\ldots,x_m)) \,&lt;/math&gt; is primitive recursive.
}}
Example. We take ''f''(''x'') as the ''S''(''x'') defined above. This f is a 1-ary primitive recursive function. And so is ''g''(''x'') = ''S''(''x''). So ''h''(''x'') defined as ''f''(''g''(''x'')) = ''S''(''S''(''x'')) is a primitive recursive 1-ary function too. Informally speaking, ''h''(''x'') is the function that turns ''x'' into ''x''+2.
{{ordered list|start=5
| 5='''Primitive recursion''': Given ''f'', a ''k''-ary primitive recursive function, and ''g'', a (''k''+2)-ary primitive recursive function, the (''k''+1)-ary function ''h'' is defined as the primitive recursion of ''f'' and ''g'', i.e. the function ''h'' is primitive recursive when
:&lt;math&gt;h (0, x_1, \ldots, x_k) = f (x_1, \ldots, x_k) \,&lt;/math&gt; and
:&lt;math&gt;h (S(y), x_1, \ldots, x_k) = g (y, h (y, x_1, \ldots, x_k), x_1, \ldots, x_k) \,.&lt;/math&gt;
}}
Example. Suppose ''f''(''x'') = ''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'') = ''x'' and ''g''(''x'',''y'',''z'')= ''S''(''P''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'',''y'',''z'')) = ''S''(''y''). Then ''h''(0,''x'') = ''x'' and ''h''(''S''(''y''),''x'') = ''g''(''y'',''h''(''y'',''x''),''x'') = ''S''(''h''(''y'',''x'')). Now ''h''(0,1) = 1, ''h''(1,1) = ''S''(''h''(0,1)) = 2, ''h''(2,1) = ''S''(''h''(1,1)) = 3. This ''h'' is a 2-ary primitive recursive function. We can call it 'addition'.

The '''primitive recursive''' functions are the basic functions and those obtained from the basic functions by applying these operations a finite number of times.

=== Role of the projection functions ===
The projection functions can be used to avoid the apparent rigidity in terms of the [[arity]] of the functions above; by using compositions with various projection functions, it is possible to pass a subset of the arguments of one function to another function.  For example, if ''g'' and ''h'' are 2-ary primitive recursive functions then
:&lt;math&gt;f(a,b,c) = g(h(c,a),h(a,b)) \!&lt;/math&gt;
is also primitive recursive.  One formal definition using projection functions is
:&lt;math&gt;f(a,b,c) = g(h(P^3_3(a,b,c),P^3_1(a,b,c)),h(P^3_1(a,b,c),P^3_2(a,b,c))).&lt;/math&gt;

=== Converting predicates to numeric functions ===

In some settings it is natural to consider primitive recursive functions that take as inputs tuples that mix numbers with [[truth value]]s (that is ''t'' for true and ''f'' for false), or that produce truth values as outputs.&lt;ref&gt;Kleene [1952 pp.&amp;nbsp;226–227]&lt;/ref&gt; This can be accomplished by identifying the truth values with numbers in any fixed manner.  For example, it is common to identify the truth value ''t'' with the number 1 and the truth value ''f'' with the number 0.  Once this identification has been made, the [[indicator function|characteristic function]] of a set ''A'', which always returns 1 or 0, can be viewed as a predicate that tells whether a number is in the set ''A''.  Such an identification of predicates with numeric functions will be assumed for the remainder of this article.

=== Computer language definition ===

An example of a primitive recursive programming language is one that contains basic arithmetic operators (e.g. + and −, or ADD and SUBTRACT), conditionals and comparison (IF-THEN, EQUALS, LESS-THAN), and bounded loops, such as the basic [[for loop]], where there is a known or calculable upper bound to all loops (FOR i FROM 1 to n, with neither i nor n modifiable by the loop body). No control structures of greater generality, such as [[while loop]]s or IF-THEN plus [[GOTO]], are admitted in a primitive recursive language. [[Douglas Hofstadter]]'s [[BlooP and FlooP|BlooP]] in ''[[Gödel, Escher, Bach]]'' is one such.  Adding unbounded loops (WHILE, GOTO) makes the language partially recursive, or [[Turing completeness|Turing-complete]]; Floop is such, as are almost all real-world computer languages.

Arbitrary computer programs, or [[Turing machine]]s, cannot in general be analyzed to see if they halt or not (the [[halting problem]]).  However, all primitive recursive functions halt. This is not a contradiction; primitive recursive programs are a non-arbitrary subset of all possible programs, constructed specifically to be analyzable.

Most number-theoretic functions definable using [[recursion (computer science)|recursion]] on a single variable are primitive recursive.  Basic examples include the addition and [[truncated subtraction]] functions.

=== Addition ===
Intuitively, addition can be recursively defined with the rules:

:&lt;math&gt;add(0,x)=x&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;add(n+1,x)=add(n,x)+1&lt;/math&gt;

To fit this into a strict primitive recursive definition, define:

:&lt;math&gt;add(0,x)=P_1^1(x),&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;add(S(n),x)=S(P_2^3(n, add(n,x), x))&lt;/math&gt;

Here S(''n'') is "the successor of ''n''" (i.e., ''n''+1), ''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; is the [[identity function]], and ''P''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; is the [[projection function]] that takes 3 arguments and returns the second one. Functions ''f'' and ''g'' required by the above definition of the primitive recursion operation are respectively played by ''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; and the composition of ''S'' and ''P''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.

=== Subtraction ===
{{See also|Monus}}
Because primitive recursive functions use natural numbers rather than integers, and the natural numbers are not closed under subtraction, a truncated subtraction function (also called "proper subtraction") is studied in this context. This limited subtraction function sub(''a'', ''b'') [or ''b'' ∸ ''a''] returns ''b'' - ''a'' if this is nonnegative and returns ''0'' otherwise.

The '''predecessor function''' acts as the opposite of the successor function and is recursively defined by the rules:

:pred(0) = 0,
:pred(''n'' + 1) = ''n''.

These rules can be converted into a more formal definition by primitive recursion:

:pred(0) = 0,
:pred(S(''n'')) = ''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(''n'', pred(''n'')).

The limited subtraction function is definable from the predecessor function in a manner analogous to the way addition is defined from successor:

:sub(0, ''x'') = ''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;(''x''), 
:sub(S(''n''), ''x'') = pred(''P''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;(''n'', sub(''n'', ''x''), ''x'')).

Here sub(''a'',  ''b'') corresponds to ''b'' ∸ ''a''; for the sake of simplicity, the order of the arguments has been switched from the "standard" definition to fit the requirements of primitive recursion. This could easily be rectified using composition with suitable projections.

=== Other operations on natural numbers ===

[[Exponentiation]] and [[primality test]]ing are primitive recursive. Given primitive recursive functions ''e'', ''f'', ''g'', and ''h'', a function that returns the value of ''g'' when ''e''≤''f'' and the value of ''h'' otherwise is primitive recursive.

=== Operations on integers and rational numbers ===

By using [[Gödel numbering]]s, the primitive recursive functions can be extended to operate on other objects such as integers and [[rational number]]s.  If integers are encoded by Gödel numbers in a standard way, the arithmetic operations including addition, subtraction, and multiplication are all primitive recursive.  Similarly, if the rationals are represented by Gödel numbers then the [[Field (mathematics)|field]] operations are all primitive recursive.

== Use in first-order Peano arithmetic ==
In [[first-order logic|first-order]] [[Peano arithmetic]], there are infinitely many variables (0-ary symbols) but no [[arity|k-ary]] non-logical symbols with k&gt;0 other than S, +, *, and ≤. Thus in order to define primitive recursive functions one has to use the following trick by Gödel.

By using a [[Gödel numbering for sequences]], for example [[Gödel's β function]], any sequence of numbers can be encoded by a single number. Such a number can therefore represent the primitive recursive function until a given n.

Let ''h'' be a 1-ary primitive recursion function defined by:
:&lt;math&gt; h(0) = C&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; h(n+1) = g(n,h(n))&lt;/math&gt;
where C is a constant and ''g'' is an already defined function.

Using Gödel's β function, for any sequence of natural numbers (k&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, k&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, …, k&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;), there are natural numbers b and c such that, for every i ≤ n, β(b, c, i) = k&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;. We may thus use the following formula to define ''h''; more precisely, ''m''=''h''(''n'') is a shorthand for the following:

:&lt;math&gt;\exists b: \exists c: \beta(b, c, 0) = C \land \forall i: (i&lt;n) \rightarrow (\beta(b, c, i+1) = g(i,\beta(b, c, i))) \land (m = \beta(b, c, n))&lt;/math&gt;
and the equating to ''g'', being already defined, is in fact shorthand for some other already defined formula (as is β, whose formula is given [[Gödel's β function|here]]).

The generalization to any k-ary primitive recursion function is trivial.

== Relationship to recursive functions ==

The broader class of [[partial recursive function]]s is defined by introducing an [[mu operator|unbounded search operator]].  The use of this operator may result in a [[partial function]], that is, a relation with ''at most'' one value for each argument, but does not necessarily have ''any'' value for any argument (see [[Domain of a function|domain]]).  An equivalent definition states that a partial recursive function is one that can be computed by a [[Turing machine]].  A total recursive function is a partial recursive function that is defined for every input.

Every primitive recursive function is total recursive, but not all total recursive functions are primitive recursive. The [[Ackermann function]] ''A''(''m'',''n'') is a well-known example of a total recursive function (in fact, provable total), that is not primitive recursive. There is a characterization of the primitive recursive functions as a subset of the total recursive functions using the Ackermann function.  This characterization states that a function is primitive recursive [[if and only if]] there is a natural number ''m'' such that the function can be computed by a Turing [[machine that always halts]] within A(''m'',''n'') or fewer steps, where ''n'' is the sum of the arguments of the primitive recursive function.&lt;ref&gt;This follows from the facts that the functions of this form are the most quickly growing primitive recursive functions, and that a function is primitive recursive if and only if its time complexity is bounded by a primitive recursive function. For the former, see {{citation|title=An Introduction to Formal Languages and Automata|first=Peter|last=Linz|publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Publishers|year=2011|isbn=9781449615529|page=332|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hsxDiWvVdBcC&amp;pg=PA332}}. For the latter, see {{citation|title=The Nature of Computation|first1=Cristopher|last1=Moore|author1-link=Cristopher Moore|first2=Stephan|last2=Mertens|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2011|isbn=9780191620805|page=287|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jnGKbpMV8xoC&amp;pg=PA287}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An important property of the primitive recursive functions is that they are a [[recursively enumerable]] subset of the set of all [[total recursive function]]s (which is not itself recursively enumerable). This means that there is a single computable function ''f''(''m'',''n'') that enumerates the primitive recursive functions, namely:
* For every primitive recursive function ''g'', there is an ''m'' such that ''g''(''n'') = ''f''(''m'',''n'') for all ''n'', and
* For every ''m'', the function ''h''(''n'') = ''f''(''m'',''n'') is primitive recursive.
''f'' can be explicitly constructed by iteratively repeating all possible ways of creating primitive recursive functions. Thus, it is provably total. One can use a [[diagonal lemma|diagonalization]] argument to show that ''f'' is not recursive primitive in itself: had it been such, so would be ''h''(''n'') = ''f''(''n'',''n'')+1. But if this equals some primitive recursive function, there is an ''m'' such that ''h''(''n'') = ''f''(''m'',''n'') for all ''n'', and then ''h''(''m'') = ''f''(''m'',''m''), leading to contradiction.

However, the set of primitive recursive functions is not the ''largest'' recursively enumerable subset of the set of all total recursive functions. For example, the set of provably total functions (in Peano arithmetic) is also recursively enumerable, as one can enumerate all the proofs of the theory. While all primitive recursive functions are provably total, the converse is not true.

== Limitations ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Primitive recursive function]] --&gt;

Primitive recursive functions tend to correspond very closely with our intuition of what a computable function must be. Certainly the initial functions are intuitively computable (in their very simplicity), and the two operations by which one can create new primitive recursive functions are also very straightforward. However, the set of primitive recursive functions does not include every possible total computable function—this can be seen with a variant of [[Cantor's diagonal argument]]. This argument provides a total computable function that is not primitive recursive. A sketch of the proof is as follows:

:The primitive recursive functions of one argument (i.e., unary functions) can be [[Recursively enumerable set|computably enumerated]]. This enumeration uses the definitions of the primitive recursive functions (which are essentially just expressions with the composition and primitive recursion operations as operators and the basic primitive recursive functions as atoms), and can be assumed to contain every definition once, even though a same ''function'' will occur many times on the list (since many definitions define the same function; indeed simply composing by the [[identity function]] generates infinitely many definitions of any one primitive recursive function). This means that the {{mvar|''n''}}-th definition of a primitive recursive function in this enumeration can be effectively determined from {{mvar|''n''}}. Indeed if one uses some [[Gödel numbering]] to encode definitions as numbers, then this {{mvar|''n''}}-th definition in the list is computed by a primitive recursive function of {{mvar|''n''}}. Let {{math|''f''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} denote the unary primitive recursive function given by this definition.

:Now define the "evaluator function" {{mvar|''ev''}} with two arguments, by {{math|''ev''(''i'',''j'') {{=}} ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;(''j'')}}. Clearly {{math|''ev''}} is total and computable, since one can effectively determine the definition of {{math|''f''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, and being a primitive recursive function {{math|''f''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is itself total and computable, so {{math|''f''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;(''j'')}} is always defined and effectively computable. However a diagonal argument will show that the function {{mvar|''ev''}} of two arguments is not primitive recursive.

:Suppose {{mvar|''ev''}} were primitive recursive, then the unary function {{mvar|''g''}} defined by {{math|''g''(''i'') {{=}} S(''ev''(''i'',''i''))}} would also be primitive recursive, as it is defined by composition from the successor function and {{mvar|''ev''}}. But then {{mvar|''g''}} occurs in the enumeration, so there is some number {{mvar|''n''}} such that {{math|''g'' {{=}} ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}}. But now {{math|''g''(''n'') {{=}} S(''ev''(''n'',''n'')) {{=}} S(''f''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''n'')) {{=}} S(''g''(''n''))}} gives a contradiction.

This argument can be applied to any class of computable (total) functions that can be enumerated in this way, as explained in the article [[Machines that always halt]]. Note however that the ''partial'' computable functions (those that need not be defined for all arguments) can be explicitly enumerated, for instance by enumerating Turing machine encodings.

Other examples of total recursive but not primitive recursive functions are known:
*The function that takes ''m'' to [[Ackermann function|Ackermann]](''m'',''m'') is a unary total recursive function that is not primitive recursive.
*The [[Paris–Harrington theorem]] involves a total recursive function that is not primitive recursive.  Because this function is motivated by [[Ramsey theory]], it is sometimes considered more "natural" than the Ackermann function.
*The [[Sudan function]]
*The [[Goodstein function]]

== Some common primitive recursive functions ==

:The following examples and definitions are from Kleene (1952) pp.&amp;nbsp;223–231 — many appear with proofs. Most also appear with similar names, either as proofs or as examples, in Boolos-Burgess-Jeffrey 2002 pp.&amp;nbsp;63–70; they add #22 the logarithm lo(x, y) or lg(x, y) depending on the exact derivation.

In the following we observe that primitive recursive functions can be of four types:
# ''functions'' for short: "number-theoretic functions" from { 0, 1, 2, ...} to { 0, 1, 2, ...},
# ''predicates'': from { 0, 1, 2, ...} to truth values { t =true, f =false },
# ''propositional connectives'': from truth values { t, f } to truth values { t, f },
# ''representing functions'': from truth values { t, f } to { 0, 1, 2, ... }. Many times a predicate requires a representing function to convert the predicate's output { t, f } to { 0, 1 } (note the order "t" to "0" and "f" to "1" matches with ~sg( ) defined below). By definition a function φ('''x''') is a "representing function" of the predicate P('''x''') if φ takes only values 0 and 1 and produces ''0'' when P is true".

In the following the mark " ' ", e.g. a', is the primitive mark meaning "the successor of", usually thought of as " +1", e.g. a +1 =&lt;sub&gt;def&lt;/sub&gt; a'. The functions 16-20 and #G are of particular interest with respect to converting primitive recursive predicates to, and extracting them from, their "arithmetical" form expressed as [[Gödel number]]s.

:# Addition: a+b
:# Multiplication: a×b
:# Exponentiation: a&lt;sup&gt;b&lt;/sup&gt;
:# Factorial a! : 0! = 1, a'! = a!×a'
:# pred(a): (Predecessor or decrement): If a &gt; 0 then a-1 else 0
:# Proper subtraction a ∸ b: If a ≥ b then a-b else 0
:# Minimum(a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ... a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;)
:# Maximum(a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ... a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;)
:# Absolute difference: | a-b | =&lt;sub&gt;def&lt;/sub&gt; (a ∸ b) + (b ∸ a)
:# ~sg(a): NOT[signum(a)]: If a=0 then 1 else 0
:# sg(a): signum(a): If a=0 then 0 else 1
:# a | b: (a divides b): If b=k×a for some k then 0 else 1
:# Remainder(a, b): the leftover if b does not divide a "evenly".  Also called MOD(a, b)
:# a = b: sg | a - b |  (Kleene's convention was to represent ''true'' by 0 and ''false'' by 1; presently, especially in computers, the most common convention is the reverse, namely to represent ''true'' by 1 and ''false'' by 0, which amounts to changing sg into ~sg here and in the next item)
:# a &lt; b: sg( a' ∸ b )
:# Pr(a): a is a prime number Pr(a) =&lt;sub&gt;def&lt;/sub&gt;  a&gt;1 &amp; NOT(Exists c)&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;c&lt;a&lt;/sub&gt; [ c|a ]
:# p&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;: the i+1-st prime number
:# (a)&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;: exponent of p&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; in a: the unique x such that p&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;x&lt;/sup&gt;|a &amp; NOT(p&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;x'&lt;/sup&gt;|a)
:# lh(a): the "length" or number of non-vanishing exponents in a
:# lo(a, b): logarithm of a to the base b

::* μy&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;z&lt;/sub&gt; R('''x''', y).  The operator μy&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;z&lt;/sub&gt; R('''x''', y) is a ''bounded'' form of the so-called minimization- or [[mu-operator]]: Defined as "the least value of y less than z such that R('''x''', y) is true; or z if there is no such value."

'So, in a sense the knowledge of the value NOT-φ(y; '''x'''&lt;sub&gt;2 to n&lt;/sub&gt; ) of the course-of-values function is equivalent to the knowledge of the sequence of values φ(0,'''x'''&lt;sub&gt;2 to n&lt;/sub&gt;), ..., φ(y-1,'''x'''&lt;sub&gt;2 to n&lt;/sub&gt;) of the original function."

== Additional primitive recursive forms ==

Some additional forms of recursion also define functions that are in fact
primitive recursive.  Definitions in these forms may be easier to find or
more natural for reading or writing. [[Course-of-values recursion]] defines primitive recursive functions. Some forms of [[mutual recursion]] also define primitive recursive functions.

The functions that can be programmed in the [[LOOP (programming language)|LOOP programming language]] are exactly the primitive recursive functions. This gives a different characterization of the power of these functions. The main limitation of the LOOP language, compared to a [[Turing-complete language]], is that in the LOOP language the number of times that each loop will run is specified before the loop begins to run.

== Finitism and consistency results ==

The primitive recursive functions are closely related to mathematical [[finitism]], and are used in several contexts in mathematical logic where a particularly constructive system is desired. [[Primitive recursive arithmetic]] (PRA), a formal axiom system for the natural numbers and the primitive recursive functions on them, is often used for this purpose.

PRA is much weaker than [[Peano arithmetic]], which is not a finitistic system. Nevertheless, many results in [[number theory]] and in [[proof theory]] can be proved in PRA. For example, [[Gödel's incompleteness theorem]] can be formalized into PRA, giving the following theorem:
:If ''T'' is a theory of arithmetic satisfying certain hypotheses, with Gödel sentence ''G''&lt;sub&gt;''T''&lt;/sub&gt;, then PRA proves the implication Con(''T'')&amp;rarr;''G''&lt;sub&gt;''T''&lt;/sub&gt;.
Similarly, many of the syntactic results in proof theory can be proved in PRA, which implies that there are primitive recursive functions that carry out the corresponding syntactic transformations of proofs.

In proof theory and [[set theory]], there is an interest in finitistic [[consistency proof]]s, that is, consistency proofs that themselves are finitistically acceptable. Such a proof establishes that the consistency of a theory ''T'' implies the consistency of a theory ''S'' by producing a primitive recursive function that can transform any proof of an inconsistency from ''S'' into a proof of an inconsistency from ''T''.  One sufficient condition for a consistency proof to be finitistic is the ability to formalize it in PRA. For example, many consistency results in set theory that are obtained by [[forcing (mathematics)|forcing]] can be recast as syntactic proofs that can be formalized in PRA.

== History ==
[[Recursive definition]]s had been used more or less formally in mathematics before, but the construction of primitive recursion is traced back to [[Richard Dedekind]]'s theorem 126 of his ''Was sind und was sollen die Zahlen?'' (1888). This work was the first to give a proof that a certain recursive construction defines a unique function.&lt;ref name="Smith2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Smith|title=An Introduction to Gödel's Theorems|year=2013|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-107-02284-3|pages=98–99|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tourlakis2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=George Tourlakis|title=Lectures in Logic and Set Theory: Volume 1, Mathematical Logic|year=2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-43942-8|page=129}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Downey2014"&gt;{{cite book|editor=Rod Downey|title=Turing's Legacy: Developments from Turing's Ideas in Logic|year=2014|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-107-04348-0|page=474}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Primitive recursive arithmetic]]  was first proposed by [[Thoralf Skolem]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Thoralf Skolem]] (1923) "The foundations of elementary arithmetic" in [[Jean van Heijenoort]], translator and ed. (1967) ''From Frege to Gödel: A Source Book in Mathematical Logic, 1879-1931''. Harvard Univ. Press: 302-33.&lt;/ref&gt; in 1923.

The current terminology was coined by [[Rózsa Péter]] (1934) after Ackermann had proved in 1928 that the function which today is named after him was not primitive recursive, an event which prompted the need to rename what until then were simply called recursive functions.&lt;ref name="Tourlakis2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Downey2014"/&gt;

'''{{lang|de|Sprechgesang}}''' ({{IPA-de|ˈʃpʀɛçɡəˌzaŋ|lang}}, "spoken singing") and '''{{lang|de|Sprechstimme}}''' ({{IPA-de|ˈʃpʀɛçˌʃtɪmə|lang}}, "spoken voice") are [[Expressionism (music)|expressionist]] vocal techniques between [[singing]] and [[Speech communication|speaking]]. Though sometimes used interchangeably, ''Sprechgesang'' is directly related to the [[opera]]tic ''[[recitative]]'' manner of singing (in which pitches are sung, but the articulation is rapid and loose like speech), whereas ''Sprechstimme'' is closer to speech itself (because it does not emphasise any particular pitches).&lt;ref&gt;Wood, Ralph W.. ''Concerning "Sprechgesang"'', Tempo, new series no. 2, December 1946. (pp. 3–6)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sprechgesang==

''Sprechgesang'' is more closely aligned with the long-used musical techniques of ''[[recitative]]'' or ''parlando'' than is ''Sprechstimme''. Where the term is employed in this way, it is usually in the context of the late [[Romantic music|Romantic]] [[German opera]]s or "music dramas" that were composed by [[Richard Wagner]] and others in the 19th century. Thus, ''Sprechgesang'' is often merely a German alternative to ''recitative''.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, 1946: "'Sprechgesang' means a 'parlando' manner of singing, and indeed is translated in standard dictionaries as 'recitative,' whereas 'sprechstimme' in itself simply means 'speaking voice'".&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sprechstimme ==

The earliest compositional use of the technique was in the first version of [[Engelbert Humperdinck (composer)|Engelbert Humperdinck]]'s 1897 melodrama ''[[Königskinder]]'' (in the 1910 version it was replaced by conventional singing), where it may have been intended to imitate a style already in use by singers of lieder and popular song,&lt;ref&gt;Griffiths, Paul, "Sprechgesang", ''The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians'', second edition, edited by [[Stanley Sadie]] and [[John Tyrrell (professor of music)|John Tyrrell]] (London: Macmillan Publishers, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; but it is more closely associated with the composers of the [[Second Viennese School]]. [[Arnold Schoenberg]] asks for the technique in a number of pieces: the part of the Speaker in ''[[Gurre-Lieder]]'' (1911) is written in his notation for ''sprechstimme'', but it was ''[[Pierrot Lunaire]]'' (1912) where he used it throughout and left a note attempting to explain the technique. [[Alban Berg]] adopted the technique and asked for it in parts of his operas ''[[Wozzeck]]'' and ''[[Lulu (opera)|Lulu]]''.

=== History ===

In the foreword to ''[[Pierrot Lunaire]]'' (1912), Schoenberg explains how his ''Sprechstimme'' should be achieved. He explains that the indicated rhythms should be adhered to, but that whereas in ordinary singing a constant pitch is maintained through a note, here the singer "immediately abandons it by falling or rising. The goal is certainly not at all a realistic, natural speech. On the contrary, the difference between ordinary speech and speech that collaborates in a musical form must be made plain. But it should not call singing to mind, either."&lt;ref&gt;Schoenberg, Arnold. ''Verklärte Nacht and Pierrot Lunaire.'' Dover Publications. New York, 1994. {{ISBN|0-486-27885-9}} (p. 54)&lt;/ref&gt;

For the first performances of ''Pierrot Lunaire'', Schoenberg was able to work directly with the vocalist and obtain exactly the result he desired, but later performances were problematic. Schoenberg had written many subsequent letters attempting to clarify, but he was unable to leave a definitive explanation and there has been much disagreement as to what was actually intended. [[Pierre Boulez]] would write, "the question arises whether it is actually possible to speak according to a notation devised for singing. This was the real problem at the root of all the controversies. Schoenberg's own remarks on the subject are not in fact clear."&lt;ref&gt;Boulez, Pierre. ''Orientations''. Faber and Faber. London, 1986. {{ISBN|0-571-14347-4}} (From the essay ''Speaking, Playing, Singing'', written 1963, pp. 330–335)&lt;/ref&gt;

Schoenberg would later use a notation without a traditional clef in the ''Ode to Napoleon Bonaparte'' (1942), ''[[A Survivor from Warsaw]]'' (1947) and his unfinished opera ''[[Moses und Aron]]'', which eliminated any reference to a specific pitch, but retained the relative slides and articulations.

=== Notation ===
In Schoenberg's [[musical notation]], ''Sprechstimme'' is usually indicated by small crosses through the stems of the notes, or with the note head itself being a small cross.

Schoenberg's later notation (first used in his ''Ode to Napoleon Bonaparte'', 1942) replaced the 5-line staff with a single line having no clef. The note stems no longer bear the ''x'', as it is now clear that no specific pitch is intended, and instead relative pitches are specified by placing the notes above or below the single line (sometimes on [[ledger lines]]). &lt;!-- this could use a picture --&gt;

Berg notates several degrees of ''Sprechstimme'', e. g. in ''[[Wozzeck]]'', using single-line staff for rhythmic speaking, five-line staffs with x through the note stem, and a single stroke through the stem for close-to-singing ''sprechstimme''.

In modern usage, it is most common to indicate ''Sprechstimme'' by using "x"'s in place of conventional noteheads.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gardner Read|Read, Gardner]]. ''Musical Notation.'' Taplinger Publishing, New York, 1979. {{ISBN|0-8008-5453-5}} (p. 288)&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[team sport]]s, '''substitution''' (or '''interchange''') is replacing one player with another during a match.  Substitute players that are not in the [[starting lineup]] (also known as '''bench players''', '''backups''', or '''reserves''') reside on the '''bench''' and are available to substitute for a starter. Later in the match, that substitute may be substituted for by another substitute or by a starter who is currently on the bench.

Some sports have restrictions on substituting or interchanging players whereas others do not. [[American football]], [[ice hockey]], and [[basketball]] are examples of sports which practice "unlimited" substitution, albeit subject to certain rules. Substitution is unlimited during play in [[ice hockey]]. In [[basketball]], substitution is permitted only during stoppages of play, but is otherwise unlimited. In [[baseball]] and [[association football]] (soccer), substitution is permitted only during stoppages of play, and a player who has been substituted out of a game cannot re-enter it.

In [[motorsports]], a substitution behind the wheel goes by the term "relief driver."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2874">'''Thomas of Marga''', ({{lang-syc|ܬܐܘܡܐ ܒܪ ܝܥܩܘܒ}}, ''{{transl|syc|Taomá bár Yaˁqub}}'') was an [[Church of the East|East Syriac]] [[bishop]] and author of an important monastic history in [[Syriac language|Syriac]], who flourished in the 9th century CE. He was born early in the century in the region of Salakh to the north-east of [[Mosul]]. As a young man he became in 832 a monk of the monastery of [[Beth 'Abhe]], which was situated at the confluence of the [[Great Zab]] with one of its tributaries, about 25 miles east of Mosul. A few years later he was acting as secretary to Abraham, who had been abbot of Beth 'Abhe, and was [[List of Patriarchs of the Church of the East|patriarch of the Church of the East]] from 837 to 850.

At some date during these 13 years Thomas was promoted by Abraham to be bishop of the [[Marga (East Syrian Diocese)|diocese of Marga]] in the same district as Beth 'Abhe, and afterwards he was further advanced to be a metropolitan of [[Beth Garmai]], a district farther to the southeast in the mountains which border the [[Tigris]] basin. It was during the period of his life at Beth 'Abhe and his bishopric that he composed ''The Book of Governors'', which is in the main a history of his own monastery, but includes lives of Assyrian Christian holy men in other parts of [[Mesopotamia]] and the regions east of the Tigris. The work was probably planned in imitation of the famous ''Paradise'' of [[Palladius of Galatia|Palladius]], the history of Egyptian monasticism which had become well known to Syriac-speaking Christians in the version of [[Anan-Isho]] (6th century).

''The Book of Governors'' has been edited with an [[English language|English]] translation and a copious introduction by E. W. Budge (2 vols., [[London]], 1893; [https://books.google.com/books?id=jWxQ4VUIhvUC&amp;pg=PA3&amp;lpg=PA3&amp;dq=%22Book+of+Governors%22+Thomas+of+Marga+translation&amp;source=web&amp;ots=m4G8tfbMoM&amp;sig=UrQ9n0K9zw8XJaHTKz2uTOC2LRE&amp;hl=en#PPP7,M1 Google Books]), who claims that "it occupies a unique position in [[Syriac literature]], and it fully deserves the veneration with which it has been and is still regarded by all classes of Assyrians to whom it is known." It gives a detailed history of the great monastery cf Beth 'Abhe during its three centuries of existence down to the author's time. It is full of interesting narratives of saintly men told in a naive and candid spirit, and it throws much light on the history of Christianity in the Persian dominions. There is a later edition by P. Bedjan ([[Paris]], 1901).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7312">'''Tragédie en musique''' ({{IPA-fr|tʁaʒedi ɑ̃ myzik|lang}}, ''musical tragedy''), also known as '''tragédie lyrique''' ({{IPA-fr|tʁaʒedi liʁik|lang}}, ''lyric tragedy''), is a genre of [[French opera]] introduced by [[Jean-Baptiste Lully]] and used by his followers until the second half of the eighteenth century. Operas in this genre are usually based on stories from [[Classical mythology]] or the Italian romantic epics of [[Torquato Tasso|Tasso]] and [[Ariosto]]. The stories may not have a tragic ending – in fact, they generally don't – but the atmosphere must be noble and elevated. The standard ''tragédie en musique'' has five acts. Earlier works in the genre were preceded by an allegorical prologue and, during the lifetime of [[Louis XIV]], these generally celebrated the king's noble qualities and his prowess in war. Each of the five acts usually follows a basic pattern, opening with an aria in which one of the main characters expresses their feelings, followed by dialogue in recitative interspersed with short arias (''petits airs''), in which the main business of the plot occurs. Each act traditionally ends with a ''divertissement'', offering great opportunities for the chorus and the ballet troupe. Composers sometimes changed the order of these features in an act for dramatic reasons.

==Notable examples of the genre==

Apart from Lully, the most considerable writer of ''tragédies en musique'' is [[Rameau]], whose five works in the form are considered the culminating masterpieces of the genre. The ''Viking Opera Guide'' refers to [[Marc-Antoine Charpentier]]'s ''tragédie'' ''[[Médée (Charpentier)|Médée]]'' as ''"arguably the finest French opera of the seventeenth century"''. In the eighteenth century, [[Jean-Marie Leclair]]'s lone ''tragédie [[Scylla et Glaucus]]'' has been similarly praised. Other highly esteemed exponents are [[André Campra]] (''[[Tancrède]]'', ''[[Idoménée]]''), [[Marin Marais]] (''[[Alcyone (opera)|Alcyone]]'', Sémélé) and [[Michel Montéclair|Michel Pignolet de Montéclair]] (''[[Jephté]]'').

'''Vir Singh''' or '''Veer Singh''' (5 December 1872 in [[Amritsar]] &amp;ndash; 10 June 1957 in Amritsar) (''punjabi:'' ਭਾਈ ਵੀਰ ਸਿੰਘ) was a poet, scholar, and theologian of the Sikh revival movement, playing an important part in the renewal of [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] literary tradition. Singh's contributions were so important and influential that he became canonized as Bhai, an honorific often given to those whom could be considered a saint of the Sikh faith.

== Family and personal life ==
Born in 1872, in [[Amritsar]], Bhai Vir Singh was the eldest of Dr. Charan Singh's three sons. Vir Singh's family could trace its ancestry as far back as to Diwan Kaura Mal, a vice-governor (Maharaja Bahadur) of the city [[Multan]]. His grandfather, Kahn Singh (1788-1878), spent a great deal of his youth training and learning traditional Sikh lessons in monasteries. Fluent in [[Sanskrit]] and [[Braj]], as well as in the oriental systems of medicine (such as [[Ayurveda]], [[Siddha]] and [[Yunani]]), Kahn Singh influenced his only son, Dr. Charan Singh, who later fathered Vir Singh, to become an active member of the Sikh community, often producing poetry, music, and writings in hopes of restoring the Sikh community. At seventeen, Bhai Vir Singh himself married Chatar Kaur and had two daughters with her. He died in Amritsar on 10 June 1957.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sikh-history.com/sikhhist/personalities/literature/veer.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education ==
Bhai Vir Singh Ji had the benefit of both the traditional indigenous learning as well as of modern English education. He learnt Sikh scripture as well as Persian, [[Urdu]] and Sanskrit. He then joined the Church Mission School, Amritsar and took his matriculation examination in 1891 and stood first all over in the district.&lt;ref name=Gurmukh /&gt; Singh received his secondary education at Church Mission High School, and it was while attending school that the conversion of some of his classmates from Sikhism to Christianity that Singh's own religious convictions toward Sikhism were fortified. Influenced by the Christian missionaries' use of and reference to literary sources, Singh got the idea to teach others the main dogmas of Sikhism through his own written resources. Using the skills and techniques in modern literary forms that he learned through his English courses, Singh produced stories, poems, and epics and recorded the history and philosophical ideas of Sikhism.&lt;ref name=dog&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=qfuDnpVlmlcC&amp;pg=PA30&amp;dq=bhai+vir+singh&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=EzNTVMWpB9j6oQTtmICoBA&amp;ved=0CEQQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=bhai%20vir%20singh&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

== Literary career ==

=== Beginnings ===
Singh chose to become a writer. After passing his matriculation examination, he worked with a friend of his father's, Wazir Singh, and set up a lithography press. His first commission to write and print were geography textbooks for some schools.&lt;ref name = dog/&gt;

=== Language politics ===
Singh argued that Sikhism was a unique religion which could be nourished and sustained by creating an awakening amongst the Sikhs of the awareness of their distinct theological and cultural identity. He aimed at reorienting the Sikhs' understanding of their faith in such a manner as to help them assimilate the different modernising influences to their historical memory and cultural heritage. At the time, Sikhs were often persecuted by the British, often being pressured or threatened into assimilating into mainstream culture. Acts such as publicly shaving off the heads and beards of religious Sikh officials were performed to humiliate and demean the Sikh religion.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sikhsandsociety.org/bhai-vir-singh-overview/&lt;/ref&gt; Amidst all this political discontent, Singh sought to revitilize the Sikh culture and religion through peaceful means, by writing a myriad of novels, epics, and poems. With the fall of the [[Sikh Empire]] and the modernization of Christian, Muslim, and Hindu movements of [[proselytism]], the Sikh faith began to wane until scholars and theologians of the religions, Singh being a leading one, began revitalizing life into Sikhism through their works of literature.&lt;ref name=dog/&gt;

=== Works ===
[[File:Working Desk of BHAI VIR SINGH.jpg|thumb|right|Working desk of Bhai Vir Singh as preserved in his memorial house at Amritsar]]
Bhai Vir Singh began [[Al-Yasmin International School|taking]] an  interest in the affairs of the [[Singh sabha movement]]. To promote its aims and objects, he launched the [[Khalsa Tract Society]] in 1894. The tracts produced by the Khalsa Tract Society introduced a new style of literary Punjabi.

The Khalsa Tract Society periodically made available under the title ''Nirguniara'', low-cost publications on Sikh theology, history and philosophy and on social and religious reform. Through this journal, Singh established contact with an ever-expanding circle of readers. He used the Nirguniara as a vehicle for his own self-expression. Some of his major creative works such as ''Sri Guru Nanak Chamatkar'' and ''Sri Guru Kalgidhar Chamatkar'', were originally serialised in its columns.

In literature, Singh started as a writer of romances which are considered forerunners of the Punjabi novel. His writings in this genre&amp;nbsp;– ''Sundari'' (1898), ''Bijay Singh'' (1899), ''Satwant Kaur'' (published in two parts, I in 1900 and II in 1927), were aimed at recreating the heroic period (eighteenth century) of Sikh history. Through these novels he made available to his readers, models of courage, fortitude and human dignity. Singh championed the Sikh identity in a way that did not devalue other religions. He even reprimanded the violation and destruction the Hindu idols in Kashmir in his book, ''Avantipur de Khandar''. Singh also criticized and discouraged religious fanaticism, citing those as victims of their own fears brought on by a fervent and obsessive belief.&lt;ref name="Singh"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e0ZmAXw7ok8C|title=Sikhism: An Introduction|last=Singh|first=Nikky-Guninder Kaur|date=2011-03-15|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=9781848853218|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The novel ''Subhagji da Sudhar Hathin Baba Naudh Singh'', popularly known as ''Baba Naudh Singh'' (serialised in Nirguniara from 1907 onwards and published in book form in 1921), shares with the epic ''Rana Surat Singh'' (which he had started serialising in 1905) Vir Singh's interest in the theme of a widow's desperate urge for a reunion with her dead husband.
[[File:BHAI VIR SINGH MEMORIAL ENTRANCE VIEW.jpg|thumbnail|left|A short poem called Rubai written by Bhai Vir Singh and produced on a plaque placed at entrance to Singh's memorial house]]

Soon after the publication of Rana Surat Singh in book form in 1919, he turned to shorter poems and lyrics. These included ''Dil Tarang'' (1920), ''Tarel Tupke'' (1921), ''Lahiran de Har'' (1921), ''Matak Hulare'' (1922), ''Bijlian de Har'' (1927) and ''Mere Sayian Jio'' (1953). Through these works, he paved the way for the emergence of the Punjabi poem.

In November 1899, he started a Punjabi weekly, the ''Khalsa Samachar''. He revised and enlarged Giani Hazara Singh's dictionary, ''Sri Guru Granth Kosh'', originally published in 1898. The revised version was published in 1927. He published critical editions of some of the old Sikh texts such as ''Sikhan di Bhagat Mala'' (1912), ''Prachin Panth Prakash'' (1914), ''Puratan Janam Sakhi'' (1926) and ''Sakhi Pothi'' (1950).

An important work was Singh's annotation of Santokh Singh's ''Sri Gur Pratap Suraj Granth'', published from 1927 to 1935 in fourteen volumes.

=== Role of women in writings ===
Unlike most of the popular religions, Sikhism stresses the equality between men and women and that it is even sinful to consider either sex above the other.&lt;ref&gt;(http://www.sikhs.org/women.htm)&lt;/ref&gt; Singh reflected this belief in his novels, and featured them in a number of strong female characters. In fact, his very first novel was ''Sundari'', which featured Sunder Kaur, a woman who converted from Hinduism to Sikhism and then proceeded to lead a life of adventure in the jungles with a band of Sikh warriors.&lt;ref name="gencen.isp.msu.edu"&gt;http://gencen.isp.msu.edu/documents/Working_Papers/WP209.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first novel penned in the Punjabi language.&lt;ref name="gencen.isp.msu.edu"/&gt; Through Sundari, Singh hoped to embody all the ideals of [[Guru Nanak]]’s lessons. The book was well received by the Sikh community and gained popularity almost immediately.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eUJICz55HFMC|title=The Feminine Principle in the Sikh Vision of the Transcendent|last=Singh|first=Nikky-Guninder Kaur|date=1993-09-24|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521432870|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other important female characters he wrote were Rani Raj Kaur, Satvant Kaur, Subhagji and Sushil Kaur. Even by today's modern standards, these female characters are still considered to be well rounded and an inspiration to both male and female Sikhs alike.&lt;ref name="Singh"/&gt; Bhai Vir Singh went even as far as often portraying the women in his novels as more prone to spiritual enlightenment than her male counterpart.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt;

=== Punjab &amp; Sind Bank ===
Bhai Vir Singh was one of the founders of the [[Punjab &amp; Sind Bank]].

== Awards ==
He was honoured with the [[Sahitya Akademi Award]] in 1955 and the [[Padma Bhushan]] Award in 1956.&lt;ref name=Bhai /&gt;

== Posthumous Recognition ==
The portion of his commentary on the [[Adi Granth]]&amp;nbsp;– nearly one half of the Holy Book&amp;nbsp;– he had completed was published posthumously in seven large volumes.

'''Yechiel Granatstein''' ({{lang-he|יחיאל גראנאטשטיין}}; June 6, 1913 – February 7, 2008) was a [[Poland|Polish]]-born [[Jewish]] author and writer in [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] and [[Hebrew]], as well as a partisan fighter in World War II and a [[Jewish refugee]] activist following the [[Holocaust]].

==Life==
Yechiel Granatstein was born in [[Lublin]], Poland on June 6, 1913.  Even before [[World War II]], he had developed his skills as a writer, writing for Dos Yiddish Tagblat and various [[World Agudath Israel|Agudah]] periodicals.  While still young and single, he was drafted into the Polish army for military training. He lived in [[Łódź]] in 1936-1939.  Following the Nazi-Soviet [[invasion of Poland]] at the outbreak of World War II he escaped from the Germans to [[Slonim]], which was on the Russian side of the [[Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact|Molotov–Ribbentrop line]], eventually entrapped in the [[Słonim Ghetto]] after [[Operation Barbarossa]].&lt;ref name="PL198"&gt;{{cite book |title=Holocaust: The Nazi Persecution and Murder of the Jews |author=Peter Longerich |publisher=OUP Oxford |year=2010 |ISBN=0192804367 |pages=198, 238, 347 |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=cxYqYIn73SgC&amp;q=Slonim}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
{{see also|Jewish ghettos in German-occupied Poland}}

In 1942 he escaped to the nearby forests and joined the partisans that were fighting the Nazis. He was accepted into the partisan unit because of his earlier training as a soldier and because he possessed an automatic machine gun. After the war he returned to Łódź where he assisted refugees in leaving Europe from his base at 66 Wschodnia Street and then continued his refugee rescue work in [[Paris]] from 1946-1950. It was in Paris in 1950 that he published an [[autobiography]] of his time fighting as a Jewish partisan under the title "I Wanted to Live" (Ich hob gevolt lebn" in Yiddish), which detailed the dangers he faced not just from the German Nazis, but from his fellow Russian partisans as well.  This book was translated into Hebrew and in English under the title "The War of a Jewish Partisan".  He immigrated to [[Israel]] in the 1950s where he continued to write about pre-war Europe and the Holocaust.  In Israel he wrote for "Shearim", "[[Hamodia]]", "[[HaTzofe]]" and other newspapers and journals.  He also wrote a biography about his father-in-law's, the Radoschitzer Rebbe's, experiences in  the ghettos and [[concentration camps]].  He died February 7, 2008 in Israel.
