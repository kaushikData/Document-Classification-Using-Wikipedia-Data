'''Art in Poland''' refers to all forms of [[visual art]] in or associated with [[Poland]].

Polish art has often reflected European trends while maintaining its unique character. The [[Kraków]] school of Historicist painting developed by [[Jan Matejko]] produced monumental portrayals of customs and significant events in Polish history. He is referred to as the most famous [[Polish painters|Polish painter]] or even the "national painter" of Poland.&lt;ref name="TPaP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://info-poland.buffalo.edu/classroom/JM/JM.html |title=Jan Matejko: The Painter and Patriot Fostering Polish Nationalism |publisher=Info-poland.buffalo.edu |accessdate=2011-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MioPa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://info-poland.buffalo.edu/classroom/Szyszko.html#Matejko |title=History's Impact on Polish Art |publisher=Info-poland.buffalo.edu |accessdate=2011-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Reddaway1971"&gt;{{cite book|author=William Fiddian Reddaway|title=The Cambridge History of Poland|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=As43AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA547|year=1971|publisher=CUP Archive|page=547|id=GGKEY:2G7C1LPZ3RN}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[Stanisław Witkiewicz]] was an ardent supporter of [[Realism (arts)|Realism]] in Polish art, its main representative being [[Józef Marian Chełmoński|Jozef Chełmoński]].

Artists of the twentieth-century Avant-Garde represented various schools and trends. The art of [[Tadeusz Makowski]] was influenced by [[Cubism]]; while [[Władysław Strzemiński]] and [[Henryk Stażewski]] worked within the Constructivist idiom. Distinguished contemporary artists include [[Roman Opałka]], [[Wilhelm Sasnal]], Leon Tarasewicz, [[Jerzy Nowosielski]], [[Wojciech Siudmak]], [[Mirosław Bałka]], and [[Katarzyna Kozyra]] and Zbigniew Wąsiel in the younger generation.

'''Artmedia''' was one of the first scientific projects concerning the relationship between art, technology, philosophy and [[aesthetics]]. It was founded in 1985 at the [[University of Salerno]]. For over two decades, until 2009, dozens of projects, studies, exhibitions and conferences on new technologies&lt;ref&gt;In addition to the ten international "Artmedia" conferences, which took place in Salerno and Paris from 1985 to 2008, the Laboratory has led to numerous other initiatives and events, such as "L'immaginario tecnologico", 1984 (conference and exhibition); "Technettronica", 1989 (Exhibition about the Aesthetics of Communication); "Estetica e antropologia", 1983 (International Symposium); "Tecnologie e forme nell'arte e nella scienza", 2003 (International Symposium); "New Technologies: Roy Ascott, Maurizio Bolognini, Fred Forest, Richard Kriesche, Mit Mitropoulos", Museo del Sannio, 2003 (Exhibition on the Aesthetics of Communication); "Estetica e tecnologia", 1987 (Symposium); "L'immateriale in piazza" (Aitiani, Forest, Mitropoulos, Grossi, Prado), Naples, 1992 (Exhibition on the Aesthetics of Communication); "Un'estetica per i media" 1989 (RAI, Dipartimento Scuola Educazione, TV program); "Cartacarbone", 1990 (radio program); "Coincidences", 1995 (Aesthetics journal, in French); "Epiphaneia", 1995-1996 (Aesthetics journal, in Italian). See ''Edition spéciale Artmedia'', "Art Press", Paris, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; made Artmedia a reference point for many internationally renowned scholars and artists,&lt;ref&gt;A. R., ''Des hauts et débats. Colloque Artmedia VIII'', "Liberation", November 29, 2002, p. 13; ''Dossier: De l’esthétique de la communication au Net Art'', "Art Press", 285, November 2002, pp. 37-43.&lt;/ref&gt; and contributed to the growing cultural interest in the aesthetics of [[New media|media]], the aesthetics of [[Computer network|networks]], and their [[ethical]] and [[Anthropology|anthropological]] implications.

==Beginnings and international events==
Since the late 1970s, a permanent ''Seminar of the Aesthetics of Media and Communication'' has been directed by its founder [[Mario Costa (philosopher)|Mario Costa]] at the University of Salerno. The basic principles of the aesthetics of technological communication were identified and conceptualized in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;The history of the "aesthetics of communication", especially upon its debut in the 1980s, is recorded in the book by Mario Costa,''The Aesthetics of Communication. Aesthetic use of simultaneity at a distance'', Rome, Castelvecchi, 1999; its basic principles, formulated by Costa, were expressed for the first time in ''News and Notes'', published by the International Center of Aesthetic Communication, Salerno, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; A conference on "Technological Imaginary", held in 1984 at the Museo del Sannio in [[Benevento]], discussed the issue of the new relationship between art and technology and the consequent need to re-evaluate aesthetics, warning that "all our future existence will be played at the crossroads between technology and imaginary".&lt;ref&gt;"Aa. Vv., ''L’immaginario tecnologico'', Museo del Sannio, Benevento, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

The comprehensive relationship between art and [[technoscience]], technology, and philosophy has also been the theoretical subject of the ten international "Artmedia" conferences which were held in Salerno and Paris between 1985 and 2008. Particularly relevant were conferences held in Paris between 2002 and 2008, which took place at the [[Ecole Normale Supérieure]], the [[Bibliotheque Nationale de France]] (BNF) and the Institut National d'Histoire de l 'Art (INHA), with the partnership of the Société Française d'Esthétique, the [[Université du Québec à Montréal]], the [[University of Toronto]], the [[Universidade de São Paulo]], the [[Sorbonne University|Université de Paris 1 Sorbonne]], and the U.S. magazine [[Leonardo (journal)|Leonardo]].&lt;ref&gt;See Mario Costa, Fred Forest (eds) (2011), ''Ethique, esthétique, communication technologique dans l'art contemporain ou le destin du sens'', Paris: Institut National Audiovisuel, Editions L'Harmattan, and ''Dossier Artmedia VIII'', in "Ligeia", Paris, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Continuous debate between artists and theorists==
[[Image:DeKerckhove Berger Costa ArtmediaIV 1992.JPG|right|thumb|[[Derrick de Kerckhove]], [[René Berger]] and [[Mario Costa (philosopher)|Mario Costa]], Artmedia IV (1992)]]
[[Image:Bolognini Kriesche Costa Kac ArtmediaVII 1999.JPG|right|thumb|[[Maurizio Bolognini]], Richard Kriesche, [[Mario Costa (philosopher)|Mario Costa]] and [[Eduardo Kac]], Artmedia VII (1999)]]
Artmedia wanted to gather theorists and artists from all over the world and encourage both joint and complementary work, beginning with the need to give attention to theoretical and artistic practices and developing both together. These also contributed towards spreading the spirit of the project, both in a number of festivals and shows, and through their own artworks and research.&lt;ref&gt;Antonella Fimiani, ''Arte &amp; tecnologia, la frontiera-Salerno'', in "Il Mattino", November 24, 1999, p. 23; Sylvie Lisiecki e Marie Saladin, ''Fenetrês sur les arts numériques'', in "Croniques de la Bibliothèque Nationale de France", 46, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Theorists who worked with Artmedia and participated in its activities included [[Bernard Stiegler]], [[René Berger]], [[Abraham Moles]], [[Derrick De Kerckhove]], [[Pierre Levy]], Gillo Dorfles, [[Paul Virilio]], [[Frank Popper]], [[Roger Malina]], Daniel Charles, José Jiménez, Anne Cauquelin, [[Edgar Morin]], [[Thierry de Duve]], [[Catherine Millet]], Filiberto Menna, Andreas Broeckmann, Rudolf zur Lippe, [[Edmond Couchot]], Dominique Chateau, Yannick Geffroy, Philippe Queau, Arlindo Machado, Tetsuo Kogawa, and Bernard Teyssedre.

Artists included [[Fred Forest]], [[Roy Ascott]], [[Takahiko Iimura]], [[Maurizio Bolognini]], [[Tom Klinkowstein]], Tom Sherman, [[Eduardo Kac]], Enzo Minarelli, [[James Dashow]], [[Peter D'Agostino]], Mit Mitropoulos, [[Shawn Brixey]], Bruno Di Bello, [[Antoni Muntadas]], [[Orlan]], Kit Galloway, [[David Rokeby]], [[Miguel Chevalier]], [[Norman White]], Richard Kriesche, Olivier Auber, [[Caterina Davinio]] and [[Casey Reas]].&lt;ref&gt;On the participation of artists and theorists, see in particular: Mario Costa, Fred Forest (eds) (2011), ''Ethique, esthétique, communication technologique dans l'art contemporain ou le destin du sens'', Paris: Institut National Audiovisuel, Editions L'Harmattan; Mario Costa (ed.) (2004), ''New Technologies: [[Roy Ascott]], Maurizio Bolognini, [[Fred Forest]], Richard Kriesche, Mit Mitropoulos'', Salerno: Artmedia, Museo del Sannio; ''Dossier Artmedia VIII'', in "Ligeia", Paris, 2002, pp. 21-245; ''Edition spéciale Artmedia'', "Art Press", Paris, 2002; see also the OLATS/Leonardo websites: http://www.olats.org/projetpart/artmedia/2002/mono_index.php and http://www.olats.org/projetpart/artmedia/2008/mono_index.php .&lt;/ref&gt;

The questions raised in various projects promoted by Artmedia, in a continuous dialogue between artists and theorists, led to discussions on topics including ''Aesthetics of Communication and the anthropology of the future'' (1985), ''Global aesthetic communication'' (1986), ''Electronic performativity and the art system'' (1990), ''Neo-technological arts between aesthetics and communication'' (1992), ''Aesthetic research and technology'' (1995), ''Developments in aesthetics: change or mutation?'' (1999), ''From the Aesthetics of Communication to Net art'' (2002), and ''Ethics, aesthetics and techno-communication. The future of meaning'' (2008).

All Artmedia symposiums have been followed by many publications. For the two held in Paris, a complete video recording is also available, and can be viewed at the [[Institut National de l'Audiovisuel]].

An assessment of 25 years of Artmedia activity was made into a seminar on ''The aesthetic object of the future'', held at the [[University of Salerno]] in 2009. The Artmedia project produced a large number of publications and documents that are being catalogued, with a view to their proper placement and use.

'''Authoritarianism''' is a term [[political scientist]]s use for a worldview that values [[orderliness]] and [[authority]], and distrusts outsiders and [[social change]]. As a form of [[government]], it is characterized by strong central power and limited [[political freedom]]s. Individual economic or personal freedoms are subordinate to the state and there is no constitutional [[accountability]] under an authoritarian regime.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.vox.com/2016/3/1/11127424/trump-authoritarianism&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.vox.com/2016/4/28/11431892/after-trump-how-authoritarian-voters-will-change-american-politics&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gap"&gt;{{cite book|title=Government and Politics - Volume I|last=Sekiguchi|first=Masashi|publisher=EOLSS Publications|isbn=9781905839698|page=92|url=https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Gkm5DAAAQBAJ|accessdate=26 December 2016|date=2010-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Juan Linz]]'s influential 1964 description of authoritarianism&lt;ref&gt;Richard Shorten, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=8ffbV8ZpQ3MC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Modernism and Totalitarianism: Rethinking the Intellectual Sources of Nazism and Stalinism, 1945 to the Present]'' (Palgrave Macmillan, 2012), p. 256 (note 67).&lt;/ref&gt; characterized authoritarian [[political system]]s by four qualities:
# Limited [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|political pluralism]], that is such regimes place constraints on political institutions and groups like [[legislature]]s, [[Political party|political parties]] and [[interest group]]s;
# A basis for [[Political legitimacy|legitimacy]] based on emotion, especially the identification of the regime as a necessary evil to combat "easily recognizable societal problems" such as [[underdevelopment]] or [[insurgency]]; 
# Minimal [[social mobilization]] most often caused by constraints on the public such as suppression of political opponents and anti-regime activity;
# Informally defined executive power with often vague and shifting powers.&lt;ref&gt;Gretchen Casper, [https://books.google.com/books?id=7ZVDjmr18f4C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Fragile Democracies: The Legacies of Authoritarian Rule], pp. 40–50 (citing Linz 1964).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Authoritarian government and states==
===Types===
Linz distinguished new forms of authoritarianism from personalistic dictatorships and totalitarian states, taking [[Francoist Spain]] as an example. Unlike personalistic dictatorships, new forms of authoritarianism have institutionalized representation of a variety of actors (in Spain's case, including the military, the [[Catholic Church]], [[Falange Española y de las JONS|Falange]], [[Monarchism|monarchists]], [[technocrat]]s and others). Unlike totalitarian states, the regime relies on passive mass acceptance rather than popular support.&lt;ref&gt;Todd Landman, ''Studying Human Rights'' (Routledge, 2003), p. 71 (citing Linz 1964 and others).&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars also mention the emergence of a different type of regime - the hybrid regime - in the post-Cold War era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mufti |first1=Mariam |title=What Do We Know about Hybrid Regimes after Two Decades of Scholarship? |journal=Politics and Governance |volume=6 |issue=5 |pages=112 |doi=10.17645/pag.v6i2.1400 |url=https://www.cogitatiopress.com/politicsandgovernance/article/view/1400|year=2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several subtypes of authoritarian regimes have been identified by Linz and others.&lt;ref name="Gasiorowski"&gt;Mark J. Gasiorowski, [{{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=uxO2QHFzlZsC |page=105 }} The Political Regimes Project], in ''On Measuring Democracy: Its Consequences and Concomitants'' (ed. Alex Inketes), 2006, pp. 110–11.&lt;/ref&gt; Linz identified the two most basic subtypes as traditional authoritarian regimes and bureaucratic-military authoritarian regimes:
* Traditional authoritarian regimes are those "in which the ruling authority (generally a single person)" is maintained in power "through a combination of appeals to traditional legitimacy, [[Clientelism|patron-client ties]] and repression, which is carried out by an apparatus bound to the ruling authority through personal loyalties". An example is [[Ethiopia]] under [[Haile Selassie&amp;nbsp;I]].&lt;ref name="Gasiorowski"/&gt; 
* Bureaucratic-military authoritarian regimes are those "governed by a [[military junta|coalition of military officers]] and technocrats who act pragmatically (rather than ideologically) within the limits of their bureaucratic mentality."&lt;ref name="Gasiorowski"/&gt; [[Mark J. Gasiorowski]] suggests that it is best to distinguish "simple military authoritarian regimes" from "bureaucratic authoritarian regimes" in which "a powerful group of technocrats uses the state apparatus to try to rationalize and develop the economy" such as [[South Korea]] under [[Park Chung-hee]].&lt;ref name="Gasiorowski"/&gt;

Linz also has identified three other subtypes of authoritarian regime: [[Corporatism|corporatist]] or organic-statistic, racial and ethnic "democracy" and post-totalitarian.&lt;ref name="Gasiorowski"/&gt;
* Corporatist authoritarian regimes "are those in which corporatism institutions are used extensively by the state to coopt and demobilize powerful interest groups". This type has been studied most extensively in [[Latin America]].&lt;ref name="Gasiorowski"/&gt;
* Racial and ethnic "democracies" are those in which "certain racial or ethnic groups enjoy full democratic rights while others are largely or entirely denied those rights", such as in [[South Africa under apartheid]].&lt;ref name="Gasiorowski"/&gt;
* Post-totalitarian authoritarian regimes are those in which totalitarian institutions (such as the party, [[secret police]] and state-controlled mass media&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Heinrich |first1=Andreas |last2=Pleines |first2=Heiko |title=The Meaning of 'Limited Pluralism' in Media Reporting under Authoritarian Rule |journal=Politics and Governance |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=103 |doi=10.17645/pag.v6i2.1238 |url=https://www.cogitatiopress.com/politicsandgovernance/article/view/1238|year=2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) remain, but where "ideological orthodoxy has declined in favor of routinization, repression has declined, the state's top leadership is less personalized and more secure, and the level of mass mobilization has declined substantially".&lt;ref name="Gasiorowski" /&gt; Examples include the [[Russian Federation]] and [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Eastern bloc]] states in the mid-1980s.&lt;ref name="Gasiorowski"/&gt;

Authoritarian regimes are also sometimes subcategorized by whether they are personalistic or [[Populism|populist]].&lt;ref name="Gasiorowski"/&gt; Personalistic authoritarian regimes are characterized by arbitrary rule and [[authority]] exercised "mainly through patronage networks and coercion rather than through institutions and formal rules".&lt;ref name="Gasiorowski"/&gt; Personalistic authoritarian regimes have been seen in post-colonial Africa. By contrast, populist authoritarian regimes "are mobilizational regimes in which a strong, charismatic, manipulative leader rules through a coalition involving key lower-class groups".&lt;ref name="Gasiorowski"/&gt; Examples include [[Argentina]] under [[Juan Perón|Perón]],&lt;ref name="Gasiorowski"/&gt; Egypt under Nasser&lt;ref name="Gasiorowski"/&gt; and [[Venezuela]]  under [[Hugo Chávez|Chávez]] and [[Nicolás Maduro|Maduro]].&lt;ref&gt;Juan de Onis, [http://www.worldaffairsjournal.org/blog/juan-de-onis/after-chavez-authoritarianism-still-threatens-latin-america "After Chavez, Authoritarianism Still Threatens Latin America"], ''World Affairs'' (May 15, 2013): "the followers of the late President Hugo Chávez continue to apply the playbook of authoritarian populism throughout Latin America in their pursuit of more power...one of the Mercosur partners are challenging the basic political practices of authoritarian populism implanted in Venezuela."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kurt Weyland, [http://www.journalofdemocracy.org/article/latin-america%E2%80%99s-authoritarian-drift-threat-populist-left "Latin America's Authoritarian Drift: The Threat from the Populist Left"], ''[[Journal of Democracy]]'', Vol. 23, Issue 3 (July 2013), pp. 18–32.&lt;/ref&gt;

Authoritarianism is characterized by highly concentrated and [[Centralized government|centralized]] power maintained by [[political repression]] and the exclusion of potential challengers. It uses [[Political party|political parties]] and mass organizations to mobilize people around the goals of the regime.&lt;ref name="Vestal"&gt;Theodore M. Vesta, ''[{{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=XWXtXOl56KkC&amp;c |page=17 }} Ethiopia: A Post-Cold War African State]''. Greenwood, 1999, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adam Przeworski]] has theorized that "authoritarian equilibrium rests mainly on lies, fear and economic prosperity".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Democracy and the Market: Political and Economic Reforms in Eastern Europe and Latin America|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Mfjv6snK0-EC&amp;pg=PA58&amp;lpg=PA58#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|publisher = Cambridge University Press|date = 1991-07-26|isbn = 9780521423359|first = Adam|last = Przeworski}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Authoritarianism also tends to embrace the informal and unregulated exercise of [[Power (politics)|political power]], a leadership that is "self-appointed and even if elected cannot be displaced by citizens' free choice among competitors", the arbitrary deprivation of [[civil liberties]] and little tolerance for meaningful [[Opposition (politics)|opposition]].&lt;ref name="Vestal"/&gt;

A range of [[social control]]s also attempt to stifle [[civil society]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hsu|first=Jennifer Y. J.|last2=Hsu|first2=Carolyn L.|last3=Hasmath|first3=Reza|date=2016|title=NGO Strategies in an Authoritarian Context, and their Implications for Citizenship: The Case of the People's Republic of China|ssrn=2657187|journal=|location=|publisher=American Sociological Association Annual Meeting (Seattle), August 20–23.|volume=|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; while political stability is maintained by control over and support of the [[military|armed forces]], a bureaucracy staffed by the regime and creation of [[allegiance]] through various means of [[socialization]] and indoctrination.&lt;ref name="Vestal"/&gt;

Authoritarian political systems may be weakened through "inadequate performance to demands of the people".&lt;ref name="Vestal"/&gt; Vestal writes that the tendency to respond to challenges to authoritarianism through tighter control instead of [[adaptation]] is a significant weakness and that this overly rigid approach fails to "adapt to changes or to accommodate growing demands on the part of the populace or even groups within the system".&lt;ref name="Vestal"/&gt; Because the [[legitimacy (political)|legitimacy]] of the state is dependent on performance, authoritarian states that fail to adapt may collapse.&lt;ref name="Vestal"/&gt;

Authoritarianism is marked by "indefinite political tenure" of the ruler or [[ruling party]] (often in a [[one-party state]]) or other authority.&lt;ref name="Vestal"/&gt; The transition from an authoritarian system to a more [[Democracy|democratic]] form of government is referred to as [[democratization]].&lt;ref name="Vestal"/&gt;

John Duckitt suggests a link between authoritarianism and [[collectivism]], asserting that both stand in opposition to [[individualism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Duckitt | first1 = J. | title = Authoritarianism and Group Identification: A New View of an Old Construct | jstor = 3791588 | journal = Political Psychology | volume = 10 | issue = 1 | pages = 63–84 | year = 1989 | doi = 10.2307/3791588  |registration=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; Duckitt writes that both authoritarianism and collectivism submerge [[individual rights]] and goals to group goals, expectations and [[Conformity|conformities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kemmelmeier | first1 = M. | last2 = Burnstein | first2 = E. | last3 = Krumov | first3 = K. | last4 = Genkova | first4 = P. | last5 = Kanagawa | first5 = C. | last6 = Hirshberg | first6 = M.

===Authoritarianism and totalitarianism===
{{Revolution sidebar}}

[[Totalitarianism]] is an extreme version of authoritarianism. Authoritarianism primarily differs from totalitarianism in that social and economic institutions exist that are not under governmental control. Building on the work of Yale political scientist Juan Linz, Paul C. Sondrol of the [[University of Colorado at Colorado Springs]] has examined the characteristics of authoritarian and totalitarian dictators and organized them in a chart:&lt;ref name="Sondrol"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1 = Sondrol |first1 = P. C. |title = Totalitarian and Authoritarian Dictators: A Comparison of Fidel Castro and Alfredo Stroessner |journal = Journal of Latin American Studies |volume = 23 |issue = 3 |page = 599 |year = 2009 |doi = 10.1017/S0022216X00015868}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sondrol argues that while both authoritarianism and totalitarianism are forms of [[autocracy]], they differ in "key [[Dichotomy|dichotomies]]":
{{quote|(1) Unlike their bland and generally unpopular authoritarian brethren, totalitarian dictators develop a [[charisma]]tic "[[Cult of personality|mystique]]" and a mass-based, pseudo-democratic [[interdependence]] with their followers via the conscious manipulation of a prophetic image.
(2) [[wikt:concomitant|Concomitant]] role conceptions differentiate totalitarians from authoritarians. Authoritarians view themselves as individual beings largely content to control and often maintain the status quo. Totalitarian self-conceptions are largely [[Teleology|teleological]]. The [[tyrant]] is less a person than an indispensable function to guide and reshape the universe.

(3) Consequently, the utilisation of power for personal aggrandizement is more evident among authoritarians than totalitarians. Lacking the binding appeal of [[ideology]], authoritarians support their rule by a mixture of instilling fear and granting rewards to loyal collaborators, engendering a [[kleptocracy]].&lt;ref name="Sondrol"/&gt;|sign=|source=}}

Compared to totalitarianism, "the authoritarian state still maintains a certain distinction between state and society. It is only concerned with political power and as long as that is not contested it gives society a certain degree of liberty. Totalitarianism, on the other hand, invades [[private life]] and asphyxiates it".&lt;ref name="Cinpoes"&gt;Radu Cinpoes, ''Nationalism and Identity in Romania: A History of Extreme Politics from the Birth of the State to EU Accession'', p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; Another distinction is that "authoritarianism is not animated by utopian ideals in the way totalitarianism is. It does not attempt to change the world and human nature".&lt;ref name="Cinpoes"/&gt; [[Carl Joachim Friedrich]] writes that "a totalist ideology, a party reinforced by a [[secret police]], and monopoly control of ... industrial mass society" are the three features of totalitarian regimes that distinguish them from other autocracies.&lt;ref name="Cinpoes"/&gt;

===Authoritarianism and democracy===
{{Individualism sidebar}}
Authoritarianism and democracy are not fundamentally opposed to one another, as it is possible for democracies to possess authoritarian elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Frantz |first1=Erica |title=Authoritarian Politics: Trends and Debates |journal=Politics and Governance |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=87 |doi=10.17645/pag.v6i2.1498 |url=https://www.cogitatiopress.com/politicsandgovernance/article/view/1498|year=2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An [[illiberal democracy]] (or [[procedural democracy]]) is distinguished from [[liberal democracy]] (or [[substantive democracy]]) in that illiberal democracies lack features such as the [[rule of law]], protections for minority groups and an [[Judicial independence|independent judiciary]].&lt;ref&gt;
* Thomas H. Henriksen, ''American Power after the Berlin Wall'' (Palgrave Macmillan: 2007), p. 199: "experts emphasize that elections alone, without the full democratic panoply of an independent judiciary, free press, and viable political parties, constitute, in reality, illiberal democracies, which still menace their neighbors and destabilize their regions."
*  David P. Forsythe, ''Human Rights in International Relations'' (Cambridge University Press, 2012), p. 231: "Illiberal democracies may have reasonably free and fair national elections based on broad suffrage, but they do not counteract the tyranny of the majority with effective protections for ethnic and religious minorities or various types of dissenters."
* Rod Hague &amp; Martin Harrop, ''Political Science: A Comparative Introduction'' (7th ed.: Palgrave Macmillan: 2007), p. 259: "The gradual implementation of the rule of law and due process is an accomplishment of liberal politics, provide a basis for distinguishing liberal from illiberal democracies, and both from authoritarian regimes."
* Vladimir Popov, "Circumstances versus Policy Choices: Why Has the Economic Performance of the Soviet Successor States Been So Poor" in ''After the Collapse of Communism: Comparative Lessons of Transition'' (eds. [[Michael McFaul]] &amp; Kathryn Stoner-Weiss: Cambridge University Press, 2004), p. 20: "The least efficient institutions are in illiberal democracies combining poor rule of law with democracy ... Less democratic regimes with weak rule of law ... appear to do better than illiberal democracies in maintaining institutional capacity."&lt;/ref&gt;

A further distinction that liberal democracies have rarely made war with one another; research has extended the theory and finds that more democratic countries tend to have few wars (sometimes called [[militarized interstate dispute]]s) causing fewer battle deaths with one another and that democracies have far fewer [[civil war]]s.&lt;ref&gt;

Some commentators, such as [[Seymour Martin Lipset]], believed that low-income authoritarian regimes have certain technocratic "efficiency-enhancing advantages" over low-income democracies, helping authoritarian regimes generate development.&lt;ref name="Halperin"&gt;Morton H. Halperin, Joseph T. Siegle, &amp; Michael M. Weinstein, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=JiNLH1I50PkC The Democracy Advantage: How Democracies Promote Prosperity and Peace]'' ([[Council on Foreign Relations]]/Psychology Press, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Morton H. Halperin]], Joseph T. Siegle and Michael M. Weinstein (2005) counter this belief, arguing that the evidence has shown that there is no "authoritarian advantage" and that there is a "democratic advantage" instead.&lt;ref name="Halperin"/&gt; Halperin et al. argue that democracies "realize superior development performance" over authoritarianism. They point out that poor democracies are more likely to have steadier economic growth and less likely to experience economic and humanitarian catastrophes than authoritarian regimes; that civil liberties act as a curb on corruption and misuse of resources; and that democracies are more adaptable.&lt;ref name="Halperin"/&gt; Halperin point out that the vast majority of refugee crises and financial catastrophes occur in authoritarian regimes.&lt;ref name="Halperin"/&gt;

Studies suggest that several health indicators (life expectancy and infant and maternal mortality) have a stronger and more significant association with democracy than they have with [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] per capita, size of the public sector or income inequality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1 = Franco |first1 = Á. |last2 = Álvarez-Dardet |first2 = C. |last3 = Ruiz |first3 = M.

Research shows that the democratic nations have much less [[democide]] or murder by government. Those were also moderately developed nations before applying liberal democratic policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=R. J. Rummel |author-link=R. J. Rummel |title=Power kills: democracy as a method of nonviolence |publisher=Transaction Publishers |location=New Brunswick, New Jersey, United States U.S.A |year=1997 |isbn=978-1-56000-297-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Research by the [[World Bank]] suggests that political institutions are extremely important in determining the prevalence of [[Political corruption|corruption]] and that parliamentary systems, political stability and [[freedom of the press]] are all associated with lower corruption.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Lederman, Norman Loayza, &amp; Rodrigo Res Soares, [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=632777 "Accountability and Corruption: Political Institutions Matter"], World Bank Policy Research Working Paper No. 2708  (November 2001).&lt;/ref&gt;  One study has concluded that terrorism is most common in nations with intermediate [[political freedom]]. The nations with the least amount of [[terrorism]] are the most and least democratic nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Harvard News Office |url=http://www.news.harvard.edu/gazette/2004/11.04/05-terror.html |title=Harvard Gazette: Freedom squelches terrorist violence |publisher=News.harvard.edu |date=2004-11-04 |accessdate=2012-02-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150919050732/http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/2004/11.04/05-terror.html |archivedate=2015-09-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
===Systemic weakness and resilience===
[[Andrew J. Nathan]] notes that "regime theory holds that authoritarian systems are inherently fragile because of weak legitimacy, overreliance on coercion, overcentralization of decision making, and the predominance of personal power over institutional norms....Few authoritarian regimes—be they communist, fascist, corporatist, or personalist—have managed to conduct orderly, peaceful, timely, and stable successions".&lt;ref name="NathanAuthoritarian"&gt;Andrew J. Nathan, [https://muse.jhu.edu/article/38546/summary "Authoritarian Resilience"], ''Journal of Democracy'', 14.1 (2003), pp. 6–17.&lt;/ref&gt; One exception to this general trend is the endurance of the authoritarian rule of the [[Chinese Communist Party]], which has been unusually resilient among authoritarian regimes.  Nathan posits that this can be attributed to four factors: (1) "the increasingly norm-bound nature of its succession politics"; (2) "the increase in meritocratic as opposed to factional considerations in the promotion of political elites"; (3) "the differentiation and functional specialization of institutions within the regime"; and (4) "the establishment of institutions for political participation and appeal that strengthen the CCP's legitimacy among the public at large".&lt;ref name="NathanAuthoritarian"/&gt;

===Gender and authoritarianism===
According to a study by Brandt and Henry, there is a direct correlation between the rates of [[gender inequality]] and the levels of authoritarian ideas in the male and female populations. It was found that in countries with less gender equality where individualism was encouraged and men occupied the dominant societal roles, women were more likely to support traits such as obedience which would allow them to survive in an authoritarian environment and less likely to encourage ideas such as independence and imagination. In countries with higher levels of gender equality, men held less authoritarian views. It is theorized that this occurs due to the stigma attached to individuals who question the cultural norms set by the dominant individuals and establishments in an authoritarian society as a way to prevent the psychological stress caused by the active ostracizing of the stigmatized individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Mark J. |last=Brandt |first2=P. J. |last2=Henry |title=Gender Inequality and Gender Differences in Authoritarianism |year=2012 |journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin |volume=38 |issue=10 |pages=1301–15 |doi=10.1177/0146167212449871 |pmid=22733982 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

There is no precise definition of authoritarianism, but several annual measurements are attempted, including [[Freedom House]]’s annual [[Freedom in the World]] report.

===Current===
The following is a non-exhaustive list of examples of states which are currently (or frequently) characterized as authoritarian:

==Historical trends==
===Anti-authoritarianism===
{{Main|Anti-authoritarianism}}
Both [[World War II]] (ending in 1945) and the later [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union]] (1991) resulted in the replacement of authoritarian regimes by either democratic regimes or regimes that were less authoritarian.

[[World War II]] saw the defeat of the [[Axis powers]] by the [[Allies of World War II|Allied powers]]. All the Axis powers — [[Nazi Germany]], Fascist Italy and the [[Empire of Japan]] — had totalitarian or authoritarian governments, and two of the three were replaced by governments based on democratic constitutions. The [[Allies of World War II|Allied powers]] were an alliance of Democratic states and (later) the Communist [[Soviet Union]]. At least in Western Europe the initial post-war era embraced pluralism and freedom of expression in areas that had been under control of authoritarian regimes.  The memory of fascism and nazism was denigrated. The new [[Federal Republic of Germany]] banned its expression.  In reaction to the centralism of the Nazi state, for example, the new constitution of West Germany ([[Federal Republic of Germany]]) exercised "[[separation of powers]]" and  placed "[[Law enforcement in Germany|law enforcement]] firmly in the hands" of the sixteen ''[[States of Germany|Länder]]'' or states of the republic, not with the federal German government (at least not at first).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bmi.bund.de/EN/topics/security/federal-police/federal-police-node.html The Federal Police]. Federal Ministry of the Interior, Building and Community of Germany&lt;/ref&gt;

Culturally there was also a strong sense of anti-authoritarianism based on [[anti-fascism]] in Western Europe. This was attributed to the active resistance from [[German-occupied Europe|occupation]] and to fears arising from the development of [[superpower]]s.&lt;ref name="swcjsb"&gt;{{cite book |title=Sign Wars: The Culture Jammers Strike Back! |last=Cox |first=David |year=2005 |publisher=LedaTape Organisation |isbn=978-0-9807701-5-5 |page=108 |url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=zKo8DrmamAwC |page= }} |accessdate=22 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anti-authoritarianism also became associated with [[countercultural]] and [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] movements such as the [[Beat Generation]] in the 1950s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/americannovel/timeline/beatgeneration.html|title=Retired Site PBS Programs |website=pbs.org|accessdate=4 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[hippies]] in the 1960s&lt;ref name="Stonepolitics"&gt;"The way of the hippie is antithetical to all repressive hierarchical power structures since they are adverse to the hippie goals of peace, love and freedom&amp;nbsp;... Hippies don't impose their beliefs on others. Instead, hippies seek to change the world through reason and by living what they believe."{{harvnb|Stone|1994|loc=[http://www.hipplanet.com/books/atoz/sex.htm "The Way of the Hippy"]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Punk subculture|punk]]s in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = McLaughlin | first = Paul | title = Anarchism and Authority | publisher = Ashgate | location = Aldershot | year = 2007 | isbn = 978-0-7546-6196-2 | page = 10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In South America, Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay, Chile and Uruguay moved away from dictatorships to democracy between 1982 and 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The challenge of the past |journal=The Economist |date=22 October 1998 |url=https://www.economist.com/the-americas/1998/10/22/the-challenge-of-the-past |accessdate=17 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]] in 1989 and [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|Soviet Union]] in [[1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt|1991]], the other authoritarian/totalitarian "half" of the Allied Powers of WWII collapsed. This led not so much to revolt against authority in general, but to the belief that authoritarian states (and state control of economies) were outdated. 
&lt;ref name="Tharoor-wapo-2017"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Tharoor |first1=Ishaan |title=The man who declared `the end of history` fears for democracy's future |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2017/02/09/the-man-who-declared-the-end-of-history-fears-for-democracys-future/?noredirect=on |accessdate=4 October 2018 |agency=Washington Post |date=9 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The idea that "liberal democracy was the final form toward which all political striving was directed",&lt;ref name="Ignatieff-nyrb"/&gt; became very popular in Western countries and was celebrated in [[Francis Fukuyama]]'s book ''[[The End of History and the Last Man]]''.&lt;ref name="Ignatieff-nyrb"/&gt; According to Charles H. Fairbanks, Jr., "all the new states that stumbled out of the ruins of the Soviet bloc, except Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan, seemed indeed to be moving toward democracy in the early 1990s," as where the countries of East Central Europe and the Balkans.&lt;ref name="causes-2014"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Fairbanks, Jr. |first1=Charles H. |title=Causes of Authoritarianism in the Former Soviet Republics |url=https://ge.boell.org/en/2014/01/16/causes-authoritarianism-former-soviet-republics |website=Heinrich Boell Stiftung |accessdate=5 October 2018 |date=16 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2010, the "[[Arab Spring]]" arose in response to unrest over economic stagnation but also in opposition to oppressive authoritarian regimes, first in [[Tunisia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2011/01/19/uk-tunisia-protests-bouaziziidUKTRE70I7TV20110119|title=Peddler’s martyrdom launched Tunisia’s revolution.

Regimes were toppled in  [[Tunisia]] [[Libya]], [[Egypt]], and [[Yemen]], and other countries saw riots, civil wars or insurgencies.&lt;ref name="NYRB-Ruthven"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ruthven|first1=Malise|title=How to Understand ISIS|journal=New York Review of Books|date=23 June 2016|volume=63|issue=11|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2016/06/23/how-to-understand-isis/|accessdate=12 June 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160807014415/http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2016/06/23/how-to-understand-isis/|archivedate=7 August 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Authoritarian revival===
From 2005 to 2015 observers noted what some called a "democratic recession"&lt;ref name="Ignatieff-nyrb"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ignatieff |first1=Michael |title=Are the Authoritarians Winning? |journal=New York Review of Books |date=10 July 2014 |accessdate=4 October 2018 |url=https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2018/06/28/hitlers-rise-it-can-happen-here/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Levitsky-myth"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Levitsky |first1=Steven |last2=Way |first2=Lucan |title=The Myth of Democratic Recession |journal=Journal of Democracy |date=January 2015 |volume=26 |issue=1 |pages=45–58 |accessdate=4 October 2018 |url=https://www.journalofdemocracy.org/sites/default/files/Levitsky-26-1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; (although some — Steven Levitsky and Lucan Way — have disputed this theory).&lt;ref name="Levitsky-myth"/&gt; 
In 2018 [[Freedom House]] declared that from 2006 to 2018, "113 countries" around the world showed "a net decline" in "political rights and civil liberties" while "only 62" experienced "a net improvement."&lt;ref name="FH-2018"&gt;{{cite web |title=Freedom in the World 2018 Democracy in Crisis |url=https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/freedom-world-2018 |website=Freedom House |accessdate=4 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in 2018, U.S. political journalist David Frum stated: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;The hopeful world of the very late 20th century—the world of [[NAFTA]] and an expanding [[NATO]]; of the World Wide Web 1.0 and liberal interventionism; of the global spread of democracy under leaders such as [[Václav Havel]] and [[Nelson Mandela]]—now looks battered and delusive."&lt;ref name="Frum-liberalism"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Frum |first1=David |title=The Republican Party Needs to Embrace Liberalism |journal=Atlantic |date=November 2018 |accessdate=4 October 2018 |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/11/the-case-for-liberal-republicanism/570790/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[Michael Ignatieff]] wrote that Fukuyama's idea of liberalism vanquishing authoritarianism "now looks like a quaint artifact of a vanished unipolar moment",&lt;ref name="Ignatieff-nyrb"/&gt; and Fukuyama himself expressed concern.&lt;ref name="Tharoor-wapo-2017"/&gt;  By 2018 only one Arab Spring uprising — in Tunisia — resulted in a transition to constitutional democratic governance,&lt;ref name="NYRB-Ruthven"/&gt; and a "resurgence of authoritarianism and [[Islamic extremism]]" in the region&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Yun Ru Phua |url=http://bpr.berkeley.edu/2015/03/30/after-every-winter-comes-spring-tunisias-democratic-flowering/ |title=After Every Winter Comes Spring: Tunisia’s Democratic Flowering – Berkeley Political Review |publisher=Bpr.berkeley.edu |date= |accessdate=2017-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; was dubbed the "[[Arab Winter]]".&lt;ref name=telegraph&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/9753123/Middle-East-review-of-2012-the-Arab-Winter.html |title=Middle East review of 2012: the Arab Winter | work = The Telegraph |accessdate=July 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| publisher = The Jerusalem Post | url = http://www.jpost.com/Middle-East/Analysis-Arab-Winter-is-coming-to-Baghdad-359348 |title = Analysis: Arab Winter is coming to Baghdad | work = The Telegraph | accessdate = October 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2014/April/Expert-Warns-of-Americas-Coming-Arab-Winter/ |title=Expert Warns of America's Coming 'Arab Winter' |publisher=CBN |accessdate=October 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-arab-winter |title= The Arab Winter|work= The New Yorker | accessdate = October 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.spu.edu/about-spu/news/articles/2014/may/arab-spring |title= Arab Spring or Arab Winter?| publisher= The New Yorker | accessdate= October 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Explanations offered for the new spread of authoritarianism by supporters include excessive immigration into European and Western countries, and the "primary and existential fear" of the "surrender" by liberal democracy of "national sovereignty and independence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=BUCHANAN |first1=PATRICK J. |title=Why the Authoritarian Right is on the Rise, |url=https://www.theamericanconservative.com/buchanan/why-the-authoritarian-right-is-on-the-rise/ |website=American Conservative |accessdate=4 October 2018 |date=April 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others credit  the downside of globalization,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Bhagavan |first1=Manu |title=We are witnessing the rise of global authoritarianism on a chilling scale |url=https://qz.com/643497/we-are-witnessing-the-rise-of-global-authoritarianism-on-a-chilling-scale/ |website=Qz.com |accessdate=4 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the success of the [[Beijing Consensus]], i.e. the authoritarian model of the [[People's Republic of China]].&lt;ref name="Cowen-2017-success"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Cowen |first1=Tyler |title=China's Success Explains Authoritarianism's Allure |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-04-03/china-s-success-explains-authoritarianism-s-allure?cmpid%3D=socialflow-twitter-view |website=Bloomberg |accessdate=4 October 2018 |date=April 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In at least one country, (the U.S.) factors blamed for the  growth of authoritarianism include the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2008]] and slower real wage growth;&lt;ref name="Cowen-2017-why"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Cowen |first1=Tyler |title=Why is authoritarianism on the rise? |url=https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2017/04/why-is-authoritarianism-on-the-rise.html |website=marginalrevolution.com |accessdate=4 October 2018 |date=4 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and social media's elimination of "gatekeepers" of knowledge, so that a large fraction of the population considers to be opinion what were once "viewed as verifiable facts” – everything from the danger of global warming to the preventing the spread of disease through vaccination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Can it Happen Here? review: urgent studies in rise of authoritarian America (Review of Cass Sunstein book ''Can It Happen Here?: Authoritarianism in America'') |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/apr/07/can-it-happen-here-review-trump-republicans-authoritarian-america-fascism |website=The Guardian |accessdate=4 October 2018 |date=8 Apr 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Buddhist Digital Resource Center''' (BDRC) is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization dedicated to seeking out, preserving, organizing, and disseminating Buddhist literature. Joining digital technology with scholarship, BDRC ensures that the ancient wisdom and cultural treasures of the [[Buddhist]] literary tradition are not lost, but are made available for future generations. BDRC is committed to seeking out, preserving, organizing, and disseminating Buddhist literature. Current programs focus on the preservation of texts in [[Pali]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Sanskrit]], and [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan]].

==History==
In 2017, [[Tibetan Buddhist Resource Center|TBRC]] announced the expansion of institutional mission to include the preservation of texts in languages beyond [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan]], including [[Sanskrit]], [[Pali]] and [[Chinese language|Chinese]]. To reflect this expansion, they have officially changed organizational name from [[Tibetan Buddhist Resource Center]] (TBRC) to Buddhist Digital Resource Center (BDRC). In 2017, BDRC will begin preserving and making accessible texts in languages beyond Tibetan, starting with [[Pali]], [[Sanskrit]], and [[Chinese language|Chinese]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.tbrc.org/?locale=bo#!footer/news/20170210 Introducing Buddhist Digital Resource Center (BDRC)]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Casal Rotondo''' is the largest tomb on the [[Appian Way]], to the southeast of [[Rome]], [[Italy]]. A small farmhouse has been constructed on the top.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pleiades.stoa.org/places/422869 |title=Places: 422869 (Casal Rotondo) |author1=Quilici, L. |author2=S. Quilici Gigli, DARMC |author3=R. Talbert, S. Gillies |author4=T. Elliott, J. Becker |accessdate=March 14, 2013 &lt;!-- 3:16 pm --&gt;  |publisher=Pleiades}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The structure is found at approximately the VIth mile of the ancient Appian Way.  The name comes from the fact that the tomb is round and because a farmhouse (casale) was built on the top in the Middle Ages, when it belonged to the [[Savelli family]] and was one of a system of watchtowers along the Appian Way. The mausoleum dates from around 30 B.C.  It is a large circular building with a diameter of 35 m, decorated with a frieze and, originally, had a cone-shaped roof. The base offered seats where travellers could rest out of the sun.  
Near the mausoleum, the archaeologist [[Luigi Canina]] (1795-1856) built a brick wall containing architectural fragments. These were originally thought to have been from the Casal Rotondo but this is now disputed.&lt;ref&gt;R.A. Staccioli “La Via Appia Antica”. Azienda di Promozione Turistica di Roma.&lt;/ref&gt; Canina deduced from a small piece of inscription with the name "Cotta" that the monument had been built by M. Aurelius Cotta Messallinus for his father, [[Marcus Valerius Messalla Corvinus]], but this inscription and other architectural fragments are now assumed to have come from a smaller monument at the site, and they may have nothing to do with Messalla Corvinus.&lt;ref&gt;L. Grifi, "Sopra la iscrizione antica dell auriga scirto", Diss. del. Acc. Rom., Rome 1855, pp. 491ff. [http://www.summagallicana.it/lessico/m/Messalla%20Corvino.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M.

{{Expand Catalan|Cinema català|date=December 2014}}
[[File:PM 104091 E Ponts.jpg|thumb|Cinema Fantasio in Ponts]]
The term '''Catalan cinema''' encompasses film productions produced and acted preferably by people from the [[Països Catalans|Catalan Countries]]. In Spain, it is a subset of [[Spanish cinema]], and includes movies both in [[Catalan language|Catalan]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]].

The [[Catalan Academy of Cinema]] was created to recognize and support Catalan productions, and annually commemorates the best films with the [[Gaudí Awards]].

==History==
In the first 30 years of the 20th century a number of Catalan films were made; in 1931 the Catalan government, the Generalitat, was restored and in 1932 it set up a film committee which encouraged the making of the first Catalan feature films, in Barcelona and Valencia. In the early 1930s Barcelona had four large film studios and the film industry flourished in the city. After the war had ended the Nationalist government had a policy of centralisation and the suppression of regional nationalism which existed in Catalonia and in the Basque country. Film making continued in Barcelona but began to decline. As public use of the Catalan language was now prohibited no films could be made in the language. In 1965 it again became possible to make a Catalan version of a film; [[Armando Moreno]]'s ''Maria Rosa'' was made in Castilian and dubbed into Catalan; Moreno's wife, [[Nuria Espert]] played the title role. The film was of poor quality. 

[[File:La horda.png|thumb|"La horda" (1969)]]
The Institut de Cinema Català was founded in 1975 by a group of over 70 professionals from all areas of the cinema. It was divided into four sections: commissions for education, labour and production, distribution and exhibition, and the economic commission. The first films made were two documentaries by Francesc Bellmunt (''Canet rock'' and ''La nova cançò'') and ''[[La ciutat cremada]]'' by Antoni Riba. In the mid 1970s there also existed in Catalonia some groups of "alternative" film-makers, e.g. the Central del Corto.&lt;ref&gt;[[Vicente Molina Foix|Molina-Foix, V.]] (1977) ''New Cinema in Spain''. London: British Film Institute; pp. 25-27&lt;/ref&gt;

== Notable productions ==
*In Catalan (some of these also contain scenes in Spanish, due to the bilingual nature of the region):

'''Central Talent Booking''' is a [[New York City|New York]]-based [[booking agency]] with offices in [[Los Angeles]].  Since its founding in 1999, CTB has built its business primarily by finding [[celebrity]] and [[human interest]] talent for television programs, particularly [[talk shows]], though the company has regularly worked with [[publishers]], developers of [[web content]] and [[band (music)|music groups]].

==History==

Founded by Joanna Jordan in 1999, Central Talent Booking began in a small, home office after Jordan had spent five years working as the in-house booker at the [[Late Show with David Letterman]]. According to a ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' article, when Jordan told Late Show executives of her plans to start her own company, they offered her their business as the company's first client.&lt;ref&gt;Siegel, Tatiana. "Niche-Oriented." Hollywood Reporter 12 Dec 2005 &lt;http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1001614834&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  CTB booked guests for two of the Late Show's [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Variety, Music or Comedy Series|Emmy]]-award winning seasons, in addition to three others won while Jordan and other CTB staffers were still working for Letterman.

CTB continued to grow well into the 21st Century, picking up business from runaway hits such as [[Punk'd]] and [[Best Week Ever]], and by 2007 ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' was already calling Jordan "one of the industry's premier bookers."&lt;ref&gt;Siegel, Tatiana. "Booking talkshows spawn rigid rules." Variety 5 Oct 2007 &lt;http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117973524.html?categoryid=1019&amp;cs=1&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

CTB has also been noted by industry observers for raising the profile of one of the company's bigger clients, [[Jimmy Kimmel Live!]] In a 2008 article, [[TV Guide]] referred to Jordan as the "force behind" the [[Jimmy Kimmel Live!#"I'm Fucking Ben Affleck" video|'I'm F-ing Ben Affleck' video]],&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, Zoë. "She's Booking Ben Affleck!". TV Guide 6 June 2008: 36.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- Can't find a URL for the article, but here's a link to a scan of it: https://www.flickr.com/photos/49429632@N03/4535619880/--&gt; and in the same article Kimmel quipped, "I wish I'd had her in high school when I was looking for a date to the prom."

[[Image:Inferno Canto 6 lines 49-52.jpg|thumb|Dante meets Ciacco. Engraving by [[Gustave Doré]]]]   
'''''Ciacco''''' {{IPA-it|ˈtʃakko|}} is one of the characters in the ''[[Divine Comedy]]'' by [[Dante Alighieri]] that were not yet well defined by historians. This is how he presents himself to Dante when he is in [[Inferno (Dante)|Hell]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
«Voi cittadini mi chiamaste Ciacco;
per la dannosa colpa de la gola,
come tu vedi, a la pioggia mi fiacco.»

«Ye citizens were wont to call me Ciacco;
For the pernicious sin of gluttony,
I, as thou seest, am battered by this rain.»

''(Inferno, VI, 52-54)''
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This way introducing himself allows us to interpret it in various ways, but one of the oldest commentators of the Comedy suggests a derogatory nature of this name: "Ciacco is said to be a pig's name, hence he was called this way for his gluttony."

[[Giovanni Boccaccio]] makes of Ciacco eighth story of the ninth day of the ''[[Decameron]]'', describing him as "the most gluttonous fellow that ever lived."&lt;ref&gt;558&lt;/ref&gt; However, the reference to Ciacco's name is somewhat ambiguous: he is referred to as the man "whom everyone called Ciacco."&lt;ref&gt;558&lt;/ref&gt; It is hard to say if Boccaccio had sources for his writings aside from Dante, because this name has not been found in literature before Dante. According to Vittorio Sermonti, a scholar dedicated to the study of the Comedy, the hypothesis that this Ciacco is the poet Ciacco dell'Anguillara is not true{{fact|date=August 2017}}.

'''Cultural Bolshevism''' (German: ''Kulturbolschewismus''), sometimes referred to specifically as "'''art Bolshevism'''" or "'''music Bolshevism'''",&lt;ref&gt;Spotts, Frederic. ''Hitler and the Power of Aesthetics''. Woodstock, New York: Overlook Press (2002). pp.18;24. {{ISBN|1-58567-345-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a term widely used by critics in [[Nazi Germany]] to denounce [[modernism|modernist]] movements in the arts, particularly when seeking to discredit more [[nihilism|nihilistic]] forms of expression. This first became an issue during the 1920s in [[Weimar Republic|Weimar Germany]]. German artists such as [[Max Ernst]] and [[Max Beckmann]] were denounced by [[Adolf Hitler]], the [[Nazi Party]] and other [[right-wing]] [[nationalism|nationalists]] as "cultural Bolsheviks".

== History ==
The development of [[modern art]] at the beginning of the 20th century &amp;ndash; but with roots going back to the 1860s &amp;ndash; denoted a revolutionary divergence from traditional artistic values to ones based on the personal perceptions and feelings of the artists.  This rejection of traditional authority &amp;ndash; intimately linked to the [[Industrial Revolution]] and the advance of [[democracy]] as the preferred form of government &amp;ndash; was exhilarating to some, but extremely threatening to others, as it took away the security they felt under the old order, and the very cohesiveness of [[Western culture]] and civilization appeared to be in peril.&lt;ref&gt;Janson, H.W. and Janson, Anthony F. ''History of Art'' New York: Harry N. Abrams, 1991. p.615 {{ISBN|0-8109-3401-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The modernist break occurred at around the same time as the [[October Revolution]] in Russia, and it was perhaps natural that those who felt threatened by the new artistic viewpoint would associate it with the group that came out on top after that revolution, the [[Bolshevism|Bolsheviks]] with their [[Marxist–Leninist]] political philosophy. In reality, the connection between the modernism and Bolshevism was extremely tenuous, and primarily a matter of both existing at the same unsettled time in European history.  Still, some artists in [[Western Europe]] drew inspiration from revolutionary ideals, to the extent that [[Dada]]ist [[Richard Huelsenbeck]] confidently declared in 1920 that Dada was a "German Bolshevist affair."&lt;ref name="CanningBarndt2013"&gt;{{cite book|editor-last1=Canning|editor-first1=Kathleen|editor-last2=Barndt|editor-first2=Kerstin|editor-last3=McGuire|editor-first3=Kristin|last=Doherty|first=Brigid|title=Weimar Publics/weimar Subjects: Rethinking the Political Culture of Germany in the 1920s|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mXP9AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA53|year=2013|location=New York|publisher=Berghahn Books|isbn=978-1-78238-108-2|page=53|chapter=The Work of Art and the Problem of Politics in Berlin Dada}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The association of new art with Bolshevism circulated in right-wing and nationalist discourse in the following years; it was, for example, the subject of a chapter in [[Adolf Hitler]]'s ''[[Mein Kampf]]''. Amid [[Hitler's rise to power]] the Nazis denounced a number of contemporary styles as "cultural Bolshevism," notably [[abstract art]] and [[Bauhaus]] architecture. After seeing a colleague beaten by Nazi supporters for comments sympathetic to modern art, typographer [[Paul Renner]] published an essay against Nazi aesthetics titled "Kulturbolschewismus?" Around the same time, [[Carl von Ossietzky]] mocked the flexibility of the term in Nazi writings:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Cultural Bolshevism is when conductor [[Otto Klemperer|[Otto] Klemperer]] takes tempi different from his colleague [[Wilhelm Furtwängler|[Wilhelm] Furtwängler]]; when a painter sweeps a color into his sunset not seen in [[Lower Pomerania]]; when one favors birth control; when one builds a house with a flat roof; when a Caesarean birth is shown on the screen; when one admires the performance of [[Charlie Chaplin|[Charlie] Chaplin]] and the mathematical wizardry of [[Albert Einstein|[Albert] Einstein]]. This is called cultural Bolshevism and a personal favor rendered to Herr [[Stalin]]. It is also the democratic mentality of the brothers [[Heinrich Mann|[Heinrich and Thomas]]] [[Thomas Mann|Mann]], a piece of music by [[Paul Hindemith|[Paul] Hindemith]] or [[Kurt Weill|[Kurt] Weill]], and is to be identified with the hysterical insistence of a madman for a law giving him permission to marry his own grandmother.&lt;ref&gt;[[Carl von Ossietzky|von Ossietzky, Carl]] in ''Weltbühne'' ("World Stage") (21 April 1931) quoted in Deák, István [https://books.google.com/books?id=5g6cJNfRN0cC&amp;pg=PA2&amp;lpg=PA2&amp;dq=Cultural+Bolshevism+is+when+conductor+Klemperer+takes+tempi+different+from+his+colleague+Furtw%C3%A4ngler&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=EUnQY_axmJ&amp;sig=a63Fc6kqIdA_lfY0E39ghkUDiZc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAWoVChMI4c3nub6VxwIVA6QeCh2NtgtU#v=onepage&amp;q=Cultural%20Bolshevism%20is%20when%20conductor%20Klemperer%20takes%20tempi%20different%20from%20his%20colleague%20Furtw%C3%A4ngler&amp;f=false ''Weimar Germany's Left-wing Intellectuals: A Political History of the Weltbühne and Its Circle'']. Berkeley, California: University of California Press, 1968. p.2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Once in control of the government, the Nazis moved to suppress modern art styles and to promote art with national and racial themes.&lt;ref name="MichaudLloyd2004"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Michaud|first1=Eric|last2=Lloyd|first2=Janet|title=The Cult of Art in Nazi Germany|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QR_9T_8VLPAC|year=2004|publisher=Stanford University Press|location=Stanford|isbn=978-0-8047-4327-3|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various [[Weimar Germany|Weimar-era]] art personalities, including Renner, Huelsenbeck, and the Bauhaus designers, were marginalized.

==Literature==
{{Main|Literature of Algeria}}
[[File:Moufdi zakaria.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Moufdi Zakaria]], a 1908-1977 [[poet]] from the [[Algerian Revolution]].]]
Modern Algerian literature, split between [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and [[French language|French]], has been strongly influenced by the country's recent history. Known poets in modern Algeria are [[Moufdi Zakaria]], Mohammed Al Aid from the middle of the 20th century, and [[Achour Fenni]], [[Amar Meriech]] and Azrag Omar in the late 1980s. [[List of Algerian writers|Famous novelists]] of the 20th century include [[Mohammed Dib]], [[Albert Camus]], [[Kateb Yacine]], and [[Ahlam Mosteghanemi]], while [[Assia Djebar]] is widely translated. Among the important novelists of the 1980s were [[Rachid Mimouni]], later vice-president of Amnesty International, and [[Tahar Djaout]], murdered by an [[Islamist]] group in 1993 for his secularist views.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.frenchpubagency.com/?fuseaction=people.main&amp;pid=517 Tahar Djaout] French Publishers' Agency and France Edition, Inc. (accessed 4 April 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

In philosophy and the humanities, [[Jacques Derrida]], the father of [[deconstruction]], was born in [[El Biar]] in [[Algiers]], [[Malek Bennabi]] and [[Frantz Fanon]] are noted for their thoughts on [[decolonization]], [[Augustine of Hippo]] was born in [[Tagaste]] (modern-day [[Souk Ahras]]), and [[Ibn Khaldun]], though born in [[Tunis]], wrote the [[Muqaddima]] while staying in Algeria.

Algerian culture has been strongly influenced by [[Islam in Algeria|Islam]], the main religion. The works of the [[Senussi|Sanusi]] family in pre-colonial times, and of [[Emir Abdelkader]] and Sheikh [[Ben Badis]] in colonial times, are widely noted. The Latin author [[Apuleius]] was born in [[Madaurus]] (Mdaourouch), in what later became Algeria.

==Music==
{{Main|Music of Algeria}}
The [[Music of Algeria|Algerian musical]] genre best known abroad is ''[[raï]]'', a pop-flavored, opinionated take on [[folk music]], featuring international stars such as [[Khaled (musician)|Khaled]] and [[Cheb Mami]]. In Algeria itself, raï remains the most popular, but the older generation still prefer ''[[shaabi]]'', as performed by for instance [[Dahmane El Harrachi]]. While the tuneful melodies of [[Kabyle people|Kabyle]] music, exemplified by [[Idir]], [[Ait Menguellet]], or [[Lounès Matoub]], have a wide audience.

For more classical tastes, [[Andalusian classical music|Andalusi music]], brought from [[Al-Andalus]] by [[Morisco]] refugees, is preserved in many older coastal towns. For a more modern style, the English born and of Algerian descent, [[Potent C]] is gradually becoming a success for younger generations. Encompassing a mixture of folk, raï, and [[British hip hop]], it is a highly collective and universal genre.

Although {{cite web | url= http://algeria-raï.com/ | title=raï }} is welcomed and praised as a glowing cultural emblem for Algeria, there was time when raï’s come across critical cultural and political conflictions with Islamic and government policies and practices, post-independency. Thus the distribution and expression of raï music became very difficult. However, “then the government abruptly reversed its position in mid-1985. In part this was due to the lobbying of a former liberation army officer turned pop music impresario, Colonel Snoussi, who hoped to profit from raï if it could be mainstreamed.”&lt;ref&gt;Gross, Joan, David McMurray, and Ted Swedenburg. "Arab Noise and Ramadan Nights: Raï, Rap, and Franco-Maghrebi Identities." Diaspora 3:1 (1994): 3- 39. [Reprinted in The Anthropology of Globalization: A Reader, ed. by Jonathan Xavier and Renato Rosaldo.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, given both nations’ relations, Algerian government was pleased with the music’s growing popularity in France. Although the music is more widely accepted on the political level, it still faces severe conflictions with the populace of Islamic faith in Algeria.

===1910: a generation of precursors===

During the first half of the twentieth century, artists mainly recuperated models and patterns imported&amp;nbsp;– or imposed&amp;nbsp;– by an imperialist French power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bellido]|first=[dir. de la publication: Ramon Tio|title=Le XXe siècle dans l'art algérien : [exposition ... qui a eu lieu au Château Borély, Marseille, du 4 avril au 15 juin 2003, et à l'Orangerie du Sénat, Paris, du 18 juillet au 28 août 2003]|year=2003|publisher=Aica Press [u.a.]|location=Paris|isbn=978-2-950676-81-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As [[Edward Said]] argued in his book ''[[Orientalism]]'' in 1978, Algerian artists struggled with the perception and representations of Westerners. Almost a century after the conquest by the French, [[:fr:Azouaou Mammeri|Azouaou Mammeri]] (1886–1954), [[:fr:Abdelhalim Hemche|Abdelhalim Hemche]] (1906–1978), [[:fr:Mohammed Zmirli|Mohammed Zmirli]] (1909-1984), and [[:fr:Miloud Boukerche|Miloud Boukerche]] (1920–1979) were the first to introduce easel painting. They benefited from "breaches" in the educational system and were able to pursue a training in plastic arts. Even though they attempted to focus on the reality of Algerians' everyday routine, they were still to a certain extent incorporated in the orientalism movement.

The tradition of oriental illumination and [[Miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniature]] was introduced around the same period, through artists such as [[:fr:Mohammed Racim Mohamed Racim|Mohamed Racim]] (1896–1974) or [[:fr:Mohamed Temmam Mohamed|Mohamed Temman]](1915-1988). It is the two main expression of figuration in a country where popular abstract symbolic, Berberian or Arabic, are integrated mainly through architecture, furnitures, weaving, pottery, leather and metal workmanship.

How to reappropriate one's own history is a dynamic in Algerian contemporary art, reflecting on the deep social changes people experienced.

Artists attempt a successful introspective work in which the duality in terms of identity creates a dynamic that overcomes "orientalism" and exotism. The main stake is for the artist and the spectator to reappropriate a liberty of expression and interpretation.
Main artists of that period are: [[:fr:Miloud Boukerche|Boukerche]], [[:fr:Hacène Benaboura|Benaboura]], [[:fr:Ali Ali-Khodja|Ali Ali Khodja]], [[:fr:Bachir Yellès|Yelles]], or [[:fr:Baya (peintre algérienne)|Baya]].

===1930: a generation of founders===

The vast majority of the artists incorporate the thematic of the independence war, from those who lived it to the artists that use it as a legacy. Impregnated by all the artistic and ideological movements that marked the first half of the twentieth century, artists are concerned with the society they live in and denounce segregation, racism and injustice that divided communities of colonial Algeria.
A clear shift in operated from orientalism and exoticism: new themes such as the trauma and the pain appear, for instance in the portrait ''The Widow'' (1970) by [[M'hamed Issiakhem|Mohamed Issiakhem]].

"Art is a form of resistance as it suggests and makes visible the invisible, the hidden, it stands alert on the side of life".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bouayed|first=Anissa|title=L'art et l'Algérie insurgée : les traces de l'epreuve, 1954-1962|year=2005|publisher=ENAG editions|location=Alger|isbn=978-9961-623-93-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was also a time when Algerian artists start organizing themselves, through the National Union of Plastic Arts or UNAP (1963) for instance; artists such as [[M'hamed Issiakhem|Mohamed Issiakhem]] or  [[Ali Khodja]] were part of it.

===Non-figuration and "Painters of the Sign"===

[[:fr:Abdallah Benanteur|Abdallah Benanteur]] and [[Mohammed Khadda|Mohamed Khadda]] opened a path for [[abstract art|abstract]] (non-figurative) Algerian art. They were French since childhood and emigrated to France. They were followed by artists such as [[:fr:Mohamed Aksouh|Mohamed Aksouh]], Mohamed Louail, [[:fr:Abdelkader Guermaz|Abdelkader Guermaz]] and [[:fr:Ali Ali-Khodja|Ali Ali-Khodja]].
[[Mohammed Khadda|Mohamed Khadda]] wrote&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bernard|first=Michel-Georges|title=Khadda|year=2002|publisher=ENAG Editions|location=Alger|isbn=9789961623008|pages=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;  « If figurative painting appears as ''the norm'' in terms of expression, it is the result of an acculturation phenomenon». Artworks liberately figurative are a form of liberation in that sense, as literal representations do not seem to fully emerge from the cluster of [[exotism]] and [[orientalism]].

The "Painters of the Sign" are Algerian artists born in the 1930s who, at the beginning of the 1960s, found inspiration in the abstract rhythm of Arabic writing. The term "peintres du Signe" was coined by the poet [[Jean Sénac]] in 1970. He was hosting in  [[Algiers|Alger]] the  "Gallerie 54".  The first collective exhibition reunited [[:fr:Mohamed Aksouh|Aksouh]], [[Baya (artist)|Baya]], [[:fr:Abdallah Benanteur|Abdallah Benanteur]], Bouzid, [[:fr:Abdelkader Guermaz|Abdelkader Guermaz]], [[Mohammed Khadda|Khadda]], [[:fr:Jean de Maisonseul|Jean de Maisonseul]], [[Maria Manton]], [[Denis Martinez|Martinez]], [[:fr:Louis Nallard|Louis Nallard]] and [[:fr:Rezki Zérarti|Rezki Zérarti]]. He wrote in his presentation :  "In this gallery 54, which aims at being a gallery of research in permanent contact with the people, we have brought together artists, Algerian or having deep links with our country" "We can assert, with Mourad Bourboune, that our artists do not only exhume the devastated face of our Mother, but, in the midst of the Nahda (renewal), they build a new image of the Man and stare endlessly at his new Vision"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dugas|first=Jean Sénac ; textes réunis par Hamid Nacer-Khodja ; préface de Guy|title=Visages d'Algérie : Regards sur l'art|year=2002|publisher=Paris-Méditerranée|location=Paris|isbn=284272156X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aouchem===

Algerian artists reconnected with part of their historical and cultural legacy, especially the influence of [[Berber people|Berber]] culture and language. A great deal of attention was brought upon the Berber culture and identity revendications after the [[Berber Spring]] in 1988, and it impacted the cultural production.
[[Denis Martinez]] and [[Choukri Mesli]] participated in the creation of the group ''Aouchem'' (Tattoo), which held several exhibitions in Algiers and [[Blida]] in 1967, 1968 et 1971. A dozen artists, painters and poets decided to oppose the mainstream organization of art&amp;nbsp;– especially of figurative art, they believe to be represented by the UNAP, the National Union for Plastic Art. They opposed their policy of excluding many active painters.  According to its manifesto : "Aouchem was born centuries ago, on the walls of a cave of [[Tassili.]] It continued its existence until today, sometimes secretly, sometimes openly, according to fluctuations of history. (...) We want to show that, always magical, the sign is stronger than bombs".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aouchem manifesto|url=http://www.founoune.com/articles/?mode=detail&amp;id=554|accessdate=2013-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In spite of a surge of political violence following the war of independence, where the hegemony of the Arabic culture and language tended to overlap on the berberian culture, the plastic traditions of popular signs managed to maintain. Aouchem builds on this traditional legacy.

===Naivety and expressionism===

Since the 1980s, there has been a renewal and also a form of "naivety", trying to go past the trauma of the war and address new contemporary issues. [[Baya (artist)|Baya]] (1931–1998) is the example of a great Algerian success story.{{According to whom|date=September 2013}} Her work was prefaced by [[André Breton]] and exposed by [[Aimé Maeght|André Meight]] when she was still a teenager. She who has not known her mother as she was doubly orphaned by the age of 5, produced colorful watercolors with fake symmetries, questioning the figure of the Mother. She is part of the [[art brut]] movement.

Expressionism was dominated by [[M'hamed Issiakhem|Mohamed Issiakhem]], affectionately nicknamed "Oeil de lynx" (''lynx eye'') by his fellow writer [[Kateb Yacine]]. When he was 15, he had an accident with a grenade. Two of his sisters and his nephew died, his forearm had to be amputated. His personal drama resonates in work.  He expressed themes like grief and loss through the use of thick pastes and universal figures; as an echo of the hardships of the Algerian war, as well as the universal struggle of those silenced and oppressed.

===Renewal of visual arts===

Since the 1980s, a new generation of Maghrebi artists has arisen. A large proportion is trained in Europe. Artists locally and among the Diaspora explore new techniques and face the challenges of a globalized art market. They are bringing together various elements of their identity, marked by the status of immigrant of first or second generation.  They address issues that speak to the Arab world with an "outsider" lens. [[:fr:Kader Attia|Kader Attia]] is one of them. He was born in France in 1970.  In a large installation in 2007 called ''Ghost'', he displayed dozens of veiled figures on their knees, made of aluminum fold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://desgrange.over-blog.fr/article-kader-attia-la-puissance-du-vide-63565382.html|title=Kader Attia : la puissance du vide |accessdate=2013-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Adel Abdessemed]], born in [[Constantina]] in 1970, attended the [[École des Beaux-Arts]] in [[Algiers]], [[Algeria]] and then [[Lyon]], [[France]]. Through his conceptual artworks, he displays strong artistic statements using a wide range of media (drawing, video, photography, performance, and installation). In 2006, he exposed at the David Zimmer gallery in New York City. One of his artworks was a burnt car entitled ''Practice Zero Tolerance'', a year after [[2005 civil unrest in France|riots]] in France and in the midst of a resurgence of terrorist attacks since [[September 11, 2001]].
Katia Kameli [http://www.katiakameli.com/] also brings in the multiple aspects of her identity and environment, through video, photographs and installations.

'''Delta Chi Xi Honorary Dance Fraternity''' ('''ΔΧΞ'''), more commonly referred to as Delta Chi Xi, is a [[Coeducational|co-ed]] honorary [[Professional fraternities and sororities|professional]] fraternity and member of the [[Professional Fraternity Association]] organized to acknowledge academic excellence, serve the community, and share the art of dance among fellow students.&lt;ref name=purpose&gt;{{cite web|title=Our Mission &amp; Purpose|url=http://www.deltachixi.org/#!purpose|work=Delta Chi Xi|accessdate=1 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History == 
Delta Chi Xi Honorary Dance Fraternity, Inc. was founded in the [[UNCG School of Music, Theatre and Dance]] at the [[University of North Carolina at Greensboro]] on April 20, 2010. The organization was established as an Honorary Dance Society by Kara J. Wade, Jennifer R. Cheek, and Kristina M. Rogers and was officially founded by Kara J. Wade and Jennifer R. Cheek under the advising of UNCG Dance Department Faculty member Robin Gee. Later it was transformed from an Honors Society into an Honors Fraternity and then a Professional Fraternity.&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite web|title=Our History &amp; Foundation|url=http://www.deltachixi.org/#!history|work=Delta Chi Xi|accessdate=1 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Delta Chi Xi was officially incorporated on October 20, 2011 by the North Carolina Secretary of State, [[Elaine Marshall]]. On November 12, 2013 Delta Chi Xi was officially accepted into the [[Professional Fraternity Association]], making it the first and only fraternity for collegiate dance students in the association.

=== Founders ===
Delta Chi Xi was officially founded by Kara J. Wade, Jennifer R. Cheek, and Kristina M. Rogers under the guidance of Robin Gee. The fourteen original charter members were Jennifer Cheek, Whitleigh Cook, Molly Derrickson, Lauren Drake, Rebekah Gonzalez, Joy Kelly, Andrea Lalley, Ann Brady Lewis, Margaret Moncure, Meredith Shaver, Carrie Simpson, Kristi Townsend, Kara Wade, and Ruth Ward.

== Symbols ==
Delta Chi Xi's colors are [[Tyrian purple|royal purple]] and [[teal]]. Purple is symbolic of royalty, power, nobility, and ambition; it is also associated with wisdom and creativity. Teal represents sophistication, uniqueness, guidance and leadership.

The official symbol of Delta Chi Xi is a combined [[solar symbol|sun]] and [[spiral]] to represent the unity and connection between dance, service, and academics. The sun is depicted by a silhouette of a dancer in a 'C jump' pose with 14 spirals as sun rays to represent the 14 original charter members.

== Mission ==
The official Statement of Purpose of Delta Chi Xi:

'''Doenjang girl''' or '''Doenjang woman''' ([[hangul]]:된장녀) is a [[Satire|satirical]] [[expression (language)|expression]] used in [[South Korea]] "for their propensity to scrimp on essentials so they can over-spend on [[conspicuous consumption|conspicuous luxuries]]".&lt;ref name=maxfisher/&gt; These girls and young women are addicted to luxury and [[vanity]].&lt;ref name="hangukki"&gt;[http://sports.hankooki.com/lpage/newstopic/200702/sp2007021317041058770.htm 실사로 보는… '이것이 된장녀의 하루!'] The Hanguk 2007/02/13&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Hangul]] spelling is Doenjang Nyeo (된장녀).&lt;ref name="hangukki"/&gt;

The expression became popular on the [[Internet in South Korea]] in the early 2000s.

'''Fay Kee Bolee''' ({{lang-ur|{{Nastaliq|ف کی بولی}}}}, lit. ''Fay Language'') is a [[Language game (linguistics)|language game]] used by [[Urdu language|Urdu]]-speaking people in [[Pakistan]]. It can be regarded as a trivial [[substitution cipher]] and it is sometimes used by adults to converse in (perceived) privacy in the presence of children. It is close to games found in other languages such as [[Farfallino Alphabet|Farfallino alphabet]] ([[italian language|Italian]]), [[jeringonza]] ([[spanish language|Spanish]]/[[portuguese language|Portuguese]]), and [[Pig Latin]] ([[english language|English]]).

"''Fay''" ({{Nastaliq|ف}}), Urdu language Alphabet corresponding to the sound of ''F'' in English, can be replaced by most other consonants to form another variety. [[Pay ki Boli]] is another more complex variation of the language game.

==Rules==
The game is based on a simple substitution: adding an extra ''F'' before each vowel of a syllable. Insert ''fay'' in the middle of each syllable (usually before the vowel - splitting the syllable into two) in each word. In some monosyllabic words which would still be so obvious, "''yay''" ({{Nastaliq|ی}}), Urdu alphabet for ''Y'', iyfa
* kya (what) = kfya or kfy`yfa
* kis (which) = kfis
* ko  (to)  = kfo

'''''Ghost Light''''' is the second serial of the [[Doctor Who (season 26)|26th season]] of the British [[science fiction television]] series ''[[Doctor Who]]'', which was first broadcast in three weekly parts on [[BBC1]] from 4 to 18 October 1989.

The serial is set in a mansion house in [[Perivale]] in 1883. In the serial, Josiah Smith ([[Ian Hogg (actor)|Ian Hogg]]), a cataloguer of life forms who comes from another planet, seeks to assassinate [[Queen Victoria]] and take over the [[British Empire]].

==Plot==
{{needsattention|project=Doctor Who|type=plot|date=June 2017|
 {{Plot|episode|date=June 2017}}
}}
In 1883, the mansion house of Gabriel Chase in [[Perivale]] near London is under the control of the mysterious Josiah Samuel Smith, who has subjugated its occupants via [[brainwashing]]. The butler is a [[Neandertal|Neanderthal]] named [[List of Doctor Who henchmen#Nimrod|Nimrod]], while the other occupants include [[List of Doctor Who henchmen#Gwendoline|Gwendoline]], the daughter of the original owners of the house who have disappeared, and the night housekeeper [[List of Doctor Who henchmen#Mrs Pritchard|Mrs Pritchard]].

Thousands of years in the past, an alien expedition came to Earth to catalogue all life on the planet. After completing its task and collecting some samples which included Nimrod, a being known as Light, the leader, went into slumber. By 1881 Josiah Smith gained control and kept Light in hibernation and imprisoned the creature known as Control on the ship, which is now the cellar of the house. Smith began evolving into the era's dominant life-form – the [[Victorian era|Victorian]] gentleman – and also took over the house. By 1883, Smith, having "evolved" into forms approximating a human and casting off his old husks as an insect would, managed to lure and capture the explorer Redvers Fenn-Cooper within his den. Utilising Fenn-Cooper's association with [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]], he plans to get close to her so that he can assassinate her and subsequently take control of the [[British Empire]].

The TARDIS arrives at Gabriel Chase. It turns out that [[Ace (Doctor Who)|Ace]] had visited the house in 1983 and had felt an evil presence, and the [[Seventh Doctor]]'s curiosity drives him to seek the answers. The Doctor encounters Control, which has now taken on human form, and makes a deal with it. The Doctor helps it release Light. Once awake, Light is displeased by all the change that has occurred on the planet while he was asleep. While Light tries to make sense of all the change, Smith tries to keep his plan intact, but events are moving beyond his control. As Control tries to "evolve" into a Lady, and Ace tries to come to grips with her feelings about the house, the Doctor himself tries to keep the upper hand in all the events that have been set in motion. The Doctor finally convinces Light of the futility of opposing evolution, which causes him to overload and dissipate into the surrounding house. Also, Control's complete evolution into a Lady derails Smith's plan as Fenn-Cooper, having freed himself from Smith's brainwashing, chooses to side with her instead of him. In the end, with Smith taken captive on the ship, Control, Fenn-Cooper and Nimrod set off in the alien ship to explore the universe.

===Pre-production===
Working titles for this story included ''The Bestiary'' and ''Life-Cycle''.&lt;ref name="brief"&gt;{{Brief | id=7q | title=Ghost Light}}&lt;/ref&gt; As revealed in the production notes for the DVD release, the story was renamed ''Das Haus der tausend Schrecken'' (''The House of a Thousand Frights/Horrors'') upon translation into [[German language|German]].

The story evolved out of an earlier, rejected script entitled ''Lungbarrow''. It was to be set on [[Gallifrey]] in the Doctor's ancestral home and deal with the Doctor's past, but producer John Nathan-Turner felt that it revealed too much of the Doctor's origins. It was reworked to make both evolution and the idea of an ancient house central to the story. Marc Platt used elements of his original idea for his [[Virgin New Adventures]] novel ''[[Lungbarrow]]''.&lt;ref name="brief"/&gt;

===Production===
''Ghost Light'' turned out to be the final production of the series' original 26-year run, with the last recorded sequence being the final scene between Mrs Pritchard and Gwendoline. It was not, however, the last to be screened — both ''[[The Curse of Fenric]]'' and ''[[Survival (Doctor Who)|Survival]]'', both produced beforehand, followed it in transmission order.

===Cast notes===
Michael Cochrane and Frank Windsor had both previously appeared in ''Doctor Who'' alongside [[Peter Davison]]; Cochrane as Charles Cranleigh in ''[[Black Orchid (Doctor Who)|Black Orchid]]'' in [[Doctor Who (season 19)|Season 19]], while Windsor played Ranulf in ''[[The King's Demons]]'' in [[Doctor Who (season 20)|Season 20]]. Carl Forgione appeared in the final serial of the [[Jon Pertwee]] era, ''[[Planet of the Spiders]]''.

A novelisation of this serial, written by [[Marc Platt (writer)|Marc Platt]], was published by [[Target Books]] in September 1990.

In June 2011, an audiobook of the novelisation was released, read by Ian Hogg.

The script of this serial, edited by John McElroy, was published by Titan Books in June 1993. Marc Platt contributed a chapter, written especially for this book, which rectified the omissions from the transmitted story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Platt |first=Marc |authorlink=Marc Platt (writer) |editor-last=McElroy |editor-first=John |title=Doctor Who - The Scripts: Ghost Light |date=June 1993 |publisher=[[Titan Books]] |location=London |isbn=1-85286-477-X |pages=2, 5 |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Home media===
''Ghost Light'' was released on [[VHS]] in May 1994. A DVD release followed in September 2004, with many extended and deleted scenes included as bonus features.  However, unlike the situation with ''[[The Curse of Fenric]]'', these scenes no longer existed in broadcast quality as the master 625 line PAL colour videotapes containing the extra footage had been erased for reuse shortly after the story was broadcast, and were thus sourced from VHS copies, some with [[timecode]]s burnt-in, i.e. recorded permanently onto the picture. This made an extended edit, as had been prepared for the ''Curse of Fenric'' DVD release the previous year, impossible. This serial was also released as part of the [[Doctor Who DVD Files]] in Issue 96 on 5 September 2012.

'''[[Dance in China]]''' has a long recorded history. Some Chinese dances today, such as dancing with long sleeves, have been recorded at least as early as the [[Zhou dynasty]] (c. 1045–256 BCE).  The most important of the early dances served important ritual and ceremonial roles and are known as ''[[yayue]]'' which continued to be performed in the imperial court until the [[Qing dynasty]]. A profusion of dances in popular and court entertainment as well as folk dances have been recorded in ancient texts.  The art of dance in China reached a peak during the [[Tang dynasty]] (618–907 CE) but declined later. In more recent times dance has enjoyed a resurgence and modern developments in Chinese dances are continuing apace.

==Early history==

Pictorial representations of dance have been found in Chinese pottery as early as the [[Neolithic]] period (before 2000 BCE), showing people dancing in a line holding hands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://114.255.205.171/english/tabid/549/Default.aspx?AntiqueLanguageID=3002 |title= Basin with design of dancers |work= National Museum of China }} Pottery from the [[Majiayao culture]] (3100–2700 BCE)&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest Chinese character for "dance", [[File:舞-oracle.svg|20px]], appears in the [[oracle bones]] and represents a dancer holding oxtails in each hand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The History of Chinese Dance |author= Wang Kefen|publisher= China Books &amp; Periodicals |page=7 |year= 1985 |isbn=978-0835111867}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''[[Lüshi Chunqiu]]'' (compiled around 239 BCE): "In former times, the people of the Getian clan (葛天氏) would dance in pairs [or threes] with oxtails in hand, stamping their feet and singing eight stanzas."&lt;ref name="aesthetic tradition"&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=d1eZuB2xwYwC&amp;pg=PA5&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=The Chinese Aesthetic Tradition |author= Zehou Li |page=5 |publisher= University of Hawaii Press |others=translated by Maija Bell Samei |year= 2009 |isbn=978-0824833077 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ctext.org/dictionary.pl?if=en&amp;id=23281  Lü Shi Chun Qiu] Original text: 昔葛天氏之樂，三人操牛尾，投足以歌八闋&lt;/ref&gt;

Primitive dance in ancient China was also associated with sorcery and shamanic ritual. An early shape of the Chinese character for sorcerer, ''[[Wu (shaman)|wu]]'' (巫), represented dancing shamans or their sleeves;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=701u-PHNAuMC&amp;pg=PT144&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=A Brief History of Qi |author= Yu Huan Zhang, Ken Rose |publisher= Paradigm Pubns |year= 2001 |isbn=978-0912111636 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''wu'' therefore described someone who danced as a mean of communication between gods and men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z-fAxn_9f8wC&amp;pg=PA454 |title= China: Five Thousand Years of History and Civilization |page=454 |publisher=City University of Hong Kong Press |year= 2007 |isbn= 978-9629371401 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many ancient records of shamans and sorcerers who danced, for example performing the rain dance at time of drought. The rain dance (舞雩, wǔyú) platform is mentioned in many ancient texts including the ''[[Analects]]'' of [[Confucius]].

Ancient Chinese texts such the ''[[Rites of Zhou]]'' (2nd century BCE) record dances of the early period. The most important of the Zhou dynasty dances are the six dances termed the "Great Dances" that were performed to venerate Heaven, Earth, gods, ancestors or legendary figures.  These six dances formed part of the system of court music and dance first established during the [[Western Zhou dynasty]] (1046–771 BCE) known as ''[[Yayue]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.chinaculture.org/gb/en_artqa/2003-09/24/content_38144.htm |title= Elegant Music Dance |work= ChinaCulture.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Music and dance were considered integral parts of a whole, each dance would have a piece of music associated with it; the word for music (樂, ''yue'') would therefore also refer to dance, and it may also be further extended to poetry as well as other art forms and rituals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CiQegTh99-wC&amp;pg=PA3 |title= Chinese Theories of Theater and Performance from Confucius to the Present |page=3 |editor= Faye Chunfang Fei |publisher=University of Michigan Press |year=2002 |isbn= 978-0472089239 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These six dances were said to have originated from the time of six historical or legendary figures:&lt;ref name="aesthetic tradition"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P3PehWwi6UAC&amp;pg=PA5&amp;lpg=PA5&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=中國音樂小史 |author= 許之衡 |year=1968}} Note some of alternate names given for these dances, such as Xianchi (咸池), Dashao (大韶), and Dazhang (大章)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VXEZAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT217#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=中国文化史速读 |authors=方士华 李天云|year= 2014 |publisher=青苹果数据中心 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Yunmen Dajuan'' (雲門大卷), from the [[Yellow Emperor]] era, performed for the veneration of the sky.
*''Daxian'' ([[:zh:大咸|大咸]], or ''Dazhang'' 大章), from the [[Emperor Yao]] era, for the veneration of the earth.
*''Daqing'' (大磬, or ''Dashao'' [[:zh:大韶|大韶]]), from the [[Emperor Shun]] era, for the veneration of Gods of the Four Directions, or the sun, moon, stars and seas. 
*''Daxia'' ([[:zh:大夏 (舞蹈)|大夏]]), in honour of [[Yu the Great]], for the veneration of mountain and rivers.
*''Dahu'' (大濩), from [[Tang of Shang]] dating to the end of the [[Xia Dynasty]], for the veneration of female ancestors.
*''Dawu'' ([[:zh:大武 (樂舞)|大武]]), in praise of [[King Wu of Zhou]], used for ancestral worship.

''Dashao'' (大韶) was a dance said to date from the time of [[Emperor Shun]] (the Neolithic epoch), the dancers may have dressed up as birds and beasts. One of the earliest documents, ''[[Shujing]]'', mentioned the ritual of "beating on the stones as all the wild animals dance".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Chinese Shadow Theatre: History, Popular Religion, and Women Warriors |author= Fan Pen Li Che |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aZu9Cje8TfkC&amp;pg=PA64&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |publisher=McGill-Queen's University Press |year= 2007 |page=64 |isbn=978-0773531970 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://ctext.org/shang-shu/yi-and-ji#n21105 |title=Shang Shu - Yu Shu - Yi and Ji |work= Chinese Text Project }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The performance of the dance was highly regarded by Confucius.

''Daxia'' was a dance performed in praise of [[Yu the Great]] of the [[Xia dynasty]], famous for his work on flood control. In this dance, 64 performers danced bare-chested wearing fur caps and white skirts. The movements of the dance may imitate the manual labour performed during flood control.&lt;ref name="kefen2"&gt;{{cite book |title=The History of Chinese Dance |author= Wang Kefen|publisher= China Books &amp; Periodicals |page=8 |year= 1985 |isbn=978-0835111867}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
These formal dances were divided into two types, civil and military. In a Civil Dance (文舞), dancers held item such as feather banners in their hand, and Military Dance (武舞) involved brandishing of weapons.&lt;ref name="dance"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.houstoncul.org/eng_culexg/c004.htm |title=The Art of Chinese Dance |work=Cultural Division, Taipei Economic &amp; Cultural Office in Houston }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Dawu'' was an important dance in six parts describing the military exploits of [[King Wu of Zhou]], and may involve martial elements such as the use of weapons.

Another six formed what was called the "Small Dances", to be performed by younger members of the aristocracy in minor ceremonies and sacrifice rituals. These are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ez2BL2Fq1EMC&amp;pg=PA192 |title=先秦史 |author= 劉寶才 |pages=192–193 |publisher=五南圖書出版股份有限公司 |year= 2002 |isbn=957-11-2888-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Five-Colour Silk Dance ([[:zh:帗舞|帗舞]]), performed for the worship of the Earth and Grain Gods.
*Feather Dance ([[:zh:羽舞|羽舞]]), as tribute to ancestral temples or the Gods of the Four Directions.
*Imperial Dance ([[:zh:皇舞|皇舞]]), performed as homage to the Gods of the Four Directions or as a rain dance.
*Yak-tail Banner Dance ([[:zh:旄舞|旄舞]]), performed at sacrificial sites in Biyong (辟雍), a seat of learning.
*Shield Dance (干舞), performed for military purpose or for the veneration of mountains and rivers.
*Dance of the People (人舞), performed in honour of the stars or ancestral temples.

All the dances involved dancers holding objects such as feather plumes, yak-tails or shield, except the Dance of the People which is focused on sleeve movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The History of Chinese Dance |author= Wang Kefen|publisher= China Books &amp; Periodicals |pages=12–13 |year= 1985 |isbn=978-0835111867}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aside from the formal and ritual dances, popular and folk dances are also mentioned in ancient texts. In the ''[[Book of Rites]]'', it is recorded that [[Marquis Wen of Wei]] expressed concerns about falling asleep during the measured and stately court performances and preferred the popular new music and dances of [[Wey (state)|Wey]] and [[Zheng (state)|Zheng]], though his Confucian advisor condemned these as decadent and disorderly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CiQegTh99-wC&amp;pg=PA7&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title= Chinese Theories of Theater and Performance from Confucius to the Present |pages=7–9 |editor= Faye Chunfang Fei |publisher=University of Michigan Press |year=2002 |isbn= 978-0472089239 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P3PehWwi6UAC&amp;pg=PA15&amp;lpg=PA15&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |page=15 |title=中國音樂小史 |author= 許之衡 |year=1968}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Spring and Autumn period|Spring and Autumn]] and [[Warring States period|Warring States]] periods, descriptions of professional dancing girls also appear in ancient texts. These may have been people from poorer family who visited and performed in the women's quarters in the palace or at houses of the nobles. Slaves had been kept as dancers since the [[Xia dynasty]].

==Qin and Han dynasties (221 BCE – 220 CE) ==
[[File:Nanjing Museum - Pottery figurines dancing and sitting.jpg|thumb|Han dynasty figurines showing dancers with long sleeves]]
During the Qin and Han dynasties, the imperial court established the ''yuefu'' (literally [[Music Bureau]]), which was responsible for collecting folk music and dance for performance at the court. A popular dance of the Han dynasty is the Long Sleeve Dance, which is depicted in many images and sculptures of the period, and this form of traditional dance survives to this day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7fxWKB9jijgC&amp;pg=PA131 |title= Chinese Theater: From Its Origins to the Present Day |author= Colin Mackerras |page=131 |publisher=University of Hawaii Press|edition= Reprint|year=1988 |isbn=978-0824812201 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The sleeve may be long and narrow, long and wide, or similar to the "water sleeves" ([[:Zh:水袖|水袖]], long flowing detachable silk sleeves extended at the wrist) used in [[Chinese opera]]. Historical texts also recorded that dancers danced bending at the waist while moving their sleeves.

Many dances of this period are mentioned in historical texts. In one account, a sword dance was said to have been performed by [[Xiang Zhuang]] at a banquet in an attempt to assassinate [[Emperor Gaozu of Han|Liu Bang]] (the founder of the [[Han dynasty]]) at the [[Feast at Hong Gate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=jMl4CDnGlqoC&amp;pg=PA78&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=The Road to the Throne: How Liu Bang Founded China's Han Dynasty |author= Hing Ming Hung |publisher=Algora Publishing |year= 2011 |isbn= 978-0875868370 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This event was also said to form the basis of the "Gong Mo"  Dance (公莫舞) – "Gong Mo", literally "Sir, Don't!", describes the blocking actions by [[Xiang Bo]] during the sword dance to prevent Xiang Zhuang from thrusting his sword towards Liu Bang.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YZo3AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA185&amp;lpg=PA185&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |author= W.L.

The dance is performed with a long scarf held in each hand, and is similar to today's Long Silk Dance. Liu Bang was also said to be fond of the war dance of the [[Ba (state)|Ba people]], called the ''Bayu'' (巴渝) dance and known in later eras in various names such as ''Zhaowu'' (昭武) in the [[Eastern Wu]] period and ''Xuanwu'' (宣武) during the [[Jin dynasty (265–420)|Jin dynasty]]. Large-scale performances of this dance involved brandishing weapons to the accompaniment of drums and songs in the Ba language.&lt;ref name="ta cheng"&gt;{{cite book |title=Ta Chʻeng, Great Perfection - Religion and Ethnicity in a Chinese Millennial Kingdom |author=Terry F.

[[File:CMOC Treasures of Ancient China exhibit - pictorial brick depicting acrobats.jpg|thumb|Acrobats and dancers depicted a tomb chamber in [[Chengdu]] dating to the [[Eastern Han dynasty]]. The dancer held in each hand long pieces of silk on rod.]]
Other dances of the period included the Drum Dance (鞞舞), Bell Dance (鐸舞), Sabre Dance, and mixed couple dance (對舞).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iGodMpTMEPUC&amp;pg=PA119&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Gateway to Chinese Culture |author=Fu Chunjiang |publisher=Asiapac |year= 2003 |isbn=978-9812293282 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fu Yi's (傅毅) ''Lyric Essay on Dance'' describes the Seven Tray Dance (七盤舞, also called Tray Drum Dance 盤鼓舞), a fusion of acrobatics and dance in which the dancer leaps gracefully between trays and drums on the trays, which gets faster as the dance progresses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.xiexingcun.com/shiciqupianqu/04/d016.htm 東漢·傅毅《舞賦》] Description by Zhang Heng as Recorded in Fu Yi's ''Lyric Essay on Dance''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cultural-china.com/chinaWH/html/en/29Arts445.html |title=Dance on Trays and Drums |work=Cultural China |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923211905/http://www.cultural-china.com/chinaWH/html/en/29Arts445.html |archivedate=2015-09-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Han dynasty, a popular form of entertainment is the variety show called ''baixi'' (百戲, or "hundred shows") that developed from the ''jiaodi'' (角抵, originally a form of wrestling game with men wearing horns) of the Qin Dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WAmiCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA5#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Women in Traditional Chinese Theater: The Heroine's Play |author= Qian Ma |isbn=9781461693956 |pages=5&amp;ndash;6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In such shows, various [[Chinese variety art]]s are performed, such as acrobatics, martial art, magic tricks, comic performances, music and dance.&lt;ref name="baixi"&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=YMT4U_abB6oC&amp;pg=PA104|title=Culture and Customs of China |author= Richard Gunde |page=104 |publisher= Greenwood |year= 2001 |isbn=978-0313361180 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Zhang Heng]] recorded various performances in his ''Lyric Essay on Western Capital'' (西京賦), describing dancers dressed as beasts, fish and dragons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CiQegTh99-wC&amp;pg=PA24&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title= Chinese Theories of Theater and Performance from Confucius to the Present |pages=24–25 |editor= Faye Chunfang Fei |publisher=University of Michigan Press |year=2002 |isbn= 978-0472089239 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One famous Han dynasty dancer is [[Zhao Feiyan]], a great beauty who rose from a humble beginning to become an Empress. She was named Feiyan or "Flying Swallow" after her slender figure and lithe dance steps, so light that she appeared to be quivering like a flower in the hand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=JWA2rkq2P9IC&amp;pg=PT142 |title=And Man Created God: Kings, Cults and Conquests at the Time of Jesus |author= Selina O'Grady |page=142 |publisher=Atlantic Books |year= 2012 |isbn=978-1843546962 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ctext.org/wiki.pl?if=en&amp;chapter=937219 |title= 《趙飛燕別傳》 |work=Chinese Text Project}} Original text: 趙後腰骨纖細，善踽步而行，若人手持花枝，顫顫然，他人莫可學也。&lt;/ref&gt; Professional dancers of the period were of low social status and many entered the profession through poverty, although some such as Zhao Feiyan achieved higher status by becoming concubines. Another dancer was Wang Wengxu ([[:zh:王翁須|王翁須]]) who was forced to become a domestic singer-dancer but who later bore the future [[Emperor Xuan of Han]].

==Six Dynasties era (220–589 CE)==
[[File:北齊彩繪舞樂俑.jpg|thumb|left|Figurines of dancers from the [[Northern Qi dynasty]].]]

In the [[Six Dynasties]] period, between the end of the Han dynasty and the beginning of the [[Sui dynasty]], there were pronounced influences from [[Central Asia]] on Chinese music and dance. Musical instruments such as the pear-shaped ''[[pipa]]'' and dances such as the [[lion dance]] may have been introduced in this period via Central Asia.&lt;ref name="chu yu-tun"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-Kg3AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA52&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=The Dramatic Oeuvre of Chu Yu-Tun: 1379 - 1439 |editor= Wilt L. Idema |page=52 |publisher=Brill |year=1985|isbn=9789004072916 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The music and dance of [[Kucha]] became popular, as did that of [[Western Liang (Sixteen Kingdoms)|Western Liang]] (in modern [[Gansu]] province), which may be an assimilation of styles from Han and other non-Han people. [[Emperor Wu of Northern Zhou]], who was of [[Xianbei]] origin, married a [[Türks (kök)|Turkic]] princess who also brought music and dances of Central Asia to China.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0SdXEVaFTJ0C&amp;pg=PA71&amp;lpg=PA71&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Dunhuang Art: Through the Eyes of Duan Wenjie |editor=Tan Chung |page=71 |publisher=Abhinav Publications |year=2002|isbn=978-8170173137 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This period saw civil wars as well as [[Wu Hu uprising|conflicts]] with the northern nomads (''[[Five Barbarians|Wu Hu]]''), resulting in the splintering of China into [[Sixteen Kingdoms|multiple states]] and [[Southern and Northern Dynasties|dynasties]] established by [[Han Chinese|Han]] and non-Han Chinese people. The imperial court of the [[Jin dynasty (265–420)]] was relocated to the south and many Han Chinese also migrated southwards due to pressure from the northern ''Hu'' tribes. This migration resulted in a fusion of the music and dance of the [[Central Plain (China)|Central Plains]] with those of the southern local traditions, producing a genre known as ''Qingshang'' (清商) music (later known simply as ''Qingyue'' 清樂).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_4G1JwZdl_MC&amp;pg=PA60&amp;lpg=PA60&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Sizhu Instrumental Music of South China: Ethos, Theory and Practice |author=Alan Robert Thrashe  |pages= 60–61 |publisher=Brill Academic Publishers |year= 2008 |isbn= 978-9004165007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the capital shifted to [[Jiankang]] (in present-day [[Nanjing]]), music and dance from the [[Wu (region)|Wu region]] in the lower Yangtze River became popular.  These dances included the Qianxi Dance (前溪舞), Qianxi being a village where performers once gathered to learn music and dance; the Whisk Dance (拂舞); White Ramie Dance ([[:zh:白紵舞|白紵舞]]); the Cup Tray Dance (杯槃舞); and the Mingjun Dance (明君舞), which tells the story of [[Wang Zhaojun]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CqLgOmwEPA4C&amp;pg=PA230 |title=魏晉南北朝文化史 |author= 萬繩楠 |pages=227–232 |publisher= 昭明|isbn=9789570336252 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sui and Tang dynasties (581–907 CE)==
[[File:Tang dancer.jpg|thumb|upright|A Tang dynasty dancer from a mural unearthed in [[Xi'an]] dancing with a shawl.]]

In the later part of the 6th century, [[Emperor Wen of Sui|Emperor Wen]] of the [[Sui dynasty]] ended the strife and division of China, and re-unified the country. The Sui dynasty collected the music and dance of the various peoples under its rule as well as popular music from outside China into the "Seven Books of Music" (七部樂), describing the music and dance of the Western Liang, [[Goguryeo|Korea]], [[Names of India#Tianzhu|India]], [[Bukhara]], Kucha, the ''Qingshang'' and the ''Wenkang'' (文康, a masked dance, later known as ''Libi'', 禮畢).

Later in the Sui dynasty, the music and dance of [[Kashgar|Shule]] and [[Samarkand]] were added to form the "Nine Books of Music", further expanded into ten during the reign of [[Emperor Taizong of Tang|Emperor Taizong]] in the [[Tang dynasty]], when ''Yanyue'' (燕樂, banquet music) and the music of [[Gaochang]] was added but ''Wenkang'' dropped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=z-fAxn_9f8wC&amp;pg=PA461&amp;lpg=PA461&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title= China: Five Thousand Years of History and Civilization |pages=461–462 |publisher=City University of Hong Kong Press |year= 2007|isbn=978-9629371401}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most popular of these were ''Qingshang'', Western Liang and Kuchan music.&lt;ref name=sharron/&gt;

These collections of dances performed at the imperial court show the diversity and cosmopolitan nature of the music and dance of the Tang dynasty: only the ''Yanyue'' and ''Qingshang'' music originated with the Han Chinese.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The History of Chinese Dance |author= Wang Kefen|publisher= China Books &amp; Periodicals |page=50 |year= 1985 |isbn=978-0835111867}}&lt;/ref&gt; Music and dance from India, Central Asia, Southeast Asia ([[Pyu city-states|Pyu]] and [[Kingdom of Funan|Funan]]) and other states bordering Tang China such as [[Tuyuhun]] and [[Kingdom of Nanzhao|Nanzhao]] were performed in the imperial capital [[Chang'an]] with performers and dancers in native costume.&lt;ref name="sharron"/&gt; The Tang imperial court gathered the top dancing talent of the country to perform a lavish dance that incorporated elements of the dance of China, Korea, India, Persia and Central Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KP57VXs-1-UC&amp;pg=PA89 |title=China: A Primary Source Cultural Guide |author= Gillian Houghton |page=89 |publisher=PowerPlus Books |isbn=978-1404229082 |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dunhuang Mogao Caves Dancer.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Dancer in mural from [[Mogao Caves]] performing perhaps the Whirling Dance where the dancers spin on a circular mat]]

Particularly popular were dances from Central Asia like the [[Sogdia]]n Whirling Dance ([[:zh:胡旋舞|胡旋舞]]) of Samarkand,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ugbWH-5OjegC&amp;pg=PA174i&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Multicultural China in the Early Middle Ages |author= Sanping Chen |pages=173–174 |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |year=2012 |isbn=978-0-8122-4370-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a dance involving rapid spinning (spinning dance moves are still found amongst the [[Uyghur people]] today).

Another very popular dance was the Mulberry Branch Dance (柘枝舞) from [[Tashkent]], that may be danced solo accompanied by rapid drumming, or as a duo whereby two girls first appeared hidden within a large lotus flower.  There was also a male solo dance called the [[Huteng|Barbarian Leap Dance]] (胡騰舞), described as the dance of a white-skinned people with high-bridged nose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=35L3Ww72M-YC&amp;pg=PA158&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Story of the Silk Road |author= Yiping Zhang |pages=158–159 |isbn=978-7508508320 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chnmuseum.cn/tabid/438/InfoID/80184/frtid/285/Default.aspx |title=胡腾舞 |work=National Museum of China }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=胡騰兒 (Pooem by Li Duan) |url=http://zh.wikisource.org/zh-hant/%E8%83%A1%E9%A8%B0%E5%85%92  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Tang dynasty]] was the golden age of Chinese music and dance. Institutions were set up to oversee the training and performances of music and dances in the imperial court, such as the Great Music Bureau (太樂署) responsible for ''yayue'' and ''yanyue'', and the Drums and Pipes Bureau (鼓吹署) responsible for ceremonial music.&lt;ref name=sharron&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ChyVgZMAiUoC&amp;pg=PA24 |title=A Cultural History of the Chinese Language|author= Sharron Gu |pages= 24–25 |publisher=McFarland |year= 2011 |isbn= 978-0786466498 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Emperor Gaozu of Tang|Emperor Gaozu]] set up the [[Royal Academy (China)|Royal Academy]], while [[Emperor Xuanzong of Tang|Emperor Xuanzong]] established the [[Pear Garden|Pear Garden Academy]] for the training of musicians, dancers and actors. There were around 30,000 musicians and dancers at the imperial court during the reign of Emperor Xuanzong,&lt;ref name="dillon"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VA5tKw11K8YC&amp;pg=PA225 |pages=224–225 |title=China: A Historical and Cultural Dictionary|first= Michael |last=Dillon|publisher=Routledge |date=24 February 1998|isbn= 978-0700704392  }}&lt;/ref&gt; with most specialising in ''yanyue''. All were under the administration of the Drums and Pipes Bureau and an umbrella organization called the Taichang Temple (太常寺).&lt;ref name="civilization"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z-fAxn_9f8wC&amp;pg=PA460&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title= China: Five Thousand Years of History and Civilization |pages=458–460 |publisher=City University of Hong Kong Press |year= 2007 |isbn= 978-9629371401 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Musical performances at the Tang court are of two types: seated performances (坐部伎) and standing performances (立部伎).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Treasures of Chang-an: capital of the Silk Road |page= 28 |publisher=Cultural Bureau of Shaanxi, Hong Kong Urban Council |year=1993 |isbn=978-9622151178 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Seated performances were conducted in smaller halls with limited number of dancers, and emphasised refined artistry. Standing performances involves numerous dancers, and were usually performed in courtyards or squares intended for grand presentations.

Standing performance pieces included The Seven Virtues Dance (七德舞), originally called "The Prince of Qin Breaks Through The Ranks" ([[:zh:秦王破阵乐|秦王破陣樂]]), celebrating the military exploits of [[Emperor Taizong of Tang|Emperor Taizong]] (previously known as the Prince of Qin before he became the Emperor).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yycr0r-OVcwC&amp;pg=PA148&amp;lpg=PA148&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=A Study of Yuan Zhen's Life and Verse 809--810: Two Years that Shaped His Politics and Prosody |author= Mei Ah Tan |pages=148–150 |publisher=ProQuest LLC |isbn= 9781243543646 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was performed with 120 dancers in gold-decorated armour with spears, but it can also be performed as a seated performance by four dancers in red silk robes.  Two other notable major dances of the Tang dynasty were the Blessed Goodness Dance (慶善舞, also called Nine Merits Dance, 九功舞), and The Supreme Original Dance (上元舞).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uNpVXm4F7JgC&amp;pg=PA24&amp;lpg=PA24 |title=Music from the Tang Court: Volume 6 |publisher= Cambridge University Press |year= 1985|editor= Laurence Picken |pages=24 |isbn=978-0521621007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gu Hongzhong 16.jpg|thumb|250px|Details from the [[Southern Tang]]/[[Song dynasty]] painting "Night Revels of Han Xizai" by [[Gu Hongzhong]], depicting the dancer Wang Wushan (王屋山) performing the Green Waist Dance from the Tang dynasty.  The dance was also called ''Liuyao'' (六么) as it is similar in pronunciation to Green Waist (''Luyao'', 綠腰).]]

Small-scale dances, performed during banquets and other occasions, may be divided into two categories: energetic dances (健舞), which are vigorous and athletic, and soft dances (軟舞), which are gentle and graceful. Energetic dances included those from Central Asia, such as Whirling Dance, Mulberry Branch Dance and the Barbarian Leap Dance. A well-known energetic dance is the Sword Dance, famously performed by Lady Gongsun ([[:zh:公孫大娘|公孫大娘]]),&lt;ref name="du fu"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uMeXsxG7nf4C&amp;pg=PA23&amp;lpg=PA23&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=DU FU: An Homage to |author= Jean Elizabeth Ward  |publisher=Lulu.com |year= 2008 |isbn= 978-1435714328}}&lt;/ref&gt; whose performance is reputed to have inspired the [[Cursive script (East Asia)|cursive]] calligraphy of [[Zhang Xu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.followtheblueflute.com/2013/02/du-fus-watching-lady-gongsuns-disciple.html |title=Du Fu's "Watching Lady Gongsun's Disciple Perform a Sword Dance"| author= Frank Watson |work=Follow the Blue Flute }}&lt;/ref&gt; Soft Dances included the Green Waist Dance (綠腰), a female solo dance.

Large scale performances at banquets with singers, dancers and musicians at the Tang court were called Grand Compositions (大曲). These developed from the ''Xianghe'' Grand Compositions (相和大曲) of the Han dynasty but became highly elaborate during the Tang dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ChyVgZMAiUoC&amp;pg=PA25&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=A Cultural History of the Chinese Language|author= Sharron Gu |pages= 25–28 |publisher=McFarland |year= 2011 |isbn= 978-0786466498 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A particularly renowned example is the Rainbow Skirt Feathered Dress Dance ([[:zh:霓裳羽衣曲|霓裳羽衣舞]]) choreographed by [[Yang Guifei|Consort Yang]] and set to a tune said to have been composed by [[Emperor Xuanzong of Tang|Emperor Xuanzong]] himself. This dance, originally called the [[Brahmin]] Dance, may have been a Central Asian or Indian dance brought to the Tang court by way of Kucha.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://en.unesco.org/silkroad/sites/silkroad/files/knowledge-bank-article/vol_III%20silk%20road_the%20western%20regions%20under%20the%20t'ang%20empire%20and%20the%20kingdom%20of%20tibet.pdf |title=History of Civilizations of Central Asia, Volume III: The cross-roads of civilizations: A.D. 250 to 750 |editor=B.A. Litvinsky |chapter=The Western Regions (HSI-YÜ) Under The T’ang Empire And The Kingdom OF Tibet |author=Mu Shun-ying and Wang Yao |page=352 |publisher=UNESCO |year=1996 |isbn=978-9231032110 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a slow gentle dance that may be danced in groups but also as a solo, set to strings and woodwind with a humming chorus, with the dancers in elaborate costumes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=qpNQ91M3BswC&amp;pg=PA39 |title=Every Step a Lotus: Shoes for Bound Feet|author=Dorothy Ko |pages=39–40 |publisher=University of California Press |year= 2002 |isbn=978-0-520-23284-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many such lavish dances stopped being performed after the [[An Lushan Rebellion]] which diminished the power and wealth of the state, and court music and dance became greatly reduced.

[[File:Ryouou in Bugaku (Hokkaido Gokoku-Jinja) 3.jpg|thumb|left|Some pieces of music and dance of the Tang dynasty that had disappeared from China survive in Japan. An example is the masked dance ''The King of Lanling'' ([[:jp:蘭陵王 (雅楽)|蘭陵王]]).]]

During the Sui and Tang dynasties, song-and-dance drama from the earlier dynasties became popular and developed further. Examples included the Big Face (大面) or "mask", also called "The King of Lanling" (蘭陵王), a masked dance from the [[Northern Qi dynasty]] honouring [[Gao Changgong]] who went into battle wearing a mask.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Lgs4AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA1&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Music from the Tang Court: Volume 5 |publisher= Cambridge University Press |year= 1985|editor= Laurence Picken |pages=1–12 |isbn=978-0521347761 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Faye2 /&gt; The ''Botou'' (撥頭, meaning using the hand to sweep hair aside), from Central Asia, is another masked dance.

Many of the dances of the Tang dynasty are described in [[Tang poetry]]: [[Bai Juyi]] and [[Yuan Zhen]] wrote of the Whirling Dance in their poems "The Whirling Hu Girl" (胡旋女), [[Du Fu]] of the sword dance.&lt;ref name="du fu"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=g7M8AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA11&amp;lpg=PA11#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Music from the Tang Court: volume 2 |editor= by Laurence Picken |pages=10–12 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year= 1985 |isbn=978-0521318587 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The White Ramie Dance, [[Lion Dance]], and other dances are also mentioned. The Tang poets also wrote [[Ci (poetry)|''Ci'' verses]] set to the tunes for dances such as the "Boddhisattva Barbarian" ([[:zh:菩萨蛮|菩薩蠻]]), a processional dance (隊舞) that may have several hundred performers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Sos6AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA59&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Music from the Tang Court: Volume 4 |publisher= Cambridge University Press |year= 1985|editor= Laurence Picken |pages=59–61 |isbn=978-0521318341}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A great number of dances were recorded in the Tang dynasty but most were lost after its collapse,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.china.org.cn/english/travel/53069.htm |title=Tang Dynasty Dances |work=China.org }}&lt;/ref&gt; yet substantial records remain, including over 60 Grand Compositions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=z-fAxn_9f8wC&amp;pg=PA458&amp;lpg=PA458 |title= China: Five Thousand Years of History and Civilization |pages=458 |publisher=City University of Hong Kong Press |year= 2007|isbn=978-9629371401}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some music and dances were transmitted to Japan and retained to this day as part of ''[[gagaku]]''.

==Five Dynasties to the Song dynasty (907–1279 CE)==
[[File:Tombs of song dynasty at baisha9e0ba1fa7acc7682c251.jpg|thumb|Mural from a Song dynasty tomb in Henan, depicting a male dancer accompanied by musicians.]]

A period of fragmentation, the [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period]], followed the fall of the Tang dynasty until China was unified under the [[Song dynasty]]. During the Song dynasty, [[footbinding]] began to spread among the elite in China, and the practice may have started during the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period among female dancers. One story concerns the favorite concubine of the [[Southern Tang]] emperor [[Li Yu (Southern Tang)|Li Yu]] who bound her feet into the shape of the crescent moon and performed a lotus dance on the point of her feet ballet-fashion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=2Ifj9h4Z4YQC&amp;pg=PA164 |title=The Art of the Shoe |author= Marie-Josèphe Bossan |page=164 |publisher=Parkstone Press Ltd |year=2004 |isbn=978-1859958032}}&lt;/ref&gt; While originating from dancing, footbinding which became more prevalent during the Song dynasty would also contribute to the decline of dance as an art form. After the Song dynasty, less and less was heard about beauties and courtesans who were also great dancers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=85M3AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA222#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title= Sexual life in ancient China:A Preliminary Survey of Chinese Sex and Society from Ca. 1500 B.C.

[[File:Lion dance by children in Song Dynasty.jpg|thumb|left|Details of the Song dynasty painting "One Hundred Children Playing in the Spring" (百子嬉春圖) by Su Hanchen (蘇漢臣) showing children performing the lion dance.]]

The popular centres of entertainment in the Song capital Bianliang (present-day [[Kaifeng]]) and later at Lin'an (present-day [[Hangzhou]]) were the ''wazi'' (瓦子, meaning "tiles") or ''wasi'' (瓦肆, tile market), where theatres in the form of fenced-off rings called ''goulan'' (勾欄) may be found. Various forms of entertainment including dances were performed in these centres. Dances performed may be generally referred to as Dance Wheeling (舞旋), a reference to their spinning movement, and other foreign dances are called Dance of Foreign Music (舞番樂). Some dances from the Tang dynasty developed into a Team Dance with a leading dancer called the Flower Center, a presenter called Bamboo Pole, with background dancers and musicians. These dances incorporated singing as well as monologue and dialogue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=z-fAxn_9f8wC&amp;pg=PA459&amp;lpg=PA459 |title= China: Five Thousand Years of History and Civilization |pages=459 |publisher=City University of Hong Kong Press |year= 2007|isbn=978-9629371401}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the familiar dances of present-day China were mentioned in the Song dynasty, examples are the Flower Drum (花鼓); Playing the Big Head (耍大頭), which is the Big-headed Monk (大頭和尚) of later eras where the performer wears a large head mask; and the Dry Boat (旱船) Dance which is known from previous dynasties where a boy may dress up as a girl wearing a boat-like structure made of cloth so that he appeared to sit in a boat, and accompanied by a boatman holding an oar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.xiexingcun.com/wh055/20.html |title=第十一章 宋代"瓦子"与"社火" }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G0U5DzTBknQC&amp;pg=PA37&amp;lpg=PA37 |title=Mooncakes and Hungry Ghosts: Festivals of China |author= Carol Stepanchuk, Charles Choy Wong |page=37 |publisher=China Books &amp; Periodicals |year= 1992 |isbn=978-0835124812 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these dances may be performed by folk dance troupes called ''shehuo'' (社火, named after a spring festival) which performed during festivals, and each village or city may have its own dance troupe.  Other dances include Catching Butterflies (撲蝴蝶), Bamboo Horse (竹馬), and the ''Bao Lao'' Dance (舞鮑老, ''Bao Lao'' was a comic character in a puppet show).

In the ''wazi'' of the Song dynasty, various theatrical forms flourished and [[Chinese opera]] began to take shape. More elaborate narrative became incorporated into dances, for example the sword dance would depict the [[Feast at Hong Gate]], followed by depiction of the responses of [[Zhang Xu]] and [[Du Fu]] after watching the famed sword dance of Lady Gongsun in the Tang dynasty. Stories are told, sometimes with song in these dance performances. In the north, Chinese theatre developed in the form of the ''[[zaju]]'' variety show, and in the south, the ''[[Nanxi (Chinese opera)|nanxi]]'' opera.

==Yuan to Qing (1271–1912 CE)==
[[File:Beijing opera03.jpg|thumb|Dance as part of [[Peking Opera]] in a performance of "Heavenly Lady Scatters Flowers" (天女散花).]]
Chinese opera became very popular by the [[Yuan dynasty]], and in the following dynasties, a variety of genres such as the ''[[kunqu]]'' and [[Peking opera]] developed in various regions of China. Dances became absorbed into opera, and dance would be an essential component to be mastered by opera performers. The integration of dance into opera is particularly evident in kunqu opera such as the [[Ming dynasty]] piece ''[[The Peony Pavilion]]'' whereby each phrase of singing may be accompanied by a dance movement, and the opera is interspersed with song-and-dance pieces. Dances such as "Dance Judgement" (舞判, also called the Dance of [[Zhong Kui]], 跳鐘馗) became opera pieces in the Ming dynasty, and dances of the Song dynasty such as Flapping the Flag (撲旗子) later became part of Chinese opera.  As Chinese opera became increasing popular, there was also a corresponding decline in dance as an individual separate art form.  Even by the Ming dynasty, pure dance was already becoming uncommon outside of folk traditions and group performances during festivals, and would become increasingly rare.&lt;ref name="wang kefan3"&gt;{{cite book |title=The History of Chinese Dance |author= Wang Kefen|publisher= China Books &amp; Periodicals |pages=78–81 |year= 1985 |isbn=978-0835111867}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dance performances by females, already suffering due to the practice of footbinding as well as other social restrictions, also faced bans in later periods, for example women were forbidden to perform in Beijing theatre by the [[Qianlong Emperor]] during the [[Qing dynasty]], and males therefore replaced female theatre roles and dance parts.&lt;ref name="friedler"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5fwkDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA21|title=Drama Kings: Players and Publics in the Re-creation of Peking Opera, 1870-1937 |author= Joshua Goldstein |page=21 |publisher=University of California Press|date=9 February 2007|isbn= 978-0520247529 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Folk dances however remained popular. Many of the folk dances of the Qing dynasty were known from the earlier period, for example, the ''[[yangge]]'' dance was developed from a dance known in the Song dynasty as Village Music (村田樂).&lt;ref name="folk dance"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2h3DuP1sok8C&amp;pg=PA231 |title=中国民族民间音乐 |page=231|author=王耀华，陈新凤，黄少枚 |publisher=福建教育出版社 |isbn=9787533443986 |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Small-scale folk song-and-dance shows became popular in the Qing dynasty, examples are the Flower Drum, Flower Lantern (花燈) and [[Tea-picking opera|Picking Tea]] (採茶) song and dance shows.  The Flower Drum show was initially popular in the countryside, but then spread into towns. The Picking Tea show developed from the folk song and dance, Tea Picking Lantern. Some of these folk song and dance performances also influenced or developed into local forms of opera.&lt;ref name="wang kefan3"/&gt;

==Modern era==

In the early 20th century, there was a call to "make use of old forms" of literature and art as a means of connecting with the masses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SWuPCNxdsQgC&amp;pg=PA8#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title= Popular Chinese Literature and Performing Arts  in the People's Republic of China 1949–1979 |editor= Bonnie S. McDougall |pages=8–14 |publisher=University of California Press |year=1984 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional Chinese dance forms were revised and propagated. In 1943, the [[Chinese Communist Party]] launched the new ''[[yangge]]'' movement where the ''yangge'' dance was adopted as a means of rallying village support. The new dance is a simplified version of the old dance with socialist elements such as the leader of the holding a sickle instead of umbrella, and it is also known as "struggle yangge" or "reform yangge".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1017/S0305741005000056 | last1 = Chang-tai | first1 = Hung | year = 2005 | title = The Dance of Revolution: Yangge in Beijing in the Early 1950s | url =https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/20192445?uid=3738032&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21102822756837 | journal = The China Quarterly | volume = 181 | issue = | pages = 82–99 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=YMT4U_abB6oC&amp;pg=PA107&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Culture and Customs of China |author= Richard Gunde |page=107 |publisher= Greenwood |year= 2001 |isbn=978-0313361180 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Western dance forms became popular in the 20th century, for example Western [[ballroom dancing]] became popular in the 1940s in Shanghai nightclubs, and early Communists leaders such as [[Mao Zedong]] and [[Zhou Enlai]] were also avid Soviet-style ballroom dancers. Previously it would not have been permissible for men and women from respectable families to dance together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=YMT4U_abB6oC&amp;pg=PA110&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Culture and Customs of China |author= Richard Gunde |pages=110–112 |publisher= Greenwood |year= 2001 |isbn=978-0313361180 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A notable dancer of the twentieth century is [[Dai Ailian]] who collected folk dances and created new works based on these folk dances of the Han people as well as other ethnic minorities for public presentation. Her works include ''Lotus Dance'' which is based on a Shaanxi folk dance, ''Flying Apsaras'' based on the murals in the [[Mogao caves]], ''The Drum of Yao People'', ''The Mute Carries the Cripple'', ''Tibetan Spring'', and ''Anhui Folk Dance''.&lt;ref name=women&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XOGdnCPJSOMC&amp;pg=PA118&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Biographical dictionary of Chinese women: The Twentieth Century, 1912-2000 |page= 118 |editors=Lily Xiao Hong Lee, A.

In the People's Republic of China era, the practice of creating new dances based on the older forms of dances as well as various folk traditions continues to the present days. Although traditional titles may be used, such dances as presented in theatre and television are generally modern imagination of long-lost ancient dances using modern choreography.

==Dragon dance and lion dance==
[[File:Dragon dance at China 1.jpg|thumb|Dragon dance.]]

Among the best-known of the Chinese traditional dances are the [[dragon dance]] and [[lion dance]], and both dances were known in earlier dynasties in various forms. A form of lion dance similar to today's lion dance was described as early as the Tang dynasty, the modern form of the dragon dance however may be a more recent development.

In some of the earliest dances recorded in China, dancers may have dressed as animal and mythical beasts, and during the Han dynasty, some forms of the dragon dance were mentioned. The [[Chinese dragon|Dragon]] was associated with rain, and during the Han dynasty, a dance may be performed during a ritual to appeal for rain at time of drought. According to the Han dynasty text ''[[Luxuriant Dew of the Spring and Autumn Annals]]'' by [[Dong Zhongshu]], as part of the ritual, clay figures of the dragons were made and children or adults may then perform a dance. The number of dragons, their length and colour, as well as the performers may vary according to the time of year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tUwTxocaOGsC&amp;pg=PA107&amp;lpg=PA107&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Handbook of Chinese Mythology |author= Lihui Yang, Deming An |publisher=Oxford University Press |pages=107–108 |year= 2008 |isbn=978-0195332636 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ctext.org/chun-qiu-fan-lu/qiu-yu/ |title=《求雨》|work=Chinese Text Project}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''baixi'' variety shows, performers called "mime people" (象人) dressed up as various creatures such as a green dragon playing a flute, and acts where fish turned into a dragon were also described.&lt;ref name="baixi"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://zh.wikisource.org/zh-hant/%E8%A5%BF%E4%BA%AC%E8%B3%A6 |title=西京賦 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the performances are depicted in Han dynasty stone relief engravings, and the props used appear to be cumbersome and do not resemble modern form of the dance. Modern dragon dance uses light-weight structure manipulated by a dozen or so of men using poles at regular intervals along the length of the dragon, and some forms of the dragon can be very long and involve hundreds of performers. There are more than 700 different dragon dances in China.&lt;ref name=asian&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8tCYjXOtkdgC&amp;pg=PA99&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Asian Dance |author=Janet Descutner |pages=99–100 |publisher= Chelsea House Publishing |isbn=978-1604134780 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:8280 MGM Macau International Lion Dance Championship 2010.JPG|thumb|A lion dance]]

The [[lion dance]] has been suggested to have been introduced from outside China as lion is not native to China, and the Chinese word for lion itself, ''shi'' (獅), may have been derived from the Persian word ''šer''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Xy45AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA201&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Music for a Lion Dance of the Song Dynasty |series=Musica Asiatica: volume 4| author= Laurence E.

In the Tang court, the lion dance was called the Great Peace Music (太平樂) or the Lion Dance of the Five Directions (五方師子舞) where five large lions of different colours, each over 3 metres tall and each had 12 "lion lads" with the lions being teased by performers holding red whisks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G0U5DzTBknQC&amp;pg=PA38&amp;lpg=PA38&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Mooncakes and Hungry Ghosts: Festivals of China |author= Carol Stepanchuk, Charles Choy Wong |page=38 |publisher=China Books &amp; Periodicals |year= 1992 |isbn=978-0835124812 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another version was performed by two persons, and was described by Tang poet [[Bai Juyi]] in his poem "Western Liang Arts" (西凉伎), where the dancers wear a lion costume made of a wooden head, a silk tail and furry body, with eyes gilded with gold and teeth plated with silver, and ears that move, a form that resembles today's Lion Dance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.shicimingju.com/baidu/list/63979.html |title=《西凉伎》 |quote=西凉伎，假面胡人假狮子。刻木为头丝作尾，金镀眼睛银贴齿。奋迅毛衣摆双耳，如从流沙来万里。紫髯深目两胡儿，鼓舞跳粱前致辞。 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are two main forms of the Chinese lion dance, the Northern Lion and Southern Lion. A form of the lion dance is also found in Tibet where it is called the [[Snow Lion]] Dance.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.case.edu/affil/tibet/tibetanSociety/documents/Theearth-oxandthesnowlion.pdf |title=Amdo Tibetans in Transition: Society and Culture in the Post-Mao Era |editor=Toni Huber |author=Mona Schrempf |pages=147–169 |publisher=Brill |year=2002 |isbn=9004125965 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6334">'''Humanities in the United States''' refers to the study of [[humanities]] disciplines, such as literature, history, language, performing and visual arts or philosophy, in the [[United States|United States of America]].

Many American colleges and universities seek to provide a broad "[[liberal arts education]]", in which all [[college]] students to study the humanities in addition to their specific area of study. Prominent proponents of liberal arts in the United States have included [[Mortimer J. Adler]]&lt;ref&gt;Adler, Mortimer J.; "A Guidebook to Learning: For the Lifelong Pursuit of Wisdom"&lt;/ref&gt; and [[E.D. Hirsch]].  A liberal arts focus is often coupled with curricular requirements; colleges including [[Saint Anselm College]] and [[Providence College]] have mandatory two-year [[core curricula]] in the humanities for their students.

The 1980 United States Rockefeller Commission on the Humanities described the humanities in its report, ''The Humanities in American Life'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;Through the humanities we reflect on the fundamental question: What does it mean to be human? The humanities offer clues but never a complete answer. They reveal how people have tried to make moral, spiritual, and intellectual sense of a world in which irrationality, despair, loneliness, and death are as conspicuous as birth, friendship, hope, and reason.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Conceptual validity==
The very concept of the ‘humanities’ as a  class or kind, distinct from the ’sciences’, has come under repeated attack in the twentieth century. [[Thomas Samuel Kuhn|T.S. Kuhn]]’s ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]''&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Samuel Kuhn|Kuhn, Thomas]], ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'', The [[University of Chicago Press]], 1962&lt;/ref&gt; argued that the forces driving scientific progress often have less to do with objective inference from unbiased observation than with much more value-laden sociological and cultural factors. More recently, [[Richard Rorty]] has argued that the distinction between the sciences and the humanities is harmful to both pursuits, placing the former on an undeserved pedestal and condemning the latter to irrationality. Rorty’s position requires a wholesale rejection of such traditional philosophical distinctions as those between appearance and reality, subjective and objective, replacing them with what he endorses as a new ‘fuzziness’. This leads to a kind of pragmatism where "the oppositions between the humanities, the arts, and the sciences, might gradually fade away... In this situation, ‘the humanities’ would no longer think of themselves as such...."&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Rorty|Rorty, Richard]], ''Science as Solidarity'', in ''Objectivity, Relativism and Truth: Philosophical Papers Volume I'', [[Cambridge University Press]], 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modernism and postmodernism==
In the United States, the late 20th century saw a challenge to the "elitism" of the humanities, which [[Edward Said]] has characterized as a "conservative philosophy of gentlemanly refinement, or sensibility." Such [[postmodernism|postmodernists]] argued that the humanities should go beyond the study of "[[dead white males]]" to include work by women and people of color, and without religious bias. The French philosopher [[Michel Foucault]] has been a very influential part of this movement, stating in ''The Order of Things'' that "we can study only individuals, not human nature."  However some in the humanities believed that such changes could be detrimental; the result is said to be what [[E. D. Hirsch Jr.]] refers to as declining [[cultural literacy]].&lt;ref&gt;Kernan, Alvin, editor; ''What's Happened to the Humanities?'', [[Princeton University Press]], Princeton, New Jersey, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

==National institutions==
President [[Lyndon Johnson]] signed the [[National Foundation on the Arts and Humanities Act]] in 1965,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.neh.gov/whoweare/overview.html www.neh.gov]&lt;/ref&gt; creating the National Council on the Humanities, and funded the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] (NEH) in 1969. NEH is an independent grant-making agency of the United States government dedicated to supporting research, education, preservation, and public programs in the humanities (see [[Public humanities]]).

NEH facilitated the creation of State Humanities Councils&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.neh.gov/whoweare/statecouncils.html www.neh.gov]&lt;/ref&gt; in the 56 [[U.S. state]]s and [[Territories of the United States|territories]]. Each council operates independently, defining the "humanities" in relationship to the disciplines, subjects, and values valued in the regions they serve. Councils give grant funds to individuals, scholars, and nonprofit organizations dedicated to the humanities in their region. Councils also offer diverse programs and services that respond to the needs of their communities and according to their own definitions of the humanities.

==Career prospects==
Criticism of the traditional humanities/liberal arts degree program has been leveled by critics who see them as both expensive and relatively "useless" in the modern American job market, where several years of specialized study is required in most job fields. According to a 2018 report by the [[Humanities Indicators]], unemployment rates for humanities majors were slightly higher and their earnings were slightly lower than the averages for college degree recipients with similar degree levels (though both were still substantially better than for those without a college degree). Their overall levels of satisfaction with their jobs and their lives, however, were essentially the same as graduates from other fields, with more than 85% of humanities graduates reporting they were satisfied with their jobs. As of 2015, approximately five million people employed in management and professional jobs had bachelor’s degrees in the humanities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The State of the Humanities 2018: Graduates in the Workforce &amp; Beyond|last=|first=|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|year=2018|isbn=|location=Cambridge, Mass.|pages=5-6, 12, 19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''"I'm Not That Guy"''' is the sixth episode in the [[How I Met Your Mother (season 3)|third season]] of the television series ''[[How I Met Your Mother]]'' and fiftieth overall. It originally aired on October 29, 2007.

==Plot==
[[Marshall Eriksen|Marshall]] is thrilled when he learns he got the job he's always wanted at the [[Natural Resources Defense Council]]. However, [[Lily Aldrin|Lily]] urges him to keep his [[job interview|interview]] with the [[corporate]], [[pollute]]r-defending Nicholson, Hewitt, &amp; West. Marshall is surprised at how young and understanding his interviewer, Jefferson Coatsworth, is, and agrees to go to dinner with him. [[Barney Stinson|Barney]] asserts that Coatsworth is trying to [[seduce]] Marshall, but Lily still insists that Marshall should still go to the dinner. 

While Marshall enjoys his fancy dinner (and is excited by an encounter with [[Patrick Swayze]], one of NH&amp;W's clients), [[Robin Scherbatsky|Robin]] discovers why Lily actually wants Marshall to take the high-paying corporate job: Lily has dozens of [[credit card]]s and is very much in debt, owing to always shopping when she is upset about something. Robin is upset and asks her to confess to Marshall so that he takes the higher paying job. 

Although Marshall agrees to take the job, he regrets it the next day (with a little help from Lily, who eventually urges him to work at the NRDC) and goes to tell Coatsworth that he changed his mind. Coatsworth takes him to an [[amusement park]] and tells him that they will be his only client, at which point Marshall decides that he will definitely take the job, even to the point of saying that the amusement park was the "least evil place in the world", although Older Ted mentions that the amusement park was found in violation of several safety standards, three people died and an ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'' outbreak was traced back to the park's [[corndog]]s.

Barney has discovered a [[Pornography|pornographic movie]] entitled ''Welcome to the Sex Plane'' featuring a [[porn star]] named [[Ted Mosby]]. While Ted is at first amused to discover the reason behind strange encounters with his doctor and a magazine interviewer (and also discovering that Wendy the Waitress watches porn), he then becomes uncomfortable and confused upon learning that porn-star Ted Mosby is from the same town, [[Shaker Heights, Ohio]], as Ted. He and Barney go to an adult video convention to confront "[[Bizarro]] Ted". They find out that Ted's double idolized him as a child, and honored him by taking his name. Ted wants "Bizarro Ted" to change his name, so he tells him the person who he really idolized was Lance Hardwood. Bizarro Ted instead makes a new movie entitled ''Lance Hardwood: Sex Architect'' (starring Ted Mosby). The guys watch the new movie in Ted's apartment, until they find out that it was filmed in the very same apartment, with a little help from Barney, who helped with the location of the porn.

'''Ideation''' is the [[creativity|creative]] process of generating, developing, and communicating new ideas, where an [[idea]] is understood as a basic element of thought that can be either visual, concrete, or abstract.&lt;ref&gt;Jonson, 2005, page 613&lt;/ref&gt; Ideation comprises all stages of a thought cycle, from [[innovation]], to development, to actualization.&lt;ref&gt;Graham and Bachmann, 2004, pg 54&lt;/ref&gt;  Ideation can be conducted by individuals, organizations, or crowds. As such, it is an essential part of the [[design process]], both in education and practice.&lt;ref&gt;Broadbent, in Fowles, 1979, page 15&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Methods of innovation==

The book ''Ideation: The Birth and Death of Ideas'' (Graham and Bachmann, 2004) proposes the following methods of innovation:

;Problem solution:  This is the most simple method of progress, where someone has found a problem and as a result, solves it.
;Derivative idea:  This involves taking something that already exists and changing it.
;Symbiotic idea:  A symbiotic method of idea creation is when multiple ideas are combined, using different elements of each to make a whole.
;Revolutionary idea:  A revolutionary idea breaks away from traditional thought and creates a brand new perspective.  For example, the writings of [[Copernicus]] (a development of classical Greek thought).
;Serendipitous discovery:  [[Serendipitous]] solutions are ideas which have been coincidentally developed without the intention of the inventor. For example, the discovery of [[penicillin]].
;Targeted innovation:  Creating a targeted innovation deals with a direct path of discovery.  This is often accompanied by intensive research in order to have a distinct and almost expected resolution.  For example, [[linear programming]].
;Artistic innovation:  Artistic innovation disregards the necessity for practicality and holds no constraints.
;Philosophical idea:  The philosophical idea lives in the mind of the creator and can never  be proven. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/search?tbo=p&amp;tbm=bks&amp;q=isbn:0471479446|title= Ideation: The Birth and Death of Ideas|accessdate=31 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This type of idea however can still have vast residual effects.  For example, the idea of [[eternal recurrence]].
;Computer-assisted discovery:  This uses a computer in order to widen possibilities of research and numeric possibilities.

This list of methods is by no means comprehensive or necessarily accurate. Graham and Bachmann's examples of revolutionary ideas might better be described as evolutionary; both Marx and Copernicus having built upon pre-existing concepts within new or different contexts.  Similarly, the description provided for artistic innovation represents one perspective.

More-nuanced understandings, such as that expressed by [[Stephen Nachmanovitch]] in ''Free Play: Improvisation in Life and Art'', recognize the generative force technical and perceptual limitations provide within specific arts practices.{{Page needed|date=November 2014}}  In [[painting]], for example, technical limitations such as the frame, the surface and the palette, along with perceptual constraints like [[Figure–ground (perception)|figure/ground relationships]] and [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]], provide creative frameworks for the painter.  Similarly in music, harmonic scales, meter and time signatures work in tandem with choices of instrumentation and expression to both produce specific results and improvise novel outcomes.

The [[T.O.T.E.|T.O.T.E. model]], an [[iterative]] [[problem solving]] strategy based on [[feedback]] loops, provides an alternative approach to considering the process of ideation.  Ideation may also be considered as a facet of other generative systems, such as [[Emergence]].

==Criticism==

The word "ideation" has come under informal criticism as being a term of meaningless jargon,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://hbr.org/2008/08/why-jargon-feeds-on-lazy-minds.html|title=Why Jargon Feeds on Lazy Minds|last=Berkun|first=Scott|work=[[Harvard Business Review]]|accessdate=16 March 2016|date=2008-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as being inappropriately similar to the [[psychiatry|psychiatric]] term for [[suicidal ideation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.themuse.com/advice/10-annoying-buzzwords-the-whole-office-would-be-better-off-without|title=Annoying Tech Jargon to Remove From Your Vocabulary-The Muse|last=Thomson|first=Stephanie|publisher=[[The Daily Muse|The Muse]]|accessdate=16 March 2016|date=2015-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''International religious television broadcasters''' broadcast from a host nation to another nation or nations.

Jwalapuram is of particular importance in understanding the emergence of microlithic technology in South Asia and the role of environmental change on lithic technological change. At Jwalapuram Locality 9, five stratigraphic units provide a record of technological change through time. Microblade technology dominates lithic assemblages from Stratum E to the top deposit. There are many different definitions for “microblade” and Clarkson et al. define microblade with a 40mm maximum length in the direction of striking and a length:width ratio greater than 2:1; they also include that the dorsal surface has nearly no cortex (less than 20 percent) and at least on dorsal ridge in the direction of striking as well as nearly parallel lateral margins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Clarkson|first1=Chris|last2=Petraglia|first2=Michael|last3=Korisettar|first3=Ravi|last4=Haslam|first4=Michael|last5=Boivin|first5=Nicole|last6=Crowther|first6=Alison|last7=Ditchfield|first7=Peter|last8=Fuller|first8=Dorian|last9=Miracle|first9=Preston|last10=Harris|first10=Claire|last11=Connell|first11=Kate|last12=James|first12=Hannah|last13=Koshy|first13=Jinu|title=The oldest and longest enduring microlithic sequence in India: 35000 years of modern human occupation and change at the Jwalapuram Locality 9 rockshelter|journal=Antiquity|date=2009|volume=83|pages=326–348}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using this definition of microblade, Clarkson et al. track the changing density of microblade technology throughout the strata. The changes in microlithic technology is speculated to have been caused by climate change, which made the area more arid and therefore groups of people had to become more mobile, causing changes in their technological tool kits.&lt;ref&gt;Clarkson, C., Petraglia, M., Korisettar, R., Haslam, M., Boivin, N., Crowther, A., Ditchfield, P., Fuller, D., Miracle, P., Harris, C., Connell, K., James, H. &amp; Koshy, J. 2009.

'''''Kung Pow! Enter the Fist''''' is a 2002 American [[Martial arts film|martial arts]] [[comedy film]] that parodies [[Hong Kong action cinema]]. Written, directed by and starring [[Steve Oedekerk]], it uses footage from the 1978 Hong Kong martial arts film ''[[Tiger &amp; Crane Fists]]'' (also called ''Savage Killers''), along with new footage shot by Oedekerk, to create an original, unrelated plot.

The film was a moderate box office success, grossing $17 million worldwide, and received largely negative critical reviews but has since became a [[cult film]]. A [[#Sequel|sequel]], to be written and directed by Oedekerk, was announced in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[https://consequenceofsound.net/2015/07/a-sequel-to-kung-pow-enter-the-fist-is-in-the-works/ A sequel to Kung Pow-Consequence of Sound]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
A man, called The Chosen One by the narrator, wanders from town to town to search for the man who killed his family and tried to kill him when he was a baby. In one town, he meets Master Tang, a very ill and slightly deranged [[sifu]], and asks Tang to help him improve his already impressive martial arts ability. Master Tang is skeptical at first, but after seeing The Chosen One's mark (his sentient tongue, which he names Tonguey), he allows him to train at his dojo. The Chosen One is introduced to two other students: Wimp Lo, a young man who was deliberately trained incorrectly as a joke, and Ling, who has romantic feelings for him.

While training, The Chosen One shows cartoon-like feats of strength, and Wimp Lo deems him an enemy out of jealousy. Upon learning that Master Pain, the man who killed his parents, has just arrived in town, The Chosen One prepares to confront him. Master Pain draws a crowd and demonstrates his skills. He lets his henchmen kick him repeatedly in the groin, then subdues them all in one move. Impressed by Master Pain's skills, the town's mayor hires him, and he randomly changes his name to Betty. The Chosen One attempts to train himself by letting people kick him in the groin, but is knocked out after being hit. When he wakes up, a mysterious woman named Whoa warns him not to rush to fight Betty. After flirtily fighting The Chosen One, Whoa flies off into the sky.

Ignoring the advice, The Chosen One sets off to find Betty. He comes across one of Betty's evil companions: Moo Nieu (pronounced [[Mooning|"moon you"]]), a [[Holstein Friesian cattle|Holstein cow]] gifted in karate, with a large udder that can squirt milk as a weapon. They fight in a scene parodying ''[[The Matrix]]'', and The Chosen One eventually incapacitates Moo Nieu by milking her until her udder is empty. He sees Betty at a waterfall and confronts him. Master Doe, Ling's Father, shows up and tries to stop the unprepared Chosen One, and is wounded by Betty. The Chosen One takes Master Doe to Master Tang; it turns out they are old friends. However, as Tang massages Doe's wound, it doesn't close and Doe dies that night. Out of depression, Ling confesses her feelings for The Chosen One.

Confused, The Chosen One journeys out to a field and consults the heavens for confidence. Suddenly Mu-Shu Fasa, a large sentient [[lion]], appears in the sky and dispenses advice in a scene parodying a portion of ''[[The Lion King]]''. He returns to town and finds that Betty's hostility has expanded to the entire town, and they are killing anyone who may be his allies. He finds Wimp Lo, Ling, Master Tang and even his dog heavily maimed. However, except for Lo, they all survive. After taking Ling and his dog to safety, The Chosen One begins training himself. Believing Betty's weak points are the pyramid spikes embedded in his chest, The Chosen One makes wooden dummies, embeds similar spikes onto their chests and attempts to pluck them out with his bare hands. His hands are battered and he is exhausted, but after Ling treats his wounds and gives an inspiring speech, he finds himself rejuvenated and successfully pulls off the attack.

Meanwhile, Betty is called by the mysterious Evil Council and learns that The Chosen One is alive. The Chosen One confronts Betty at the temple. They fight evenly, until the Evil Council shows up revealing themselves to be [[France|French]] aliens, and gives Betty supernatural powers. Betty viciously beats up The Chosen One, who, in a semi-unconscious state, sees visions of Whoa and Mu-Shu Fasa giving him advice. Mu-Shu instructs him to open his mouth. As soon as he does, Tonguey flies out and attacks and destroys the mother ship, causing the entire Evil Council armada to panic and retreat, leaving Betty vulnerable. The Chosen One eventually rips the pyramid spikes out of Betty's chest, killing him. As The Chosen One returns home with Ling, his tribulations are far from over, as presented in a trailer for a sequel, ''Kung Pow 2: Tongue of Fury'', that immediately follows the final scene.

In a [[post-credits scene]], Master Tang, who has been left behind, [[fourth wall|asks someone]] to help him from a hungry [[golden eagle]] eating his leg.

==Cast==
*[[Steve Oedekerk]] – The Chosen One
**[[Jimmy Wang Yu]] (archival footage)
** Alejandro Olazabal – The Chosen One as a baby
*Hui Lou Chen – Master Tang
*[[Wong Fei-lung|Fei Lung]] – Master Pain a.k.a. "Betty"
**Leo Lee – Young Master Pain
*[[Ling Ling Tse]] – Ling
*Lin Yan – Dying Ling
*[[Lau Kar-wing]] – Wimp Lo
*Banjo&amp;nbsp; – Dog
*Jennifer Tung – Whoa
*Chi Ma – Master Doe
*[[Tad Horino]] – Chew Fat Lip
*Nasty Nes – [[Boombox]] Henchman
*Ming Lo – Father
*Peggy Lu – Mother
*Tori Tran – Peasant Woman
*Simon Rhee – Young Master Pain's Henchman

===Voiced-over characters===
In many scenes, [[Jimmy Wang Yu]], the lead actor in ''[[Tiger &amp; Crane Fists]]'', was replaced by Oedekerk via post-production [[chroma key]] and [[digital compositing]] techniques such as head replacement. Oedekerk also re-dubbed all of the original cast's voices himself, inventing a different voice for every character. The only exception is the character of "Whoa", who was voiced by her actress, Jennifer Tung. During filming of their scenes, Oedekerk and Tung spoke nonsensical lines, which were later re-dubbed with the correct lines from the script, in order to maintain the appearance of poorly-dubbed foreign language consistent with the rest of the film.

==DVD special features==
* Deleted scenes
* Director's commentary
* Alternate audio tracks, including the "What They Are Really Saying" track, which includes the original Chinese and the speech Oedekerk uses to parody the bad dubbing in old kung fu movies. Another notable audio choice is 'Book on Tape', where all the lines are read by a calm British narrator.
* Alternate ending featuring Betty in a speedo singing the ''Kung Pow!'' theme song.
* Making-of featurette
* "Tonguey Tribute" featurette

==Reception==
''Kung Pow! Enter the Fist'' received an 11% ''rotten'' rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/kung_pow/?name_order=asc|title=Kung Pow! Movie Reviews|publisher=[[RottenTomatoes.com]]|accessdate=September 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as an average score 14 out of 100 on Metacritic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/kung-pow-enter-the-fist/critic-reviews |title=Critic Reviews for Kung Pow: Enter the Fist |publisher=Metacritic |date= |accessdate=2014-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Kung Pow! Enter the Fist'' grossed a total of $17 million worldwide on a budget of $10 million.

==Sequel==
During a interview in 2012, Oedekerk said if he were to make a sequel to ''Kung Pow!'' that, instead of making a direct sequel alike to the first, he would instead like to have it use footage from a [[spaghetti western]] from Italy or Mexico, rather than a martial arts film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Wilson |first1=Tom |title=Big Pop Fun #9: Steve Oedekerk (3) |url=https://nerdist.com/big-pop-fun-9-steve-oedekerk-3/ |website=Nerdist |accessdate=4 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 23, 2015, it was announced that a sequel is currently in the works, with Oedekerk returning to write and direct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.flickeringmyth.com/2015/07/steve-oedekerk-is-working-on-a-kung-pow-enter-the-fist-sequel/amp/|title=Steve Oedekerk is working on a Kung Pow: Enter the Fist sequel|access-date=December 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lithium Technologies''' is a San Francisco-based provider of software that allows businesses to connect with their customers on [[social media]] and digital channels. Lithium was founded in 2001 as a spin-out from GX Media, which created technologies for professional rankings and tournaments and now hosts a number of popular gaming sites. The company's founders include [[Dennis Fong]], Lyle Fong, Michel Thouati, Kirk Yokomizo, John Joh, Nader Alizadeh, Michael Yang, and Matt Ayres.

The Lithium platform comprises a set of products for [[digital marketing]] and social customer support, including Lithium Communities, which act as the hub for a brand's digital conversations; Lithium Response, a social customer care tool; and Lithium Reach a social media management tool. [[Klout]] data powers the Lithium platform with its proprietary algorithms and volume of data with over 750M scored profiles."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Lithium's [[Software as a service|SaaS]] platform combines [[Online community|online customer community]] applications such as [[Internet forum|forums]], [[blogs]], [[innovation]] management, product [[Customer review|reviews]], and [[tribal knowledge]] bases with the broader social web and traditional [[Customer relationship management|CRM]] business processes, resulting in a wide range of online customer interaction methods.&lt;ref name=Greenberg/&gt;&lt;ref name=McKay/&gt; Stemming from its [[Gamification|gaming]] roots, the platform incorporates elaborate rating systems for contributors, with ranks, badges, and "kudos counts".&lt;ref name="O'Malley"/&gt;

Lithium hosts an annual user conference, LiNC (Lithium Networking Conference&lt;ref name=Greenberg&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.zdnet.com/article/linc-2015-lithium-sticks-the-landing/|title=LiNC 2015: Lithium sticks the landing {{!}} ZDNet|last=Greenberg|first=Paul|website=ZDNet|access-date=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;) designed to give [[Digital strategy|digital strategists]] a deeper understanding of trends in social customer engagement. Since its inception in 2008, the event has grown 1,100% to 900+ attendees in 2016. In 2017, the company held a series of localized LiNC events in cities like London, San Francisco, and Sydney.

==History==

In late 2008, Lithium completed a detailed, time-series analysis of up to a decade's worth of proprietary data that represents billions of interactions, millions of users, and scores of communities. This research, coupled with the company's expertise in planning, deploying, and managing customer communities, enabled Lithium to identify and calculate key factors that contributed to a new standard for measuring community health – the [[Community Health Index]].&lt;ref name=McKay&gt;{{cite news

[http://www.gov.ph/1986/09/10/memorandum-order-no-34-s-1986/ MEMORANDUM ORDER No.&amp;nbsp;34 - REVOKING PRESIDENTIAE NO. 1413 “DECLARING THE THEME ‘ISANG BANSA, ISANG DIWA,’ AS THE NATIONAL MOTTO OF THE REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, AND INCORPORATING IT IN THE NATIONAL SEAL”].  Retrieved April 9, 2016 from the ''[[Official Gazette (Philippines)|Official Gazette]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;  "''[[Isang Bansa, Isang Diwa]]''", which was adopted during the presidency of [[Ferdinand Marcos]] in 1979.

The motto has been interpreted as embodying a set of common core [[Filipino values]], with each of the four being connected to one another.&lt;ref name="deped"&gt;{{cite news | author=Andrade, Jeanette I. | title=Luistro says DepEd still for ‘God-fearing’ learners | url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/634048/luistro-says-deped-still-for-god-fearing-learners | work=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]] | publisher=Philippine Daily Inquirer, Inc. | date=August 30, 2014 | accessdate=April 11, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Columnist Bobit Avila of the ''[[The Philippine Star|Philippine Star]]'' interpreted the motto as showing that Filipinos love God first before anything else.&lt;ref name="avila"&gt;{{cite news | author=Avila, Bobit S. | title=Unity? PNoy must reconcile with the church!  | url=http://www.philstar.com/opinion/679599/unity-pnoy-must-reconcile-church | work=[[The Philippine Star]] | publisher=PhilStar Daily, Inc. | date=April 27, 2011 | accessdate=April 11, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another columnist, Kay Malilong Isberto of ''[[The Freeman (newspaper)|The Freeman]]'', the [[Cebu City]]-based sister paper of the ''Star'', meanwhile explains that the motto represents the duties of good Filipino citizens.&lt;ref name="duties"&gt;{{cite news | author=Isberto, Kay Malilong | title=A National Motto | url=http://www.philstar.com/freeman-opinion/475535/national-motto | work=[[The Freeman (newspaper)|The Freeman]] | publisher=[[The Philippine Star|PhilStar Daily, Inc.]] | date=June 9, 2009 | accessdate=April 11, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although ''Maka-Diyos, Maka-Tao, Makakalikasan at Makabansa'' was made official in 1998, most Filipinos are unaware of it. In 2007, columnist Geronimo L. Sy wrote in the ''[[The Manila Times|Manila Times]]'' that the Philippines didn't have a national motto (which he called a "national slogan") and that many of the societal problems plaguing the country were because of a lack of common direction that a national motto would embody,&lt;ref name="nomotto"&gt;{{cite news | author=Sy, Geronimo L. | title=A national slogan | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2518&amp;dat=20070705&amp;id=TU1aAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=KSgMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2395,6079139&amp;hl=en | work=[[The Manila Times]] | publisher=Manila Times Publishing Corporation | date=July 5, 2007 | accessdate=April 11, 2016 | via=Google News }}&lt;/ref&gt; despite the Flag and Heraldic Code being made law nine years earlier.  Isberto would later suggest that most people probably don't know that there is a national motto to begin with, and of those who do know that there is one, they probably didn't take the time to contemplate how the motto should apply to their everyday lives.&lt;ref name="duties" /&gt; 

Avila notes that while "''Maka-Diyos, Maka-Tao, Makakalikasan at Makabansa''" is "perfect" as a national motto, he claims that because most Filipinos only look out for themselves, they don't abide by the doctrines of their Christian faith, which makes the motto problematic in comparison to mottos like "''[[Bhinneka Tunggal Ika]]''".&lt;ref name="avila" /&gt; This is in sharp contrast to his 2013 criticism of "''Isang Bansa, Isang Diwa''", which he denounced as embodying poorly-executed [[Jacobin (politics)|Jacobinist]] thought.&lt;ref name="jacobin"&gt;{{cite news | author=Avila, Bobit S. | title=Make language part of our inclusive growth | url=http://www.philstar.com/opinion/2013/08/22/1118591/make-language-part-our-inclusive-growth | work=[[The Philippine Star]] | publisher=PhilStar Daily, Inc. | date=August 22, 2013 | accessdate=April 10, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The national motto is inscribed in the Great Seal of the Philippines and the last part of the [[Pledge of Allegiance to the Philippine Flag|Pledge of Allegiance]]

A piece of bone pushed through a hole in the stone has been interpreted as a representation of eyes.  [[Paul Bahn]] has suggested this "mask" is "highly inconvenient", as "It makes a nonsense of the view that clueless Neanderthals could only copy their cultural superiors the [[Cro-Magnon]]s".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bahn|first=Paul|date=23 August 2003|title=A bone to pick|journal=New Scientist|issue=2409|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg17924095.600-a-bone-to-pick.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though this may represent an example of artistic expression in Neanderthal humans,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pettitt|first=Paul B|date=April 2003|title=Is this the infancy of art?

The '''Nigua Sugar Mill''', Boca de Nigua, is located 13&amp;nbsp;km to the west of [[Santo Domingo]], the capital of the [[Dominican Republic]], in [[Santo Domingo Province]]. Founded by Marquee De Aranda, but later owned by Juan Bautista Ollarazaba, the site was once an important production facility in the regional sugar industry.  It exhibits a mill and boiling room, as well as some historic Spanish colonial architecture. The site is being considered to be put on the [[World Heritage]] list of sites who have "outstanding universal value" to the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/criteria/- World Heritage Center: The Criteria for Selection]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Men's squash tournaments}}
The '''PSA World Series''' (formerly known as the '''PSA Super Series''') were a series of men's and women's [[squash (sport)|squash]] [[tournament]]s which are part of the [[Professional Squash Association]] (PSA) [[PSA World Tour|World Tour]] for the [[squash (sport)|squash]] season. The PSA World Series tournaments are some of the most prestigious events on the men's tour. The best-performing players in the World Series events qualify for the annual [[PSA World Series Finals]] tournament. 

Each year, several tournaments on the tour are designated World Series events. These include major events such as the [[World Open (squash)|World Championship]], the [[British Open Squash Championships|British Open]], the [[Hong Kong Open (squash)|Hong Kong Open]] or the [[Tournament of Champions (squash)|Tournament of Champions]]. Then, early the next year, the eight best-performing players from the Super Series events are invited to compete in the [[PSA World Series Finals]] (a similar event to the [[ATP World Tour Finals]]). 

The [[World Series Squash Finals]] were first staged in Vitis Club in [[Zurich]], [[Switzerland]], in 1993 and 1994. The event was then moved to [[England]]. It was held at the [[The Galleria, Hatfield|Galleria]] shopping complex in [[Hatfield, Hertfordshire|Hatfield]] from 1996-98. From 1999-2006, it was held in the Broadgate Arena in [[London]]. In 2007, the event was moved to the [[National Squash Centre]] in [[Manchester]]. In 2009, the tournament was shortened to a four-day format and played at the [[Queen's Club]] in [[London]]. And in 2014, the event was held for the first time in the United States in the Westwood Club in [[Richmond, Virginia]].

From January 2015, it also includes World Series tournaments for women's after merger between PSA and WSA in November 2014.

After 2017–18 PSA World Series is replaced by new PSA World Tour and PSA World Tour finals.

'''Rococo''' ({{IPAc-en|r|ə|ˈ|k|oʊ|k|oʊ}} or {{IPAc-en|r|oʊ|k|ə|ˈ|k|oʊ}}), less commonly '''roccoco''', or "'''Late Baroque'''", was a highly ornamental and theatrical style of decoration which combined asymmetry, scrolling curves, gilding, white and pastel colors, sculpted molding, and [[trompe l'oeil]] frescoes to create the illusions of surprise, motion and drama. It first appeared in France and Italy in the 1730s and spread to Central Europe in the 1750s and 1760s.&lt;Ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/v/video-rococ-writing-table|title=What is Rococo?|publisher=Victoria and Albert Museum|accessdate=20 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn|Ducher|1988|page=136}}&lt;ref&gt;"Rococo" Larousse Encyclopedia online &lt;/ref&gt; It is often described as the final expression of the [[Baroque]] movement.{{Sfn|Owens|2014|page=92}}

The Rococo style began in France in the first part of the 18th century in the reign of [[Louis Quinze|Louis XV]]  as a reaction against the more formal and geometric [[Style Louis XIV]]. It was known as the ''style [[rocaille]]'', or ''rocaille style''.{{Sfn|Ducher|1988|page=136}} It soon spread other parts of Europe, particularly northern Italy, Bavaria, Austria, other parts of Germany, and Russia. It also came to influence the other arts, particularly sculpture, furniture, silverware and glassware, painting,  music, and theatre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/506448/Rococo-style |title=Rococo style (design) - Britannica Online Encyclopedia |publisher=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=24 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

==Origin of the term==
[[File:Zwiefalten 28 04 2011 23.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Integrated rococo carving, [[stucco]] and [[fresco]] at [[Zwiefalten Abbey]] (1739–45)]] 
The word ''rococo'' was first used in 1835 in France, as a humorous variation of the word ''rocaille'' or a combination of ''rocaille'' and ''[[baroque]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Merriam-Webster Dictionary On-Line&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Monique Wagner, ''From Gaul to De Gaulle: An Outline of French Civilization.'' Peter Lang, 2005, p. 139. {{ISBN|0-8204-2277-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Rocaille was originally a method of decoration, using pebbles, seashells and cement, which was often used to decorate grottoes and fountains since the Renaissance.&lt;ref&gt;Larousse dictionary on-line&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marilyn Stokstad, ed. Art History. 4th ed. New Jersey: Prentice Hall, 2005. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the late 17th and early 18th century it became the term for a kind of decorative motif or ornament that appeared in the late [[Style Louis XIV]], in the form of a seashell interlaced with [[acanthus (plant)|acanthus]] leaves. In 1736 the designer and jeweler Jean Mondon published the ''Premier Livre de forme rocquaille et cartel'',  a collection of designs for ornaments of furniture and interior decoration. It was the first appearance in print of the term  "rocaille" to designate the style.&lt;ref&gt;De Morant, Henry, ''Histoire des arts décoratifs'', p. 355&lt;/ref&gt;   The carved or molded seashell motif was combined with palm leaves or twisting vines to decorate doorways, furniture, wall panels and other architectural elements.&lt;ref&gt;Renault and Lazé, ''Les Styles de l'architecture et du mobilier''(2006) p. 66&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century, the term was used to describe architecture or music which was excessively ornamental.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;[http://www.bc.edu/bc_org/avp/cas/his/CoreArt/art/ancien.html Ancien Regime Rococo] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180411162829/http://www.bc.edu/bc_org/avp/cas/his/CoreArt/art/ancien.html |date=11 April 2018 }}. Bc.edu. Retrieved on 2011-05-29.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20091007210702/http://www.huntfor.com/arthistory/c17th-mid19th/rococo.htm Rococo – Rococo Art]. Huntfor.com. Retrieved on 2011-05-29.&lt;/ref&gt;  Since the mid-19th century, the term has been accepted by [[art historians]]. While there is still some debate about the historical significance of the style, Rococo is now often considered as a distinct period in the development of [[European art]].

==Characteristics==
&lt;nowiki/&gt;''&lt;nowiki/&gt;&lt;nowiki/&gt;&lt;nowiki/&gt;''

Rococo featured exuberant decoration, with an abundance of curves, counter-curves, undulations and elements modeled on nature. The exteriors of Rococo buildings are often simple, while the interiors are entirely dominated by their ornament. The style was highly theatrical, designed to impress and awe at first sight. Floor plans of churches were often complex, featuring interlocking ovals; In palaces, grand stairways became centrepieces, and offered different points of view of the decoration.{{Sfn|Hopkins|2014|page=92}}

The style often integrated painting, molded stucco, and wood carving, and ''[[quadratura]]'', or illusionist ceiling paintings, which were designed to give the impression that the those entering the room were looking up at the sky, where cherubs and other figures were gazing down at them. Materials used included included stucco,  either painted or left white; combinations of different colored woods; lacquered wood in the Japanese style, and ornament of gilded bronze. The intent was to create an impression of surprise, awe and wonder on first view.{{Sfn|Ducher|1988|page=144}}

==France==
{{See also|Rocaille|Louis Quinze}}
The  ''[[Rocaille]]'' style, or French Rococo, appeared in Paris during the reign [[Louis XV]], and flourished between about 1723 and 1759.&lt;ref&gt;Lovreglio, Aurélia and Anne, ''Dictionnaire des Mobiliers et des Objets d'art'', Le Robert, Paris, 2006, p. 369&lt;/ref&gt;  The style was used particularly in salons, a new style of room designed to impress and entertain guests.  The most prominent example was the salon of the Princess in [[Hôtel de Soubise]] in Paris, designed by [[Germain Boffrand]] and [[Charles-Joseph Natoire]] (1735–40). The characteristics of French Rococo included exceptional artistry, especially in the complex frames made for mirrors and paintings, which sculpted in plaster and often gilded; and the use of vegetal forms (vines, leaves, flowers) intertwined in complex designs.{{Sfn|Hopkins|2014|pp. 92-93}}   The furniture also featured sinuous curves and vegetal designs. The leading furniture designers and craftsmen in the style included [[Juste-Aurele Meissonier]], [[Charles Cressent]], and [[Nicolas Pineau]].{{Sfn|De Morant|1970|page=382}}&lt;ref name="Kleiner2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kleiner|first=Fred|title=Gardner's art through the ages: the western perspective|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IJrN8rDirxkC&amp;pg=PA587|accessdate=21 February 2011|year=2010|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-0-495-57355-5|pages=583–584}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rocaille style lasted in France until the mid-18th century, and while it became more curving and vegetal, it never achieved the extravagant exuberance of the Rococo in Bavaria, Austria and Italy. The discoveries of Roman antiquities beginning in 1738 at [[Herculanum]] and especially at [[Pompeii]] in 1748 turned French architecture in the direction of the more symmetrical and less flamboyant neo-classicism.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Italy==
Artists in Italy, particularly [[Venice]], also produced an exuberant rococo style.  Venetian commodes imitated the curving lines and carved ornament of the French rocaille, but with a particular Venetian variation; the pieces were painted, often with landscapes or flowers or scenes from [[Guardi]] or other painters, or [[Chinoiserie]], against a blue or green background, matching the colours of the [[Venetian school (art)|Venetian school]] of painters whose work decorated the salons. Notable decorative painters included [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo]], who painted ceilings and murals of both churches and palazzos, and [[Giovanni Battista Crosato]] who painted the ballroom ceiling of the [[Ca Rezzonico]] in the [[illusionistic ceiling painting|quadraturo]] manner, giving the illusion of three dimensions. Tiepelo travelled to Germany with his son during 1752–1754, decorating the ceilings of the [[Würzburg Residence]], one of the major landmarks of the Bavarian rococo.  An earlier celebrated Venetian painter was [[Giovanni Battista Piazzetta]], who painted several notable church ceilings. {{Sfn|de Morant|1970|page=383}}

The Venetian Rococo also featured exceptional glassware, particularly [[Murano glass]], often engraved and coloured, which was exported across Europe. Works included multicolour chandeliers and mirrors with extremely ornate frames. {{Sfn|de Morant|1970|page=383}}

==Southern Germany and Russia==
The Rococo decorative style reached its summit in southern Germany and central Europe from the 1730s until the 1770s. It was first introduced from France through the publications and works of French architects and decorators, including the sculptor [[Claude III Audran]], the interior designer [[Gilles-Marie Oppenordt]], the architect [[Germain Boffrand]], the sculptor Jean Mondon, and the draftsman and engraver [[Pierre Lepautre (1652–1716)|Pierre Lepautre]]. Their work had an important influence on the German Rococo style.&lt;ref&gt;De Morant, Henry, ''Histoire des arts décoratifs'' (1977), pp. 354–355&lt;/ref&gt; 

German architects adapted the Rococo style but made it far more asymmetric and loaded with more ornate decoration than the French original.  The German style was characterized by an explosion of forms that cascaded down the walls. It featured molding formed into curves and counter-curves, twisting and turning patterns, ceilings and walls with no right angles, and stucco foliage which seemed to be creeping up the walls and across the ceiling. The decoration was often gilded or silvered to give it contrast with the white or pale pastel walls.{{Sfn|Ducher|1988|pages=150-153}}

The Belgian-born architect and designer [[François de Cuvilliés]] was one of the first to create a Rococo building in Germany, with the pavilion of [[Amalienburg]] in Munich, (1734-1739), inspired by the pavilions of the  [[Trianon]] and [[Marly]] in France. It was built as a hunting lodge, with a platform on the roof for shooting pheasants.  The Hall of Mirrors in the interior, by the painter and stucco sculptor [[Johann Baptist Zimmermann]], was far more exuberant than any French Rococo.&lt;ref&gt;Ducher, ''Caractéristique des Styles'' (1988), p. 150&lt;/ref&gt;  

Another notable example of the early German Rococo is [[Würzburg Residence]] (1737–1744) constructed for the Prince-Bishop of Wurzburg by [[Balthasar Neumann]].   Neumann had traveled to Paris and consulted with the French rocaille decorative artists [[Germain Boffrand]] and [[Robert de Cotte]].  While the exterior was in more sober Baroque style,  the interior, particularly the stairways and ceilings, was much lighter and decorative. The Prince-Bishop imported the Italian Rococo painter [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo]] in 1750–53 to create a mural over the top of the three-level ceremonial stairway. &lt;ref name="Demartini 2006 pp. 222"&gt;Prina and Demartini (2006) pp. 222–223&lt;/ref&gt;  &lt;ref&gt;https://www.bavaria.by/experiences/city-country-culture/castles-palaces/wuerzburg-residence; https://www.bavaria.by/experiences/city-country-culture/castles-palaces/wuerzburg-residence; B.M. Field ''The Worlds Greatest Architecture:  Past and Present, Regency House Publishing Ltd, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Neumann described the interior of the residence as  "a theater of light".  The stairway was also the central element in a residence Neumann  built at the [[Augustusburg and Falkenlust Palaces, Brühl|Augustusburg Palace in Brühl]] (1743–1748).  In that building the stairway led the visitors up through a stucco fantasy of paintings, sculpture, ironwork and decoration, with surprising views at every turn.&lt;ref&gt;Prina and Demartini (2006) pp. 222–223&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the 1740s and 1750s, a number of notable pilgrimage churches were constructed in [[Bavaria]], with interiors decorated in a distinctive variant of the rococo style. One of the most notable examples is the [[Wieskirche]] (1745–1754) designed by [[Dominikus Zimmermann]].   Like most of the Bavarian pilgrimage churches, the exterior is very simple, with pastel walls, and little ornament.  Entering the church the visitor encounters an astonishing theater of movement and light.  It features an oval-shaped  sanctuary, and  a deambulatory in the same form, filling in the church with light from all sides.  The white walls contrasted with columns of blue and pink stucco in the choir, and the domed ceiling surrounded by plaster angels below a dome representing the heavens crowded with colorful Biblical figures.  Other notable pilgrimage churches include the [[Basilica of the Fourteen Holy Helpers]] by [[Balthasar Neumann]] (1743–1772).{{Sfn|Ducher|1988| page=152}}{{Sfn|Cabanne|1988|pp. 89–94}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;

[[Johann Michael Fischer]] was the architect of [[Ottobeuren Abbey]] (1748–1766), another Bavarian Rococo landmark. The church features, like much of the rococo architecture in Germany,  a remarkable contrast between the regularity of the facade and the overabundance of decoration in the interior.&lt;ref name="Demartini 2006 pp. 222"/&gt;

The Russian Empress [[Catherine II of Russia|Catherine the Great]] was another admirer of the Rococo; The Golden Cabinet of the Chinese Palace in the palace complex of [[Oranienbaum, Russia|Oranienbaum]] near Saint Petersburg, designed by the Italian [[Antonio Rinaldi (architect)|Antonio Rinaldi]],  is an example of the Russian Rococo.

==Britain==
In Great Britain, rococo was called the "French taste"  and had less influence on design and the decorative arts than in continental Europe. although its influence was felt in such areas as silverwork, porcelain, and silks. [[William Hogarth]] helped develop a theoretical foundation for Rococo beauty. Though not mentioning rococo by name, he argued in his ''Analysis of Beauty'' (1753) that the undulating lines and S-curves prominent in Rococo were the basis for grace and beauty in art or nature (unlike the straight line or the circle in [[Classicism]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dummies.com/education/art-appreciation/the-rococo-influence-in-british-art/|title=The Rococo Influence in British Art - dummies|work=dummies|access-date=2017-06-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rococo was slow in arriving in England. Before entering the Rococo, British furniture for a time followed the [[neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] [[Palladian]] model under designer [[William Kent]], who designed for Lord Burlington and other important patrons of the arts. Kent travelled to Italy with Lord Burlington between 1712 and 1720, and brought back many models and ideas from Palladio.  He designed the furniture for [[Hampton Court Palace]] (1732), Lord Burlington's [[Chiswick House]] (1729), London, Thomas Coke's [[Holkham Hall]], Norfolk, Robert Walpole's pile at [[Houghton Hall|Houghton]], for [[Devonshire House]] in London, and at Rousham.{{Sfn|de Morant|1970|page=382}}

[[Mahogany]] made its appearance in England in about 1720, and immediately became popular for furniture, along with [[walnut]] wood. The Rococo began to make an appearance in England between 1740 and 1750. The furniture of [[Thomas Chippendale]] was the closest to the Rococo style,  In 1754 he published "Gentleman's and Cabinet-makers' directory", a catalog of designs for rococo, ''chinoiserie'' and even Gothic furniture, which achieved wide popularity, going through three editions.  Unlike French designers, Chippendale did not employ marquetry or inlays in his furniture.  The predominant designer of inlaid furniture were Vile and Cob, the cabinet-makers for King George III.  Another important figure in British furniture was [[Thomas Johnson (designer)|Thomas Johnson]], who in 1761,  very late in the period, published a catalog of Roroco furniture designs.  These include furnishings based on rather fantastic Chinese and Indian motifs, including a canopy bed crowned by a Chinese pagoda (now in the Victoria and Albert Museum).{{Sfn|de Morant|1970|page=383}}

Other notable figures in the British Rococo included the silversmith Charles Friedrich Kandler.

==Decline and end==
The art of [[François Boucher|Boucher]] and other painters of the period, with its emphasis on decorative mythology and gallantry, soon inspired a reaction, and a demand for more "noble" themes.  While the Rococo continued in Germany and Austria, the French Academy in Rome began to teach the classic style. This was confirmed by the nomination of [[Le Troy]] as director of the Academy in 1738, and then in 1751 by [[Charles-Joseph Natoire]].

[[Madame de Pompadour]], the mistress of Louis XV contributed to the decline of the Rococo style.  In 1750 she sent her nephew, [[Abel-François Poisson|Abel-François Poisson de Vandières]], on a two-year mission to study artistic and archeological developments in Italy.  He was accompanied by several artists, including the engraver [[Nicolas Cochin]] and the architect [[Soufflot]].  They returned to Paris with a passion for classical art. Vandiéres became the Marquis of Marigny, and was named director general of the King's Buildings. He turned official French architecture toward the neoclassical. Cochin became an important art critic;  he denounced the ''petit style'' of Boucher, and called for a grand style with a new emphasis on antiquity and nobility in the academies of painting and architecture.{{sfn|Cabanne|1988|p. 106}}

The beginning of the end for Rococo came in the early 1760s as figures like [[Voltaire]] and [[Jacques-François Blondel]] began to voice their criticism of the superficiality and degeneracy of the art. Blondel decried the "ridiculous jumble of shells, dragons, reeds, palm-trees and plants" in contemporary interiors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://digi.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/sammlung6/allg/buch.xml?docname=blondel1737]{{dead link|date=May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
By 1785, Rococo had passed out of fashion in France, replaced by the order and seriousness of Neoclassical artists like [[Jacques-Louis David]]. In Germany, late 18th-century Rococo was ridiculed as ''Zopf und Perücke'' ("pigtail and periwig"), and this phase is sometimes referred to as ''Zopfstil''. Rococo remained popular in the provinces and in Italy, until the second phase of neoclassicism, "[[Empire style]]", arrived with Napoleonic governments and swept Rococo away.

==Furniture and decoration==
The ornamental style called ''[[rocaille]]'' emerged in France between 1710 and 1750, mostly during the regency and reign of [[Louis XV]];  the style was also called ''[[Louis Quinze]]''.  Its principal characteristics were picturesque detail, curves and counter-curves, asymmetry, and a theatrical exuberance. On the walls of new Paris salons, the twisting and winding designs, usually made of gilded or painted stucco, wound around the doorways and mirrors like vines.  One of the earliest examples was the [[Hôtel Soubise]] in Paris (1704–05), with its famous oval salon decorated with paintings by Boucher, and [[Charles-Joseph Natoire]].{{Sfn|Cabanne|1988|page=102}}

The best known French furniture designer of the period was [[Juste-Aurèle Meissonnier]] (1695–1750), who was also a sculptor, painter. and goldsmith for the royal household. He held the title of official designer to the Chamber and Cabinet of Louis XV.  His work is well known today because of the enormous number of engravings made of his work which popularized the style throughout Europe. He designed works for the royal families of Poland and Portugal.

Italy was another place where the Rococo flourished, both in its early and later phases.  Craftsmen in Rome, Milan and Venice all produced lavishly decorated furniture and decorative items.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

The sculpted decoration included fleurettes, palmettes, seashells, and foliage, carved in wood. The most extravagant rocaille forms were found in the consoles, tables designed to stand against walls. The Commodes, or chests, which had first appeared under Louis XIV, were richly decorated with rocaille ornament made of gilded bronze. They were made by master craftsmen including [[Jean-Pierre Latz]] and also featured marquetry of different-coloured woods, sometimes placed in checkerboard cubic patterns, made with light and dark woods.  The period also saw the arrival of [[Chinoiserie]], often in the form of lacquered and gilded commodes, called ''falcon de Chine'' of ''Vernis Martin'', after the ebenist who introduced the technique to France. [[Ormolu]], or gilded bronze, was used by master craftsmen including [[Jean-Pierre Latz]]. Latz made a particularly ornate clock mounted atop a cartonnier for [[Frederick the Great]] for his palace in [[Potsdam]]. Pieces of [[Chinese export porcelain|imported Chinese porcelain]] were often mounted in [[ormolu]] (gilded bronze) rococo settings for display on tables or consoles in salons. Other craftsmen imitated the [[Japanese lacquer|Japanese art of lacquered furniture]], and produced commodes with Japanese motifs.{{Sfn|Ducher|1988|page=144}}

[[Great Britain|British]] Rococo tended to be more restrained. Thomas Chippendale's furniture designs kept the curves and feel, but stopped short of the French heights of whimsy. The most successful exponent of British Rococo was probably [[Thomas Johnson (designer)|Thomas Johnson]], a gifted carver and furniture designer working in London in the mid-18th century.

==Painting==
Elements of the ''Rocaille'' style appeared in the work of some French painters, including a taste for the picturesque in details; curves and counter-curves; and dissymmetry which replaced the movement of the baroque with exuberance, though the French ''rocaille'' never reached the extravagance of the Germanic rococo.{{Sfn|Cabanne|1988|page=98}}  The leading proponent was [[Antoine Watteau]], particularly in [[Embarkation for Cythera|''Pilgrimage on the Isle of Cythera'']] (1717), [[Louvre Museum|Louvre]], in a genre called ''[[Fête galante|Fête Galante]]''  depicting scenes of young nobles gathered together to celebrate in a pastoral setting.  Watteau died in 1721 at the age of thirty-seven, but his work continued to have influence through the rest of the century. The ''Pilgrimage to Cythera'' painting was purchased by [[Frederick the Great]] of Prussia in 1752 or 1765 to decorate his palace of [[Charlottenberg]] in Berlin.{{Sfn|Cabanne|1988|page=98}}

The successor of Watteau and the ''Féte Galante'' in decorative painting was [[François Boucher]] (1703–1770), the favorite painter of [[Madame de Pompadour]].  His work included the sensual ''Toilette de Venus'' (1746), which became one of the best known examples of the style.  Boucher participated in all of the genres of the time, designing tapestries, models for porcelain sculpture, set decorations for the Paris opera and ''opera-comique'', and decor for the Fair of Saint-Laurent.  {{Sfn|Cabanne|1988|page=104}} Other important painters of the ''Fête Galante'' style included [[Nicolas Lancret]] and [[Jean-Baptiste Pater]].  The style particularly influenced [[François Lemoyne]], who painted the lavish decoration of the ceiling of the Salon of Hercules at the [[Palace of Versailles]], completed in 1735.{{Sfn|Cabanne|1988|page=98}}  Paintings with fétes gallant and mythological themes by Boucher, [[Pierre-Charles Trémolières]] and [[Charles-Joseph Natoire]] decorated the famous salon of the [[Hôtel Soubise]] in Paris (1735–40).{{Sfn|Cabanne|1988|page=104}} Other Rococo painters include: [[Jean François de Troy]] (1679–1752), [[Jean-Baptiste van Loo]] (1685–1745), his two sons [[Louis-Michel van Loo]] (1707–1771) and [[Charles-Amédée-Philippe van Loo]] (1719–1795), his younger brother [[Charles-André van Loo]] (1705–1765), and [[Nicolas Lancret]] (1690–1743).

In Austria and Southern Germany, Italian painting had the largest effect on the Rococo style.  The Venetian painter [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo]], assisted by his son, [[Giovanni Domenico Tiepolo]],  was invited to paint frescoes for the [[Würzburg Residence]] (1720–1744).  The most prominent painter of Bavarian rococo churches was [[Johann Baptist Zimmermann]], who painted the ceiling of the [[Wieskirche]] (1745–1754)

==Sculpture and porcelain==

Religious sculpture followed the Italian baroque style, as exemplified in the theatrical altarpiece of the Karlskirche in Vienna.  However, much of Rococo sculpture was lighter and offered more movement than the classical style of Louis XIV.  It was encouraged in particular by [[Madame de Pompadour]], mistress of Louis XV, who commissioned many works for her chateaux and gardens. The sculptor [[Edmé Bouchardon]] represented [[Cupid]] engaged in carving his darts of love from the club of [[Hercules]] Rococo style—the demigod is transformed into the soft child, the bone-shattering club becomes the heart-scathing arrows, just as [[marble]] is so freely replaced by [[stucco]]. [[Étienne-Maurice Falconet]] (1716–1791) was another leading French sculptor during the period.  The French sculptors, [[Jean-Louis Lemoyne]], [[Jean-Baptiste Lemoyne]], [[Louis-Simon Boizot]], [[Michel Clodion]], and [[Jean-Baptiste Pigalle|Pigalle]]  were also active.  In Italy, [[Antonio Corradini]] was among the leading sculptors of the Rococo style.  A Venetian, he travelled around Europe, working for [[Peter the Great]] in St. Petersburg, for the imperial courts in Austria and Naples. He preferred sentimental themes and made several skilled works of women with faces covered by veils, one of which is now in the [[Louvre]].

A new form of small-scale sculpture appeared, the [[porcelain]] figure, or small group of figures, initially replacing sugar sculptures on grand dining room tables, but soon popular for placing on mantelpieces and furniture.  The number of European factories grew steadily through the century, and some made porcelain that the expanding middle classes could afford. The amount of colourful [[overglaze decoration]] used on them also increased.  They were usually modelled by artists who had trained in sculpture. Common subjects included figures from the [[commedia dell'arte]], city street vendors, lovers and figures in fashionable clothes, and pairs of birds.  

[[Johann Joachim Kändler]] was the most important modeller of [[Meissen porcelain]], the earliest European factory, which remained the most important until about 1760.  The Swiss-born German sculptor [[Franz Anton Bustelli]] produced a wide variety of colourful figures for the [[Nymphenburg Porcelain Manufactory]] in Bavaria, which were sold throughout Europe.  The French sculptor [[Étienne-Maurice Falconet]] (1716–1791) followed this example.  While also making large-scale works, he became director of the [[Sevres Porcelain]] manufactory and produced small-scale works, usually about love and gaiety, for production in series.

==Music==
A Rococo period existed in [[music history]], although it is not as well known as the earlier Baroque and later Classical forms. The Rococo music style itself developed out of baroque music both in France, where the new style was referred to as [[Galante music|''style galante'']] ("gallant" or "elegant" style), and in Germany, where it was referred to as ''empfindsamer Stil'' ("sensitive style"). It can be characterized as light, intimate music with extremely elaborate and refined forms of [[ornamentation (music)|ornamentation]]. Exemplars include [[Jean Philippe Rameau]], [[Louis-Claude Daquin]] and [[François Couperin]] in France; in Germany, the style's main proponents were [[C. P. E. Bach]] and [[Johann Christian Bach]], two sons of the renowned [[J.S. Bach]].

In the second half of the 18th century, a reaction against the Rococo style occurred, primarily against its perceived overuse of ornamentation and decoration. Led by [[C.P.E. Bach]] (an accomplished Rococo composer in his own right), [[Domenico Scarlatti]], and [[Christoph Willibald Gluck]], this reaction ushered in the [[Classical period (music)|Classical era]]. By the early 19th century, Catholic opinion had turned against the suitability of the style for ecclesiastical contexts because it was "in no way conducive to sentiments of devotion".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13106a.htm Rococo Style – Catholic Encyclopedia]. Newadvent.org (1912-02-01). Retrieved on 2014-02-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Russian composer of the Romantic era [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]] wrote The [[Variations on a Rococo Theme]], Op. 33, for cello and orchestra in 1877. Although the theme is not Rococo in origin, it is written in Rococo style.

== Fashion ==

A style that appeared in the early eighteenth-century was the '&lt;nowiki/&gt;''robe volante''',&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; a flowing gown, that became popular towards the end of King Louis XIV’s reign. This gown had the features of a bodice with large pleats flowing down the back to the ground over a rounded petticoat. The colour palate was rich, dark fabrics accompanied by elaborate, heavy design features. After the death of Louis XIV the clothing styles began to change. The fashion took a turn to a lighter, more frivolous style, transitioning from the baroque period to the well-known style of Rococo.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/archaeology-and-history/magazine/2016/09-10/daily-life-france-fashion-marie-antoinette/|title=Marie Antoinette's Style Revolution|last=|first=|date=|website=National Geographic|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=22 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The later period was known for their pastel colours, more revealing frocks, and the plethora of frills, ruffles, bows, and lace as trims. Shortly after the typical women’s Rococo gown was introduced, ''robe à la Françoise,'' &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; a gown with a tight bodice that had a low cut neckline, usually with a large ribbon bows down the centre front, wide panniers, and was lavishly trimmed in large amounts of lace, ribbon, and flowers.

The ''Watteau pleats'' &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; also became more popular, named after the painter Jean-Antoine Watteau, who painted the details of the gowns down to the stiches of lace and other trimmings with immense accuracy. Later, the ''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'pannier'&lt;nowiki/&gt;'' and ''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'mantua''&lt;nowiki/&gt;' became fashionable around 1718, they were wide hoops under the dress to extend the hips out sideways and they soon became a staple in formal wear. This gave the Rococo period the iconic dress of wide hips combined with the large amount of decoration on the garments. Wide panniers were worn for special occasions, and could reach up to 16 feet (4.8 metres) in diameter,&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/18sil/hd_18sil.htm|title=Eighteenth-Century Silhouette and Support|last=Glasscock|first=J.|date=|website=The Metropolitan Museum of Art|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=22 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and smaller hoops were worn for the everyday settings. These features originally came from seventeenth-century Spanish fashion, known as '''guardainfante','' initially designed to hide the pregnant stomach, then reimagined later as the pannier.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  1745 became the Golden Age of the Rococo with the introduction of a more exotic, oriental culture in France called ''‘a la turque’.''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This was made popular by Louis XV’s mistress, Madame Pompadour, who commissioned the artist, Charles Andre Van Loo, to paint her as a Turkish sultana.  
''&lt;nowiki/&gt;&lt;nowiki/&gt;&lt;nowiki/&gt;''
In the 1760s, a style of less formal dresses emerged and one of these was the '''polonaise''&lt;nowiki/&gt;', with inspiration taken from Poland. It was shorter than the French dress, allowing the underskirt and ankles to be seen, which made it easier to move around in. Another dress that came into fashion was the ''‘robe a l’anglais’'', which included elements inspired by the males’ fashion; a short jacket, broad lapels and long sleeves.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It also had a snug bodice, a full skirt without panniers but still a little long in the back to form a small train, and often some type of lace kerchief worn around the neck. Another piece was the 'redingote', halfway between a cape and an overcoat.

Accessories were also important to all women during this time, as they added to the opulence and the decor of the body to match their gowns. At any official ceremony ladies were required to cover their hands and arms with gloves if their clothes were sleeveless.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The '''Russian Academy''' or '''Imperial Russian Academy''' ({{lang-ru|Академия Российская, Императорская Российская академия}}) was established in [[St. Petersburg]], [[Russia]], in 1783 by Empress [[Catherine II of Russia]] and [[Yekaterina Romanovna Vorontsova-Dashkova|princess Dashkova]] as a research center for [[Russian language]] and [[Russian literature]], following the example of the [[Académie française]]. In 1841 it was merged into the [[Saint Petersburg Academy of Sciences|Imperial Saint Petersburg Academy of Sciences]] (the predecessor of today's Russian Academy of Sciences).

'''School transitions''' are the conversions students go through as they change schools throughout their lives.  These transitions play a major role in the development of young people’s decisions and serve as a milestone which can direct them in a number of ways.  There are two main types of school transitions: normative school transitions and non-normative school transitions or transfers.&lt;ref name="Frisco"&gt;[http://www.blackwellreference.com/subscriber/tocnode?id=g9781405124331_chunk_g978140512433125_ss1-24] Frisco, Michelle L. "School Transitions." Blackwell Encyclopedia of Sociology. Ritzer, George (Ed). Blackwell Publishing, 2007. Blackwell Reference Online. 13 November 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Normative school transitions==
Normative school transitions refer to the transitions of students from elementary school to middle school and from middle school to high school.  As each transition occurs, the student generally undergoes many different changes.  These changes can be anything from an increase in the size of the school, to the change in friends that one meets.  Every student adapts to normative transitions differently and there are a multitude of things that influence how easily or poorly they adapt.  Race, gender, location, age, and academic ability all affect the transition.&lt;ref name="Frisco"/&gt;  According to Karen Könings from [[Maastricht University]], the expectations students have when arriving to a new school are widely influential to how they will perform.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdf?vid=4&amp;hid=3&amp;sid=db29e9ac-a2ca-42c9-987d-246c656e9481%40sessionmgr3] Könings, Karen, Saskia Brand-Gruwel, Jeroen Van Merriënboer, and Nick Broers. "Does a new learning environment come up to students' expectations? A longitudinal study." Journal of Educational Psychology 100 (2008): 535-48. PsycINFO. Academic Search Premier.&lt;/ref&gt;  Often it is among the first few weeks that students build the relationships and networks that collectively form these expectations.

==Non-normative school transitions/transfers==
School transfers refer to any transition in schooling when a child is moved from one school to another between normative transfers.  These transitions are less common than normative school transitions but still happen fairly often.  Often people end up making non-normative school transitions by participating in what is called the [[school choice]] program.&lt;ref name="Frisco"/&gt;  This is a policy used by some school systems that spend public funds to give parents and students more of a say in their education.  School choice often gives participants a variety of different types of schools to choose from including different charter schools, magnet programs, and tax credits for private schools.  While choice schooling has seemed to cause a large increase in scores for private schooling, its effects on public schools tends to show less improvement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blackwellreference.com/subscriber/tocnode?id=g9781405124331_chunk_g978140512433125_ss1-20] Davies, Scott. "School Choice." Blackwell Encyclopedia of Sociology. Ritzer, George (Ed). Blackwell Publishing, 2007. Blackwell Reference Online. 13 November 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  Some believe that these problems in the public schools are actually a sign of increasing inequality.  While choice schooling has made it both financially and institutionally easier for people to choose where they would like to attend school, many of the [[Working class|lower class]] families don’t have the resources to send their children to the farther away magnet schools or private schools.  In most cases, the lower class parents send their children to the nearest school because there is a bus to pick them up.  The wealthier families on the other hand tend to take advantage of the choice program and are able to attend the private schools and higher-rated public schools outside of the city.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15909">{{Canadian Charter}}
'''Section 23''' of the ''[[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]]'' is the section of the [[Constitution of Canada]] that guarantees [[minority language]] [[education in Canada|educational]] rights to [[French language|French]]-speaking communities outside [[Quebec]], and, to a lesser extent, [[English language|English]]-speaking minorities in Quebec.  The section may be particularly notable, in that some scholars believe that section 23 "was the only part of the Charter with which [[Pierre Trudeau]] was truly concerned."&lt;ref name="Dyck"&gt;Dyck, Rand. Canadian Politics: Critical Approaches. Third ed. (Scarborough, Ontario: Nelson Thomson Learning, 2000), p. 442.&lt;/ref&gt;  Trudeau was the [[prime minister of Canada|prime minister]] who fought for the inclusion of the ''Charter of Rights'' in the [[Constitution of Canada]] in 1982.

Section 23(1)(b), or section 23 as a whole, are also known as the "'''Canada clause'''."&lt;ref name="Dyck"/&gt;

==Text==
Under the heading "Minority Language Educational Rights," the section reads,

{{cquote|23.(1)  Citizens of Canada
:(a)  whose first language learned and still understood is that of the English or French linguistic minority population of the province in which they reside, or
:(b)  who have received their primary school instruction in Canada in English or French and reside in a province where the language in which they received that instruction is the language of the English or French linguistic minority population of the province,
have the right to have their children receive primary and secondary school instruction in that language in that province.

(2)  Citizens of Canada of whom any child has received or is receiving primary or secondary school instruction in English or French in Canada, have the right to have all their children receive primary and secondary school instruction in the same language.

(3)  The right of citizens of Canada under subsections (1) and (2) to have their children receive primary and secondary school instruction in the language of the English or French linguistic minority population of a province
:(a)  applies wherever in the province the number of children of citizens who have such a right is sufficient to warrant the provision to them out of public funds of minority language instruction; and
:(b)  includes, where the number of those children so warrants, the right to have them  receive that instruction in minority language educational facilities provided out of public funds.}}

Section 23 must be read in conjunction with Section 59 of the [[Constitution Act, 1982]]:

{{cquote|59. (1) Paragraph 23(1)(a) shall come into force in respect of Quebec on a day to be fixed by proclamation issued by the Queen or the Governor General under the Great Seal of Canada.

(2) A proclamation under subsection (1) shall be issued only where authorized by the legislative assembly or government of Quebec.  
 
(3) This section may be repealed on the day paragraph 23(1)(a) comes into force in respect of Quebec and this Act amended and renumbered, consequentially upon the repeal of this section, by proclamation issued by the Queen or the Governor General under the Great Seal of Canada.}}

==History==
[[File:Pierre Elliot Trudeau-2.jpg|right|thumb|[[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Pierre Trudeau]] was a major advocate of section 23 and minority language education.]]
As a strong [[Canadian federalism|federalist]], Trudeau had fought to ensure linguistic rights in the constitution to promote national unity.  Section 23 (1)(b) had its origins in a unanimous agreement between the provincial leaders and Trudeau reached in 1978 in [[St. Andrews, New Brunswick]], in which children of citizens could receive schooling in their language.&lt;ref&gt;Hogg, Peter W.  ''Canada Act 1982 Annotated.''  Toronto:  The Carswell Company Limited, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;  When this idea was brought to the Charter in the 1980s, Trudeau also successfully secured agreement from provincial leaders that section 23 could not be nullified by the [[Section Thirty-three of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 33]] notwithstanding clause.

When the government of Quebec had passed the ''[[Charter of the French Language]]'' in 1977, only parents who had gone to English schools in Quebec could have their children educated in English.  Concerns for the erosion of the educational rights of [[English-speaking Quebecer|English-speaking Quebeckers]] thus led to section 23(1)(b) being written so that that part of the Quebec law would become unconstitutional.&lt;ref name="Dyck"/&gt;  This portion of the Charter of the French Language was indeed struck down by the courts in ''[[Attorney General of Quebec v. Quebec Protestant School Boards]]'' (1984).  The verdict prompted the passing of Bill 86 in 1993 which amended the Charter of the French Language, stating that any child of a Canadian citizen whose parent or sibling had received English-medium education in ''Canada'' (rather than Quebec specifically) could attend English-medium schools&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bibliotheque.assnat.qc.ca/guides/fr/charte-de-la-langue-francaise/1968-1993-projet-de-loi-86?ref=439#fragment5261|title=1993 - Projet de loi 86 - Bibliothèque de l’Assemblée nationale du Québec - Guides thématiques|website=www.bibliotheque.assnat.qc.ca|language=fr|access-date=2018-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

While there was decreased minority language education in Quebec at the time when the ''Charter'' was adopted, several other provinces (where [[English Canadian]]s were the majority) had no French language schools at all.  In contrast, in 2005 all provinces had minority language education schools.  In 1986, 152,225 [[French Canadian]] students outside of Quebec were going to French-language schools in accordance with section 23, and in 2001 the number was 149,042.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mapleleafweb.com/features/cultural/bilingualism/impact.html |title=The Impact of Official Bilingualism |last=Parkinson |first=Rhonda Lauret |publisher=Mapleleafweb, [[University of Lethbridge]] |date=April 20, 2005 |accessdate=23 April 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060512204440/http://www.mapleleafweb.com/features/cultural/bilingualism/impact.html |archivedate=12 May 2006 |deadurl=bot: unknown |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been some roadblocks to minority-language education since the Charter came into effect, such as a need for more French-speaking teachers and decreased enrollment in English-language education in rural Quebec, as well as challenges from both francophone and anglophone minority parents that education of equal quality is not being provided by their provincial government. The relative lack of French-language post secondary education opportunities (colleges and universities) outside of Quebec influences the choice of some French Canadian students to switch English language instruction, especially as they advance towards the end of their compulsory education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mapleleafweb.com/features/cultural/bilingualism/ground.html |title=Bilingualism Loses Ground |last=Parkinson |first=Rhonda Lauret |publisher=Mapleleafweb, [[University of Lethbridge]] |date=April 10, 2005 |accessdate=23 April 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060512204457/http://www.mapleleafweb.com/features/cultural/bilingualism/ground.html |archivedate=12 May 2006 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The rights of official language minority students remains a topic contested in provincial and federal courts, with funding for legal costs for court actions being provided by federal governments Court Challenges Program.

==Application==
[[File:Ecole de l anse au sable.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[L'Anse-au-sable]], a French language school in [[Kelowna, British Columbia]].  Its school board [[Conseil scolaire francophone de la Colombie-Britannique]] helps ensure those with section 23 rights receive minority language education.&lt;ref&gt;District Review Report, School District No. 93 (Conseil scolaire francophone) April 4–8, 2005, submitted to the Minister of Education, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Section 23 is a [[negative and positive rights|positive right]]. It has been found that section 23 thus guards against linguistic minorities being assimilated if their educational rights are denied for a long period of time, and this has led to [[Section Twenty-four of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 24]] of the ''Charter'', which provides remedies for rights infringements, to be applied flexibly and creatively.  For example, in ''[[Doucet-Boudreau v. Nova Scotia (Minister of Education)]]'' (2003), it was found that the government could be forced to report to a judge as construction on schools progressed, in order to ensure the schools were built within a sufficient amount of time.

While much of section 23 can apply to Quebec, section 59 of the ''[[Constitution Act, 1982]]'' states that section 23(1)(a) is of no force or effect there. This was a conciliatory gesture made by the authors of the ''Charter'' which failed to obtain Quebec's agreement to the constitutional changes in 1982. This provision will not be valid in Quebec until the provincial government chooses to ratify it. 


===Sufficient numbers===
While section 23 guarantees its rights to Canadian citizens who are also [[parent]]s, as long as they speak English or French as a minority, the ability to exercise this right to send one's child to minority language education is limited by the possibility that the minority language community in which one lives may be too small.  Sections 23(3)(a) and (b) state the "number of children" must be "sufficient to warrant" government spending for either schooling or the building of [[school]] facilities.

These limits were defined by the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] in the 1990 case ''[[Mahe v. Alberta]]''.  The Court declared that section 23 guaranteed a "sliding scale."  In certain circumstances, the children whose parents could exercise the right might be so few that literally no minority language education may be provided by the government.  With a greater number of children, some schools might be required to provide [[classroom]]s in which the children could receive minority language education.  An even greater number would require the [[construction]] of new schools dedicated solely to minority language education. 

The Court also ruled that the right to "facilities" in section 23(3)(b) could include more than classrooms and schools.  Namely, a large number of children could mandate that minority language schools have their own [[school board]]s.  Somewhere between the right to a school and a right to a school board was a right for the minority language community to have some members on a larger school board.

In the case ''[[Arsenault-Cameron v. Prince Edward Island]]'' (2000), the Court further defined sufficient numbers.  As 49 French Canadian children were ready for minority language instruction in [[Summerside, Prince Edward Island]], it was argued by the province that a number this low would only require [[school bus]]es to transport them to a nearby French language school, rather than the construction of a separate school.  The Court, however, ruled that if a new school were actually built, it could draw in more people than those whose families had previously expressed interest, and thus the number could be somewhat fewer than 100.  While even a school this small might struggle with providing certain educational services, protecting the culture of the minority language community was considered too important and the number of students was ruled sufficient for the building of a new school.

===Manitoba===
The decision to allow for Minority education rights (according to legal decisions based on Article 23) along a sliding scale had already been nascent in Manitoba and was foreshadowed by the Laurier-Greenway compromise of 1896.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} This compromise came in response to what was argued to be unconstitutional provincial school legislation (Schools Act 1890) in relation to the constitutionally entrenched Manitoba Act of 1870. In Manitoba where the Public Schools Act had been reformed along the lines of minority vs majority language rights and a changing population proportion of English to French (where English speakers out-numbered French by the 1890s), the Laurier-Greenway compromise allowed for a school district in a community by community basis to offer French language instruction if the French population was large enough and requested such instruction.

In 1916 under Premier T.C. Norris the prior compromise was rescinded and the Franco-Manitoban minority lost their right to receive instruction in French in Manitoba's public schools. Section 93 of the BNA act(1867) in the Province's opinion had been contravened with the Laurier-Greenway Compromise and no longer had legal standing. Moreover, in section 93 of the BNA the province had ultimate authority to decide on minority language instruction. The latter remained status-quo until two changes were made to Manitoba's Public School Act (PSA) in 1966 and 1970 when French language instruction was once again recognized as an official language of instruction.

Manitoba's minority French language instruction rights have developed since the introduction of the Charter and Section 23 to a point where they have allowed for the inclusion of a separate school board ([[Division Scolaire Franco-Manitobaine|La Division Scolaire Franco-Manitobaine]] DSFM) which is fully funded by the provincial treasury and operates throughout the Province. Significant with regards to the Province's (Manitoba) interpretation of section 23 is how the "number of Students" and not "mother tongue" is the basis upon which French language (minority) instruction rights are respected. Minority language instruction in Manitoba is in transition and still presents various legal issues and related constitutionally charged questions (see [[Manitoba Act 1870]], [[Louis Riel]], [[Manitoba Schools Question]], Laurier-Greenway Compromise).

[[File:Serpentine lines from William Hogarth's The Analysis of Beauty.jpg|thumbnail|right|Serpentine lines in a plate from ''[[The Analysis of Beauty]]'' by [[William Hogarth]].]]

A '''serpentine shape''' is any of certain curved shapes of an object or design, which are suggestive of the shape of a [[snake]] (the adjective "serpentine" is derived from the word ''serpent''). Serpentine shapes occur in architecture, in furniture, and in mathematics.

==In architecture and urban design==
[[File:Serpentine wall UVa daffodils 2010.jpg|thumb|[[Serpentine wall]]s at the [[University of Virginia]].]]
[[File:San Carlo alle Quattro Fontane.jpg|thumb|upright|[[San Carlo alle Quattro Fontane]] (Four Fountains) facade in Rome, Italy.]]

The serpentine shape is observed in many architectural settings. It may provide strength, as in [[serpentine wall]]s, it may allow the facade of a building to face in multiple directions, or it may be chosen for purely aesthetic reasons.

*At the [[University of Virginia]], [[serpentine wall]]s ([[crinkle crankle wall]]s) extend down the length of the main lawn at the University of Virginia and flank both sides of the rotunda. They are one of the many structures Thomas Jefferson created that combine aesthetics with utility. The sinusoidal path of the wall provides strength against toppling over, allowing the wall to be only a single brick thick.
*At the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], the [[List of Massachusetts Institute of Technology undergraduate dormitories#Baker House|Baker House]] dormitory has a serpentine shape which allows most rooms a view of the [[Charles River]], and gives many of the rooms a wedge-shaped layout.&lt;ref&gt;Lester Wertheimer (2004), ''Architectural History'', Kaplan AEC Architecture, [https://books.google.com/books?id=jeSoxaoOqOQC&amp;pg=PA123 p. 123].&lt;/ref&gt;
*At [[San Carlo alle Quattro Fontane]], Rome, Italy (The Church of Saint Charles at the Four Fountains), designed by [[Francesco Borromini]], is a serpentine facade constructed towards the end of Borromini's life. The concave-convex facade of the church undulates in a non-classic way. Tall corinthian columns stand on plinths and support the main entablatures; these define the main framework of two stories and the tripartite bay division. Between the columns, smaller columns with their entablatures weave behind the main columns and in turn they frame many architectural features of the church.
*The London parks [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]] and [[Kensington Gardens]] contain '[[Serpentine (lake)|The Serpentine]]', a lake that spans both parks. It received the name from its snake-like, curving shape. A central bridge divides the lake into two parts, and defines the boundaries between Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens.&lt;ref&gt;"Hyde Park History &amp; Architecture". The Royal Parks. 2007. Retrieved 2012-03-29.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Among [[Castle Howard]]'s gardens is a large, formal path behind the building, where a serpentine path is situated on a ridge. It opens out from the formal garden and merges back into the park. When buildings and site elements are set into the landscape, a serpentine path connecting every location is placed in-between features. The path merges into the landscape due to the natural shape, which allows convenient garden-path integration.
*A '''serpentine street''' is a winding roadway sometimes used to slow traffic in residential neighbourhoods, possibly bordered by landscaping features.&lt;ref&gt;US Federal Highway Administration (2002), ''Pedestrian Facilities Users Guide'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=9NhbCEycd2kC&amp;pg=PA80 p. 80].&lt;/ref&gt;

==In furniture==
[[File:Serpentine-Front Sideboard LACMA M.90.211.jpg|thumb|A serpentine-front sideboard (United States,1785-1800).]]

In furniture, '''serpentine-front''' dressers and cabinets have a convex section between two concave ones.&lt;ref&gt;''Popular Science'', Feb 1932, [https://books.google.com/books?id=4CcDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA100 p. 100].&lt;/ref&gt; This design was common in the [[Rococo]] period.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Boyce (2013), ''Dictionary of Furniture: Third Edition'', Skyhorse Publishing, [https://books.google.com/books?id=plFlAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT664 p. 664].&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include Louis XV commodes and 18th-century English furniture.&lt;ref&gt;Holly, "[http://www.thingsthatinspire.net/2007/08/serpentine-shape.html Things that inspire]", August 12, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Furniture with a concave section between two convex ones is sometimes referred to as reverse serpentine or oxbow.&lt;ref&gt;Chuck Bender, "[http://360woodworking.com/the-oxbow-or-reverse-serpentine-chest/ The oxbow, or reverse serpentine, chest], April 24, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Charles Boyce (2013), ''Dictionary of Furniture: Third Edition'', Skyhorse Publishing, [https://books.google.com/books?id=plFlAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT536 p. 536].&lt;/ref&gt;

== In mathematics ==
{{main|Serpentine curve}}

[[File:Britannica Serpentine.png|thumb|The [[serpentine curve]].]]
The serpentine curve is a cubic curve as described by Isaac Newton, given by the cartesian equation ''y''(''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''abx''.
The origin is a point of inflection, the axis of ''x'' being an [[asymptote]] and the curve lies between the parallel lines 2''y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;±''b''.

'''Smart materials''', called also intelligent or responsive materials,&lt;ref&gt; Smart Materials Book Series Royal Society of Chemistry , Cambridge UK, http://pubs.rsc.org/bookshop/collections/series?issn=2046-0066 &lt;/ref&gt;  are designed materials that have one or more properties that can be significantly changed in a controlled fashion by external stimuli, such as [[stress (physics)|stress]], [[temperature]], moisture, [[pH]], [[electric field|electric]] or [[magnetic field|magnetic]] fields, light, or chemical compounds. Smart materials are the basis of many applications, including [[sensors]] and [[actuators]], or [[artificial muscles]], particularly as [[electroactive polymers]] (EAPs).&lt;ref&gt; M.Shahinpoor  and  H.-J. Schneider, Eds.  ''Intelligent Materials''; Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge UK, 2007.http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/eBook/978-0-85404-335-4 &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; M. Schwartz, Ed. ''Smart Materials'', CRC Press Boca Raton 2008,https://www.crcpress.com/Smart-Materials/Schwartz/p/book/9781420043723 &lt;/ref&gt; 
  
Terms used to describe smart materials include '''shape memory material''' (SMM) and '''shape memory technology''' (SMT).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mohd Jani|first1=Jaronie|last2=Leary|first2=Martin|last3=Subic|first3=Aleksandar|last4=Gibson|first4=Mark A.|title=A review of shape memory alloy research, applications and opportunities|journal=Materials &amp; Design|date=April 2014|volume=56|pages=1078–1113|doi=10.1016/j.matdes.2013.11.084}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==

There are a number of types of smart material, of which are already common. Some examples are as following:
* [[Piezoelectricity|Piezoelectric]] materials are materials that produce a voltage when stress is applied. Since this effect also applies in a reverse manner, a voltage across the sample will produce stress within sample. Suitably designed structures made from these materials can, therefore, be made that bend, expand or contract when a voltage is applied.
*[[Shape-memory_alloy|Shape-memory alloys]] and [[shape-memory polymer]]s are materials in which large deformation can be induced and recovered through temperature changes or stress changes ([[pseudoelasticity]]). The shape memory effect results due to respectively martensitic phase change and induced elasticity at higher temperatures.
* [[Photovoltaics|Photovoltaic]] materials or [[optoelectronics]] convert light to electrical current.
* [[Electroactive polymers]] (EAPs) change their volume by voltage or electric fields.  
* [[Magnetostriction|Magnetostrictive]] materials exhibit a change in shape under the influence of magnetic field and also exhibit a change in their magnetization under the influence of mechanical stress.
* [[Magnetic shape memory]] alloys are materials that change their shape in response to a significant change in the magnetic field.
* [[Smart inorganic polymers]] showing tunable and responsive properties.
* [[pH-sensitive polymers]] are materials that change in volume when the pH of the surrounding medium changes.
* [[Temperature-responsive polymers]] are materials which undergo changes upon temperature.
* [[Halochromism|Halochromic]] materials are commonly used materials that change their color as a result of changing acidity. One suggested application is for paints that can change color to indicate [[corrosion]] in the metal underneath them.
* [[chromism|Chromogenic systems]] change color in response to electrical, optical or thermal changes. These include [[electrochromic]] materials, which change their colour or opacity on the application of a voltage (e.g., [[liquid crystal display]]s), [[thermochromic]] materials change in colour depending on their temperature, and [[photochromic]] materials, which change colour in response to light—for example, light-sensitive [[sunglasses]] that darken when exposed to bright sunlight.
* [[Ferrofluid]]
* [[Photomechanical effect|Photomechanical materials]] change shape under exposure to light.
* [[Polycaprolactone]] (polymorph) can be molded by immersion in hot water.
* [[Self-healing material]]s have the intrinsic ability to repair damage due to normal usage, thus expanding the material's lifetime.
* [[Dielectric elastomers]] (DEs) are smart material systems which produce large strains (up to 500%) under the influence of an external electric field.
* [[Magnetocaloric effect|Magnetocaloric materials]] are compounds that undergo a reversible change in temperature upon exposure to a changing magnetic field.
* [[Thermoelectric materials]] are used to build devices that [[Thermoelectric effect|convert temperature differences into electricity and vice versa]].
* [[Chemoresponsive materials]] change size or volume under the influence of external chemical or biological compound.&lt;ref&gt; ''Chemoresponsive Materials  /Stimulation by Chemical and Biological Signals'', Schneider, H.-J. ; Ed:,   ('''2015''')''The Royal Society of Chemistry,'' Cambridge https://dx.doi.org/10.1039/9781782622420 &lt;/ref&gt;

Smart materials have properties that react to changes in their environment. This means that one of their properties can be changed by an external condition, such as temperature, light, pressure, electricity, voltage, pH, or chemical compounds. This change is reversible and can be repeated many times.
There is a wide range of different smart materials. Each offer different properties that can be changed. Some materials are very good indeed and cover a huge range of the scales.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3322">'''The Immanent Frame''' is a digital forum that publishes interdisciplinary perspectives on [[secularism]], [[religion]], and the [[public sphere]]. It was formed in conjunction with projects on [http://www.ssrc.org/programs/religion-and-the-public-sphere/ religion and the public sphere] at the [[Social Science Research Council]] (SSRC).  Initially conceived as an experimental blog that invited multiple contributions from a number of leading scholars in the humanities and social sciences, The Immanent Frame was launched in October 2007 by an SSRC team led by program director [http://blogs.ssrc.org/tif/author/vanantwerpen/ Jonathan VanAntwerpen], who served for several years as editor-in-chief.

Among other topics, The Immanent Frame launched with an extensive discussion of [[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]]'s ''[[A Secular Age]]'' ([[Harvard University Press]], 2007). Sociologist [[Robert Bellah]] called ''A Secular Age'' "one of the most important books to be written in my lifetime."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ssrc.org/blogs/immanent_frame/2007/10/19/secularism-of-a-new-kind/ The Immanent Frame: Secularism of a new kind]&lt;/ref&gt; The Immanent Frame's discussion of Taylor's book included original contributions by [[Robert Bellah]], [[Wendy Brown (political scientist)|Wendy Brown]], [[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]], and several others. The name of the digital forum itself alludes to a central concept in Taylor's book.

Additional contributors to The Immanent Frame have included: [[Arjun Appadurai]], [[Talal Asad]], [[Rajeev Bhargava]], [[Akeel Bilgrami]], José Casanova, [[Craig Calhoun]], [[Dipesh Chakrabarty]], [[William E. Connolly]], [[Veena Das]], [[Hent de Vries]], [[Wendy Doniger]], [[Simon During]], [[John Esposito]], [[Nilüfer Göle]], [[David Hollinger]], [[Mark Juergensmeyer]], [[Mark Lilla]], Kathryn Lofton, [[Tanya Luhrmann]], [[Saba Mahmood]], [[Martin E. Marty]], [[Tomoko Masuzawa]], [[Russell T. McCutcheon]], [[Birgit Meyer]], [[John Milbank]], John Lardas Modern, [[Tariq Modood]], Jean-Claude Monod, [[Ebrahim Moosa]], [[Samuel Moyn]], [[Robert Orsi]], [[Ann Pellegrini]], [[Elizabeth Povinelli]], [[Vijay Prashad]], [[Robert D. Putnam]], Olivier Roy, [[Joan Wallach Scott]], [[Jonathan Z. Smith]], [[Judith Stacey]], [[Alfred Stepan]], Winnifred Fallers Sullivan, [[Mark C. Taylor]], [[Peter van der Veer]], [[Michael Warner]], [[Nicholas Wolterstorff]], [[Molly Worthen]], and many others.

In 2016, The Immanent Frame established its first editorial board. Board members include sociologist Courtney Bender, political scientist Elizabeth Shakman Hurd, and anthropologist [[Saba Mahmood]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.ssrc.org/tif/2016/03/14/new-editorial-board/ The Immanent Frame: New editorial board]&lt;/ref&gt;

The game plays very similarly to the original ''[[Trails of Cold Steel]]'' game,  playing as a traditional [[JRPG]] with [[turn-based]] battles.&lt;ref name="RPGFan1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rpgfan.com/reviews/The_Legend_of_Heroes_Trails_of_Cold_Steel_II/index.html|title=The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel II Review|author=Hagues, Alana|publisher=RPGFan|date=6 September 2016|accessdate=24 September 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151124203338/http://www.rpgfan.com/reviews/The_Legend_of_Heroes_Trails_of_Cold_Steel_II/index.html|archivedate=24 September 2016|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game is not, however, tied to the school schedule structure of the original, with the game now centered around traveling the world rather than attending classes.&lt;ref name="RPGamer1"&gt;http://www.rpgamer.com/games/loh/lohsnk2/reviews/lohsnk2strev1.html&lt;/ref&gt; If the player has a completed game save file from completing the prior game, it has an effect on the game of ''Cold Steel II'', with certain events and dialogues playing out different based on choices and relationships built in the prior game.&lt;ref name="Siliconera1"&gt;http://www.siliconera.com/2016/08/25/europe-gets-legend-heroes-trails-cold-steel-ii-november-11-2016/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
The game is a direct sequel to the original ''Trails of Cold Steel'', picking up one month after ending of that game,&lt;ref name="hardcoregamer1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hardcoregamer.com/2016/09/07/review-the-legend-of-heroes-trails-of-cold-steel-ii/223460/ |title=Review: The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel II |publisher=[[Hardcore Gamer]] |date=2016-09-07 |accessdate=2016-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; with Rean having escaped with the Divine Knight, Valimar. He makes it to his hometown of Ymir with the assistance of bracer Toval, where Princess Alfin had also escaped to, but is later kidnapped along with Rean's sister Elise by members of the Noble Alliance. Students from Thors Military Academy, including those from Class VII, had been scattered across the country, so Rean attempts to get everyone back together again to put an end to the civil war.

==Development==
''Cold Steel II'' uses the [[PhyreEngine]] [[game engine]], and was released in Japan on September 25, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Wong |first1=Alistair |title=Sony’s PhyreEngine Is Now Supported By Nintendo Switch |url=http://www.siliconera.com/2018/01/18/sonys-phyreengine-now-supported-nintendo-switch/ |website=Siliconera |accessdate=13 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://gematsu.com/2014/04/legend-heroes-sen-kiseki-ii-dated-japan&lt;/ref&gt; The game was localized into English by [[Xseed Games]].&lt;ref name="Sili2"&gt;http://www.siliconera.com/2016/01/11/legend-heroes-trails-cold-steel-iis-translation-95-complete/&lt;/ref&gt; Work on translating the game began on February 2015, containing around 1.45 million characters to be translated.&lt;ref name="Sili2"/&gt; Translating alone took around a year, with it being about 95% complete in January 2016.&lt;ref name="Sili2"/&gt; Xseed also added approximately 11,000 lines of English dialogue for its English release.

The game received "generally favorable" reception, according to [[review aggregator]] [[Metacritic]].&lt;ref name="metaPS3"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-3/the-legend-of-heroes-trails-of-cold-steel-ii |title=The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel II for PlayStation 3 Reviews |website=[[Metacritic]] |accessdate=2 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="metaPSV"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-vita/the-legend-of-heroes-trails-of-cold-steel-ii |title=The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel II for PlayStation Vita Reviews |website=[[Metacritic]] |accessdate=2 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="metaPC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/the-legend-of-heroes-trails-of-cold-steel-ii |title=The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel II for PC Reviews |website=[[Metacritic]] |accessdate=2 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chris Shrive of [[Hardcore Gamer]] strongly praised the game for being "a modern JRPG masterpiece" with "the perfect blend of the classic JRPG formula mixed with contemporary features" concluding that "the emphasis on story telling and immense cast of memorable characters make the large time commitment worthwhile."&lt;ref name="hardcoregamer1"/&gt; Kimberly Wallace of [[Game Informer]] was similarly positive about the game's story and characters, but complained of the game's dull dungeons design. Despite the shortcomings, she still felt that the game "takes the cast and story in such interesting directions and provides so much to do that it’s hard to put down...[the game] makes me care so much about the characters and the world that it becomes easier to look past its flaws."&lt;ref name="GameInformer1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gameinformer.com/games/the_legend_of_heroes_trails_of_cold_steel_ii/b/playstation_vita/archive/2016/09/07/continuing-to-impress-and-surprise.aspx|title=Continuing To Impress And Surprise - The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel II - Vita - www.GameInformer.com|work=www.GameInformer.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Darren McPhail of RPGSite was similarly positive about the game, stating "For fans of the previous ''Legend of Heroes'' games and especially the first ''Trails of Cold Steel'', picking up ''Trails of Cold Steel 2'' is a no-brainer easy recommendation. While this sequel is unevenly paced and lacks shocking plot twists until the conclusion, the ''Trails of Cold Steel'' games are some of the best of the genre and well worth a look for most hardcore RPG fans."&lt;ref name="RPGSite1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rpgsite.net/review/5061-the-legend-of-heroes-trails-of-cold-steel-ii-video-review|title=RPGSite &gt; Review &gt; The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel II|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; All three reviewers agreed that, while it was possible to enjoy the game's story as a stand-alone experience, the story was better for people who had played the original ''Trails of Cold Steel'' first, due to the game's direct ties to one another.&lt;ref name="hardcoregamer1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GameInformer1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RPGSite1"/&gt;

In Japan, the game sold 86,283 physical retail copies on the PlayStation Vita and 65,498 retail copies on the PlayStation 3 within its debut release week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siliconera.com/2014/10/03/trails-flash-ii-sold-nearly-amount-predecessor/|title=Trails in the Flash II Sold Nearly The Same Amount As Its Predecessor|date=October 3, 2014|work=|publisher=Siliconera|accessdate=October 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within that week, the Vita version placed second among all software sales in Japan, while the PS3 version placed fifth.&lt;ref&gt;2014-10-01, [http://gematsu.com/2014/10/media-create-sales-92214-92814 Media Create Sales: 9/22/14 – 9/28/14] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150131192732/http://gematsu.com/2014/10/media-create-sales-92214-92814 |date=2015-01-31 }}, Gematsu&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Famitsu]]'' gave both versions of the game a review score of 31/40.&lt;ref name="fam"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Famitsu Review Scores: Issue 1346|url = https://gematsu.com/2014/09/famitsu-review-scores-issue-1346|website = Gematsu|publisher =|accessdate = 2014-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The PlayStation 4 version sold 11,345 copies during its first week on sale in Japan, placing it at number ten on the all format sales chart. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Romano |first=Sal |date=May 23, 2018 |url=https://gematsu.com/2018/05/media-create-sales-5-14-18-5-20-18 |title=Media Create Sales: 5/14/18 – 5/20/18 |publisher=Gematsu |accessdate=May 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Mighty Boosh''' is a British comedy troupe featuring comedians [[Julian Barratt]] and [[Noel Fielding]]. Developed from three stage shows and a six-episode [[The Boosh (radio series)|radio series]], it has since spawned a total of 20 television episodes for [[BBC Three]] which aired from 2003 to 2007, and two live tours of the UK, as well as two live shows in the United States. The first television series is set in a zoo operated by Bob Fossil, the second in a flat and the third in a second hand shop in [[Dalston]] called Nabootique.

Various members of The Mighty Boosh have appeared in a number of different comedy series including ''[[Nathan Barley]]'', ''[[Snuff Box]]'' and ''[[Noel Fielding's Luxury Comedy]]'', and regular Boosh collaborators included [[Richard Ayoade]] and [[Matt Berry]]. The troupe is named after a childhood hairstyle of co-star [[Michael Fielding]].&lt;ref name="naming"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZ0Gondz_0g&amp;feature=relmfu |title=How The Mighty Boosh got its name&amp;nbsp;– Exclusive Mike Fielding Interview&amp;nbsp;– BBC |publisher=Youtube.com |date=25 June 2009 |accessdate=7 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Fielding first met Barratt after seeing him perform his solo stand-up routine at the Hellfire Comedy Club in the [[Wycombe Swan]] Theatre,&lt;ref name=booshnight&gt;{{cite episode| title = The Mighty Boosh: A Journey Through Time and Space| series = The Mighty Boosh| serieslink = The Mighty Boosh (TV series)| airdate = 22 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[High Wycombe]], [[Buckinghamshire]]. The pair soon found that they shared comic interests, formed a [[double act]], and "decided to be the new [[The Goodies|Goodies]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last = Raphael | first = Amy | title = Boys from the Boosh | publisher = ''[[The Observer]]'' | date = 21 October 2007 | url = http://observer.guardian.co.uk/magazine/story/0,,2193898,00.html | accessdate = 29 March 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After their first performance together at a bar, De Hems, in [[London]] in April 1998, Barratt and Fielding developed their [[zookeeper]] characters – [[List of recurring characters from The Mighty Boosh#Howard Moon|Howard Moon]] and [[List of recurring characters from The Mighty Boosh#Vince Noir|Vince Noir]], respectively – in a series of sketches for [[Paramount Comedy]]’s ''[[Unnatural Acts (TV series)|Unnatural Acts]]''. Here they also met American [[Rich Fulcher]], who became [[List of recurring characters from The Mighty Boosh#Bob Fossil|Bob Fossil]]. Fielding’s friend [[Dave Brown (comedian)|Dave Brown]] and Fielding's brother [[Michael Fielding|Michael]] also became regular collaborators. [[Richard Ayoade]] was another original cast member, playing adventurer [[List of recurring characters from The Mighty Boosh#Dixon Bainbridge|Dixon Bainbridge]], but [[Matt Berry]] replaced him in the first television series, since Ayoade was under contract with [[Channel 4]].&lt;ref&gt;''Inside the Zooniverse'', The Mighty Boosh: Series 1, BBCDVD1553.&lt;/ref&gt; Ayoade returned in the second and third series as a belligerent [[shaman]] named [[List of recurring The Mighty Boosh characters#Saboo|Saboo]].
Noel Fielding and Michael Fielding have each separately stated that the name "Mighty Boosh" was originally a phrase used by a friend of Michael's to describe the hair that Michael had as a child.&lt;ref name="naming" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Interview with Noel Fielding on [[Friday Night with Jonathan Ross]] on 10 November 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The Boosh produced 3 stage shows – ''[[The Mighty Boosh (1998 stage show)|The Mighty Boosh]]'' (1998), ''[[Arctic Boosh]]'' (1999) and ''[[Autoboosh]]'' (2000) – all of which were taken to the [[Edinburgh Fringe]]. With the success of ''Autoboosh'', a [[The Boosh (radio series)|radio series]] was commissioned by the [[BBC]]. Produced by [[Danny Wallace (humorist)|Danny Wallace]], ''The Boosh'' was first broadcast in 2001 on [[BBC London 94.9|BBC London Live]], later transferring to [[BBC Radio 4]], from which the team were given a half-hour [[television pilot]] of the same name.

The [[The Mighty Boosh (series 1)|first 8-part series]], directed by [[Paul King (director)|Paul King]], was then commissioned for BBC Three and broadcast in 2004, with a [[The Mighty Boosh (series 2)|second]] of 6 episodes the next year. The second series moved away from the zoo setting to show [[List of recurring characters from The Mighty Boosh#Howard Moon|Howard]], [[List of recurring characters from The Mighty Boosh#Vince Noir|Vince]], [[Naboo the Enigma|Naboo]] the shaman and [[List of recurring characters from The Mighty Boosh#Bollo|Bollo]] the talking [[ape]] living in a [[apartment|flat]] in [[Dalston]].&lt;ref&gt;[[BBC]]. [http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/mightyboosh/interviews/ Where is series two set?], [[bbc.co.uk]].&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, the Boosh returned to theatre with ''[[The Mighty Boosh (2006 stage show)|The Mighty Boosh Live]]'', which featured a new story entitled "The Ruby of Kukundu".

After two years away from television, the Boosh returned in November 2007. Set in Naboo’s second-hand shop below the flat, the [[The Mighty Boosh (series 3)|third series]] drew approximately 1 million viewers with its first episode,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Barber | first = Nicholas | title = Noel Fielding: The comedian is returning to his first love&amp;nbsp;– painting | publisher = ''[[The Independent]]'' | date = 9 December 2007 | url = http://news.independent.co.uk/people/profiles/article3229391.ece | accessdate = 29 March 2008 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071220022255/http://news.independent.co.uk/people/profiles/article3229391.ece | archivedate = 20 December 2007 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in light of its success, BBC Three broadcast an [[The Mighty Boosh#The Mighty Boosh Night|entire night]] of ''The Mighty Boosh'' on 22 March 2008, which included a new documentary and 6 of Barratt and Fielding's favourite episodes from all 3 series. [[J. G. Quintel]] has said that The Mighty Boosh was a large influence on his animated series ''[[Regular Show]]''.

In June 2013, it was confirmed that The Mighty Boosh would reunite for a US festival called [[Festival Supreme]] in October 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nme.com/news/the-mighty-boosh/70791/.|title=The Mighty Boosh reunite to play Tenacious D's US festival |publisher=NME |date=11 June 2013 |accessdate=12 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theatre==

===Original stage shows===

====''The Mighty Boosh'' (1998)====
{{Main|The Mighty Boosh (1998 stage show)}}
The Boosh, then consisting of only Barratt and Fielding, conceived ''The Mighty Boosh'' whilst working on [[Stewart Lee]]'s [[Edinburgh Festival]] show ''King Dong vs. Moby Dick'' in which they played a giant [[Human penis|penis]] and a [[whale]] respectively.

In 1998, they took ''The Mighty Boosh'' to the [[Edinburgh Festival]], recruiting fellow comedian Rich Fulcher, whom the pair had met while working on ''[[Unnatural Acts (TV series)|Unnatural Acts]]''. The show won the [[Perrier Award]] for Best Newcomer. During their residency at North London's [[Hen and Chickens Theatre]] the following year, they built up a cult following, introducing new characters whilst developing old ones.

====''Arctic Boosh'' (1999)====
{{Main|Arctic Boosh}}
[[File:Mightyboosh2008tour.jpg|thumb|right|Poster used in magazines and venues around the UK to promote the Boosh's nationwide 2008 tour.]]
In 1999, the Boosh returned to the Edinburgh Festival with a new show, ''Arctic Boosh'', with [[Dave Brown (comedian)|Dave Brown]] acting as [[choreographer]] and [[photographer]], as well as playing a variety of characters. ''Arctic Boosh'' sold out every night and was nominated for the [[Perrier Award]].

====''Autoboosh'' (2000)====
{{Main|Autoboosh}}
In 2000, the Boosh premiered their third stage show, ''Autoboosh'', at the Melbourne International Comedy Festival, adding Fielding's younger brother Michael to the cast. ''Autoboosh'' won the festival's [[Barry Award (for comedy)|Barry Award]].

===Nationwide tours===

====''The Mighty Boosh Live'' (2006)====
{{Main|The Mighty Boosh (2006 stage show)}}
The Boosh returned to the stage in 2006, touring the UK for the first time. Though drawing heavily from their earlier material, the main story combined these elements into a new narrative. A recording of this show at the [[Brixton Academy]] was later released on DVD, before being broadcast on BBC Three on [[Boxing Day]], 2007.

====''Boosh Live: Future Sailors Tour'' (2008/09)====

{{Main|Boosh Live: Future Sailors Tour}}
The Boosh toured the UK and Ireland for a second time from September 2008 to February 2009.  The show featured characters from all three series as well as the Boosh Band.

They made appearances throughout the UK after their live shows, at after-parties held in different places in each city. The events were called "Outrage", after the catchphrase by [[List of recurring characters from The Mighty Boosh#Tony Harrison|Tony Harrison]].

==Radio==

===''The Boosh'' (2001)===
{{Main|The Boosh (radio series)}}
From the success of ''Autoboosh'', the BBC commissioned a six-part radio series for the Boosh. In October 2001 ''The Boosh'' radio series, produced by [[Danny Wallace (humorist)|Danny Wallace]], was broadcast on BBC London Live, then BBC Radio 4, and later on [[BBC 7]]. The show focuses on the adventures of a pair of zookeepers at "Bob Fossil's Funworld": socially awkward, jazz enthusiast Howard TJ Moon, and ultra-vain, fashion-obsessed Vince Noir. This also included voices from Lee Mack, playing such characters as the Plumber or the Gardener.

===Further appearances===
The Mighty Boosh returned to radio on 22 October 2004, in a one-off comedy special for ''[[The Breezeblock]]'', a show on [[BBC Radio 1]].&lt;ref&gt;Susie T. [http://themightyboosh.blogspot.com/2004/11/radio-1-breezeblock-mighty-boosh.html ''Radio 1 Breezeblock - The Mighty Boosh''], The Mighty Boosh News Updates, 17 November 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of the plot driven nature of their own series, this show featured improvised conversational comedy with Barratt, Fielding and Fulcher, combined with the show's usual mix of electronic music.

On 15 November 2007, as part of the [[publicity]] for the premier of their third series the same day, Julian Barratt and Noel Fielding returned to Radio 1, this time on [[Jo Whiley]]'s [[Live Lounge]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Jo Whiley]]. [http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/jowhiley/galleries/2673/1/ ''Mighty Boosh in the Live Lounge''], [[BBC Radio 1]], 15 November 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Television==
===''The Mighty Boosh'' (2004–07)===
{{Main|The Mighty Boosh (TV series)}}
[[File:MightyBooshTitles.png|thumb|Opening titles of The Mighty Boosh on TV &amp; film]]

In May 2004, after the success of a Boosh pilot, [[Steve Coogan]]'s company, [[Baby Cow Productions]], produced the first television series of ''The Mighty Boosh'' for BBC Three, before it moved to [[BBC Two]] in November that same year. Though each episode invariably starts and ends in Dixon Bainbridge’s dilapidated zoo, the "Zooniverse", the characters of Vince and Howard often depart for other locations, such as the [[Tundra#Arctic tundra|Arctic tundra]] and [[limbo]].

A second series, shown in July 2005, saw Howard and Vince sharing Naboo's flat in [[Dalston]] with previously minor characters Naboo and his [[familiar spirit|familiar]], Bollo, a gorilla living at the "Zooniverse". This series had an even looser setting as the four characters leave the confines of the flat in every episode, travelling in their van to a variety of surrealistic environments, including Naboo's home planet "Xooberon".

Series three started in November 2007, still set in Dalston, but this time the foursome are selling 'Bits &amp; Bobs' in their shop, the Nabootique.  Their adventures and outings in this series focused more on the involvement of new characters (e.g. Sammy the Crab, or Lester Corncrake etc.) rather than just the two of them.

Although BBC America originally aired only series 1 in the U.S (all episodes in their entirety), The Mighty Boosh began airing in North America on [[Cartoon Network]]'s [[Adult Swim]] block (with up to 6 minutes cut from each episode), starting 29 March 2009 with the third series.&lt;ref&gt;Dragoncon08.

===''The Mighty Boosh'' Night===
On 22 March 2008, BBC Three broadcast a whole night of ''The Mighty Boosh'' from 9:05&amp;nbsp;pm, starting with a new documentary titled ''The Mighty Boosh: A Journey Through Time and Space'', documenting the history of the Boosh from their first amateur performances to their then-upcoming 2008 tour. This was followed by six of Barratt and Fielding's favourite episodes from the three series: "[[Party (The Mighty Boosh)|Party]]", "[[The Power of the Crimp]]", "[[The Nightmare of Milky Joe]]", "[[The Priest and the Beast]]", "[[The Legend of Old Gregg]]", and "[[Tundra (The Mighty Boosh)|Tundra]]". The pair also appeared in live links throughout the night, in a similar style to the openings of Series 1 episodes.  On 23 December 2008, BBC3 held a Merry Booshmas Party featuring the entire series 3 as well as a broadcast of ''[[The Mighty Boosh (2006 stage show)|The Mighty Boosh Live]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[BBC]].

'''''The Penguin Encyclopedia of Horror and the Supernatural''''' is a [[reference work]] on [[horror fiction]] in [[The Arts|the arts]], edited by [[Jack Sullivan (literary scholar)|Jack Sullivan]].  The book was published in 1986 by [[Viking Press]].

Editor Sullivan’s stated purpose in compiling the volume, as noted in his [[foreword]] to the book, was to serve as a “bringing together in one volume of the [[genre]]’s many practitioners and their contributions to the arts.”  In addition to [[literature]] and the art of [[storytelling]], the book includes many entries on [[film]], [[music]], [[illustration]], [[architecture]], [[radio]], and [[television]].  The book contains over fifty major [[essays]] and six hundred shorter entries covering [[authors]], [[composers]], [[film directors]], and [[actor]]s, among other categories.

The book provides about 650 entries written by 65 contributors including [[Ramsey Campbell]], [[Gary William Crawford]], [[John Crowley]], [[Thomas M. Disch]], [[Ron Goulart]], [[S. T. Joshi]], [[T. E. D. Klein]], [[Kim Newman]], [[Darrell Schweitzer]], [[Whitley Strieber]], Timothy Sullivan, [[Colin Wilson]], and [[Douglas E. Winter]].  [[Jacques Barzun]] provided the lengthy [[Introduction (essay)|introduction]], "The Art and Appeal of the Ghostly and Ghastly".

In order to provide as broad as possible a study of fear, terror, and horror throughout the centuries, the book features numerous entries on "[[mainstream]]" artists who Sullivan notes "have dabbled in or plunged into horror", such as [[Charles Baudelaire]], [[Thomas Hardy]], [[Henry James]], [[Franz Kafka]], [[Edith Wharton]], [[Sergei Prokofiev]], [[Charles Dickens]], [[Heinrich von Kleist]], [[Herman Melville]], [[Joyce Carol Oates]], [[Franz Liszt]], [[Arnold Schoenberg|Arnold Schönberg]], [[William Butler Yeats]], and [[Isaac Bashevis Singer]], among others.

Hundreds of genre author entries are provided, including "[[William Thomas Beckford|William Beckford]]" by E. F. Bleiler, "[[Ambrose Bierce]]" and "[[Algernon Blackwood]]" by Jack Sullivan, "Ramsey Campbell" by Robert Hadji, "[[Robert W. Chambers]]" by T. E. D. Klein, "[[James Herbert]]" by Ramsey Campbell, "[[Shirley Jackson]]" by Sullivan, "[[Stephen King]]" by Don Herron, "[[Arthur Machen]]" by Klein, "[[Ann Radcliffe]]" by [[Devendra P. Varma]], and "[[Peter Straub]]" by Patricia Skarda.

Theme essays include "[[Arkham House]]" by T. E. D. Klein, "The Continental Tradition" by Helen Searing, "English [[Romantic Poetry|Romantic Poets]]" by John Calhoun, "Golden Age of the [[Ghost story|Ghost Story]]" by Jack Sullivan, "Illustration" by Robert Weinberg, "[[Opera]]" by Arthur Paxton, "The Pits of Terror" by Ramsey Campbell, "[[Pulp magazine|The Pulps]]" by Ron Goulart, "[[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s Ghosts" by John Crowley, "Urban and Pastoral Horror" by Douglas E. Winter, and "[[Zombies]]" by Hugh Lamb.

Film and television related entries include "''[[The Abominable Dr. Phibes]]''", "[[Tod Browning]]", "[[Brian De Palma]]", "''[[Eraserhead]]''", "''[[Inferno (1980 film)|Inferno]]''", "[[Boris Karloff]]", "''[[Night of the Living Dead]]''", "[[Roman Polanski]]", "''[[Suspiria]]''", "''[[Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom]]''", and "''[[The Wolf Man (1941 film)|The Wolf Man]]''".

The book was reprinted in 1989 by [[Random House]].

==Reception==
In a comment to Hugh Lamb's review, Rosemary Pardoe noted, "I have to say that I think Hugh has been remarkably kind to a book which, for me, is a fine idea totally ruined by being put together by a packaging company who seem to know nothing about the subject. There are so many errors that no fact given in the book can be trusted without double-checking elsewhere."&lt;ref&gt;Pardoe, Rosemary. ''Ghosts and Scholars'', #9, 1987&lt;/ref&gt;

"The encyclopedia has been criticized for lack of editorial balance, but deficiencies are offset by excellent critical essays by [[Everett F. Bleiler|E. F. Bleiler]], Richard Dalby and others."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thompsonrarebooks.com/shop/thompson/5163.html "The Penguin Encyclopedia of Horror and the Supernatural", Thompson Rare Books]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Theodore C. Bestor''' (born 1951) is a Professor of [[Anthropology]] and [[Japanese Studies]] at [[Harvard University]].  He was the President for the [[Association for Asian Studies]] in 2012.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Theodore C. Bestor was born on August 7, 1951, in [[Urbana, Illinois]]. His father, [[Arthur Bestor]], was a historian of American 19th century communitarian settlements and of the origins and development of the American constitution. His mother, Dorothy Alden Koch Bestor, was a professor of English literature. Bestor lived in Champaign-Urbana until he was eleven, when his parents moved to Seattle. He first visited Japan in 1967, when his father received a [[Fulbright Fellowship]] to teach at the [[University of Tokyo]], [[Rikkyo University]], and [[Doshisha University]].

He attended secondary school in Seattle and graduated from [[Fairhaven College]] of [[Western Washington University]] in 1973. His graduate education was at [[Stanford University]], where he received master's degrees in East Asian Studies (1976) and Anthropology (1977), and a PhD in Anthropology in 1983. During his graduate studies, he spent two years at the [[Inter-University Center for Japanese Language Studies]] in Tokyo.

===Career===
He started his career as program director for Japanese and Korean studies at the [[Social Science Research Council]]. He then taught at [[Cornell University]] and [[Columbia University]], and was a visiting professor at the [[Kyoto Consortium for Japanese Studies]]. He became a Professor of Anthropology at Harvard University in 2001. He served as the Chair of the Department of Anthropology from 2007 to 2012. During 2013-13, he was President of the [[Association for Asian Studies]], and has been president of the [[American Anthropological Association]]'s Society for Urban Anthropology and the Society for East Asian Anthropology (of which he was the founding president). He is currently the Director of the [[Reischauer Institute of Japanese Studies]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://rijs.fas.harvard.edu/about/index.php Reischauer Institute of Japanese Studies] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141021063105/http://rijs.fas.harvard.edu/about/index.php |date=2014-10-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has written widely on the culture and society of [[Japan]]. Much of his research has focused on contemporary [[Tokyo]], including an [[ethnography]] of daily life in an ordinary neighborhood, [[Miyamoto-cho, Tokyo|Miyamoto-cho]].  Since the early 1990s, his primary research has concerned Tokyo's [[Tsukiji fish market]] where he has studied the [[economic anthropology]] of institutions, and has focused also on [[food culture]], [[globalization]], and [[Agriculture, forestry, and fishing in Japan|Japan's fishing industry]]. In 2013, he received an award from Japan's [[Agency for Cultural Affairs]] for his contributions to international understanding of Japan.

He was president of the [[Association for Asian Studies]] in 2012.

===Personal life===
His wife, with whom he has co-edited and co-authored many publications, is Victoria Lyon Bestor. She is the Executive Director of the [[North America Coordinating Council on Japanese Library Resources]].  They have a son, Nicholas, born in 1986.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23984">The “'''Tower of David Period'''” is the nickname which describes [[Visual arts in Israel|Israeli art]] during the 1920s.  The nickname was coined as a result of the exhibition that took place in the [[Tower of David]] during that period. Instead of one artistic direction, this period was characterized by artistic works of conflicting styles, reflecting the worldview of the artists with regard to the social, political, and artistic reality within the Land of Israel and outside of it. Alongside the art created at “[[Bezalel]]”, which was characterized by decorative motifs and the influence of ars nova, the young Land-of-israel artists produced works of art that reflected a variety of modernist influences.

==Background: The Land of Israel at the Beginning of the 20th Century==
[[File:PikiWiki Israel 13451 Davids Citadel Jerusalem.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Tower of David]] in late 1920s]]
[[File:Avineri76.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Tel Aviv]] in the 1920s]]
The variety of expressions and styles in the [[Land of Israel]] in the "Tower of David Period" reflects the historic and decisive division in the history of the [[Jewish]] people which preceded this period and continued through the days of the [[Yishuv]], the body of Jewish residents in Palestine, before the establishment of the State of Israel, under [[Mandatory Palestine|the British Mandate]].

The Yishuv community had been caught up in an accelerated process of change since the [[First Aliyah]] in 1881. The aspiration of the elite groups of new immigrants was not just to settle the Holy Land and to implement an emotional and spiritual awakening there, like most of their predecessors from the “[[Old Yishuv]]”, but also to fashion it in their own image and identity; this included, according to their own consciousness, both old and traditional elements and new and revolutionary elements, intertwined in a unique ideological treatise.

From the beginning of the 20th century, people of the [[Second Aliyah]] worked to change the status and situation of the Jewish community in the Land of Israel. The decisive compensation for their efforts came with the outbreak of [[World War I]] in 1914, and the events that followed in its wake: in 1917 the [[Russian Revolution]] took place and the Bolsheviks seized the government; the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] and the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] Empires dissolved into individual nations; and even the victorious Colonial powers, headed by Britain and France, began in effect a process of convergence. After the signing of the peace agreements, and as a result of them, a new world order prevailed; and in the Land of Israel, the British Mandate government slowly took root, beginning with the Balfour Declaration and the entry of the army into the Land of Israel, effecting a gradual occupation in 1918, the beginning of the military government, and later the civil government  in 1920, and ending in the publication of the first “White Book” in 1922. The British in fact expressed support for the Zionist leadership, when they allowed delegations of the Zionist Commission and [[Hadassah]] to come to the Land of Israel and found the basis for declaring future Jewish sovereignty there; on the other hand they hampered aliyah to the Land of Israel and disbanded the [[Jewish Legion]], which they had recruited during World War I, and in whom they had instilled with grand Zionist hopes.

A mixture of voices could be heard in the years after World War I in the various Jewish communities, particularly in the battle among the militant members of the Zionist Movement.  Advocates of religiosity and traditionalism, nationalism and modernism, liberalism and Communism all made use of the movement. All these streams found a place in the small Yishuv society in the 1920s, and the different utterances and artist directions were combined in them and influenced by them.

The people of the [[Third Aliyah]], from 1918 to 1923, were imbued with a wide-ranging revolutionary spirit, and they were engaged in a constant interchange with the Yishuv environment. However their influence was also a result of their numbers (by the end of the war the Yishuv numbered 56,000 people, and an estimate of the number of the many new Jewish immigrants, balancing out those who left, stood at 35,000)&lt;ref&gt;1.	See: Yigal Zalmona, 100 Years of Israeli Art (Jerusalem: The Israel Museum, 2010), p. 51 (in Hebrew); Yehuda Erez, ed., Third Aliya Book (Tel Aviv: Am Oved, 1964) (in Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt;  and in addition, to a large extent, because of the broad spectrum of new ideas they brought with them to the Land of Israel.  Most of the new immigrants were from Eastern Europe, young, and with a belief in Zionism in all its varieties. Many of them, particularly the young and inventive among them, underwent a redesign of how they perceived their new Jewish and Hebrew world during the 1920s, while they were involved in Zionist labor like building roads and erecting buildings, and were undergoing the considerable suffering brought about  by poverty, hunger, and the constant illnesses resulting from them. At the same time they were structuring their own personal identity, they also influenced the long-time residents of the Land of Israel who had preceded them: people who had come on the First and Second Aliyah and were members of the “Old Yishuv”.

==The Tower of David Exhibition: “The First Culture War” in Israeli Art”==
The opening of exhibitions in the Tower of David in April 1921, expressed the aspirations toward founding a center for art in the Land of Israel. In spite of the fact that the exhibitions were supposed to include a representation of all the art being created in the Land of Israel, in reality the art of the Arab, Muslim, and Christian residents were presented primarily in a historical-archaeological framework. The Jewish artists, on the other hand, sought to present art that drew its inspiration not just from the Jewish historical past, but also from the movement of art and handicrafts that was grew out of European Modernism. This was most noticeable among the artists of “The Jewish Artists Association”, who attempted to develop a “Jewish ethic”. This group, most of whom were students of “Bezalel”, organized exhibitions in the Tower of David. A number of exhibitions were organized, both in the Tower of David and outside of it, and most of the works exhibited in these exhibitions were influenced by the Post-Impressionists and the Expressionists.  
[[File:Reuven wirh peirot risonim.jpg|right|thumb|250px|[[Reuven Rubin]] paints "Fruit of the Land" (central panel from the triptych "First Fruits"), 1923)]]
One of the most important exhibitions was that of the works by [[Reuven Rubin]], who mounted an exhibition in the Tower in 1924. Rubin exhibited new works that showed the transition from the influence of the Christian tradition to paintings brimming with the symbolism of the Land of Israel.&lt;ref&gt;4.	Cf., Carmela Rubin, A Dream of a Place (Jerusalem: The Israel Museum, 2007), p. 13-37 (in Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt;  Among the works that drew attention was the triptych “First Fruits” (1924), which received enthusiastic reviews by critics from various fields of culture such as [[Hayyim Nahman Bialik]], [[Hugo Bergmann|Samuel (Schmuel) Hugo Bergman]], etc. However the perception of Modernist painting that Rubin presented was not shared by all of the population. His album of woodcuts, “The Godseekers (1923)”, which he sent to the High Commissioner, was rejected because the High Commissioner did not “have any liking for that population of art objects”.&lt;ref&gt;5.	See: Reuven Rubin, cited in: Studio, No. 56 (September 1994), unnumbered pages (in Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt;
Views like those held by Rubin kept spreading among the young artists during the first half of the decade. At the same time "Bezalel" art continued to honor the values of Classicism, Jugendstil (Art Nouveau), and eastern European Realism.&lt;ref&gt;See: Ofrat, Gidon, Art in Israel  (Westview Press, 1998), p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;  The works of the “Bezalel” artists existed primarily within the space of applied arts, and they were characterized by the introduction of  noncanonical branches of art – such as decoration and design – into high art in order to create a style".&lt;ref&gt;Yigal Zalmona, The Tower of David Days; First Cultural Strife in Israeli Art (Jerusalem: Tower of David, Museum of the History of Jerusalem, 1991). p. 15 (in Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt;

But first and foremost the young artists began to be aware of the growing gap between “Bezalel” and the international art world.  One attempt to reject totally the world of Modernism can be seen in [[Boris Schatz]]’s closure of the Bezalel library because he was afraid the students would be negatively influenced by it.&lt;ref&gt;See: Benjamin Tammuz, The Story of Israeli Art (Masada Publishers, Tel Aviv, 1980), p. 38 (in Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt;  In a critical article published in 1928, Agan wrote that as opposed to the people of “Bezalel”, Modernist artists “draw the land of Israel with love and a desire to understand and grasp its colors and lines in accordance with the dominant trends in the modern art world”.&lt;ref&gt;9.	Agan, “Bezalel” Writings (Tel Aviv: January 12, 1928), cited in: Nurit Shilo-Cohen, Schatz’s Bezalel  (Jerusalem: The Israel Museum, 1983), p. 231 (in Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of the decade the principles on which Bezalel based its work had become irrelevant, because they were no longer suitable to the political and ideological conditions of Eretz Israel. Besides the criticism of the varying quality of the results of the “Bezalel” workshops, the strengthening of left-wing elements in the Yishuv, increased the criticism of the use of national and religious symbols as the virtually exclusive expression of Jewish nationality. In 1929, the school closed after the Zionist organizations  refused to support its activities any longer.

[[Yigal Zalmona]] presented the confrontation between the “Bezalel” people and the “rebel” artists as a confrontation between the “immigrant” point of view and the “native”  point of view. The “old-timer” generation of “Bezalel” insisted on creating a national art, which focused on the symbols of its Judeo-European past.  In this way the artists expressed their wish to be integrated into the world of European art. The “Bezalel” artists enjoyed the support of the European Jewish middle classes, and many of the orders for the art coming out of its workshops came from the Conservative and Reform Jews of the United States. The generation of modern students, on the other hand, saw the creation of a local Jewish culture as a central need, a point of view which coincided with spirit of Israel’s Labor Movement. Many of them were influenced  by the European vanguard, to whom they had been exposed in various frameworks, particularly in France.  These artists, Tsalmona contended, wanted to create the reality of the Land of Israel of their time within the framework of the creative activity this vanguard.&lt;ref&gt;See:  Zalmona, p. 49, 58.&lt;/ref&gt;

==From Jerusalem to Tel Aviv – The Development of the Center of Art of the Land of Israel==
[[File:Bezalel, 1913.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The Bezalel Buildings, Jerusalem, 1909]]
The founding of “Bezalel” in Jerusalem in 1906 created a center of art and culture in Jerusalem the likes of which had never before been seen in the Land of Israel. The “Bezalel” people hoped to continue to develop the school as an artistic and ideological center for the country’s inhabitants, and even for the Jewish inhabitants of the Diaspora. This was symbolized above all by the opening of the [[Bezalel National Museum]] in 1925, as a museum intended to be open permanently to the public. In these years the art of young artists from the Land of Israel was eliminated entirely from its exhibitions, which concentrated entirely on historical artistic evidence of the nationalist  message  appropriate to the “Bezalel”  dialogue Boris Schatz was promoting. By the middle of the 1920s, Bezalel’s status in the eyes of the public had seriously deteriorated. A witness to this can be seen in the 1927 letter of [[Mordechai Narkis]] to [[Boris Schatz]], in which he reports that Land of Israeli newspapers have eradicated the name of the Bezalel school from their articles.&lt;ref&gt;See: Gideon Efrat, Washington Crosses the Jordan (Jerusalem: Sifria Zionit, 2008), pp. 149-150 (in Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt;

Parallel to Bezalel, at the beginning of the 1920s a group of independent artists who sought to cut all ties with the old establishment began to be active in Jerusalem. The establishment of the “[[Association of Jewish Artists]]” symbolized this more than any other phenomenon. In addition to the exhibits organized by the Association, private exhibitions were organized in various places in the city, such as “Menorah” ([[Joseph Zaritsky]]), Hotel Amdursky ([[Abraham Neumann]]), the Lamel School ([[Batya Leschinsky]], [[Ariel Allweil]]), etc.&lt;ref&gt;See: Gideon Efrat, Washington Crosses the Jordan (Jerusalem: Sifria Zionit, 2008), pp. 145-153, 151-152 (in Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to Jerusalem, the rapid development of the city of [[Tel Aviv]] during this decade, especially during the years of the [[Fourth Aliyah]] (1924-1931), allowed the rise of a community of artists with a modernist orientation, far removed from the historical baggage of the Holy City. This group quickly rejected the centrality of Jerusalem as the center of art.  According to [[Yona Fischer]], the exhibit of modern paintings mounted in the School for Boys in Jerusalem in 1926 marked the end of the competition between these two centers.&lt;ref&gt;See: Yona Fischer, Migdal David: The Beginnings of Painting in Eretz-Israel (Jerusalem, The Israel Museum, 1968), unnumbered pages (in Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the first signs of artistic activity in Tel Aviv was the opening of a school of painting and architecture in 1923 in the home of [[Joseph Berlin]] on Gruzenberg Street.&lt;ref&gt;See: Batia Donner, From the Perman Collection of the Tel Aviv Museum (Tel Aviv: Tel Aviv Museum of Art, 2002), p. 13 (in Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt; During this decade most of the major artists moved to Tel Aviv, especially those who returned from studying art in France and other places in Europe. Nevertheless, the “Bezalel” approach remained popular in architecture and architectural decoration. This was reflected in the adaptation of the “eclectic style,” in which many of the buildings in Tel Aviv of that period were designed.  In most of them porcelain tiles were used, glazed in the Bezalel style, and reflecting the themes and the ideology and the decorative approach of that Jerusalem institution.
  
One of the major donors to the visual arts in Tel Aviv was [[Yaakov Pereman]], who was the entrepreneur behind the founding of the artists’ cooperative “Ha-Tomer”. In 1920 Pereman opened “The First Art Exhibition in the Land of Israel”, at which various works were exhibited, including those of the artists of the cooperative. In 1921-1922 Pereman founded and managed Tel Aviv’s first art gallery, called “The Permanent Art Exhibition in the Land of Israel” in the exhibition hall in [[Neve Sha'anan, Tel Aviv|Neve Sha’anan]].&lt;ref&gt;The hall was next to the trade school  and opposite the Tel Aviv gate (what is now the corner of Nahalat Binyamin and Mohaliver Streets).&lt;/ref&gt; In this gallery many modernistic works, which Pereman brought from Eastern Europe, were exhibited, along with modernistic works by Land of Israel artists and works by artists from the “Bezalel” school as well. According to [[Batia Donner]], “Pereman’s gallery activity was both an augmentation of and an alternative to the ‘Bezalel’ activity".&lt;ref&gt;See: Batia Donner, From the Pereman Collection of the Tel Aviv Museum (Tel Aviv: Tel Aviv Museum of Art, 2002), p. 25 (in Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ohel 1921-1925.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Exhibition of "Modern Artists" in the Ohel Theatre in Tel Aviv]]
On January 14, 1926, an exhibition entitled “Exhibition of Modern Artists” opened in a shed of the “Ha-Ohel” (The Tent) Theater. The poet [[Avraham Shlonsky]] gave a speech at the opening of the exhibition in which he suggested that the opening was a seminal event in the evolution of Jewish culture: “I recommend a substitute for God: the exhibition that is taking place in ‘Ha-Ohel’.  A new synagogue needs to be found; that is, in place of God, we’ll be standing there.  Let the poet be found in the sphere of the painter, and the painter in the sphere of the musician.  And ‘Ha-Ohel’ can serve as a substitute for God in the synagogue of art.”  This exhibition, and two additional exhibitions held in “Ha-Ohel” before 1928, was perceived by Israeli art critics as the event that established the hegemony of Tel Aviv in the country’s cultural life.&lt;ref&gt;See: Yigal Zalmona, 100 Years of Israeli Art (Jerusalem: The Israel Museum, 2010), p. 78 (in Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of 1929, an exhibition of art by the group known as “Egged” (The Amalgamation), which took place in an apartment on Allenby Street in Tel Aviv, and which exhibited works by artists such as [[Sionah Tagger]], [[Chana Orloff]], [[Reuven Rubin]], and others. Another exhibition held in Tel Aviv during this period under the name “Massad” (The Base") exhibited younger artists, including [[Aaaron Priver]], [[Menahem Shemi]], [[Israel Paldi]], [[Avigdor Stematsky]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;Batia Donner, From a Collection to a Museum, 1920-1932 (Tel Aviv: Tel Aviv Museum of Art, 2002), pp. 20-21 (in Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modernism in the Land of Israel During the 1920s==
During the 1920s many of the young artists in the Land of Israel were exposed to modern art. Only a small minority of the artists immigrated to the Land of Israel from Eastern Europe with a previous exposure to European avant-garde art.  Others went for a limited period to study in Europe, primarily in [[France]], which was considered the center of art at the time, but also in [[Germany]] and other places.

The various modernist influences included postmodernist influences with regard to color and the way it is applied to the canvas, along with the moderating influences of Cubism and Expressionism, as well as a tendency to Primitivism.  In contrast to the European artists, only a tiny minority of the artists in the Land of Israel leaned toward the avant-garde and the abstract in their works.  The general mood demanded that they express the realistic experience of life in the Land of Israel, combining East and West in their work.
  
Among the outstanding artists of the period was the sculptor [[Abraham Melnikov]]. Melnikov suggested a different lexicon of forms, taken from ancient Eastern art instead of the art forms imported from Europe, and in accordance with the reigning philosophy in Bezalel during the time of Schatz and Lilien. “For generations”, Melnikoff wrote, “the Jews have been cut off from figurative art, and there are many reasons for this, but the main reason is that the foundations of European art are Greco-Roman […] and whenever Athens was the Only source of European art, the Jews instinctively watched from the side”.&lt;ref&gt;Haaretz, December 18, 1925.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Land of Israel School", or "The Land of Israel Style," was established by a group of artists who inserted into their works symbols of the reality of the Land of Israel, which could also be interpreted as mystical symbols. In their works we see depictions of the Land of Israel wilderness, full of desert foliage and images drawn from Eastern exoticism. Many of the depictions are of Arab or Middle Eastern figures, which are shown to have a direct connection with Land of Israel nature or with the Land of Israel of the Bible.

In works such as "Woman Carrying a Sheaf" (1926) and "Resting at Noon" (1926) by [[Nachum Gutman]], Middle Eastern figures working at nature-related activities are depicted. The style of the painting emphasizes their monumentality and sensuality.  A similar style can be seen in the work of Israel Paldi, "Arab Sailors" (1928), which depicts a group of sailors in a fishing boat heroically fighting the waves.  The composition of the painting, which reduces the view to the boat, also emphasizes the monumentality of the figures. [[Pinchas Litvinovsky]]'s painting "Arab with Flower" (1926) combines a style that is modernist in the structure of its composition and its flat spaces, and romantic in its depiction of the Middle East and the Middle Eastern.   In the works of Reuven Rubin we see, alongside the Middle Eastern figures, depictions of the way of life of the Jews of the Land of Israel as well. In his paintings such as "Sophie" (1924) or "Dancers of Meron" (1926), then tendency to flatness and decorativeness is very evident.  In these works Rubin identifies Land of Israel Jewishness with Middle Eastern rootedness, as manifested by a large number of Yemenite or Arab figures, or by images of the Land of Israel landscape or foliage.

Even in the 1920s this type of art was the object of criticism. [[Uri Zvi Greenberg]], for example, rejected the symbolic depiction which could be seen in the works of many artists of the time.  In Greenberg's view, these artists were simply providing illustrations for the literary subject – the exotic Middle Easterner – for whom the artist "dragged the Arab from the market and his donkey by the ear to the canvas".&lt;ref&gt;Uri Zvi Greenberg, “Draft of an article on an exhibition of Zaritsky in the Bezalel National Museum , Studio, No. 56 (September 1994), p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; The artist [[Chaim Gliksberg]] in 1923 also described the misuse of this motif by the artists: "Our paintings shocked the world, covered huge canvases, were  illustrations painted in the decorative style without any attempt at solving artistic problems, since the main thing was the subject and the content: the external depiction of the Land of Israel. The canvas and the paint served only as the means to all this: it's no wonder that they considered everyone who put a pioneer, a camel, a donkey, or an Arab village on canvas, as an Israeli artist".&lt;ref&gt;Turim [Tel Aviv literary weekly, 1933-1935], 1933.  Cited in: Tammuz, Benjamin, ed., The Story of Israeli Art (Givatayim: Masada Publishers, 1980), 49.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the artists who rejected the symbolic representation of the Land of Israel was Joseph Zaritsky.  His works during this period included a large number of watercolor landscapes in light colors.  His artistic work gradually became more free in its style.  In works such as “Jerusalem Habashim Gate” (1923), you can still see a desire for a meticulous description of nature, but his later works show an expressive tendency in the creation of their composition; examples of this can be seen in the painting “Haifa, The Technion” (1924), or in the work “Jerusalem, Nahalat Shiva” (1924), in which Zaritsky uses trees as an expressive device for dividing the format into distinct areas.  The use of lines as a means of expression stands out also in his landscapes depicting the houses  of Jerusalem or Safed of that era. 
 
Among the group of artists who were influenced by French Modernism we can see a combination of the influences of Cubism and realism. For example, in Sionah Tagger’s painting, “The Train Passing Through Neve Tzedek” (1928), the tendency to geometric description stands out in monochromatic painted surfaces which combine with a realistic depiction of the urbanity of the developing city of Tel Aviv. In the works of Chana Orloff and Arieh Lubin, perhaps more than in any other artists of the period, we can see the influence of synthetic Cubism and of the tendency toward the use of geometric forms.

      <comment>Moved the statement about "moko" being distinct from "tattooing" from the lede to the "Background" section, and made it clear that this refers to the *traditional* moko (using an "uhi") - because later on, the article notes that most moko today are tattoos</comment>

'''''{{lang|mi|Tā moko}}''''' is the permanent marking of the face and body as traditionally practised by [[Māori people|Māori]], the indigenous people of New Zealand.

Captain [[James Cook]] wrote in 1769:
{{quote|The marks in general are spirals drawn with great nicety and even elegance. One side corresponds with the other. The marks on the body resemble foliage in old chased ornaments, convolutions of filigree work, but in these they have such a luxury of forms that of a hundred which at first appeared exactly the same no two were formed alike on close examination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-RobMoko-t1-body-d1-d2.html |title=Moko; or Maori Tattooing |chapter=Moko and Mokamokai — Chapter I — How Moko First Became Knows to Europeans |page=5 |author=Major-General Robley |year=1896 |publisher=Chapman and Hall Limited |accessdate=2009-09-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vanishingtattoo.com/tattoo_museum/maori_tattoos.html |title=Tattoo History Museum |publisher=vanishingtattoo.com |date= |accessdate=2009-08-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{lang|mi|[[Tohunga]]-tā-moko}} (tattooists) were considered ''{{lang|mi|[[tapu (Polynesian culture)|tapu]]}}'', or inviolable and sacred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://history-nz.org/maori3.html |title=The Māori - The Tattoo (Ta Moko) }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[Tattoo]] arts are common in the Eastern [[Polynesia]]n homeland of Māori, and the traditional implements and methods employed were similar to those used in other parts of Polynesia.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hīroa|1951|p=296}}&lt;/ref&gt; In pre-European Māori culture, many if not most high-ranking persons received {{lang|mi|moko}}, and those who went without them were seen as persons of lower [[social status]]. Receiving {{lang|mi|moko}} constituted an important milestone between childhood and adulthood, and was accompanied by many [[rites]] and [[rituals]]. Apart from signalling status and rank, another reason for the practice in traditional times was to make a person more attractive to the opposite sex. Men generally received {{Lang|mi|moko}} on their faces, buttocks (''{{lang|mi|raperape}}'') and thighs (''{{lang|mi|puhoro}}''). Women usually wore moko on their lips (''{{lang|mi|kauwae}}'') and chins. Other parts of the body known to have moko include women's foreheads, buttocks, thighs, necks and backs and men's backs, stomachs, and calves.

Historically, {{lang|mi|moko}} was distinct from [[tattoo|tattooing]], in that the skin was carved by ''{{lang|mi|uhi}}''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/RobMoko-fig-RobMoko048a.html |title=Fig. 46.—Uhi, or chisels in the British Museum (actual size). Presented by Sir George Grey, K. C. B., &amp;c |publisher= |accessdate=28 August 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (chisels), not punctured. This left the skin with grooves rather than a smooth surface.

==Instruments used==
Originally ''{{lang|mi|tohunga-tā-moko}}'' ({{lang|mi|moko}} specialists) used a range of ''{{lang|mi|uhi}}'' (chisels) made from [[albatross]] bone which were [[hafting|hafted]] onto a handle, and struck with a mallet.&lt;ref name="best"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Best |first=Eldson |year=1904 |title=The Uhi-Maori, or Native Tattooing Instruments |journal=The Journal of the Polynesian Society |volume=13 |issue=3 |pages=166–72 |url=http://www.jps.auckland.ac.nz/document/Volume_13_1904/Volume_13,_No._3,_September_1904/The_Uhi-Maori_or_native_tattooing_instruments,_by_Elsdon_Best,_p166-172/p1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The pigments were made from the {{lang|mi|[[awheto]]}} for the body colour, and ''{{lang|mi|ngarehu}}'' (burnt timbers) for the blacker face colour. The soot from burnt [[gum-digger|kauri gum]] was also mixed with fat to make pigment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/1966/K/KauriGum/MaoriUses/en |title=Kauri gum |publisher=[[Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand]] |accessdate=28 August 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The pigment was stored in ornate vessels named ''{{lang|mi|oko}}'', which were often buried when not in use. The ''{{lang|mi|oko}}'' were handed on to successive generations. A {{lang|mi|[[kōrere]]}} (feeding funnel) is believed to have been used to feed men whose mouths had become swollen from receiving {{lang|mi|tā moko}}.&lt;ref name=LandcareKorere&gt;{{cite web |title=Korere - Tasman District |url=http://whenuaviz.landcareresearch.co.nz/place/73043 |publisher=Landcare Research - Manaaki Whenua |accessdate=21 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Men were predominantly the {{lang|mi|tā moko}} specialists, although [[Michael King|King]] records a number of women during the early 20th century who also took up the practice. There is also a remarkable account of a woman prisoner-of-war in the 1830s who was seen putting moko on the entire back of the wife of a chief.{{cn|date=January 2017}}

==Changes==
The {{lang|mi|[[pākehā]]}} practice of collecting and trading ''{{lang|mi|[[mokomokai]]}}'' (tattooed heads) changed the dynamic of {{lang|mi|tā moko}} in the early colonial period. King (see below) talks about changes which evolved in the late 19th century when needles came to replace the ''{{lang|mi|uhi}}'' as the main tools. This was a quicker method, less prone to possible health risks, but the feel of the {{lang|mi|tā moko}} changed to smooth. {{lang|mi|Tā moko}} on men stopped around the 1860s in line with changing fashion and acceptance by {{lang|mi|Pākehā}}.

Women continued receiving {{lang|mi|moko}} through the early 20th century,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;cl=search&amp;d=WH19041010.2.55&amp;srpos=9&amp;e=-------10--1----0tattoo+chin+women-- |title=A Relic of Barbarism |work=[[Wanganui Herald]] |date=1904 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the historian [[Michael King]] in the early 1970s interviewing over 70 elderly women who would have been given the {{lang|mi|moko}} before the 1907 [[Tohunga Suppression Act 1907|Tohunga Suppression Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://teaohou.natlib.govt.nz/journals/teaohou/issue/Mao73TeA/c19.html |title=Moko |first=Michael |last=King |authorlink=Michael King |date=July 1973 |work=Te Ao Hou The Māori Magazine }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smale|first1=Aaron|title=Ta Moko|url=https://www.nzgeo.com/stories/ta-moko/|website=New Zealand Geographic|accessdate=4 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women were traditionally only tattooed on their lips, around the chin, and sometimes the nostrils.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Is Permanent Makeup Worth It? |url=https://pinkycloud.com/permanent-makeup-the-pros-and-cons-of-tattooing-of-lips-eyelids-and-eyebrows-tattoo-prices |accessdate=16 February 2016 |work=Pinky Cloud |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150805024648/http://pinkycloud.com/permanent-makeup-the-pros-and-cons-of-tattooing-of-lips-eyelids-and-eyebrows-tattoo-prices/ |archivedate=5 August 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thetattoocollection.com/history_of_tattoos.htm |title=History of Tattoos |publisher=TheTattooCollection.com |accessdate=28 August 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=={{Lang|mi|Tā moko}} today==
Since 1990 there has been a resurgence in the practice of {{lang|mi|tā moko}} for both men and women, as a sign of [[cultural identity]] and a reflection of the general revival of the [[Māori language|language]] and [[Māori culture|culture]]. Most {{lang|mi|tā moko}} applied today is done using a tattoo machine, but there has also been a revival of the use of ''{{lang|mi|uhi}}'' (chisels).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10484537 |title=Revival of Moko |date=29 December 2007 |work=[[New Zealand Herald]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Women too have become more involved as practitioners, such as Christine Harvey of the [[Chatham Islands|Chathams]], Henriata Nicholas in [[Rotorua]] and Julie Kipa in [[Whakatane]].

{{lang|mi|[[Te Uhi a Mataora]]}} was established in 2000 "to preserve, enhance, and develop tā moko as a living art form".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Te Uhi a Mataora|url=http://www.maoriart.org.nz/committees.html|website=Toi Māori Aotearoa|publisher=Toi Māori Aotearoa|accessdate=3 May 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170407201032/http://www.maoriart.org.nz/committees.html|archivedate=7 April 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Use by non-Māori===
Europeans were aware of {{Lang|mi|tā moko}} from at the time of the [[first voyage of James Cook]], and early Māori visitors to Europe, such as Moehanga in 1805,&lt;ref&gt;[http://rsnz.natlib.govt.nz/volume/rsnz_15/rsnz_15_00_006010.html ''"...the first Maori who reached England...had a well tattooed face..."'']&lt;/ref&gt; then [[Hongi Hika]] in 1820 and [[Te Pēhi Kupe]] in 1826,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/RobMoko-fig-RobMoko015a.html|title=Fig. 10.—Tattooing on the face of {{lang|mi|Te Pehi Kupe|nocat=y}}, drawn by himself|publisher=|accessdate=28 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; all had full-face {{Lang|mi|moko}}, as did several "[[Pākehā Māori]]" such as [[Barnet Burns]]. However, until relatively recently the art had little global impact. 

Appropriation of {{Lang|mi|tā moko}} by non-Māori is deemed offensive,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wiki.bmezine.com/index.php/Moko |title=Moko }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tao-of-tattoos.com/kirituhi.html |title=Kirituhi - Moko Inspired }}&lt;/ref&gt; and high-profile uses of Māori designs by [[Robbie Williams]], [[Ben Harper]] and a 2007 [[Jean-Paul Gaultier]] fashion show were controversial.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nzartmonthly.co.nz/kassem_001.html |title=Contemporary Manifestations of the traditional Ta Moko |last=Kassem |first=Mia |date=March 2003 |website=NZArtMonthly |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110224051959/http://www.nzartmonthly.co.nz/kassem_001.html |archive-date=2011-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stuff.co.nz_44467"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/life-style/fashion/44467 |title=Cheeky French steal moko |date=13 September 2007 |work=[[Stuff.co.nz]] |accessdate=16 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PA0608/S00054.htm |title=Sharples: Protected Objects Third Reading Speech |work=[[Scoop (website)|Scoop]] |accessdate=28 August 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://tattoo.about.com/cs/articles/a/maori_tamoko.htm|title=Why Most People Shouldn't Get Ta Moko Maori Tattoos|work=About.com Style|access-date=2017-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To reconcile the demand for Māori designs in a culturally sensitive way, the {{lang|mi|Te Uhi a Mataora}} group promotes the use of the term ''{{lang|mi|kirituhi}}'',&lt;ref name=Scoop-PR&gt;{{cite press release|title=Ta Moko - A History On Skin|url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/CU0507/S00107.htm|accessdate=3 May 2017|publisher=Christchurch Arts Festival 2005|date=13 July 2005|via=[[Scoop Independent News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; which has now gained wide acceptance:&lt;ref name="NZ_Herald_3532027"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=3532027 |title=Moko 'exploitation' causes concern |date=3 November 2003 |agency=[[NZPA]] |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=16 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NZ_Herald_10563758"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10563758 |title=Ta Moko making its mark on Maori |last=Ihaka |first=James |date=27 March 2009 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=16 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stuff.co.nz_167499"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/167499 |title=Myth and the moko |work=[[Waikato Times]] |accessdate=16 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cheseman|first1=Janelle|title=The resurrection of tā moko raises questions for Maori|url=http://www.newswire.co.nz/2014/03/resurrection-ta-moko-raises-questions-maori/|accessdate=3 May 2017|publisher=Newswire|date=15 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;...{{lang|mi|Kirituhi}} translates literally to mean—"drawn skin." As opposed to {{lang|mi|Moko}} which requires a process of consents, genealogy and historical information, {{lang|mi|Kirituhi}} is merely a design with a {{lang|mi|Maori}} flavour that can be applied anywhere, for any reason and on anyone...&lt;ref name="Scoop-PR" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8596">{{Semiotics}}
In [[semiotics]], the '''value''' of a [[sign (semiotics)|sign]] depends on its position and relations in the system of signification and upon the particular [[code (Semiotics)|codes]] being used.

==Saussure's value==

[[File:Semiotic Value.GIF|thumb|left|the internal, vertical relationship between signifier and signified is distinct from the horizontal relation of values between signs.]]

Value is the sign as it is determined by the other signs in a semiotic system. For linguist [[Ferdinand de Saussure]], for example, the content of a sign in linguistics is ultimately determined and delimited not by its internal content, but by what surrounds it: the synonyms ''redouter'' ("to dread"), ''craindre'' ("to fear"), and ''avoir peur'' ("to be afraid") have their particular values because they exist in opposition to one another. If two of the terms disappeared, then the remaining sign would take on their roles, become vaguer, less articulate, and lose its "extra something" because it would have nothing to distinguish itself from.

For de Saussure, this suggests that thought is a chaotic nebula until linguistic structure dissects it and holds its divisions in equilibriums. This is akin to the philosophy of 
[[Sir William Hamilton, 9th Baronet|Sir William Hamilton]], who indirectly influenced Saussure&lt;ref&gt;[http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/the_tls/article2869724.ece The Poet who could Smell Vowels]&lt;/ref&gt; and believed that the mind could only grasp an idea through distinguishing it from something that it is not. He reasoned that the two objects would otherwise collapse together for the mind and become indistinguishable from one another.

Value determines the sign as a whole, not just meaning. Sound is also an indeterminate nebulous. The arbitrary nature of the sign and the flexibility of sound means that an agreed upon contrast is required. For example, "zena" is useful because it stands in contrast to "zenb" within an agreed upon system. Without the distinction, "zena" could be used for absolutely anything, or indeed nothing, making communication an impossibility.

It must also be noted that it is only the sign as a whole that has value. Linguistic structure simultaneously unites sound with thought and decomposes "thought-sound" into linguistic units, or signs, consisting of a signifier and a signified (sound-pattern and concept, respectively). When analysed in isolation, the sound-pattern or concept are pure differences, emerging from series of sound-patterns or concepts that they themselves are dependent upon. But in isolation, they are mere abstractions, because neither can exist without the connection between the two. It is the sign as a whole, then, that is the concrete entity of structural linguistics, which is not a pure difference, a negative term, but a pure value, a positive term that is merely in opposition or resistance to all the other signs in the system.

== Definitions ==
=== Saussure ===
Drawing from the original definition proposed by [[Ferdinand de Saussure|Saussure]] (1857–1913), a sign has two parts:
*as a ''signifier'', i.e. it will have a form that a person can see, touch, smell, and/or hear, and 
*as the ''signified'', i.e. it will represent an idea or mental construct of a ''thing'' rather than the thing itself.

This emphasises that the sign is merely a [[symbol]] for the [[class (philosophy)|class]] of [[object (philosophy)|object]] referred to. Hence, the [[lexical (Semiotics)|lexical]] word or noun "box" evokes a range of possibility from cheap card to gold-encrusted container. The reader or [[audience]] may not be able to see the particular box referred to but will be aware of its likely form from the other signs accompanying the use of the particular word.

However, there is no necessary connection between the signifier and the signified. There is nothing inherently ''boxy'' about the component sounds or letters that comprise the noun "box"—the scope of [[onomatopoeia]] is limited when forming a [[language]]. All that is necessary is that the relevant group of people should decide to use that word to [[denotation (Semiotics)|denote]] the object. Evidence that this is the correct view comes from the fact that each language can encode signifiers with whichever signified they wish to communicate. Hence, for example, the letters comprising "air" signify what humans breathe in English, and what fish breathe in Malay, i.e. water.

This makes a system of signs a very flexible mechanism for communicating [[Meaning (semiotics)|meaning]], but one which is conditioned by [[history]] and [[culture]], i.e. once a sign acquires a commonly accepted meaning in each language, it cannot arbitrarily be changed by any one person, but it is able to change [[Historical linguistics|diachronically]].

Further, [[Roman Jakobson]] (1896–1982)  proposes that when a group of signs is used, there is an emotive function that reflects the speaker's attitude to the topic of his or her [[discourse]]. Language and the other coding systems are the means whereby one self-aware individual communicates with another. By selecting particular signs and placing them in a context, the addresser is making a [[cognitive]] use of the sign system to refer to his or her own social, moral, ethical, political or other values.

=== Barthes ===
Because signs may have multiple meanings, a sign can only be interpreted in its context. Saussure believed that any one sign takes its value from its position and relations with other signs within the linguistic system. Modern semiotics draws its inspiration from the work of,  ''inter alios'', [[Roland Barthes]] (1915–1980), who argued that semiotics should expand its scope and concern: "...any system of signs, whatever their substance and limits; images, gestures, musical sounds, objects, and the complex associations of all of these, which form the content of ritual, convention or public entertainment: these constitute, if not languages, at least systems of signification" (1967, 9). 

In the system to be interrogated, the relations will be both weak and strong, positive and negative, qualitative and quantitative, etc. In this, a sign cannot be attributed a value outside its context (although what is signified may have [[connotation (Semiotics)|connotative]] meaning(s) that resonate outside the context), and what is ''not'' present can be just as significant as what is present.

In a slightly different context of critique through the ''archaeological'' and ''genealogical'' methods for the study of [[knowledge]], [[Michel Foucault]] (1926–1984) used the idea of [[discontinuity (Postmodernism)|discontinuity]] as a means to ''revalorise'' elements of knowledge. In this, he considered the silences and lacunae within a text to be as significant as express statements. In both systems, the specific processes of analysis examine these gaps to reveal whose interests are served by the omissions. Such analysis is particularly useful to identify which questions are left unasked.

==Methods==
The [[commutation test (Semiotics)|commutation test]] can be used to identify which signifiers are significant. The test depends on substitution: a particular signifier is chosen, then the effect of substituting alternatives is considered to determine the extent to which the value of the sign is changed. This both illuminates the meaning of the original choice and identifies the [[paradigms]] and [[code (Semiotics)|code]] to which the signifiers used belong.

[[Paradigmatic analysis]] compiles a list of the signifiers present in the text. This set comprises the paradigm. The analyst then compares and contrasts the set with absent signifiers, i.e. with other signifiers that might have been chosen. This reveals the significance of the choices made which might have been required because of technical production constraints or the limitations of the individual’s own technique, or because of the [[Trope (linguistics)|tropes]], generic [[Convention (norm)|conventions]], [[stylistics (linguistics)|style]] and [[rhetoric]]al purpose of the work. The analysis of paradigmatic relations helps to define the ‘value’ of specific items in a system.

The '''Villa of the Mysteries''' ({{lang-it|Villa dei Misteri}}) is a well-preserved suburban [[Roman villa]] on the outskirts of [[Pompeii]], southern [[Italy]], famous for the series of [[fresco]]s in one room, which are usually thought to show the initiation of a young woman into a [[Greco-Roman mysteries|Greco-Roman mystery cult]].  These are now probably the best known of the relatively rare survivals of [[Ancient Roman painting]]. Like the rest of the Roman city of Pompeii, the villa was buried in the [[eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79]] and excavated from 1909 onwards (long after much of the main city). It is now a popular part of tourist visits to Pompeii, and forms part of the [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] at Pompeii. 

==Overview==
Although covered with metres of ash and other volcanic material, the villa sustained only minor damage in the eruption of [[Mount Vesuvius|Vesuvius]] in 79 AD, and the majority of its walls, ceilings, and most particularly its frescoes survived largely undamaged. Since its excavation the roofing and other parts of the house have been maintained as necessary. 

The Villa is named for the paintings in one room of the residence. This space may have been a [[triclinium]], and is decorated with very fine [[fresco]]es, believed to be painted in the early-middle 1st century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Diotima|url = http://www.stoa.org/diotima/essays/seaford.shtml|website = www.stoa.org|accessdate = 2015-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the actual subject of the frescoes is hotly debated, the most common interpretation of the images is scenes of the initiation of a woman into a [[Dionysian Mysteries|special cult of Bacchus]], a [[mystery cult]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Antonio Virgili]], Culti misterici ed orientali a Pompei, Gangemi, Roma, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; that required specific rites and rituals to become a member. One of the defining features that help identify this as a Bacchian-related mural is the depiction of [[maenad]]s, the female followers of Bacchus. These devotees are often depicted dancing with swirling drapery and were found first on Greek pottery, many of which were made before the cult spread to Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Villa of the Mysteries Pompeii by Raichel Le Goff|url = http://www.raichel.org/articlesRaichel/Art-Research/N-vases.htm|website = www.raichel.org|accessdate = 2015-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Of all other interpretations, the most notable is that of [[Paul Veyne]], who believes that it depicts a young woman undergoing the rites of [[marriage]].

Though often believed to be a triclinium, the room with the frescoes could have also been a [[wikt:cubiculum|cubiculum]] of the matriarch, which would indicate that the matriarch was a member of the cult.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Pompeii.html|url = http://umich.edu/~kelseydb/Publications/spring2000/pompeii.html|website = umich.edu|accessdate = 2015-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Villa had both very fine rooms for dining and entertaining and more functional spaces. A wine-press was discovered when the Villa was excavated and has been restored in its original location. It was not uncommon for the homes of the very wealthy to include areas for the production of wine, olive oil, or other agricultural products, especially since many elite Romans owned farmland or orchards in the immediate vicinity of their villas.

The Villa may be easily accessed from Pompeii, lying some 400 metres northwest of the town walls, separated from it by a road with funerary monuments on either side. The Villa of the Mysteries was a suburban villa (Latin: ''villa suburbana'') with a close relationship to the city but not of it.

The ownership of the Villa is unknown, as is the case with many private homes in the city of Pompeii. However, certain artifacts give tantalizing clues. A bronze seal found in the villa names L. Istacidius Zosimus, a [[freedman]] of the powerful Istacidii family. Scholars have proposed him as the owner of the Villa or overseer of reconstruction after the [[62 Pompeii earthquake|earthquake of 62]].  The presence of a statue of [[Livia]], wife of [[Augustus]], has caused some historians to instead declare her to have been the owner.

As in other areas of [[Pompeii]] and [[Herculaneum]], a number of bodies were found in this villa, and [[plaster-of-Paris]] casts were made of them.

==Interpretation of the Frescoes==
There are many different interpretations of the frescoes, but they are commonly believed to depict a [[mystery religion|religious rite]]. Another common theory is that the frescoes depict a bride initiating into the [[Dionysian Mysteries|Bacchian Mysteries]] in preparation for marriage. In this hypothesis, the elaborate costume worn by the main figure is believed to be wedding apparel.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Based on the subject matter and order of each fresco, they are intended to be read as a single narrative. Women and satyrs are featured prominently. Because of the widely accepted theory of the mural depicting an initiation from the cult of [[Bacchus]], some think that the room with the frescoes was used to conduct rituals and celebrations related to the god.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

* The first mural shows a noble Roman woman (possibly the initiate's mother, who can cross no further) approaching a priestess or matron seated on a throne, by which stands a small boy reading a scroll – presumably the declaration of the initiation. On the other side of the throne the young initiate is shown in a purple robe and [[Myrtle (plant)|myrtle]] crown, holding a sprig of [[lauraceae|laurel]] and a tray of cakes. She appears to have been transformed into a serving girl, but may be bringing an offering to the god or goddess.&lt;ref name="Dionysian Mysteries"&gt;{{cite web|title=Dionysian Mysteries|url=http://www.mlahanas.de/Greeks/LX/DionysianMysteries.html|website=www.hellenica.de|accessdate=15 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The second mural depicts another priestess (or senior initiate) and her assistants preparing the ''[[liknon]]'' basket; at her feet are mysterious mushroom-shaped objects. At one side a ''[[Silenus|sileni]]'' (a horse element) is playing a [[lyre]]. ([[Silenus]] was the tutor and companion of [[Bacchus]].)&lt;ref name="Dionysian Mysteries"/&gt;
* The third mural shows a [[satyr]] playing the [[panpipe]]s and a [[nymph]] suckling a goat, in an [[Arcadia (utopia)|Arcadian scene]]. To their right, the initiate is in a panic. This is the last time we see her for a few scenes; when she appears again, she has changed. Some scholars think ''[[katabasis]]'' has occurred.&lt;ref name="Dionysian Mysteries"/&gt;
* In the direction to which she stares in horror, another mural shows a young satyr being offered a bowl of wine by Silenus while behind him, another satyr holds up a frightening mask which the drinking satyr sees reflected in the bowl (this may parallel the mirror into which young Bacchus stares in the [[Orphic Mysteries|Orphic rites]]). Next to them sits a goddess, ([[Ariadne]] or [[Semele]]), with Bacchus lying across her lap.&lt;ref name="Dionysian Mysteries"/&gt;
* The next mural shows the initiate returning. She now carries a staff and wears a cap, items often presented after the successful completion of an initiation ordeal. She kneels before the priestess, and appears to be whipped by a winged female figure. Next to her is a dancing figure (a [[Maenad]] or [[Thyiad]]) and a gowned figure with a [[thyrsus]] (an initiation symbol of Bacchus) made of long stalks of wrapped fennel, with a pine cone on top.&lt;ref name="Dionysian Mysteries"/&gt;
* In her penultimate appearance we see her being prepared with new clothes, while [[Eros (mythology)|Cupid]] holds up a mirror to her. After this scene, there is another image of Cupid.&lt;ref name="Dionysian Mysteries"/&gt;
* Finally, the initiate is shown enthroned and in an elaborate costume. This is all we know of the Roman rites of initiation.&lt;ref name="Dionysian Mysteries"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Linda Fierz-David, Katherine Bradway, Nor Hall, and [[Mary Beard (classicist)|Mary Beard]] and others have interpreted these murals.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.art-and-archaeology.com/timelines/rome/empire/vm/villaofthemysteries.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Edouard Léon Cortès''' (1882–1969) was a [[French people|French]] [[Post-impressionism|post-impressionist]] artist of French and [[Spanish people|Spanish]] ancestry. He is known as "Le Poete Parisien de la Peinture" or "the Parisian Poet of Painting" because of his diverse Paris cityscapes in a variety of weather and night settings.

== Personal life ==
Cortes was born on August 6, 1882, in [[Lagny-sur-Marne]], about twenty miles east of [[Paris]]. His father, Antonio Cortés, had been a painter for the [[Spanish monarchy|Spanish Royal Court]].

In 1914 Cortès married Fernande Joyeuse, with whom he had a daughter in 1916.

Although Cortès was a [[pacifist]], when war came close to his native village he was compelled to enlist in a French Infantry Regiment at the age of 32. As a contact agent Cortès was wounded by a bayonet, evacuated to a military hospital, and awarded the [[Croix de guerre 1914–1918 (France)|Croix de Guerre]]. After recovery he was the reassigned to use his artistic talent to sketch enemy positions. Later in life his convictions led him to refuse the [[Légion d'Honneur]] from the French Government. In 1919 he was demobilized.

His wife had died in 1918 and he soon married his sister-in-law Lucienne Joyeuse.

Cortès lived a simple life amid a close circle of friends. He died on November 28, 1969, in Lagny, and has a street named in his honor.

== Painting history ==
At the age of 17, Edouard began his studies at the [[École des Beaux-Arts]] in Paris. His first exhibition in 1901 brought him immediate recognition. Cortès stressed his independence. Once, in responding to a journalist who asked if he was a student of [[Luigi Loir]], he replied in pun: "Non, seul élève de moi-même." ("No, a student of myself only.")

His works were first exhibited in North America in 1945 and he subsequently achieved even greater success. In his last year of life he was awarded the prestigious [[Prix Antoine-Quinson]] from the [[Salon de Vincennes]].

== Lost and stolen paintings ==
On November 30, 2000, four paintings by Cortès were recovered in [[Kalispell, Montana]], following an eight-month investigation conducted by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]]'s [[San Francisco]] Division. The recovered paintings were stolen in 1988 during a burglary at the Simic Gallery in [[Carmel, California]].&lt;ref name="FBI"&gt;{{cite web|last=[[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] Theft Notices &amp; Recoveries |title=FBI — Art Theft Program |url=https://www.fbi.gov/hq/cid/arttheft/northamerica/us/cortes/cortes.htm |accessdate=2007-05-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070509090457/http://www.fbi.gov/hq/cid/arttheft/northamerica/us/cortes/cortes.htm |archivedate=May 9, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, a lost Cortès painting of a Paris street scene was discovered amongst donated items at a [[Goodwill Industries]] thrift store in [[Easton, Maryland]]. After an alert store manager noticed that it was a signed original, the painting was subsequently auctioned for $40,600 (US) at [[Sotheby's]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Easton Team Scores Big!|year=2008|publisher=Goodwill Connection|issue=II|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
