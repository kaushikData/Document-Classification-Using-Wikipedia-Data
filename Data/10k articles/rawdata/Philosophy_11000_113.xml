[[File:Kazimierz Mordasewicz - Portret Aleksandra Świętochowskiego 2.jpg|thumb|Aleksander Świętochowski, 1908]]
'''Aleksander Świętochowski''' ([[pseudonym]]s '''''Poseł Prawdy''''' [Apostle of Truth] and others; 18 January 1849 – 25 April 1938) was a [[Poland|Polish]] writer, educator, and philosopher of the [[Positivism in Poland|Positivist period]] that followed the [[January Uprising|January 1863 Uprising]].

He was widely regarded as the prophet of [[Positivism in Poland|Polish Positivism]], spreading in the [[Warsaw]] press the gospel of [[science|scientific inquiry]], [[education]], [[economic development]], and [[Civil rights|equality of rights]] for all, without regard to sex, class, ethnic origin or beliefs. His was a nuanced vision, however, that took account of the shortcomings of [[human nature]]; like [[H.G. Wells#Politics|H.G. Wells]], he advocated that power in society be wielded by the most enlightened among its members.

==Life==
Świętochowski was a journalist, literary critic, historian and [[philosopher]]—a founder and the leading ideologist of [[Positivism in Poland|Polish Positivism]].&lt;ref name="Aleksander p. 393"&gt;"Świętochowski, Aleksander," ''Encyklopedia Powszechna PWN'' (PWN Universal Encyclopedia), vol. 4, p. 393.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1871 he published in ''Przegląd Tygodniowy'' (The Weekly Review) a famous programmatic article of the Polish Positivists, "''My i wy''" ("We and You").&lt;ref name="Aleksander p. 679"&gt;"Świętochowski, Aleksander," ''[[Encyklopedia Polski]]'', p. 679.&lt;/ref&gt;

Świętochowski worked with many periodicals, including (1870–78) ''Przegląd Tygodniowy'' (The Weekly Review),&lt;ref name="Aleksander p. 679" /&gt; in 1876–78 as co-editor. In 1878–79 he edited the daily ''Nowiny'' (News);&lt;ref name="Aleksander p. 393" /&gt; when in 1882 it was bought by financier [[Stanisław Kronenberg]], its new owner, purportedly on Świętochowski's recommendation, entrusted the editorship to [[Bolesław Prus]].&lt;ref&gt;Krystyna Tokarzówna and Stanisław Fita, ''Bolesław Prus, 1847–1912: Kalendarz życia i twórczości'' (Bolesław Prus, 1847–1912: A Calendar of His Life and Work), p. 251.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1881–1902 Świętochowski edited and published ''Prawda'' (The Truth), which he had founded.&lt;ref name="Aleksander p. 393" /&gt;

In 1881 he lost his little son. Unable to regain his equilibrium, in mid-February 1882, on the advice of Dr. [[Tytus Chałubiński]], he went on a journey to [[Italy]]. He would recall in his ''Pamiętnik'' (Memoirs):

{{blockquote|During my two-month journey, [Władysław] Smoleński stood in for me in editing ''Prawda''; and, in writing columns—[[Bolesław Prus|[Bolesław] Prus]], with whom, after the fading of the memory of [our] [[polemical]] [[skirmish]]es of the "Young Press" period, I shared a renewed mutual sympathy.&lt;ref&gt;Krystyna Tokarzówna and Stanisław Fita, ''Bolesław Prus, 1847–1912: Kalendarz życia i twórczości'' (Bolesław Prus, 1847–1912: A Calendar of His Life and Work), p. 247.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1905 Świętochowski founded, and subsequently led, ''Stronnictwo Postępowo-Demokratyczne'' (the Progressive-Democratic Party), which after 1918 was somewhat aligned with the [[National Democracy|National Democratic Party]].&lt;ref name="Aleksander p. 393" /&gt; He worked with the National Democrats in opposing [[socialism]], but their [[nationalism]] and [[racism]] were alien to him, and the National Democrats never regarded him as one of their own.&lt;ref name="Polish Literature p. 287"&gt;[[Czesław Miłosz]], ''The History of Polish Literature'', p. 287.&lt;/ref&gt;

Świętochowski founded and was president of ''Towarzystwo Kultury Polskiej'' (the Polish Culture Society, 1906–13) and editor and publisher of its organ, ''Kultura Polska'' (Polish Culture).&lt;ref name="Aleksander p. 393" /&gt;

From 1912 until his death in 1938, Świętochowski lived in [[Gołotczyzna]], a village 67 kilometers north of [[Warsaw]], where he established intimate intellectual and personal ties with Aleksandra Bąkowska. As early as 1909, he had inspired the creation, in Gołotczyzna, of a [[home economics|home-economics]] school for village girls, established by Bąkowska; and three years later, an agriculture school for boys, called ''Bratne''. He regarded these institutions as his greatest achievement in the realm of [[education]].&lt;ref&gt;Information from the [[:pl:Aleksander Świętochowski|Polish Wikipedia]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Świętochowski died at [[Gołotczyzna]] on 25 April 1938 and was buried in the cemetery at [[Sońsk]], near [[Ciechanów]].

His son [[Ryszard Świętochowski]] (Warsaw, 17 October 1882 – 1941, [[Auschwitz]]) was an engineer, journalist and politician who supported [[Władysław Sikorski]], and published many papers in the field of [[physics]]; he died at [[Auschwitz Concentration Camp]].

==Views==
As the leading ideologist and exponent of the latter-19th-century Polish philosophical and cultural movement known as "[[Positivism in Poland|Polish Positivism]]," Świętochowski was an uncompromising critic of outdated traditions and obscurantism, and a spokesman for the fostering of knowledge and education.&lt;ref name="Aleksander p. 393" /&gt;

A complement to this optimistic [[scientism]] was his reflections on the limitations of [[human nature]] ("''Dumania pesymisty''" ["Reflections of a Pessimist"], ''Przegląd Tygodniowy'' [The Weekly Review], 1876), which led him to contrast [[Wise old man|sage]] [[leader]]s with [[egotism|egotistic]] [[society|societal]] [[collective]]s. Over the years, this concern of his would recur in a number of his [[play (theatre)|play]]s and [[short story|stories]].&lt;ref name="Aleksander p. 393" /&gt;

[[Czesław Miłosz]] describes him: "A brilliant man, a sharp, even violent, polemicist against the conservatives, accused by his adversaries of haughtiness... he edited the periodical ''Truth'' ''(Prawda)'', signing his articles 'Truth's [Apostle].'"&lt;ref&gt;[[Czesław Miłosz]], ''The History of Polish Literature'', p. 286.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{blockquote|As a creative writer [writes Miłosz], he cannot be accorded a very lofty position. He seemed even in his own day excessively cerebral; and his [play]s, for instance, are nothing but cold [pyrotechnics] of [[dialogue]]s. Among his works, one of the most important is a two-volume [''Brief History of Poland's Peasants''].&lt;ref name="Polish Literature p. 287" /&gt;}}

{{blockquote|[Nevertheless, w]hile his literary creations have not withstood the test of time and are not among the living artistic works of Polish literature, he will remain in Polish culture the personality that most fully embodied the ideals of the age, the activist and journalist most  representative of the period, "the [[Pope]] of [[Warsaw]] [[progressivism]]," a tireless opponent of superstition and stupidity, the unmasker of patriotic and religious cant.&lt;ref&gt;Jan Zygmunt Jakubowski, ed., ''Literatura polska od średniowiecza do pozytywizmu'' (Polish Literature from the Middle Ages to Positivism), p. 594.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Artificial philosophy''' is a [[philosophy|philosophical]] branch conceived by author Louis Molnar&lt;ref&gt;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/267156955_A_Step_Beyond_AI_Artificial_Philosophy "article: Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence and Applications", ResearchGate, (retrieved November 25, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; to consider what a being bestowed with [[artificial intelligence]] (AI) might consider about its own [[existence]] once it reaches a higher state of [[consciousness]]. The author reasons in his dissertation that at some point, either through [[Computer_programming|programming]] or organic [[self-development]], [[robot]]s will not see themselves as extensions of those that created them, and that their saying "Who am I?" will not lead them to think of themselves as one with [[human]]s.

[[File:Berlinische Monatsschrift.jpg|thumbnail|Cover, 1783]]
The '''''Berlinische Monatsschrift''''' was a monthly magazine published by [[Johann Erich Biester]] and [[Friedrich Gedike]] (though the latter resigned his editorship in 1791).

It served primarily as the mouthpiece for the [[Berliner Mittwochsgesellschaft]] (Berlin Wednesday Society). It is considered [[Immanuel Kant]]’s preferred magazine, mainly due to its debate on the question of ‘What is Enlightenment?’

The magazine was initially published between 1783 and 1796. This was succeeded by the ''Berlinische Blätter'', published by Biester, between 1797 and 1798.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://katalogplus.ub.uni-bielefeld.de/cgi-bin/new_titel.cgi?katkey=2239816&amp;query=berlinische+monatsschrift&amp;vr=1&amp;pagesize=10&amp;bestand=lok&amp;sess=88c617009f1ef19f94263cbffa8e1af8|title=Berlinische Monatschrift|website=katalogplus.ub.uni-bielefeld.de}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was then revived by Friedrich Nicolai, who published it as ''Neue Berlinische Monatsschrift'' from 1799 until 1811.

In 1998 all 58 editions of the ''Berlinische Monatsschrift'', plus its successors, amounting to approximately 30,300 pages, were digitised by the library of the [[Bielefeld University]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3590">In [[biology]], '''biological specificity''' is the tendency of a characteristic such as a [[behavior]] or a [[biochemical]] variation to occur in a particular [[species]]. 

Biochemist [[Linus Pauling]] stated that "Biological specificity is the set of characteristics of living organisms or constituents of living organisms of being special or doing something special. Each animal or plant species is special. It differs in some way from all other species... biological specificity is the major problem about understanding life."&lt;ref name="Pauling"&gt;[[Linus Pauling]], Barbara Marinacci, ''Linus Pauling in His Own Words: Selections From His Writings, Speeches and Interviews'', (1995), p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;

Characteristics may further be described as being '''interspecific''', '''intraspecific''', and '''conspecific'''.

'''Interspecificity''' (literally ''between/among species''), or being '''interspecific''', describes issues between individuals of separate [[species]]. These may include:
* [[Interspecies communication]], communication between different species of animals, plants, fungi or bacteria
* [[Interspecific competition]], when individuals of different species compete for the same resource in an ecosystem
* [[Interspecific feeding]], when adults of one species feed the young of another species
* [[Interspecific hybrid]]ization
* [[Biological interaction|Interspecific interaction]], the effects organisms in a community have on one another
* [[Interspecific pregnancy]], pregnancy involving an embryo or fetus belonging to another species than the carrier
===Intraspecific===
'''Intraspecificity''' (literally ''within species''), or being '''intraspecific''', describes behaviors, [[biochemical]] variations and other issues within individuals of a single [[species]]. These may include:
* [[Intraspecific antagonism]], when individuals of the same species are hostile to one another
* [[Intraspecific competition]], when individuals or groups of individuals from the same species compete for the same resource in an ecosystem
* [[Intraspecific hybrid|Intraspecific hybridization]]
* [[Intraspecific mimicry]]
===Conspecific===
{{Anchor|conspecificdefinition}}Two or more individual [[organism]]s, [[population]]s, or [[taxa]] are '''conspecific''' if they belong to the same [[species]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.biology-online.org/dictionary/Conspecificity|title=Conspecificity|publisher=Biology online|accessdate= 5 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Where different species can interbreed and their gametes compete, the conspecific gametes take precedence over heterospecific gametes. This is known as conspecific [[sperm precedence]], or conspecific pollen precedence in plants.
===Heterospecific===
The [[antonym]] of conspecificity is the term '''heterospecificity''': two individuals are heterospecific if they are considered to belong to different biological species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.biology-online.org/dictionary/Heterospecificity|title=Heterospecificity|publisher=Biology online|accessdate= 5 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Blanche Christine Olschak''' (1913-1989) was an Austrian journalist and writer, [[Tibet]]an specialist and wrote the first comprehensive encyclopedia of women in the world.

==Biography==
Blanche Christine Olschak was born on 24 July 1913 in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]] to Austro-Hungarian parents, Joseph Olschak and Lilly Helene Büchelen.&lt;ref name="French biography"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bigger|first1=Andreas|title=Olschak, Blanche Christine|url=http://www.hls-dhs-dss.ch/textes/f/F44656.php?topdf=1|publisher=Dictionnaire historique de la Suisse|accessdate=25 August 2015|location=Bern, Switzerland|language=French|date=18 July 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; She studied at the [[University of Graz]], earning a PhD in economics and political science in 1937&lt;ref name="New Yorker"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Grant|first1=Jane|last2=Hellman|first2=Geoffrey T.|title=Oly's Opus|journal=The New Yorker|date=11 February 1956|page=23|publisher=Condé Nast|location=New York, New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the following year married the engineer Robert Schneiter.&lt;ref name="French biography" /&gt; She began to focus on Asian topics, specifically [[Tibetology]], [[Buddhist philosophy]] and [[Buddhism and psychology|psychology]], and Early [[History of Central Asia|Central Asian History]]&lt;ref name="German bio" /&gt; and wrote about women in Asian societies.&lt;ref name="New Yorker" /&gt; In 1945, Olschak fled to [[Salzburg]], and worked as an editor at the ''Alpen-Journal'', but her husband became a prisoner of war in 1946&lt;ref name="French biography" /&gt; and died in a [[concentration camp]].&lt;ref name="New Yorker" /&gt; At that time, Olschak fled again, going to [[Zurich]], [[Switzerland]].&lt;ref name="German bio"&gt;{{cite web|title=Blanche Christine Olschak|url=http://waldgut.ch/e35/e690/e1341/|website=Waldgut|publisher=Waldgut Verlag|accessdate=25 August 2015|location=Konstanz, Germany|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after arriving in Switzerland, Olschak published ''Das Mädchen Katharina; Miniaturen aus den Jugendjahren der grossen Kaiserin'' (1947).&lt;ref name="1st book"&gt;{{cite web|title=Olschak, Blanche Christine, Das Mädchen Katharina|url=http://book.ac/117639.html|website=Book AC|publisher=Comenius-Antiquariat|accessdate=25 August 2015|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; She became a foreign correspondent for several Austrian newspapers and traveled throughout the Far East&lt;ref name="New Yorker" /&gt; to China, the Himalayas, Japan, Java, Korea, Mongolia and Tibet to conduct research.&lt;ref name="German bio" /&gt; In 1949, she was hired by ''Encyclic Verlag'' of Zurich to create the first encyclopedia of women which had ever been published. The work was comprehensive and covered cultural, economic, political and sociological aspects of women's lives from throughout the world. In the mid-1950s, the project was looking for a publisher to extend the work to the Americas&lt;ref name="New Yorker" /&gt; and inspired [[Ángela Acuña Braun]] to create a historical social study of ''Costa Rican Women Through Four Centuries''&lt;ref name="Santana"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Santana|first1=Robert|title=Beneméritos de la Patria: Ángela Acuña Brawn|url=http://www.asamblea.go.cr/Centro_de_informacion/Sala_Audiovisual/Benemritos%20de%20la%20patria/Forms/DispForm.aspx?ID=77|website=Asamblea Legislativa de a República de Costa Rica|publisher=Asamblea Legislativa de a República de Costa Rica|accessdate=1 August 2015|location=San José, Costa Rica|language=Spanish|date=8 December 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160402152953/http://www.asamblea.go.cr/Centro_de_informacion/Sala_Audiovisual/Benemritos%20de%20la%20patria/Forms/DispForm.aspx?ID=77|archivedate=2 April 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which took Acuña nearly two decades to compile and publish.&lt;ref name="biography CEDUCAR"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ángela Acuña Braun|url=http://www.ceducar.info/ceducar/recursos/biblioteca-virtual/bio-ANGELA-ACUNA-BRAUN.pdf|website=Comunidad Educativa de Centroamérica y República Dominicana|publisher=Ministerio de Educación Pública|accessdate=2 August 2015|location=San José, Costa Rica|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1961, she founded an organization, "Verein für tibetische Heimstätten in der Schweiz", for receiving Tibetan refugees and assisting with immigration into Switzerland&lt;ref name=DODIS&gt;{{cite web|title=Verein für tibetische Heimstätten in der Schweiz, dodis.ch/R22453|url=http://dodis.ch/R22453|website=dodis.ch|publisher=Documents Diplomatiques Suisses|accessdate=25 August 2015|location=Zurich, Switzerland|language=German|date=1961}}&lt;/ref&gt; in conjunction with the Red Cross.&lt;ref name="French biography" /&gt; Under her own initiative, she took study courses with Constantin Regamey and Geshé Thupten Wangyal, attending conferences and writing scientific papers on Tibetan culture. For her scientific studies,&lt;ref name="French biography" /&gt; she was awarded the title of professor by the Austrian Federal Ministry of Science and Research in 1981 and awarded a Golden Doctorate in 1987.&lt;ref name="German bio" /&gt;

Olschak died on 25 June 1989 in Zurich, Switzerland.&lt;ref name="French biography" /&gt;

==Selected works==
All of her early works were in German. In the late-1960s works began appearing in both English and French. She continued publishing until her death and several works were published posthumously.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3751">In [[neuroscience]] the '''bridge locus''' for a particular sensory [[percept]] is a hypothetical set of [[neuron]]s whose activity is the basis of that sensory percept. The term was introduced by D.N. Teller and E.Y. Pugh, Jr. in 1983, and has been sparingly used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=D.N. Teller |author2=E.Y. Pugh, Jr. |title=Colour Vision |editors=J.D. Mollon, L.T. Sharpe |year=1983 |publisher=Academic Press |pages=581 |isbn=978-0-12-504280-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Activity in the bridge locus neurons is postulated to be [[necessary and sufficient conditions|necessary and sufficient]] for sensory perception: if the bridge locus neurons are not active, then the sensory perception does not occur, regardless of the actual sensory input. Conversely if the bridge locus neurons are active, then sensory perception occurs, regardless of the actual sensory input. It is the highest neural level of a sensory perception. So, for example, [[retina]]l neurons are not considered a bridge locus for visual perception because stimulating [[visual cortex]] can give rise to [[phosphene|visual percepts]].&lt;ref&gt;Davida Y Teller "Linking propositions" Vision Research (1984)&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all scholars believe in such a [[neural correlate of consciousness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Quest for Consciousness |author=Christof Koch |page=88 |publisher=Roberts and Company Publishers |year=2004 |isbn13=9780974707709}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pessoa et al., for example, argue that there is no necessity for a bridge locus, basing their argument on the requirement of an isomorphism between neural states and conscious states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Neural Correlates of Consciousness |editor=Thomas Metzinger |chapter=What is a Neural Correlate of Consciousness |author=David J. Chalmers |page=37 |publisher=MIT Press |year=2000 |isbn13=9780262133708}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=November 2011}} Thompson argues that there are good reasons to think that the notion of a bridge locus, which he calls a "localizationist approach", is misguided, questioning the premise that there has to be one particular neural stage whose activity forms the immediate substrate of perception. He argues, based upon work by Zeki &amp; Shipp, DeYoe &amp; Van Essen, and others, that brain regions are not independent stages or modules but have dense forward and backward projections that act reciprocally, and that visual processing is highly interactive and context-dependent. He also argues that cells in the visual cortex "are not mere 'feature detectors{{'"}}, and that neuroscience has revealed that the brain in fact employs distributed networks, rather than centralized representations. He equates the notion of a bridge locus to a [[Cartesian theatre]] and suggests that as a notion it should be abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Consciousness and Intentionality |editor=Denis Fisette |chapter=Filling-in: Visual Science and the Philosophy of Perception |author=Evan Thompson |page=156 |publisher=Springer |year=1999 |isbn13=9780792359074}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many [[independent software vendor]]s (ISVs), [[value-added reseller]]s (VARs), and hardware [[vendor]]s ([[Original equipment manufacturer|OEM]]s or [[Original design manufacturer|ODM]]s) use open-source [[Software framework|framework]]s, modules, and [[Library (computing)|libraries]] inside their proprietary, for-profit products and services.&lt;ref name="Popp1"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Popp | first1 = Dr. Karl Michael | last2 = Meyer | first2 = Ralf | title = Profit from Software Ecosystems: Business Models, Ecosystems and Partnerships in the Software Industry | year = 2010 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=i1VGDLCMyKAC | publisher = Books on Demand | location = Norderstedt, Germany | isbn = 9783839169834}}&lt;/ref&gt; From a customer's perspective, the ability to use open technology under standard commercial terms and support is valuable. They are willing to pay for the legal protection (e.g., indemnification from copyright or patent infringement), "commercial-grade QA", and professional support/training/consulting that are typical of commercial software, while also receiving the benefits of fine-grained control and lack of lock-in that comes with open-source.&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

== Funding ==

Much unlike proprietary off-the-shelf software that come with restrictive licenses, open-source software is distributed freely, through the web and in physical media. Because creators cannot require each user to pay a license fee to fund development this way, a number of alternative development funding models have emerged.

An example of those funding models is when bespoke software is developed as a consulting project for one or more customers who request it. These customers pay developers to have this software developed according to their own needs and they could also closely direct the developers' work. If both parties agree, the resulting software could then be publicly released with an open-source license in order to allow subsequent adoption by other parties. That agreement could reduce the costs paid by the clients while the original developers (or independent consultants) can then charge for training, installation, [[technical support]], or further customization if and when more interested customers would choose to use it after the initial release.

There also exist [[stipend]]s to support the development of open source software, such as [[Google]]'s [[Summer of Code]].&lt;ref name="LinSOC"&gt;{{cite web | title = Google's Summer of Code concludes | first = Bruce | last = Byfield | date= 21 September 2005 | url = https://www.linux.com/news/googles-summer-code-concludes | quote = DiBona said that the SOC was designed to benefit everyone involved in it. Students had the chance to work on real projects, rather than academic ones, and to get paid while gaining experience and making contacts. FOSS projects benefited from getting new code and having the chance to recruit new developers. | publisher = [[linux.com]] | accessdate = 18 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another approach to funding is to provide the software freely, but sell licenses to proprietary add-ons such as data libraries. For instance, an open-source [[computer-aided design|CAD]] program may require parts libraries which are sold on a subscription or flat-fee basis. Open-source software can also promote the sale of specialized hardware that it interoperates with, some example cases being the [[Asterisk (PBX)|Asterisk]] telephony software developed by PC-telephony hardware manufacturer [[Digium]] and the [[Robot Operating System]] (ROS) robotics platform by Willow Garage and Stanford AI Labs. Many open source software projects have begun as research projects within universities, as personal projects of students or professors, or as tools to aid scientific research. The influence of universities and research institutions on open-source shows in the number of projects named after their host institutions, such as [[BSD Unix]], [[CMU Common Lisp]], or the [[NCSA HTTPd]] which evolved into [[Apache Web server|Apache]].

Companies may employ developers to work on open-source projects that are useful to the company's infrastructure: in this case, it is developed not as a product to be sold but as a sort of shared public utility. A local bug-fix or solution to a software problem, written by a developer either at a company's request or to make his/her own job easier, can be released as an open-source contribution without costing the company anything.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Holtgrewe | first = Ursula | title = Articulating the Speed(s) of the Internet: The Case of Open Source/Free Software | journal = [[Time &amp; Society]] | date = March 2004 | volume = 13 | pages = 129–146 | doi = 10.1177/0961463X04040750}}&lt;/ref&gt; A larger project such as the Linux kernel may have contributors from dozens of companies which use and depend upon it, as well as hobbyist and research developers.

A new funding approach for open-source projects is [[crowdfunding]], organized over web platforms like [[Kickstarter]], [[Indiegogo]], or [[Bountysource]].&lt;ref name="yahoofinance"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bountysource-raises-1-1-million-130000440.html | title = Bountysource Raises $1.1 Million for the First Crowdfunding Platform for Open-Source Software Projects | website = Yahoo Finance | publisher = Marketwired | date = 16 July 2013 | accessdate = 18 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Challenges ==
{{cleanup merge|Commercial open-source applications}}
{{refimprove section|date=December 2013}}
[[Open-source software]] can be sold and used in general [[Commerce|commercially]]. Also, commercial open-source applications have been a part of the [[software industry]] for some time.&lt;ref name="Popp1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://timreview.ca/article/229 | title = F/LOSS is Commercial Software | date = February 2009 | accessdate = 18 June 2016 | first = David A. | last = Wheeler | website = Technology Innovation Management Review | publisher = Talent First Network}}&lt;/ref&gt; While commercialization or funding of open-source software projects is possible, it is considered challenging.&lt;ref name="LAS300RMS"&gt;{{cite AV media | first = Richard | last = Stallman | date = 11 March 2012 | title = Richard Stallman (S20E10) | type = Podcast | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=radmjL5OIaA&amp;t=0h53m46s | access-date = 18 June 2016 | time = 0:53:46 | quote = I'm not going to claim that I got a way to make it easier to raise money to pay people who write free software. We all know, that to some extent there are ways to do that, but we all know that they are limited, they are not as broad as we would like. | publisher = [[Jupiter Broadcasting]] | series = The Linux Action Show}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since several [[open-source license]]s stipulate that authors of derivative works must distribute them under an open-source ([[copyleft]]) license, ISVs and VARs have to develop new legal and technical mechanisms to foster their commercial goals,&lt;ref name="Popp2"&gt;{{cite book | first = Dr. Karl Michael | last = Popp | title = Best Practices for commercial use of open source software | year = 2015 | publisher = Books on Demand | location = Norderstedt, Germany | isbn = 978-3738619096}}&lt;/ref&gt; as many traditional mechanisms are not directly applicable anymore.

Traditional business wisdom suggests that a company's methods, assets, and intellectual properties should remain concealed from market competitors ([[trade secret]]) as long as possible to maximize the profitable commercialization time of a new product.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | first = S. | last = Donovan | title = Patent, copyright and trade secret protection for software | journal = IEEE Potentials | volume = 13 | issue = 3 | publication-date = 1994 | page = 20 | quote = Essentially there are only three ways to protect computer software under the law: patent it, register a copyright for it, or keep it as a trade secret. | date = 6 August 2002 | issn = 0278-6648 | doi = 10.1109/45.310923}}&lt;/ref&gt; Open-source software development minimizes the effectiveness of this tactic; development of the product is usually performed in view of the public, allowing competing projects or [[Clone (computing)|clones]] to incorporate new features or improvements as soon as the public code repository is updated, as permitted by most open-source licenses.  Also in the computer hardware domain, a hardware producer who provides free and open software drivers reveals the knowledge about hardware implementation details to competitors, who might use this knowledge to catch up.

Therefore, there is considerable debate about whether vendors can make a sustainable business from an open-source strategy. In terms of a traditional software company, this is probably the wrong question to ask. Looking at the landscape of open source applications, many of the larger ones are sponsored (and largely written) by system companies such as [[IBM]] who may not have an objective of software license revenues. Other software companies, such as Oracle and Google, have sponsored or delivered significant open-source code bases. These firms' motivation tends to be more strategic, in the sense that they are trying to change the rules of a marketplace and reduce the influence of vendors such as Microsoft. Smaller vendors doing open-source work may be less concerned with immediate revenue growth than developing a large and loyal community, which may be the basis of a corporate valuation at merger time.

== Approaches ==
A variety of open-source compatible business approaches have gained prominence in recent years{{According to whom|date=October 2013}}; notable examples include [[dual licensing]], [[software as a service]], not charging for the software but for services, [[freemium]], donation-based funding, [[crowdfunding]], and [[crowdsourcing]].

There are several different types of [[business model]]s for making [[Profit (economics)|profit]] using [[open-source software]] (OSS) or [[funding]] the creation. Below are existing and legal commercial business approaches in context of open-source software and open-source licenses.&lt;ref name="Popp2"/&gt; The acceptance of these approaches varies; some of these approaches are recommended (like selling services), others are accepted, while still others are considered controversial or even unethical by the open-source community. The underlying objective of these [[business model]]s is to harness the size and international scope of the [[open-source community]] (typically more than an order of magnitude larger than what would be achieved with [[closed-source]] models) for a sustainable commercial venture.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} The vast majority of commercial open-source companies experience a conversion ratio (as measured by the percentage of downloaders who buy something) well below 1%, so low-cost and highly-scalable marketing and sales functions are key to these firms' profitability.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

=== Dual-licensing ===
{{main|Multi-licensing}}
[[Dual licensing]] offers the software under an [[open-source license]] but also under separate proprietary license terms. The proprietary version can be sold to finance the continued development of the free open-source version.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite book | first = Jean | last = Solatan | title = Advances in software economics: A reader on business models and Partner Ecosystems in the software industry | year = 2011 | publisher = BOD | location = Norderstedt, Germany | isbn = 978-3-8448-0405-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Customers can be attracted to a no-cost and open-source edition, then be part of an [[Upselling|up-sell]] to a commercial enterprise edition. Further, customers will learn of open-source software in a company's portfolio and offerings but generate business in other proprietary products and solutions, including commercial [[technical support]] contracts and services. A popular example is [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]]'s [[MySQL]] [[database]] which is dual-licensed under a commercial proprietary license as also under the [[GPLv2]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.mysql.com/about/legal/licensing/oem/#5 | title = Commercial License for OEMs, ISVs and VARs | at = Q4: What is Oracle's dual license model for MySQL software? | website = MySQL.com | publisher = [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]] | date = July 2010 | accessdate = 18 June 2016 | quote = Oracle makes its MySQL database server and MySQL Client Libraries available under both the GPL and a commercial license. As a result, developers who use or distribute open source applications under the GPL can use the GPL-licensed MySQL software, and OEMs, ISVs and VARs that do not want to combine or distribute the MySQL software with their own commercial software under a GPL license can purchase a commercial license.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example is the [[Sleepycat License]]. [[Flask (web framework)|Flask]] developer Armin Ronacher stated that the [[Affero General Public License|AGPL]]v3 was a "terrible success" as "vehicle for dual commercial licensing" and noted that [[MongoDB]], [[RethinkDB]], [[OpenERP]], [[SugarCRM]] as well as [[WURFL]] utilizing the license for this purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://lucumr.pocoo.org/2013/7/23/licensing/ | title = Licensing in a Post Copyright World | date = 23 July 2013 | first = Armin | last = Ronacher | at = What Changed in 2007 | website = Armin Ronacher's Thoughts and Writings | accessdate = 18 June 2016 | quote = The AGPLv3 was a terrible success, especially among the startup community that found the perfect base license to make dual licensing with a commercial license feasible. MongoDB, RethinkDB, OpenERP, SugarCRM as well as WURFL all now utilize the AGPLv3 as a vehicle for dual commercial licensing. The AGPLv3 makes that generally easy to accomplish as the original copyright author has the rights to make a commercial license possible but nobody who receives the sourcecode itself through the APLv3 inherits that right. I am not sure if that was the intended use of the license, but that's at least what it's definitely being used for now.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Selling professional services ===

The [[financial return]] of [[cost]]s on open-source software can also come from selling [[Service (economics)|services]], such as training, [[technical support]], or [[Information technology consulting|consulting]], rather than the software itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.linuxinsider.com/story/79341.html | title = FOSS in the Enterprise: To Pay or Not to Pay? | date = 5 November 2013 | first = Jack M. | last = Germain | website = LinuxInsider | publisher = ECT News Network, Inc. | accessdate = 18 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.cio.com/article/2388344/open-source-tools/6-reasons-to-pay-for-open-source-software.html | title = 6 Reasons to Pay for Open Source Software | date = 13 February 2013 | first = Paul | last = Rubens | website = CIO | publisher = CXO Media Inc. | accessdate = 18 June 2016 | quote = Open source software is free to download, modify and use, but that doesn't mean it's not worth paying for sometimes. If you're using open source software in a commercial, enterprise capacity, here are six reasons why you should pay for free software.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another possibility is offering open-source software in [[source code]] form only, while providing [[executable]] binaries to paying customers only, offering the commercial service of [[compiling]] and [[package (package management system)|packaging]] of the software. Also, providing goods like physical [[Data storage device|installation media]] (e.g., [[DVD]]s) can be a commercial service.

Open-source companies using this business model successfully are for instance [[RedHat]] and [[IBM]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.wired.com/2012/03/red-hat/ | title = Red Hat Becomes Open Source’s First $1 Billion Baby | first = Robert | last = McMillan | date = 28 March 2012 | accessdate = 18 June 2016 | publisher = [[Wired (website)|Wired]] | quote = Other companies have made big money selling Linux — Intel, IBM, Dell, and others have used it as a way to sell hardware and support services — but Red Hat has managed the tricky business of building a software platform that big businesses will pay for.}}&lt;/ref&gt; a more specialized example is that of [[Revolution Analytics]].

=== Selling of branded merchandise ===
Some open-source organizations such as the [[Mozilla Foundation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.mozillazine.org/articles/article4484.html | title = Mozilla Foundation Open Letter Orders Unofficial Mozilla Merchandise Sellers to Stop, Legal Action Hinted | first = Gervase | last = Markham | date = 16 March 2004 | accessdate = 18 June 2016 | website = MozillaZine}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Wikimedia Foundation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://store.wikimedia.org/ | title = Wikipedia Store | publisher = Wikimedia Foundation | year = 2016 | accessdate = 18 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; sell branded merchandise articles like [[t-shirt]]s and coffee mugs. This can be also seen as an additional service provided to the [[user community]].

=== Selling of certificates and trademark use ===
{{main|Franchising}}
Another financing approach is innovated by [[Moodle]], an open source [[learning management system]] and community platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://opensource.com/education/14/10/open-access-learning-moodle | title = Moodle will always be an open source project | date = 6 October 2014 | first = Samantha | last = Gartner | website = opensource.com | accessdate = 18 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://oss-watch.ac.uk/resources/cs-moodle | title = Moodle: a case study in sustainability | date = 22 January 2014 | publication-date = 5 June 2007 | first = Martin | last = Dougiamas | website = OSS Watch | publisher = University of Oxford | accessdate = 18 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The business model revolves around a network of commercial partners&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://moodle.com/partners/about/ | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140722023159/http://moodle.com/partners/about/ | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 22 July 2014 | title = How do the Moodle Partners work? | year = 2012 | website = Moodle | accessdate = 18 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; who are certificated and therefore authorised to use the Moodle [[Trademark|name]] and [[logo]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://moodle.com/trademarks/ | title = The Moodle Trademark | year = 2016 | website = Moodle | accessdate = 18 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in turn provide a proportion of revenue to the Moodle Trust, which funds core development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2012/03/27/blackboard-buys-moodlerooms-creates-open-source-division | title = Blackboard's Open-Source Pivot | website = Inside Higher Ed | date = 27 March 2012 | first = Steve | last = Kolowich | accessdate = 18 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Selling software as a service===
Selling [[subscription business model|subscriptions]] for online accounts and server access to customers is a way of making profit based on open-source software. Also, combining desktop software with a service, called [[software plus services]]. Providing [[cloud computing]] services or [[software as a service]] (SaaS) without the release of the open-source software itself, neither in binary nor in source form, conforms with most open-source licenses (with exception of the [[Affero General Public License|AGPL]]).

Because of its lack of software freedoms, [[Richard Stallman]] calls SaaS "inherently bad" while acknowledging its legality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://gigaom.com/2013/08/06/hactivist-richard-stallman-takes-on-proprietary-software-saas-and-open-source/ | title = Hacktivist Richard Stallman takes on proprietary software, SaaS and open source | first = Rani | last = Molla | date = 6 August 2013 | website = Gigaom | publisher = Knowingly, Inc. | accessdate = 18 June 2016 | quote = He (...) claims software as a service (SaaS) is inherently bad because your information goes through a server beyond your control and that server can add additional software when it likes.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2008/sep/29/cloud.computing.richard.stallman | title = Cloud computing is a trap, warns GNU founder Richard Stallman | first = Bobbie | last = Johnson | publisher = [[The Guardian]] | date = 29 September 2008 | accessdate = 18 June 2016 | quote = Web-based programs like Google's Gmail will force people to buy into locked, proprietary systems that will cost more and more over time, according to the free software campaigner}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FSF called the [[server-side]] use-case without release of the source-code the "[[Application service provider|ASP]] loophole in the GPLv2" and encourage therefore the use of the [[Affero General Public License]] which plugged this hole in 2002.&lt;ref name="fsf"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.gnu.org/licenses/index.html | title = Licenses | at = The GNU Affero General Public License | publisher = Free Software Foundation | website = GNU Project | accessdate = 18 June 2016 | quote = We recommend that people consider using the GNU AGPL for any software which will commonly be run over a network.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://opensource.org/node/152 | title = GNU Affero GPL version 3 and the "ASP loophole" | date = 7 June 2007 | first = Michael | last = Tiemann | publisher = [[Open Source Initiative]] | accessdate = 18 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 the FSF contemplated  including the special provision of AGPLv1 into [[GPLv3]] but ultimately decided to keep the licenses separate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#SeparateAffero | title = Frequently Asked Questions about the GNU Licenses | at = Why did you decide to write the GNU Affero GPLv3 as a separate license? | date = 26 May 2016 | website = GNU Project | publisher = [[Free Software Foundation]] | accessdate = 18 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Partnership with funding organizations ===
Other financial situations include partnerships with other companies. [[Governments]], [[universities]], companies, and non-governmental organizations may develop internally or hire a contractor for custom in-house modifications, then release that code under an open-source license. Some organizations support the development of open-source software by [[grants]] or [[stipend]]s, like [[Google|Google's]] [[Summer of Code]] initiative founded in 2005.&lt;ref name="LinSOC"/&gt;

=== Voluntary donations ===
{{main|Donationware}}
Also, there were experiments by Independent developers to fund development of open-source software [[donation]]-driven directly by the users, e.g., with the [[Illumination Software Creator]] in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2012/06/help-linux-tycoon-more-go-open-source |publisher=OMGUbuntu |first=Joey-Elijah |last=Sneddon |date=2012-06-01 |accessdate=2013-08-08 |title=Will You Help Change The Way Open-Source Apps are Funded? |quote=Lunduke is pledging to open-source and distribute his portfolio of hitherto paid software – which includes the Linux distro management simulator Linux Tycoon -  for free, under the GPL, if he can reach a donation-driven funding goal of $4000/m. Reaching this goal, Lunduke says, 'will provide proof for others, who would also like to move their software businesses to be open source, that it is doable.'}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2011 to 2016 [[SourceForge]] allowed users to donate to hosted projects that opted to accept donations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://sourceforge.net/p/forge/documentation/Donations/?version=1 | date = 4 March 2011 | title = SourceForge.net Donation System | first = Elizabeth | last = Naramore | website = [[SourceForge]] | publisher = Slashdot Media | access-date = 16 October 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Update inline|?=yes|reason=SourceForge no longer uses this system, perhaps a better example could be used|date=October 2017}} Internet [[micro-payment]]s systems like [[PayPal]], [[flattr]], and [[Bitcoin]] help this approach.

Larger donation campaigns also exist. In 2004 the [[Mozilla Foundation]] carried out a fundraising campaign to support the launch of the [[Firefox]] 1.0 [[web browser]]. It placed a two-page ad in the December 16 edition of ''[[The New York Times]]'' listing the names of the thousands who had donated.&lt;ref name="Mozilla Foundation"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www-archive.mozilla.org/press/mozilla-2004-12-15.html |title=Mozilla Foundation Places Two-Page Advocacy Ad in ''The New York Times'' |accessdate=June 15, 2010 |author=Mozilla Foundation |date=December 15, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/New-York-Times-runs-Firefox-ad/2100-1032_3-5493774.html|title=New York Times runs Firefox ad|date=2004-12-16 |accessdate=2013-08-12|first=Ingrid |last=Marson |quote=Fans of the Mozilla Foundation's Firefox browser who funded an advertisement in The New York Times will finally get to see their names in print on Thursday.|publisher=[[cnet.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bounty driven development ===
{{main|Open-source bounty}}
The users of a particular software artifact may come together and pool money into an [[open-source bounty]] for the implementation of a desired feature or functionality. Offering [[bounty (reward)|bounties]] as funding has existed for some time. For instance, [[Bountysource]] is a web platform which has offered this funding model for open source software since 2003.

Another bounty source is companies or foundations that set up bounty programs for implemented features or bugfixes in open-source software relevant to them. For instance, [[Mozilla Foundation|Mozilla]] has been paying and funding freelance open-source programmers for [[security bug]] hunting and fixing since 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Mozilla to pay bounty on bugs|url=http://www.securityfocus.com/news/9255|author=Leyden, John|publisher=[[The Register]] |date=2004-08-03 |accessdate=2013-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.cnet.com/2100-7350_3-5802411.html |title=Offering a bounty for security bugs |last=Evers |first=Joris |date=July 25, 2005 |website=[[CNET]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=12 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://blog.mozilla.org/press/2004/08/mozilla-foundation-announces-security-bug-bounty-program/ |title=Mozilla Foundation Announces Security Bug Bounty Program |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=August 2, 2004 |website=[[Mozilla Foundation]] |location=[[Mountain View, California]] |accessdate=2013-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pre-order/crowdfunding/reverse-bounty model ===
A newer funding opportunity for open-source software projects is [[crowdfunding]], which shares similarities with the [[pre-order]] or [[Praenumeration]] business model, as well as the reverse bounty model, typically organized over web platforms like [[Kickstarter]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.networkworld.com/community/blog/open-source-gets-its-own-crowd-funding-site-bounties-included |title=Open source gets its own crowd-funding site, with bounties included - Bountysource is the crowd-funding site the open source community has been waiting for. |first=Bryan |last=Lunduke |date=2013-08-07 |accessdate=2013-08-10 |quote=Many open source projects (from phones to programming tools) have taken to crowd-funding sites (such as Kickstarter and indiegogo) in order to raise the cash needed for large-scale development. And, in some cases, this has worked out quite well.|publisher=networkworld.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Indiegogo]],&lt;ref name="mesacrowdfunding"/&gt; or [[Bountysource]]&lt;ref name="yahoofinance"/&gt; (see also [[comparison of crowd funding services]]). One example is the successfully funded Indiegogo campaign in 2013 by Australian programmer Timothy Arceri, who offered to implement an [[OpenGL]] 4.3 extension for the [[Mesa (computer graphics)|Mesa]] library in two weeks for $2,500.&lt;ref name="mesacrowdfunding"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/help-improve-opengl-support-for-the-linux-graphics-drivers|title=Help improve OpenGL support for the Linux Graphics Drivers |first=Timothy |last=Arceri |date=2013-07-26 |accessdate=2013-08-11 |publisher=[[Indiegogo]] |quote=Helping fund the time for me to become a Mesa contributor and document the experience to make it easier for others to understand where to start with the Mesa codebase. Many people have brought up the idea of crowd sourcing open source driver development. This is a small scale experiment to see if it could actually work.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arceri delivered the OpenGL extension code which was promptly merged upstream, and he later continued his efforts on Mesa with successive crowdfunding campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=MTUxMTQ | title = Crowd-Funding Is Back For Another Mesa Extension | first = Michael | last = Larabel | author-link = Michael Larabel | website = [[Phoronix]] | date= 12 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, he found work as an employee in this domain with [[Collabora]] and in 2017 with [[Valve Corporation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url = https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=Arceri-Joined-Valve | title = Valve Has Another Linux Graphics Driver Developer Working On Open-Source AMD | website = [[Phoronix]] | first = Michael | last = Larabel | author-link = Michael Larabel | date = 14 February 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example is the June 2013 [[crowdfunding]] on [[Kickstarter]]&lt;ref name="CDDAcrowdfunding"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/568375735/cataclysm-dark-days-ahead-dedicated-developer/ |title=Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead - Dedicated Developer |work=[[Kickstarter]]|date=22 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indiestatik.com/2013/06/22/cataclysm-dda-kickstarter/ |title=Multipocalyptic Roguelike Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead Turns To Kickstarter |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140401001904/http://indiestatik.com/2013/06/22/cataclysm-dda-kickstarter/ |archivedate=2014-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[open source video game]] [[Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead]] which raised the payment of a full-time developer for 3.5 months. [[Patreon]] funding has also become an effective option, as the service gives the option to pay out each month to creators, many of whom intend to develop free and open-source software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.patreon.com/onpon4|title=Julie Marchant is creating libre video games|first=Julie|last=Marchant|website=[[Patreon]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Crowdsourcing ===

[[Crowdsourcing]] is a type of participative online activity in which an individual, an institution, a nonprofit organization, or company proposes to a group of individuals of varying knowledge, heterogeneity, and number, the voluntary undertaking of a task via a flexible open call. The undertaking of the task, of variable complexity and modularity, and in which the crowd should participate, bringing their work, money, knowledge and/or experience, always entails mutual benefit. The user will receive the satisfaction of a given type of need, be it economic, social recognition, self-esteem, or the development of individual skills, while the crowdsourcer will obtain and use to their advantage that which the user has brought to the venture, whose form will depend on the type of activity undertaken. Caveats in pursuing a Crowdsourcing strategy are to induce a substantial market model or incentive, and care has to be taken that the whole thing doesn‘t end up in an open source anarchy of adware and spyware plagiates, with a lot of broken solutions, started by people who just wanted to try it out, then gave up early, and a few winners. Popular examples for Crowdsourcing are [[Linux]], [[Google android|Google Android]], the [[Pirate Party]] movement, and Wikipedia.

=== Advertising-supported software ===
In order to commercialize FOSS (free and open-source software), many companies (including [[Google]], [[Mozilla]], and [[Canonical Ltd|Canonical]]) have moved towards an [[economic model]] of [[advertising-supported software]]. For instance, the open-source application [[AdBlock Plus]] gets paid by Google for letting [[whitelist]]ed ''Acceptable Ads'' bypassing the browser ad remover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neowin.net/news/report-google-paying-adblock-plus-to-not-block-google039s-ads|title=Report: Google paying AdBlock Plus to not block Google's ads |first=John |last=Callaham |date=2013-06-06 |publisher=[[neowin]].com |accessdate=2013-08-13 |quote=Google is paying money to Eyeo, the company behind AdBlock Plus, so that its ads get through the browser ad remover.}}&lt;/ref&gt; As another example is [[SourceForge]], an open-source project service provider, has the revenue model of advertising banner sales on their website. In 2006, SourceForge reported quarterly takings of $6.5 million&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/sourceforge-quarterly-profit-surges-as-revenue-rises |title=Sourceforge quarterly profit surges as revenue rises|accessdate=2013-08-13 |date=2007-05-24 |publisher=marketwatch.com|quote=Software Corp., late Thursday reported third-quarter net earnings of $6.49 million, or 9 cents a share, up from $997,000, or 2 cents a share, during the year-ago period. Pro forma earnings from continuing operations were $2.1 million, or 3 cents a share, compared with $1.2 million, or 2 cents a share, last year. The Fremont, Calif.-based maker of computer servers and storage systems said revenue for the three months ended April 30 rose to $10.3 million from $7.9 million. Analysts, on average, had forecast a per-share profit of 2 cents on revenue of $12 million.|first=Katherine |last=Hunt}}&lt;/ref&gt; and $23 million in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://ir.corp.sourceforge.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=82629&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=1260642&amp;highlight=| title=SourceForge Reports Second Quarter Fiscal 2009 Financial Results| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150603170625/http://ir.corp.sourceforge.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=82629&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=1260642&amp;highlight=| archivedate=2015-06-03| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Selling of optional proprietary extensions ===
{{main|Open core}}
Some companies sell proprietary but optional extensions, modules, [[Plug-in (computing)|plugins]] or [[Browser extension|add-ons]] to an open-source software product. This can be a "license conform" approach with many open-source licenses if done technically sufficiently carefully. For instance, mixing proprietary code and open-source licensed code in [[Statically linked library|statically linked libraries]]&lt;ref name="lgp"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.linuxgamepublishing.com/2009/02/08/our-new-way-to-meet-the-lgpl/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220234542/http://blog.linuxgamepublishing.com/2009/02/08/our-new-way-to-meet-the-lgpl/|archivedate=2009-02-20 |title=Our new way to meet the LGPL |date=2009-02-08|accessdate=2011-03-09 |first=Eskild |last=Hustvedt |quote=You can use a special keyword $ORIGIN to say 'relative to the actual location of the executable'. Suddenly we found we could use -rpath $ORIGIN/lib and it worked. The game was loading the correct libraries, and so was stable and portable, but was also now completely in the spirit of the LGPL as well as the letter!}}&lt;/ref&gt; or compiling all source code together in a software product might violate open-source licenses, while keeping them separated by interfaces and [[Dynamic-link library|dynamic-link libraries]] might often adhere to license conform.

This approach is a variant of the [[freemium]] business model. The proprietary software may be intended to let customers get more value out of their data, infrastructure, or platform, e.g., operate their infrastructure/platform more effectively and efficiently, manage it better, or secure it better. Examples include the [[Linux Technology Center|IBM proprietary Linux software]], where IBM contributes to the Linux open-source ecosystem, but it builds and delivers (to IBM’s paying customers) [[database software]], [[middleware]], and other software that runs on top of the open-source core. Other examples of proprietary products built on open-source software include [[Red Hat Enterprise Linux]] and [[Cloudera]]'s [[Apache Hadoop]]-based software. Some companies appear to re-invest a portion of their financial profits from the sale of proprietary software back into the open source infrastructure.&lt;ref name=OlsonStanford/&gt;

Some companies, such as [[Digium]], sell proprietary but optional [[digital electronics]] hardware controlled by an open-source software product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media | url = http://ecorner.stanford.edu/podcasts/1565/Twenty-Years-of-Experience-in-Developing-Software-in-Silicon-Valley | title = Twenty Years of Experience in Developing Software in Silicon Valley | first = Kim | last = Polese | author-link = Kim Polese | website = Stanford eCorner | location = Stanford University | date = 9 November 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Selling of required proprietary parts of a software product ===
A variant of the approach above is the keeping of required data content (for instance a [[video game]]'s audio, graphic, and other art assets) of a software product proprietary while making the software's source code open-source. While this approach is completely legitimate and compatible with most open-source licenses, customers have to buy the content to have a complete and working software product.&lt;ref name="doom3GPL"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://github.com/TTimo/doom3.gpl|quote=Doom 3 GPL source release [...] This source release does not contain any game data, the game data is still covered by the original EULA and must be obeyed as usual.|title= TTimo/doom3.gpl |publisher=[[GitHub]] |accessdate=2013-08-10 |date=2012-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Restrictive licenses can then be applied on the content, which prevents the redistribution or re-selling of the complete software product. Examples for open-source developed software are [[Kot-in-Action Creative Artel]] video game ''Steel Storm'', engine [[GPLv2]] licensed while the artwork is [[CC-BY-NC-SA]] 3.0 licensed,&lt;ref name="steelstorm1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.steel-storm.com/ss_license.html|title=STEEL STORM EPISODE 1 LIMITED USER SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENT |quote=For the purpose of this Agreement, the Art Assets include pk3 archive inside of 'steelstorm/gamedata/' folder that contain two-dimensional and three-dimensional works of graphic art, photographs, prints and art reproductions, maps, charts, diagrams, models, and technical drawings, sound effects and musical arrangements, documentation and tutorial videos, and are licensed under Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported license. The Engine, which includes Windows, Linux and Mac binaries, and the Engine's source code, are licensed under GNU GPL v2 license.|publisher=steel-storm.com |accessdate=2013-08-10|date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Frogatto &amp; Friends]]'' with an own developed open-source  engine&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://github.com/anura-engine/anura/blob/trunk/LICENSE |date=2015-04-26 |accessdate=2015-10-10 |title=LICENCE |website=anura-engine - GitHub |first=Kristina|last=Simpson}}&lt;/ref&gt; and commercialization via the copyrighted game assets&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://github.com/frogatto/frogatto/blob/master/LICENSE |title = License | quote = CC-BY 3.0 LICENSE [...] assets under copyright | website = [[GitHub]] | author = frogatto}}&lt;/ref&gt; for [[iPhone]], [[BlackBerry]] and [[MacOS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://freegamer.blogspot.de/2011/04/humble-indie-bundles-source-releases.html | title = Humble Indie Bundle's Source Releases | first = Iwan | last = Gabovitch | quote = Another game which is commercial (on iDevices) and has FOSS code and closed art [...] is Frogatto. | date = 22 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other examples are ''[[Arx Fatalis]]'' (by [[Arkane Studios]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bethblog.com/index.php/2011/01/14/arx-fatalis-source-code-patch-released/ |title=Arx Fatalis source code, patch released! |author=Nick|date=2011-01-14 |accessdate=2011-08-10 |publisher=bethblog.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Catacomb 3-D]]'' (by [[Flat Rock Software]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=MTcxMjM | title = id Software's Softdisk Open-Sources Some Really Old Games | first = Michael | last = Larabel | date = 6 June 2014 | accessdate = 6 June 2014 | publisher = [[Phoronix]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; with source code opened to the public delayed after release, while copyrighted assets and binaries are still sold on [[gog.com]] as [[digital distribution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | url = http://www.develop-online.net/press-releases/straight-out-of-the-dungeon-arx-fatalis-invades-gog-com/0129540 | title = Straight out of the Dungeon, Arx Fatalis invades GOG.com | first = Tom | last = Ohle | location = [[Warsaw]], [[Poland]] | date = 4 December 2008 | website = Develop-Online.net }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Doing so conforms with the FSF and Richard Stallman, who stated that for art or entertainment the software freedoms are not required or important.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stallman.org/articles/online-education.html|title= On-line education is using a flawed Creative Commons license |first=Richard |last=Stallman |publisher=stallman.org |quote=In my view, nonfree licenses that permit sharing are ok for works of art/entertainment, or that present some party's viewpoint (such as this article itself). Those works aren't meant for doing a practical job, so the argument about the users' control does not apply. Thus, I do not object if they are published with the CC-BY-NC-ND license, which allows only noncommercial redistribution of exact copies. |accessdate=2013-08-10|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The similar [[product bundling]] of an open-source software product with hardware which prevents users from running modified versions of the software is called [[tivoization]] and is legal with most open-source licenses except [[GPLv3]], which explicitly prohibits this use-case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fsfeurope.org/projects/gplv3/barcelona-moglen-transcript.en.html#drm|title=Eben Moglen, speaking about GPLv3 in Barcelona}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Selling of proprietary update systems ===
Another variant of the approach above, mainly use for data-intensive, data-centric software programs, is the keeping of all versions of the software under a free and open-source software license, but refraining from providing [[Software update|update]] scripts from a ''n'' to an ''n''+1 version. Users can still deploy and run the open source software. However, any update to the next version requires either exporting the data, reinstalling the new version, then reimporting the data to the new version, or subscribing to the proprietary update system, or studying the two versions and recreating the scripts from scratch.

This practice does not conform with the [[Software Freedom|free software principles]] as espoused by the FSF. Richard Stallman condemns this practice and names it "diachronically trapped software".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/when-free-depends-on-nonfree.en.html|title=gnu.org|website=www.gnu.org|language=en|access-date=2017-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Re-licensing under a proprietary license ===
If a software product uses only own software and open-source software under a [[permissive free software licence]], a company can re-license the resulting software product under a proprietary license and sell the product without the source code or [[The Free Software Definition|software freedoms]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/articles/bsdl-gpl/article.html |title=Why you should use a BSD style license for your Open Source Project - GPL Advantages and Disadvantages|quote=In contrast to the GPL, which is designed to prevent the proprietary commercialization of Open Source code, the BSD license places minimal restrictions on future behavior. This allows BSD code to remain Open Source or become integrated into commercial solutions, as a project's or company's needs change. In other words, the BSD license does not become a legal time-bomb at any point in the development process. In addition, since the BSD license does not come with the legal complexity of the GPL or LGPL licenses, it allows developers and companies to spend their time creating and promoting good code rather than worrying if that code violates licensing. |publisher=[[FreeBSD]] |first=Bruce|last=Montague |date=2013-11-13 |accessdate=2015-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, [[Apple Inc.]] is an avid user of this approach by using source code and software from open-source projects. For example, the [[Berkeley Software Distribution|BSD Unix]] [[operating system]] kernel (under the [[BSD license]]) was used in [[Apple Inc.|Apple's]] [[Macintosh|Mac]] PCs that were sold as proprietary products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://radar.oreilly.com/2011/08/how-free-software-contributed.html|title=How Free Software Contributed to the Success of Steve Jobs and Apple|first=Andy|last=Oram |date=2011-08-26|publisher=radar.oreilly.com |accessdate=2013-08-10 |quote=the BSD license allowed Apple to keep its changes proprietary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Obfuscation of source code ===
An approach to allow commercialization under some open-source licenses while still protecting crucial business secrets, [[intellectual property]] and technical know-how is [[Obfuscation (software)|obfuscation]] of source code. This approach was used in several cases, for instance by [[Nvidia]] in their open-source [[graphic card]] device drivers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&amp;item=nvidia_kills_nv&amp;num=1 | title = NVIDIA Drops Their Open-Source Driver, Refers Users To VESA Driver | website = [[Phoronix]] | quote = The xf86-video-nv driver has been around that provides very basic 2D acceleration and a crippled set of features besides that (no proper RandR 1.2/1.3, KMS, power management, etc.) while the code has also been obfuscated to try to protect their intellectual property. | first = Michael | last = Larabel | author-link = Michael Larabel | date = 26 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This practice is used to get the open-source-friendly propaganda without bearing the inconveniences. There has been debate in the free-software/open-source community on whether it is illegal to skirt [[copyleft]] software licenses by releasing source code in obfuscated form, such as in cases in which the author is less willing to make the source code available. The general consensus was that while unethical, it was not considered a violation.

The [[Free Software Foundation]] is against this practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | quote = Obfuscated “source code” is not real source code and does not count as source code. | url = https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html | title = What is free software? | website = [[Free Software Foundation]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[GNU General Public License]] since version 2 has defined "source code" as "the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it." This is intended to prevent the release of obfuscated source code.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://lwn.net/Articles/431651/|title=Reasoning behind the "preferred form" language in the GPL|date=2011-03-07|accessdate=2013-08-19|publisher=lwn.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Delayed open-sourcing ===
Some companies provide the latest version available only to paying customers. A vendor [[Fork (software development)|forks]] a non-[[copyleft]] software project then adds closed-source additions to it and sells the resulting software. After a fixed time period the [[Patch (computing)|patch]]es are released back [[Upstream (software development)|upstream]] under the same license as the rest of the codebase. This business model is called version lagging or time delaying.&lt;ref name=OlsonStanford&gt;{{cite av media | first = Mike | last = Olson | url = http://ecorner.stanford.edu/videos/3223/Opportunities-Abound-in-the-Big-Data-Space-Entire-Talk | title = Opportunities Abound in the Big Data Space | location = Stanford University | website = Stanford eCorner | date = 13 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&amp;item=sprewell_licensing&amp;num=1 | website = [[Phoronix]] | title = Towards A Real Business Model For Open-Source Software | author = Sprewell | date = 29 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For instance, 2016 the [[MariaDB Corporation]] created for business compatible "delayed open-sourcing" the [[source-available]] ''Business source license'' (BSL) which automatically [[Relicensing|relicenses]] after three years to the [[Free and open-source software|FOSS]] GPL.&lt;ref name="widenius-maxscale"&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/08/24/monty_interview/ | title= MySQL daddy Widenius: Open-source religion won't feed MariaDB | work = [[The Register]] | date = 24 August 2016 | first = Alexander J | last = Martin }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.infoworld.com/article/3109213/open-source-tools/open-source-uproar-as-mariadb-goes-commercial.html | title = Uproar: MariaDB Corp. veers away from open source | website = [[InfoWorld]] | first = Simon | last = Phipps | author-link = Simon Phipps (programmer) | date = 19 August 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach guarantees licensees that they have source code access (e.g. for [[code audit]]s), are not locked into a [[closed platform]], or suffer from [[planned obsolescence]], while for the software developer a time-limited exclusive commercialization is possible.&lt;ref name="widenius-maxscale"/&gt; In 2017 followed version 1.1, revised with feedback also from [[Bruce Perens]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://perens.com/2017/02/14/bsl-1-1/ sl-1-1] on perens.com (2017-02-14)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://mariadb.com/resources/blog/releasing-bsl-11 releasing-bsl-11] on mariadb.com by Kaj Arnö (2017)&lt;/ref&gt;

However, this approach works only with own software or [[Permissive free software licence|permissive licensed]] code parts, as there is no copyleft FOSS license available which allows the time delayed opening of the source code after distributing or selling of a software product.

=== Open sourcing on end-of-life===

An extreme variant of "delayed open-sourcing" is a business practice popularized by [[id Software]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.h-online.com/open/news/item/id-Software-releases-Doom-3-source-code-1383572.html | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131208041324/http://www.h-online.com/open/news/item/id-Software-releases-Doom-3-source-code-1383572.html | archive-date = 8 December 2013 | title = id Software releases Doom 3 source code | website = The H Open | date = 23 November 2011 | dead-url = no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.pocketgamer.co.uk/r/iPhone/Wolfenstein+3D+Classic/news.asp?c=12324 | title = id Software makes iPhone Wolfenstein open source | first = Spanner | last = Spencer | date = 24 March 2009 | website = PocketGamer.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[3D Realms]],&lt;ref name="shadowwarriorOSS"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://legacy.3drealms.com/news/2005/04/shadow_warrior_12.html | title = Shadow Warrior Source Code Released | publisher = [[3D Realms]] | date = 1 April 2005 | first = Joe | last = Siegler }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="several3DRealmsgamesOSS"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://legacy.3drealms.com/games.html | title = Games | quote = Selected games have had their source code released by us.

The motivation of companies following this practice of releasing the source code when a software reaches the commercial [[End-of-life (product)|end-of-life]], is to prevent that their software becomes unsupported [[Abandonware]] or even get lost due to [[digital obsolescence]].&lt;ref name="videogaem preservation"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/6271/where_games_go_to_sleep_the_game_.php?print=1 |title=Where Games Go To Sleep: The Game Preservation Crisis, Part 1 |first=John |last=Andersen |quote=The existence of decaying technology, disorganization, and poor storage could in theory put a video game to sleep permanently -- never to be played again.

Certain game titles could not see a re-release due to various issues.

== FOSS and economy ==
{{main|Open-source economics}}
According to [[Yochai Benkler]], the Berkman Professor for Entrepreneurial Legal Studies at [[Harvard Law School]], free software is the most visible part of a new economy of [[commons-based peer production]] of information, knowledge, and culture. As examples, he cites a variety of FOSS projects, including both free software and open source.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Benkler|first=Yochai|title=Freedom in the Commons: Towards a Political Economy of Information|journal=Duke Law Journal |date=April 2003|volume=52|issue=6|url=http://www.law.duke.edu/shell/cite.pl?52+Duke+L.+J.+1245+pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This new economy is already under development. In order to commercialize FOSS, many companies, [[Google]] being the most successful, are moving towards an [[economic model]] of [[advertising-supported software]]. In such a model, the only way to increase revenue is to make the advertising more valuable. [[Facebook]] has recently come under fire for using novel user tracking methods to accomplish this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/facebook-tracking-prompts-calls-for-ftc-investigation/2011/09/29/gIQAVdsP8K_story.html |work=[[The Washington Post]]|accessdate=23 October 2011|first=Dina|last=ElBoghdady |author2=Hayley Tsukayama |title=Facebook tracking prompts calls for FTC investigation |date=2011-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This new economy is not without alternatives. Apple's [[App Store (iOS)|App Stores]] have proven very popular with both users and developers. The Free Software Foundation considers Apple's App Stores to be [[License compatibility|incompatible]] with its GPL and complained that Apple was infringing on the GPL with its [[iTunes]] terms of use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2011/01/vlc-for-ios-vanishes-2-months-after-eruption-of-gpl-dispute/ | title = VLC for iOS vanishes 2 months after eruption of GPL dispute | work = [[Ars Technica]] | first = Jacqui | last = Cheng | date = 10 January 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than change those terms to comply with the GPL, Apple removed the GPL-licensed products from its App Stores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Vaughan-Nichols |first=Steven |title=No GPL Apps for Apple's App Store |url=http://www.zdnet.com/blog/open-source/no-gpl-apps-for-apples-app-store/8046|accessdate=23 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors of [[VLC media player|VLC]], one of the GPL-licensed programs at the center of those complaints, recently began the process to switch from the GPL to the [[LGPL]] and [[Mozilla Public License|MPL]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Changing the VLC engine license to LGPL|url=http://www.videolan.org/press/lgpl.html |accessdate=23 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2013/07/vlc-media-player-returns-to-the-ios-app-store-after-30-month-hiatus/ | title = VLC media player returns to the iOS App Store after 30-month hiatus | date = 18 July 2013 | first = Casey | last = Johnston | work = [[Ars Technica]] | access-date = 10 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the Internet runs on open-source software tools and utilities such as [[Linux]], [[Apache HTTP Server|Apache]], [[MySQL]], and [[PHP]], known as the [[LAMP (software bundle)|LAMP stack]] for web servers.{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}} Using open source appeals to software developers for three main reasons: low or no cost, access to [[source code]] they can tailor themselves, and a shared community that ensures a generally robust code base, with quick fixes for new issues.

Despite doing much business in proprietary software, some companies like [[Oracle Corporation]] and [[IBM]] participated in developing [[free and open-source software]] to deter from [[monopoly|monopolies]] and take a portion of [[market share]] for themselves.  See [[Commercial open-source applications]] for the list of current commercial open-source offerings. [[Netscape]]'s actions were an example of this, and thus [[Mozilla Firefox]] has become more popular, getting market share from [[Internet Explorer]].

'''Lobegott Friedrich Constantin (von) Tischendorf''' (18 January 1815 &amp;ndash; 7 December 1874) was a world-leading [[biblical]] scholar in his time. In 1844{{citation needed|reason=should be 1859, see text below|date=February 2017}} he discovered the world's oldest and most complete Bible dating from 325{{citation needed|reason=the exact date is unknown, 330 to 350 would be acceptable|date=February 2017}}, with the complete New Testament not discovered before. This Bible is called [[Codex Sinaiticus]], after the [[Saint Catherine's Monastery|St. Catherine's Monastery]] at [[Mount Sinai|Mt. Sinai]], where Tischendorf discovered it.  The codex can be seen either in the [[British Library]] in London, or as a digitalised version on the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Codex Sinaitius|url=http://www.codexsinaiticus.net/en/|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140225213856/http://www.codexsinaiticus.net/en/|archivedate=2014-02-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Textual disputes are resolved when the two oldest books, Codex Sinaiticus (source aleph, 4th AD) and [[Codex Vaticanus]] (source beta, 4th  AD), agree with each other. Tischendorf was made an Honorary Doctor by Oxford University on 16 March 1865, and an Honorary Doctor by Cambridge University on 9 March 1865 following this find of the century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Böttrich|first1=Christfried|title=Bibliographie Konstantin von Tischendorf (1815-1874)|date=1999|publisher=Universitätsverlag, Leipzig}}&lt;/ref&gt; While a student gaining his academic degree in the 1840s, he earned international recognition when he deciphered the ''[[Codex Ephraemi Rescriptus]]'', a 5th-century [[Greek language|Greek]] [[biblical manuscript|manuscript]] of the [[New Testament]]. 
'''

== The Codex Sinaiticus ==

The ''[[Codex Sinaiticus]]'' contains a 4th-century manuscript of New Testament texts. Two other Bibles of similar age exist, though they are less complete: [[Codex Vaticanus]] in the [[Vatican Library]] and  [[Codex Alexandrinus]], currently owned by the British Library. The Codex Sinaiticus is deemed by some{{by whom|date=July 2017}} to be the most authoritative surviving New Testament manuscript, as no older document is as complete as the Codex.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.csntm.org/manuscript/View/GA_01&lt;/ref&gt; The content of the "oldest Bible of the world"{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} (as it is more complete than [[Codex Alexandrinus]] or [[Codex Vaticanus]]) has been digitised.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20140225213856/http://www.codexsinaiticus.net/en/ Codex Sinaiticus. Experience the oldest Bible]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tischendorf's motivation ==

Throughout his life Tischendorf sought old biblical manuscripts, as he saw it as his task to give theology a Greek New Testament which was based on the oldest possible scriptures. He intended to be as close as possible to the original sources. Tischendorf's greatest discovery was in the monastery of Saint Catherine on the [[Sinai Peninsula]], which he visited in May 1844, and again in 1853 and 1859 (as Russian envoy).

In 1862 Tischendorf published the text of the Codex Sinaiticus for the 1000th Anniversary of the Russian Monarchy in both an illustrious four-volume facsimile edition and in a less costly text edition, to enable all scholars to have access to the Codex.

Tischendorf pursued a constant course of editorial labours, mainly on the New Testament, until he was broken down by overwork in 1873. His motive, as explained in a publication on Tischendorf's Letter by Prof. Christfried Boettrich (Leibzig University, Prof. of Theology), was to prove scientifically that the words of the Bible were trustfully transmitted over centuries.&lt;ref&gt;[[:de:Christfried Böttrich]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
[[File:Codex Sinaiticus Petropolitanus (title).JPG|thumb|right|220px|Title page from facsimile edition of codex Sinaiticus]]

Tischendorf was born in [[Lengenfeld]], [[Kingdom of Saxony|Saxony]], near [[Plauen]], the son of a physician. Beginning in 1834, he spent his scholarly career at the [[University of Leipzig]] where he was mainly influenced by [[Georg Benedikt Winer|JGB Winer]], and he began to take special interest in [[New Testament]] [[textual criticism|criticism]]. Winer's influence gave him the desire to use the oldest manuscripts in order to compile the text of the New Testament as close to the original as possible.&lt;ref&gt;Panning, Armin J. [http://www.wlsessays.net/files/PanningTischendorf.pdf Home Tischendorf and the History of the Greek New Testament Text] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101130095538/http://wlsessays.net/files/PanningTischendorf.pdf |date=2010-11-30 }}, Milwaukee: Wisconsin Lutheran Quarterly, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1838 he took the degree of Doctor of Philosophy, then became master at a school near [[Leipzig]].

After a journey through southern Germany and [[Switzerland]], and a visit to [[Strassburg]], he returned to Leipzig, and set to work upon a critical study of the New Testament text. In 1840 he qualified as university lecturer in theology with a dissertation on the [[recension]]s of the New Testament text — the main part of which reappeared the following year in the prolegomena to his first edition of the Greek New Testament. His critical apparatus included variant readings from earlier scholars — [[Elsevier]], [[Georg Christian Knapp]], [[Johann Martin Augustin Scholz]], and as recent as [[Karl Lachmann]] — whereby his researches were emboldened to depart from the [[received text]] as used in churches.

These early textual studies convinced him of the absolute necessity of new and more exact [[collation]]s of manuscripts. From October 1840 until January 1843 he was in Paris, busy with the treasures of the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France|Bibliothèque Nationale]], eking out his scanty means by making collations for other scholars, and producing for the publisher, [[Firmin Didot]], several editions of the Greek New Testament — one of them exhibiting the form of the text corresponding most closely to the [[Vulgate]]. His second edition retracted the more precarious readings of the first, and included a statement of critical principles that is a landmark for evolving critical studies of Biblical texts.&lt;ref name = "Bible Researcher"&gt;[http://www.bible-researcher.com/bib-t.html Bible Researcher].&lt;/ref&gt;

A great triumph of these laborious months was the decipherment of the [[palimpsest]] ''[[Codex Ephraemi Rescriptus|Codex Ephraemi Syri Rescriptus]]'', of which the New Testament part was printed before he left Paris, and the [[Old Testament]] in 1845. His success in dealing with a manuscript that, having been over-written with other works of [[Ephrem the Syrian]], had been mostly illegible to earlier collators, made him more well known, and gained support for more extended critical expeditions. He now became ''professor extraordinarius'' at Leipzig, and where he was married in 1845. He also began to publish ''Reise in den Orient'', an account of his travels in the east (in 2 vols., 1845–46, translated as ''Travels in the East'' in 1847). Even though he was an expert in reading the text of a palimpsest (this is a document where the original writing has been removed and new writing added), he was not able to identify the value or meaning of the "Archimedes Palimpsest", which he donated to Cambridge.

From Paris, he had paid short visits to the [[Netherlands]] (1841) and England (1842). In 1843 he visited Italy, and after a stay of thirteen months, went on to [[Egypt]], [[Sinai peninsula|Sinai]], and the [[Levant]], returning via [[Vienna]] and [[Munich]].

=== Discovery of the Codex Sinaiticus Bible manuscripts ===

In 1844 Tischendorf travelled the first time to [[Saint Catherine's Monastery]] at the foot of [[Mount Sinai]] in Egypt, where he found the oldest complete known Bible. Of the many pages which were contained in an old wicker basket (the kind that the monastery hauled in its visitors as customary in unsafe territories) he was given 43 pages as a present. He donated those 43 pages to King [[Frederick Augustus II of Saxony]] (reigned 1836-1854), to honour him and to recognise his patronage as the funder of Tischenforf's journey. (Tischendorf held a position as Theological Professor at [[Leipzig University]], also under the patronage of Frederick Augustus II.) Leipzig University put 2 of the leaves on display in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tischendorf- Search for the oldest Bible of the world|url= http://www.ub.uni-leipzig.de/tischendorf/home.html|publisher=University Leipzig}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1= Kholodiuk|first1= Anatoly|title= Tischendorf in search of the oldest Bible of the world - Leibzig Exhibition 2011|url=http://www.pravoslavie.ru/english/44856.htm|website=pravoslavie.ru/english/44856.htm|publisher=Pravoslavie|accessdate=26 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Tischendorf reported in his 1865 book ''Wann Wurden Unsere Evangelen Verfasst'', translated to English in 1866 as  ''When Were Our Gospels Written'' in the section "The Discovery of the Sinaitic Manuscript" that he found, in a trash basket, forty-three sheets of parchment of an ancient copy of the Greek Old Testament, reporting that the monks were using the trash to start fires. And Tischendorf, horrified, asked if he could have them. He deposited them at the [[Leipzig University Library|University of Leipzig]], under the title of the ''[[Codex Sinaiticus|Codex Friderico-Augustanus]]'', a name given in honour of his patron, [[Frederick Augustus II of Saxony]], king of Saxony. The fragments were published in 1846, although Tischendorf kept the place of discovery a secret.

Many have expressed skepticism at the historical accuracy of this report of saving a 1500-year-old parchment from the flames. [[J. Rendel Harris]] referred to the story as a ''myth''.&lt;ref&gt;"What a run this myth has had, of a convent stove fed with parchment! unhappily for the statement, the basket is still there, a regular part of the library furniture, and not a suggestion can be found that it was ever used to carry vellum books to the kitchen for burning. But any story will be believed against the Sinaitic monks, even that they made fires with parchment." [https://books.google.com/books?id=u6gQAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA140 Dr Gregory and the Canon and Text of the New Testament, ''Expositor'', 1908, p. 140]&lt;/ref&gt; The Tischendorf Lesebuch (see References) quotes that the Librarian Kyrillos mentioned to Tischendorf that the contents of the basket had already twice been submitted to the fire. The contents of the baskets were damaged scriptures, the third filling apparently, so cited by Tischendorf himself.[see Tischendorf Lesebuch, Tischendorf's own account]. 
In 1853 Tischendorf made a second trip to the Syrian monastery but made no new discoveries. He returned a third time in January 1859 under the patronage of Tsar [[Alexander II of Russia]] with the active aid of the Russian government to find more of the ''Codex Frederico-Augustanus'' or similar ancient Biblical texts. On February 4, the last day of his visit, he was shown a text which he recognized as significant — the ''[[Codex Sinaiticus]]'' — a Greek manuscript of the complete New Testament and parts of the Old Testament dating to the 4th century.

Tischendorf persuaded the monks to present the manuscript to [[Tsar]] [[Alexander II of Russia]], at the cost of the Tsar it was published in 1862 (in four folio volumes). Those{{who|date=November 2014}} ignorant of the details of his discovery of the ''Codex Sinaiticus'' accused Tischendorf of buying manuscripts from ignorant [[monastery]] librarians at low prices. Indeed, he was never rich, but he staunchly defended the rights of the monks at Saint Catherine's Monastery when he persuaded them eventually to send the manuscript to the Tsar. This took approximately 10 years because the abbot of St Catherines had to be re-elected and confirmed in office in Cairo and in Jerusalem, and during those 10 years no one in the monastery had the authority to hand over any documents. However the documents were handed over in due course following a signed and sealed letter to the Tsar Alexander II (Schenkungsurkunde). Even so, the monks of Mt. Sinai still display a receipt-letter from Tischendorf promising to return the manuscript to them in the case that the donation can not be done. This token-letter had to be destroyed, following the late issue of a "Schenkungsurkunde". This donation act regulated the Codex exchange with the Tsar, against 9000 Rubels and Rumanian estate protection. The Tsar was seen as the protector of Greek-Orthodox Christians. Thought lost since the Russian revolution, the document (Schenkungsurkunde) has now resurfaced in St Petersburg 2003, and has also been long before commented upon by other scholars like Kurt Aland. The monastery has disputed the existence of the gift certificate (Schenkungsurkunde) since the British Library was named as the new owner of the Codex. Now following the late find of the gift certificate by the [[National Library of Russia|National Russian Library]] the existence cannot be disputed in earnest.&lt;ref name="nlr.ru"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nlr.ru/eng/exib/CodexSinaiticus/zah/|title=A.V. Zakharova. The History of the Acquisition of the Sinai Bible by the Russian Government in the Context of Recent Findings in Russian Archives|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1869 the Tsar awarded Tischendorf the style of "von" Tischendorf as a Russian noble. 327 facsimile editions of the Codex were printed in Leipzig for the Tsar (instead of a salary for the three-year work of Tischendorf the Tsar gave him 100 copies for reselling) in order to celebrate the 1000th anniversary of the traditional foundation of the [[Kievan Rus'|Rus']] state in 862 with the publication of this most amazing find. Supporting the production of the facsimile, all made with special print characters for each of the 4 scribes of the Codex Sinaiticus, was shift work and contributed to Tischendorf's early demise due to exhausting work for months also during nights. Thus the Codex found its way to the Imperial Library at St. Petersburg.&lt;ref name="nlr.ru"/&gt;

When the 4-volume luxury edition of the Sinai Bible was completed in 1862, C. Tischendorf presented the original ancient manuscript to Emperor Alexander II. Meanwhile, the question of transferring the manuscript to the full possession of the Russian Sovereign remained unresolved for some years. In 1869, the new Archbishop of Sinai, Callistratus, and the monastic community, signed the official certificate presenting the manuscript to the Tsar. The Russian Government, in turn, bestowed the Monastery with 9000 rubles and decorated the Archbishop and some of the brethren with orders. In 1933 the Soviet Government sold the Codex Sinaiticus for 100,000 pounds to the [[British Museum]] in London, England. The official certificate with signatures in Russian/ French/ Greek sections has been refound in St Petersburg.&lt;ref name="nlr.ru"/&gt;

=== Novum Testamentum Graece - publication with 21 editions ===

In the winter of 1849 the first edition of his great work now titled ''Novum Testamentum Graece. Ad antiquos testes recensuit. Apparatum criticum multis modis'' appeared (translated as ''Greek New Testament. The ancient witnesses reviewed. Preparations critical in many ways''), containing [[wiktionary:canon|canon]]s of criticism, adding examples of their application that are applicable to students today:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Basic rule: "The text is only to be sought from ancient evidence, and especially from Greek manuscripts, but without neglecting the testimonies of versions and [[Fathers of the Church|fathers]]."
#"A reading altogether peculiar to one or another ancient document is suspicious; as also is any, even if supported by a class of documents, which seems to evince that it has originated in the revision of a learned man."
#"Readings, however well supported by evidence, are to be rejected, when it is manifest (or very probable) that they have proceeded from the errors of copyists."
#"In parallel passages, whether of the New or Old Testament, especially in the [[Synoptic Gospels]], which ancient copyists continually brought into increased accordance, those testimonies are preferable, in which precise accordance of such parallel passages is not found; unless, indeed, there are important reasons to the contrary."
#"In discrepant readings, that should be preferred which may have given occasion to the rest, or which appears to comprise the elements of the others."
#"Those readings must be maintained which accord with [[Koine Greek|New Testament Greek]], or with the particular style of each individual writer."&lt;ref name = "Bible Researcher" /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

These were partly the result of the tireless travels he had begun in 1839 in search of unread manuscripts of the New Testament, "to clear up in this way," he wrote, "the history of the sacred text, and to recover if possible the genuine [[Twelve apostles|apostolic]] text which is the foundation of our faith."

In 1850 appeared his edition of the ''[[Codex Amiatinus]]'' (in 1854 corrected)&lt;ref&gt;Constantinus Tischendorf, [https://books.google.com/books?hl=pl&amp;id=x0opAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=NOVUM_TESTAMENTUM_LATINE#v= ''Codex Amiatinus. Novum Testamentum Latine interpreter Hieronymo''], (Lipsiae 1854).&lt;/ref&gt; and of the [[Septuagint]] version of the Old Testament (7th ed., 1887); in 1852, amongst other works, his edition of the ''[[Codex Claromontanus]]''.

Meanwhile, also in 1859, he had been made ''professor ordinarius'' of theology and of Biblical [[paleography]], this latter professorship being specially created for him; and another book of travel, ''Aus dem heiligen Lande'', appeared in 1862. Tischendorf's Eastern journeys were rich enough in other discoveries to merit the highest praise.

Besides his fame as a scholar, he was a friend of both [[Robert Schumann]], with whom he corresponded, and [[Felix Mendelssohn]], who dedicated a song to him. His text critical colleague [[Samuel Prideaux Tregelles]] wrote warmly of their mutual interest in textual scholarship. His personal library, purchased after his death, eventually came to the [[University of Glasgow]],&lt;ref name = "Univ Glasgow"&gt;[http://special.lib.gla.ac.uk/collection/tischendorf.html Tischendorf] at the [[University of Glasgow]], Scotland.&lt;/ref&gt; where a commemorative exhibition of books from his library was held in 1974 and can be accessed by the public.

He died in [[Leipzig]].

==Works==
[[File:Codex Ephraemi Mt 26,52-69.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Matthew 26:52-69 in Tischendorf's facsimile edition (1843)]]
His ''magnum opus'' was the "Critical Edition of the New Testament."

The great edition, of which the text and apparatus appeared in 1869 and 1872, was called by himself ''editio viii''; but this number is raised to twenty or twenty-one, if mere reprints from [[stereotype]] plates and the minor editions of his great critical texts are included; posthumous prints bring the total to forty-one. Four main recensions of Tischendorf's text may be distinguished, dating respectively from his editions of 1841, 1849, 1859 (ed. vii), and 1869–72 (ed. viii). The edition of 1849 may be regarded as historically the most important, from the mass of new critical material it used; that of 1859 is distinguished from Tischendorf's other editions by coming nearer to the received text; in the eighth edition, the testimony of the Sinaitic manuscript received great (probably too great) weight. The readings of the [[Vatican City|Vatican]] manuscript were given with more exactness and certainty than had been possible in the earlier editions, and the editor had also the advantage of using the published labours of his colleague and friend [[Samuel Prideaux Tregelles]].

Of relatively lesser importance was Tischendorf's work on the Greek Old Testament. His edition of the Roman text, with the variants of the Alexandrian manuscript, the ''[[Codex Ephraemi]]'', and the ''Friderico-Augustanus'', was of service when it appeared in 1850, but, being stereotyped, was not greatly improved in subsequent issues. Its imperfections, even within the limited field it covers, may be judged by the aid of [[Eberhard Nestle]]'s appendix to the 6th issue (1880).

Besides this may be mentioned editions of the [[New Testament apocrypha]], ''De Evangeliorum apocryphorum origine et usu'' (1851); ''Acta Apostolorum apocrypha'' (1851); ''Evangelia apocrypha'' (1853; 2nd ed., 1876); ''Apocalypses apocryphae'' (1866), and various minor writings, partly of an apologetic character, such as ''Wann wurden unsere Evangelien verfasst?'' (''When Were Our Gospels Written?''; 1865; 4th ed., 1866, digitized by Google and available for e-readers), ''Haben wir den echten Schrifttext der Evangelisten und Apostel?'' (1873), and ''Synopsis evangelica'' (7th ed., 1898).

'''''Contemplative Practices in Action: Spirituality, Meditation, and Health''''' is an interdisciplinary scholarly and scientific book. It examines the nature, function, and impact of [[meditation]] and other [[contemplative]] practices in several different religious traditions, both eastern and western,  including methods for incorporating contemplative practice into education, healthcare, and other human services. Edited by [[Thomas G. Plante]] and with a foreword by [[Huston Smith]], the book was published in the United States by Prager in 2010.  The book reviews evidences for health effects and includes 14 chapters divided among three major parts that focus on well-defined systems of practice, traditions as storehouses of many alternative forms of practice, and applications. It  has been reviewed in several professional journals, including ''[[PsycCRITIQUES]],''&lt;ref  name=bourg11/&gt; and the  ''Journal of Psychosocial Research'',.&lt;ref  name=gupta11/&gt;

==Topics covered==
The book contains 14 chapters written by scholars in the health and behavioral sciences and religious studies. Chapter titles and authors are listed in the table (''below, at right'').  Huston Smith's foreword describes the book as "ecumenically inclusive,"&lt;ref name=foreword&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=xnM4Y3uloVkC&amp;pg=PR8&amp;dq=%22serious+reader+unchanged%22+%099780313382567&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=mRT5TofqMcSfiQLr1Mi4Dg&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Foreword, Smith]&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|vii}} "in line" with Smith's own work.&lt;ref&gt;[[Huston Smith|Smith]]'s foreword also described the book as conveying a "persuasive conviction that the world's religions house inexhaustible resources for transforming and augmenting the human spirit" (p. vii), and as reflecting in several chapters the influence of [[Eknath Easwaran]], "a widely read and deeply respected teacher of meditation" (p. vii) who Smith met more than once.&lt;/ref&gt; The editor's introductory  chapter notes an increasing usage of meditative practices in health and human service practice, along with an increasing evidence base. It also acknowledges "a number of books" available on contemplative practices, but expresses concern that

"almost all [of the existing books] focus on one particular religious or spiritual tradition... Usually, they highlight the Eastern traditions and overlook the Western ones.".&lt;ref name=ch1&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=xnM4Y3uloVkC&amp;pg=PA2&amp;dq=%22almost+all+focus+on+one+particular+religious%22+%099780313382567&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Uxn5TvuKDcWkiQLg_7i8Dg&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Chapter 1, Plante, Raz, &amp; Oman]&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|2–3}}The remaining 13 chapters are divided into three major parts, beginning with 
Part One, which examines well-defined ''systems'' of contemplative practice, such as [[Mindfulness-based stress reduction]], [[Passage Meditation]], and [[Centering Prayer]]. Part Two describes contemplative practices in [[Judaism]], [[Islam]] (especially [[Sunni]] Islam), [[Yoga]], and [[Zen]], citing   a growing empirical research literature that links better health to research on Yoga, Zen, and Islamic practice. Part Three emphasizes applications.

In ''PsycCRITIQUES'', Edward F. Bourg stated that "in a time full of sensory and information overload, this is a welcome book."&lt;ref name=bourg11/&gt; While [[mindfulness]] "has entered the popular imagination as a curative factor" for health and well-being, this book shows that many other forms of contemplative practice are also being used successfully. The book's "twofold" premise is that both Eastern and Western traditions have a contemplative side, and "Doing, not saying, is what counts."&lt;ref name=bourg11/&gt;  He stated that although generally "the various chapters are very well integrated," the book "isn’t seamless," and some Part III chapters analyze practices, such as lamentation and fire-walking, that "are somewhat unusual... and... would appeal to very few of us."&lt;ref name=bourg11/&gt;

In ''Practical Matters'', Eric J. Kyle of the [[Claremont School of Theology]] wrote that the book was "a rich source of wisdom [on] the intersection of contemplative practices and... well-being. "&lt;ref name=kyle/&gt;{{rp|2}}   providing a "robust introduction to the breadth of contemplative approaches" from "various religious traditions.",&lt;ref name=kyle/&gt;{{rp|2}} although he wondered why there was no coverage of "native or aboriginal spiritualities."&lt;ref name=kyle/&gt;{{rp|2}}

In the ''Journal of Psychosocial Research'', Uma Gupta of [[Banaras Hindu University]] stated that a "strength of this book is its comprehensive identification of issues that are relevant to reducing hypertension in the present era that values speed, productivity and multitasking."&lt;ref name=gupta11/&gt;{{rp|167}} To Gupta, the book provides "excellent summaries of historical roots, current research, directions for future research and general applications of the contemplative practices from Eastern and Western religious and spiritual traditions."&lt;ref name=gupta11/&gt;{{rp|167}} She also described the book as "capable of transforming the life of the reader in making life more meaningful, purposeful and joyful."&lt;ref name=gupta11/&gt;{{rp|168}}

In ''Focus on Alternative and Complementary Therapies'', KJ Sherman wrote that she found the book "unsatisfying," since "for many traditions, the studies reported seemed to focus on religious or [[mental health]] outcomes, rather than physical health."&lt;ref name=sherman11/&gt;  She found "no logic to the traditions included,"&lt;ref name=sherman11/&gt; since they varied greatly in their level of empirical support, and would not recommend the book to healthcare providers or researchers. However, "the description of the practices themselves" may be useful to "healthcare providers whose patient populations may embrace contemplative practices in the context of multiple spiritual traditions," and to "religious scholars who want to understand how other practices may be similar to those of their tradition."&lt;ref name=sherman11/&gt;

In ''Psycho-Oncology'', JL Kristeller stated that "Even those familiar with selected contemplative traditions should find distinctive perspectives,"&lt;ref name=kristeller12/&gt;{{rp|e3}} and that the book "lays out a surprising richness of resources related to engaging spiritual well-being though a world heritage of contemplative practices."&lt;ref name=kristeller12/&gt;{{rp|e4}}

In ''Choice'', G. R. Thursby of the [[University of Florida]] wrote that the book was structured into "a meaningful whole that can serve as a tool kit for health care professionals and enable religious leaders to find positive points of contact,".&lt;ref name=thursby11/&gt; He stated that "among the best in the book"&lt;ref name=thursby11/&gt; are the three chapters about  Easwaran's Passage Meditation, Keating's Centering Prayer, and  Delbecq's  meditation  program for [[Silicon Valley]] leaders.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11059">In [[epistemology]], the '''correspondence theory of truth''' states that the [[truth]] or [[falsity]] of a [[proposition|statement]] is determined only by how it relates to the world and whether it accurately describes (i.e., corresponds with) that world.&lt;ref name="Hanna2004p21"&gt;Hanna and Harrison (2004), ch. 1, p. 21, quotation: "The assessment of truth and falsity is made possible by the existence of semantically mediated correlations between the members of some class of linguistic entities possessing assertoric force (in some versions of the Correspondence Theory propositions, in others sentences, or bodies of sentences), and the members of some class of extralinguistic entities: “states of affairs,” or “facts,” or bodies of truth-conditions, or of assertion-warranting circumstances."&lt;/ref&gt;

Correspondence theories claim that true beliefs and true statements correspond to the actual state of affairs. This type of theory attempts to posit a relationship between thoughts or statements on one hand, and things or facts on the other.

== History&lt;!--'Veritas est adaequatio rei et intellectus' and 'Adaequatio rei et intellectus' redirect here--&gt; ==
Correspondence theory is a traditional model which goes back at least to some of the [[ancient Greek philosophy|ancient Greek philosophers]] such as [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]].&lt;ref name=SEP&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/truth-correspondence/ The Correspondence Theory of Truth (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], Vol. 2, "Correspondence Theory of Truth", auth.: [[Arthur N. Prior]], Macmillan, 1969, pp. 223–4.&lt;/ref&gt; This class of theories holds that the truth or the falsity of a representation is determined solely by how it relates to a reality; that is, by whether it accurately describes that reality. As Aristotle claims in his ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'': "To say that that which is, is not, and that which is not, is, is a falsehood; therefore, to say that which is, is, and that which is not, is not, is true".&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'', 1011b26&lt;/ref&gt;

A classic example of correspondence theory is the statement by the [[medieval philosopher]] and theologian [[Thomas Aquinas]]: "'''Veritas est adaequatio rei et intellectus'''" ("Truth is the adequation of things and [[intellect]]"), which Aquinas attributed to the ninth century [[Neoplatonist]] [[Isaac Israeli ben Solomon|Isaac Israeli]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], Vol. 2, "Correspondence Theory of Truth", auth.: Arthur N. Prior, Macmillan, 1969, p. 224.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/truth-correspondence "Correspondence Theory of Truth", in Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Aquinas, ''[[Summa Theologiae]]'', I. Q.16, A.2 arg. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Correspondence theory was either explicitly or implicitly embraced by most of the [[Early modern philosophy|early modern]] thinkers, including [[René Descartes]], [[Baruch Spinoza]], [[John Locke]], [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]], [[David Hume]], and [[Immanuel Kant]].&lt;ref name=SEP/&gt; (However, Spinoza and Kant have also been interpreted as defenders of the [[coherence theory of truth]].)&lt;ref&gt;[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/truth-coherence/ The Coherence Theory of Truth (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)]&lt;/ref&gt; Correspondence theory has also been attributed to [[Thomas Reid]].&lt;ref&gt;M. T. Dalgarno, E. H. Matthews (eds.), ''The Philosophy of Thomas Reid'', Springer, 2012, p. 195.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[late modern philosophy]], [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling]] espoused the correspondence theory.&lt;ref&gt;Joel Harter, ''Coleridge's Philosophy of Faith: Symbol, Allegory, and Hermeneutics'', Mohr Siebeck, 2011, p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Karl Marx]] also subscribed to a version of the correspondence theory.&lt;ref&gt;Bhikhu Parekh, ''Marx's Theory of Ideology'', Routledge, 2015, p. 203.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[contemporary philosophy|contemporary]] [[Continental philosophy]], [[Edmund Husserl]] defended the correspondence theory.&lt;ref&gt;J. N. Mohanty (ed.), ''Readings on Edmund Husserl’s Logical Investigations'', Springer, 1977, p. 191.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[contemporary philosophy|contemporary]] [[analytic philosophy]], [[Bertrand Russell]],&lt;ref name=R&gt;Bertrand Russell, ''Philosophy of Logical Atomism'', Open Court, 1998 [1918].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]],&lt;ref name=W&gt;Ludwig Wittgenstein, ''Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus'', Routledge 2001 [1921].&lt;/ref&gt; [[J. L. Austin]],&lt;ref name=A&gt;Austin, J. L., 1950, "Truth", reprinted in ''Philosophical Papers'', 3rd ed., Oxford: Oxford University Press 1979, 117–33.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Karl Popper]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Popper]], ''Conjectures and Refutations: The Growth of Scientific Knowledge'', 1963.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2015/entries/popper/|title=Karl Popper|last=Thornton|first=Stephen|date=2015-01-01|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Winter 2015}} ("Popper professes to be anti-conventionalist, and his commitment to the correspondence theory of truth places him firmly within the realist's camp.")&lt;/ref&gt; defended the correspondence theory.

== Varieties ==

=== Correspondence as congruence ===

[[Bertrand Russell]]&lt;ref name=R/&gt;&lt;ref name=SEP/&gt; and [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]&lt;ref name=W/&gt;&lt;ref name=SEP/&gt; have in different ways suggested that a statement, to be true, must have some kind of structural [[isomorphism]] with the state of affairs in the world that makes it true. For example, "A cat is on a mat" is true if, and only if, there is in the world a cat and a mat and the cat is related to the mat by virtue of being on it. If any of the three pieces (the cat, the mat, and the relation between them which correspond respectively to the subject, object, and verb of the statement) is missing, the statement is false.&lt;ref&gt;Kirkham, 1992, section 4.2&lt;/ref&gt; Some sentences pose difficulties for this model, however. As just one example, adjectives such as "counterfeit", "alleged", or "false" do not have the usual simple meaning of restricting the meaning of the noun they modify: a "tall lawyer" is a kind of lawyer, but an "alleged lawyer" may not be.

In 2018, [[Claudio Costa (philosopher)|Claudio Costa]] has developed a full-blooded version of the correspondence theory of truth. This version of the theory incorporates coherence and extends the idea of correspondence to formal sciences.&lt;ref&gt;Claudio Costa, ''Philosophical semantics: Reintegrating Theoretical philosophy'', CSP, 2018, ch. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Correspondence as correlation ===

[[J. L. Austin]]&lt;ref name=A/&gt;&lt;ref name=SEP/&gt; theorized that there need not be any structural parallelism between a true statement and the state of affairs that makes it true. It is only necessary that the semantics of the [[language]] in which the statement is expressed are such as to correlate whole-for-whole the statement with the state of affairs. A false statement, for Austin, is one that is correlated by the language to a state of affairs that does not exist.&lt;ref&gt;See Kirkham, 1992, section 4.3&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relation to ontology ==

Historically, most advocates of correspondence theories have been [[metaphysical realism|metaphysical realists]]; that is, they believe that there is a world external to the minds of all humans. This is in contrast to [[Metaphysical idealism|metaphysical idealists]] who hold that everything that exists exists as a substantial metaphysical entity independently of the individual thing of which it is predicated, and also to [[Conceptualism|conceptualists]] who hold that everything that exists is, in the end, just an idea in some mind. However, it is not strictly necessary that a correspondence theory be married to metaphysical realism. It is possible to hold, for example, that the facts of the world determine which statements are true and to also hold that the world (and its facts) is but a collection of ideas in the mind of some supreme being.&lt;ref&gt;See Kirkham, 1992, section 4.6&lt;/ref&gt;

== Objections ==
One attack on the theory claims that the correspondence theory succeeds in its appeal to the real world only in so far as the real world is reachable by us.

The [[Direct realism|direct realist]] believes that we directly know objects as they are. Such a person can wholeheartedly adopt a correspondence theory of truth.

The rigorous [[idealism|idealist]] believes that there are no real objects. The correspondence theory appeals to imaginary undefined entities, so it is incoherent.

Other positions hold that we have some type of awareness, perception, etc. of real-world objects which in some way falls short of direct knowledge of them. But such an indirect awareness or perception is itself an idea in one's mind, so that the correspondence theory of truth reduces to a correspondence between ideas about truth and ideas of the world, whereupon it becomes a [[coherence theory of truth]].&lt;ref name="See Michael Williams, 1977"&gt;See Michael Williams, 1977&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vagueness or circularity === 

Either the defender of the correspondence theory of truth offers some accompanying theory of the world, or he or she does not.

If no theory of the world is offered, the argument is so vague as to be useless or even unintelligible: truth would then be supposed to be correspondence to some undefined, unknown or ineffable world.
It is difficult to see how a candid truth could be more certain than the world we are to judge its degree of correspondence against.

On the other hand, as soon as the defender of the correspondence theory of truth offers a theory of the world, he or she is operating in some specific ontological or scientific theory, which stands in need of justification.
But the only way to support the truth of this theory of the world that is allowed by the correspondence theory of truth is correspondence to the real world. Hence the argument is circular.&lt;ref name="See Michael Williams, 1977"/&gt;

'''Dallas Albert Willard''' (September 4, 1935 &amp;ndash; May 8, 2013) was an American philosopher also known for his writings on [[spiritual formation|Christian spiritual formation]]. Much of his work in philosophy was related to [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], particularly the work of [[Edmund Husserl]], many of whose writings he translated into English for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worldmag.com/2013/05/christian_philosopher_dallas_willard_dies&lt;/ref&gt; He was longtime Professor of Philosophy at [[The University of Southern California]] in Los Angeles, teaching at the school from 1965 until his death in 2013 and serving as the department chair from 1982 to 1985.&lt;ref&gt;http://dornsife.usc.edu/cf/faculty-and-staff/faculty.cfm?pid=1003820&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Willard attended [[William Jewell College]], and later graduated from [[Tennessee Temple University|Tennessee Temple College]] in 1956 with a B.A. in Psychology, and from [[Baylor University]] in 1957 with a B.A. in Philosophy and Religion. He went to graduate school at Baylor University and the [[University of Wisconsin&amp;ndash;Madison]], earning a Ph.D. in Philosophy from the University of Wisconsin with a minor in the History of Science in 1964.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;http://college.usc.edu/cf/faculty-and-staff/faculty.cfm?pid=1003820&amp;CFID=8333747&amp;CFTOKEN=64113255&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic career==
Willard spent five years teaching at the [[University of Wisconsin&amp;ndash;Madison]], first as a research and teaching assistant (1960–63), then as an Advanced Knapp Fellow (63-64), and finally as an instructor in philosophy (64-65). He then moved to the [[University of Southern California]] (USC) in Los Angeles, where he taught as an assistant professor (1965–69), as an associate professor (69-84), and finally as a full professor (1984–2013). He spent a total of 48 years at USC.

He served as director of the School of Philosophy at USC from 1982 to 1985, as well as visiting appointments at [[UCLA]] (1969) and the University of Colorado (1984).&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

His publications in philosophy are concerned primarily with epistemology, the philosophy of mind and of logic, and with the philosophy of [[Edmund Husserl]], the founder of phenomenology. He translated many of Husserl's early writings from German into English, and is widely regarded{{By whom|date=February 2017}} as an international authority on the philosopher's works, which span from the topics of time-consciousness to [[intentionality]] and intuition in Cartesian thought.

==Other work==
In addition to teaching and writing about philosophy, Willard gave lectures and wrote books about Christianity and Christian living. His book ''[[The Divine Conspiracy (book)|The Divine Conspiracy]]'' was ''[[Christianity Today]]''’s Book of the Year for 1999.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/1999/april26/9t5074.html 1999 Book Awards | Christianity Today | A Magazine of Evangelical Conviction&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Another of his books, ''[[Renovation of the Heart]]'', won ''[[Christianity Today]]''’s 2003 Book Award for books on Spirituality and The Association of Logos Bookstores' 2003 Book Award for books on Christian Living.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2003/june/4.42.html?start=1 Christianity Today Book Awards 2003 | Christianity Today | A Magazine of Evangelical Conviction&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Willard believed passivity to be a widespread problem in the Church (loosely summed up in his phrase "Grace is not opposed to effort {which is action}, but to earning {which is attitude}").&lt;ref name="dwillard1"&gt;http://www.dwillard.org/articles/artview.asp?artID=5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dwillard2"&gt;http://www.dwillard.org/articles/artview.asp?artID=71&lt;/ref&gt; He emphasized the importance of deliberately choosing to be a disciple of Jesus Christ (someone being with Jesus, learning to be like him).&lt;ref name="dwillard1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dwillard2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dwillard.org/articles/artview.asp?artID=134&lt;/ref&gt; An important outgrowth of the choice to be identified as a disciple of Jesus is the desire to learn about activities that aid spiritual transformation into the likeness of Christ.&lt;ref name="dwillard3"&gt;http://www.dwillard.org/articles/artview.asp?artID=40&lt;/ref&gt;

In this regard, being an apprentice of Jesus (someone being with Jesus, learning to be like him), involves learning about activities that might help one grow in the fruit of the spirit, namely love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control (Galatians 5:22-23).&lt;ref name="dwillard1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dwillard3"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Spirit of the Disciplines&lt;/ref&gt; Such activities might include spiritual exercises practiced throughout the ages such as prayer, fellowship, service, study, simplicity, chastity, solitude, and fasting.&lt;ref name="dwillard3"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dwillard.org/articles/artview.asp?artID=103&lt;/ref&gt; Willard explains the crucial role of engaging in spiritual exercises in his book ''The Spirit of the Disciplines: Understanding How God Changes Lives''—a book that was written after ''In Search of Guidance: Developing a Conversational Relationship with God''.

Stanley Jones]], [[William Penn]], [[Brother Lawrence]], [[Francis de Sales]], [[James Gilchrist Lawson]], and others.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dwillard.org/resources/RecReading.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

He was influenced by many, including [[Jacques Maritain]], [[Aquinas]], [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]], [[Peter Taylor Forsyth|P.T. Forsyth]], [[John Calvin]] and [[John Wesley]], [[William Law]], [[Andrew Murray (minister)|Andrew Murray]], [[Richard Baxter]], [[Teresa of Avila]], [[Francis de Sales]], [[Brother Lawrence]], and the Rule of [[St. Benedict]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

He served on the boards of the [[C.S. Lewis|C.S. Lewis Foundation]] and of [[Biola University]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dwillard.org/biography/default.asp Dallas Willard Biography]&lt;/ref&gt; He also served on the board of the Templeton foundation, and on multiple evaluation committees for the Western Association of Schools and colleges.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dwillard.org/biography/default.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Willard was born in Buffalo, Missouri on September 4, 1935, the son of Albert Willard and Maymie Lindesmith. His mother died when he was 2 years old. He married Jane Lakes of Macon, Georgia, in 1955. He had two children, John and Rebecca, and a granddaughter, Larissa.

Willard died on May 8, 2013, after a short battle with cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.christianitytoday.com/ctliveblog/archives/2013/05/died-dallas-willard-divine-conspiracy-author.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=June 7, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130607183540/http://blog.christianitytoday.com/ctliveblog/archives/2013/05/died-dallas-willard-divine-conspiracy-author.html |archivedate=June 7, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His last words were said to be "Thank you."&lt;ref&gt;http://dallaswillardcenter.com/guestbook/&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''democratization of knowledge''' is the acquisition and spread of [[knowledge]] amongst the common people, not just privileged [[elite]]s such as clergy and academics. Libraries, in particular public libraries, and modern digital technology such as the internet play a key role, as they provide the masses with open [[access to information]].

==History==
The [[printing press]] was one of the early steps towards the democratization of knowledge. Another small example of this during the [[Industrial Revolution]] was the creation of libraries for miners in some Scottish villages in the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;For example, in [[Leadhills]] in 1741 and in [[Wanlockhead]] in 1756. {{Cite book |title=Philanthropy in Victorian Scotland |author=Olive Checkland |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JUG6AAAAIAAJ |page=138 |year=1980 |isbn=978-0-85976-041-6 |postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wikipedia]] is rapidly turning into a real-time reference tool in which public entries can be updated by anyone at any time. This phenomenon—a product of the [[digital age]]—has greatly contributed to the democratization of knowledge in the post-modern era. At the same time, it has raised a number of valid criticisms in this regard (see [[Reliability of Wikipedia]] page). For instance, one could draw a distinction between the mere spread of information and the spread of ''accurate'' or ''credible'' information. Wikipedia may thus be a more reliable source of information in certain spheres, but not necessarily in others.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

==In the Digital Age==
The [[democratization of technology]] has played a major facilitating role. [[Wikipedia]] co-founder, [[Larry Sanger]], states in his article,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/sanger07/sanger07_index.html|title=Edge:  WHO SAYS WE KNOW: ON THE NEW POLITICS OF KNOWLEDGE   By Larry Sanger|author=|date=|website=www.edge.org|accessdate=15 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; that “Professionals are no longer needed for the bare purpose of the mass distribution of information and the shaping of opinion.” Sanger’s article confronts the existence of “common knowledge” and pits it against knowledge that everyone agrees on.

In terms of democratization of knowledge, [[Wikipedia]] has played a major role. For instance, Wikipedia has attracted 400 million viewers across the globe and has communicated with them in over 270 languages.

[[Google Book Search]] has been pointed to as an example of democratization of knowledge, but [[Malte Herwig]] in [[Der Spiegel]] raised concerns that the virtual [[monopoly]] [[Google]] has in the [[search market]], combined with Google's hiding of the details of its [[search algorithm]]s, could undermine this move towards democratization.&lt;ref name="spiegel"&gt;{{cite news |title=Google's Total Library: Putting The World's Books On The Web |first=Malte |last=Herwig |url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/business/0,1518,473529-2,00.html |newspaper=[[Spiegel Online]] |date=28 March 2007 |accessdate=22 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role of libraries==
An article written in 2005 by the editors of ''Reference &amp; User Services Quarterly'' calls the library the greatest force for the democratization of knowledge or information.&lt;ref name="Wallace, D. P. 2005"&gt;Wallace, D. P., &amp; Van Fleet, C. (2005). The Democratization of Information?. Reference &amp; User Services Quarterly, 45(2), 100-103.&lt;/ref&gt; It continues to say that public libraries in particular are inextricably linked with the history and evolution of the United States, but school library media centers, college and university libraries, and special libraries have all also been inﬂuential in their support for democracy.&lt;ref name="Wallace, D. P. 2005"/&gt; Libraries play an essential role in the democratization of knowledge and information by providing communities with the resources and tools to find information free of charge. Democratic access to knowledge has also been co-opted to mean providing information in a variety of formats, which essentially means electronic and digital formats for use by library patrons.&lt;ref name="knightfoundation.org"&gt;Cohen, D. (2014) An evolving, essential role for libraries. http://www.knightfoundation.org/blogs/knightblog/2014/9/30/evolving-essential-role-libraries/&lt;/ref&gt; Public libraries help further the democratization of information by guaranteeing freedom of access to information, by providing an unbiased variety of information sources and access to government services, as well as the promotion of democracy and an active citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;Ryynänen, Mirja (n.d.). Democratization of Information: Information Literacy. http://docs.nigd.org/libraries/mumbai/reports/article-10.pdf {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150218032528/http://docs.nigd.org/libraries/mumbai/reports/article-10.pdf |date=18 February 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dan Cohen, the founding executive director of the Digital Public Library of America, writes that the democratic access to knowledge is a profound idea that requires constant tending and revitalization.&lt;ref name="knightfoundation.org"/&gt; In 2004, a World Social Forum and International workshop was held entitled "Democratization of Information: Focus on Libraries". The focus of the forum was to bring awareness to the social, technological, and financial challenges facing libraries dealing with the democratization of information. Social challenges included [[globalization]] and the [[digital divide]], technological challenges included information sources, and financial challenges constituted shrinking budgets and manpower.&lt;ref&gt;Kademani, B.S. (2004). Democratization of Information: Focus on Libraries. Rapportuer- General’s Report. http://eprints.rclis.org/5045/1/Rapporteur-General-report-final.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Longtime Free Library of Philadelphia director Elliot Shelkrot said that “Democracy depends on an informed population. And where can people get all the information they need? —At the Library.” &lt;ref&gt;Quotes about Libraries and Democracy. http://www.ala.org/aboutala/governance/officers/past/kranich/demo/quotes&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Drexel 4257''', also known by an inscription on its first page, "[[John Gamble (musician)|John Gamble]], his booke, amen 1659" is a [[music manuscript]] [[commonplace book]].&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey Pulver, ''A Biographical Dictionary of Old English Music'', with a new introduction and a bibliography of the writings of Jeffrey Pulver by Gilbert Blount (New York: Da Capo Press, 1973).&lt;/ref&gt; It is the largest collection of English songs from the first half to the middle of the 17th century,{{sfn|Duckles|1948|p=24}}{{sfn|Jorgens|1987|p=v}} and is an important source for studying vocal music in its transition from  [[Renaissance music]] to [[Baroque music]] in [[England]]. Many songs also provide commentary on contemporary political events leading up to the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]].

Belonging to the [[New York Public Library]], it forms part of the Music Division's [[Drexel Collection]], located at the [[New York Public Library for the Performing Arts]]. Following traditional library practice, its name is derived from its [[Library classification|call number]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://access.rdatoolkit.org/ Resource Description and Access], rule 6.2.2.7, option c (access by subscription).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historical context ==
Before researchers took active interest in it, the field of 17th-century British song had not been investigated. Music historian [[Charles Burney]] had a negative opinion towards British vocal music in this period.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Duckles|1948|p=23.}}&lt;/ref&gt; That attitude was carried through the beginning of the 20th century, where in the first edition of the ''Oxford History of Music'', [[Hubert Parry]] stated that English composers' sense of musical line was deficient.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Duckles|1948|p=23.}} Quoting Parry, ''Oxford History of Music'', vol. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Vincent Duckles thought one reason for the negative attitude might have been the lack of published sources: Between 1627 (the publication date of [[John Hilton (composer)|John Hilton]]'s ''Ayres or Fa-las'') and 1651 ([[John Playford]]'s ''Musical Banquet''), there appeared only a single publication of British vocal music:  Walter Porter's ''Madrigales and Ayres'' of 1632.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Duckles|1948|p=23.}} Duckles incorrectly states the date as 1639.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholarly work on Drexel 4257 was one of the major reasons for a change in attitude. With over 320 songs, 250 of which contain music, it is "the largest single body of early 17th-century English songs that we know."{{sfn|Duckles|1948|p=24}}  "The composers&amp;nbsp;... all belonged to the small world of court musicians that suffered disruption during the [[English Civil War]] and the [[Commonwealth of England]]. Some began their careers late in the reign of [[James I]], most saw service in court of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]], and a few survived to return to their posts at the invitation of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]]."  For the most part, their active careers were over by 1660 or shortly thereafter.{{sfn|Duckles|1953|p=108}}

The compiler (or compilers) was not an [[antiquarian]]: this collection of songs was intended for practical use, and represents the generation of English composers active between 1630 and1660.{{sfn|Duckles|1953|p=22}} As such, Drexel 4257 "stands as the record of English musical and literary taste as it developed over a period of some thirty years," moving from the late [[Jacobean era]] to Restoration periods.{{sfn|Duckles|1953|p=27-28}} Though its musical contents may sometimes be variable, its main interest is that, as a document of its time, it reflects contemporary taste, offering comments on contemporary events and references to the past.{{sfn|Hughes|1945|p=229}}

By virtue of its repertoire and of the period covered, Drexel 4257 is closely related to other 17th-century English music manuscripts:  2240 ([[British Library]] Deposit), [[Drexel 4041]] (New York Public Library), Don.c.57 ([[Bodleian Library]]), Add. 29,396 (British Library), Add. 11,608 (British Library), MS B.1 (Bodleian Library), Add. 31432 (British Library), Add. 10337 (British Library), F.5.13 ([[Trinity College, Dublin]]), Egerton 2013 (British Library), [[Drexel 4175]] (New York Public Library), Add 29381 (British Library), MS 1041 ([[Lambeth_Palace#Library|Lambeth Palace Library]]), and MS 87 ([[Christ Church Library]]).{{sfn|Duckles|1953|p=44}}

[[File:Drexel 4257 binding.jpg|thumb|left|Binding information from the inside back cover of Drexel 4257]]

The binding of Drexel 4257 measures {{convert|30.3|xx|20|xx|4.7|cm|in}}.  It contains 227 leaves{{sfn|Duckles|1953|p=10}} which measure {{convert|29.5|xx|19|cm|in}} (the leaves' varying length can add or subtract  several millimeters to their respective measurement).  
As the image at left indicates, the volume was rebound on December 6, 1944 by Neumann Leathers of [[Hoboken, New Jersey]].  The folios are not numbered, but each song is numbered. Using different methods of enumeration, scholars have disagreed on how many songs are contained in the manuscript. Hughes wrote that the collection contained 246 songs, 146 of which are by unidentified composers, but he was only counting songs with "a musical setting sufficiently complete to make identification possible."{{sfn|Hughes|1945|p=215}} Duckles claimed there were 325 different songs numbered 1 through 329:  two songs occur twice ("Keepe on yor vayle and hide yor Eye" nos. 134 and 237, and "If thou wilt loue me I'le loue thee" nos. 174 and 215). Additionally, nos. 275 ("Stay, stay, prate noe more") and 324 ("I haue reason to Fly thee") are satirical replies to anti-Royalist lyrics not included in the manuscript.{{sfn|Duckles|1953|p=12}}  No. 206 is blank and not identified in the index, and the song "Why sligh'stt thou her whome I aproue" is both nos. 222 and 223.{{sfn|Duckles|1953|p=14|ps=. Jorgens's table of contents assigns this song just the number 222.}} There are also two songs listed in the index for which no space was allotted. For Duckles, eighty-five of the 325 songs are lacking music and have either just titles, or titles and lyrics only. Elise Bickford Jorgens counted 327 songs, including songs listed in at least one of the two tables of contents but for which there is no music. (This article and the table below uses Jorgens' enumeration.){{sfn|Jorgens|1987|p=v}}

The breakdown of the 97 songs by known composers is as follows:  John  Gamble (28), [[Henry Lawes]] (28), [[William Lawes]] (10), [[John Wilson (composer)|John Wilson]] (11), William Webb (8), [[Thomas Brewer (composer)|Thomas Brewer]] (3), Robert Smith (2), [[Nicholas Lanier]] (2), Walter Youckney{{sfn|Highfill|Burnim|Langhans|1978|loc= Vol. 16|page=346|ps=. Duckles was unaware of this violinist/composer and spelled his name Yeorknee.}} (2), [[Robert Johnson (English composer)|Robert Johnson]] (1), John Withy (1), and Charles Coleman (1).{{sfn|Hughes|1945|p=215}}

Folio 1 [[verso]] contains a bawdy lyric followed by the inscription written twice, "John Gamble his booke amen 1-6-5-9 an[n]o Domini."{{sfn|Duckles|1953|p=12}} The material on Folio 2 [[recto]] is from a later date. The upper half of the page contains an engraved portrait of Gamble, printed by W. Richardson in 1795, pasted in. The lower portion contains a brief biographical inscription concerning Gamble in the hand of the former owner, Edward F. Rimbault.{{sfn|Duckles|1953|p=13}} A note giving a brief description of the contents has been tipped in near the center of the binding.

There are two [[table of contents|tables of contents]]. The first, with the heading "The Cattalogue" on folios 3r-5r, is a numbered list of songs from 1 through 266. Starting with song no. 201, the style of enumeration varies inconsistently: no. 201 is listed as 2001, 220 is listed as 20020. Additionally, there is a group of songs incorrectly altered to 300s.{{sfn|Jorgens|1987|p=vi}} The second table, on folios 5v-8r, has no heading but is an alphabetical grouping of songs where in each letter the songs are listed sequentially. This list was apparently compiled after the manuscript was completed and includes all songs except nos. 314-317. It is written by the same hand as the enumerator of songs 177-266 in "The Cattalogue."{{sfn|Duckles|1953|p=13}}

The manuscript as currently bound (the date accompanying the binding information on the inside rear cover is stamped Dec. 6, 1944) has some songs out of sequence (nos. 331-340), surrounded by no. 311 and 312.{{sfn|Jorgens|1987|p=vi}}

== Dating ==
[[File:Drexel 4257 5.jpg|thumb|Watermark from Drexel 4257]]
The date of 1659 (from Gamble's inscription on 1v) has been a source of puzzlement to those who have studied the manuscript. Willa McClung Evans, consulting Edward Heawood's study of [[watermark]]s (used to date paper), noted the watermark, a [[fleur-de-lis]], was of undetermined origin, but was also used in Fuller's "Holy State" of 1652, and Denis Petau "History of the World" of 1659.&lt;ref&gt;Willa McClung Evans, "Lawes' Version of Shakespeare's Sonnet CXVI" Publications of the Modern Language Association of America, Vol. 51, No. 1 (Mar., 1936), p.&amp;nbsp;120–122. She cites Edward Heawood's article, "Papers used in England after 1600," The Library, Fourth Series, xi (1929), p. 263.&lt;/ref&gt; Charles W. Hughes believed the book was begun around the turn of the 17th century - a hypothesis rejected by Jorgens who notes that it contains works by Henry Lawes, born in 1596.{{sfn|Jorgens|1987|p=v}} Hughes believed the terminal date was at least 1660, as  some of the songs refer to Charles II who assumed the throne in 1660.{{sfn|Hughes|1945|p=215}} Duckles noted that the earliest lyrics were from ''England's Helicon'' (1600) and ''Davison's Poetical Rhapsody'' (1602).{{sfn|Duckles|1948|p=24}} Duckles felt that 1659 is close to the terminal date, noting that no songs had been added after the Commonwealth period, and no younger composers were included in the  collection.{{sfn|Duckles|1953|p=21}}

== Provenance ==
[[File:Drexel 4257 2.jpg|left|thumb|Folio 1v, containing a bawdy lyric and the inscription "John Gamble his booke&amp;nbsp;..." (click for close up)]]
Though writers disagree on details of the [[Calligraphy|handwriting]] (see the section on handwriting below), they all agree that the handwriting of the latter portion of Drexel 4257 is probably that of John Gamble, given that there is a concentration of his work in that part of the manuscript.{{sfn|Hughes|1945|p=222}}{{sfn|Jorgens|1987|p=vi}} This suggests that the book was begun by someone else (whom Lynn Hulse recognized as [[Thomas Jordan (poet)|Thomas Jordan]]; see below{{sfn|Hulse|1996|p=11}}). Duckles surmised that Gamble came into possession of the book in 1642–43 when the musicians of the [[Royal Chapel, Whitehall|Royal Chapel]] were dispersed as a result of the English Civil War.{{sfn|Duckles|1953|p=26}} Although Gamble lost most of his possessions in a fire in 1666, this book appears to have survived. He made out his will on 30 June 1680, in which he bequeathed his grandson (also named John Gamble) all his books of music.&lt;ref&gt;Philip H. Highfill, Jr., Kalman A. Burnim, and Edward A. Langhans, ''A Biographical Dictionary of Actors, Actresses, Musicians, Dancers, Managers &amp; Other Stage Personnel in London, 1660–1800'' vol. 5 (Carbondale: Southern Illinois University Press, 1978), p. 451.&lt;/ref&gt;

After Gamble's death in 1687, nothing is known of the manuscript for over 150&amp;nbsp;years. The first published reference to it comes in 1846, where it is mentioned in volume 19 of the [[Percy Society]]'s ''Early English Poetry, Ballads, and Popular Literature of the Middle Ages'' as being in the possession of one of the editors of the series, [[Edward Francis Rimbault]].&lt;ref&gt;Frederick W. Fairholt, introduction to "The Civic Garland," ''Early English Poetry, Ballads, and Popular Literature of the Middle Ages'' (London: Printed for the Percy Society by T. Richards, 1846), p. xi.&lt;/ref&gt; An organist and [[musicologist]], Rimbault took a keen interest in English music and voraciously collected rare books, scores, and valuable manuscripts. Upon his death, his extensive and valuable library was auctioned by [[Sotheby's]] over the course of five days. The Rimbault auction catalog entry for the Gamble manuscript reads:

&lt;blockquote&gt;A  collection  of upwards  of 300 songs by Wilson, Lawes, Johnson, Gamble, and other English composers, containing also the autograph inscription,  "John  Gamble his  book,  Amen. 1659  Anno  Domini"&lt;ref&gt;''Catalogue of the Valuable Library of the Late Edward Francis Rimbault, Comprising an Extensive and Rare Collection of Ancient Music, Printed and in Manuscript&amp;nbsp;... which will be sold by auction, by Messrs. Sotheby, Wilkinson &amp; Hodge&amp;nbsp;... on Tuesday, the 31st of July, 1877, and five following days'' (London: Sotheby, Wilkinson &amp; Hodge, 1877), p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hughes quotes a contemporaneous report of the hammer price and comment:  "Thirteen  guineas, for  America."{{sfn|Hughes|1945|p=215}} The reference was to the [[Philadelphia]]-born financier [[Joseph W. Drexel]] who had already amassed a large music library and purchased about 300 lots from the Rimbault auction. Upon Drexel's death, he bequeathed his music library to The Lenox Library. When the Lenox Library merged with the Astor Library to become the [[New York Public Library]], the [[Drexel Collection]] became the basis for one of its founding units, the Music Division. Today, Drexel 4257 is part of the Drexel Collection in the Music Division, now located at the [[New York Public Library for the Performing Arts]] at [[Lincoln Center]].

== Organization ==
Duckles noted that there are subsidiary groups organized by composer:  Henry Lawes (nos. 26-36), William Webb (nos. 160-166), Robert Smith (nos. 237-238),Thomas Brewer (nos. 244-245), Robert Johnson (nos. 108-109), and John Gamble (nos. 292-319). Similarly is the group of three songs set by John Wilson for [[Richard Brome]]'s play "[[The Northern Lass]]" (nos. 45, 46, and 47).{{sfn|Duckles|1953|p=28}}

The first 47 songs are love lyrics by poets of the [[Jacobean era|Jacobean Court]] including [[Ben Jonson]], [[William Shakespeare]], [[Robert Herrick (poet)|Robert Herrick]], [[Thomas Carew]], [[John Suckling (poet)|John Suckling]], [[Beaumont and Fletcher]]. After no. 47 a new spirit is suggested by song no. 48 "You madcapps of England that merry will make," a lusty [[drinking song]] that indicates a political shift after 1640.{{sfn|Duckles|1953|p=29}} Deliberate segregation is in evidence between songs nos. 48 and 80, where there are a series of 32 [[ballad]]s and popular songs, in contrast to the art lyrics of the first few songs. There is a brief return to the elevated nature in songs nos. 154-76. Thereafter, popular and sophisticated songs are mixed.{{sfn|Duckles|1953|p=31}}

== Handwriting ==
[[File:Drexel 4257 4.jpg|thumb|Folio 3 recto, showing a portion of "The Cattalogue" with contributions from all three hands]]
Hughes and Duckles both believed that the manuscript was written by at least two individuals.{{sfn|Hughes|1945|p=215}}{{sfn|Duckles|1953|p=13}} Hughes characterized the first hand as a "neater, older hand" dating from either at the end of the 16th century or beginning of the 17th century (a date disputed by subsequent writers - see above). The second hand copied the newer songs (including some by Gamble) and were written in a more careless hand.{{sfn|Hughes|1945|p=215}}   Hughes believed that this evidence suggested that the manuscript was begun by an unidentified person and was continued by John Gamble himself commencing with song no. 177.{{sfn|Hughes|1945|p=222}}

Following Hughes's view, Duckles also believed the manuscript was written in two hands. In his view, the first hand wrote the titles for songs nos. 1-176 of the Cattalogue, and the second hand, probably that of Gamble himself, wrote of nos. 177-266 (leaving space left to accommodate future additions) as well as the alphabetical index.{{sfn|Duckles|1953|p=13}} Duckles described the writing style of Hand 1 as favoring  "round, compact letter forms, vertical alignment, calligraphic flourishes on capitals and heavy down strokes," when writing with a broad pen. Duckles admits that Hand 1 has "two forms":{{sfn|Duckles|1953|p=24}} "When the hand writes with a finer quill, the letter forms are more loosely connected, the flourishes a little more pronounced, and there is a slight inclination to the right."  Hand no. 2 has a "pronounced slant to the right, letter forms are thin and elongated and the pen is a fine one."{{sfn|Duckles|1953|p=24}} Duckles observed that hand no. 2 participated slightly in the preparation of part 1 (nos. 1-176) with only six songs, but all of the text [[incipit]]s. Likes Hughes, Duckles also felt that Hand 2 is probably that of Gamble.{{sfn|Duckles|1953|p=25}}

Duckles hypothesized that the first hand might have been that of Ambrose Beeland, with whom Gamble apprenticed and is believed to have been his teacher.{{sfn|Duckles|1953|p=26}} Lynn Hulse refutes this, saying that the handwriting does not match existing Beeland manuscripts.{{sfn|Hulse|1996|p=11}}

Jorgens disagreed with both Hughes and Duckles and saw three different hands.{{sfn|Jorgens|1987|p=v}}  Based on the two tables of contents, Jorgens surmised that all three copyists had access to the book at one time.{{sfn|Jorgens|1987|p=vi}}  She characterized the first hand as "firm, bold but well-controlled [[secretary hand]]," the second hand as "looser and somewhat lighter secretary hand" beginning with song no. 38, and a third hand, "rougher, slanted, inclined towards the Italian style" that begins with song no. 46. All three roughly equal; by no. 177 the first two have dropped out.{{sfn|Jorgens|1987|p=v}} Hand Three has entered all of Gamble's songs and is probably his.{{sfn|Jorgens|1987|p=vi}} It also has entered text incipits. Since these incipits do not correspond with other known songs, they are probably the work of Gamble.{{sfn|Jorgens|1987|p=vi}}

Hulse identified the first hand of the Gamble manuscript is probably that of poet Thomas Jordan (ca. 1612–1685), the same hand as manuscript PwV18 in the [[University of Nottingham]], as well as other Jordan manuscripts in [[Harvard University]] and [[Bodleian Library]].{{sfn|Hulse|1996|p=10-11}} Hulse showed that Jordan and Gamble were involved in the same London circle of theatre musicians and composers for many years, culminating in Jordan's preface for Gamble's ''A Defence for Musick'' published in 1659. She identifies songs nos. 4, 16, 32, 45, 47, 99, 154, 155, 169, 170, 175, 176 and the text incipit of 96 as being copied by Jordan.{{sfn|Hulse|1996|p=24}}

== Politics ==
The lyrics to a number of songs have references to contemporary politics and events. "Since Itt hath bin lately inacted high Treason" (no. 313) carries a strong suggestion of reaction to contemporary British history.{{sfn|Hughes|1945|p=218}} One song, "Beat on, proud billows," was known to have been written by [[Roger L'Estrange]] while he was imprisoned in [[Newgate Prison]] during [[Oliver Cromwell]]'s rule (1645–1648).{{sfn|Duckles|1948|p=24}}

Some songs express regret for a better past. "Listen iolly gentlemen Listen &amp; be merry" (no. 63) praises the reign of Charles I (indirectly criticizing the then-current regime).{{sfn|Hughes|1945|p=225}} The lyric of "Reioyce all England" contrasts the 13th-century hero [[Guy of Warwick]] with current rulers.{{sfn|Hughes|1945|p=215}}  One song alludes to the marital difficulties between Charles II and his [[Portugal|Portuguese]] wife, [[Catherine of Braganza]]. Another example of [[xenophobia|distrust of foreigners]] can be seen in the lyric "Harke harke Ile tell you news from the Cort&amp;nbsp;... all ye french&amp;nbsp;... now are all sent back to France."{{sfn|Hughes|1945|p=225}} Charles II also figures in "God bless our noble king," which comically describes the king's progress from [[Whitehall]] to [[St Paul's Cathedral]].{{sfn|Hughes|1945|p=225}}

"You madcaps of England" describes frivolous English soldiers at the [[Siege of La Rochelle]], including characters named "Wentworth" (referring to [[Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford]]) and "Murrey" (referring to [[Robert Moray]]). Other names mentioned include: Wilmot, Weston, George Symon, Steadlinge, Hugh Pollerd, and "Game" possibly John Gamble.{{sfn|Hughes|1945|p=226}}

Some songs reveal prejudice against [[Puritan]]s. No. 92, ""Cock Lorrell inuited ye diuell his gestt," concerns Cock Lavorel, known as a rogue and highway robber, as friends with the devil. "The purelings of the Citty" (no. 70) is an exception, praising a [[Protestant]] service.{{sfn|Hughes|1945|p=225}}

Duckles took note of the bold lyrics to song no. 73:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Ye giddy poets that purloin &lt;br&gt;from sea and land the greatest store &lt;br&gt;to deck her ffading wenches fine, &lt;br&gt;what would you do with such a whore?'' &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Duckles clarified the meaning: "The outspoken vulgarity was not necessarily result of personal taste but a reflection of [[Cavaliers|Royalist]] protest against Puritan morality, intended to shock the taste of [[Roundheads|Parliamentarians]]."{{sfn|Duckles|1953|p=30}}

== Topical or literary content ==
Hughes argued that, unlike a textbook compilation of exemplars, Drexel 4257 shows a variety of good and mediocre poetry.{{sfn|Hughes|1945|p=224}} Most songs deal with love, and range from flowery rhetoric to frank accounts of love-making.{{sfn|Hughes|1945|p=223}}  A few, however, deal with topical matters. There are two songs related to [[Christmas]]: "Beate upp a dromm" depicts feasters in a mock battle with the cold in which the feasters win,{{sfn|Hughes|1945|p=224}} and "Christmas is my name ffar have I gone" was a popular ballad which appeared in a number of 17th-century sources. In this song, the personification of Christmas comes from far away to discover that his friends and other residents have deserted the country in favor of the city. The song concludes with a lament that universal welcome is gone because the Protestants and Puritans disassociate themselves from Christmas.{{sfn|Hughes|1945|p=224-25}} Similarly (with fewer political overtones), the song "Ladies you loose yor time" expresses preference for city life over that of the country.{{sfn|Hughes|1945|p=226}}

The song "Oh yt mine eyes", a graphic meditation on the [[Crucifixion of Jesus]], is the only song in the collection to deal with a [[religion|religious]] subject.{{sfn|Hughes|1945|p=217}}

The song "Nor loue nor fate dare I" by John Wilson bears the inscription "composed for the comedy ''The Northern Lass''".{{sfn|Hughes|1945|p=218}} Although this is the only song that the manuscript indicates is from a [[drama]], at least 26 songs have texts from dramas or [[masque]]s, attesting to Gamble's association with the theatre.{{sfn|Duckles|1953|p=34|ps=. Duckles thought that, in the future, more of the texts in the manuscript might be identified as coming from dramas or masques.}}

The songs composed by Gamble are best characterized as [[droll]]s. Drolls were collections of "cavalier wit, much of it trivial, repetitious and derivative, but at the same time containing some work of genuine literary value. Their tone was seldom dignified, often frankly sexual, and characterized by a persistent undertone of anti-Puritan feeling."{{sfn|Duckles|1953|p=37}}  Similar examples can be found in the work of Ben Jonson, Thomas Carew and John Suckling.

== Musical content and style ==
Hughes cursorily observed that Drexel 4257 contains no [[Natural (music)|naturals]]—[[Sharp (music)|sharps]] are used to cancel [[Flat (music)|flats]], and flats are used to cancel sharps.{{sfn|Hughes|1945|p=228}}  He noted that technical blunders such as [[Consecutive fifths|parallel fifths and octaves]] are to be found as well as other kinds of mistakes.{{sfn|Hughes|1945|p=228}}

Duckles's dissertation explores the transition from the [[lute song]], representing an older style of composition appropriate to the waning of [[Renaissance music]], to the continuo song, reflecting newer [[Baroque music]] practice. It's not always an easy form of composition to assess: lutes were not always used for songs, and sometimes were used even after ascendancy of the continuo song.{{sfn|Duckles|1948|p=24}} General characteristics of the lute song are smooth, flowing, and restrained lines, while the continuo song is more vigorous, abrupt and [[Disjunct (music)|discontinuous]]. The [[harmony|harmonies]] in lute songs are an outgrowth of their melodic lines, while in continuo songs they define the structure. Lute songs tend to be loose and [[melismatic]] with frequent repetitions of verse fragments, while continuo songs are more closely tied to the rhythm of the text. [[Consonance and dissonance|Dissonance]] and [[chromaticism]] are used sparingly in lute songs while continuo songs show increasing use of chromaticism for more dramatic rather than pictorial underscoring. Generally, English composers were more concerned with capturing verbal rhythms than producing dramatic effects.{{sfn|Duckles|1948|p=39}}(Hughes noted that Restoration lyrics typified Baroque figures of speech in their use of florid lyrics.){{sfn|Hughes|1945|p=223}}    Use of these techniques in England indicate their adoption from Italy, where they were first used. Previously, it had been thought that English composers either didn't know about them, or weren't interested.{{sfn|Duckles|1948|p=30}}  But a comparison of Drexel 4257 with another of Gamble's books in the [[British Library]], Additional 11608, where some of the songs appear in an [[Ornament (music)|embellished]] form, indicate that British composers and singers did occasionally  adopt a more florid style.{{sfn|Duckles|1948|p=31-32}}

Duckles examined the song "If Loue loues truth then woemen doe not loue" by [[Thomas Campion]] which appears as no. 10 of Drexel 4257 and was also published in Campion's ''Third Book of Ayres'' from about 1617. Campion was generally a conservative composer.{{sfn|Duckles|1948|p=26}}  In the version present in Drexel 4257, the melody is slightly altered to provide greater sensitivity to the declamatory text, so that the speed of the verse accelerates naturally, an alteration which Duckles finds an improvement over the original.{{sfn|Duckles|1948|p=28}}  Many songs are [[recitative]]-like. In some of these songs, the bar is enlarged as it approaches the cadence, suggesting a ballad singer who briefly pauses to catch his breath.{{sfn|Hughes|1945|p=227}} The [[hemiola]] a consistent practice in English music of this time.

Many songs are 6/4 [[meter (music)|meter]], while some suggest that they are adaptations from violin tunes.{{sfn|Hughes|1945|p=226}}  Yet, the [[bar (music)|barline]] does not always reflect the verbal rhythm.{{sfn|Hughes|1945|p=228}} In comparing the song "Ballowe my babe lye still and sleepe", no. 46 of Drexel 4257, with the version that appears in [[Elizabeth Roger's Virginal Book]], Duckles notes that the (earlier) virginal version is in duple meter with no trace of hemiolas, while the version in the Gamble manuscript has them, suggesting a modernization of an older song.{{sfn|Duckles|1948|p=37}}  Another example of continuo style is "Like Hermitt poore in pensiue place obscure" (no. 15), a lyric attributed to Sir [[Walter Raleigh]] and dating from 1591.{{sfn|Duckles|1948|p=29}}  In comparing [[Alfonso Ferrabosco the younger|Alfonso Ferrabosco]]'s setting from his Ayres of 1609 to one by Nicolas Lanier in Drexel 4257, Duckles admits the possibility that Lanier's may have been inspired by that of Ferrabosco. But the musical characteristics of the Lanier setting, including simplicity of texture, distinct phrases, use of an [[Escape tone#Escape tone|échappée]], and the suggestion of  a rhythmic [[Motif (music)|motif]] through use of a recurring pattern of eighth notes, point to contemporary text setting techniques.{{sfn|Duckles|1948|p=30}}  The song "Drowsie sun, why dostt thou stay" by Thomas Brewer (no. 253) shows expressive [[false relation]]s and harmonic [[word painting]], foreshadowing later developments in British sacred music. Brewer's songs are among the earliest examples of the Italian pathetic style in English music{{sfn|Duckles|1953|p=33}} and represent the mature style of continuo song.{{sfn|Duckles|1953|p=35}} Devices such as an octave leap look away from lute song to continuo song.{{sfn|Duckles|1948|p=28}}

Not all songs with recitative-like musical lines indicate modernism.{{sfn|Duckles|1948|p=29}}There are dance songs that contain elements of an [[ostinato]] [[bass note|bass]], [[passamezzo antico]] and the [[romanesca]]—all characteristics of Renaissance rather than Baroque periods.{{sfn|Duckles|1948|p=36}}  Several tunes and texts are of 16th-century origin had long been in the repertoire, among them: "Greensleeves," "O mistress mine," and "Back and sides go bare."&lt;ref&gt;Duckles does not indicate which works in Drexel 4257 are adaptations of these known songs.&lt;/ref&gt; With  these exceptions, the earliest songs date from Jacobean period.{{sfn|Duckles|1953|p=21}} A comparison with anthologies published by [[John Playford]] in 1652, 1653 and 1659 indicates particular songs were popular. That selections were copied into the book attests to their popularity even after tastes had changed due to the Restoration.{{sfn|Hughes|1945|p=215}}  Similarly, the song "I went from England into ffrance," a satirical narrative, refers to the song "[[John Dory]]," indicating that song's continued popularity. (It had appeared in [[Thomas Ravenscroft]]'s "Deuteromelia" of 1609, though probably dates earlier).{{sfn|Hughes|1945|p=229}} "When ye Chill Charockoe blowes" is a song containing both declamatory and tuneful styles.{{sfn|Duckles|1948|p=38}}  It is a drinking song, whose erratic harmony suggests frequent [[cadence (music)|cadences]], and whose angular melody which "moves with great vigor,"  This is in contradistinction to the lute song that emphasized continuous flow and smooth melodic motion.{{sfn|Duckles|1948|p=39}}

Duckles identifies two styles of songs of the collection:  "The [[monody|declamatory]] air" (reflecting modern style),{{sfn|Duckles|1953|p=57ff}} and "the tuneful air" (reflecting the older style, a vestige of Renaissance musical practice).{{sfn|Duckles|1953|p=79ff}}  The tuneful air could be composed based on a  preexisting tune or a tune intended to be a dance form. In examining lyric forms, Duckles identified the ballad as one type of lute song. The ballads found in Drexel 4257 are all of a sophisticated type in which satire and parody are important elements. The ballad as simple narrative or topical ballad are not represented.{{sfn|Duckles|1953|p=32}}

Warning that one must be wary of the fluid nature of musical genres,{{sfn|Duckles|1953|p=33}} Duckles categorized the following songs from Drexel 4257 as ballads: 46, 48, 49, 51, 53, 55, 56, 58, 59, 60, 62, 63, 64, 66, 67, 68, 70, 74, 76, 79, 92, 103, 104, 105, 116, 119, 120, 121, 123, 131, 142, 144, 145, 146, 147, 186, 214, 271, 272.{{sfn|Duckles|1948|p=33-34|ps=. He also bases his categorization on those texts which could be found in Hyder E. Rollins, "An Analytical Index to the Ballad-Entries in the Registers of the Company of Stationers of London," ''Studies in Philology'' vol. 21, No. 1 (Jan., 1924), pp.&amp;nbsp;1–324.}}

Duckles identified these songs as being in the declamatory style: 4, 12, 15, 20, 22, 26, 30, 31, 33, 83, 89, 108, 132, 160, 161, 162, 164, 168, 172, 182, 188, 198, 206, 238, 239, 240, 243, 247, 249, 253, 256, 260, 261, 262, 269, 274, 277, 280, 284, 285, 292, 299, 306, 311, 315, 316, 317, 323, 326.{{sfn|Duckles|1953|p=78}}

Duckles observes that by 1651, the transition from the lute song to the continuo song was complete. Printed versions of songs can not be entirely trusted to represent what was sung, since, in order to keep engraving costs manageable, they would economize on written vocal embellishments. That's why manuscript sources are crucial to our understanding of transition to Baroque vocal styles.{{sfn|Duckles|1953|p=42}} Duckles concludes by warning that those who study early 17th century lyric poetry must do so in conjunction with their intended musical settings, since words and music are inseparable.{{sfn|Duckles|1948|p=40}}

== Significance  ==
In his dissertation, Duckles summed up Gamble and his manuscript:

{{Quote|There seems to be little doubt but that Gamble's fame will rest upon his work as a compiler of an important song collection, not on his work as a composer. As a musician he was distinctly second-rate, but one can appreciate him as a man with a keen sense of the musical currents (page 138) of his time, an opportunist, who knew what the public wanted and how to turn public taste to his own professional uses&amp;nbsp;... By shrewdness and wit he managed to establish a place for himself in the rough-and-tumble world of mid-17th century music. His songs were soon forgotten, but in his "Commonplace book," compiled without any thought for posterity, he succeeded in presenting one of the most valuable sources we have of the musical taste and musical thought of his time. It is for this reason that an obscure court musician of some 300 years ago remains very much alive in the minds of students of English music history.{{sfn|Duckles|1953|p=137}} }}

'''Feminist Approaches to Bioethics''' (International Network on Feminist Approaches to Bioethics), or FAB, is a network of [[feminists]] in [[bioethics]], adding feminist perspectives to [[ethical]] issues in [[health care]] and the [[biosciences]]. It publishes a journal, ''[[International Journal of Feminist Approaches to Bioethics|IJFAB: International Journal of Feminist Approaches to Bioethics]]'', and is affiliated with the [[International Association of Bioethics]], with which it meets.

== History ==
FAB was formed in 1992 at the inaugural meeting of the IAB. Its aims are to create a more inclusive bioethical theory from the viewpoint of [[disadvantaged]] groups such as women. It critiques bioethical theory that [[Privilege (social inequality)|privileges]] groups with power.

As ''IJFAB'' editor Mary C. Rawlinson writes of the general state of bioethics in the introduction to the journal's inaugural issue,
{{quote|It was as if the masculine marking of the subject in the history of ethics and politics made no difference. Just as medicine has often assumed that it could approach the female body through nosologies and clinical practices drawn from a study of the male body, philosophers and theorists in ethics and politics seemed to think that if feminism requires an extension of the rights of man, it does not require any rethinking of the basic concepts and strategies of bioethics itself.
This assessment assumes that man, the subject of both the sciences of man and the rights of man, supplies an absolute generic. Thus, women's experience is either a special case, whose logic may apply only to itself, or its difference is irrelevant and can be subsumed without harm or loss under the generic man.
From the beginning, feminist bioethics was suspicious of this logic of abstraction in both medicine and bioethics. Its approaches were informed by the feminist critique of this sleight of hand, in which a specific historical experience is installed as the absolute universal in science or ethics. As Anne Donchin and Margrit Shildrik note in this volume, early on feminist bioethics disputed the adequacy of abstract universal norms. Feminist approaches to bioethics challenged the field for its reliance on abstract principles disconnected from the material conditions of action and the specificities of the relationships in which ethical urgencies arise. Feminist bioethics continues to contribute significantly to this critique of abstraction in ethics by exposing the complicity of its supposedly generic subject with concepts of property, propriety (norms), and privilege, as well as with the material practices that these concepts authorize in relation to others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Rawlinson | first1 = Mary C. | title = Introduction | journal = IJFAB: International Journal of Feminist Approaches to Bioethics | volume = 1 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–2 | publisher = University of Toronto Press via JSTOR | date = 2008 | jstor = 40339209 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Co-founding member Anne Donchin writes this on the occasion of FAB's 20th anniversary:
{{quote|So what has FAB accomplished in its initial twenty years? We should take heart in our influence on the development of feminist bioethics. Through a shared vision and cross-fertilization of theoretical orientations, we have brought fresh perspectives to bioethical theory and major topics in bioethics. Our contributions are distinctive insofar as treatment of these topics is grounded in feminist scholarship that draws on background norms and prevailing conditions that shape health options. We look toward a future when feminist thought has a more profound influence on bioethics, when the voices of the socially marginalized are more fully recognized, and the needs of all social groups are integrated into a system of health-care justice that is responsive to the diverse needs of humans across the globe. That we’ve made it to our twentieth anniversary and continue to have such able leadership gives me fresh confidence that FAB’s future is assured.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Donchin | first1 = Anne | title = Remarks on the occasion of FAB’s twentieth anniversary, June 25, 2012 | journal = IJFAB: International Journal of Feminist Approaches to Bioethics | volume = 7 | issue = 1 | page = 206 | publisher = University of Toronto Press via JSTOR | doi = 10.2979/intjfemappbio.7.1.204 | date = Spring 2014 | jstor = 10.2979/intjfemappbio.7.1.204 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8822">The '''Friday Fast''' is a Christian practice of abstaining from animal meat on Fridays, or holding a [[Fasting#Christianity|fast]] on Fridays, that is found  most frequently in the [[Eastern Orthodox]],&lt;ref name=OrInf&gt;[http://www.orthodoxinfo.com/praxis/exo_fasting.aspx Concerning Fasting on Wednesday and Friday]. ''Orthodox Christian Information Center''. Accessed 2010-10-08.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roman Catholic]], [[Anglican]] and [[Methodist]] traditions.&lt;ref name="Crowther1815"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Beard&gt;{{cite journal|title=The spiritual discipline of fasting|last=Beard|first=Steve|date=30 January 2012|publisher=United Methodist Church|newspaper=Good News Magazine }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Pope Peter I of Alexandria|Pope Peter of Alexandria]], the Friday fast is done in commemoration of the [[crucifixion]] of Jesus Christ on [[Good Friday]].&lt;ref name=OrInf /&gt;  Abstinence is colloquially referred to as "fasting" although it does not necessarily involve a reduction in the quantity of food.

In Roman Catholicism, specific regulations are passed by individual episcopates. In the United States in 1966, the [[USCCB]] passed Norms II and IV that bound all persons from age fourteen to abstain from meat on Fridays of [[Lent]] and through the year. In September 1983, Canons 1252 and 1253 expressed this same rule, and added that Bishops may permit substitution of other penitential practices&lt;!-- previously here: on Fridays outside of Lent only. This is not what the canons in question say. !--&gt;, but that some form of [[penance]] shall be observed on Friday in commemoration of the day of the week of the Lord's Crucifixion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usccb.org/dpp/penitential.htm Penitential Practices for Today's Catholics]. ''[[United States Conference of Catholic Bishops]]''. Accessed 2007-12-07.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most episcopal conferences have not allowed to substitute a different penance for Fridays of ''Lent'', though e. g. the German one has; no episcopal conference &lt;!-- to my knowledge !--&gt; has lifted either fasting or abstinence for Ash Wednesday and Good Friday. Abstinence on all Fridays is still the preferred practice among many Catholics.

==In Roman Catholicism==
{{Main article|Fasting and abstinence in the Catholic Church}}
Current practice of fast and abstinence is regulated by Canons 1250–1253 of the 1983 code. They specify that all Fridays throughout the year, and the time of Lent are penitential times throughout the entire Church. All adults (those who have attained the 'age of majority', which is 18 years in canon law) are bound by law to fast on Ash Wednesday and Good Friday until the beginning of their sixtieth year. All persons who have completed their fourteenth year are bound by the law of abstinence on all Fridays unless they are [[solemnity|solemnities]], and again on Ash Wednesday; but in practice this requirement has been greatly reduced by the Episcopal Conferences because under Canon 1253, it is these Conferences that have the authority to set down the local norms for fasting and abstinence in their territories. (However, the precept to both fast and abstain on Ash Wednesday and Good Friday is usually not dispensed from.)

Absent any specification of the nature of "fasting" in the current Canon Law, the traditional definition is obviously applicable here which is that on the days of mandatory fasting, Catholics may eat only one full meal during the day. Additionally, they may eat up to two small meals or snacks, known as "collations". Church requirements on fasting only relate to solid food, not to drink, so Church law does not restrict the amount of water or other beverages – even alcoholic drinks – which may be consumed.

==In Methodism==
"The General Rules of the Methodist Church," written by the founder of Methodism, [[John Wesley]], wrote that "It is expected of all who desire to continue in these societies that they should continue to evidence their desire of salvation, by attending upon all the ordinances of God, such are: the public worship of God; the ministry of the Word, either read or expounded; the Supper of the Lord; family and private prayer; searching the Scriptures; and fasting or abstinence."&lt;ref name=Beard&gt;{{cite journal|title=The spiritual discipline of fasting|last=Beard|first=Steve|date=30 January 2012|publisher=United Methodist Church|newspaper=Good News Magazine }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Directions Given to Band Societies (25 December 1744) mandated [[Fasting#Methodism|fasting]] on all Fridays of the year,&lt;ref name="Crowther1815"&gt;{{cite book|last=Crowther|first=Jonathan|title=A Portraiture of Methodism: Or, The History of the Wesleyan Methodists|year=1815|publisher=T. Blanshard|language=English|pages=251, 257}}&lt;/ref&gt; a practice that was reemphasized by [[Phoebe Palmer]] and became standard in the Methodist churches of the [[holiness movement]].&lt;ref name="Synan1997"&gt;{{cite book|last=Synan|first=Vinson|title=The Holiness-Pentecostal Tradition: Charismatic Movements in the Twentieth Century|date=25 August 1997|publisher=Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing|language=English|isbn=9780802841032|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Smith2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=Larry D.|date=September 2008|title=Progressive Sanctification|journal=God's Revivalist and Bible Advocate|publisher=[[God's Bible School and College]]|volume=120|issue=6|url=https://www.gbs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/0809_gods_revivalist.pdf|language=English|quote=Principles which underlie our Wesleyan/holiness heritage include such commitments as unquestioned scriptural authority; classical orthodox theology; identity with the one holy and apostolic church; warmhearted evangelical experience; love perfected in sanctifying grace; careful, disciplined living; structured spiritual formation, fidelity to the means of grace; and responsible witness both in public and in private—all of which converge in holiness of heart and life, which for us Methodists will always be the “central idea of Christianity.” These are bedrock essentials, and without them we shall have no heritage at all. Though we may neglect them, these principles never change. But our prudentials often do. Granted, some of these are so basic to our DNA that to give them up would be to alter the character of our movement. John Wesley, for example, believed that the prudentials of early Methodism were so necessary to guard its principles that to lose the first would be also to lose the second. His immediate followers should have listened to his caution, as should we. For throughout our history, foolish men have often imperiled our treasure by their brutal assault against the walls which our founders raised to contain them. Having said this, we must add that we have had many other prudentials less significant to our common life which have come and gone throughout our history. For instance, weekly class meetings, quarterly love feasts, and Friday fast days were once practiced universally among us, as was the appointment of circuit-riding ministers assisted by “exhorters” and “local preachers.”}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Methodist tradition encourages its adherents to fast on Fridays, especially on those during the Lenten season.&lt;ref name=Beard/&gt;

John Wesley required fasting on both Wednesdays (in remembrance of the [[Betrayal of Christ]]) and Fridays (in remembrance of His crucifixion and death) for those seeking [[holy orders]].&lt;ref name=Beard/&gt;

==In Anglicanism==
Anglican formularies, particularly the [[Book of Common Prayer]], have generally required abstinence from meat on Fridays, though it is difficult to gauge how widely followed this practice has been among Anglicans. The wording in the 1928 Book of Common Prayer of the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]] describes "All the Fridays in the Year, except [[Christmas Day]] and the [[Feast of the Epiphany|Epiphany]], or any Friday which may intervene between these Feasts" as days "on which the church requires such a measure of abstinence as is more especially suited to extraordinary acts and exercises of devotion".&lt;ref&gt;[http://justus.anglican.org/resources/bcp/1928/Calendar&amp;Tables_1928.pdf Tables and Rules for the Movable and Immovable Feasts,Together with the Days of Fasting and Abstinence, through the Whole Year], p. 3 of 6.

'''Gian Domenico Romagnosi''' ({{IPA-it|romaɲˈɲoːzi}}; 11 December 1761 &amp;ndash; 8 June 1835) was an Italian [[philosopher]], [[economist]] and [[jurist]].

==Biography==
Gian Domenico Romagnosi was born in [[Salsomaggiore Terme]].&lt;ref&gt;Cesare Cantù (1861), "[https://books.google.com/books?id=cg4uAAAAYAAJ Gian Domenico Romagnosi]". Torino: Unione Tipografico-Editrice.&lt;/ref&gt;
He studied law at the University of [[Parma]] from 1782 to 1786. In 1791 he became the chief civil magistrate of [[Trento]]. In the late 18th and early 19th century Trento was successively under the rule of France, Italy and Austria. In 1799 Romagnosi was arrested in [[Innsbruck]] during fifteen months by the Austrians on account of his alleged sympathy with the French, but he was acquitted. In 1801 the [[Napoleonic Wars|French occupied Trento]], and he was raised to the position of Secretary of the Higher Council. He was successively professor of law at Parma, Pavia, Pisa and Milan. After the fall of Napoleon he lost his position at the Milan university, but continued to lecture till 1817. In 1818 he was again tried for treason at Venice, and again acquitted. [[Carlo Cattaneo]] was his student and he was largely influenced by his thought.
He died in Milan in 1835.

His most celebrated work is ''Introduzione allo studio del diritto pubblico universale'' (2 vols., Parma, 1805).

==Electromagnetism==
Although Romagnosi was not a scientist, he made some experiments with a [[voltaic pile]] and its influence on a compass. He published two accounts of his findings in 1802, in Italian newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;Sandro Stringari, Robert R. Wilson (2000), "[http://www.lincei.it/pubblicazioni/rendicontiFMN/rol/pdf/S2000-02-03.pdf Romagnosi and the discovery of electromagnetism] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105114907/http://www.lincei.it/pubblicazioni/rendicontiFMN/rol/pdf/S2000-02-03.pdf |date=2013-11-05 }}", Rendiconti Lincei, Scienze Fisiche e Naturali, serie 9, vol. 11, pp. 115-136.&lt;/ref&gt; It is sometimes assumed that he found a relationship between [[electricity]] and [[magnetism]], about two decades before [[Hans Christian Ørsted]]'s 1820 discovery of electromagnetism. However, his experiments did not deal with electric currents, and only showed that an [[electrostatic]] charge from a voltaic pile could deflect a magnetic needle.&lt;ref&gt;Roberto de Andrade Martins (2001), "[http://ppp.unipv.it/Collana/Pages/Libri/Saggi/Nuova%20Voltiana3_PDF/cap4/4.pdf Romagnosi and Volta’s pile: early difficulties in the interpretation of Voltaic electricity]", in Fabio Bevilacqua, Lucio Fregonese (eds), Nuova Voltiana: Studies on Volta and his Times. Pavia / Milano: Università degli Studi di Pavia / Ulrico Hoepli, vol. 3, pp. 81-102.&lt;/ref&gt; 
However, as Joseph Hamel has pointed out,&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Hamel, ''[[s:Historical Account of the Introduction of the Galvanic and Electro-Magnetic Telegraph|Historical Account of the Introduction of the Galvanic and Electro-Magnetic Telegraph]]'' (1859), p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; Romagnosi's discovery was documented in the book by Joseph Izarn, ''Manuel du Galvanisme'' (1805),&lt;ref&gt;Izarn (1805), [https://books.google.com/books?id=YtoTAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA120 Chapter IX, p. 120].&lt;/ref&gt; where a galvanic current (''courant galvanique'') is explicitly mentioned. 
It was also mentioned [https://books.google.com/books?id=40OC_RX-NrYC&amp;pg=PA340 on page 340] of the book by [[Giovanni Aldini]], ''Essai théorique et expérimental sur le Galvanisme'' (1804): "Cette nouvelle propriété du galvanisme a été constatée par d'autres observateurs, et dernièrement par M. Romanesi, physicien. de Trente, qui a reconnu que le galvanisme faisait décliner l'aiguille aimantée." Aldini was also communicating with Ørsted at the time, Hamel notes.&lt;ref&gt;Hamel (1859), p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

This is an index of articles related to the issue of [[feminism]], [[women's liberation]], the [[women's movement]], and [[women's rights]].

&lt;!--
EDITORS: For almost any entry longer than one word, consider adding a similar entry at the alphabetical position for another keyword in the article title. For example, [[Feminist archaeology]] is indexed under [[Index of feminism articles#F|"F"]] and also under [[Index of feminism articles#A|"A"]] for [[Feminist archaeology|Archaeology, feminist]]. Also consider more than one additional position for one article, if the title has enough words that users might look for. For example, [[Equal Rights Amendment]], also known by the abbreviation "ERA", is indexed under [[Index of feminism articles#E|"E"]] twice, [[Index of feminism articles#R|"R"]], and [[Index of feminism articles#A|"A"]].

If deleting from one position, delete from others, too.

If changing in one position, change in others, too.

[[File:Pixelbay Question mark Word Art.png|thumb|A question mark]]
An '''inquiry''' is any process that has the aim of augmenting [[knowledge]], resolving [[doubt]], or [[problem solving|solving a problem]]. A theory of inquiry is an account of the various types of inquiry and a treatment of the ways that each type of inquiry achieves its aim.

==Inquiry theories==

===Deduction===
&lt;blockquote&gt;
When three terms are so related to one another that the last is wholly contained in the middle and the middle is wholly contained in or excluded from the first, the extremes must admit of perfect syllogism. By 'middle term' I mean that which both is contained in another and contains another in itself, and which is the middle by its position also; and by 'extremes' (a) that which is contained in another, and (b) that in which another is contained. For if ''A'' is predicated of all ''B'', and ''B'' of all ''C'', ''A'' must necessarily be predicated of all ''C''. ... I call this kind of figure the First. (Aristotle, ''Prior Analytics'', 1.4)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Induction===
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Inductive reasoning consists in establishing a relation between one extreme term and the middle term by means of the other extreme; for example, if ''B'' is the middle term of ''A'' and ''C'', in proving by means of ''C'' that ''A'' applies to ''B'';  for this is how we effect inductions. (Aristotle, ''Prior Analytics'', 2.23)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Abduction===
The ''locus classicus'' for the study of [[abductive reasoning]] is found in [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Prior Analytics]]'', Book 2, Chapt. 25. It begins this way:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
We have Reduction (απαγωγη, [[abductive reasoning|abduction]]):
:# When it is obvious that the first term applies to the middle, but that the middle applies to the last term is not obvious, yet is nevertheless more probable or not less probable than the conclusion;
:# Or if there are not many intermediate terms between the last and the middle;
For in all such cases the effect is to bring us nearer to knowledge.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

By way of explanation, [[Aristotle]] supplies two very instructive examples, one for each of the two varieties of abductive inference steps that he has just described in the abstract:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:# For example, let ''A'' stand for "that which can be taught", ''B'' for "knowledge", and ''C'' for "morality". Then that knowledge can be taught is evident;  but whether virtue is knowledge is not clear. Then if ''BC'' is not less probable or is more probable than ''AC'', we have reduction;  for we are nearer to knowledge for having introduced an additional term, whereas before we had no knowledge that ''AC'' is true.
:# Or again we have reduction if there are not many intermediate terms between ''B'' and ''C'';  for in this case too we are brought nearer to knowledge. For example, suppose that ''D'' is "to square", ''E'' "rectilinear figure", and ''F'' "circle".  Assuming that between ''E'' and ''F'' there is only one intermediate term — that the circle becomes equal to a rectilinear figure by means of [[Lune (mathematics)|lunules]] — we should approximate to knowledge. ([[Aristotle]], "[[Prior Analytics]]", 2.25, with minor alterations)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Aristotle's latter variety of abductive reasoning, though it will take some explaining in the sequel, is well worth our contemplation, since it hints already at streams of inquiry that course well beyond the syllogistic source from which they spring, and into regions that Peirce will explore more broadly and deeply.

==Inquiry in the pragmatic paradigm&lt;!--Section linked from [[Issue-based information system]] and [[Problem structuring methods]]: do not rename without fixing incoming link (see [[MOS:HEAD]])--&gt;==
In the pragmatic philosophies of [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], [[William James]], [[John Dewey]], and others, inquiry is closely associated with the [[normative science]] of [[logic]]. In its inception, the pragmatic model or theory of inquiry was extracted by Peirce from its raw materials in classical logic, with a little bit of help from [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], and refined in parallel with the early development of symbolic logic by [[George Boole|Boole]], [[Augustus De Morgan|De Morgan]], and Peirce himself to address problems about the nature and conduct of scientific reasoning. Borrowing a brace of concepts from [[Aristotle]], Peirce examined three fundamental modes of reasoning that play a role in inquiry, commonly known as [[abductive reasoning|abductive]], [[deductive reasoning|deductive]], and [[inductive reasoning|inductive]] [[inference]].

In rough terms, ''[[abductive reasoning|abduction]]'' is what we use to generate a likely [[hypothesis]] or an initial [[diagnosis]] in response to a phenomenon of interest or a problem of concern, while ''[[deductive reasoning|deduction]]'' is used to clarify, to derive, and to explicate the relevant consequences of the selected hypothesis, and ''[[inductive reasoning|induction]]'' is used to test the sum of the predictions against the sum of the data. It needs to be observed that the classical and pragmatic treatments of the types of reasoning, dividing the generic territory of inference as they do into three special parts, arrive at a different characterization of the environs of reason than do those accounts that count only two.

These three processes typically operate in a cyclic fashion, systematically operating to reduce the uncertainties and the difficulties that initiated the inquiry in question, and in this way, to the extent that inquiry is successful, leading to an increase in knowledge or in skills.

In the pragmatic way of thinking everything has a purpose, and the purpose of each thing is the first thing we should try to note about it.&lt;ref&gt;Rescher, N. (2012). ''Pragmatism: The Restoration of its Scientific Roots''. New Brunswick, NJ: Transaction Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of inquiry is to reduce doubt and lead to a state of belief, which a person in that state will usually call ''[[knowledge]]'' or ''[[certainty]]''. As they contribute to the end of inquiry, we should appreciate that the three kinds of inference describe a cycle that can be understood only as a whole, and none of the three makes complete sense in isolation from the others. For instance, the purpose of abduction is to generate guesses of a kind that deduction can explicate and that induction can evaluate. This places a mild but meaningful constraint on the production of hypotheses, since it is not just any wild guess at explanation that submits itself to reason and bows out when defeated in a match with reality. In a similar fashion, each of the other types of inference realizes its purpose only in accord with its proper role in the whole cycle of inquiry. No matter how much it may be necessary to study these processes in abstraction from each other, the integrity of inquiry places strong limitations on the effective [[modularity]] of its principal components.

In ''Logic: The Theory of Inquiry'', John Dewey defined inquiry as "the controlled or directed transformation of an indeterminate situation into one that is so determinate in its constituent distinctions and relations as to convert the elements of the original situation into a unified whole"&lt;ref&gt;Dewey, John (1938). ''Logic: The Theory of Inquiry''. New York:NY: D.C. Heath &amp; Co.&lt;http://www2.sunysuffolk.edu/osullis/spring07/courses/page0/history/documents_files/Dewey_pattern%20of%20inquiry.pdf&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Dewey and Peirce's conception of inquiry extended beyond a system of thinking and incorporated the social nature of inquiry. These ideas are summarize in the notion [[Community of inquiry]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Wikisource:The Fixation of Belief]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Seixas|first=Peter|title=The Community of Inquiry as a Basis for Knowledge and Learning: The Case of History|url=http://aer.sagepub.com/content/30/2/305.short|publisher=Sage|accessdate=4 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Shields|first=Patricia|title=The Community of Inquiry|url=http://aas.sagepub.com/content/35/5/510.short|publisher=Sage|accessdate=4 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Art and science of inquiry===
For our present purposes, the first feature to note in distinguishing the three principal modes of reasoning from each other is whether each of them is exact or approximate in character. In this light, deduction is the only one of the three types of reasoning that can be made exact, in essence, always deriving true conclusions from true premises, while abduction and induction are unavoidably approximate in their modes of operation, involving elements of fallible judgment in practice and inescapable error in their application.

The reason for this is that deduction, in the ideal limit, can be rendered a purely internal process of the reasoning agent, while the other two modes of reasoning essentially demand a constant interaction with the outside world, a source of phenomena and problems that will no doubt continue to exceed the capacities of any finite resource, human or machine, to master. Situated in this larger reality, approximations can be judged appropriate only in relation to their context of use and can be judged fitting only with regard to a purpose in view.

A parallel distinction that is often made in this connection is to call deduction a ''demonstrative'' form of inference, while abduction and induction are classed as ''[[non-demonstrative]]'' forms of reasoning. Strictly speaking, the latter two modes of reasoning are not properly called inferences at all. They are more like controlled associations of words or ideas that just happen to be successful often enough to be preserved as useful heuristic strategies in the repertoire of the agent. But non-demonstrative ways of thinking are inherently subject to error, and must be constantly checked out and corrected as needed in practice.

In classical terminology, forms of judgment that require attention to the context and the purpose of the judgment are said to involve an element of "art", in a sense that is judged to distinguish them from "science", and in their renderings as expressive judgments to implicate arbiters in styles of [[rhetoric]], as contrasted with [[logic]].

In a figurative sense, this means that only deductive logic can be reduced to an exact theoretical science, while the practice of any empirical science will always remain to some degree an art.

===Zeroth order inquiry===
Many aspects of inquiry can be recognized and usefully studied in very basic logical settings, even simpler than the level of [[syllogism]], for example, in the realm of reasoning that is variously known as ''[[Boolean algebra (logic)|Boolean algebra]]'', ''[[propositional logic|propositional calculus]]'', ''sentential calculus'', or ''zeroth-order logic''. By way of approaching the learning curve on the gentlest availing slope, we may well begin at the level of ''[[zeroth-order inquiry]]'', in effect, taking the syllogistic approach to inquiry only so far as the propositional or sentential aspects of the associated reasoning processes are concerned. One of the bonuses of doing this in the context of Peirce's logical work is that it provides us with doubly instructive exercises in the use of his [[logical graph]]s, taken at the level of his so-called "[[alpha graph]]s".

In the case of propositional calculus or sentential logic, deduction comes down to applications of the [[transitive relation|transitive law]] for conditional implications and the approximate forms of inference hang on the properties that derive from these. In describing the various types of inference I will employ a few old "terms of art" from classical logic that are still of use in treating these kinds of simple problems in reasoning.

: '''Deduction''' takes a Case, the [[minor premise]] &lt;math&gt;X \Rightarrow Y&lt;/math&gt;
: and combines it with a Rule, the major premise &lt;math&gt;Y \Rightarrow Z&lt;/math&gt;
: to arrive at an Act, the demonstrative [[logical consequence|conclusion]] &lt;math&gt;X \Rightarrow Z.&lt;/math&gt;

: '''Induction''' takes a Case of the form &lt;math&gt;X \Rightarrow Y&lt;/math&gt;
: and matches it with a Fact of the form &lt;math&gt;X \Rightarrow Z&lt;/math&gt;
: to infer a Rule of the form &lt;math&gt;Y \Rightarrow Z.&lt;/math&gt;

: '''Abduction''' takes a Fact of the form &lt;math&gt;X \Rightarrow Z&lt;/math&gt;
: and matches it with a Rule of the form &lt;math&gt;Y \Rightarrow Z&lt;/math&gt;
: to infer a Case of the form &lt;math&gt;X \Rightarrow Y.&lt;/math&gt;

For ease of reference, Figure 1 and the Legend beneath it
summarize the classical terminology for the three types
of inference and the relationships among them.

In its original usage a statement of Fact has to do with a deed done or a record made, that is, a type of event that is openly observable and not riddled with speculation as to its very occurrence. In contrast, a statement of Case may refer to a hidden or a hypothetical cause, that is, a type of event that is not immediately observable to all concerned. Obviously, the distinction is a rough one and the question of which mode applies can depend on the points of view that different observers adopt over time. Finally, a statement of a Rule is called that because it states a regularity or a regulation that governs a whole class of situations, and not because of its syntactic form. So far in this discussion, all three types of constraint are expressed in the form of conditional propositions, but this is not a fixed requirement. In practice, these modes of statement are distinguished by the roles that they play within an argument, not by their style of expression. When the time comes to branch out from the syllogistic framework, we will find that propositional constraints can be discovered and represented in arbitrary syntactic forms.

==Example of inquiry==
Examples of inquiry, that illustrate the full cycle of its abductive, deductive, and inductive phases, and yet are both concrete and simple enough to be suitable for a first (or zeroth) exposition, are somewhat rare in Peirce's writings, and so let us draw one from the work of fellow pragmatician [[John Dewey]], analyzing it according to the model of zeroth-order inquiry that we developed above.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
A man is walking on a warm day. The sky was clear the last time he observed it; but presently he notes, while occupied primarily with other things, that the air is cooler. It occurs to him that it is probably going to rain; looking up, he sees a dark cloud between him and the sun, and he then quickens his steps. What, if anything, in such a situation can be called thought? Neither the act of walking nor the noting of the cold is a thought. Walking is one direction of activity; looking and noting are other modes of activity. The likelihood that it will rain is, however, something ''suggested''. The pedestrian ''feels'' the cold; he ''thinks of'' clouds and a coming shower. (John Dewey, ''[[How We Think]]'', 1910, pp. 6-7).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Once over quickly===
Let's first give Dewey's example of inquiry in everyday life the quick once over, hitting just the high points of its analysis into Peirce's three kinds of reasoning.

====Abductive phase====
In Dewey's "Rainy Day" or "Sign of Rain" story, we find our peripatetic hero presented with a surprising Fact:
:* Fact: C → A, In the Current situation the Air is cool.

Responding to an intellectual reflex of puzzlement about the situation, his resource of common knowledge about the world is impelled to seize on an approximate Rule:
:* Rule: B → A, Just Before it rains, the Air is cool.
This Rule can be recognized as having a potential relevance to the situation because it matches the surprising Fact, C → A, in its consequential feature A.

All of this suggests that the present Case may be one in which it is just about to rain:
:* Case: C → B,  The Current situation is just Before it rains.

The whole mental performance, however automatic and semi-conscious it may be, that leads up from a problematic Fact and a previously settled knowledge base of Rules to the plausible suggestion of a Case description, is what we are calling an [[abductive inference]].

====Deductive phase====
The next phase of inquiry uses deductive inference to expand the implied consequences of the abductive hypothesis, with the aim of testing its truth. For this purpose, the inquirer needs to think of other things that would follow from the consequence of his precipitate explanation. Thus, he now reflects on the Case just assumed:
:* Case: C → B, The Current situation is just Before it rains.

He looks up to scan the sky, perhaps in a random search for further information, but since the sky is a logical place to look for details of an imminent rainstorm, symbolized in our story by the letter B, we may safely suppose that our reasoner has already detached the consequence of the abduced Case, C → B, and has begun to expand on its further implications. So let us imagine that our up-looker has a more deliberate purpose in mind, and that his search for additional data is driven by the new-found, determinate Rule:
:* Rule: B → D, Just Before it rains, Dark clouds appear.

Contemplating the assumed Case in combination with this new Rule leads him by an immediate deduction to predict an additional Fact:
:* Fact: C → D, In the Current situation Dark clouds appear.

The reconstructed picture of reasoning assembled in this second phase of inquiry is true to the pattern of [[deductive inference]].

====Inductive phase====
Whatever the case, our subject observes a Dark cloud, just as he would expect on the basis of the new hypothesis. The explanation of imminent rain removes the discrepancy between observations and expectations and thereby reduces the shock of surprise that made this process of inquiry necessary.

===Looking more closely===

====Seeding hypotheses====
Figure 4 gives a graphical illustration of Dewey's example of inquiry, isolating for the purposes of the present analysis the first two steps in the more extended proceedings that go to make up the whole inquiry.

Figure 4.  Dewey's 'Rainy Day' Inquiry
&lt;/pre&gt;

In this analysis of the first steps of Inquiry, we have a complex or a mixed form of inference that can be seen as taking place in two steps:
:* The first step is an Abduction that abstracts a Case from the consideration of a Fact and a Rule.
:: Fact: C → A, In the Current situation the Air is cool.
:: Rule: B → A, Just Before it rains, the Air is cool.
:: Case: C → B, The Current situation is just Before it rains.

:* The final step is a Deduction that admits this Case to another Rule and so arrives at a novel Fact.
:: Case: C → B, The Current situation is just Before it rains.
:: Rule: B → D, Just Before it rains, a Dark cloud will appear.
:: Fact: C → D, In the Current situation, a Dark cloud will appear.

This is nowhere near a complete analysis of the Rainy Day inquiry, even insofar as it might be carried out within the constraints of the syllogistic framework, and it covers only the first two steps of the relevant inquiry process, but maybe it will do for a start.

One other thing needs to be noticed here, the formal duality between this expansion phase of inquiry and the argument from [[analogy]]. This can be seen most clearly in the propositional [[graph (data structure)|lattice]] diagrams shown in Figures 3 and 4, where analogy exhibits a rough "A" shape and the first two steps of inquiry exhibit a rough "V" shape, respectively. Since we find ourselves repeatedly referring to this expansion phase of inquiry as a unit, let's give it a name that suggests its duality with [[analogical reasoning|analogy]]—"[[catalogical reasoning|catalogy]]" will do for the moment. This usage is apt enough if one thinks of a catalogue entry for an item as a text that lists its salient features. Notice that [[analogical reasoning|analogy]] has to do with the examples of a given quality, while [[catalogical reasoning|catalogy]] has to do with the qualities of a given example. Peirce noted similar forms of duality in many of his early writings, leading to the consummate treatment in his 1867 paper [http://www.cspeirce.com/menu/library/bycsp/newlist/nl-frame.htm "On a New List of Categories"] (CP 1.545-559, W 2, 49-59).

====Weeding hypotheses====
In order to comprehend the bearing of [[inductive reasoning]] on the closing phases of inquiry there are a couple of observations that we need to make:
:* First, we need to recognize that smaller inquiries are typically woven into larger inquiries, whether we view the whole pattern of inquiry as carried on by a single agent or by a complex community.
:* Further, we need to consider the different ways in which the particular instances of inquiry can be related to ongoing inquiries at larger scales. Three modes of inductive interaction between the micro-inquiries and the macro-inquiries that are salient here can be described under the headings of the "Learning", the "Transfer", and the "Testing" of rules.

====Analogy of experience====
Throughout inquiry the reasoner makes use of rules that have to be transported across intervals of experience, from the masses of experience where they are learned to the moments of experience where they are applied. Inductive reasoning is involved in the learning and the transfer of these rules, both in accumulating a knowledge base and in carrying it through the times between acquisition and application.
:* Learning. The principal way that induction contributes to an ongoing inquiry is through the learning of rules, that is, by creating each of the rules that goes into the knowledge base, or ever gets used along the way.
:* Transfer. The continuing way that induction contributes to an ongoing inquiry is through the exploit of analogy, a two-step combination of induction and deduction that serves to transfer rules from one context to another.
:* Testing. Finally, every inquiry that makes use of a knowledge base constitutes a "field test" of its accumulated contents. If the knowledge base fails to serve any live inquiry in a satisfactory manner, then there is a prima facie reason to reconsider and possibly to amend some of its rules.

Let's now consider how these principles of learning, transfer, and testing apply to John Dewey's "Sign of Rain" example.

=====Learning=====
Rules in a knowledge base, as far as their effective content goes, can be obtained by any mode of inference.

For example, a rule like:
:* Rule: B → A, Just Before it rains, the Air is cool,
is usually induced from a consideration of many past events, in a manner that can be rationally reconstructed as follows:
:* Case: C → B, In Certain events, it is just Before it rains,
:* Fact: C → A, In Certain events, the Air is cool,
: ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
:* Rule: B → A, Just Before it rains, the Air is cool.

However, the very same proposition could also be abduced as an explanation of a singular occurrence or deduced as a conclusion of a presumptive theory.

=====Transfer=====
What is it that gives a distinctively inductive character to the acquisition of a knowledge base? It is evidently the "analogy of experience" that underlies its useful application. Whenever we find ourselves prefacing an argument with the phrase "If past experience is any guide..." then we can be sure that this principle has come into play. We are invoking an analogy between past experience, considered as a totality, and present experience, considered as a point of application. What we mean in practice is this: "If past experience is a fair sample of possible experience, then the knowledge gained in it applies to present experience". This is the mechanism that allows a knowledge base to be carried across gulfs of experience that are indifferent to the effective contents of its rules.

Here are the details of how this notion of transfer works out in the case of the "Sign of Rain" example:

Let K(pres) be a portion of the reasoner's knowledge base that is [[logical equivalence|logically equivalent]] to the conjunction of two rules, as follows:
:* K(pres) = (B → A) and (B → D).

K(pres) is the present knowledge base, expressed in the form of a logical constraint on the present [[universe of discourse]].

It is convenient to have the option of expressing all logical statements in terms of their [[model theory|logical models]], that is, in terms of the primitive circumstances or the elements of experience over which they hold true.
:* Let E(past) be the chosen set of experiences, or the circumstances that we have in mind when we refer to "past experience".
:* Let E(poss) be the collective set of experiences, or the projective total of possible circumstances.
:* Let E(pres) be the present experience, or the circumstances that are present to the reasoner at the current moment.

If we think of the knowledge base K(pres) as referring to the "regime of experience" over which it is valid, then all of these sets of models can be compared by the simple relations of [[set inclusion]] or [[logical implication]].

Figure 5 schematizes this way of viewing the "analogy of experience".

Figure 5.  Analogy of Experience
&lt;/pre&gt;

In these terms, the "analogy of experience" proceeds by inducing a Rule about the validity of a current knowledge base and then deducing a Fact, its applicability to a current experience, as in the following sequence:

Inductive Phase:
:* Given Case: E(past) → E(poss), Chosen events fairly sample Collective events.
:* Given Fact: E(past) → K(pres), Chosen events support the Knowledge regime.
: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
:* Induce Rule: E(poss) → K(pres), Collective events support the Knowledge regime.

Deductive Phase:
:* Given Case: E(pres) → E(poss), Current events fairly sample Collective events.
:* Given Rule: E(poss) → K(pres), Collective events support the Knowledge regime.
: --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
:* Deduce Fact: E(pres) → K(pres), Current events support the Knowledge regime.

=====Testing=====
If the observer looks up and does not see dark clouds, or if he runs for shelter but it does not rain, then there is fresh occasion to question the utility or the validity of his knowledge base. But we must leave our foulweather friend for now and defer the logical analysis of this testing phase to another occasion.

{{refimprove|date=April 2017}}

'''Institutional memory''' is a collective set of facts, concepts, experiences and knowledge held by a group of people.

== Concept ==
Institutional memory has been defined as "the stored knowledge within the organization."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=pKLoqMFF4QsC|title=Communicable Crises: Prevention, Response, and Recovery in the Global Arena|last=Gibbons|first=Deborah E.|date=2007-01-01|publisher=IAP|isbn=9781593116071|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Institutional memory requires the ongoing transmission of these memories between members of this group. Elements of institutional memory may be found in [[corporation]]s, professional groups, [[government body|government bodies]], [[Religious denomination|religious group]]s, academic collaborations, and by extension in entire [[culture]]s. There are different ideas about how institutional memory is transferred, whether it is between people or through written sources&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Corbett|first=Jack|last2=Grube|first2=Dennis C.|last3=Lovell|first3=Heather|last4=Scott|first4=Rodney|date=2018-02-12|title=Singular memory or institutional memories? Toward a dynamic approach|url=http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/gove.12340|journal=Governance|language=en|doi=10.1111/gove.12340|issn=0952-1895}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Institutional memory may be encouraged to preserve an [[ideology]] or way of work in such a group. Conversely, institutional memory may be ingrained to the point that it becomes hard to challenge if something is found to contradict that which was previously thought to have been correct. Institutional memory may have influence on [[organizational identity]], choice of individuals, and actions of the individuals interacting with the institution.

==Institutional knowledge==
Institutional knowledge is gained by organizations translating historical data into useful knowledge and wisdom. Memory depends upon the preservation of data and also the analytical skills necessary for its effective use within the organization.

[[Religion]] is one of the significant institutional forces acting on the collective memory attributed to humanity. Alternatively, the evolution of ideas in [[Marxist]] theory, is that the mechanism whereby knowledge and wisdom are passed down through the generations is subject to [[economic determinism]]. In all instances, social systems, cultures, and organizations have an interest in controlling and using institutional memories.

Organizational structure determines the training requirements and expectations of behaviour associated with various roles. This is part of the implicit institutional knowledge. Progress to higher echelons requires assimilation of this, and when outsiders enter at a high level, effectiveness tends to deteriorate if this morale is unjustly ignored.

'''Jože Pučnik''' (9 March 1932 &amp;ndash; 11 January 2003) was a [[Slovenia]]n patriot, [[public intellectual]], [[sociologist]] and [[politician]]. During the [[Communist]] regime of [[Josip Broz Tito]], Pučnik was one of the most outspoken Slovenian critics of dictatorship and lack of civil liberties in [[Yugoslavia]]. He was imprisoned for a total of seven years, and later forced into exile. After returning to Slovenia in the late 1980s, he became the leader of the [[Democratic Opposition of Slovenia]], a platform of democratic parties that defeated the Communists in the first free elections in 1990 and introduced a democratic system and market economy to Slovenia. He is also considered one of the fathers of Slovenian independence from Yugoslavia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pogovori.drugisvet.com/2010/12/rosvita-pesek-pucnik-je-bil-motor-slovenskega-osamosvajanja/ Rosvita Pesek: Pučnik je bil motor slovenskega osamosvajanja] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725225110/http://pogovori.drugisvet.com/2010/12/rosvita-pesek-pucnik-je-bil-motor-slovenskega-osamosvajanja/ |date=2011-07-25 }}, Pogvori drugisvet.com&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life and formation ==
Pučnik was born in the village of [[Črešnjevec, Slovenska Bistrica|Črešnjevec]] in [[Slovenian Styria]] (now part of the municipality of [[Slovenska Bistrica]]), in what was then the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]]. He came from a [[Roman Catholic]] peasant background. His family had supported the [[Liberation Front of the Slovenian People]] during [[World War II]]: his older brother Ivan was an anti-Nazi resistance fighter in the [[Yugoslav Partisans|Yugoslav Partisan]] movement.

Already as a teenager, Pučnik clashed with the [[Communist]] establishment. Because of some critical thoughts published in the high school paper ''Iskanja'' ("Quests") he was prohibited from taking his final exam.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.mladina.si/tednik/200303/clanek/pucniknekrolog/ Jože Pučnik (1932-2003)], Mladina.si &lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Since he couldn't enroll in the University, he was drafted in the [[Yugoslav People's Army]]. After completing the military service, he took the final exam, passed it and enrolled at the [[University of Ljubljana]], where he studied [[philosophy]] and [[comparative literature]], graduating in 1958. 

While living in [[Ljubljana]], he became involved with a group of young intellectuals, known as the [[Critical generation]], which tried to open a space for public debate and challenged the rigid cultural policies of the [[Titoist]] regime in the [[Socialist Republic of Slovenia]]. Among Pučnik's closest collaborators from that period were the literary historian [[Taras Kermauner]], sociologist [[Veljko Rus]], and poet [[Veno Taufer]]. Pučnik believed that the system could be changed from inside and therefore joined the [[Communist Party of Slovenia]]. At the same time, he published several articles in the ''[[Revija 57]]'' magazine, in which he openly criticised the economic policies of the [[Communist regime]].

== The dissident years ==

In 1958, Pučnik was arrested accused of "subversion of the Socialist system" and sentenced to 9 years in jail. At the trial, which lasted only a couple of hours, he was accused of having instigated workers to strike. Some have suggested that Pučnik's imprisonment was a deliberate attempt by the regime to silence dissident intellectuals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rtvslo.si/odprtikop/intervju/dr-taras-kermauner/ Interview with Taras Kermauner on the Sloevnian National TV] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080411030937/http://www.rtvslo.si/odprtikop/intervju/dr-taras-kermauner/ |date=2008-04-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was released in 1963 and immediately continued writing for the alternative journal ''[[Perspektive]]''. At this point he was already publicly stating his disapproval of the regime.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; In 1964, his article ''Problemi našega kmetijstva'' ("The Problems of Our Agriculture") was published in the journal ''[[Perspektive]]''. In it, Pučnik criticized the agricultural policy of the regime, arguing that it was inefficient using publicly available official data. He was arrested again, sentenced to another two years in prison and expelled from the Communist Party. 

During his time in prison, Pučnik became an idol for his generation.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;[http://www.rtvslo.si/odprtikop/intervju/dr-taras-kermauner/ Odprti kop - Intervju: Dr. Taras Kermauner&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080411030937/http://www.rtvslo.si/odprtikop/intervju/dr-taras-kermauner/ |date=2008-04-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The playwright [[Dominik Smole]] dedicated him the play [[Antigone (Dominik Smole)|Antigone]] and [[Primož Kozak]] portrayed him in the leading role of his play ''Afera'' ("The Affaire"). Both plays were metaphors for the totalitarian repression in Communist Yugoslavia.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

== Exile and academic career ==

Pučnik was released from jail in 1966. After several unsuccessful attempts to find a job, he decided to emigrate to [[Germany]]. He settled in [[Hamburg]], making a living from manual jobs. When he decided to enrol as a postgraduate student at the [[University of Hamburg]], the University of Ljubljana refused to provide him with a copy of his degree.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ijpucnik.si/joze_pucnik Inštitut Jožeta Pučnika =&gt; joze pucnik&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080316065721/http://www.ijpucnik.si/joze_pucnik |date=2008-03-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; He thus enrolled again to [[undergraduate]] study of [[philosophy]] and [[sociology]], obtaining his [[PhD]] in 1971. He worked at the universities of Hamburg and [[Lüneburg]], where he taught sociology. During his life in Germany, Pučnik became a supporter of the [[German Social Democratic Party]], maintaining close relations with several of its leaders. In the late 1980s, he became an open admirer of the Social Democratic leader of [[Lower Saxony]] [[Gerhard Schröder]], later [[Chancellor of Germany (Federal Republic)|chancellor of Germany]], whom he took as his main role model for his subsequent political activity.&lt;ref&gt;Taras Kermauner, Skupinski portret z Dušanom Pirjevcem. Ljubljana: Znanstveno in raziskovalno središče, 2002. P. 139&lt;/ref&gt;

In the academic sphere, he became influenced by the theories of [[Jürgen Habermas]], [[Niklas Luhmann]] and his [[system theory]], as well as by several phenomenological sociologists such as [[Alfred Schutz]] and the [[Slovenes|Slovene]]-born [[Thomas Luckmann]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ceeol.com/aspx/getdocument.aspx?logid=5&amp;id=F681B62B-37ED-4910-8E7B-93F5B140CCE7&lt;/ref&gt; 

During his years of exile, he kept up a correspondence with several important critical intellectuals in Slovenia, especially [[Ivo Urbančič]].

== Return to Slovenia ==

In the 1980s, Pučnik could again publish articles in Slovenia, this time in the alternative journal ''[[Nova revija (magazine)|Nova revija]]''. In 1987, he co-authored the [[Contributions to the Slovenian National Program]], published in the 57th issue of the Nova revija journal. The text was written as the response to the [[Memorandum of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts]] of 1986, and set the grounds for a political opposition to the Communist regime. It was also the first legally published publication openly advocating Slovenia's independence from Yugoslavia. Pučnik's article was centred on issues of democratization and political plurality, and openly stressed the need for Slovenia's full sovereignty in order to secure such development.

He returned to Slovenia in 1989 at the invitation of the newly formed opposition [[Slovenian Democratic Party|Social Democratic Union of Slovenia]]. He was elected president of the party in 1989 and the following year he was chosen as the leader of the [[Democratic Opposition of Slovenia]], a common platform of all democratic opposition parties in Slovenia. The coalition won the first democratic elections in 1990. Pučnik ran for [[President of Slovenia]] but lost to [[Milan Kučan]], the last secretary general of the [[Communist Party of Slovenia]]. He was nevertheless elected to the [[Slovenian Parliament]] and remained the official leader of the Democratic Opposition of Slovenia, and the coalition's parliamentary leader. 

Between 1990 and 1992, he was among those who led [[Slovenia]] to independence from [[Socialist Federative Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]]. In 1992, after the fall of [[Lojze Peterle]]'s coalition government, Pučnik decided to lead his party into a coalition with the [[Liberal Democracy of Slovenia|Liberal Democratic Party]] and briefly served as vice-president in the first government of [[Janez Drnovšek]].

In the elections of 1992, the [[Slovenian Democratic Party|Social Democratic Party of Slovenia]] suffered a complete defeat, gaining a mere 3.4% of the vote, barely securing the entry into the Parliament. Pučnik resigned as president of the party in favour of [[Janez Janša]]. Between 1992 and 1996, Pučnik served as a member of the [[National Assembly of Slovenia]]. During this time, he led a parliamentary commission to clarify political responsibility for the summary executions perpetrated by the Communist regime in Slovenia after [[World War II]] .

After 1996, he retired from active politics, but remained honorary president of the [[Slovenian Democratic Party|Social Democratic Party of Slovenia]] and continued to voice his opinion on matters of public interest. He remained utterly critical of the policies of [[Prime Minister of Slovenia|Prime Minister]] [[Janez Drnovšek]] and President [[Milan Kučan]]. He also criticized the political transition to democracy in general, especially the insufficient implementation of the rule of law, the widespread corruption and the maintenance of the power networks from the previous regime.

He died in Germany in 2003 and was buried in his home village of Črešnjevec. His funeral was attended by a huge crowd. The eulogy was delivered by philosopher and his lifelong friend [[Ivo Urbančič]].

== Legacy ==
Pučnik is considered to be one of the fathers of independent Slovenia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://druzina.si/icd/spletnastran.nsf/all/ccd4e15db3744c51c12573c600365d07?OpenDocument&amp;Click= V čast domovini: Stati inu obstati], 6 January 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.slovenskenovice.si/clanek/o144141 |accessdate=January 16, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120910093754/http://www.slovenskenovice.si/clanek/o144141 |archivedate=September 10, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rtvslo.si/slovenija/sest-let-od-smrti-jozeta-pucnika/96000 Posmrtno odlikovanje za Jožeta Pučnika Pučnikovega odlikovanja ni prevzel nihče Objavljeno], 22 June 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Some, especially in the Slovenian right wing circles, have also called him "Father of Slovenian Democracy".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prebold.sds.si/news/27114 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120317061343/http://www.prebold.sds.si/news/27114 |date=March 17, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, he was posthumously awarded the [[Order of Distinct Merits of Slovenia]]. In 2007, the Government of Slovenia named the main international airport in Slovenia, the [[Ljubljana Jože Pučnik Airport]], after him. The decision was criticized by some,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Nanosplet.com |url=http://www.gorenjskiglas.si/novice/politika/index.php?action=clanek&amp;id=8103 |title=Gorenjski glas &amp;#124; Politika &amp;#124; Letališče Jožeta Pučnika |publisher=Gorenjskiglas.si |date= |accessdate=2011-12-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315145119/http://www.gorenjskiglas.si/novice/politika/index.php?action=clanek&amp;id=8103 |archivedate=2012-03-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; including the then President of Slovenia [[Janez Drnovšek]] who publicly expressed his respect for Pučnik, but disagreed with the renaming of the airport after him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=28.12.2011 |url=http://www.mladina.si/tednik/200728/clanek/slo--ikone-jure_trampus/ |title=Miti in legende nove oblasti |publisher=Mladina.Si |date= |accessdate=2011-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Author and journalist [[Spomenka Hribar]], Pučnik's former colleague, stated that Pučnik would not have agreed with such renaming, because he was a modest person who disliked public praise and rejected any "[[cult of personality]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Tekst: Miran Šubic |url=http://moj.dnevnik.si/novice/slovenija/250488 |title=Vlada samovoljno spremenila ime osrednjega letališča &amp;#124; Dnevnik |publisher=Moj.dnevnik.si |date= |accessdate=2011-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar statement was made by Pučnik's son Gorazd, who however did not oppose the renaming and was present at the renaming ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://24ur.com/novice/slovenija/novo-ime-in-nov-terminal_comment_p11_a164.html?&amp;page=11&amp;p_all_items=164 |title=Novo ime in nov terminal |publisher=24ur.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Slovenian [[liberal conservative]] [[think tank]] [[Jože Pučnik Institute]] and the elementary school in his native Črešnjevec are also named after him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filternet.si/os/sole/osnovna-sola-dr-jozeta-pucnika-cresnjevec/355/mnenja |title=Osnovna šola dr.

At the initiative of [[Milan Zver]], the [[European Parliament]] announced on 11 June 2018 that a conference room will bear the name of Jože Pučnik.&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Zver: Ponosen, da ena vidnejših dvoran v EP zdaj nosi ime po dr. Jožetu Pučniku: http://www.eppgroup.eu/press-release/Dvorana-v-EP-poimenovana-po-dr.-Jožetu-Pučniku&lt;/ref&gt;
The official inauguration took place on 28 June 2018 in Brussels, where [[President of the European Parliament]] [[Antonio Tajani]], Chairman of the [[European People's Party group|EPP Group in the European Parliament]] [[Manfred Weber]], [[President of Slovenia]] [[Borut Pahor]], President of [[Slovenian Democratic Party]] [[Janez Janša]] and initiator [[Milan Zver]] were among the honorary speakers. Family of Jože Pučnik was present at the inauguration as well. &lt;ref&gt;Dr. Zver: Dr. Jože Pučnik sedaj domuje tudi v Evropskem parlamentu:http://www.eppgroup.eu/sl/press-release/Dr%3A-Zver%3A-Dr.-Jo%C5%BEe-Pu%C4%8Dnik-sedaj-domuje-tudi-v-EP&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
Jože Pučnik was the brother of [[Ivan Pučnik]], a farmer and politician, who was initially member of the Communist Party and later also became a dissident and co-founder of the [[Slovenian Peasant Union]] in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Tekst: (sta) |url=http://www.dnevnik.si/novice/slovenija/1042227770 |title=Umrl je Ivan Pučnik, eden od ustanoviteljev SLS &amp;#124; Dnevnik |publisher=Dnevnik.si |date= |accessdate=2011-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Jože Pučnik was married twice. After his first release from jail in 1963, he met [[Irena Žerjal]], a young Slovene author from [[Trieste]], [[Italy]], who studied Slavic [[philology]] in [[Ljubljana]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://nl.ijs.si/fedora/get/sbl:4924/VIEW/ Slovene Biographical Lexicon]&lt;/ref&gt; They married the same year, when Pučnik was already imprisoned again; Pučnik was not allowed to attend his own wedding, and his brother Ivan had to represent him at the ceremony instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sites.google.com/site/tinomamic/gorazdpu%C4%8Dnik |title=gorazdpučnik - tinomamic |publisher=Sites.google.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; His first son was born in 1964. When Pučnik was released from prison in 1966, the family moved to Germany; in 1969, however, the wife decided to return to Trieste with the son, while Pučnik decided to stay in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.siol.net/novice/slovenija/2014/01/joze_pucnik.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; He later married Christel Kunath. They had a daughter named Katharina. He also adopted his second wife's son, called Marcus.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.siol.net/novice/slovenija/2014/01/joze_pucnik.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

His son from his first marriage, Gorazd Pučnik, is the director of the Srečko Kosovel Boarding School in Trieste, Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=28.12.2011 |url=http://www.mladina.si/tednik/200906/gorazd_pucnik |title=Gorazd Pučnik |publisher=Mladina.Si |date= |accessdate=2011-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; His stepson Marcus Pucnik is a journalist, based in [[Barcelona]], Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cronicaglobal.com/es/autores/marcus-pucnik-026 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-06-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140804114850/http://www.cronicaglobal.com/es/autores/marcus-pucnik-026 |archivedate=2014-08-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Born to José Manuel Jimenes Domínguez (son of [[Juan Isidro Jimenes Pereyra]] and María Josefa de los Santos Domínguez Gómez) and María Filomena Grullón Ricardo. Jimenes completed his primary and secondary education in [[Santo Domingo]], where he received a Bachelor of Arts. He then entered the Faculty of Law at the University of Santo Domingo, but his passion for philosophy made him abandon this  course. Pressured by his family, he left for Paris (1923) to study medicine. In 1929 he received his medical degree and returned to Santo Domingo the following year.

In 1934, Jimenes was discovered plotting against the dictator [[Rafael Leonidas Trujillo]] and was imprisoned and then exiled in 1935. He lived in Puerto Rico, Venezuela, the United States and [[Cuba]] where he remained in exile for twenty-six years while he continued to fight the tyranny of Trujillo. In 1941 while still in Cuba, he and other Dominican exiles on the island, founded the [[Dominican Revolutionary Party]] and the Dominican Patriotic Alliance. He participated in the failed expedition of Constanza, Maimon and Estero Hondo in 1959. Six months after Trujillo's assassination he returned to his country and immediately integrated plunged into national policy. In 1962, Jimenes was a candidate for the Presidency with the Social Democratic Alliance party.

He also taught history and sociology at the Autonomous University of Santo Domingo. He published twenty books in the fields of sociology, philosophy, history and literature. His works include the Dominican Republic: a fiction, Pedro Henríquez Ureña : Reality and Myth, Our fake left and the myth of the founding fathers, polemicist and reflect the rebellious spirit that characterized most of his essays production.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8834">'''Logical truth''' is one of the most fundamental [[concept]]s in [[logic]], and there are different theories on its nature. A logical truth is a [[Statement (logic)|statement]] which is [[truth|true]], and remains true under all [[interpretation (logic)|reinterpretations]] of its components other than its [[logical constant]]s. It is a type of [[Analytic–synthetic distinction|analytic statement]]. All of [[philosophical logic]] can be thought of as providing accounts of the nature of logical truth, as well as [[logical consequence]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Willard Van Orman Quine|Quine, Willard Van Orman]], ''Philosophy of logic''&lt;/ref&gt;

Logical truths (including [[Tautology (logic)|tautologies]]) are truths which are considered to be '''necessarily true'''. This is to say that they are considered to be such that they could not be untrue and no situation could arise which would cause us to reject a logical truth.  It must be true in every sense of intuition, practices, and bodies of beliefs. However, it is not universally agreed that there are any statements which are ''necessarily'' true.

A logical truth is considered by some philosophers to be a statement which is true in all [[possible world]]s. This is contrasted with [[fact]]s (which may also be referred to as ''contingent claims'' or ''synthetic claims'') which are true in ''this'' world, as it has historically unfolded, but which is not true in at least one possible world, as it might have unfolded. The [[proposition]] "If p and q, then p" and the proposition "All married people are married" are logical truths because they are true due to their inherent structure and not because of any facts of the world. 
Later, with the rise of formal logic a logical truth was considered to be a statement which is true under all possible interpretations.

The existence of logical truths has been put forward by [[rationalist]] philosophers as an objection to [[empiricism]] because they hold that it is impossible to account for our [[knowledge]] of logical truths on empiricist grounds. Empiricists commonly respond to this objection by arguing that logical truths (which they usually deem to be mere tautologies), are analytic and thus do not purport to describe the world.

== Logical truths and analytic truths ==
{{Main|Analytic–synthetic distinction}}

Logical truths, being analytic statements, do not contain any information about any matters of [[fact]]. Other than logical truths, there is also a second class of analytic statements, typified by "no bachelor is married". The characteristic of such a statement is that it can be turned into a logical truth by substituting synonyms for synonyms ''[[salva veritate]]''. "No bachelor is married" can be turned into "no unmarried man is married" by substituting "unmarried man" for its synonym "bachelor".

In his essay [[Two Dogmas of Empiricism]], the philosopher [[Willard Van Orman Quine|W. V. O. Quine]] called into question the distinction between analytic and synthetic statements. It was this second class of analytic statements that caused him to note that the concept of analyticity itself stands in need of clarification, because it seems to depend on the concept of [[synonym]]y, which stands in need of clarification. In his conclusion, Quine rejects that logical truths are necessary truths. Instead he posits that the truth-value of any statement can be changed, including logical truths, given a re-evaluation of the truth-values of every other statement in one's complete theory.

== Truth values and tautologies ==
{{Main|Tautology (logic)}}

Considering different [[interpretation (logic)|interpretations]] of the same statement leads to the notion of [[truth value]]. The simplest approach to truth values means that the statement may be "true" in one case, but [[false (logic)|"false"]]&lt;!-- not yet an article, but ought to be.  please, do not remove the link --&gt; in another. In one sense of the term "tautology", it is any type of [[well-formed formula|formula]] or [[proposition]] which turns out to be true under any possible interpretation of its terms (may also be called a [[Valuation (logic)|valuation]] or assignment depending upon the context). This is synonymous to logical truth.

However, the term "tautology" is also commonly used to refer to what could more specifically be called [[Truth function|truth-functional]] tautologies. Whereas a tautology or logical truth is true solely because of the logical terms it contains in general (e.g. "[[Universal quantification|every]]", "[[Existential quantification|some]]", and "is"), a truth-functional tautology is true because of the logical terms it contains which are [[logical connective]]s (e.g. "[[logical disjunction|or]]", "[[logical conjunction|and]]", and "[[joint denial|nor]]"). Not all logical truths are tautologies of such a kind.

== Logical truth and logical constants ==
{{Main|Logical constant}}

Logical constants, including [[logical connective]]s and [[Quantifier (logic)|quantifiers]], can all be reduced conceptually to logical truth. For instance, two statements or more are [[Logical NAND|logically incompatible]] ''[[if and only if|if, and only if]]'' their [[Logical conjunction|conjunction]] is logically false. One statement [[Logical implication|logically implies]] another when it is logically incompatible with the [[negation]] of the other. A statement is logically true if, and only if its opposite is logically false.  The opposite statements must contradict one another.  In this way all logical connectives can be expressed in terms of preserving logical truth.  The logical form of a sentence is determined by its semantic or syntactic structure and by the placement of logical constants.  Logical constants determine whether a statement is a logical truth when they are combined with a language that limits its meaning.  Therefore, until it is determined how to make a distinction between all logical constants regardless of their language, it is impossible to know the complete truth of a statement or argument.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logical-constants/|title=Logical Constants|last=MacFarlane|first=J.|date=May 16, 2005|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Logical truth and rules of inference ==

The concept of logical truth is closely connected to the concept of a [[rule of inference]].&lt;ref&gt;[[A. J. Ayer|Alfred Ayer]], ''[[Language, Truth, and Logic]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Logical truth and logical positivism ==

[[Logical positivism]] was a movement in the 20th century and was followed to a great extent in Europe and the United States.  It is a structured method of determining how valid the knowledge is.  It introduced mathematics and the natural sciences into the field of philosophy.  It is also known as scientific empiricism.  Logical positivism considers philosophy as an analytical inquiry. Philosophy was deciphered as an activity rather than a theory.  Logical positivists worked to explain the language of science by showing that scientific theories could be broken down to logical truths along with the experience of the five senses.  The concepts created in this movement are very closely followed today in the West. Logical positivism was a way to decipher whether a statement was truly a logical truth by means of relating it to a scientific theory or mathematics.  It determined the validity of the statement as well as gave it the rank of a logical truth or a false truth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|year=2016|title=Logical Positivism|url=|journal=Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Non-classical logics ==

{{Main|Non-classical logic}}

Non-classical logic is the name given to [[formal system]]s which differ in a significant way from standard logical systems such as [[Propositional logic|propositional]] and [[predicate logic]]. There are several ways in which this is done, including by way of extensions, deviations, and variations. The aim of these departures is to make it possible to construct different models of [[logical consequence]] and logical truth.&lt;ref&gt;[[Theodore Sider]], ''Logic for philosophy''&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16895">The '''Merton thesis''' is an argument about the nature of early [[experimental science]] proposed by [[Robert K. Merton]]. Similar to [[Max Weber]]'s [[The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism|famous claim]] on the link between [[Protestant work ethic]] and the [[capitalist economy]], Merton argued for a similar positive [[correlation]] between the rise of [[Protestant]] [[Pietism]] and early experimental science.&lt;ref name=sztompka2003&gt;Sztompka, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; The Merton thesis has resulted in continuous debates.&lt;ref name=cohen1990&gt;Cohen, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

Although scholars are still debating it, Merton's 1936 [[doctoral dissertation]] (and two years later his first monograph by the same title) ''Science, Technology and Society in 17th-Century England'' raised important issues on the connections between religion and the rise of modern science, became a significant work in the realm of the [[sociology of science]] and continues to be cited in new scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.columbia.edu/cu/record/archives/vol20/vol20_iss2/record2002.13.html Merton Awarded Nation's Highest Science Honor&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Merton further developed this thesis in other publications.

==Thesis==

The Merton thesis has two separate parts: firstly, it presents a theory that science changes due to an accumulation of observations and improvement in experimental technique and [[methodology]]; secondly, it puts forward the argument that the popularity of science in [[England]] in the 17th century, and the religious [[demography]] of the [[Royal Society]] (English scientists of that time were predominantly [[Puritans]] or other [[Protestants]]) can be explained by a [[correlation]] between Protestantism and the scientific values.&lt;ref name=gregory1998&gt;Gregory, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

Merton focuses on English Puritanism and [[Spener|German Pietism]] as being responsible for the development of the [[scientific revolution]] of the 17th and 18th centuries. He explains that the connection between [[religious affiliation]] and interest in science is a result of a significant synergy between the [[ascetic]] Protestant values and those of modern science.&lt;ref name=becker1992&gt;Becker, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; Protestant values encouraged scientific research by allowing science to identify [[God|God's]] influence on the world and thus providing religious justification for scientific research.&lt;ref name=sztompka2003/&gt;

==Criticism==

The first part of Merton's thesis has been criticized for insufficient consideration of the roles of [[mathematics]] and the [[Mechanism (philosophy)|mechanical philosophy]] in the scientific revolution. The second part has been criticized for the difficulty involved in defining who counts as a Protestant of the "right type" without making arbitrary distinctions. It is also criticized for failing to explain why non-Protestants do science (consider the [[List of Catholic scientists|Catholics]] [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernicus]], [[Leonardo da Vinci|da Vinci]], [[René Descartes|Descartes]], or [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]]) and conversely why Protestants of the "right type" are not all interested in science.&lt;ref name=gregory1998/&gt;&lt;ref name=ferngren&gt;Ferngen, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=porter1992&gt;Porter &amp; Teich 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

Merton, acknowledging the criticism, replied that the Puritan ethos was not necessary, although it did facilitate development of science.&lt;ref&gt;Heddendorf, 1986]&lt;/ref&gt; He also noted that when science had acquired institutional legitimacy, it no longer needed religion, eventually becoming a counterforce, leading to religious decline. Nonetheless, early on, in Merton's view religion was a major factor that allowed the  scientific revolution to occur.&lt;ref name=sztompka2003 /&gt; While the Merton thesis does not explain all the causes of the scientific revolution, it does illuminate possible reasons why England was one of its driving motors and the structure of the English scientific community.&lt;ref name=cohen1994&gt;Cohen, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

==Support==

In 1958, American sociologist [[Gerhard Lenski]]'s empirical inquiry into ''The Religious Factor: A Sociological Study of Religion's Impact on Politics, Economics, and Family Life'' in the [[Detroit]] area (Michigan) revealed, among other insights, that there were significant differences between [[Roman Catholic church|Catholics]] on the one hand and [[White Anglo-Saxon Protestant|(white) Protestants]] and [[Jews]] on the other hand with regard to economics and the sciences. Lenski's data supported the basic hypotheses of [[Max Weber]]'s work ''The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism''. According to Lenski, the "contributions of Protestantism to material progress have been largely unintended by-products of certain distinctive Protestant traits. This was a central point in Weber's theory." Lenski noted that more than a hundred years prior to Weber, [[John Wesley]], one of the founders of the [[Methodist church]], had observed that "diligence and frugality" made Methodists wealthy. "In an early era, Protestant [[asceticism]] and dedication to work, as noted both by Wesley and Weber, seem to have been important patterns of action contributing to economic progress." However, Lenski said, asceticism was rare among modern Protestants, and the distinctive Protestant doctrine of "the calling" was largely forgotten. Instead, modern (white) Protestants and Jews had a high degree of "intellectual autonomy" that facilitated scientific and technical advance.&lt;ref&gt;Gerhard Lenski (1963), ''The Religious Factor: A Sociological Study of Religion's Impact on Politics, Economics, and Family Life'', Revised Edition, Garden City, N.Y., pp. 350-352&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, Lenski pointed out, Catholics developed an intellectual orientation which valued "obedience" to the teachings of their church above intellectual autonomy, which made them less inclined to enter scientific careers. Catholic sociologists&lt;ref&gt;Thomas F. O'Dea (1958), ''The Catholic Dilemma: An Inquiry into the Intellectual Life'', New York, N.Y.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frank L. Christ and Gerard Sherry (Eds.) (1961), ''American Catholicism and the Intellectual Ideal'', New York, N.Y.&lt;/ref&gt; had come to the same conclusions.&lt;ref&gt;Gerhard Lenski, ''The Religious Factor'', pp. 283-284&lt;/ref&gt;

Lenski traced these differences back to the [[Reformation]] and the Catholic church's reaction to it. In Lenski's view, the Reformation encouraged intellectual autonomy among Protestants, in particular the [[Anabaptists]], Puritans, Pietists, Methodists, and [[Presbyterian church|Presbyterians]]. In the Middle Ages, there had been tendencies toward intellectual autonomy, as exemplified in men like [[Erasmus]]. But after the Reformation, the Catholic leaders increasingly identified these tendencies with Protestantism and [[heresy]] and demanded that Catholics be obedient and faithful to ecclesiastical discipline. In Lenski's opinion, his study showed that these differences between Protestants and Catholics survived to the present day. As a consequence, "none of the predominantly and devoutly Catholic nations in the modern world can be classified as a ''leading'' industrial nation. Some Catholic nations – such as [[France]], [[Italy]], [[Argentina]], [[Brazil]], and [[Chile]] – are quite highly industrialized, but none of them are leaders in the technological and scientific fields, nor do they seem likely to become so. Recently [1963] some Brazilian Catholic social scientists compared their country's progress with that of the United States and concluded that the chief factor responsible for the differential rates of development is the religious heritage of the two nations."&lt;ref&gt;Gerhard Lenski, ''The Religious Factor'', pp. 347-349&lt;/ref&gt;

Puritans and Pietists both contributed to intellectual autonomy and provided intellectual tools and values important for science.&lt;ref name="gregory19982"&gt;Gregory, Andrew (1998). handouts for course 'The Scientific Revolution' at The [[Scientific Revolution]], [http://www.ucl.ac.uk/sts/gregory/215/handouts/h14_srel.doc doc file online] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060513160014/http://www.ucl.ac.uk/sts/gregory/215/handouts/h14_srel.doc |date=2006-05-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As an example, pietism challenged the orthodoxy via new media and formats: Periodical journals gained importance versus the former pasquills and single thesis, traditional [[disputation]] was replaced by competitive debating, which tried to gain new knowledge instead of defending orthodox scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Gierl, [[Pietismus und Aufklärung: theologische Polemik und die Kommunikationsreform der Wissenschaft am Ende des 17. Jahrhunderts]], Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht, 1997 (Pietism and enlightenment, theological polemic and the reform of science communication end of the 17. century).&lt;/ref&gt; It is a part of the forces that lead to modernity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=40wB2kGLm28C|title=An Introduction to German Pietism: Protestant Renewal at the Dawn of Modern Europe|last=Shantz|first=Douglas H.|last2=Erb|first2=Peter C.|date=2013-03-05|publisher=JHU Press|isbn=9781421408309|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''Scientific Elite: Nobel Laureates in the United States'' by [[Harriet Zuckerman]], a review of American Nobel prizes awarded between 1901 and 1972, 72% of American [[Nobel Prizes|Nobel Prize]] laureates identified a [[Protestant]] background.&lt;ref name="Scientific Elite: Nobel Laureates in the United Statesh"&gt;[[Harriet Zuckerman]], ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=HAHCzJfmD5IC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Scientific+Elite:+Nobel+Laureates+in+the+United+States&amp;hl=iw&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCYQ6AEwAGoVChMIxKistOqUxwIVzNUUCh0pGgC-#v=onepage&amp;q=Scientific%20Elite%3A%20Nobel%20Laureates%20in%20the%20United%20States&amp;f=false Scientific Elite: Nobel Laureates in the United States]'' New York, The Free Pres, 1977 , p.68: Protestants turn up among the American-reared laureates in slightly greater proportion to their numbers in the general population. Thus 72 percent of the seventy-one laureates but about two thirds of the American population were reared in one or another Protestant denomination-)&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, 84.2% of all the Nobel Prizes awarded to Americans in [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry|Chemistry]],&lt;ref name="Scientific Elite: Nobel Laureates in the United Statesh"/&gt; 60% in [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine|Medicine]],&lt;ref name="Scientific Elite: Nobel Laureates in the United Statesh"/&gt; and 58.6% in [[Nobel Prize in Physics|Physics]]&lt;ref name="Scientific Elite: Nobel Laureates in the United Statesh"/&gt; between 1901 and 1972 were won by Protestants.

According to ''100 Years of Nobel Prize (2005)'', a review of Nobel prizes awarded between 1901 and 2000, 65.4% of [[Nobel Prizes|Nobel Prize]] Laureates, [[List of Christian Nobel laureates|have identified Christianity]] in its various forms as their religious preference (423 prizes).&lt;ref name="Nobel prize"&gt;Baruch A. Shalev, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=3jrbmL-DgZQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=100+Years+of+Nobel+Prizes&amp;hl=iw&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAGoVChMIt8rKpZH6xgIVRVgUCh0Y1Qi9#v=onepage&amp;q=100%20Years%20of%20Nobel%20Prizes&amp;f=false 100 Years of Nobel Prizes]'' (2003),Atlantic Publishers &amp; Distributors , p.57: between 1901 and 2000 reveals that 654 Laureates belong to 28 different religion Most 65.4% have identified Christianity in its various forms as their religious preference.
While separating Roman Catholic from Protestants among Christians proved difficult in some cases, available information suggests that more Protestants were involved in the scientific categories and more Catholics were involved in the Literature and Peace categories.
Atheists, agnostics, and freethinkers comprise 10.5% of total Nobel Prize winners; but in the category of Literature, these preferences rise sharply to about 35%. A striking fact involving religion is the high number of Laureates of the Jewish faith – over 20% of total Nobel Prizes (138); including: 17% in Chemistry, 26% in Medicine and Physics, 40% in Economics and 11% in Peace and Literature each. The numbers are especially startling in light of the fact that only some 14 million people (0.02% of the world's population) are Jewish. By contrast, only 5 Nobel Laureates have been of the Muslim faith-0.8% of total number of Nobel prizes awarded – from a population base of about 1.2 billion (20% of the world's population).&lt;/ref&gt;  While 32% of Nobel prize winners have identified with Protestantism in its various forms (208 prizes),&lt;ref name="Nobel prize"/&gt; Protestants comprise 11.6–13% of the world's population but most{{how many|date=January 2018}} of those selecting the prize winners{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2454">The '''Nordic sexual morality debate''' (Danish: ''sædelighedsfejden'', Swedish: ''sedlighetsdebatten'', Norwegian: ''sedelighetsdebatten'') was the name for a cultural movement and public debate in [[Scandinavia]] in the 1880s, where sexuality and sexual morals were discussed in newspapers, magazines, books and theatrical plays.

The topic was criticism of the contemporary sexual [[double standard]]s, in which it was socially acceptable for men to have premarital sexual experience, while women were expected to be virgins, and the contemporary view on prostitution, which was sanctioned as a "necessary evil" because of this double standard, an issue that had been raised by [[Svenska Federationen]] in 1878.  

The debate was divided in two sides: the moderate one, where [[Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson]] was the most known representative, wished to solve this double standard by demanding that men also be virgins on their wedding night, as women were. The radical one, where [[Edvard Brandes]] and [[Georg Brandes]] were the most known representatives, demanded that women be free to enjoy a sexual life prior to marriage, as men were.

[[Getting Married (collection)|''Getting Married'' (collection)]] by [[August Strindberg]] and the legal court case that surrounded it was one of the perhaps most known incidents during the debate. It also caused a debate within the literary world whether literature should touch these questions at all. Other well-known works in the debate are [[Henrik Ibsen]]'s play ''A Doll's House'' (Et Dukkehjem), the novel ''Money'' (Pengar) by [[Viktoria Benedictsson]], and the novel ''Pyrhussegrar'' by [[Stella Kleve]].

'''''Pacem in terris''''' ({{lit|''Peace on Earth''}}) was a papal [[encyclical]] issued by [[Pope John XXIII]] on 11 April 1963 on the rights and obligations of individuals and of the state, as well as the proper relations between states. It emphasized [[human dignity]] and [[Human equality|equality among all people]], and made mention of issues such as the [[rights of women]], [[nuclear non-proliferation]], and the [[United Nations]], all of which it endorsed. It was the last encyclical drafted by John XXIII, who had been diagnosed with [[cancer]] in September 1962 and died two months after the encyclical's completion. Biographer [[Peter Hebblethwaite]] called it Pope John's "last will and testament".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hebblethwaite |first=Peter |authorlink=Peter Hebblethwaite |title=John XXIII: Pope of the Century |url=https://books.google.com/books?&amp;id=j0UdCgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover |location=London |publisher=[[Bloomsbury Publishing]] |year=2010 |origyear=[https://books.google.com/books?id=2SnZAAAAMAAJ 1st ed: ''John XXIII: Pope of the Council'' (1984)] |pages=[https://books.google.comt/books?&amp;id=j0UdCgAAQBAJ&amp;q=+%22last+will+and+testament%22 4, 214, 232, 240, 241−251] |edition=abridged, revised, and retitled |id={{ISBN|1-44118413-9}} |ISBN=978-1-441-18413-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Published on [[Holy Thursday]], the Pope called it his "Easter gift".

Due to her importance and popularity, ''Pacem in Terris'' is deposited at the UN archives.

==Title==
The full title of the encyclical is ''On Establishing Universal Peace in Truth, Justice, Charity and Liberty''. The short title ''Pacem in terris'' is derived from the [[incipit|opening words]] of the encyclical, as is customary with papal documents:
{{Social teachings of the popes}}
:''Pacem in terris, quam homines universi cupidissime quovis tempore appetiverunt, condi confirmarique non posse constat, nisi ordine, quem Deus constituit, sancte servato."''
:("Peace on earth, for which all men of every era have most eagerly yearned, cannot be firmly established unless the order which God laid down is dutifully observed.")

==History==
[[Image:Stamps of Germany (BRD) 1969, MiNr 609.jpg|thumb|German Stamp 1969]]
''Pacem in terris'' was the first encyclical that a pope addressed to "all men of good will", rather than only to [[Catholic]]s, quote of the praise to God said by the heavenly army above the manger of Bethlehem ([[Latin]] [[Vulgate]]: ''in terra pax in hominibus bonae voluntatis'', [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] {{bibleref2-nb|Luke|2:14|VULGATE}}; English translation: {{bibleref2-nb|Luke|2:13-14|DRA;WYC;TLV}}).&lt;ref&gt;Other translations did not follow the Latin version or, as in the case of the [[Italian Episcopal Conference|CEI]], have stopped following it with the 1973 revised edition of the [[Jerusalem Bible]]: compare the [http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:w2.vatican.va/content/john-xxiii/it/encyclicals/documents/hf_j-xxiii_enc_11041963_pacem.html+A+TUTTI+GLI+UOMINI+%22DI+BUONA+VOLONTÀ%22 Italian text of the encyclical's address] and the [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luca+2%3A14&amp;version=CEI different translation subsequently introduced by the Italian bishops].&lt;/ref&gt; Learned Hand Professor of Law at Harvard Law School, [[Mary Ann Glendon]], interprets this to mean "He was insisting that the responsibility for setting conditions for peace does not just belong to the great and powerful of the world—it belongs to each and every one of us."&lt;ref name=Ziegler&gt;[http://www.catholicworldreport.com/Item/2329/iPacem_in_Terrisi_at_50.aspx Ziegler, J.J., "Pacem in Terris at 50", ''The Catholic World Report'', June 14, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; In theological terms, it marked a major shift in papal teaching from reliance on classical scholastic categories of natural law to a more inductive approach based on the signs of the times.&lt;ref name=Filteau/&gt;

In this work, John XXIII reacted to the political situation in the middle of the [[Cold War]]. Coming just months after the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis, during which the Vatican served as an intermediary between the White House and the Kremlin,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mncc.org/of-popes-presidents-and-peace/ Adkins, Jason. "Catholic Spirit: Of Popes, Presidents and Peace", Minnesota Catholic Conference, April 26, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; the document also reflected the Pope's experience of 1960 in trying to resolve difficulties arising out the four-power occupation of Berlin. The "peace encyclical" was issued only two years after the erection of the [[Berlin Wall]]. It also draws on Pope John's reading of [[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine]]{{'}}s ''[[The City of God]]'' and [[Thomas Aquinas]]' view of Eternal Law.&lt;ref name=Hittinger&gt;[http://www.pass.va/content/dam/scienzesociali/pdf/acta18/acta18-hittinger.pdf Hittinger, Russell. "Quinquagesimo Ante: Reflections on Pacem in Terris Fifty Years Later", ''The Global Quest for Tranquillitas Ordinis. Pacem in Terris, Fifty Years Later Pontifical Academy of Social Sciences, Acta 18, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; In this it echoes the Gospel’s core values and principles of patristic and medieval thought, while reflecting the historical period in which it was written.&lt;ref name=Sanchez&gt;[http://www.pass.va/content/dam/scienzesociali/pdf/acta18/acta18-sanchez.pdf Sanchez Sorondo, Marcelo. "The Magnitude of 'Walking in the Truth' (3 Jn 1)", ''The Global Quest for Tranquillitas Ordinis. Pacem in Terris, Fifty Years Later Pontifical Academy of Social Sciences, Acta 18, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

Sociologist Monsignor [[Pietro Pavan]] and a small group of theologians helped draft it.&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, Francis X., "Cardinal Pietro Pavan: inveterate optimist", ''America'', February 1996&lt;/ref&gt; In Pavan’s view ''Pacem in terris'' would present the teachings of [[Pope Leo XIII|Leo XIII]] on the eternal law, "in light of the changing tides of history, and allow them to resonate with a much wider audience".&lt;ref name=Hittinger/&gt;

The Pope explains in this encyclical that conflicts "should not be resolved by recourse to arms, but rather by negotiation". He further emphasizes the importance of respect of [[human rights]] as an essential consequence of the [[Christian]] understanding of men and [[nuclear disarmament]]. He clearly establishes "...That every man has the [[right to life]], to [[bodily integrity]], and to the means which are suitable for the proper development of life..."

''Pacem in terris'' is an extended reflection on the moral order. The document is divided into four sections.
*The first section of the encyclical establishes the relationship between individuals and humankind, encompassing the issues of human rights and moral duties. 
*The second section addresses the relationship between man and state, dwelling on the collective authority of the latter. 
*The third section establishes the need for equality amongst nations and the need for the state to be subject to rights and duties that the individual must abide by.
*The final section presents the need for greater relations between nations, thus resulting in collective states assisting other states. The encyclical ends with the urging of Catholics to assist non-Christians and non-Catholics in political and social aspects.

==Reception==
“Pacem in Terris was more than an encyclical—it was an event," recalls Glendon.&lt;ref name=Ziegler/&gt;
''Pacem in Terris'' was the first papal encyclical published in its entirety in the ''New York Times''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.georgetown.edu/pacem-in-terris-Mannion/document/1242786616642/Mannion-Pacem+in+Terris+at+50.pdf Mannion, Gerard. "Pacem in Terris@50: Gifts Old and New for Church and Society in Recent Times", Pacem in Terris Conference 2013, Georgetown University]{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Washington Post'' said, "''Pacem in terris'' is not just the voice of an old priest, nor just that of an ancient Church; it is the voice of the conscience of the world.” &lt;ref name=Ziegler/&gt; Two years later, it was the subject of a conference at the United Nations attended by over 2,000 statespersons and scholars.&lt;ref name=Ziegler/&gt;

==Legacy==
[[Russell Hittinger|F. Russell Hittinger]] describes the encyclical "as a kind of magna carta of the Catholic Church’s position on human rights and natural law".&lt;ref name=Hittinger/&gt; Pope John XXIII's 1963 encyclical ''Pacem in terris'' ("Peace on Earth") radically affected Catholic social teaching not only on war and peace, but on church-state relations, women's rights, religious freedom, international relations and other major issues. Fr. J. Bryan Hehir, called ''Pacem in terris'' "a pivotal text in [papal] encyclical history" that played a major role in the development of the Second Vatican Council's Declaration on Religious Freedom and its Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World, and on Pope John Paul II's encyclical ''[[Centesimus annus]]'' ("The Hundredth Year"), which marked the centennial of Pope Leo XIII's 1891 encyclical on labor, [[Rerum Novarum]].&lt;ref name=Filteau&gt;[http://ncronline.org/news/theology/experts-pacem-terris-had-radical-impact-church-teaching Filteau, Jerry. "Experts: 'Pacem in Terris' had radical impact on church teaching", ''National Catholic Reporter'', Apr. 18, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; It also influenced the 1965 ''Declaration on Religious Freedom'' ([[Dignitatis humanae]]).&lt;ref name=Filteau/&gt;

In commemoration of this encyclical, the annual ''[[Pacem in Terris Award|Pacem in Terris Peace and Freedom award]]'' was instituted in 1964, first by the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Davenport]] and later by the ''[[Quad Cities]] Pacem in Terris Coalition''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Pacem In Terris |url=http://www.davenportdiocese.org/socialaction/sapaceminterris.htm |publisher=Diocese of Davenport |accessdate=June 1, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512050739/http://www.davenportdiocese.org/socialaction/sapaceminterris.htm |archivedate=May 12, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dear"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.catholicmessenger.org/articles/2010/05/19/news/doc4bf40e0730eea126578341.txt |title=Peace activist Fr.

'''Prudence''' ({{lang-la|prudentia}}, [[Contraction (grammar)|contracted]] from {{lang|la|providentia}} meaning "seeing ahead, sagacity") is the ability to govern and discipline oneself by the use of [[reason]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/prudence Prudence - Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary]. Merriam-webster.com (2012-08-31). Retrieved on 2013-07-19.&lt;/ref&gt; It is classically considered to be a [[virtue]], and in particular one of the four [[Cardinal virtues]] (which are, with the three [[theological virtues]], part of the [[seven virtues]]). '''Prudentia''' is an allegorical female personification of the virtue, whose attributes are a mirror and snake, who is frequently depicted as a pair with [[Justitia]], the Roman goddess of Justice.

The word derives from the 14th-century [[Old French]] word ''prudence'', which, in turn, derives from the Latin ''prudentia'' meaning "foresight, sagacity". It is often associated with [[wisdom]], [[insight]], and [[knowledge]].  In this case, the virtue is the ability to judge between virtuous and vicious actions, not only in a general sense, but with regard to appropriate actions at a given time and place. Although prudence itself does not perform any actions, and is concerned solely with knowledge, all virtues had to be regulated by it. Distinguishing when acts are [[courage]]ous, as opposed to [[Recklessness (psychology)|reckless]] or [[Cowardice|cowardly]], is an act of prudence, and for this reason it is classified as a cardinal (pivotal) virtue.

In modern [[English language|English]], the word has become increasingly [[synonym]]ous with cautiousness.  In this sense, prudence names a reluctance to take risks, which remains a virtue with respect to unnecessary risks, but, when unreasonably extended into over-cautiousness, can become the [[vice]] of cowardice.

In the ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'', [[Aristotle]] gives a lengthy account of the virtue [[phronesis]] ({{lang-grc|ϕρόνησις}}), traditionally translated as "prudence", although this has become increasingly problematic as the word has fallen out of common usage.  More recently ϕρόνησις has been translated by such terms as "[[Phronesis|practical wisdom]]", "practical judgment" or "rational choice".

== As the "mother" of all virtues ==
[[File:DSCN2047.JPG|thumb|Allegory of Prudence on the [[tomb of Francis II, Duke of Brittany]] The female face depicts Francis' daughter [[Anne of Brittany]].]]

Prudence was considered by the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] and later on by [[Christian philosophy|Christian philosophers]], most notably [[Thomas Aquinas]], as the cause, measure and form of all virtues. It is considered to be the ''auriga virtutum'' or the charioteer of the virtues.

It is the cause in the sense that the virtues, which are defined to be the "perfected ability" of man as a spiritual person (spiritual personhood in the classical western understanding means having [[intelligence]] and [[free will]]), achieve their "perfection" only when they are founded upon prudence, that is to say upon the perfected ability to make right decisions. For instance, a person can live [[Temperance (virtue)|temperance]] when he has acquired the habit of deciding correctly the actions to take in response to his instinctual cravings.

Its function is to point out which course of action is to be taken in any concrete circumstances. It has nothing to do with directly willing the good it discerns. Prudence has a directive capacity with regard to the other virtues. It lights the way and measures the arena for their exercise. Without prudence, bravery becomes foolhardiness; mercy sinks into weakness, and temperance into fanaticism. Its office is to determine for each in practice those circumstances of time, place, manner, etc. which should be observed, and which the Scholastics comprise under the term "medium rationis". So it is that while it qualifies the intellect and not the will, it is nevertheless rightly styled a moral virtue.&lt;ref name="delany"&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12517b.htm Delany, Joseph. "Prudence." The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 12. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1911. 2 May 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

Prudence is considered the measure of moral virtues since it provides a model of ethically good actions. "The work of art is true and real by its correspondence with the pattern of its prototype in the mind of the artist. In similar fashion, the free activity of man is good by its correspondence with the pattern of prudence." ([[Josef Pieper]]) For instance, a [[stockbroker]] using his experience and all the data available to him decides that it is beneficial to sell stock A at 2PM tomorrow and buy stock B today. The content of the decision (e.g., the stock, amount, time, and means) is the product of an act of prudence, while the actual carrying out of the decision may involve other virtues like fortitude (doing it in spite of fear of failure) and justice (doing his job well out of justice to his company and his family). The actual act's "goodness" is measured against that original decision made through prudence.&lt;ref&gt;Although Aristotle himself would have considered this way of making money contemptible: "[T]hose who ply sordid trades...and those who lend small sums and at high rates...take more than they ought and from wrong sources. What is common to them is evidently sordid love of gain...[A]ll such forms of taking are mean." (''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'' 1121b31)&lt;/ref&gt;

In Greek and Scholastic philosophy, "form" is the specific characteristic of a thing that makes it what it is. With this language, prudence confers upon other virtues the form of its inner essence; that is, its specific character as a virtue. For instance, not all acts of telling the truth are considered good, considered as done with the virtue of honesty. What makes telling the truth a virtue is whether it is done with prudence.

== Versus imprudence, cunning and false prudence ==

In Christian understanding, the difference between prudence and cunning lies in the intent with which the decision of the context of an action is made. The Christian understanding of the world includes the existence of [[God]], the [[natural law]] and [[Morality|moral]] implications of human actions. In this context, prudence is different from cunning in that it takes into account the supernatural good. For instance, the decision of persecuted Christians to be [[martyr]]ed rather than deny their faith is considered prudent. 

According to [[Thomas Aquinas]], judgments using reasons for evil ends or using evil means are considered to be made through "cunning" and "false prudence" and not through prudence.&lt;ref name="delany"/&gt; However "imprudence" was not be considered a sin since it was not voluntary.&lt;ref&gt;St Thomas Aquinas Summa Theologica, Volume 3 (Part II, Second Section) 1602065578 2013 - p 1409 "It would seem that imprudence is not a sin. For every sin is voluntary, according to Augustine;* whereas imprudence is not voluntary, since no man wishes to be imprudent. Therefore imprudence is not a sin"&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ancient Greek term for prudence is synonymous with “forethought". People, the Ancient Greeks believed, must have enough prudence to prepare for worshiping the Olympian gods.  Exceptional were the foolish Bacchic cult, who lived an emotional and passionate lifestyle. Believing the antisexual Olympian traditions to be shameful, professors of the Bacchic cult celebrated the irrationality that governed their religion.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, Bertrand. History of Western Philosophy.Routledge, 1996, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;

Prudence is the application of universal principles to particular situations.&lt;ref name="mcmanaman"&gt;[https://www.catholiceducation.org/en/education/catholic-contributions/the-virtue-of-prudence.html McManaman, Douglas. "The Virtue of Prudence", Catholic Education Resource Center]&lt;/ref&gt; "Integral parts" of virtues, in [[Scholasticism|Scholastic philosophy]], are the elements that must be present for any complete or perfect act of the virtue. The following are the integral parts of prudence:
* ''[[Memoria]]'' : accurate memory; that is, memory that is true to reality; an ability to learn from experience;&lt;ref name="mcmanaman"/&gt;
* ''Docilitas'' : an open-mindedness that recognizes variety and is able to seek and make use of the experience and authority of others;&lt;ref name="mcmanaman"/&gt;
* ''Intelligentia'' : the understanding of [[first principle]]s;
* ''Sollertia'' : shrewdness or quick-wittedness, i.e. the ability to evaluate a situation quickly;
* ''[[Ratio]]'' : Discursive reasoning and the ability to research and compare alternatives;
* ''[[Providentia]]'' : foresight&amp;nbsp;– i.e. the capacity to estimate whether particular actions can realize goals;
* ''Circumspection'' : the ability to take all relevant circumstances into account;
* ''[[:wikt:caution|Caution]]'' : the ability to mitigate risk.

== Prudential judgment ==
{{refimprove section|small=y|date=March 2016}}
[[File:Titian - Allegorie der Zeit.jpg|thumb|''[[Allegory of Prudence]]'' by [[Titian]]. To Titian, prudence was preparation, foresight and judgement from experience and human history. The three faces in the painting represent the passing of human generations, with the young facing the light while the oldest fade into shadow; the faint inscription above their heads may be translated as "From the past, the present acts prudently, lest it spoils future action".&lt;ref&gt;David Summers (1987), ''The Judgment of Sense: Renaissance Naturalism and the Rise of Aesthetics'', Cambridge University Press ({{ISBN|978-0-521-32675-9}}).&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In ethics, a "prudential judgment" is one where the circumstances must be weighed to determine the correct action.  Generally, it applies to situations where two people could weigh the circumstances differently and ''ethically'' come to different conclusions.

For instance, in the theory of [[just war]], the government of a nation must weigh whether the harms they suffer are more than the harms that would be produced by their going to war against another nation that is harming them; the decision whether to go to war is therefore a prudential judgment.

In another case, a patient who has a terminal illness with no conventional treatment may hear of an experimental treatment.  To decide whether to take it would require weighing on one hand, the cost, time, possible lack of benefit, and possible pain, disability, and hastened death, and on the other hand, the possible benefit and the benefit to others of what could be learned from his case.

== In rhetoric ==
[[File:Main_ornate_of_the_facade,_Castellania_Malta.jpeg|thumb|left|Main gate of 18th-century [[Castellania (Valletta)|Castellania]] portraying [[Lady Justice]] and [[Prudentia|Lady Prudentia]] above]]
[[Phronesis]], or practical wisdom, holds an important place in [[Rhetoric|rhetorical theory]] as a central aspect of judgment and practice. [[Aristotle]]'s notion of phronesis fits with his notes on rhetoric because neither, in his estimation, could be reduced to an ''[[episteme]]'' or a ''[[techne]]'', and both deal with the ability to deliberate about contingent, variable, or indeterminate matters.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

[[Cicero]] defined ''prudentia'' as a rhetorical norm in ''[[De Oratore]]'', ''[[De officiis]]'', ''[[De Inventione]]'', and ''[[De re publica]]''. He contrasts the term with ''imprudens'', young men failing to consider the consequences before they act. The ''prudens'', or those who had prudence, knew when to speak and when to stay silent. Cicero maintained that prudence was gained only through experience, and while it was applied in everyday conversation, in public discourse it was subordinated to the broader term for wisdom, ''sapientia''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hariman |first=Robert |title=Prudence: classical virtue, postmodern practice |publisher=The Pennsylvania State University Press |year=2003 |page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the contemporary era, rhetorical scholars have tried to recover a robust meaning for the term. They have maintained consistency with the ancient orators, contending that prudence is an embodied persuasive resource.&lt;ref name="Jasinski"&gt;{{cite book |last=Jasinski |first=James |year=2001 |title=Sourcebook on Rhetoric |publisher=Sage Publications |page=463}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although sets of principles or rules can be constructed in a particular culture, scholars agree that prudence cannot be derived from a set of timeless principles. Instead, through gauging the situation and through reasoned deliberation, a speaker should determine the set of values and morals by which to base his or her actions. Furthermore, scholars suggest the capacity to take into account the particularities of the situation as vital to prudential practice. For example, as rhetorical scholar Lois Self explains, "both rhetoric and phronesis are normative processes in that they involve rational principles of choice-making; both have general applicability but always require careful analysis of particulars in determining the best response to each specific situation; both ideally take into account the wholeness of human nature; and finally, both have social utility and responsibility in that both treat matter of the public good".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Lois |last=Self |chapter=Rhetoric and Phronesis: The Aristotelian Ideal |title=Philosophy and Rhetoric |publisher=Penn State University Press |year=1979 |page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Hariman]], in his examination of [[Malcolm X]], adds that "aesthetic sensibility, imitation of a performative ideal, and improvisation upon conventions of presentation" are also components of practical reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hariman |first=Robert |title=Theory without Modernity |year=1991 |page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Small differences emerge between rhetorical scholars regarding definitions of the term and methods of analysis. [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]] asserted that prudence materializes through the application of principles and can be evaluated accordingly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gadamer|first=Hans-George |title=Truth and Method |journal=Crossroad |year=1982 |page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his analysis of [[Andrew Cuomo]]'s speech to the Catholic Church of Notre Dame, James Jasinski contends that prudence cannot {{clarify span|be calculated by formal matters like consequences|date=February 2015}} as it is not a ''episteme'' or ''techne''; instead, it is judged according to embodied rhetorical performance.&lt;ref name="Jasinski"/&gt; Thus, while Gadamer would judge prudence based on the execution of contingent principles, Jasinski would examine the artistry of communication in its cultural milieu between accommodation ([[compromise]]) and audacity ([[courage]]).{{clarify|date=February 2015}}

In his study of [[Machiavelli]], examining the relationship between prudence and moderation, rhetorician Eugene Garver holds that there is a middle ground between "an ethics of principles, in which those principles univocally dictate action" and "an ethics of consequences, in which the successful result is all".&lt;ref name="Garver"&gt;{{cite book |last=Garver |first=Eugene |title=Machiavelli and the History of Prudence |publisher=University of Wisconsin Press |year=1987 |isbn=0-299-11080-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; His premise stems from Aristotle's theory of virtue as an "intermediate", in which moderation and compromise embody prudence. Yet, because valorizing moderation is not an active response, prudence entails the "transformation of moderation" into a fitting response, making it a flexible situational norm. Garver also asserts that prudential reasoning differs from "algorithmic" and "[[heuristic]]" reasoning because it is rooted in a political community, the context in which common problems regarding stability and innovation arise and call for prudential reasoning.&lt;ref name="Garver"/&gt;

== In economics ==
&lt;!--[[Saving]] links here --&gt;

Economists describe a [[consumer]] as "prudent" if he or she [[Saving|saves]] more when faced with [[risk]]ier future income. This additional saving is called [[precautionary saving]]. 

If a risk-averse consumer has a [[utility function]] &lt;math&gt;u(x)&lt;/math&gt; over consumption ''x'', and if &lt;math&gt;u(x)&lt;/math&gt; is [[Derivative|differentiable]], then the consumer is not prudent unless the third [[derivative]] of utility is positive, that is, &lt;math&gt;
u^{'''}\left(x\right)&gt;0
&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=A. |last=Sandmo |year=1970 |title=The Effect of Uncertainty on Saving Decisions |journal=[[Review of Economic Studies]] |volume=37 |issue=3 |pages=353–360 |jstor=2296725 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The strength of the precautionary saving motive can be measured by '''absolute prudence''', which is defined as
&lt;math&gt;
-\frac{u^{'''}\left(x\right)}{u^{''}\left(x\right)}
&lt;/math&gt;. Similarly, '''relative prudence''' is defined as absolute prudence, multiplied by the level of consumption. These measures are closely related to the concepts of absolute and relative [[risk aversion]] developed by [[Kenneth Arrow]] and [[John W. Pratt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=M. |last=Kimball |year=1990 |title=Precautionary Saving in the Small and in the Large |journal=[[Econometrica]] |volume=58 |issue=1 |pages=53–73 |jstor=2938334 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In accounting ==

In [[accounting]], prudence was long considered one of the "fundamental accounting concepts" in its determination of the time for [[revenue recognition]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/bimmanual/bim31030.htm Tax and accountancy: 'fundamental accounting concepts'], [[HMRC]], UK. Retrieved 2011-04-12.&lt;/ref&gt; The rule of prudence meant that gains should not be anticipated unless their realisation was highly probable. However, recent developments in [[Generally Accepted Accounting Principles]] have led academic critics to accuse the international standard-setting body [[IASB]] of abandoning prudence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accountancyage.com/aa/news/1808094/iasb-abandoned-prudence-professor-warns IASB has abandoned prudence, professor warns], ''[[Accountancy Age]]'', 24 August 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (UK)|British reporting standard]] FRS 18, prudence, along with consistency, was relegated to a "desirable" quality of financial information rather than fundamental concept.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/bimmanual/bim31032.htm Tax and accountancy: development of accountancy concepts and new objectives: FRS18], HMRC. Retrieved 2011-04-12.&lt;/ref&gt; Prudence was rejected for IFRS because it was seen as compromising accounts' neutrality.&lt;ref name="Lords"&gt;Rose Orlik, [http://www.accountancyage.com/aa/analysis/2039988/lords-leap-international-standards Lords took a leap on international standards], ''[[Accountancy Age]]'',  4 Apr 2011. Retrieved 2011-04-12..&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2011 report on the [[financial crisis of 2007–08]], the British [[House of Lords]] bemoaned the demotion of prudence as a governing principle of accounting and [[Financial audit|audit]]. Their comments, however, were disputed by some leading practitioners.&lt;ref name="Lords"/&gt;

[[File:Macoy Masonic Hebrew with text 1868 p134.jpg|thumb|''Qodeš l-Yahweh'', "Holy to [[Yahweh]]", an inscription worn on the forehead of the [[High Priest of Israel]]]]
'''''Q-D-Š''''' is a triconsonantal [[Semitic root]] meaning "[[sacred|sacred, holy]]", derived from a concept central to [[ancient Semitic religion]]. From a basic verbal meaning "to consecrate, to purify", it could  be used as an adjective meaning "holy", or as a  substantive referring to a "sanctuary, sacred object, sacred personnel."&lt;ref name=Toornp415/&gt;

The root is reflected as ''qdš'' ([[Phoenician alphabet|Phoenician]] 𐤒𐤃‬𐤔, [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew]] {{Script/Hebrew|קדש}}) in [[Northwest Semitic]] and as ''qds'' ([[Arabic alphabet|Arabic]] {{lang|ar|قدس|rtl=yes}}) in [[Central Semitic|Central]] and [[South Semitic]].
In [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] texts, the verb conjugated from this root meant to "clean, purify."&lt;ref name=Toornp415/&gt;&lt;ref name=Botterweckp525&gt;{{citation|title=Theological Dictionary of the Old Testament|first1=G. Johannes|last1=Botterweck|first2=Helmer|last2=Ringgren|first3=Heinz-Josef|last3=Fabry|publisher=Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing|year=1974|isbn=0-8028-2336-X|page=525}}

It was used this way in [[Ugaritic language|Ugaritic]], as for example, in the words ''qidšu'' (meaning "holy place" or "chapel") and ''qad(i)šu'' (meaning "consecrated gift" or "cultic personnel").&lt;ref name=Toornp415/&gt; 
In some Ugaritic texts, ''qdš'' is used as a divine [[epithet]]. For example, the gods are referred to as "the sons of holiness" or "the holy ones" (''bn qdš''), and in the Ugaritic  ''[[Legend of Keret]]'', the hero is described as "the son of [[El (deity)|El]] and the offspring of the Benevolent One and ''qdš'' ".&lt;ref name=Toornp415&gt;van der Toorn et al., 1999, p. 415.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kholerp1076&gt;{{citation|first1=Ludwig|last1=Köhler|first2=Walter|last2=Baumgartner|first3=Mervyn Edwin John |last3=Richardson|first4=Johann Jakob|last4=Stamm|title=The Hebrew and Aramaic Lexicon of the Old Testament|publisher=E.J. Brill|year=1994|volume=v. 3|page=1076}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William F. Albright|William Foxwell Albright]] believed that ''Qudšu'' (meaning "holiness") was a common [[Canaanite languages|Canaanite]] appellation for the [[goddess]] [[Asherah]], and Albright's mentee [[Frank Moore Cross]] claimed ''qdš'' was used as a divine epithet for both Asherah and the Ugaritic goddess, [[Asherah|Athirat]].&lt;ref name=Toornp415/&gt;&lt;ref name=Albrightp121&gt;Albright, 1990, pp.&amp;nbsp;121–122.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hadleyp49&gt;Hadley, 2000, p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Johanna Stucky claims she may have been a deity in her own right.&lt;ref name=Stuckey&gt;{{Citation|author=Johanna Stuckey|url=http://www.matrifocus.com/LAM07/spotlight.htm|title=The "Holy One"|publisher=MatriFocus|year=2007|accessdate=2008-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Depictions of a goddess in inscriptions from [[History of ancient Egypt#Dynastic Egypt|Dynastic Egypt]], thought to Canaanite since she is referred to as ''Qdš'' (often transliterated in English as Qedesha, Qudshu or [[Qetesh]]), show a woman in the nude, with curly hair and raised arms carrying [[Lilium|lilies]] and [[Serpent (symbolism)|serpent]]s.&lt;ref name=Albrightp121/&gt;&lt;ref name=Toornp416&gt;van der Toorn, et al., 1999, p. 416.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Qdš'' is also depicted in the pantheon of gods at [[Memphis, Egypt]] possibly indicating worship of her as independent deity there.&lt;ref name=Toornp416/&gt; The word ''qdš'' also appears in the [[Pyrgi Tablets]], a [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]] text found in [[Italy]] that dates back to 500 BCE.&lt;ref name=Azizep184&gt;{{citation|title=The Phoenician Solar Theology: An Investigation Into the Phoenician Opinion of the Sun Found in Julian's Hymn to King Helios|first1=Joseph|last1=Azize|publisher=Gorgias Press LLC|year=2005|isbn=1-59333-210-6|page=184}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hebrew==
''Qudšu'' was later used in [[Judeo-Aramaic language|Jewish Aramaic]] to refer to [[God in Judaism|God]],&lt;ref name=Albrightp121/&gt; and ''qudš'' is the proto-form of the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] word ''qadōš'', meaning "holy".

Words derived from the root ''qdš'' appear some 830 times in the [[Hebrew Bible]].&lt;ref name=Balesp48&gt;{{citation|title=He Died to Make Men Holy|first1=Norman|last1=Bales|publisher=College Press|year=1991|isbn=0-89900-271-4|page=48}}

Its use in the Hebrew Bible evokes ideas of separation from the profane, and proximity to the Otherness of God, while in nonbiblical Semitic texts, recent interpretations of its meaning link it to ideas of [[consecration]], belonging, and purification.{{clarify|date=April 2015}}&lt;!--how is "separation from the profane" different as a concept from "ritual purification"?--&gt;&lt;ref name=Deissp81&gt;{{citation|title=Visions of Liturgy and Music for a New Century|first1=Lucien|last1=Deiss|authorlink=Lucien Deiss|first2=Jane M.-A.|last2=Burton|first3=Donald|publisher=Liturgical Press|year=1996|isbn=0-8146-2298-4|last3=Molloy|page=81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Hebrew language]] is called "The Holy Tongue" ({{lang-he-n|לשון הקודש}} "Lashon HaKodesh") in Judaism. 
In addition, the Hebrew term for the Holy [[Temple in Jerusalem]] is ''Beit Hamikdash'' ({{Hebrew|בית המקדש}}, "the holy house"), and ''[[Ir Ha-Kodesh]]'' ({{hebrew|עיר הקודש}}, "City of the Holy"), the latter being one of [[Names of Jerusalem|the tens of Hebrew names]] for [[Jerusalem]].

Three theological terms that come from this root are [[Kiddush]], which is sanctification of the Sabbath or a festival with a blessing over wine before the evening and noon meals, [[Kaddish]], which is the sanctification prayer, and mourner's prayer, and [[Kedushah]] which is the responsive section of the reader's repetition of the [[Amidah]].

''Kedeshah'' ({{Hebrew|קדשה}}) is a word derived from the Q-D-Š root, which is used in the Hebrew Bible to describe a particular sort of woman. There is debate in modern scholarship over whether a ''kedeshah'' was a sacred prostitute, or whether she was some other sort of cultic functionary.&lt;ref&gt;Westenholz, Joan Goodnick. “Tamar, Qědēšā, Qadištu, and Sacred Prostitution in Mesopotamia.” The Harvard Theological Review, vol. 82, no. 3, 1989, pp. 245–265., www.jstor.org/stable/1510077.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=note2&gt;Also transliterated ''qĕdeshah'', ''q&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt;deshah'', ''qědēšā'' ,''qedashah'', ''kadeshah'', ''kadesha'', ''qedesha'', ''kdesha''. A modern liturgical pronunciation would be ''k'deysha''.&lt;/ref&gt; While the word ''zonah'' ({{Hebrew|זנה}}) simply meant an ordinary prostitute or loose woman, the word ''kedeshah'' literally means "consecrated female".&lt;ref name=note1&gt;Associated with the corresponding verb ''zanah''.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two different words describing places that use this root in the [[Hebrew Bible]]. One is [[Kedesh]], which refers to a [[Canaan]]ite village first documented in [http://scripturetext.com/joshua/20-7.htm Joshua 20:7] and later in [http://scripturetext.com/2_kings/15-29.htm 2 Kings 15:29]. The other is [[Kadesh (Israel)|Kadesh]], a place in the south of [[History of ancient Israel and Judah|Ancient Israel]], mentioned in {{bibleverse||Numbers|13:26|NIV}} and {{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|2:14|NIV}}. &lt;!--scripturetext is better than {{bibleverse}} in that it provides multiple versions including the Hebrew source. --&gt;

This phrase appears in the [[Qur'an]] a number of times, where it is thought to refer in some cases to the angel [[Gabriel]].&lt;ref name=Hughesp133&gt;{{citation|title=A Dictionary of Islam: Being a Cyclopaedia of the Doctrines, Rites, Ceremonies, and Customs, Together With the Technical and Theological Terms, of the Muhammadan Religion|first1=Thomas Patrick|last1=Hughes|first2=Patrick|last2=Hughes|publisher=Asian Educational Services|year=1996|isbn=81-206-0672-8|page=133}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of ''Rúḥu 'l-Quds'' is also discussed at length by the [[Sufism|Sufi]] mystic, [[ʻAbd al-Karim al-Jili]], who further distinguishes between two other concepts derived from the Q-D-S root in Arabic: ''qudsi'' ("holy one") and ''aqdasi'' ("most holy one").&lt;ref name=Nicholsonp108/&gt; The ''qudsi'' is one who "unceasingly contemplates the Divine consciousness ''[[Lataif-e-sitta#Latifat-as-Sirri|sirr]]'' ['secret'], which is his origin" and is "illuminated" by it, whereas the ''aqdasi'' ("most holy one") is one who is actually united with this Essence.&lt;ref name=Nicholsonp108&gt;{{citation|title=Studies in Islamic Mysticism|first1=Reynold Alleyne|last1=Nicholson|publisher=Routledge|year=1978|isbn=0-7007-0278-4|pages=108–110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Qudsi'' is also used in Arabic to refer to a Jerusalemite, or a native/resident of Jerusalem.&lt;ref name=Elihayp435&gt;{{Citation|title=The Olive Tree Dictionary: A Transliterated Dictionary of Conversational Eastern Arabic (Palestinian)|first1=J.|last1=Elihay|publisher=Kidron Publishing|year=2004|isbn=0-9759726-0-X|page=435}}&lt;/ref&gt; It and its derivatives, such as [[Maqdisi]] and al-Muqaddasi are used in Arabic [[surname]]s or as appellatives assigned to those who come from or live in Jerusalem.

The religious terms ''Hadith Qudsi'' ("holy [[hadith]]") and ''[[Tafsir Qudsi]]'' ("sacred commentary") also incorporate ''qudsi'', though in this case it is used as an adjective, rather than a noun or pronoun. Tafsir Qudsi is a form of Quranic commentary, while Hadith Qudsi refers to the "utterances of God through the [[Muhammed|Prophet]]", thus enjoying a status higher than that the hadith writings in general, though lower than that of the [[Qur'an]].&lt;ref name=Glassep383&gt;Glassé and Smith, 2001, p. 383.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other derivatives of Q-D-S in Arabic include ''qudus'', which means "purity", "sanctity", "saint" or "holy", and ''qadas'', which is used to refer to a "small cup or plate", often used to put forth offerings at holy sites.&lt;ref name=Steingassp823/&gt; ''Taqdis'' means to "purify, sanctify, consecrate to God," ''taqqadus'' is to "be purified, sanctified, consecrated," and ''taqâdus'' means to "play the saint". ''Istiqdas'' means "to deem holy."&lt;ref name=Steingassp823/&gt;

[[File:Nettelship, Richard Lewis.png|thumb|upright|Richard Lewis Nettleship.]]
'''Richard Lewis Nettleship''' (17 December 1846 – 25 August 1892) was an English [[philosopher]].

==Life==
The youngest brother of [[Henry Nettleship]], he was educated at [[Uppingham School|Uppingham]] and [[Balliol College, Oxford]], where he held a scholarship. He won the Hertford scholarship, the Ireland, the [[Gaisford Prize]] for Greek verse, a Craven scholarship and the Arnold prize, but took only a second class in ''[[Literae Humaniores]]''. 

Nettleship became fellow and tutor of his college and succeeded to the work of [[Thomas Hill Green|T. H. Green]], whose writings he edited with a memoir. He was fond of music and outdoor sports, and rowed in his college boat. He died on 25 August 1892, from the effects of [[hypothermia|exposure]] on [[Mont Blanc]], and was buried at [[Chamonix]].

==Works==
Nettleship left an unfinished work on [[Plato]], part of which was published after his death, together with his lectures on [[logic]] and some essays.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://archives.balliol.ox.ac.uk/Exhibitions/exhib14Nettleship.asp Richard Lewis Nettleship (1846-1892), philosopher] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070922185611/http://archives.balliol.ox.ac.uk/Exhibitions/exhib14Nettleship.asp |date=22 September 2007 }}'', at balliol.ox.ac.uk, accessed 16 August 2008&lt;/ref&gt; His long essay ''The Theory of Education in the Republic of Plato'' was published in ''[[Hellenica]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Ed. Evelyn Abbott, (London : Longmans, Green &amp; Co., 1st ed., 1880) : 70-165.&lt;/ref&gt;

His thought was idealistic, embodying elements of [[Hegelianism]] but also, in its account of the [[Platonic Forms]] (''eide'', ''idiai''), markedly influenced by a particular reading of the [[Kantian]] categories.&lt;ref&gt;D. A. Rees, ''The Republic of Plato'', ed. James Adam, Cambridge : CUP, 1965/ 1902), I : xxv).&lt;/ref&gt; Many saw him as a model and example of philosophical honest and persistent philosophical inquiry. This did not prevent the undergraduates of Balliol from a gentle parody in the 1880 [[Masque of Balliol]] : 

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Roughly, so to say, you know,&lt;br /&gt;
I am N-TTL-SH-P or so;&lt;br /&gt;
You are gated after Hall,&lt;br /&gt;
That's all. I mean that's nearly all.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The inchoateness of Nettleship's philosophical thinking is more apparent in the ''Philosophical Remains''&lt;ref&gt;''The Philosophical Remains of Richard Lewis Nettleship'', ed. A. C. Bradley, London : Macmillan, 1897, 2nd ed., 1901&lt;/ref&gt; than in the separate volume of lectures on Plato's ''[[The Republic (Plato)|Republic]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Lectures on the Republic of Plato'', ed. Lord Charnwood,London : Macmillan, 1897, 2nd ed., 1901.&lt;/ref&gt; From that volume a definite view of the aims, limits and scope of Plato's text emerges clearly. Few historians of philosophy would now accept, however, Nettleship's view of the analogy of the Line (509e-511c, 534a) 
as involving throughout a temporal progression.&lt;ref&gt;See R. C. Cross and A. D. Woozley, ''Plato's Republic : A Philosophical Commentary'', London : Macmillan, 1964).&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[rose]] has long been used as a symbol. "[[Rose (color)|Rose]]" means pink or red in a variety of languages (such as the [[Romance languages]], and Greek).

==In religion==
[[File:Dante Gabriel Rossetti - Venus Verticordia.jpg|thumb|''[[Venus Verticordia]]'' (1868) by [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]], showing the goddess [[Aphrodite]] surrounded by red roses]]
===Greco-Roman religion===
In [[ancient Greece]], the rose was closely associated with the goddess [[Aphrodite]].&lt;ref name="Cyrino2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cyrino|first=Monica S.|date=2010|title=Aphrodite|series=Gods and Heroes of the Ancient World|url=https://books.google.com/?id=7gyVn5GjXPkC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Aphrodite+Monica+S.+Cyrino#v=onepage&amp;q=Aphrodite%20Monica%20S.%20Cyrino&amp;f=false|location=New York City, New York and London, England|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-77523-6|pages=63, 96|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Clark2015"&gt;{{cite book|last=Clark|first=Nora|date=2015|title=Aphrodite and Venus in Myth and Mimesis|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Aw7nBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA210&amp;dq=rose+symbol+Aphrodite#v=onepage&amp;q=rose%20symbol%20Aphrodite&amp;f=false|location=Cambridge, England|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|isbn=978-1-4438-7127-3|pages=209–210|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''[[Iliad]]'', Aphrodite protects the body of [[Hector]] using the "immortal oil of the rose"&lt;ref&gt;''[[Iliad]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0134%3Abook%3D23%3Acard%3D161 23.185–187]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cyrino2010"/&gt; and the archaic Greek lyric poet [[Ibycus]] praises a beautiful youth saying that Aphrodite nursed him "among rose blossoms".&lt;ref&gt;[[Ibycus]], fragment 288.4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cyrino2010"/&gt; The second-century AD Greek travel writer [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] associates the rose with the story of [[Adonis]] and states that the rose is red because Aphrodite wounded herself on one of its thorns and stained the flower red with her blood.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], ''Description of Greece'' [http://perseus.uchicago.edu/perseus-cgi/citequery3.pl?dbname=GreekFeb2011&amp;getid=1&amp;query=Paus.%206.24.7 6.24.7]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cyrino2010"/&gt; Book Eleven of the ancient Roman novel ''[[The Golden Ass]]'' by [[Apuleius]] contains a scene in which the goddess [[Isis]], who is identified with [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]], instructs the main character, Lucius, who has been transformed into a [[donkey]], to eat rose petals from a crown of roses worn by a priest as part of a religious procession in order to regain his humanity.&lt;ref name="Clark2015"/&gt;

===Christianity===
Following the [[Christianization#Late antiquity (4th-6th centuries)|Christianization of the Roman Empire]], the rose became identified with the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]].&lt;ref&gt;Lisa Cucciniello, "Rose to Rosary: The Flower of Venus in Catholicism" in ''Rose Lore: Essays in Semiotics and Cultural History'' (ed. Frankie Hutton: [[Lexington Books]], 2008), pp. 64-65.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Clark2015"/&gt; The rose symbol eventually led to the creation of the [[rosary]] and other devotional prayers in Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;Cucciniello, ''Rose Lore'', at pp. 65-67.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Clark2015"/&gt; Ever since the 1400s, the [[Franciscans]] have had a Crown Rosary of the [[Seven Joys of the Virgin|Seven Joys of the Blessed Virgin Mary]].&lt;ref name="Clark2015"/&gt; In the 1400s and 1500s, the [[Carthusians]] promoted the idea of sacred mysteries associated with the rose symbol and rose gardens.&lt;ref name="Clark2015"/&gt; [[Albrecht Dürer]]'s painting ''[[Feast of the Rosary|The Feast of the Rosary]]'' (1506) depicts the Virgin Mary distributing garlands of roses to her worshippers.&lt;ref name="Clark2015"/&gt;

===Islam and Sufism===
The cultivation of geometrical gardens, in which the rose has often held pride of place, has a long history in Iran and surrounding lands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url=http://lj.uwpress.org/content/4/1/23.short | doi=10.3368/lj.4.1.23| title=The Philosophy of Persian Garden Design: The Sufi Tradition| journal=Landscape Journal| volume=4| pages=23–30| year=1985| last1=Shirvani| first1=Hamid}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1478-1913.1941.tb00950.x | volume=31 | issue=4 | title=THE ROSE AND ISLAM | journal=The Muslim World | pages=360–370 | last1 = Marinus Zwemer | first1 = Samuel| year=1941 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the lyric [[ghazal]], it is the beauty of the rose that provokes the longing song of the [[nightingale]]&lt;ref name=Diba2001&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Diba|first=Layla S.|title=Gol o bolbol|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Iranica|year=2001|volume=11|pages=52–57|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/gol-o-bolbol|accessdate=15 November 2013|editor-first=Ehsan|editor-last=Yarshater|editor-link=Ehsan Yarshater|publisher=Routledge|location=London and New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; - an image prominent, for example, in the poems of [[Hafez]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=rbs3AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA111&amp;dq=sufi+rose#v=onepage&amp;q=sufi%20rose&amp;f=false Julian Baldick in ''History of Persian Literature'' - Google Books;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In turn, the imagery of lover and beloved became a type of the [[Sufism|Sufi]] mystic's quest for divine love, so that [[Ibn Arabi]], for example, aligns the rose with the beloved's blushing cheek on the one hand and, on the other, with the [[Names of God in Islam|divine names and attributes]].&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Arabi, ''The Tarjuman al-Ashwaq'', Trans. R.A.Nicholson, Theosophical Publishing House 1911/1978, p 130, 145&lt;/ref&gt;

Other well-known examples of rose symbolism in Sufism include;
* The Sufi master [[Jilani]] is known as "the Rose of Baghdad" and his order, the [[Qadiriyya]], uses the rose as its symbol.
*Two prominent books aligned with Sufism are ''[[Gulistan of Sa'di|The Rose Garden]]'' by [[Saadi (poet)|Saadi]] and [[Mahmud Shabistari]]'s ''[[Gulshan-i Raz|The Rose Garden of Secrets]]''.

==In Europe==
[[File:Santjordi.jpg|thumb|Selling roses on [[St George's Day]] in [[Catalonia]], Spain]]

===Catalonia===
[[Catalan people|Catalans]] on the north eastern Spain have traditionally celebrated [[Saint George's Day]] (April 23)—which commemorates [[Saint George]] (''Sant Jordi''), the [[patron saint]] of the [[Catalonia]] region; as the ''dia dels enamorats''  (lovers' day), on which lovers exchange blood-red roses.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Tree, [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/apr/23/st-georges-day-catalonia St George's Day with a Catalan twist], ''The Guardian'' (April 23, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== England===
[[File:Tudor Rose.svg|thumb|The [[Tudor rose]].]]
The rose is the [[National symbols of England|national flower of England]], a usage dating back to the English civil wars of the fifteenth century (later called [[Wars of the Roses]]), in which a [[Red Rose of Lancaster|red rose represented the House of Lancaster]], and a [[White Rose of York|white rose represented the House of York]].&lt;ref&gt;Peter Childs, "Places and Peoples: Region and Nation" in ''British Cultural Identities'' (4th ed.: eds. Mike Storry &amp; Peter Childs; Routledge, 2013), p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Tudor dynasty]] created the [[Tudor rose]], which united both the white and the red roses, a symbolism dramatized by [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] in his play ''[[Richard III (play)|Richard III]]''.&lt;ref&gt;George Goodwin, ''Fatal Rivalry: Flodden, 1513: Henry VIII and James IV and the Decisive Battle for Renaissance Britain'' (W. W. Norton: 2013), p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jon Robinson, ''Court Politics, Culture and Literature in Scotland and England, 1500-1540'' (Ashgate: 2008), p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; The traditional ballad "[[The Rose of England]]" ([[Child Ballads|Child]] 166) recounts the seizure of the crown by Earl of Richmond (who became [[Henry VII of England]], the founder the Tudor dynasty), using the "red rose" as an allegory for Henry.&lt;ref&gt;Natascha Würzbach &amp; Simone M. Salz, ''Motif Index of the Child Corpus'' ([[Walter de Gruyter]], 1995), pp. 175-76.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[England national rugby union team]] and [[Rugby Football Union]] adopted the red rose as their symbol in 1871, and the rose has appeared on players' [[Rugby union equipment|kit]] ever since.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.englandrugby.com/twickenham/world-rugby-museum/rugby-history/the-england-kit/ Rugby History: Evolution of the England Kit], [[Rugby Football Union]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==In North America==

===United States===
In 1986, the rose was adopted as the national floral emblem of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;36 U.S.C. § 303 ("The flower commonly known as the rose is the national floral emblem.").&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Buchmann, ''The Reason for Flowers: Their History, Culture, Biology, and How They Change Our Lives'' (Simon &amp; Schuster, 2016), p. 218.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is the [[List of U.S. state flowers|state flower]] of five U.S. states: 
*[[Iowa]] - the wild rose was adopted as the state's flower in 1896.&lt;ref&gt;Linda Naeve, [http://www.ipm.iastate.edu/ipm/hortnews/1996/9-13-1996/wildrose.html Iowa's State Flower - the Wild Rose] (September 13, 1996), ''Horticulture &amp; Home Pest News'' (Iowa State University Extension and Outreach).&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[North Dakota]] - The wild prairie rose was adopted as the official state flower of North Dakota in 1907. The colors of the rose (green and pink) had previously been adopted by the first graduating class of the [[University of North Dakota]] in 1889.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ndstudies.gov/state_flower Wild Prairie Rose], [[State Historical Society of North Dakota]].&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] - the Cherokee rose (''[[Rosa laevigata|R. laevigata]]'') was adopted as the state's official floral emblem in 1916.&lt;ref&gt;[http://georgiainfo.galileo.usg.edu/topics/government/article/georgia-state-symbols/georgia-state-flower-cherokee-rose Georgia State Flower (Cherokee Rose)], ''GeorgiaInfo: An Online Georgia Almanac'', [[Digital Library of Georgia]].&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[New York (state)|New York]] - In 1955, the state adopted the rose as the state flower; the legislation stated: "The rose shall be the official flower of the state in any color or combination of colors common to it."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nysl.nysed.gov/emblems/flower.htm New York State Flower - Rose], [[New York State Library]].&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Oklahoma]] - In 2004, Oklahoma adopted a new cultivar named Oklahoma rose as state flower.

[[Portland, Oregon]] has counted "City of Roses" among its nicknames (see [[roses in Portland, Oregon]]) since 1888,&lt;ref name="RosaISmith"&gt;Rosa Inocencio Smith, [https://www.theatlantic.com/notes/2016/05/orbital-view-city-of-roses/481215/ Orbital View: City of Roses], ''The Atlantic'' (May 5, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; and has held an annual [[Portland Rose Festival|Rose Festival]] since 1905.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/fodors/top/features/travel/destinations/unitedstates/oregon/portland/fdrs_feat_121_4.html Coming Up Roses], ''[[Fodor's]]'' (2006) (republished by the ''New York Times'').&lt;/ref&gt; The city is also known for its [[International Rose Test Garden]].&lt;ref name="RosaISmith"/&gt;

[[Pasadena, California]]—also nicknamed the "City of Roses"—has held the annual [[Tournament of Roses Parade]] since 1890, and 1902 the Parade has been held in conjunction with the [[Rose Bowl Game]] (which is now played at the city's [[Rose Bowl (stadium)|Rose Bowl]] stadium, built in 1922).&lt;ref&gt;Michelle Huneven, [https://www.nytimes.com/2003/09/19/travel/escapes/19HOUR.html?pagewanted=all 37 Hours: Pasadena, Calif.], ''New York Times'' (September 19, 2003).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/slideshow/2013/12/31/sports/ncaafootball/Rose-Bowl.html#1 The Rose Bowl's Storied History], ''New York Times'' (December 31, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2011, the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. government's]] [[list of space agencies|space program]] agency, the [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA), celebrated the [[Hubble Space Telescope]]'s 21st anniversary by releasing an image of [[spiral galaxies]] [[Arp 273]] positioned in a rose-like shape.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author= |date=April 20, 2011 |title=NASA's Hubble Celebrates 21st Anniversary with 'Rose' of Galaxies |publisher=[[NASA]] |page= |url= http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/hubble/science/hubble-rose.html|accessdate=January 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The red rose is also part of the official logo of the [[Democratic Socialists of America]] (DSA),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.dsausa.org/about_dsa|title = What Is Democratic Socialism?|date = |accessdate = December 15, 2015|website = |publisher = Democratic Socialists of America|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; being a symbol of socialism generally.&lt;ref name="The Rose and the Fist"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://fruitsofourlabour.blogspot.com/2006/08/rose-and-fist.html |title=The Rose and the Fist |last=n/a |first=n/a |date=2006-08-27 |website=The Fruits of Our Labour |access-date=2018-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Canada===
In 1930, ''[[Rosa acicularis]]'' (the wild rose or prickly rose) was adopted as the [[Symbols of Alberta|official provincial flower]] of the [[Provinces and territories of Canada|Canadian province]] of [[Alberta]]. The suggestion that a provincial floral emblem be adopted by first made by an [[Edmonton]] newspaper editor; "the [[Women's Institute]]s took up the suggestion and passed it on to the Department of Education, and the province's schoolchildren made the final choice."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/games/teachers-corner/fact-sheet-alberta.asp Alberta (AB) - Facts, Flags and Symbols], Government of Canada (accessed May 24, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://cwf-fcf.org/en/discover-wildlife/flora-fauna/flora/wild-roses.html Wild Roses], Canadian Wildlife Federation (accessed May 24, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Wildrose Party]], a now-defunct Albertan political party, was named after the province's official flower.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/multimedia/the-rise-and-fall-of-the-alberta-wildrose-party-1.2877724 The rise and fall of the Alberta Wildrose Party], CBC News (December 18, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mexico===
The Mexican city of [[Guadalajara]], the capital of [[Jalisco]], is nicknamed the "City of Roses" (''Ciudad de las Rosas'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.philly.com/1987-10-11/news/26217191_1_plaza-de-la-liberacion-guadalajara-del-sol-shopping-mall The Mexican 'City Of Roses' Where Americans Feel At Home], ''[[Philadelphia Inquirer]]'' wire services (October 11, 1987).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bob Brooke, ''The Everything Family Guide To Mexico: From Pesos to Parasailing'' (Adams Media, p. 236).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Socialism and social democracy==
{{see also|List of political party symbols}}
The [[Tamiment Library and Robert F. Wagner Archives]] at [[New York University]] states that the rose "has always been an important symbol with [[anti-authoritarian]] associations."&lt;ref name="Tamiment"&gt;[http://www.nyu.edu/library/bobst/research/tam/aboutlogo.html About Our Logo], [[Tamiment Library and Robert F. Wagner Archives]], [[New York University]] (accessed May 25, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; The rose is used to show  the end after the means, meaning "lay a rose on the grave". The rose symbol became popular among [[socialist]] and [[social democracy|social democratic]] political parties in post-[[World War II]] Western Europe.&lt;ref name="Tamiment"/&gt; The symbol of a rose in a fist is used by the [[Socialist International]] "and many of its member parties" such as the [[French Socialist Party]] (PS).&lt;ref&gt;''Historical Dictionary of Socialism'' ([[Rowman &amp; Littlefield]], 2015), p. 167.&lt;/ref&gt;

The British [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] has used a red rose as its symbol since the late 1980s; the rose replaced the party's previous symbol, the [[Red flag (politics)|red flag]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-10518842 The rise and fall of New Labour], BBC News (August 3, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas William Heyck, ''A History of the Peoples of the British Isles'' (Vol. 3: [[Psychology Press]], 2002), p. 312.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Simplicity''' is the state or quality of being [[wikt:simple|simple]]. Something easy to understand or explain seems simple, in contrast to something complicated. Alternatively, as [[Herbert A. Simon]] suggests, something is simple or [[Complexity|complex]] depending on the way we choose to describe it.&lt;ref&gt;Simon 1962, p. 481&lt;/ref&gt; In some uses, the label "simplicity" can imply [[beauty]], purity, or clarity. In other cases, the term may occur with negative connotations to suggest, a deficit or insufficiency of nuance or of complexity of a thing, relative to what one supposes as required.

The concept of simplicity has been related to in the field of [[epistemology]] and [[philosophy of science]] (e.g., in [[Occam's razor]]). Religions also reflect on simplicity with concepts such as [[divine simplicity]]. In the context of human [[Lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]], simplicity can denote freedom from hardship, effort or confusion;{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} specifically, it can refer to a [[simple living]] style.

==Uncomplicated==
{{See also|Degree of difficulty|Complexity|Concision}}
"Simplicity" is the state or quality of being [[wikt:simple|simple]]. An easy-to-understand [[tutorial]] or [[white paper]] with a narrow focus can be seen as simple, particularly in contrast more complicated thorough [[documentation]] covering a topic's breadth. Similarly, "simplicity" can be used in reference to tasks that need little [[skill]] to perform well.

In some uses, the label "simplicity" can imply [[beauty]], purity, or clarity. In other cases, the term may occur with negative connotations to suggest, a deficit or insufficiency of nuance or of complexity of a thing, relative to what one supposes as required, as when referring to people as [[simpleton]]s.

==In philosophy of science==
{{Expert needed|philosophy
|date=May 2018}}

The concept of simplicity has been related to in{{clarify|date=April 2015}} the field of [[epistemology]] and [[philosophy of science]].

According to [[Occam's razor]], all other things being equal, the ''simplest'' theory is most likely true. In other words, simplicity is a meta-scientific criterion by which scientists evaluate competing theories.

A distinction is often made{{by whom|date=April 2015}} between two senses of simplicity: [[syntactic simplicity]] (the number and complexity of hypotheses), and [[ontological simplicity]] (the number and complexity of things postulated). These two aspects of simplicity are often referred to as [[elegance]] and [[Occam's razor|parsimony]] respectively.&lt;ref&gt;

|quote= A distinction is often made between two fundamentally distinct senses of simplicity: syntactic simplicity (roughly, the number and complexity of hypotheses), and ontological simplicity (roughly, the number and complexity of things postulated). [...] These two facets of simplicity are often referred to as ''elegance'' and ''parsimony'' respectively. [...] The terms ‘parsimony’ and ‘simplicity’ are used virtually interchangeably in much of the philosophical literature.
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John von Neumann]] defines simplicity as important esthetic criteria of scientific models: {{Quote|[...] (scientific model) must satisfy certain esthetic criteria - that is, in relation to how much it describes, it must be rather simple. I think it is worth while insisting on these vague terms - for instance, on the use of word rather. One cannot tell exactly how "simple" simple is. [...] Simplicity is largely a matter of historical background, of previous conditioning, of antecedents, of customary procedures, and it is very much a function of what is explained by it.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==In religion==
Simplicity is a theme in the [[Christian]] religion. According to [[St. Thomas Aquinas]], God is [[Divine simplicity|infinitely simple]]. The Roman Catholic and Anglican religious orders of [[Franciscan]]s also strive for personal simplicity. Members of the [[Religious Society of Friends]] (Quakers) practice the [[Testimony of Simplicity]], which involves simplifying one's  [[personal life|life]] to focus on what is important and disregard or avoid what is least important. Simplicity is tenet of Anabaptistism, and some [[Anabaptism|Anabaptist]] groups like the [[Bruderhof Communities|Bruderhof]], make an effort to live simply.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theamericanconservative.com/dreher/life-among-the-bruderhof/|title=Life Among The Bruderhof|work=The American Conservative|access-date=2017-12-07|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://qcfamilytree.org/a-visit-to-spring-valley-bruderhof/|title=A visit to Spring Valley Bruderhof|date=2014-03-13|work=QC Family Tree|access-date=2018-03-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Roots of Coincidence''''' is a 1972 book by [[Arthur Koestler]], an introduction to theories of [[parapsychology]], including [[extrasensory perception]] and [[psychokinesis]]. Koestler postulates links between modern physics, their interaction with [[time]] and [[paranormal]] phenomena. It is influenced by [[Carl Jung|Carl Jung's]] concept of [[synchronicity]] and the seriality of [[Paul Kammerer]].&lt;ref name="Marks 2000"&gt;[[David Marks (psychologist)|Marks, David]]. (2000). ''[[The Psychology of the Psychic]]'' (2nd Edition). Prometheus Books. pp. 227- 246. {{ISBN|1-57392-798-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The psychologist [[David Marks (psychologist)|David Marks]] criticized the book for endorsing [[pseudoscience]]. Marks noted that Koestler uncritically accepted ESP experiments and ignored evidence that did not fit his hypothesis. Marks coined the term "[[Koestler's Fallacy]]" as the assumption that odd matches of random events cannot arise by chance. Marks illustrates the fact that such odd matches do regularly occur with examples from his own experience.&lt;ref name="Marks 2000"/&gt; [[John Beloff]] gave the book a mixed review, describing it as "a typical Koestlerian performance" but noting that some of his claims about psychical research were inaccurate.&lt;ref&gt;Beloff, John. (1972).

== Appearances in popular culture ==
In Volume 7 of [[Alan Moore]] and [[David Lloyd (comics)|David Lloyd]]'s ''[[V for Vendetta]]'', Inspector Finch is seen reading ''The Roots of Coincidence''. Koestler is referenced several times in the work, and in the movie novelization by Steve Moore. Koestler's ideas had previously made their way into the [[Dr. Manhattan]] issues of Moore's and [[Dave Gibbons]]' ''[[Watchmen]]''.

It also played a significant role in Episode 4 ("[[Entangled (Red Dwarf)|Entangled]]") of [[Red Dwarf X|Series X]] of ''[[Red Dwarf]]'', to explain the cause of apparent coincidences. The cover of the Picador paperback edition, with dominoes in the foreground representing star coordinates, is integral to furthering the plot of this episode.

The musician [[Sting (musician)|Sting]] was an avid reader of Koestler. Sting named [[The Police|The Police's]] final studio album ''[[Synchronicity (The Police album)|Synchronicity]]'' as a reference to ''The Roots of Coincidence''. He had named The Police's previous album, ''[[The Ghost in the Machine|Ghost in the Machine]]'', after another of Koestler's books.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}

"The Roots of Coincidence" is also the name of a [[Grammy Award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance#1990s|Grammy Award]]-winning song by [[Pat Metheny Group]], featured on their 1997 album ''[[Imaginary Day]]''.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}

'''Theopanism''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]]: Θεός ''Theos'', "God" and πᾶν ''pan'', "all") was first used as a technical term by the [[Jesuits]] in elucidating [[Hinduism]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}
{{quote|"[O]ne may distinguish pantheism, which imagines the world as an absolute being ("everything is God"), from theopanism, which conceives of God as the true spiritual reality from which everything emanates: "God becomes everything", necessarily, incessantly, without beginning and without end. Theopanism is (with only a few other dualistic systems) the most common way in which Hindu philosophy conceives God and the world."&lt;ref&gt;Civita Cattolica, 5, July, 1930, pp. 17-8, in [[Antonio Gramsci]], "The Prison Notebooks", p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Theopanism has also been more broadly stated as inclusive of any theological theory by which God is held equivalent to the Universe.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} As one author puts it: "In theopanism the meaning given the word God is of an entity that is not separate from the universe.

[[File:Thomas Garnett b1766.jpg|thumb|Thomas Garnett]]
'''Thomas Garnett''' (21 April 1766 – 28 June 1802) was an English physician and natural philosopher.

==Life==
Garnett was born on 21 April 1766 at [[Casterton, Cumbria|Casterton]] in [[Westmorland|Westmoreland]], where his father had a small landed property. After attending [[Sedbergh School]], he was at fifteen articled at his own request to the [[John Dawson (surgeon)]] of Sedbergh, Yorkshire, who was a surgeon and mathematician. Garnett obtained a knowledge of chemistry and physics, and he matriculated at the [[university of Edinburgh]] in 1785 with "exceptional scientific knowledge". He was particularly zealous in his attendance on the lectures of Dr. Black and of Dr. [[John Brown (doctor)|John Brown]], and he became a disciple of the [[Brunonian theory]]. "He avoided," says his anonymous biographer, "almost all society, and it is said he never allowed himself at this period more than four hours sleep per day. He graduated in 1788, completed his medical education in London, and, returning for a short time to his parents and wrote his treatise on optics for the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]''. In 1790 he practiced in Bradford and in the following year in Knaresborough and Harrogate. He published the first scientific analysis of the Harrogate waters and several schemes for the benefit of the inhabitants of Knaresborough".{{sfn|Garnett|1890a|p=7–8}}

Lord Rosslyn built him a house at [[Harrogate]], but his success did not answer his expectations, and he was meditating emigration to America when he succumbed to the attractions of Catharine Grace Cleveland, whom he had received as a boarder into his house. They were married in March 1795, and as he was in Liverpool endeavouring to arrange for a passage to America a casual invitation to deliver lectures on [[natural philosophy]] changed the current of his life. The success of the course, which was repeated at Manchester and other places, brought him an invitation to become professor at [[Anderson's Institution]] at Glasgow. He obtained great success at Glasgow, both as lecturer and physician, and in 1798 undertook the tour in the highlands of which his account was published in 1800. It is too diffuse, but was a valuable work in its day, and is interesting even now as an index to subsequent changes.{{sfn|Garnett|1890a|p=7–8}}{{sfn|Garnett|1811|p={{page needed|date=October 2017}} }}

On 25 Dec. 1798 his wife died giving birth to his daughter, [[Catherine Grace Godwin|Catherine Grace]], and he never recovered from this. His depression prevented him from carrying out the important post of professor of natural philosophy and chemistry at the Royal Institution, to which he was appointed in October 1799. It is further hinted that he incurred the dislike of [[Benjamin Thompson]], Count Rumford, the presiding genius of the institution. It is unnecessary, however, to seek any other cause than the inadequacy of his lectures to the demands of a popular assemblage. Those, at least, which were published after his death under the title of ''Zoonomia, or the Laws of Animal Life'' (1804), though full of knowledge and exceedingly clear in style, are too technical for a popular audience. His north-country accent was against him, and ill-health rendered his delivery inanimate. After lecturing for two seasons he resigned, and commenced medical practice in London. He was beginning to meet with success when he died, 28 June 1802, of [[typhus fever]] contracted at the Marylebone Dispensary where he worked. A subscription was raised, and his [[Royal Institution]] lectures were published for the benefit of his two infant daughters, one of whom was to be the poet Mrs. [[Catherine Grace Godwin]].{{sfn|Garnett|1890a|p=7–8}}{{sfn|Garnett|1890b|p=55}}

Garnett was a most amiable man, who fell a victim to the susceptibility of his character and the strength of his affections. Diffident of his own powers, he was enthusiastic for the discoveries and ideas of others. He had not the genius of discovery himself, but was observant and sagacious. A passage in his ''Highland Tour'' (i. 89) anticipates the modern theory of a quasi-[[Plant intelligence|intelligence in plants]].{{sfn|Garnett|1890a|p=7–8}}

The '''Toronto Zen Centre''' (or, ''Toronto Zen Center''), is a [[Sanbo Kyodan]] [[Zen Buddhist]] practice center in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], [[Canada]]. It is modeled after the [[Rochester Zen Center]].
They offer introductory workshops in [[Zen Buddhism]]. The Toronto Zen Centre offers a couple of unique [[Buddhist]] course in Loving Kindness Meditation and periodically offers Mastering Breath Awareness or an MBA.

==Foundation==
Founded initially by Philip Kapleau in 1972 as the Toronto Buddhist Centre, the center went on to eventually be incorporated as the Toronto Zen Centre in 1986.&lt;ref name="Wilson"&gt;Wilson&lt;/ref&gt; Currently the abbot of the Vermont Zen Center - Sensei Sunyana Graef &lt;ref&gt;Snelling, 156&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Dharma heir]] of [[Philip Kapleau]] &lt;ref&gt;Ford, 160&lt;/ref&gt;) is directing the centre's spiritual path while Sensei Taigen Henderson is the Abbot or [[Rōshi|Roshi]] of the centre.&lt;ref name="Wilson"/&gt;

He was known as a [[Translation|translator]], [[Philology|philologist]], and [[philosopher]].&lt;ref name="AllenObolevitch2016"&gt;{{cite book|last1= Allen|first1=Artur Mrowczynski-Van|last2=Obolevitch|first2=Teresa |last3=Rojek|first3=Pawel |title=Beyond Modernity: Russian Religious Philosophy and Post-Secularism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UTNQDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA156|accessdate=12 January 2018|date=11 October 2016|publisher=Wipf and Stock Publishers|isbn=978-1-4982-3977-6|page=156}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is best known for translations of [[Martin Heidegger]], which caused mixed reactions among specialists. He lectured in authors' courses at the philosophy faculty of [[Moscow State University]]. Bibikhin undertook a sufficient number of translations to enable him to formulate his own theory of Europe. This theory consisted in part of a return to the past, and enlivening the most valuable achievements of the past culture.&lt;ref name="AllenObolevitch2016"/&gt;

== Biography ==
Bibikhin graduated from [[Moscow State Linguistic University]] in 1967 and taught language and translation theory at both the [[Moscow State Linguistic University|MSLU]] and [[Moscow State Institute of International Relations|MGIMO University]]. At this time, he worked mainly on philosophy and literature and studied ancient languages under [[Andrey Zaliznyak]]. He completed his postgraduate study at the faculty of philosophy, [[Moscow State University|MSU]] in 1977 by defending his candidate's thesis, entitled: "Semantic Potencies of the Linguistic Sign."{{citation needed|date= February 2018}} The themes included in his thesis were: 
1) interrelations between word and world, 
2) word and thought, 
3) an approach to word and thought, 
4) attempt to think of the ontological foundation of language.
These theories were subsequently developed in a seminar called "Inner form of word" and in the courses "Language of Philosophy" and "L. Wittgenstein."

He worked as a secretary and assistant for [[Aleksei Losev]], also recording several conversations with the philosopher. These recordings were later collected and published in the book "Aleksei Fedorovich Losev. Sergey Sergeyevich Averintsev." (2004)

Bibikhin was employed at the [[Institute of Philosophy, Russian Academy of Sciences]] in 1972 and served there until his death. He spent his last years working at the Centre of Methodology and Ethics of Science of the Philosophy of Science and Technology Branch of the Institute.&lt;ref&gt;Центр методологии и этики науки // [http://iph.ras.ru/meth_eth_science.htm Официальный сайт ''Института философии РАН''].{{ref-ru}} — 06.09.2009.&lt;/ref&gt; He was a lecturer of Philosophy and member of the faculty of [[Moscow State University|MSU]] from 1989 onward.

He lectured in authors courses and held seminars at the Faculty of Philosophy of MSU from 1980 to 2004. He also lectured at [[St Philaret's Christian Institute|St. Philaret's Christian Institute]] in Moscow and St. Thomas Institute.

He was buried at Nikolo-Archangelski cemetery in Moscow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moscow-tombs.ru/2004/bibihin_vv.htm|title=Moscow graves. Bibihin. B., Московские могилы. Бибихин В.В.|website=Moscow-tombs.ru|accessdate=8 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philosopher and lecturer ==
{{Original research|date=December 2017}}
Bibikhin lectured in about twenty courses at MSU and other institutes. He wrote: 'Philosophy always went against the stream. With great risk... Philosophy is for the returning from doctrines to things; for recalling the early; for the ending of divination through words. There is a difference between philosophy and the sciences: they are building themselves, philosophy is called to reconstruct itself like a scaffolding after building the house.'&lt;ref&gt;''Бибихин В. В.'' Слово и событие. — М.: Эдиториал УРСС, 2001. — С. 47, 20.(Russian original)&lt;/ref&gt;

Bibikhin believed philosophy was not an "intellectual activity," nor a "scientific sphere" or a "cultural sphere," and the philosophers' language is not a "construction," or "information about the things" - rather, it is a 'preparation for the possibility of forming knowledge about things based on the last, utmost foundations'.  To Bibikhin, Philosophy is an 'attempt — guaranteed by nothing – to give my life, human life, back the way it used to be at the very beginning: relation to the world, not to the picture, but to an event'.&lt;ref&gt;''Бибихин В. В.'' Ранний Хайдеггер. Материалы к семинару. — М.: Институт философии, теологии и истории св. Фомы, 2009. — л. 15 — Серия «Bibliotheca Ignatiana». — {{ISBN|978-5-94242-047-5}} (inexact translation)&lt;/ref&gt; It is an attempt to let an event be in disinterested word, let it be the 'place where an event is shining, becoming a phenomenon, where all that exists is let to be as it really is, not controlled or placed on a register'.

[[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger's]] thought was essential to Bibikhin. In his four-term course "Early Heidegger" (1990s) Bibikhin read Heidegger's earliest works not as immature and preliminary, but as a commentary to his later writings. The course was mostly devoted, both in lecturers and seminars, to the reading and study of Heidegger's main work "[[Being and Time]]" (1927). Bibikhin's last seminars at the Institute of Philosophy and his last article were also dedicated to Heidegger.

== Translator ==
Vladimir Bibikhin translated texts from Spanish, Italian, Latin, Greek, French, English, and German from 1967 onward. He wrote several papers and scientific reviews, as well as commentaries on translations and articles on the theory of translation (the best of them were subsequently included in the book "Word and Event"). Among others, Bibikhin translated the works of [[Iamblichus]], [[John Amos Comenius]], [[Federico García Lorca|García Lorca]], [[Giuseppe Mazzini]], [[Petrarch]], [[Nicholas of Cusa]], [[Gregory Palamas|St. Gregory Palamas]], [[Macarius of Egypt|St. Macarius of Egypt]], [[Werner Heisenberg|W. Heisenberg]], [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], [[Gabriel Marcel]], [[Jacques Ellul]], [[Eugène Ionesco]], [[Antonin Artaud]], [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]], [[Sigmund Freud]], [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], [[Martin Heidegger]], [[Hans-Georg Gadamer|Gadamer]], [[Wilhelm Dilthey]], [[Hannah Arendt]], and [[Jacques Derrida]]. Theological translations were published under the pseudonym V. Veneaminov.

== Criticism ==
Bibikhin's views on philosophy of language were controversial, and were criticized by some professional philosophers and linguists.

N. V. Motroshilova claimed Bibikhin had deliberately concealed Heidegger's closeness to the Nazis and ignored empirical evidence of his loyalty to the Nazi regime.&lt;ref&gt;[http://iphras.ru/94_96.htm#4]  {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170104090803/http://iphras.ru/94_96.htm#4 |date=2017-01-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She also noted the ambiguity of his "[[Being and Time]]" translation: 'But his translation of "Being and Time" is worthy of special conversation. This translation is quite interesting and valuable as an independent phenomenon, and as Bibikhin's work. But the point is that it is the first and the only 'presence' of "Time and Being" in Russian philosophic culture, in Russian language for now. And, unfortunately, (I've heard it from many teachers), the translation doesn't help but significantly hampers comprehension of that classic work of XX century. So I'd recommend the above-mentioned E. Borisov's translation to those just starting their mastery of Heidegger's philosophy - it is not "Being and Time", but Heidegger is there more intelligible and adequate'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ruthenia.ru/logos/number/2000_1/2000_03.html|title=Беседа Е. Ознобкиной с Н.В. Мотрошиловой|website=Ruthenia.ru|accessdate=8 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics also complained of a distortion to Heidegger's works in Bibikhin's translations. For example, [[Aleksandr Dugin]] writes: 'It appears that Bibikhin and like-minded persons are really carried away by Heidegger, but there is nothing but that zeal in presentation of Heidegger. It's totally insufferable to read them because these texts say too much about conditions, efforts and sufferings of Bibikhin and his colleagues-translators, but there is almost nothing except for accidental coincidences, they say nothing about Heidegger or give the picture making one's hair stand on end.'&lt;ref&gt;[[Дугин, Александр Гельевич|Дугин А. Г.]] М. Хайдеггер. Философия другого начала. С. 13—14.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Boris Narumov]] criticizes V. Bibikhin for a lack of methodology and disregard for linguistics as a science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ruthenia.ru/logos/number/1999_01/1999_1_11.htm|title=Борис Нарумов / Contra Бибихин|website=Ruthenia.ru|accessdate=8 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A. Apollonov claims deliberate distortions in Bibhikin's translations in order to support his judgments by the authority of an established philosopher, citing Bibhikin's translation of Aristotle as an example.&lt;ref&gt;Аполлонов А. В. [https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B40kGNYr8xH5RHZNSEpjSm4zN0k/edit?pli=1 Рецензия на книгу: В. В. Бибихин. Внутренняя форма слова]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Political views ==
V. Bibikhin was a supporter of [[Chechnya|Chechnya's]] sovereignty. According to the testimony of Konstantin Anatolyevich Krylov, a personal acquaintance of Bibikhin, during the [[Second Chechen War]] Bibikhin confronted officers of the Russian Armed Forces and asked them "not to wage war with free people."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bookol.ru/nauka_obrazovanie/kulturologiya/126347/str920.htm|title=Читать книгу Нет времени - Страница 920|website=Bookol.ru|accessdate=8 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2003 V. Bibikhin took part in a public debate on the case of Yukos, standing on the side of [[Mikhail Khodorkovsky]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bibikhin.ru/volnyiy_um|title=Александр Михайловский. Вольный ум. В.В. Бибихин.  - Владимир Бибихин.|website=Bibikhin.ru|accessdate=8 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

V. Bibikhin was an adherent to ideas of [[liberalism]], [[multiculturalism]], and [[toleration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.dissercat.com/content/tolerantnost-kak-lichnostnyi-i-kulturnyi-fenomen|title=Толерантность как личностный и культурный феномен|first=Юровских, Наталья|last=Геннадьевна|date=8 January 2018|website=Dissercat.com|accessdate=8 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Awards and prizes ==
Bibikhin won the [[:ru:Малый Букер|Malyi Booker]] award for his book of essays "New Renaissance."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vavilon.ru/lit/smallbooker2000.html|title=Babylon: Literary Life of Moscow: Small Booker Prize for 2000: Conditions of the competition. Russian:ВАВИЛОН: Литературная жизнь Москвы: Малая Букеровская премия за 2000 год: Условия соискания |website=Vavilon.ru|accessdate=8 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a laureate of the literary prize "Book of the Year" in philosophic and humanitarian thought, for the book "Ludwig Wittgenstein: Change of Aspect". He was also awarded the A. Piatigorsky literature prize for the best philosophic work for his "Diaries of Leo Tolstoy" in 2003.

'''''Wu wei''''' is a concept literally meaning ''non-action'', ''non-doing'' or ''non-forcing''. Wu wei emerged in the [[Spring and Autumn period]] to become an important concept in both [[Taoism]] and Chinese statecraft.  

In the ''[[Tao Te Ching]]'', [[Lao Tzu]] explains that beings (or phenomena) that are wholly in harmony with the [[Tao]] behave in a completely natural, uncontrived way. The goal of spiritual practice for the human being is, {{dubious span|text = according to Lao Tzu, the attainment of this purely natural way of behaving, as when the planets revolve around the sun. The planets effortlessly do this revolving without any sort of control, force, or attempt to revolve themselves, thus engaging in effortless and spontaneous movement.|reason="Planets revolving around their sun(s)" is definitely a wrong thing to be attributed to Lao Tzu (who lived more than two thousand years ago). This needs to be rephrased, or a good quote/reference to be found to support this could – in some reasonable interpretation – indeed be the Lao Tzu's claim. |date=April 2018}}{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

[[Sinologist]] [[Herrlee Creel]] considered Wu wei a distinguishing factor between the more "purposive" religious Taoism of governmental [[Huang-Lao]], emphasizing a striving for immortality, and the philosophical Taoism of the ''[[Zhuangzi (book)|Zhuangzi]]'', which emphasizes Wu wei in the sense of not striving, often considering the search for immortality secondary, laughable, or harmful.&lt;ref&gt;Creel, What Is Taoism? (1979), 9-11&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
[[Sinologist]] [[Herrlee Creel]] considers Wu wei, as found in the ''[[Tao Te Ching]]'' and ''[[Zhuangzi (book)|Zhuangzi]]'', to denote two different things.

# An "attitude of genuine non-action, motivated by a lack of desire to participate in human affairs" and
# A "technique by means which the one who practices it may gain enhanced control of human affairs."

The first is quite in line with the contemplative Taoism of the Zhuangzi. Described as a source of serenity in Taoist thought, only rarely do Taoist texts suggest that ordinary people could gain political power through Wu wei. The Zhuangzi does not seem to indicate a definitive philosophical idea, simply that the sage "does not occupy himself with the affairs of the world." 

The second sense appears to have been imported from the earlier governmental thought of [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|"Legalist"]] [[Shen Buhai]] (400 BC – c. 337 BC) as Taoists became more interested in the exercise of power by the ruler.&lt;ref&gt;Creel 1970, What Is Taoism?, 73-78&lt;/ref&gt; Called "rule by non-activity" and strongly advocated by [[Han Fei]], during the Han dynasty, up until the reign of [[Han Wudi]] rulers confined their activity "chiefly to the appointment and dismissal of his high officials", a plainly "Legalist" practice inherited from the [[Qin dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;Creel 1970, What Is Taoism?, 99
* Pan Ku. trans. Homer Dubs, The History of the Former Han Dynasty&lt;/ref&gt; This "conception of the ruler's role as a supreme arbiter, who keeps the essential power firmly in his grasp" while leaving details to ministers, has a "deep influence on the theory and practice of Chinese monarchy."&lt;ref&gt;Creel 1970, What Is Taoism?, 99&lt;/ref&gt;

Only appearing three times in the first (more contemplative) half of the Zhuangzi, early Taoists may have avoided the term for its association with "Legalism" before ultimately co-opting its governmental sense as well, as attempted in the Zhuangzi's latter half. Thought by modern scholarship to have been written after the Zhuangzi, Wu wei becomes a major "guiding principle for social and political pursuit"&lt;ref&gt;Xuezhi Guo 2001, p.84 The Ideal Chinese Political Leader. https://books.google.com/books?id=6vG-MROnr7IC&amp;pg=PA142&lt;/ref&gt; in the more "purposive" Taoism of the Tao Te Ching, in which the Taoist "seeks to use his power to control and govern the world (Creel)."&lt;ref&gt;Creel 1970, What Is Taoism?, 73-78&lt;/ref&gt;

==Taoist usage==
In the Taoist texts, ''wu wei'' ({{lang|zh|[[Wikt:無|無]]}} {{lang|zh|[[Wikt:爲|爲]]}}) is often associated with water and its yielding nature.  In illustration, it can assume any form or shape it inhabits.

''Wu'' may be translated as ''not have'' or ''without''; ''Wei'' may be translated as ''do, act, serve as, govern ''or'' effort''. The literal meaning of ''wu wei'' is "without action", "without effort", or "without control",  and is often included in the paradox '''''wei wu wei''''': "action without action" or "effortless doing". The practice of ''wu wei'' and the efficacy of ''wei wu wei'' are fundamental tenets in [[Chinese philosophy|Chinese thought]] and have been mostly emphasized by the [[Taoism|Taoist school]]. One cannot actively pursue ''wu wei''. It manifests as a result of cultivation. The [[Tao]] is a guide.

There is another less commonly referenced sense of ''wu wei''; "action that does not involve struggle or excessive effort". In this instance, ''wu'' means "without" and Wei means "effort". The concept of "effortless action" is a part of [[Taoism|Taoist]] [[Neijia|Internal martial arts]] such as [[T'ai chi ch'uan]], [[Baguazhang]] and [[Xingyiquan|Xing Yi]]. It follows that wu wei complies with the distinguishing feature of Taoism, that of being natural.

In [[Hitsuzendo|Zen Calligraphy]], wu wei has been represented as an ''[[ensō]]'' (circle)&lt;!-- Zen is a buddhist school. But, wu wei is a taoist concept. This is inconsistant. Moreover, mu (emptiness with the on-lecture of the Japanese character) should be the reference to interprete ensou and not wei. --&gt;; in China, the calligraphic inscriptions of the words ''wu wei'' themselves resonate with old Taoist stories.{{clarify|date=December 2013}}

Several chapters of the most important Taoist text, the ''Tao Te Ching'', attributed to [[Laozi]], allude to "diminishing doing" or "diminishing will" as the key aspect of the sage's success. [[Taoist philosophy]] recognizes that the [[Universe]] already works harmoniously according to its own ways; as a person exerts their will against or upon the world they disrupt the harmony that already exists. This is not to say that a person should not exert agency and will. Rather, it is ''how'' one acts in relation to the natural processes already existent. The ''how'', the Tao of intention and motivation, ''that'' is key.

Related translation from the ''Tao Tê Ching'' by Priya Hemenway, Chapter II:

: 2
:''The Sage is occupied with the unspoken''
:''and acts without effort.''

:''Teaching without verbosity,''
:''producing without possessing,''
:''creating without regard to result,''
:''claiming nothing,''
:''the Sage has nothing to lose.''

==Early development (political)==
{{Chinese Legalism}}
{{further information|Rectification of names|Chinese Legalism}}
[[Sinologist]] [[Herrlee G. Creel]] believed that an important clue to the development of ''wu wei'' existed in the ''[[Analects]]'', in a saying attributed to [[Confucius]], which reads: "The Master said, 'Was it not [[Emperor Shun|Shun]] who did nothing and yet ruled well? What did he do? He merely corrected his person and took his proper position as ruler'". The concept of a divine king whose "magic power" (virtue) "regulates everything in the land" (Creel) pervades early Chinese philosophy, particularly "in the early branches of Quietism that developed in the fourth century B.C."&lt;ref&gt;Creel 1970, What Is Taoism?, 58&lt;/ref&gt;

However, no government has long been able to practice "doing nothing" and stay in power.&lt;ref&gt;Creel 1970, What Is Taoism?, 48&lt;/ref&gt; Unable to find his philosopher-king, Confucius placed his hope in virtuous ministers.&lt;ref&gt;Creel 1970, What Is Taoism?, 59&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from the Confucian ruler's "divine essence" (''ling'') "ensuring the fecundity of his people" and fertility of the soil, Creel notes that he was also assisted by "five servants", who "performed the active functions of government."&lt;ref&gt;Creel 1970, What Is Taoism?, 58&lt;/ref&gt; [[Xun Kuang]]'s ''[[Xunzi (book)|Xunzi]]'', a Confucian adaptation to [[Qin (state)|Qin]] "Legalism", defines the ruler in much the same sense, saying that the ruler "need only correct his person" because the "abilities of the ruler appear in his appointment of men to office": namely, appraising virtue and causing others to perform.

More important information lay in the recovery of the fragments of administrator (aka "Legalist") Shen Buhai. Shen references [[Emperor Yao|Yao]] as using Fa (administrative method) in the selection and evaluation of men.&lt;ref&gt;Creel 1970, What Is Taoism?, 64&lt;/ref&gt; Shen used the term Wu wei to mean that the ruler, though vigilant, should not interfere with the duties of his ministers, saying "One who has the right way of government does not perform the functions of the five (aka various) officials, and yet is the master of the government".&lt;ref&gt;Creel 1970, What Is Taoism?, 48, 62-63
* S.Y. Hsieh, 1995. p.92 Chinese Thought: An Introduction https://books.google.com/books?id=-E5LZeR7QKwC&amp;pg=PA92&lt;/ref&gt; Though not a conclusive argument against proto-Taoist influence, Shen's Taoist terms do not show evidence of Taoist usage (Confucianism also uses terms like "Tao", meaning the "Tao", or "Way" of government), lacking any metaphysical connotation.&lt;ref&gt;Creel 1970, What Is Taoism?, 62-63&lt;/ref&gt; The later "Legalist" book, the [[Han Feizi]] has a commentary on the Tao Te Ching, but references Shen Buhai rather than Laozi for this usage.&lt;ref&gt;Creel 1970, What Is Taoism?, 69&lt;/ref&gt; 

Since the bulk of both the ''Tao Te Ching'' and the ''Zhuangzi'' appear to have been composed later, Creel argued that it may therefore be assumed that Shen influenced them,&lt;ref&gt;Creel 1970, What Is Taoism?, 48, 62-63
* S.Y. Hsieh, 1995. p.92 Chinese Thought: An Introduction https://books.google.com/books?id=-E5LZeR7QKwC&amp;pg=PA92&lt;/ref&gt; much of both appearing to be counter-arguments against "Legalist" controls.&lt;ref&gt;Creel 1970, What Is Taoism?, 69&lt;/ref&gt; The thirteenth chapter of the Zhuangzi, "T'ien Tao", seems to follow Shen Buhai down to the detail, saying "Superiors must be without action in-order to control the world; inferiors must be active in-order to be employed in the world's business..." and to paraphrase, that foundation and principle are the responsibility of the superior, superstructure and details that of the minister, but then goes on to attack Shen's administrative details as non-essential.&lt;ref&gt;Creel 1970, What Is Taoism?, 71&lt;/ref&gt; 

Elsewhere the Zhuangzi references another "Legalist", [[Shen Dao]], as impartial and lacking selfishness, his "great way embracing all things".&lt;ref&gt;Antonio S. Cua 2003 p.362, Encyclopedia of Chinese Philosophy&lt;/ref&gt;

"Legalism" dominated the intellectual life of the Qin and early Han together with Taoism. Early Han dynasty Emperors like [[Emperor Jing of Han|Emperor Jing]] (r. 157–141 BCE) would be steeped in a Taoistic laissez-faire.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, Chad, "Daoism", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2014 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2014/entries/daoism/&lt;/ref&gt; But Shen Buhai's book would be widely studied even from the beginning of the Han era.&lt;ref&gt;Creel, 1974 p.35. Shen Pu-hai: A Chinese Political Philosopher of the Fourth Century B.C.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jia Yi]]'s (200–168 AD) Hsin-shu, undoubtedly influenced by the "Legalists", describes Shen Buhai's techniques as methods of applying the Tao, or virtue, bringing together Confucian and Taoist discourses under the imagery of the Zhuangzi.&lt;ref&gt;MARK CSIKSZENTMIHALYI p.49,65. Chia I's "Techniques of the Tao" and the Han Confucian Appropriation of Technical Discourse. Asia Major, THIRD SERIES, Vol. 10, No. 1/2 (1997), pp. 49-67 https://www.jstor.org/stable/41645528&lt;/ref&gt; Many later texts, for instance in [[Huang-Lao]], use similar images to describe the quiescent attitude of the ruler.&lt;ref name="ARK CSIKSZENTMIHALYI p 1997 pp. 49-67"&gt;ARK CSIKSZENTMIHALYI p.55. Chia I's "Techniques of the Tao" and the Han Confucian Appropriation of Technical Discourse. Asia Major, THIRD SERIES, Vol. 10, No. 1/2 (1997), pp. 49-67 https://www.jstor.org/stable/41645528&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Huang-Lao ''[[Huainanzi]]'' (Western Han Dynasty 206 B.C. – 9 A.D.), arguing against Legalist centralization, would go on to include naturalist arguments in favour of rule by worthies on the basis that one needs their competence for such things as diplomacy, and defines wu-wei as follows: "What is meant ... by wu-wei is that no personal prejudice [private or public will,] interferes with the universal Tao [the laws of things], and that no desires and obsessions lead the true course ... astray. Reason must guide action in order that power may be exercised according to the intrinsic properties and natural trends of things."&lt;ref&gt;John M. Hobson, The Eastern Origins of Western Civilisation (Cambridge 2004), p. 190.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Yin yoga''' is a slow-paced style of [[yoga]] with postures, or ''[[asanas]]'', that are held for longer periods of time—for beginners, it may range from 45 seconds to two minutes; more advanced practitioners may stay in one ''asana'' for five minutes or more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= |title= Slow stretch, side of soul: Tight muscles, tough thoughts demand attention at Yin yoga |last1= Loriggio |first1= Paola |last2= |first2= |date= |work= |publisher= Toronto Star |accessdate=January 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yin yoga poses apply moderate stress to the [[connective tissue]]s of the body—the tendons, fascia, and ligaments—with the aim of increasing circulation in the joints and improving flexibility. A more meditative approach to yoga, yin aims at cultivating awareness of inner silence, and bringing to light a universal, interconnecting quality.&lt;ref name="Yoga Journal"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sexton|first1=Michael|title=YJ Interview: The Delight of Insight|url=http://www.yogajournal.com/article//yj-interview-delight-insight/|website=YogaJournal.com|publisher=Yoga Journal|accessdate=16 November 2014|date=Nov 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Roots in India and China===
The practice of holding yoga postures or ''asanas'' for extended periods of time has always been a significant part of traditional yoga practice, both in the hatha yoga tradition of India and in the Taoist yoga tradition of the greater China area. Contemporary schools of hatha yoga have also advocated holding some poses for relatively long periods of time. For example, [[B. K. S. Iyengar|BKS Iyengar]] recommended holding the [[Supta Virasana|Supta Virasana asana]] (reclining hero pose) for 10–15 minutes.&lt;ref name=Bernie/&gt;{{rp|12}} For that matter, long-held stretches have been and are commonly recommended in other physical disciplines, such as gymnastics and dance, to increase flexibility. For example, ballerinas are commonly counselled to open their hips by approximating the splits position for long periods of time.&lt;ref name=Bernie/&gt;{{rp|28}}

Taoist yoga practices from China also included yin-style poses in the Taoist system of "[[Neidan|Internal Alchemy]]"—practiced for the purpose of improving health and longevity.&lt;ref name=Bernie/&gt;{{rp|15}} Techniques for stretching of this type have been practiced for centuries in China and Taiwan as part of Taoist yoga, which was sometimes known as Dao Yin. Taoist priests taught long-held poses, along with breathing techniques, to [[Kung Fu]] practitioners beginning 2000 years ago, to help them fully develop their martial arts skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= The Lost Art of Flexibility |author= Michael Gonzales |newspaper= Black Belt Magazine |page= 66|date= Dec 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Beginnings in the West===
[[File:Paulie Zink--Yin Yoga--BEST.jpg|thumb|Paulie Zink]]The practice of performing series of long-held floor poses one after the other was first introduced in North America in the late 1970s by Paulie Zink, a martial arts champion and Taoist yoga teacher and practitioner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Solan|first1=Matthew|title=Talking shop with Paul Grilley|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vOkDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA24&amp;lpg=PA24&amp;dq=paulie+zink+taoist+yoga&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Qf962iwmla&amp;sig=es9JjKkdxEJOQyHtU48nKMdEToE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Y9OxU-bkDpPZoASc7oCADQ&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwBDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=paulie%20zink%20taoist%20yoga&amp;f=false|website=Google Books|publisher=Yoga Journal|accessdate=June 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zink trained for 10 years, during the 1970s, in daily private classes with Cho Chat Ling, a Kung-Fu and Taoist yoga master from Hong Kong specializing in ''Tai shing pek kwar,'' or Monkey Kung Fu. (In Kung Fu, the movements of animals are closely studied and emulated, inspiring many of the movements taught in Kung Fu.) At the end of the decade, Zink entered the Long Beach International Karate Championships in 1981, 1982 and 1983 and won Grand Champion in the "weapons forms" category in all three years, and was also Grand Champion in the "empty hands" category in two of those years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Long Beach Internationals|author= David W Clary |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=39YDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA50&amp;dq=A+Final+Farewell+to+Ed+Parker&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=SDz2UJ_BL8eViALX-oCoBQ&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=A%20Final%20Farewell%20to%20Ed%20Parker&amp;f=false |page= 82|newspaper= Black Belt Magazine |date= Nov 1991|quote=|accessdate=January 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Black Belt magazine named him Kung Fu artist of the year in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Black Belt Hall of Fame Awards: Awards to Date|author= |page= 59|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=OdYDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA5&amp;dq=Black+Belt+Hall+of+Fame+Awards+august+1991&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=QoD5UNG8MObziwKa7oGYBw&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Black%20Belt%20Hall%20of%20Fame%20Awards%20august%201991&amp;f=false|newspaper= Black Belt Magazine |date= August 1991|accessdate=January 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Noted in the Kung Fu community for his exceptional personal flexibility,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Table of contents|author= |page= 5 |newspaper= Black Belt Magazine |date= December 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zink also emphasized flexibility training in his martial arts classes as a method to develop agility, power and endurance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= The Lost Art of Flexibility |author= Michael Gonzales |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=bdIDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA5&amp;dq=%22the+lost+art+of+flexibility%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=RoP5UNC_OsOmigK4rYGgCg&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22the%20lost%20art%20of%20flexibility%22&amp;f=false|page= 66 |newspaper= Black Belt Magazine |date= Dec 1983|accessdate=January 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 70s, Zink began, separate from his martial arts classes, to teach a synthesis of hatha yoga with a range of disciplines from Taoist Yoga, as well as postures, movements and insights that he had developed himself. He later called this synthesis "Yin and Yang yoga," or often "Yin yoga" for short.&lt;ref name=Bernie/&gt;{{rp|19}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kragie|first1=Eileen|title=Yin yoga: The Complete Art Form Founded by Paulie Zink|journal=Elephant Journal|date=June 27, 2014|url=http://www.elephantjournal.com/2014/06/yin-yoga-the-complete-art-form-founded-by-master-paulie-zink-eileen-kragie/|accessdate=3 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="yogamagazine1"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.yogamagazine.com/yin-yoga/|title= Yin yoga |last1= Zink |first1= Paulie|last2= Zink|first2= Maria|date= March 2012|work= |publisher= Yoga Magazine |accessdate=January 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paulie Zink, even more than his master, was convinced of the effectiveness of holding yoga poses for long periods of time in order to improve flexibility.&lt;ref name=Bernie/&gt;{{rp|20}}

In his first years of teaching, many of Zink's students were martial artists who had developed strong but tight muscles, and he taught them only beginner level Taoist yoga, focusing on long-held yin poses to allieviate their lack of flexibility. However, as more students came he began to teach more advanced levels. He explained that in order to develop full flexibility, the student must restore his own primal nature, through several Taoist yoga practices, as follows: yin ''asanas''— mostly sitting or lying postures; yang ''asanas''— more active, strenuous postures; Taoist Flow yoga— both yin and yang yoga postures practiced in continuous, smooth and circular motions; ''Chi Kung'' (or Qigong)— involving simple and gentle movement and breathing techniques; and Taoist alchemy— based upon the Taoist theory of the five elements used in Chinese medicine.&lt;ref name=Bernie/&gt;{{rp|19}} &lt;ref name="yogamagazine1"/&gt; Taoist Alchemy is a method of embodying the energetic attributes of various animals and enlivening the five alchemical elements believed to be contained in the body's energetic field. The five transforming energies of Earth, Metal, Water, Wood, and Fire animate distinct qualities in the body such as calm, strength, fluidity, springiness and lightness, respectively.

===Paul Grilley and Sarah Powers===
Paul Grilley, a yoga teacher who later became a major proponent of Yin yoga,&lt;ref name="Lisa Maria 82"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Achy Joints? How Yin Yoga Can Help"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jill|first1=Paget|title=Yin yoga--A Brief Introduction|journal=Yoga Scotland|date=January 2013|page=9|url=http://www.yogascotland.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Yoga-40-Cover.pdf|quote= Paul Grilley, the teacher who has brought the yin way of practising yoga to prominence, has very aptly described yin YToga as "A quiet Practice."}}&lt;/ref&gt; first saw Paulie Zink on a public access television talk show in California in 1988, performing a demonstration of Taoist yoga practices that he used in teaching martial arts. Impressed by both his exceptional physical flexibility and his gentle, restrained manner, absent the arrogance he had observed in other martial artists, he sought Zink out and studied with him for about one year.&lt;ref name= Grilley&gt;{{cite book |last= Grilley|first= Paul|authorlink= |title= yin Yoga: Principles and Practice, 10th anniversary edition|url= |accessdate= |year= 2012|publisher= White Cloud Press|location= Ashland Oregon|isbn= 9781935952701|page= xiii|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Earlier, Grilley had formally studied anatomy for two years in his home state, Montana, under Dr. Garry Parker. He moved to California and continued studying anatomy at UCLA. There, he also regularly taught hatha yoga for several years—active forms including Ashtanga and Bikram's--and managed a yoga studio.&lt;ref name=Bernie/&gt;{{rp|21}} In 1989, Grilley met Hiroshi Motoyama, a Japanese scholar and yogi,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Maria|first1=Lisa|title=Soothe Yourself|url=http://www.yogajournal.com/practice/2677|accessdate=30 June 2014|publisher=Yoga Journal|date=Sep 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; who had researched the physiology of Traditional Chinese Medicine and written on it extensively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jill|first1=Paget|title=Yin yoga--A Brief Introduction|journal=Yoga Scotland|date=January 2013|page=9|url=http://www.yogascotland.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Yoga-40-Cover.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Motoyama was especially interested in the physiology of the meridians, or subtle pathways and vessels, and the ''qi'' or subtle energy hypothesized to flow through or get stored in them. These are both fundamental concepts in Chinese medicine and acupuncture. He related these to the parallel concepts of the ''nadi'' pathways and ''chakras'' of Indian yoga, and the ''prana'' said to be carried within them.&lt;ref name=GrilleyYJ&gt;{{cite news |title= Yin yoga |author= Paul Grilley |url= http://www.yogajournal.com/practice/580 |pages= 80–90|newspaper= Yoga Journal|date= July–August 2001|quote= |accessdate=January 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Grilley now began to teach a fusion of the Yin poses he had learned from Zink with his own knowledge of hatha yoga and anatomy, and the teachings of Motoyama.&lt;ref name=Bernie/&gt;{{rp|22}} &lt;ref name="yogajournal82 q"/&gt; He created yin sequences with aims similar to that of an acupuncturist.&lt;ref name=Soothe&gt;{{cite news |title= Soothe Yourself|author= Lisa Maria|url= http://www.yogajournal.com/practice/2677|page= 85|newspaper= Yoga Journal|date= Sep 2008|quote= Around the same time that Grilley was studying with Zink, he did a brief stint in acupuncture school . . . . working with Hiroshi Motoyama, . . .

One of Grilley's students, Sarah Powers, also a yoga teacher, began teaching yoga in Grilley's style. She incorporated Buddhist psychology in her teaching of Yin yoga and put even more emphasis on targeting the meridian systems for health and enlightenment than did Grilley. Much of her book, ''Insight Yoga,'' is devoted to an explanation of Yin yoga sequences designed to enhance the flow of ''qi'' as understood in Traditional Chinese Medicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Maria|first1=Lisa|title=Insider's Guide--A veteran teacher explores the depths of yoga and self-inquiry, creating a manual for inner peace|journal=Yoga Journal|date=Feb 2009|pages=111–112}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=August 2015}} She also emphasized a conscious and systematic approach to breathing during yin practice.&lt;ref name= Powers&gt;{{cite book |last= Powers|first= Sarah|authorlink= |title= Insight Yoga|url= |accessdate= |year= 2008|publisher= Shambala|location= Boston|isbn= 978-1-59030-598-0|page= |pages= 26–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Grilley at first called it Taoist yoga, in deference to the term Paulie Zink had used. Sarah Powers pointed out that the yoga she and Grilley were teaching was different from the Taoist practice being taught by Zink. She suggested they use the term Yin yoga, to differentiate it from the various forms of Taoist yoga being taught. She and Grilley adopted the name.&lt;ref name=Bernie/&gt;{{rp|22}} Later, Paulie Zink also began calling his teachings Yin yoga, though as a short form for his preferred term, "Yin and Yang Yoga."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kragie|first1=Eileen|title=Yin yoga: The Complete Art Form Founded by Paulie Zink|journal=Elephant Journal|date=June 27, 2014|url=http://www.elephantjournal.com/2014/06/yin-yoga-the-complete-art-form-founded-by-master-paulie-zink-eileen-kragie/|accessdate=3 July 2015 | quote =Paulie refers to his art as Yin and Yang yoga, but often uses the term “Yin yoga” for short.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Teaching spreads===
Sarah Powers, already a renowned yoga teacher who traveled widely giving yoga workshops, now began also teaching Yin yoga in her tours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Clarke|first1=Bernie|title=Original Yin|url=http://www.yinyoga.com/ys1_1.1_original_yin.php|website=YinYoga.com - The Home Page of Yin yoga|publisher=yinyoga.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; When her students asked for more information, she would refer them to Paul Grilley, who began receiving requests to travel and offer seminars. Paulie Zink continued teaching Yin yoga in his own style, combined with other elements of Taoist yoga. Powers and Grilley began offering Yin yoga teacher training courses, as did Paulie Zink. Over the next 10 years, Yin yoga became available all over North America and in Europe, through yoga classes, and via DVDs and  books.&lt;ref name=kinosian/&gt; In 2002, Grilley published the book, ''Yin yoga: A Quiet Practice'' (and in 2012 a revised edition titled, ''Yin yoga Principles and Practice''). In 2006, Biff Mithoefer, a student of Grilley and Powers, published The Yin yoga Kit, which included a detailed volume of instruction as well as a DVD. In 2008, Sarah Powers published the book, ''Insight Yoga,'' which teaches Yin yoga sequences and more active (or yang) yoga sequences as a complement to yin poses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Insider's Guide |author= Lisa Maria |page=111|newspaper= Yoga Journal |date= February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bernie Clark, also a student of Grilley and Powers, began the website, yinyoga.com, in 2006 and published his book, ''The Complete Guide to Yin yoga'' in 2012. Both Grilley and Powers have also released instructional DVDs on Yin yoga, as has Paulie Zink.

Grilley’s approach has a physical and an energetic aspect. He discovered the physical aspect when he met Taoist Yoga and martial arts teacher Paulie Zink and was immediately inspired. “I’d pretty much exhausted the power of vinyasa, Bikram—you know, anything heavy, hot, and sweaty, I’d already done it,” Grilley says. “Paulie’s practice was like a huge breath of fresh air, because his approach to the postures was first yin on the floor and then yang, and neither of them was that similar to my previous practice.|accessdate=January 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;—that primarily affect the lower part of the body—the hips, pelvis, inner thighs, lower spine—about 18 - 24 in number.

Yin yoga employs specific sequences of poses aimed at stimulating particular meridians, or subtle channels, as understood in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM),&lt;ref name= Surrender&gt;{{cite news |title= Sweet Surrender|author= Andrea Ferretti |url= http://www.yogajournal.com/practice/2545|newspaper= Yoga Journal |date= June 2007|accessdate=January 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the far eastern counterpart of India's [[Ayurveda]]; the system of medicine claims that there are energy channels of the subtle body, called ''nadi'' (Sanskrit for "stream"), with the ''ida'', ''pingala'', and ''sushumna'' as the principal or most important ''nadis''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tantra-kundalini.com/nadis.htm|title=Tantra-Kundalini.com - Nadis of the subtle body|website=Tantra Kundalini|access-date=2016-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=August 2015}}

During the long hold times of the yin asanas, teachers usually give "dharma talks," informal monologues drawing from a variety of sources, according to teachers' choice. They will often explain the physiology and anatomy of poses, including the location of the meridian lines being affected. They may tell traditional Buddhist stories, recite poetry, sing songs, or reflect on their own experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Powers|first=Sarah|title=Insight Yoga (DVD)|year=2005|publisher=Pranamaya, Inc.|isbn=978-0-9763836-5-9|chapter=Introduction to Yin yoga}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In keeping with its roots in Taoist yoga, Paulie Zink says that Yin yoga has a deeper purpose: to "open the heart and invoke the primal self."&lt;ref name="yogamagazine1"/&gt; Sarah Powers says one of the primary objectives of yin practice is the cultivation of inner stillness.&lt;ref name="Yoga Journal"/&gt;

==Principles==

===Yin and yang===
Yin yoga is based on the Taoist concepts of yin and yang, opposite and complementary principles in nature. Yin could be described as stable, immobile, feminine, passive, cold, and downward moving. Yang is understood to be changing, mobile, masculine, active, hot, and upward moving. The sun is considered yang, the moon yin.&lt;ref name=About&gt;{{cite web |url= http://yoga.about.com/od/typesofyoga/a/Yin-Yoga.htm|title= Yin yoga |last1= Pizer |first1= Ann |last2= |first2= |date= May 17, 2012 |work= |publisher= about.com Yoga |accessdate=January 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=August 2015}} In the body, the relatively stiff connective tissues (tendons, ligaments, fascia) are yin, while the more mobile and pliable muscles and blood are yang. More passive asanas in yoga are considered yin, whereas the more active, dynamic asanas are yang, because they stimulate the muscles and generate heat.&lt;ref name="yogajournal82"&gt;{{cite news |title= Soothe Yourself|author= Lisa Maria|url= http://www.yogajournal.com/practice/2677|page= 82|newspaper= Yoga Journal|date= Sep 2008|quote= |accessdate=January 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=August 2015}}

===Distinction from hatha yoga===
Although many Yin yoga poses or ''asanas'' closely resemble the ''asanas'' in Indian hatha yoga, they have different names, in part to alert those who are familiar with similar poses in hatha yoga not to perform them in the same way.&lt;ref name=About/&gt; In general, the poses of Yin yoga are performed with very little muscular exertion. For example, in the Seal pose, in which a practitioner lies face down and then raises the trunk upward, the upward movement is gradual and entirely supported by the arms, and the legs are relaxed. But in the Cobra or ''Bhujangasana'' of hatha yoga, the practitioner actively curves the spine upward in an arc using arms and lower back muscles, and reaches back with the legs strongly.&lt;ref name="yogajournal87"/&gt;

===Physiology===
Muscles account for about forty percent of the resistance against the body's flexibility, while connective tissue accounts for about fifty percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://yinyoga.com/ys1_2.2.1.1_limits_flexibility.php |title= Limits of Flexibility |last1= Clark |first1= Bernie |last2= |first2= |date= |work= |publisher= YinYoga.com |accessdate=8 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=August 2015}} The intensity and physical benefits of Yin yoga practice depend on two variables: duration of the asana, and the temperature of the muscle. Asanas are usually held for five minutes, but can be held for as long as twenty. Because of the long duration of asanas, it is said that patience is another of the key values cultivated by Yin yoga.
 
It is usually recommended that Yin yoga be practiced when the muscles are not yet warmed up. When the muscles are cold, they are less elastic, and more stress will be transferred to the connective tissue. However, this is a general rule and for some people, it is better to stay a bit warm while practicing. Because this style of yoga does not generate bodily heat, yin teachers recommend keeping the temperature of the room a little higher than usual.&lt;ref name="Bernie"/&gt;{{rp|33}} During yin asanas, muscles are relaxed to avoid [[tetany]], or muscle spasm, which could result from engaging muscles for long periods.
