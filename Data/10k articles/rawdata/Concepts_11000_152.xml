      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2745">'''2nd Amendment Day''' is a public [[awareness day]] observed in the United States. Its purpose is to raise awareness of and support for the [[fundamental right]] to [[Right to keep and bear arms in the United States|keep and bear arms]], which is codified in the [[Second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Second Amendment]] to the [[United States Constitution]]. This amendment, along with the nine [[List of amendments to the United States Constitution|others]] [[Ratification#Ratification in the United States Constitution|ratified]] on December 15, 1791, comprise the Constitution's [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/second_amendment|title=Second Amendment|work=cornell.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Observances==
[[Oklahoma]] observes 2nd Amendment Day on June 28.{{Verify source|date=October 2015}} This is because the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] ruled in favor of the 2nd Amendment in the case of ''[[McDonald v. City of Chicago]]'' on June 28, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bearingarms.com/oklahoma-legislature-approves-second-amendment-day/|title=Oklahoma Legislature Approves Second Amendment Day|work=Bearing Arms}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[South Carolina]] legislators passed the Second Amendment Education Act, which is a two-fold move to protect [[Gun politics in the United States|gun rights]] in state schools.{{Verify source|date=October 2015}} First, it would establish Second Amendment Awareness Day each year on Dec. 15. The day would be highlighted by a poster and essay contest in which students of all grades would be encouraged to submit entries on the theme of “The Right to Bear Arms; One American Right Protecting All Others.” From the submissions, the South Carolina Legislative Sportsmen’s Caucus would select statewide winners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guns.com/2014/12/30/lawmaker-proposes-gun-rights-education-for-south-carolina-public-schools-video/|title=Lawmaker proposes gun rights education for South Carolina public schools (VIDEO)|work=Guns.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Definition and symptoms --&gt;
'''Borderline personality disorder''' ('''BPD'''), also known as '''emotionally unstable personality disorder''' ('''EUPD'''),&lt;ref name=NICEGuidelines2009&gt;{{cite book|title=Borderline personality disorder NICE Clinical Guidelines, No. 78|date=2009|publisher=British Psychological Society|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK55415/|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a long-term pattern of abnormal behavior characterized by unstable [[interpersonal relationships|relationships with other people]], unstable [[self-image|sense of self]] and unstable [[affect (psychology)|emotions]].&lt;ref name=NIH2016/&gt;&lt;ref name=DSM5/&gt; There is often dangerous behavior and [[self-harm]].&lt;ref name=NIH2016/&gt; People may also struggle with a feeling of emptiness and a fear of [[Abandonment (emotional)|abandonment]].&lt;ref name=NIH2016/&gt; Symptoms may be brought on by seemingly normal events.&lt;ref name=NIH2016/&gt; The behavior typically begins by early adulthood and occurs across a variety of situations.&lt;ref name=DSM5&gt;{{cite book|title=Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders : DSM-5|date=2013|publisher=American Psychiatric Publishing|location=Washington [etc.]|isbn=9780890425558|pages=645, 663–6|edition=5th}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Substance abuse]], [[Depression (mood)|depression]], and [[eating disorder]]s are commonly associated with BPD.&lt;ref name=NIH2016/&gt; Up to 10% of people affected die by [[suicide]].&lt;ref name=NIH2016/&gt;&lt;ref name=DSM5/&gt;

&lt;!-- Cause, mechanism, diagnosis --&gt;
BPD's causes are unclear but seem to involve genetic, brain, environmental and social factors.&lt;ref name=NIH2016/&gt;&lt;ref name=CP2013&gt;{{Cite book|title=Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Borderline Personality Disorder|last=|first=|publisher=National Health and Medical Research Council|year=2013|isbn=978-1864965643|location=Melbourne|pages=40–41|quote=In addition to the evidence identified by the systematic review, the Committee also considered a recent narrative review of studies that have evaluated biological and environmental factors as potential risk factors for BPD (including prospective studies of children and adolescents, and studies of young people with BPD)}}&lt;/ref&gt; It occurs about five times more often in a person who has an affected close relative.&lt;ref name=NIH2016&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/borderline-personality-disorder/index.shtml|title=Borderline Personality Disorder|website=NIMH|access-date=16 March 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160322130612/http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/borderline-personality-disorder/index.shtml|archivedate=22 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adverse life events also appear to play a role.&lt;ref name=Lei2011/&gt; The underlying mechanism appears to involve the [[Limbic system|frontolimbic]] network of [[neuron]]s.&lt;ref name=Lei2011&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Leichsenring|first1=F|last2=Leibing|first2=E|last3=Kruse|first3=J|last4=New|first4=AS|last5=Leweke|first5=F|title=Borderline personality disorder.|journal=Lancet|date=1 January 2011|volume=377|issue=9759|pages=74–84|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(10)61422-5|pmid=21195251}}&lt;/ref&gt; BPD is recognized by the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' (DSM) as a [[personality disorder]], along with nine other such disorders.&lt;ref name=DSM5/&gt; Diagnosis is based on the symptoms, while a medical examination may be done to rule out other problems.&lt;ref name=NIH2016/&gt; The condition must be differentiated from an [[identity disorder|identity problem]] or [[substance use disorders]], among other possibilities.&lt;ref name=DSM5/&gt;

&lt;!-- Treatment --&gt;
Borderline personality disorder is typically treated with [[psychotherapy|therapy]], such as [[cognitive behavioral therapy]] (CBT).&lt;ref name=NIH2016/&gt; Another type, [[dialectical behavior therapy]] (DBT), may reduce the risk of suicide.&lt;ref name=NIH2016/&gt; Therapy may occur one-on-one, or in a [[group therapy|group]].&lt;ref name=NIH2016/&gt; While medications do not cure BPD, they may be used to help with the associated symptoms.&lt;ref name=NIH2016/&gt; Some people require care in hospital.&lt;ref name=NIH2016/&gt;

&lt;!-- Epidemiology, prognosis, and culture --&gt;
About 1.6% of people have BPD in a given year.&lt;ref name=NIH2016/&gt; Females are diagnosed about three times as often as males.&lt;ref name=DSM5/&gt; It appears to become less common among older people.&lt;ref name=DSM5/&gt; Up to half of people improve over a ten-year period.&lt;ref name=DSM5/&gt; People affected typically use a high amount of healthcare resources.&lt;ref name=DSM5/&gt; There is an ongoing debate about the naming of the disorder, especially the suitability of the word ''borderline''.&lt;ref name=NIH2016/&gt; The disorder is often stigmatized in both the media and the psychiatric field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Aviram|first1=RB|last2=Brodsky|first2=BS|last3=Stanley|first3=B|title=Borderline personality disorder, stigma, and treatment implications.|journal=Harvard Review of Psychiatry|date=2006|volume=14|issue=5|pages=249–56|pmid=16990170|doi=10.1080/10673220600975121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==
Borderline personality disorder may be characterized by the following signs and symptoms:
* Markedly [[identity disturbance|disturbed sense of identity]]
* Frantic efforts to avoid real or imagined [[abandonment (emotional)|abandonment]] and extreme reactions to such
* [[Splitting (psychology)|Splitting]] ("black-and-white" thinking)
* [[Impulsivity]] and impulsive or dangerous behaviors
* Intense or uncontrollable emotional reactions that often seem disproportionate to the event or situation
* Unstable and chaotic interpersonal relationships
* [[Self-destructive behavior|Self-damaging behavior]]
* Distorted [[self-image]]&lt;ref name=NIH2016/&gt;
* [[Dissociation (psychology)|Dissociation]]
* Frequently accompanied by [[depression (mood)|depression]], [[anxiety]], [[anger]], [[substance abuse]], or [[rage (emotion)|rage]]
The most distinguishing symptoms of BPD are marked [[Social rejection#Rejection sensitivity|sensitivity to rejection]] or criticism, and intense fear of possible abandonment.&lt;ref name=Gund2011/&gt; Overall, the features of BPD include unusually intense sensitivity in relationships with others, difficulty regulating emotions, and impulsivity. Fear of abandonment may lead to overlapping dating relationships as a new relationship is developed to  protect against abandonment in the existing relationship.  Other symptoms may include feeling unsure of one's [[personal identity]], morals, and values; having paranoid thoughts when feeling stressed; depersonalization; and, in moderate to severe cases, stress-induced breaks with reality or psychotic episodes.

===Emotions===
People with BPD may feel emotions with greater ease, depth and for a longer time than others do.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Linehan|1993|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Manning_36&gt;{{harvnb|Manning|2011|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; A core characteristic of BPD is affective instability, which generally manifests as unusually intense emotional responses to environmental triggers, with a slower return to a baseline emotional state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hooley|first1=Jill|last2=Butcher|first2=James|last3=Nock|first3=Matthew|last4=Mineka|first4=Susan|title=Abnormal Psychology|date=2017|publisher=Pearson Education, Inc.|isbn=9780133852059|page=359|edition=17th}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Linehan_45&gt;{{harvnb|Linehan|1993|page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; People with BPD often engage in [[idealization and devaluation]] of others, alternating between high positive regard for people and great disappointment in them.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Linehan|1993|page=146}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Marsha Linehan]]'s view, the sensitivity, intensity, and duration with which people with BPD feel emotions have both positive and negative effects.&lt;ref name = Linehan_45 /&gt; People with BPD are often exceptionally enthusiastic, idealistic, joyful, and loving.&lt;ref name = Linehan_44&gt;{{harvnb|Linehan|1993|page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, they may feel overwhelmed by negative emotions ("anxiety, depression, guilt/shame, worry, anger, etc."), experiencing intense [[grief]] instead of sadness, shame and humiliation instead of mild embarrassment, rage instead of annoyance, and panic instead of nervousness.&lt;ref name = Linehan_44 /&gt;

People with BPD are also especially sensitive to feelings of rejection, criticism, isolation, and perceived failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Stiglmayr CE, Grathwol T, Linehan MM, Ihorst G, Fahrenberg J, Bohus M|title=Aversive tension in patients with borderline personality disorder: a computer-based controlled field study|journal=Acta Psychiatr Scand|volume=111|issue=5|pages=372–9|date=May 2005|doi=10.1111/j.1600-0447.2004.00466.x|pmid=15819731}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before learning other coping mechanisms, their efforts to manage or escape from their very negative emotions may lead to [[emotional isolation]], [[#Self-harm and suicide|self-injury or suicidal behavior]].&lt;ref name = reasons_NSSI /&gt; They are often aware of the intensity of their negative emotional reactions and, since they cannot regulate them, they shut them down entirely.&lt;ref name=Linehan_45 /&gt; This can be harmful to people with BPD, since negative emotions alert people to the presence of a problematic situation and move them to address it which the person with BPD would normally be aware of only to cause further distress.&lt;ref name=Linehan_45 /&gt; People with BPD may feel emotional relief after cutting themselves.&lt;ref name=DucasseCourtet2014&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ducasse|first1=Déborah|last2=Courtet|first2=Philippe|last3=Olié|first3=Emilie|title=Physical and Social Pains in Borderline Disorder and Neuroanatomical Correlates: A Systematic Review|journal=Current Psychiatry Reports|volume=16|issue=5|year=2014|doi=10.1007/s11920-014-0443-2|pmid=24633938|page=443}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While people with BPD feel [[euphoria]] (ephemeral or occasional intense joy), they are especially prone to [[dysphoria]] (a profound state of unease or dissatisfaction), depression, and/or feelings of mental and emotional distress. Zanarini et al. recognized four categories of dysphoria that are typical of this condition: extreme emotions, destructiveness or self-destructiveness, feeling fragmented or lacking identity, and feelings of [[victimization]].&lt;ref name = dysphoria&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Zanarini MC, Frankenburg FR, DeLuca CJ, Hennen J, Khera GS, Gunderson JG |title=The pain of being borderline: dysphoric states specific to borderline personality disorder |journal=Harv Rev Psychiatry |volume=6 |issue=4 |pages=201–7 |year=1998 |pmid=10370445 |doi=10.3109/10673229809000330}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within these categories, a BPD diagnosis is strongly associated with a combination of three specific states: feeling betrayed, feeling out of control, and "feeling like hurting myself".&lt;ref name=dysphoria /&gt; Since there is great variety in the types of dysphoria experienced by people with BPD, the amplitude of the distress is a helpful indicator of borderline personality disorder.&lt;ref name=dysphoria /&gt; In addition to intense emotions, people with BPD experience emotional "lability"; or in other words, changeability. Although the term emotional lability suggests rapid changes between depression and elation, the mood swings in people with this condition actually fluctuate more frequently between anger and [[anxiety]] and between depression and anxiety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Koenigsberg HW, Harvey PD, Mitropoulou V|title=Characterizing affective instability in borderline personality disorder|journal=Am J Psychiatry |volume=159 |issue=5 |pages=784–8 |date=May 2002|doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.159.5.784|pmid=11986132|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Behavior===
Impulsive behavior is common, including [[substance abuse|substance]] or [[alcohol abuse]], [[eating disorder]]s, [[unprotected sex]] or [[promiscuity|indiscriminate sex with multiple partners]], [[spendthrift|reckless spending]], and [[reckless driving]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=National Education Alliance for Borderline Personality Disorder|title=A BPD Brief|url=http://new.borderlinepersonalitydisorder.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/A_BPD_Brief_REV2011.pdf|accessdate=30 June 2013|page=4|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120912024603/http://new.borderlinepersonalitydisorder.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/A_BPD_Brief_REV2011.pdf|archivedate=12 September 2012|deadurl=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; Impulsive behavior may also include leaving jobs or relationships, running away, and self-injury.&lt;ref name=Manning_18/&gt; People with BPD act impulsively because it gives them the feeling of immediate relief from their [[emotional pain]].&lt;ref name=Manning_18/&gt; However, in the long term, people with BPD suffer increased pain from the shame and guilt that follow such actions.&lt;ref name=Manning_18&gt;{{harvnb|Manning|2011|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; A cycle often begins in which people with BPD feel emotional pain, engage in impulsive behavior to relieve that pain, feel shame and guilt over their actions, feel emotional pain from the shame and guilt, and then experience stronger urges to engage in impulsive behavior to relieve the new pain.&lt;ref name=Manning_18/&gt; As time goes on, impulsive behavior may become an automatic response to emotional pain.&lt;ref name=Manning_18/&gt;

===Self-harm and suicide===
[[File:SelfHarm2017.jpg|thumb|Scars from self-harm is a common sign in borderline personality disorder.&lt;ref name=NIH2016/&gt;]]

&lt;!-- Self harm --&gt;
[[Self-harm]]ing or suicidal behavior is one of the core diagnostic criteria in the [[DSM-5]].&lt;ref name=DSM5/&gt; Self-harm occurs in 50 to 80% of people with BPD.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=Ou2008/&gt; --&gt; The most frequent method of self-harm is [[cutting]].&lt;ref name=Ou2008&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Oumaya|first1=M|last2=Friedman|first2=S|last3=Pham|first3=A|last4=Abou Abdallah|first4=T|last5=Guelfi|first5=JD|last6=Rouillon|first6=F|title=Personnalité borderline, automutilations et suicide: revue de la littérature |journal=L'Encephale |date=October 2008|volume=34|issue=5|pages=452–8|doi=10.1016/j.encep.2007.10.007|pmid=19068333 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bruising, burning, head banging or biting are not uncommon with BPD.&lt;ref name=Ou2008/&gt;

&lt;!-- Suicide --&gt;
The lifetime risk of suicide among people with BPD is between 3% and 10%.&lt;ref name=Gund2011/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gunderson |first=John G.|last2=Links|first2=Paul S.|year=2008|title=Borderline Personality Disorder: A Clinical Guide|edition=2nd|publisher=American Psychiatric Publishing, Inc|page=9|isbn=978-1585623358}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is evidence that men diagnosed with BPD are approximately twice as likely to die by suicide as women diagnosed with BPD.&lt;ref name="Kreisman J, Strauss H 2004 206"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Kreisman J, Strauss H |title=Sometimes I Act Crazy. Living With Borderline Personality Disorder | year=2004 | publisher=Wiley &amp; Sons | page=206}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also evidence that a considerable percentage of men who die by suicide may have undiagnosed BPD.&lt;ref name="Paris J 2008 21–22"&gt;{{cite book |author=Paris J |title=Treatment of Borderline Personality Disorder.

The reported reasons for self-harm differ from the reasons for suicide attempts.&lt;ref name=reasons_NSSI&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Brown MZ, Comtois KA, Linehan MM |title=Reasons for suicide attempts and nonsuicidal self-injury in women with borderline personality disorder |journal=J Abnorm Psychol |volume=111 |issue=1 |pages=198–202 |date=February 2002 |pmid=11866174 |doi=10.1037/0021-843X.111.1.198}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly 70% of people with BPD self-harm without trying to end their life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Urnes|first1=O|title=[Self-harm and personality disorders].|journal=Tidsskrift for den Norske Laegeforening : Tidsskrift for Praktisk Medicin, NY Raekke|date=30 April 2009|volume=129|issue=9|pages=872–6|pmid=19415088|doi=10.4045/tidsskr.08.0140}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reasons for self-harm include expressing anger, self-punishment, generating normal feelings (often in response to dissociation), and distracting oneself from emotional pain or difficult circumstances.&lt;ref name=reasons_NSSI /&gt; In contrast, suicide attempts typically reflect a belief that others will be better off following the suicide.&lt;ref name=reasons_NSSI /&gt; Both suicide and self-harm are a response to feeling negative emotions.&lt;ref name=reasons_NSSI /&gt; Sexual abuse can be a particular trigger for suicidal behavior in adolescents with BPD tendencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Horesh N, Sever J, Apter A |title=A comparison of life events between suicidal adolescents with major depression and borderline personality disorder |journal=Compr Psychiatry |volume=44 |issue=4 |pages=277–83 |date=July–August 2003 |pmid=12923705 |doi=10.1016/S0010-440X(03)00091-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{quantify|date=March 2014}}

===Interpersonal relationships===
People with BPD can be very sensitive to the way others treat them, by feeling intense joy and gratitude at perceived expressions of kindness, and intense sadness or anger at perceived criticism or hurtfulness.&lt;ref name="cogemo"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Arntz|first=Arnoud|date=September 2005|title=Introduction to special issue: cognition and emotion in borderline personality disorder|url=|journal=Journal of Behavior Therapy and Experimental Psychiatry|volume=36|issue=3|pages=167–72|doi=10.1016/j.jbtep.2005.06.001|pmid=16018875|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their feelings about others often shift from admiration or love to anger or dislike after a disappointment, a threat of losing someone, or a perceived loss of esteem in the eyes of someone they value. This phenomenon, sometimes called [[splitting (psychology)|splitting]], includes a shift from idealizing others to devaluing them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=What Is BPD: Symptoms |url=http://www.borderlinepersonalitydisorder.com/understading-bpd/ |accessdate=31 January 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130210110927/http://www.borderlinepersonalitydisorder.com/understading-bpd/ |archivedate=10 February 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Combined with mood disturbances, idealization and devaluation can undermine relationships with family, friends, and co-workers.&lt;ref name="Robinson"&gt;{{Cite book|last = Robinson|first = David J.| title = Disordered Personalities| publisher = Rapid Psychler Press| year = 2005| pages =255–310| isbn = 978-1-894328-09-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Self-image can also change rapidly from healthy to unhealthy.

While strongly desiring intimacy, people with BPD tend toward insecure, avoidant or ambivalent, or fearfully preoccupied [[Attachment theory#Attachment patterns|attachment patterns]] in relationships,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Levy KN, Meehan KB, Weber M, Reynoso J, Clarkin JF |title=Attachment and borderline personality disorder: implications for psychotherapy |journal=Psychopathology |volume=38 |issue=2 |pages=64–74 |year=2005 |pmid=15802944 |doi=10.1159/000084813}}&lt;/ref&gt; and they often view the world as dangerous and malevolent.&lt;ref name="cogemo"/&gt; BPD, like other personality disorders, is linked to increased levels of chronic stress and conflict in romantic relationships, decreased satisfaction on the part of romantic partners, [[domestic violence|abuse]], and unwanted [[pregnancy]].&lt;ref name="Daley SE, Burge D, Hammen C 2000 451–60"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Daley SE, Burge D, Hammen C |title=Borderline personality disorder symptoms as predictors of 4-year romantic relationship dysfunction in young women: addressing issues of specificity |journal=J Abnorm Psychol |volume=109 |issue=3 |pages=451–60 |date=August 2000 |pmid=11016115 |doi=10.1037/0021-843X.109.3.451|citeseerx=10.1.1.588.6902 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sense of self===
People with BPD tend to have trouble seeing a clear picture of their identity. In particular, they tend to have difficulty knowing what they value, believe, prefer, and enjoy.&lt;ref name=Manning_23/&gt; They are often unsure about their long-term goals for relationships and jobs. This difficulty with knowing who they are and what they value can cause people with BPD to experience feeling "empty" and "lost".&lt;ref name=Manning_23/&gt;

===Cognitions===
The often intense emotions experienced by people with BPD can make it difficult for them to control the focus of their attention—to concentrate.&lt;ref name=Manning_23&gt;{{harvnb|Manning|2011|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, people with BPD may tend to [[dissociation (psychology)|dissociate]], which can be thought of as an intense form of "zoning out".&lt;ref name=Manning_24&gt;{{harvnb|Manning|2011|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dissociation often occurs in response to experiencing a painful event (or experiencing something that triggers the memory of a painful event). It involves the mind automatically redirecting attention away from that event, presumably to protect against experiencing intense emotion and unwanted behavioral impulses that such emotion might otherwise trigger.&lt;ref name=Manning_24/&gt; Although the mind's habit of blocking out intense painful emotions may provide temporary relief, it can also have the unwanted side effect of blocking or blunting the experience of ordinary emotions, reducing the access of people with BPD to the information contained in those emotions, which helps guide effective decision-making in daily life.&lt;ref name=Manning_24/&gt; Sometimes, it is possible for another person to tell when someone with BPD is dissociating, because their facial or vocal expressions may become flat or expressionless, or they may appear to be distracted; at other times, dissociation may be barely noticeable.&lt;ref name=Manning_24/&gt;

===Disability===
Many people with BPD are able to work if they find appropriate jobs and their condition is not too severe. People with BPD may be found to have a disability in the workplace, if the condition is severe enough that the behaviors of sabotaging relationships, engaging in risky behaviors, or intense anger prevent the person from functioning in their professional role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Arvig|first1=TJ|title=Borderline personality disorder and disability|journal=AAOHN Journal|date=April 2011|volume=59|issue=4|pages=158–60|doi=10.3928/08910162-20110328-04|pmid=21462898|doi-broken-date=2018-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
As is the case with other mental disorders, the causes of BPD are complex and not fully agreed upon.&lt;ref name="mayo"&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/borderline-personality-disorder/DS00442/DSECTION=3| title = Borderline personality disorder| publisher = Mayo Clinic| accessdate = 15 May 2008| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080430112844/http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/borderline-personality-disorder/DS00442/DSECTION%3D3| archivedate = 30 April 2008| df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence suggests that BPD and [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] ([[PTSD]]) may be related in some way.&lt;ref name="BPD &amp; PTSD"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 =Gunderson | first1 = JG | last2 = Sabo | first2 = AN |title= The phenomenological and conceptual interface between borderline personality disorder and PTSD |journal= Am J Psychiatry | volume= 150 | pages = 19–27 |year=1993 |url = http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/article.aspx?articleID=169168 |pmid=8417576 |issue=1 | doi=10.1176/ajp.150.1.19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most researchers agree that a history of childhood trauma can be a contributing factor,&lt;ref name=kluft&gt;{{Cite book|title=Incest-Related Syndromes of Adult Psychopathology |first=Richard P.|last=Kluft |year=1990 |publisher=American Psychiatric Pub, Inc.|pages=83, 89 |isbn=978-0-88048-160-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; but less attention has historically been paid to investigating the causal roles played by congenital brain abnormalities, genetics, neurobiological factors, and environmental factors other than trauma.&lt;ref name="mayo" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 =Zanarini | first1 = MC | last2 = Frankenburg | first2 = FR |title=Pathways to the development of borderline personality disorder |journal=J.

Social factors include how people interact in their early development with their family, friends, and other children.&lt;ref name="Psych Central"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://psychcentral.com/lib/symptoms-of-borderline-personality-disorder/0001063|title=Borderline Personality Disorder|publisher=psychcentral.com|last=Grohol|first=John M.|date=30 January 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140527125005/http://psychcentral.com/lib/symptoms-of-borderline-personality-disorder/0001063|archivedate=27 May 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{ums|date=November 2017}} Psychological factors include the individual's personality and temperament, shaped by their environment and learned coping skills that deal with stress.&lt;ref name="Psych Central" /&gt;{{ums|date=November 2017}} These different factors together suggest that there are multiple factors that may contribute to the disorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/borderline-personality-disorder/basics/causes/con-20023204|title=Borderline personality disorder: Understanding this challenging mental illness|work=Mayo Clinic|access-date=2017-09-05|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170830073811/http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/borderline-personality-disorder/basics/causes/con-20023204|archivedate=30 August 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Genetics===
The [[heritability]] of BPD has been estimated at 40%.&lt;ref name=Her2014&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Amad|first1=A|last2=Ramoz|first2=N|last3=Thomas|first3=P|last4=Jardri|first4=R|last5=Gorwood|first5=P|title=Genetics of borderline personality disorder: systematic review and proposal of an integrative model.|journal=Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews|date=March 2014|volume=40|pages=6–19|pmid=24456942|doi=10.1016/j.neubiorev.2014.01.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; That is, 40 percent of the [[statistical variability|variability]] in liability underlying BPD in the population can be explained by [[human genetic variation|genetic differences]]. [[Twin studies]] may overestimate the effect of [[genes]] on variability in personality disorders due to the complicating factor of a shared family environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last =Torgersen | first = S |title=Genetics of patients with borderline personality disorder |journal=Psychiatr.

Families with twins in the Netherlands were participants of an ongoing study by Trull and colleagues, in which 711 pairs of siblings and 561 parents were examined to identify the location of genetic traits that influenced the development of BPD.&lt;ref name="Possible Genetic Causes"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/12/081216114100.htm|title=Possible Genetic Causes Of Borderline Personality Disorder Identified|publisher=sciencedaily.com|date=20 December 2008|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140501161311/https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/12/081216114100.htm|archivedate=1 May 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research collaborators found that genetic material on [[Chromosome 9 (human)|chromosome 9]] was linked to BPD features.&lt;ref name="Possible Genetic Causes" /&gt; The researchers concluded that "genetic factors play a major role in individual differences of borderline personality disorder features."&lt;ref name="Possible Genetic Causes" /&gt; These same researchers had earlier concluded in a previous study that 42 percent of variation in BPD features was attributable to genetic influences and 58 percent was attributable to environmental influences.&lt;ref name="Possible Genetic Causes" /&gt; Genes under investigation {{as of|2012|lc=y}} include the 7-repeat polymorphism of the [[Dopamine receptor D4|dopamine D4 receptor (DRD4)]] on [[Chromosome 11 (human)#Genes|chromosome 11]], which has been linked to disorganized attachment, whilst the combined effect of the 7-repeat polymorphism and the 10/10 dopamine transporter (DAT) genotype has been linked to abnormalities in inhibitory control, both noted features of BPD.&lt;ref name="Brain Structure and Function"&gt;{{cite journal|last=O'Neil|first=Aisling|author2=Thomas Frodl|title=Brain structure and function in borderline personality disorder|journal=Brain Structure and Function|date=18 January 2012|doi=10.1007/s00429-012-0379-4|pmid=22252376|volume=217|issue=4|pages=767–782}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a possible connection to [[Chromosome 5 (human)|chromosome 5]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lubke|first1=GH|last2=Laurin|first2=C|last3=Amin|first3=N|last4=Hottenga|first4=JJ|last5=Willemsen|first5=G|last6=van Grootheest|first6=G|last7=Abdellaoui|first7=A|last8=Karssen|first8=LC|last9=Oostra|first9=BA|last10=van Duijn|first10=CM|last11=Penninx|first11=BW|last12=Boomsma|first12=DI|title=Genome-wide analyses of borderline personality features.|journal=Molecular Psychiatry|date=August 2014|volume=19|issue=8|pages=923–9|pmid=23979607|doi=10.1038/mp.2013.109|pmc=3872258}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brain abnormalities===
A number of neuroimaging studies in BPD have reported findings of reductions in regions of the brain involved in the regulation of stress responses and emotion, affecting the hippocampus, the orbitofrontal cortex, and the amygdala, amongst other areas.&lt;ref name="Brain Structure and Function" /&gt; A smaller number of studies have used [[magnetic resonance spectroscopy]] to explore changes in the concentrations of neurometabolites in certain brain regions of BPD patients, looking specifically at neurometabolites such as N-acetylaspartate, creatine, glutamate-related compounds, and choline-containing compounds.&lt;ref name="Brain Structure and Function" /&gt;

====Hippocampus====
The [[hippocampus]] tends to be smaller in people with BPD, as it is in people with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, in BPD, unlike PTSD, the [[amygdala]] also tends to be smaller.&lt;ref name = "Chapman p47"&gt;{{harvnb|Chapman|Gratz|2007|page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Amygdala====
The [[amygdala]]e are smaller and more active in people with BPD.&lt;ref name = "Chapman p47" /&gt; Decreased amygdala volume has also been found in people with [[obsessive-compulsive disorder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Szeszko PR, Robinson D, Alvir JM |title=Orbital frontal and amygdala volume reductions in obsessive-compulsive disorder |journal=Arch. Gen. Psychiatry |volume=56 |issue=10 |pages=913–9 |date=October 1999 |pmid=10530633 |doi=10.1001/archpsyc.56.10.913|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; One study has found unusually strong activity in the left amygdalas of people with BPD when they experience and view displays of negative emotions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Herpertz SC, Dietrich TM, Wenning B |title=Evidence of abnormal amygdala functioning in borderline personality disorder: a functional MRI study |journal=Biol.

====Prefrontal cortex====
[[File:Prefrontal cortex (left) - lateral view.png|thumb|Prefrontal cortex]]
The [[prefrontal cortex]] tends to be less active in people with BPD, especially when recalling memories of abandonment.&lt;ref name = "Schmahl"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Schmahl CG, Elzinga BM, Vermetten E, Sanislow C, McGlashan TH, Bremner JD |title=Neural correlates of memories of abandonment in women with and without borderline personality disorder |journal=Biol. Psychiatry |volume=54 |issue=2 |pages=142–51 |date=July 2003 |pmid=12873804 |doi=10.1016/S0006-3223(02)01720-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This relative inactivity occurs in the right [[anterior cingulate]] (areas [[Brodmann area 24|24]] and [[Brodmann area 32|32]]).&lt;ref name = "Schmahl" /&gt;

Given its role in regulating emotional arousal, the relative inactivity of the prefrontal cortex might explain the difficulties people with BPD experience in regulating their emotions and responses to stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chapman|Gratz|2007|page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis====
The [[hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis]] (HPA axis) regulates [[cortisol]] production, which is released in response to stress. Cortisol production tends to be elevated in people with BPD, indicating a hyperactive HPA axis in these individuals.&lt;ref name=Grossman&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Grossman R, Yehuda R, Siever L |title=The dexamethasone suppression test and glucocorticoid receptors in borderline personality disorder |journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences |volume=821 |issue= 1|pages=459–64 |date=June 1997 |pmid=9238229 |doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.1997.tb48305.x |bibcode=1997NYASA.821..459G }}&lt;/ref&gt; This causes them to experience a greater biological stress response, which might explain their greater vulnerability to [[irritability]].&lt;ref name="Chapman p49"&gt;{{harvnb|Chapman|Gratz|2007|page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since traumatic events can increase cortisol production and HPA axis activity, one possibility is that the prevalence of higher than average activity in the HPA axis of people with BPD may simply be a reflection of the higher than average prevalence of traumatic childhood and maturational events among people with BPD.&lt;ref name="Chapman p49"/&gt; Another possibility is that, by heightening their sensitivity to stressful events, increased cortisol production may predispose those with BPD to experience stressful childhood and maturational events as traumatic.

Increased cortisol production is also associated with an increased risk of suicidal behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=van Heeringen K, Audenaert K, Van de Wiele L, Verstraete A |title=Cortisol in violent suicidal behaviour: association with personality and monoaminergic activity |journal=J Affect Disord |volume=60 |issue=3 |pages=181–9 |date=November 2000 |pmid=11074106 |doi=10.1016/S0165-0327(99)00180-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neurobiological factors===

====Estrogen====
Individual differences in women's [[estrogen]] cycles may be related to the expression of BPD symptoms in female patients.&lt;ref name=DeSoto_book&gt;{{cite book |last1=DeSoto |first1=M.

===Developmental factors===

====Childhood trauma====

Caregivers were also reported to have failed to provide needed protection and to have neglected their child's physical care. Parents of both sexes were typically reported to have withdrawn from the child emotionally and to have treated the child inconsistently.&lt;ref name="failchild"/&gt; Additionally, women with BPD who reported a previous history of neglect by a female caregiver and abuse by a male caregiver were significantly more likely to experience sexual abuse by a non-caregiver.&lt;ref name="failchild"/&gt;

===Neurological patterns===
The intensity and reactivity of a person's [[negative affectivity]], or tendency to feel negative emotions, predicts BPD symptoms more strongly than does [[childhood sexual abuse]].&lt;ref name="Rosenthal"/&gt; This finding, differences in brain structure (see [[#Brain abnormalities|Brain abnormalities]]), and the fact that some patients with BPD do not report a traumatic history,&lt;ref name="Gratz2007"&gt;{{harvnb|Chapman|Gratz|2007|page=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggest that BPD is distinct from the [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] which frequently accompanies it. Thus, researchers examine developmental causes in addition to childhood trauma.

Research published in January 2013 by Dr. Anthony Ruocco at the [[University of Toronto]] has highlighted two patterns of brain activity that may underlie the dysregulation of emotion indicated in this disorder: (1) increased activity in the brain circuits responsible for the experience of heightened emotional pain, coupled with (2) reduced activation of the brain circuits that normally regulate or suppress these generated painful emotions. These two neural networks are seen to be dysfunctionally operative in the frontolimbic regions, but the specific regions vary widely in individuals, which calls for the analysis of more neuroimaging studies.&lt;ref name="Ruocco, Anthony C.; Amirthavasagam, Sathya, Choi-Kain, Lois W.; McMain, Shelley F. 2013 153–160"&gt;{{Cite journal |year=2013 |title=Neural Correlates of Negative Emotionality in Borderline Personality Disorder: An Activation-Likelihood-Estimation Meta-Analysis |journal=Biological Psychiatry |volume=73 |issue=2 |pages=153–160 |doi=10.1016/j.biopsych.2012.07.014 |pmid=22906520|last1=Ruocco |first1=A. C. |last2=Amirthavasagam |first2=S. |last3=Choi-Kain |first3=L. W. |last4=McMain |first4=S. F. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also (contrary to the results of earlier studies) sufferers of BPD showed less activation in the [[amygdala]] in situations of increased negative emotionality than the control group. Dr. John Krystal, editor of the journal ''Biological Psychiatry'', wrote that these results "[added] to the impression that people with borderline personality disorder are 'set-up' by their brains to have stormy emotional lives, although not necessarily unhappy or unproductive lives".&lt;ref name="Ruocco, Anthony C.; Amirthavasagam, Sathya, Choi-Kain, Lois W.; McMain, Shelley F. 2013 153–160" /&gt; Their emotional instability has been found to correlate with differences in several brain regions.&lt;ref name="Koenigsberg"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Koenigsberg |first=Harold W |last2=Siever |first2=Larry J |last3=Lee |first3=Hedok |last4=Pizzarello |first4=Scott |last5=New |first5=Antonia S |last6=Goodman |first6=Marianne |last7=Cheng |first7=Hu |last8=Flory |first8=Janine |last9=Prohovnik |first9=Isak |year=2009 |title=Neural correlates of emotion processing in borderline personality disorder. |journal=Psychiatry Research |volume=172 |issue=3 |pages=192–9 |doi=10.1016/j.pscychresns.2008.07.010 |pmc=4153735 |pmid=19394205 |quote=BPD patients demonstrated greater differences in activation than controls, when viewing negative pictures compared with rest, in the amygdala, fusiform gyrus, primary visual areas, superior temporal gyrus (STG), and premotor areas, while healthy controls showed greater differences than BPD patients in the insula, middle temporal gyrus and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mediating and moderating factors===

====Executive function====
While high [[Rejection sensitivity#Rejection sensitivity|rejection sensitivity]] is associated with stronger symptoms of borderline personality disorder, [[executive function]] appears to [[Mediation (statistics)|mediate]] the relationship between rejection sensitivity and BPD symptoms.&lt;ref name="Executive_function"/&gt; That is, a group of [[cognitive processes]] that include planning, [[working memory]], attention, and problem-solving might be the mechanism through which rejection sensitivity impacts BPD symptoms. A 2008 study found that the relationship between a person's rejection sensitivity and BPD symptoms was stronger when executive function was lower and that the relationship was weaker when executive function was higher.&lt;ref name="Executive_function"/&gt; This suggests that high executive function might help protect people with high rejection sensitivity against symptoms of BPD.&lt;ref name="Executive_function"/&gt; A 2012 study found that problems in working memory might contribute to greater impulsivity in people with BPD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1601-5215.2011.00630.x |pmid=25287177 |title=Impaired working memory and normal sustained attention in borderline personality disorder |year=2012 |last1=Lazzaretti |first1=Matteo |last2=Morandotti |first2=Niccolò |last3=Sala |first3=Michela |last4=Isola |first4=Miriam |last5=Frangou |first5=Sophia |last6=De Vidovich |first6=Giulia |last7=Marraffini |first7=Elisa |last8=Gambini |first8=Francesca |last9=Barale |first9=Francesco |last10=Zappoli |first10=Federico |last11=Caverzasi |first11=Edgardo |last12=Brambilla |first12=Paolo |journal=Acta Neuropsychiatrica |volume=24 |issue=6 |pages=349–55|display-authors=8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Family environment====
Family environment mediates the effect of child sexual abuse on the development of BPD. An unstable family environment predicts the development of the disorder, while a stable family environment predicts a lower risk. One possible explanation is that a stable environment buffers against its development.&lt;ref name=Bradley&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bradley R, Jenei J, Westen D |title=Etiology of borderline personality disorder: disentangling the contributions of intercorrelated antedents |journal=J. Nerv. Ment. Dis. |volume=193 |issue=1 |pages=24–31 |date=January 2005 |pmid=15674131 |doi=10.1097/01.nmd.0000149215.88020.7c}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Self-complexity====
[[Self-complexity]], or considering one's self to have many different characteristics, appears to moderate the relationship between Actual-Ideal [[Self-discrepancy theory|self-discrepancy]] issues and the development of BPD symptoms. That is, for individuals who believe that their actual characteristics do not match the characteristics that they hope to acquire, high self-complexity reduces the impact of their conflicted self-image on BPD symptoms.&lt;ref name=Parker/&gt; However, self-complexity does not moderate the relationship between Actual-Ought [[Self-discrepancy theory|self-discrepancy]] and the development of BPD symptoms. That is, for individuals who believe that their actual characteristics do not match the characteristics that they should already have, high self-complexity does not reduce the impact of their conflicted self-image on BPD symptoms. The protective role of self-complexity in Actual-Ideal self-discrepancy, but not in Actual-Ought self-discrepancy, suggests that the impact of conflicted or unstable self-image in BPD depends on whether the individual views himself or herself in terms of characteristics that they hope to acquire, or in terms of characteristics that they ''should'' already have acquired.&lt;ref name=Parker&gt;{{cite journal | last1 =Parker | first1 = AG | last2 = Boldero | first2 = JM | last3 = Bell | first3 = RC |title= Borderline personality disorder features: the role of self-discrepancies and self-complexity |journal= Psychol Psychother |volume= 79 |issue=Pt 3 |pages = 309–21 |date=September 2006 |pmid=16945194 |doi= 10.1348/147608305X70072}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Thought suppression====
A 2005 study found that [[thought suppression]], or conscious attempts to avoid thinking certain thoughts, mediates the relationship between [[negative affectivity|emotional vulnerability]] and BPD symptoms.&lt;ref name = Rosenthal&gt;{{cite journal | last1 =Rosenthal | first1 = MZ | last2 = Cheavens | first2 = JS | last3 = Lejuez | first3 = CW | last4 = Lynch | first4 = TR |title=Thought suppression mediates the relationship between negative affect and borderline personality disorder symptoms |journal= Behav Res Ther |volume=43 | issue = 9 |pages= 1173–85 |date=September 2005 |pmid=16005704 |doi=10.1016/j.brat.2004.08.006}}&lt;/ref&gt; A later study found that the relationship between emotional vulnerability and BPD symptoms is not necessarily mediated by thought suppression. However, this study did find that thought suppression mediates the relationship between an invalidating environment and BPD symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 =Sauer | first1 = SE | last2 = Baer | first2 = Ruth A. | last3 = Baer | first3 = RA |title=Relationships between thought suppression and symptoms of borderline personality disorder |journal= J. Pers. Disord. |volume= 23 |issue=1 |pages= 48–61 |date=February 2009 |pmid = 19267661 | doi = 10.1521/pedi.2009.23.1.48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis of borderline personality disorder is based on a clinical [[psychiatric assessment|assessment]] by a mental health professional. The best method is to present the criteria of the disorder to a person and to ask them if they feel that these characteristics accurately describe them.&lt;ref name=Gund2011/&gt; Actively involving people with BPD in determining their diagnosis can help them become more willing to accept it.&lt;ref name=Gund2011/&gt; Although some clinicians prefer not to tell people with BPD what their diagnosis is, either from concern about the stigma attached to this condition or because BPD used to be considered untreatable, it is usually helpful for the person with BPD to know their diagnosis.&lt;ref name=Gund2011/&gt; This helps them know that others have had similar experiences and can point them toward effective treatments.&lt;ref name=Gund2011/&gt;

In general, the psychological evaluation includes asking the patient about the beginning and severity of symptoms, as well as other questions about how symptoms impact the patient's quality of life. Issues of particular note are suicidal ideations, experiences with self-harm, and thoughts about harming others.&lt;ref name=Mayo_Clinic_Diagnosis&gt;{{cite web|title=Personality Disorders: Tests and Diagnosis|url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/personality-disorders/DS00562/DSECTION=tests-and-diagnosis|publisher=Mayo Clinic|accessdate=13 June 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130606185940/http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/personality-disorders/DS00562/DSECTION%3Dtests-and-diagnosis|archivedate=6 June 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diagnosis is based both on the person's report of their symptoms and on the clinician's own observations.&lt;ref name=Mayo_Clinic_Diagnosis /&gt; Additional tests for BPD can include a physical exam and laboratory tests to rule out other possible triggers for symptoms, such as thyroid conditions or substance abuse.&lt;ref name = Mayo_Clinic_Diagnosis /&gt; The [[ICD-10]] manual refers to the disorder as ''emotionally unstable personality disorder'' and has similar diagnostic criteria. In the [[DSM-5]], the name of the disorder remains the same as in the previous editions.&lt;ref name=DSM5/&gt;

===''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual''===
&lt;!-- Please do not add diagnosis criteria as this constitutes a copyright violation. APA has forbidden us.--&gt;
The ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' fifth edition (DSM-5) has removed the multiaxial system. Consequently, all disorders, including personality disorders, are listed in Section II of the manual. A person must meet 5 of 9 criteria to receive a diagnosis of borderline personality disorder.&lt;ref name="DSM-5-borderine personality disorders" /&gt; The [[DSM-5]] defines the main features of BPD as a pervasive pattern of instability in interpersonal relationships, [[self image]], and [[affect (psychology)|affect]], as well as markedly impulsive behavior.&lt;ref name="DSM-5-borderine personality disorders"&gt;{{harvnb|American Psychiatric Association|2013|pages=663–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the DSM-5 proposes alternative diagnostic criteria for borderline personality disorder in section III, "Alternative DSM-5 Model for Personality Disorders". These alternative criteria are based on trait research and include specifying at least four of seven maladaptive traits.&lt;ref name="DSM-5-borderline-alternative"&gt;{{harvnb|American Psychiatric Association|2013|pages=766–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Marsha Linehan]], many mental health professionals find it challenging to diagnose BPD using the DSM criteria, since these criteria describe such a wide variety of behaviors.&lt;ref name=Manning_13&gt;{{harvnb|Manning|2011|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; To address this issue, Linehan has grouped the symptoms of BPD under five main areas of dysregulation: emotions, behavior, interpersonal relationships, sense of self, and cognition.&lt;ref name=Manning_13/&gt;

===International Classification of Disease===
The [[World Health Organization]]'s [[ICD-10]] defines a disorder that is conceptually similar to borderline personality disorder, called ''({{ICD10|F|60|3|f|60}}) Emotionally unstable personality disorder''. Its two subtypes are described below.&lt;ref name="borderline"&gt;[http://bpdfamily.com/pdfs/ICD-10.pdf Emotionally unstable personality disorder – [[International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems]] 10th Revision ([[ICD-10]]) – [[World Health Organization]]] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141020191619/http://bpdfamily.com/pdfs/ICD-10.pdf |date=20 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

;F60.30 Impulsive type
At least three of the following must be present, one of which must be (2):
# marked tendency to act unexpectedly and without consideration of the consequences;
# marked tendency to engage in quarrelsome behavior and to have conflicts with others, especially when impulsive acts are thwarted or criticized;
# liability to outbursts of anger or violence, with inability to control the resulting behavioral explosions;
# difficulty in maintaining any course of action that offers no immediate reward;
# unstable and capricious (impulsive, whimsical) mood.

;F60.31 Borderline type
At least three of the symptoms mentioned in ''F60.30 Impulsive type'' must be present [see above], with at least two of the following in addition:
# disturbances in and uncertainty about self-image, aims, and internal preferences;
# liability to become involved in intense and unstable relationships, often leading to emotional crisis;
# excessive efforts to avoid abandonment;
# recurrent threats or acts of self-harm;
# chronic feelings of [[emptiness]].
# demonstrates impulsive behavior, e.g., speeding in a car or substance abuse&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Neil R. |last1=Carlson |first2=C. Donald |last2=Heth |title=Psychology: The Science of Behavior |publisher=Pearson Canada |year=2010 |page=570}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The ICD-10 also describes some general criteria that define what is considered a [[personality disorder]].

===Millon's subtypes===
[[Theodore Millon]] has proposed four subtypes of BPD. He suggests that an individual diagnosed with BPD may exhibit none, one, or more of the following:&lt;ref name="Millon"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Millon |first1=Theodore |year=2004 |title=Personality Disorders in Modern Life |page=4 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |location=Hoboken, New Jersey |isbn=978-0-471-23734-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

! Subtype
! Features
|-
| '''Discouraged borderline''' (including [[Avoidant personality disorder|avoidant]], [[Depressive personality disorder|depressive]] and [[Dependent personality disorder|dependent]] features)
| Pliant, submissive, loyal, humble; feels vulnerable and in constant jeopardy; feels hopeless, depressed, helpless, and powerless.
|-
| '''Petulant borderline''' (including [[Passive-aggressive personality disorder|negativistic]] features)
| Negativistic, impatient, restless, as well as stubborn, defiant, sullen, pessimistic, and resentful; easily feels "slighted" and quickly disillusioned.
|-
| '''Impulsive borderline''' (including [[Histrionic personality disorder|histrionic]] or [[Antisocial personality disorder|antisocial]] features)
| Capricious, superficial, flighty, distractible, frenetic, and seductive; fearing loss, the individual becomes agitated; gloomy and irritable; and potentially suicidal.
|-
| '''Self-destructive borderline''' (including [[Depressive personality disorder|depressive]] or [[Self-defeating personality disorder|masochistic]] features)
| Inward-turning, intropunitively (self-punishing) angry; conforming, deferential, and ingratiating behaviors have deteriorated; increasingly high-strung and moody; possible suicide.
|}

===Misdiagnosis===
People with BPD may be misdiagnosed for a variety of reasons. One reason for misdiagnosis is BPD has symptoms that coexist ([[comorbidity]]) with other disorders such as depression, [[posttraumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD), and bipolar disorder.&lt;ref name="Chanen"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chanen|first1=Andrew M|last2=Thompson|first2=Katherine N|title=Prescribing and borderline personality disorder|journal=Australian Prescriber|date=1 April 2016|volume=39|issue=2|pages=49–53|doi=10.18773/austprescr.2016.019|pmid=27340322|pmc=4917638}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Meaney|first1=Rebecca|last2=Hasking|first2=Penelope|last3=Reupert|first3=Andrea|title=Borderline Personality Disorder Symptoms in College Students:The Complex Interplay Between Alexithymia, Emotional Dysregulation and Rumination|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=11|issue=6|pages=e0157294|date=2016|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0157294 |pmid=27348858|bibcode=2016PLoSO..1157294M|pmc=4922551}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Family members===
People with BPD are prone to feeling angry at members of their family and alienated from them. On their part, family members often feel angry and helpless at how their BPD family members relate to them.&lt;ref name=Gund2011&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gunderson|first=John G.|title=Borderline Personality Disorder|journal=The New England Journal of Medicine|date=26 May 2011|volume=364|issue=21|pages=2037–2042|doi=10.1056/NEJMcp1007358|pmid=21612472}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parents of adults with BPD are often both over-involved and under-involved in family interactions.&lt;ref name="parents"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Allen DM, Farmer RG |title=Family relationships of adults with borderline personality disorder |journal=Compr Psychiatry |volume=37 |issue=1 |pages=43–51 |year=1996 |pmid=8770526 |doi=10.1016/S0010-440X(96)90050-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In romantic relationships, BPD is linked to increased levels of chronic stress and conflict, decreased satisfaction of romantic partners, [[domestic violence|abuse]], and unwanted [[pregnancy]]. However, these links may apply to personality disorders in general.&lt;ref name="Daley SE, Burge D, Hammen C 2000 451–60"/&gt;

===Adolescence===
Onset of symptoms typically occurs during adolescence or young adulthood, although symptoms suggestive of this disorder can sometimes be observed in children.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Linehan|1993|page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; Symptoms among adolescents that predict the development of BPD in adulthood may include problems with body-image, extreme sensitivity to rejection, behavioral problems, non-suicidal self-injury, attempts to find exclusive relationships, and severe shame.&lt;ref name=Gund2011/&gt; Many adolescents experience these symptoms without going on to develop BPD, but those who experience them are 9 times as likely as their peers to develop BPD. They are also more likely to develop other forms of long-term social disabilities.&lt;ref name=Gund2011/&gt; Clinicians are discouraged from diagnosing anyone with BPD before the age of 18, due to the normal ups and downs of adolescence and a still-developing personality. However, BPD can sometimes be diagnosed before age 18, in which case the features must have been present and consistent for at least one year.&lt;ref name="DSM-IV-TR"&gt;{{harvnb|American Psychiatric Association|2000}}{{Page needed|date=July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A BPD diagnosis in adolescence might predict that the disorder will continue into adulthood.&lt;ref name="DSM-IV-TR"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Netherton"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Netherton |first1=S.D. |last2=Holmes |first2=D. |last3=Walker |first3=C.E. |year=1999 |title=Child and Adolescent Psychological Disorders: Comprehensive Textbook |location=New York, NY |publisher=Oxford University Press}}{{Page needed|date=July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among adolescents who warrant a BPD diagnosis, there appears to be one group in which the disorder remains stable over time and another group in which the individuals move in and out of the diagnosis.&lt;ref name=Fact_or_Fiction&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Miller AL, Muehlenkamp JJ, Jacobson CM |title=Fact or fiction: diagnosing borderline personality disorder in adolescents |journal=Clin Psychol Rev |volume=28 |issue=6 |pages=969–81 |date=July 2008 |pmid=18358579 |doi=10.1016/j.cpr.2008.02.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier diagnoses may be helpful in creating a more effective treatment plan for the adolescent.&lt;ref name = "DSM-IV-TR"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="Netherton"/&gt; Family therapy is considered a helpful component of treatment for adolescents with BPD.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Linehan|1993|page=98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Differential diagnosis and comorbidity===
Lifetime [[comorbid]] (co-occurring) conditions are common in BPD. Compared to those diagnosed with other personality disorders, people with BPD showed a higher rate of also meeting criteria for&lt;ref name = comorbidity&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Zanarini MC, Frankenburg FR, Dubo ED |title=Axis I comorbidity of borderline personality disorder |journal=Am J Psychiatry |volume=155 |issue=12 |pages=1733–9 |date=December 1998 |pmid=9842784 |url=http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/article.aspx?volume=155&amp;page=1733 |doi=10.1176/ajp.155.12.1733|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2008 study found that at some point in their lives, 75 percent of people with BPD meet criteria for mood disorders, especially major depression and Bipolar I, and nearly 75 percent meet criteria for an anxiety disorder.&lt;ref name="Grant et al 2008"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Grant BF, Chou SP, Goldstein RB |title=Prevalence, correlates, disability, and comorbidity of DSM-IV borderline personality disorder: results from the Wave 2 National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions |journal=J Clin Psychiatry |volume=69 |issue=4 |pages=533–45 |date=April 2008 |pmid=18426259 |pmc=2676679 |doi=10.4088/JCP.v69n0404|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly 73 percent meet criteria for substance abuse or dependency, and about 40 percent for PTSD.&lt;ref name="Grant et al 2008"/&gt; It is noteworthy that less than half of the participants with BPD in this study presented with PTSD, a prevalence similar to that reported in an earlier study.&lt;ref name=comorbidity /&gt; The finding that less than half of patients with BPD experience PTSD during their lives challenges the theory that BPD and PTSD are the same disorder.&lt;ref name=comorbidity /&gt;

There are marked gender differences in the types of comorbid conditions a person with BPD is likely to have—&lt;ref name=comorbidity /&gt; a higher percentage of males with BPD meet criteria for substance-use disorders, while a higher percentage of females with BPD meet criteria for PTSD and eating disorders.&lt;ref name = comorbidity /&gt;&lt;ref name="Grant et al 2008"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Gregory |first=Robert J. |date=1 November 2006 |url=http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/articles/clinical-challenges-co-occurring-borderline-personality-and-substance-use-disorders |title=Clinical Challenges in Co-occurring Borderline Personality and Substance Use Disorders |work=Psychiatric Times |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921063228/http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/articles/clinical-challenges-co-occurring-borderline-personality-and-substance-use-disorders |archivedate=21 September 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In one study, 38% of participants with BPD met the criteria for a diagnosis of ADHD.&lt;ref name="PM"/&gt; In another study, 6 of 41 participants (15%) met the criteria for an [[autism spectrum]] disorder (a subgroup that had significantly more frequent suicide attempts).&lt;ref name=Ryden2008&gt;{{Cite journal| volume = 5| issue = 1| pages = 22–30| first1 = Göran| last1 = Rydén| first2 = Eleonore| last2 = Rydén| first3 = Jerker| last3 = Hetta| title = Borderline personality disorder and autism spectrum disorder in females: A cross-sectional study| journal = Clinical Neuropsychiatry| accessdate = 7 February 2013| year = 2008| url = http://www.clinicalneuropsychiatry.org/pdf/04_ryden_hetta.pdf| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130921055225/http://www.clinicalneuropsychiatry.org/pdf/04_ryden_hetta.pdf| archivedate = 21 September 2013| df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regardless that it is an infradiagnosed disorder, a few studies have shown that the "lower expressions" of it might lead to wrong diagnoses. The many and shifting Axis I disorders in people with BPD can sometimes cause clinicians to miss the presence of the underlying personality disorder. However, since a complex pattern of Axis I diagnoses has been found to strongly predict the presence of BPD, clinicians can use the feature of a complex pattern of comorbidity as a clue that BPD might be present.&lt;ref name=comorbidity /&gt;

=====Mood disorders=====
Many people with borderline personality disorder also have [[mood disorders]], such as major depressive disorder or a bipolar disorder.&lt;ref name="Robinson"/&gt; Some characteristics of BPD are similar to those of mood disorders, which can complicate the diagnosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bolton S, Gunderson JG |title=Distinguishing borderline personality disorder from bipolar disorder: differential diagnosis and implications |journal=Am J Psychiatry |volume=153 |issue=9 |pages=1202–7 |date=September 1996 |pmid=8780426 |url=http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/article.aspx?volume=153&amp;page=1202 |doi=10.1176/ajp.153.9.1202}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=APAguide&gt;{{cite journal |title=Practice guideline for the treatment of patients with borderline personality disorder.

At face value, the affective lability of BPD and the rapid mood cycling of bipolar disorders can seem very similar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mackinnon DF, Pies R |title=Affective instability as rapid cycling: theoretical and clinical implications for borderline personality and bipolar spectrum disorders |journal=Bipolar Disord |volume=8 |issue=1 |pages=1–14 |date=February 2006 |pmid=16411976 |doi=10.1111/j.1399-5618.2006.00283.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be difficult even for experienced clinicians, if they are unfamiliar with BPD, to differentiate between the mood swings of these two conditions.&lt;ref name=Chapman_88&gt;{{harvnb|Chapman|Gratz|2007|page=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are some clear differences.&lt;ref name=Chapman_87 /&gt;

First, the mood swings of BPD and bipolar disorder tend to have different durations. In some people with bipolar disorder, episodes of depression or mania last for at least two weeks at a time, which is much longer than moods last in people with BPD.&lt;ref name=Chapman_87 /&gt; Even among those who experience bipolar disorder with more rapid mood shifts, their moods usually last for days, while the moods of people with BPD can change in minutes or hours.&lt;ref name=Chapman_88/&gt; So while euphoria and impulsivity in someone with BPD might resemble a [[manic episode]], the experience would be too brief to qualify as a manic episode.&lt;ref name = BPD_vs_BD /&gt;&lt;ref name=Chapman_88/&gt;

Second, the moods of bipolar disorder do not respond to changes in the environment, while the moods of BPD do respond to changes in the environment.&lt;ref name = BPD_vs_BD&gt;{{cite book |author1=Jamison, Kay R. |author2=Goodwin, Frederick Joseph |title=Manic-depressive illness |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford [Oxfordshire] |year=1990 |page=108 |isbn=978-0-19-503934-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; That is, a positive event would not lift the depressed mood caused by bipolar disorder, but a positive event would potentially lift the depressed mood of someone with BPD. Similarly, an undesirable event would not dampen the [[euphoria]] caused by bipolar disorder, but an undesirable event would dampen the euphoria of someone with borderline personality disorder.&lt;ref name = BPD_vs_BD /&gt;

Third, when people with BPD experience euphoria, it is usually without the racing thoughts and decreased need for sleep that are typical of [[hypomania]],&lt;ref name = BPD_vs_BD /&gt; though a later 2013 study of data collected in 2004 found that borderline personality disorder diagnosis and symptoms were associated with chronic sleep disturbances, including difficulty initiating sleep, difficulty maintaining sleep, and waking earlier than desired, as well as with the consequences of poor sleep, and noted that "[f]ew studies have examined the experience of chronic sleep disturbances in those with borderline personality disorder".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Selby EA |title=Chronic sleep disturbances and borderline personality disorder symptoms |journal=J Consult Clin Psychol |volume=81 |issue=5 |pages=941–7 |date=October 2013 |pmid=23731205 |doi=10.1037/a0033201 |pmc=4129646}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the two conditions have a number of similar symptoms, BPD was once considered to be a mild form of [[bipolar disorder]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Akiskal HS, Yerevanian BI, Davis GC, King D, Lemmi H |title=The nosologic status of borderline personality: clinical and polysomnographic study |journal=Am J Psychiatry |volume=142 |issue=2 |pages=192–8 |date=February 1985 |pmid=3970243 |url=http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/article.aspx?volume=142&amp;page=192 |doi=10.1176/ajp.142.2.192}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gunderson JG, Elliott GR |title=The interface between borderline personality disorder and affective disorder |journal=Am J Psychiatry |volume=142 |issue=3 |pages=277–88 |date=March 1985 |pmid=2857532 |url=http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/article.aspx?volume=142&amp;page=277 |doi=10.1176/ajp.142.3.277}}&lt;/ref&gt; or to exist on the bipolar spectrum. However, this would require that the underlying mechanism causing these symptoms be the same for both conditions. Differences in phenomenology, family history, longitudinal course, and responses to treatment indicate that this is not the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Paris J |title=Borderline or bipolar?

=====Premenstrual dysphoric disorder=====
[[Premenstrual dysphoric disorder]] (PMDD) occurs in 3–8 percent of women.&lt;ref name=Rapkin&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rapkin |first1=AJ |last2=Lewis |first2=EI |title=Treatment of premenstrual dysphoric disorder |journal=Womens Health (Lond Engl) |volume=9 |issue=6 |pages=537–56 |date= November 2013 |pmid=24161307 |doi=10.2217/whe.13.62}}&lt;/ref&gt; Symptoms begin 5–11 days before menstruation and cease a few days after it begins.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} Symptoms may include marked mood swings, irritability, depressed mood, feeling hopeless or suicidal, a subjective sense of being overwhelmed or out of control, anxiety, binge eating, difficulty concentrating, and substantial impairment of interpersonal relationships.&lt;ref name= "Grady-Weliky"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Grady-Weliky | first = TA | title= Premenstrual dysphoric disorder |journal= N.

Although some of the symptoms of PMDD and BPD are similar, they are different disorders. They are distinguishable by the timing and duration of symptoms, which are markedly different: the symptoms of PMDD occur only during the [[luteal phase]] of the [[menstrual cycle]],&lt;ref name = Grady-Weliky /&gt; whereas BPD symptoms occur persistently at all stages of the menstrual cycle. In addition, the symptoms of PMDD do not include impulsivity.&lt;ref name="Grady-Weliky" /&gt;

More than two-thirds of people diagnosed with BPD also meet the criteria for another Axis II personality disorder at some point in their lives. (In a 2008 study, the rate was 73.9 percent.)&lt;ref name="Grant et al 2008"/&gt; Cluster A disorders, which include [[paranoid personality disorder|paranoid]], [[schizoid personality disorder|schizoid]], and [[schizotypal personality disorder|schizotypal]], are the most common, with a prevalence of 50.4 percent in people with BPD.&lt;ref name="Grant et al 2008"/&gt;

The second most common is another Cluster B disorder, which includes [[antisocial personality disorder|antisocial]], [[histrionic personality disorder|histrionic]], and [[narcissistic personality disorder|narcissistic]]. These have an overall prevalence of 49.2 percent in people with BPD, with narcissistic being the most common, at 38.9 percent; antisocial the second most common, at 13.7 percent; and histrionic the least common, at 10.3 percent.&lt;ref name="Grant et al 2008"/&gt; The least common are Cluster C disorders, which include [[avoidant personality disorder|avoidant]], [[dependent personality disorder|dependent]], and [[obsessive-compulsive personality disorder|obsessive-compulsive]], and have a prevalence of 29.9 percent in people with BPD.&lt;ref name="Grant et al 2008"/&gt; The percentages for specific comorbid Axis II disorders can be found in the adjacent table.

==Management==
{{Main|Management of borderline personality disorder}}
[[Psychotherapy]] is the primary treatment for borderline personality disorder.&lt;ref name =Lei2011/&gt; Treatments should be based on the needs of the individual, rather than upon the general diagnosis of BPD. Medications are useful for treating comorbid disorders, such as depression and anxiety.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nice.org.uk/Guidance/CG78/NiceGuidance/pdf/English |title=CG78 Borderline personality disorder (BPD): NICE guideline |publisher=Nice.org.uk |date=28 January 2009 |accessdate=12 August 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090411104754/http://www.nice.org.uk/Guidance/CG78/NiceGuidance/pdf/English |archivedate=11 April 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Short-term hospitalization has not been found to be more effective than community care for improving outcomes or long-term prevention of suicidal behavior in those with BPD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Paris J |title=Is hospitalization useful for suicidal patients with borderline personality disorder? |journal=J.

Long-term psychotherapy is currently the treatment of choice for BPD.&lt;ref name=BPD_therapies&gt;{{cite journal |author=Zanarini MC |title=Psychotherapy of borderline personality disorder |journal=Acta Psychiatr Scand |volume=120 |issue=5 |pages=373–7 |date=November 2009 |pmid=19807718 |doi=10.1111/j.1600-0447.2009.01448.x |pmc=3876885}}&lt;/ref&gt; While psychotherapy, in particular dialectical behavior therapy and psychodynamic approaches, is effective, the effects are small.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1= Cristea |first1= I.

Transference focused therapy aims to break away from absolute thinking. In this, it gets the people to articulate their social interpretations and their emotions in order to turn their views into less rigid categories. The therapist addresses the individual's feelings and goes over situations, real or realistic, that could happen as well as how to approach them.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bliss|first=Susan|last2=McCardle|first2=Melissa|date=2014-03-01|title=An Exploration of Common Elements in Dialectical Behavior Therapy, Mentalization Based Treatment and Transference Focused Psychotherapy in the Treatment of Borderline Personality Disorder|journal=Clinical Social Work Journal|language=en|volume=42|issue=1|pages=61–69|doi=10.1007/s10615-013-0456-z|issn=0091-1674}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dialectical behavior therapy has similar components to CBT, adding in practices such as meditation. In doing this, it helps the individual with BPD gain skills to manage symptoms. These skills include emotion regulation, mindfulness, and stress hardiness.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
[[File:Dialectical Behavior Therapy Cycle EN.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The stages used in [[dialectical behavior therapy]].]]
Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is also a type of psychotherapy used for treatment of BPD. This type of therapy relies on changing people's behaviors and beliefs by identifying problems from the disorder. CBT is known to reduce some anxiety and mood symptoms as well as reduce suicidal thoughts and self-harming behaviors.&lt;ref name=NIH2016/&gt;

Mentalization-based therapy and transference-focused psychotherapy are based on [[psychodynamic]] principles, and dialectical behavior therapy is based on cognitive-behavioral principles and [[Mindfulness (psychology)|mindfulness]].&lt;ref name=BPD_therapies/&gt; General psychiatric management combines the core principles from each of these treatments, and it is considered easier to learn and less intensive.&lt;ref name=Gund2011/&gt; Randomized controlled trials have shown that DBT and MBT may be the most effective, and the two share many similarities.&lt;ref name=DBT_vs_therapyByExperts&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Linehan MM, Comtois KA, Murray AM |title=Two-year randomized controlled trial and follow-up of dialectical behavior therapy vs therapy by experts for suicidal behaviors and borderline personality disorder |journal=Arch.

===Medications===
A 2010 review by the [[Cochrane collaboration]] found that no medications show promise for "the core BPD symptoms of chronic feelings of emptiness, identity disturbance and abandonment". However, the authors found that some medications may impact isolated symptoms associated with BPD or the symptoms of comorbid conditions.&lt;ref name=Stoffers&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stoffers|first1=J|last2=Völlm|first2=BA|last3=Rücker|first3=G|last4=Timmer|first4=A|last5=Huband|first5=N|last6=Lieb|first6=K|title=Pharmacological interventions for borderline personality disorder|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=16 June 2010|issue=6|pages=CD005653|pmid=20556762|pmc=4169794|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD005653.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2017 review examined evidence published since the 2010 Cochrane review and found that "evidence of effectiveness of medication for BPD remains very mixed and is still highly compromised by suboptimal study design".&lt;ref name=Drugs2017rev&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hancock-Johnson|first1=E|last2=Griffiths|first2=C|last3=Picchioni|first3=M|title=A Focused Systematic Review of Pharmacological Treatment for Borderline Personality Disorder|journal=CNS Drugs|date=May 2017|volume=31|issue=5|pages=345–356|doi=10.1007/s40263-017-0425-0|pmid=28353141}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the [[typical antipsychotic]]s studied in relation to BPD, [[haloperidol]] may reduce anger and [[flupenthixol]] may reduce the likelihood of suicidal behavior. Among the [[atypical antipsychotic]]s, one trial found that [[aripiprazole]] may reduce interpersonal problems and impulsivity.&lt;ref name=Stoffers/&gt; [[Olanzapine]] may decrease affective instability, anger, psychotic paranoid symptoms, and anxiety, but a [[placebo]] had a greater ameliorative impact on suicidal ideation than olanzapine did. The effect of [[ziprasidone]] was not significant.&lt;ref name=Stoffers/&gt;&lt;ref name=Drugs2017rev/&gt;

Of the [[mood stabilizers]] studied, [[valproate semisodium]] may ameliorate depression, interpersonal problems, and anger. [[Lamotrigine]] may reduce impulsivity and anger; [[topiramate]] may ameliorate interpersonal problems, impulsivity, anxiety, anger, and general psychiatric pathology. The effect of [[carbamazepine]] was not significant. Of the [[antidepressant]]s, [[amitriptyline]] may reduce depression, but [[mianserin]], [[fluoxetine]], [[fluvoxamine]], and [[phenelzine]] sulfate showed no effect. [[Omega-3 fatty acid]] may ameliorate suicidality and improve depression. {{as of|2017}}, trials with these medications had not been replicated and the effect of long-term use had not been assessed.&lt;ref name=Stoffers/&gt;&lt;ref name=Drugs2017rev/&gt;

Because of weak evidence and the potential for serious side effects from some of these medications, the UK [[National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence]] (NICE) 2009 clinical guideline for the treatment and management of BPD recommends, "Drug treatment should not be used specifically for borderline personality disorder or for the individual symptoms or behavior associated with the disorder." However, "drug treatment may be considered in the overall treatment of comorbid conditions". They suggest a "review of the treatment of people with borderline personality disorder who do not have a diagnosed comorbid mental or physical illness and who are currently being prescribed drugs, with the aim of reducing and stopping unnecessary drug treatment".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/live/12125/42900/42900.pdf|title=The UK National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) 2009 clinical guideline for the treatment and management of BPD|website=|publisher=|accessdate=6 September 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120618094650/http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/live/12125/42900/42900.pdf|archivedate=18 June 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Services===
There is a significant difference between the number of those who would benefit from treatment and the number of those who are treated. The so-called "treatment gap" is a function of the disinclination of the afflicted to submit for treatment, an underdiagnosing of the disorder by healthcare providers, and the limited availability and access to state-of-the-art treatments.&lt;ref name="BPD Article"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Johnson|first=R.

After a patient suffering from BPD died, The [[National Health Service (England)|National Health Service (NHS)]] in England was criticized by a coroner in 2014 for the lack of commissioned services to support those with BPD. Evidence was given that 45% of female patients had BPD and there was no provision or priority for therapeutic psychological services. At the time, there were 60 specialized inpatient beds in England, all of them located in London or the northeast region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=National leaders warned over lack of services for personality disorders|url=https://www.hsj.co.uk/mersey-care-nhs-trust/national-leaders-warned-over-lack-of-services-for-personality-disorders/7020669.article?|accessdate=22 December 2017|publisher=Health Service Journal|date=29 September 2017}} {{subscription required|s}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prognosis==
With treatment, the majority of people with BPD can find relief from distressing symptoms and achieve remission, defined as a consistent relief from symptoms for at least two years.&lt;ref name=longitudinal_remission&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Zanarini MC, Frankenburg FR, Hennen J, Silk KR |title=A longitudinal course of borderline psychopathology: 6-year prospective follow-up of the phenomenology of borderline personality disorder |journal=Am J Psychiatry |volume=160 |issue=2 |pages=274–83 |date=February 2003 |pmid=12562573 |doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.160.2.274}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PToverview/&gt; This [[longitudinal study]] tracking the symptoms of people with BPD found that 34.5% achieved remission within two years from the beginning of the study. Within four years, 49.4% had achieved remission, and within six years, 68.6% had achieved remission. By the end of the study, 73.5% of participants were found to be in remission.&lt;ref name=longitudinal_remission /&gt; Moreover, of those who achieved recovery from symptoms, only 5.9% experienced recurrences. A later study found that ten years from baseline (during a hospitalization), 86% of patients had sustained a stable recovery from symptoms.&lt;ref name=Treatment&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Zanarini MC, Frankenburg FR, Reich DB, Fitzmaurice G |title=Time to attainment of recovery from borderline personality disorder and stability of recovery: A 10-year prospective follow-up study |journal=Am J Psychiatry |volume=167 |issue=6 |pages=663–7 |date=June 2010 |pmid=20395399 |pmc=3203735 |doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.2009.09081130 |laysummary=http://www.mclean.harvard.edu/news/press/current.php?kw=long-term-study-borderline-personality-disorder-shows-importance-measuring&amp;id=153 |laysource=McLean Hospital |laydate=15 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Patient personality can play an important role during the therapeutic process, leading to better clinical outcomes. Recent research has shown that BPD patients undergoing dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) exhibit better clinical outcomes correlated with higher levels of the trait of agreeableness in the patient, compared to patients either low in agreeableness or not being treated with DBT. This association was mediated through the strength of a working alliance between patient and therapist; that is, more agreeable patients developed stronger working alliances with their therapists, which in turn, led to better clinical outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hirsh JB, Quilty LC, Bagby RM, McMain SF |title=The relationship between agreeableness and the development of the working alliance in patients with borderline personality disorder |journal=J.

In addition to recovering from distressing symptoms, people with BPD also achieve high levels of [[psychosocial]] functioning. A longitudinal study tracking the social and work abilities of participants with BPD found that six years after diagnosis, 56% of participants had good function in work and social environments, compared to 26% of participants when they were first diagnosed. Vocational achievement was generally more limited, even compared to those with other personality disorders. However, those whose symptoms had remitted were significantly more likely to have good relationships with a romantic partner and at least one parent, good performance at work and school, a sustained work and school history, and good psychosocial functioning overall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Zanarini MC, Frankenburg FR, Hennen J, Reich DB, Silk KR |title=Psychosocial functioning of borderline patients and axis II comparison subjects followed prospectively for six years |journal=J.

==Epidemiology==
The [[prevalence]] of BPD was initially estimated to be 1 to 2 percent of the general population&lt;ref name=PToverview/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1521/pedi.1990.4.3.257 |title=Estimating the Prevalence of Borderline Personality Disorder in the Community |year=1990 |last1=Swartz |first1=Marvin |last2=Blazer |first2=Dan |last3=George |first3=Linda |last4=Winfield |first4=Idee |journal=Journal of Personality Disorders |volume=4 |issue=3 |pages=257–272}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to occur three times more often in women than in men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Skodol AE, Bender DS |title=Why are women diagnosed borderline more than men? |journal=Psychiatr Q |volume=74 |issue=4 |pages=349–60 |year=2003 |pmid=14686459 |doi=10.1023/A:1026087410516}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Korzekwa MI, Dell PF, Links PS, Thabane L, Webb SP |title=Estimating the prevalence of borderline personality disorder in psychiatric outpatients using a two-phase procedure |journal=Compr Psychiatry |volume=49 |issue=4 |pages=380–6 |year=2008 |pmid=18555059 |doi=10.1016/j.comppsych.2008.01.007}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the lifetime prevalence of BPD in a 2008 study was found to be 5.9% of the general population, occurring in 5.6% of men and 6.2% of women.&lt;ref name="Grant et al 2008"/&gt; The difference in rates between men and women in this study was not found to be [[Significance (statistics)|statistically significant]].&lt;ref name="Grant et al 2008"/&gt;

==History==
[[File:Edvard Munch - Salomé.jpg|thumb|Devaluation in [[Edvard Munch]]'s ''Salome'' (1903). Idealization and devaluation of others in personal relations is a common trait in BPD. The painter Edvard Munch depicted his new friend, the violinist Eva Mudocci, in both ways within days. First as "a woman seen by a man in love", then as "a bloodthirsty and [[Cannibalism|cannibalistic]] [[Salome]]".&lt;ref name=Ed1990&gt;{{cite book|title=Edvard Munch : the life of a person with borderline personality as seen through his art|date=1990|publisher=Lundbeck Pharma A/S|location=[Danmark]|isbn=978-8798352419|pages=34–35}}&lt;/ref&gt; In modern times, Munch has been diagnosed as having had BPD.&lt;ref&gt;[[James F. Masterson]]: ''Search For The Real Self. Unmasking The Personality Disorders Of Our Age'', Chapter 12: The Creative Solution: Sartre, Munch, and Wolfe, p. 208–230, Simon and Schuster, New York 1988, {{ISBN|1451668910}}, p. 212-213.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tove Aarkrog: ''Edvard Munch: the life of a person with borderline personality as seen through his art'', Lundbeck Pharma A/S, Denmark 1990, {{ISBN|8798352415}}.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The coexistence of intense, divergent moods within an individual was recognized by [[Homer]], [[Hippocrates]], and [[Aretaeus of Cappadocia|Aretaeus]], the latter describing the vacillating presence of impulsive anger, melancholia, and mania within a single person. The concept was revived by Swiss physician Théophile Bonet in 1684 who, using the term ''folie maniaco-mélancolique'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Millon|Grossman|Meagher|2004|p=172}}&lt;/ref&gt; described the phenomenon of unstable moods that followed an unpredictable course. Other writers noted the same pattern, including the American psychiatrist Charles H. Hughes in 1884 and J.C. Rosse in 1890, who called the disorder "borderline insanity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=|date=|year=1884|title=Borderline psychiatric records – prodromal symptoms of psychical impairments|url=|journal=Alienists &amp; Neurology|volume=5|pages=85–90|oclc=773814725|via=|author=Charles Hamilton Hughes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1921, [[Emil Kraepelin|Kraepelin]] identified an "excitable personality" that closely parallels the borderline features outlined in the current concept of BPD.&lt;ref name="millon"&gt;{{Harvnb|Millon|1996|pp= 645–690}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first significant psychoanalytic work to use the term "borderline" was written by Adolf Stern in 1938.&lt;ref name=stern&gt;{{Cite journal|first= Adolf |last= Stern |year= 1938 |title= Psychoanalytic investigation of and therapy in the borderline group of neuroses |journal= Psychoanalytic Quarterly |volume= 7 |pages= 467–489 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=alberto&gt;{{Cite journal|first= Alberto |last= Stefana |year= 2015 |title= Adolph Stern, father of term 'borderline personality' |journal= Minerva Psichiatrica |volume= 56 |issue=2 |pages= 95 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It described a group of patients suffering from what he thought to be a mild form of [[schizophrenia]], on the ''borderline'' between [[neurosis]] and [[psychosis]].

The 1960s and 1970s saw a shift from thinking of the condition as borderline schizophrenia to thinking of it as a borderline affective disorder (mood disorder), on the fringes of bipolar disorder, [[cyclothymia]], and [[dysthymia]]. In the [[DSM-II]], stressing the intensity and variability of moods, it was called [[cyclothymic personality]] (affective personality).&lt;ref name="DSM-IV-TR"/&gt; While the term "borderline" was evolving to refer to a distinct category of disorder, psychoanalysts such as [[Otto Kernberg]] were using it to refer to a broad [[Spectrum disorder|spectrum]] of issues, describing an intermediate level of personality organization&lt;ref name="millon"/&gt; between neurosis and psychosis.&lt;ref name=pmid3898174&gt;{{cite journal |author=Aronson TA |title=Historical perspectives on the borderline concept: a review and critique |journal=Psychiatry |volume=48 |issue=3 |pages=209–22 |date=August 1985 |pmid=3898174}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After standardized criteria were developed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gunderson JG, Kolb JE, Austin V |title=The diagnostic interview for borderline patients |journal=Am J Psychiatry |volume=138 |issue=7 |pages=896–903 |date=July 1981 |pmid=7258348 |url=http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/article.aspx?volume=138&amp;page=896 |doi=10.1176/ajp.138.7.896}}&lt;/ref&gt; to distinguish it from mood disorders and other Axis I disorders, BPD became a personality disorder diagnosis in 1980 with the publication of the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM-III]].&lt;ref name="PToverview"&gt;{{cite web |last=Oldham |first1=John M. |date=July 2004 |url=http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/articles/borderline-personality-disorder-overview-0 |title=Borderline Personality Disorder: An Overview |work=Psychiatric Times |volume=XXI |issue=8 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021180803/http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/articles/borderline-personality-disorder-overview-0 |archivedate=21 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The diagnosis was distinguished from sub-syndromal schizophrenia, which was termed "[[Schizotypal personality disorder]]".&lt;ref name=pmid3898174/&gt; The DSM-IV Axis II Work Group of the American Psychiatric Association finally decided on the name "borderline personality disorder", which is still in use by the DSM-5 today.&lt;ref name=DSM5/&gt; However, the term "borderline" has been described as uniquely inadequate for describing the symptoms characteristic of this disorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author=Stone MH |year=2005 |chapter=Borderline Personality Disorder: History of the Concept |editor=Zanarini MC |title=Borderline personality disorder |pages=1–18 |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |location=Boca Raton, FL |isbn=978-0-8247-2928-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Etymology===
Earlier versions of the DSM, prior to the multiaxial diagnosis system, classified most people with mental health problems into two categories, the psychotics and the neurotics. Clinicians noted a certain class of neurotics who, when in crisis, appeared to straddle the borderline into psychosis. The term stuck and evolved into the personality disorder diagnosis of today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Moll |first1=Thomas |title=Mental Health Primer |isbn=978-1720510574 |page=43|date=2018-05-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==

===Credibility and validity of testimony===
The credibility of individuals with personality disorders has been questioned at least since the 1960s.&lt;ref name=Goodwin&gt;{{cite book|last1=Goodwin|first1=Jean|editor1-last=Kluft|editor1-first=Richard P.|title=Childhood antecedents of multiple personality|date=1985|publisher=American Psychiatric Press|isbn=9780880480826|url=9780880480826|chapter=Chapter 1: Credibility problems in multiple personality disorder patients and abused children}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|2}} Two concerns are the incidence of [[dissociation (psychology)|dissociation episodes]] among people with BPD and the belief that lying is a key component of this condition.

====Dissociation====
Researchers disagree about whether [[dissociation (psychology)|dissociation]], or a sense of detachment from emotions and physical experiences, impacts the ability of people with BPD to recall the specifics of past events. A 1999 study reported that the specificity of [[autobiographical memory]] was decreased in BPD patients.&lt;ref name="Startup"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Startup|first=M.|author2=B. Jones|author3=H. Heard|author4=M. Swales|author5=J.M.G. Williams|author6=R.S.P. Jones|title=Autobiographical memory and dissociation in borderline personality disorder|journal=Psychological Medicine|date=November 1999|volume=29|issue=6|pages=1397–1404|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=26157|doi=10.1017/S0033291799001208|pmid=10616945|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203061107/http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=26157|archivedate=3 February 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The researchers found that decreased ability to recall specifics was correlated with patients' levels of dissociation.&lt;ref name = "Startup" /&gt;

====Lying as a feature====
Some theorists argue that patients with BPD often [[lie]].&lt;ref name="Linehan 1993, p.17"&gt;{{harvnb|Linehan|1993|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, others write that they have rarely seen lying among patients with BPD in clinical practice.&lt;ref name="Linehan 1993, p.17"/&gt;

The belief that lying is a distinguishing characteristic of BPD can impact the quality of care that people with this diagnosis receive in the legal and healthcare systems. For instance, Jean Goodwin relates an anecdote of a patient with multiple personality disorder, now called [[dissociative identity disorder]], who suffered from pelvic pain due to traumatic events in her childhood. Due to their disbelief in her accounts of these events, physicians diagnosed her with borderline personality disorder, reflecting a belief that lying is a key feature of BPD. Based upon her BPD diagnosis, the physicians then disregarded the patient's assertion that she was allergic to adhesive tape. The patient was in fact allergic to adhesive tape, which later caused complications in the surgery to relieve her pelvic pain.&lt;ref name=Goodwin/&gt;{{rp|3}}

===Gender===
Since BPD can be a [[#Stigma|stigmatizing]] diagnosis even within the mental health community, some survivors of childhood abuse who are diagnosed with BPD are re-traumatized by the negative responses they receive from healthcare providers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Nehls N |title=Borderline personality disorder: gender stereotypes, stigma, and limited system of care |journal=Issues Ment Health Nurs. |volume=19 |issue=2 |pages=97–112 |year=1998 |pmid=9601307 |doi=10.1080/016128498249105}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; One camp argues that it would be better to diagnose these men or women with [[post-traumatic stress disorder]], as this would acknowledge the impact of abuse on their behavior. Critics of the [[PTSD]] diagnosis argue that it medicalizes abuse rather than addressing the root causes in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Becker D |title=When she was bad: borderline personality disorder in a posttraumatic age |journal=[[Am J Orthopsychiatry]] |volume=70 |issue=4 |pages=422–32 |date=October 2000 |pmid=11086521 |doi=10.1037/h0087769}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless, a diagnosis of PTSD does not encompass all aspects of the disorder (see [[#Brain abnormalities|Brain abnormalities]] and [[#Terminology|Terminology]]).

Joel Paris states that "In the clinic ... Up to 80% of patients are women. That may not be true in the community."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Paris J |title=Treatment of Borderline Personality Disorder. A Guide to Evidence-Based Practice | year=2008 | publisher=The Guilford Press | page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; He offers the following explanations regarding these gender discrepancies:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The most probable explanation for gender differences in clinical samples is that women are more likely to develop the kind of symptoms that bring patients in for treatment. Twice as many women as men in the community suffer from depression (Weissman &amp; Klerman, 1985). In contrast, there is a preponderance of men meeting criteria for substance abuse and psychopathy (Robins &amp; Regier, 1991), and males with these disorders do not necessarily present in the mental health system. Men and women with similar psychological problems may express distress differently. Men tend to drink more and carry out more crimes. Women tend to turn their anger on themselves, leading to depression as well as the cutting and overdosing that characterize BPD. Thus, [[anti-social personality disorder]] (ASPD) and borderline personality disorders might derive from similar underlying pathology but present with symptoms strongly influenced by gender (Paris, 1997a; Looper &amp; Paris, 2000).
&lt;br /&gt;
We have even more specific evidence that men with BPD may not seek help. In a study of completed suicides among people aged 18 to 35 years (Lesage et al., 1994), 30% of the suicides involved individuals with BPD (as confirmed by psychological autopsy, in which symptoms were assessed by interviews with family members). Most of the suicide completers were men, and very few were in treatment. Similar findings emerged from a later study conducted by our own research group (McGirr, Paris, Lesage, Renaud, &amp; Turecki, 2007).&lt;ref name="Paris J 2008 21–22"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In short, men are less likely to seek or accept appropriate treatment, more likely to be treated for symptoms of BPD such as substance abuse rather than BPD itself (the symptoms of BPD and ASPD possibly deriving from a similar underlying aetiology), possibly more likely to wind up in the correctional system due to criminal behavior, and possibly more likely to commit suicide prior to diagnosis.

Among men diagnosed with BPD there is also evidence of a higher suicide rate: "men are more than twice as likely as women—18 percent versus 8 percent"—to die by suicide.&lt;ref name="Kreisman J, Strauss H 2004 206"/&gt;

There are also sex differences in borderline personality disorders.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Gender Patterns in Borderline Personality Disorder|journal = Innovations in Clinical Neuroscience|date = 1 May 2011|issn = 2158-8333|pmc = 3115767|pmid = 21686143|pages = 16–20|volume = 8|issue = 5|first = Randy A.|last = Sansone|first2 = Lori A.|last2 = Sansone}}&lt;/ref&gt; Men with BPD are more likely to abuse substances, have explosive temper, high levels of novelty seeking and have [[Antisocial personality disorder|anti-social]], [[Narcissism|narcissistic]], passive-aggressive or sadistic personality traits.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Women with BPD are more likely to have eating disorders, mood disorders, anxiety and post-traumatic stress.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Manipulative behavior===
[[Psychological manipulation|Manipulative behavior]] to obtain nurturance is considered by the [[diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders|DSM-IV-TR]] and many mental health professionals to be a defining characteristic of borderline personality disorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|American Psychiatric Association|2000|page=705}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Marsha Linehan]] notes that doing so relies upon the assumption that people with BPD who communicate intense pain, or who engage in self-harm and suicidal behavior, do so with the intention of influencing the behavior of others.&lt;ref name = Linehanp14&gt;{{harvnb|Linehan|1993|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The impact of such behavior on others—often an intense emotional reaction in concerned friends, family members, and therapists—is thus assumed to have been the person's intention.&lt;ref name = Linehanp14/&gt;

However, since people with BPD lack the ability to successfully manage painful emotions and interpersonal challenges, their frequent expressions of intense pain, self-harming, or suicidal behavior may instead represent a method of mood regulation or an escape mechanism from situations that feel unbearable.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Linehan|1993|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Linehan notes that if, for example, one were to withhold pain medication from burn victims and cancer patients, leaving them unable to regulate their severe pain, they would also exhibit "attention-seeking" and [[self-destructive behavior]] in order to cope.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Linehan|1993|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stigma===
The features of BPD include emotional instability; intense, unstable interpersonal relationships; a need for intimacy; and a fear of rejection. As a result, people with BPD often evoke intense emotions in those around them. Pejorative terms to describe people with BPD, such as "difficult", "treatment resistant", "manipulative", "demanding", and "[[attention seeking]]", are often used and may become a self-fulfilling prophecy, as the negative treatment of these individuals triggers further self-destructive behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Aviram RB, Brodsky BS, Stanley B |title=Borderline personality disorder, stigma, and treatment implications |journal=Harv Rev Psychiatry |volume=14 |issue=5 |pages=249–56 |year=2006 |pmid=16990170 |doi=10.1080/10673220600975121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Physical violence====
The stigma surrounding borderline personality disorder includes the belief that people with BPD are prone to violence toward others.&lt;ref name=Chapman_31&gt;{{harvnb|Chapman|Gratz|2007|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; While movies and visual media often sensationalize people with BPD by portraying them as violent, the majority of researchers agree that people with BPD are unlikely to physically harm others.&lt;ref name="Chapman_31"/&gt; Although people with BPD often struggle with experiences of intense anger, a defining characteristic of BPD is that they direct it inward toward themselves.&lt;ref name=Chapman_32&gt;{{harvnb|Chapman|Gratz|2007|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the key differences between BPD and [[antisocial personality disorder]] (ASPD) is that people with BPD tend to internalize anger by hurting themselves, while people with ASPD tend to externalize it by hurting others.&lt;ref name=Chapman_32/&gt;

In addition, adults with BPD have often experienced abuse in childhood, so many people with BPD adopt a "no-tolerance" policy toward expressions of anger of any kind.&lt;ref name=Chapman_32/&gt; Their extreme aversion to violence can cause many people with BPD to overcompensate and experience difficulties being assertive and expressing their needs.&lt;ref name=Chapman_32/&gt; This is one way in which people with BPD choose to harm themselves over potentially causing harm to others.&lt;ref name=Chapman_32/&gt; Another way in which people with BPD avoid expressing their anger through violence is by causing physical damage to themselves, such as engaging in non-suicidal self-injury.&lt;ref name=reasons_NSSI /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chapman_31"/&gt;

====Mental healthcare providers====

People with BPD are considered to be among the most challenging groups of patients to work with in therapy, requiring a high level of skill and training in the psychiatrists, therapists and nurses involved in their treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hinshelwood RD |title=The difficult patient. The role of 'scientific psychiatry' in understanding patients with chronic schizophrenia or severe personality disorder |journal=Br J Psychiatry |volume=174 |issue= 3|pages=187–90 |date=March 1999 |pmid=10448440 |doi=10.1192/bjp.174.3.187}}&lt;/ref&gt; A majority of psychiatric staff report finding individuals with BPD moderately to extremely difficult to work with and more difficult than other client groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cleary M, Siegfried N, Walter G |title=Experience, knowledge and attitudes of mental health staff regarding clients with a borderline personality disorder |journal=Int J Ment Health Nurs |volume=11 |issue=3 |pages=186–91 |date=September 2002 |pmid=12510596 |doi=10.1046/j.1440-0979.2002.00246.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Efforts are ongoing to improve public and staff attitudes toward people with BPD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Deans C, Meocevic E |title=Attitudes of registered psychiatric nurses towards patients diagnosed with borderline personality disorder |journal=Contemp Nurse |volume=21 |issue=1 |pages=43–9 |year=2006 |pmid=16594881 |doi=10.5172/conu.2006.21.1.43}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Krawitz R |title=Borderline personality disorder: attitudinal change following training |journal=Aust N Z J Psychiatry |volume=38 |issue=7 |pages=554–9 |date=July 2004 |pmid=15255829 |doi=10.1111/j.1440-1614.2004.01409.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In psychoanalytic theory, the [[Stigma (sociological theory)|stigmatization]] among mental healthcare providers may be thought to reflect [[countertransference]] (when a therapist projects his or her own feelings on to a client). Thus, a diagnosis of BPD "often says more about the clinician's negative reaction to the patient than it does about the patient" and "explains away the breakdown in [[empathy]] between the therapist and the patient and becomes an institutional epithet in the guise of pseudoscientific jargon".&lt;ref name="pmid3898174" /&gt; This inadvertent countertransference can give rise to inappropriate clinical responses, including excessive use of medication, inappropriate mothering, and punitive use of limit setting and interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Vaillant GE |title=The beginning of wisdom is never calling a patient a borderline; or, the clinical management of immature defenses in the treatment of individuals with personality disorders |journal=J Psychother Pract Res |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=117–34 |year=1992 |pmid=22700090 |pmc=3330289}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some clients feel the diagnosis is helpful, allowing them to understand that they are not alone and to connect with others with BPD who have developed helpful coping mechanisms. However, others experience the term ''borderline personality disorder'' as a [[pejorative]] [[labeling theory|label]] rather than an informative diagnosis. They report concerns that their self-destructive behavior is incorrectly perceived as manipulative and that the stigma surrounding this disorder limits their access to healthcare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Nehls N |title=Borderline personality disorder: the voice of patients |journal=Res Nurs Health |volume=22 |issue=4 |pages=285–93 |date=August 1999 |pmid=10435546 |doi=10.1002/(SICI)1098-240X(199908)22:4&lt;285::AID-NUR3&gt;3.0.CO;2-R}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary-inline|date=July 2015}} Indeed, mental health professionals frequently refuse to provide services to those who have received a BPD diagnosis.&lt;ref name=Manning_ix&gt;{{harvnb|Manning|2011|page=ix}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Terminology===
Because of the above concerns, and because of a move away from the original theoretical basis for the term (see [[Borderline personality disorder#History|history]]), there is ongoing debate about renaming borderline personality disorder. While some clinicians agree with the current name, others argue that it should be changed,&lt;ref name="borderlinepersonalitytoday.com"&gt;{{cite news|last=Bogod |first=Elizabeth |title=Borderline Personality Disorder Label Creates Stigma |url=http://www.borderlinepersonalitytoday.com/main/label.htm |accessdate= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150502181810/http://www.borderlinepersonalitytoday.com/main/label.htm |archivedate=2 May 2015 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; since many who are [[labeling theory|labelled]] with borderline personality disorder find the name unhelpful, stigmatizing, or inaccurate.&lt;ref name="borderlinepersonalitytoday.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tara4bpd.org/dyn/index.php?option=content&amp;task=view&amp;id=12 |title=Understanding Borderline Personality Disorder |publisher=Treatment and Research Advancements Association for Personality Disorder |year=2004 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130526035257/http://www.tara4bpd.org/dyn/index.php?option=content&amp;task=view&amp;id=12 |archivedate=26 May 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Valerie Porr, president of Treatment and Research Advancement Association for Personality Disorders states that "the name BPD is confusing, imparts no relevant or descriptive information, and reinforces existing stigma."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tara4bpd.org/dyn/index.php?option=content&amp;task=view&amp;id=32&amp;Itemid=35 |title=How Advocacy is Bringing Borderline Personality Disorder Into the Light |first=Valerie |last=Porr |year=2001 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141020191907/http://www.tara4bpd.org/dyn/index.php?option=content&amp;task=view&amp;id=32&amp;Itemid=35 |archivedate=20 October 2014 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternative suggestions for names include ''emotional regulation disorder'' or ''[[emotional dysregulation]] disorder''. ''Impulse disorder'' and ''interpersonal regulatory disorder'' are other valid alternatives, according to [[John G. Gunderson]] of [[McLean Hospital]] in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gunderson |first1=John G. |last2=Hoffman |first2=Perry D. |title=Understanding and Treating Borderline Personality Disorder A Guide for Professionals and Families |location=Arlington, Virginia |publisher=American Psychiatric Publishing |year=2005}}{{Page needed|date=July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another term suggested by psychiatrist Carolyn Quadrio is ''post traumatic personality disorganization'' (PTPD), reflecting the condition's status as (often) both a form of chronic [[post traumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD) as well as a personality disorder.&lt;ref name="AxisOne/AxisTwo"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Quadrio |first1=C |date=December 2005 |title=Axis One/Axis Two: A disordered borderline |journal=Australian and New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry |volume=39 |pages=A97–A153 |doi=10.1111/j.1440-1614.2005.01674_39_s1.x |url=http://med.unsw.edu.au/publication/axis-oneaxis-two-disordered-borderline |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130705153948/http://med.unsw.edu.au/publication/axis-oneaxis-two-disordered-borderline |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-07-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, although many with BPD do have traumatic histories, some do not report any kind of traumatic event, which suggests that BPD is not necessarily a trauma spectrum disorder.&lt;ref name="Gratz2007" /&gt;

The Treatment and Research Advancements National Association for Personality Disorders (TARA-APD) campaigned unsuccessfully to change the name and designation of BPD in [[DSM-5]], published in May 2013, in which the name "borderline personality disorder" remains unchanged and it is not considered a trauma- and stressor-related disorder.&lt;ref name="DSM-5-borderline-663"&gt;{{harvnb|American Psychiatric Association|2013|pages=663–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Society and culture==

===Film and television===
Films and television shows have portrayed characters either explicitly diagnosed or with traits suggestive of BPD. These may be misleading if they are thought to depict this disorder accurately.&lt;ref name="Chapman_31" /&gt; The majority of researchers agree that in reality, people with BPD are very unlikely to harm others.&lt;ref name="Chapman_31"/&gt;

The films ''[[Play Misty for Me]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Reel Psychiatry: Movie Portrayals of Psychiatric Conditions|author=Robinson, David J. |year= 2003|publisher=Rapid Psychler Press |location=Port Huron, Michigan |isbn=978-1-894328-07-4|page=234}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Girl, Interrupted (film)|Girl, Interrupted]]'' (based on the [[Girl, Interrupted|memoir of the same name]]) both suggest the emotional instability of the disorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Movies and Mental Illness: Using Films to Understand Psychopathology |vauthors=Wedding D, Boyd MA, Niemiec RM |year=2005 |publisher=Hogrefe |location=Cambridge, MA |isbn=978-0-88937-292-4 |page=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1992 film ''[[Single White Female]],'' like the first example, also suggests characteristics, some of which are actually atypical of the disorder: the character Hedy had markedly disturbed sense of identity and reacts drastically to abandonment.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson (''Reel Psychiatry: Movie Portrayals of Psychiatric Conditions''), p. 235&lt;/ref&gt; In a review of the 2011 film ''[[Shame (2011 film)|Shame]]'' for the British journal ''The Art of Psychiatry'', another psychiatrist, Abby Seltzer, praises [[Carey Mulligan]]'s portrayal of a character with the disorder even though it is never mentioned onscreen.&lt;ref name="Art of Psychiatry Shame review"&gt;{{cite news|last=Seltzer|first=Abby|title=''Shame'' and ''A Dangerous Method'' reviews|url=http://www.artofpsychiatry.co.uk/shame-and-a-dangerous-method-reviews/|newspaper=The Art of Psychiatry|date=April 16, 2012|accessdate=January 13, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170116164632/http://www.artofpsychiatry.co.uk/shame-and-a-dangerous-method-reviews/|archivedate=16 January 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Films attempting to depict characters with the disorder include ''[[A Thin Line Between Love and Hate]]'', ''[[Filth (film)|Filth]]'', ''[[Fatal Attraction]]'', ''[[The Crush (1993 film)|The Crush]]'', ''[[Mad Love (1995 film)|Mad Love]]'', ''[[Malicious (1996 film)|Malicious]]'', ''[[Interiors]]'', ''[[The Cable Guy]]'', ''[[Mr. Nobody (film)|Mr. Nobody]]'', ''[[Moksha (2001 film)|Moksha]]'', ''[[Cracks (film)|Cracks]]'',&lt;ref name="RobinsonFG"&gt;{{Cite book|last = Robinson|first = David J.| title = The Field Guide to Personality Disorders| publisher = Rapid Psychler Press| year = 1999| page =113| isbn = 978-0-9680324-6-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Welcome to Me]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = O'Sullivan | first = Michael | title = Kristen Wiig earns awkward laughs and silence in ‘Welcome to Me’ | newspaper = Washington Post | location =  | pages =  | language =  | publisher =  | date = 7 May 2015 | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/goingoutguide/movies/kristen-wiig-earns-awkward-laughs-and-silence-in-welcome-to-me/2015/05/06/c26d9b78-ef6d-11e4-8abc-d6aa3bad79dd_story.html | accessdate = 3 June 2015 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150604082145/http://www.washingtonpost.com/goingoutguide/movies/kristen-wiig-earns-awkward-laughs-and-silence-in-welcome-to-me/2015/05/06/c26d9b78-ef6d-11e4-8abc-d6aa3bad79dd_story.html | archivedate = 4 June 2015 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Chang | first = Justin | title = Toronto Film Review: ‘Welcome to Me’: Kristen Wiig plays a woman with borderline personality disorder in this startlingly inspired comedy from Shira Piven | newspaper = Variety | location =  | pages =  | language =  | publisher =  | date = 11 September 2014 | url = https://variety.com/2014/film/festivals/toronto-film-review-welcome-to-me-1201304067/ | accessdate = 3 June 2015 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150617215603/http://variety.com/2014/film/festivals/toronto-film-review-welcome-to-me-1201304067/ | archivedate = 17 June 2015 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Psychiatrists Eric Bui and Rachel Rodgers argue that the character of [[Darth Vader|Anakin Skywalker/Darth Vader]] in the ''[[Star Wars]]'' films meets six of the nine diagnostic criteria; Bui also found Anakin a useful example to explain BPD to medical students. In particular, Bui points to the character's abandonment issues, uncertainty over his identity, and dissociative episodes.&lt;ref name="BPD paper"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Hsu|first=Jeremy|title=The Psychology of Darth Vader Revealed|url=http://www.livescience.com/culture/psychology-darth-vader-revealed-100604.html|publisher=TopTenReviews|work=[[LiveScience]]|date=8 June 2010|accessdate=8 June 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100826000507/http://www.livescience.com/culture/psychology-darth-vader-revealed-100604.html|archivedate=26 August 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The CW]] show ''[[Crazy Ex-Girlfriend (TV series)|Crazy Ex-Girlfriend]]'' portrays a main character with borderline personality disorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://metro.co.uk/2017/11/21/crazy-ex-girlfriend-is-the-best-depiction-of-mental-health-on-television-today-7097094/|title=Crazy Ex-Girlfriend is the best depiction of mental health on television today|date=21 November 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Awareness===
In early 2008, the [[United States House of Representatives]] declared the month of May as Borderline Personality Disorder Awareness Month.&lt;ref&gt;HR 1005, 4/1/08&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.borderlinepersonalitydisorder.com/awareness/awareness-files/background.shtml |title= BPD Awareness Month – Congressional History |work= BPD Today |publisher= Mental Health Today |accessdate= 1 November 2010 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110708083602/http://www.borderlinepersonalitydisorder.com/awareness/awareness-files/background.shtml |archivedate= 8 July 2011 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7160">{{distinguish|Cognitive shift}}

'''Cognitive shifting''' is the mental process of ''consciously'' redirecting one's [[attention]] from one fixation to another. In contrast, if this process happened ''unconsciously'',  then it is referred to as [[task switching (psychology)|task switching]].  Both are forms of [[cognitive flexibility]].

In the general framework of [[cognitive therapy]] and awareness management, cognitive shifting refers to the conscious choice to take charge of one's mental habits—and redirect one's focus of attention in helpful, more successful directions. In the term's specific usage in corporate awareness methodology, cognitive shifting is a performance-oriented technique for refocusing attention in more alert, innovative, charismatic and empathic directions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Head D, Bolton D, Hymas N |title=Deficit in cognitive shifting ability in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder |journal=Biol. Psychiatry |volume=25 |issue=7 |pages=929–37 |date=April 1989 |pmid=2720006 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0006-3223(89)90272-2 |doi=10.1016/0006-3223(89)90272-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins in cognitive therapy==
In [[cognitive therapy]], as developed by its founder [[Aaron T. Beck]] and others, a client is taught to shift his or her cognitive focus from one thought or mental fixation to a more positive, realistic focus—thus the descriptive origins of the term "cognitive shifting". In "third wave" ACT therapy as taught by [[Steven C. Hayes]] and his associates in the [[Acceptance and Commitment Therapy]] movement, cognitive shifting is employed not only to shift from negative to positive thoughts, but also to shift into a quiet state of [[mindfulness (psychology)|mindfulness]]. Cognitive shifting is also employed quite dominantly in the meditative-health procedures of medical and stress-reduction researchers such as [[Jon Kabat-Zinn]] at the University of Massachusetts Medical School.

Cognitive shifting has become a common term among [[psychotherapy|therapists]] especially on the West Coast, and more recently in discussions of mind management methodology. More recently the term, as noted above, has appeared regularly in medical and psychiatric journals etc.&lt;ref name=Sanz01/&gt;

==Examples of usage==
''In research'': The term has become fairly common in psychiatric research, used in the following manner: "Neuropsychological findings in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) have been explained in terms of '''reduced cognitive shifting ability''' as a result of low levels of frontal inhibitory activity."&lt;ref name=Sanz01&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sanz M, Molina V, Martin-Loeches M, Calcedo A, Rubia FJ |title=Auditory P300 event related potential and serotonin reuptake inhibitor treatment in obsessive-compulsive disorder patients |journal=Psychiatry Res |volume=101 |issue=1 |pages=75–81 |date=February 2001 |pmid=11223122 |doi=10.1016/S0165-1781(00)00250-X |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0165-1781(00)00250-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''In therapy'': In therapy (as in the work of Steven Hayes and associates), a client is taught first to identify and accept a negative thought or attitude, and then to allow the cognitive shifting process to re-direct attention away from the negative fixation, toward a chosen aim or goal that is more positive—thus the "accept and choose act" from whence comes the ACT therapy name. Cognitive studies of the elderly refer to "...Impaired cognitive shifting in Parkinsonian patients on anticholinergic therapy..." etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lanser MG, Berger HJ, Ellenbroek BA, Cools AR, Zitman FG |title=Perseveration in schizophrenia: failure to generate a plan and relationship with the psychomotor poverty subsyndrome |journal=Psychiatry Res |volume=112 |issue=1 |pages=13–26 |date=September 2002 |pmid=12379447 |doi=10.1016/S0165-1781(02)00178-6 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0165178102001786}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Everyday usage'': Books such as ''The Way Of The Tiger'' by [[Lance Secretan]], and ''The Creative Manager'' by Peter Russell have shown how cognitive shifting principles apply to everyday life. Decades ago [[Rollo May]] taught the process of conscious choosing and cognitive shifting at Princeton in his psychology lectures. And in books such as ''The Emotional Brain'', [[Joseph LeDoux]] clarified the power of consciously shifting from a negative to a more positive emotional focus. In  [[John Selby (psychologist)|John Selby's]] writings, most notable in ''Quiet Your Mind'', the term appears frequently.

''In meditation'': Among the first references to the general mental process of focal shifting or cognitive shifting (the term cognitive is a relatively new term), the Hindu [[Upanishads]] are probably the first written documentation of the meditative process of redirecting one's focus of attention in particular disciplined directions. Cognitive shifting is the core process of all meditation, especially in [[Kundalini energy|Kundalini]] meditation but also in [[Zen]] meditation and even in [[Christian mysticism]] where the mind's attention is re-directed (or shifted) toward particular theologically-determined focal points. Recent books have spoken directly of cognitive shifting as a meditative procedure.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

==Specific term roots==
In a recent NPR interview with Michael Toms,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ndbroadcasting.org/store/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;products_id=182/] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927234422/http://www.ndbroadcasting.org/store/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;products_id=182%2F |date=2007-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and elsewhere in his writings, John Selby attributes his initial introduction to the process of cognitive shifting to [[Jiddu Krishnamurti]], whom he considers his early spiritual teacher, and also to his training with Rollo May at Princeton. In the NPR interview, Selby says he is almost certain that he first heard the actual term from a lecture by the 1960s philosopher [[Alan Watts]] during his "Expanding Christianity" lectures at the [http://sfts.edu/ San Francisco Theological Seminary] in 1972.

==Focus phrase methodology==
The primary cognitive technology that is used for cognitive shifting is called "[[focus phrase]]" methodology. This term has emerged from the actual process in which cognitive shifting is encouraged or even provoked in a client or any other person. The person states clear intent through a specially-worded focus phrase—and then experiences the inner shift that the focus phrase elicits.

Another term sometimes used for focus phrases is "elicitor statements". In some methodologies focus phrases are said as a set of 4 to 7 statements, fairly quickly and to oneself. In other techniques a single focus phrase is held in the mind during a whole morning or day, and perhaps changed each new day during the week.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4526">A '''computer network diagram''' is a [[schematic]] depicting the nodes and connections amongst nodes in a [[computer network]] or, more generally, any [[telecommunications network]]. Computer network diagrams form an important part of [[network documentation]].

==Symbolization==
[[Image:Sample-network-diagram.png|thumb|right|400px|A sample network diagram]]
Readily identifiable icons are used to depict common network appliances e.g. Router, and the style of lines between them indicate the type of connection.  Clouds are used to represent networks external to the one pictured for the purposes of depicting connections between internal and external devices, without indicating the specifics of the outside network. For example, in the hypothetical [[local area network]] pictured to the right, three [[personal computer]]s and a [[server (computing)|server]] are connected to a [[network switch|switch]]; the server is further connected to a [[Computer printer|printer]] and a [[gateway router]], which is connected via a [[Wide area network|WAN link]] to the [[Internet]].&lt;ref name=NW&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.networkworld.com/subnets/cisco/053008-ch1-ccna-prep-library.html|title=Chapter 1: Building a Simple Network|date=29 May 2008|publisher=Network World|author=Stephen McQuerry|accessdate=16 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Depending on whether the diagram is intended for formal or informal use, certain details may be lacking and must be determined from context.  For example, the sample diagram does not indicate the physical type of connection between the PCs and the switch, but since a modern LAN is depicted, [[Ethernet]] may be assumed. If the same style of line was used in a [[Wide area network|WAN]] (wide area network) diagram, however, it may indicate a different type of connection. 

At different scales diagrams may represent various levels of network granularity. At the LAN level, individual nodes may represent individual physical devices, such as [[network hub|hubs]] or [[file server]]s, while at the WAN level, individual nodes may represent entire cities.  In addition, when the scope of a diagram crosses the common LAN/[[Metropolitan area network|MAN]]/WAN boundaries, representative hypothetical devices may be depicted instead of showing all actually existing nodes.  For example, if a network appliance is intended to be connected through the Internet to many end-user mobile devices, only a single such device may be depicted for the purposes of showing the general relationship between the appliance and any such device.

===Cisco symbolization===
[[Cisco]] uses its own brand of networking symbols. Since Cisco has a large Internet presence and designs a broad variety of network devices, its list of symbols ("Network Topology Icons") is exhaustive.&lt;ref name=cisco&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cisco.com/web/about/ac50/ac47/2.html|title=Network Topology Icons|publisher=Cisco|accessdate=16 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Topology==
{{Main|Network topology}}
The ''physical'' network topology can be directly represented in a network diagram, as it is simply the physical [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] represented by the diagrams, with network nodes as vertices and connections as undirected or direct edges (depending on the type of connection).&lt;ref name=technet&gt;{{cite web|url=https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc961037.aspx|title=Network Infrastructure|publisher=Microsoft|accessdate=16 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''logical'' network topology can be inferred from the network diagram if details of the [[network protocols]] in use are also given.

'''[[Container deposit legislation]]''' ('''CDL''') also known as a Container Deposit Scheme (CDS) is a scheme that was first implemented in [[South Australia]] in 1977 and over the decades has spread to the [[Northern Territory]] in 2012, [[New South Wales]] in 2017 and the [[Australian Capital Territory]] in June 2018. [[Queensland]] has announced it will pursue a scheme in partnership with NSW for implementation by 1 November 2018. [[Western Australia]] has also announced plans for a scheme commencing in early 2020.

Attempts to introduce similar legislation in [[Tasmania]] and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] have been unsuccessful to date. [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] did have a similar scheme in place in the 1980's called 'Cash for Cans' but was later rescinded. A [[Newspoll]] survey found a majority of people in Australia support a deposit scheme,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tandlnews.com.au/2012/08/07/article/container-deposit-scheme-gathers-momentum/|title=Container deposit scheme gathers momentum|date=7 August 2012|work=Transport &amp; Logistics News|accessdate=21 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a national scheme has also been proposed many times over the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cleanup.org.au/au/Whatelsewesupport/why-do-we-need-a-container-deposit-legislation-.html|title=Why we need a Container Deposit Scheme|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The recent [[NSW]] scheme was strongly opposed by the beverage industry and highlighted their influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/comment/beverage-giants-lobby-against-nsw-container-deposit-scheme-20141108-11iqup.html|title=Beverage giants lobby against NSW container deposit scheme|work=The Sydney Morning Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The value of deposits and the scope of their application have been influenced by the Australian federal constitution's guarantee of free trade between the states. The defining case in this issue was the attempt to introduce a differential between reusable and recyclable bottle deposits. The issue was taken to the High Court of Australia in the ''[[Castlemaine Tooheys Ltd v South Australia]]'' court case.,&lt;ref name="Tooheys HCA"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|1|1990|litigants=[[Castlemaine Tooheys Ltd v South Australia]] |parallelcite=(1990) 169 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 436 |date=7 February 1990 |courtname=[[High Court of Australia|High Court]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; State based schemes need to be exempted from the Commonwealth Mutual Recognition Act which guarantees products can be sold in any jurisdiction without requiring any special labelling. This formed the basis of legal action against the Northern Territories' scheme until an exemption was granted. South Australia, Northern Territory, New South Wales and the ACT is offering 10c to anyone who donates an empty container.

==CDL by state==

===Australian Capital Territory===
The ACT government has always been supportive of container deposit legislation, but has never acted alone due to its relatively small size and being enclaved inside the much larger state of NSW. They have always said if NSW adopts a scheme they will follow suit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canberratimes.com.au/act-news/canberra-likely-to-follow-nsw-into-refunds-for-drinks-containers-20150105-12i7m0.html|title=Canberra likely to follow NSW into refunds for drinks containers|author=Kirsten Lawson|date=14 January 2015|work=Canberra Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The ACT Container Deposit Scheme legislation was passed into law on 9 November 2017 and a public consultation was conducted ahead of  the scheme's implementation in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.yoursay.act.gov.au/act-container-deposit-scheme|title=Your say: ACT Container Deposit Scheme}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scheme began on 30 June 2018.

===New South Wales===
[[File:Reverse vending machine for the NSW Container Deposit Scheme at the Kooringal Mall 2.jpg|thumb|Reverse vending machine, December 2017.]]
The [[New South Wales]] government has indicated it wishes to push ahead with a container deposit scheme as part of a raft of new policies aimed at protecting the environment and doing more to prevent litter and pollution entering the state's rivers, oceans, and parks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-01-04/nsw-government-to-introduce-a-drinks-container-deposit-scheme/5999102|title=NSW Government set to introduce a drinks container deposit scheme|work=ABC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scheme has strong backing from the public, various politicians, NSW councils,&lt;ref name="governmentnews.com.au"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.governmentnews.com.au/2014/12/nsw-councils-back-container-deposit-scheme|title=NSW councils back container deposit scheme|work=Government News}}&lt;/ref&gt; and various environmental groups such as Cleanup Australia, Boomerang Alliance, and Total Environment Centre.

In February 2015 it was revealed that the Baird government has been under a well planned, sustained attack from multiple beverage industry companies and their executives. They have organised the lobbying of various members of parliament in NSW and other jurisdictions (even at the federal level) in order to gain influence over Mike Baird and Minister for the Environment, Rob Stokes, in order to force them to abandon plans for a container deposit scheme in NSW. The beverage industry has even threatened to run scare campaign election advertising. The government said that all of this time and money spent on lobbying has ultimately failed to change their position and the scheme will go ahead and is currently being designed. They have also invited the beverage industry to get on board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/how-beverage-companies-joined-forces-to-attack-baird-recycling-scheme-20150207-1389dx.html|title=How beverage companies joined forces to attack Baird recycling scheme|work=The Sydney Morning Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NSW government initially announced the start date of a container deposit/refund system being July 2017, however, this was extended to December 2017 following requests from environment groups and industry bodies.&lt;ref name="epa.nsw.gov.au"&gt;http://www.epa.nsw.gov.au/resources/MinMedia/EPAMinMedia17021601.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 8 May 2016 it was officially announced the NSW will be implementing a full 10c Container Deposit Scheme after looking at many options, including public submissions and industry alternatives. As it stands, drink containers from 150ml in size up to 3L will be covered as long as it has the appropriate NSW labelling. There will be some exclusions - such as wine bottles - as it is mainly targeting drink containers consumed away from home. Draft legislation will be brought forward and an implementation advisory group will be established to meet the 1 December 2017 start date. This will affect the ACT and also QLD which are currently examining options for a state based scheme.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/baird-backs-kids-over-big-beverage-10-for-every-drink-bottle-you-can-find-20160507-gooqih.html&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 July 2017 the NSW EPA announced the scheme coordinator would be a joint venture called Exchange for Change,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.exchangeforchange.com.au/&lt;/ref&gt; comprising 5 of Australian beverage companies: Asahi, Carlton &amp; United Breweries, Coca-Cola Amatil, Coopers Brewery and Lion. However, there has been some criticism of this decision given some of these organisations have actively opposed CDL in the past.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/politics/nsw/utter-stupidity-greens-attack-cokes-role-in-nsw-container-scheme-20170731-gxmh5u.html&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 December 2017, the Container Deposit Scheme, named [[Return and Earn]], officially started, as it pushed to reduce the volume of litter in NSW by 40% by 2020. During the first couple of weeks in the scheme, many people were complaining about it, which including drink prices going up, boxes and bags dumped next to the machines, the allowance of only cans and bottles that were empty, uncrushed, unbroken and had the original label attached, and also, the limited number of collection points around the state. Although there was plenty of problems throughout Return And Earn, the number of containers that were returned increased, as did the amount of collection points. The Environment Minister announced that the scheme has been a success, and they were working hard to fix the minor teething problems. During Christmas and New Years celebrations, the amount grew to over 1 million containers returned a day, and then to over 3 million in towards April March. As of 17 April, there is a growing number of the 549 collection points available out of the planned 800+, and over 240 million containers have been returned throughout the state. A common label has been developed which will start appearing on bottles and cans: "10c refund at collection depots/points in participating State/Territory of purchase."

===Northern Territory===
The [[Northern Territory]] introduced a container deposit scheme similar to South Australia's from 3 January 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nretas.nt.gov.au/environment-protection/containerdeposit |title=Archived copy |accessdate=22 August 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017042522/http://www.nretas.nt.gov.au/environment-protection/containerdeposit |archivedate=17 October 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was challenged in the Federal Court by [[Coca-Cola Amatil]], [[Schweppes Australia]] and [[Lion (Australasian company)|Lion Pty Ltd]] using the Commonwealth Mutual Recognition Act and the scheme ceased on 4 March 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/business/companies/coca-cola-wins-federal-court-case-cash-for-containers-recycling-found-illegal/story-fnda1bsz-1226590179763|title=Coca-Cola wins Federal Court case, cash for containers recycling found illegal|work=News.com.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; Immediately after the Federal Court loss, the NT government personally stepped in to keep the scheme going until a permanent exemption to the Mutual Recognition Act could be secured. On 7 August 2013 the Federal Executive Council (ExCo) ratified the permanent exemption making the NT container deposit scheme completely legal and permanent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-08-07/nt-container-deposit-schme-back-on-track-federal-law-exemption/4870244|title=Container deposit scheme back on full-bottle track|work=www.abc.net.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to this, all beverage containers sold in Australia now must bear the words "10c refund at SA/NT collection depots in state/territory of purchase". With other jurisdictions implementing their own schemes a common label has been developed which will start appearing on bottles and cans: "10c refund at collection depots/points in participating State/Territory of purchase"

===Queensland===
In 2013, the [[Newman government]] has indicated it does not want to increase the cost of QLD residents' costs of living, seeing the refund scheme as more of a tax rather than a refundable deposit even though 85% of Queenslanders are in favor of a scheme according to a Newspoll.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/most-queenslanders-want-container-deposit-laws-introduced-but-the-government-cans-the-idea/story-fnihsrf2-1226666475414&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2015, the newly elected [[Palaszczuk Ministry|Palaszczuk government]] indicated a total overhaul of the state's environmental policies including supporting a national container deposit scheme and also a state based container deposit scheme. It is likely that QLD will follow suit with NSW.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.resourcerecovery.biz/news/labor-poised-overhaul-queensland-recycling-policies&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2015 the QLD government announced its support for a Cash for Containers scheme in Queensland, potentially in 2018 after NSW implements its own scheme. The QLD environment minister says he was inspired by trash that was sent to his office. He has ordered a review and wants to establish an advisory group to help his department with a consultation process with the public and stake holders commencing later this year. He also says he will work with NSW.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/queensland/environment-minister-steven-miles-tackles-queenslands-recycling-issue-20150520-gh5zm3.html|title=Environment Minister Steven Miles tackles Queensland's recycling issue|author=Amy Remeikis|date=20 May 2015|work=Brisbane Times}}
As of May 2016, with NSW formally signing off on a full 10c CDS - it is likely QLD will adopt a similar model for implementation in 2018. QLD is observing the NSW situation closely.
&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually the [[Queensland]] government on 22 July 2016 announced that State will have a Container Deposit Scheme "to get drink cans and bottles off our beaches, and out of our parks and public areas"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Container deposit scheme for Queensland|url=http://statements.qld.gov.au/Statement/2016/7/22/container-deposit-scheme-for-queensland|website=qld.gov.au|publisher=Queensland government|accessdate=27 July 2016|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 
The Queensland Container Refund Scheme (CRS) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Quensland Container Refund Scheme|url=https://www.qld.gov.au/environment/pollution/management/waste/container-refund-about|website=qld.gov.au|publisher=Queensland government|accessdate=27 July 2016|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt; was to start from 1 July 2018 but was delayed to 1 November 2018.

===South Australia===
{{see also|Castlemaine Tooheys Ltd v South Australia}}
In the days when bottles were washed and re-used, drinks manufacturers paid shopkeepers and "marine store collectors" ("bottle-ohs") for the return of their (proprietary) containers, both bottles and crates. By arrangement between the manufacturers, the refund to the consumer was standardized (for many decades 2d, later 6d or 5c. for soft drink bottles and ½d for generic beer bottles) and the collectors received a premium for their part in the process. A substantial cost was incurred by the manufacturer in the transportation, sorting, storage, washing and sterilizing of the bottles and their inspection for contamination and damage. With the advent of cheaper single-use bottles great savings were achievable, and their subsequent disposal the responsibility of the consumer.

CDL in [[South Australia]] was put in place under the Beverage Container Act 1975 (SA) and came into operation in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.sa.gov.au/LZ/C/A/BEVERAGE%20CONTAINER%20ACT%201975/1995.04.30_%281988.03.10%29/1975.77.PDF|title=Beverage Container Act 1975|year=1975|publisher=Government of South Australia|accessdate=23 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Environment Protection Act 1993]] (SA) now governs the levying and refund of deposits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.sa.gov.au/LZ/C/A/Environment%20Protection%20Act%201993.aspx|title=South Australian Legislation – Environment Protection Act 1993|publisher=Attorney-General's Department, Government of South Australia|accessdate=21 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a refund of 10 cents per can or bottle&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bottlebill.org/legislation/world/australia.htm|title=BottleBill.org – Beverage Container Legislation in Australia|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (raised from 5 cents in late 2008). In the 1970s deposits ranged from 20c for a 30 oz bottle and 10c for a 10 oz and 6½ oz bottle. With the introduction of plastic and non re-usable bottles the deposit was reduced to 5c (including aluminium cans). This amount remained unchanged for around thirty years.

Around 600 people are employed in the recovery of bottles in South Australia. Groups such as the Scouts operate container refund depots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greens.org.nz/searchdocs/other7680.html|title=What are Bottle Bills|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While there are professional collectors who collect on an arranged basis from particular venues (e.g. pubs and restaurants), usually operating small trucks for the job, there are also many socially marginalised collectors who forage in spots such as refuse bins for discarded deposit bottles; these collectors often travel by bicycle, sometimes with relatively elaborate and inventive modifications to allow them to carry bulky loads of bottles.

Until 2008, every beverage container in Australia bore the words "5c refund at SA collection depots in state of purchase". This changed to "10c refund at SA collection depots in state of purchase" in late 2008. Since the [[Northern Territory]] started their own scheme in 2012, this message has changed again. With other jurisdictions implementing their own schemes a common label has been developed which will start appearing on bottles and cans: "10c refund at collection depots/points in participating State/Territory of purchase".

===Tasmania===
In December 2014 a state based deposit scheme was rejected by the government, citing costs and the need to ship containers to the Australian mainland for processing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-12-20/knock-back-for-container-deposit-scheme-tas/5980924|title=Container deposit scheme rejected in Tasmania after report estimates $4m cost|work=ABC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various environmental organisations, including The Greens and many Tasmanian local councils&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.governmentnews.com.au/2013/12/tasmanian-councils-harden-push-for-container-deposit-scheme/|title=Tasmanian councils harden push for container deposit scheme|work=Government News}}&lt;/ref&gt; have been pushing for a scheme in Tasmania for many years. Most people are in favour of a scheme according to various studies that have been conducted over the years.

In 2018 the Tasmanian Government has made a commitment to consider establishing a Container Refund Scheme (CRS) and has engaged a consulting company to produce a report with recommendations. This report is now available and the Tasmanian Government is now reviewing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://epa.tas.gov.au/policy/other-topics/resource-recovery/container-deposit-scheme|title=Studies into Container Deposit Systems}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Victoria===
The state of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] once had a container deposit scheme in the 1980's called "Cash for Cans" but was rescinded in 1989.&lt;ref name="governmentnews.com.au"/&gt;
In 2009 the [[Victorian Greens]] introduced a bill for a 10c deposit scheme, which was passed in the [[Victorian Legislative Council|upper house]] but the government quashed the bill in the [[Victorian Legislative Assembly|lower house]], allegedly on constitutional grounds, by refusing to allow it to be debated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last = McMahon |first = Stephen |title = Brumby Government halts Greens law to reintroduce bottle deposit system| work = HeraldSun |date = 25 June 2009 | url = http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/brumby-government-halts-greens-law-to-reintroduce-bottle-deposit-system/story-e6frf7jo-1225739810093 | accessdate = 22 August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite supporting the Greens' bill when in opposition, when it later became the government the [[Coalition (Australia)|Coalition]] decided it would not back a bottle refund scheme. Instead, it said it would support a national scheme if one were created.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lucas|first=Clay|title=Baillieu retreats on bottle refund scheme|url=http://www.theage.com.au/environment/baillieu-retreats-on-bottle-refund-scheme-20120304-1ub4u.html|accessdate=25 January 2013|newspaper=The Age|date=5 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012/2013, the Napthine government indicated its strong support&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/victorian-premier-denis-napthine-backs-cashforcans-recycling-scheme-20140322-35ab5.html|title=Victorian Premier Denis Napthine backs cash-for-cans recycling scheme|work=The Age}}&lt;/ref&gt; for a state based scheme possibly in partnership with NSW. Since there has now been a change of government, the legislation has not been introduced into parliament as of January 2015.

In February 2015, the then Environment Minister [[Lisa Neville]] has publicly said she is not in favour of a container deposit scheme for Victoria. She believes current recycling programs are good enough, even though Clean-up Australia claims beverage related rubbish in Victoria now outnumbers cigarette related rubbish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/lisa-neville-against-cashforcontainers-recycling-scheme-in-victoria-20150107-12j14t.html|title=Lisa Neville against cash-for-containers recycling scheme in Victoria|work=The Age}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In July 2017 her successor [[Lily D'Ambrosio]] confirmed the state's continuing opposition to a state scheme on the basis that the costs would outweigh the environmental benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Heffernan|first1=Madeleine|last2=Preiss|first2=Benjamin|title=Victoria open to 'going it alone' on plastic bag ban if national deal not reached|url=http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/victoria-open-to-going-it-alone-on-plastic-bag-ban-if-national-deal-not-reached-20170725-gxi9av.html|accessdate=24 September 2017|work=The Age|publisher=Fairfax Media|date=27 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2018, Victorian Environment Minister [[Lily D'Ambrosio]] announced a $37m package to tackle recycling in her State. Although she is no longer explicitly saying a CDS for Victoria is off the table, she has stated that she is carefully monitoring the situation in NSW in relation to the newly rolled out scheme.
There are private companies that accept used aluminum cans and pay cash for them - usually by weight or by per filled 'metal storage cage'.

===Western Australia===
In 2011, opposition [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] and [[Australian Greens|Greens]] MPs called for the introduction of a container deposit scheme. The Minister for Environment, [[Bill Marmion]], said that WA would wait for a national "consultation regulatory impact statement" to be completed at the end of 2011 before taking any action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-11-16/container-deposit-feature/3675712|title=A container deposit scheme is proposed for WA|first1=Oliver|last1=Peterson|date=16 November 2011|publisher=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2016, the WA Government announced a State container deposit scheme commencing in 2018. Minister for the Environment [[Albert Jacob]] said that efforts to pursue a national scheme had "fallen by the wayside" but that Western Australia's policy should be aligned with recent changes in Queensland and New South Wales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-08-17/10-cent-container-deposit-scheme-for-wa-recyclable-bottles-cans/7751328|title=WA container deposit scheme: Consumers to get 10c for bottles, cans in recycling push|first1=Andrew|last1=O'Connor|date=17 August 2016|publisher=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After a change of government at the March 2017 election, the new Environment Minister [[Stephen Dawson (politician)|Stephen Dawson]] said he wanted to make a container deposit scheme a priority and in August 2017. The new WA Government held public consultation and will start a container deposit scheme in January 2020 in a bid to lift the State’s low recycling rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.der.wa.gov.au/our-work/programs/111-wa-container-deposit-scheme|title=WA Container Deposit Scheme|publisher=Government of Western Australia |accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical==
Through the early 20th century, when the cost of producing glass bottles was higher, a natural industry of glass bottle collectors and merchants performed a similar function to the modern CDL. Bottle accumulators, a licensed and unionized workforce commonly known as "bottle-ohs" from their [[street cries]], travelled by cart around the streets buying empty bottles from households and businesses. They would then sell the bottles to a bottle yard, which would store and sort the bottles before selling them in bulk to brewers and other bottlers. It was an industry from which a bottle-oh could make a good living; in 1904, they could buy a dozen beer bottles for 6[[Penny (Australian)|d.]], sell them to the bottle yard for 9d., who could sell them to brewers for 1[[shilling (Australian)|s.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[The Evening News (Sydney)|Evening News]]
|date=28 January 1904|page=2|title=How people live V: the accumulator – money in bottles|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/112789298}}&lt;/ref&gt; The commercial reuse of glass bottles and the bottle collecting industry had all but disappeared by the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[Sydney Morning Herald]]|page=2|title=The silence of the bottle-oh|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/18244445|date=15 December 1951}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Soft drink and other beverage bottles were still collected in Queensland and returned for deposits up to the late 1960s.

== Early life and education ==

She was born to Dipok Kumar Ghosh and Indira Ghosh in October 30, 1988.She went to Aparnacharan school and [[Chittagong Cantonment Public College]].She completed her B.Sc in Electrical and Electronics Engineering (EEE) from [[Chittagong University of Engineering &amp; Technology]] and MSc in Electrical Power Engineering from [[RWTH Aachen University]].

==Career==
She started her career as a lecturer in [[Premier University, Chittagong]]. Then go to Germany and did intership in [[Infineon Technologies]]. From the very beginning, her intention was to work with environment-friendly technology and renewable energy. So after completing M.Sc. from [[RWTH]] she joined the research team of Hy-4 project.Josef Kallo . &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Prof. Dr. Josef Kallo|url=https://www.uni-ulm.de/en/in/institute-for-energy-conversion-and-storage/institut/personen/prof-dr-ing-josef-kallo/|accessdate=28 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the chief researcher of this project. On 29 September 2016, the HY4 aircraft took off its first official flight. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Zero-emission air transport – first flight of four-seat passenger aircraft HY4|url=http://hy4.org/zero-emission-air-transport-first-flight-of-four-seat-passenger-aircraft-hy4}}&lt;/ref&gt; from [[Stuttgart Airport]]. The HY4 is the world’s first four-seat passenger aircraft powered solely by a hydrogen fuel cell system. A successful flight of a four-plane passenger plane, at the Stuttgart Airport in Germany, was completed on that day. Being a member of this research team she became part of the  history of civil aviation in the world.

She also runs a web portal ''German Probashe''. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=German Probashe|url=http://www.germanprobashe.com/|website=germanprobashe|accessdate=28 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; .

'''Deductive closure''' is a [[property (philosophy)|property]] of a [[set (mathematics)|set]] of [[object (philosophy)|objects]] (usually the objects in question are [[statement (logic)|statement]]s). A [[set (mathematics)|set]] of objects, &lt;var&gt;O&lt;/var&gt;, is said to exhibit ''closure'' or to be ''closed'' under a given [[closure operator|operation]], &lt;var&gt;R&lt;/var&gt;, provided that for every object, &lt;var&gt;x&lt;/var&gt;, if &lt;var&gt;x&lt;/var&gt; is a member of &lt;var&gt;O&lt;/var&gt; and &lt;var&gt;x&lt;/var&gt; is &lt;var&gt;R&lt;/var&gt;-related to any object, &lt;var&gt;y&lt;/var&gt;, then &lt;var&gt;y&lt;/var&gt; is a member of &lt;var&gt;O&lt;/var&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter D. Klein]], ''Closure'', ''[[The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy]] (second edition)&lt;/ref&gt; In the context of statements, a deductive closure is the set of all the statements that can be [[Deductive reasoning|deduced]] from a given set of statements.

In [[propositional calculus|propositional logic]], the set of all true propositions exhibits '''deductive closure''': if set &lt;var&gt;O&lt;/var&gt; is the set of true propositions, and operation &lt;var&gt;R&lt;/var&gt; is [[logical consequence]] (“&lt;math&gt;\vdash&lt;/math&gt;”), then provided that proposition &lt;var&gt;p&lt;/var&gt; is a member of &lt;var&gt;O&lt;/var&gt; and &lt;var&gt;p&lt;/var&gt; is &lt;var&gt;R&lt;/var&gt;-related to &lt;var&gt;q&lt;/var&gt; (i.e., p&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\vdash&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;q), &lt;var&gt;q&lt;/var&gt; is also a member of &lt;var&gt;O&lt;/var&gt;.

== Epistemic closure ==
{{main|Epistemic closure}}

In [[epistemology]], many philosophers have and continue to debate whether particular subsets of [[proposition]]s—especially ones ascribing [[knowledge]] or [[Theory of justification|justification]] of a [[belief]] to a subject—are closed under deduction.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1973">'''Deidentification''' is defined as the process in which one [[sibling]] defines their [[Identity (social science)|identity]] by intentionally attempting to be different from the other. [[Adolescent]]s begin to go through deidentification for a number of reasons. It commonly occurs as a result from issues within the [[sibling relationship]]. Adolescents go through deidentification as a [[defense mechanism]] for eliminating [[sibling rivalry]].&lt;ref name="SFF"/&gt; When siblings closely resemble each other, it can make finding an identity difficult. This can lead to strong [[Competitiveness|competitive]] behaviors and increased [[aggression]] between siblings. One survey concluded that 62% of [[high school senior]]s had physically struck their sibling in the past year.&lt;ref name="MRH"/&gt; The Process of deidentification decreases the chance of sibling rivalry. Deidentification allows them to branch off to form their own, different identity and to become familiarized with their individual [[Personality type|personality]]. According to [[research]], they may also begin the process of deidentification to protect themselves from social comparison.&lt;ref name="WSD"/&gt; Not all siblings will go through deidentification. It is more common in siblings who share common characteristics, such as age and sex.

==Etymology==
[[File:Dhamma inscription.jpg|thumb|The [[Prakrit]] word "''Dha-ṃ-ma''"/[[wikt:𑀥𑀁𑀫|𑀥𑀁𑀫]] ([[Sanskrit]]: Dharma [[wikt:धर्म#Sanskrit|धर्म]]) in the [[Brahmi script]], as inscribed by Emperor [[Ashoka]] in his [[Edicts of Ashoka]] (3rd century BCE).]]
The [[Classical Sanskrit]] noun ''dharma'' ([[wikt:धर्म#Sanskrit|धर्म]]) or the [[Prakrit]] Dhaṃma ([[wikt:𑀥𑀁𑀫|𑀥𑀁𑀫]]) are a derivation from the root ''dhṛ'', which means "to hold, maintain, keep",{{refn|group=note|name="Monier Williams"|Monier Williams, ''A Sanskrit Dictionary'' (1899): "to hold , bear (also bring forth) , carry , maintain , preserve, keep , possess , have , use , employ , practise , undergo"&lt;ref&gt;Monier Willams.&lt;/ref&gt;}} and takes a meaning of "what is established or firm", and hence "law". It is derived from an older [[Vedic Sanskrit]] ''n''-stem ''dharman-'', with a literal meaning of "bearer, supporter", in a [[Historical Vedic religion|religious sense]]  conceived as an aspect of [[Rta]].{{sfn|Day|1982|pp=42–45}}

In the [[Rigveda]], the word appears as an ''n''-stem, ''{{IAST|dhárman-}}'', with a range of meanings encompassing "something established or firm" (in the literal sense of prods or poles). Figuratively, it means "sustainer" and "supporter" (of deities). It is semantically similar to the Greek ''[[Themis]]'' ("fixed decree, statute, law").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brereton|first=Joel P.|date=December 2004|title=Dhárman In The Rgveda|journal=Journal of Indian Philosophy|language=English|volume=32|issue=5–6|pages=449–489|doi=10.1007/s10781-004-8631-8|issn=0022-1791|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Classical Sanskrit]], the noun becomes thematic: ''{{IAST|dharma-}}''.

The word ''dharma'' derives from [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] root 
*''[[wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/dʰer-|*dʰer-]]'' ("to hold"),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |editor-first=Helmut |editor-last=Rix |editor-link=Helmut Rix |title=Lexikon der indogermanischen Verben |year=2001 |language=German |page=145 |publisher=Dr. Ludwig Reichert Verlag |edition=2nd |location=Wiesbaden|title-link=Lexikon der indogermanischen Verben }}&lt;/ref&gt; which in Sanskrit is reflected as class-1 root{{clarify|date=January 2018|What is a "class-1 root"? I find no article on that topic and no mention of it in the article about Sanskrit. Does that correspond with the numbering in the "Sonority hierarchy" section of the "Proto-Indo-European root" article?}} ''[[wikt:धरति#Sanskrit|dhṛ]]''. Etymologically it is related to [[Avestan language|Avestan]] dar- ("to hold"), Latin ''[[wikt:firmus#Latin|firmus]]'' ("steadfast, stable, powerful"), Lithuanian ''[[wikt:derėti#Lithuanian|derė́ti]]'' ("to be suited, fit"), Lithuanian ''dermė'' ("agreement")&lt;ref&gt;Karl Brugmann, ''Elements of the Comparative Grammar of the Indo-Germanic languages'',  Volume III, B. Westermann &amp; Co., New York, 1892, p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''darna'' ("harmony") and [[Old Church Slavonic]] ''[[wikt:дръжати#Old Church Slavonic|drъžati]]'' ("to hold, possess").
*Classical Sanskrit word ''dharmas'' would formally match with Latin o-stem ''[[wikt:firmus#Latin|firmus]]'' from [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] ''dʰer-mo-s'' "holding", were it not for its historical development from earlier Rigvedic n-stem.

In Classical Sanskrit, and in the [[Vedic Sanskrit]] of the [[Atharvaveda]], the stem is thematic: ''{{IAST|dhárma-}}'' ([[Devanāgarī]]: धर्म). In [[Prakrit]] and [[Pāli]], it is rendered ''dhamma''. In some [[Indo-Aryan languages#Contemporary languages|contemporary Indian languages]] and dialects it alternatively occurs as ''dharm''.

;Ancient translations
When the [[Mauryan Empire|Mauryan Emperor]] [[Ashoka]] wanted in the 3rd century BCE to translate the word "Dharma" (he used [[Prakrit]] word ''[[Dhamma|Dhaṃma]]'') into Greek and Aramaic, he used the Greek word ''[[Eusebeia]]'' (εὐσέβεια,  piety, spiritual maturity, or godliness) in the [[Kandahar Bilingual Rock Inscription]] and the [[Kandahar Greek Edict of Ashoka|Kandahar Greek Edicts]], and the [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] word ''Qsyt'' ("Truth") in the [[Kandahar Bilingual Rock Inscription]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hiltebeitel |first1=Alf |title=Dharma: Its Early History in Law, Religion, and Narrative |date=2011 |publisher=Oxford University Press, USA |isbn=9780195394238 |pages=36–37 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U4NF8pYxdvIC&amp;pg=PA36 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dharma is a concept of central importance in [[Indian philosophy]] and [[Indian religions|religion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dhand|first=Arti|date=17 December 2002|title=The Dharma of Ethics, the Ethics of Dharma: Quizzing the Ideals of Hinduism|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1467-9795.00113/abstract|journal=Journal of Religious Ethics|language=en|volume=30|issue=3|page=351|doi=10.1111/1467-9795.00113|issn=1467-9795|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has multiple meanings in Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It is difficult to provide a single concise definition for ''dharma'', as the word has a long and varied history and straddles a complex set of meanings and interpretations.&lt;ref&gt;J. A. B. Van Buitenen, "Dharma and Moksa", ''Philosophy East and West'', Volume 7, Number 1/2 (April–July 1957), p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; There is no equivalent single-word synonym for ''dharma'' in western languages.&lt;ref name=lraw&gt;See:

There have been numerous, conflicting attempts to translate ancient Sanskrit literature with the word ''dharma'' into German, English and French. The concept, claims Paul Horsch,&lt;ref name=paulhorsch/&gt; has caused exceptional difficulties for modern commentators and translators. For example, while Grassmann's&lt;ref&gt;Hermann Grassmann, ''Worterbuch zum Rig-veda'' (German Edition), Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120816367}}&lt;/ref&gt; translation of Rig-veda identifies seven different meanings of dharma, [[Karl Friedrich Geldner]] in his translation of the Rig-veda employs 20 different translations for dharma, including meanings such as "law", "order", "duty", "custom", "quality", and "model", among others.&lt;ref name=paulhorsch/&gt; However, the word ''dharma'' has become a widely accepted [[loanword]] in English, and is included in all modern unabridged English dictionaries.

The root of the word ''dharma'' is "dhri", which means "to support, hold, or bear". It is the thing that regulates the course of change by not participating in change, but that principle which remains constant.&lt;ref name=stevenrosen&gt;Steven Rosen (2006), ''Essential Hinduism'', Praeger, {{ISBN|0-275-99006-0}}, pp. 34–45.&lt;/ref&gt; Monier-Williams, the widely cited resource for definitions and explanation of Sanskrit words and concepts of Hinduism, offers&lt;ref&gt;see:

Yet, each of these definitions is incomplete, while combination of these translations do not convey the total sense of the word. In common parlance, ''dharma'' means "right way of living" and "path of rightness".&lt;ref name=stevenrosen/&gt;

The meaning of the word ''dharma'' depends on the context, and its meaning has evolved as ideas of Hinduism have developed through history. In the earliest texts and ancient myths of Hinduism, ''dharma'' meant cosmic law, the rules that created the universe from chaos, as well as rituals; in later [[Vedas]], [[Upanishads]], [[Puranas]] and the [[Indian epic poetry|Epics]], the meaning became refined, richer, and more complex, and the word was applied to diverse contexts.&lt;ref name=phph&gt;see:

In certain contexts, ''dharma'' designates human behaviours considered necessary for order of things in the universe, principles that prevent chaos, behaviours and action necessary to all life in nature, society, family as well as at the individual level.&lt;ref name="ODWR-Dharma" /&gt;&lt;ref name=phph/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;see:

In Buddhism, ''dharma'' incorporates the teachings and doctrines of the founder of Buddhism, [[Gautama Buddha|the Buddha]].

==History==
According to the authoritative book ''[[History of Dharmasastra (P.V. Kane)|History of Dharmasastra]]'', in the hymns of the Rigveda the word dharma appears at least fifty-six times, as an adjective or noun. According to Paul Horsch,&lt;ref name=paulhorsch&gt;Horsch, Paul, "From Creation Myth to World Law: the Early History of Dharma", ''Journal of Indian Philosophy'', December 2004, Volume 32, Issue 5-6, pp. 423–448.&lt;/ref&gt; the word dharma has its origin in the myths of Vedic Hinduism. The Brahman (whom all the gods make up), claim the hymns of the Rig Veda, created the universe from chaos, they hold (dhar-) the earth and sun and stars apart, they support (dhar-) the sky away and distinct from earth, and they stabilise (dhar-) the quaking mountains and plains.&lt;ref name=paulhorsch/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;RgVeda 6.70.1, 8.41.10, 10.44.8, for secondary source see [[Karl Friedrich Geldner]], Der Rigveda in Auswahl (2 vols.), Stuttgart; and [[Harvard Oriental Series]], 33–36, Bd. 1–3: 1951.&lt;/ref&gt; The gods, mainly [[Indra]], then deliver and hold order from disorder, harmony from chaos, stability from instability – actions recited in the Veda with the root of word dharma.&lt;ref name=phph/&gt; In hymns composed after the mythological verses, the word dharma takes expanded meaning as a cosmic principle and appears in verses independent of gods. It evolves into a concept, claims Paul Horsch,&lt;ref name=paulhorsch/&gt; that has a dynamic functional sense in [[Atharvaveda]] for example, where it becomes the cosmic law that links cause and effect through a subject. Dharma, in these ancient texts, also takes a ritual meaning. The ritual is connected to the cosmic, and "dharmani" is equated to ceremonial devotion to the principles that gods used to create order from disorder, the world from chaos.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Horsch, "From Creation Myth to World Law: the Early History of Dharma", ''Journal of Indian Philosophy'', December 2004, Volume 32, Issue 5-6, pp. 430–431.&lt;/ref&gt; Past the ritual and cosmic sense of dharma that link the current world to mythical universe, the concept extends to ethical-social sense that links human beings to each other and to other life forms. It is here that dharma as a concept of law emerges in Hinduism.&lt;ref&gt;P. Thieme, Gedichte aus dem Rig-Veda, Reclam Universal-Bibliothek Nr. 8930, pp. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul Horsch, "From Creation Myth to World Law: the Early History of Dharma", ''Journal of Indian Philosophy'', December 2004, Volume 32, Issue 5-6, pp. 430–432.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dharma and related words are found in the oldest Vedic literature of Hinduism, in later Vedas, Upanishads, Puranas, and the Epics; the word dharma also plays a central role in the literature of other Indian religions founded later, such as Buddhism and Jainism.&lt;ref name="phph"/&gt; According to Brereton,&lt;ref name=jbrereton/&gt; ''Dharman'' occurs 63 times in [[Rigveda|Rig-veda]]; in addition, words related to Dharman also appear in Rig-veda, for example once as dharmakrt, 6 times as ''satyadharman'', and once as ''dharmavant'', 4 times as ''dharman'' and twice as ''dhariman''. 

[[Indo-European studies|Indo-European]] parallels for "Dharma" are known, but the only Iranian equivalent is Old Persian ''darmān'' "remedy", the meaning of which is rather removed from [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan]] ''dhárman'', suggesting that the word "Dharma" did not have a major role in the [[Indo-Iranian period|Indo-Iranian]] period, and was principally developed more recently under the Vedic tradition.&lt;ref name=jbrereton&gt;Joel Brereton (2004), "Dharman in the RgVeda", ''Journal of Indian Philosophy'',  Vol. 32, [https://www.academia.edu/5993798/Dh_rman_In_The_Rgveda pp. 449–489]. "There are Indo-European parallels to dhárman (cf. Wennerberg 1981: 95f.), but the only Iranian equivalent is Old Persian darmān ‘remedy’, which has little bearing on Indo-Aryan dhárman. There is thus no evidence that IIr. *dharman was a signiﬁcant culture word during the Indo-Iranian period." (p.449) "The origin of the concept of dharman rests in its formation. It is a Vedic, rather than an Indo-Iranian word, and a more recent coinage than many other key religious terms of the Vedic tradition. Its meaning derives directly from dhr ‘support, uphold, give foundation to’ and therefore ‘foundation’ is a reasonable gloss in most of its attestations." (p.485)&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is thought that the ''[[Daena]]'' of [[Zoroastrianism]], also meaning the "eternal Law" or "religion", is related to Sanskrit "Dharma".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Morreall |first1=John |last2=Sonn |first2=Tamara |title=The Religion Toolkit: A Complete Guide to Religious Studies |date=2011 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=9781444343717 |page=324 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aM461tmUDe4C&amp;pg=PT324 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ideas in parts overlapping to ''Dharma'' are found in other ancient cultures: such as Chinese [[Tao]], Egyptian [[Maat]], Sumerian [[Me (mythology)|Me]].&lt;ref name="stevenrosen"/&gt;

[[File:AsokaKandahar.jpg|thumb|220px|The [[Kandahar Bilingual Rock Inscription]] is from Indian [[Emperor Asoka]] in 258 BC, and found in [[Afghanistan]]. The inscription renders the word ''Dharma'' in Sanskrit as [[Eusebeia]] in Greek, suggesting ''dharma'' in ancient India meant spiritual maturity, devotion, piety, duty towards and reverence for human community.&lt;ref name=paulhacker/&gt;]]
In mid-20th century, an inscription of the Indian [[Emperor Asoka]] from the year 258 BC was discovered in Afghanistan, the [[Kandahar Bilingual Rock Inscription]]. This rock inscription contains [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] text. According to [[:de:Paul Hacker|Paul Hacker]],&lt;ref name=paulhacker/&gt; on the rock appears a Greek rendering for the Sanskrit word dharma: the word [[eusebeia]].&lt;ref name=paulhacker&gt;Paul Hacker (1965), "Dharma in Hinduism", ''[[Journal of Indian Philosophy]]'', Volume 34, Issue 5, pp. 479–496 (English translated version by Donald R. Davis (2006)).&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars of Hellenistic Greece explain eusebeia as a complex concept. Eusebia means not only to venerate gods, but also spiritual maturity, a reverential attitude toward life, and includes the right conduct toward one's parents, siblings and children, the right conduct between husband and wife, and the conduct between biologically unrelated people. This rock inscription, concludes Paul Hacker,&lt;ref name=paulhacker/&gt; suggests dharma in India, about 2300 years ago, was a central concept and meant not only religious ideas, but ideas of right, of good, of one's duty toward the human community.&lt;ref&gt;[[Etienne Lamotte]], Bibliotheque du Museon 43, Louvain, 1958, p. 249.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rta, maya and dharma===
The evolving literature of Hinduism linked ''dharma'' to two other important concepts: ''Ṛta'' and ''Māyā''. [[Ṛta]] in Vedas is the truth and cosmic principle which regulates and coordinates the operation of the universe and everything within it.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Holdrege (2004), "Dharma" in: Mittal &amp; Thursby (Editors) The Hindu World, New York: Routledge, {{ISBN|0-415-21527-7}}, pp. 213–248.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=koller/&gt; [[Māyā]] in Rig-veda and later literature means illusion, fraud, deception, magic that misleads and creates disorder,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibiblio.org/sripedia/ebooks/mw/0800/mw__0844.html Māyā] Monier-Williams Sanskrit English Dictionary, {{ISBN|978-8120603691}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus is contrary to reality, laws and rules that establish order, predictability and harmony. Paul Horsch&lt;ref name=paulhorsch/&gt; suggests Ṛta and dharma are parallel concepts, the former being a cosmic principle, the latter being of moral social sphere; while Māyā and dharma are also analogous concepts, the former being that which corrupts law and moral life, the later being that which strengthens law and moral life.&lt;ref name=koller&gt;Koller, J. M. (1972), "Dharma: an expression of universal order", ''Philosophy East and West'', 22(2), pp. 136–142.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Northrop, F. S. C. (1949), "Naturalistic and cultural foundations for a more effective international law", ''Yale Law Journal'', 59, pp. 1430–1441.&lt;/ref&gt;

Day proposes dharma is a manifestation of Ṛta, but suggests Ṛta may have been subsumed into a more complex concept of dharma, as the idea developed in ancient India over time in a nonlinear manner.{{sfn|Day|1982|pp=42–44}} The following verse from the [[Rigveda]] is an example where ''rta'' and dharma are linked:
{{quote|O Indra, lead us on the path of Rta, on the right path over all evils...|[[Mandala 10|RV 10]].133.6}}

Dharma is an organising principle in Hinduism that applies to human beings in solitude, in their interaction with human beings and nature, as well as between inanimate objects, to all of cosmos and its parts.&lt;ref name=stevenrosen/&gt; It refers to the order and customs which make life and universe possible, and includes behaviours, rituals, rules that govern society, and ethics.&lt;ref name="ODWR-Dharma" /&gt;{{refn|group=note|name="ODWR-Dharma"}} Hindu dharma includes the religious duties, moral rights and duties of each individual, as well as behaviours that enable social order, right conduct, and those that are virtuous.&lt;ref&gt;"Dharma", ''The Columbia Encyclopedia'', 6th Ed. (2013), Columbia University Press, Gale, {{ISBN|978-0787650155}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dharma, according to Van Buitenen,&lt;ref name=vanbuitenen&gt;J. A. B. Van Buitenen, "Dharma and Moksa", ''Philosophy East and West'', Vol. 7, No. 1/2 (Apr. – Jul., 1957), pp. 33–40&lt;/ref&gt; is that which all existing beings must accept and respect to sustain harmony and order in the world. It is neither the act nor the result, but the natural laws that guide the act and create the result to prevent chaos in the world. It is innate characteristic, that makes the being what it is. It is, claims Van Buitenen, the pursuit and execution of one's nature and true calling, thus playing one's role in cosmic concert. In Hinduism, it is the dharma of the bee to make honey, of cow to give milk, of sun to radiate sunshine, of river to flow.&lt;ref name=vanbuitenen/&gt; In terms of humanity, dharma is the need for, the effect of and essence of service and interconnectedness of all life.&lt;ref name=stevenrosen/&gt;&lt;ref name=paulhacker/&gt;

In Hinduism, ''dharma'' includes two aspects – ''[[sanātana dharma]]'', which is the overall, unchanging and abiding principals of dharma and is not subject to change, and ''[[yuga dharma]]'', which is valid for a [[yuga]], an epoch or age as established by Hindu tradition.

===In Vedas and Upanishads===
The [[Dharma#History|history section]] of this article discusses the development of dharma concept in Vedas. This development continued in the Upanishads and later ancient scripts of Hinduism. In Upanishads, the concept of dharma continues as universal principle of law, order, harmony, and truth. It acts as the regulatory moral principle of the Universe. It is explained as law of righteousness and equated to ''[[satya]]'' (Sanskrit: सत्यं, truth),&lt;ref name=chjo/&gt;&lt;ref name=paulh/&gt; in hymn 1.4.14 of Brhadaranyaka Upanishad, as follows:

{{quote| 
धर्मः तस्माद्धर्मात् परं नास्त्य् अथो अबलीयान् बलीयाँसमाशँसते धर्मेण यथा राज्ञैवम् ।&lt;br&gt;
यो वै स धर्मः सत्यं वै तत् तस्मात्सत्यं वदन्तमाहुर् धर्मं वदतीति धर्मं वा वदन्तँ सत्यं वदतीत्य् एतद्ध्येवैतदुभयं भवति ।।

Nothing is higher than dharma. The weak overcomes the stronger by dharma, as over a king. Truly that dharma is the Truth (''Satya''); Therefore, when a man speaks the Truth, they say, "He speaks the Dharma"; and if he speaks Dharma, they say, "He speaks the Truth!" For both are one.|[[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]]|1.4.xiv&lt;ref name=chjo&gt;[[Charles Johnston (Theosophist)|Charles Johnston]], The Mukhya Upanishads: Books of Hidden Wisdom, Kshetra, {{ISBN|978-1495946530}}, p. 481, for discussion: pp. 478–505.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=paulh&gt;Horsch, Paul (translated by Jarrod Whitaker), "From Creation Myth to World Law: The early history of Dharma", ''Journal of Indian Philosophy'', Vol 32, pp. 423–448, (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===In the Epics===
The Hindu religion and philosophy, claims [[Daniel H. H. Ingalls, Sr.|Daniel Ingalls]],&lt;ref&gt;Daniel H. H. Ingalls, "Dharma and Moksa", ''Philosophy East and West'', Vol. 7, No. 1/2 (Apr. – Jul., 1957), pp. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; places major emphasis on individual practical morality. In the Sanskrit epics, this concern is omnipresent.

In the Second Book of [[Ramayana]], for example, a peasant asks the King to do what dharma morally requires of him, the King agrees and does so even though his compliance with the law of dharma costs him dearly. Similarly, dharma is at the centre of all major events in the life of Rama, Sita, and Lakshman in Ramayana, claims Daniel Ingalls.&lt;ref name=danielingalls&gt;Daniel H. H. Ingalls, "Dharma and Moksa", ''Philosophy East and West'', Vol. 7, No. 1/2 (April – July 1957), pp. 41–48.&lt;/ref&gt; Each episode of Ramayana presents life situations and ethical questions in symbolic terms. The issue is debated by the characters, finally the right prevails over wrong, the good over evil. For this reason, in Hindu Epics, the good, morally upright, law-abiding king is referred to as "dharmaraja".&lt;ref&gt;The Mahābhārata: Book 11: The Book of the Women; Book 12: The Book of Peace, Part 1 By Johannes Adrianus Bernardus Buitenen, James L. Fitzgerald p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Mahabharata]], the other major Indian epic, similarly, dharma is central, and it is presented with symbolism and metaphors. Near the end of the epic, the god Yama, referred to as dharma in the text, is portrayed as taking the form of a dog to test the compassion of Yudishthira, who is told he may not enter paradise with such an animal, but refuses to abandon his companion, for which decision he is then praised by dharma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m17/m17003.htm|title=The Mahabharata, Book 17: Mahaprasthanika Parva: Section 3|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The value and appeal of the Mahabharata is not as much in its complex and rushed presentation of metaphysics in the 12th book, claims Ingalls,&lt;ref name=danielingalls/&gt; because Indian metaphysics is more eloquently presented in other Sanskrit scriptures; the appeal of Mahabharata, like Ramayana, is in its presentation of a series of moral problems and life situations, to which there are usually three answers given, according to Ingalls:&lt;ref name=danielingalls/&gt; one answer is of [[Bhima]], which is the answer of brute force, an individual angle representing materialism, egoism, and self; the second answer is of [[Yudhishthira]], which is always an appeal to piety and gods, of social virtue and of tradition; the third answer is of introspective [[Arjuna]], which falls between the two extremes, and who, claims Ingalls, symbolically reveals the finest moral qualities of man. The Epics of Hinduism are a symbolic treatise about life, virtues, customs, morals, ethics, law, and other aspects of dharma.&lt;ref&gt;There is considerable amount of literature on dharma-related discussion in Hindu Epics: of Egoism versus Altruism, Individualism versus Social Virtues and Tradition; for examples, see:
* Johann Jakob Meyer (1989), Sexual life in ancient India, {{ISBN|8120806387}}, Motilal Banarsidass, pp. 92–93; Quote – "In Indian literature, especially in Mahabharata over and over again is heard the energetic cry – Each is alone. None belongs to anyone else, we are all but strangers to strangers; (...), none knows the other, the self belongs only to self. Man is born alone, alone he lives, alone he dies, alone he tastes the fruit of his deeds and his ways, it is only his work that bears him company. (...) Our body and spiritual organism is ever changing; what belongs, then, to us? (...) Thus, too, there is really no teacher or leader for anyone, each is his own Guru, and must go along the road to happiness alone. Only the self is the friend of man, only the self is the foe of man; from others nothing comes to him. Therefore what must be done is to honor, to assert one's self..."; Quote – "(in parts of the epic), the most thoroughgoing egoism and individualism is stressed..."
* Raymond F. Piper (1954), "In Support of Altruism in Hinduism", ''Journal of Bible and Religion'', Vol. 22, No. 3 (Jul., 1954), pp. 178–183
* J Ganeri (2010), A Return to the Self: Indians and Greeks on Life as Art and Philosophical Therapy, Royal Institute of Philosophy supplement, 85(66), pp. 119–135.&lt;/ref&gt; There is extensive discussion of dharma at the individual level in the Epics of Hinduism, observes [[Daniel H. H. Ingalls, Sr.|Ingalls]]; for example, on free will versus destiny, when and why human beings believe in either, ultimately concluding that the strong and prosperous naturally uphold free will, while those facing grief or frustration naturally lean towards destiny.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel H. H. Ingalls, "Dharma and Moksa", ''Philosophy East and West'', Vol. 7, No. 1/2 (Apr. – Jul., 1957), pp. 44–45; Quote – "(...)In the Epic, free will has the upper hand. Only when a man's effort is frustrated or when he is overcome with grief does he become a predestinarian (believer in destiny)."; Quote – "This association of success with the doctrine of free will or human effort (purusakara) was felt so clearly that among the ways of bringing about a king's downfall is given the following simple advice: 'Belittle free will to him, and emphasise destiny.{{'"}} (Mahabharata 12.106.20).&lt;/ref&gt; The Epics of Hinduism illustrate various aspects of dharma, they are a means of communicating dharma with metaphors.&lt;ref&gt;[[Huston Smith]], The World Religions, {{ISBN|978-0061660184}}, HarperOne (2009); For summary notes: [http://staff.gps.edu/montgomery/World%20Religions/Faiths/hinduism/Background%20to%20Hindu%20Literature.htm Background to Hindu Literature] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040922160422/http://staff.gps.edu/montgomery/World%20Religions/Faiths/hinduism/Background%20to%20Hindu%20Literature.htm |date=2004-09-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===According to 4th century Vatsyayana===
According to [[Klaus Klostermaier]], 4th century Hindu scholar [[Vātsyāyana]] explained dharma by contrasting it with adharma.&lt;ref name=klausk&gt;Klaus Klostermaier, A survey of Hinduism, SUNY Press, {{ISBN|0-88706-807-3}}, Chapter 3: "Hindu dharma".&lt;/ref&gt; Vātsyāyana suggested that dharma is not merely in one's actions, but also in words one speaks or writes, and in thought. According to Vātsyāyana:&lt;ref name=klausk/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jha, Nyayasutras with Vatsyayana Bhasya, 2 vols, Oriental Books (1939).&lt;/ref&gt;

# Adharma of body: hinsa (violence), steya (steal, theft), pratisiddha maithuna (sexual indulgence with someone other than one's partner)
# Dharma of body: dana (charity), paritrana (succor of the distressed) and paricarana (rendering service to others)
# Adharma from words one speaks or writes: mithya (falsehood), parusa (caustic talk), sucana (calumny) and asambaddha (absurd talk)
# Dharma from words one speaks or writes: satya (truth and facts), hitavacana (talking with good intention), priyavacana (gentle, kind talk), svadhyaya (self study)
# Adharma of mind: paradroha (ill will to anyone), paradravyabhipsa (covetousness), nastikya (denial of the existence of morals and religiosity)
# Dharma of mind: daya (compassion), asprha (disinterestedness), and sraddha (faith in others)

===According to Patanjali Yoga===
In the Yoga system the dharma is real; in the Vedanta it is unreal.&lt;ref name="The yoga-system of Patanjali"&gt;[https://archive.org/details/yogasystemofpata00wooduoft The yoga-system of Patanjali] The ancient Hindu doctrine of concentration of mind, embracing the mnemonic rules, called Yoga-sutras, James Haughton Woods (1914), Harvard University Press&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Dharma is part of [[yoga]], suggests Patanjali; the elements of Hindu dharma are the attributes, qualities and aspects of yoga.&lt;ref name="The yoga-system of Patanjali"/&gt; Patanjali explained dharma in two categories: ''yama'' (restraints) and ''niyama'' (observances).&lt;ref name=klausk/&gt;

The five yama, according to Patanjali, are: abstain from injury to all living creatures ([[ahimsa]]), abstain from falsehood (satya), abstain from unauthorised appropriation of things-of-value from another (acastrapurvaka), abstain from coveting or sexually cheating on your partner, and abstain from expecting or accepting gifts from others.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/yogasystemofpata00wooduoft The yoga-system of Patanjali] Yoga-sutras, James Haughton Woods (1914), Harvard University Press, pp. 178–180.&lt;/ref&gt; The five yama apply in action, speech and mind. In explaining yama, Patanjali clarifies that certain professions and situations may require qualification in conduct. For example, a fisherman must injure a fish, but he must attempt to do this with least trauma to fish and the fisherman must try to injure no other creature as he fishes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/yogasystemofpata00wooduoft The yoga-system of Patanjali] Yoga-sutras, James Haughton Woods (1914), Harvard University Press, pp. 180–181.&lt;/ref&gt;

The five niyama (observances) are cleanliness by eating pure food and removing impure thoughts (such as arrogance or jealousy or pride), contentment in one's means, meditation and silent reflection regardless of circumstances one faces, study and pursuit of historic knowledge, and devotion of all actions to the Supreme Teacher to achieve perfection of concentration.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/yogasystemofpata00wooduoft The yoga-system of Patanjali] Yoga-sutras, James Haughton Woods (1914), Harvard University Press, pp. 181–191.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sources===
Dharma is an empirical and experiential inquiry for every man and woman, according to some texts of Hinduism.&lt;ref name=paulhacker/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kumarila, Tantravarttika, Anandasramasamskrtagranthavalih, Vol. 97, pp. 204–205; For an English Translation, see Jha (1924), Bibliotheca Indica, Vol. 161, Vol. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Apastamba|Apastamba Dharmasutra]] states:

{{quote| ''Dharma'' and ''Adharma'' do not go around saying, "That is us." Neither do gods, nor gandharvas, nor ancestors declare what is ''Dharma'' and what is ''Adharma''.| ''Apastamba Dharmasutra''&lt;ref&gt;[[Patrick Olivelle|Olivelle, Patrick]]. ''Dharmasūtras: The Law Codes of Ancient India''. Oxford World Classics, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In other texts, three sources and means to discover dharma in Hinduism are described. These, according to [[:de:Paul Hacker|Paul Hacker]], are:&lt;ref name=ph79/&gt; First, learning historical knowledge such as Vedas, Upanishads, the Epics and other Sanskrit literature with the help of one's teacher. Second, observing the behavior and example of good people. The third source applies when neither one's education nor example exemplary conduct is known. In this case, "[[atmatusti]]" is the source of dharma in Hinduism, that is the good person reflects and follows what satisfies his heart, his own inner feeling, what he feels driven to.&lt;ref name=ph79&gt;Paul Hacker (1965), "Dharma in Hinduism", ''Journal of Indian Philosophy'', Volume 34, Issue 5, pp. 487–489 (English translated version by Donald R. Davis (2006)).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dharma, life stages and social stratification===
{{main article|Ashrama (stage)|Puruṣārtha|l1=Āśrama}}
Some texts of Hinduism outline ''dharma'' for society and at the individual level. Of these, the most cited one is ''[[Manusmriti]]'', which describes the four ''Varnas'', their rights and duties.&lt;ref name=alfh&gt;[[Alf Hiltebeitel]] (2011), ''Dharma: Its Early History in Law, Religion, and Narrative'', {{ISBN|978-0195394238}}, Oxford University Press, pp. 215–227.&lt;/ref&gt; Most texts of Hinduism, however, discuss ''dharma'' with no mention of ''Varna'' ([[Caste system in India|caste]]).&lt;ref&gt;Thapar, R. (1995), The first millennium BC in northern India, Recent perspectives of early Indian history, 80–141.&lt;/ref&gt; Other dharma texts and Smritis differ from Manusmriti on the nature and structure of Varnas.&lt;ref name=alfh/&gt; Yet, other texts question the very existence of varna. [[Bhrigu]], in the Epics, for example, presents the theory that dharma does not require any varnas.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas R. Trautmann (1964), "On the Translation of the Term Varna", ''Journal of the Economic and Social History of the Orient'', Vol. 7, No. 2 (Jul., 1964), pp. 196–201.&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, medieval India is widely believed to be a socially stratified society, with each social strata inheriting a profession and being endogamous. Varna was not absolute in Hindu dharma; individuals had the right to renounce and leave their Varna, as well as their [[Ashrama (stage)|asramas]] of life, in search of moksa.&lt;ref name=alfh/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;see:
* Van Buitenen, J. A. B. (1957). "Dharma and Moksa". ''Philosophy East and West'', Volume 7, Number 1/2 (April – July 1957), pp. 38–39
* Koller, J. M. (1972), "Dharma: an expression of universal order", ''Philosophy East and West'', 22(2), pp. 131–144.&lt;/ref&gt; While neither Manusmriti nor succeeding Smritis of Hinduism ever use the word varnadharma (that is, the dharma of varnas), or varnasramadharma (that is, the dharma of varnas and asramas), the scholarly commentary on Manusmriti use these words, and thus associate dharma with varna system of India.&lt;ref name=alfh/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kane, P.V. (1962), History of Dharmasastra (Ancient and Medieval Religious and Civil Law in India), Volume 1, pp. 2–10.&lt;/ref&gt; In 6th century India, even Buddhist kings called themselves "protectors of varnasramadharma" – that is, dharma of varna and asramas of life.&lt;ref name=alfh/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Olivelle, P. (1993). ''The Asrama System: The history and hermeneutics of a religious institution'', New York: [[Oxford University Press]].&lt;/ref&gt;

At the individual level, some texts of Hinduism outline [[Ashrama (stage)|four āśrama]]s, or stages of life as individual's dharma. These are:&lt;ref&gt;Alban G. Widgery, "The Principles of Hindu Ethics", ''International Journal of Ethics'', Vol. 40, No. 2 (Jan., 1930), pp. 232–245.&lt;/ref&gt; (1) [[Brahmacharya|brahmacārya]], the life of preparation as a student, (2) [[Grihastha|gṛhastha]], the life of the householder with family and other social roles, (3) [[Vanaprastha|vānprastha]] or aranyaka, the life of the forest-dweller, transitioning from worldly occupations to reflection and renunciation, and (4) [[sannyāsa]], the life of giving away all property, becoming a recluse and devotion to moksa, spiritual matters.

The four stages of life complete the four human strivings in life, according to Hinduism.&lt;ref name=jkkpwg/&gt; Dharma enables the individual to satisfy the striving for stability and order, a life that is lawful and harmonious, the striving to do the right thing, be good, be virtuous, earn religious merit, be helpful to others, interact successfully with society. The other three strivings are [[Artha]] – the striving for means of life such as food, shelter, power, security, material wealth, etc.; [[Kama]] – the striving for sex, desire, pleasure, love, emotional fulfillment, etc.; and [[Moksa]] – the striving for spiritual meaning, liberation from life-rebirth cycle, self-realisation in this life, etc. The four stages are neither independent nor exclusionary in Hindu dharma.&lt;ref name=jkkpwg&gt;see:
* Koller, J. M. (1972), "Dharma: an expression of universal order", ''Philosophy East and West'', 22(2), pp. 131–144.
* Karl H. Potter (1958), "Dharma and Mokṣa from a Conversational Point of View", ''Philosophy East and West'', Vol. 8, No. 1/2 (April – July 1958), pp. 49–63.
* William F. Goodwin, "Ethics and Value in Indian Philosophy", ''Philosophy East and West'', Vol. 4, No. 4 (Jan. 1955), pp. 321–344.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dharma and poverty===
Dharma while being necessary for individual and society, is dependent on poverty and prosperity in a society, according to Hindu dharma scriptures. For example, according to Adam Bowles,&lt;ref name=adambowles&gt;Adam Bowles (2007), Dharma, Disorder, and the Political in Ancient India, Brill's Indological Library (Book 28), {{ISBN|978-9004158153}}, Chapter 3.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shatapatha Brahmana]] 11.1.6.24 links social prosperity and ''dharma'' through water. Waters come from rains, it claims; when rains are abundant there is prosperity on the earth, and this prosperity enables people to follow Dharma – moral and lawful life. In times of distress, of drought, of poverty, everything suffers including relations between human beings and the human ability to live according to dharma.&lt;ref name=adambowles/&gt;

In Rajadharmaparvan 91.34-8, the relationship between poverty and dharma reaches a full circle. A land with less moral and lawful life suffers distress, and as distress rises it causes more immoral and unlawful life, which further increases distress.&lt;ref name=adambowles/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Derrett, J. D. M. (1959), "Bhu-bharana, bhu-palana, bhu-bhojana: an Indian conundrum", Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies, 22, pp. 108–123.&lt;/ref&gt; Those in power must follow the raja dharma (that is, dharma of rulers), because this enables the society and the individual to follow dharma and achieve prosperity.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jan Gonda]], "Ancient Indian Kingship from the Religious Point of View", ''Numen'', Vol. 3, Issue 1 (Jan., 1956), pp. 36–71.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dharma and law===
{{main article|Hindu law}}
The notion of ''dharma'' as duty or propriety is found in India's ancient legal and religious texts. In Hindu philosophy, justice, social harmony, and happiness requires that people live per dharma. The [[Dharmashastra]] is a record of these guidelines and rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gächter|first=Othmar|title=Anthropos|journal=Anthropos institute|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; The available evidence suggest India once had a large collection of dharma related literature (sutras, shastras); four of the sutras survive and these are now referred to as Dharmasutras.&lt;ref name=polivelle/&gt; Along with laws of Manu in Dharmasutras, exist parallel and different compendium of laws, such as the laws of Narada and other ancient scholars.&lt;ref&gt;Donald Davis, Jr., "A Realist View of Hindu Law", ''Ratio Juris''. Vol. 19 No. 3 September 2006, pp. 287–313.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lariviere, Richard W. (2003), The Naradasmrti, Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass&lt;/ref&gt; These different and conflicting law books are neither exclusive, nor do they supersede other sources of dharma in Hinduism. These Dharmasutras include instructions on education of the young, their rites of passage, customs, religious rites and rituals, marital rights and obligations, death and ancestral rites, laws and administration of justice, crimes, punishments, rules and types of evidence, duties of a king, as well as morality.&lt;ref name=polivelle&gt;Patrick Olivelle (1999), ''The Dharmasutras: The law codes of ancient India'', Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0-19-283882-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Buddhism==
{{anchor|Buddhism}}
{{Buddhism}}
In Buddhism ''dharma'' means cosmic law and order,&lt;ref name="ODWR-Dharma" /&gt; but is also applied to the teachings of the Buddha.&lt;ref name="ODWR-Dharma" /&gt; In [[Buddhist philosophy]], ''dhamma/dharma'' is also the term for "[[phenomena]]".&lt;ref name="david"/&gt; In East Asia, the translation for dharma is [[wiktionary:法|法]], pronounced ''fǎ'' in Mandarin, ''choe ཆོས་'' in Tibetan, ''beop'' in Korean, ''hō'' in Japanese, and ''pháp'' in Vietnamese. However, the term dharma can also be transliterated from its original form.  

===Buddha's teachings===
&lt;!--"Sacca-kiriya" links here. Please adjust link there if this section is removed or renamed. Thanks.--&gt;
For practicing Buddhists, references to "dharma" (''dhamma'' in Pali) particularly as "the Dharma", generally means the teachings of the Buddha, commonly known throughout the East as Buddha-Dharma. It includes especially the discourses on the fundamental principles (such as the [[Four Noble Truths]] and the [[Noble Eightfold Path]]), as opposed to the parables and to the poems.

The status of Dharma is regarded variably by different Buddhist traditions. Some regard it as an ultimate truth, or as the fount of all things which lie beyond the "[[three realms]]" (Sanskrit: ''tridhatu'') and the "wheel of becoming" (Sanskrit: ''[[bhavachakra]]''), somewhat like the pagan Greek and Christian [[logos]]: this is known as ''[[Dharmakaya]]'' (Sanskrit). Others, who regard the Buddha as simply an enlightened human being, see the Dharma as the [[essence]] of the "84,000 different aspects of the teaching" (Tibetan: ''chos-sgo brgyad-khri bzhi strong'') that the Buddha gave to various types of people, based upon their individual propensities and capabilities.

Dharma refers not only to the sayings of the Buddha, but also to the later traditions of interpretation and addition that the various [[schools of Buddhism]] have developed to help explain and to expand upon the Buddha's teachings. For others still, they see the Dharma as referring to the "truth", or the ultimate reality of "the way that things really are" (Tib. Cho).

The Dharma is one of the [[Three Jewels]] of Buddhism in which practitioners of Buddhism seek refuge, or that upon which one relies for his or her lasting happiness. The Three Jewels of Buddhism are the [[Buddhahood|Buddha]], meaning the mind's perfection of enlightenment, the [[Dharma (Buddhism)|Dharma]], meaning the teachings and the methods of the Buddha, and the [[Sangha (Buddhism)|Sangha]], meaning the monastic community who provide guidance and support to followers of the Buddha.

===Chan Buddhism===
Dharma is employed in [[Ch'an]] in a specific context in relation to transmission of authentic doctrine, understanding and bodhi; recognised in [[Dharma transmission]].

==Jainism==
{{Main article|Dharma (Jainism)}}
[[File:Jain Prateek Chihna.svg|thumb|140px|Jainism]]

The word Dharma in Jainism is found in all its key texts. It has a contextual meaning and refers to a number of ideas. In the broadest sense, it means the teachings of the Jinas,&lt;ref name="ODWR-Dharma" /&gt; or teachings of any competing spiritual school,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=John E. |last=Cort|title=Jains in the World: Religious Values and Ideology in India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PZk-4HOMzsoC&amp;pg=PA192 |year=2001|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-803037-9|page=100}}&lt;/ref&gt; a supreme path,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Peter B.

The term ''dharma'' also has a specific [[ontology|ontological]] and soteriological meaning in Jainism, as a part of its theory of six [[dravya (Jainism)|dravya]] (substance or a reality). In the Jain tradition, existence consists of ''jiva'' (soul, atman) and ''ajiva'' (non-soul), the latter consisting of five categories: inert non-sentient atomic matter (pudgala), space (akasha), time (kala), principle of motion (dharma), and principle of rest (adharma).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=John E. |last=Cort|title=Open Boundaries: Jain Communities and Cultures in Indian History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WWfnXbVWjKcC |year=1998|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=978-0-7914-3786-5|pages=10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dundas2003p93"&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Dundas|authorlink=Paul Dundas|title=The Jains|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X8iAAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA93 |year=2003|edition=2|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0415266055|pages=93–95}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of the term ''dharma'' to mean motion and to refer to an ontological sub-category is peculiar to Jainism, and not found in the metaphysics of Buddhism and various schools of Hinduism.&lt;ref name="Dundas2003p93"/&gt;

The major [[Jain text]], ''Tattvartha Sutra'' mentions ''Das-dharma'' with the meaning of "ten righteous virtues". These are forbearance, modesty, straightforwardness, purity, truthfulness, self-restraint, austerity, renunciation, non-attachment, and celibacy.{{sfn|Jain|2011|p=128}} Acārya Amṛtacandra, author of the Jain text, ''Puruṣārthasiddhyupāya'' writes:{{sfn|Jain|2012|p=22}}

In statistics, a '''dual-flashlight plot''' is a type of scatter-plot in which the standardized mean ([[SMCV]]) is plotted against the mean of a [[contrast variable]] representing a comparison of interest
.&lt;ref name=ZhangPharmacogenomics2010&gt;{{cite journal |author=Zhang XHD

|year=2010 |month= |pmid= 20136359|doi=10.2217/PGS.09.136 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The commonly used dual-flashlight plot is for the difference between two groups in high-throughput experiments such as [[microarray]]s and [[high-throughput screening]] studies, in which we plot the [[SSMD]] versus average log fold-change on the ''y''- and ''x''-axes, respectively, for all genes or compounds (such as [[siRNA]]s or [[small molecule]]s) investigated in an experiment.&lt;ref name="ZhangPharmacogenomics2010"/&gt;  
As a whole, the points in a dual-flashlight plot look like the beams of a flashlight with two heads, hence the name dual-flashlight plot.&lt;ref name="ZhangPharmacogenomics2010"/&gt;

With the dual-flashlight plot, we can see how the genes or compounds are distributed into each category in effect sizes, as shown in the figure. Meanwhile, we can also see the average fold-change for each gene or compound. The dual-flashlight plot is similar to the [[volcano plot (statistics)|volcano plot]]. In a [[volcano plot (statistics)|volcano plot]], the [[p-value]] (or q-value{{clarify|date=June 2012}}), instead of SMCV or SSMD, is plotted against average fold-change &lt;ref name=Jin2001&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jin W, Riley RM, Wolfinger RD, White KP, Passador-Gurgel G, Gibson G |title= The contributions of sex, genotype and age to transcriptional variance in Drosophila melanogaster

The dual-flashlight plot bears the same advantage that the SMCV has, as compared to the [[volcano plot (statistics)|volcano plot]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15023">[[Animal echolocation|Echolocation]] (or sonar) systems of animals, like human [[Radar jamming and deception|radar systems]], are susceptible to interference known as '''echolocation jamming''' or sonar jamming. Jamming occurs when non-target sounds interfere with target echoes. Jamming can be purposeful or inadvertent, and can be caused by the echolocation system itself, other echolocating animals, prey, or humans. Echolocating animals have evolved to minimize jamming, however, echolocation avoidance behaviors are not always successful.

== Self jamming ==

Echolocating animals can jam themselves in a number of ways. Bats, for example, produce some of the loudest sounds in nature,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Surlykke|first=A|author2=Kalko, EK|title=Echolocating bats cry out loud to detect their prey.|journal=PLoS ONE|year=2008|volume=3|issue=4|pages=e2036|pmid=18446226|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0002036|pmc=2323577}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then they immediately listen for echoes that are hundreds of times fainter than the sounds they emit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kick|first=S. A.|author2=J. A. Simmons|title=Automatic gain control in the bat's sonar receiver and the neuroethology of echolocation|journal=Journal of Neuroscience|year=1984|volume=4|pages=2725–37|pmid=6502201|issue=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; To avoid deafening themselves, whenever a bat makes an echolocation emission, a small muscle in the bat's middle ear (the [[stapedius]] muscle) clamps down on small bones called [[ossicles]], which normally amplify sounds between the [[ear drum]] and the [[cochlea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Henson OW|first=Jr|title=The activity and function of the middle-ear muscles in echo-locating bats.|journal=The Journal of Physiology|year=1965|volume=180|issue=4|pages=871–887|pmid=5880367|doi=10.1113/jphysiol.1965.sp007737|pmc=1357428}}&lt;/ref&gt; This dampens the intensity of the sounds that the bat hears during this time, preserving hearing sensitivity to target echoes.

Jamming can occur if an animal is still producing a sound when an echo returns, for example, from a nearby object. Bats avoid this type of jamming by producing short sounds of 3-50 ms when searching for prey or navigating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Griffin|first=Donald R.|author2=Webster, Frederic A. |author3=Michael, Charles R. |title=The echolocation of flying insects by bats|journal=Animal Behaviour|year=1960|volume=8|issue=3–4|pages=141–154|doi=10.1016/0003-3472(60)90022-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bats produce progressively shorter sounds, down to 0.5 ms, to avoid self-jamming when echolocating targets that they are approaching.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last1=Thomas|editor-first1=Jeanette A.|editor-last2=Moss|editor-first2=Cynthia F.|editor-last3=Vater|editor-first3=Marianne|title=Echolocation in bats and dolphins|year=2004|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=0226795985|pages=22–26}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is because echoes from nearby targets will return to the bat sooner than sounds from distant targets.

Another form of jamming occurs when an echolocating animal produces many sounds in succession and assigns an echo to the wrong emission. To avoid this type of jamming, bats typically wait enough time for echoes to return from all possible targets before making the next sound. This can be seen clearly when a bat attacks an insect. The bat produces sounds with progressively shorter time intervals, but always allowing enough time for sounds to travel to the target and back.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Elemens|first=Coen P. H.|author2=A. F. Mead |author3=L. Jakobsen |author4=J. M. Ratcliffe |title=Superfast Muscles Set Maximum Call Rate in Echolocating Bats|journal=Science|year=2011|volume=333|pages=1885–1888|pmid=21960635|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/333/6051/1885.short|doi=10.1126/science.1207309|issue=6051}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another way bats overcome this problem is by producing successive sounds with unique time-frequency structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hiryu|first=S.|author2=Bates, M. E. |author3=Simmons, J. A. |author4= Riquimaroux, H. |title=FM echolocating bats shift frequencies to avoid broadcast-echo ambiguity in clutter|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|year=2010|volume=107|issue=15|pages=7048–7053|doi=10.1073/pnas.1000429107 |pmid=20351291 |pmc=2872447}}&lt;/ref&gt; This allows bats to process echoes from multiple emissions at the same time, and to correctly assign an echo to its emission using its time-frequency signature.

== Jamming by other echolocation systems ==

Like [[electric fish]], echolocating animals are susceptible to jamming from other animals of the same species emitting signals in the nearby environment.&lt;ref name = "Ulanovsky"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ulanovsky|first=N.|author2=Fenton, M. B. |author3=Tsoar, A. |author4= Korine, C. |title=Dynamics of jamming avoidance in echolocating bats|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|year=2004|volume=271|issue=1547|pages=1467–1475|doi=10.1098/rspb.2004.2750 |pmid=15306318 |pmc=1691745}}&lt;/ref&gt; To avoid such jamming, bats use a strategy also employed by electric fish to avoid this jamming: a behavior known as [[jamming avoidance response]] (JAR).&lt;ref name = "Ulanovsky"/&gt; In a JAR, one or both animals change the frequency of their sounds away from that used by the other animal.&lt;ref name = "Ulanovsky" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gillam"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gillam|first=E. H|author2=Ulanovsky, N. |author3=McCracken, G. F |title=Rapid jamming avoidance in biosonar|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|year=2007|volume=274|issue=1610|pages=651–660|doi=10.1098/rspb.2006.0047|pmid=17254989|pmc=2197216}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has the effect of allowing each animal a unique frequency bandwidth where jamming will not occur. Bats can make this adjustment very rapidly, often in less than 0.2 seconds.&lt;ref name="Gillam" /&gt;

[[Big brown bat]]s can avoid jamming by going silent for periods of time when following another echolocating big brown bat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chiu|first=C.|author2=Xian, W. |author3=Moss, C. F. |title=Flying in silence: Echolocating bats cease vocalizing to avoid sonar jamming|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|year=2008|volume=105|issue=35|pages=13116–13121|doi=10.1073/pnas.0804408105|pmid=18725624|pmc=2529029}}&lt;/ref&gt; This sometimes allows the silent bat to capture a prey in competitive foraging situations.

== Jamming by prey ==

[[File:Bertholdiatrigona.jpg|thumbnail|right|The moth ''Bertholdia trigona'' is the only animal in nature known to jam the echolocation of its predator]]

=== History ===

The possibility that moths jam bat echolocation arose with an experiment report published in 1965 by Dorothy Dunning and Kenneth Roeder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dunning|first=D. C.|author2=Roeder, K. D.|title=Moth Sounds and the Insect-Catching Behavior of Bats|journal=Science|year=1965|volume=147|issue=3654|pages=173–174|doi=10.1126/science.147.3654.173|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/147/3654/173.short}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moth clicks were played through a loudspeaker as bats tried to capture mealworms catapulted through the air. Moth clicks caused bats to veer away from the mealworms, but echolocation calls played through the speaker did not, causing the authors to conclude that the moth clicks themselves dissuaded the bats. However, it was later determined that the moth clicks were played at an unnaturally loud level, invalidating this conclusion.&lt;ref name = "Dunning"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dunning|first=Dorothy C.|title=Warning Sounds of moths|journal=Zeitschrift für Tierpsychologie|year=1968|volume=25|pages=125–138|doi=10.1111/j.1439-0310.1968.tb00008|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1439-0310.1968.tb00008.x/abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In subsequent years Dunning conducted further experiments to show that moth clicks serve a warning function.&lt;ref name = "Dunning" /&gt; That is, they communicate to bats that the moths are toxic, as many moths accumulate toxic chemicals from their host plants as caterpillars and keep them in their tissues through adulthood. Roeder agreed with Dunning’s findings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Roeder|first=Kenneth D.|title=Nerve cells and insect behavior|year=1967|publisher=Harvard Univ. Press|location=Cambridge, Mass [u.a.]|isbn=0674608011|url=https://www.amazon.com/Nerve-Cells-Insect-Behavior-Revised/dp/0674608011|edition=Rev. ed., 1. Harvard Univ. Press paperback}}&lt;/ref&gt;

James Fullard and colleagues published findings in 1979,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fullard|first=James H.|author2=Fenton, M. Brock |author3=Simmons, James A. |title=Jamming bat echolocation: the clicks of arctiid moths|journal=Canadian Journal of Zoology|year=1979|volume=57|issue=3|pages=647–649|doi=10.1139/z79-076}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and 1994&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fullard|first=JH|author2=Simmons, JA |author3=Saillant, PA |title=Jamming bat echolocation: the dogbane tiger moth Cycnia tenera times its clicks to the terminal attack calls of the big brown bat Eptesicus fuscus.|journal=The Journal of Experimental Biology|year=1994|volume=194|pages=285–98|pmid=7964403|url=http://jeb.biologists.org/content/194/1/285.short|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; arguing in favor of the jamming hypothesis based on the acoustic characteristics of moth clicks, however this hypothesis was still widely debated in the literature during that time.&lt;ref name = "Hristov" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Surlykke|first=Annemarie|author2=Miller, Lee A.|title=The influence of arctiid moth clicks on bat echolocation; jamming or warning?|journal=Journal of Comparative Physiology A|year=1985|volume=156|issue=6|pages=831–843|doi=10.1007/BF00610835}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ratcliffe|first=J.

The researchers concluded that most tiger moths do not produce enough sound to jam bat sonar.

The first study to conclusively demonstrate that moths jam bats was published in 2009 by researchers at Wake Forest University.&lt;ref name = "Corcoran" /&gt; In this study big brown bats were raised in captivity to ensure they had no prior experience with clicking prey and trained to attack moths tethered to a thin line attached to the ceiling in an indoor flight room. Over a nine-night experiment the bats attacked non-clicking control moths and clicking ''Bertholdia trigona'' – moths that were selected for their extraordinary clicking abilities. Bats had substantial difficulty catching the clicking moths compared to silent controls, and ate the ''B. trigona'' moths when they had the opportunity, thus refuting the hypothesis that the clicks were warning the bats of moths’ toxicity. Moth clicks also disrupted the stereotypical pattern of the bats echolocation, confirming the clicks’ jamming function.

== Humans jamming animals ==

Humans may jam echolocating animals deliberately or accidentally. Recent efforts have been made to develop acoustic jamming deterrents to exclude bats from buildings or bridges, or to keep bats away from wind turbines where large numbers of mortalities occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Szewczak|first=J. M.|author2=E.

However, scaling up acoustic deterrents to large volumes for applications such as keeping bats away from wind turbines is difficult because of the high atmospheric attenuation of [[ultrasound]].

{{Ayyavazhi}}

'''Ekam''' ([[Tamil language|Tamil]]: ஏகம், "the supreme oneness") is the term used in [[Akilathirattu Ammanai]], the holy book of the religion of [[Ayyavazhi]],&lt;ref&gt; ''Akilattirattu Ammanai'' published by T. Palaramachandran Nadar, 9th impression, 1989 Page 225-227 &lt;/ref&gt; to represent [[The Ultimate (philosophy)|The Ultimate]] [[Henosis|Oneness]]. In [[Thiruvasakam]]-2 it was stated that it was from this ''Ekam'' that all objects, including the separate [[Three godheads (Ayyavazhi)|Godheads]], [[Deva (Hinduism)|Devas]] and [[asuras]], of the [[universe]] formed. As per [[Akilam]], this state of ''ekam'' is beyond the consciousness and derived to beyond the state of changing and is the extreme state in which the whole universe exists. 
[[File:Ekam evolution.jpg|thumb|left|Evolution of [[Ekam]], the source of whole [[existence]] as described in Akilam]]
In [[Saivism]], ''Ekam'' is used commonly to refer to the oneness of [[God]], but in Ayyavazhi the basic oneness is separately symbolized to be supreme and ultimate beyond all God-heads and powers. 

The ''Ekam'' is said to be the supreme as well as the ultimate self from which the whole cosmos formed. This formless attribute is said to be defined from the human point of view. But this formless ''Ekam'', without losing its constant and formless nature, is present inside all things in the universe. That is, it remains as [[Infinity|infinite]] within every finite, formless within every definite form. It is the supreme absolute self in which all the substances of cosmos shares their existence.

The derivations of ''Ekam'' in Ayyavazhi scriptures are sometime close to the [[Pantheism|pantheistic]] form of theology. In the mythology of Ayyavazhi God-heads such as [[Shiva|Siva]], [[Vishnu]] are said to be the godheads who have power to rule this Ekam, varying from time to time, Siva until [[Kaliyuga]] and Vishnu from the starting of Kaliyuga. There are separate quotes in [[Akilam]] for focusing Siva as well as Vishnu as capable for position. But, still the ''Ekam'' is addressed beyond these god-heads.

But when [[Vaikundar]], is jailed in [[Singarathoppe]], he says "I am the one who created the Ekam and the one who is omnipresent everywhere". By this, the theology reveals Vaikundar (God) as beyond the attributes of Ekam, which moves the theology of Ayyavazhi more towards [[pantheism]].

==Other understandings==
''Ekam'' is [[Sanskrit]] for "one, single, solitary" (neuter gender), as a noun meaning "[[Henosis|unity]]". In spirituality, it refers to [[monism]] akin to that of [[Brahman]] in [[Advaita]] philosophy and [[Smarta]] theology.

The '''Evolutionary Principle''' is a largely psychological doctrine which roughly states that when a [[species]] is removed from the [[Habitat (ecology)|habitat]] in which it [[evolution|evolved]], or that habitat changes significantly within a brief period (evolutionarily speaking), the species will develop maladaptive or outright [[wiktionary:pathological|pathological]] behavior. The Evolutionary Principle is important in [[Neo-Tribalism|neo-tribalist]] and [[anarcho-primitivist]] thinking.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25785">[[File:Lorenz emotions.png|right|thumb|250px|A drawing by [[Konrad Lorenz]] showing facial expressions of a dog]]
The '''grimace scale''' ('''GS'''), sometimes called the '''grimace score''', is a method of assessing the occurrence or severity of [[Pain in animals|pain]] experienced by non-human animals according to [[Objectivity (science)|objective]] and [[Blind experiment|blinded]] scoring of facial expressions, as is done routinely for the measurement of pain in non-verbal humans.  Observers score the presence or prominence of “facial action units" (FAU), e.g. Orbital Tightening, Nose Bulge, Ear Position and Whisker Change.  These are scored by observing the animal directly in real-time, or post hoc from photographs or [[Frame grabber|screen-grabs]] from videos.  The facial expression of the animals is sometimes referred to as the '''pain face'''.

The GS method of pain assessment is highly applicable to [[laboratory rodent]]s as these are usually prey species which tend to inhibit the expression of pain to prevent appearing vulnerable to predators. For this reason, behavioural changes in these species are mainly observed with acute pain (hours) but are less pronounced in longer-lasting pain (days).&lt;ref name="Faller" /&gt;

For mice at least, the GS has been shown to be a highly accurate, repeatable and reliable means of assessing pain requiring only a short period of training for the observer.&lt;ref name="Miller2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Whittaker" /&gt;  Across species, GS are proven to have high accuracy and reliability, and are considered useful for indicating both procedural and postoperative pain, and for assessing the efficacy of analgesics.&lt;ref name="Chambers"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Chambers, C.T.  |author2=Mogil, J.S.|year=2015|title=Ontogeny and phylogeny of facial expression of pain|journal=Pain|volume=156|issue=5|pages=798–799|url= http://download.lww.com/wolterskluwer_vitalstream_com/PermaLink/PAIN/A/PAIN_2015_03_26_CHAMBERS_PAIN-D-14-13333_SDC1.pdf|doi=10.1097/j.pain.0000000000000133}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rysewyk"&gt;{{cite journal|author= van Rysewyk, S.|year=2016|title=Nonverbal indicators of pain|journal=Animal Sentience: An Interdisciplinary Journal on Animal Feeling|volume=1|issue=3|pages=30|url= http://animalstudiesrepository.org/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1061&amp;context=animsent}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The overall accuracy of GS is reported as 97% for mice, 84% for rabbits, 82% for rats and 73.3% for horses.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

==History==
Facial expressions have long been considered as indicators of emotion in both human and non-human animals.  The biologist, [[Charles Darwin]], considered that non-human animals exhibit similar facial expressions to emotional states as do humans.  The assessment of changes in human anatomy during facial expressions were successfully translated from humans to non-human primates, such as the chimpanzee (ChimpFACS [http://www.chimpfacs.com/])&lt;ref name="Parr2007"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Parr, L.A., Waller, B.M., Vick, S.J. and Bard, K.A.|year=2007|title=Classifying chimpanzee facial expressions using muscle action|journal=Emotion|volume=7|issue=1|pages=172–181|doi=10.1037/1528-3542.7.1.172|pmid=17352572|pmc=2826116}}&lt;/ref&gt; and rhesus macaque (MaqFACS [http://lisaaparr.com/maqfacs.html]),&lt;ref name="Parr2010"&gt;{{cite journal|author= Parr, L.A., Waller, B.M., Burrows, A.M., Gothard, K.M. and Vick, S.J.|year=2010|title=Brief communication: MaqFACS: A muscle‐based facial movement coding system for the rhesus macaque|journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology|volume=143|issue=4|pages=625–630|doi=10.1002/ajpa.21401|pmid=20872742|pmc=2988871}}&lt;/ref&gt; but were not originally applied to assess pain in these species.  In 2010, a team of researchers successfully developed&lt;ref name="Langford2010"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Nature Methods|year=2010|volume=7|issue=6|pages=447–449|doi=10.1038/nmeth.1455|title=coding of facial expressions of pain in the laboratory mouse|author=Langford, D.J., Bailey, A.L., Chanda, M.L., Clarke, S.E., Drummond, T.E., Echols, S., Glick, S., Ingrao, J., Klassen-Ross, T., Lacroix-Fralish, M.L., Matsumiya, L., Sorge, R.E., Sotocinal, S.G., Tabaka, J.M., Wong, D., van den Maagdenberg, A.M., Ferrari, M.D., Craig, K.D. and Mogil, J.S.|pmid=20453868}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first method to assess pain using changes in facial expression in any non-human animal species.  Broadly speaking, GS quantify spontaneous pain according to objective and blinded scoring of facial expressions, as is done routinely for the measurement of pain in non-verbal humans.  Observers score the presence and extent of "facial action units" (FAU), e.g. Orbital Tightening, Nose Bulge, Ear Position and Whisker Change.  These are scored in real-time by observing the animal directly, or, [[:wikt:post hoc|post hoc]] from photographs or screen-grabs from videos.

This method of pain assessment is highly applicable to prey animals which tend to inhibit the overt expression of pain to prevent appearing vulnerable to predators. For this reason, behavioural changes in these species are mainly observed with acute pain (hours) but are less pronounced in longer-lasting pain (days).&lt;ref name="Faller" /&gt;

GS offer advantages over other methods of pain assessment. For example, the analgesic [[morphine]] reduces pain but can affect other aspects of behaviour in pain-free animals, for example, excitement, increased activity or sedation, which can hamper traditional behavioural assessment of its action on pain.  Morphine not only reduces the frequency of "pain faces" but has no effect on GS in baseline, pain-free mice.&lt;ref name="Flecknell"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Flecknell, P.A.|year=2010|title=Do mice have a pain face?|journal=Nature Methods|volume=7|issue=6|pages=437–438|url=http://www.proppi.uff.br/ceua/sites/default/files/pain_face_flecknell_1.pdf|doi=10.1038/nmeth0610-437}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In mice==
The GS for mice usually consists of five FAU, i.e. Orbital Tightening, Nose Bulge, Cheek Bulge, Ear position and Whisker Change.  These are scored on a 0-2 scale where 0=the criterion is absent, 1=moderately present and 2=obviously present (for exemplar images, see here [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3276965/figure/fig1/]).  In mice, the GS offers a means of assessing post-operative pain that is as effective as manual behavioural-based scoring, without the limitations of such approaches.

Facial grimacing by mice after undergoing [[laparotomy]] surgery indicates postoperative pain lasts for 36 to 48 h (and at relatively high levels for 8 to 12 h) with relative exacerbation during the early dark (active) photo-phase.  Furthermore, the grimacing indicates that [[buprenorphine]] is fully efficacious at recommended doses against early postoperative pain, but [[carprofen]] and [[ketoprofen]] are efficacious only at doses much higher than currently recommended: [[acetaminophen]] is not efficacious.&lt;ref name="Matsumiya"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Matsumiya, L.C., Sorge, R.E., Sotocinal, S.G., Tabaka, J.M., Wieskopf, J.S., Zaloum, A., ... &amp; Mogil, J.S.|year=2012|title=Using the Mouse Grimace Scale to reevaluate the efficacy of postoperative analgesics in laboratory mice|journal=Journal of the American Association for Laboratory Animal Science|volume=51|issue=1|pages=42–9|pmc= 3276965|pmid=22330867}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study in 2014 examined postoperative pain in mice following surgical induction of [[myocardial infarction]].  The effectiveness of the GS at identifying pain was compared with a traditional welfare scoring system based on behavioural, clinical and procedure-specific criteria.  It was reported that post hoc GS (but not real-time GS) indicated a significant proportion of the mice were in low-level pain at 24 h which were not identified as such by traditional assessment methods.  Importantly, those mice identified as experiencing low-level pain responded to analgesic treatment, indicating the traditional methods of welfare assessment were insensitive in this aspect of pain recognition.&lt;ref name="Faller"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Faller, K.M., McAndrew, D.J., Schneider, J.E. and Lygate, C.A.|year=2015|title=Refinement of analgesia following thoracotomy and experimental myocardial infarction using the Mouse Grimace Scale|journal=Experimental Physiology|volume=100|issue=2|pages=164–172|url= http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1113/expphysiol.2014.083139/pdf|doi=10.1113/expphysiol.2014.083139|pmc=4340041}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mice with induced [[sickle cell disease]] and their controls exhibited a "pain face" when tested on a cold plate, but sickle mice showed increased intensity compared to controls; this was confirmed using [[Von Frey hair|Von Frey filaments]] a traditional method of pain assessment.&lt;ref name="Sickle"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Mittal, A.M., Lamarre, Y.Y. and Gupta, K.|year=2014|title=Observer based objective pain quantification in sickle mice using grimace scoring and body parameters|journal=Blood|volume=124|issue=21|pages=4907-4907|url=http://www.bloodjournal.org/content/124/21/4907.full.pdf?sso-checked=true}}&lt;/ref&gt;  GS have also been used to assess pain and methods of its alleviation in pancreatitis.&lt;ref name="Pancreatitis"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Jurik, A., Ressle, A., Schmid, R.M., Wotjak, C.T. and Thoeringer, C.K.|year=2014|title=Supraspinal TRPV1 modulates the emotional expression of abdominal pain|journal=Pain|volume=155|issue=10|pages=2153–2160|url=http://hcpportalco20150204v2.pfizer.edrupalgardens.com/sites/g/files/g10020151/f/publicaciones/2014_155_10_Supraspinal-TRPV1-modulates-the-emotional.pdf|doi=10.1016/j.pain.2014.08.012|pmid=25139591}}&lt;/ref&gt;
GS have also been used to test the degree of pain caused as a side-effect of therapeutic drugs and methods of mitigating the pain.&lt;ref name="Melemedjian"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Melemedjian, O.K., Khoutorsky, A., Sorge, R.E., Yan, J., Asiedu, M.N., Valdez, A., ... &amp; Price, T.J.|year=2013|title=mTORC1 inhibition induces pain via IRS-1-dependent feedback activation of ERK|journal=Pain|volume=154|issue=7|pages=1080–1091|doi=10.1016/j.pain.2013.03.021|pmc=3742001|pmid=23607966}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mouse GS has been shown to be a highly accurate, repeatable and reliable means of assessing pain, requiring only a short period of training for the observer.&lt;ref name="Miller2015"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Miller, A.L.  |author2=Leach, M.C.|year=2015|title=The mouse grimace scale: a clinically useful tool?|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=10|issue=9|pages=e0136000|url= http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0136000|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0136000|pmid=26406227|pmc=4583436}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sex and strain effects===
It has been noted that [[DBA/2]] strain mice, but not CBA strain mice, show an increase in GS score following only [[isoflurane]] anaesthesia, which should be taken into account when using the GS to assess pain.  Administration of a common analgesic, [[buprenorphine]], had no effect on the GS of either strain.&lt;ref name="Miller"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Miller, A., Kitson, G., Skalkoyannis, B. and Leach, M.|year=2015|title=The effect of isoflurane anaesthesia and buprenorphine on the mouse grimace scale and behaviour in CBA and DBA/2 mice|journal=Applied Animal Behaviour Science|volume=172|issue=58–62|url= http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168159115002415|doi=10.1016/j.applanim.2015.08.038}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are interactions between the sex and strain of mice in their GS and also the method that is used to collect the data (i.e. real-time or post hoc), which indicates scorers need to consider these factors.&lt;ref name="Miller2015" /&gt;

===Effects of non-painful procedures===
It is important to establish whether methods of pain assessment in laboratory animals are influenced by other factors, especially those which are a normal part of routine procedures or husbandry.  There is no difference in GS scores between mice handled using a tube compared with mice picked up by the tail, indicating these handling techniques are not confounding factors in GS assessment.&lt;ref name="Handling"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Miller, A.L.  |author2=Leach, M.C.|year=2015|title=The effect of handling method on the mouse grimace scale in two strains of laboratory mice|journal=Laboratory Animals|url=http://lan.sagepub.com/content/early/2015/12/10/0023677215622144.full}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A similar study reported there was no difference between GS scores at baseline and immediately post [[Earmark (agriculture)|ear notching]] (a method frequently used to identify laboratory mice), potentially indicating that the pain associated with ear notching is either too acute to assess using the GS tool or the practice is not painful.&lt;ref name="Earnotching"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Miller, A.L.  |author2=Leach, M.C.|year=2014|title=Using the mouse grimace scale to assess pain associated with routine ear notching and the effect of analgesia in laboratory mice|journal=Laboratory Animals|url= http://lan.sagepub.com/content/early/2014/11/06/0023677214559084.abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In rats==
[[File:Rat agouti russian blue.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Closeup of the face of an agouti Russian blue rat]]
There are differences between the "pain face" of mice and rats.  In mice, the nose and cheek at baseline have a smooth appearance, but in the presence of pain, change to distinct bulges in both the nose and cheek regions.  By contrast, in rats at baseline, the nose and cheek regions show distinct bulging, and with pain, the bridge of the nose flattens and elongates causing the whisker pads to flatten.  As a consequence of these differences, the GS for rats sometimes use four FAU, i.e. Orbital Tightening, Nose/Cheek Flattening, Ear Changes and Whisker Changes.  Nose/Cheek Flattening, appears to show the highest correlation with the presence of pain in the rat.&lt;ref name="Whittaker"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Whittaker, A.L.  |author2=Howarth, G.S.|year=2014|title=Use of spontaneous behaviour measures to assess pain in laboratory rats and mice: How are we progressing?|journal=Applied Animal Behaviour Science|volume=151|pages=1–12|url= https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Alexandra_Whittaker/publication/260291380_Use_of_spontaneous_behaviour_measures_to_assess_pain_in_laboratory_rats_and_mice_How_are_we_progressing/links/00b7d5309ca17a87d2000000.pdf|doi=10.1016/j.applanim.2013.11.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sotocinal"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Sotocinal, S.G., Sorge, R E., Zaloum, A., Tuttle, A.H., Martin, L.J., Wieskopf, J.S., ... &amp; McDougall, J.J.|year=2011|title=The Rat Grimace Scale: a partially automated method for quantifying pain in the laboratory rat via facial expressions|journal=Molecular Pain|volume=7|issue=1|pages=55|url= http://www.molecularpain.com/content/pdf/1744-8069-7-55.pdf|doi=10.1186/1744-8069-7-55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

GS for rats has been used to assess pain due to surgery, [[orthodontic]] tooth movement, and the efficacy of analgesics for these procedures and other painful conditions.&lt;ref name="Sotocinal" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chi"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Chi, H., Kawano, T., Tamura, T., Iwata, H., Takahashi, Y., Eguchi, S., ... &amp; Yokoyama, M.|year=2013|title=Postoperative pain impairs subsequent performance on a spatial memory task via effects on N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor in aged rats|journal=Life Sciences|volume=93|issue=25|pages=986–993|doi=10.1016/j.lfs.2013.10.028|pmid=24211778}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Teeth"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Liao, L., Long, H., Zhang, L., Chen, H., Zhou, Y., Ye, N. and Lai, W.|year=2014|title=Evaluation of pain in rats through facial expression following experimental tooth movement|journal=European Journal of Oral Sciences|volume=122|issue=2|pages=121–124|doi=10.1111/eos.12110}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Long"&gt;{{cite journal|author= Long, H., Liao, L., Gao, M., Ma, W., Zhou, Y., Jian, F., ... &amp; Lai, W.|year=2015|title=Periodontal CGRP contributes to orofacial pain following experimental tooth movement in rats|journal=Neuropeptides|volume=52|pages=31–37|doi=10.1016/j.npep.2015.06.006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Davis"&gt;{{cite thesis|author=Davis, M.E.|year=2014|title=The Effect Of Sumatriptan On Clinically Relevant Behavioral Endpoints In A Recurrent Nitroglycerin Migraine Model In Rats|publisher=The University of Mississippi||url= http://thesis.honors.olemiss.edu/380/1/Morgan%20Davis%20Honors%20College%20Thesis.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, GS have been used to examine the effects of postoperative analgesia on the reduction of post-operative [[cognitive dysfunction]] in aged rats.&lt;ref name="Kawano"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Kawano, T., Takahashi, T., Iwata, H., Morikawa, A., Imori, S., Waki, S., ... &amp; Yokoyama, M.|year=2014|title=Effects of ketoprofen for prevention of postoperative cognitive dysfunction in aged rats|journal=Journal of Anesthesia|volume=28|issue=6|pages=932–936|doi=10.1007/s00540-014-1821-y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As with mice, studies have examined the extent of agreement in assessing pain between rat GS and the use of von Frey filaments.  Good agreement has been found between these&lt;ref name="DeRantere2014"&gt;{{cite thesis|url= http://theses.ucalgary.ca/bitstream/11023/1943/2/ucalgary_2014_derantere_debbie.pdf|year=2014|publisher=University of Calgary|author=De Rantere, D.|title=The Evaluation of the Rat Grimace Scale and Ultrasonic Vocalisations as Novel Pain Assessment Tools in Laboratory Rats}}&lt;/ref&gt; in relation to three models of pain (intra[[plantar]] [[carrageenan]], intraplantar complete [[Freund's adjuvant]] and plantar incision).  The GS score significantly increased in all pain models and the peak GS score also coincided with the development of paw hypersensitivity, although hypersensitivity persisted after GS scores returned to baseline.&lt;ref name="De Rantere2015"&gt;{{cite journal|author=De Rantere, D., Schuster, C.J., Reimer, J.N. and Pang, D.S.J.|year=2015|title=The relationship between the Rat Grimace Scale and mechanical hypersensitivity testing in three experimental pain models|journal=European Journal of Pain|url= http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ejp.742/abstract?userIsAuthenticated=false&amp;deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=|doi=10.1002/ejp.742|volume=20|pages=417–426}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For rats, software (Rodent Face Finder®) has been developed which successfully automates the most labour-intensive step in the process of quantifying the GS, i.e. frame-grabbing individual face-containing frames from digital video, which is hindered by animals not looking directly at the camera or poor images due to motion blurring.&lt;ref name="Oliver"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Oliver, V., De Rantere, D., Ritchie, R., Chisholm, J., Hecker, K.G. and Pang, D.S.|year=2014|title=Psychometric assessment of the Rat Grimace Scale and development of an analgesic intervention score|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=9|issue=5|pages=e97882|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0097882|url= http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0097882|pmid=24838111|pmc=4024023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In rabbits==
A GS for rabbits using four FAU, i.e. Orbital Tightening, Cheek Flattening, Nose Shape, Whisker Position (Ear Position is excluded from the analysis) has been developed (for exemplar images, see here [http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0044437]) and used to assess the effectiveness of an analgesic cream for rabbits having undergone ear-[[tattoo]]ing.&lt;ref name="Keating"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Keating, S.C., Thomas, A.A., Flecknell, P.A. and Leach, M.C.|year=2012|title=Evaluation of EMLA cream for preventing pain during tattooing of rabbits: changes in physiological, behavioural and facial expression responses|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=7|issue=9|pages=e44437|url= http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0044437|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0044437|pmid=22970216|pmc=3436883}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, a GS has been used to evaluate wellness in the post-procedural monitoring of rabbits.&lt;ref name="Hampshire"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Hampshire, V.  |author2=Robertson, S.|year=2015|title=Using the facial grimace scale to evaluate rabbit wellness in post-procedural monitoring|journal=Lab Animal|volume=44|issue=7|pages=259–260|doi=10.1038/laban.806}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In horses==

Based on the identification of FAU in rodents and rabbits, a GS for horses has been developed from post-operative ([[castration]]) individuals.  This is based on six FAU, i.e. Stiffly Backwards Ears, Orbital Tightening, Tension Above the Eye Area, Prominent Strained Chewing Muscles, Mouth Strained and Pronounced Chin, Strained Nostrils and Flattening of the Profile (for exemplar images, see here.[http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0092281])&lt;ref name="Dalla"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Dalla Costa, E., Minero, M., Lebelt, D., Stucke, D., Canali, E. and Leach, M.C.|year=2014|title=Development of the Horse Grimace Scale (HGS) as a pain assessment tool in horses undergoing routine castration|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=9|issue=3|pages=e92281|url= http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0092281|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0092281|pmid=24647606|pmc=3960217}}&lt;/ref&gt; The HGS has thereafter been used to evaluate pain behavior in the laminitic horse, where it was concluded that the grimace scale can be used to assess the degree of pain also here, when compared to the Obel scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dalla Costa|first1=Emanuela|last2=Stucke|first2=Diana|last3=Dai|first3=Francesca|last4=Minero|first4=Michela|last5=Leach|first5=Matthew|last6=Lebelt|first6=Dirk|title=Using the Horse Grimace Scale (HGS) to Assess Pain Associated with Acute Laminitis in Horses (Equus caballus)|journal=Animals|date=3 August 2016|volume=6|issue=8|pages=47|doi=10.3390/ani6080047}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A related study&lt;ref name="Gleerup"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Gleerup, K.B., Forkman, B., Lindegaard, C. and Andersen, P.H.|year=2015|title=An equine pain face|journal=Veterinary Anaesthesia and Analgesia|volume=42|issue=1|pages=103–114|url= http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/vaa.12212/full|doi=10.1111/vaa.12212}}&lt;/ref&gt; describes the equine “pain face” after pain induction by a tourniquet on the antebrachium or topical capsaicin. The pain face here involves similar facial expressions described for the HGS; low and/or asymmetrical ears, an angled appearance of the eyes, a withdrawn and/or tense stare, medio-laterally dilated nostrils and tension of the lips, chin and certain mimetic muscles and can potentially be incorporated to improve existing pain evaluation tools. From the described pain face, The Equine Pain Scale has been developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gleerup|first1=K. B.|last2=Lindegaard|first2=C.|title=Recognition and quantification of pain in horses: A tutorial review|journal=Equine Veterinary Education|date=January 2016|volume=28|issue=1|pages=47–57|doi=10.1111/eve.12383}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Another pain scale has been described (EQUUS-FAP) which also has proven to assess acute pain in horses in a significant way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=van Loon|first1=Johannes P.A.M.|last2=Van Dierendonck|first2=Machteld C.|title=Monitoring equine head-related pain with the Equine Utrecht University scale for facial assessment of pain (EQUUS-FAP)|journal=The Veterinary Journal|date=February 2017|volume=220|pages=88–90|doi=10.1016/j.tvjl.2017.01.006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To map and explain the different facial expressions seen in the equine face during acute pain, an equine facial action coding system (EquiFACS) has been developed. Seventeen FAU have been identified and the involved anatomical structures behind each facial expression are explained and compared to facial expressions seen in other species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wathan|first1=Jen|last2=Burrows|first2=Anne M.|last3=Waller|first3=Bridget M.|last4=McComb|first4=Karen|last5=Hillmann|first5=Edna|title=EquiFACS: The Equine Facial Action Coding System|journal=PLOS ONE|date=5 August 2015|volume=10|issue=8|pages=e0131738|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0131738}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In cats==
Observers shown facial images from painful and pain-free cats had difficulty in identifying pain-free from painful cats, with only 13% of observers being able to discriminate more than 80% of painful cats.&lt;ref name="Holden"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Holden, E., Calvo, G., Collins, M., Bell, A., Reid, J., Scott, E.M. and Nolan, A.M.|year=2014|title=Evaluation of facial expression in acute pain in cats|journal=Journal of Small Animal Practice|volume=55|issue=12|pages=615–621|doi=10.1111/jsap.12283}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In sheep==
A GS for sheep has been developed to detect pain caused by naturally occurring diseases such as [[footrot]] and [[mastitis]].&lt;ref name="McLennan"&gt;{{cite journal|author=McLennan, K.M., Rebelo, C.J., Corke, M.J., Holmes, M.A., Leach, M.C. and Constantino-Casas, F.|year=2016|title=Development of a facial expression scale using footrot and mastitis as models of pain in sheep|journal=Applied Animal Behaviour Science|doi=10.1016/j.applanim.2016.01.007|volume=176|pages=19–26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A GS has been used to assess pain due to the routine husbandry procedure of [[Docking (animal)|tail-docking]] in lambs.  There was high reliability between and within the observers, and high accuracy.  Restraint of the lambs during the tail-docking caused changes in facial expression, which needs to be taken into account in use of the GS.&lt;ref name="RSPCA"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Guesgen, M.  |author2=Leach, M.|title=Assessing pain using the lamb grimace scale (LGS)|url=http://norecopa.no/files/RSPCA-AHVLA2013.pdf|year=2014|accessdate=January 11, 2015|publisher=RSPCA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2016">'''Historical theology''' as a branch of [[theology]] investigates the socio-historical and cultural mechanisms that give rise to theological ideas, statements, and systems.   The field focuses on the relationship between [[theology]] and its contexts, as well as on the major theological or philosophical influences upon the figures and topics studied. Its methodological foundation and aims are similar to those used by intellectual historians researching historical epistemology, particularly those such as Matthew Daniel Eddy, who investigate the cultural connections between theology and other disciplines that existed in the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eddy|first1=Matthew Daniel|title=The Cognitive Unity of Calvinist Pedagogy in Enlightenment Scotland|journal=in Ábrahám Kovács (Ed.), Reformed Churches Working Unity in Diversity: Global Historical, Theological and Ethical perspectives|date=(Budapest: L’Harmattan, 2016)|pages=46–60.|url=https://www.academia.edu/28249746/_The_Cognitive_Unity_of_Calvinist_Pedagogy_in_Enlightenment_Scotland_in_Ábrahám_Kovács_Ed._Reformed_Churches_Working_Unity_in_Diversity_Global_Historical_Theological_and_Ethical_perspectives_Budapest_L_Harmattan_2016_46-60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''illusion of asymmetric insight''' is a [[cognitive bias]] whereby people perceive their knowledge of others to surpass other people's knowledge of them.&lt;ref name=singleref&gt;{{harvnb|Pronin et al.|2001}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This bias "has been traced to people's tendency to view their own spontaneous or off-the-cuff responses to others' questions as relatively unrevealing even though they view others' similar responses as meaningful".{{sfn|Pronin et al.|2008}}

==Study==
A study finds that people seem to believe that they know themselves better than their peers know themselves and that their social group knows and understands other social groups better than other social groups know them.&lt;ref name=singleref/&gt; For example: Person A knows Person A better than Person B knows Person B or Person A. This bias may be sustained by a few cognitive beliefs, including:
*The personal conviction that observed behaviors are more revealing of other people than of the self, while private thoughts and feelings are more revealing of the self.
*The more an individual perceives negative traits ascribed to someone else, the more doubt individuals express about this person's self-knowledge. But, this doubt does not exist for our own self-knowledge. (For example: if Person A believes Person B has some great character flaw, Person A will distrust Person B's self-knowledge, while sustaining that they do not hold that same flaw in self-knowledge.)

A group of studies, performed by Pronin, Kruger, Savitsky, &amp; Ross (2001), points to several different manifestations of the illusion of asymmetric insight:&lt;ref name=singleref/&gt;
* Study 1: Close friends' assessments of interpersonal knowledge: We know our close friends better than they know us. We understand them better, too.
* Study 2: Roommates' assessments of interpersonal and intrapersonal knowledge: We believe we know our roommates better than they know us. We know ourselves better than our roommates know themselves. And, we think the discrepancy between our self-knowledge and our roommate's knowledge of us is bigger than the discrepancy between how well we know our roommates and how well they know themselves.
* Study 3: Beliefs about the observability of one's own versus others' "true self": We believe we are less knowable than our friends—i.e., it is easier to get to know our friends than it is to get to know us.
* Study 4: Assessments of interpersonal knowledge after face-to-face interactions: In interpersonal interactions, we believe we find out more about other people than other people find out about us.
* Study 5: Perceived diagnosticity of our own versus others' responses to a [[projective test]]: Projective tests are better able to be diagnostic about other people, but not about ourselves.

'''Industrial computed tomography''' ('''CT''') '''scanning''' is any computer-aided [[tomography|tomographic]] process, usually [[X-ray computed tomography]], that uses [[irradiation]] to produce three-dimensional internal and external representations of a scanned object. Industrial CT scanning has been used in many areas of industry for internal inspection of components. Some of the key uses for industrial CT scanning have been flaw detection, failure analysis, metrology, assembly analysis and [[reverse engineering]] applications.&lt;ref&gt;Flisch, A., et al.

DGZfP-Proceedings BB 67-CD Paper 8, Computerized Tomography for Industrial Applications and Image Processing in Radiology, March 15–17, 1999, Berlin, Germany.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Woods, Susan. [https://web.archive.org/web/20110821224332/http://micromanufacturing.com/showthread.php?t=876 "3-D CT inspection offers a full view of microparts"], November 1, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Just as in [[medical imaging]], industrial imaging includes both nontomographic radiography ([[industrial radiography]]) and computed tomographic radiography (computed tomography).

==Types of scanners==
[[File:CT Scanner Line Beam.jpg|thumb|alt=CT Scanner Beamline|right|Line beam scanner]]

''Line beam scanning'' is the traditional process of industrial CT scanning.&lt;ref name="Hofmann"&gt;Hofmann, J., Flisch, A., Obrist, A., Adaptive CT scanning-mesh based optimisation methods for industrial X-ray computer tomography applications. NDT&amp;E International (37), 2004, pp. 271–278.&lt;/ref&gt; X-rays are produced and the beam is collimated to create a line. The X-ray line beam is then translated across the part and data is collected by the detector.  The data is then reconstructed to create a 3-D v[[Volume rendering|olume rendering]] of the part.

In ''cone beam scanning'', the part to be scanned is placed on a rotary table.&lt;ref name="Hofmann" /&gt; As the part rotates, the cone of X-rays produce a large number of 2D images that are collected by the detector. The 2D images are then processed to create a 3D [[volume rendering]] of the external and internal geometries of the part.

==History==
Industrial CT scanning technology was introduced in 1972 with the invention of the [[CT scan|CT scanner]] for medical imaging by [[Godfrey Hounsfield]]. The invention earned him a Nobel Prize in medicine, which he shared with [[Allan McLeod Cormack]].&lt;ref&gt;Zoofan, Bahman. [http://www.3dscanningtechnologies.com/ComputedTomographyPage.php?3D_Micro-Tomography_-_A_Powerful_Engineering_Tool-4/ "3D Micro-Tomography – A Powerful Engineering Tool"]. 3D Scanning Technologies. July 5, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.3dscanningtechnologies.com/pdfs/parts.pdf Noel, Julien. "Advantages of CT in 3D Scanning of Industrial Parts]. August 18, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Many advances in CT scanning have allowed for its use in the industrial field for metrology in addition to the visual inspection primarily used in the medical field (medical [[CT scan]]).

==Analysis and inspection techniques==
Various inspection uses and techniques include part-to-CAD comparisons, part-to-part comparisons, assembly and defect analysis, void analysis, wall thickness analysis, and generation of CAD data. The CAD data can be used for [[reverse engineering]], geometric dimensioning and tolerance analysis, and production part approval.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110714085255/http://www.micromanu.com/x/guideArchiveArticle.html?id=1695 "Reducing Preproduction Inspection Costs with Industrial (CT) Computed Tomography."] Micro Manufacturing Magazine for the global micro manufacturing technology industry, August 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Assembly===
One of the most recognized forms of analysis using CT is for assembly, or visual analysis. CT scanning provides views inside components in their functioning position, without disassembly. Some software programs for industrial CT scanning allow for measurements to be taken from the CT dataset volume rendering. These measurements are useful for determining the clearances between assembled parts or the dimension of an individual feature.[[File:Industrial Computed Tomography - Failures - Void.jpg|thumb|An industrial computed tomography (CT) scan conducted on an aluminum casting to identify internal failures such as voids. All color coordinated particles within casting are voids/porosity/air pockets, which can additionally be measured and are color coordinated according to size.]]

===Void, crack and defect detection===
[[File:Peppergrinder 3D-flight-through microCT.OGG|thumb|Flight through a 3D reconstruction of a disposable pepper grinder. Glass in blue.]]

Traditionally, determining defects, voids and cracks within an object would require destructive testing. CT scanning can detect internal features and flaws displaying this information in 3D without destroying the part. Industrial CT scanning (3D X-ray) is used to detect flaws inside a part such as porosity,&lt;ref name=Lambert&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Lambert | first1 = J. | last2 = Chambers | first2 = A.

Metal casting and moulded plastic components are typically prone to porosity because of cooling processes, transitions between thick and thin walls, and material properties. Void analysis can be used to locate, measure, and analyze voids inside plastic or metal components.

===Geometric dimensioning and tolerancing analysis===
Traditionally, without destructive testing, full metrology has only been performed on the exterior dimensions of components, such as with a [[coordinate-measuring machine]] or with a vision system to map exterior surfaces. Internal inspection methods would require using a 2D X-ray of the component or the use of destructive testing. Industrial CT scanning allows for full non-destructive metrology.

===Image-based finite element methods===
Image-based finite element method converts the 3D image data from X-ray computed tomography directly into meshes for [[Finite element method|finite element analysis]]. Benefits of this method include modelling complex geometries (e.g. composite materials) or accurately modelling "as manufactured" components at the micro-scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Transient thermal finite element analysis of CFC–Cu ITER monoblock using X-ray tomography data|url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/277338941_Transient_thermal_finite_element_analysis_of_CFCCu_ITER_monoblock_using_X-ray_tomography_data|journal = Fusion Engineering and Design|date = 2015-05-28|pages = 100–111|volume = 100|doi = 10.1016/j.fusengdes.2015.04.048|first = Ll.

[[File:Electric hanukkah menora van.jpg|300px|thumb|right|Local [[Chabad house]] drives around [[Paris]] to get Jewish people interested in [[Hanukka]] services]]

'''Jewish outreach''' is a term sometimes used to translate the [[Hebrew]] word '''''kiruv''''' or '''''keruv''''' (literally, "to draw close" or "in-reach"). Normative [[Judaism]] does not actively seek [[Conversion to Judaism|converts]], although all denominations do accept those with a sincere commitment. Outreach efforts are instead directed at [[Jews]] who have "gone astray", or who have been born Jewish in a non-observant family.&lt;ref name="eJewish Philanthropy"&gt;{{cite web | title=Jewish Outreach, an Unorthodox Approach | website=eJewish Philanthropy | url=http://ejewishphilanthropy.com/jewish-outreach-an-unorthodox-approach/ | access-date=January 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background and contemporary views==
The idea of "Jewish outreach" has mixed support among [[Jews]]; some are against the concept, while others share a vision of a more accessible and inclusive Jewish community.&lt;ref name="Jewish Outreach Institute"&gt;{{cite web | title=Jewish Federation of Greater St. Paul | website=Jewish Outreach Institute | url=https://jewishstpaul.org/community-directory/jewish-outreach-institute | access-date=January 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States]], a country with a large [[Secular Jewish]] population and a 50% intermarriage rate, some Jewish federations and educational organizations provide an extensive range of offerings to the intermarried, to those who are marginally engaged with Jewish life, and to those who haven’t had any involvement in Judaism since attending Hebrew school or right after their [[bar mitzvah]].&lt;ref name="myjewishlearning"&gt;{{cite web | last=Cohen | first=Debra Nussbaum | title=Jewish Outreach | website=My Jewish Learning | date=September 30, 2002 | url=https://www.myjewishlearning.com/history/Jewish_World_Today/Continuity/Outreach.shtml | access-date=January 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; "[[Chabad Lubavitch]]" was the first [[Orthodox Jewish]] organization in the United States to promote outreach means of recruiting  unobservant Jews who commit to living an observant lifestyle. 

[[Rabbi]] Dr. [[Shmuly Yanklowitz]] wrote that "outreach should enrich lives and society by making the [[Torah]]’s wisdom more broadly available. Further, outreach is not only about “one’s own” and we must bring people of different religions together in mutual understanding and respect by engaging in deep interfaith dialogue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Yanklowitz|first1=Shmuly|title=The Need for Empowering and Ethical Jewish Outreach|url=http://ejewishphilanthropy.com/the-need-for-empowering-and-ethical-jewish-outreach/|website=ejewishphilanthropy|accessdate=12 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rabbi [[Levi Brackman]] said, "with the high rate of assimilation and intermarriage in the West, I cannot imagine that there could be too many outreach workers in the field. The day that happens will be a blessed one. The battle against assimilation is far too important for its warriors to get embroiled in politics of this sort. Undoubtedly, all the outreach organizations, Chabad included, should put their differences aside and pool together all their resources and ideas to create an even brighter Jewish tomorrow."&lt;ref name="Ynetnews"&gt;{{cite web | title=The Jewish outreach absurdity | website=Ynetnews | url=https://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3501215,00.html | access-date=January 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Anti-Semitism}}
{{Discrimination sidebar}}
A '''Jewish quota''' was a [[racial quota]] limiting the number of [[Jew]]s in various establishments to a certain percentage. In particular, in the 19th and 20th centuries, some countries had Jewish quotas in [[higher education]].

Jewish [[educational quotas]] could be statewide law or adopted only in certain institutions, often unofficially. The limitation took the form of total prohibition of Jewish students, or of limiting the number of Jewish students so that their share in the students' population would not be larger than their share in the general population.{{why|date=May 2018}} In some establishments, the Jewish quota placed a limit on growth rather than set a fixed level of participation to be achieved.

Jews who wanted an education used various ways to overcome this discrimination: bribing the authorities, changing their religion, or traveling to countries without such limitations. In Hungary, for example, 5,000 Jewish youngsters (including [[Edward Teller]]) left the country after the introduction of ''[[numerus clausus]]''.

==Countries legislating limitations on the admission of Jewish students==
* [[Canada]]: Certain universities, notably [[McGill University]], [[Université de Montréal]] and the [[University of Toronto]], had longstanding quotas on the number of Jews admitted to the respective universities. [[McGill University]]'s strict quota was the longest, being officially adopted in 1920 up until the late 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Gerald Tulchinsky, ''Canada's Jews: A People's Journey'', (Toronto: University of Toronto Press), 2008, p. 132-133, 319-321.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tulchinsky, ''Canada's Jews'', p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tulchinsky, ''Canada's Jews'', p. 410.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* [[Germany]]: On 25 April 1933, the [[Nazi]] government introduced a 1.5 percent quota for new admissions of German Non-[[Aryan race|Aryans]]—i.e. essentially of German Jews—as core issue of a law claiming to generally limit the number of (Aryan and non-Aryan) students admitted to high-schools (''höhere Schulen'') and universities. In addition, high-schools and universities deemed to have more students than required for the professions for which they were training their students were required to reduce their student enrollment; doing so, they had to reach a maximum of 5 per cent of German non-Aryan students. The law was supposedly enacted to avoid overcrowding schools and universities,&lt;ref&gt;[http://alex.onb.ac.at/cgi-content/anno-plus?apm=0&amp;aid=dra&amp;datum=19330004&amp;zoom=2&amp;seite=00000225&amp;ues=0&amp;x=9&amp;y=13 Gesetz gegen die Überfüllung deutscher Schulen und Hochschulen (RGBl 1933 I, S. 225)] (original German text of the ''Law against the Overcrowding of German Schools and Universities'', introduced in 1933)
[http://alex.onb.ac.at/cgi-content/anno-plus?apm=0&amp;aid=dra&amp;datum=19330004&amp;seite=00000226&amp;zoom=2 Erste Verordnung zur Durchführung des Gesetzes gegen die Überfüllung deutscher Schulen und Hochschulen (RGBl 1933 I, S. 226)] (original German text of the ''First Regulation for the Implementation of the Law against the Overcrowding of German Schools and Universities'', introduced in 1933)&lt;/ref&gt; which referred to German concerns at the time that large numbers of students would decrease the quality of higher education. At the beginning of 1933, about 0.76 percent of the German population was Jewish, but more than 3.6 percent of German university students were Jewish, this number having steadily declined from over 9 percent in the 1880s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/pss/40185665 Claudia Huerkamp (1993). Jüdische Akademikerinnen in Deutschland 1900–1938 (= Jewish academics in Germany 1900–1938). ''Geschichte und Gesellschaft, 19. Jg. (Heft 3),'' Rassenpolitik und Geschlechterpolitik im Nationalsozialismus, pp. 311–331.] Publisher: Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht (GmbH &amp; Co. KG)&lt;/ref&gt; After 30 July 1939, Jews were no longer permitted to attend German public schools at all, and the prior quota law was eliminated by a non-public regulation in January 1940.&lt;ref name="Olenhusen"&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/pss/30196241 A. G. v. Olenhusen: Die "nichtarischen" Studenten an den deutschen Hochschulen (= The non-Aryan students at German universities). ''Vierteljahrshefte für Zeitgeschichte, 14(1966),'' pp. 175–206.] (German)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;p.&amp;nbsp;193&lt;/sup&gt;

: Apart from their strong and predominant anti-Semitic agenda, the law and its subsequent regulations were temporarily indeed used to limit general university access, i.e. including "non-Aryans" (Jews), as the name of the law implied. Starting 1934, a regulation limited the overall numbers of students admitted to German universities, and a special quota was introduced reducing women's admissions to a maximum of 10 percent. Although the limits were not entirely enforced—women's quota stayed a bit above 10 percent mainly because a smaller percentage of men than women accepted their university admissions—they made it for women approximately twice as hard to enter a university career than for men with the same qualification.&lt;ref name="Bildungsbürgerinnen"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=QVToe3288bEC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=%C3%BCberfremdung&amp;f=false Claudia Huerkamp (1996).

(Reihe: ''Bürgertum, Band 10'')] {{ISBN|3-525-35675-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;S.&amp;nbsp;80ff.&lt;/sup&gt; After two semesters, the admission limits were revoked, however, leaving in place the non-Aryan regulations.&lt;ref name="Olenhusen"/&gt;&lt;sup&gt;p.&amp;nbsp;178&lt;/sup&gt;
:''For additional information in German, see the [[:de:Gesetz gegen die Überfüllung deutscher Schulen und Hochschulen|article at the German Wikipedia]]''
* [[Hungary]]: a ''Numerus Clausus'' Act was introduced in 1920, under the government of [[Pál Teleki]]. It was said that the ethnic rate of students must meet the ethnic rate of population. Limitations were relaxed in 1928. Racial criteria in admitting new students were removed and replaced by social criteria. Five categories were set up: civil servants, war veterans and army officers, small landowners and artisans, industrialists, and the merchant classes.&lt;ref&gt;See: [https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0015_0_14969.html Numerus Clausus]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Imperial Russia]] and [[Soviet Union]]: ''Numerus Clausus'' was enacted in 1887, stating that the share of Jewish students should be no more than 10 percent in cities where [[Jew]]s were [[Pale of Settlement|allowed to live]], 5 percent in other cities, and only 3 percent in [[Moscow]] and [[Saint Petersburg|St. Petersburg]]. These limitations were removed in the spring of 1917 after the tsar's abdication during the early phase of the Russian revolution of 1917-1918 (the so-called [[February Revolution]] of 1917); later, in the late 1940s during the initial phase of the [[Cold War]] and the tide of the anti-"[[rootless cosmopolitan]]" campaign a [[de facto]] gross discrimination of Jewish applicants was reintroduced in many institutions of higher education in the [[Soviet Union]] until [[Perestroika]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor=[[Mikhail Shifman]] |title=You Failed Your Math Test, Comrade Einstein: Adventures and Misadventures of Young Mathematicians Or Test Your Skills in Almost Recreational Mathematics |publisher=World Scientific |date=2005 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ho6fMF8ehogC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=[[Edward Frenkel]] |title=The Fifth problem: math &amp; anti-Semitism in the Soviet Union |date=October 2012 |journal=The New Criterion |url=http://www.newcriterion.com/articles.cfm/The-Fifth-problem--math---anti-Semitism-in-the-Soviet-Union-7446}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/dominic-lawson/dominic-lawson-more-migrants-please-especially-the-clever-ones-2368622.html |location=London |work=[[The Independent]] |date=October 11, 2011 |title=More migrants please, especially the clever ones|author=[[Dominic Lawson]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=[[Andre Geim]] |title=Biographical |publisher=Nobelprize.org |date=2010 |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2010/geim-bio.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Poland]]: see [[Numerus clausus#Poland|Numerus clausus in Poland]] and [[Ghetto benches]].
* [[Romania]] ''Numerus Clausus'' was not introduced by law,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hist-chron.com/judentum-aktenlage/numerus-clausus/EncJud_num-claus-d/EncJud_numerus-clausus-band12-kolonne-1267-1268.gif |title=Encyclopaedia Judaica: Numerus clausus, vol. 12, col. 1267-1268}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it was adopted by students in the universities Cluj, Bucharest, Iasi and Cernauti.
* [[United States]]: Certain private universities, most notably [[Harvard]], introduced policies which effectively placed a quota on the number of Jews admitted to the university. According to historian [[David Oshinsky]], on writing about [[Jonas Salk]], "Most of the surrounding medical schools ([[Cornell University|Cornell]], [[Columbia University|Columbia]], [[University of Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania]], and [[Yale University|Yale]]) had rigid quotas in place. In 1935 Yale accepted 76 applicants from a pool of 501. About 200 of those applicants were Jewish and only five got in." He notes that Dean Milton Winternitz's instructions were remarkably precise: "Never admit more than five Jews, take only two Italian Catholics, and take no blacks at all."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gerard N. Burrow|title=A History of Yale's School of Medicine: Passing Torches to Others|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XzYX_MduAG8C&amp;pg=PA107|year=2008|publisher=Yale University Press|page=107ff}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Oshinsky added, "[[Jonas Salk]] and hundreds like him" enrolled in [[New York University]] instead.&lt;ref&gt;Oshinsky, David M.

See also [[Numerus clausus#United States|Numerus clausus in the United States]].
* [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]]: In 1940, the Yugoslav government enacted the Decree on the Enrollment of Persons of Jewish Descent at the University, Secondary School, Teacher Training College and Other Vocational Schools which limited the proportion of Jewish students to the proportion of Jews in the total population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.ceu.hu/jewishstudies/pdf/02_goldstein.pdf |title=The Jews in Yugoslavia 1918-1941: Antisemitism and the Struggle for Equality |last=Goldstein |first=Ivo |authorlink=Ivo Goldstein |pages=10–11 |format=PDF |accessdate=6 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Keeping All Students Safe Act''' refers to a pair of  [[American (USA)|American]] legislative proposals introduced in the [[United States House of Representatives]] on April 6, 2011 as  [http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d112:h.r.1381: H.R. 1381] and in the [[United States Senate|Senate]]  on December 16, 2011 as [http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d112:s.2020: S.2020].  The bills are designed to protect children from the abuse of restraint and seclusion in school.  The first Congressional bill was introduced in the United States House of Representatives on December 9, 2007 and named the Preventing Harmful Restraint and Seclusion in Schools Act.&lt;ref name="HR4247"&gt;[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:H.R.4247: HR4247] Preventing Harmful Restraint and Seclusion in Schools Act, H.R. 4247, U.S. House of Representatives, Dec. 9, 2009.  Retrieved March 11, 2012, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  The primary sponsors of the two bills are Senator [[Tom Harkin]] (D-IA), Chair of the [[United States Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions|Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee]], Congressman [[George Miller (California politician)|George Miller]] (D-CA), Ranking Member of the [[United States House Committee on Education and the Workforce|House Education and Workforce Committee]], and Congressman [[Gregg Harper]] (R-MS).

==Background &amp; Legislative History==
Restraint involves immobilizing an individual and preventing him or her from moving his or her arms, legs, body, or head freely.  Seclusion involves the involuntary confinement of an individual in a room or area from which the individual is physically prevented from leaving, whether the room is locked or the door is blocked by furniture.&lt;ref name="S2020"&gt;[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d112:s.2020: S.2020] Keeping All Students Safe Act, sec. 2, S.2020, U.S. Senate, Dec. 16, 2011.  Retrieved March 11, 2012, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, the United States [[Government Accountability Office]] (GAO) undertook a nationwide study of the use of restraint and seclusion in schools and its effects.&lt;ref name="GAO1"&gt;[http://www.gao.gov/assets/130/122526.pdf  U.S. GAO Report] United States Government Accountability Office, “Seclusions and Restraints, Selected Cases of Death and Abuse at Public and Private Schools and Treatment Centers,” May 19, 2009.  Retrieved March 11, 2012, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  The GAO found "hundreds of cases of alleged abuse and death related to the use of these methods on schoolchildren during the past two decades."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/senate-oks-bill-limiting-teachers-in-restraint-seclusion-of-students-q93u2gl-137984118.html Journal Sentinel], “Senate OKs Bill Limiting Teachers In Restraint, Seclusion Of Students,” Journal Sentinel, Jan. 24, 2012.

The GAO documented 20 deaths of children from restraint.  The GAO also reported about restraints that resulted in broken arms, and kindergartners who were tied to chairs with duct tape and who suffered bloody noses.&lt;ref name="GAO1" /&gt;  One teenager hanged himself in a seclusion room, while a teacher sat outside the room.  Before the final episode, he was confined 19 times in a concrete 8 foot by 8 foot room for an average of 94 minutes each time.  His parents were never informed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ajc.com/news/death-highlights-lack-of-100352.html Atlanta Journal Constitution], Alan Judd, “Death Highlights Lack of Regulation at Psycho-educational Schools,” Atlanta Journal Constitution, July 27, 2009.

On May 19, 2009, the House Education and Labor Committee held hearings about the use of restraint and seclusion, chaired by Congressman George Miller.&lt;ref name="hearing1"&gt;[http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CHRG-111hhrg49597/pdf/CHRG-111hhrg49597.pdf  U.S. House of Representatives Hearings]  U.S. Congress, Hearing Before the House Committee on Education and Labor, Examining the Abusive and Deadly Use of Seclusion and Restraint in Schools, 111th Congress, May 19, 2009.

One witness testified that her 14-year-old son was killed when restrained by his 230-pound teacher, who smothered him by lying on top of him in a restraint during a disagreement about lunch.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.cnn.com/2009-05-19/politics/schools.abuse_1_teacher-testimony-toni-price?_s=PM:POLITICS  CNN Restraints] Congress Hears Accounts Of Abused Special-Needs Students, CNN, May 19, 2009.  Retrieved March 11, 2012, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  Another witness testified that her 7-year-old daughter was bruised when she was restrained face down for playing with her tooth, but the parent was never informed by the school.  She also testified that her child was later restrained again, and received a severe abrasion, but she was not informed of the restraint.  She testified that other children were denied access to food, water, and the bathroom while isolated in seclusion confinement rooms.&lt;ref name="hearing1" /&gt;

The GAO presented testimony about its report and findings about restraint and seclusion, and the risk of death and injury.&lt;ref name="hearing1" /&gt;  The GAO also reported that restraint and seclusion have been used to control minor student misbehaviors such as speaking out of turn or refusing to remain in one’s chair.&lt;ref name="USN1" /&gt;  Another hearing witness testified that restraint may be needed in emergencies. He noted that sometimes educators need to use restraint in emergency situations, where there is a risk that a child will injure himself or others and nothing else will work to prevent the immediate danger.  Teachers may use restraint and seclusion appropriately in those circumstances, the witness testified.&lt;ref name="NPR2"&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=104277070 National Public Radio] Joseph Shapiro, “Report: Discipline Methods Endanger Disabled Kids,” National Public Radio, May 19, 2009.

The United States House of Representatives reported that children, most often children with disabilities, are subjected to seclusion and restraint at much higher rates than adults, and are at greater risk of injury as a result of these practices. The House further reported that children under the age of 12 are restrained or secluded at higher rates than any other age group.  The House of Representatives also reported that, “the use of restraint and seclusion often exacerbates the behaviors that staff are trying to eliminate.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CRPT-111hrpt417/pdf/CRPT-111hrpt417.pdf  House Report 111-417], U.S. House of Representatives, Committee on Education &amp; Labor, House Report 111-417, Preventing Harmful Restraint and Seclusion in Schools, Feb. 23, 2010.

Because there is no federal law, state restraint and seclusion laws control.&lt;ref name="CNNState"&gt;[http://articles.cnn.com/2009-05-18/politics/siu.schools.abuse_1_special-needs-students-teacher-gao?_s=PM:POLITICS CNN Report] Abbie Boudreau &amp; Steve Turnham, “GAO report: Special-Needs Kids Abused In Schools,” CNN, May 18, 2009.

It reported that only 14 states limited the use of restraint to emergencies involving threats of physical injury. Only 11 either banned all forms of seclusion or restricted it to emergency threats of physical harm.  There are 27 states that have no requirement to notify parents when a child is restrained or secluded and only 12 states that require same day or next day notification.&lt;ref name="HowSafe"&gt;[http://www.autcom.org/pdf/HowSafeSchoolhouse.pdf  How Safe Is the Schoolhouse?] Jessica Butler, “How Safe Is The Schoolhouse?

As there is no national clearinghouse that gathers data on the use of the techniques, the exact number of children subjected to restraint and seclusion in school is unknown.&lt;ref name="USN1" /&gt;  The GAO found that only five states kept records.  In two of them, Texas and California, there were over 33,000 cases in 2007-08.  Many of the children had cognitive disabilities, autism, mental health disabilities, attention deficit disorder and other disabilities.&lt;ref name="NPR2" /&gt;  Professor Reece Peterson testified at the House Education and Labor hearing about the need for federal law requiring data collection nationwide.&lt;ref name="hearing1" /&gt;

On December 9, 2009, six months after the House hearing, the first national restraint and seclusion bill was introduced by Congressman George Miller.  It was cosponsored by Congresswoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers.  A companion bill was introduced in the Senate by Senator Chris Dodd.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.disabilityscoop.com/2009/12/09/restraint-bill-introduced/6448/ Disability Scoop], Michelle Diament, “Lawmakers Unveil Restraint And Seclusion Bill,” Disability Scoop, December 9, 2009.

Restraint and seclusion bills were introduced again in the 112th Congress in 2011.  On April 6, 2011, Congressman George Miller (D-CA), Ranking Member of the House Education and Workforce Committee, reintroduced the Keeping All Students Safe Act, cosponsored by Congressman Greg Harper (R-MS).&lt;ref name="HR1381"&gt;[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d112:h.r.1381:  H.R.1381], H.R. 1381, Keeping All Students Safe Act, April 6, 2011.

==Description of the Keeping All Students Safe Act==
This section of the article focuses on the two newest bills introduced in the 112th Congress in 2011.  The House and Senate versions of the Keeping All Students Safe Act differ.

The House bill prohibits physical restraint except in emergencies when there is an imminent threat of physical injury and less restrictive measures will not resolve the situation.  The Senate bill bars physical restraint unless there is an immediate threat of serious bodily injury and less restrictive measures will not solve the situation.  Both bills would forbid the use of restraint or seclusion for destruction of property, educational disruption, failing to follow instructions, and for coercion, discipline, or in place of proper educational planning.  
 
The House bill also forbids seclusion unless there is an immediate threat of physical injury and less restrictive methods will not resolve the situation.  The House bill will require staff to continuously visually monitor (watch) children who are confined to seclusion rooms to ensure that they are safe.  The Senate bill bans all seclusion of children, which is defined as locking children in rooms or other spaces or blocking the door so they cannot leave (e.g., with furniture).&lt;ref name="S.2020 sec 4"&gt;[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d112:s.2020: S.2020 sec 4] Keeping All Students Safe Act, sec. 4, S.2020, U.S. Senate, Dec. 16, 2011.  Retrieved March 11, 2012, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="H.R.1381 sec 5"&gt;[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d112:h.r.1381:  H.R.1381 sec 5], Keeping All Students Safe Act, sec. 5, H.R. 1381, April 6, 2011.  Retrieved March 11, 2012, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Both bills require restraint to end when the emergency ends, and the House bill requires seclusion to end when the emergency ends. Both bills ban the use of mechanical restraints, meaning devices that lock and restrain children, or taping or tying them to chairs or furniture.  Both bills ban chemical restraints and restraints that impair breathing or otherwise threaten life.&lt;ref name="S.2020 sec 4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="H.R.1381 sec 5"/&gt;

Both bills require schools to notify parents in writing within 24 hours of restraint and verbally the same day.&lt;ref name="S.2020 sec 4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="H.R.1381 sec 5"/&gt;   There are 27 states that do not have legal requirements for schools to tell parents a child was restrained/secluded.&lt;ref name="HowSafe" /&gt;

Both bills impose training requirements to ensure that staff who use restraint and seclusion are trained in evidence-based techniques and that the techniques are not misused in even more dangerous manners.  Both bills prohibit putting physical restraint as a planned intervention in Individual Education Programs, 504 plans, behavioral intervention plans, student safety plans, or other educational planning documents for individual students.  The bills also require the collection of data nationwide and disaggregating the data by such categories as race, sex, income, and disability status.&lt;ref name="S.2020 sec 4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="H.R.1381 sec 5"/&gt;

The Senate bill also bans restraints that interfere with the ability to communicate.&lt;ref name="S.2020 sec 4"/&gt;  The GAO reported on at least four cases in which verbal children who died or were injured in restraint told staff that they could not breathe.&lt;ref name="GAO1" /&gt;  Numerous children cannot speak or have difficulty doing so, and rely on sign language or augmentative communications devices.&lt;ref name="HowSafe" /&gt;   Additionally, the Senate bill requires that a debriefing be held, where school staff, the parents, and the student may attend.&lt;ref name="S.2020 sec 4"/&gt;  Debriefings are intended to reduce and eliminate restraint and seclusion, by determining what caused the event and how to avoid it in the future, and by analyzing, planning for, and implementing positive interventions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=2001_register&amp;docid=01-1649-filed.pdf  Federal Register], Medicaid Program; Use of Restraint and Seclusion in Psychiatric Residential Treatment Facilities Providing Psychiatric Services to Individuals Under Age 21; Interim Final Rule, 66 Fed. Reg. 7148, Jan. 22, 2001.  Retrieved March 11, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statement of Congressman Miller on Introduction==

When Congressman Miller re-introduced the House bill in 2011, he described his reasons for doing so, “In 2009, the Government Accountability Office told our committee of the shocking wave of abuse by untrained school staff who were misusing emergency interventions. Most of these victims were children with disabilities. Some were 3 and 4 years old. In some cases, children died. Restraint and seclusion should be used only as a last resort and by trained professionals, but the GAO found that was not the case. . . . A media report out yesterday highlights that these horrific abuses continued through this past year. In Chicago, a 4-year-old boy’s wrists were taped together with painter’s tape and then duct tape because he refused to take a nap and he didn’t wash his hands.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2011-04-07/pdf/CREC-2011-04-07-pt1-PgH2413-7.pdf#page=1  Congressional Record House], Congressman George Miller, Congressional Record, April 6, 2011. Retrieved  Feb. 18, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statement of Senator Harkin on Introduction==
Senator Harkin introduced his bill and explained the reasons for doing so.  He said, “I am pleased to introduce today the Keeping All Students Safe Act. This important legislation will protect school children against ineffective harmful and life threatening seclusion and restraint practices.  . . . Restraint and seclusion-related fatalities and injuries most often involve children with disabilities. This vulnerable population must especially be protected from this type of abuse, and this legislation seeks to do just that.  . . .The act does allow for the use of restraint in emergency situations to prevent serious bodily injury to the student, other students in the classroom, or staff, it also requires State-approved crisis intervention training program as to how to approach these types of emergency situations.”&lt;ref name="CRHarkin"&gt;[http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2011-12-16/pdf/CREC-2011-12-16-pt1-PgS8735.pdf  Congressional Record Senate], Senator Tom Harkin, Congressional Record, Dec. 16, 2011. Retrieved  Feb. 18, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Senator Harkin also addressed data issues, “Another issue uncovered by the GAO study was that no web site, Federal agency, or other entity currently collects comprehensive data related to the use of restraint and seclusion in our Nation's schools. This Act will remedy this situation, as it requires each State educational agency to prepare and submit a report documenting” the use of restraint and seclusion.”&lt;ref name="CRHarkin" /&gt;

==Related Events==
In March 2012, the Office of Civil Rights of the United States Department of Education presented a report about its Civil Rights Data Collection.  It reported that students with disabilities made up  represent 12% of students in its data collection sample, but nearly 70% of the students who are physically restrained by adults in school.  For those schools which reported data, there was a total of 38, 792 incidents of physical restraint.  CRDC also found racial and ethnic disproportionality in restraint and seclusion use.  African-American students were 21% of students with disabilities under served under the IDEA, but 44% of students with disabilities subjected to mechanical restraint.  Hispanic children were disproportionately subjected to seclusion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/crdc-2012-data-summary.pdf  CRDC Data Collection] Dept. of Education, Office of Civil Rights, Civil Rights Data Collection, Revealing New Truths About Our Nation’s Schools, March 2012.

[[File:Treny normal.jpg|thumb|right|[[Jan Kochanowski]] with dead daughter in painting inspired by the poet's ''[[Laments (Treny)|Laments]]'']]

A '''lament''' or '''lamentation''' is a passionate expression of [[grief]], often in [[music]], [[poetry]], or [[song]] form. The grief is most often born of [[regret]], or [[mourning]]. Laments can also be expressed in a verbal manner, where the participant would lament about something they regret or someone they've lost, usually accompanied by wailing, [[Complaint|moaning]] and/or [[crying]].&lt;ref&gt;Piotr Michalowski, trans., Lamentation over the Destruction of Sumer and Ur (Winona Lake, Ind.: Eisenbrauns, 1989), 39–62; cited in Nancy Lee, Lyrics of Lament: From Tragedy to Transformation (Minneapolis: Augsburg Fortress, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Laments constitute some of the oldest forms of writing and examples are present across human cultures.  

==History==
[[File:Egyptian mourners001.jpg|thumb|150px|Egyptian women weeping and lamenting.]]
Many of the oldest and most lasting poems in human [[history]] have been laments.&lt;ref&gt;Linda M. Austin, "The Lament and the Rhetoric of the Sublime" ''Nineteenth-Century Literature'' '''53'''.3 (December 1998:279-306) traces the literary rhetoric  evoking a voice crying.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Lament for Sumer and Ur]] dates back at least 4000 years to ancient [[Sumer]], the world's first urban civilization. Laments are present in both the ''[[Iliad]]'' and the ''[[Odyssey]]'', and laments continued to be sung in [[elegiacs]] accompanied by the [[aulos]] in classical and [[Hellenistic]] Greece.&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Alexiou, ''Ritual Lament in Greek Tradition'' (Cambridge University Press) 1974&lt;/ref&gt; Elements of laments appear in ''[[Beowulf]]'', in the [[Hindu]] [[Veda]]s, and in [[ancient Near Eastern]] religious texts. They are included in the Mesopotamian city laments such as the [[Lament for Ur]] and the [[Jew]]ish [[Tanakh]], (which would later become the [[Christian]] [[Old Testament]]).

In many oral traditions, both early and modern, the lament has been a genre usually performed by women:&lt;ref&gt;Alexiou 1974; Angela Bourke, "More in anger than in sorrow: Irish women's lament poetry", in Joan Newlon Radnor, ed., ''Feminist Messages: Coding in Women's Folk Culture'' (Urbana: Illinois University Press) 1993:160-82.&lt;/ref&gt; Batya Weinbaum made a case for the spontaneous lament of women chanters in the creation of the oral tradition that resulted in the ''[[Iliad]]''&lt;ref&gt;Batya Weinbaum, "Lament Ritual Transformed into Literature: Positing Women's Prayer as Cornerstone in Western Classical Literature" ''The Journal of American Folklore'' '''114''' No. 451 (Winter 2001:20-39).&lt;/ref&gt; The material of lament, the "sound of trauma" is as much an element in the [[Book of Job]] as in the genre of [[pastoral elegy]], such as [[Percy Bysshe Shelley|Shelley]]'s "Adonais" or [[Matthew Arnold]]'s "Thyrsis".&lt;ref&gt;Austin 1998:280f.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Book of Lamentations]] or ''Lamentations of Jeremiah'' figures in the Old Testament. The ''[[Lamentation of Christ]]'' (under many closely variant terms) is a common subject from the [[Life of Christ in art|''Life of Christ'' in art]], showing his dead body being mourned after the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Crucifixion]].

A Lament in The Book of Lamentations or in the [[Psalms]] (in the particular Lament/Complaint Psalms of the [[Tanakh]], may be looked at as "a cry of need in a context of crisis when Israel lacks the resources to fend for itself."&lt;ref&gt;Walter Brueggeman, ''An Unsettling God'', (Minneapolis: Fortress Press, 2009) 13&lt;/ref&gt; Another way of looking at it is all the more basic: laments simply being "appeals for divine help in distress".&lt;ref&gt;Michael D. Coogan, ''A Brief Introduction to the Old Testament'', (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2009) 370&lt;/ref&gt; These laments, too, often have a set format: an address to God, description of the suffering/anguish which one seeks relief, a petition for help and deliverance, a curse towards one's enemies, an expression of the belief of ones innocence or a confession of the lack thereof, a vow corresponding to an expected divine response, and lastly, a song of thanksgiving.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Coogan, ''A Brief Introduction to the Old Testament'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2009) 370&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of a general format of this, both in the individual and communal laments, can be seen in Psalm 3 and Psalm 44 respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Coogan, ''A Brief Introduction to the Old Testament,'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2009) 370&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Lament of Edward II]]'', if it is actually written by [[Edward II of England]], is the sole surviving composition of his.

A heroine's lament is a conventional fixture of [[Baroque opera|baroque]] [[opera seria]], accompanied usually by strings alone, in [[descending tetrachord]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Ellen Rosand, 2007. ''Opera in Seventeenth-Century Venice'' (University of California Press),  "The lament aria: variations on a theme" pp 377ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of their plangent cantabile melodic lines, evocatively free, non-[[strophic]] construction and [[Tempo#Basic tempo markings|adagio]] pace, operatic laments have remained vividly memorable soprano or mezzo-soprano [[aria]]s even when separated from the emotional pathos of their operatic contexts. An early example is Ariadne's "Lasciatemi morire", which is the only survivor of [[Claudio Monteverdi]]'s lost ''Arianna''. [[Francesco Cavalli]]'s operas extended the ''lamento'' formula, in numerous exemplars, of which Ciro's "Negatemi respiri" from ''Ciro'' is notable.&lt;ref&gt;"Negatemi respiri" and several others are noted by Rosand 2007:377f.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other examples include [[Dido's Lament|Dido's lament, "When I am laid"]] ([[Henry Purcell]], ''[[Dido and Aeneas]]''), "[[Lascia ch'io pianga]]" ([[Georg Friedrich Handel]], ''[[Rinaldo (opera)|Rinaldo]]''), "Caro mio ben" (Tomasso or [[Giuseppe Giordani]]). The lament continued to represent a musico-dramatic high point. In the context of [[opera buffa]], the Countess's lament, "Dove sono" comes as a surprise to the audience of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]]'s ''[[Marriage of Figaro]]'', and in [[Gioachino Rossini]]'s ''[[Barber of Seville]]'', Rosina's plaintive words at her apparent abandonment are followed, not by the expected lament aria, but by a vivid orchestral interlude of storm music. The heroine's lament remained a fixture in romantic opera, and the Marschallin's monologue in Act I of ''[[Der Rosenkavalier]]'' can be understood as a penetrating psychological lament.&lt;ref&gt;Called "the Marschallin's Act I lament", in Jeremy Eichler, "Lushly Lamenting the Wages of Time and a Lost Golden Age" opera review in ''The New York Times'' March 15, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scottish laments==
The purely instrumental lament is a common form in [[pìobaireachd]] music for the [[Great Highland Bagpipe|Scottish bagpipes]]. "MacCrimmon's Lament" dates to the Jacobite uprising of 1745. The tune is held to have been written by Donald Ban MacCrimmon, piper to the MacLeods of Dunvegan, who supported the Hanoverians. It is said that Donald Ban, who was killed at Moy in 1746, had an intimation that he would not return.{{clarify|date=April 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.educationscotland.gov.uk/scotlandssongs/secondary/genericcontent_tcm4572872.asp "MacCrimmon's Lament", Foghlam Alba] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131006063418/http://www.educationscotland.gov.uk/scotlandssongs/secondary/genericcontent_tcm4572872.asp |date=2013-10-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A well-known Gaelic [[lullaby]] is "[[Griogal Cridhe]]" ("Beloved Gregor"). It was composed in 1570 after the execution of Gregor MacGregor by the Campbells. The grief-stricken widow, Marion Campbell, describes what happened as she sings to her child.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.educationscotland.gov.uk/scotlandssongs/about/songs/lullabiesdandlings/index.asp "Lullabies and Dandlings", Foghlam Alba] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004070706/http://www.educationscotland.gov.uk/scotlandssongs/about/songs/lullabiesdandlings/index.asp |date=2013-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Cumhadh na Cloinne" (Lament for the Children) was composed by Padruig Mór MacCrimmon in the early 1650s. It is generally held to be based on the loss of seven of MacCrimmon's eight sons to an unknown illness, possibly brought to Skye by a trading vessel. Author Bridget MacKenzie, in ''Piping Traditions of Argyll'', suggests that it refers to the slaughter of the MacLeod's fighting Cromwell's forces at the Battle of Worcester. It may have been inspired by both.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.educationscotland.gov.uk/scotlandssongs/about/songs/pibroch/index.asp "Pibroch songs and canntaireachd", Education Scotland] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004070629/http://www.educationscotland.gov.uk/scotlandssongs/about/songs/pibroch/index.asp |date=2013-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other Scottish laments include "Lowlands Away"{{fact|date=April 2017}}, "MacPherson's Rant", and "Hector the Hero".

==Musical form==
There is a short, free musical form appearing in the Baroque and then again in the Romantic periods, called a [[Lament bass|lament]].  It is typically a set of harmonic [[Variation (music)|variations]] in [[Homophony|homophonic]] texture, wherein the bass descends through a tetrachord, usually one suggesting a [[Minor scale|minor mode]].

'''Lavinia Lloyd Dock''' (February 26, 1858 – April 17, 1956)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asu.edu/nursing/courses/nur361/leader07/bio.html Biography of Lavinia Lloyd Dock] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120819221824/http://www.asu.edu/nursing/courses/nur361/leader07/bio.html |date=2012-08-19 }}. asu.edu&lt;/ref&gt; was a nurse, feminist, author, pioneer in nursing education and social activist.&lt;ref name="sueb"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Philips |first=Deborah |title=Healthy Heroines: Sue Barton, Lillian Wald, Lavinia Lloyd Dock and the Henry Street Settlement |journal=Journal of American Studies |volume=33 |issue=1 |pages=65–82 |year=1999|doi=10.1017/S0021875898006070 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dock was an assistant superintendent at [[Johns Hopkins School of Nursing]] under [[Isabel Hampton Robb]]. With Robb and [[Mary Adelaide Nutting]], she helped to found the organization that would become the [[National League for Nursing]]. Dock was a contributing editor to the ''American Journal of Nursing'' and she authored several books, including (with M. Adelaide Nutting as co-author) a four-volume history of nursing and what was for many years a standard nurse's manual of drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{worldcat|oclc=2960535|name=Text-book of Materia Medica for Nurses}}&lt;/ref&gt; She campaigned for women's rights for many years.

==Early life and career==
Lavinia Dock was born one of six children in [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania]] on February 26, 1858. She received nursing training at the [[Bellevue Hospital School of Nursing]], graduating in 1886. By 1888, Dock was working with [[Jane Delano]] at a Florida hospital during a yellow fever outbreak.&lt;ref name=Grave&gt;{{cite web|title=Lavinia Lloyd Dock 1858 - 1956|url=http://www.aahn.org/gravesites/dock.html|publisher=American Association for the History of Nursing, Inc.|accessdate=February 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Delano was a young nurse who later founded the [[American Red Cross Nursing Service]]. Dock wrote and published (with help from her father and brother) a book on therapeutic medicines in 1890.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Biographical Dictionary of Women in Science|last = Ogilvie|first = Marilyn|publisher = Routledge|year = 2000|isbn = 0-415-92038-8|location = |page=362}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Leadership==
Dock went to [[Johns Hopkins School of Nursing]] in 1890, where she was assistant superintendent of the school under [[Isabel Hampton Robb]].&lt;ref name=Grave/&gt; In 1893, Dock, with the assistance of Robb and [[Mary Adelaide Nutting]], founded the American Society of superintendents of Training Schools for Nurses of the United States and Canada, which became the [[National League for Nursing]].

==Later life==
After her retirement from nursing, her activities included membership in the [[National Woman's Party]], led by [[Alice Paul]]. Dock campaigned for woman suffrage by leading several protests, including pickets at the White House; she was arrested after militant demonstrations in June 1917, August 1917 and August 1918.&lt;ref name=Grave/&gt; She participated in protest movements for women's rights that resulted in the 1920 passage of the 19th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which granted women the right to vote. In addition, she campaigned for legislation to allow nurses rather than physicians to control their profession.

Dock died on April 17, 1956, after suffering a broken hip in a fall.&lt;ref name=Grave/&gt;

==Legacy==
The American Association for the History of Nursing has named an award in honor of Dock. The Lavinia L.

'''Missionary kids''' (or '''MKs''') are the children of [[missionary]] parents, and thus born and/or raised abroad (that is, on the "mission-field"). They form a subset of [[third culture kids]] (TCKs). The term is more specifically applied when these children return to their "home" or passport country (the country of their citizenship), and often experience various difficulties identifying with fellow citizens and integrating "back" into their "home" culture. The resulting feeling is described as "reverse [[culture shock]]".

There is some confusion between the terms MK and TCK. According to the definition developed by [[Ruth Hill Useem]], TCKs are people who have spent a significant part of their developmental years outside their parents' culture.&lt;ref&gt;''Third Culture Kids'', pp. 21–23&lt;/ref&gt; TCK is a broad term that encompasses all children who have grown up abroad (i.e. military kids, diplomats' kids, immigrants). Missionary kids are just one of the many categories of kids who qualify as TCKs. Therefore, while all MKs are TCKs, not all TCKs are MKs.

In the past MKs usually were thought of{{by whom|date=September 2014}} only as American or European, but there is {{as of | 2014 | lc = on}} a growing number of MKs from other countries, especially Protestant Christian MKs from [[South Korea]]&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.intervarsity.org/ism/article/346 Increase of non-Western missionaries] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060529025134/http://www.intervarsity.org/ism/article/346 |date=2006-05-29 }}&amp;nbsp;— by InterVarsity Christian Fellowship/USA. (accessed 2007-04-04).
&lt;/ref&gt; and from [[Latin America]]. Generally, this term applies to [[Protestantism|Protestant]] [[Christians]];{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}; however, it can be applied to any [[Religious denomination|denomination]] of a religion.

==Definition==

===Life overseas===
While MKs often identify more with the culture or country where they were raised (and this could be multiple cities, countries, or continents) than with where their parents were raised, they are not fully at home in any one culture. [[David C. Pollock]] and Van Reken attribute this feeling of displacement, or rootlessness, to a lack of emotional connection to their home culture (where they "should" feel connected).&lt;ref&gt;''Third Culture Kids'', pp. 123&lt;/ref&gt; Many MKs find it difficult to answer questions about where they are from or where home is as they may feel more of an emotional connection to their host culture than to their "home" culture. However, at the same time many MKs are completely aware that they can never fully fit into their host culture. This is especially obvious to MKs growing up in countries where they look different from the local population. Pollock and Van Reken developed the PolVan Cultural Identity Model to explain cultural identity in relationship to the surrounding culture. The Model names four categories into which a person can fall based on how they look and think compared to the culture around them:&lt;ref&gt;''Third Culture Kids'' pp. 54–56&lt;/ref&gt;
;Foreigner : look ''different'', think ''different''
;Adopted : look ''different'', think ''alike''
;Hidden Immigrant : look ''alike'', think ''different''
;Mirror : look ''alike'', think ''alike''

When MKs first transition to their new or "host" culture, they are in the foreigner category. As they continue the transition and begin to acclimate and feel at home in their host culture, MKs move into the adopted category, often to the point where MKs feel more at home in the host culture than in their passport culture. At this point, the host culture becomes the MK's home culture. Upon returning to their passport culture, MKs often find themselves in the hidden immigrant category. Because they look like their peers, their extended family remembers how they were prior to their international move and expect them to hold similar views and to act as a typical citizen of that passport country would act. However, as hidden immigrants, MKs look like their family and friends, but more often than not hold many differing views and opinions. Additionally, MKs may not be aware of many of the pop culture influences within their passport country, yet are aware of world and regional issues, which most citizens of their passport country are unaware of. This cultural disconnect can cause awkwardness when they return to their passport country.&lt;ref&gt;*Klemens &amp; Bikos, p. 721&lt;/ref&gt;

Children in the MKs' passport countries often find it difficult to relate to missionary children, and vice versa. While MKs may find the lives of their peers in their passport countries to be boring, sometimes creating challenging social situations, passport country kids may be intimidated by MKs' experience abroad. Cultural miscommunications are common and interesting. While MKs often find it difficult to relate to people from their home culture or target culture, they get along with other MKs very well, even those who are missionaries to (or from) a completely different country. It is the commonality of differences that draws MKs together.

MKs tend to be open-minded and tolerant of many diverse cultures. They often feel more at home in culturally rich environments and can be "homesick" for their foreign home. Their knowledge of a country and its culture typically exceeds language fluency. Upon returning to their passport country, MKs possess unique skills that can be helpful to academics and governments. Because of their international experience, they often have a much broader worldview than their peers. This broader worldview can also lead to mixed emotions about their passport country and its foreign policies.

===Return to passport country===
Children who immigrate to the United States have similar experience to MKs when it comes to learning a new culture and making cross-cultural transitions. But according to Pollack and Van Reken, what truly distinguishes MKs from children who immigrate to the United States or other countries is "the full expectation that after living for a significant period of their developmental years outside their passport culture, there will  come the day when TCKs make a permanent return to that country and culture."&lt;ref&gt;''Third Culture Kids'' p 225&lt;/ref&gt; MKs return to their passport country for many reasons, including the beginning of their college education, a shift in their parents' career, and even evacuation in more extreme cases. Extended family and friends's excitement at MKs' return does not usually carry over to the MK. The events surrounding an MK's return may be traumatic (such as in the event of an evacuation due to political unrest), but even under normal circumstances MKs' return to their country of citizenship is a cause of stress and grief. Anxiety and depressions are the two emotions most commonly associated with cross-cultural transitions, caused by a sense of vulnerability and loss of control.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Headley, et al. p 187&lt;/ref&gt;

To help MKs cope with the transition back to the United States, many colleges, particularly Christian colleges, have chapters of a student organization called "Mu Kappa International".&lt;ref&gt;[http://mukappa.org Mu Kappa International website]&lt;/ref&gt; Mu Kappa aims to help MKs and other TCKs with the transition to American culture and college life. Mu Kappa was founded in 1985 at [[Taylor University]], and has since spread to more than forty other American colleges and universities.

Another frequently used method of helping MKs cope with transitioning from their foreign home to their passport culture is through transition seminars. These seminars typically take place during the summer before an MK's freshman year of college and teach MKs the basics of everyday life in America, including putting gas in a car, opening a bank account, grocery shopping, and many other every day tasks.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Headley, et al. p. 188&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, these seminar can help MKs understand how to deal with the grief of permanently transitioning back to their passport country in a healthy way, and how to manage the stress of a new environment and reverse culture shock.

'''The Offences against the Person Act 1875''' (38 &amp; 39 Vict. c. 94) was an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] (as it then was). Its purpose was to extend the scope of sexual offences against children.

==Section 2==
This section repealed sections 50 and 51 of the [[Offences against the Person Act 1861]] with savings.

==Section 3 - Abusing a girl under 12==
This section replaced section 50 of the [[Offences against the Person Act 1861]] (which created a felony in relation only to girls under 10).

When the Act was repealed, it was in turn replaced by section 4 of the [[Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885]] (increasing the age to 13).

==Section 4 - Abusing a girl between 12 and 13==
This section replaced section 51 of the [[Offences against the Person Act 1861]] (which created a misdemeanour in relation to girls between 10 and 12).

When the Act was repealed, it was turn replaced by section 5(1) of the [[Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885]] (changing the age range to 13 to 16).

==Section 5==
This section provided that the Act was to be construed as though it and the [[Offences against the Person Act 1861]] (as amended by this Act) were one Act. Its effect was that the definition of [[carnal knowledge]] provided by section 63 of that Act applied to the offences created by sections 3 and 4 of this Act.

==Section 6 - Extent==
This section provided that the Act did not extend to Scotland.

      <comment>Disambiguated: [[quadratic]] → [[quadratic function]] – just copying what was done for [[Ellipsoidal coordinates]] ([[WP:DPL|you can help]])</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4926">'''Paraboloidal coordinates''' are a three-dimensional [[orthogonal coordinates|orthogonal]] [[coordinate system]] &lt;math&gt;(\lambda, \mu, \nu)&lt;/math&gt; that generalizes the two-dimensional [[parabolic coordinates|parabolic coordinate system]].  Similar to the related [[ellipsoidal coordinates]], the paraboloidal coordinate system has [[orthogonal coordinates|orthogonal]] [[quadratic function|quadratic]] [[coordinate surfaces]] that are ''not'' produced by rotating or projecting any two-dimensional orthogonal coordinate system.

[[File:Parabolic coordinates 3D.png|thumb|right|300px|[[Coordinate surfaces]] of the three-dimensional paraboloidal coordinates.]]

==Basic formulae==

The Cartesian coordinates &lt;math&gt;(x, y, z)&lt;/math&gt; can be produced from the ellipsoidal coordinates 
&lt;math&gt;( \lambda, \mu, \nu )&lt;/math&gt; by the equations

:&lt;math&gt;
x^{2} = \frac{\left( A - \lambda \right) \left( A - \mu \right) \left( A - \nu \right)}{B - A}
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
y^{2} = \frac{\left( B - \lambda \right) \left( B - \mu \right) \left( B - \nu \right)}{A - B}
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
z = 
\frac{1}{2} \left( A + B - \lambda - \mu -\nu \right)
&lt;/math&gt;

where the following limits apply to the coordinates

:&lt;math&gt;
\lambda &lt; B &lt; \mu &lt; A &lt; \nu
&lt;/math&gt;

Consequently, surfaces of constant &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; are elliptic [[paraboloid]]s

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{x^{2}}{\lambda - A} +  \frac{y^{2}}{\lambda - B}  = 2z + \lambda
&lt;/math&gt;

and surfaces of constant &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; are likewise

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{x^{2}}{\nu - A} +  \frac{y^{2}}{\nu - B}  = 2z + \nu
&lt;/math&gt;

whereas surfaces of constant &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; are hyperbolic [[paraboloid]]s

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{x^{2}}{\mu - A} +  \frac{y^{2}}{\mu - B} = 2z + \mu 
&lt;/math&gt;

==Scale factors==

The scale factors for the paraboloidal coordinates &lt;math&gt;(\lambda, \mu, \nu )&lt;/math&gt; are
 
:&lt;math&gt;
h_{\lambda} = \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{\frac{\left( \mu - \lambda \right) \left( \nu - \lambda \right)}{ \left( A - \lambda \right) \left( B - \lambda \right)}}
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
h_{\mu} = \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{\frac{\left( \nu - \mu \right) \left( \lambda - \mu \right)}{ \left( A - \mu \right) \left( B - \mu \right)}}
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
h_{\nu} = \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{\frac{\left( \lambda - \nu \right) \left( \mu - \nu \right)}{ \left( A - \nu \right) \left( B - \nu \right)}}
&lt;/math&gt;

Hence, the infinitesimal volume element equals

:&lt;math&gt;
dV = \frac{\left( \mu - \lambda \right) \left( \nu - \lambda \right) \left( \nu - \mu\right)}{8\sqrt{\left( A - \lambda \right) \left( B - \lambda \right) \left( A - \mu \right) \left( \mu - B \right) \left( \nu - A \right) \left( \nu  - B \right) }} \  d\lambda d\mu d\nu
&lt;/math&gt;

Differential operators such as &lt;math&gt;\nabla \cdot \mathbf{F}&lt;/math&gt; 
and &lt;math&gt;\nabla \times \mathbf{F}&lt;/math&gt; can be expressed in the coordinates &lt;math&gt;(\lambda, \mu, \nu)&lt;/math&gt; by substituting the scale factors into the general formulae found in [[orthogonal coordinates]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2106">A '''perceptual system''' is a computational system (biological or artificial) designed to make [[inference]]s about properties of a [[physical environment]] based on [[Scene (perception)|scenes]]. Other definitions may exist.

In this context, a scene is defined as [[information]] that can flow from a physical rectums into a computational system via [[Transduction (physiology)|sensory transduction]]. A [[sensory organ]] (biological or artificial) is used to capture this information. Therefore, any perceptual system must incorporate input from at least one [[sensory organ]].

Examples of perceptual systems include:
* The [[visual system]]
* The [[auditory system]]
* The [[olfactory system]]
* The [[somatosensory system]]
* A [[bat]]'s [[sonar]]/[[Animal echolocation|echolocation]] system
* A man-made [[light meter]]
* A man-made [[motion detector]]

Research in the field of perceptual systems focuses on computational aspects of [[perception]]. For this reason, there is significant overlap with [[neuroscience]], [[sensor]] design, [[natural scene statistics]],&lt;ref&gt;Lewicki, Michael S.

The '''philosophy of self''' defines, among other things, the conditions of identity that make one subject of experience distinct from all others. Contemporary discussions on the nature of the [[self]] are not thereby discussions on the nature of personhood, or personal identity. The self is sometimes understood as a unified being essentially connected to consciousness, awareness, and agency (or, at least, with the faculty of rational choice). Various theories on the metaphysical nature of the self have been proposed. Among them, the metaphysical nature of the self has been proposed to be that of an immaterial substance.

== Definitions of the self ==
Most philosophical definitions of self—per [[René Descartes|Descartes]], [[John Locke|Locke]], [[David Hume|Hume]], and [[William James]]—are expressed in the first person.&lt;ref&gt;Gaynesford, M. de ''I: The Meaning of the First Person Term'', Oxford, Oxford University Press, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; A third person definition does not refer to specific mental [[Quale|qualia]] but instead strives for [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objectivity]] and [[operationalism]].

To another person, the self of one [[Individual Philosophy|individual]] is exhibited in the conduct and discourse of that individual. Therefore, the [[intention]]s of another individual can only be inferred from something that emanates from that individual. The particular characteristics of the self determine its [[identity (social science)|identity]].

== Concepts of self ==

=== Self in Eastern traditions ===
In [[spirituality]], and especially [[nondual]], [[mysticism|mystical]] and eastern [[meditation|meditative]] traditions, the human being is often conceived as being in the illusion of individual existence, and separateness from other aspects of creation. This "sense of doership" or sense of individual existence is that part which believes it is the human being, and believes it must fight for itself in the world, is ultimately [[self-awareness|unaware]] and [[unconsciousness|unconscious]] of its own true nature. The [[ego, super-ego, and id|ego]] is often associated with [[mind]] and the sense of [[time]], which compulsively [[thinking|thinks]] in order to be assured of its future existence, rather than simply knowing its own self and the present.

The spiritual goal of many [[tradition]]s involves the dissolving of the ego, allowing self-knowledge of one's own true nature to become experienced and enacted in the world. This is variously known as [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]], [[nirvana]], presence, and the "here and now".

=== Self-knowledge ===
{{Expand section|date=January 2007}}
Both western and oriental civilizations have been occupied with self-knowledge and underscored its importance particularly citing the paradoxical combination of immediate availability and profound obscurity involved in its pursuit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Self Knowledge in Thomas Aquinas: The Angelic Doctor on the Soul's Knowledge of Itself|last=Lambert|first=Richard|publisher=Author House|year=2007|isbn=9781420889659|location=Bloomington, IN|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Socrates, the goal of philosophy was to "[[Know thyself]]".

A theory about self-knowledge describes the concept as the capacity to detect that the sensations, thoughts, mental states, and attitudes as one's own.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Self-Knowledge|last=Gertler|first=Brie|publisher=Routledge|year=2011|isbn=0203835670|location=Oxon|pages=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is linked to other concepts such as [[self-awareness]] and self-conception. The rationalist theory, which [[Immanuel Kant]] has inspired, also claims that our ability to achieve self-knowledge through rational reflection is partly derived from the fact that we view ourselves as rational agents.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This school rejects that self-knowledge is merely derived from [[observation]] as it acknowledges the subject as authoritative on account of his ability as an agent to shape his own states.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Kant and the Problem of Self-Knowledge|last=Gorgione|first=Luca|publisher=Routledge|year=2018|isbn=9781138385467|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Self as an activity ===

[[Aristotle]], following [[Plato]], defined the [[soul]] as the core [[essence]] of a living being, but argued against its having a separate existence. For instance, if a knife had a soul, the act of cutting would be that soul, because 'cutting' is the essence of what it is to be a knife. Unlike Plato and the religious traditions, Aristotle did not consider the soul as some kind of separate, ghostly occupant of the body (just as we cannot separate the activity of cutting from the knife). As the soul, in Aristotle's view, is an activity of the body, it cannot be immortal (when a knife is destroyed, the cutting stops). More precisely, the soul is the "first activity" of a living body. This is a state, or a potential for actual, or 'second', activity. "The axe has an edge for cutting" was, for Aristotle, analogous to "humans have bodies for rational activity," and the potential for rational activity thus constituted the essence of a human soul. Aristotle used his concept of the soul in many of his works; the ''[[De Anima]]'' (On the Soul) provides a good place to start to gain more understanding of his views.

[[Aristotle]] also believed that there were four sections of the soul: the calculative and scientific parts on the rational side used for making decisions, and the desiderative and vegetative parts on the irrational side responsible for identifying our needs.

=== Self independent of the senses ===
{{main|Avicennism}}

While he was imprisoned in a castle, [[Avicenna]] wrote his famous "[[Floating man|Floating Man]]" [[thought experiment]] to demonstrate human [[self-awareness]] and the substantiality of the [[soul]]. His "Floating Man" thought experiment tells its readers to imagine themselves suspended in the air, isolated from all sensations, which includes no [[Sense|sensory]] contact with even their own bodies. He argues that, in this scenario, one would still have [[self-consciousness]]. He thus concludes that the idea of the self is not [[Logic in Islamic philosophy|logically]] dependent on any physical [[Object (philosophy)|thing]], and that the soul should not be seen in [[relative term]]s, but as a primary [[:wikt:given|given]], a [[Substance theory|substance]]. This argument was later refined and simplified by [[René Descartes]] in [[epistemic]] terms when he stated: "I can abstract from the supposition of all external things, but not from the supposition of my own consciousness."&lt;ref&gt;Seyyed [[Hossein Nasr]] and [[Oliver Leaman]] (1996), ''History of Islamic Philosophy'', p. 315, [[Routledge]], {{ISBN|0-415-13159-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bundle theory of self ===

[[David Hume]] pointed out that we tend to think that we are the same person we were five years ago. Though we have changed in many respects, the same person appears present as was present then. We might start thinking about which features can be changed without changing the underlying self. Hume, however, denies that there is a distinction between the various features of a person and the mysterious self that supposedly bears those features. When we start introspecting, "we are never intimately conscious of anything but a particular perception; man is a bundle or collection of different perceptions which succeed one another with an inconceivable rapidity and are in perpetual flux and movement".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hume|first=David|title=[[A Treatise of Human Nature]]}} I, IV, vi&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is plain, that in the course of our thinking, and in the constant revolution of our ideas, our imagination runs easily from one idea to any other that resembles it, and that this quality alone is to the fancy a sufficient bond and association. It is likewise evident that as the senses, in changing their objects, are necessitated to change them regularly, and take them as they lie contiguous to each other, the imagination must by long custom acquire the same method of thinking, and run along the parts of space and time in conceiving its objects."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hume|first=David|title=[[A Treatise of Human Nature]]}} 4.1, 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On Hume's view, these perceptions do not belong to anything. Rather, Hume compares the soul to a commonwealth, which retains its identity not by virtue of some enduring core substance, but by being composed of many different, related, and yet constantly changing elements. The question of personal identity then becomes a matter of characterizing the loose cohesion of one's personal experience. (Note that in the Appendix to the ''Treatise'', Hume said mysteriously that he was dissatisfied with his account of the self, yet he never returned to the issue.) Hume’s position is very similar to Indian Buddhists’ conception of the self.

The paradox of the [[Ship of Theseus]] can be used as an analogy of the self as a bundle of parts in flux.

=== Self as a narrative center of gravity ===

Daniel Dennett has a deflationary theory of the "self". Selves are not physically detectable. Instead, they are a kind of [[Fictionalism|convenient fiction]], like a [[center of gravity]], which is convenient as a way of solving physics problems, although they need not correspond to anything tangible — the center of gravity of a hoop is a point in thin air. People constantly tell themselves stories to make sense of their world, and they feature in the stories as a character, and that convenient but fictional character is the self.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cogprints.org/266/1/selfctr.htm|title=The Self as a Center of Narrative Gravity|last=Dennett|first=Daniel|year=1986|accessdate=2015-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oswego.edu/~delancey/471_DIR/471_LECTURES/DennettSelf.html|title=The Self as a Centre of Narrative Gravity|last=Dennett|first=Daniel|publisher=State University of New York|accessdate=2016-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Buddha===

{{main|Anatta}}

The [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] in particular [[Anatta|attacked]] all attempts to conceive of a fixed self, while stating that holding the view "I have no self" is also mistaken. This is an example of the [[middle way]] charted by the Buddha and the [[Madhyamaka]] school of Buddhism.

A '''Propulsive Fluid Accumulator''' is an artificial Earth [[satellite]] which collects and stores oxygen and other [[atmospheric gases]] for in-situ refuelling of high-thrust rockets. This eliminates the need to lift oxidizer to orbit and therefore brings significant cost benefits.  A major portion of the total world payload sent into low earth orbit each year is either liquid oxygen or water.

== Propulsive Fluid Accumulator (PROFAC)==
In the period 1956 to 1963, S.T. Demetriades proposed methods of atmospheric gas accumulation by means of a satellite moving in [[low Earth orbit]], at an altitude of around 120&amp;nbsp;km, or propellant accumulation by stations on the surface of a planet or by gathering and exploiting interstellar matter &lt;ref&gt;JBIS, Vol 17, p114, 1959 - 1960; ARS Preprint 2438-62, Part I, 14-16 Mar 1962; Parts II, III and IV not to be found in the open literature; also National Archives ARC Identifier No. 1250057 and 1250058&lt;/ref&gt;{{full|date=November 2012}}&lt;ref&gt;1963 McGraw-Hill Yearbook of Science and Technology&lt;/ref&gt;{{request quotation|date=November 2011}}. In its simplest form, Demetriades' proposed satellite extracts air from the fringes of the atmosphere, compresses and cools it, and extracts liquid oxygen. The remaining nitrogen is, in part, used as propellant for a  nuclear-powered [[magnetohydrodynamics|magnetohydrodynamic]] electromagnetic plasma thruster, which maintains the orbit at about 120&amp;nbsp;km, or a solar powered thruster (and collection system) for altitudes above 150&amp;nbsp;km (as stated in the original 1959 JBIS article, p119) compensating for atmospheric [[Drag (physics)|drag]].&lt;ref name=Demetriades1962epc&gt;
{{cite journal|last=Demetriades|first=S.T.|title=The Use of Atmospheric and Extraterrestrial Resources in Space Propulsion Systems, Part I|journal=Electric Propulsion Conference, American Rocket Society|date=March 1962}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system was called “PROFAC” (PROpulsive Fluid ACcumulator).&lt;ref name=Demetriades1962jbis&gt;. Several systems were studied, e. g. PROFAC-S for Surface, PROFAC-C for Orbital, PROFAC-A for combination with aerospaceplane making one reusable stage to orbit possible, etc. Several inlets (e. g. conical as in AIEE 10 Aug 1960 San Diego meeting, or funnel) and cryopumps were studied for orbital air collection. The work slowed down in late 1961 although much progress was made in later years on such items as a solar-powered PROFAC. 
{{cite journal|last=Demetriades|first=S.T.|title=Plasma Propulsion|journal= Astronautics, American Rocket Society Inc., March and April 1962, title Preliminary Study of Propulsive Fluid Accumulator Systems, Journal of the British Interplanetary Society|year=1961–1962|volume=18|issue=10|pages=392|bibcode = 1962JBIS...18..392D }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
There are, however, safety concerns with placing a nuclear reactor in low Earth orbit.

== Propellant harvesting of atmospheric resources in orbit (PHARO) ==
Demetriades' proposal was further refined by Christopher Jones and others in 2010. In this proposal, multiple collection vehicles accumulate propellant gases at around 120&amp;nbsp;km altitude, later transferring them to a higher orbit. However, Jones' proposal does require a network of [[Space-based solar power|orbital power-beaming satellites]], to avoid placing nuclear reactors in orbit.&lt;ref name=Jones2010&gt;
Jones, C.,  Masse, D.,  Glass, C.,  Wilhite, A., and  Walker, M. (2010), "PHARO: Propellant harvesting of atmospheric resources in orbit," IEEE Aerospace Conference.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Harvesting at about 200 kilometers altitude (LOX-LEO) ==
Klinkman and Wilkes proposed, at the AIAA Space 2007 and Space 2009 conferences, that gases could be harvested at the very edge of the earth's atmosphere by a high vacuum pump. An ion propulsion engine would consume a portion of the harvested gases and would restore the spacecraft's orbital momentum.  Klinkman's proposal has a fairly low energy threshold for a small-scale harvesting operation, and air friction is far more forgiving at 200&amp;nbsp;km than at 100&amp;nbsp;km.&lt;ref name=Klinkman2009&gt;
Paul Klinkman and John Wilkes,"Gathering Propellants in LEO: Moving From 'Credible' to 'Feasible'" (2009), AIAA Space 2009.
&lt;/ref&gt;

Note that S. T. Demetriades pioneered in space propulsion, from the atomic oxygen ramjet (he proved it not feasible in the 1950s) to nuclear, ion, and plasma thrusters.  He received the 2010 AIAA Award for Plasmadynamics and Lasers.

== Propellant depots ==
{{commons category|Orbital propellant depots}}
{{main|Propellant depot}}
Boeing has suggested a non-extractive [[propellant depot]], or "space gas station," which accumulates material launched from the planet at low cost, allowing future lunar missions without the need for large launch vehicles like the [[Saturn V]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/space/news/4224660?page=1 Popular Mechanics: Space Gas Station Would Blast Huge Payloads to the Moon]&lt;/ref&gt; MIT has recently proposed a similar plan which would store emergency fuel reserves left over from lunar missions.&lt;ref&gt;http://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/aerospace/space-flight/mit-envisions-orbital-fueling-stations-for-future-moon-missions&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Protection International''' (PI) is an international [[non-profit organisation]] dedicated to the protection of [[human rights defenders]] (HRDs). Its stated mission is to enhance the security and the protection of "threatened civil society actors with non-violent means, especially those who fight for their legitimate rights and for the rights of others as they are guaranteed by the [[international humanitarian law]] and the human rights conventions".&lt;ref name="pimandate"&gt;{{Cite book|last=|first=|authorlink=|title=Protection International Mandate|publisher=Protection International|year=2009|page=1|doi=|id=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Protection International began its activities in 1998 as the former European Office of [[Peace Brigades International]] (PBI-BEO) and is headquartered in Brussels. Working on the principle that "human rights defenders are one of the main actors fighting against impunity in the name of justice",&lt;ref name="aboutpi"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.protectioninternational.org/spip.php?rubrique57&amp;lang=en |title=About Protection International | publisher=Protection International |accessdate=20 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; PI runs field projects in several countries ([[the Democratic Republic of the Congo]], [[Uganda]], [[Nepal]], [[Thailand]], [[Colombia]], [[Guatemala]], [[Honduras]]) and conflict-stricken zones such as the [[East Africa|East]] and [[Horn of Africa]] in collaboration with local partner organisations.

It provides human rights defenders (i.e. [[trade unionists]], [[journalists]], [[LGBTI|lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender individuals]] defenders, members of anti-corruption organizations, etc.) with training, knowledge and tools, such as the Protection Manual for Human Rights Defenders ",&lt;ref name="ProtectionManual"&gt;Marie Caraj, Luis Enrique Eguren {{Cite web|url=http://www.protectionline.org/IMG/pdf/manualenglish-3rdedition-2.pdf |title=New Protection Manual for Human Rights Defenders |year=2009 |publisher=Protection International |accessdate=21 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; to develop protection measures into their work and enable them "to defend all human rights".&lt;ref name="pimandate"/&gt; Protection International also aims at mobilising the national and international community (parliaments, governments, the [[United Nations]], the media and [[public opinion]]).

==History==
Protection International is the former [[European Union]] office of [[Peace Brigades International]] (PBI-BEO). In October 2007, PBI-BEO officially became Protection International, after a separation with the PBI organisation carried out by common consent. Nevertheless, current activities run by Protection International are the logical result of defenders protection initiatives which began more than a decade ago.

In 1998, it organised a hearing in the Plenary of the [[European Parliament]] where human rights defenders from [[Colombia]] and [[Guatemala]] witnessed. Since then, PI supports the development and implementation of "new tactics and tools for the protection of [[Human rights defender|HRDs]] by improving their own security strategies, thus also enabling them to improve their protection of others"&lt;ref name="piglobalprogramme"&gt;{{Cite book|last=|first=|authorlink=|title=Global Protection Programme for Human Rights Defenders|publisher=Protection International|year=2008|page=1|doi=|id=}}&lt;/ref&gt;(victim groups, witnesses, [[Internally Displaced People]] communities, women's HRD's, [[LGBTI]], among others).

From 1999 to 2002, PI organised public seminars on International Observation Strategies for [[INGO]]s and other stakeholders throughout Europe. At the same time, training activities on security and protection of HRD's were held in more than twenty countries (among others, [[Mexico]], [[Guatemala]], [[Colombia]], [[Brazil]], [[Peru]], [[Honduras]], [[Bolivia]], [[the Democratic Republic of the Congo]], [[Uganda]], [[Kenya]], [[Ingushetia]], [[Serbia]], [[Indonesia]], [[Nepal]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[India]] and [[Thailand]]).

From 2004 onwards, the organisation launched short and long-term activities in [[Asia]], [[Africa]] and [[Latin America]]. Notably, it opened in 2006 a first [[#Protection Desks]] in [[Nepal]], which is a permanent local structure whose objective is to diagnose human rights related threats, train local human rights defenders organisations and monitor their activities. Since then, [[#Protection Desks]] have been opened in Colombia, Guatemala, [[Uganda]] and the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]].

While developing its presence in sensitive areas, PI began working in 2003 with members of Parliaments in various European countries on the adoption of resolutions and motions on the protection of defenders. As a result, PI assisted the Belgian Parliament and Senate in designing and adopting in July 2003, a global reach resolution which asked the Belgian Government to "request its diplomatic missions to observe carefully and systematically the situation of human rights defenders in the countries where they're working.""&lt;ref name="PiResolutionBel"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.senate.be/www/?MIval=/publications/viewPubDoc&amp;TID=50331712&amp;LANG=nl |title=Proposition de résolution concernant la protection des défenseurs des droits humains (déposée par M. Philippe Mahoux) |date=3 July 2003 |publisher=Parlement de Belgique |accessdate=22 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Ref_label|A|a|none}}. In 2004, the [[Bundestag]] adopted a similar resolution &lt;ref name="PiResolutionAll"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dipbt.bundestag.de/dip21/btd/15/020/1502078.pdf|title=Entschliessung des Deutschen Bundestages : Schutz von bedrohten Menschenrechtsverteidigern |year=December 2003 |publisher=Bundestag |accessdate=22 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Spain followed in 2007 by voting its own legislation.&lt;ref name="PiResolutionEs"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.congreso.es/public_oficiales/L8/CONG/DS/PL/PL_263.PDF|title= Proposicion no de Ley sobre la Protección de Defensores y Defensoras de los Derechos Humanos |date=11 May 2007 |publisher=Congreso de Los Diputados |pages=14–22|accessdate=22 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PiResolutionEs2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://intranet.congreso.es/public_oficiales/L8/CONG/BOCG/D/D_577.PDF#page=5|title= Proposicion no de Ley sobre la Protección de Defensores y Defensoras de los Derechos Humanos |date=28 June 2007 |publisher=Congreso de Los Diputados |pages=5|accessdate=22 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the last few years, Protection International developed itself quite rapidly. From August 2008 to December 2009, it delivered trainings about security and protection measures for nearly 1500 HRD in its working countries. Moreover, it provides on a daily basis advice to 600 HRDs and their organisations through its permanent Protection Desks and liaise with international institutions such as the [[ACHPR|African Commission on Human and People's Rights]] (ACHPR) and the [[Special Rapporteur (UN)|UN Special Rapporteur]] on the situation of human rights defenders in order to design and implement new protection mechanisms.

In 2009, PI also issued its first [http://www.protectioninternational.org/IMG/pdf/PI_Annual_Report_web.pdf annual report] which represents "years of experience in field protection".&lt;ref name="PiReport"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.protectioninternational.org/IMG/pdf/PI_Annual_Report_web.pdf|title=Protection International Annual Report 2008 |year=2008 |publisher=Protection International |accessdate=22 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Objectives==
Broadly speaking, Protection International's objective is "to contribute to ensuring fulfilment of national and international obligations{{Ref_label|B|b|none}} for the protection of human rights defenders – people who, individually or together with others, take action to promote or protect human rights". Concretely it focuses itself on two goals :

* To promote wider knowledge, improved decision-making and increase the effective use of field protection strategies for and by the main stakeholders in protection.{{Ref_label|B|b|none}}
* To directly support the work of all stakeholders in the effective use of field protection.

In every activities, Protection Line follows international standards in international human rights law and especially the [http://www2.ohchr.org/english/issues/defenders/docs/declaration/declaration.pdf UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders](1998), The [http://www.consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cmsUpload/16332-re01.en08.pdf EU Guidelines on HRD] and the UN Guiding Principles for [[IDPs]] ([[Francis Deng|Deng]]'s principles).&lt;ref name="Deng 1998"&gt;{{Cite book| first=Francis | last=Deng| coauthors=| contribution=The guiding principles on internal displacement| title=E/CN.4/1998/53/Add.l, February 11.

While it put the emphasis on the improvement of human rights defenders abilities regarding the handling of security, protection and psychosocial training, both for themselves and the beneficiaries of their work, PI's Global Protection programme also focuses itself on political action and advocacy, in order that the national and international authorities and other key actors involved in protection issues enforce their obligations in terms of human rights defenders protection.

==Protection International's Work==
According to the Annual Report 2008 foreword, Protection International's role is not "to replace governments"&lt;ref name="PiReport" /&gt; in their responsibilities to protect human right's defenders but well to "advise defenders on improving their security by following tried-and-tested procedures" and to complement the work done by other [[NGOs]] and international institutions in this field. Therefore, PI covers a wide range of activities :
* '''Protection Capacity Building and Training''' through analysing the risks faced by HRDs in various contexts, managing their security and transferring knowledge and tools
* '''Protection research''' : publication of manuals and informations to develop best practices
* '''Advocacy''' : dissemination of information among key actors in human rights issues {{Ref_label|B|b|none}}, organization of debates and involvement of media, parliaments and trade unions, acting as an alarm to local authorities when they tend to forget their international obligations and commitments on HRDs protection
* '''Video Advocacy''' : production of testimonies and portraits of HRDS, showing their working environments, work experience (threats and challenges faced, achievements reached)
* '''Setting-up of Protection Desks''' that will be used as local centres in collaboration with partner networks and organisations.
* '''Managing [http://www.protectionline.org www.protectionline.org]''', a project website providing informations, documents, publications, press releases and promoting urgent actions for the protection of HRD.

===Protection Desks===
In the last years, Protection International turned its attention to the setting and development of an original and long-term concept : the Protection Desk (PDs). PDs are permanent structures that provide human rights defenders with the know-how and necessary tools to prioritize security and protection issues in their working plans (i.e. : in a newspaper or a trade union) and to develop their own security plan based on the trainings given by PI's trainers on the field. PDs are developed with other human rights organizations active in the targeted country and local partner organizations. The first Protection Desk opened in Nepal in 2006 and worked with "NGO's working in conflict regions with ethnic minorities, victims and community committees and on security-sensitivie topics like human trafficking".&lt;ref name="PiHistory"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.protectioninternational.org/spip.php?rubrique59&amp;lang=en|title=Protection International History |accessdate=22 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, Protection International grew substantially and opened new PD's in Uganda, Colombia, Guatemala and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Moreover, the organization is in the preparation of the setting up of a new Protection Desk in Thaïland which should be active in various countries of the region, from Pakistan to Indonesia.&lt;ref name="inreport"&gt;{{Cite book|last=|first=|authorlink=|title=Interim Narrative Report|publisher=Protection International|year=2010|page=1|doi=|id=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, Protection International led an observatory mission in DRC and organised two seminars on the EU Guidelines on HRDs.&lt;ref name="PiHistory"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.protectioninternational.org/spip.php?rubrique59&amp;lang=en |title=Protection International History|year=2009|publisher=Protection International |accessdate=26 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EUGuidelines"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cmsUpload/16332-re01.en08.pdf |title=European Union Guidelines on Human Rights Defenders |year=2008|publisher=Council of the European Union |accessdate=26 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2006 until 2007, it went on with the training of defenders: among the beneficiaries, there were 185 organisations of civil society coming from 13 conflict regions. Along this, Protection International developed regular advocacy activities for an improved protection of HRDs, mainly aimed at European embassies, the [[MONUC]] and also national and local stakeholders, especially those involved in the reform of the Congolese Judiciary.

In July 2006, PI organised a conference with 30 Congolese HRDs, Michael Matthiessen, [[Javier Solana]]'s personal representative for human rights and the [[ACHPR]]'s Special Rapporteur, Reine Alapini.&lt;ref name="Arimpunité"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.achpr.org/english/activity_reports/21%20Activity%20Report.pdf |title=TWENTY-FIRST ACTIVITY REPORT OF THE AFRICAN COMMISSION ON HUMAN AND PEOPLES’ RIGHTS Twenty-first Activity Report of the African Commission on Human and People's Rights|year=2007|publisher=African Union |page=11 |accessdate=26 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; En 2006, PI produced "Les armes de l'impunité" ("The Weapons of Impunity"), a documentary that recounts the assassination of Pascal Kabungulu, a Congolese human rights defender, who worked for the "Ligue des Droits de l'Homme dans la Région des Grands Lacs" (The Human Rights League of the Great Lakes) and the Protestant NGO "Héritiers de la Justice" (Heirs of Justice), and denounces the systematic intimidation or physic violence against the defenders who documented the abuses committed during the [[Second Congo War]].&lt;ref name="Arimpunité"/&gt;

In May 2009, Protection International requested a re-trial of the Maheshe Case.&lt;ref name="MahesheReport"&gt;{{Cite book| first=Sophie | last=Roudil| coauthors=| title=Rapport d’observation du procès d’appel "Maheshe" devant la cour militaire du Sud-Kivu (R.D.

According to Protection International, the trial "which took place in front of the Military Jurisdictions of Bukavu both at first instance and at appeal, respected neither the norms of a fair and equitable trial nor led to the manifestation of truth. In spite of this, three civilians were sentenced to death in May 2008".&lt;ref name="PRMaheshe"&gt;{{cite document |title=Executive Summary : Press Conference on the Maheshe Case in Bukavu |publisher=Protection International |date=30 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization recounts the whole observation of the appeal trial in a [http://www.protectionline.org/IMG/pdf/Maheshe_Rapport_2nd_edition-2.pdf comprehensive report] entitled "Rapport d’observation du procès d’appel «Maheshe» devant la cour militaire du Sud-Kivu (R.D. Congo) et suivi des recours". The work and the call for re-examination and re-trial of Protection International was deemed by the Belgian journalist Colette Braeckman, specialist of the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|DRC]], "all the more relevant as Didace Namujimbo, another journalist from Bukavu who also worked for the Monuc -which didn't take any civil action for both of its contributors- was assassinated in similar circumstances in 2008"&lt;ref name="braeckman" /&gt;

In August 2009, after the assassination of Bruno Koko Chirambiza, journalist at the Bukavu private station Radio Star Protection International, along with four other NGO's (Action des chrétiens pour l'abolition de la torture, Fédération de l'action des chrétiens pour l'abolition de la torture, Frontline et Diakonie), asked the Congolese authorities to put an end to impunity, claiming that "the situation of journalists and human rights defenders in the DRC is more and more worrying".

'''Quantum topology''' is a branch of mathematics that connects [[quantum mechanics]] with [[low-dimensional topology]].

[[Dirac notation]] provides a viewpoint of quantum mechanics which becomes amplified into a framework that can embrace the amplitudes associated with [[topological space]]s and the related embedding of one space within another such as knots and links in three-dimensional space. This [[bra–ket notation]] of kets and bras can be generalised, becoming maps of [[vector space]]s associated with [[topological space]]s that allow [[tensor product]]s.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Quantum  Topology and Quantum Computing by Louis H. Kauffman&lt;/ref&gt;

Topological [[Tangle (mathematics)|entanglement]] involving [[Link (knot theory)|linking]] and [[Braid theory|braiding]] can be intuitively related to [[quantum entanglement]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

The '''Scottish government economy directorates''' were a set of [[:wikt:directorate|directorates]] within the [[Scottish government]], the executive arm of the devolved government of [[Scotland]].  The directorates were headed by Dr [[Andrew Goudie (economist)|Andrew Goudie]], who also acted as the chief economic adviser to the Scottish government (Goudie retired in 2011 and joined [[University of Strathclyde|Strathclyde University]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-14268157|title=Andrew Goudie to take up Strathclyde University role|website=BBC News|access-date=2016-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;). The directorates were responsible for transport, sustainable development and planning. In 2010, the transport directorate merged with [[Transport Scotland]], an [[List of Scottish Executive agencies|Executive Agency]] of the [[Scottish Government]] and accountable to [[Scottish Ministers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.audit-scotland.gov.uk/docs/central/2010/fa_0910_transport_scotland.pdf|title=Report on the 2009/10 audit to Transport Scotland and the Auditor General for Scotland |last=|first=|date=November 2010|website=Audit Scotland|publisher=Transport Scotland|access-date=18 May  2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sexual harassment''' is [[bullying]] or [[coercion]] of a sexual nature and the unwelcome or inappropriate promise of rewards in exchange for sexual favors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Paludi | first1 = Michele A. | last2 = Barickman | first2 = Richard B. | chapter = Definitions and incidence of academic and workplace sexual harassment | chapterurl = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Vx4qhVPOYUUC&amp;pg=PA2 | title = Academic and workplace sexual harassment: a resource manual  | pages = 2–5 | publisher = SUNY Press | location = Albany, New York | year = 1991 | isbn = 9780791408308 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sexual harassment includes a range of actions from mild transgressions to [[sexual abuse]] or [[sexual assault|assault]].&lt;ref&gt;Dziech, Billie Wright; Weiner, Linda. ''The Lecherous Professor: Sexual Harassment on Campus''.{{page needed|date=October 2012}} Chicago Illinois: University of Illinois Press, 1990. {{ISBN|978-0-8070-3100-1}}; Boland, 2002{{page needed|date=October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A harasser may be the victim's supervisor, a supervisor in another area, a co-worker, or a client or customer. Harassers or victims may be of any [[gender]].&lt;ref name="eeoc"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.eeoc.gov/laws/types/sexual_harassment.cfm | title = Sexual Harassment | publisher = U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In most modern legal contexts, sexual harassment is illegal. Laws surrounding sexual harassment generally do not prohibit simple teasing, offhand comments, or minor isolated incidents—that is due to the fact that they do not impose a "general civility code".&lt;ref&gt;{{caselaw source |case=''Oncale v.Sundowner Offshore Services, Inc.'', 528 U.S. 75 (1998) |findlaw=https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/523/75.html |justia=https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/523/75/case.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the workplace, harassment may be considered illegal when it is frequent or severe thereby creating a hostile or offensive work environment or when it results in an adverse employment decision (such as the victim's demotion, firing or quitting). The legal and social understanding of sexual harassment, however, varies by culture.

Sexual harassment by an employer is a form of illegal [[employment discrimination]]. For many businesses or organizations, preventing sexual harassment and defending employees from sexual harassment charges have become key goals of legal decision-making.

{{TOC limit|3}}

==Etymology and history==
The modern legal understanding of sexual harassment was first developed in the 1970s, although related concepts have existed in many cultures.

=== The term "sexual harassment" ===
Although legal activist [[Catharine MacKinnon]] is sometimes credited with creating the laws surrounding sexual harassment in the United States with her 1979 book entitled ''Sexual Harassment of Working Women'',&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; the first known use of the term ''sexual harassment'' was in a 1973 report about discrimination called ''"Saturn's Rings"''  by [[Mary Rowe]], [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kamberi|first=Ferdi|last2=Gollopeni|first2=Besim|date=2015-12-01|title=The Phenomenon of Sexual Harassment at the Workplace in Republic of Kosovo|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/316515762|journal=International Review of Social Sciences|volume=3|pages=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; though Rowe has stated that sexual harassment was being discussed in women's groups in Massachusetts in the early 1970s, and wasn't likely the first person to use the term. At the time, Rowe was the Chancellor for Women and Work at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT).&lt;ref&gt;Rowe, Mary, "Saturn's Rings," a study of the minutiae of sexism which maintain discrimination and inhibit affirmative action results in corporations and non-profit institutions; published in Graduate and Professional Education of Women, American Association of University Women, 1974, pp.&amp;nbsp;1–9. "Saturn's Rings II" is a 1975 updating of the original, with racist and sexist incidents from 1974 and 1975. Revised and republished as "The Minutiae of Discrimination: The Need for Support," in Forisha, Barbara and Barbara Goldman, Outsiders on the Inside, Women in Organizations, Prentice-Hall, Inc., New Jersey, 1981, Ch. 11, pp.&amp;nbsp;155–171. {{ISBN|978-0-13-645382-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to her efforts at MIT, the university was one of the first large organizations in the U.S. to develop specific policies and procedures aimed at stopping sexual harassment.

In the book ''In Our Time: Memoir of a Revolution'' (1999), journalist [[Susan Brownmiller]] quotes [[Cornell University]] activists who believed they had coined the term 'sexual harassment' in 1975 after being asked for help by [[Carmita Dickerson Wood]], a 44-year-old single mother who was being harassed by a faculty member at Cornell's Department of Nuclear Physics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://timeline.com/carmita-wood-sexual-harrassment-f2c537a0e1e8|title=Groping in the Ivy League led to the first sexual harassment suit—and nothing happened to the man|date=2017-10-20|work=Timeline|access-date=2018-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=nuY_BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA146&amp;lpg=PA146&amp;dq=women+fight+intimidation+ithaca+journal#v=onepage&amp;q=carmita%20wood&amp;f=false|title=Cornell: A History, 1940–2015|last=Altschuler|first=Glenn C.|last2=Kramnick|first2=Isaac|date=2014-08-12|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=9780801471889|location=|pages=146|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=In Our Time: Memoir of a Revolution |first=Susan |last=Brownmiller |page=281}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These activists, [[Lin Farley]], [[Susan Meyer (Cornell University)|Susan Meyer]], and [[Karen Sauvigne]] went on to form the [[Working Women's Institute]] which, along with the [[Alliance Against Sexual Coercion]] (founded in 1976 by [[Freada Klein]], [[Lynn Wehrli]], and [[Elizabeth Cohn-Stuntz]]), were among the pioneer organizations to bring sexual harassment to public attention in the late 1970s. One of the first legal formulations of the concept of sexual harassment as consistent with sex discrimination and therefore prohibited behavior under [[Civil Rights Act of 1964|Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964]] appeared in the 1979 seminal book by Catharine MacKinnon&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.law.umich.edu/FacultyBio/Pages/FacultyBio.aspx?FacID=camtwo|title=MacKinnon, Catharine A. - University of Michigan Law School|website=www.law.umich.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; entitled "Sexual Harassment of Working Women".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = MacKinnon | first = Catharine |  title = Sexual Harassment of Working Women: A Case of Sex Discrimination.  | publisher = Yale University Press | location = New Haven, Connecticut | year = 1979 | isbn = 9780300022995 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Key sexual harassment cases ===
Sexual harassment first became codified in U.S. law as the result of a series of sexual harassment cases in the 1970s and 1980s. Many of the early women pursuing these cases were African American, often former civil rights activists who applied principles of civil rights to sex discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thenation.com/article/sexual-harassment-law-was-shaped-by-the-battles-of-black-women/|title=Sexual Harassment Law Was Shaped by the Battles of Black Women|last=Lipsitz|first=Raina|date=2017-10-20|work=The Nation|access-date=2018-04-12|language=en-US|issn=0027-8378}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Williams v. Saxbe]]'' (1976) and ''[[Paulette L. Barnes, Appellant, v. Douglas M. Costle, Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency]]'' (1977) determined it was sex discrimination to fire someone for refusing a supervisor's advances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=2wBPD1vvTCYC&amp;pg=PA92&amp;lpg=PA92&amp;dq=%22Diane+Williams%22+sexual+harassment#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Diane%20Williams%22&amp;f=false|title=The Women's Movement Against Sexual Harassment|last=Baker|first=Carrie N.|date=2008|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521879354|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thenation.com/article/sexual-harassment-law-was-shaped-by-the-battles-of-black-women/|title=Sexual Harassment Law Was Shaped by the Battles of Black Women|last=Lipsitz|first=Raina|date=2017-10-20|work=The Nation|access-date=2018-04-10|language=en-US|issn=0027-8378}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around the same time, ''[[Bundy v. Jackson]]'' was the first [[United States courts of appeals|federal appeals court]] case to hold that workplace sexual harassment was employment discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonian.com/2018/03/04/hertoo-40-years-ago-this-woman-helped-make-sexual-harassment-illegal-sandra-bundy/|title=#HerToo: 40 Years Ago This Woman Helped Make Sexual Harassment Illegal|date=2018-03-04|work=Washingtonian|access-date=2018-04-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Five years later the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] agreed with this holding in ''[[Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson]].'' Another pioneering legal case was ''[[Alexander v. Yale]]'', which established that the sexual harassment of female students could be considered sex discrimination under [[Title IX]], and was thus illegal.

The term was largely unknown (outside academic and legal circles) until the early 1990s when [[Anita Hill]] witnessed and testified against [[Supreme Court of the United States]] nominee [[Clarence Thomas]].&lt;ref name="techrep"&gt;Bowers, Toni; Hook, Brian. [http://www.techrepublic.com/article/hostile-work-environment-a-managers-legal-liability/5035282 Hostile work environment: A manager's legal liability], Tech Republic. October 22, 2002. Retrieved on March 3, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Since Hill testified in 1991, the number of sexual harassment cases reported in the US and Canada increased 58 percent and have climbed steadily.&lt;ref name="techrep" /&gt;

* The incident can take place in situations in which the harassed person may not be aware of or understand what is happening.
* The incident may be a one time occurrence but more often the incident repeats.
* Adverse effects on the target are common in the form of stress, social withdrawal, sleep, eating difficulties, and overall health impairment.

* The incident can result from a situation in which the perpetrator thinks they are making themselves clear, but is not understood the way they intended.

With the advent of the internet, social interactions, including sexual harassment, increasingly occur online, for example [[sexual harassment in video gaming|in video games]] or in chat rooms.

According to the 2014 PEW research statistics on online harassment, 25% of women and 13% of men between the ages of 18 and 24 have experienced sexual harassment while online.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pewinternet.org/2014/10/22/online-harassment/ Duggan, Maeve] "Online Harassment", PEW Research Center, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States' [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]] (EEOC) defines workplace sexual harassment as "unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature constitute sexual harassment when this conduct explicitly or implicitly affects an individual's employment, unreasonably interferes with an individual's work performance, or creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment” (EEOC).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.eeoc.gov/|title=EEOC Home Page|website=www.eeoc.gov|access-date=2016-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Varied behaviors==
[[File:Bullying Sexual.JPG|thumb|right|200px|A man makes an unwanted sexual advance on a woman.]]
One of the difficulties in understanding sexual harassment is that it involves a range of [[behavior]]s. In most cases (although not in all cases) it is difficult for the victim to describe what they experienced. This can be related to difficulty classifying the situation or could be related to [[stress (biology)|stress]] and [[humiliation]] experienced by the recipient. Moreover, behavior and motives vary between individual cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Louise|first=Fitzgerald|year=1995|title=Why Didn't She Just Report Him?

* A predatory harasser: a person who gets sexual thrills from humiliating others. This harasser may become involved in sexual extortion, and may frequently harass just to see how targets respond. Those who don't resist may even become targets for rape.
* A dominance harasser: the most common type, who engages in harassing behavior as an ego boost.
* Strategic or territorial harassers who seek to maintain privilege in jobs or physical locations, for example a man's harassment of a female employee in a predominantly male occupation.
* A [[Street harassment|street harasser]]: Another type of sexual harassment performed in public places by strangers. Street harassment includes verbal and nonverbal behavior, remarks that are frequently sexual in nature and comment on physical appearance or a person's presence in public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Street Harassment and the Informal Ghettoization of Women |first=Cynthia Grant |last=Bowman |journal=Harvard Law Review |volume=106 |issue=3 |date=Jan 1993 |pages=517–80 |jstor=1341656 |doi=10.2307/1341656}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many sororities and fraternities in the United States take preventative measures against [[hazing]] and hazing activities during the participants' pledging processes (which may often include sexual harassment). Many [[Greek organization]]s and universities nationwide have anti-hazing policies that explicitly recognize various acts and examples of hazing, and offer preventative measures for such situations.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hazingprevention.org/ Pualwan, CEO Emily N. ] HazingPrevention.org.

== Impact ==

The impact of sexual harassment can vary. In research carried out by the EU Fundamental Rights Agency, 17,335 female victims of sexual assault were asked to name the feelings that resulted from the most serious incident of sexual assault that they had encountered since the age of 15. 'Anger, annoyance, and embarrassment were the most common emotional responses, with 45% of women feeling anger, 41% annoyance, and 36% embarrassment. Furthermore, close to one in three women (29%) who has experienced sexual harassment have said that they felt fearful as a result of the most serious incident, while one in five (20%) victims say that the most serious incident made themselves feel ashamed of what had taken place.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Violence against women : an EU-wide survey : main results|others=European Union. Agency for Fundamental Rights.|isbn=9789292393427|location=Vienna|oclc=876847362|year = 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other situations, harassment may lead to temporary or prolonged stress or depression depending on the recipient's psychological abilities to cope and the type of harassment and the social support or lack thereof for the recipient. Psychologists and social workers report that severe or chronic sexual harassment can have the same psychological effects as rape or sexual assault.&lt;ref&gt;Koss, Mary P. "Changed Lives: The Psychological Impact of Sexual Harassment." in ''Ivory Power: Sexual Harassment On Campus.''

(Her family was later awarded six million dollars in punitive and compensatory damages.)&lt;/ref&gt; Victims who do not submit to harassment may also experience various forms of retaliation, including isolation and bullying.

As an overall social and economic effect every year, sexual harassment deprives women from active social and economic participation and costs hundreds of millions of dollars in lost educational and professional opportunities for mostly girls and women.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Boland, 2002{{page needed|date=October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the quantity of men implied in these conflicts is significant.

===Coping===
{{Expert needed|Psychology|section|date=July 2018}} 
Sexual harassment, by definition, is unwanted and not to be tolerated. There are ways, however, for offended and injured people to overcome the resultant psychological effects, remain in or return to society, regain healthy feelings within personal relationships when they were affected by the outside relationship trauma, regain social approval, and recover the ability to concentrate and be productive in educational and  work environments. These include [[stress management]] and therapy, [[cognitive-behavioral therapy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=11495093 |year=2001 |last1=Foa |first1=EB |last2=Street |first2=GP |title=Women and traumatic events |volume=62 Suppl 17 |pages=29–34 |journal=The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry}}&lt;/ref&gt; friends and family support, and advocacy.&lt;ref name="Advocacy as coping mechanism"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://lifehacker.com/how-to-cope-with-the-current-news-cycle-as-a-sexual-abu-1820823444 |title=How to Cope With the Current News Cycle as a Sexual Abuse Survivor |last=Schwartz |first=Deb |date=2017-12-05 |website=Lifehack |access-date=2018-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sexual Assault Advocates"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://psmag.com/social-justice/how-metoo-affects-sexual-assault-advocates |title=HOW #METOO AFFECTS SEXUAL ASSAULT ADVOCATES  As public awareness of harassment grows exponentially in the wake of #MeToo, the advocates staffing sexual assault hotlines are taking more calls—and teaching more callers—than ever before. |last=OLSEN |first=HANNA BROOKS OLSEN |date=2017-12-22 |website=PacificStandard |access-date=2018-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Immediate psychological and legal counseling are recommended since self-treatment may not release stress or remove trauma, and simply reporting to authorities may not have the desired effect, may be ignored, or may further injure the victim at its response.

A 1991 study done by K.R. Yount found three dominant strategies developed by a sample of women coal miners to manage sexual harassment on the job: the "lady", the "flirt", and the "tomboy".
The "ladies" were typically the older women workers who tended to disengage from the men, kept their distance, avoided using profanity, avoided engaging in any behavior that might be interpreted as suggestive. They also tended to emphasize by their appearance and manners that they were ladies. The consequences for the "ladies" were that they were the targets of the least amount of come-ons, teasing and sexual harassment, but they also accepted the least prestigious and lowest-paid jobs.&lt;ref name="Landrine 1997"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Landrine |first1=Hope |first2=Elizabeth A. |last2=Klonoff |year=1997 |title=Discrimination Against Women: Prevalence, Consequences, and Remedies |location=Thousand Oaks, CA |publisher=Sage Publications}}{{page needed|date=December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "flirts" were most often the younger single women. As a defense mechanism, they pretended to be flattered when they were the targets of sexual comments. Consequently, they became perceived as the "embodiment of the female stereotype,...as particularly lacking in potential and were given the fewest opportunities to develop job skills and to establish social and self-identities as miners."&lt;ref name="Landrine 1997"/&gt;

The "tomboys" were generally single women, but were older than the "flirts". They attempted to separate themselves from the female stereotype and focused on their status as coal miners and tried to develop a "thick skin". They responded to harassment with humor, comebacks, sexual talk of their own, or reciprocation. As a result, they were often viewed as sluts or sexually promiscuous and as women who violated the sexual double standard. Consequently, they were subjected to intensified and increased harassment by some men. It was not clear whether the tomboy strategy resulted in better or worse job assignments.&lt;ref name="Landrine 1997"/&gt;

The findings of this study may be applicable to other work settings, including factories, restaurants, offices, and universities. The study concludes that individual strategies for coping with sexual harassment are not likely to be effective and may have unexpected negative consequences for the workplace and may even lead to increased sexual harassment. Women who try to deal with sexual harassment on their own, regardless of what they do, seem to be in a no-win situation.&lt;ref name="Landrine 1997"/&gt;

===Common effects on the victims===
{{Expert needed|Psychology|section|date=July 2018}}
Common psychological, academic, professional, financial, and social effects of sexual harassment and retaliation:
* Becoming publicly [[sexualization|sexualized]] (i.e. groups of people "evaluate" the victim to establish if he or she is "worth" the sexual attention or the risk to the harasser's career)
* Being objectified and humiliated by scrutiny and gossip
* Decreased work or school performance as a result of stress conditions; increased [[absenteeism]] in fear of harassment repetition
* [[Defamation]] of character and reputation
* Effects on sexual life and relationships: can put extreme stress upon relationships with [[significant other]]s, sometimes resulting in divorce
* Firing and refusal for a job opportunity can lead to loss of job or career, loss of income
* Having one's personal life offered up for public scrutiny—the victim becomes the "accused", and his or her dress, lifestyle, and private life will often come under attack.
* Having to drop courses, change academic plans, or leave school (loss of tuition) in fear of harassment repetition or as a result of stress
* Having to relocate to another city, another job, or another school
* Loss of references/recommendations
* Loss of trust in environments similar to where the harassment occurred
* Loss of trust in the types of people that occupy similar positions as the harasser or his or her colleagues, especially in case they are not supportive, difficulties or stress on peer relationships, or relationships with colleagues
* Psychological stress and health impairment
* Weakening of support network, or being ostracized from professional or academic circles (friends, colleagues, or family may distance themselves from the victim, or shun him or her altogether)

[[Major depressive disorder|depression]]; [[anxiety]]; [[panic attack]]s; sleeplessness; [[nightmare]]s; [[shame]]; [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]]; difficulty concentrating; headaches; [[fatigue (physical)|fatigue]]; loss of motivation; stomach problems; [[eating disorder]]s (such as weight loss or gain); [[alcoholism]]; feeling betrayed, violated, angry, violent towards the perpetrator, powerless or out of control; increased blood pressure; loss of confidence or self-esteem; withdrawal; [[Solitude|isolation]]; overall loss of [[Trust (sociology)|trust]] in people; traumatic stress; [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD); [[complex post-traumatic stress disorder]]; [[Suicidal ideation|suicidal thoughts]] or attempts, and [[suicide]].&lt;ref name="SHSF_effects" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webcom.com/wcs/harass.html|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20070709085048/http://www.webcom.com/wcs/harass.html|deadurl=yes|title=Women's Crisis Support Services|date=9 July 2007|archivedate=9 July 2007|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uoregon.edu/~counsel/harass.htm |title=Sexual Harassment: Myths and Realities |publisher=Uoregon.edu |accessdate=2012-10-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516085341/http://www.uoregon.edu/~counsel/harass.htm |archivedate=May 16, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="VAW_effects"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stopvaw.org/Effects_of_Sexual_Harassment.html |title=Effects of Sexual Harassment |publisher=Stop Violence Against Women |date=9 May 2007 |accessdate=2012-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="org_factor"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilo.org/public/english/protection/safework/gender/encyclo/psy14ae.htm |title=Psychosocial and Organizational Factors: Sexual Harassment |publisher=Ilo.org |accessdate=2012-10-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081220123857/http://www.ilo.org/public/english/protection/safework/gender/encyclo/psy14ae.htm |archivedate=December 20, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-complaint retaliation and backlash===
Retaliation and backlash against a victim are very common, particularly a complainant. Victims who speak out against sexual harassment are often labeled troublemakers who are on their own "power trips", or who are looking for attention. Similar to cases of [[rape]] or sexual assault, the victim often becomes the accused, with their appearance, private life, and character likely to fall under intrusive scrutiny and attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Dittman, M. |url=http://www.apa.org/monitor/oct03/harass.html |title=Sexual harassment too often leads to humiliation for victims |work=Monitor on Psychology |publisher=American Psychological Association |date=October 2003 |volume=34 |issue=9 |accessdate=2012-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; They risk hostility and isolation from colleagues, supervisors, teachers, fellow students, and even friends. They may become the targets of [[mobbing]] or [[relational aggression]].&lt;ref name="SHSF_effects"&gt;[http://www.sexualharassmentsupport.org/effects.html Effects of Sexual Harassment] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060118134554/http://www.sexualharassmentsupport.org/effects.html |date=January 18, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women are not necessarily sympathetic to female complainants who have been sexually harassed. If the harasser was male, internalized sexism (or jealousy over the sexual attention towards the victim) may encourage some women to react with as much hostility towards the complainant as some male colleagues.&lt;ref name="webcom"&gt;[http://www.webcom.com/wcs/harass.html Dealing With Sexual Harassment] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20070709085048/http://www.webcom.com/wcs/harass.html |date=2007-07-09 }} (link is not active)&lt;/ref&gt; Fear of being targeted for harassment or retaliation themselves may also cause some women to respond with hostility.&lt;ref name="backlash"&gt;[http://www.sexualharassmentsupport.org/Backlash.html Sexual harassment retaliation, backlash, and victim blaming] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060215113203/http://www.sexualharassmentsupport.org/Backlash.html |date=February 15, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, when Lois Jenson filed her lawsuit against Eveleth Taconite Co., the women [[shunning|shunned]] her both at work and in the community—many of these women later joined her suit.&lt;ref&gt;Bingham, Clara; Gansler, Laura Leedy. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=ur03ZVbot6IC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Class Action: The Landmark Case that Changed Sexual Harassment Law]''.{{page needed|date=October 2012}} New York, Anchor Books, 2002. {{ISBN|978-0-385-49613-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Women may even project hostility onto the victim in order to bond with their male coworkers and build trust.&lt;ref name="backlash" /&gt;

Retaliation has occurred when a sexual harassment victim suffers a negative action as a result of the harassment. For example, a complainant be given poor evaluations or low grades, have their projects [[sabotage]]d, be denied work or academic opportunities, have their work hours cut back, and other actions against them which undermine their productivity, or their ability to advance at work or school, being fired after reporting sexual harassment or leading to unemployment as they may be suspended, asked to resign, or be [[firing|fired]] from their jobs altogether. Retaliation can even involve further sexual harassment, and also [[stalking]] and [[cyberstalking]] of the victim.&lt;ref name="webcom" /&gt;&lt;ref name="backlash" /&gt; Moreover, a school professor or employer accused of sexual harassment, or who is the colleague of a perpetrator, can use their power to see that a victim is never hired again(blacklisting), or never accepted to another school.

Of the women who have approached her to share their own experiences of being [[Sexual harassment in education|sexually harassed by their teachers]], [[Feminism|feminist]] and writer [[Naomi Wolf]] wrote in 2004:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I am ashamed of what I tell them: that they should indeed worry about making an accusation because what they fear is likely to come true. Not one of the women I have heard from had an outcome that was not worse for her than silence. One, I recall, was drummed out of the school by peer pressure. Many faced bureaucratic stonewalling. Some women said they lost their academic status as golden girls overnight; grants dried up, letters of recommendation were no longer forthcoming. No one was met with a coherent process that was not weighted against them. Usually, the key decision-makers in the college or university—especially if it was a private university—joined forces to, in effect, collude with the faculty member accused; to protect not him necessarily but the reputation of the university, and to keep information from surfacing in a way that could protect other women. The goal seemed to be not to provide a balanced forum, but damage control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wolf |first=Naomi |url=http://newyorkmetro.com/nymetro/news/features/n_9932/index.html |title=The Silent Treatment |publisher=New York Metro |date=March 2004 |accessdate=2012-10-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011083501/http://newyorkmetro.com/nymetro/news/features/n_9932/index.html |archivedate=2008-10-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another woman who was interviewed by sociologist Helen Watson said, "Facing up to the crime and having to deal with it in public is probably worse than suffering in silence. I found it to be a lot worse than the harassment itself."&lt;ref&gt;Watson, Helen.

===Backlash stress===
Backlash stress is stress resulting from an uncertainty regarding changing norms for interacting with women in the workplace.&lt;ref name="Taylor Schneider"&gt;{{cite book |first=Kimberly |last=Taylor Schneider |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Bystander_Stress.html?id=gH18NQAACAAJ|title=Bystander Stress: The Effect of Organizational Tolerance of Sexual Harassment on Victim's Co-workers |publisher=University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign |year=1996 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Backlash stress now deters many male workers from befriending female colleagues, or providing them with any assistance, such as holding doors open. As a result, women are being handicapped by a lack of the necessary networking and mentorship.&lt;ref name="daubney"&gt;{{Cite newspaper|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/relationships/11904203/Well-done-feminism.-Now-man-are-afraid-to-help-women-at-work.html|title=Well done, feminism.

==Organizational policies and procedures==
Most companies have policies against sexual harassment, however these policies are not designed and should not attempt to "regulate romance" which goes against human urges.&lt;ref name="markschickman"/&gt;

Act upon a report of harassment inside the organization should be:

{{quote|The investigation should be designed to obtain a prompt and thorough collection of the facts, an appropriate responsive action, and an expeditious report to the complainant that the investigation has been concluded, and, to the full extent appropriate, the action taken.|Mark I.

[[American Bar Association]]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

When organizations do not take the respective satisfactory measures for properly investigating, stress and psychological counseling and guidance, and just deciding of the problem this could lead to:
* Decreased productivity and increased team conflict
* Decreased study or job satisfaction
* Loss of students and staff. Loss of students who leave school and staff resignations to avoid harassment. Resignations and firings of alleged harassers.
* Decreased productivity and increased absenteeism by staff or students experiencing harassment
* Decrease in success at meeting academic and financial goals
* Increased health-care and sick-pay costs because of the health consequences of harassment or retaliation
* The knowledge that harassment is permitted can undermine ethical standards and discipline in the organization in general, as staff or students lose respect for, and trust in, their seniors who indulge in, or turn a blind eye to, or treat improperly sexual harassment
* If the problem is ignored or not treated properly, a company's or school's image can suffer
* High jury awards for the employee, attorney fees and litigation costs if the problem is ignored or not treated properly (in case of firing the victim) when the complainants are advised to and take the issue to court.&lt;ref name="techrep"/&gt;&lt;ref name="VAW_effects" /&gt;&lt;ref name="org_factor" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boland, 1990{{page needed|date=October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="janaraver"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://qnc.queensu.ca/story_loader.php?id=42b98262192e9 Sexual harassment bad for victims and for business] June 22, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.westerncape.gov.za/eng/pubs/guides/S/63925/7 |title=For Help with the Handling of Harassment |publisher=Western Cape Government |accessdate=2012-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies show that [[organizational climate]] (an organization's tolerance, policy, procedure etc.) and workplace environment are essential for understanding the conditions in which sexual harassment is likely to occur, and the way its victims will be affected (yet, research on specific policy and procedure, and awareness strategies is lacking). Another element which increases the risk for sexual harassment is the job’s gender context (having few women in the close working environment or practicing in a field which is atypical for women).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1744-6570.2007.00067.x |title=A Meta-Analysis of the Antecedents and Consequences of Workplace Sexual Harassment |year=2007 |last1=Willness |first1=Chelsea R. |last2=Steel |first2=Piers |last3=Lee |first3=Kibeom |journal=Personnel Psychology |volume=60 |pages=127–162|citeseerx=10.1.1.472.6532 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Dr. Orit Kamir, the most effective way to avoid sexual harassment in the workplace, and also influence the public’s state of mind, is for the employer to adopt a clear policy prohibiting sexual harassment and to make it very clear to their employees. Many women prefer to make a complaint and to have the matter resolved within the workplace rather than to "air out the dirty laundry" with a public complaint and be seen as a traitor by colleagues, superiors and employers, adds Kamir.&lt;ref&gt;קמיר אורית, "החוק הישראלי למניעת הטרדה מינית- איפה אנחנו במלואת לו עשור? / "Israeli law against sexual harassment - where we all had a decade"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="maryrowe"&gt;Rowe, Mary.

Most prefer a pragmatic solution that would stop the harassment and prevent future contact with the harasser rather than turning to the police. More about the difficulty in turning an offense into a legal act can be found in Felstiner &amp; Sarat's (1981) study,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=William L.F. |last1=Felstiner |first2=Richard L. |last2=Abel |first3=Austin |last3=Sarat |year=1980 |title=The Emergence and Transformation of Disputes: Naming, Blaming, Claiming… |journal=Law &amp; Society Review |volume=15 |issue=3/4 |pages=631–54 |jstor=3053505 |doi=10.2307/3053505}}&lt;/ref&gt; which describes three steps a victim (of any dispute) must go through before turning to the justice system: naming – giving the assault a definition, blaming – understanding who is responsible for the violation of rights and facing them, and finally, claiming – turning to the authorities.

It may include a range of actions from mild transgressions to [[sexual abuse]] or [[sexual assault]].&lt;ref&gt;Dziech, Billie Wright; Weiner, Linda. ''The Lecherous Professor: Sexual Harassment on Campus''.{{page needed|date=October 2012}} Chicago Illinois: University of Illinois Press, 1990. {{ISBN|978-0-8070-3100-1}}; Boland, 2002{{page needed|date=October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sexual harassment is a form of [[Law|illegal]] [[employment discrimination]] in many countries, and is a form of [[abuse]] (sexual and [[psychological abuse]]s) and [[bullying]].

The [[Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women]] classifies [[violence against women]] into three categories: that occurring in the family, that occurring within the general community, and that perpetrated or condoned by the State. The term ''sexual harassment'' is used in defining violence occurring in the general community, which is defined as: "Physical, sexual and psychological violence occurring within the general community, including rape, sexual abuse, sexual harassment and intimidation at work, in educational institutions and elsewhere, trafficking in women and forced prostitution."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/48/a48r104.htm|title=A/RES/48/104.

Sexual harassment is subject to a [[Directive (European Union)|directive in the European Union]].&lt;ref name="eur-lex.europa.eu"&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CONSLEG:1976L0207:20021005:EN:PDF "{O}n the implementation of the principle of equal treatment for men and women ...

Amended 23 September 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States]]' [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]] (EEOC) states, "It is unlawful to harass a person (an applicant or employee) because of that person's sex."

In India, the case of [[Vishakha and others v State of Rajasthan]] in 1997 has been credited with establishing sexual harassment as illegal.&lt;ref name="india_rape"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legalserviceindia.com/articles/rape_laws.htm |title=Sexual Harassment and Rape Laws in India |publisher=Legal Service India |accessdate=2012-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Israel, the 1988 Equal Employment Opportunity Law made it a crime for an employer to retaliate against an employee who had rejected sexual advances, but it wasn't until 1998 that the Israeli Sexual Harassment Law made such behavior illegal.&lt;ref name="Kamir" /&gt;

In May 2002, the [[European Union]] Council and Parliament amended a 1976 Council Directive on the equal treatment of men and women in employment to prohibit sexual harassment in the workplace, naming it a form of sex discrimination and violation of dignity. This Directive required all Member States of the European Union to adopt laws on sexual harassment, or amend existing laws to comply with the Directive by October 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stopvaw.org/Domestic_Legal_Framework.html?Type=B_BASIC&amp;SEC={D7FABC81-256E-41C1-BF3A-563AD89AA809} Domestic Legal Framework] November 1, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, China added new provisions to the ''Law on Women's Right Protection'' to include sexual harassment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/4625913.stm |title=China to outlaw sexual harassment |publisher=BBC News |date=27 June 2005 |accessdate=2012-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, "The Shanghai Supplement" was drafted to help further define sexual harassment in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Li |first=Cao |last2=South |first2=Mark |url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2006-10/27/content_718147.htm |title=Draft bill details sexual harassment |publisher=China Daily |date=27 October 2006 |accessdate=2012-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sexual harassment remains legal in Kuwait&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2016/country-chapters/kuwait "Kuwait: Women’s Rights, Sexual Orientation, and Gender Identity"], ''[[Human Rights Watch]], 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; and Djibouti.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/252887.pdf "Djibouti 2015 Human Rights Report"], [[United States Department of State]] [[Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Varied legal guidelines and definitions===
'''The [[United Nations]] General Recommendation 19 to the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women''' defines sexual harassment of women to include:

&lt;blockquote&gt;such unwelcome sexually determined behavior as physical contact and advances, sexually colored remarks, showing pornography and sexual demands, whether by words or actions. Such conduct can be humiliating and may constitute a health and safety problem; it is discriminatory when the woman has reasonable ground to believe that her objection would disadvantage her in connection with her employment, including recruitment or promotion, or when it creates a hostile working environment.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

While such conduct can be harassment of women by men, many laws around the world which prohibit sexual harassment recognize that both men and women may be harassers or victims of sexual harassment. However, most claims of sexual harassment are made by women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/statistics/enforcement/sexual_harassment.cfm |title=Sexual Harassment Charges: EEOC &amp; FEPAs Combined: FY 1997 - FY 2011 |publisher=U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission |accessdate=2012-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many similarities, and also important differences in laws and definitions used around the world.

====Morocco====
In 2016 a stricter law proscribing sexual harassment was proposed in Morocco specifying fines and a possible jail sentence of up to 6 months.&lt;ref name="tmt_24March2016"&gt;{{cite news|title=Up to 6 Months in Jail if You Sexually Harass a Woman in Morocco|url=http://themoroccantimes.com/2016/03/18929/sexual-harrassement-morocco-jail-sentence|accessdate=11 October 2016|publisher=themoroccantimes.com|date=24 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The existing law against harassment was reported to not be upheld, as harassment was not reported to police by victims and even when reported, was not investigated by police or prosecuted by the courts.&lt;ref name="tmt_24March2016"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc_mag_10Oct2016"&gt;{{cite news|title=The Moroccan women fighting daily sexual harassment|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-37589687|accessdate=11 October 2016|work=BBC Magazine|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=10 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===
The Sex Discrimination Act 1984 defines sexual harassment as "... a person sexually harasses another person (the person harassed ) if: (a) the person makes an unwelcome sexual advance, or an unwelcome request for sexual favours, to the person harassed; or (b) engages in other unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature in relation to the person harassed; in circumstances in which a reasonable person, having regard to all the circumstances, would have anticipated the possibility that the person harassed would be offended, humiliated or intimidated."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|sda1984209|Sex Discrimination Act 1984|28A}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Europe===
In the [[European Union]], there is a [[Directive (European Union)|directive]] on sexual harassment. The ''Directive 2002/73/EC - equal treatment of 23 September 2002 amending Council Directive 76/207/EEC on the implementation of the principle of equal treatment for men and women as regards access to employment, vocational training and promotion, and working conditions'' states:&lt;ref name="eur-lex.europa.eu"/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;For the purposes of this Directive, the following definitions shall apply: (...)
* sexual harassment: where any form of unwanted verbal, non-verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature occurs, with the purpose or effect of violating the dignity of a person, in particular when creating an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive environment
Harassment and sexual harassment within the meaning of this Directive shall be deemed to be discrimination on the grounds of sex and therefore prohibited.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence]] also addresses the issue of sexual harassment (Article 40), using a similar definition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/EN/Treaties/Html/210.htm|title=Council of Europe - Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence (CETS No. 210)|work=coe.int}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Denmark====
Sexual harassment is defined as, when any verbal, non-verbal or physical action is used to change a victim's sexual status against the will of the victim and resulting in the victim feeling inferior or hurting the victim's dignity. Man and woman are looked upon as equal, and any action trying to change the balance in status with the differences in sex as a tool, is also sexual harassment. In the workplace, jokes, remarks, etc., are only deemed discriminatory if the employer has stated so in their written policy. Law number 1385 of December 21, 2005 regulates this area.&lt;ref name="Denmark law"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ku.dk/regel/2/2002.html#LOV%20nr%201385 |title=Denmark Law |publisher=Ku.dk |accessdate=2012-10-07|date=2016-06-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====France====
In [[France]], both the Criminal Code and the Labor Code are relevant to the issue of sexual harassment. Until May 4, 2012, article 222-33 of the French Criminal Code described sexual harassment as "The fact of harassing anyone in order to obtain favors of a sexual nature".&lt;ref&gt;Art. 179 of the Law no. 2002-73 of 17 January 2002 on social modernization&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2002, it recognized the possibility of sexual harassment between co-workers and not only by supervisors. On May 4, 2012, the [http://www.conseil-constitutionnel.fr Conseil constitutionnel] (French Supreme Court) quashed the definition of the criminal code as being too vague.&lt;ref&gt;Decision no. 2012-240 QPC of May 4, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The 2012 decision resulted from a law on priority preliminary rulings on the issue of constitutionality. As a consequence of this decision, all pending procedures before criminal courts were cancelled. Several feminist NGOs, such as AFVT, criticized this decision. President [[François Hollande]], the Minister of Justice (Christine Taubira) and the Minister of Equality (Najat Belkacem) asked that a new law be voted rapidly. As a result, ''LOI n°2012-954 du 6 août 2012'' was voted in, providing a new definition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCodeArticle.do?idArticle=LEGIARTI000021796942&amp;cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006070719 "Code pénal: Article 222-33" (in French)], ''legifrance.gouv.fr''.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to criminal provisions, the French Labor code also prohibits sexual harassment.&lt;ref&gt;Act of 2 November 1992&lt;/ref&gt; The legislator voted a law in 2008&lt;ref&gt;Act of 27 May 2008&lt;/ref&gt; that copied the 2002/73/EC Directive&lt;ref&gt;Directive of 23 September 2002 amending Council Directive 76/207/EEC on the implementation of the principle of equal treatment for men and women as regards access to employment, vocational training and promotion, and working conditions&lt;/ref&gt; definition without modifying the French Labour Code.

====Germany====
Sexual harassment is no statutory offense in Germany. In special cases it might be chargeable as "Insult" (with sexual context) as per § 185 [[Strafgesetzbuch]] but only if ''special circumstances'' show an insulting nature.

The victim has only a right to self-defend while the attack takes place. If a perpetrator kisses or gropes the victim, they may only fight back while this is happening. If the victim would, for instance, slap back after the attacker already stopped, the victim might be chargeable for assault as per § 223 [[Strafgesetzbuch]].&lt;ref&gt;Nina Adelmann: [http://www.juraexamen.info/wp-content/uploads/jura.2009.24.pdf Die Straflosigkeit des »Busengrapschens«] (PDF; 123&amp;nbsp;kB)&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2016 the governing coalition decided about the key points of a tightening of the law governing sexual offenses (Sexualstrafrecht, literally: law on the punishment of sexual delicts). At July 7, 2016 the Bundestag passed the resolution&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper |date=2016-07-07 |title=Votum: Bundestag beschließt neues Sexualstrafrecht |journal=Spiegel Online |language=German |trans-title=|url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/bundestag-beschliesst-neues-sexualstrafrecht-a-1101813.html |accessdate=2016-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by autumn 2016 the draft bill will be presented to the second chamber, the Bundesrat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper |date=2016-07-07 |title=Neues Sexualstrafrecht: Nein heißt Nein.

====Greece====
In response to the EU Directive 2002/73/EC, [[Greece]] enacted Law 3488/2006 (O.G.A.'.191). The law specifies that sexual harassment is a form of gender-based discrimination in the workplace. Victims also have the right to compensation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sgdatabase.unwomen.org/searchDetail.action?measureId%3D10297%26baseHREF%3Dcountry%26baseHREFId%3D563 |title=AW 3488/2006 ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PRINCIPLE OF EQUAL TREATMENT OF MEN AND WOMEN IN THE FIELDS OF ACCESS TO EMPLOYMENT, VOCATIONAL TRAINING AND PROMOTION, TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF WORK |accessdate=2014-01-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201171917/http://sgdatabase.unwomen.org/searchDetail.action?measureId=10297&amp;baseHREF=country&amp;baseHREFId=563 |archivedate=2014-02-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to this law, the policy on sexual harassment in Greece was very weak. Sexual harassment was not defined by any law, and victims could only use general laws, which were very poor in addressing the issue.&lt;ref&gt;Tsekos, Mary Ellen, [http://www.wcl.american.edu/hrbrief/10/2tsekos.pdf "The New European Union Directive on Sexual Harassment and Its Implications for Greece"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140722085849/http://www.wcl.american.edu/hrbrief/10/2tsekos.pdf |date=2014-07-22 }}, ''[[Center for Human Rights &amp; Humanitarian Law|Human Rights Brief]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Symeonidou-Kastanidou, E., [http://www.intellectum.org/articles/issues/intellectum3/en/ITL03p015025_Sexual%20Harassment%20in%20the%20Greek%20Criminal%20Law_Elissavet%20Symeonidou%20Kastanidou.pdf "The Sexual Harassment in Greek Criminal Law (Law 3488/2006)"], ''[[Intellectum]]'', 30 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Russia====
In the Criminal Code, Russian Federation, (CC RF), there exists a law which prohibits utilization of an office position and material dependence for coercion of sexual interactions (Article 118, current CC RF). However, according to the Moscow Center for Gender Studies, in practice, the courts do not examine these issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://shsf.invisionzone.com/index.php?s=a1f5e83af0f492d74310d4d1a073b792&amp;showtopic=279 |title=Sexual Harassment in Russian Workplaces - Sexual Harassment Support Forum |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311060132/http://shsf.invisionzone.com/index.php?s=a1f5e83af0f492d74310d4d1a073b792&amp;showtopic=279 |archivedate=2007-03-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Switzerland====
A ban on discrimination was included in the Federal Constitution (Article 4, Paragraph 2 of the old Federal Constitution) in 1981 and adopted in Article 8, paragraph 2 of the revised Constitution. The ban on sexual harassment in the workplace forms part of the Federal Act on Gender Equality (GEA) of 24 March 1995, where it is one of several provisions which prohibit discrimination in employment and which are intended to promote equality. Article 4 of the GEA defines the circumstances, Article 5 legal rights and Article 10 protection against dismissal during the complaints procedure.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.admin.ch/opc/en/classified-compilation/19950082/index.html|title=Federal Act on Gender Equality|last=|first=|date=1995-03-24|website=The Federal Council - The Portal of the Swiss Government|access-date=2018-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Article 328, paragraph 1 of the Code of Obligations (OR), Article 198 (2) of the Penal Code (StGB) and Article 6, paragraph 1 of the Employment Act (ArG) contain further statutory provisions on the ban on sexual harassment. The ban on sexual harassment is intended exclusively for employers, within the scope of their responsibility for protection of legal personality, mental and physical well-being and health.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

Article 4 of the GEA of 1995 discusses the topic of sexual harassment in the workplace: "Any harassing behaviour of a sexual nature or other behaviour related to the person's sex that adversely affects the dignity of women or men in the workplace is discriminatory. Such behaviour includes in particular threats, the promise of advantages, the use of coercion and the exertion of pressure in order to obtain favours of a sexual nature."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

====United Kingdom====
The Discrimination Act of 1975, was modified to establish sexual harassment as a form of discrimination in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eoc-law.org.uk/default.aspx?page=4666|title=Strathclyde Regional Council v Porcelli [1986&amp;#93; IRLR 134 Court of Session|work=eoc-law.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; It states that harassment occurs where there is unwanted conduct on the ground of a person's sex or unwanted conduct of a sexual nature and that conduct has the purpose or effect of violating a person's dignity, or of creating an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive environment for them. If an employer treats someone less favourably because they have rejected, or submitted to, either form of harassment described above, this is also harassment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eoc.org.uk/Default.aspx?page=15657 |title=Sexual Harassment: what the law says |publisher=Eoc.org.uk |date=2010-08-10 |accessdate=2012-10-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070831002533/http://www.eoc.org.uk/Default.aspx?page=15657 |archivedate=August 31, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====India====
{{Further|Sexism in India|Eveteasing|The Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013}}
Sexual harassment in [[India]] is termed "[[Eve teasing]]" and is described as: unwelcome sexual gesture or behaviour whether directly or indirectly as sexually coloured remarks; physical contact and advances; showing pornography; a demand or request for sexual favours; any other unwelcome physical, verbal or non-verbal conduct being sexual in nature or passing sexually offensive and unacceptable remarks. The critical factor is the unwelcomeness of the behaviour, thereby making the impact of such actions on the recipient more relevant rather than intent of the perpetrator.&lt;ref name="india_rape" /&gt; According to the [[Indian constitution]], sexual harassment infringes the fundamental right of a woman to gender equality under Article 14 and her right to life and live with dignity under Article 21.&lt;ref name="amicus.iupindia.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amicus.iupindia.org/Lels_WorkplaceHarassment_ovw.asp |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171202183755/http://www.amicus.iupindia.org/Lels_WorkplaceHarassment_ovw.asp |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2017-12-02 |title=ICFAI University - Workplace Harassment |publisher=Amicus.iupindia.org |accessdate=2012-10-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, the [[Supreme Court of India]] in a [[Public Interest Litigation]], defined sexual harassment at workplace, preventive measures and redress mechanism. The judgment is popularly known as [[Vishaka Judgment]].&lt;ref name="Vishaka 001"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1031794/ |title=Vishaka &amp; Ors vs State Of Rajasthan &amp; Ors on 13 August 1997 |author1=Manohar, SV |author2=Kirpal, BN |journal=Supreme Court of India - |date=August 1997 |volume=241 |id=SCC Ref:(1997)6.

Almost 16 years after the Supreme Court's landmark guidelines on prevention of sexual harassment in the workplace (known as the "[[Vishaka Guidelines]]"), the Act has endorsed many of the guidelines, and is a step towards codifying gender equality. The Act is intended to include all women employees in its ambit, including those employed in the unorganized sector, as well as domestic workers.

The Act has identified sexual harassment as a violation of the fundamental rights of a woman to equality under articles 14 and 15 of the Constitution of India and her right to life and to live with dignity under article 21 of the Constitution; as well as the right to practice any profession or to carry on any occupation, trade or business which includes a right to a safe environment free from sexual harassment. The Act also states that the protection against sexual harassment and the right to work with dignity are universally recognized human rights by international conventions and instruments such as Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women, which has been ratified on the 25th June, 1993 by the Government of India.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2013]] introduced changes to the [[Indian Penal Code]], making sexual harassment an expressed offense under Section 354 A, which is punishable up to three years of imprisonment and or with fine. The Amendment also introduced new sections making acts like disrobing a woman without consent, stalking and sexual acts by person in authority an offense.

====Israel====
The 1998 Israeli Sexual Harassment Law interprets sexual harassment broadly, and prohibits the behavior as a discriminatory practice, a restriction of liberty, an offense to human dignity, a violation of every person's right to elementary respect, and an infringement of the right to privacy. Additionally, the law prohibits intimidation or retaliation thus related to sexual harassment are defined by the law as "prejudicial treatment".&lt;ref name="Kamir"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kamir | first1 = Orit | year = | title = Israel's 1998 Sexual Harassment Law: Prohibiting Sexual Harassment, Sexual Stalking, and Degradation Based on Sexual Orientation in the Workplace and in all Social Settings | url = http://sitemaker.umich.edu/Orit_Kamir/files/sexharas2.pdf | format = PDF | journal = International Journal of Discrimination and Law | volume = 2005 | issue = 7| pages = 315–336 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sexual Harassment, or ''sekuhara'' in Japanese, appeared most dramatically in Japanese discourse in 1989, when a court case in Fukuoka ruled in favor of a woman who had been subjected to the spreading of sexual rumors by a co-worker. When the case was first reported, it spawned a flurry of public interest: 10 books were published, including English-language feminist guidebooks to ‘how not to harass women’ texts for men.&lt;ref name=Huen&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Huen|first1=Y|title=Workplace Sexual Harassment in Japan: A Review of Combating Measures Taken|journal=Asian Survey|date=2007|volume=47|issue=5|pages=811–827|doi=10.1525/as.2007.47.5.811|url=http://as.ucpress.edu/content/47/5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sekuhara was named 1989’s ‘Word of the Year.’ The case was resolved in the victim’s favor in 1992, awarding her about $13,000 in damages, the first sexual harassment lawsuit in Japanese history.&lt;ref name=MacGregor&gt;{{Cite newspaper|last1=MacGregor|first1=Hillary|title=In Japan, Many Men Just Don't Get It : Nation only got word for sexual harassment after '89 court case.|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1995-10-13/news/mn-56533_1_sexual-harassment/2|journal=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=26 October 2015|date=13 October 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Laws then established two forms of sexual harassment: ''daisho'', in which rewards or penalties are explicitly linked to sexual acts, and ''kankyo'', in which the environment is made unpleasant through sexual talk or jokes, touching, or hanging sexually explicit posters. This applies to everyone in an office, including customers.&lt;ref name=Huen /&gt;

====Pakistan====
Pakistan has promulgated harassment law in 2010 with nomenclature as "The Protection Against Harassment of Women at The Workplace Act, 2010".
This law defines the act of harassment in following terms.
"Harassment means any unwelcome sexual advance, request for sexual favors or other verbal or written communication or physical conduct of a sexual nature or sexually demeaning attitude, causing interference with work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile or offensive work environment, or the attempt to punish the complainant for refusal to such a request or is made a condition for employment."
Pakistan has adopted a Code of Conduct for Gender Justice in the Workplace that will deal with cases of sexual harassment. The Alliance Against Sexual Harassment At workplace (AASHA) announced they would be working with the committee to establish guidelines for the proceedings. AASHA defines sexual harassment much the same as it is defined in the U.S. and other cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aasha.org.pk/ |title=Alliance Against Sexual Harassment |publisher=AASHA |accessdate=2012-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Philippines====
The Anti-Sexual Harassment Act of 1995 was enacted:

&lt;blockquote&gt;primarily to protect and respect the dignity of workers, employees, and applicants for employment as well as students in educational institutions or training centers. This law, consisting of ten sections, provides for a clear definition of work, education or training-related sexual harassment and specifies the acts constituting sexual harassment. It likewise provides for the duties and liabilities of the employer in cases of sexual harassment, and sets penalties for violations of its provisions. It is to be noted that a victim of sexual harassment is not barred from filing a separate and independent action for damages and other relief aside from filing the charge for sexual harassment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://filipiniana.net/read_content.jsp?filename=L00000000018 |title=Republic Act No. 7877 Anti Sexual Harassment Act of 1995 |publisher=Filipiniana.net |accessdate=2012-10-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120713063240/http://filipiniana.net/read_content.jsp?filename=L00000000018 |archivedate=2012-07-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Evolution of sexual harassment law====

=====Workplace=====
{{main|Sexual harassment in the workplace in the United States}}

In the United States, the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] prohibits [[employment discrimination]] based on [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[sex]], [[color]], [[national origin]] or [[religion]]. Initially intended to only combat sexual harassment of females, {42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2} the prohibition of [[sex discrimination]] covers males and females. This discrimination occurs when the sex of the worker is made as a condition of employment (i.e. all female waitpersons or male carpenters) or where this is a job requirement that does not mention sex but ends up preventing many more persons of one sex than the other from the job (such as height and weight limits).

Train]]'' (1974) is commonly viewed as the first sexual harassment case in America, even though the term "sexual harassment" was not used.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wendymcelroy.com/ifeminists/2004/1027.html The Sad Evolution of Sexual Harassment] October 27, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; The term "sexual harassment" was coined and popularized by [[Lin Farley]] in 1975, based on a pattern she recognized during a 1974 [[Cornell University]] class she taught on women and work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=MacKinnon|first1=Catharine A.|last2=Siegel|first2=Reva I.|title=Directions in Sexual Harassment Law|url=https://books.google.com/?id=IhYip0PqV4EC&amp;pg=PA8&amp;dq=lin+farley#v=onepage&amp;q=lin%20farley&amp;f=false|year=2004|publisher=Yale University|isbn=978-0-300-09800-6|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1976, ''[[Williams v. Saxbe]]'' established sexual harassment as a form of sex discrimination when sexual advances by a male supervisor towards a female employee, if proven, would be deemed an artificial barrier to employment placed before one gender and not another. In 1980 the [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]] (EEOC) issued regulations defining sexual harassment and stating it was a form of sex discrimination prohibited by the Civil Rights Act of 1964. In the 1986 case of ''[[Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson]]'', the Supreme Court first recognized "sexual harassment" as a violation of Title VII, established the standards for analyzing whether the conduct was welcome and levels of employer [[legal liability|liability]], and that speech or conduct in itself can create a "[[hostile environment sexual harassment|hostile environment]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{caselaw source |case=''Meritor Savings Bank v.

Vinson]], reported sexual harassment cases grew from 10 cases being registered by the [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission|EEOC]] per year before 1986 to 624 case being reported in the subsequent following year.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sexual harassment and the law : the Mechelle Vinson case|last=1946-|first=Cochran, Augustus B.,|date=2004|publisher=University Press of Kansas|isbn=978-0700613236|location=Lawrence, Kan.|oclc=53284947}}&lt;/ref&gt; This number of reported cases to the EEOC rose to 2,217 in 1990 and then 4,626 by 1995.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

The [[Civil Rights Act of 1991]] added provisions to Title VII protections including expanding the rights of women to sue and collect compensatory and punitive [[damages]] for sexual discrimination or harassment, and the case of ''Ellison v. Brady'' resulted in rejecting the [[reasonable person]] standard in favor of the "reasonable woman standard" which allowed for cases to be analyzed from the perspective of the complainant and not the defendant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://shsf.invisionzone.com/index.php?showtopic%3D445 |title=Sexual Harassment Support Forum |accessdate=2006-07-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070310223845/http://shsf.invisionzone.com/index.php?showtopic=445 |archivedate=2007-03-10 |df= }}{{full citation needed|date=December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 1991, ''[[Jenson v. Eveleth Taconite Co.]]'' became the first sexual harassment case to be given [[class action]] status paving the way for others. Seven years later, in 1998, through that same case, new precedents were established that increased the limits on the "[[Discovery (law)|discovery]]" process in sexual harassment cases, that then allowed psychological injuries from the [[litigation]] process to be included in assessing damages awards. In the same year, the courts concluded in ''Faragher v. City of Boca Raton, Florida'', and ''[[Burlington v. Ellerth]]'', that employers are liable for harassment by their employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=000&amp;invol=97-282 |title=U.S Supreme Court: Beth Ann Faragher, petitioner v.

Ellerth |publisher=FindLaw |date=June 26, 1998 |accessdate=2012-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, ''[[Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Services]]'' set the precedent for same-sex harassment, and sexual harassment without motivation of "sexual desire", stating that any discrimination based on sex is actionable so long as it places the victim in an objectively disadvantageous working condition, regardless of the gender of either the victim, or the harasser.

In the 2006 case of ''[[Burlington Northern &amp; Santa Fe Railway Co. v. White]]'', the standard for retaliation against a sexual harassment complainant was revised to include any adverse employment decision or treatment that would be likely to dissuade a "reasonable worker" from making or supporting a charge of discrimination.

During 2007 alone, the ''U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission'' and related state agencies received 12,510 new charges of sexual harassment on the job.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Marshall |first=David |title=Sexual Harassment Law: A Brief Introduction for New Practitioners |url=http://www.kmblegal.com/index.php/160/Sexual_Harassment_Law_A_Brief_Introduction_for_New_Practitioners |publisher=Katz, Marshall &amp; Banks |accessdate=18 March 2011 |author2=Andronici, Justine |date=23 October 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090203063912/http://www.kmblegal.com/index.php/160/Sexual_Harassment_Law_A_Brief_Introduction_for_New_Practitioners |archivedate=3 February 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2010 case, [[Reeves v. C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.]] ruled that a hostile work environment can be created in a workplace where sexually explicit language and [[pornography]] are present. A [[hostile workplace]] may exist even if it is not targeted at any particular employee.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.employmentlawblog.info/2010/01/reeves-v-ch-robinson-worldwide-inc-no-07-10270-11th-cir-jan-20-2010.shtml|title=Reeves v.

From 2010 through 2016, approximately 17% of sexual harassment complaints filed with the EEOC were made by men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Charges Alleging Sex-Based Harassment (Charges filed with EEOC) FY 2010 - FY 2016|url=https://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/statistics/enforcement/sexual_harassment_new.cfm|website=Equal Employment Opportunity Commission|accessdate=15 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Education=====
{{main|Sexual harassment in education in the United States}}
[[Title IX]] of the Education Amendments of 1972 (United States) states "No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance."

In ''Franklin v. Gwinnett County Public Schools'' (1992), the U.S. Supreme Court held that private citizens could collect damage awards when teachers sexually harassed their students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0503_0060_ZS.html |title=Franklin v. Gwinnett County Public Schools |publisher=Legal Information Institute |date=February 26, 1992 |accessdate=2012-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Bethel School District No. 403 v. Fraser'' (1986) the courts ruled that schools have the power to discipline students if they use "obscene, profane language or gestures" which could be viewed as substantially interfering with the educational process, and inconsistent with the "fundamental values of public school education."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Doug Linder |url=http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/firstamendment/bethel.html |title=Bethel School District v. Fraser |publisher=Law.umkc.edu |accessdate=2012-10-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Under regulations issued in 1997 by the U.S. [[United States Department of Education|Department of Education]], which administers [[Title IX]], school districts should be held responsible for harassment by educators if the harasser "was aided in carrying out the sexual harassment of students by his or her position of authority with the institution."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/sexhar00.html |title=Sexual Harassment Guidance |publisher=Office for Civil Rights |accessdate=2012-10-07|date=2018-09-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Davis v. Monroe County Board of Education'', and ''Murrell v. School Dist. No. 1'', 1999, schools were assigned liability for peer-to-peer sexual harassment if the plaintiff sufficiently demonstrated that the administration's response shows "deliberate indifference" to "actual knowledge" of discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=000&amp;invol=97-843 |title=Davis v.

====Additionally====
There are a number of legal options for a complainant in the U.S.: [[mediation]], filing with the EEOC or filing a claim under a [[U.S. state|state]] Fair Employment Practices (FEP) statute (both are for workplace sexual harassment), filing a common law [[tort]], etc.&lt;ref name="whattodo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.feminist.org/911/harasswhatdo.html |title=Sexual Harassment Fact Sheet: What to Do if You or Someone You Know is Sexually Harassed |publisher=Feminist Majority Foundation |accessdate=2012-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not all sexual harassment will be considered severe enough to form the basis for a legal claim. However, most often there are several types of harassing behaviors present, and there is no minimum level for harassing conduct under the law.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;  The section below "EEOC Definition" describes the legal definitions that have been created for sexual harassment in the workplace. Definitions similar to the EEOC definition have been created for academic environments in the U.S. Department of Education Sexual Harassment Guidance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/shguide.html |title=Revised Sexual Harassment Guidance |publisher=Office for Civil Rights, U.S. Department of Education |date=January 19, 2001 |accessdate=2012-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====EEOC Definition====
The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission claims that it is unlawful to harass an applicant or employee of any sex in the workplace. The harassment could include sexual harassment. The EEOC says that the victim and harasser could be any gender and that the other does not have to be of the opposite sex. The law does not ban offhand comments, simple teasing, or incidents that aren't very serious. If the harassment gets to the point where it creates a harsh work environment, it will be taken care of.&lt;ref name="eeoc"/&gt; In 1980, the [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]] produced a set of guidelines for defining and enforcing Title VII (in 1984 it was expanded to include educational institutions). The EEOC defines sexual harassment as:

Unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, or other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature when:
# Submission to such conduct was made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of an individual's employment,
# Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual was used as the basis for employment decisions affecting such individual, or
# Such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual's work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment.

1. and 2. are called "[[quid pro quo]]" (Latin for "this for that" or "something for something"). They are essentially "sexual bribery", or promising of benefits, and "sexual coercion".

Type 3. known as "[[hostile work environment]]", is by far the most common form. This form is less clear cut and is more subjective.&lt;ref name="webcom" /&gt;

'''Note:''' a workplace harassment complainant ''must'' file with the EEOC and receive a "right to sue" clearance, before they can file a lawsuit against a company in federal court.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

=====''Quid pro quo'' sexual harassment=====
[[File:Stop à la violence sexiste au travail.jpg|thumb|right|[[International Trade Union Confederation]] (2015-2017).]]
Quid pro quo means "this for that". In the workplace, this occurs when a job benefit is directly tied to an employee submitting to unwelcome sexual advances. For example, a supervisor promises an employee a raise if he or she will go out on a date with him or her, or tells an employee he or she will be fired if he or she doesn't sleep with him or her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abanet.org/publiced/practical/sexualharassment_quidproquo.html |title=The Law &amp; Your Job: What is quid pro quo harassment? |publisher=American Bar Association |accessdate=2012-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Quid pro quo harassment also occurs when an employee makes an evaluative decision, or provides or withholds professional opportunities based on another employee's submission to verbal, nonverbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature. Quid pro quo harassment is equally unlawful whether the victim resists and suffers the threatened harm or submits and thus avoids the threatened harm.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sexualharassmentsupport.org/SHworkplace.html Sexual Harassment In The Workplace] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060708062743/http://www.sexualharassmentsupport.org/SHworkplace.html |date=July 8, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====''Hostile environment'' sexual harassment=====
{{Main|Hostile work environment}}
This occurs when an employee is subjected to comments of a sexual nature, unwelcome physical contact, or offensive sexual materials as a regular part of the work environment. For the most part, a single isolated incident will not be enough to prove hostile environment harassment unless it involves extremely outrageous and egregious conduct. The courts will try to decide whether the conduct is both "serious" and "frequent." Supervisors, managers, co-workers and even customers can be responsible for creating a hostile environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abanet.org/publiced/practical/sexualharassment_hostileenvironment.html |title=The Law &amp; Your Job: What is hostile environment harassment? |publisher=American Bar Association |accessdate=2012-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The line between "[[quid pro quo]]" and "hostile environment" harassment is not always clear and the two forms of harassment often occur together. For example, an employee's job conditions are affected when a sexually hostile work environment results in a constructive discharge. At the same time, a supervisor who makes sexual advances toward a subordinate employee may communicate an implicit threat to retaliate against her if she does not comply.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eeoc.gov/policy/docs/currentissues.html Policy Guidance on Current Issues of Sexual Harassment] 03/19/90&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Hostile environment" harassment may acquire characteristics of "quid pro quo" harassment if the offending supervisor abuses his authority over employment decisions to force the victim to endure or participate in the sexual conduct. Sexual harassment may culminate in a retaliatory discharge if a victim tells the harasser or her employer she will no longer submit to the harassment, and is then fired in retaliation for this protest. Under these circumstances it would be appropriate to conclude that both harassment and retaliation in violation of section 704(a) of Title VII have occurred."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=====Sexual orientation discrimination=====
In the United States, there are no federal laws prohibiting discrimination against employees based on their sexual orientation. However, [[Executive Order 13087]], signed by President Bill Clinton, outlaws discrimination based on sexual orientation against federal government employees. If a small business owner owns his or her business in a state where there is a law against sexual orientation discrimination, the owner must abide to the law regardless of there not being a federal law. Twenty states and the District of Columbia have laws against this form of discrimination in the workplace. These states include California, Connecticut, Colorado, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Non-Discrimination Laws|url=http://www.lgbtmap.org/equality-maps/non_discrimination_laws|website=MAP|publisher=Movement Advancement Project|accessdate=15 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, California has laws in place to protect employees who may have been discriminated against based upon sexual orientation or perceived sexual orientation. California law prohibits discrimination against those "with traits not stereotypically associated with their gender", such as mannerisms, appearance, or speech. Sexual orientation discrimination comes up, for instance, when employers enforce a dress code, permit women to wear makeup but not men, or require men and women to only use restrooms designated for their particular sex regardless of whether they are transgender.

=====Retaliation=====
Retaliation has occurred when an employee suffers a ''negative action'' after he or she has made a report of sexual harassment, file a grievance, assist someone else with a complaint, or participate in discrimination prevention activities. Negative actions can include being fired, demotion, suspension, denial of promotion, poor evaluation, unfavorable job reassignment—any adverse employment decision or treatment that would be likely to dissuade a "reasonable worker" from making or supporting a charge of discrimination. (See ''Burlington Northern &amp; Santa Fe Railway Co. v. White''.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://docket.medill.northwestern.edu/archives/003256.php |title=Burlington Northern &amp; Santa Fe Railway Co. v. White, Sheila |accessdate=2006-07-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060614052101/http://docket.medill.northwestern.edu/archives/003256.php |archivedate=2006-06-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Retaliation is as illegal as the sexual harassment itself, but also as difficult to prove. Also, retaliation is illegal even if the original charge of sexual harassment was not proven.

== Historical antecedents ==

=== Ancient Rome ===
In [[ancient Rome]], according to [[List of Fellows of the American Academy in Rome 1896 – 1970|Bruce W. Frier]] and [[List of Fellows of the American Academy in Rome 1971 – 1990|Thomas A.J. McGinn]], what is now called ''sexual harassment''&lt;ref name="CasebkRomanFamL-FrierMcGinn-p468"&gt;Frier, Bruce W., &amp; Thomas A.J. McGinn, ''A Casebook on Roman Family Law'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, [pbk.] 2004 ({{ISBN|0-19-516186-6}})), p.&amp;nbsp;468 (author Frier prof. classics &amp; Roman law, Univ. of Michigan, &amp; coauthor McGinn assoc. prof. classical studies, Vanderbilt Univ.).&lt;/ref&gt; was then any of ''accosting'', ''stalking'', and ''abducting''. ''Accosting'' was "harassment through attempted seduction"&lt;ref name="CasebkRomanFamL-FrierMcGinn-p468" /&gt; or {{Nowrap|"assault[ing]}} another's chastity with smooth talk&amp;nbsp;... contrary to good morals",&lt;ref name="CasebkRomanFamL-FrierMcGinn-p468" /&gt; which was more than the lesser offense(s) of "obscene speech, dirty jokes, and the like",&lt;ref name="CasebkRomanFamL-FrierMcGinn-p468" /&gt; "foul language",&lt;ref name="CasebkRomanFamL-FrierMcGinn-p468" /&gt; and "clamor",&lt;ref name="CasebkRomanFamL-FrierMcGinn-p468" /&gt; with the accosting of "respectable young girls" who however were dressed in slaves' clothing being a lesser offense&lt;ref name="CasebkRomanFamL-FrierMcGinn-p468" /&gt; and the accosting of "women&amp;nbsp;... dressed as prostitutes" being an even lesser offense.&lt;ref name="CasebkRomanFamL-FrierMcGinn-p468" /&gt; ''Stalking'' was "silently, persistently pursuing"&lt;ref name="CasebkRomanFamL-FrierMcGinn-p468" /&gt; if it was "contrary to good morals",&lt;ref name="CasebkRomanFamL-FrierMcGinn-pp468-469"&gt;Frier, Bruce W., &amp; Thomas A.J. McGinn, ''A Casebook on Roman Family Law'', ''op. cit.'', pp.&amp;nbsp;468–469.&lt;/ref&gt; because a pursuer's "ceaseless presence virtually ensures appreciable disrepute".&lt;ref name="CasebkRomanFamL-FrierMcGinn-p468" /&gt; ''Abducting'' an attendant, who was someone who follows someone else as a companion and could be a slave,&lt;ref name="CasebkRomanFamL-FrierMcGinn-p469"&gt;Frier, Bruce W., &amp; Thomas A.J. McGinn, ''A Casebook on Roman Family Law'', ''op. cit.'', p.&amp;nbsp;469.&lt;/ref&gt; was "successfully forcing or persuading the attendant to leave the side of the intended target",&lt;ref name="CasebkRomanFamL-FrierMcGinn-p469" /&gt; but abducting while the woman "has not been wearing respectable clothing" was a lesser offense.&lt;ref name="CasebkRomanFamL-FrierMcGinn-p468" /&gt;

== Criticism ==
Though the phrase ''sexual harassment'' is generally acknowledged to include clearly damaging and morally deplorable behavior, its boundaries can be broad and controversial. Accordingly, misunderstandings can occur. In the US, sexual harassment law has been criticized by persons such as the [[criminal defense lawyer]] [[Alan Dershowitz]] and the legal writer and [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] [[Eugene Volokh]], for imposing limits on the right to [[free speech]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Volokh |first=Eugene |url=http://www.law.ucla.edu/volokh/harass/ |title=Freedom of Speech vs. Workplace Harassment Law — A Growing Conflict |publisher=UCLA Law School |accessdate=2012-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jana Rave, professor in organizational studies at the [[Queen's School of Business]], criticized sexual harassment policy in the ''[[Ottawa Business Journal]]'' as helping maintain archaic stereotypes of women as "delicate, asexual creatures" who require special protection when at the same time complaints are lowering company profits.&lt;ref name="janaraver"&gt;Esau, Jeff. [http://www.obj.ca/Other/Archives/2005-08-10/article-2233666/Sexual-harassment%3A-Poisoning-profit-prospects/1 Sexual harassment: Poisoning profit prospects] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020062419/http://www.obj.ca/Other/Archives/2005-08-10/article-2233666/Sexual-harassment%3A-Poisoning-profit-prospects/1 |date=2012-10-20 }} &lt;!-- prev. journal link http://www.ffeusa.org/html/statements/statements_harassment.html --&gt;, ''[[Ottawa Business Journal]]'', August 10, 2005. Retrieved on March 3, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; [[Camille Paglia]] says that young girls can end up acting in such ways as to make sexual harassment easier, such that for example, by acting "nice" they can become a target. Paglia commented in an interview with ''[[Playboy]]'', "Realize the degree to which your niceness may invoke people to say lewd and pornographic things to you--sometimes to violate your niceness. The more you blush, the more people want to do it."&lt;ref&gt;[http://privat.ub.uib.no/bubsy/playboy.htm Playboy interview, Camille Paglia] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060622065038/http://privat.ub.uib.no/bubsy/playboy.htm |date=June 22, 2006 }} May 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

Other critics assert that sexual harassment is a very serious problem, but current views focus too heavily on sexuality rather than on the type of conduct that undermines the ability of women or men to work together effectively. Viki Shultz, a law professor at [[Yale University]] comments, "Many of the most prevalent forms of harassment are designed to maintain work—particularly the more highly rewarded lines of work—as bastions of male competence and authority."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaup.org/publications/Academe/1998/98so/SO98Alg.HTM Love, Lust, and the Law Sexual Harassment in the Academy] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060203104653/http://www.aaup.org/publications/Academe/1998/98so/SO98Alg.HTM |date=February 3, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Feminist [[Jane Gallop]] sees this evolution of the definition of sexual harassment as coming from a "split" between what she calls "[[power feminist]]s" who are [[pro-sex]] (like herself) and what she calls "[[victim feminist]]s", who are not. She argues that the split has helped lead to a ''perversion'' of the definition of sexual harassment, which used to be about sexism but has come to be about anything that's sexual.&lt;ref&gt;Gallop, Jane. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=V1ZKUQtIVWEC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Feminist Accused of Sexual Harassment]''.{{page needed|date=October 2012}} Duke University Press, 1997. {{ISBN|978-0-8223-1918-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also concern over abuses of sexual harassment policy by individuals as well as by employers and administrators using false or frivolous accusations as a way of expelling employees they want to eliminate for other reasons. These employees often have virtually no recourse thanks to the [[at-will]] law in most US states.&lt;ref&gt;Westhues, Kenneth. ''Eliminating Professors: A Guide to the Dismissal Process''. Lewiston, NY: The Edwin Mellen Press, 1998. {{ISBN|978-0-7734-8210-4}}.{{page needed|date=October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

O'Donohue and Bowers outlined 14 possible pathways to false allegations of sexual harassment: "lying, borderline personality disorder, histrionic personality disorder, psychosis, gender prejudice, substance abuse, dementia, false memories, false interpretations, biased interviews, sociopathy, personality disorders not otherwise specified."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/jip.43 |title=Pathways to false allegations of sexual harassment |year=2006 |last1=O'Donohue |first1=William |last2=Bowers |first2=Adrian H. |journal=Journal of Investigative Psychology and Offender Profiling |volume=3 |pages=47–74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also discussion of whether some recent trends towards more revealing clothing and permissive habits have created a more sexualized general environment, in which some forms of communication are unfairly labeled harassment, but are simply a reaction to greater sexualization in everyday environments.&lt;ref&gt;Parker, Kathleen. "[http://www.nydailynews.com/lifestyle/2008/06/30/2008-06-30_save_the_males_ho_culture_lights_fuses_b.html 'Save the males': Ho culture lights fuses, but confuses]." ''New York Daily News''.

There are many debates about how organizations should deal with sexual harassment. Some observers feel strongly that organizations should be held to a zero tolerance standard of "Must report - must investigate - must punish."

Others write that those who feel harassed should in most circumstances have a choice of options.&lt;ref name="maryrowe"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DoiBFMissing" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rowe|first=Mary|title=Negotiations and Change: From the Workplace to Society|year=2003|publisher=ILR Press|location=Ithaca, N.Y.

The '''Silver Branch''' or '''Silver Bough''' ({{Lang-ga|An Craobh Airgid}}) is a symbol found in [[Irish mythology]] and literature.

Featured in the Irish poem [[The Voyage of Bran]], it represents entry into the [[Celtic Otherworld]], which the Welsh called [[Annwn]] and the Irish [[Tír na nÓg]]: "To enter the Otherworld before the appointed hour marked by death, a passport was often necessary, and this was usually a silver branch of the sacred apple-tree bearing blossoms." &lt;ref&gt;Cf. Eleanor Hull, The Silver Bough in Irish Legend, in Folk-Lore, xii.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Extract from Gods of the Celts, published by Dalriada Publications – http://www.manannan.net/library/godofthecelts.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MacKillop1"&gt;James MacKillop, ''Dictionary of Celtic Mythology'', Oxford, Oxford University Press, 1998, pp.21, 205, 270, 322–3, 346, 359–60. {{ISBN|0-19-280120-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The branch is also associated with [[Manannán mac Lir]], an Irish [[water deity|sea deity]] with strong affiliation to Tír na nÓg. As guardian of the Otherworld, Manannán also has strong ties with [[Emhain Abhlach]], the Isle of Apple Trees, where the magical silver apple branch is found. Both the branch and Manannán are featured in ''[[His Three Calls to Cormac]]'', or "[[Cormac mac Airt|Cormac's]] Adventure in the Land of Promise." Here, he appeared at Cormac's ramparts (at [[Tara, Ireland|Tara]]) in the guise of a warrior who told him he came from a land where old age, sickness, death, decay, and falsehood were unknown (Tír na nÓg). The king was given a "branch of silver with three [[golden apple]]s on his shoulder. Delight and amusement to the full was it to listen to the music of that branch, for men sore wounded, or women in child-bed, or folk in sickness, would fall asleep at the melody when that branch was shaken."&lt;ref&gt;This tale exists in several manuscripts of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries; i. e. Book of Ballymote, and Yellow Book of Lecan, as edited and translated by Stokes, in Irische Texts, III. i. 183–229; cf. Voy. of Bran, i. 190 ff.; cf. Le Cycle Myth. Irl., pp. 326–33.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Part I Book IV: His Three Calls to Cormac – http://www.manannan.net/library/Lady%20Gregory/His%20Three%20Calls%20to%20Cormac.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gregory1"&gt;Gregory, Lady Augusta (1903) [http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/celt/gafm/gafm21.htm online "Part I Book IV: His Three Calls to Cormac"] in ''Gods and Fighting Men''. Buckinghamshire, Colyn Smyth&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, Joseph. "The Fate of the Children of Lir." More Celtic Fairy Tales. Illustrated by John D. Batten.

Yeats (1905) – Chapter XI. His Three Calls to Cormac – https://www.gutenberg.org/files/14465/14465-h/14465-h.htm#L22&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, in [[Immacallam in dá Thuarad]], or ''The Dialogue of the two Sages'', the mystic symbol used by [[gods]], [[fairies]], [[Magician (paranormal)|magicians]], and by all initiates who know the mystery of life and death, is thus described as a [[Druid]] symbol:–'Neidhe' (a young [[bard]] who aspired to succeed his father as chief poet of [[Ulster]]), "made his journey with a silver branch over him.&lt;ref&gt;Among the early ecclesiastical manuscripts of the so-called Prophecies. See E. O'Curry, Lectures, p. 383.&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=January 2014}} The [[Anradhs]], or poets of the second order, carried a silver branch, but the [[Ollamhs]], or chief poets, carried a branch of gold; all other poets bore a branch of bronze."&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Eleanor Hull, op. cit., pp. 439–40.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Colloquy of the Two Sages. ed. and trans. by Whitley Stokes. Paris: Librairie Emile Bouillon, 1905. – http://www.maryjones.us/ctexts/colloquy.html#4&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
*The Silver Bough is a work on Celtic folklore by [[F. Marian McNeill|Florence Marian McNeill]], a [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[folklore|folklorist]].
*[[The Silver Branch (Sutcliff novel)|''The Silver Branch'']] is the title of the second book in [[Rosemary Sutcliff]]'s children's book series ''The Roman Britain Trilogy''.&lt;ref&gt;The Silver Branch (The Roman Britain Trilogy) - https://www.amazon.com/Silver-Branch-Roman-Britain-Trilogy/dp/0312644310&lt;/ref&gt;
*The Silver Bough is also the title of a 1948 novel by Scottish novelist [[Neil M. Gunn]]. He references frequently the Silver Bough song sung by the protagonist's landlady and the protagonist has a musical silver bough with gold apples crafted for the landlady's granddaughter

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9567">'''Social disruption''' is a term used in [[sociology]] to describe the alteration, dysfunction or breakdown of [[social relation|social life]], often in a community setting. Social disruption implies a  radical transformation, in which the old certainties of modern society are falling away and something quite new is emerging.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/921994898|title=The metamorphosis of the world|last=1944-2015,|first=Beck, Ulrich,|isbn=9780745690216|location=Cambridge|oclc=921994898}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social disruption might be caused through natural disasters, massive human displacements, rapid economic, technological and demographic change but also due to controversial policy-making.

Social disruptions are for example rising sea levels that are creating new landscapes, drawing new world maps whose key lines are not traditional boundaries between nation-states but elevations above sea level. On the local level, an example would be the closing of a community grocery store, which might cause social disruption in a [[community]] by removing a "meeting ground" for community members to develop [[interpersonal relationships]] and community [[social solidarity|solidarity]].

== Results of social disruption ==
''"We are wandering aimlessly and dispassionately, arguing for and against, but the one statement on which we are, beyond all differences and over many continents, to be able to agree on, is: "I can no longer understand the world''".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Social disruptions often lead to five social symptoms: [[Frustration]], Democratic Disconnection, [[Fragmentation (sociology)|Fragmentation]], [[Polarization (politics)|Polarization]] and [[Conflict escalation|Escalation]]. Studies from the last decade show, that our societies have become more fragmented and less coherent (e.g. Bishop 2008), neighbourhoods turning into little states, organizing themselves to defend the local politics and culture against outsiders (Walzer 1983; Bauman 2017) and increasingly identifying through ways of voting, lifestyle or wellbeing (e.g. Schäfer 2015). Especially people on the more right and left political spectrum are more likely to say it is important to them to live in a place where most people share their political views and have similar interests (Pew 2014). Hence, citizens become alienated from democratic [[Consensus decision-making|consensus]] (Foa and Munk 2016; Levitsky and Ziblatt 2018) and tend to assume that their opponents believe more extreme things than they really do (Iyengar et al. 2012). Moreover, fear of being identified as unqualified, denied value and dignity and for that reason marginalized, excluded or outcast, is giving rise to a widespread disenchantment with the idea that the future will improve the human condition and a mistrust in the ability of nation-states to make this happen (Pew 2015; Bauman 2017). At the same time, accelerations in liberal progression, [[globalization]] and migration flows have led to increasing polarized contestations about national identities - a volatile and critical social state, prone to conflict escalation (e.g. hate crimes after [[Brexit]] vote, incident at [[Unite the Right rally|far-right rally]] in Charlottesville, USA).

== Policy making ==
''„It is unclear how to achieve policy changes of any kind in a polarized society that has few shared facts and whose civic muscles are atrophying.“'' &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/17/the-three-crises-of-liberal-democracy|title=The three crises of liberal democracy {{!}} Ganesh Sitaraman|last=Sitaraman|first=Ganesh|date=2018-03-17|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

International but also local challenges force our societies to find solutions and make decisions on controversial issues in an accelerated manner. The complexity of such decisions is not only mirrored in the aim to tackle a multi-causality of root causes, it also faces a high degree of uncertainty as regard to its impact. Hence, due to the growing separation between the world of [[public opinion]] on the one hand, and the world of [[problem solving]] on the other (Mair 2009), it is very likely that political decisions further polarize our societies. The explanation is that citizens evaluate disruptive developments and related policy changes on a two-way level, on the personal interests and comfort, as well on its perceived impact on their social identity and community (Ryan and Deci 2000; Haidt 2012). If a policy change reflects the substantive representation of the median voter, is something that just does not matter to citizens in regard to their [[Social acceptance|acceptance]] of decisions (Esaiasson et al. 2017). This can produce multi facet conflicts over interests, facts and norms between supporters and opponents (Itten 2017). Simultaneously, the capacity of [[political parties]] and actors of [[civil society]], to bridge that divide, is declining (Mair 2009). In such a situations, social psychology tells us that citizens who feel uncomfortable will hold tighter to the assumptions that make them feel secure (Podziba 2014). Especially in [[public policy]] disputes, parties are hardly giving up their assumptions voluntarily, and citizens begin to masquerade their true individual conflict of interest (e.g. devaluation of property; insecurity) with more normative conflict of interest (e.g. protection of nature; protection of culture). Such distorted behaviour remarkably increases at times citizens or communities feel that a policy change is threatening their way of living.

== Bridging social capital ==
In the light of the increasing social divisions and democratic disconnection, Putnam and Feldstein (2004) foresaw the importance of creating “bridging [[social capital]]”, e.g. ties that link groups across a greater social distance. As the authors elaborate, the creation of robust social capital takes time and effort. It develops largely through extensive and time-consuming face-to-face conversation between two individuals or small groups of people. Only then there is the chance to build the trust and mutual understanding that characterizes the foundation of social capital. In no way, Putnam and Feldstein write, it is possible to create social capital instantaneous, anonymous or en masse. Furthermore, building social capital among people who already share a reservoir of similar cultural referents, ethnicity, personal experience or moral identity etc. is qualitatively different. Homogeneity makes connective strategies easier, however, a society with only homogenous social capital risks looking like Bosnia or Belfast. Hence, bridging social capital is especially important for reconciling democracy and diversity. Yet, bridging social capital among diverse social group is intrinsically less likely to develop automatically.

Art by [[Oscar Jimenez (comics)|Oscar Jimenez]].]]

A '''speedster''' is a character whose powers primarily relate to '''superhuman speed'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; (also known as '''superspeed'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA; 'Superspeed (fiction)' redirects here--&gt;). Primary abilities shared by all speedsters include running at speeds far in excess of human capability (to varying degrees) and resistance to the side effects (air resistance, inability to breathe, dynamic shock resulting from contact with objects at high speed, etc.) that result from such velocity. In almost all cases, speedsters are able to physically attack opponents by striking them while at high speed to impart huge amounts of kinetic energy without suffering harm, although this has on rare occasion been [[wikt:lampshade#Verb|lampshaded]] by characters discovering that they cannot do this and suffering severe injury from the attempt. A variety of other powers have been attributed to speedsters depending on the story, the origin of the power, and the established continuity and rules of a given universe.

==Plausibility and artistic license==
The use of speedsters in fiction requires [[artistic license]] due to the laws of [[physics]] that would prohibit such abilities.  Moving at the speed of sound, for example, would create [[sonic boom]]s that are usually not heard in such stories.  An enormous amount of energy would be required to achieve such speeds, and as some speedsters can actually move close to or at the [[speed of light]], this would cause them to gain near-infinite mass, according to the laws of [[theory of relativity|relativity]].

For example, the ''[[Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe]]'' states that the character [[Nova (Richard Rider)|Nova]] maintains speeds which can be considered "modest," especially when carrying a passenger. The Handbook also concedes that a solid object moving in the Earth’s atmosphere at several times the speed of sound or faster would wreak havoc on the planet and that moving at such speeds would prohibit Northstar from breathing, while the generated wind/friction would ravage his body. On the other hand, the Handbook states that the character [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] was born with adaptations that make higher speeds possible, such as enhanced [[cardiovascular]], [[respiratory]], [[musculature]], and [[Digestion|digestive]] systems, a more efficient [[metabolism]] (which has been a weakness for some incarnations of [[The Flash (2014 TV series)|the Flash]], calling themselves "[[Justice League (film)|snack holes]]"), better lubricated joints, [[tendon]]s with the [[tensile strength]] of spring steel, unidentified bone composition that can withstand the dynamic shock of his touching the ground at speeds over 100 miles an hour, and a brain that can process information fast enough for him to react to his surroundings at high speed.&lt;ref&gt;''The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe'', by Mark Gruenwald and Peter Sanderson; Volume Five; Pages 55 &amp; 128.&lt;!-- Bibliographic information here is needed. --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In comics published by [[DC Comics]], the [[Flash (comics)|Flash]] family of speedsters derive their abilities from an [[Parallel universe (fiction)|extradimensional]] energy source known as the [[Speed Force (DC Comics)|Speed Force]], which grants them superspeed and various other abilities required to use it, such as durability.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cbr.com/speed-force-facts/&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Speed Force is not the source from which other DC characters with superspeed such as [[Superman]] or [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel/Shazam]] derive their powers.

Writer [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]] maintained modest abilities for the speedster character Danny Hilltop in his series ''[[John Byrne’s Next Men]]''.  Although Danny can keep pace with a race car, the friction generated by his speed melts any footwear he wears, burning his feet.  Thus he runs barefoot, having toughened the soles of his feet through a regimen of pounding increasingly harder materials (sand, gravel and then broken rock).&lt;ref&gt;John Byrne’s Next Men #7; September 1992&lt;/ref&gt;  The costume he wears has a built-in guidance system.

Other writers choose not to offer any scientific explanations for the questions raised by the actual use of such abilities.

Comic book writer [[Peter David]], whose run on the series ''[[Young Justice]]'' included the junior speedster [[Impulse (DC Comics)|Impulse]], has opined that speedsters are inherently difficult to write, saying:
{{cquote|Speedsters make me nervous, because if you play them accurately, they're impossible to beat...The moment someone sees him coming, it's too late.  You shout, "It's the Flash!" and you haven't even got "It's" out before you're done&lt;ref&gt;[http://peterdavid.malibulist.com/archives/000870.html Question and answer with Peter David]&lt;/ref&gt;...I could deal with Impulse because he was easily distracted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://peterdavid.malibulist.com/archives/000943.html Further discussion with Peter David]&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Some speedsters may also end up destroying their surroundings or entire astronomical structures around them by their sheer speed alone if they are not careful enough. For example, [[List of One-Punch Man characters#Saitama|Saitama]] from ''[[One-Punch Man]]'' accidentally destroyed a large portion of the Moon when he jumped back to Earth from it within ten seconds during his battle with [[List of One-Punch Man characters#Boros|Boros]].

==In other media==
[[File:Tachyon1.jpg|thumb|A [[webcomic]] speedster character.]]Speedsters in other media include [[Daphne Millbrook]] (played by Brea Grant), a character in the [[NBC]] television [[superhero]] drama ''[[Heroes (U.S. TV series)|Heroes]]''. Daphne first appeared in that series' third season in 2008, initially as a [[supervillain|villain]].&lt;ref&gt;The character is referred to as a "speedster" on Page 3 of the August 25, 2008 ''[[TV Guide]]'', and refers to herself as such in "[[The Second Coming (Heroes)|The Second Coming]]".&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, many characters exist in other media such as [[film]], [[video games]], [[anime]] and [[manga]] who possess the abilities to perform feats at incredible speeds that exceed the abilities of those around them.  Examples include the video game character [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic the Hedgehog]], and the animated cartoon characters [[Speedy Gonzales]], the [[Wile E. Coyote and Road Runner|Road Runner]], Morton of ''[[Horton Hears A Who! (film)|Horton Hears A Who!]]'', several [[Ben 10]] Aliens including [[List of Ben 10 aliens#XLR8|XLR8]], [[List of Ben 10 aliens#Jetray|Jetray]], and [[List of Ben 10 aliens#Fasttrack|Fasttrack]], [[List of My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic characters#Rainbow Dash|Rainbow Dash]] (and in one case, Pinkie Pie taking on an alter ego called 'Filisecond' in a comic book universe) from ''[[My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic]]'', [[Saitama (One Punch Man)|Saitama]], [[List of One-Punch Man characters#Speed o' Sound Sonic|Speed o' Sound Sonic]], [[List of One-Punch Man characters#Flashy Flash|Flashy Flash]] and several other characters of ''[[One-Punch Man]]'', several Stand users and almost all other characters from ''[[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure]]'', [[Goku]], [[Vegeta]], [[Frieza]], [[Beerus]], [[Whis]], [[List of Dragon Ball characters#Jiren|Jiren]] and practically every single character in the entire ''[[Dragon Ball]]'' franchise and [[Dashiell Robert Parr|Dash Parr]] of ''[[The Incredibles]]''. [[Lab Rats (U.S. TV series)#Cast and characters|Bree Davenport]], the superhero from ''[[Lab Rats (U.S. TV series)|Lab Rats]]'' is the one the characters depend on to take them to mission sights.

'''Stencil codes''' are a class of iterative [[GPGPU#Kernels|kernels]]&lt;ref name="Roth"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
which update [[Array data structure|array elements]] according to some fixed pattern, called a stencil.&lt;ref name="Sloot"&gt;
  Sloot, Peter M.A. et al. (May 28, 2002)

They are most commonly found in the [[Source code|codes]] of  [[computer simulation]]s, e.g. for [[computational fluid dynamics]] in the context of scientific and engineering applications. 
Other notable examples include solving [[partial differential equations]],&lt;ref name="Roth"/&gt; the [[Jacobi method|Jacobi]] kernel, the [[Gauss–Seidel method]],&lt;ref name="Sloot"/&gt; [[image processing]]&lt;ref name="Roth"/&gt; and [[Cellular automaton|cellular automata]].&lt;ref name="Fey"&gt;

The regular structure of the arrays sets stencil codes apart from other modeling methods such as the [[Finite element method]]. Most [[Finite difference method|finite difference codes]] which operate on regular grids can be formulated as stencil codes.

==Definition==
Stencil codes perform a sequence of sweeps (called timesteps) through a given array.&lt;ref name="Sloot"/&gt; Generally this is a 2- or 3-dimensional regular grid.&lt;ref name="Fey"/&gt; The elements of the arrays are often referred to as cells. In each timestep, the stencil code updates all array elements.&lt;ref name="Sloot"/&gt; Using neighboring array elements in a fixed pattern (called the stencil), each cell's new value is computed. In most cases boundary values are left unchanged, but in some cases (e.g. [[Lattice Boltzmann methods|LBM codes]]) those need to be adjusted during the computation as well. Since the stencil is the same for each element, the pattern of data accesses is repeated.&lt;ref&gt;
  Yang, Laurence T.; Guo, Minyi. (August 12, 2005) 
  ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=qA4DbnFB2XcC&amp;pg=PA221&amp;dq=Stencil+codes&amp;as_brr=3&amp;sig=H8wdKyABXT5P7kUh4lQGZ9C5zDk High-Performance Computing : Paradigm and Infrastructure.]'' 
  Page 221. Publisher: Wiley-Interscience. {{ISBN|0-471-65471-X}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

More formally, we may define stencil codes as a [[N-tuple|5-tuple]] &lt;math&gt;(I, S, S_0, s, T)&lt;/math&gt; with the following meaning:&lt;ref name="Fey"/&gt;

* &lt;math&gt;I = \prod_{i=1}^k [0, \ldots, n_i]&lt;/math&gt; is the index set. It defines the topology of the array.
* &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is the (not necessarily finite) set of states, one of which each cell may take on on any given timestep.
* &lt;math&gt;S_0\colon \Z^k \to S&lt;/math&gt; defines the initial state of the system at time 0.
* &lt;math&gt;s \in \prod_{i=1}^l \Z^k&lt;/math&gt; is the stencil itself and describes the actual shape of the neighborhood. There are &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; elements in the stencil.
* &lt;math&gt;T\colon S^l \to S&lt;/math&gt; is the transition function which is used to determine a cell's new state, depending on its neighbors.

Since ''I'' is a ''k''-dimensional integer interval, the array will always have the topology of a finite regular grid. The array is also called simulation space and individual cells are identified by their index &lt;math&gt;c \in I&lt;/math&gt;. The stencil is an ordered set of &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; relative coordinates. We can now obtain for each cell &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; the tuple of its neighbors indices &lt;math&gt;I_c&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;I_c = \{j \mid \exists x \in s: j = c + x\} \, &lt;/math&gt; 

Their states are given by mapping the tuple &lt;math&gt;I_c&lt;/math&gt; to the corresponding tuple of states &lt;math&gt;N_i(c)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;N_i\colon I \to S^l&lt;/math&gt; is defined as follows:

: &lt;math&gt;
N_i(c) = (s_1, \ldots, s_l) \text{ with } s_j = S_i(I_c(j)) \, 
&lt;/math&gt;

This is all we need to define the system's state for the following time steps &lt;math&gt;S_{i+1}\colon \Z^k \to S&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;i \in \N&lt;/math&gt;:

: &lt;math&gt;
S_{i+1}(c) = \begin{cases}T(N_i(c)), &amp; c \in I\\
                           S_i(c),    &amp; c \in \Z^k \setminus I  \end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

Note that &lt;math&gt;S_i&lt;/math&gt; is defined on &lt;math&gt;\Z^k&lt;/math&gt; and not just on &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; since the boundary conditions need to be set, too. Sometimes the elements of &lt;math&gt;I_c&lt;/math&gt; may be defined by a vector addition modulo the simulation space's dimension to realize toroidal topologies:

: &lt;math&gt;
I_c = \{j \mid \exists x \in s: j = ((c + x) \mod(n_1, \ldots,  n_k))\}
&lt;/math&gt; 

This may be useful for implementing [[periodic boundary conditions]], which simplifies certain physical models.

=== Example: 2D Jacobi iteration ===

[[File:2D von Neumann Stencil.svg|thumb|right|Data dependencies of a selected cell in the 2D array.]]

To illustrate the formal definition, we'll have a look at how a two dimensional [[Jacobi method|Jacobi]] iteration can be defined. The update function computes the arithmetic mean of a cell's four neighbors. In this case we set off with an initial solution of 0. The left and right boundary are fixed at 1, while the upper and lower boundaries are set to 0. After a sufficient number of iterations, the system converges against a saddle-shape.

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
I &amp; = [0, \ldots, 99]^2 \\
S &amp; = \R \\
S_0 &amp;: \Z^2 \to \R \\
S_0((x, y)) &amp; = \begin{cases}
1, &amp; x &lt; 0 \\
0, &amp; 0 \le x &lt; 100 \\
1, &amp; x \ge 100
        \end{cases}\\
s &amp; = ((0, -1), (-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, 1)) \\
T &amp;\colon \R^4 \to \R \\
T((x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4)) &amp; = 0.25 \cdot (x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4)
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

==Stencils==

The shape of the neighborhood used during the updates depends on the application itself. The most common stencils are the 2D or 3D versions of the [[von Neumann neighborhood]] and [[Moore neighborhood]]. The example above uses a 2D von Neumann stencil while LBM codes generally use its 3D variant. [[Conway's Game of Life]] uses the 2D Moore neighborhood. That said, other stencils such as a 25-point stencil for seismic wave propagation&lt;ref&gt;

==Implementation issues==
Many simulation codes may be formulated naturally as stencil codes. Since computing time and memory consumption grow linearly with the number of array elements, parallel implementations of stencil codes are of paramount importance to research.&lt;ref name="Datta"&gt;

  ''[http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~kdatta/pubs/EECS-2009-177.pdf Auto-tuning Stencil Codes for Cache-Based Multicore Platforms]'', 
  Ph.D. Thesis
&lt;/ref&gt; 
This is challenging since the computations are tightly coupled (because of the cell updates depending on neighboring cells) and most stencil codes are memory bound (i.e. the ratio of memory accesses to calculations is high).&lt;ref name="Wellein"&gt;
  Wellein, G et al. (2009)

  33rd Annual IEEE International Computer Software and Applications Conference, COMPSAC 2009
&lt;/ref&gt; 
Virtually all current parallel architectures have been explored for executing stencil codes efficiently;&lt;ref name="datta2"&gt;

  SC '08 Proceedings of the 2008 ACM/IEEE conference on Supercomputing
&lt;/ref&gt; 
at the moment [[GPGPU]]s have proven to be most efficient.&lt;ref name="schaefer"&gt;

  Proceedings of the International Conference on Computational Science, ICCS 2011
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Libraries==
Due to both the importance of stencil codes to [[computer simulation]]s and their high computational requirements, there are a number of efforts which aim at creating reusable libraries to support scientists in implementing new stencil codes. The libraries are mostly concerned with the parallelization, but may also tackle other challenges, such as IO, [[Computational steering|steering]] and [[Application checkpointing|checkpointing]]. They may be classified by their API.

===Patch-based libraries===
This is a traditional design. The library manages a set of ''n''-dimensional scalar arrays, which the user code may access to perform updates. The library handles the synchronization of the boundaries (dubbed ghost zone or halo). The advantage of this interface is that the user code may loop over the arrays, which makes it easy to integrate legacy codes&lt;ref name="walberla"&gt;
  S. Donath, J. Götz, C. Feichtinger, K. Iglberger and U. Rüde (2010)
  ''[http://www.springerlink.com/content/p2583237l2187374/ waLBerla: Optimization for Itanium-based Systems with Thousands of Processors]'',
  High Performance Computing in Science and Engineering, Garching/Munich 2009
&lt;/ref&gt;
. The disadvantage is that the library can not handle cache blocking (as this has to be done within the loops&lt;ref name="35dblocking"&gt;
  Nguyen, Anthony et al. (2010)
  ''[http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1884658 3.5-D Blocking Optimization for Stencil Computations on Modern CPUs and GPUs]'',
  SC '10 Proceedings of the 2010 ACM/IEEE International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis
&lt;/ref&gt;)
or wrapping of the code for accelerators (e.g. via CUDA or OpenCL). Notable implementations include [http://cactuscode.org/ Cactus], a physics problem solving environment, and [http://walberla.net/ waLBerla].

===Cell-based libraries===
These libraries move the interface to updating single simulation cells: only the current cell and its neighbors are exposed to the user code, e.g. via getter/setter methods. The advantage of this approach is that the library can control tightly which cells are updated in which order, which is useful not only to implement cache blocking,&lt;ref name=schaefer /&gt; 
but also to run the same code on multi-cores and GPUs.&lt;ref name="physis"&gt;
  Naoya Maruyama, Tatsuo Nomura, Kento Sato, and Satoshi Matsuoka (2011)
  ''Physis: An Implicitly Parallel Programming Model for Stencil Computations on Large-Scale GPU-Accelerated Supercomputers'',
  SC '11 Proceedings of the 2011 ACM/IEEE International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis
&lt;/ref&gt; This approach requires the user to recompile the source code together with the library. Otherwise a function call for every cell update would be required, which would seriously impair performance. This is only feasible with techniques such as [[Template (programming)|class templates]] or [[metaprogramming]], which is also the reason why this design is only found in newer libraries. Examples are [https://github.com/naoyam/physis Physis] and [http://www.libgeodecomp.org LibGeoDecomp].

'''Swatch Internet Time''' (or .'''beat time''') is a [[decimal time]] concept introduced in 1998 by the [[Swatch]] corporation as part of their marketing campaign for their line of "Beat" watches.

Instead of hours and minutes, the mean solar day is divided into 1000 parts called ".beats". Each .beat is equal to one decimal minute in the [[French Revolutionary calendar|French Revolutionary]] [[decimal time]] system and lasts 1 minute and 26.4 seconds (86.4 seconds) in standard time.  Times are notated as a 3-digit number out of 1000 after midnight.  So, @248 would indicate a time 248 .beats after midnight representing 248/1000 of a day, just over 5 hours and 57 minutes.

There are no time zones in Swatch Internet Time; instead, the new time scale of Biel Meantime (BMT) is used, based on Swatch's headquarters in [[Biel/Bienne|Biel]], Switzerland and equivalent to [[Central European Time]], West Africa Time, and [[UTC+01]].  Unlike civil time in Switzerland and many other countries, Swatch Internet Time does not observe [[daylight saving time]].

==History==
Swatch Internet Time was announced on October 23, 1998, in a ceremony at the Junior Summit '98, attended by [[Nicolas Hayek|Nicolas G. Hayek]], President and CEO of the Swatch Group, G.N. Hayek, President of Swatch Ltd., and [[Nicholas Negroponte]], founder and then-director of the [[MIT Media Lab]]. During the Summit, Swatch Internet Time became the official time system for [[Nation1]], an online country (supposedly) created and run by children.

===Uses===
[[File:SwatchBeat1.jpg|thumb|A Swatch watch showing .beat time in the bottom part of the display]]
During 1999, Swatch produced several models of watch, branded "Swatch .beat",  that displayed Swatch Internet Time as well as standard time, and even convinced a few websites (such as [[CNN.com]]) to use the new format.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In March 2001, [[Ericsson]] released the T20e, a [[mobile phone]] which gave the user the option of displaying Internet Time. Outside these areas, it is infrequently used. While Swatch still offers the concept on its website, it no longer markets beat watches.{{Citation needed |date=July 2015}} In July 2016, Swatch released Touch Zero Two, its second wirelessly connected watch, with Swatch Internet Time function.

===Beatnik satellite controversy===

In early 1999, Swatch began a marketing campaign about the launch of their Beatnik satellite, intended to service a set of Internet Time watches. They were criticized for planning to use an [[amateur radio]] frequency for broadcasting a commercial message (an act banned by international treaties). Swatch reallocated the transmitter batteries to a different function on the [[Mir|Mir space station]], thus the satellite never broadcast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==Description==
The concept was touted as an alternative, decimal measure of time. One of the supposed goals was to simplify the way people in different [[time zone]]s communicate about time, mostly by eliminating time zones altogether.

===Beats===
Instead of hours and minutes, the [[solar day|mean solar day]] is divided into 1,000 parts called ".beats". Each .beat lasts 1 minute and 26.4 seconds. One .beat is equal to one decimal minute in [[Decimal time#France|French decimal time]].

Although Swatch does not specify units smaller than one .beat, [[Third-party developer|third party]] implementations have extended the standard by adding "centibeats" or "sub-beats", for extended precision: @248.00. Each "centibeat" is a hundredth of a .beat and is therefore equal to one [[Decimal time#France|French decimal second]] (0.864 seconds).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Time zones===
There are no time zones; instead, the new time scale of Biel Meantime (BMT) is used, based on the company's headquarters in [[Biel/Bienne|Biel, Switzerland]]. Despite the name, BMT does not refer to mean [[solar time]] at the Biel [[meridian (geography)|meridian]] (7°15′E), but to the standard time there. It is equivalent to the [[Central European Time]] and [[West Africa Time]] or [[UTC]]+1.

Like UTC, Swatch Internet Time is the same throughout the world. For example, when the time is 875 .beats, or @875, in New York, it is also @875 in Tokyo: 0.875 × 24 hours = 21:00 BMT = 20:00 UTC. Unlike civil time in most European countries, Internet Time does not observe [[daylight saving time]] and thus it matches Central European Time during (European) winter and [[Western European Summer Time]], which is observed by the United Kingdom, Ireland, Portugal and the [[Canary Islands |Canary Islands (Spain)]], during summer.

===Notation===
The most distinctive aspect of Swatch Internet Time is its notation; as an example, "@248" would indicate a time 248 .beats after midnight, equivalent to a fractional day of 0.248 CET, or 04:57:07.2 UTC. No explicit format was provided for [[calendar date|dates]], although the Swatch website formerly displayed the [[Gregorian calendar]] date in the order day-month-year, separated by periods and prefixed by the letter ''d'' (d31.01.99).

===Time unit conversion===
{| class="wikitable"
! Unit !! Beat Conversion
|-
| 1 day || 1000 .beats
|-
| 1 hour || 41.6 .beats
|-
| 1 min || 0.694 .beats
|-
| 1 s || 0.011574 .beats
|}

Note that units smaller than 1 .beat are not officially recognized by the standard.

===Calculation from UTC+1===
The formula for calculating the current time in .beats from [[UTC]]+1 is:

    (UTC+1seconds + (UTC+1minutes * 60) + (UTC+1hours * 3600)) / 86.4

Round down the outcome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Temperance''' is  defined as [[moderation]] or voluntary self-restraint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Green | first=Joel | title=Dictionary of scripture and ethics | publisher=Baker Academic | location=Grand Rapids, Mich | year=2011 | isbn=978-0-8010-3406-0 | page=769}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is typically described in terms of what an individual voluntarily refrains from doing.&lt;ref name="Schwarzer 2012"/&gt; This includes restraint from retaliation in the form of non-violence and forgiveness, restraint from arrogance in the form of humility and modesty, restraint from excesses such as splurging now in the form of prudence, and restraint from excessive anger or craving for something in the form of calmness and self-control.&lt;ref name="Schwarzer 2012"&gt;{{cite book | last=Schwarzer | first=Ralf | title=Personality, human development, and culture : international perspectives on psychological science | publisher=Psychology | location=Hove | year=2012 | isbn=978-0-415-65080-9 | pages=127–129}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Temperance has been described as a [[virtue]] by religious thinkers, philosophers, and more recently, psychologists, particularly in the [[positive psychology]] movement. In classical iconography, the virtue is often depicted as a woman holding two vessels transferring water from one to another.  It was one of the [[cardinal virtue]]s in western thought found in [[Greek philosophy]] and Christianity, as well as eastern traditions such as Buddhism and Hinduism. 

Temperance is one of the six virtues in the [[Values in Action Inventory of Strengths|positive psychology]] classification, included with [[wisdom]], [[courage]], [[humanity (virtue)|humanity]], [[justice]], and [[Values in Action Inventory of Strengths|transcendence]].&lt;ref name="gcc"&gt;{{cite book | last=Peterson | first=Christopher | title=Character strengths and virtues a handbook and classification | publisher=American Psychological Association Oxford University Press | location=Washington, DC New York | year=2004 | isbn=978-0-19-516701-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is generally characterized as the control over excess, and expressed through characteristics such as [[chastity]], [[modesty]], [[humility]], [[self control|self-regulation]], [[forgiveness]] and [[mercy]]; each of these involves restraining an excess of some [[impulse (psychology)|impulse]], such as [[sexual desire]], [[vanity]], or [[anger]].

The term "temperance" can also refer to the abstention from alcohol ([[teetotalism]]), especially with reference to the [[temperance movement]].

== History ==
===Greek civilization===
[[File:Temperance, Chilham.JPG|thumb|Figure of Temperance from [[Dudley Digges|Digges]] memorial by [[Nicholas Stone]], [[St. Mary's Church, Chilham|St. Mary's Church]], [[Chilham]]]]

The Greek definition of temperance translates to "moderation in action, thought, or feeling; restraint". Temperance is a major Athenian virtue, as advocated by [[Plato]]; self-restraint (sôphrosune) is one of his four core virtues of the ideal city, and echoed by [[Aristotle]]. According to Aristotle, "temperance is a mean with regard to pleasures".&lt;ref name="rmn2013"/&gt; In "[[Charmides (dialogue)|Charmides]]", one of Plato's early dialogues, the one who possessed 'sophrosune' is defined in four ways: (1) one who has quietness, (2) one who has modesty, (3) one who does his own business, and (4) one who knows himself. Plato quickly dismisses the three first definitions and argues against (4) that if 'sophrosune' would have been only the property of knowing what one knows or not, then it would be useless without knowledge about other matters.

==Religions==
[[File:Eglise de Commana2012 469.JPG|thumb|Representation of temperance (painted wood sculpture, dated 1683, which covers the shrine of the baptismal church Breton [[Commana]] in France). Temperance foot tips over a jug of wine, and presents a pitcher of water]]

Themes of temperance can be seen across cultures and time, as illustrated here.

===Buddhism===
Temperance is an essential part of the [[Eightfold Path]]. The third and fifth of the [[five precepts]] (pañca-sila) reflect values of temperance: "misconduct concerning sense pleasures" and drunkenness are to be avoided.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, P. (1990). ''An introduction to Buddhism: Teaching, history and practices.'' Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christianity===
In the Judeo-Christian tradition, temperance is prolific. The [[Old Testament]] emphasizes temperance as a core virtue, as evidenced in both Solomon's [[Book of Proverbs]] and in the [[Ten Commandments]], with its admonitions against adultery and covetousness. The [[New Testament]] does so as well, with [[forgiveness]] being central to [[theology]] and self-control being one of the [[Fruits of the Spirit]].&lt;ref name=rmn2013/&gt; With regard to Christian theology, the word temperance is used by the [[King James Version]] in [[Epistle to the Galatians|Galatians]] 5:23 for the Greek word ἐγκρατεία (enkrateia), which means self-control or discipline (''[[Strong's Concordance]]'', 1466). [[Thomas Aquinas]] promoted Plato's original virtues in addition to several others.

Within the Christian church Temperance is a virtue akin to self-control. It is applied to all areas of life. It can especially be viewed in practice among sects like the [[Amish]], [[Old Order Mennonites]], and [[Conservative Mennonites]]. In the Christian religion, temperance is a virtue that moderates attraction and desire for pleasure and "provides balance in the use of created goods". St. Thomas calls it a "disposition of the mind which binds the passions".&lt;ref name=rmn2013&gt;Niemiec, R. M. (2013). VIA character strengths: Research and practice (The first 10 years). In H. H. Knoop &amp; A. Delle Fave (Eds.), Well-being and cultures: Perspectives on positive psychology (pp. 11-30). New York: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt; Temperance is believed to combat the sin of [[gluttony]].{{cn|date=November 2016}} Temperance is commonly broken down into four main strengths: forgiveness, humility, prudence, and self-regulation.{{cn|date=April 2017}}

===Hinduism===
The concept of ''dama'' ({{lang-sa|दम|link=no}}) in Hinduism is equivalent to temperance. It is sometimes written as ''damah'' (Sanskrit: दमः).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spokensanskrit.de/index.php?tinput=self-control Sanskrit translations for Self-Control] English-Sanskrit Dictionary, Germany&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://sanskritdocuments.org/dict/dictall_unic.html Sanskrit Words]; See dama and damah&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''dama'', and Sanskrit derivative words based on it, connote the concepts of self-control and self-restraint. [[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]], in verse 5.2.3, states that three characteristics of a good, developed person are self-restraint (damah), compassion and love for all sentient life ([[compassion|daya]]), and charity ([[Dāna|daana]]).&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/Brihadaranyaka.Upanishad.Shankara.Bhashya.by.Swami.Madhavananda#page/n843/mode/2up Brihadaranyaka Upanishad], Translator: S Madhavananda, page 816, For discussion: pages 814-821; Quote - "तदेतत्त्रयँ शिक्षेद् दमं दानं दयामिति", translation: Learn three cardinal virtues - temperance, charity and [[compassion]] for all life."&lt;/ref&gt; In Hinduism literature dedicated to [[yoga]], self-restraint is expounded with the concept of ''[[yamas]]'' ({{lang-sa|यम|link=no}}).&lt;ref name=jlh&gt;James Lochtefeld, The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Rosen Publishing New York, {{ISBN|0-8239-2287-1}}, see article on Yama, page 777&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''ṣaṭsampad'', self-restraint (''dama'') is one of the six cardinal virtues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sanskrit.inria.fr/DICO/31.html#dama Monier-Williams Sanskrit-English Dictionary, France], this reference is in french; see explanation under the term dama: contrôle de ses passions&lt;/ref&gt;

The list of virtues that constitute a moral life evolve in [[veda]]s and [[upanishad]]s. Over time, new virtues were conceptualized and added, some replaced, others merged. For example, [[Samhita|Manusamhita]] initially listed ten virtues necessary for a human being to live a ''dharmic'' (moral) life: ''Dhriti'' (courage), ''Kshama'' (forgiveness), ''Dama'' (temperance), ''Asteya'' (Non-covetousness/Non-stealing), ''Saucha'' (purity), ''Indriyani-graha'' (control of senses), ''dhi'' (reflective prudence), ''vidya'' (wisdom), ''satyam'' (truthfulness), ''[[akrodha]]'' (free from anger). In later verses this list was reduced to five virtues by the same scholar, by merging and creating a more broader concept. The shorter list of virtues became: ''Ahimsa'' (Non-violence), ''Dama'' (temperance), ''Asteya'' (Non-covetousness/Non-stealing), ''Saucha'' (purity), ''Satyam'' (truthfulness).&lt;ref&gt;Gupta, B. (2006). BHAGAVAD GĪTĀ AS DUTY AND VIRTUE ETHICS. Journal of Religious Ethics, 34(3), 373-395.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mohapatra &amp; Mohapatra, Hinduism: Analytical Study, {{ISBN|978-8170993889}}; see pages 37-40&lt;/ref&gt; This trend of evolving concepts continue in classical Sanskrit literature, ''Dama'' with ''[[Ahimsa]]'' and few other virtues present in the evolving list of virtues necessary for a moral life (''dharma'').&lt;ref&gt;Comparative Religion, Kedar Nath Tiwari, {{ISBN|81-208-0294-2}}; see page 33-34&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, G. (1983). Puranic notes: reflections on the myth of sukesin. South Asia: Journal of South Asian Studies, 6(2), 46-61.&lt;/ref&gt;

Five types of self-restraints are considered essential for a moral and ethical life in Hindu philosophy: one must refrain from any violence that causes injury to others, refrain from starting or propagating deceit and falsehood, refrain from theft of other's property, refrain from sexually cheating on one's partner, and refrain from avarice.&lt;ref name=jlh/&gt;&lt;ref name=mhws&gt;Heim, M. (2005), Differentiations in Hindu ethics, in William Schweiker (Editor), The Blackwell companion to religious ethics, {{ISBN|0-631-21634-0}}, Chapter 35, pp 341-354&lt;/ref&gt; The scope of self-restraint includes one's action, the words one speaks or writes, and in one's thoughts. The necessity for temperance is explained as preventing bad ''karma'' which sooner or later haunts and returns to the unrestrained.&lt;ref&gt;Rao, G. H. (1926), The Basis of Hindu Ethics, International Journal of Ethics, 37(1), pp 19-35&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hindrey, Roderick (1978), Comparative ethics in Hindu and Buddhist traditions, Motilal Banarsidass Publications, {{ISBN|81-208-0866-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theological need for self-restraint is also explained as reigning in the damaging effect of one's action on others, as hurting another is hurting oneself because all life is one.&lt;ref name=mhws/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sturgess, Stephen (2013), The Yoga Book: A Practical Guide to Self-realization, Watkins Publishing, {{ISBN|978-1-84293-034-2}}, see Chapter 2&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Jainism ===
{{Expand section|date=March 2018}}
Temperance in [[Jainism]] is deeply imbibed in its five major vows which are:
*[[Ahimsa]] ([[nonviolence]])
*[[Satya]] ([[truth]])
*[[Brahmacharya]] ([[chastity]] or [[celibacy]]), 
*[[Asteya]] (non-stealing)
*[[Aparigraha]] (non-possessiveness). 

In Jainism, the vow of Ahimsa is not just restricted to not resorting to physical violence, but it also encompasses in itself abstinence from violence in any and all form either by thought, speech or action.

On [[Samvatsari]], the last day of [[Paryushan]]—the most prominent festival of Jainism—the Jains greet their friends and relatives on this last day with ''[[Micchami Dukkadam|Micchāmi Dukkaḍaṃ]]'', seeking their forgiveness.{{cn|date=March 2018}} The phrase is also used by [[Jainism|Jains]] throughout the year when a person makes a mistake, or recollects making one in everyday life, or when asking for forgiveness in advance for inadvertent ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Śramana Bhagavān Mahāvira: pt. 1. Sthavirāvali|author= M.R.P. Vijaya|author2=K.C. Jani |publisher=Śri Jaina Siddhanta Society |year=1951|isbn= |page=120 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary organizations==
{{Globalize|date=March 2018}}
Values of temperance are still advocated by more modern sources such as the [[Boy Scouts of America|Boy Scouts]], [[William Bennett]], and [[Ben Franklin]].&lt;ref name="Peterson 2004"&gt;Peterson &amp; Seligman 2004, M.E.P. (2004). ''Character strengths and virtues: A handbook and classification''. Washington, DC: American Psychological Association.&lt;/ref&gt; Philosophy has contributed a number of lessons to the study of traits, particularly in its study of injunctions and its listing and organizing of virtues.

[[Adolph Malan|Adolph Gysbert Malan]] DSO &amp; Bar DFC (24 March 1910 – 17 September 1963), better known as Sailor Malan, was a [[South African]] [[World War II]] [[fighter pilot]] who led No. 74 Squadron RAF during the height of the Battle of Britain. Malan developed a set of simple rules for fighter pilots, which eventually could be found throughout [[RAF Fighter Command]]:

"TEN OF MY RULES FOR AIR FIGHTING"

# Wait until you see the whites of his eyes. Fire short bursts of 1 to 2 seconds and only when your sights are definitely 'ON'.
# Whilst shooting think of nothing else, brace the whole of the body, have both hands on the stick, concentrate on your ring sight.
# Always keep a sharp lookout. "Keep your finger out!"
# Height gives You the initiative.
# Always turn and face the attack.
# Make your decisions promptly. It is better to act quickly even though your tactics are not the best.
# Never fly straight and level for more than 30 seconds in the combat area.
# When diving to attack always leave a proportion of your formation above to act as top guard.
# INITIATIVE, AGGRESSION, AIR DISCIPLINE, and TEAM WORK are the words that MEAN something in Air Fighting.
# Go in quickly - Punch hard - Get out!

'''Thubten Jigme Norbu''' ({{bo|t=ཐུབ་བསྟན་འཇིགས་མེད་ནོར་བུ་|w=Thub-stan 'Jigs-med Nor-bu}}) (August 16, 1922 – September 5, 2008&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/09/09/america/obits.php Thubten Norbu, eldest brother of Dalai Lama, dies], Douglas Martin, September 9, 2008 [[The New York Times International Edition]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/08/tibet Obituary:Thubten Jigme Norbu]&lt;/ref&gt;), recognised as the [[Taktser Rinpoche]], was a [[Tibetan people|Tibetan]] [[lama]], writer, [[civil and political rights|civil rights activist]] and professor of Tibetan studies and is the eldest brother of the [[14th Dalai Lama]], Tenzin Gyatso. He was one of the first high-profile Tibetans to go into exile and was the first Tibetan to [[Tibetan Americans|settle in the United States]].

==Early life==
Thubten Jigme Norbu was born in 1922 in the small, mountain village of [[Taktser]] in the [[Amdo County]] of Eastern [[Tibet]]. At the age of three, he was recognized by the [[13th Dalai Lama]] as the 24th incarnation of Taktser Rinpoche. At the age of eight, he was taken to [[Kumbum Monastery]] in [[Amdo]], the birthplace of [[Je Tsongkhapa]] who is the founder of the [[Gelug]] sect of [[Tibetan Buddhism]].

Historically, [[Kumbum]] was also the frequent residence of previous Dalai Lamas and [[Panchen Lama]]s. At Kumbum, Norbu began his training as a monk. At the age of 27, he was selected to serve as the [[abbot]] of [[Kumbum Monastery]]. At this time, Kumbum was one of the largest monasteries in Eastern Tibet.

Kumbum, however was one of the first areas to be invaded by the army of the [[China|People's Republic of China]] (PRC). The PRC held Norbu under [[house arrest]] in the monastery, sleeping in his room and following him 24 hours a day. The PRC demanded that he travel to [[Lhasa]], denounce the Tibetan government, and denounce his younger brother the Dalai Lama, who was then about 15 years old. Norbu pretended to agree with the PRC's demands and, as a result, was able to reach Lhasa to warn his brother of the [[History of Tibet (1950–present)|seriousness of the Chinese invasion]].

==In exile 1950–2008==
[[File:IUB-Showalter Fountain.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Rinpoche worked as a Professor of Tibetan studies at Indiana University]]
Norbu decided in 1950 that he would leave Tibet and attempt to [[protests and uprisings in Tibet since 1950|educate the world]] about the atrocities in Tibet and the actions of the PRC.

After leaving Tibet, Norbu worked continually for Tibet and the Tibetans in exile. He served as the Representative of the Dalai Lama and the [[Central Tibetan Administration]] to Japan and North America. He also served as Professor of Tibetan Studies at [[Indiana University Bloomington]]. He wrote a number of books, including, in 1959, his autobiography, ''Tibet Is My Country'' as told to [[Heinrich Harrer]] and in 1968 ''Tibet: Its History, Religion and People'', with [[Colin Turnbull]]. During the years, Norbu frequently lectured about the Tibetan situation at seminars throughout the world.

In 1979, Rinpoche founded the [[Tibetan Cultural Center]] (TCC) in Bloomington, a center devoted to preserving [[Tibetan culture]] and religion. In 1989, Colin Turnbull came and participated in the building of Tibetan Cultural Center with him. The facility, renamed the [[Tibetan-Mongolian Buddhist Cultural Center]] (or TMBCC) in 2006, has a Cultural Building, housing Tibetan works of art such as a [[Bhaisajyaguru|Medicine Buddha]] [[sand mandala]], and Tibetan butter sculptures. The Cultural Building also has a library of Tibetan-related works and a gift shop where visitors may purchase articles made by Tibetan refugees in exile.

His brother the Dalai Lama has visited the TMBCC on five separate occasions. In 1987, he dedicated the [[Changchub Chorten]]; in 1996 the Dalai Lama consecrated the cornerstone of the [[Kumbum Chamtse Ling Temple]]; in 1999, he was at the Center for 12 days when he gave the [[Kalachakra]] Initiation for World Peace and Harmony for the [[Kalachakra stupa]];&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tmbcc.org/our-past/ Founder of TMBCC]&lt;/ref&gt; in 2003, the Dalai Lama dedicated the Kumbum Chamtse Ling Temple in an interfaith ceremony; in 2007 he dedicated a new arch at the temple as well as holding a series of classes over six days.

==Independence walks==

In 1995, Norbu cofounded the [[International Tibet Independence Movement]] (ITIM). He has led three walks for Tibet's independence. In 1995, he led a week-long walk 80 miles from Bloomington, Indiana to [[Indianapolis]], Indiana. In 1996, this was followed by a 300-mile, 45-day walk from the PRC embassy in Washington, DC to the [[Headquarters of the United Nations]], surrounded by New York City. The following year, joined by [[Dadon]] with her 3 years old son, he led a 600-mile walk from [[Toronto]] to New York City, beginning on March 10 ([[Tibetan Uprising Day]]) and ending June 14 ([[Flag Day]]). In 1998, ITIM walked for independence starting in [[Portland, Oregon]] and ending in [[Vancouver]]. In 2000, one arm of ITIM walked from San Francisco and another from [[San Diego]]. The two branches met in Los Angeles to greet the Dalai Lama who was giving a teaching and empowerment at [[Thubten Dhargye Ling]].

==Life in the US==
[[File:Bloomington-TibetanCC-Stupa-9107.jpg|thumb|On the grounds of Tibetan Mongolian Buddhist Cultural Center, Bloomington, Indiana]]
Norbu lived at the Tibetan-Mongolian Buddhist Cultural Center with his wife Kunyang. They have three sons, Lhundrup, Kunga and Jigme Norbu, all born in New York. In late 2002, Norbu suffered a series of strokes and became an invalid. In 2005, the Dalai Lama appointed the  [[8th Arjia Rinpoche]], another former abbot of Kumbum Monastery, to take over the directorship of the Tibetan-Mongolian Buddhist Cultural Center.  Norbu remained until his death part of the daily life of the TMBCC where he was acclaimed as the founder of the facility and the foremost proponent in the world for the recognition and preservation of the culture of Tibet.

Norbu died at the age of 86 on September 5, 2008 at his home in Indiana in the United States having been ill for several years. His body was [[cremation|cremated]] in a traditional Buddhist ceremony.&lt;ref name="cremation"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.idsnews.com/news/story.aspx?id=62690&amp;comview=1 |title=Dalai Lama's brother cremated Thursday |author=Elvia Malagon |publisher=''[[Indiana Daily Student]]'' |date=September 12, 2008 |accessdate=September 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; His youngest son, Jigme, died at the age of 45 on February 14, 2011 while carrying on his father's work. He was hit by a car in Florida during a walk to promote Tibetan independence and raise awareness of Tibet.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5213">'''''Thumos''''' (also commonly spelled ''thymos''; {{lang-grc-gre|θυμός}}) is a Greek word expressing the concept of "[[spiritedness]]" (as in "spirited stallion" or "spirited debate"). The word indicates a physical association with breath or blood and is also used to express the human desire for recognition.

==History==

In [[Homer]]'s works, ''thumos'' was used to denote emotions, desire, or an internal urge.  ''Thumos'' was a permanent possession of living man, to which his thinking and feeling belonged. When a Homeric hero is under emotional stress, he may externalize his ''thumos'' and converse with or scold it.&lt;ref name=dictionary&gt;Long, A. A. Psychological Ideas in Antiquity. In: ''Dictionary of the History of Ideas''. 1973-74 [2003]. [http://xtf.lib.virginia.edu/xtf/view?docId=DicHist/uvaGenText/tei/DicHist4.xml;chunk.id=dv4-01 link].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Plato]]'s ''[[Phaedrus (dialogue)|Phaedrus]]'' and his later work ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'' discuss ''thumos'' as one of the three constituent parts of the human [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]]. In the ''Phaedrus'', Plato depicts ''logos'' as a charioteer driving the two horses ''[[Eros (concept)|eros]]'' and ''thumos'' (erotic love and spiritedness are to be guided by logos). In the ''Republic'' (Book IV) soul becomes divided into (See [[Plato's tripartite theory of soul]]):.&lt;ref name=dictionary/&gt;
* ''epithumia'' ("[[Appetition|appetite]]", "[[affection]]"), to which are ascribed bodily [[desire]]s; 
* ''thumos'' ("[[Passion (emotion)|passion]]"), the emotional element in virtue of which we [[Feeling|feel]] anger, fear, etc.;
* ''[[nous]]'' ("[[intellect]]", "[[reason]]"), which is or should be the controlling part which subjugates the appetites with the help of ''thumos''.

However, the term "[[emotion]]" is relatively modern. It was introduced into academic discussion as a catch-all term to [[Passions (philosophy)|passion]]s, [[Feeling|sentiment]]s and [[affection]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Dixon,T. 2003. ''From Passions to Emotions: The Creation of a Secular Psychological Category''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. p. 39. [https://books.google.com/books?id=B9c8tNQVI4YC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;hl=&amp;pg=PA39#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false link].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Democritus]] used "[[Euthymia_(philosophy)|euthymia]]" (i.e. "good thumos") to refer to a condition in which the soul lives calmly and steadily, being disturbed by no fear, superstition, or other [[Passions_(philosophy)|passions]]. For Democritus euthymia was one of the root aspects the goal of human life.

=== ''Thymos'' and democracy: megalothymia and isothymia===
"Megalothymia" refers to the need to be recognized as superior to others, while "isothymia" is the need to be recognized as merely equal to others. Both terms are [[neoclassical compounds]], coined by [[Francis Fukuyama]]. 

In his book ''[[The End of History and the Last Man]]'',  the author mentions "thymos" in relation to [[liberal democracy]] and recognition. He relates Socrates' ideas about ''Thymos'' and desire to how people want to be recognized within their government. Problems emerge when other people do not recognize another's ''Thymos'', and therefore do not provide the justice that it requires. In order for people to exist in harmony, Fukuyama argues, ''isothymia'' rather than ''megalothymia'' must be used to satisfy the human need for recognition. Any system that creates political inequality is necessarily feeding the ''megalothymia'' of some members while denying it to others.

Fukuyama explains how ''Thymos'' relates to history with the example of anti-communism in relation to the Soviet Union, Eastern Europe, and China. He states, "We cannot understand the totality of the revolutionary phenomenon unless we appreciate the working of thymotic anger and the demand for recognition that accompanied communism's economic crisis."&lt;ref&gt;Fukuyama, Francis.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8594">[[Max Weber]] distinguished three [[ideal type]]s of legitimate political leadership, domination and authority.  He wrote about these three types of domination in both his essay ''[[The Three Types of Legitimate Rule]]'' which was published in his masterwork ''[[Economy and Society]]'' (see Weber 1922/1978:215-216), and in his classic speech "[[Politics as a Vocation]]" (see Weber 1919/2015:137-138).
# '''[[charismatic authority]]''' (''character'', ''heroism'', ''leadership'', ''religious''),
# '''[[traditional authority]]''' (''patriarchs, patrimonialism, feudalism'') and
# '''[[legal authority]]''' (''modern law and state, bureaucracy'').

These three types are [[ideal type]]s and rarely appear in their pure form.

According to Weber, authority is power accepted as legitimate by those subjected to it. These three forms of authority are said to appear in an "hierarchical development order". [[Sovereign state|States]] progress from ''charismatic authority'', to ''traditional authority'', and finally reach the ''state of rational-legal authority'' which is characteristic of a modern [[liberal democracy]].

==Charismatic domination==
{{main|Charismatic domination}}
Charismatic authority grows out of the personal charm or the strength of an individual personality.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.12manage.com/methods_weber_charismatic_leadership.html Charismatic Leadership (Weber)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; It was described by Weber in a lecture as "the authority of the extraordinary and personal gift of grace (charisma)"; he distinguished it from the other forms of authority by stating "Men do not obey him [the charismatic ruler] by virtue of tradition or statute, but because they believe in him."&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.ne.jp/asahi/moriyuki/abukuma/weber/lecture/politics_vocation.html Politics as a Vocation&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the actual power or capabilities of the leader are irrelevant, as long as the followers believe that such power exists. Thus, according to Weber, it is particularly difficult for charismatic leaders to maintain their authority because the followers must continue to legitimize the authority of the leader.

Charismatic domination is insofar different from legal-rational and traditional power as it does not develop from established tradition but rather from the belief the followers have in the leader.

According to Weber, once the leader loses his charisma or dies, systems based on charismatic authority tend to transform into traditional or legal-rational systems.

==Traditional domination==
{{main|Traditional domination}}
In traditional authority, the legitimacy of the [[authority]] comes from [[tradition]] or custom; Weber described it as "the authority of the eternal yesterday" and identified it as the source of authority for [[monarchy|monarchies]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; In this type of domination, the traditional rights of a powerful individual or group are accepted by the subordinate, or at least not challenged. The dominant individual could be a clan leader, eldest, the head of a family, a patriarchal figure or dominant elite. Historically this has been the most common type of government.

According to Weber, inequalities are created and preserved by traditional authority. Should this authority not be challenged, the dominant leader or group will stay in power. For Weber, traditional power blocked the development of rational-legal authority.

==Rational-legal domination==
{{main|Legal domination}}
Legal authority, also known as rational-legal authority, is where an individual or institution exerts power by virtue of the legal office that they hold. It is the authority that demands obedience to the office rather than the officeholder; once they leave office, their rational-legal authority is lost. Weber identified ''"rationally-created rules"''&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; as the central feature of this form of authority. Modern [[democracy|democracies]] contain many examples of legal-rational regimes. There are different ways in which legal authority can develop. Many societies have developed a system of laws and regulations and there exist many different principles of legality. With the development of a legal-rational system, the political system is likely to be rationalized similarly. [[Constitution]]s, written documents, established offices and regular elections are often associated with modern legal-rational political systems. These in the past have tended to develop in opposition to earlier traditional systems such as monarchies, where the set of rules are not well developed. As these systems develop in a rational manner, authority takes on a legal-rational form. Those who govern have the legitimate legal right to do so and those subordinated accept the legality of the rulers.

Albeit rational-legal authority may be challenged by those subordinated, it is unlikely to result in a quick change in the nature of the system. Such power struggles, according to Weber, are mostly political struggles and may be based on nationalism or ethnicity.

==The classification of authority in the context of history==
Weber also notes that legal domination is the most advanced, and that societies evolve from having mostly traditional and charismatic authorities to mostly rational and legal ones, because the instability of charismatic authority inevitably forces it to "routinize" into a more structured form of authority. Likewise he notes that in a pure type of traditional rule, sufficient resistance to a master can lead to a "traditional revolution". Thus he alludes to an inevitable move towards a rational-legal structure of authority, utilizing a bureaucratic structure. This ties to his broader concept of [[Rationalization (sociology)|rationalization]] by suggesting the inevitability of a move in this direction. Thus this theory can be sometimes viewed as part of the [[social evolutionism]] theory.

In traditional authority, the legitimacy of the [[authority]] comes from [[tradition]], in charismatic authority from the personality and leadership qualities of the individual ([[charisma]]), and in legal (or rational-legal) authority from powers that are [[bureaucracy|bureaucratically]] and legally attached to certain positions. A classic example of these three types may be found in religion: [[priests]] (traditional), [[Jesus]] (charismatic), and the [[Roman Catholic Church]] (legal-rational). Weber also conceived of these three types within his three primary modes of conflict: traditional authority within status groups, charismatic authority within [[social class|class]], and legal-rational authority within party organizations.

In his view every historical relation between rulers and ruled contained elements that can be analyzed on the basis of the above distinction.

{{primary sources|date=January 2012}}
'''True Will''' is a term found within the mystical system of [[Thelema]], a magical society founded in 1904 with [[Aleister Crowley]]'s writing of ''[[The Book of the Law]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, Stephen (ed). ''The Magical Diaries of Aleister Crowley: Tunisia 1923'', p. 79, n. 8. Weiser, 1996. {{ISBN|0-87728-856-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IAO131&gt;IAO131. [https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/hdbq111/JoTS/JoTS1-1.pdf&amp;date=2010-01-17+12:04:48 Thelema &amp; Buddhism] in ''Journal of Thelemic Studies'', Vol. 1, No. 1, Autumn 2007, pp. 24&lt;/ref&gt; It is defined either as a person's grand destiny in life or as a moment-to-moment path of action that operates in perfect harmony with Nature. True Will does not spring from conscious intent, but from the interplay between the deepest Self and the entire Universe. Thelemites in touch with their True Will are said to have eliminated or bypassed their false desires, conflicts, and habits, and accessed their connection with the divine. Theoretically, at this point, the Thelemite acts in alignment with Nature, just as a stream flows downhill, with neither resistance nor "lust of result". Crowley's ideas on the subject partly originated with the teachings of [[Eliphas Levi]], whose magical books emphasize the magician finding their magical identity &amp;ndash; his or her 'true self', which Levi referred to as the "True Will".

== Thelema ==
Thelema roughly means "will" in [[Greek language|Greek]]. The phrase ''True Will'' does not appear in ''[[The Book of the Law]]'', the central sacred text of Thelema. Nevertheless, [[Aleister Crowley]]'s various commentaries on the Book routinely postulate that each individual has a unique and incommensurable True Will that determines his or her proper course in life. Crowley's invention appears to be an attempt to explain how some actions may be wrong (or "false") when "There is no law beyond Do what thou wilt".&lt;ref&gt;Liber AL III:60&lt;/ref&gt; Actions that conform to True Will are thus considered to be correct, while willed actions that deviate from True Will may nevertheless be wrong. In ''The Book of the Law'' Crowley wrote "Do What Thou Wilt". 

"DO WHAT THOU WILT" can often be misunderstood to mean "do what you want". When one says "do what thou wilt", this means that the origin of will directs the path. To understand and act upon one's True Will is a sort of "enlightenment" to Thelemites. The ultimate goal of a [[Thelema|Thelemite]] would be to understand and perform their True Will. True Will directs the individual towards destiny and forces them into the joy of accomplishing what they were meant to accomplish without "lust of result" (outside motivations).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Crowley|first=Aleister|title=Liber AL vel Legis|year=1904|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/oto/engccxx.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Crowley's essay ''The Secret Conference'' (written under the pseudonym "Gerald Aumont", and prefaced to ''The Heart of the Master''), he suggests that a technique must be devised by which a child's True Will may be discovered at birth, or as early as possible in life, in order to permit the correct ordering of society. 

In Crowley's ethical treatise [http://www.scarletwoman.org/docs/docs_duty.html ''Duty''], he identifies True Will with the Nature of the individual. This capitalized "Nature" may be compared with the "Perfect Nature" of earlier Gnostic systems, which was another term for the personal daimon or augoeides,{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}} usually referenced by Crowley as the [[Holy Guardian Angel]]. 

''The Message of the Master Therion'' ([http://www.scarletwoman.org/docs/docs_message.html Liber II]) is a document that attempts to delineate the doctrine of True Will. By reference to [http://www.hermetic.com/crowley/libers/lib913.html ''Liber Thisharb''], Liber II suggests a theory of metempsychosis, whereby the individual True Will is the resultant of a person's prior incarnations. But here as elsewhere, Crowley stops short of asserting objective validity for memories of past lives. He recommends developing "the magical memory" as a means to an end, and connecting the aspirant's abilities and remembered past with some purpose. By definition, the aspirant's True Will must fit the aspirant's nature.

In ''De Lege Libellum'' ([http://www.scarletwoman.org/docs/docs_lege.html Liber CL]), Crowley defines True Will as the will which "does not rest content with things partial and transitory, but...proceed[s] firmly to the End", and in the same passage he identifies that "end" as the destruction of oneself in love.

In [[semantics]] and [[Pragmatics|pragmatics]], a '''truth condition''' is the condition under which a [[sentence (linguistics)|sentence]] is [[wikt:true|true]]. For example, "It is snowing in Nebraska" is true precisely when it is snowing in Nebraska. Truth conditions of a sentence don't necessarily reflect current reality. They are merely the conditions under which the statement would be true.&lt;ref&gt;Birner, Betty J. Introduction to Pragmatics.  2013. Wiley-Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt;

More formally, a truth condition makes for the truth of a sentence in an [[inductive definition]] of truth (for details, see the [[semantic theory of truth]]). Understood this way, truth conditions are [[theoretical entities]]. To illustrate with an example: suppose that, in a particular truth theory&lt;ref&gt;Field, H. (1972). Tarski's Theory of Truth. ''The Journal of Philosophy,'' ''69''(13), 347-375. doi:10.2307/2024879&lt;/ref&gt; which is a theory of truth where truth is somehow made acceptable despite semantic terms as close as possible, the word "Nixon" [[reference|refers]] to [[Richard M. Nixon]], and "is alive" is associated with the [[set (mathematics)|set]] of currently [[Living Thing|living things]]. Then one way of representing the truth condition of "Nixon is alive" is as the [[ordered pair]] &lt;Nixon, {x: x is alive}&gt;. And we say that "Nixon is alive" is true if and only if the referent (or referent of) "Nixon" belongs to the set associated with "is alive", that is, if and only if Nixon is alive.

In [[semantics]], the truth condition of a sentence is almost universally considered distinct from its [[meaning (linguistics)|meaning]]. The meaning of a sentence is conveyed if the truth conditions for the sentence are understood. Additionally, there are many sentences that are understood although their truth condition is [[Uncertainty|uncertain]]. One popular argument for this view is that some sentences are [[logical truth|necessarily true]] — that is, they are true whatever happens to obtain. All such sentences have the same truth conditions, but arguably do not thereby have the same meaning. Likewise, the sets {x: x is alive} and {x: x is alive and x is not a rock} are identical — they have precisely the same members — but presumably the sentences "Nixon is alive" and "Nixon is alive and is not a rock" have different meanings.

[[File:2014-06-02 Sudan Flüchtlinge Protest gegen Abschiebung, Weißekreuzplatz Hannover, (07) Getränke an der Volxküche.jpg|thumb|A Volxküche event in Germany, 2014]]
'''VolxKuche'''/'''VolxKüche''' ('''VoKu'''/'''VoKü'''), '''peoples kitchen''', '''free supper club''' or '''kitchen for all''', are names used for a weekly or regularly occurring group cooking event, at which the meal is served free of charge or at cost. The name derives from the German expression "people's kitchen" (soup kitchen), as a secular counterpart of the Christian [[soup kitchen]].

Volxküchen are found usually in collective and/or self-managed arrangements (pubs, information stores, youth centers or autonomous centers) with politically left self-identity. In general at least one vegetarian meal is offered, frequently also vegan food. Often soon to be [[Shelf life|expired]] ingredients are obtained at cost, or donated by food banks, food manufacturers or community gardens.&lt;ref name="VokuCookbook"&gt;{{Cite book

==History==
The Volxküche in the current sense arose in the European squatter scene of the early 1980s.

==English spelling and pronunciation==
The spelling of Volxküche occurred as an expression of anti-nationalism. Historically nationalism had used the term "[[Volk (German word)|Volk]]/Volks" with negative consequences.  This use was a rejection of the negative connotation which had the intention of "excluding" many groups of German society. It is at the same time a funny self-willed expression of the anarchistic and/or autonomous scene.

In the US the word is spelled without an umlaut, and pronounced like "folks coo heh". The alternate German spelling Volkskueche (Volksküche) was intentionally not used.

== US locations ==
A 'Free Supper Club" in San Francisco, held twice a month as of 2013, is calling itself ''Volxkuche''. Besides a free dinner, performances, film and community are provided.&lt;ref&gt;VokuSF Website: http://www.vokusf.org/&lt;/ref&gt;
