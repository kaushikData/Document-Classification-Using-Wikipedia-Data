A friend and political associate of U.S. Senator [[Huey P. Long]], Shushan was an important political figure in [[Louisiana]] during the 1920s and 1930s, before scandals drove him from public office.&lt;ref name="oclc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cdm16313.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/landingpage/collection/p120701coll15|title=Abe L.

==Early life and career==
Shushan was born in Bougere (now part of [[Reserve, Louisiana|Reserve]]), Louisiana. He was first employed during his early teens by Shushan Brothers, a [[New Orleans]] wholesale dry goods business established by his father and uncle. Shushan became a partner in the firm in 1916 and president of the firm in 1931.&lt;ref name="oclc" /&gt;

==Political career==
Shushan became involved in [[Louisiana]] politics as a supporter in the [[political machine]] of [[Huey Long]].&lt;ref name=Things /&gt;&lt;ref name=Second&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bMhKNL55Wa4C&amp;pg=PA223&amp;dq=%22Abraham+Shushan%22+-wikipedia&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj-3YqYhYHdAhULu1MKHe2nDGYQ6AEILzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Abraham%20Shushan%22%20-wikipedia&amp;f=false|title=Second Line: Two Short Novels of Love and Cooking in New Orleans|first=Poppy Z.|last=Brite|publisher=Small Beer Press|isbn=9781618730169|page=223|year=2003|accessdate=August 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Long was criticized by [[Gerald L. K. Smith]], a racist and [[anti-semitic]] politician, of having "too many Jews" in circle, which "Shushan resented."&lt;ref name=Smith&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NvZabkDqcMoC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22Abraham+Shushan%22+-wikipedia&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjx3t6wloHdAhWtV98KHYsMAQY4HhDoAQguMAE#v=onepage&amp;q=Shushan&amp;f=false|title=Gerald L.

Appointed to the [[New Orleans Levee Board]] in 1920 by Governor [[John M. Parker]], he was reappointed by successive administrations and became president of the Board in 1929.&lt;ref name="oclc" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Lake&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=poelBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA50&amp;dq=%22Abraham+Shushan%22+-wikipedia&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj-3YqYhYHdAhULu1MKHe2nDGYQ6AEINTAC#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Abraham%20Shushan%22%20-wikipedia&amp;f=false|title=Lake Pontchartrain|first=Catherine |last=Campanella|publisher=Arcadia Publishing|page=50|year=2015|accessdate=August 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a member of the Levee Board during the [[Great Mississippi Flood of 1927]].

Shushan was involved in fundraising for [[John H. Overton]] during the [[United States Senate elections, 1932|Election of 1932]], which lead later to legal trouble for him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tlETAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=%22Abraham+Shushan%22+-wikipedia&amp;dq=%22Abraham+Shushan%22+-wikipedia&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjWl_qQhoHdAhXHq1kKHQUcBBY4ChDoAQgxMAI|title=Louisiana Politics And the Paradoxes of Reaction And Reform, 1877-1928: Volume 7 of The Louisiana purchase bicentennial series in Louisiana history|first=Matthew J. |last=Schott (editor)|publisher=Center for Louisiana Studies, University of Louisiana at Lafayette|year=2000|isbn=9781887366397|volume=7|page=664|accessdate=August 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The defeated incumbent, [[Edwin S. Broussard]], accused Overton, and Shushan and his other supporters of voter fraud; the [[United States Senate]] held hearings, but Overton was seated without opposition.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

It was under his direction that the lakefront sea wall and the [[New Orleans Lakefront Airport]] were constructed.&lt;ref name=Things /&gt; Originally, in 1934, that airport was named in his honor.&lt;ref name=Things /&gt;&lt;ref name=Second /&gt;&lt;ref name=Lake /&gt; In 1935, he was tried for Federal tax and [[money laundering]] charges under the [[Internal Revenue Code]] by a [[special prosecutor]], [[List of Governors of Texas|former Texas Governor]] [[Dan Moody]],&lt;ref name=Congressional&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xrFGAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22Abraham+Shushan%22+-wikipedia&amp;dq=%22Abraham+Shushan%22+-wikipedia&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj-3YqYhYHdAhULu1MKHe2nDGYQ6AEIVzAJ|title=Congressional series of United States public documents|publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office|volume=10126|page=32|year=1937|accessdate=August 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hearings&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b2geCipvu6YC&amp;q=%22Abraham+Shushan%22+-wikipedia&amp;dq=%22Abraham+Shushan%22+-wikipedia&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjWl_qQhoHdAhXHq1kKHQUcBBY4ChDoAQg6MAQ|title=Hearings, Volume 2|publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office|volume=2|page=130|year=1937|accessdate=August 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''United States v.

He ended up being sued by [[Louisiana Attorney General]] on behalf of the Levee Board, and the case reached the [[Louisiana Supreme Court]] in 1940.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rgEvAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22Abraham+Shushan%22+-wikipedia&amp;dq=%22Abraham+Shushan%22+-wikipedia&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjWl_qQhoHdAhXHq1kKHQUcBBY4ChDoAQg1MAM|title=Statistical Report (charges Made, Not Trials) of the Attorney General|

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9142">'''Active living''' is a [[way of life]] that integrates [[physical activity]] into your everyday routines, such as walking to the store or biking to work.  Active living brings together [[urban planners]], [[architects]], [[transportation engineers]], [[public health]] professionals, activists and other professionals to build places that encourage active living and physical activity.  One example includes efforts to build sidewalks, crosswalks, pedestrian crossing signals and other ways for children to walk safely to and from school, as seen in the Safe Routes to School program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Safe Routes|url=http://www.saferoutesinfo.org/|publisher=National Center for Safe Routes to School|accessdate=March 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Safe Routes To School|url=http://www.saferoutespartnership.org/|publisher=Safe Routes to School National Partnership|accessdate=March 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Recreational opportunities (parks, fitness centres etc.) close to the home or workplace, walking trails and bike lanes for transportation also encourage a more active lifestyle.  Active living is a combination of physical activity and recreation activities aimed at the general public to encourage a healthier lifestyle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Active Living |url=http://www.healthyalberta.com/155.htm |publisher=Government of Alberta |accessdate=March 21, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120403195030/http://www.healthyalberta.com/155.htm |archivedate=April 3, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Active living is a growing field that emerged from the early work of the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) with the release of the Surgeon's General Report on Physical Activity and Health in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|url=https://www.cdc.gov/|publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|accessdate=March 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1997, the CDC began the development of an initiative called Active Community Environments (ACEs) coordinated by Rich Killingsworth (the founding director of active living by Design&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Active Living by Design|url=http://www.activelivingbydesign.org/|publisher=North Carolina Institute for Public Health|accessdate=March 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ) and Tom Schmid, a senior health scientist.  The main programming thrust of ACEs was an emerging initiative called Safe Routes to School that was catalyzed by a program designed by Rich Killingsworth and Jessica Shisler at CDC called KidsWalk-to-School. This program provided much needed attention to the connections of the built environment and health, especially obesity and physical inactivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ACES - Active Community Environments |url=https://www.cdc.gov/physicalactivity/professionals/environment/aces.html |publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |accessdate=March 21, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120307013100/http://www.cdc.gov/physicalactivity/professionals/environment/aces.html |archivedate=March 7, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2000, [[Robert Wood Johnson Foundation]] formally launched their active living initiative which comprised three national programs - [[Active Living by Design]], Active Living Research, and Active for Life.  The main goal of these programs was to develop an understanding how the built environment impacted physical activity and what could be done to increase physical activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation|url=http://www.rwjf.org/|publisher=Robert Wood Johnson Foundation|accessdate=March 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Benefits==
There are many health related benefits to being physically active and living an active life.  Active living can help to reduce the risk of [[chronic diseases]], improve your overall health and well-being, reduce stress levels, minimize health related medical costs, help you to maintain a healthy weight, assist in proper balance and posture and the maintenance of healthy bones and strong muscles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Benefits of Physical Activity|url=http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/alw-vat/intro/key-cle-eng.php|publisher=Public Health Agency of Canada|accessdate=March 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Active living can also improve your sleeping patterns and aid in the prevention of risk factors for [[heart disease]] such as [[blood cholesterol]] levels, [[diabetes]] and [[hypertension]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Active Living Benefits |url=http://asrpwf.ca/recreation-active-living/active-living.aspx |publisher=Alberta Sport, Recreation, Parks and Wildlife Foundation |accessdate=March 21, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320014025/http://www.asrpwf.ca/recreation-active-living/active-living.aspx |archivedate=March 20, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Benefits of Being Active|url=http://www.dairygoodness.ca/good-health/healthy-active-living/the-benefits-of-being-active|publisher=Dairy Goodness|accessdate=March 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of physical activity==
There are three types of [[physical exercise]]s that a person can do to keep active: [[endurance]], [[flexibility]] and [[Physical strength|strength]] activities.  
* Endurance activities increase your heart rate and strengthen your heart and your lungs.  Examples include: dancing, skating, cycling, swimming and brisk walking.
* Flexibility activities improve your body’s ability to move and assist in keeping your muscles and joints relaxed.  Examples include: yard work, vacuuming, stretching and golf.
* Strength activities create and maintain muscle and keep bones strong.  Examples include: raking leaves, climbing stairs, lifting free weights and push-ups.
It is easy to incorporate endurance, flexibility and strength activities into your daily routine for active living.  Activities such as normal household chores can fit into more than one of the above categories, and it is simple enough to switch to using the stairs instead of taking the elevators at work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Be Active at Work|url=http://www.peelregion.ca/health/workplace/employees/active/3groups.htm|publisher=Account for Health|accessdate=March 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recommendations==
In Canada, the [[Public Health Agency of Canada]] supported the Canadian Society for Exercise Physiology (CSEP) to review the  Canada's Physical Activity Guides,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Canadian Physical Activity Guidelines|url=http://www.csep.ca/CMFiles/Guidelines/CSEP-InfoSheetsComplete-ENG.pdf|publisher=The Canadian Society for Exercise Physiology|accessdate=March 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; which were updated and replaced with the Get Active Tip Sheets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tips to Get Active|url=http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/hp-ps/hl-mvs/pa-ap/04paap-eng.php|publisher=Public Health Agency of Canada|accessdate=March 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Get Active Tip Sheets are broken down into 4 age categories (5-11, 12-17, 18-64 and 65 &amp; older).

The Get Active Tip Sheets recommend that children aged 5–11 and youth aged 12–17 should participate in at least 60 minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity each day.  The recommendation for adults 18-64 and for older adults 65 years and older is at least 2.5 hours of moderate to vigorous physical activity per week. These minutes do not all need to be done at the same time, but the recommendation is a minimum of 10 minutes at a time.

==Initiatives==
In Canada, there are many active living initiatives currently in place.  One of the most well known programs is the [[ParticipACTION]] program, which aims to encourage Canadians to move more and increase their [[physical activity level]]s.  Their mission statement is "ParticipACTION is the national voice of physical activity and sport participation in Canada. 
Through leadership in communications, capacity building and knowledge exchange, we inspire and support Canadians to move more."  Since the 1970s, ParticipACTION has been motivating Canadians to live actively and participate in sports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About ParticipACTION |url=http://www.participaction.com/en-us/About-Participaction/About-ParticipACTION.aspx |publisher=ParticipACTION |accessdate=March 21, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120403131834/http://www.participaction.com/en-us/About-Participaction/About-ParticipACTION.aspx |archivedate=April 3, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Active at old age==
To help be active at older ages you should look into programs like ALC(active living center)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16488">{{Jewish Labour Bund}}
{{Jews and Judaism sidebar |Politics}}

'''Bundism''' was a secular [[Jews|Jewish]] [[socialism|socialist]] movement, whose organizational manifestation was the [[General Jewish Labour Bund|General Jewish Labour Bund in Lithuania, Poland and Russia]] ({{lang-yi|אַלגעמײַנער ײדישער אַרבעטער בּונד אין ליטע פוילין און רוסלאַנד|Algemeyner Yidisher Arbeter Bund in Litah, Poyln un Rusland}}), founded in the [[Russian Empire]] in 1897.

The Jewish Labour Bund was an important component of the social democratic movement in the Russian empire until the 1917 [[Russian Revolution]]; the Bundists initially opposed the [[October Revolution]], but ended up supporting it due to [[pogrom]]s committed by the [[Volunteer Army]] of the [[White movement#Structure|White movement]] during the [[Russian Civil War]]. Split along communist and social democratic lines throughout the Civil War, a faction supported the [[Bolsheviks]] and eventually was absorbed by the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]].

The anti-Communist socialist Bundist movement continued to exist as a political party in independent Poland in the [[interwar period]] as the [[General Jewish Labour Bund in Poland]], becoming a major, if not ''the'' major, political force within Polish Jewry. Bundists were active in the [[Jewish partisans|anti-Nazi struggle]], and many of its members were killed during [[the Holocaust]].

After the war, the [[International Jewish Labor Bund]], more properly the "World Coordinating Council of the Jewish Labor Bund", was founded in New York, with affiliated groups in Argentina, Australia, Canada, France, Israel, Mexico, the United Kingdom, the United States and other countries.

==Ideology==

===Marxism===
While the Jewish Labour Bund ["circle"] was a trade union as well as a political party, its initial purpose was the organisation of the Jewish proletariat in Russia, Poland and Lithuania.

===Secularism===
A staunchly secular party, the Jewish Labour Bund took part in [[Kehilla (modern)|kehillot]] elections in Poland.

===Yiddishism===
The Jewish Labour Bund, while not initially interested in the Yiddish ''per se'' as anything more than a vehicle to exhort the masses of Jewish workers in Eastern Europe, soon saw the language and the larger Yiddish culture as a value and promoted the [[Yiddishist movement|use of Yiddish]] as a Jewish national language in its own right;&lt;ref name=Fishman&gt;{{cite book|last=Fishman|first=David|authorlink=David Fishman|title=The Rise of Modern Yiddish Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZB_MCB1dL4EC&amp;pg=PA49|year=2005|publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press|isbn=978-0-8229-4272-6|page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; to some extent, the promotion of Yiddish was part and parcel of the Bund's opposition to the Zionist movement, and its project of reviving [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]].&lt;ref name=Enc&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schiff|first1=Alvin I.|authorlink1=Alvin I. Schiff|last2=Klenicki|first2=Leon|authorlink2=Leon Klenicki|title=The Shengold Jewish Encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DK5K72JymAEC&amp;pg=PA56|year=2003|publisher=Schreiber Publishing|isbn=978-1-887563-77-2|page=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Doikayt===
The concept of Doikayt (lit. "hereness", Yiddish = do-ikayt, do'ikayt; German = Da-keit; French = "ici-té") was central to the Bundist ideology, expressing its focus on solving the challenges confronting Jews in the country in which they lived, versus the "thereness" of the Zionist movement, which posited the necessity of an independent Jewish polity in its ancestral homeland, i.e., the [[Land of Israel]], to secure Jewish life.

===National-cultural autonomism===
The Jewish Labour Bund did not advocate ethnic or religious separatism, but focused on culture, not a state or a place, as the glue of Jewish nationhood, within the context of a world of multi-cultural and multi-ethnic countries. In this the Bundists borrowed extensively from the [[Austromarxism|Austro-Marxist]] concept of [[national personal autonomy]]; this approach alienated the Bolsheviks and Lenin, who were derisive of and politically opposed to Bundism.

In a 1904 text, ''Social democracy and the national question'', [[Vladimir Medem]] exposed his version of this concept:&lt;ref&gt;{{lang-yi|Medem, V.}} 1943. “Di sotsial-demokratie un di natsionale frage” (1904). Vladimir Medem: Tsum tsvantsikstn yortsayt. New York: New York: Der Amerikaner Reprezentants fun Algemeynem Yidishn Arbeter-Bund (‘Bund’) in Poyln, pp. 173-219.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gechtman|first=Roni|date=December 2008|title=National-Cultural Autonomy and 'Neutralism': Vladimir Medem's Marxist Analysis of the National Question, 1903-1920|journal=[[Socialist Studies (1983)|Socialist Studies]]|volume=III|issue=1|issn=1918-2821 |url=http://journals.sfu.ca/sss/index.php/sss/article/view/23|accessdate=2009-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Let us consider the case of a country composed of several national groups, e.g. Poles, Lithuanians and Jews. Each national group would create a separate movement. All citizens belonging to a given national group would join a special organisation that would hold cultural assemblies in each region and a general cultural assembly for the whole country. The assemblies would be given financial powers of their own: either each national group would be entitled to raise taxes on its members, or the state would allocate a proportion of its overall budget to each of them. Every citizen of the state would belong to one of the national groups, but the question of which national movement to join would be a matter of personal choice and no authority would have any control over his decision. The national movements would be subject to the general legislation of the state, but in their own areas of responsibility they would be autonomous and none of them would have the right to interfere in the affairs of the others".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Plassereaud|first=Yves|date=May 2000|title=Choose Your Own Nationality  or The Forgotten History of Cultural Autonomy|journal=[[Le Monde diplomatique]]|language=English|url=http://www.panarchy.org/plasseraud/choice.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Opposition to Zionism===

====Before the creation of the State of Israel====
The Jewish Labour Bund, as an organization, was formed at the same time as the World Zionist Organization.  The Bund eventually came to strongly oppose [[Zionism]],&lt;ref name=Laq&gt;Walter Laqueur, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=NMjh319vnwAC&amp;pg=PA273 A History of Zionism]'', Tauris Parke Paperbacks, 2003, pg. 273&lt;/ref&gt; arguing that [[Aliyah|emigration to Palestine]] was a form of [[escapism]]. After the 1936 [[Warsaw]] [[Kehilla (modern)|kehilla]] elections, [[Henryk Ehrlich]] created an incident by accusing [[Zionism|Zionist]] leaders [[Yitzhak Gruenbaum]] and [[Ze'ev Jabotinsky]] of being responsible for recent anti-Semitic agitation in Poland by their campaign urging Jewish emigration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bacon|first=Gershon C.|title=The politics of tradition. ''Agudat Yisrael in Poland 1916-1939''|publisher= Magnes Press, Hebrew University|location=Jerusalem|year=1996|series=Studies on Polish Jewry|pages=331|isbn=978-965-223-962-4}}, pp.200, 220-222&lt;/ref&gt;

====After 1947====
The Bund was against the UNGA vote on the partition of Palestine and reaffirmed its support for a single bi-national country that would guarantee equal national rights for the Jewish and Arab-Palestinian populations and would that it be under the control of superpowers and the UN.
	The 1948 New York Second World Conference of the International Jewish Labor Bund condemned the proclamation of the Zionist state. The conference was in favour of a two nations’ state built on the base of national equality and democratic federalism. 

A branch of the Jewish Labour Bund was created in Israel in 1951, the [[Arbeter-ring in Yisroel – Brith Haavoda]], which even took part in the 1959 Knesset elections, with a very low electoral result.  Its publication, Lebns Fregyn, is still being published as of 2014.  It is one of the relatively few left-wing Yiddish-language publications in existence.

The 1955 Montreal 3rd World Conference of the [[International Jewish Labor Bund]] decided that the creation of the Jewish state was an important event in Jewish history that might play a positive role in Jewish life, but felt that a few necessary changes were needed. The conference participants demanded that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
*a) the authorities of Israel should treat the state as property of the Jews the world;
*b) but it would mean that the affairs of the Jewish community in Israel should be subordinate to those of world Jewry.
*c) the policy of the state of Israel would be the same toward all citizens regardless of their nationalities.
*d) Israel should foster peace with the Arabs. This required halting territorial expansion and resolving the Palestinian refugee problem.
*e) Yiddish should be taught at all educational institutions and would be promoted in public life.&lt;ref name="grabsky"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.workersLiberty.org/node/4655|title=The Anti-Zionism of the Bund (1947-1972)|last=Grabsky|first=August|date=August 10, 2005|publisher=Workers' Liberty |accessdate=2009-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The World Coordinating Council of the Jewish Labour Bund was quietly disbanded by a number of Bundists and representatives of related organizations, including the [[Workmen's Circle]] and the Congress for Jewish Culture in the early 2000s.

The London-based [[Jewish Socialists' Group]], which publishes the magazine Jewish Socialist, considers itself an heir of the historic Jewish Labour Bund.

Founded in the mid-1990s, CSD is a non-profit, non-partisan organization affiliated with the [[Queen's School of Policy Studies|School of Policy Studies at Queen's University]], in [[Kingston, Ontario|Kingston]], [[Ontario]], Canada. CSD is chaired by [[Tom Axworthy|Dr. Thomas Axworthy]], [[Principal Secretary (Canada)|Principal Secretary]] and Chief Speechwriter for [[Canadian Prime Minister|Prime Minister]] [[Pierre Trudeau]] in the early 1980s.

The CSD operates on the principle that building local knowledge of democratization and [[good governance]] is the most effective means of allowing countries undergoing democratic transitions to successfully manage this change over the long term, as well as being able to effectively respond to crises. CSD works extensively with local partners to provide both the pedagogical experience expertise and practical experience necessary to assist in the development of local democratic values programs as well as providing contacts to others who have succeeded in similar efforts.

The CSD focuses on research, mutual learning and executive development programming, designed to increase indigenous capacity to produce, debate and disseminate research about democracy.

The CSD is guided by three principles: to work jointly with individuals or institutions abroad on research projects of mutual interest that contributes to democratic governance, to commit to local partners to establish democratic capacity (a process which often takes years), and to use this experience to teach the lessons learned to other countries.

The CSD was founded by [[George Perlin|Dr. George Perlin]], Professor Emeritus in the School of Policy Studies at [[Queen's University]], who specializes in the study of [[Ukraine]]. He initiated one of the most extensive project undertaken by the Centre, which involved the development of a Democratic Values Curriculum in Ukraine, the Canada-Ukraine Democracy Education Project, which is ongoing.

'''Church Action on Poverty''' is a UK-based national [[ecumenical]] [[Christian]] [[social justice]] [[charitable organization|charity]], committed to tackling [[poverty in the United Kingdom]]. Church Action on Poverty works in partnership with churches and with people in poverty themselves to find solutions to poverty, locally, nationally and globally.

==History==
Church Action on Poverty was formed in 1982, has its main offices in [[Manchester]] and is charity number 1079986. The first Director of CAP was the MP [[John Battle (politician)|John Battle]], the second Director was former government minister [[Paul Goggins]]. The current Director is Niall Cooper.

==Philosophy==
Church Action on Poverty emphasises the need for people in poverty to have a voice in decisions which affect them, and focuses on participation and empowerment. An example of this approach is their 'poverty hearing' model.

==Campaigns==
Church Action on Poverty currently runs campaigns which are connected by the theme 'Close the Gap', aiming to tackle economic inequality and close the gap between rich and poor. The organisation has successfully campaigned for all the UK's major Christian denominations to support the Living Wage.

Previously, Church Action on Poverty ran the Living Ghosts campaign highlighting the destitution of [[asylum seekers]] in the UK. It also helped to set up and run the [[Debt on our Doorstep]] campaign against loan sharks and extortionate lending practices such as [[payday loans in the United Kingdom|payday loans]].

Church Action on Poverty has pioneered the use of  [[international development]] approaches to tackle UK poverty. Examples include [[participatory budgeting]] (which was taken up by the [[Labour party (UK)|Labour]] government in 2007), [[sustainable livelihoods analysis]], and Freirean popular education in the form of 'Schools of Participation'.

===People's Budget===
{{distinguish|People's Budget}}
The '''People's Budget''' is a campaign for more [[participatory budgeting]] in UK led by the Church Action on Poverty who planned campaign workshops across the UK in [[London]], [[St. Helens, Merseyside]], [[Dudley]], [[Tameside]], [[Leeds]] and [[Gateshead|Tyneside]].

The Church Action on Poverty feels that billions of pounds of money is being used by public bodies without any involvement of local people. 'The People's Budget' campaign is about helping British citizens understand how to influence their local council, health organisation, police force or housing provider. The campaign works with groups and individual to promote:
# [[Participatory budgeting]] in their local area and wider
# Participatory budgeting as the standard model for certain budgets
# Having a one percent minimum of [[public sector]] budgets decided using participatory budgeting

'''Cross-cultural communication''' is a field of study that looks at how people from differing [[culture|cultural]] backgrounds communicate, in similar and different ways among themselves, and how they endeavor to [[communication|communicate]] across cultures. [[Intercultural communication]] is a related field of study.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.japanintercultural.com/en/home/default.aspx Japan Intercultural Consulting]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins and culture==
During the [[Cold War]], the economy of the United States was largely self-contained because the world was polarized into two separate and competing powers: the [[Eastern Bloc|East]] and the [[Western Bloc|West]]. However, changes and advancements in economic relationships, political systems, and technological options began to break down old cultural barriers. Business transformed from individual-country capitalism to [[Globalization#Modern|global capitalism]]. Thus, the study of cross-cultural communication was originally found within businesses and government, both seeking to expand globally. Businesses began to offer [[Language education|language training]] to their employees and programs were developed to train employees to understand how to act when abroad.  With this also came the development of the [[Foreign Service Institute]], or FSI, through the [[Foreign Service Act]] of 1946, where government employees received training and prepared for overseas posts.&lt;ref&gt;Everett M. Rogers, William B. Hart, &amp; Yoshitaka Miike (2002). Edward T. Hall and The History of Intercultural Communication: The United States and Japan. Keio Communication Review No. 24, 1-5. Accessible at http://www.mediacom.keio.ac.jp/publication/pdf2002/review24/2.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; There began also implementation of a “[[world view]]” perspective in the curriculum of higher education.&lt;ref&gt;Bartell, M. (2003). Internationalization of universities: A university culture-based framework. Higher Education, 45(1), 44, 48, 49.&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1974, the [[International Progress Organization]], with the support of [[UNESCO]] and under the auspices of [[Senegal]]ese President [[Léopold Sédar Senghor]], held an international conference on "The Cultural Self-comprehension of Nations" ([[Innsbruck]], [[Austria]], 27–29 July 1974) which called upon [[United Nations]] member states "to organize systematic and global comparative research on the different cultures of the world" and "to make all possible efforts for a more intensive training of diplomats in the field of international cultural co-operation ... and to develop the cultural aspects of their foreign policy."&lt;ref&gt;[[Hans Köchler]] (ed.), Cultural Self-comprehension of Nations. Tübingen: Erdmann, 1978, {{ISBN|978-3-7711-0311-8}}, Final Resolution, p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt;

There has become an increasing pressure for universities across the world to incorporate intercultural and international understanding and knowledge into the education of their students. &lt;ref&gt;Deardorff, D. K. (2015). A 21st Century Imperative: integrating intercultural competence in Tuning. Tuning Journal for Higher Education, 3(1), 137–147. https://doi.org/10.18543/tjhe-3(1)-2015pp137-147
&lt;/ref&gt; International literacy and cross-cultural understanding have become critical to a country’s cultural, technological, economic, and political health. It has become essential for universities to educate, or more importantly, “transform”, to function effectively and comfortably in a world characterized by close, multi-faceted relationships and permeable borders. Students must possess a certain level of global competence to understand the world they live in and how they fit into this world. This level of global competence starts at ground level- the university and its faculty- with how they generate and transmit cross-cultural knowledge and information to students.&lt;ref name="Bartell, M. 2003"&gt;Bartell, M. (2003). Internationalization of universities: A university culture-based framework. Higher Education, 45(1), 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Interdisciplinary orientation ==
Cross-cultural communication endeavors to bring together the relatively unrelated fields of [[cultural anthropology]] with established areas of communication. At its core, cross-cultural communication involves understanding the ways in which culturally distinct individuals communicate with each other. Its charge is to also produce some guidelines with which people from different cultures can better communicate with each other.

Cross-cultural communication requires an interdisciplinary approach. It involves literacy in fields such as [[anthropology]], [[cultural studies]], [[psychology]] and communication. The field has also moved both toward the treatment of interethnic relations, and toward the study of communication strategies used by [[co-cultural populations]], i.e., communication strategies used to deal with majority or mainstream populations.

The study of languages other than one's own can serve not only to help one understand what we as humans have in common, but also to assist in the understanding of the diversity which underlines our languages' methods of constructing and organizing knowledge. Such understanding has profound implications with respect to developing a critical awareness of social relationships. Understanding social relationships and the way other cultures work is the groundwork of successful globalization business affairs.

Language socialization can be broadly defined as “an investigation of how language both presupposes and creates anew, social relations in cultural context”.&lt;ref name="Rymes"&gt;Rymes, (2008). Language Socialization and the Linguistic Anthropology of Education. Encyclopedia of Language and Education, 2(8, Springer)&lt;/ref&gt; It is imperative that the speaker understands the grammar of a language, as well as how elements of language are socially situated in order to reach communicative competence. Human experience is culturally relevant, so elements of language are also culturally relevant.&lt;ref name="Rymes" /&gt;{{rp|3}}  One must carefully consider semiotics and the evaluation of sign systems to compare cross-cultural norms of communication.&lt;ref name="Rymes" /&gt;{{rp|4}} There are several potential problems that come with language socialization, however. Sometimes people can over-generalize or label cultures with stereotypical and subjective characterizations. Another primary concern with documenting alternative cultural norms revolves around the fact that no social actor uses language in ways that perfectly match normative characterizations.&lt;ref name="Rymes" /&gt;{{rp|8}} A methodology for investigating how an individual uses language and other semiotic activity to create and use new models of conduct and how this varies from the cultural norm should be incorporated into the study of language socialization.&lt;ref name="Rymes" /&gt;{{rp|11,12}}

== Global rise ==
With increasing [[globalization]] and international trade, it is unavoidable that different cultures will meet, conflict, and blend together. People from different culture find it is difficult to communicate not only due to language barriers, but also are affected by culture styles.&lt;ref name=CC&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.culturalcandor.com/#facts-and-figures| title=Fact and Figure about cross cultural training.| accessdate=3 December 2015| publisher=Cultural Candor Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, in [[individualistic culture]]s, such as in the United States, Canada, and Western Europe, an independent figure or self is dominant. This independent figure is characterized by a sense of self relatively distinct from others and the environment. In [[Self-enhancement#Culture|interdependent cultures]], usually identified as Asian, Latin American, African, and Southern European cultures, an interdependent figure of self is dominant. There is a much greater emphasis on the interrelatedness of the individual to others and the environment; the self is meaningful only (or primarily) in the context of social relationships, duties, and roles. In some degree, the effect brought by cultural difference override the language gap. This culture style difference contributes to one of the biggest challenges for cross-culture communication. Effective communication with people of different cultures is especially challenging. Cultures provide people with ways of thinking—ways of seeing, hearing, and interpreting the world. Thus the same words can mean different things to people from different cultures, even when they speak the "same" language. When the languages are different, and translation has to be used to communicate, the potential for misunderstandings increases. The study of cross-cultural communication is a global research area.  As a result, cultural differences in the ''study'' of cross-cultural communication can already be found.  For example, cross-cultural communication is generally considered part of [[communication studies]] in the US, but is emerging as a sub-field of [[applied linguistics]] in the UK.

== Incorporation into college programs ==
The application of cross-cultural communication theory to foreign language education is increasingly appreciated around the world. Cross-cultural communication classes can now be found within foreign language departments of some universities, while other schools are placing cross-cultural communication programs in their departments of education.

With the increasing pressures and opportunities of globalization, the incorporation of international networking alliances has become an “essential mechanism for the internationalization of higher education”.&lt;ref&gt;Teather, D. (2004). The networking alliance: A mechanism for the internationalisation of higher education? Managing Education Matters, 7(2), 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Many universities from around the world have taken great strides to increase intercultural understanding through processes of organizational change and innovations. In general, university processes revolve around four major dimensions which include: organizational change, curriculum innovation, staff development, and student mobility.&lt;ref&gt;Rudzki, R. E. J. (1995). The application of a strategic management model to the internationalization of higher education institutions. Higher Education, 29(4), 421-422.&lt;/ref&gt; Ellingboe emphasizes these four major dimensions with his own specifications for the internationalization process. His specifications include: (1) college leadership; (2) faculty members' international involvement in activities with colleagues, research sites, and institutions worldwide; (3) the availability, affordability, accessibility, and transferability of study abroad programs for students; (4) the presence and integration of international students, scholars, and visiting faculty into campus life; and (5) international co-curricular units (residence halls, conference planning centers, student unions, career centers, cultural immersion and language houses, student activities, and student organizations).&lt;ref name="Bartell, M. 2003"/&gt;

Above all, universities need to make sure that they are open and responsive to changes in the outside environment. In order for internationalization to be fully effective, the university (including all staff, students, curriculum, and activities) needs to be current with cultural changes, and willing to adapt to these changes.&lt;ref&gt;Cameron, K.S. (1984). Organizational adaptation and higher education. Journal of Higher Education 55(2), 123.&lt;/ref&gt; As stated by Ellingboe, internationalization “is an ongoing, future-oriented, multidimensional, interdisciplinary, leadership-driven vision that involves many stakeholders working to change the internal dynamics of an institution to respond and adapt appropriately to an increasingly diverse, globally focused, ever-changing external environment".&lt;ref&gt;Ellingboe, B.J. (1998). Divisional strategies to internationalize a campus portrait: Results, resistance, and recommendations from a case study at a U.S. university, in Mestenhauser, J.A. and Ellingboe, B.J (eds.), Reforming the Higher Education Curriculum: Internationalizing the Campus. Phoenix, AZ: American Council on Education and Oryx Press, 199.&lt;/ref&gt; New distance learning technologies, such as interactive teleconferencing, enable students located thousands of miles apart to communicate and interact in a virtual classroom.&lt;ref&gt;Bartell, M. (2003). Internationalization of universities: A university culture-based framework. Higher Education, 45(1), 48.&lt;/ref&gt;

Research has indicated that certain themes and images such as children, animals, life cycles, relationships, and sports can transcend cultural differences, and may be used in international settings such as traditional and online university classrooms to create common ground among diverse cultures (Van Hook, 2011).&lt;ref&gt;Van Hook, S.R. (2011, 11 April). Modes and models for transcending cultural differences in international classrooms. Journal of Research in International Education, 10(1), 5-27. http://jri.sagepub.com/content/10/1/5&lt;/ref&gt;

The main theories for cross-cultural communication are based on the work done looking at value differences between different cultures, especially the works of [[Edward T. Hall]], [[Richard D. Lewis]], [[Geert Hofstede]], and [[Fons Trompenaars]]. [[Clifford Geertz]] was also a contributor to this field. Also Jussi V. Koivisto's model on cultural crossing in internationally operating organizations elaborates from this base of research.

These theories have been applied to a variety of different communication theories and settings, including general business and management ([[Fons Trompenaars]] and [[Charles Hampden-Turner]]) and marketing ([[Marieke de Mooij]], [[Stephan Dahl]]). There have also been several successful educational projects which concentrate on the practical applications of these theories in cross-cultural situations.

These theories have also been criticized mainly by management scholars (e.g. [[Nigel Holden]]) for being based on the culture concept derived from 19th century cultural anthropology and emphasizing on culture-as-difference and culture-as-essence. Another criticism has been the uncritical way [[Hofstede]]’s dimensions are served up in textbooks as facts ([[Peter W. Cardon]]). There is a move to focus on 'cross-cultural interdependence' instead of the traditional views of comparative differences and similarities between cultures. Cross-cultural management is increasingly seen as a form of [[knowledge management]]. While there is debate in academia, over what cross-cultural teams can do in practice, a meta-analysis by [[Günter Stahl]], [[Martha Maznevski]], [[Andreas Voigt]] and [[Karsten Jonsen]] on research done on multicultural groups, concluded "Research suggests that cultural diversity leads to process losses through task conflict and decreased social integration, but to process gains through increased creativity and satisfaction." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stahl|first1=Günter|last2=Maznevski|first2=Martha|last3=Voigt|first3=Andreas|last4=Jonsen|first4=Karsten|title=Unraveling the Effects of Cultural Diversity in Teams: A Meta-Analysis of Research on Multicultural Work Groups|journal=Journal of International Business Studies|date=May 2010|volume=41|issue=4|pages=690–709|jstor=40604760}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many [[Master of Science in Management]] programs have an internationalization specialization which may place a focus on cross-cultural communication. For example, the [[Ivey Business School]] has a course titled Cross Cultural Management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cross Cultural Management|url=https://www.ivey.uwo.ca/msc/courses/cross-cultural-management/|website=Ivey Business School|accessdate=5 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cross cultural communication gives opportunities to share ideas, experiences, and different perspectives and perception by interacting with local people.

==International educational organizations==

===WYSE International===

[[WYSE International]] is a worldwide educational charity specializing in education and development for emerging leaders established in 1989. It is a non-governmental organization associated with the [[Department of Public Information]] of the United Nations.

Over 3000 participants from 110 countries have attended their courses, they have run in 5 continents. Its flagship International Leadership Programme is a 12-day residential course for 30 people from on average 20 different countries (aged 18 – 35).

WYSE International's website states its aims are to:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"provide education independently of political, religious or social backgrounds and promote visionary leadership capable of responding to evolving world needs."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wyse-ngo.org/ WYSE International website&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===MEET - Middle East Education through Technology===

[[MEET - Middle East Education through Technology]] is an innovative educational initiative aimed at creating a common professional language between Israeli and Palestinian young leaders. Israeli and Palestinian students are selected through an application process and work in small bi-national teams to develop technology and business projects for local impact. Through this process of cross-cultural communication, students build mutual respect, cultural competence and understanding of each others.

==Aspects==
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2013}}

There are several parameters that may be perceived differently by people of different cultures:

* High- and low-context cultures: context is the most important cultural dimension and also difficult to define. The idea of context in culture was advanced by the anthropologist Edward T Hall. He divides culture into two main groups: High and Low context cultures. He refers to context as the stimuli, environment or ambiance surrounding the environment.  Depending on how a culture relies on the three points to communicate their meaning, will place them in either high or low- context cultures. For example, Hall goes on to explain that low-context cultures assume that the individuals know very little about what they are being told, and therefore must be given a lot of background information. High-context cultures assume the individual is knowledgeable about the subject and has to be given very little background information.
* Nonverbal, oral and written: the main goal behind improving intercultural audiences is to pay special attention to specific areas of communication to enhance the effectiveness of the intercultural messages. The specific areas are broken down into three sub categories: nonverbal, oral and written messages.

Nonverbal contact involves everything from something as obvious as eye contact and facial expressions to more discreet forms of expression such as the use of space. Experts have labeled the term [[kinesics]] to mean communicating through body movement. Huseman, author of ''Business Communication'', explains that the two most prominent ways of communication through kinesics are eye contact and facial expressions.

Eye contact, Huseman goes on to explain, is the key factor in setting the tone between two individuals and greatly differs in meaning between cultures. In the Americas and Western Europe, eye contact is interpreted the same way, conveying interest and honesty. People who avoid eye contact when speaking are viewed in a negative light, withholding information and lacking in general confidence. However, in the Middle East, Africa, and especially Asia, eye contact is seen as disrespectful and even challenging of one's authority. People who make eye contact, but only briefly, are seen as respectful and courteous. 

Facial expressions are their own language by comparison and universal throughout all cultures. Dale Leathers, for example, states that facial expression can communicate ten basic classes of meaning.

The final part to nonverbal communication lies in our gestures, and can be broken down into five subcategories:
* '''Emblems'''
Emblems refer to sign language (such as, thumbs up, one of the most recognized symbols in the world) 
* '''Illustrators''' 
Illustrators mimic what is spoken (such as gesturing how much time is left by holding up a certain number of fingers). 
* '''Regulators''' 
Regulators act as a way of conveying meaning through gestures (raising up a hand for instance indicates that one has a certain question about what was just said) and become more complicated since the same regulator can have different meanings across different cultures (making a circle with a hand, for instance, in the Americas means agreement, in Japan is symbolic for money, and in France conveys the notion of worthlessness). 
* '''Affect displays''' 
Affect displays reveal emotions such as happiness (through a smile) or sadness (mouth trembling, tears). 
* '''Adaptors'''
Adaptors are more subtle such as a yawn or clenching fists in anger.

The last nonverbal type of communication deals with communication through the space around people, or proxemics. Huseman goes on to explain that Hall identifies three types of space:
# Feature-fixed space: deals with how cultures arrange their space on a large scale, such as buildings and parks.  
# Semifixed feature space: deals with how space is arranged inside buildings, such as the placement of desks, chairs and plants.
# Informal space: the space and its importance, such as talking distance, how close people sit to one another and office space are all examples. A production line worker often has to make an appointment to see a supervisor, but the supervisor is free to visit the production line workers at will.

Oral and written communication is generally easier to learn, adapt and deal with in the business world for the simple fact that each language is unique. The one difficulty that comes into play is [[paralanguage]], how something is said.

==Differences between Western communication and traditional Indigenous communication==

According to Michael Walsh and [[Ghil'ad Zuckermann]],{{qualify evidence}} Western conversational interaction is typically "dyadic", between two particular people, where eye contact is important and the speaker controls the interaction; and "contained" in a relatively short, defined time frame. However, traditional Australian Aboriginal conversational interaction is "communal", broadcast to many people, eye contact is not important, the listener controls the interaction; and "continuous", spread over a longer, indefinite time frame.&lt;ref name=Engaging&gt;{{citation|url=https://arts.adelaide.edu.au/linguistics/guide.pdf|title=ENGAGING - A Guide to Interacting Respectfully and Reciprocally with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander People, and their Arts Practices and Intellectual Property|author=[[Ghil'ad Zuckermann|Zuckermann, Ghil'ad]] et al|publisher=Australian Government: Indigenous Culture Support|year=2015|p=12|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160330114112/http://arts.adelaide.edu.au/linguistics/guide.pdf|archivedate=30 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://digitalcollections.anu.edu.au/handle/1885/47329|publisher=Australian National University, North Australia Research Unit|author=Walsh, Michael|year=1997|title=Cross cultural communication problems in Aboriginal Australia|pp=7–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Drop City''' was a [[counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]] artists' community that formed in southern [[Colorado]] in 1965. Abandoned by the early 1970s, Drop City became known as the first rural "hippie commune".&lt;ref&gt;Rabbit, Peter. (1971). ''Drop City''. The Olympia Press, Inc. p. cover [http://sprg.ssl.berkeley.edu/~jmcd/book/revs3/dcty.html Review]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Establishment==
In 1965, the four original founders, Gene Bernofsky ("Curly"), JoAnn Bernofsky ("Jo"), Richard Kallweit ("Lard"), and [[Clark Richert]] ("Clard"), art students and filmmakers from the [[University of Kansas]] and [[University of Colorado at Boulder|University of Colorado]], bought&lt;ref&gt;Miller writes that the land was bought for $450 on May 3, 1965. Matthews agrees on the date but puts the price at $750. He writes that Bernofsky and Richert paid cash derived from sale of some marijuana.&lt;/ref&gt; a {{convert|7|acre|m2|adj=on}} tract of land about four miles (6&amp;nbsp;km) north of [[Trinidad, Colorado|Trinidad]], in southeastern Colorado. Their intention was to create a live-in work of [[Drop Art]], continuing an art concept they had developed earlier at the University of Kansas. Drop Art (sometimes called "droppings") was informed by the "happenings" of [[Allan Kaprow]] and the impromptu performances, a few years earlier, of [[John Cage]], [[Robert Rauschenberg]], and [[Buckminster Fuller]], at [[Black Mountain College]].

As Drop City gained notoriety in the 1960s [[Counterculture|underground]], people from around the world came to stay and work on the construction projects. Inspired by the architectural ideas of [[Buckminster Fuller]] and [[Steve Baer]], residents constructed domes and [[zonohedra]] to house themselves, using geometric panels made from the metal of [[automobile]] roofs and other inexpensive materials. In 1967 the group, now consisting of 10 core people, won Buckminster Fuller's Dymaxion award&lt;ref&gt;The most important part was a check for $500. Matthews writes (p. 165) "The Dymaxion award has never been heard of since."&lt;/ref&gt; for their constructions. [[The Firesign Theatre]] folks had a commercial—"kids, tear the top off your daddy's car, and send it, together with 10 cents in cash or coin, to Drop City, Colorado..."

The community grew in reputation and size, accelerated by media attention, including news reports on national television networks. The peak of Drop City's fame was the Joy Festival in June 1967,&lt;ref&gt;Curl, Chapter 17&lt;/ref&gt;    which attracted hundreds of hippies, some of whom stayed on.&lt;ref&gt;Gene "Curly" Bernofsky later wrote that nationwide attention contributed to the commune's demise {{cite web |url=http://www.clui.org/clui_4_1/lotl/lotlsu96/feedback.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-03-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070302142302/http://clui.org/clui_4_1/lotl/lotlsu96/feedback.html |archivedate=2007-03-02 |df= }}. Matthews writes (p. 188) that Bernofsky hid in his dome throughout the Joy Festival, and quit, disgusted, the very next day.&lt;/ref&gt; With the complex of eight domes and geometric buildings constructed, Curly and Jo, the only official owners of the property, signed it over to a non-profit corporation consisting of the entire core group (then about a dozen). The deed stipulated that the land was "forever free and open to all people".&lt;ref&gt;Curl, p. 88&lt;/ref&gt; But tensions and personality conflicts were already a problem within the group, and soon became unbearable. By the end of 1968, some of the original occupants of the community had moved to [[Boulder, Colorado]], to start an artists' cooperative, "[[Criss-Cross (art cooperative)|Criss-Cross]]", whose purpose, like Drop City's, was to function in a "synergetic" interaction between peers (no bosses) to create experimental artistic innovation. Among the innovative endeavors to evolve out of Drop City are: 
* in 1969, the early [[solar energy]] company – [[Zomeworks]], in [[Albuquerque, NM]];
* the artists' group "Criss-Cross", operative in New York and Colorado in the 1970s;
* the development of the "61-Zone System" by ZomeTool of Boulder, Colorado;
* and in the early 1980s, an important discovery of a cubic fusion of interpenetrating [[fractal]] [[tetrahedra]] by Richard Kallweit.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

==Legacy==

By 1970, many [[intentional community|intentional communities]] had developed in Southern Colorado and Northern [[New Mexico]], some of which were inspired by Drop City. Libre, north of [[Gardner, Colorado]], was founded by several ex-"Droppers", and was among the more well known.  Some communities continue to exist in some form today (notably in the [[Taos, NM]] area).

At Drop City, [[debris]] and building remnants from the original settlement remain at the site today, though it is not inhabited. By 1977 it was abandoned, and the members of the non-profit who were still in touch decided to sell off the site to the cattle rancher next door.&lt;ref&gt;Curl writes (p. 233) that Curly and Jo were, in fact, opposed to the sale but were overruled.&lt;/ref&gt; The last of the iconic domes was taken down only in the late 1990s, by a truck repair facility which now occupies a portion of the site.

In 1993, an Indie Rock band from Sydney, Australia formed using the name [[Matthew J. Tow|Drop City]]. In 2007, a different, Denver based, Indie Rock band formed with the same name.

In 1971, author, and Drop City resident, Peter Rabbit's novel "Drop City" was published.

In 2003, author [[T. Coraghessan Boyle|T. C. Boyle's]] novel ''[[Drop City (novel)|Drop City]]'' was published.

In 2010, inspired by the Drop City commune, COMUNE opened a Drop City gallery space in the Los Angeles area.&lt;ref name=skateboardermag&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.skateboardermag.com/features/comune-drop-city-launch-party-recap/ |title=Comune Drop City Launch Party Recap |first=Christian |last=Senrud |work=Skateboarder Magazine|others=Sekora, Andrew, photographs |date=April 27, 2010 |issn=1535-2889 |oclc=45290411|location=San Clemente, CA, USA |publisher=GrindMedia, LLC|accessdate=March 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=COMUNE&gt;{{cite web |url= http://thecomune.com/team/drop-city/overview/ |title=DROP CITY OVERVIEW  |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |publisher=COMUNE |location=Los Angeles, CA, USA|accessdate=March 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The indie rock band Ultimate Painting, formed in 2013, is named after one of the paintings made by the Drop City community.

The '''Esperanto workers movement''' (''Laborista Esperanto-movado'') has the goal of taking practical advantage of the international planned language [[Esperanto]] for advancing the goals of the labour movement, especially the fight against unrestrained capitalism. It is not only a political movement in the strict sense but also a cultural and educational one. Currently the principal Esperanto associations active in the Esperanto workers movement at the global level are the ''[[Sennacieca Asocio Tutmonda]]'' (SAT, “World Anational Association”) and the ''[[Internacia Komunista Esperantista Kolektivo]]'' (IKEK, an international collective of communist Esperantists), and in a wider sense, the ''[[Monda Asembleo Socia]]'' (MAS, “World social assembly”).
[[File:Poshtkarto-kapitalismo-rodo.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Postcard designed by Ludovic Rodo for the First Esperanto Workers Congress (''Unua Laborista Esperanto-Kongreso''), planned for Paris in 1914 but which never took place]]

==History==
===Labour movement===
If scientists, business people and transport workers, who usually understood at least a few foreign languages, lacked multilingual opportunities and felt the need for an international language, it imposed a still greater need for global understanding among workers in the international labour movement, the majority of whom generally knew only their mother tongue. Those who first became aware of the value of Esperanto for themselves were mostly ordinary labourers; lacking formal training in grammar, with great effort they appropriated Esperanto for their own needs and pioneered the language's diffusion.

===Local groups prior to World War I===
The first Esperantist worker groups were founded between 1905 and 1908 in [[The Hague]], [[Hamburg]], [[Munich]], [[Paris]], [[Stockholm]] and elsewhere. In the [[United Kingdom]], the British League of Esperanto Socialists was established in 1907, but there were apparently no local groups. In 1911, separate Esperantist workers associations were founded in [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Germany]] and the [[Netherlands]], and the national newspapers ''Antaŭen'' (“Forward”, Germany), ''Arbeider-Esperantist'' (“Worker Esperantist,” Netherlands), ''Kulturo'' (“Culture,” Czechoslovakia) and ''Le travailleur Esperantiste'' (“The Esperantist worker,” France) began publication; an international organ for worker Esperantists had already appeared earlier, begun by Marcelo Verema (the pseudonym of [[Paul Berthelot]], 1881–1910). Berthelot published in 1906 the ''Rondiranta folio por la kreado de tutmonda Socia Revuo'', a [[prospectus (book)|prospectus]] for the creation of a global social review. Later, pursuant to a resolution of the 1906 so-called ''Ruĝula Kongreseto'' (“Little conference of Reds”),&lt;ref name="encyc_L"&gt;''[http://www.plansprachen.ch/23_ENCYCL_ESPERANTO_L.pdf Laboristoj]'' (“Workers”), in ''Enciklopedio de Esperanto,'' accessed 6 August 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; held in Geneva, the first monthly issue of the ''Internacia  Socia Revuo'' was published in January 1907. Editors included Fi-Blan-Go (the pseudonym of [[Fernand Blangarin]], 1886–1914), from 1907 to 1909; [[Jacob Leendert Bruijn]] (1880–1954), from 1910 to 1911; and [[Wijtze Nutters]] (1872–1926), from 1912 to 1914. Sometimes, due to insufficient funds in the last part of the year, they were only able to publish once every two or three months, but by 1913 the number of subscribers had already surpassed 600, across nearly 20 countries; readers and collaborators were to be found even in [[Russian Empire|tsarist Russia]]. Between 1912 and 1914 the publishing house of the ''Internacia  Socia Revuo'' brought out a series of works by Berthelot, [[Enrico Ferri]], [[Ferdinand Domela Nieuwenhuis]], [[Peter Kropotkin]], [[Ferdinand Lassalle]], [[Wilhelm Liebknecht]], [[Jack London]], [[Silvio Gesell]] and [[Victor Hugo]]; D. J. Ivanski and Wijtze Nutters did significant translation work. With the outbreak of [[World War I|war in 1914]] the ''Internacia  Socia Revuo'' ceased publication; in 1920 Nutters tried to revive the magazine, but he only managed to produce six issues.

===First global organization===
A worldwide workers organization was established in 1906, the ''Internacia Asocio Paco-Libereco'' (“International peace and freedom association”), later known as ''Liberiga Stelo'' (“Liberating star”); the principal activists were Fi-Blan-Go and R. Louis. The goals were to resist militarism and capitalism and to spread Esperanto among internationalists, socialists and fighters for liberation and self-determination. The association published several pamphlets in opposition to militarism, nationalism and clericalism; these writings were its first Esperanto workers publications. However, the association, which accepted only individuals and local group as members, did not find many followers outside France. The Czech and German workers associations developed two different international organizational projects; both aimed at evolving their groups into an international conference of working Esperantists that would meet simultaneously with the 1914 tenth [[World Esperanto Congress]] (''Universala Kongreso de Esperanto'') in Paris, but this was not implemented. At the earlier World Congresses in Geneva (1906), Cambridge (1907), Antwerp (1911), Kraków (1912) and Bern (1913), the workers took part in special gatherings as the so-called ''Ruĝula Kongreseto'' (“Little conference of Reds”). These enabled awareness and exchange of experiences, but had no have practical results. In 1911, the [[Universal Esperanto Association]] tried to set up a special interest group for workers, but did not succeed. Generally, the Esperanto workers movement until 1914 worked mainly to promote the Esperanto language.

==After World War I==

===The founding of SAT===
Coincident with the 1921 [[World Esperanto Congress]] in [[Prague]], the ''Liberiga Stelo'' group, which incljuded 80 participants from 75 countries, held its first world conference and decided to rename itself as the ''[[Sennacieca Asocio Tutmonda]]'' (SAT). Membership in SAT is on an individual basis; it does not have local or national sections. A characteristic feature of SAT's organization is that its leadership, the ''Ĝenerala Konsilantaro'' (General Council), elected by the entire membership, does not represent countries or nations but so-called sectors. In order to avoid the influence of nationalism on the leadership, the surface of the earth was divided into arbitrary sectors according to hours of the meridian, and the council had one representative chosen from each sector; that council then chose the governing board of the association, which it aids and advises. After 1933 the board, elected by the entire membership, also included representatives of the Esxperantist workers associations that signed a convention with SAT.

In 1924-25 SAT survived a small crisis. Several [[anarchism|anarchist]] SAT members, distressed that SAT publications would not permit articles opposed to communism or to the Soviet Union, established their own organization, the Global League of Non-State Esperantists (''Tutmonda Ligo de Esperantistaj Senŝtatanoj'', TLES) and published a bimonthly periodical ''Libera Laboristo'' (“Free Worker”). Other groups were founded from time to time, including the ''Internacio de Proleta Esperantistaro'' (“Proletarian Esperantists International”, founded in 1932) and Internacio de Socialistaj Esperantistoj “Socialist Esperantists International”, 1933).

===Persecutions in the USSR===
While SAT was eventually banned or persecuted in the Soviet-bloc countries, except in Yugoslavia, where  several congresses were held, associations appeared in these countries that declared themselves as workers associations and that acted as part of the so-called neutral movement through ''Mondpaca Esperantista Unuiĝo'' (“United Esperantists for world peace”). After the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]], however, this group disappeared, as well as many other Eastern European associations that no longer received support from their respective national governments.

== History ==
In 1995, the enlargement of the [[European Union]] led to the creation of the [[Nordic Green Left Alliance|Nordic Green Left]] group of parties. The Nordic Green Left (NGL) merged with the [[European United Left (1994–95)|Confederal Group of the European United Left]] (GUE) on 6 January 1995,&lt;ref name="t1s4"/&gt; forming the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left.&lt;ref name="t1s5"/&gt;&lt;ref name="t1s6"/&gt;&lt;ref name="t1s40"/&gt; The NGL suffix was added to the name of the expanded group on insistence of Swedish and Finnish MEPs.&lt;ref name="RaunioTiilikainen2013"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Tapio Raunio|author2=Teija Tiilikainen|title=Finland in the European Union|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wzkF4lCzIJ4C&amp;pg=PA59|date=5 September 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-135-76204-9|page=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group initially consisted of MEPs from the Finnish [[Left Alliance (Finland)|Left Alliance]], the Swedish [[Left Party (Sweden)|Left Party]], the Danish [[Socialist People's Party (Denmark)|Socialist People's Party]], the [[United Left (Spain)|United Left of Spain]] (including the [[Communist Party of Spain|Spanish Communist Party]]), the [[Synaspismos]] of Greece, the [[French Communist Party]], the [[Portuguese Communist Party]], the [[Communist Party of Greece]] and the [[Communist Refoundation Party]] of Italy.

In 1999, the German [[Party of Democratic Socialism (Germany)|Party of Democratic Socialism]] (PDS) and the Greek [[Democratic Social Movement]] (DIKKI) joined as full members while the five MEPs elected from the list of the French Trotskyist alliance [[Lutte Ouvrière|LO]]–[[Revolutionary Communist League (France)|LCR]] joined as associate members.

In 2002, four MEPs from the French [[Citizen and Republican Movement]] also joined the group.

In 2004, no MEPs were elected from LO–LCR and DIKKI—which was undergoing a dispute with its leader over the party constitution—did not put forward candidates. MEPs from the Portuguese [[Left Bloc]], the borth Irish and Northern Irish [[Sinn Féin]], the [[Progressive Party of Working People]] of Cyprus and the [[Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia]] joined the group.

== Position ==
According to its 1994 constituent declaration, the group is opposed to the present [[European Union]] political structure, but it is committed to integration.&lt;ref name="EULNGLConDec"/&gt; That declaration sets out three aims for the construction of another European Union, namely the total change of institutions to make them fully democratic, breaking with neo-liberal monetarist policies, and a policy of co-development and equitable cooperation. The group wants to disband the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organisation]] (NATO) and strengthen the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] (OSCE).

The group is ambiguous between reformism and revolution, leaving it up to each party to decide on the manner they deem best suited to achieve these aims. As such, it has simultaneously positioned itself as insiders within the European institutions, enabling it to influence the decisions made by co-decision; and as outsiders by its willingness to seek another Europe which would abolish the [[Maastricht Treaty]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}

== Organisation ==
The GUE/NGL is a confederal group who is composed of [[Member of the European Parliament|MEPs]] from national parties. Those national parties must share common political objectives with the group as specified in the group's constituent declaration. Nevertheless, those national parties and not the group retain control of their MEPs, therefore the group may be divided on certain issues.

Members of the group meet regularly to prepare for meetings, debate on policies and vote on resolutions. The group also publishes reports on various topics.

=== Member parties ===
MEPs may be full or associate members.
* Full members must accept the constitutional declaration of the group.
* Associate members need not fully do so, but they may sit with the full members.

National parties may be full or associate members.
* Full member parties must accept the constitutional declaration of the group.
* Associate member parties may include parties that do not have MEPs (e.g. French Trotskyist parties which did not get elected in the 2004 European elections), are from states that are not part of the European Union, or do not wish to be full members.

The '''European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Cooperation''', better known under the name '''Europol''', formerly the '''European Police Office''' and '''Europol Drugs Unit''', is the [[law enforcement agency]] of the [[European Union]] (EU) formed in 1998 to handle [[criminal intelligence]] and combat serious international [[organised crime]] and [[terrorism]] through cooperation between competent authorities of EU [[Member state of the European Union|member states]]. The Agency has no executive powers, and its officials are not entitled to [[arrest]] suspects or act without prior approval from competent authorities in the member states. Seated in [[The Hague]], [[South Holland]]. It comprised 1,065 staff in 2016.

==History==
=== Origins and establishment ===
[[File:DenHaag-Former-Europol03.jpg|left|thumb|Europol headquarters from 1994 to 2011 in&amp;nbsp;[[The Hague]], pictured in 2010]]Europol has its origins in [[TREVI]], a forum for security cooperation created amongst [[European Economic Community|European Community]] interior and justice ministers in 1976. At first, TREVI focused on international terrorism, but soon started to cover other areas of cross-border crime within the Community. At the European Summit in Luxembourg on 28–29 June 1991, German Chancellor [[Helmut Kohl]] called for the creation of a European police agency similar to the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI)—thus sowing the seeds of police cooperation across Europe. At the Summit, the [[European Council]] agreed to establish "a Central European Criminal Investigations Office (Europol) by 31 December 1993 the latest."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/summits/luxembourg/default_en.htm|title=Luxembourg European Summit - Conclusions of the Presidency (SN 151/3/91)|last=|first=|date=June 1991|website=www.europarl.europa.eu|publisher=European Parliament|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170611030612/http://www.europarl.europa.eu/summits/luxembourg/default_en.htm|archive-date=11 June 2017|dead-url=no|access-date=22 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Statewatching the New Europe: Handbook on the European State|last=Bunyan|first=Tony|publisher=Statewatch|year=1993|isbn=978-1874481027|editor-last=Bunyan|editor-first=Tony|location=|pages=|chapter=Trevi, Europol and the European state|citeseerx = 10.1.1.175.888}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.europol.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/anniversary-publication.pdf|title=1998-2016 Looking Back, Moving Forward: One Hundred Meetings of the Europol Management Board|last=|first=|publisher=Publications Office of the European Union|year=2016|isbn=978-92-95200-73-9|location=Luxembourg|pages=|agency=Europol|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170922100027/https://www.europol.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/anniversary-publication.pdf|archivedate=22 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.europol.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/anniversary-publication.pdf|title=Ten Years of Europol, 1999-2009|last=|first=|publisher=Europol|year=2009|isbn=|location=The Hague|pages=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170922100027/https://www.europol.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/anniversary-publication.pdf|archivedate=22 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.politico.eu/article/europes-intelligence-black-hole-europol-fbi-cia-paris-counter-terrorism/|title=Europe’s intelligence ‘black hole’|date=3 December 2015|work=POLITICO|access-date=22 September 2017|language=en-US|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170917094706/http://www.politico.eu/article/europes-intelligence-black-hole-europol-fbi-cia-paris-counter-terrorism/|archivedate=17 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of the Luxembourg Summit was further elaborated at the European Council in Maastricht on 9–10 December 1991, a meeting to draft the [[Maastricht Treaty]]. The European Council agreed to create "a European police office (Europol) the initial function of which would be to organize exchange of information on narcotic drugs". The Council likewise instructed TREVI ministers to take measures in setting up the office.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/summits/maastricht/default_en.htm|title=Maastricht European Summit - Conclusions of the Presidency (SN 271/1/91)|last=|first=|date=December 1991|website=www.europarl.europa.eu|publisher=European Parliament|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170611030613/http://www.europarl.europa.eu/summits/maastricht/default_en.htm|archive-date=11 June 2017|dead-url=no|access-date=22 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 7 February 1992, Europol was enshrined with more substance in Article K.1, section 9, as the Maastricht Treaty was signed:&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;[...] Member States shall regard the following areas as matters of common interest: [...] police cooperation for the purposes of preventing and combatting terrorism, unlawful drug trafficking and other serious forms of international crime, including if necessary certain aspects of customs cooperation, in connection with the organization of a Union-wide system for exchanging information within a European Police Office (Europol).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=29 July 1992|title=Treaty on European Union, signed at Maastricht on 7 February 1992|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=OJ:C:1992:191:FULL&amp;from=EN|journal=Official Journal of the European Communities|volume=35|pages=|issn=0378-6986|via=EUR-Lex}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Europol was first de facto organised provisionally in 1993 as the Europol Drugs Unit (EDU) in Strasbourg at the same site as the [[Schengen Information System]] was hosted. The small initial group started operations there in January 1994 under the leadership of [[Jürgen Storbeck]] and with a mandate to assist national police forces in criminal investigations. The competition for the permanent site of Europol during the period was between The Hague, Rome and Strasbourg—the European Council decided on 29 October 1993 that Europol should be established in The Hague. A former Catholic boys school built in 1910 at Raamweg 47 was chosen as the precise location. The house was used in [[World War II]] by police and intelligence agencies and after the War manned by the Dutch State Intelligence Service until Europol relocated there later in 1994.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rijksvastgoedbedrijf.nl/vastgoed/projecten-in-uitvoering/den-haag-raamweg|title=Den Haag, Raamweg 47|last=Rijksvastgoedbedrijf|first=|date=2016-09-27|website=www.rijksvastgoedbedrijf.nl|language=nl-NL|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170922050903/https://www.rijksvastgoedbedrijf.nl/vastgoed/projecten-in-uitvoering/den-haag-raamweg|archive-date=22 September 2017|dead-url=no|access-date=21 September 2017|quote=Office in classical school building from 1910.

=== Reformation as a European Union agency ===
Europol was fully integrated into the European Union with Council Decision 2009/371/JHA of 6 April 2009. It replaced the Europol Convention and reformed Europol as an [[Agencies of the European Union|EU agency]] (i.e. subject to the general rules and procedures applicable to all EU agencies) on 1 January 2010 due to different aspirations, such as enhanced support to Member States on countering serious and organised crime, budgetary control by the [[European Parliament]], and administrative simplification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=|first=|date=15 May 2009|title=Council Decision of 6 April 2009 establishing the European Police Office (Europol) (2009/371/JHA)|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2009:121:0037:0066:EN:PDF|journal=Official Journal of the European Union|volume=L|pages=|accessdate=20 September 2017|via=EUR-Lex|number=121}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.clingendael.org/sites/default/files/2016-02/20090930_cesp_paper_swolff_police_cooperation.pdf|title=From The Hague to Stockholm: The Future of EU's Internal Security Achitecture and Police Cooperation|last=Wolff|first=Sarah|publisher=Netherlands Institute of International Relations Clingendael|year=2009|isbn=|location=The Hague|pages=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170923095732/https://www.clingendael.org/sites/default/files/2016-02/20090930_cesp_paper_swolff_police_cooperation.pdf|archivedate=23 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 January 2013, Director [[Rob Wainwright (Europol)|Rob Wainwright]] and European Commissioner for Home Affairs [[Cecilia Malmström]] launched the ''[[European Cybercrime Centre]]'' (EC3 or EC³), a unit of Europol tasked with assisting Member States to dismantle and disrupt [[cybercrime]] committed by organised groups to generate large criminal profits (e.g. online fraud), causing serious harm to victims (e.g. online child sexual exploitation) or affecting critical infrastructure and systems in the [[European Union|EU]].

The European Parliament approved Europol's new legal framework, Regulation (EU) 2016/794, on 11 May 2016 after three years of negotiations and thus repealed the former Decisions of 2009.

[[Denmark]] was not permitted to participate in the 2016 recast Europol Regulation due to its [[opt-out]] from the [[Area of freedom, security and justice]].  In a [[Danish European Union opt-out referendum, 2015|December 2015 referendum]] it rejected converting its opt-out to a case-by-case opt-in, which would have allowed it to participate in the new regulation and remain a member of Europol. However, Denmark and the European Union agreed on a cooperation deal in December 2016.

Europol started the [[Stop Child Abuse – Trace an Object]] campaign and website on 31 May 2017. The site's objective is to display objects in [[child sexual abuse]] images to try to find the perpetrators and victims—in hope that distinct details, such as a logo on a bag or a shampoo bottle, can be identified by the public who can then forward the information by an anonymous tip-off or social media. The approach was called [[crowdsourcing]] by the investigators.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.europol.europa.eu/stopchildabuse|title=Stop Child Abuse – Trace an Object|work=Europol|access-date=22 September 2017|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170922212105/https://www.europol.europa.eu/stopchildabuse|archivedate=22 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-40115549|title=Police publish child abuse clues online|date=1 June 2017|work=BBC News|access-date=22 September 2017|language=en-GB|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170729095059/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-40115549|archivedate=29 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bellingcat]], the investigative search network, reported that several objects had been positively identified following its attempt&amp;nbsp;to support Europol's call.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2017/06/15/update-crowdsourcing-europols-stop-child-abuse-trace-object-campaign/|title=Update on Crowdsourcing Europol’s “Stop Child Abuse – Trace an Object” Campaign|last=|first=|date=15 June 2017|work=bellingcat|access-date=22 September 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170920233707/https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2017/06/15/update-crowdsourcing-europols-stop-child-abuse-trace-object-campaign/|archive-date=20 September 2017|dead-url=no|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Governance, accountability and relations==
The Europol Directorate'','' day-to-day leadership of the Agency, is appointed by the EU [[Justice and Home Affairs Council]] (JHA) for four-year terms. As of 2018, the Agency is headed by Executive Director [[Catherine De Bolle]]. The Agency is accountable to and controlled by the Justice and Home Affairs Council. Together with the European Parliament, the Council approves Europol's budget and regulations related to its work. The Council forwards an annual special report to the European Parliament on the work of the Agency—and the Parliament also discharges Europol from its responsibility for managing a set budget. Before 2009, the Agency was an international body and thus the European Parliament lacked effective scrutiny powers over it. From 2009 to 2017, the European Parliament had been the sole organ in parliamentary control of Europol. The Joint Parliamentary Scrutiny Group (JPSG) was created at the EU Speakers Conference in Bratislava on 23-25 April 2017 to allow both the European Parliament and national EU parliaments to exert control over Europol.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://nbn-resolving.de/urn:nbn:de:0168-ssoar-52110-0|title=A Watchdog for Europe's Policemen: The Joint Parliamentary Scrutiny Group for Europol|last=Kreilinger|first=Valentin|date=2017|series=Policy Paper / Jacques Delors Institute|location=Berlin|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.parleu2017.ee/en/events/meeting-joint-parliamentary-scrutiny-group-europol|title=Meeting of the Joint Parliamentary Scrutiny Group on EUROPOL|last=|first=|date=22 September 2017|website=www.parleu2017.ee|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170923003237/https://www.parleu2017.ee/en/events/meeting-joint-parliamentary-scrutiny-group-europol|archive-date=23 September 2017|dead-url=no|access-date=22 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.europol.europa.eu/about-europol/accountability|title=Accountability|work=Europol|access-date=19 September 2017|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170830165632/https://www.europol.europa.eu/about-europol/accountability|archivedate=30 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The Europol Management Board comprises representatives from all of the Member State and from the European Commission, each having one vote. Decisions of the Board require a [[supermajority]] and it meets at least twice per year on Europol's current and future activities as well as on adopting the [[budget]], programming material and general annual reports. The Board forwards its decisions to the Justice and Home Affairs Council for the Council's perusal. The Management Board functions include data protection, internal audit and accountancy.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

External financial oversight of the Agency is conducted by the [[European Court of Auditors]] (ECA); for example, ECA evaluated Europol in 2017 on anti-[[radicalization]] programmes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.politico.eu/article/eu-court-of-auditors-to-assess-anti-radicalization-counter-terrorism-security-programs/|title=EU Court of Auditors to assess anti-radicalization programs|date=6 April 2017|work=POLITICO|access-date=22 September 2017|language=en-US|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170923002420/http://www.politico.eu/article/eu-court-of-auditors-to-assess-anti-radicalization-counter-terrorism-security-programs/|archivedate=23 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Internal control]] is carried out by the Internal Audit Service of the European Commission as well as by the Europol Management Board-appointed Internal Audit Function. The [[European Ombudsman]] is tasked with investigating complaints against EU institutions and bodies, including Europol, as well as assisting to create a more transparent, effective, accountable and ethical administration.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; As of 1 May 2017, the [[European Data Protection Supervisor]]&amp;nbsp;(EDPS) has been responsible for supervising the Agency's data protection measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://edps.europa.eu/node/3336|title=New Regulation boosts the roles of EDPS and Europol|last=|first=|date=19 May 2016|website=European Data Protection Supervisor|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170923002501/https://edps.europa.eu/node/3336|archive-date=23 September 2017|dead-url=no|access-date=22 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Director of Europol is able to enter into agreements for Europol with other countries and international organizations. As of September 2017, Europol cooperates on an operational basis with [[Albania]], [[Australia]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Canada]], Denmark, [[Colombia]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Iceland]], [[Liechtenstein]], [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]], [[Moldova]], [[Monaco]], [[Montenegro]], [[Norway]], [[Serbia]], [[Switzerland]], [[Ukraine]] and [[United States|United States of America]] and [[Interpol]].&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.europol.europa.eu/partners-agreements/operational-agreements|title=Operational Agreements|work=Europol|access-date=22 September 2017|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170922145243/https://www.europol.europa.eu/partners-agreements/operational-agreements|archivedate=22 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/other/dfat/treaties/2007/34.html "Agreement on Operational and Strategic Cooperation between Australia and the European Police Office (The Hague, 20 February 2007) - ATS 34 of 2007”].

'''''History of Woman Suffrage''''' is a book that was produced by [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]], [[Susan B. Anthony]], [[Matilda Joslyn Gage]] and [[Ida Husted Harper]].  Published in six volumes from 1881 to 1922, it is a history of the [[Women's suffrage in the United States|women's suffrage]] movement, primarily in the United States.  Its more than 5700 pages are the major source for primary documentation about the women's suffrage movement from its beginnings through the ratification of the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Nineteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution]], which [[enfranchised]] women in the U.S. in 1920.  Written from the viewpoint of the wing of the movement led by Stanton and Anthony, its coverage of rival groups and individuals is limited.

Realizing that the project was unlikely to make a profit, Anthony used money from a bequest in 1885 to buy the rights from the other authors and also the plates from the publisher of the two volumes that had already been issued.  As sole owner, she published the books herself and donated many copies to libraries and people of influence.  In her will, Anthony bequeathed the plates for all the volumes together with the existing inventory to the [[National American Woman Suffrage Association]].

==Writing and publishing==

[[Susan B. Anthony]] and [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]], leaders of [[National Woman Suffrage Association]] (NWSA), initiated the project of writing a history of the women's suffrage movement in 1876. The project dominated their lives for much of the next decade, although Anthony in particular also maintained a busy schedule of lecturing and other women's suffrage activities.  Originally envisioned as a modest publication that would take only four months to write,&lt;ref&gt;Harper (1898–1908), Vol. 1, [https://archive.org/stream/lifeandworksusa00unkngoog#page/n553/mode/2up pp. 480-481]&lt;/ref&gt;
it evolved into a work of more than 5700 pages written over a period of 41 years.  It was completed in 1922, long after the deaths of Stanton and Anthony in 1902 and 1906 respectively.

In the introduction the authors wrote: "We hope the contribution we have made may enable some other hand in the future to write a more complete history of 'the most momentous reform that has yet been launched on the world—the first organized protest against the injustice which has brooded over the character and destiny of one-half the human race.'"&lt;ref&gt;Stanton, Anthony, Gage, Harper (1881–1922), Vol. 1, [https://archive.org/stream/historyofwomansu01stanuoft#page/8/mode/2up p. 8].  The quote's author is identified as [[Wendell Phillips]] in ''The Hand Book of the National American Woman Suffrage Association'', 1894, Volumes 26–30, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=7IsLAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=RA2-PA170 170]&lt;/ref&gt;
The first volume is dedicated to the memory of pioneering women in the movement, with [[Mary Wollstonecraft]], author of ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]'' (1792), prominently listed first.

The first three volumes, which cover the history of the movement from its beginnings to 1885, were written and edited by Stanton, Anthony and [[Matilda Joslyn Gage]].  Volume 1 (1848–1861) appeared in 1881, Volume 2 (1861–1876) in 1882 and Volume 3 (1876–1885) in 1886.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon (2006), Vol. 4, [https://books.google.com/books?id=swByA6qRq6AC&amp;pg=PR25 p. xxv].  Not all sources agree on the publication date of Volume 2.  The copyright dates listed in the first three volumes themselves are 1881, 1881 and 1886 respectively.  Anthony's authorized biography, however, says on 
[https://archive.org/stream/lifeandworksusa01harpgoog#page/n53/mode/2up page 543] that Volume 2 was completed in April 1882.&lt;/ref&gt;
Some early chapters first appeared in Gage's newspaper, ''The National Citizen and Ballot Box''.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly (2005) [http://www.ioba.org/standard/2005/03/a-little-history-of-the-history-of-woman-suffrage/ "A Little History of ''The History of Woman Suffrage'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Anthony had for years saved letters, newspapers clippings, and similar materials of historical value to the women's suffrage movement. In 1876 she shipped several trunks and boxes of these materials to the Stanton house in New Jersey and moved into that household herself to begin working on the project with Stanton.&lt;ref&gt;Harper (1898–1908), Vol. 1, [https://archive.org/stream/lifeandworksusa00unkngoog#page/n553/mode/2up p. 480]&lt;/ref&gt;
Anthony hated this type of work.  In her letters, she said the project "makes me feel growly all the time... No warhorse ever panted for the rush of battle more than I for outside work.  I love to make history but hate to write it."&lt;ref&gt;Harper (1898–1908), Vol. 2, [https://archive.org/stream/lifeandworksusa01harpgoog#page/n123/mode/2up p. 602]&lt;/ref&gt;
The work inevitably led to disagreements.  Stanton's daughter Margaret reported that "Sometimes these disputes run so high that down go the pens, one sails out of one door and one out of the other, walking in opposite directions around the estate, and just as I have made up my mind that this beautiful friendship of forty years has at last terminated, I see them walking down the hill, arm in arm."&lt;ref&gt;"As a Mother," written by Elizabeth Cady Stanton's daughter Margaret.  A description of life in the Stanton household during the time when the ''History of Woman Suffrage'' was being written, it appeared in "The New Era," November, 1885, and is reprinted in Gordon (2006), Vol. 4, p. 560.&lt;/ref&gt;

When Stanton was ill for several months in 1881, her daughter [[Harriot Eaton Stanton Blatch|Harriet]] completed her editorial work for volume 2. Dismayed to learn that Anthony and Stanton had no plan for covering the history of the [[American Woman Suffrage Association]] (AWSA), a rival to their NWSA, Harriet Stanton also wrote that 107-page chapter herself with information gathered primarily from the ''[[Woman's Journal]]'', a periodical published by the AWSA.&lt;ref&gt;Ginzberg (2009), p. 157.  Her chapter on the "American Woman Suffrage Association" is Chapter XXVI in Volume 2, [https://archive.org/stream/historyofwomansu02stanuoft#page/756/mode/2up pages 756-862.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cullen-DuPont (2000), [https://books.google.com/books?id=oIro7MtiFuYC&amp;pg=PA116 p. 116]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Ellen Carol DuBois, a historian of the women's movement, "The initial volumes are very broadly conceived, a combination of Stanton's broad philosophical range, Anthony's organizational energies and Gage's historical sensibilities."&lt;ref name=dubois-213/&gt;
Anthony was the business manager.  Stanton wrote much of the text, providing it with her distinct historical interpretation.  Gage wrote several historical essays, including a long one that critically assesses Christianity's attitude toward women throughout history.&lt;ref name=dubois-213&gt;DuBois (1998), p. 213.  Gage's chapter on "Woman, Church and State" is Chapter XV in Volume 1, [https://archive.org/stream/historyofwomansu01stanuoft#page/n785/mode/2up pages 753-799].&lt;/ref&gt;
Gage also provided a significant number of historical documents to the project and was adept at tracking down additional documentation in libraries.&lt;ref&gt;Ginzberg (2009), p. 155&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to chronicling the movement's activities, the initial volumes include reminiscences of movement leaders and analyses of the historical causes of the condition of women.  They also contain a variety of primary materials, including letters, newspaper clippings, speeches, court transcripts and decisions, and conference reports.  Volume three includes essays by local women's rights activists who provided details about the history of the movement at the state level. At Anthony's insistence, the volumes were indexed by a professional indexer and include many expensive steel engravings of women's rights leaders.&lt;ref&gt;DuBois (1998), pp. 213-214&lt;/ref&gt;

A bequest of $24,000 from Eliza Jackson Eddy to Anthony in 1885 provided financial assistance for the completion of these volumes.&lt;ref&gt;Stanton, Anthony, Gage, Harper (1881–1922), Vol. 3, [https://archive.org/stream/historyofwomansu03stanuoft#page/n11/mode/2up pp. iii-iv]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harper (1898–1908), Vol. 2,  [https://archive.org/stream/lifeandworksusa01harpgoog#page/n117/mode/2up p. 598]&lt;/ref&gt;
Recognizing that there was little chance of the project showing a profit, Anthony paid Stanton and Gage for their shares of the rights to the books.  She issued Volume 3 in 1886, listing herself as publisher.  She also bought the plates of Volumes 1 and 2, which had already been published, from Fowler and Wells, the publisher, and reprinted them in 1887, again listing herself as publisher.  Anthony gave away over 1000 copies at her own expense, mailing them to political leaders and libraries in the U.S. and Europe. Publishing the first three volumes cost Anthony about $20,000.&lt;ref&gt;Harper (1898–1908), Vol. 2,  [https://archive.org/stream/lifeandworksusa01harpgoog#page/n135/mode/2up pp. 613-614]&lt;/ref&gt;

Volume 4, which covers the period from 1883 to 1900, was published by Anthony in 1902, when she was 82 years old.  Its editors are listed as Anthony and her younger protégé [[Ida Husted Harper]], but Harper did most of the work."&lt;ref&gt;DuBois (1998), p. 214&lt;/ref&gt;
(Anthony also chose Harper to write her biography.)  In an indication of the increased acceptance of the women's suffrage movement, [[Harvard University]] sent in an order for Volume 4.  Less than twenty years earlier, when Anthony sent the school free copies of the first three volumes, Harvard had declined the gift and returned the books.&lt;ref&gt;Harper (1898–1908), Vol. 3, [https://archive.org/stream/lifeandworksusa02harpgoog#page/n211/mode/2up p. 1279]&lt;/ref&gt;

Publishing the volumes herself presented a variety of problems for Anthony, including finding space for the inventory.  She was forced to limit the large number of books she was storing in the attic of the house she shared with sister because the weight was threatening to collapse the structure.&lt;ref&gt;Harper (1898–1908), Vol. 3, [https://archive.org/stream/lifeandworksusa02harpgoog#page/n209/mode/2up p. 1277]&lt;/ref&gt;

Volumes 5 and 6 were published in 1922 by the [[National American Woman Suffrage Association]] (NAWSA), long after Anthony's death in 1906.  Written edited by Harper, they are a pair of volumes that cover different aspects of the period from 1900 to 1920, the year that the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Nineteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution]] was ratified.  That amendment, popularly known as the Susan B. Anthony Amendment, prevents the denial of voting rights on the basis of sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Senators to Vote on Suffrage Today; Fate of Susan B. Anthony Amendment Hangs in Balance on Eve of Final Test |newspaper=New York Times |date= September 26, 1918 |url= https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F60F17F63E5511738DDDAF0A94D1405B888DF1D3 |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The last three volumes include detailed information about the NAWSA, documenting its conventions, officers, committee reports and activities on both a national and state-by-state basis.  The NAWSA was formed in 1890 by a merger of the [[National Woman Suffrage Association]] and the [[American Woman Suffrage Association]]. The former was led by Anthony and Stanton, while the latter was for twenty years its rival under the leadership of Lucy Stone.  Anthony was the dominant figure in the merged organization.&lt;ref&gt;Kerr (1992), [https://books.google.com/books?id=bvPpRyMcQzoC&amp;pg=PA227 p. 227]&lt;/ref&gt;
The last three volumes avoid discussion of conflicts within the women's movement during the period they cover.  On the contrary, the narrative has a tone of the inevitability of the movement's victory under the leadership of a few talented leaders.&lt;ref&gt;DuBois (1998), pp. 214-215&lt;/ref&gt;

In her will, Anthony bequeathed the plates for the ''History of Woman Suffrage'' together with the existing inventory to the National American Woman Suffrage Association.&lt;ref&gt;Harper (1898–1908), Vol. 3, [https://archive.org/stream/lifeandworksusa02harpgoog#page/n413/mode/2up p. 1463]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1978 [[Mari Jo Buhle]] and [[Paul Buhle]] condensed the most important parts of the massive ''History of Woman Suffrage'' into ''The Concise History of Woman Suffrage'' and published it as a single volume of fewer than 500 pages.

==Limitations==

The ''History of Woman Suffrage'' provides only limited coverage to groups and individuals who competed with Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton for leadership of the women's suffrage movement.  It only partially portrays the role of [[Lucy Stone]], a pioneering women's rights advocate and a leader of the AWSA, a rival to the NWSA led by Stanton and Anthony.  Stanton urged Stone to assist with the history project by writing an account of her own role in the movement, but Stone refused, saying the project should be left to a later generation because none of the leaders of the two rival groups would be able to write an impartial history.  Stone accordingly provided Stanton with only minimal information about her activities and asked Stanton not to write a biographical sketch of her for inclusion in the history.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon (2003), Vol. 3, [https://books.google.com/books?id=U3diaaiUZjQC&amp;pg=PA249 pp. 249-250]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kerr (1992), [https://books.google.com/books?id=bvPpRyMcQzoC&amp;pg=PA196 p. 196]&lt;/ref&gt;
A 107-page chapter on the history of the AWSA was included, however, compiled by Stanton's daughter Harriot Stanton (later, Blatch) in 1882.&lt;ref&gt;Blatch, Challenging Years, pp. 61-63.&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''History of Woman Suffrage'' provides only minimal coverage of the activities of the militant [[National Woman's Party]], founded in 1913 by [[Alice Paul]] and other activists who were formerly members of the NAWSA.&lt;ref&gt;Cullen-DuPont (2000) [https://books.google.com/books?id=oIro7MtiFuYC&amp;pg=PA115 pp. 115, 181]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to historian Ellen Carol DuBois, the ''History of Woman Suffrage'' established for several decades the consensus view of the history of the women's movement, a "frozen account of the past, a history characterized by celebration, inevitability and canonization".&lt;ref&gt;DuBois (1998), p. 215&lt;/ref&gt;
Historian and biographer Lori D. Ginzberg said, "In that story, Stanton alone articulated the demand for woman suffrage, and Anthony led the charge; there was only one major organization (theirs); and the differences of principle that led to the division brooked no debate."&lt;ref name=ginzberg-154/&gt;
Historian Lisa Tetrault said that Stanton and Anthony mapped a single, accessible narrative onto what had in fact been "a sprawling, multifaceted campaign".&lt;ref&gt;Tetrault (2014), [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZYZgAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA143 p. 143]&lt;/ref&gt;
Tetrault said they placed themselves and their allies at the center of the story and minimized or ignored the roles of Stone and others who did not fit into their narrative.&lt;ref&gt;Tetrault (2014), [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZYZgAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA125 pp. 125–140].  Tetrault says she describes the Seneca Falls story as a "myth" not to indicate that it is false but in the technical sense of "a venerated and celebrated story used to give meaning to the world." See Tetrault (2014), [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZYZgAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA5 p. 5]&lt;/ref&gt;
Scholarly research into women's history began to break out of this framework with the publication of Eleanor Flexner's ''Century of Struggle'' in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;DuBois (1998), pp. 216, 234&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance==

In ''Woman Suffrage and Women's Rights'', historian Ellen Carol DuBois said "There is nothing in the annals of American reform quite like ''History of Woman Suffrage'', a prolonged, deliberate effort on the part of activists to ensure their place in the historical record."&lt;ref&gt;DuBois (1998), p. 213&lt;/ref&gt;
''The Encyclopedia of Women's History in America'' described the ''History of Woman Suffrage'' as "the fundamental primary source for the women's suffrage campaign".&lt;ref&gt;Cullen-DuPont (2000) [https://books.google.com/books?id=oIro7MtiFuYC&amp;pg=PA115 p. 115]&lt;/ref&gt;
In ''Elizabeth Cady Stanton: an American Life'', Lori D. Ginzberg similarly described it 
as "the major, if not the definitive, collection of primary source materials on the nineteenth-century movement."&lt;ref name=ginzberg-154&gt;Ginzberg (2009), p. 154&lt;/ref&gt;
Referring to the several volumes of the ''History'', Tetrault said, "More than 125 years after their publication, they remain an indispensable source, having stood for much of that time as the richest repository of published, accessible documentary evidence of nineteenth century suffrage movements."&lt;ref&gt;Tetrault (2014), [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZYZgAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA117 p. 117]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''historical origins of globalization''' are the subject of ongoing debate. Though many scholars situate the origins of [[globalization]] in the [[modern era]], others regard it as a phenomenon with a long history. Some authors have argued that stretching the beginning of globalization far back in time renders the concept wholly inoperative and useless for political analysis.&lt;ref&gt;See Conversi, Daniele (2010) [http://criticalglobalisation.com/Issue3/36_59_LIMITS_CULTURAL_GLOBALISATION_JCGS3.pdf 'The limits of cultural globalisation?'], Journal of Critical Globalisation Studies, 3, pp. 36–59.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archaic globalization==
{{main article|Archaic globalization}}

Perhaps the extreme proponent of a [[Deep history|deep historical]] origin for globalization was [[Andre Gunder Frank]], an economist associated with [[dependency theory]]. Frank argued that a form of globalization has been in existence since the rise of trade links between [[Sumer]] and the [[Indus Valley Civilization]] in the [[third millennium]] BC&lt;ref&gt;Andre Gunder Frank, "Reorient: Global economy in the Asian age" U.C. Berkeley Press, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;. Critics of this idea contend that it rests upon an over-broad definition of globalization.

[[Thomas L. Friedman]] divides the history of globalization into three periods: Globalization 1.0 (1492–1800), Globalization 2.0 (1800–2000) and Globalization 3.0 (2000–present). He states that Globalization 1.0 involved the globalization of countries, Globalization 2.0 involved the globalization of companies and Globalization 3.0 involves the globalization of individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas L Friedman, "It's a Flat World, After All", New York Times Magazine; Apr 3, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Even as early as the Prehistoric period, the roots of modern globalization could be found. Territorial expansion by our ancestors to all five continents was a critical component in establishing globalization. The development of agriculture furthered globalization by converting the vast majority of the world's population into a settled lifestyle. However, globalization failed to accelerate due to lack of long distance interaction and technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Globalization: A Very Short Introduction |last1= Steger |first1= Manfred |year= 2009 |work= |publisher=Oxford University Press |accessdate=4 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The contemporary process of globalization likely occurred around the middle of the 19th century as increased capital and labor mobility coupled with decreased transport costs led to a smaller world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:ZFHDv4pYFl8J:www.eclac.org/publicaciones/xml/0/10030/globalization-chap1.pdf+&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESjtYsgA84gWH29izNX6SFQg5uwYya3x0XPJ7wKbykrqYfTTIR2e3RX6X8i0mWAyNDXQktpeMqUyR9tOkc00vPX1v1KMMDhvQ-SiVOK1fudNgl6GZckEqpQza7d8SPKfttP52IHR&amp;sig=AHIEtbSzNBHw5sOtHJ4dsGvbnq6L0q4jFA |title=Globalization and Development |accessdate=4 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Archaic globalization.svg|thumb|right|The 13th century world-system]]
An early form of globalized economics and culture, known as [[archaic globalization]], existed during the [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic Age]], when commercialized urban centers were focused around the axis of Greek culture over a wide range that stretched from India to Spain, with such cities as [[Alexandria]], [[Athens]], and [[Antioch]] at its center. Trade was widespread during that period, and it is the first time the idea of a cosmopolitan culture (from Greek "Cosmopolis", meaning "world city") emerged. Others have perceived an early form of globalization in the trade links between the [[Roman Empire]], the [[Parthian Empire]], and the [[Han Dynasty]]. The increasing articulation of commercial links between these powers inspired the development of the [[Silk Road]], which started in western China, reached the boundaries of the Parthian empire, and continued onwards towards Rome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Silkroad Foundation, Adela C.Y. Lee |url=http://www.silk-road.com/artl/srtravelmain.shtml |title=Ancient Silk Road Travellers |publisher=Silk-road.com |date= |accessdate=2010-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Islamic Golden Age]] was also an important early stage of globalization, when [[Radhanite|Jewish]] and [[Islamic economics in the world|Muslim traders]] and [[Geography in medieval Islam|explorers]] established a sustained economy across the [[Old World]] resulting in a [[Muslim Agricultural Revolution|globalization of crops]], trade, knowledge and technology. Globally significant crops such as [[sugar]] and [[cotton]] became widely cultivated across the [[Muslim world]] in this period, while the necessity of learning [[Arabic]] and completing the [[Hajj]] created a cosmopolitan culture.&lt;ref name=Hobson-29-30&gt;John M. Hobson (2004), ''[[The Eastern Origins of Western Civilisation]]'', pp. 29–30, Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|0-521-54724-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The advent of the [[Mongol Empire]], though destabilizing to the commercial centers of the Middle East and China, greatly facilitated travel along the Silk Road. This permitted travelers and missionaries such as [[Marco Polo]] to journey successfully (and profitably) from one end of [[Eurasia]] to the other. The [[Pax Mongolica]] of the thirteenth century had several other notable globalizing effects. It witnessed the creation of the first international [[postal service]], as well as the rapid transmission of [[infectious diseases|epidemic disease]]s such as [[bubonic plague]] across the newly unified regions of [[Central Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;Jack Weatherford, ''Genghis Khan and the Making of the Modern World'', Crown, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; These pre-modern phases of global or hemispheric exchange are sometimes known as [[archaic globalization]]. Up to the sixteenth century, however, even the largest systems of international exchange were limited to the [[Old World]].

==Proto-globalization==
{{main article|Proto-globalization}}

The next phase is known as [[proto-globalization]]. It was characterized by the rise of maritime European empires, in the 16th and 17th centuries, first the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] and [[Spanish Empire]]s, and later the [[Dutch Empire|Dutch]] and [[British Empire]]s. In the 17th century, globalization became also a private business phenomenon when [[chartered companies]] like [[British East India Company]] (founded in 1600), often described as the first [[multinational corporation]], as well as the [[Dutch East India Company]] (founded in 1602) were established.

The [[Age of Discovery]] brought a broad change in globalization, being the first period in which Eurasia and Africa engaged in substantial cultural, material and biologic exchange with the [[New World]]. It began in the late 15th century, when the two Kingdoms of the [[Iberian Peninsula]] – [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]] and [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]] – sent the first exploratory voyages around the [[Cape of Good Hope]] and to the [[Americas]], "discovered" in 1492 by [[Christopher Columbus]]. Shortly before the turn of the 16th century, Portuguese started establishing [[factory (trading post)|trading posts (factories)]] from Africa to Asia and Brazil, to deal with the trade of local products like [[slaves]], [[gold]], [[spices]] and [[timber]], introducing an international business center under a royal monopoly, the [[Casa da Índia|House of India]].&lt;ref&gt;House of India, Encyclopædia Britannica.&lt;/ref&gt;

Global integration continued with the [[European colonization of the Americas]] initiating the [[Columbian Exchange]],&lt;ref&gt;Crosby, Alfred W., "The Columbian exchange: biological and cultural consequences of 1492", Greenwood Publishing Group, {{ISBN|0-275-98073-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; the enormous widespread exchange of plants, animals, foods, human populations (including [[slave labor|slaves]]), [[communicable disease]]s, and culture between the [[Eastern Hemisphere|Eastern]] and [[Western Hemisphere|Western]] hemispheres. It was one of the most significant global events concerning [[ecology]], [[agriculture]], and [[culture]] in  history. [[Columbian Exchange|New crops]] that had come from the Americas via the European seafarers in the 16th century significantly contributed to the world's population growth.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.learnnc.org/lp/editions/nchist-twoworlds/1866 The Columbian Exchange]".

The 19th century witnessed the advent of globalization approaching its modern form. [[Industrialization]] allowed cheap production of household items using [[economies of scale]],{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} while rapid population growth created sustained demand for commodities. Globalization in this period was decisively shaped by nineteenth-century [[imperialism]]. After the [[First Opium War|First]] and [[Second Opium War]]s, which opened up China to foreign trade, and the completion of the British conquest of India, the vast populations of these regions became ready consumers of European exports. It was in this period that areas of sub-Saharan Africa and the Pacific islands were incorporated into the world system. Meanwhile, the conquest of new parts of the globe, notably sub-Saharan Africa, by Europeans yielded valuable natural resources such as [[rubber]], [[diamonds]] and [[coal]] and helped fuel trade and investment between the European imperial powers, their colonies, and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/commandingheights/shared/minitext/tr_show01.html |title=PBS.org |publisher=PBS.org |date=1929-10-24 |accessdate=2010-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{c quote| The inhabitant of London could order by telephone, sipping his morning tea, the various products of the whole earth, and reasonably expect their early delivery upon his doorstep. Militarism and imperialism of racial and cultural rivalries were little more than the amusements of his daily newspaper. What an extraordinary episode in the economic progress of man was that age which came to an end in August 1914.}}

Between the globalization in the 19 th and in the 20th there are significant differences. There are two main points on which the differences can be seen. One point is the global trade in this centuries as well as the capital, investment and the economy.

;Global Trade

The global trade in the 20th century shows a higher share of trade in merchant production, a growth of the trade in services and the rise of production and trade by multinational firms.
The production of merchant goods in the 20th century largely decreased from the levels seen in the 19th century. However, the amount of merchant goods that were produced for the merchandise trade grew. 
The trade in services also grew more important in the 20th compared to the 19th century. 
The last point that distinguishes the global trade in the 19th century compared to the global trade in the 20th century, is the extent of multinational cooperation. In the 20th century you can see a "quantum leap" in multinational cooperation compared to the 19th century. Before the 20th century began, there were just [[Portfolio investment]], but no trade-related or production-relation [[Direct investment]].

Commercial integration has improved since last century, barriers that inhibit trade are lower and transport costs have decreased. Multinational trade contracts and agreements have been signed, like the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] (GATT), [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA), the [[European Union]] (EU) has been hugely involved in eliminating tariffs between member states, and the [[World Trade Organization]].  From 1890 and up to World War I instability in trade was a problem, but in the post war period there has mostly been economic expansion which leads to stability.  Nations have to take care of their own products; they have to make sure that foreign goods do not suffocate their domestic products causing unemployment and maybe social instability. Technological changes have caused lower transporting costs; it takes just a few hours to transport goods between continents to-day, instead of weeks or even months in the nineteenth century.

By consideration financial crisis one key difference is the monetary regime. In the 19th century it occurred under the fixed exchange rates of the gold standard. But in the 20th century it took place in a regime of managed flexibility. Furthermore, in the 19th century countries had developed effective lenders of last resort, but the same was not true at the periphery and countries there suffered the consequences. A century later there was a domestic safety net in most emerging countries so that banking panics were changed into situations where the debts of an insolvent banking system were taken over by the government. The recovery from banking crisis is another key difference. It has tended to begin earlier in the recent period than in the typical crisis episode a hundred years ago. In the 19th century there were no international rescue packages available to emerging economies. But in the recent period such rescues were a typical component of the financial landscape all over the world.

The flows information were an important downside in 19th century. Prior to the [[Transatlantic telegraph cable|Transatlantic cable]] and the [[Radiotelephone]], it used to take very long for information to go from one place to another. So this means that it was very difficult to analyze the information. For instance, it was not so easy to distinguish good and bad credits. Therefore, the information asymmetry played a very important role in international investments. The railway bonds serve as a great example.
There was also many contracting problems. It was very difficult for companies working overseas to manage their operations in other parts of the world, so this was clearly a big barrier to investment. 
Several macroeconomic factors such as exchange risks and uncertain monetary policies were a big barrier for international investments as well.
The accounting standards in the U.S. were relatively underdeveloped in the 19th century. The British investors played a very important role in transferring their accounting practices to the new emerging markets.&lt;ref&gt;Michael D. Bordo, Barry Eichengreen, Douglas A. Irwin. Is Globalization Today Really Different than Globalization a Hundred Years Ago?. NBER Working Paper No. 7195. June 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath of World War I: collapse of globalization==
The first phase of "modern globalization" began to break down at the beginning of the 20th century, with [[World War I]].  The European-dominated network were increasingly confronted with images and stories of ‘others’, thus, then took it upon themselves to take the role of world’s guardians of universal law and morality.  Racist and unequal practices became also part of their practices in search of materials and resources that from other regions of the world.  The increase of world trade before beginning in 1850 right before World War I broke out in 1914 were incentives for bases of direct colonial rule in the global South.  Since other European currencies were becoming quite largely circulated, the need to own resource bases became imperative.&lt;ref&gt;Steger, Manfred. ''Globalization: A Very Short Introduction''. United States: Oxford University Press Inc.,New York, 2009. 28–37.&lt;/ref&gt; The novelist [[VM Yeates]] criticised the financial forces of globalization as a factor in creating World War I.&lt;ref&gt;VM Yeates. ''Winged Victory''. Jonathan Cape. London. 1962 pp. 54–55&lt;/ref&gt;  Financial forces as a factor for creating World War 1 seem to be partly responsible.  An example of this would be France’s colonial rule over most of Africa during the 20th century.  Before World War I broke out, there was no specific aims for the wars in Africa from the French, which left Africans in a “lost” state.  Military potential of Africa was first to be emphasized unlike its economic potential…at least at first.  France’s interest in the military potential of French Africa took a while to be accepted.  Africans in the French army were treated with feelings of inferiority from the French.  As for the economic incentive for colonial rule came in 1917 when France’s was faced with a crisis of food supply.  This coming after the outbreak of the war which had left France without the ability to support itself agriculturally since France had a shortage of fertilizers and machinery in 1917.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew, C.M., and A.S. Kanya-Forster. "France, Africa, and the First World War." ''[[Journal of African History]]''. 19.1 (1978): 11–23. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-World War II: globalization resurgent==
Globalization, since World War II, is partly the result of planning by politicians to break down borders hampering trade. Their work led to the [[Bretton Woods conference]], an agreement by the world's leading politicians to lay down the framework for international commerce and finance, and the founding of several international institutions intended to oversee the processes of globalization.  Globalization was also driven by the global expansion of [[multinational corporations]] based in the United States and Europe, and worldwide exchange of new developments in science, technology and products, with most significant [[invention]]s of this time having their origins in the [[Western world]] according to [[Encyclopædia Britannica]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://corporate.britannica.com/press/inventions.html Encyclopædia Britannica's Great Inventions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070105005042/http://corporate.britannica.com/press/inventions.html |date=2007-01-05 }}", Encyclopædia Britannica&lt;/ref&gt; Worldwide export of [[western culture]] went through the new [[mass media]]: film, radio and television and recorded music. Development and growth of international [[transport]] and [[telecommunication]] played a decisive role in modern globalization.

These institutions include the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (the [[World Bank]]), and the [[International Monetary Fund]]. Globalization has been facilitated by advances in technology which have reduced the costs of trade, and trade negotiation rounds, originally under the auspices of the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] (GATT), which led to a series of agreements to remove restrictions on [[free trade]].

Since World War II, barriers to international trade have been considerably lowered through international agreements&amp;nbsp;– GATT. Particular initiatives carried out as a result of GATT and the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO), for which GATT is the foundation, have included:

* Promotion of free trade:
**  Elimination of [[tariff]]s; creation of [[free trade zone]]s with small or no tariffs
** Reduced transportation costs, especially resulting from development of [[containerization]] for ocean shipping.
** Reduction or elimination of [[capital controls]]
** Reduction, elimination, or harmonization of [[subsidy|subsidies]] for local businesses
** Creation of subsidies for global corporations
** Harmonization of [[intellectual property]] laws across the majority of states, with more restrictions
** Supranational recognition of intellectual property restrictions (e.g. [[patent]]s granted by China would be recognized in the United States)
Cultural globalization, driven by communication technology and the worldwide marketing of Western cultural industries, was understood at first as a process of homogenization, as the global domination of American culture at the expense of traditional diversity. However, a contrasting trend soon became evident in the emergence of movements protesting against globalization and giving new momentum to the defense of local uniqueness, individuality, and identity.&lt;ref&gt;Jurgen Osterhammel and Niels P. Petersson. ''Globalization: a short history''. (2005) p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Uruguay Round]] (1986 to 1994)&lt;ref&gt;WTO.org,(2009)&lt;/ref&gt; led to a treaty to create the WTO to mediate trade disputes and set up a uniform platform of trading. Other bilateral and multilateral trade agreements, including sections of Europe's [[Maastricht Treaty]] and the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA) have also been signed in pursuit of the goal of reducing tariffs and barriers to trade.

World exports rose from 8.5% in 1970, to 16.2% of total gross world product in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.globalpolicy.org/socecon/trade/tables/exports2.htm | title = World Exports as Percentage of Gross World Product | publisher = [[Global Policy Forum]] | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080712023541/http://www.globalpolicy.org/socecon/trade/tables/exports2.htm | archivedate = 12 July 2008 | accessdate = 11 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/s&gt;

In the 1990s, the growth of low cost communication networks allowed work done using a computer to be moved to low wage locations for many job types.  This included accounting, software development, and engineering design.

In late 2000s, much of the [[industrialization|industrialized]] world entered into a deep [[Late 2000s recession|recession]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url = https://www.forbes.com/2009/01/14/global-recession-2009-oped-cx_nr_0115roubini.html | title = A Global Breakdown Of The Recession In 2009 | author = [[Nouriel Roubini]] | date = January 15, 2009 | work=Forbes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some analysts say the world is going through a period of [[deglobalization]] after years of increasing economic integration.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/03/04/AR2009030404221.html A Global Retreat As Economies Dry Up].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11526">As prescribed in the Constitution of [[Tokelau]], individual human rights are those found in the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] and reflected in the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://tokelau.org.nz/About+Us/Government/Self+Determination+Package/Constitution+of+Tokelau.html Section 16(1) of the Constitution of Tokelau, 2007.]&lt;/ref&gt; When exercising these rights, there must be proper recognition of the rights of others and to the community as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tokelau.org.nz/About+Us/Government/Self+Determination+Package/Constitution+of+Tokelau.html Section 16(2) of the Constitution of Tokelau, 2007.]&lt;/ref&gt; If an individual believes their rights have been breached they may go to the Council for the Ongoing Government who may make any appropriate order to protect that individual’s rights.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tokelau.org.nz/About+Us/Government/Self+Determination+Package/Constitution+of+Tokelau.html Sections 3-6 of the Constitution of Tokelau, 2007.]&lt;/ref&gt; There have been no such complaints to date.

==International treaties==

Tokelau currently recognises itself as a part of New Zealand under the Tokelau Act 1948.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1948/0024/1.0/DLM247577.html Section 3 of the Tokelau Act 1948]&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, Tokelau has a limited international legal personality. In regards to international treaties, ratification is done by the New Zealand Government who extends their authority to include Tokelau by an express statement once the Government of Tokelau has been consulted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mfat.govt.nz/downloads/treaties-and-international-law/International-Treaty-Making-Guide-2012.pdf International Treaty Making Guide]&lt;/ref&gt; If Tokelau were to become a state in free association with New Zealand, then they would have the capacity to ratify treaties under their own name.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.upf.pf/IMG/pdf/13-RJP15-The-Constitution-of-Tokelau.pdf A. H. Angelo- The Constitution of Tokelau]&lt;/ref&gt; There have been two referenda attempts in Tokelau to move to self-government. These occurred in [[Tokelauan self-determination referendum, 2006|2006]] and in [[Tokelauan self-determination referendum, 2007|2007]], however there was not enough required support for Tokelau to change its status.

Treaties that apply to Tokelau include the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] (ICCPR), its two optional protocols, the [[Convention on the Elimination of all forms of Discrimination Against Women]] (CEDAW), the [[United Nations Convention Against Torture]], the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] (ICESCR) and the [[International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination]] (ICERD).

An example of a treaty that New Zealand has ratified but does not apply to Tokelau is the [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]] (CRC).

Tokelau also participates in some regional organisations with New Zealand's support. These include the [[Secretariat of the Pacific Community]], the [[Pacific Islands Forum Fisheries Agency]], the [[Pacific Regional Environment Programme]], the Council of the University of the South Pacific and the [[UNESCO|UN Educational and Scientific Organisation]].

==Overview of Tokelauan human rights==

Human rights were not mentioned in Tokelauan legislation until the Human Rights Rules 2004. These rules were very basic and are now what is incorporated in the Constitution of Tokelau 2007. Tokelau accepts the principles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

==The right to education==
{{main|Education in Tokelau}}
The right to an education is found in Article 26 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and Article 13 of ICESCR. The Constitution of Tokelau gives no indication to the meaning of each individual right, therefore ICESCR can be used to define what the right to education actually means.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} ICESCR goes into some detail of what the right to education entails. It states all primary education should be free and compulsory. Secondary education should be generally available and accessible to all, as should any higher education. It then goes on to say there needs to be development in school systems that are free from discrimination, with set minimum standards and a high level of quality.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CESCR.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt;

Tokelau conforms with its human rights obligations in that up to the age of 16 years, education is free, and under s63 of the Crimes, Procedure and Evidence Rules 2003, school is compulsory until the age of 16. There are three schools across the three atolls, all of whom teach from early childhood up to year 11. Year 12 and 13 students are offered foundation and transition courses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0019/001931/193192e.pdf Education in Tokelau.]&lt;/ref&gt; There is no university in Tokelau, so if students wish to progress to further education, they need to either study via correspondence or relocate to another country such as Samoa.

New Zealand conducted an educational review of Tokelau in February 2014, and found "the overall quality of teaching does not enable all Tokelauan students to achieve the education standards outlined in the Tokelau National Curriculum Policy Framework".&lt;ref&gt;[http://tokelau.org.nz/site/tokelau/ERO%20National%20Evaluation%20of%20Education%20%20Provision%20in%20Tokelau%20-%20Confirmed%20February%202014.pdf National Evaluation of Education Provision in Tokelau Conducted by the NZ Government at page 11.]&lt;/ref&gt; The same report went on to find that none of the schools were well resourced in facilities and teaching materials.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tokelau.org.nz/site/tokelau/ERO%20National%20Evaluation%20of%20Education%20%20Provision%20in%20Tokelau%20-%20Confirmed%20February%202014.pdf Evaluation of Education Provision in Tokelau Conducted by the NZ Government at page 15.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Annex to the National Report of the Universal Periodic Review, it was acknowledged in the section on Tokelau that it is highly challenging to recruit and retain qualified and skilled teachers in the education sector in Tokelau. This is because Tokelau is so isolated from other countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mfat.govt.nz/downloads/humanrights/Annex%20to%20New%20Zealand%20UPR%20national%20report%20-%20Tokelau.pdf Annex of the National Report: Tokelau.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The right to an adequate standard of living==

The [[right to an adequate standard of living]] under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights is there for the health and well being of individuals and their families. This includes having access to medical care, food, clothing and housing.

===The right to healthcare===

{{main|Healthcare in Tokelau}}
There are three hospitals in Tokelau, one is located on each of the three atolls. They are the primary healthcare facilities for Tokelauan residents. Each hospital has 12 beds, none of which have the capacity for intensive care patients. In the case of serious injuries patients have to be evacuated to Samoa and in some cases to New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wpro.who.int/hrh/documents/publications/wpr_hrh_county_profiles_tokelau_upload.pdf World Health Organization: Tokelau Health Profile.]&lt;/ref&gt;
  
Tokelau ensures they are adhering to Article 25 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in regards to access to healthcare by making all dental and medical services free to the citizens of Tokelau. This includes the prescription of essential medicines. Where a person is required to go to Samoa for healthcare the Tokelauan Government provides a subsidy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wpro.who.int/hrh/documents/publications/wpr_hrh_county_profiles_tokelau_upload.pdf World Health Organisation: Tokelau Health Profile at page 5.]&lt;/ref&gt;

New Zealand’s National Report for the Universal Periodic Review provides a section on Tokelau which states that statistical information in regards to the health levels of Tokelauan’s is unavailable making it difficult to understand the status of health issues such as obesity and disease rates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mfat.govt.nz/downloads/humanrights/Annex%20to%20New%20Zealand%20UPR%20national%20report%20-%20Tokelau.pdf UPR New Zealand: Tokelau.]&lt;/ref&gt; The report also outlined Tokelau’s biggest challenge in providing health care is attracting medically trained staff to come and work in Tokelau. This challenge was largely attributed to being so isolated from other countries. The World Health Organisation has recognised that the flow on effects from having recruitment issues has led to health workers having to run the hospital and become accountable for a vast amount of high level duties.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wpro.who.int/hrh/documents/publications/wpr_hrh_county_profiles_tokelau_upload.pdf World Health Organisation: Tokelau Health Profile at page 11.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===The right to water and sanitation===

The right to water is recognised under ICESCR which is recognised in the Constitution of Tokelau and also CEDAW, to which Tokelau is a party.

Tokelau has very scarce water resources and because there are no fresh water surfaces on any of the atolls, it is solely dependent on rainwater as its source of fresh water. In recent years, climate change has resulted in much lower rain levels with drought periods lasting for much longer. This has made Tokelau along with many other islands in the Pacific struggle to conserve and store water for individual use.&lt;ref&gt;[http://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/PACCTechRep15.pdf Improving rainwater harvesting infrastructure in Tokelau at page 1.]&lt;/ref&gt; In the past, countries such as New Zealand and the United States have had to send emergency water supplies to Tokelau because it was on the verge of running out entirely.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newzealand.usembassy.gov/tokelau_water_shortage.html Tokelau Water Shortage.]&lt;/ref&gt; Sanitation facilities are also said to be poorly designed and wasting precious supplies of fresh water through the flushing system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/PACCTechRep15.pdf Improving rainwater harvesting infrastructure in Tokelau at page 6.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to Tokelau being a New Zealand territory and not an independent, it was unable to take advantage of the Pacific Adaption to Climate Change (PACC) programme when it was introduced in 2009. In 2011 that Australian Government supplied additional funding allowing for what was known as the PACC+ programme that Tokelau was allowed to be a part of. Since 2011, the Tokelau PACC+ project has been progressively working towards more sustainable solutions in regards to [[rainwater harvesting]] and storage to ensure that everyone in Tokelau can continue to have access to what is consider a basic right.

==The right to a fair trial==
The Crimes, Procedure and Evidence Rules (CPER) 2003 sets out Tokelau's criminal code. Part II of the CPER and onwards sets out numerous sections all in relation to trial circumstances and processes for both criminal and civil trials. According to the Annex of the National Report, the rules set out are all consistent with and set out to satisfy Tokelau's fair trial obligations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mfat.govt.nz/downloads/humanrights/Annex%20to%20New%20Zealand%20UPR%20national%20report%20-%20Tokelau.pdf Annex to the National Report: Tokelau at para 25.]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2525">'''Income-Contingent Repayment''' is an arrangement for the repayment of a loan where the regular (e.g., monthly) amount to be paid by the borrower depends on his or her income. This type of repayment arrangement is mostly used for student loans where the ability of the new graduate borrower to repay is usually limited by his or her income.

== United Kingdom ==
Income-Contingent Repayment is available for [[Student loans in the United Kingdom]] since 1998. The Student Loans Company (SLC) that manages student loans for students living in the UK makes sure that the repayment of loans only begins after the student has left higher education and is earning over a certain threshold of:

* £18,330 for Plan 1 loans: (Scotland and Northern Ireland) &amp; (England and Wales for loans take  before 1 September 2012)
* £25,000 for Plan 2 loans: (England and Wales for loans taken after 1 September 2012)

These loans are collected via the PAYE tax system by employers deducting from the salary from their employees and pass the money onto HMRC along with other contributions (Income Tax and National Insurance. HMRC Then provides the full financial year's worth of deductions to student loans company beginning from May after the finance year and may provide updates until December. Customers receive their statements 30 days after their accounts are updated.  &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dlc.co.uk/services/higher-education.aspx Higher Education]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Retrieved on November 28, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The loans are also repaid through Tax Returns by Self Assessment, which is paid in the January after the Financial year is ended and given to SLC in April. Customers who reside or work overseas are required to directly contact SLC to arrange repayment of their loans directly to Student Loans with another means of income assessment.
This is different from the previous "mortgage style" loans (These have now been sold from SLC to other loan companies that include Erudio Student Loans, Theisis Servicing and Honours Student Loans) that set a fixed monthly payment irrespective of the graduate's income.

== United States ==
There are a number of [[loan]] repayment options available to [[U.S. federal student loan]] borrowers, including some that are based on the borrower’s [[income]].&lt;ref&gt;https://studentaid.ed.gov/repay-loans/understand/plans&lt;/ref&gt;

See [[Income-Based Repayment]] for detailed information.

'''International STAND UP to Bullying Day''' is a special semi-annual event in which participants sign and wear a pink “pledge shirt” to take a visible, public stance against [[bullying]]. The event takes place in schools, workplaces, and organizations in 25 countries around the globe on the third Friday of November to coincide with [[Anti-bullying week]], and then again on the last Friday of February.

== History ==
The first ''International STAND UP to Bullying Day'' took place in February 2008. 236 schools, workplaces and organizations representing more than 125,000 students and staff registered to take a STAND against [[Bullying]] by signing and wearing a special pink pledge shirt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.standupday.com |title=International STAND UP to Bullying Day |publisher=www.standupday.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724074417/http://www.standupday.com/ |archivedate=2008-07-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Host ==
Each participating school, workplace or organization hosts their own STAND with aid being provided by event coordinators. Bully Help Initiatives], a [[Canada|Canadian]] based organization committed to developing effective support structures for victims of bullying through a variety of initiatives.

== Pink Shirts ==
Participation in the STAND constitutes the signing and wearing of a special pink ''pledge shirt''. Signing and wearing this shirt identifies a peer based support structure to victims and their bullies in a non-confrontational way. The color of the shirts is based on a campaign started by Travis Price and David Shepherd, two students who took a stand for a fellow student who was bullied for wearing a pink shirt to school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/nova-scotia/story/2007/09/18/pink-tshirts-students.html |title=Bullied student tickled pink by schoolmates T-shirt campaign |publisher=www.cbc.ca |date=September 19, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081219151350/http://www.cbc.ca/canada/nova-scotia/story/2007/09/18/pink-tshirts-students.html |archivedate=December 19, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jeromy Farkas''' is a [[Canadians|Canadian]] politician, who was elected to [[Calgary City Council]] in the [[Calgary municipal election, 2017|2017 municipal election]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://globalnews.ca/news/3840000/new-calgary-councillor-jeromy-farkas-turns-down-some-perks-of-the-job/ "New Calgary Councillor Jeromy Farkas turns down some perks of the job"]. [[Global News]], November 2, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; He represents Ward 11 on council, comprising the neighbourhoods of [[Acadia, Calgary|Acadia]], [[Bayview, Calgary|Bayview]], [[Bel-Aire, Calgary|Bel-Aire]], [[Braeside, Calgary|Braeside]], [[Britannia, Calgary|Britannia]], [[Cedarbrae, Calgary|Cedarbrae]], [[CFB Currie, Calgary|CFB Currie]], [[CFB Lincoln Park PMQ, Calgary|CFB Lincoln Park PMQ]], [[Chinook Park, Calgary|Chinook Park]], [[Eagle Ridge, Calgary|Eagle Ridge]], [[Elbow Park, Calgary|Elbow Park]] (part), [[Elboya, Calgary|Elboya]],  [[Haysboro, Calgary|Haysboro]], [[Kelvin Grove, Calgary|Kelvin Grove]], [[Kingsland, Calgary|Kingsland]], [[Lakeview, Calgary|Lakeview]], [[Lincoln Park, Calgary|Lincoln Park,]] [[Mayfair, Calgary|Mayfair]], [[Meadowlark Park, Calgary|Meadowlark Park]], [[Mission, Calgary|Mission,]] [[North Glenmore Park, Calgary|North Glenmore Park,]] [[Oakridge, Calgary|Oakridge]], [[Palliser, Calgary|Palliser,]] [[Parkhill/Stanley Park, Calgary|Parkhill/Stanley Park]], [[Pump Hill, Calgary|Pump Hill]], [[Roxboro, Calgary|Rideau Park]], [[Roxboro, Calgary|Roxboro]], [[Rutland Park, Calgary|Rutland Park]], [[Southwood, Calgary|Southwood]], [[Willow Park, Calgary|Willow Park]] and [[Windsor Park, Calgary|Windsor Park]].

== Education ==
Farkas graduated from Calgary's [[Bishop Carroll High School (Calgary, Alberta)|Bishop Carroll High School]] and attended classes at the [[University of Calgary]] and received his bachelor of arts in political science and government.

== Manning Foundation ==
Prior to declaring his candidacy for Ward 11, Farkas worked as a senior fellow specializing in municipal governance at the [[Preston Manning|Manning Foundation]] for Democratic Education from February 2013 to January 2016. He was the project lead for the Council Tracker project, and published a report in September 2013 called "Growing the Democratic Toolbox: City Council Vote Tracking" where he studied City of Calgary Council meetings from fall 2010 to April 2013, specifically examining 73 votes during that period to understand how council worked, look at voting blocs, time spent in-camera (deliberations that are not open to the public), among other issues.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.metronews.ca/news/calgary/2014/05/28/see-how-calgary-councillors-vote-on-new-tracking-website-from-manning-foundation.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.scribd.com/document/169683010/Manning-Centre-Report-on-Calgary-City-Council&lt;/ref&gt; He continued the project and established the website Counciltracker.com to track Calgary council activities, which he maintained until he left the Manning Foundation to run for Ward 11.

Farkas is a former ''[[Calgary Herald]]'' columnist writing about local issues, particularly city council, and contributed to ''Canadian Cycling'' magazine from 2015 to 2016.

== Provincial and federal politics ==
Formerly president of the [[Wildrose Party]]'s [[constituency association]] in [[Calgary-Elbow]],&lt;ref name="lgbt"&gt;[http://calgaryherald.com/news/politics/local-wildrose-official-wants-party-to-become-champion-of-lgbtq-issues "Local Wildrose official wants party to become champion of LGBTQ issues"]. ''[[Calgary Herald]]'', June 3, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Farkas identifies himself as a fiscal conservative and social liberal.&lt;ref name="journal"&gt;[https://www.calgaryjournal.ca/index.php/city-hall/3461-jeromy-farkas-weighs-in-on-why-he-left-the-wildrose-constituency-to-run-for-calgary-city-council "Jeromy Farkas weighs in on why he left the Wildrose constituency to run for Calgary city council"]. ''Calgary Journal'', December 10, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; He describes his political views as being motivated by an attitude that "you should have the biggest say in how you live your life... chasing, again, the best solutions rather than the ones based in ideology," and has been active in issues such as wildlife conservation and human rights activism.&lt;ref name="journal" /&gt; He is out as [[bisexual]], becoming Calgary's first openly [[LGBTQ]] male city councillor,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metronews.ca/news/calgary/2017/10/18/the-power-and-pitfalls-of-a-diverse-council.html "The power and pitfalls of a diverse council"]. ''[[Metro International|Metro]]'', October 18, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; and played a key role in pushing the Wildrose Party to adopt a more progressive position on LGBTQ issues.&lt;ref name="lgbt" /&gt;

== Calgary city council ==
His first significant act as a city councillor was to refuse several perks of the office, including councillors' [[pension]] plan and the transition allowance for new councillors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/jeromy-farkas-pension-declined-council-1.4384388 "Newly elected Calgary councillor turns down pension, transition allowance"]. [[CBC News]], November 2, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; He also vowed to oppose the city's new southwest [[List of Calgary Transit bus routes#BRT|bus rapid transit]] line.&lt;ref&gt;[http://calgaryherald.com/news/local-news/ward-11-southwest-brt-divides-candidates "Ward 11: Jeromy Farkas vows to stop BRT in its tracks"]. ''[[Calgary Herald]]'', October 17, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2017, his proposal for the city to provide additional compensation to residents of the Midfield [[trailer park]], which is being closed due to poor site design that makes it impossible for the city to repair the neighbourhood's failing water and sewer lines without tearing down the homes, failed to advance after Farkas was unable to find a councillor willing to [[second (parliamentary procedure)|second]] the motion.&lt;ref&gt;[https://calgary.ctvnews.ca/councillor-s-plans-for-midfield-mobile-home-park-falls-flat-1.3725839 "Councillor's plans for Midfield Mobile Home Park falls flat"]. [[CTV Calgary]], December 18, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2018, he faced some criticism for being the sole councillor to vote against a motion directing city staff to draft a new [[parental leave]] policy for city councillors, on the grounds that taking time away from city council business would be a betrayal of the constituents.&lt;ref&gt;[https://globalnews.ca/news/4048956/calgary-councillor-criticized-parental-leave-policy/ "Calgary councillor criticized for suggesting parental leave would be ‘betrayal’ of constituents"]. [[Global Calgary]], February 26, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7203">A '''Jihad satire''' is a [[political satire]] that satirizes the idea of violent [[jihad]].

==As art==

The musical comedy ''[[Jihad! The Musical]]'' and the film ''[[Four Lions]]'' are works of art that satirise jihadis.&lt;ref name="Gardham"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/terrorism-in-the-uk/7594722/We-should-laugh-at-al-Qaeda-says-report.html|title=We should laugh at al-Qaeda, says report|last=Gardham|first=Duncan|date=April 16, 2010|publisher=The Daily Telegraph|accessdate=21 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/wannabe-suicide-bombers-beware-chris-morris-movie-gets-goahead-1228152.html |title=Wannabe suicide bombers beware: Chris Morris movie gets go-ahead |first=Geneviève |last=Roberts |date=6 January 2009 |accessdate=20 May 2009 | work=The Independent | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WSJstaff&gt;[https://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2010/03/17/trailer-for-jihad-satire-four-lions-debuts/  "'Four Lions' Jihad Satire Trailer Debuts,"] March 17, 2010, Wall Street Journal.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IHTrib&gt;[http://tribune.com.pk/story/7266/counter-terrorism-comedy/ "Counter-terrorism comedy,"] International Herald Tribune.&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[The Australian]]'' describes ''Four Lions'' as "a satire on Islamic jihadism and its murderous ambitions."&lt;ref name=Williams&gt;[http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/arts/jokes-on-jihad/story-e6frg8n6-1225906260351 "Jokes on jihad,"] Evan Williams, August 21, 2010, The Australian.&lt;/ref&gt;   The satirical ''Jihad! The Musical'' featured a hero who cheerfully sang, "I wanna be like Osama, I wanna bomb a path to fame across the Earth.  People may abhor me but by God, they won't ignore me, When the CIA determines what I'm worth."&lt;ref name=Gifford&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=13923077 "Fringe Fest 'Jihad' Musical Touches Explosive Topics,"] Rob Gifford, Aug, 24, 2007, National Public Radio.&lt;/ref&gt;

Comedian [[Jeff Dunham]]'s puppet character "Achmed the dead [[Islamic terrorism|terrorist]]" is a popular example of jihad satire in the United States.&lt;ref name=Time&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1901490,00.html Belinda Luscombe. "The Puppet Master" ''[[Time magazine|Time]]'' magazine; June 8, 2009].&lt;/ref&gt;  Achmed is a puppet who shouts, "Silence, I kill you!" whenever the audience laughs at something that offends his sensibilities.&lt;ref name=Purcell&gt;Achmed the dead terrorist and humor in popular geopolitics, Darren Purcell, Melissa Scott Brown and Mahmut Gokmen, GeoJournal, 31 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  Dunham explains that he portrays Achmed as incompetent so that when the audience realise that the character is "a bumbling idiot with problems in life", they appreciate that he is human.&lt;ref name=Purcell/&gt;

==As healing==

Mental health professionals argue that humor and satire can alleviate the mental health impact of terror attacks, helping to heal the survivors of terror attacks and rescue personnel suffering the consequences of exposure to the horrors of deliberate mass murder.&lt;ref name=Purcell/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Elaine Anne Pasquali, "Humor; An Antidote for Terrorism", ''[[Journal of Holistic Nursing]]'', Vol. 21, No. 4, 398-414 (2003).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Michael Bongar, ''Psychology of Terrorism'', Oxford University Press, 2007, p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Mental health's role in combating terror,’" Derrick Hamaoka, Jun Shigemura, Molly Hall, Robert Ursano, ''Journal of Mental Health,'' 2004, Vol. 13, No. 6 : Pages 531-535.&lt;/ref&gt;

==As political strategy==

Arab-American comedian [[Ray Hanania]] has written, "If there were a bit of humor in the Middle East, I think that there might not be so much fanaticism. Humor can be a counter to the environment that breeds fanaticism and terrorism."&lt;ref name=Hanania&gt;Ray Hanania, ''I'm Glad I Look Like a Terrorist: Growing up Arab in America,'' U. S. G. Publishing, 1996, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''[[Psychology Today]]'',  humor is the most powerful tool to prevent individuals from becoming  Islamic suicide bombers, however, to be effective, the humor has to come from within the Muslim community and it has to be "aimed at the culture's sacred values."&lt;ref name=Fong&gt;[http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-me-in-we/201001/comedy-counter-terrorism  “Comedy as Counter-Terrorism; Comedy as a Strategy of Counter-Terrorism,”] Molly Castelloe Fong, Ph.D. , Jan 26, 2010, Psychology Today.&lt;/ref&gt; According to psychologist Molly Castelloe Fong, "Humor has the potential to gradually, over time, alter what it means to be a heroic martyr in the mind of extremist groups."&lt;ref name=Fong/&gt;

[[Agence France-Presse]] has reported that "Satire and ridicule can help win the fight against Al-Qaeda by stripping it of its glamour and mystique."&lt;ref name=Moutot&gt;[https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jtBqws_tP_7eOFEw0cdih33DNN_A "Fight Al-Qaeda with satire, ridicule: researchers"], Michel Moutot (AFP) – Apr 16, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Holden&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE63E6JT20100415 “Defeat al Qaeda by removing its "cool" image; The way to beat al Qaeda and stop Islamist groups gaining recruits to violent causes is to remove their "cool" image and make fun of terrorists instead, according to a major international study published on Friday,”] Michael Holden, April 15, 2010, Reuters.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Demos (UK think tank)|Demos]] group, a think tank in the United Kingdom, is among the academic institutions that have suggested that satire can be an effective tool in undermining support for  violent jihad.&lt;ref name=Gardham/&gt;  According to some terrorism experts, successful recruitment for violent jihad depends upon convincing potential recruits that jihadis are "pious warriors of God". They postulate that by "highlighting their incompetence, their moral failings, and their embarrassing antics", it may be possible to "undermine" support for violent jihadi organizations including [[Al Qaeda]] and the [[Taliban]].&lt;ref name="Byman"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2010/07/the-case-for-calling-them-nitwits/8130/|title=The Case for Calling Them Nitwits|last=Fair|first=Christine|date=July–August 2010|publisher=The Atlantic |accessdate=20 June 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers for Demos recommend satire as a means of undermining the popularity of violent jihad, noting that "satire has long been recognised as a powerful tool to undermine the popularity of social movements: both the [[Ku Klux Klan]] and the [[British Union of Fascists|British Fascist party]] in the 1930s were seriously harmed by sustained satire."&lt;ref name=Bartlett&gt;[http://www.demos.co.uk/publications/theedgeofviolence  ‘’The Edge of Violence, A Radical Approach to Extremism,’’] Jamie Bartlett, Jonathan Birdwell, April 16, 2010, Demos, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kevin B. MacDonald''' (born January 24, 1944) is an American psychologist. He is a retired professor of psychology at [[California State University, Long Beach]] (CSULB), best known for writings that characterize [[Jewish]] behavior as a "[[group evolutionary strategy]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.daily49er.com/news/2014/04/14/controversial-psychology-professor-to-retire-in-the-fall/#sthash.dobpjT3I.dpbs MacDonald to retire in the fall], daily49er.com, April 14, 2014; accessed August 16, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; His work has received support from [[anti-Semitic]] and [[white supremacist]] groups.&lt;ref name="LATimes"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Marantz |first1=Andrew |title=Birth of a white supremacist |url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/10/16/birth-of-a-white-supremacist |accessdate=8 October 2018 |work=The New Yorker |date=October 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''[[Undark Magazine]]'', MacDonald's work "has been dismissed for decades as anti-Semitic pseudoscience".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://undark.org/article/kevin-macdonald-anti-semitism-psychology/ |title=Kevin MacDonald and the Elevation of Anti-Semitic Pseudoscience |last=Schulson |first=Michael |date=2018-06-27 |website=Undark |language=en-US |access-date=2018-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 the California State University, Long Beach academic senate voted to disassociate itself from MacDonald's work.&lt;ref name="senate"/&gt;

MacDonald claims a suite of traits he attributes to [[Jew]]s, including higher-than-average [[verbal intelligence]] and [[ethnocentricism]], have culturally evolved to enhance their ability to outcompete [[Gentile|non-Jews]] for resources. MacDonald believes Jews are motivated by a hatred and "hostility toward American Christian culture"&lt;ref name="understanding1"/&gt; and have used this purported advantage to advance Jewish group interests and end potential [[antisemitism]] by either deliberately or inadvertently undermining the power of the European-derived Christian majorities in the Western world.&lt;ref name="understanding1"&gt;[http://theoccidentalquarterly.com/archives/vol3no2/km-understanding.html "Understanding Jewish Influence I: Background Traits for Jewish Activism"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080103130608/http://theoccidentalquarterly.com/archives/vol3no2/km-understanding.html |date=2008-01-03 }}, theoccidentalquarterly.com; retrieved 2007-09-04.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="understanding2"&gt;*Kevin MacDonald.

==Early years==
MacDonald was born in [[Oshkosh, Wisconsin]] to a [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=MacDonald|first=Kevin|url=http://www.theoccidentalobserver.net/2012/10/whites-versus-anglo-saxons|title=Whites versus Anglo-Saxons|work=[[Occidental Observer]]|date=October 2, 2012|accessdate=October 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Michael"&gt;[[George Michael (professor)|George Michael]]. [http://www.kevinmacdonald.net/JC&amp;S48-2006.pdf "Professor Kevin MacDonald's critique of Judaism: legitimate scholarship or the intellectualization of anti-semitism?"], ''Journal of Church and State'', September 22, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary inline|date=October 2018}} His father was a policeman and his mother was a secretary. He attended Catholic [[parochial school]]s and played basketball in high school. He entered the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] and became involved in the [[anti-war movement]], which brought him into contact with Jewish student activists.&lt;ref name="Michael"/&gt;

MacDonald became a philosophy major and abandoned the anti-war movement.&lt;ref name="Michael"/&gt; Between 1970 and 1974 he worked towards becoming a jazz pianist, spending two years in Jamaica, where he taught high school.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120115011517/http://www.wermodandwermod.com/newsitems/news110220110000.html Interview with Kevin MacDonald]&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source needed|date=October 2018}} By the late 1970s he had left that career.

==Professional background==
MacDonald is the author of seven books on evolutionary theory and child development and is the author or editor of over 30 academic articles in refereed journals. He received his B.A. from the University of Wisconsin–Madison in 1966, and M.S. in biology from the [[University of Connecticut]] in 1976. In 1981 he earned a PhD in biobehavioral sciences from the University of Connecticut, where his adviser was [[Benson Ginsburg|Benson E. Ginsburg]], a founder and leader of modern behavior genetics. His thesis was on the behavioral development of wolves and resulted in two publications:
* "Induction of normal behavior in wolves with restricted rearing", ''Behavioral and Neural Biology'', 33, pp.&amp;nbsp;133–62 (1981)
* "Development and stability of personality characteristics in prepubertal wolves", ''Journal of Comparative Psychology'', pp.&amp;nbsp;97, 99–106 (1983)

MacDonald completed a post-doctoral fellowship with Ross Parke in the psychology department of the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]] in 1983. MacDonald and Parke's work there resulted in three publications:
* "Bridging the gap: Parent-child play interactions and peer interactive competence", ''Child Development'', 55, 1265–77 (1984)
* "Parent-child physical play: The effects of sex and age of children and parents", ''Sex Roles'', 15, 367–78 (1986)
* "Parent-child physical play with rejected, neglected and popular boys", ''Developmental Psychology'', 23, 705–11 (1987)

MacDonald joined the Department of Psychology at [[California State University, Long Beach]] (CSU-LB) in 1985, and became a full professor in 1995. He announced his retirement at the end of 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Row|first=Joann|title=Controversial psychology professor to retire in the fall|url=http://www.daily49er.com/news/2014/04/14/controversial-psychology-professor-to-retire-in-the-fall|accessdate=April 15, 2014|newspaper=Daily 49er|date=April 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He served as Secretary-Archivist of the [[Human Behavior and Evolution Society]] and was elected as a member of the executive board from 1995 to 2001. He was an editor of ''[[Population and Environment]]'' and is an associate editor of the journal ''Sexuality &amp; Culture''. He serves on the Advisory Board of ''[[The Occidental Quarterly]]'', a journal that has been described by [[Max Blumenthal]] on the website of [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] magazine ''[[The American Prospect]]'' as "the premier voice of the white-nationalist movement".&lt;ref name="blumenthal"&gt;Max Blumenthal.

==Work on ethnicity==
===Judaism and Jewish culture&lt;!--'Group evolutionary strategy' redirects here--&gt;===
[[Image:KMtrilogy.JPG|250px|right|thumb]]
{{main|The Culture of Critique series}}
MacDonald wrote a trilogy of books analyzing Judaism and [[secular Jewish culture]] from the perspective of [[evolutionary psychology]]: ''A People That Shall Dwell Alone'' (1994), ''Separation and Its Discontents'' (1998), and ''The Culture of Critique'' (1998). He proposes that Judaism is a '''group evolutionary strategy'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; to enhance the ability of Jews to outcompete non-Jews for resources. Using the term "Jewish ethnocentrism", he argues that Judaism fosters in Jews a series of marked genetic traits, including above-average verbal intelligence and a strong tendency toward collectivist behavior, as manifested in a series of influential intellectual movements. MacDonald says that not all Jews in all circumstances display the traits he identifies.&lt;ref name="understanding3"/&gt;

MacDonald says that the Jewish community has been the single most important and powerful group in favor of unrestricted immigration to the United States in pursuit of their own perceived collective interests.&lt;ref name="immigration"&gt;MacDonald, Kevin B. (June 19, 2004) [http://www.vdare.com/macdonald/040619_1924_immigration.htm "Was the 1924 Immigration Cut-off 'Racist'?"], [[VDARE]] retrieved 2007-09-04.&lt;/ref&gt;

MacDonald's has claimed that the period preceding the [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965|1965 Immigration Act]], when country-of-origin based quotas existed, mostly favoring immigration from Europe. According to MacDonald, while most of the ethnic communities in that period were somewhat active in trying to effect the increase of immigration quotas from their own countries of origin, only Jewish community activists were requesting (and ultimately obtained in 1965) the dismantling of country-of-origin quotas and an increase in immigration across the board.{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} MacDonald says that Jews opposed immigration quotas because a diverse America was safer for Jews.&lt;ref name="immigration"/&gt;

MacDonald published a series of three articles in ''The Occidental Quarterly'' on the alleged similarities between [[neoconservatism]] and other movements that he claims are Jewish-dominated. He argues that "Taken as a whole, neoconservatism is an excellent illustration of the key traits behind the success of Jewish activism: [[ethnocentrism]], intelligence and wealth, psychological intensity, and aggressiveness."&lt;ref name="understanding3"/&gt; His conclusions are that neoconservatism fits into a general pattern of 20th-century Jewish intellectual and political activism.&lt;ref name="VDARE"&gt;Kevin MacDonald. [http://www.vdare.com/macdonald/030918_neoconservatism.htm "Thinking About Neoconservatism"], VDARE.com, September 18, 2003; retrieved 2007-09-04.&lt;/ref&gt; MacDonald argues that non-Jewish neoconservatives are examples of an ability to recruit prominent non-Jews while preserving a Jewish core and commitment to Jewish interests.&lt;ref name="VDARE"/&gt;

===Other ethnic groups===
MacDonald has also written about other ethnic groups living in diaspora, such as [[Overseas Chinese|overseas Chinese people]] and [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=MacDonald, Kevin |date=2004-07-29 |title=Socialization for Ingroup Identity among Assyrians in the United States |url=http://evolution.anthro.univie.ac.at/ishe/conferences/past%20conferences/ghent.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070610001135/http://evolution.anthro.univie.ac.at/ishe/conferences/past%20conferences/ghent.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2007-06-10 |accessdate=August 15, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
===Academic reception===
{{see also|The Culture of Critique series#Academic response}}
At the time of its release, ''A People That Shall Dwell Alone'' received mixed reviews from scholars, although his subsequent books were less positively received.

[[John Tooby]], the founder of MacDonald's field of evolutionary psychology, criticized MacDonald in an article for ''[[Salon.com|Salon]]'' in 2000. He wrote, "MacDonald's ideas—not just on Jews—violate fundamental principles of the field." Tooby posits that MacDonald is not an evolutionary psychologist, and advocates models incorporating [[group selection|group-selection theory]], a view of natural selection whose importance is disputed.&lt;ref name=SPLC2&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.splcenter.org/get-informed/intelligence-report/browse-all-issues/2007/spring/promoting-hate|title=California State University, Long Beach Psychology Professor Kevin MacDonald Publishes Anti-Semitic Books|last=Beirich|first=Heidi|date=Spring 2007|work=Intelligence Report|publisher=SPLC|number=125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MacDonald has been accused by some academics in ''Policing the National Body: Sex, Race, and Criminalization'' of employing racial "techniques of scapegoating [that] may have evolved in complexity from classical Nazi fascism, but the similarities [to which] are far from remote."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Rajani Bhatia|author2=Jael Miriam Silliman|author3=Anannya Bhattacharjee|title=Policing the National Body: Sex, Race, and Criminalization|url=https://books.google.com/?id=1bs1LyaFzR0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=isbn=0896086607|year=2002|publisher=[[South End Press]]|location=[[Cambridge]]|isbn=0-89608-660-7|oclc=51726597|pages=312–14|chapter=Greening the Swastika: Nativism and Anti-Semitism in the Population and Environment Debate|quote=MacDonald foresees a United States 'heading down a volatile path—a path that leads to ethnic warfare and to the development of collectivist, authoritarian and racial enclaves. MacDonald's views on fertility likewise build on his theory of biological determinism and his racist academic discourse ...' MacDonald's techniques of scapegoating may have evolved in complexity from classical Nazi fascism, but the similarities are far from remote.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Steven Pinker]], while acknowledging that he had "not plowed through MacDonald's trilogy and therefore run the complementary risks of being unfair to his arguments, and of not refuting them resoundingly enough to distance them from my own views on evolutionary psychology", states that MacDonald's theses are unable to pass the threshold of attention-worthiness or peer-approval, and contain a "consistently invidious portrayal of Jews, couched in value-laden, disparaging language".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psych.ucsb.edu/research/cep/slatedialog.html "Slate Magazine Dialogue On: How To Deal With Fringe Academics"], Center for Evolutionary Psychology, University of California Santa Barbara website; retrieved December 5, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/dialogues/features/2000/how_to_deal_with_fringe_academics/_10.html "How To Deal With Fringe Academics"], ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'', February 11, 2000; retrieved December 5, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reviewing MacDonald's ''Separation and Its Discontents'' in 2000, [[Zev Garber]] writes that MacDonald works from the assumption that the dual Torah is the blueprint of the eventual Jewish dominion over the world, and that he sees contemporary antisemitism, [[the Holocaust]], and attacks against Israel as "provoked by Jews themselves." Garber concludes that MacDonald's "rambling who-is-who-isn't roundup of Jews responsible for the 'Jewish Problem' borders on the irrational and is conducive to misrepresentation."&lt;ref&gt;Seth Garber.

In 2001, [[David Lieberman]], a Holocaust researcher at [[Brandeis University]], wrote "Scholarship as an Exercise in Rhetorical Strategy: A Case Study of Kevin MacDonald's Research Techniques", a paper in which he notes that one of MacDonald's sources, Jaff Schatz, objected to how MacDonald used his writings to further his premise that Jewish self-identity validates anti-Semitic sentiments and actions. "At issue, however, is not the quality of Schatz's research, but MacDonald's use of it, a discussion that relies less on topical expertise than on a willingness to conduct close comparative readings", Lieberman wrote.&lt;ref&gt;David Lieberman: ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20130324015704/http://www.h-net.org/~antis/papers/dl/macdonald_schatz_01.html Scholarship as an Exercise in Rhetorical Strategy: A Case Study of Kevin MacDonald's Research Techniques].'' H-Antisemitism: Occasional Papers, January 29, 2001 ([[Internet Archive]])&lt;/ref&gt; Lieberman accused MacDonald of dishonestly using lines from the work of [[Holocaust denial|Holocaust denier]] [[David Irving]]. Citing Irving's ''Uprising'', published in 1981 for the 25th anniversary of Hungary's failed anti-Communist revolution in 1956, MacDonald asserted in the ''Culture of Critique'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;The domination of the Hungarian communist Jewish bureaucracy thus appears to have had overtones of sexual and reproductive domination of gentiles in which Jewish males were able to have disproportionate sexual access to gentile females.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Lieberman, who noted that MacDonald is not a historian, debunked those assertions, concluding, "(T)he passage offers not a shred of evidence that, as MacDonald would have it, 'Jewish males enjoyed disproportionate sexual access to gentile females.'"&lt;ref&gt;[http://h-net.msu.edu/cgi-bin/logbrowse.pl?trx=vx&amp;list=h-antisemitism&amp;month=0107&amp;week=&amp;msg=C7elCpf5lP033ARNbvHjfg&amp;user=&amp;pw= Lieberman on Kevin MacDonald], h-net.msu.edu; accessed August 15, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

While most academics have not engaged MacDonald on his views about Judaism, Nathan Cofnas of the [[University of Oxford]] published a negative critique of MacDonald in the journal ''[[Human Nature (journal)|Human Nature]]'' in 2018. Cofnas argued ''contra'' Pinker that scholars needed to critically engage with MacDonald's work, in part because it had proved "enormously" influential among anti-Semites. Cofnas's own conclusion was that MacDonald's work relied upon "misrepresented sources and cherry-picked facts" and that the "evidence actually favors a simpler explanation of Jewish overrepresentation in intellectual movements involving Jewish high intelligence and geographic distribution."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cofnas|first1=Nathan|title=Judaism as a Group Evolutionary Strategy|journal=Human Nature|date=10 March 2018|pages=1–23|doi=10.1007/s12110-018-9310-x|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12110-018-9310-x|language=en|issn=1045-6767}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MacDonald has written that his critics have not judged his work on its merits but instead believe "the subject is taboo and discussing it should be forbidden."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://vdare.com/macdonald/061114_splc.htm |title=Heidi Does Long Beach: The SPLC vs. Academic Freedom |last=MacDonald |first=Kevin |date=2006-11-14 |website=[[VDARE]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090203042237/https://vdare.com/macdonald/061114_splc.htm |archive-date=2009-02-03 |access-date=2018-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disassociation by his colleagues===
In 2008 the CSULB academic senate issued the following statement: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;While the academic senate defends Dr. Kevin MacDonald's academic freedom and freedom of speech, as it does for all faculty, it firmly and unequivocally disassociates itself from the anti-Semitic and white ethnocentric views he has expressed.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The senate considered but rejected the use of the word "condemns" in the statement.&lt;ref name="senate"&gt;{{cite news|title=Academic senate disassociates itself from Professor MacDonald|first=Tiffany|last=Rider|date=October 6, 2008|work=Daily 49er|url=http://www.daily49er.com/news/academic-senate-disassociates-itself-from-professor-macdonald-1.773982|accessdate=August 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism by the ADL and the SPLC===
Mark Potok of the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) claims of MacDonald that "he put the anti-Semitism under the guise of scholarly work... Kevin MacDonald's work is nothing but gussied-up anti-Semitism. At base it says that Jews are out to get us through their agenda... His work is bandied about by just about every neo-Nazi group in America."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csulb.edu/~d49er/archives/2004/spring/news/volLIVno119-civil.shtml "Academic dishonesty punished more leniently"], csulb.edu; accessed August 15, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Anti-Defamation League (ADL) includes MacDonald in its list of American extremists, "Extremism in America", and wrote a report&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080922101131/http://www.adl.org/learn/ext_us/kevin_macdonald/default.asp?LEARN_Cat=Extremism&amp;LEARN_SubCat=Extremism_in_America&amp;xpicked=2&amp;item=7 Kevin MacDonald, Extremism in America], adl.org; accessed August 15, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; on MacDonald's views and ties. According to the ADL, his views on Jews mimic those of anti-Semites from the late 19th and early 20th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.adl.org/news/article/kevin-macdonald|title=Kevin MacDonald|website=Anti-Defamation League|language=en|access-date=2018-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MacDonald claims the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) "has initiated a campaign against me".&lt;ref name="macdonald"&gt;[http://www.kevinmacdonald.net/Beirich.htm "Campaign Against Me by the Southern Poverty Law Center"], kevinmacdonald.net; retrieved 2008-04-05.&lt;/ref&gt; He holds, among other complaints, that SPLC publicity, such as "The Thirteen Scariest People in America"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alternet.org/story/43586 "The Thirteen Scariest People in America"], alternet.org; accessed August 15, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; and "Promoting Hate&amp;mdash;California Professor is Font of Anti-Semitism",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.splcenter.org/intel/intelreport/article.jsp?aid=741 "Promoting Hate&amp;mdash;California Professor is Font of Anti-Semitism"], splcenter.org; accessed August 15, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; contain misrepresentations and distortions of his work. MacDonald has disputed the report that he has called for [[Jewish quota]]s and Jewish taxation, saying this was a hypothetical scenario taken out of context.&lt;ref name="macdonald"/&gt;

==CSULB comments==
MacDonald has been highly critical of the SPLC assessment of him, including the November 2006 visit to CSULB's campus by Heidi Beirich. Shortly after the visit, the university issued a statement supporting MacDonald's academic freedom. Beirich acknowledged that the university supported MacDonald "unequivocally."

A university spokeswoman stated, "The university will support MacDonald's academic freedom and freedom of speech." MacDonald was initially pressured to post a disclaimer on his website: "nothing on this website should be interpreted to suggest that I condone white racial superiority, genocide, Nazism, or Holocaust denial. I advocate none of these and strongly dissociate myself and my work from groups that do. Nor should my opinions be used to support discrimination against Jews or any other group."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.splcenter.org/intel/intelreport/article.jsp?pid=1364  "Promoting Hate"], splcenter.org; accessed August 15, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; He has since removed that disclaimer. In addition, the Psychology Department on December 4, and 6th, issued three statements: a "Statement on Academic Freedom and Responsibility in Research,"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csulb.edu/~psych/deptinfo/academic.html Psychology Faculty Position Announcements] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070702085018/http://www.csulb.edu/~psych/deptinfo/academic.html |date=2007-07-02 }}, csulb.edu; accessed August 15, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; a "Statement on Diversity,"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csulb.edu/~psych/deptinfo/diversity.html Psychology Faculty Position Announcements] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070702120252/http://www.csulb.edu/~psych/deptinfo/diversity.html |date=2007-07-02 }}, csulb.edu; accessed August 15, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; and a "Statement on Misuse of Psychologists' Work."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csulb.edu/~psych/deptinfo/misuse.html Psychology Faculty Position Announcements] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070702085045/http://www.csulb.edu/~psych/deptinfo/misuse.html |date=2007-07-02 }}, csulb.edu; accessed August 15, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

A spokeswoman for CSULB, said that at least two classes a year taught by all professors—including MacDonald—have student evaluations, and that some of the questions on those evaluations are open-ended, allowing students to raise any issue. "Nothing has come through" to suggest bias in class, she said. "We don't see it."&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;[http://insidehighered.com/news/2007/04/26/macdonald "Professor of Hate?"], insidehighered.com, April 26, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Jonathan Knight, who handles academic freedom issues for the American Association of University Professors said if there are no indications that MacDonald shares his views in class, "I don't see a basis for an investigation" into what goes on in his courses.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

===CSULB disassociates from MacDonald's views===
In late 2007 California State University–Long Beach's Department of Psychology began the process of formally disassociating itself from MacDonald's views on Judaism, which in some cases are "used by publications considered to publicize neo-Nazi and white supremacist ideology." The department's move followed a discussion of MacDonald's December forum presentation at meeting of the department's advisory committee that concerned his ethics and methodologies.&lt;ref name="disassociation"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://media.www.daily49er.com/media/storage/paper1042/news/2008/02/07/News/Psychology.Department.To.Issue.Statement.On.Professors.Controversial.Literature-3194393.shtml|title=Psychology department to issue statement on professor's controversial literature|last=Smith|first=Andrew|date=February 7, 2008|publisher=Daily 49er|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080315025852/http://media.www.daily49er.com/media/storage/paper1042/news/2008/02/07/News/Psychology.Department.To.Issue.Statement.On.Professors.Controversial.Literature-3194393.shtml|archivedate=March 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Late in 2006, a report issued by the Southern Poverty Law Center after an on-campus investigation labeled his work antisemitic and [[neo-Nazism|neo-Nazi]] propaganda, and described increasing concern about Macdonald's views by CSULB faculty members (see above).&lt;ref name="disassociation"/&gt; In an e-mail sent to the college's ''Daily Forty-Niner'' newspaper, MacDonald noted that he had already pledged not to teach about race differences in intelligence as a requirement for teaching his psychology class, and expressed that he was "not happy" about the disassociation. The newspaper  reported that in the e-mail, MacDonald confirmed that his books contained what the paper described as "his claims that the Jewish race was having a negative effect on Western civilization."&lt;ref name="disassociation"/&gt;

The Department of Psychology voted to release an April 23, 2008 statement saying, "We respect and defend his right to express his views, but we affirm that they are his alone and are in no way endorsed by the Department". The department expressed particular concern that "Dr. MacDonald's research on Jewish culture does not adhere to the Department's explicitly stated values".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cla.csulb.edu/departments/psychology/department-statements/ Statement on the Controversial Writings of Dr. Kevin MacDonald], csulb.edu; accessed February 16, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; On May 5 the school's academic senate issued a joint statement disassociating the school from MacDonald's anti-Semitic views, including specific statements from the Psychology department, the History department, the Anthropology department, the Jewish Studies program, and the Linguistics department. The statement concludes that "While the Academic Senate defends Dr. Kevin MacDonald's academic freedom and freedom of speech, as it does for all faculty, it firmly and unequivocally disassociates itself from the anti-Semitic and white ethnocentric views he has expressed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Statement on Dr. Kevin MacDonald|url=http://web.csulb.edu/divisions/aa/grad_undergrad/senate/resolutions/StatementonDr.KevinMacDonald.html|accessdate=February 16, 2018|work=CSULB|date=May 5, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2006 article in the American left-wing periodical ''[[The Nation]]'' reported that MacDonald's 2004 ''Understanding Jewish Influence: A Study in Ethnic Activism'' "has turned MacDonald into a celebrity within white nationalist and neo-Nazi circles."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thenation.com/doc/20060410/blumenthal "Republicanizing the Race Card"], thenation.com, March 23, 2006; accessed April 10, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in the ''[[Journal of Church and State]]'', Professor [[George Michael (professor)|George Michael]] noted that MacDonald's work "has been well received by those in the racialist right, as it amounts to a theoretically sophisticated justification for anti-Semitism", and that on the far right MacDonald "has attained a near reverential status and is generally considered beyond reproach".&lt;ref name="Michael"/&gt;

A colleague of MacDonald, Martin Fiebert&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csulb.edu/~mfiebert Martin Fiebert profile], csulb.edu; accessed August 15, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; in 2007 criticized MacDonald for "bigotry and cultural insensitivity" and called it "troubling" that MacDonald's work was being cited by white supremacist and neo-Nazi organizations.&lt;ref name="LATimes"&gt;Louis Sahagun. [http://articles.latimes.com/2007/apr/25/local/me-professor25 "Investigation of professor is urged"], latimes.com, April 25, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Heidi Beirich of the SPLC noted MacDonald's association with [[Virginia Abernethy]], a self-described "white separatist" and member of the white nationalist organization [[Council of Conservative Citizens]] which, according to Beirich, has described blacks as "a retrograde species of humanity."&lt;ref name="beirich"&gt;Heidi Beirich. "California State University, Long Beach Psychology Professor Kevin MacDonald Publishes Anti-Semitic Books", Southern Poverty Law Center Intelligence Report (Spring 2007); accessed February 17, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2004, MacDonald accepted the [[Jack London]] Literary Prize of $10,000 from ''The Occidental Quarterly'', which the SPLC claims is a white supremacist organization.&lt;ref name="beirich"/&gt; He is now also a member of the publication's Editorial Advisory Board, as well as the main contributor to its website and editor of its blog.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} In his acceptance speech, he stated, "The best way to preserve ethnic interests is to defend an ethnostate&amp;mdash;a nation that is explicitly intended to preserve the ethnic interests of its citizens." According to MacDonald, one of the functions of such a state would be to exclude non-European immigrants who are attracted to the state by its wealth and prosperity. At the conclusion of his speech, he remarked:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The alternative faced by Europeans throughout the Western world is to place themselves in a position of enormous vulnerability in which their destinies will be determined by other peoples, many of whom hold deep historically conditioned hatreds toward them. Europeans' promotion of their own displacement is the ultimate foolishness&amp;mdash;an historical mistake of catastrophic proportions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kevinmacdonald.net/WestSurvive.htm|date=October 31, 2004|title=Can the Jewish Model Help the West Survive?|last=MacDonald|first=Kevin|publisher=kevinmacdonald.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

MacDonald testified in the libel suit against [[Deborah Lipstadt]] brought by the Holocaust denier [[David Irving]], the suppression of whose work MacDonald had cited in ''Separation and Its Discontents'' as "an example of Jewish tactics for combating anti-Semitism." MacDonald later wrote that he felt Lipstadt had "exaggerated the extent to which Irving denied the Holocaust, since there are many places in his writings where Irving describes Nazis engaged in organized killing of Jews".&lt;ref name="beirich"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kevin MacDonald. [http://www.kevinmacdonald.net/irving.htm "My Decision to Testify for Irving"], kevinmacdonald.com; retrieved 2018-02-17.&lt;/ref&gt; MacDonald was quoted as saying he was an "agnostic" in regards to the Holocaust, though he denied the accuracy of the quote.&lt;ref name="beirich"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tony Ortega. [https://web.archive.org/web/20161204020343/http://web.csulb.edu/~kmacd/newtimes-Ortega2.html "Cal State Long Beach faculty members are trying to force Professor Kevin MacDonald to publicly defend his controversial views on Judaism"], csulb.edu; accessed August 15, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; MacDonald's testimony caused a backlash among his colleagues. Deborah Lipstadt's lawyer [[Richard Rampton]] thought MacDonald's testimony on behalf of Irving was so ridiculous that he did not bother to [[cross examination|cross examine]] him.&lt;ref&gt;http://lipstadt.blogspot.com/2008/02/avowed-antisemitic-professor-kevin.html&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Gray (judge)|Mr Justice Gray]] said in his judgment that the testimony provided by MacDonald was insufficient to establish that he was the victim of a conspiracy from the "traditional enemies of free speech" (i.e. Jews) to discredit Irving.&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/David_Irving_v_Penguin_Books_and_Deborah_Lipstadt/III&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
[[Max Blumenthal]] has written that MacDonald has an extensive following among white nationalists and neo-Nazis, which Blumenthal claims is inherently linked with MacDonald's political leanings (i.e. "Republicanizing the Race Card").&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Blumenthal]]. [http://www.thenation.com/doc/20060410/blumenthal "Republicanizing the Race Card"], thenation.com, March 23, 2006; "The journal contained Long Beach State University evolutionary psychology professor Kevin MacDonald's article 'Understanding Jewish Influence: A Study in Ethnic Activism', which contends that Jews have special psychological traits that allow them to out-compete white Gentiles for resources and power. The 2004 tract has turned MacDonald into a celebrity within white nationalist and neo-Nazi circles."&lt;/ref&gt; Former [[Ku Klux Klan]] leader [[David Duke]] praised MacDonald's work on his website.&lt;ref name="beirich"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Louis Sahagun. [http://www.calstate.edu/pa/clips2007/april/25april/prof.shtml "Probe of Cal State Long Beach professor sought"], latimes.com, April 25, 2007; "One of MacDonald's essays on Jews is highlighted on the official website of former Ku Klux Klan member David Duke, who said it contains 'a deeper intellectual understanding of the nature of Jewish supremacism and its implications for European Americans.{{'"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When MacDonald won his award from ''The Occidental Quarterly'', the ceremony was attended by David Duke; [[Don Black (white nationalist)|Don Black]], the founder of white supremacist site ''[[Stormfront (website)|Stormfront]]''; [[Jamie Kelso]], a senior moderator at Stormfront; and the head of the neo-Nazi [[National Vanguard (American organization)|National Vanguard]], [[Kevin Alfred Strom]]. In 2005, Kelso told ''The Occidental Report'' that he was meeting up with MacDonald to conduct business. MacDonald is featured in the Stormfront member Brian Jost's anti-immigration film, ''The Line in the Sand'', where he "blam[ed] Jews for destroying America by supporting immigration from developing countries."&lt;ref name="beirich"/&gt;

Heidi Beirich told the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' in an April 2007 interview that "Not since [[Hitler]]'s ''[[Mein Kampf]]'' have anti-Semites had such a comprehensive reference guide to what's 'wrong with Jews.' His work is widely advertised and touted on white supremacist websites and sold by neo-Nazi outfits like National Vanguard Books, which considers them 'the most important books of the last 100 years.'"&lt;ref name="LATimes"/&gt;

In 2010, MacDonald accepted a position as one of the eight members of the board of directors of the [[American Freedom Party]] (previously the American Third Position), which declares America a white Christian nation and advocates for limiting "non-white" immigration into the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.pslweb.org/site/News2?page=NewsArticle&amp;id=13591&amp;news_iv_ctrl=1030 MacDonald accepts seat on the board of the American Freedom Party] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222055514/http://www2.pslweb.org/site/News2?page=NewsArticle&amp;id=13591&amp;news_iv_ctrl=1030 |date=2014-02-22 }}, pslweb.org; accessed August 15, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2010, he began acting as director of the newly founded political party. A statement on their website reads, "If current demographic trends persist, European-Americans will become a minority in America in only a few decades time. The American Third Position will not allow this to happen. To safeguard our identity and culture, and to secure an American future for our people, we will immediately put an indefinite moratorium on all immigration."&lt;ref&gt;Butler, Kevin.

In October 2016, MacDonald spoke at an event hosted by the [[Holocaust denial]] organization [[Institute for Historical Review]], where he said that "Jews have successfully portrayed themselves as the ultimate victims." He shared the podium with the IHR's director [[Mark Weber (historian)|Mark Weber]] and with [[Gilad Atzmon]].&lt;ref name=ihr&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ihr.org/news/oct2016meetingreport.html|title=Gilad Atzmon, Kevin MacDonald, and Mark Weber Speak on Jewish–Zionist Power at Spirited IHR Meeting|publisher=[[Institute for Historical Review]]|access-date=9 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2016, MacDonald was a keynote speaker at an event hosted in [[Washington, D.C.]] by the [[National Policy Institute]], a "white nationalist think tank"&lt;ref name=npr&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2016/11/20/502719871/energized-by-trumps-win-white-nationalists-gather-to-change-the-world|title=Energized By Trump's Win, White Nationalists Gather To 'Change The World'|publisher=[[National Public Radio]]|author=Jessica Taylor|date=November 20, 2016|access-date=September 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; led by [[Richard B.

In a commentary in the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', political scientist Abraham Miller wrote that McDonald's theories about Jews were "the philosophical and theoretical inspiration" behind the slogan "Jews will not replace us" used at the 2017 white supremacist [[Unite the Right rally]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Miller, Abraham|title=The Theory Behind That Charlottesville Slogan |accessdate=October 8, 2018 |newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |date=April 2, 2018|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-theory-behind-that-charlottesville-slogan-1522708318}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Surrounding countryside at Phnom Sampeau (Battambang, Cambodia 2011).jpg|thumb|250px|right|View of the valley below Phnom Sampeau mountain]]
The '''killing caves of Phnom Sampeau''' are a [[Khmer Rouge]] execution site on Phnom Sampeau, a hill {{convert|7|mi|km|abbr=on}} southwest of [[Battambang]] in western [[Cambodia]]. The [[Khmer Rouge]] killed their victims on top of the cave at the rim of a daylight shaft or ceiling hole and then threw the dead body into the cave.&lt;ref name="DK"/&gt; Men and women were placed in separate caves and clothes in another.&lt;ref name="DK"&gt;{{cite book|author=DK Travel Guides|title=DK Eyewitness Travel Guide: Cambodia &amp; Laos|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Xt7kQaNSPMMC&amp;pg=PA180|date=1 June 2011|publisher=Dorling Kindersley Limited|isbn=978-1-4053-4985-7|page=91|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are a number of caves at Phnom Sampeau (Sampeau Hill) that have traditionally served as Buddhist temples. Today there is a large glass memorial in the cave next to the skulls and bones and a golden [[reclining Buddha]], that can be reached via a staircase.

The killing caves are located on the Mountain of Phnom Sampeau, about mid-way up the mountain along a {{convert|250|m|abbr=on}} well-made diversion road. The mountain is of karstic limestone and has a group of temples located on it.
The approach is {{convert|12|km|mi|abbr=on}} to the west of [[Battambang]] city on the road to [[Pailin]]. The mountain is also home for a group of [[macaque]]s, which feed on [[banana]]s left by pilgrims in front of the shrines. There is a natural arch made of stalactites from where there are scenic views of the deep canyon, and the valley also has vegetation of vines and inhabited by [[bat|bats]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/killing-caves-of-phnom-sampeau | title=Killing Caves of Phnom Sampeau | publisher=Atlas Obscura | accessdate=December 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.lonelyplanet.com/cambodia/battambang/attractions/phnom-sampeau/a/poi-sig/499500/355864 | title=Phnom Sampeau | publisher=Lonely Planet | accessdate=December 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cave statue in Phnom Sampeau (Battambang, Cambodia 2011).jpg|thumb|250px|right|A statue found in one of the caves in the Phnom Sampeau mountain]] 
The caves, which are approached through a series of steps flanked by green vegetation, have a golden, reclining Buddha image.  Skulls and bones are kept in a glass-covered cabin next to the Buddha statue. These were the people who were butchered by the [[Khmer Rouge|Khmer Rouge Regime]]; the bodies of those who were butchered were thrown through a natural chute from above, a skylight opening. Remnants of war artillery (of the government forces) are seen there, oriented towards [[Phnom Krapau]] ([[Crocodile]] Mountain), which was the strategic location of the Khmer Rouge during the war. At the base point from where the steps lead to the cave, there is an old memorial, a chicken-wire enclosure which also houses skulls and bones of those killed by the Khmer Rouge. Another feature seen is an incomplete Buddha carving, a {{Convert|30|ft|adj=on}} image, carved partly into the rock face of the hill, with only the head of the Buddha exposed. Lack of funds was the reason for its incompleteness.&lt;ref name="RayBloom2010"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.showcaves.com/english/misc/showcaves/Killing.html | title=Killing Caves Death Caves of Battambang - Death Caves of Phnom Sampeou | publisher=showcaves com | accessdate=December 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''{{nihongo|Koza riot|コザ暴動|Koza bōdō}}''' was a violent and spontaneous protest against the [[United States Forces Japan|US military presence in Okinawa]], which occurred on the night of December 20, 1970, into the morning of the following day. Roughly 5,000 Okinawans clashed with roughly 700 American [[military police|MPs]] in an event which has been regarded as symbolic of Okinawan anger against 25 years of US military occupation.&lt;ref name=chanpuru&gt;Kadekawa. p176.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ryukyushimpo.jp/news/storyid-114280-storytopic-86.html |title=矛盾に満ちた住民対立/コザ騒動から30年 - 琉球新報 - 沖縄の新聞、地域のニュース |publisher=Ryukyushimpo.jp |date= |accessdate=2013-06-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305205751/http://ryukyushimpo.jp/news/storyid-114280-storytopic-86.html |archivedate=2012-03-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the riot, approximately 60 Americans were injured, 80 cars were burned, and several buildings on [[Kadena Air Base]] were destroyed or heavily damaged.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, Jon, "[http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/fl20111217a1.html Military policeman's 'hobby' documented 1970 Okinawa rioting]", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 17 December 2011, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Following Japan's defeat in [[World War II]], Japan came to be formally [[Occupation of Japan|occupied by Allied forces]] and governed under martial law for roughly seven years. While the Occupation of Japan came to an end and most of Japan regained its independence in April 1952, [[Okinawa Prefecture]] was to remain under US military occupation for another twenty years.

By 1970, it had already been decided and was widely known that the [[United States Civil Administration of the Ryukyu Islands|US military occupation of Okinawa]] was going to be ended in 1972, and that Okinawa would return to being a [[Prefectures of Japan|part of independent Japan]], but also that a considerable US military presence was to remain. This came in the wake of a number of incidents between servicemen and Okinawan civilians over the years, including a hit-and-run accident in September 1970, only a few months prior to the riot, which resulted in the death of an Okinawan housewife from [[Itoman]]. The servicemen involved in that incident were acquitted at their court-martial.&lt;ref name=inoue&gt;Inoue. pp53-55.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=shimpo&gt;"''Koza hanbei sōdō''". ''Okinawa konpakuto jiten'' (沖縄コンパクト事典, "Okinawa Compact Encyclopedia").&lt;/ref&gt; This incident fueled the growing discontent of Okinawans with the standard [[U.S.–Japan Status of Forces Agreement|status of forces]] that exempted US servicemen from Okinawan justice, as are all military personnel stationed on foreign soil long term.&lt;ref&gt;Aldous, p. 163&lt;/ref&gt;

==The riot==
The riot lasted seven or eight hours, beginning in the early morning hours of December 20, 1970 and continuing past dawn. It was not pre-meditated, planned or arranged, but is said to have erupted spontaneously from tensions, which had reached a breaking point.&lt;ref name=inoue/&gt;

Around 1 o'clock that night, a car being driven by a drunk American serviceman hit a drunken Okinawan man, on a road near a major entertainment and [[red-light district]] in Koza (now called [[Okinawa, Okinawa|Okinawa City]]), a short distance from [[Kadena Air Force Base]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/community/2011/01/08/general/ex-mp-revisits-okinawas-koza-riot/#.Ufwee9-B2Kk|title=Ex-MP revisits Okinawa’s Koza Riot|publisher=JapanTimes|date=|accessdate=2013-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Americans got out of their car and made sure the man was alright; he presently stood up and walked away. The four men were then about to get back into their car to leave the scene when they were confronted by a number of Okinawan taxi drivers who had witnessed the accident. A crowd began to form; some were shouting "no more acquittals", "Yankee go home" and "don’t insult Okinawans".&lt;ref&gt;Aldous, p. 158&lt;/ref&gt;

Two American military police vehicles also arrived, sirens blaring. While the newly arrived MPs attempted to extricate their comrades from the situation, the crowd had the victim lie down where he'd been hit, and had him reenact the incident.&lt;ref name=inoue/&gt; Many accounts emphasize that the newly arrived MPs ignored the man who had been hit, focusing only on seeking to extricate their countrymen.&lt;ref name=shinzato&gt;Shinzato. p243.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ryukyushimpo.jp/news/storyid-95234-storytopic-86.html |title=沖縄市が「コザ反米騒動」資料入手/米国民政府、騒乱罪適用に消極的 - 琉球新報 - 沖縄の新聞、地域のニュース |publisher=Ryukyushimpo.jp |date=2011-01-08 |accessdate=2013-06-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131106084956/http://ryukyushimpo.jp/news/storyid-95234-storytopic-86.html |archivedate=2013-11-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another American car arriving on the scene accidentally struck one belonging to an Okinawan, and as passersby and people from the neighborhood stopped to get involved, the crowd grew to around 700, began to throw rocks and bottles, and attempted to turn over the car involved in the original accident.  Okinawan police were able to remove the American driver safely from the scene, but the confrontation continued to escalate.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, Jon, "[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/fl20110108a1.html Ex-MP revisits Okinawa's Koza Riot]", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 8 January 2011, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Koza Riot 1.jpg|thumb|left|An Okinawan policeman surveys the damage hours after the riot]]Warning shots were fired, attracting a larger crowd, which soon numbered around five thousand; the number of MPs on the scene was now around 700. The rioters broke into, turned over, and torched over seventy cars, and continued to throw rocks and bottles, along with [[Molotov cocktails]] assembled in nearby homes, bars, restaurants, and other establishments.  The rioters pulled American servicemen from their cars and beat them, then burned their cars. Some of the rioters danced traditional folk dances as the riot continued around them; others passed through the gate into the Air Force Base, overturning and torching cars, breaking windows, and otherwise raining destruction upon American property there as well.  About 500 rioters then broke the fence of Kadena Air Base and razed the military employment building and the offices of the ''Stars and Stripes'' newspaper.  The MPs, meanwhile, began to deploy [[tear gas]].&lt;ref name=inoue/&gt; The riot finally died down and came to an end around 7 o'clock in the morning;&lt;ref name=shinzato/&gt; in the end, many were injured, including 60 Americans, and 82 people arrested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.okinawatimes.co.jp/article/2010-12-17_12894/ |title=沖縄タイムス &amp;#124; |publisher=Okinawatimes.co.jp |date=2007-10-09 |accessdate=2013-06-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314100105/http://www.okinawatimes.co.jp/article/2010-12-17_12894/ |archivedate=2012-03-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Politics of Sri Lanka}}

The '''Legislative Council of Ceylon''' was the [[legislative body]] of [[British Ceylon|Ceylon]] (now [[Sri Lanka]]) established in 1833, along with the [[Executive Council of Ceylon]], on the recommendations of the [[Colebrooke-Cameron Commission]]. It was the first form of representative government in the island. The 1931 [[Donoughmore Constitution]] replaced the Legislative Council with the [[State Council of Ceylon]].

Members of the Legislative Council, used the [[post-nominal letters]], '''MLC'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.island.lk/2007/09/11/opinion1.html Did Donoughmore make a serious mistake?]&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History==
===Introduction===
In 1833 the [[Colebrooke-Cameron Commission]] created the Legislative Council of Ceylon, the first step in representative government in [[British Ceylon]]. Initially the Legislative Council consisted of 16 members: the [[British governors of Ceylon|British Governor]], the five appointed members of the [[Executive Council of Ceylon]] (the [[Colonial Secretary of Ceylon|Colonial Secretary]], the [[Attorney General of Sri Lanka|Attorney General]], the [[Auditor General of Sri Lanka|Auditor-General]], the Treasurer and the [[General Officer Commanding, Ceylon|General Officer Commanding]]), four other government officials (including the [[Government Agent (Sri Lanka)|Government Agents]] of the Western and Central provinces) and six appointed unofficial members (three Europeans, one [[Sinhalese people|Sinhalese]], one [[Tamil people|Tamil]] and one [[Burgher people|Burgher]]). The unofficial members had no right to initiate legislation; they could only contribute to discussion. This was the first step towards giving the people of the country a voice in its administration. However, in 1860 the member of the Legislative Council were given the right to introduce legislation which did not deal with the financial matters.&lt;ref&gt;Cyrene Siriwardhana, Sri Lanak Law College Entrance Examination Course Book,(The Incorporated Council of Legal Education/Sri Lanka Law College, 1998), 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1889 the number of appointed unofficial members was increased to eight (three Europeans, one Low Country Sinhalese, one Kandyan Sinhalese, one Tamil, one [[Sri Lankan Moors|Muslim]] and one Burgher).

===McCallum Reforms===
The Legislative Council was reformed in 1910 by the ''McCallum Reforms''. Membership was increased from 18 to 21, of which 11 were official and 10 were unofficial. Of the non-official members, six were appointed by the governor (two Low Country Sinhalese, two Tamils, one Kandyan Sinhalese and one  Muslim) and remaining four were elected (two Europeans, one Burgher and one educated Ceylonese).

The most notable aspect of the ''McCallum Reforms'' was the introduction of elected members. However, fewer than 3,000 people (4%) could vote, as the right to vote was based on education and assets held. One of the four elected non-official members was [[Ponnambalam Ramanathan]]. The financial committee was also established to control the revenue. It included the Colonial Secretary, Colonial Treasurer, Revenue Controller and all the non-official elected members. These changes did not satisfy the Ceylonese, and the movement for constitutional reforms grew.

===First Manning Reforms===
Further reforms were enacted in 1920 by the ''First Manning Reforms''. Membership was increased from 21 to 37, of which 14 were official and 23 were unofficial. Of the non-official members, four were appointed by the governor (two Kandyan Sinhalese, one Muslim and one [[Indian Tamils of Sri Lanka|Indian Tamil]]) and the remaining 19 were elected (11 on a territorial basis, five Europeans, two Burghers and one Chamber of Commerce).

A notable change was the introduction of territorial constituencies. Of the 11 territorial constituencies, three were from the [[Western Province, Sri Lanka|Western Province]] and one each from the other eight provinces. Three non-official members were elected to the Executive Council. Yet again the Ceylonese were not satisfied and requested more change.

===Second Manning Reforms===
The ''Second Manning Reforms'' of 1923 increased membership from 37 to 49, of which 12 were official and 37 were unofficial. Of the non-official members, eight were appointed by the governor (three Muslim, two Indian Tamils and three others) and the remaining 29 were elected (23 on a territorial basis, three Europeans, two Burghers, one Ceylon Tamil for the Western Province). The 23 territorial constituencies were distributed as follows:
* [[Central Province, Sri Lanka|Central Province]] 2
* [[Eastern Province, Sri Lanka|Eastern Province]] 2
* [[Northern Province, Sri Lanka|Northern Province]] 5
* [[North Central Province, Sri Lanka|North Central Province]] 1
* [[North Western Province, Sri Lanka|North Western Province]] 2
* [[Sabaragamuwa Province]] 2
* [[Southern Province, Sri Lanka|Southern Province]] 3
* [[Uva Province]] 1
* [[Western Province, Sri Lanka|Western Province]] 5

The head of the Legislative Council had been the Governor, but the new reforms created the post of '''President of the Legislative Council''', which was held by the Governor on a nominal basis, and the '''Vice President of the Legislative Council''' was elected, who was [[James Peiris]]. Four non-official members were also selected to be part of the Executive Council.

===Replacement===
Due to the shortcomings of the ''Second Manning Reforms'' the [[Donoughmore Commission]] was sent to Ceylon. The Commission gained its name from the royal commission under the [[Earl of Donoughmore]] that came to Ceylon in 1927. Its recommendations led to Ceylon gaining limited self-government and the replacement of the Legislative Council with the [[State Council of Ceylon]] in 1931.

The ROC has ''de facto'' relations with most sovereign states. A significant political movement within Taiwan advocates [[Taiwan independence]].&lt;/ref&gt; The Republic of China participates in the [[World Health Organization]] and a number of non-UN international organizations such as the [[World Trade Organization]], [[International Olympic Committee]] and others under a variety of pseudonyms, most commonly [[Chinese Taipei]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7326">The '''Malay Agenda''' is a concept in [[Malaysia]]n [[Malaysian politics|politics]] related to the ideal of ''[[ketuanan Melayu]]'' (Malay supremacy or dominance). Although it did not feature in public discussion for much of the 20th century, in the early 2000s, it came to prominence due to its usage in the discourse of several politicians from the [[United Malays National Organisation]] (UMNO), the leading [[political party]] in Malaysia. The Malay Agenda is closely related to UMNO, which sees itself as the guardian of the Malay majority ethnic group in Malaysia.

==Definition==
According to one local academic, the Malay Agenda constitutes the special privileges granted to the Malays and other indigenous peoples (collectively referred to as [[Bumiputra]]s) in the [[Constitution of Malaysia]]. This would include the articles relating to the Malay monarchs and the Malaysian head of state, the [[Yang di-Pertuan Agong]], the portions of the Constitution pertaining to Malay-associated national symbols such as the position of [[Islam]] as the state religion, Malay land reservations, and the status of the [[Malay language]] as the national language. The controversial [[Article 153]], which grants Malays several preferences and [[Quota Share|quota]]s in the sphere of education, employment and the civil service, would also fall under the Malay Agenda. It is held that non-Malay Malaysians were granted Malaysian citizenship in return for their acceptance of the Malay Agenda &amp;mdash; in another sense, the Malay Agenda represents half of the [[Malaysian social contract]], with the other half being the granting of citizenship to the non-Malays.&lt;ref&gt;[http://malaysia-today.net/blog2006/newsncom.php?itemid=701 M'sia's continued survival hinges on Malay Agenda, says don] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927004300/http://malaysia-today.net/blog2006/newsncom.php?itemid=701 |date=2007-09-27 }}. (Nov. 14, 2006). ''Malaysia Today''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Malay Agenda assumes a local tinge at the state level; different states emphasises different aspects of the Agenda. In the [[Federal Territories (Malaysia)|Federal Territory]] of [[Kuala Lumpur]], [[urban poverty]] and [[slum]]s are the main thrust of the UMNO delegation. In a rural state like [[Terengganu]], poverty eradication and religion are underscored.&lt;ref&gt;Tan, Joceline (Nov. 12, 2006).

==Modern usage==
The Malay Agenda has been particularly prominent in UMNO General Assemblies. It is often associated by politicians with Malay political primacy, as embodied by ''[[ketuanan Melayu]]'', and the [[Malaysian New Economic Policy]] (NEP), which grants Malays substantial preferences and quotas in the private sector.

In the 2006 UMNO General Assembly, several politicians brought up the issue of leaders from other members of the governing coalition, the [[Barisan Nasional]], who criticised or questioned the government's ethnic policies. One analyst said: "This AGM is quite interesting in other ways, apart from the feuding that does exist, which seems to purport that there are different groups in opposition to each other within the ruling party; it's clearly a question of what we might call simply as a Malay agenda, and the Malay agenda is the primacy of Malays in politics in this country."&lt;ref&gt;Goh, Melissa (Nov. 14, 2006). [http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/southeastasia/view/241117/1/.html 'Malay agenda' expected to dominate UMNO General Assembly]. ''Channelnewsasia.com''.&lt;/ref&gt; 

At the Assembly, Education Minister and UMNO Youth Chief [[Hishamuddin Hussein]], who had made headlines when he brandished the Malay dagger (''[[kris]]'') at the previous year's Assembly, stated that "The Malay Agenda in the National Mission should not be regarded as a zero-sum game, by saying only the Malays are benefiting and that the non-Malays are losing out. The non-[[bumiputera (Malaysia)|bumiputera]]s should be brave enough to admit that during the implementation of the New Economic Policy, they also derived benefits, either directly or indirectly, through projects in the various sectors." Other delegates spoke out against the perceived economic inequities, citing the Malays' official share of equity that stood at 18%, although Malays comprised almost half the Malaysian population.&lt;ref&gt;Ahmad, Zainon (Nov. 14, 2006). [http://sun2surf.com/article.cfm?id=16106 Umno delegates stick to the script] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070125235113/http://www.sun2surf.com/article.cfm?id=16106 |date=2007-01-25 }}. ''The Sun''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The share of equity itself had been heatedly disputed not long before when a local [[think tank]] calculated the Malay share of equity to stand at 45% in 2006, based on the 1,000 publicly listed companies. This significantly exceeded the government target of 30%, which had been set by the NEP. However, the figures were disputed by the government, which used [[par value]] instead of [[market value]] to calculate equity, did not consider any portion of government-linked companies to be Malay-owned, and looked at all 600,000 registered companies instead of just the publicly listed ones.&lt;ref&gt;Ahmad, Abdul Razak &amp; Chow, Kum Hor (Oct. 22, 2006). "The nation's economic pie in perspective", pp. 20&amp;ndash;21. ''New Sunday Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; Critics argued, however, that the usage of par value was antiquated and did not reflect the true value of the equity owned.&lt;ref&gt;Backman, Michael (Nov. 15, 2006). [http://www.theage.com.au/news/business/while-malaysia-fiddles-its-opportunities-are-running-dry/2006/11/14/1163266550487.html?page=fullpage While Malaysia fiddles, its opportunities are running dry]. ''The Age''.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Najib crop.jpg|thumb|150px|Deputy Prime Minister [[Najib Tun Razak]] said there would be no time limit for the expiration of the Malay Agenda.]]

At the Assembly, some responded by calling for the Malay equity target to be increased to 70%, in line with the Malay Agenda.&lt;ref&gt;Hamid, Wan Hamidi (Nov. 15, 2006). [http://malaysia-today.net/blog2006/newsncom.php?itemid=744 Brickbats for BN partners] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927003444/http://malaysia-today.net/blog2006/newsncom.php?itemid=744 |date=2007-09-27 }}. ''New Straits Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, Deputy Prime Minister [[Najib Tun Razak]] said that there would be no time limit set for the achievement of the Malay Agenda, arguing that four centuries of colonialist oppression of the Malays could not be undone in a few decades.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2006/11/14/nation/16010545&amp;sec=nation No time limit to achieve Malay Agenda, says Najib] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070710082328/http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=%2F2006%2F11%2F14%2Fnation%2F16010545&amp;sec=nation |date=2007-07-10 }}.

'''Martial arts Therapy''' refers to the usage of [[martial arts]] as an alternative or complementary therapy for a [[Disorder (medicine)|medical disorder]]. This can include disorders of the [[Physical disorder|body]] or of the [[Mental disorder|mind]]. The therapy may involve applications such as promoting [[kinaesthetic]] balance in the elderly or impaired, through [[T'ai chi ch'uan]], or reducing [[aggressiveness]] in specific populations (Lamarre, 1999).

==History==

=== Comparison with other methods ===
While more conventional treatments such as [[weight training]] and [[psychotherapy]] are also of significant benefit, martial arts therapy can embody unique traits that other therapies don’t incorporate into their practice. For example, in children with low [[self-esteem]], this therapy can simultaneously develop areas such as [[self-defense]] skills (to defend against physical bullying), [[physical fitness]], instructions on how to handle [[Stress (medicine)|stressful]] scenarios in a physical or mental context, and [[self-confidence]], through successful applications of martial technique, such as [[Breaking (martial arts)|board-breaking]] or [[kata]].

One of the crucial features of the therapy is the type of martial art, as well as the lesson plans of the instructor. For instance, a [[boxing]] program with a competition-oriented instructor will not provide the same experience as a [[T'ai chi ch'uan|t'ai chi]] instructor who emphasizes mindfulness of one’s actions and thoughts. Although both boxing and t'ai chi can be defined as martial arts, their histories, emphasis and other features are drastically different. Looking specifically at [[karate]], a [[kyokushin]] karate class (which emphasizes full-contact sparring with bare knuckles) versus a [[shotokan]] karate class (which places more emphasis on personal discipline and control than fighting), research in this area has not yet determined which particular feature(s) of martial arts are of definite therapeutic value.

=== Psychosocial issues ===
An important issue with martial arts therapy in a psychological context is the distinction between a therapeutic approach and a martial approach to the lessons. With the evolution of martial arts into combat systems ([[Krav Maga]]) and combat sports ([[Kickboxing]], [[Submission Wrestling]], [[Mixed martial arts]]), many instructors and organizations teach only martial/combative techniques with little (if any) attention to [[philosophical]], [[Spirituality|spiritual]] or [[societal]] issues. In other words, students may only be taught how to fight without lessons in the proper context for applying these techniques, something that is emphasized in more [[traditional martial art]] curricula. Hypothetically, if these philosophical/societal teachings were one of the specific therapeutic factors in martial arts study, studying an art without these teachings would be of little therapeutic benefit, and arguably detrimental to psychological health (Reynes, 2002). Additionally, if not properly informed, a patient undergoing martial arts therapy may erroneously believe they are acquiring martial proficiency when in fact, the curriculum they are learning is unsuitable for [[self-defense]] or [[Competition#Sports|competitive]] needs.

Another contentious area is the topic of whether martial arts training promotes or inhibits pro-[[social behaviour]]s, particularly among youths and adolescents. It has been only within the past 5 years (since 2006) that studies with high-quality methodologies have devoted themselves to this particular topic. Earlier studies had conclusions that suffered from issues such as:

* A lack of followup following a study's end (which would help assess long-term efficacy of treatment)
* Missing or mismatched comparison groups to evaluate treatment efficacy compared to control or even general fitness (i.e. martial arts therapy vs. [[aerobics]] vs. the [[Scientific control|control]] group)
* Little attention to outcomes from the style or type of martial art (few style vs. style comparisons, modern styles vs. traditional, etc.)

It is this last point that appears to be most pertinent to the question of promoting or inhibiting aggressiveness and delinquency among children. Some researchers point towards a [[catharsis]] model where practising a martial art enables a person to "burn off" [[emotional energy]] to revive themselves. Others claim that under [[Albert Bandura]]'s [[social learning theory]], receiving praise and benefit for practising violent activities (like some martial arts) reinforces violence in a person and conditions them to be more aggressive and hostile outside of their activity. Endresen &amp; Olweus (2005) recently conducted a study that participating in power sports (which included kick-boxing, boxing, wrestling and weightlifting) "leads to an increase or enhancement of antisocial involvement in the form of elevated levels of violent as well as [[non-violent]] [[antisocial behaviour]] outside sports." Given that these activities customarily contain few moral/philosophical teachings regarding conduct, this supports a tentative conclusion that traditional martial arts (which ''do'' typically offer moral/philosophical teachings) are superior to modern martial arts or combat sport training in reducing antisocial behaviour in children and adolescents.

=== Physical medicine issues ===

In a physical medicine context, the nature of an injury or disorder may disqualify some arts from usage, as their conventional curriculum/focus may be too rigorous. One wouldn’t expect a patient with joint issues to enroll in [[Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu]] (which emphasizes techniques to hyper-extend joints to the point of pain submission) or elderly patients to enroll in [[Muay Thai]] (which requires a high level of physical fitness and incorporates highly damaging techniques with the elbows, knees, legs, and fists). However, in some cases, curricula were modified so that within these disciplines, martial proficiency was de-emphasized in favor of physical betterment. In one notable study, an Israeli researcher (who was a former [[Judo]] champion of [[Israel]]) taught a modified form of judo to children that had significant visual and mental impairments (blindness, retardation), and in some cases, physical impairment (such as [[cerebral palsy]]). The resulting increase in physical and cognitive abilities of all the children was of greater quantity than other previous forms of physical exercise, in addition to being longer lasting (Gleser, 1992).
In Kalarippayattu, Marmachikilsa (Marmam=Vital points) is another expertise achieved by masters who heal the Marma damages –impacts, internal injuries, dislocation, fracture, or paralysis type cases in fight or fall. Course of uzhichil or particular massage with special herbal oil, like ayurvedic model treatment is a routine affair for all Kalari trainees to enhance the flexibility of joints and toning of muscles.Chavitiuzhichil or foot massage is given at the stage of ankathari.

=== Areas for consideration ===

Current trends in research on martial arts' therapeutic benefit points towards generally positive outcomes, especially for physical benefits (one exception to this being possible sustained injuries from competitive applications). But for assessing psychosocial benefits, the evidence is more ambiguous. As with any psychological study, defining concepts such as "[[happiness]]", "aggressive attitudes" and "[[self-confidence]]" can be a challenging task compared to defining physically related concepts such as "improved [[cardiovascular]] health."

A frequent measure used in martial arts research to determine therapeutic outcome is the Profile of Mood States (POMS), created by McNair, Lorr, and Droppleman (1971). This is a 65-item survey that measures 6 distinct mood areas, such as "tension-[[anxiety]]" and "[[anger]]-hostility." A commonly used methodology in martial arts studies that employed the POMS was to administer it before a set period of martial instruction and after that same period (ranging from a single lesson to several over days/weeks/months). A successful demonstration of therapeutic benefit would be if study participants showed positive, statistically significant changes in their scores from the first administration to the second.

Beyond these issues of [[construct validity]], even if every study of therapeutic martial arts netted a positive outcome (which has not been the case), determining which facets of the instruction were responsible for the change would be vital for widespread application. Potential factors in martial arts could be: cultivating martial ability (being able to fight), philosophical/moral instruction, the proportion of [[hard and soft (martial arts)|"hard" and "soft"]] techniques, physical exertion, attainment of rank/status, successful application of techniques in the school, developed friendships with other classmates and any other number of factors. Additionally, the benefit may not be derived from any single factor, but through a unique combination of factors that only martial arts provides. At least one study has shown that compared to students in a sport-specific program, a general fitness program, and a [[control group]], students of a martial arts program derived superior improvement in POMS scores compared to the other three groups.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}

=== Perspectives ===
Martial arts therapy is a concept still in development. Researchers have yet to conclusively identify the specific features of martial arts that foster a physical or [[psychosocial]] benefit. Some have theorized (see Israeli study cited above) that an important feature is the dyadic interplay between students in most arts; the cooperation and response to feedback in practicing techniques such as throws or strikes may have a carryover to cooperation in real-life settings. However, even if all features are conclusively discovered within a specific art or system, there remains the issue of to what extent the instructors within that art/system provide those features to their students.

== Early life==

Peinovich grew up in suburban Pennsylvania, in an upper-middle class family; he was raised by his father, a college professor, and his stepmother.&lt;ref name="newyorker1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/10/16/birth-of-a-white-supremacist |title=Birth of a White Supremacist |publisher=The New Yorker |date= |accessdate=July 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; His parents divorced at a young age.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3804">'''National Popular Vote Inc.''' is a non-profit organization based in [[Los Altos, California|Los Altos]], [[California]], launched in 2006 by [[Barry Fadem]] and [[John Koza]], and led by Fadem, Koza and businessman, reform advocate and past Independence Party candidate for Governor of New York [[B. Thomas Golisano]]. Its purpose, according to its official website, is "to study, analyze and educate the public regarding a proposal to provide for the nationwide popular election of the President", and it champions the [[National Popular Vote Interstate Compact]].

==The proposal==
National Popular Vote's proposal is a type of electoral college reform also known as the [[Amar Plan]].

The group's official website describes their approach as follows:
"Nationwide popular election of the President can be implemented if the states join together to pass identical state laws awarding all of their electoral votes to the presidential candidate receiving the most popular votes in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. The proposed state legislation would come into effect only when it has been enacted, in identical form, by enough states to elect a President -- that is, by states possessing a majority (270) of the 538 electoral votes."

==Progress==
{{further|National Popular Vote Interstate Compact}}

Within the first several months of its 2006 launch and media campaign, National Popular Vote's proposal began to make progress in various state legislatures. Early action occurred both in large Democratic strongholds California, [[New York (state)|New York]], and [[Illinois]], as well as in medium-sized swing and red states such as [[Colorado]], [[Missouri]], and [[Louisiana]].

Some have speculated that the organization is being poorly advised and lacks the political strategy to successfully pass the initiative in state legislatures. Particularly, the organization has failed to garner [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] support for the proposal given the [[Republican National Committee]]'s formal declaration of opposition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2011/aug/5/rnc-nixes-national-popular-vote-initiative/ RNC Nixes National Popular Vote Initiative], washingtontimes.com&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Netocracy''' was a term invented by the editorial board of the American technology magazine [[Wired magazine|''Wired'']] in the early 1990s. A [[portmanteau]] of ''[[Internet]]'' and ''[[aristocracy]]'', ''netocracy'' refers to a perceived global upper-class that bases its power on a technological advantage and networking skills, in comparison to what is portrayed as a [[bourgeoisie]] of a gradually diminishing importance.

The concept was later picked up and redefined by the Swedish philosophers [[Alexander Bard]] and [[Jan Söderqvist]] for their book ''Netocracy — The New Power Elite and Life After Capitalism'' (originally published in Swedish in 2000 as ''Nätokraterna - boken om det elektroniska klassamhället'', published in English by Reuters/Pearsall UK in 2002).

The netocracy concept has been compared with [[Richard Florida]]'s concept of the [[creative class]]. Bard and Söderqvist have also defined an under-class in opposition to the netocracy, which they refer to as the consumtariat.

==The consumtariat==
Alexander Bard describes a new [[underclass]] called the consumtariat, a [[portmanteau]] of [[consumer]] and [[proletariat]], whose main activity is consumption, regulated from above. It is kept occupied with private problems, its desires provoked with the use of adverts and its active participation is limited to things like [[Consumer choice|product choice]], product customization, engaging with interactive products and life-style choice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bard|first1=Alexander|last2=Sšderqvist|first2=Jan|title=The Netocracts: Futurica Trilogy 1|publisher=Stockholm Text|isbn=9789187173004|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=TeWCBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT131|accessdate=3 March 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cyberdeutocracy==
Similar to Netocracy, is the concept of Cyberdeutocracy. Karl W. Deutsch in his book The Nerves of Government: Models of Political Communication and Control&lt;ref&gt;Deutsch, K. (1966). The Nerves of Government: Models of Political Communication and Control. New York: Free Press.&lt;/ref&gt; hypothesized about “information elites, controlling means of mass communication and, accordingly, power institutions, the functioning of which is based on the use of information in their activities.” Thus Deutsch introduced the concept of deutocracy, combining the words ‘ Deutsch’ and ‘ autocracy’ to get the new term
Combining terms 'deutocracy' and ‘ autocracy’ one can get a new term cyberdeutocracy. It is defined as a political regime, based on the control of the political and corporate elites of the information and communication infrastructure of the Internet space. 
Cyberdeutocracy, thus as its fundamental basis has such a resource as the global and managed virtual communication space within which the destruction of the existing, transformation, generation, and introduction in the public consciousness of alternative meanings, symbols, values, and ideas takes place, that shape perception society of political reality take place.The term was first introduced by Phillip Freiberg&lt;ref&gt; What are CyberSimulacra and Cyberdeutocracy?https://www.academia.edu/37288676/What_are_CyberSimulacra_and_Cyberdeutocracy_&lt;/ref&gt;, in his article that analyzed alleged Russian cyber involvement in 2016 U.S. elections, as well as banning people from social networks based on their political views.


==Other usages==
Netocracy can also refer to "Internet-enabled democracy" where issue-based politics will supersede party-based politics.

The word ''netocracy'' is also used as a [[portmanteau]] of ''Internet'' and ''democracy'', not of ''Internet'' and ''aristocracy'':
*"In Seattle, organized labor ran interference for the ragtag groups assembled behind it, marshaling several thousand union members who feared that free trade might send their jobs abroad. In Washington, labor focused on lobbying Congress over the China-trade issue, leaving the IMF and the World Bank to the ad hoc Netocracy."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,996690-4,00.html The New Radicals]; [[Time (magazine)]]; April 24, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;
*"From his bungalow in Berkeley, he's spreading the word of grassroots netocracy to the Beltway. He formed an Internet political consulting firm with Jerome ..."&lt;ref&gt;[[San Francisco Chronicle]]; January 15, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''No, They Can't: Why Government Fails – But Individuals Succeed''''' is a 2012 book by [[John Stossel]], the American consumer [[reporter]], [[Investigative journalism|investigative journalist]], author and [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] columnist. It was published on April 10, 2012, and focuses on what Stossel sees as the failures of [[Interventionism (politics)|government intervention]].&lt;ref name="reason"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ontheroad"/&gt;

== Summary ==
Stossel argues that "he has dismantled society’s fat cows with unerring common sense. Now he debunks the most sacred of them all: our intuition and belief that government can solve our problems." The term "no, they can't" is a rebuttal to the chant used in [[Barack Obama presidential campaign, 2008#Slogan|Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign]] ("Yes we can").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode | title=Illegal Everything | series=[[Stossel (TV series)|Stossel]] | credits=[[John Stossel]] | network=[[Fox Business Network]] | airdate=February 24, 2012 | season=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book gives several examples of government intervention: [[trade barrier]]s, [[Food and Drug Administration|food and medical regulation]], the [[United States Department of Education|education system]], labor unions, [[Gun politics in the United States|gun control]], [[Minimum wage in the United States|minimum wage laws]], the [[war on drugs]], and advocates of [[universal health care]].&lt;ref name="reason"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://reason.org/blog/show/new-john-stossel-special-no-they-ca | title=New John Stossel Special: No They Can't! Why Government Fails But Individuals Succeed | publisher=[[Reason Foundation]] | date=April 6, 2012 | accessdate=April 22, 2012 | author=Snell, Lisa}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stossel heavily criticizes [[economic egalitarianism]], stating that an incentive for innovation is a higher income. Many of the statements in the book were later reiterated in episodes of ''[[Stossel (TV series)|Stossel]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://foxnewsinsider.com/2012/04/06/its-a-cant-miss-stossel-no-they-cant-why-government-fails-but-individuals-succeed/ | title=It’s a Can’t-Miss Stossel: ‘No, They Can’t! Why Government Fails But Individuals Succeed’ | publisher=[[News Corporation]] | work=[[Fox News|Fox News Insider]] | date=April 6, 2012 | accessdate=April 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also makes positive statements about free people and markets, including coining the phrase [[the double thank-you of capitalism]].

== Reception ==
''No, They Can't'' entered [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''The New York Times'' Best Seller list]] at number 17 in the April 29, 2012, issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/best-sellers-books/2012-04-29/hardcover-nonfiction/list.html | title=Best Sellers |work=The New York Times | date=April 22, 2012 | agency=[[The New York Times Company]] | accessdate=April 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robert VerBruggen of the ''[[National Review]]'' and ''[[The Washington Times]]'' said that the book was "a perfect gift for a libertarian to give a friend or family member who has liberal instincts, so long as those instincts are accompanied by an open mind."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/apr/9/a-tv-libertarians-manifesto/?page=all | title=Book Review: ‘No, They Can’t’ |work=The Washington Times | date=April 9, 2012 | agency=[[News World Communications]] | accessdate=April 23, 2012 | author=VerBruggen, Robert}}&lt;/ref&gt; A television special was created to accompany the book, first shown on April&amp;nbsp;15, 2012.&lt;ref name="fnews"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.foxnews.com/on-air/fox-news-reporting/2012/04/05/no-they-cant-why-government-fails-individuals-succeed | title=No They Can't!

The '''pharmaceutical lobby''' refers to the representatives of [[pharmaceutical drug]] and [[biomedicine]] companies who engage in [[lobbying]] in favour of the [[pharmaceutical industry]] and its products.

==Political influence in the United States==
The largest pharmaceutical companies and their two trade groups, [[Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America]] (PhRMA) and [[Biotechnology Innovation Organization]], lobbied on at least 1,600 pieces of legislation between 1998 and 2004. According to the non-partisan [[Center for Responsive Politics]], pharmaceutical companies spent $900 million on lobbying between 1998 and 2005, more than any other industry. During the same period, they donated $89.9 million to federal candidates and political parties, giving approximately three times as much to [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] as to [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/11/AR2007011102081.html |title=Drug Bill Demonstrates Lobby's Pull|publisher=|accessdate=29 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Center for Public Integrity]], from January 2005 through June 2006 alone, the pharmaceutical industry spent approximately $182 million on Federal lobbying.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publicintegrity.org/rx/report.aspx?aid=823 Pushing Prescriptions - The Center for Public Integrity&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070703022803/http://www.publicintegrity.org/rx/report.aspx?aid=823 |date=2007-07-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The industry has 1,274 registered lobbyists in Washington D.C. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/health/drugs/2005-04-25-drug-lobby-cover_x.htm|title=USATODAY.com - Drugmakers go furthest to sway Congress|publisher=|accessdate=29 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy in the U.S.==
===Prescription drug costs in the U.S.===
Critics of the pharmaceutical lobby argue that the drug industry's influence allows it to promote legislation friendly to drug manufacturers at the expense of patients.&lt;ref name="NYT-20151127"&gt;{{cite news | title=Turn the Volume Down on Drug Ads | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/27/opinion/turn-the-volume-down-on-drug-ads.html | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=November 27, 2015}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{fv|date=July 2017}} The lobby's influence in securing the passage of the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 was considered a major and controversial victory for the industry, as it prevents the government from directly negotiating prices with drug companies who provide those prescription drugs covered by Medicare. Price negotiations are instead conducted between manufacturers and the pharmacy benefit managers providing Medicare Part D benefits under contract with Medicare.  In 2010 the Congressional Budget Office estimated the average discount negotiated by pharmacy benefit managers at 14%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/ftpdocs/118xx/doc11838/09-15-prescriptiondrugs.pdf |title=www.cbo.gov |format= |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The high price of U.S. prescription drugs has been a source of ongoing controversy. Corporations state that the high costs are the result of pricey research and development programs. Critics point to the development of drugs having only small incremental benefit.&lt;ref name="NYT-20151127" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2004/10/25/041025crat_atlarge|title=High Prices|author=Malcolm Gladwell|date=25 October 2004|work=The New Yorker|accessdate=29 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Marcia Angell, the former head of the New England Journal of Medicine, "The United States is the only advanced country that permits the pharmaceutical industry to charge exactly what the market will bear."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/other/interviews/angell.html|title=Interviews - Marcia Angell - The Other Drug War - FRONTLINE - PBS|publisher=|accessdate=29 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, the [[RAND Corporation]] and authors from the [[National Bureau of Economic Research]] have argued that price controls stifle innovation and are economically counterproductive in the long term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rand.org/pubs/reprints/RP1380.html |title=U.S. Pharmaceutical Policy in a Global Marketplace &amp;#124; RAND |format= |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Rexford E. |last=Santerre |first2=John A. |last2=Vernon |title=Assessing Consumer Gains from a Drug Price Control Policy in the United States |journal=[[Southern Economic Journal]] |year=2006 |volume=73 |issue=1 |pages=233–245 |doi=10.2307/20111885 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Piazza Fontana Bombing''' ({{lang-it|Strage di Piazza Fontana}}) was a  [[terrorism|terrorist]] attack that occurred on 12 December 1969 when a bomb exploded at the headquarters of ''Banca Nazionale dell'Agricoltura'' (National Agrarian Bank) in Piazza Fontana (some 200 metres from the ''[[Milan Cathedral|Duomo]]'') in [[Milan]], [[Italy]], killing 17 people and wounding 88. The same afternoon, three more bombs were detonated in [[Rome]] and Milan, and another was found unexploded.

==Piazza Fontana==
On 25 April 1969 a bomb exploded at the Fiat booth at a Milan trade fair, in which five people were injured. There was also a bomb discovered at the city's central station. The explosion at Piazza Fontana was not the first, but part of a well-coordinated series of attacks.&lt;ref name=bull&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZDexzkoW1twC&amp;pg=PR10&amp;lpg=PR10&amp;dq=piazza+fontana+bombing&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=a3Ca-TKSIF&amp;sig=3Gu6EsXtdFOOD9JwR77mhtbJitA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCMQ6AEwAjgoahUKEwix5_q7-5PJAhVCJR4KHVmOCFs#v=onepage&amp;q=piazza%20fontana%20bombing&amp;f=false  Bull, Anna Cento and Cooke, Philip.

The Piazza Fontana bombing was initially attributed to [[anarchist]]s. After over 80 arrests were made, suspect [[Giuseppe Pinelli]], an anarchist railway worker, died after falling from the fourth floor window of the police station where he was being held.&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{Cite news | title=1969: Deadly bomb blasts in Italy | publisher=[[BBC News]] | date=December 12, 1965 | accessdate=April 2006 | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/december/12/newsid_3953000/3953999.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Serious discrepancies existed in the police account, which initially maintained that Pinelli had committed suicide by leaping from the window during a routine interrogation session. Three police officers interrogating Pinelli, including Commissioner [[Luigi Calabresi]], were put under investigation in 1971 for his death, but a later inquiry filed October 25, 1975 concluded that there were no wrongdoings regarding Pinelli's death: public prosecutor [[Gerardo D'Ambrosio]] established that his fall had been caused by fainting and losing balance.&lt;ref name=bull/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archiviolastampa.it/component/option,com_lastampa/task,search/mod,libera/action,viewer/Itemid,3/page,11/articleid,1109_01_1975_0250_0011_21477257/ "Né omicidio né suicidio: Pinelli cadde perché colto da malore"], ''[[La Stampa]]'', October 29, 1975 {{it icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite being exonerated, the far-left organisation [[Lotta Continua]] held Calabresi of being responsible for the death of Pinelli, and in 1972 he was murdered by left-wing militants in revenge. [[Adriano Sofri]] and Giorgio Pietrostefani, former leaders of Lotta Continua, were convicted of plotting Calabresi's assassination, while members Ovidio Bompressi and Leonardo Marino were sentenced for carrying it out.&lt;ref&gt;"Definitive le condanne per Sofri e gli altri", ''[[Corriere della Sera]]'', January 23, 1997 {{it icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Official investigations and trials ==
[[File:Milano - Piazza Fontana - Lapide Vittime.jpg|thumb|180px|right|Plaque in memory of the 17 victims of the terrorist bombing in Piazza Fontana]]

Anarchist [[Pietro Valpreda]] was also arrested after a taxi driver, called Cornelio Rolandi,&lt;ref&gt;[[Indro Montanelli]] and [[Mario Cervi]], ''L'Italia degli anni di piombo 1965-1978'', Rizzoli, 1991 {{it icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt; identified him as the suspicious-looking client he had taken to the bank that day. After his alibi was judged insufficient, he was held for three years in [[preventive detention]] before being sentenced for the crime. In 1987 he was acquitted by the supreme Court of Cassation for lack of evidence.&lt;ref name=Piazza&gt;[http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/1987/01/28/strage-di-piazza-fontana-azzerati-17-anni.html?ref=search "STRAGE DI PIAZZA FONTANA AZZERATI 17 ANNI DI INDAGINI"], ''[[la Repubblica]]'', January 28, 1987 {{it icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The far-right [[Neo-Fascism|Neo-fascist]] organization ''[[Ordine Nuovo]]'', founded by [[Pino Rauti]], came under suspicion. On 3 March 1972 [[Franco Freda]], Giovanni Ventura and Rauti were arrested and charged with planning the terrorist attacks of 25 April 1969 at the Trade Fair and Railway Station in [[Milan]], and the August 8 and August 9, 1969 bombings of several trains, followed by the Piazza Fontana bombing.

In 1987, after a number of trials, the Court of Cassation ruled that despite evidence linking Freda, Ventura, and others to the Piazza Fortana bombing, it could not be determined for certain who planned it, nor who carried it out.&lt;ref name=bull/&gt; The Court confirmed the convictions of Freda and Ventura in relation to the bombs placed in [[Padua]] and Milan, for which they each received a sentence of 16 years.&lt;ref name=December&gt;[http://www.archiviolastampa.it/component/option,com_lastampa/task,search/mod,libera/action,viewer/Itemid,3/page,3/articleid,1429_02_1981_0078_0003_20236733/ "Quel tragico 12 dicembre 1969 Chi mise la bomba nella banca?"], ''[[La Stampa|Stampa Sera]]'', March 20, 1981 {{it icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 1987 the Milanese Guido Salvini reopened the investigation based on new evidence. Martino Siciliano, a member of ''Ordine Nuovo'', decided to cooperate when presented with a taped telephone conversation between [[Delfo Zorzi]] and some associates which contained the observation that, "the Siciliano problem could be solved with a 9 caliber gun".&lt;ref&gt;Salvini, Guido. ''Sentenza-ordinanza'', 3 February 1998, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; Siciliano said that he had been present at a meeting with Zorzi and Carlo Maria Maggi in April 1969, in the Ezzelino bookstore in Padua owned by Giovanni Ventura, when Freda announced the program of the train bombings. Despite a death threat from Pino Rauti, electrician Tullio Fabris testified that he had supplied Freda with primers and timers.

Carlo Digilio, confessed explosives expert and advisor to the ''Ordine Nuovo'' in the Veneto was convicted in June 2001, which was subsequently upheld on appeal in March 2004.&lt;ref name=cento&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=EUtFAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA33&amp;dq=piazza+fontana+bombing&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAzgKahUKEwjkg-jmkpTJAhUGKiYKHT_MDnM#v=onepage&amp;q=piazza%20fontana%20bombing&amp;f=false Bull, Anna Cento. ''Italian Neofascism'', Berghahn Books, 2012] {{ISBN|9780857454508}}&lt;/ref&gt; Digilio displayed instances of memory loss after suffering a stroke in 1995. His subsequent confusion regarding dates and events led to the Court declaring him an unreliable witness.

In a 2004 trial of neo-fascists the Milan Court of Appeal attributed the Piazza Fontana bombing to Freda and Ventura. However, since they had been acquitted in 1987 they could not be retried.&lt;ref name="Freda"/&gt;

==State security service==
General Gianandelio Maletti, the head of SID (Servizio Informazioni Difesa), and a member of the secret "masonic" society [[Propaganda Due|P2]] was found responsible for obstructing the investigation and withholding information during the first trial in Catanzaro. In an effort to protect extreme right-wing groups, Maletti destroyed a report concerning the Padua cell of ''Ordine Nuovo'' and arranged for potential witnesses to leave the country. Maletti subsequently emigrated to South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Salvini, Guido. ''Sentenza-ordinanza'', 18 March 1995, pp. 312-313&lt;/ref&gt;

Captain Antonio Labruna, of SID, was also implicated in aided and abetting the departure of witnesses Marco Pozzan and Giannettini Guido. Maletti and Labruna were convicted in January 1987.

Several elements brought the investigators to the theory that members of extreme right-wing groups were responsible for the bombings{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}:

* The composition of the bombs used in Piazza Fontana was identical to that of the explosives that Ventura hid in a friend's home a few days after the attacks.
* The bags where the bombs were hidden had been bought a couple of days before the attacks in a shop in Padua, the city where Freda lived.

The Supreme Court rejected as «false» Digilio's «alleged affiliation with US services». The Court found that in 1969 the Venetian group of Zorzi and Maggi organized the attacks, but it is not proven their participation in the massacre of 12 December.
The Court certifies that [[Martino Siciliano]] (another Ordine Nuovo's pentito) attended to the assembly with Zorzi and Maggi in April 1969, in the library Ezzelino of Padua, where Freda announced the program of the train bombings. But since those bombs didn't kill nobody, it's not evidence the involvement of Zorzi and Maggi in the next subversive strategy of Freda and Ventura, and in the other acts of terrorism. The tragic events of 12 December 1969 didn't represent a loose cannon, but were the result of a subversive operation enrolled in a program subversive well settled.&lt;ref name=Freda&gt;"Freda e Ventura erano colpevoli", ''[[Corriere della Sera]]'', June 11, 2005 {{it icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Political theories of responsibility for the bombing ==
The bombing was the work of a right wing group, ''Ordine Nuovo'' whose aim was to prevent the country falling into the hands of the left-wing by duping the public into believing the bombings were part of a communist insurgency.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt;

A 2000 parliamentary report published by the [[The Olive Tree (political coalition)|Olive Tree coalition]] (an alliance of the Communist Party and the Democratic Party of the Left) claimed that "U.S. intelligence agents were informed in advance about several right-wing terrorist bombings, including the December 1969 Piazza Fontana bombing in Milan and the [[Piazza della Loggia bombing]] in Brescia five years later, but did nothing to alert the Italian authorities or to prevent the attacks from taking place." It also alleged that [[Pino Rauti]] (current leader of the [[MSI Fiamma-Tricolore]] party), a journalist and founder of the far-right [[Ordine Nuovo]] (New Order) subversive organization, received regular funding from a press officer at the U.S. embassy in Rome. "So even before the 'stabilising' plans that Atlantic circles had prepared for Italy became operational through the bombings, one of the leading members of the subversive right was literally in the pay of the American embassy in Rome", the report says.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cambridgeclarion.org/press_cuttings/us.terrorism_graun_24jun2000.html US 'supported anti-left terror in Italy'], ''[[The Guardian]]'', June 24, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paolo Emilio Taviani]], the [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Christian Democrat]] co-founder of [[Gladio]] ([[NATO]]'s [[stay-behind]] [[anti-Communist]] organization in Italy),  told investigators that the [[Servizio Informazioni Difesa|SID]] military intelligence service was about to send a senior officer from Rome to Milan to prevent the bombing, but decided to send a different officer from Padua in order to put the blame on left-wing anarchists. In an August 2000 interview with  ''[[Il Secolo XIX]]'' newspaper Taviani said that he did not believe the US Central Intelligence Agency was involved in organising the Milan bomb. However he alleged "It seems to me certain, however, that agents of the CIA were among those who supplied the materials and who muddied the waters of the investigation."&lt;ref name="Obituary"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/obituaries/story/0,,510075,00.html Paolo Emilio Taviani], obituary by [[Philip Willan]], in ''[[The Guardian]]'', 21 June 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pine tar''' is a sticky material produced by the high temperature carbonization of [[pine]] wood in [[Hypoxia (environmental)|anoxic]] conditions (dry distillation or [[destructive distillation]]).  The wood is rapidly [[pyrolysis|decomposed by applying heat]] and pressure in a closed container; the primary resulting products are [[charcoal]] and pine [[tar]].

Pine tar consists primarily of [[aromatic hydrocarbons]], tar acids and tar bases. Components of tar vary according to the [[pyrolysis|pyrolytic]] process (e.g. method, duration, temperature) and origin of the wood (e.g. age of pine trees, type of soil and moisture conditions during tree growth). The choice of wood, design of [[kiln]], burning and collection of the tar can vary. Only pine stumps and roots are used in the traditional production of pine tar.{{cn|date=April 2018}}

Pine tar has a long history as a wood preservative, as a wood sealant for maritime use, in [[roofing construction]] and maintenance, in [[soap]]s and in the treatment of [[carbuncle]]s and [[dermatology|skin diseases]], such as [[psoriasis]], [[eczema]], and [[rosacea]]. One niche application has been in [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) where pine tar is used to enhance the grip of a hitter’s bat. Pine tar is also sometimes used by pitchers to improve their grip on the ball in cold weather.

==History==
Pine tar has long been used in Scandinavian nations as a preservative for wood which may be exposed to harsh conditions, including outdoor furniture and ship decking and rigging.  The high-grade pine tar used in this application is often called '''Stockholm Tar'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | coauthors = | title = Stockholm Tar | work = | publisher = MedicAnimal.com | date = | url = http://www.medicanimal.com/product/~product_id=3072?gclid=CMe1hbPvy7ICFeXMtAodrCIAJg | doi = | accessdate = 23 Sep 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; since, for many years, a single company held a [[royal monopoly]] on its export out of [[Stockholm, Sweden]].&lt;ref name="kayeweb"&gt;{{cite web|title=Pine Tar; History And Uses|author=Theodore P. Kaye|url=http://www.maritime.org/conf/conf-kaye-tar.htm|publisher=San Francisco Maritime Park Association|accessdate=2010-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is also known as "[[Arkhangelsk|Archangel]] Tar".&lt;ref name="EB1911-Tar"&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|title = Tar | encyclopedia = The Encyclopædia Britannica|author=Hugh Chisholm|edition=11|volume = 26|page = 414|year = 1911 | url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopaediabri26chisrich|accessdate = 2010-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Tar and [[Pitch (resin)|pitch]] for maritime use was in such demand that it became an important export for the American colonies, which had extensive pine forests.  North Carolinians became known as "[[Tar Heel]]s."{{cn|date=April 2018}}

==Use==
Pine tar was used as a preservative on the bottoms of traditional Nordic style skis until modern synthetic materials replaced wood in their construction. It also helped waxes adhere, which aided such skis’ grip and glide. 

Pine tar is widely used as a [[veterinary]] care product,&lt;ref name=MerckVet&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wickstrom|first1=Mark|title=Phenols and Related Compounds|url=http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/pharmacology/antiseptics_and_disinfectants/phenols_and_related_compounds.html|website=The Merck Veterinary Manual|publisher=Merck Manuals|accessdate=16 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly as an [[antiseptic]] and [[hoof]] care treatment for horses and cattle.&lt;ref name=MerckVet/&gt; It also has been used when chickens start pecking the [[pecking order|low hen]].&lt;ref name="Bryant"&gt;{{cite web|title=Chickens: A Step-by-Step Guide to Raising and Keeping Hens|author=Laura Bryant|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TSHuHuZ0H9cC&amp;lpg=PT72&amp;dq=pine%20tar%20hen%20pecking&amp;pg=PT72#v=onepage&amp;q=pine%20tar%20hen%20pecking&amp;f=false|publisher=Cedar Fort, Inc.|accessdate=2018-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Applying a smear of pine tar on the wound acts as a natural germicidal/antibacterial and discourages continued attacks on the affected hen due to its foreign texture.&lt;ref name="Bryant"&gt;{{cite web|title=Chickens: A Step-by-Step Guide to Raising and Keeping Hens|author=Laura Bryant|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TSHuHuZ0H9cC&amp;lpg=PT72&amp;dq=pine%20tar%20hen%20pecking&amp;pg=PT72#v=onepage&amp;q=pine%20tar%20hen%20pecking&amp;f=false|publisher=Cedar Fort, Inc.|accessdate=2018-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pine tar is used as a softening solvent in the rubber industry, for treating and fabricating construction materials, and in special paints.

===As a wood preservative===
Pine tar is combined with gum [[turpentine]] and boiled [[linseed oil]] to create a wood preservative. First, a thin coat is applied using a mixture with a greater proportion of turpentine. This allows it to permeate deeper into the [[oakum]] and fibre of the wood and lets the tar seep into any pinholes and larger gaps that might be in the planks. The tar weeps out to the exterior and indicates where the boat needs the most attention. This is followed with a thicker standard mix. Such treatments, while effective, must be continually reapplied.

===Weatherproofing rope===
Traditionally, hemp and other natural fibers were the norm for rope production.  Such rope would quickly rot when exposed to rain, and was typically tarred to preserve it.  The tar would stain the hands of ship's crews, and British Navy seamen became known as "tars."

===In baseball===
[[File:Pine-tar bat.jpg|right|thumb|upright|[[George Brett]]'s pine tar bat at left, from a 2006 exhibit at [[The Henry Ford]] in [[Dearborn, Michigan]]]]

Pine tar is applied to the handles of [[baseball bats]] to improves a batter's grip.

Rule 1.10(c) of the 2002 [[Official rules of Major League Baseball]] restricts application to the lower 18 inches of a bat. The most famous example of the rule being applied is the [[Pine Tar Incident]], which occurred during the July 24, 1983 game between the [[Kansas City Royals]] and [[New York Yankees]].  

Pine tar is also sometimes used by pitchers to improve their grip on the ball in cold weather. This is allowed in spite of a regulation   prohibiting the application of any foreign substance to a ball (except grip-improving [[Baseball Rubbing Mud]] applied by the umpires).[http://mlb.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/mlb/official_info/official_rules/pitcher_8.jsp 8.02]  Nevertheless batters feel it gives a pitcher a competitive advantage.

===Medical===
Pine tar has historically been used for treating skin conditions, usually in soap form. This was banned by the FDA along with many other ingredients due to a lack of proof of their effectiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://pinch.com/skin/docs/fda/FDA-OTC-ingredients-ban |title=Clean-Up of Ineffective Ingredients in OTC Drug Products |publisher=Food and Drug Administration |date=1990-11-07 |author=Bonnie Aikman |accessdate=2014-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source needed|date=April 2018}}

Some pine tar products contain [[creosote]], a probable [[carcinogen]]. Creosote potentially may be produced when the pine wood is heated up to high temperatures in the creation of pine tar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite study|url=https://circabc.europa.eu/webdav/CircaBC/SANTE/BPR%20-%20Public/Library/Review%20programme/Essential%20use/pine_tar_request/comments_220706/Essential_use_appl_pine_tar_IS.doc | title=ESSENTIAL USE APPLICATION FORM FOR BIOCIDES |publisher=EUROPEAN COMMISSION ENVIRONMENT DIRECTORATE-GENERAL}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pine tar is also used in veterinary medicine as an expectorant and an antiseptic in chronic skin conditions.{{r|Merck}}

==Background==

In January 1942, paranoia among white Canadians on the west coast had reached its peak. On February 24, 1942, an order-in-council passed under the ''[[Defence of Canada Regulations]]'' made under the ''[[War Measures Act]]'' gave the federal government the power to intern all "persons of Japanese racial origin."&lt;ref name = "daisies"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3680/is_200401/ai_n9235669 Wild Daisies in the Sand: Life in a Canadian Internment Camp], Tsuneharu Gonnami, Pacific Affairs,  Winter 2003/2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly 21,000 people of Japanese descent were placed in these camps.

In December 1945, the federal Cabinet issued three Orders in Council:

:* #7355 provided for the deportation of:
::* all Japanese nationals who were not Canadian nationals,&lt;ref&gt; as defined under the ''Canadian Nationals Act, 1921'', S.C. 1921, c. 4 (see [[History of Canadian nationality law]] for a detailed definition of the term)&lt;/ref&gt; who
:::* after the declaration of war with Japan had made a request for repatriation, or
:::* who were still detained under the ''[[Defence of Canada Regulations]]'' on 1 September 1945,
::* naturalized British subjects of Japanese origin who requested such a move, and who had not revoked such a request in writing prior to 1 September 1945,
::* natural born British subjects of Japanese origin who requested such a move (provided such request had not been revoked in writing prior to an order for deportation), plus
::* wives and children of those involved.
:* #7356 provided that naturalized British subjects who were so deported would lose that status.
:* #7357 provided for inquiries to be held with respect to requests for repatriation.

After the war, these Orders in Council that authorized the deportation were challenged on the basis that the forced deportation of the Japanese was a [[crime against humanity]] and that a citizen could not be deported from their own country. The federal [[Cabinet of Canada|Cabinet]] posed the following [[reference question]] to the [[Supreme Court of Canada]]:

{{centered pull quote|
Are the Orders in Council dated the 15th day of December, 1945, being P.C. 7355, 7356 and 7357, ''[[ultra vires]]'' of the Governor in Council either in whole or in part and, if so, in what particular or particulars and to what extent?
}}

The matter was heard by the Supreme Court in the first case heard in the newly constructed building housing the Court.

==At the Supreme Court==

The SCC rendered a mixed ruling:

:* the Court was unanimous as to the validity of deportations of Japanese nationals and naturalized British subjects
:* In a 5-2 decision, the Court held that the validity of deportations was valid with respect to natural born British subjects
:* In a 4-3 decision, they ruled that the provision relating to the deportation of wives and children was ''ultra vires'', with [[Ivan Rand|Rand]] J, for the majority, specifying that deportation in relation to wives and children who did not fall within the classes of Japanese nationals and naturalized British subjects under the order was ''ultra vires''
:* In a 5-2 decision, the other two Orders in Council were declared ''intra vires''

Three justices (Rand, Kellock and Estey JJ) stated that the Orders in Council continued to have effect after the ''War Measures Act'' ceased to be in force on 1 January 1946, by virtue of the ''National Emergency Transitional Powers Act, 1946''.

Rinfret CJ and Kerwin and Taschereau JJ, being the only three justices to uphold the validity of all three Orders in Council in their entirety, held that they were lawful because such orders arising from the ''[[War Measures Act]]'' are legislative in nature {{emdash}} equivalent to an Act of Parliament {{emdash}} in line with previous jurisprudence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CanLII|litigants=Reference as to the Validity of the Regulations in Relation to Chemicals Enacted by Order in Council and of an Order of the Controller of Chemicals Made Pursuant Thereto (The "Chemicals Reference")|link=|year=1943|court=scc|num=1|format=canlii|pinpoint=|parallelcite=[1943] SCR 1|date=1943-01-05|courtname=auto|juris=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==At the Privy Council==

The case was appealed to the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]], which declared that all three Orders in Council were ''intra vires'', for the reasons given at the SCC by Rinfret CJ and Kerwin and Taschereau JJ.

==Aftermath==
{{See also|Japanese Canadian internment}}

In 1946, 3,965 people were repatriated to Japan. 

In 1947, due to various protests among politicians and academics, the Federal Cabinet revoked the legislation to repatriate the remaining Japanese Canadians to Japan. It was only in April 1949 that all restrictions were lifted from Japanese Canadians. However, former Canadian citizens of Japanese ancestry now living in Japan were denied passports.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.japanesecanadianhistory.ca/Chapter7.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The Canadian government also launched a [[Royal Commission]] (led by Justice Henry Bird) in 1947 to examine the issue of compensation for confiscated property. By 1950, the Bird Commission awarded $1.3 million in claims to 1,434 Japanese Canadians; however, it accepted only claims based on loss of property, refusing to compensate for wrongdoing in terms of [[civil rights]], damages due to loss of earnings, disruption of education or other issues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/history/EPISCONTENTSE1EP14CH3PA3LE.html Japanese Internment - CBC]&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 22, 1988, Prime Minister [[Brian Mulroney]]  gave a formal apology and the Canadian government announced a compensation package, one month after President [[Ronald Reagan]] made similar gestures in the United States. The package for interned Japanese Canadians included $21,000 to each surviving internee, and the reinstatement of Canadian citizenship to those who were deported to Japan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.cbc.ca/IDC-1-71-568-2924/conflict_war/internment/clip9 Apology and compensation], CBC Archives&lt;/ref&gt; The agreement also awarded $12 million to the NAJC to promote human rights and support the community, and $24 million for the establishment of the [[Canadian Race Relations Foundation]] to push for the elimination of racism.  Nothing was given for those that had been interned and died before compensation was given out.

'''Skapti Þóroddsson''' (died 1030) was an Icelandic [[lawspeaker]] and [[skald]]. He became lawspeaker in 1004, succeeding his uncle Grímr when the latter's voice failed him. He held office till his death in 1030, longer than anyone else. According to ''[[Íslendingabók]]'' he instituted judicial reform by establishing the "fifth court", a national court of appeals.

According to ''[[Skáldatal]]'', Skapti was a court poet of [[Hákon Sigurðarson]] but no details on that career are known. According to [[Heimskringla]], he composed a poem on king [[Olaf II of Norway|Óláfr Haraldsson]] and sent his son Steinn to perform it for the king.

The only piece of poetry by Skapti which has come down to us is decidedly Christian and can not have been composed at Hákon's court. [[Snorri Sturluson]] cites the following half-stanza by Skapti in a discussion of Christian [[kenning]]s in ''[[Skáldskaparmál]]''.

Skapti is mentioned in some of the [[Icelanders' sagas]], for example ''[[Njáls saga]]'' where he has a minor role.

A '''surveillance aircraft''' is an [[aircraft]] used for [[surveillance]]—collecting information over time.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}} They are operated by military forces and other government agencies in roles such as [[List of intelligence gathering disciplines|intelligence gathering]], [[Airborne ground surveillance|battlefield surveillance]], [[Airborne early warning and control|airspace surveillance]], [[Air Observation Post|observation]] (e.g. [[Artillery observer|artillery spotting]]), [[border guard|border patrol]] and [[fishery]] protection. This article concentrates on aircraft used in those roles, rather than for traffic monitoring, law enforcement and similar activities.

Surveillance aircraft usually carry no armament, or only limited defensive armament. A surveillance aircraft does not necessarily require high-performance capability or [[Stealth aircraft|stealth]] characteristics. It may be a modified civilian aircraft. Surveillance aircraft have also included [[moored balloon]]s (e.g. [[Tethered Aerostat Radar System|TARS]]) and [[unmanned aerial vehicle]]s (UAVs).

The terms “surveillance” and “reconnaissance” have sometimes been used interchangeably, but, in the military context, a distinction can be drawn between surveillance, which monitors a changing situation in real time, and [[reconnaissance]], which captures a static picture for analysis.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

Surveillance is sometimes grouped with [[Intelligence gathering|Intelligence]], [[Target acquisition]] and [[Reconnaissance]] under the title [[ISTAR]].

Observation was the term used for surveillance when the main sensor was the human eye.

[[Image:Early flight 02562u (9).jpg|thumb|right|The first surveillance balloon, ''"l'Entreprenant"'', 1794. Illustration from the late 19th Century.]]
{{Main|History of military ballooning}}
In 1794, during the [[Battle of Fleurus (1794)|Battle of Fleurus]], the [[French Aerostatic Corps]] balloon ''L'Entreprenant'' remained afloat for nine hours.  French officers used the balloon to observe the movements of the Austrian Army, dropping notes to the ground for collection by the French Army,&lt;ref name="haydon"&gt;F. Stansbury Haydon, ''Military Ballooning During the Early Civil War'', pp. 5–15.&lt;/ref&gt; and also signalled messages using [[semaphore]].&lt;ref name="coulston"&gt;Charles Coulston Gillispie, ''Science and Polity in France: The Revolutionary and Napoleonic Years'', pp. 372–373.&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War I===
One of the first aircraft used for surveillance was the [[Rumpler Taube]] during [[World War I]], when aviators like [[Fred Zinn]] evolved entirely new methods of reconnaissance and photography.  The translucent wings of the plane made it very difficult for ground-based observers to detect a Taube at an altitude above 400 m.  The French also called this plane "the Invisible Aircraft", and it is sometimes also referred to as the "world's very first stealth plane".  German Taube aircraft were able to detect the advancing Russian army during the [[Battle of Tannenberg (1914)|Battle of Tannenberg]] (1914).

===World War II===
During [[World War II]], [[light aircraft]] such as the [[Taylorcraft Auster|Auster]] were used as air [[observation post]]s.  Officers from the British [[Royal Artillery]] were trained as pilots to fly [[Air Observation Post|AOP]] aircraft for [[artillery spotting]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.warplane.com/pages/aircraft_beagle.html Canadian Warplane Heritage: Auster Beagle AOP]&lt;/ref&gt;
The air observation role was generally taken over by light [[observation helicopter]]s, such as the [[Hughes OH-6 Cayuse]], from the mid-1960s.

Pre war, the British identified a need for an aircraft that could follow and observe the enemy fleet at a distance. To this end the slow-flying [[Airspeed Fleet Shadower]] and [[General Aircraft Fleet Shadower]] designs were built and flown in 1940 but they were made obsolete by the introduction of airborne radar.

===Cold War===
Spy flights were a source of major contention between the US and [[Soviet Union]] during most of the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Reds, U.S. Face Hot Plane Debate at U.N. | work=The Paris News | date=May 23, 1960 | agency=Associated Press  | location=Paris, Texas (US) | pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Roles==

===Maritime patrol===

{{Main|Maritime patrol aircraft}}

[[Maritime patrol aircraft]] are typically large, slow machines capable of flying continuously for many hours, with a wide range of sensors. Such aircraft include the [[Hawker-Siddeley Nimrod]], the [[Breguet Atlantique]], the [[Tupolev Tu-95]], the [[Lockheed P-2 Neptune]] and the [[Lockheed P-3 Orion]]/[[Lockheed CP-140 Aurora|CP-140 Aurora]].

===Law enforcement===

'''''The Harvest''''' ({{lang-es|La Cosecha}}) is a 2010 [[documentary film]] about [[Agriculture|agricultural]] [[child labour|child labor]] in [[United States|America]]. The film depicts children as young as 12 years of age who work as many as 12 hours a day, six months a year, subject to hazardous conditions: [[Hyperthermia|heat exposure]], [[pesticide]]s, and dangerous work.  The agriculture industry has been subject to significantly more lenient [[labour law|labor laws]] than any other occupation in the [[United States]].  As a result, lack of consistent schooling significantly limits their opportunities of succeeding in high school or more.  The hazardous conditions threaten their health and lives.  The purpose of the documentary is to bring awareness of the harsh working conditions which tens of thousands of children face in the fields of the United States each year and to enact the [[Children's Act for Responsible Employment (CARE Act)|Children's Act for Responsible Employment (CARE Act, HR 3564)]] which will bring parity of labor conditions to field workers that are afforded to minors in other occupations.

==Background==
The [[Fair Labor Standards Act]] (FLSA) has different standards for children working in [[agriculture]] than in any other industry.  The Association of Farmworker Opportunity Programs estimates that there are between 400,000 and 500,000 children working in the farming industry.  Children as young as 12 years of age work in the fields.  There is no minimum number of hours worked a day, aside from being outside school hours.  They are exposed to the sun, harmful [[pesticide]]s and hazardous conditions.  Children are in up to three times greater danger of exposure to pesticides than adults due to their size and stage of development.  The fatality rate is six times that in any other industry: children account for 20% of all deaths on farms.  Although agriculture is a hazardous occupation, no statistics are maintained on child laborers and serious accidents.&lt;ref name=AFOP&gt;{{cite web |url=http://afop.org/children-in-the-fields/learn-the-facts/ |title=Learn the Facts |year=2011 |work=Children in the Fields |publisher=Association of Farmworker Opportunity Programs |accessdate=2011-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Children who work on farms or in fields spend on average 30 hours a week, even during times of the year when school is in session.  Of the children who work on farms, 50% of them will not graduate from high school.&lt;ref name=AFOP/&gt;  The [[United States Department of Labor]] estimates that children earn about $1,000 in one year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://afop.org/about/2011-year-of-the-farmworker-child/ |title=2011 Year of the Farmworker Child |year=2011 |work=Children in the Fields |publisher=Association of Farmworker Opportunity Programs |accessdate=2011-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
''The Harvest'' is a feature [[documentary film]] on the life of [[Migrant worker|migrant]] children and their families in the [[United States]].  It revisits [[Edward R. Murrow]]’s ''[[Harvest of Shame]]'', filmed 53 years ago, and reveals that little has changed over the past five decades in the lives of migrant farm workers in the United States. ''The Harvest'', however, is told from a child's perspective as it presents four of the more than 400,000 children between the ages of 5 and 16 who labor in fields and factories, lacking the protections offered by the Fair Labor Standards Act that all other American children enjoy.&lt;ref name="Shine Global Inc."&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.shineglobal.org/?page_id=19 | title=The Harvest/La Cosecha, The Story of the Children Who Feed America | publisher=Shine Global | year=2010 | accessdate=2011-05-27 |archivedate=2011-01-04|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110104234610/http://www.shineglobal.org/index.php/hero-of-the-week/harvest/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film profiles several children and their families as they work through the 2009 - 2010 harvest seasons, facing  risks of being separated, deported or death.  A twelve-year-old girl, Zulema L., works in a field of strawberries. One of her earliest memories is being taught by her mother to pick and clean strawberries.  Zulema struggles academically because of the family's seasonal movement. She has attended eight different schools in eight years. Not confident that she will make it to high school, she has no dreams about what her future could hold.  The documentary tracks other children with their own stories of living a life of a [[child labour|child laborer]].&lt;ref name="Shine Global Inc."/&gt;

Work began on the documentary in June 2007 and through the 2009 - 2010 harvests.  In that time the project has followed harvests in [[Minnesota]], [[North Dakota]], [[Texas]], [[Florida]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[North Carolina]] and [[Ohio]]. The documentary was shot with cinematic scope. Post-production began in early winter 2010, with the completion of the film in fall 2010.&lt;ref name="Shine Global Inc."/&gt;

''The Harvest'' was produced by [[Shine Global]] in association with Globalvision, Romano Film and Photography, and [[Eva Longoria]]'s UnbeliEVAble Productions.  Longoria signed on as an executive producer of the project in 2009.&lt;ref name="broadcastingcable.com"&gt;{{ cite web | url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/189904-Eva_Longoria_Parker_to_Executive_Produce_Child_Farm_Worker_Documentary.php | title=Eva Longoria Parker to Executive Produce Child Farm Worker Documentary | author=Tanklefsky, D | date=Mar 13, 2009  | publisher=Bay Media, LLC | accessdate=2011-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was directed by [[Robin Romano|U. Roberto (Robin) Romano]], photographer of ''[[Faces of Freedom]]''.

===Screenings===
''The Harvest'' premiered at the International Documentary Film Festival [[International Documentary Film Festival Amsterdam|IDFA]] in [[Amsterdam]] in November 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.idfa.nl/industry/tags/project.aspx?id=e1433bf7-c2fa-4160-806d-b169fdce01aa |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101126211653/http://www.idfa.nl/industry/tags/project.aspx?id=E1433BF7-C2FA-4160-806D-B169FDCE01AA |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2010-11-26 |title=The Harvest |work=IDFA 2010 |publisher=IDFA |accessdate=2011-05-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and at the [[Guadalajara International Film Festival]] in Guadalajara, Mexico on March 26, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/entertainment/2011/03/28/eva-longoria-debuts-harvest-documentary-guadalajara-international-film-festival/ |title=Eva Longoria Debuts "The Harvest" at Guadalajara International Film Festival |author=EFE |date=March 28, 2011 |work=Entertainment |publisher=Fox News Latino |accessdate=2011-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Distributed by Cinema Libre, The film had its theatrical debut in [[New York City]] on July 29, 2011,&lt;ref name=Slant&gt;{{cite news|last=Henely|first=Kalvin|title=The Harvest/La Cosecha|url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/film/review/the-harvest-la-cosecha/5655|accessdate=July 26, 2013|newspaper=[[Slant Magazine]]|date=July 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and became available on DVD October 2011.&lt;ref name="Film Monthly"&gt;{{cite news|last=Engel|first=D.M.|title=The Harvest/La Cosecha(2011)|url=http://www.filmmonthly.com/video_and_dvd/the_harvestla_cosecha.html|accessdate=July 26, 2013|newspaper=Film Monthly|date=October 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==CARE legislation==
[[Eva Longoria]], director [[U. Roberto Romano]], and associate director Julia Perez visited [[Capitol Hill]] to mark the anniversary of [[Members of Congress|Representative]] [[Lucille Roybal-Allard|Lucille Roybal-Allard’s]] introduction of the CARE Act [[legislation]] in September 2009.  The [[Children's Act for Responsible Employment (CARE Act)|Children’s Act for Responsible Employment (CARE Act, HR 3564)]] addresses the harshest conditions that tens of thousands of children as young as 12 years of age may be subject to, such as restrictions in the number of hours that children work in a day.  The intention of the [[bill (proposed law)|bill]] is to raise the standard for children working in agriculture to that of any other occupation in the United States.  As of September 1, 2010 the bill had 103 [[Sponsor (legislative)|co-sponsors]].  While on Capitol Hill, Longoria and Romano showed scenes from the feature-length documentary to illustrate the harsh working conditions and exploitation of children in the fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://roybal-allard.house.gov/News/DocumentSingle.aspx?DocumentID=206669 |title=Congresswoman Lucille Roybal-Allard, Press Release |date=Sep 15, 2010 |publisher=Offices of Congresswoman Lucille Roybal-Allard |accessdate=2011-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A trailer of the film was first privately screened at a [[United States Department of Labor]] panel discussion, hosted by [[United States Secretary of Labor|Secretary of Labor]] [[Hilda Solis]] and including [[Dolores Huerta]] of the [[United Farm Workers]], filmmaker Robin Romano, Mark Lara from the Department of Labor's [[Wage and Hour Division]], and other experts.  During the presentation, details of Roybal-Allard's bill were outlined: a child must be a [[Minimum Age Convention, 1973|minimum]] of 14 years of age to work in the fields, children under the age of 16 are restricted from working in the fields if it affects their health or school performance, and children under the age of 18 are restricted from hazardous work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dol.gov/dol/media/webcast/20090916-harvest/index.htm |title=Department of Labor, Panel Discussion About Migrant Farm Worker Children |date=September 16, 2009 |work=Newsroom, Audio and Video, Better Work Program |publisher=U.S. Department of Labor |accessdate=2011-05-27 |postscript='  See the video of the DOL panel discussion for more information and a trailer |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110115140422/http://www.dol.gov/dol/media/webcast/20090916-harvest/index.htm |archivedate=January 15, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United Nations ==

On August 12 of 2014, the film's Associate Director, Julia Perez, spoke before the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination on behalf of farm worker rights and child labor in U.S. agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=14940&amp;LangID=E|title=Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination discusses situation in United States with non-governmental organizations|publisher=United Nations|date=2014-08-12|accessdate=2018-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UN press release mentioned exposure to pesticides, wage theft, sexual assault, police harassment and other illegal working conditions faced by children &amp;mdash; largely Latino children who either were born in the United States or migrated with their families.

[[File:Tseghakron Coat Of Arms.JPG|thumb|right|250px|The [[Eagle of Taron]] as a symbol of Tseghakronism]]
'''Tseghakronism''' ({{lang-hy|Ցեղակրոնություն}} [[Romanization of Armenian|translit.]] ''{{transl|hy|Tseghakronutyun}}'') is a national/ethnic and political movement towards a renewal of the spiritual, behavioral and cultural identity of the [[Armenian people]].  
"Tseghakron" literally means "carrier of race " referring to those who represent and carry what is the spiritual and biological essence of the "classical" Armenian. However, it is often erroneously interpreted to mean "race-religion".

The movement was founded by [[Garegin Nzhdeh]], and his associates [[Hayk Asatryan]] and Nerses Astvatsaturyan later refined it as the ideology of Taronism (Տարոնականություն) - an organic part and continuation of Tseghakronism.

'''Twitter diplomacy''', also "'''Twiplomacy'''" or "'''hashtag diplomacy'''", is the use of social network and microblogging website, [[Twitter]], by [[Head of state|heads of state]], leaders of [[Intergovernmental organization|intergovernmental organizations (IGOs)]], and their [[diplomat]]s to conduct [[Diplomacy|diplomatic]] outreach and [[public diplomacy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Keleman|first=Michele|title=Twitter Diplomacy: State Department 2.0|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/alltechconsidered/2012/02/21/147207004/twitter-diplomacy-state-department-2-0|accessdate=28 April 2014|newspaper=National Public Radio|date=21 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Twitter has taken on diverse and occasional roles in diplomatic communications, from cordial announcements of bi-lateral cooperation to terse exchanges and diplomatic jabs, as well as more casual posts.&lt;ref name="nyt-scripted"&gt;{{Cite news

== Origins ==
The term '''twitplomacy''' was proposed in 2011, in a pioneer{{Peacock term|date=February 2017}} work focused on the study of diplomacy within the social networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Treeintelligence|title=Twitplomacy|url=http://www.slideshare.net/treebranding/twitter-diplomacy-tree-branding|accessdate=17 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better|date=February 2017}} This report purports to show how presidents use Twitter to keep diplomatic relationships with other presidents and political actors. However, the use of Twitter by world leaders and diplomats was on the rise as of April 2014{{cn|date=February 2017}}, but Twitter diplomacy was only one aspect of the growing trend{{cn|date=February 2017}} toward [[digital diplomacy]], also known as eDiplomacy or [[Facebook diplomacy]], by many world governments.{{or|date=February 2017}}

=== Twitter and diplomacy ===

As of April 2014, an estimated 241 million active users had joined Twitter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Twitter|title=About Twitter, Inc.|url=https://about.twitter.com/company|accessdate=26 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twitter also offers policymakers the possibility to hear the many perspectives of a worldwide audience.{{promotion-inline|date=February 2017}}

World leaders and their diplomats have taken note of Twitter's rapid expansion and have begun using it to engage with foreign publics and their own citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://blog.oup.com/2017/10/twitter-diplomacy-practices-foreign-policy/|title=How Twitter enhances conventional practices of diplomacy {{!}} OUPblog|date=2017-10-05|work=OUPblog|access-date=2018-01-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; US Ambassador to Russia, [[Michael A. McFaul]] has been attributed {{by whom|date=February 2017}} as a pioneer of international Twitter diplomacy. He used Twitter after becoming ambassador in 2011, posting in English and Russian.&lt;ref name="nyt-scripted" /&gt; A 2013 study by website Twiplomacy found that 153 of the 193 countries represented at the [[United Nations]] had established government Twitter accounts.&lt;ref name=twiplomacy&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Twiplomacy.com|title=Twiplomacy Study 2013 – International Organisations|url=http://twiplomacy.com/blog/twiplomacy-study-2013/|accessdate=27 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The same study also found that those accounts amounted to 505 Twitter handles used by world leaders and their foreign ministers, with their tweets able to reach a combined audience of over 106 million followers.&lt;ref name=twiplomacy /&gt;

Commenting in a 2013 publication on the subject for the Geneva-based, non-profit Diplo, former Italian Foreign Minister [[Giulio Terzi di Sant'Agata|Giulio Terzi]] said of social media, "Social media exposes foreign policymakers to global audiences while at the same time allowing governments to reach them instantly... Twitter has two big positive effects on foreign policy: it fosters a beneficial exchange of ideas between policymakers and civil society and enhances diplomats' ability to gather information and to anticipate, analyze, manage, and react to events."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=DiploFoundation|title=Twitter for Diplomats|url=http://issuu.com/diplo/docs/twitter_for_diplomats|accessdate=26 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Controversy ===

Confrontations via Twitter diplomacy are visible to a worldwide audience because of Twitter's global nature.{{synthesis-inline|date=February 2017}}

In April 2014, tensions between the US State Department and the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Russia)|Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] over the [[2014 Crimean crisis]] devolved into dueling tweets{{tone-inline|date=February 2017}}, with both ministries using the hashtag #UnitedforUkraine to convey opposite points of view.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ishaan|first=Tharoor|title=Russia hijacks U.S. State Department’s Ukraine hashtag|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2014/04/25/russia-hijacks-u-s-state-departments-ukraine-hashtag/|publisher=Washington Post|accessdate=27 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Foxnews.com|title=Obama's hashtag diplomacy with Russia sparks new criticism about weak foreign policy|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2014/04/26/obama-hashtag-diplomacy-with-russia-sparks-new-criticism-about-weak-foreign/|accessdate=28 April 2014|newspaper=Fox News|date=26 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tweeting to a global audience also poses challenges to leaders and diplomats.  In early 2014, Iranian President [[Hassan Rouhani]] decided to delete a controversial tweet that received much media attention, though it was likely intended for his domestic audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Loguirato|first=Brett|title=Iran's President Deleted A Controversial Tweet|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/hassan-rouhani-deletes-tweet-nuclear-deal-surrender-2014-1|publisher=Business Insider|accessdate=27 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Use by governments and intergovernmental organizations ==

Twiplomacy's 2013 study provided new insight into the use of Twitter by governments.  Twitter registration by region includes:&lt;ref name=twiplomacy /&gt;
* Africa: 71% of governments
* Asia:  75% of governments
* Europe: 100% of governments&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Tutt, A. (2013), E-Diplomacy Capacities within the EU-27: Small States and Social Media|url = http://www.grin.com/en/e-book/274032/e-diplomacy-capacities-within-the-eu-27-small-states-and-social-media|website = www.grin.com|accessdate = 2015-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* North America: 18 governments
* Oceania: 38% of governments
* South America: 92% of governments

=== By heads of state and government ===

Former US President [[Barack Obama]] is credited as being the first head of state to establish a Twitter account, originally affiliated with his [[Barack Obama presidential campaign, 2008|2008 presidential campaign]], on March 5, 2007 as user number 813,286.&lt;ref name=twiplomacy /&gt;  He was also the most followed head of state on Twitter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Miles|first=Tom|title=@tweeter-in-chief? Obama's outsourced tweets top twitocracy|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/07/26/us-twitter-obama-idUSBRE86P0AQ20120726|accessdate=28 April 2014|newspaper=Reuters|date=26 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other heads of state and government to pioneer the conduct of Twitter diplomacy include Mexican president [[Enrique Peña Nieto]], Belgian Prime Minister [[Elio Di Rupo]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Tutt, A. (2013), E-Diplomacy Capacities within the EU-27: Small States and Social Media|url = http://www.grin.com/en/e-book/274032/e-diplomacy-capacities-within-the-eu-27-small-states-and-social-media|website = www.grin.com|accessdate = 2015-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Canadian Prime Minister [[Stephen Harper]], all of whom joined Twitter in 2007.

Since his election in November 2016, US President [[Donald Trump]] has been actively [[Donald Trump on social media|engaged in]] Twitter diplomacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McCaskill|first1=Nolan|title=Clinton slams Trump's Twitter diplomacy: 'That doesn’t work'|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2017/05/02/hillary-clinton-mocks-trump-twitter-diplomacy-237884|accessdate=11 August 2017|work=[[Politico]]|date=2 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Rebecca Kheel|author2=Ellen Mitchell|title=Trump’s diplomacy-by-Twitter sets off firestorm|url=http://thehill.com/policy/defense/336659-trumps-diplomacy-by-twitter-sets-off-firestorm|accessdate=11 August 2017|work=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]|date=6 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Apps|first1=Peter|title=Commentary: Trump’s brave new world of Twitter diplomacy|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apps-twitter-commentary-idUSKBN13U2VX|accessdate=11 August 2017|work=[[Reuters]]|issue=6 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Romero|first1=Luis Gomez|title=Twitter diplomacy: how Trump is using social media to spur a crisis with Mexico|url=https://theconversation.com/twitter-diplomacy-how-trump-is-using-social-media-to-spur-a-crisis-with-mexico-71981|accessdate=11 August 2017|work=[[The Conversation]]|date=27 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 11, 2017, for example, Trump tweeted, "Military solutions are now fully in place,locked and loaded, should [[North Korea]] act unwisely. Hopefully [[Kim Jong Un]] will find another path!"{{sic}}&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/895970429734711298&lt;/ref&gt;

=== By leaders of intergovernmental organizations ===

As of April 2014, the United Nations (UN) is the most followed intergovernmental organization,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Twiplomacy|title=Twiplomacy 2013 - How International Organizations Tweet|url=http://twiplomacy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Twiplomacy_organisations.pdf|accessdate=28 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  with its website showing over 2.56 million viewers in April 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=United Nations (UN) on Twitter|url=https://twitter.com/UN}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many of the UN's subordinate funds and agencies also attract large numbers of followers.  The [[United Nations Children's Fund]] achieved greater popularity than its parent organization, the UN, and is followed by over 2.69 million as of April 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UNICEF (UNICEF) on Twitter|url=https://twitter.com/UNICEF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== By diplomats and diplomatic missions ===

Former Israeli ambassador to the United States, [[Michael Oren]], echoed the sentiment of many diplomats when responding to a May 2012 question about why he joined Twitter: "Today there are few alternatives as far-reachng and effective, with very wide audiences and young audiences, as Twitter. Twitter is another tool that enables me to communicate with other diplomats and journalists, while also allowing me to add a personal touch."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tracy|first=Marc|title=Israeli Ambassador Michael Oren Talks About Why He Joined Twitter|url=http://www.tabletmag.com/scroll/101023/ambassadororen-on-why-he-joined-twitter|publisher=The Tablet|accessdate=27 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Foreign ministries have caught on, and some are making efforts to advertise their presence on Twitter.  The [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office|UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office]], for example, published a consolidated [https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/foreign-commonwealth-office/about/social-media-use list] of all UK missions on social media.

The United States State Department, one of the leaders in digital diplomacy, maintains an active presence on Twitter.  Although former [[United States Secretary of State]] [[Hillary Clinton]] encouraged American diplomats to tweet, she did not establish her personal handle until 2013, after she had already left office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Thomas|first=Ken|title=Hillary Clinton starts Tweeting|url=http://www.myfoxny.com/story/22551202/hillary-clinton-joins-twitter|accessdate=28 April 2014|newspaper=AP|date=2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140429045917/http://www.myfoxny.com/story/22551202/hillary-clinton-joins-twitter|archivedate=29 April 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Current Secretary [[John Kerry]] re-activated his personal Twitter handle after one year on the job.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gearan|first=Anne|title=John Kerry unleashed on Twitter once again|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2014/02/04/john-kerry-unleashed-on-twitter-once-again/|accessdate=28 April 2014|newspaper=Washington Post|date=4 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Former US ambassador to the Russian Federation, [[Michael McFaul]], pioneered the use of Twitter for American ambassadors with a steady stream of English/Russian tweets during his 2011–2014 tenure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Elder|first=Miriam|title=Michael McFaul, US ambassador to Moscow, victim of Kremlin 'Twitter war'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/may/29/michael-mcfaul-twitter-attack-russia|accessdate=28 April 2014|newspaper=Guardian|date=29 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lally"&gt;{{cite news|last=Lally|first=Kathy|title=U.S. ambassador in Moscow uses social media to bypass official line|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/moscow-ambassador-tweets-us-policy/2014/01/11/ac1fefea-7568-11e3-8b3f-b1666705ca3b_story.html|accessdate=28 April 2014|newspaper=Washington Post|date=11 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An academic by trade and not a career diplomat, Ambassador McFaul's tweets were generally blunt and un-polished—uncommon characteristics in the diplomatic world—earning both frequent criticism from the Russian government and praise from his supporters.&lt;ref name="Lally"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8559">{{Ecological economics|Concepts}}
'''Uneconomic growth''', in [[human development theory]], [[welfare economics]] (the economics of social welfare), and some forms of [[ecological economics]], is [[economic growth]] that reflects or creates a decline in the [[quality of life]]. The concept is attributed to leading [[Ecological economics|ecological economist]] and [[Steady-state economy#Herman Daly's concept of a steady-state economy|steady-state theorist]] '''[[Herman Daly]]''', though other theorists can also be credited for the incipient idea.&lt;ref&gt;Daly, H. 2007. Ecological economics: the concept of scale and its relation to allocation, distribution, and uneconomic growth. Pp. 82-103 in H. Daly. ''Ecological Economics and Sustainable Development: Selected Essays of Herman Daly''. Cheltenham, UK: Edward Elgar.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Daly, H. 1999. Uneconomic growth and the built environment: in theory and in fact. In C.J. Kibert (ed.). ''Reshaping the Built Environment: Ecology, Ethics, and Economics''. Washington DC: Island Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Note Uneconomic growth (or uneconomic degrowth) should not be confused with [[economic degrowth]], the reduction of the size of the economy to increase well-being and sustainability.&lt;ref&gt;http://events.it-sudparis.eu/degrowthconference/en/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Uneconomic Growth diagram.jpg|thumb|The marginal costs of a growing economy may gradually exceed the marginal benefits, however measured.]]
The cost, or decline in well-being, associated with extended economic growth is argued to arise as a result of "the social and environmental sacrifices made necessary by that growing encroachment on the eco-system."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Daly | first=H. | title=Uneconomic growth in theory and in fact. The First Annual Feasta Lecture | location=Trinity College, Dublin | work=Feasta Review | date=26 April 1999 | url=http://www.feasta.org/documents/feastareview/daly.htm | accessdate=7 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Daly, H. and Farley, J. 2004. ''Ecological Economics: Principles and Applications''. Washington: Island Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, "[u]neconomic growth occurs when increases in production come at an expense in resources and well-being that is worth more than the items made."&lt;ref&gt;Daly, H. 2005. Economics in a full world. ''Scientific American'' 293(3): 100-107.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of growth==
The rate or type of economic growth may have important consequences for the environment (the [[climate]] and [[natural capital]] of ecologies).  Concerns about possible negative effects of growth on the environment and society led some to advocate lower levels of growth, from which comes the idea of uneconomic growth, and [[Green parties]] which argue that economies are part of a global society and a global ecology and cannot outstrip their natural growth without damaging them.

[[Canadians|Canadian]] [[scientist]] [[David Suzuki]] argued in the 1990s that ecologies can only sustain typically about 1.5&amp;ndash;3% new growth per year, and thus any requirement for greater returns from [[agriculture]] or [[forestry]] will necessarily cannibalize the [[natural capital]] of [[soil]] or [[forest]]. Some think this argument can be applied even to more developed economies.

==The role of technology, and Jevons paradox==
Mainstream economists would argue that economies are driven by new technology&amp;mdash;for instance, we have faster computers today than a year ago, but not necessarily physically more computers{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}. Growth that relies entirely on exploiting increased knowledge rather than exploiting increased [[resource consumption]] may thus not qualify as uneconomic growth. In some cases, this may be true where technology enables lower amounts of input to be used in producing the same unit of product (and/or it reduces the amount or hazardousness of the waste generated per unit product produced) (e.g., the increased availability of movies through the Internet or cable television electronically may reduce the demand for physical video tapes or DVDs for films). Nonetheless, it is crucial to also recognise that innovation- or knowledge-driven growth still may not entirely resolve the problem of scale, or increasing resource consumption. For instance, there might likely be more computers due to greater demand and replacements for slower computers.

The [[Jevons Paradox]] is the proposition that technological progress that increases the efficiency with which a resource is used, tends to increase (rather than decrease) the rate of consumption of that resource.&lt;ref&gt;Jevons, W.S. 1865. ''The Coal Question: An Inquiry Concerning the Progress of the Nation, and the Probable Exhaustion of Our Coal-Mines''. London: Macmillan and Co.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Czech, B. 2006. If Rome is burning, why are we fiddling? ''Conservation Biology'' 20 (6): 1563-1565.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, given that expenditure on necessities and taxes remain the same, (i) the availability of energy-saving lightbulbs may mean lower electricity usage and fees for a household but this frees up more discretionary, disposable income for additional consumption elsewhere (an example of the [[Rebound effect (conservation)|"rebound effect"]])&lt;ref&gt;Binswanger, M. 2001. Technological progress and sustainable development: what about the rebound effect? ''Ecological Economics'' 36(1): 119-132.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Herring, H. 2000. Is energy efficiency environmentally friendly? ''Energy &amp; Environment'' 11(3): 313-325.&lt;/ref&gt; and (ii) technology (or globalisation) that leads to the availability of cheaper goods for consumers also frees up discretionary income for increased consumptive spending.

On the other hand, new renewable energy and climate change mitigation technology (such as artificial photosynthesis) has been argued to promote a prolonged era of human stewardship over ecosystems known as the [[Sustainocene]]. In the [[Sustainocene]], "instead of the cargo-cult ideology of perpetual economic growth through corporate pillage of nature, globalised artificial photosynthesis will facilitate a [[steady state economy]] and further technological revolutions such as domestic nano-factories and e-democratic input to local communal and global governance structures. In such a world, humans will no longer feel economically threatened, but rather proud, that their moral growth has allowed them to uphold [[Rights of Nature]]."&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Faunce. 'Artificial Photosynthesis Could Extend Rights to Nature. The Conversation 2 July 2013. https://theconversation.com/artificial-photosynthesis-could-extend-rights-to-nature-15380 (accessed 2 July 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Union of Democratic Forces''' ({{lang|bg|Съюз на демократичните сили}}, {{lang|bg-Latn|Sayuz na demokratichnite sili}}, СДС, SDS) is a [[political party]] in [[Bulgaria]], founded in 1989 as a union of several political organizations in opposition to the communist government. The Union was transformed into a single unified party with the same name. The SDS is a member of the [[European People's Party]] (EPP). In the 1990s the party had the largest membership in the country, with one million members,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.24chasa.bg/Article/5300656 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=March 13, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313203340/https://www.24chasa.bg/Article/5300656 |archivedate=March 13, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but has since splintered into a number of small parties totaling no more than 40,000 members. The SDS proper had 12,000 members in 2016.&lt;ref name="24chasa"/&gt;

== History ==
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2012}}
Dissident groups formed under the faltering regime of [[Todor Zhivkov]] in the late 1980s were the basis for the Union. Once Zhivkov fell, a loose political confederation was envisioned where constituent groups could continue to work for their own cause, while the coordinating council would include three members from each organization. The Longtime dissident philosopher [[Zhelyu Zhelev]], who would later become Bulgaria's President, was elected chairman, and [[Petar Beron (politician)|Petar Beron]], a well-known [[Environmental science|environmental scientist]], was chosen as secretary.

The SDS was officially founded on 7 December 1989 as a union of eleven political organizations, such as [[Ekoglasnost]], [[Party of Bulgarian Social Democrats|Bulgarian Social Democratic Workers' Party (United)]] and [[Bulgarian Agrarian People's Union "Nikola Petkov"]]. The following year, six more parties were incorporated ([[Radical Democratic Party (Bulgaria)|Radical Democratic Party]], [[Green Party of Bulgaria]], [[Democratic Party (Bulgaria)|Democratic Party]], [[New Social Democratic Party (Bulgaria)|New Social Democratic Party]], [[United Democratic Centre (Bulgaria)|United Democratic Centre]], [[Democratic Front (Bulgaria)|Democratic Front]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.omda.bg/bulg/news/party/sds.htm|title=Omda.bg - Съюз на демократичните сили /СДС/|website=OMDA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/UDF_Coordinating_Council_1990 Coordinating Council of the Union of Democratic Forces.] ''Demokratsiya Newspaper'', 27 April 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

The SDS lost the 1990 elections to the [[Bulgarian Socialist Party]] but still participated in the joint cabinet of [[Dimitar Iliev Popov]]. On 15 May 1991 39 members left the SDS because of disagreements with the draft of the new constitution and founded the new organizations [[SDS-Center]] and [[SDS-Liberals]]. Later the remnants of the SDS formed their own cabinet with Prime Minister [[Filip Dimitrov]] in November 1991, though the cabinet lasted only a little over a year when the government failed a [[motion of confidence]] in September 1992. The socialists, together with the [[Movement for Rights and Freedoms]], formed a coalition government headed by Prof. [[Lyuben Berov]]. Following the resignation of Berov's cabinet in October 1994, the BSP went on to win the [[Bulgarian parliamentary election, 1994|1994 elections]].

However, following discontent over economic problems, Prime Minister [[Zhan Videnov]] resigned at the end of 1996, clearing the way for [[Bulgarian parliamentary election, 1997|new elections]], this time won by the SDS with a crushing 55% vote. Party leader [[Ivan Kostov]] went on to form the new government and successfully passed several economic reforms. He was eventually rewarded in December 1999 with an invitation to begin membership talks with the [[European Union]]. But public discontent over the social cost of the reforms, including increased unemployment, as well as allegations of corruption led to the SDS's defeat in the [[Bulgarian parliamentary election, 2001|June 2001 elections]], which were won by the [[National Movement for Stability and Progress|National Movement for Simeon II]]. The [[United Democratic Forces]] won 18.2% of the popular vote and 51 out of 240 seats.

The SDS was chaired until the May 20, 2007 European elections by [[Petar Stoyanov]], former president of the country. Meanwhile, Kostov, the former Prime Minister and SDS party leader went on to form his own party - [[Democrats for a Strong Bulgaria]]. At the [[Bulgarian parliamentary election, 2005|2005]] parliamentary election, the United Democratic Forces won 8.4% of the popular vote and 20 out of 240 seats.

It was announced at the inaugural conference of the [[Movement for European Reform]] (MER, March 2007) that the SDS would become official partners alongside the [[Conservative Party (UK)|British Conservative Party]] and the [[Czech Republic|Czech]] [[Civic Democratic Party (Czech Republic)|Civic Democratic Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conservatives.com/tile.do?def%3Dnews.story.page%26obj_id%3D135350%26speeches%3D1 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=March 7, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070625043626/http://www.conservatives.com/tile.do?def=news.story.page&amp;obj_id=135350&amp;speeches=1 |archivedate=June 25, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In mid April 2007, the SDS backtracked on its decision, stating that it remains loyal to the EPP and that it will never leave the EPP section of the EPP-ED Group to join another Group.

In the [[European Parliament election, 2007 (Bulgaria)|May 20, 2007 European elections]] the SDS failed to elect even a single MEP, resulting in the resignation of Stoyanov who led the list.

At the start of 2009 the SDS entered in an electoral alliance named the "[[Blue Coalition]]" with four other center-right parties: the [[Democrats for a Strong Bulgaria|DSB]], the [[United Agrarians]], the [[Bulgarian Social Democratic Party]] and the [[Radical Democratic Party (Bulgaria)|Radical Democratic Party]]. The alliance fielded candidates for the [[European Parliament election, 2009 (Bulgaria)|June 2009 European election]] winning a seat. When the [[Lisbon Treaty]] came into force in December of that year, their representation doubled. Now both the SDS and the DSB had an MEP.

The Blue coalition placed fifth in the [[Bulgarian parliamentary election, 2009|legislative election]] a month later with a combined 6.8% of the vote and 15 seats.

In the [[Bulgarian parliamentary election, 2013|May 2013 elections]], the SDS lost all of its seats in the Bulgarian National Assembly.

== United Democratic Forces ==
For the 1997 parliamentary elections, an alliance named [[United Democratic Forces]] was formed around SDS. The same name was later used for other elections and parliamentary groups.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

== The Blue Coalition ==
In early 2009 an alliance was formed together with [[Democrats for a Strong Bulgaria]] for the [[European Parliament election, 2009 (Bulgaria)|European Parliament elections]] and [[Bulgarian parliamentary election, 2009|National Assembly elections]]. The coalition was named the [[Blue Coalition]] and included some other parties.

== The Reformist Bloc ==
The coalition agreement to form the alliance of the [[Reformist Bloc]] was signed on 20 December 2013. The five parties that signed the agreement were: Union of Democratic Forces, [[Democrats for a Strong Bulgaria]], [[Bulgaria for Citizens Movement]], [[People's Party Freedom and Dignity]], and the [[Bulgarian Agrarian National Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bulgarian Rightists Seal Reformist Bloc Coalition|url=http://www.novinite.com/articles/156583/Bulgarian+Rightists+Seal+Reformist+Bloc+Coalition|work=Novinite.com|publisher=Sofia News Agency|accessdate=31 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Value measuring methodology''' (or VMM) is a tool that helps [[financial planner]]s balance both tangible and intangible values when making [[investment decisions]], and monitor benefits.

Formal methods to calculate the [[Return on investment]] (ROI) have been widely understood and used for a long time, but there was no easy and widely known way to provide a formal justification for decisions based on intangible values, which can include the reputation of an organization, the wellbeing of staff, or the impact on society or the environment at large.  It was particularly difficult for decision makers to work through the trade-offs between costs and intangible benefits, especially for long-term investments by commercial organizations, and for governments and non-profit organizations who are primarily concerned with intangible values without wasting limited funds.  Even within commercial organizations, units traditionally viewed as "cost centres" found it difficult to get acceptance of proposals for projects that would lead to general and long-term efficiency or capability gains, as the benefits were difficult to assign to "profit centres".

The approach of the VMM is to start by developing a framework of values, including costs, risks, tangible returns and intangible returns, then assign scores to each element in the framework.  Once the relative scores of the different types of values are assigned and agreed, it becomes possible to examine alternatives and give yes/no decisions in a fairly objective and repeatable manner, and review progress using a range of traditional quantitative program management techniques.  As well as allowing comparison of different values within a project, the quantitative approach of the VMM permits review of the total contribution to a particular value across a range of projects.

==History and Adoption==
VMM was developed by the General Services Administration's (GSA) Office of Government-wide Policy (OGP) in collaboration with Harvard University.  The VMM was first articulated in a report by [[Booz Allen Hamilton]] in 2002 for the US Social Security Administration, as part of an [[E-Services|electronic services]] project.&lt;ref&gt;Dan Remenyi (2006). ''Proceedings of the 13th European Conference on Information Technology Evaluation''. p.182&lt;/ref&gt;

It was popularized by a suite of documents released by the [[US Federal Chief Information Officers Council]] in 2003, which give detailed guidance to agencies helping them to seek funding and plan budgets for their proposals, analyze their investments for values across their portfolio of initiatives, and track both tangible and intangible returns over time, with a particular emphasis on information technology investments and the production of ''OMB-300'' exhibits for the [http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb US Office of Management and Budget].  The introductory document&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cio.gov/documents/TheValueof_IT_Investments.pdf Introductory document]&lt;/ref&gt; was given the significant title ''It's Not Just Return on Investment Anymore''.

The suite of documents from the US CIO Council include the following, which are readily adapted for other countries and non-government organizations:&lt;ref&gt;Nagy K. Hanna (2010). ''Transforming Government and Building the Information Society''. p.288&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outline of the steps in the VMM==
Each of the four major steps of the VMM process has tasks and outputs.  The breakdown below, and the description of major value factors, is based primarily on the suite of VMM documents from the [[US Federal Chief Information Officers Council]] in 2003.

===Develop a decision framework===
*Tasks
**Identify and define value structure
**Identify and define risk structure
**Identify and define cost structure
**Begin documentation
*Outputs
**Prioritized value factors
**Defined and prioritized measures within each value factor
**Initial risk factor inventory
**Risk tolerance boundary
**Tailored cost structure
**Initial documentation of basis of estimate of cost, value and risk

Forcing the development of the decision framework, with the assignment of scores to intangibles allowing comparison to other intangibles as well as tangibles, eases the resolution of differences of perspectives between senior managers (e.g. Chief Financial Officer, Risk Manager, and the proposer of the initiative), allows changes to the scores to flow through to the rest of the process (especially the analysis of alternatives), and provides clarity of benefits to a board (before, during, and after the initiative), and clarity of priorities to people looking after more detailed aspects of the initiative.  The same transparency of values apply if the proposal is developed at an enterprise level, or within a lesser organizational unit.

'''Major value factors''' (from which the value hierarchy is developed) include the following
*direct customer value: benefits to customers/clients, e.g. convenient access, product enhancement
*social: benefits to society as a whole, e.g. reducing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions
*operational: better operations and lowering barriers to future initiatives, e.g. improved infrastructure
*strategic: contributions to strategic initiatives and fulfilling the mission of the organization
*financial: financial benefits, including increased revenue, decreased costs, and cost avoidance

===Analyze alternatives===
*Tasks
**Identify and define alternatives
**Estimate value and cost
**Conduct risk analysis
**Ongoing documentation
*Outputs
**Viable alternatives for solutions
**Cost and value analyses
**Risk analyses
**Tailored basis of estimate documenting value, cost, and risk, economic factors and assumptions

===Pull the information together===
*Tasks
**Aggregate the cost estimate
**Calculate the return on investment
**Calculate the value score
**Calculate the risk score
**Compare value, cost, and risk
*Outputs
**Cost estimate
**ROI metrics
**Value score
**Risk scores (cost and value)
**Comparison of cost, value and risk

===Communicate and document===
*Tasks
**Communicate value to customers and stakeholders
**Prepare budget justification document
**Satisfy ad hoc reporting requirement
**Use lessons learned to improve processes
*Outputs
**Documentation, insight and support:
***To develop results-based management controls
***For enterprise budget reporting and analysis
***To communicative initiative value
***For improving decision making and performance measurement through "lessons learned"
**Change and ad hoc reporting requirements

==Uses in Capital Investment Planning==
A holistic approach to Capital Investment Planning (CIP), using the portfolio approach, requires a significant amount of supporting documentation.  The VMM approach can provide planning data and performance assessment criteria for the following:

*Summary of spending
*Project description and justification
*Performance goals and measures
*Alternatives analysis
*Risk inventory and assessment
*Program management (partial)
*Acquisition strategy (partial)
*Project and funding plan (partial)
*Business case criteria (partial)

In particular, VMM allows quantitative reporting of commitments to particular intangibles across a number of initiatives, even when they differ by their stage in their lifecycles.

[[Military history of ancient Rome|Roman soldiers]] were given rewards at the end of their service including cash or [[land grant|land]] (''praemia''). [[Augustus]] fixed the amount in AD 5 at 3000 [[denarii]] and by the time of [[Caracalla]] it had risen to 5000 denarii.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.roman-empire.net/army/army.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[US Department of Veterans Affairs]] provides a wide variety of benefits,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Benefit Summary Materials|url=http://benefits.va.gov/BENEFITS/Benefits_Summary_Materials.asp|work=Veterans Benefits Administration|publisher=Department of Veterans Affairs|accessdate=27 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; e.g., educational assistance (GI Bill), healthcare, assisted living,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Simmons|first1=Claire|title=Nursing Home Care and the Aid and Attendance Benefit|url=http://www.veteranaid.org/blog/nursing-home-care-and-the-aid-and-attendance-benefit/|publisher=VeteranAid|accessdate=15 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; home loans, insurance, and burial and memorial services, for retired or separated [[United States armed forces]] personnel, their dependents, and survivors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Federal Benefits for Veterans, Dependents and Survivors|url=http://www.va.gov/opa/publications/benefits_book.asp|work=Office of Public and Intergovernmental Affairs|publisher=Department of Veterans Affairs|accessdate=27 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The VA provides compensation to disabled veterans&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Service-connected Disabilities|url=http://www.va.gov/opa/publications/benefits_book/benefits_chap02.asp|work=Veterans Benefits Administration|publisher=Department of Veterans Affairs|accessdate=27 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  who suffer from a medical disorder or injury that was incurred in, or aggravated by, their military service, and which causes social and occupational impairment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Compensation|url=http://www.benefits.va.gov/compensation/index.asp|work=Veterans Benefits Administration|publisher=Department of Veterans Affairs|accessdate=27 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many U.S. states also offer disability benefits for veterans.

Archival record of the benefits awarded to injured soldiers and veterans of the [[American Civil War]] began after 1865.  Union soldiers received a more committed pension archival effort on the part of the Federal government, thanks to superior databases in the North and a more stable bureaucratic oversight.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.familybirthrecords.com/db.asp?dbid=4654|title = Ancestry® {{!}} Genealogy, Family Trees &amp; Family History Records|website = www.familybirthrecords.com|access-date = 2016-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Turmoil during Reconstruction in the war-weary South made any effort at maintaining pension records difficult if not impossible.  Later university-led research projects would give insight into the history of pension provisions by the Federal government leading up to the Civil War.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=zOdRAAAAMAAJ|title = History of the Civil War Military Pensions, 1861-1865|last = Oliver|first = John William|date = 1917-01-01|publisher = University of Wisconsin--Madison|language = en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These analysis shed light on the ever-changing role of compensation in American society and delved into the idea that [[American Revolutionary War]] soldiers received superior care after war than later Civil War veterans.&lt;ref&gt;

In 1932 veterans from the [[First World War]] marched on Washington as the [[Bonus Army]], also known as the Bonus Expeditionary Force.

'''Wage labour''' (also '''wage labor''' in [[American English]]) is the [[Socioeconomics|socioeconomic]] relationship between a [[Workforce|worker]] and an [[Employment|employer]], where the worker sells his or her labour under a formal or informal [[employment contract]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Steinfeld|2009|p=3}}: "All labor contracts were/are designed legally to bind a worker in one way or another to fulfill the labor obligations the worker has undertaken. That is one of the principal purposes of labor contracts."&lt;/ref&gt; These transactions usually occur in a [[labour market]] where [[wage]]s are market determined.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Deakin|Wilkinson|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br/&gt; In exchange for the wages paid, the work product generally becomes the [[work for hire|undifferentiated property]] of the employer, except  for special cases such as the vesting of [[intellectual property]] patents in the United States where [[Patent#Ownership|patent rights]] are [[Freelancer|usually]] vested in the employee personally responsible for the invention. A [[wage labourer]] is a person whose primary means of income is from the selling of his or her labour in this way.

== Characteristics ==
In modern mixed economies such as those of the [[OECD]] countries, it is currently the most common form of work arrangement. Although most labour is organised as per this structure, the wage work arrangements of [[CEO]]s, professional employees, and professional contract workers are sometimes conflated with [[working class|class assignments]], so that "wage labour" is considered to apply only to unskilled, semi-skilled or [[manual labour]]. Various studies have shown that employees generally spend 1.5 to 3 hours a day on non-work related activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Paulsen|first=Roland|date=2013-12-26|title=Non-work at work: Resistance or what?|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1350508413515541|journal=Organization|language=en|volume=22|issue=3|pages=351–367|doi=10.1177/1350508413515541}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types ==
The most common form of wage labour currently is ordinary direct, or "full-time". This is employment in which a free worker sells his or her labour for an indeterminate time (from a few years to the entire career of the worker), in return for a money-wage or salary and a continuing relationship with the employer which it does not in general offer contractors or other irregular staff. However, wage labour takes many other forms, and explicit as opposed to implicit (i.e. conditioned by local labour and tax law) contracts are not uncommon. Economic history shows a great variety of ways, in which labour is traded and exchanged. The differences show up in the form of:
* Employment status – a worker could be employed full-time, part-time, or on a casual basis. He or she could be employed for example temporarily for a specific project only, or on a permanent basis. Part-time wage labour could combine with part-time [[self-employment]]. The worker could be employed also as an [[apprenticeship|apprentice]].
* Civil (legal) status – the worker could for example be a free citizen, an [[indentured labour]]er, the subject of [[forced labour]] (including some prison or army labour); a worker could be assigned by the political authorities to a task, they could be a [[slavery|semi-slave]] or a [[serfdom|serf]] bound to the land who is hired out part of the time. So the labour might be performed on a more or less voluntary basis, or on a more or less involuntary basis, in which there are many gradations.
* Method of payment ([[remuneration]] or [[Compensation of employees|compensation]]) – The work done could be paid "in cash" (a money-wage) or "in kind" (through receiving goods and/or services), or in the form of "[[Piecework|piece rates]]" where the wage is directly dependent on how much the worker produces. In some cases, the worker might be paid in the form of credit used to buy goods and services, or in the form of [[stock options]] or [[shares]] in an enterprise.
* Method of hiring – the worker might engage in a labour-contract on his or her own initiative, or he or she might hire out their labour as part of a group. But he or she may also hire out their labour via an intermediary (such as an employment agency) to a third party. In this case, he or she is paid by the intermediary, but works for a third party which pays the intermediary. In some cases, labour is [[subcontracting|subcontracted]] several times, with several intermediaries. Another possibility is that the worker is assigned or posted to a job by a political authority, or that an agency hires out a worker to an enterprise ''together'' with [[means of production]].

== Criticisms ==

{{main|Wage slavery}}
Wage labour has long been compared to slavery by socialists.&lt;ref name="English Working Class p. 599"&gt;{{Harvnb|Thompson|1966|p=599}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="English Working Class p. 912"&gt;{{Harvnb|Thompson|1966|p=912}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Geoffrey Ostergaard p. 133"&gt;{{Harvnb|Ostergaard|1997|p=133}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shop Floor p. 37"&gt;{{Harvnb|Lazonick|1990|p=37}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the term "[[Labour economics#Wage slavery|wage slavery]]" is often utilised as a pejorative for wage labour.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hallgrimsdottir|Benoit|2007}}; {{Harvnb|Roediger|2007a}}.&lt;br&gt;The term is not without its critics, as {{Harvnb|Roediger|2007b|p=247}}, notes: "[T]he challenge to loose connections of wage (or white) slavery to chattel slavery was led by [[Frederick Douglass]] and other Black, often fugitive, abolitionists. Their challenge was mercilessly concrete. Douglass, who tried out speeches in work places before giving them in halls, was far from unable to speak to or hear white workers, but he and [[William Wells Brown]] did challenge metaphors regarding white slavery sharply. They noted, for example, that their escapes from slavery had left job openings and wondered if any white workers wanted to take the jobs."&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, advocates of slavery looked upon the "comparative evils of Slave Society and of Free Society, of slavery to human Masters and slavery to Capital,"&lt;ref name="books.google.co.uk"&gt;{{Harvnb|Fitzhugh|1857|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ECdb7EjiBnEC&amp;pg=PR16 xvi]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and proceeded to argue persuasively that wage slavery was actually ''worse'' than [[chattel slavery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Carsel|1940}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Slavery apologists like [[George Fitzhugh]] contended that workers only accepted wage labour with the passage of time, as they became "familiarized and inattentive to the infected social atmosphere they continually inhale[d]."&lt;ref name="books.google.co.uk"/&gt;

{{quote box|quote=The slave, together with his labour-power, was sold to his owner once for all.... The [wage] labourer, on the other hand, sells his very self, and that by fractions.... He [belongs] to the capitalist class; and it is for him ... to find a buyer in this capitalist class.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Marx|1847|loc=[http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1847/wage-labour/ch02.htm Chapter&amp;nbsp;2]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;|source=—[[Karl Marx]]|align=left|width=40%|fontsize=91%|bgcolor=AliceBlue|tstyle=text-align: left;|qalign=right|qstyle=text-align: left;|quoted=yes|salign=right|sstyle=text-align: right;}}
According to [[Noam Chomsky]], analysis of the psychological implications of wage slavery goes back to the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] era. In his 1791 book ''On the Limits of State Action'', classical [[liberalism|liberal]] thinker [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]] explained how "whatever does not spring from a man's free choice, or is only the result of instruction and guidance, does not enter into his very nature; he does not perform it with truly human energies, but merely with mechanical exactness" and so when the labourer works under external control, "we may admire what he does, but we despise what he is."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chomsky|1993|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=DIpW10rWZFAC&amp;pg=PA19 19]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Both the [[Milgram experiment|Milgram]] and [[Stanford experiment]]s have been found useful in the psychological study of wage-based workplace relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Thye|Lawler|2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, as per anthropologist [[David Graeber]], the earliest wage labour contracts we know about were in fact contracts for the rental of chattel slaves (usually the owner would receive a share of the money, and the slave, another, with which to maintain his or her living expenses.) Such arrangements, according to Graeber, were quite common in New World slavery as well, whether in the United States or Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Graeber|2004|p=[http://www.eleuthera.it/files/materiali/David_Graeber_Fragments_%20Anarchist_Anthropology.pdf 71]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[C. L. R. James]] argued in ''[[The Black Jacobins]]'' that most of the techniques of human organisation employed on factory workers during the industrial revolution were first developed on slave plantations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Graeber|2007|p=106}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

For Marxists, labour-as-commodity, which is how they regard wage labour,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Marx|1990|p=1006}}: "[L]abour-power, a commodity sold by the worker himself."&lt;/ref&gt; provides a fundamental point of attack against capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;Another one, of course, being the capitalists' theft from workers via [[surplus-value]].&lt;/ref&gt; "It can be persuasively argued," noted one concerned philosopher, "that the conception of the worker's labour as a commodity confirms Marx's stigmatisation of the wage system of private capitalism as 'wage-slavery;' that is, as an instrument of the capitalist's for reducing the worker's condition to that of a slave, if not below it."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Nelson|1995|p=158}}. This Marxist objection is what motivated Nelson's essay, which argues that labour is not, in fact, a commodity.&lt;/ref&gt; That this objection is fundamental follows immediately from Marx's conclusion that wage labour is the very foundation of capitalism: "Without a ''class dependent on wages'', the moment individuals confront each other as free persons, there can be no production of surplus value; without the production of surplus-value there can be no capitalist production, and hence no capital and no capitalist!"&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Marx|1990|p=1005}}. Emphasis in the original.&lt;br&gt;See also p.&amp;nbsp;716: "[T]he capitalist produces [and reproduces] the worker as a wage-labourer. This incessant reproduction, this perpetuation of the worker, is the absolutely necessary condition for capitalist production."&lt;/ref&gt;
