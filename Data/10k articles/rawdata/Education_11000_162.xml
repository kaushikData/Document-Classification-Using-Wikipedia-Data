'''Annie Wilson Patterson''' (27 October 1868 – 16 January 1934) was an [[Irish people|Irish]] organist, music educator, writer, composer, and arranger.

==Life==
Annie Patterson was born in [[Lurgan]], [[County Armagh]], [[Ireland]], and was related through her mother's family to Lord Macaulay. She made her debut performance in Dublin at age fifteen, studied at [[Alexandra College]] and the [[Royal Irish Academy of Music]] in [[Dublin]] (with [[Robert Prescott Stewart]]), and received her doctorate in 1889, becoming the first Irish or British woman to hold a Doctorate of Music. After she completed her studies, she became an examiner for the Royal University of Ireland and worked as an organist and conductor of the Dublin Choral Union and the Hampstead Harmonic Society. In 1897 she co-founded the [[Feis Ceoil]] festival in Dublin. The Dr. Annie Patterson Medal is awarded in her honor at the festival. In 1909 Patterson took a job as organist at St. Anne's in [[Shandon, Cork|Shandon]], County [[Cork (city)|Cork]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Women in music: an encyclopedic biobibliography: Volume 1|first=Donald L.|last=Hixon|first2=Don A.|last2=Hennessee|year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Patterson composed sacred and secular cantatas, orchestral works and songs based on Irish themes. She also wrote poetry, essays, short stories as well as professional articles and books on music. She published articles in ''The Girl’s Own Paper'' in [[England]] and a series of articles on music in the ''Weekly Irish Times'' from 1899–1901. She published ten books, including a text on Irish folk music and a biography of [[Robert Schumann]] for the ''Master Musician’s Series''. In 1924, she succeeded [[Carl Hardebeck]] as a lecturer on Irish music in the Music Department of University College Cork, where she worked until her death in 1934.&lt;ref&gt;Fleischmann, Aloys, ''Music in Ireland: A Symposium'', Cork 1952, p. 273; O'Connor, Jennifer (2010): ''The multi-faceted career of Dr Annie Patterson.'' {{cite web |url=https://www.dur.ac.uk/resources/music/Irishmusicconference-collatedabstracts.doc|accessdate=27 November 2010|title=First International Conference on Irish Music and Musicians Music Department, University of Durham, 12–15 July 2010, Abstracts}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==

Cooper was born in [[Souris, Manitoba]], Canada,&lt;ref name="BC"&gt;{{cite web|title=Austin Cooper|url=http://visualarts.britishcouncil.org/collection/artists/cooper-austin-1890/initial/c|website=visualarts.britishcouncil.org|publisher=[[British Council]]|accessdate=31 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; on 5 March 1890,&lt;ref name="Tepapa"&gt;{{cite web|title=Austin Cooper|url=https://collections.tepapa.govt.nz/agent/41547|publisher=Tepapa|accessdate=31 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the son of an Irish farmer.&lt;ref name="Douglas"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Douglas|first1=Ava|title=Austin Cooper|url=http://www.historygraphicdesign.com/the-modernist-era/pictorial-modernism/459-austin-cooper|accessdate=31 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cooper studied at the [[Cardiff School of Art]], and then the [[Hospitalfield House|Allan-Frazer College of Art]] in Arbroath.&lt;ref name="Douglas" /&gt;

[[File:Christ in Calgary by Austin Cooper.png|thumb|Black and white newspaper reproduction of "Christ in Calgary"]]

He began his career as a commercial artist after returning to [[Calgary]],&lt;ref name="Douglas" /&gt; at a commercial art studio alongside fellow Arbroath student [[Adam Sherriff Scott]]. The two produced a {{convert|4|x|2|m|abbr=on}}&lt;ref name="Bly"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bly|first1=David|title=Christ in Calgary painting stirred controversy|work=[[Calgary Herald]]|date=23 January 2004|page=B4}}&lt;/ref&gt; painting "Christ in Calgary" (1913; thought lost),&lt;ref name="Salter"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Salter |first1=Colin |title=Austin Clare Cooper (1890–1964) and the Calgary Christ |url=http://talltalesfromthetrees.blogspot.co.uk/2015/11/austin-clare-cooper-1890-1964-and.html |accessdate=31 December 2017 |date=7 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was exhibited unsigned at the Royal Picture Gallery there for six months, described by the [[Calgary News-Telegram]] (one of whose street-vendors was depicted in the painting&lt;ref name="Bly" /&gt;) as showing:

{{Quote|A crowd of hurrying people is on the street hurrying west on the side and corner near the old Royal hotel, and intermingled with this crowd is the Indian, the squaw with her child in a papoose, the lady stenographer with her beau; the lumberman chatting with his companion on the corner, and, leaning up against the wall of the hotel; the policeman talking to a nurse and taking notes on an accident; the mother and her little girl; the Negro standing unconcerned, and other characters; but the most prominent character in the picture is a large representative figure of Christ standing on the corner of the pavement, while directly in front of him and looking up into his face with a frightened look is a woman of the street, bearing all the characteristics of such a woman, and dressed in red.}}

On being identified as one of the artists Cooper's only comment, to a newspaper, was "We have nothing to say about it except what appears on the canvass".&lt;ref name="Bly" /&gt; Subsequently, he and Sherriff-Scott set up their own company, Shagpat Studios, in [[Montreal]].&lt;ref name="Salter" /&gt;

During World War I he was in Flanders with the [[Canadian Black Watch]], rising to [[Regimental Sergeant Major]], before being discharged in 1919. He moved to London in 1922,&lt;ref name="BC" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Douglas" /&gt; having met his wife-to-be there.&lt;ref name="Salter" /&gt;

From 1936 to 1940, he was principal of the London branch of the [[Reimann School]] of Commercial and Industrial Art.&lt;ref name="BC" /&gt;

Later in his career, in 1943, he gave up commercial art for abstract painting.&lt;ref name="BC" /&gt; His first solo exhibition was held in 1948, at the London Gallery.&lt;ref name="BC" /&gt; Several of his abstract works are in the collection of the [[Tate Gallery]].&lt;ref name="Tate"&gt;{{cite web|title=Austin Cooper 1890–1964|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/austin-cooper-939|work=Tate Etc.|accessdate=1 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He died in 1964.&lt;ref name="BC" /&gt;

'''Bernhard Hoesli''' (1923–1984) was a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[architect]] and [[collage]] artist.

==Early age==

Hoesli was born in [[Glarus]], Switzerland from a [[German people|German]]-[[Swiss people|Swiss]] father and a [[French people|French]] mother. He later moved at an early age with his family to live in [[Zürich]]. After graduating from high school with a [[mathematics]] degree he joined [[ETH Zurich]] where he obtained a degree in architecture in 1944.

==Career==
In 1947 Hoesli moved to Paris, France to join architect [[Fernand Léger]]'s team and later was accepted by [[Le Corbusier]] as an assistant. In 1948 he was sent to [[La Plata]], [[Argentina]] to supervise the construction of the [[Curutchet House]]. A year later, he was appointed to take charge of the [[Unité d'Habitation]] project in [[Marseille]].

===The Texas Rangers===
Hoesli moved to the United States in 1951. He first joined the [[University of Texas|School of Architecture at the University of Texas at Austin]] as a professor of architecture. It was there where he was joined by architects [[Colin Rowe]], [[John Hejduk]] and [[Werner Seligmann]] among others to form the [[The Texas Rangers (architects)|Texas Rangers group of architects]]. He then returned to teach at ETH Zurich.

===Teaching at the ETH Zurich===
In 1959, which Hoesli hails as the year [[Modern Architecture]] became teachable worldwide, many opinions on architectural instruction changed. In that year, the year of the death of [[Frank Lloyd Wright]], his [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|Guggenheim]] museum was completed, as were the [[Birmingham Museum of Art]] and the [[Sidney Myer Music Bowl]]. At this point, Hoesli felt free to discuss the procedure of design with students through pedagogy. His design problems, which "were so formulated that the student had to solve tasks within a given framework of requirements and achieve precise results",&lt;ref name="Ref_"&gt;Jansen et al. Architektur Lehren. Institut gta, Zürich, 1989. p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;  were arranged by types. The types of problems were created in order to instruct the students in a specific skill through their own self-discovery with trial and error. Hoesli relates this process to the [[Socratic method]], in which students are constantly faced with important questions and debates. When Hoesli began teaching architecture at the ETH in 1959, some of his duties included 'looking after' fifth-year students. At this point, Hoesli realized that most of the fifth-years had an understanding of design as being dependent upon a flash of inspiration rather than a building of design steps upon each other. These students completed projects that had no room for growth or adaptation, and they would not accept criticism or suggestions for improvement. Hoesli felt that this approach was counterproductive and set about changing the way the entire curriculum was structured. 
Also at the time Hoesli began teaching at the ETH, the design process revolved around different building types. Students would complete an assignment from a specific building group. "Design began with a garden house, then continued with a holiday home, family dwelling, then on to a multi-family dwelling, then on to a multi-storey block, school building and shopping centre, until at the end of the studies a church or theatre was ventured upon."&lt;ref name="Jansen 1989. p. 8"&gt;Jansen et al. ''Architektur Lehren''. Institut gta, Zürich, 1989. p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the contrary opinion, Hoesli believed that steps of design were more important than mere function. He saw transparency and wise space definition as the ultimate goals for architectural work. "Transparency," Hoesli wrote, "frees us, because we allow it, to see buildings and structures in connections and independent of the differences between 'historical' and 'modern'."&lt;ref name="Ref_a"&gt;Hoesli, Bernhard. "Commentary." Rowe, Colin and Slutzky, Robert. ''Transparency''. Birkhauser:1964 p. 82&lt;/ref&gt;  He also articulated that transparency as referenced with the modern tradition became an important tool for instruction in the schools of architecture throughout the world.

Further, Hoesli felt that students should have the opportunity to branch out in creativity through a more structured process than was present at the ETH. He felt the structure of the ETH curriculum at the time was too dependent on chance and the fleeting feelings of a fine art mentality rather than a practical design process.

After his University of Texas experience, Hoesli's leadership skills and persuasive discussions were at their peak. He was able to formulate new course structures and implement them with ease. He also possessed the wherewithal and energy to pursue the course of action he saw as best for the schools.

At the time Hoesli decided to alter the ETH"s pedagogy, he was delighted to discover a common Modern manifesto arising as society pronounced Modern architecture dead. He stated, "In order that the Architecture Department of the ETH can reach the standard of international architectural development, the introduction into architectural design had to be consciously and systematically based on [[Modern Architecture]] and the work of its protagonists."&lt;ref name="Jansen 1989. p. 8"/&gt;  He saw the three main protagonists as [[Frank Lloyd Wright]], [[Le Corbusier]], and [[Mies van der Rohe]]. His obsession with the Modernist tradition led him to defend it after it became passe and the public pronounced it dead. He suggested that not only did students need to survive the Modern movement, but embrace it as history. He also felt that the Cubist and  De Stijl painters had similar perceptions of the continuity of space and drew inspiration from them. He commented profusely on the Modernist concept of continuous space in both writings and lectures regarding his three protagonists as well as many others. He used [[Modernism]] as a source of history and theory for his lessons.

"First", it is written of his changes in the ETH, "it was decided what should be taught. Then, from this, situations and programmes were formulated. The student sees himself confronted by a problem. He deals with it, makes his own experiences, and on the basis of a review of the theme in the lecture and discussion, it is possible for him, at the same time, to understand what he has experienced."&lt;ref name="Ref_b"&gt;Jansen et al. Architektur Lehren. Institut gta, Zürich, 1989. p. 67&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Basic Design course====
Hoesli began his curriculum overhaul with the basic design course. In his opinion, "the basic course should allow for the architecturally still "unskilled" people to recognize: what an architectural idea is; how it results, how it can be drawn out; upon what it is based; and how it can be developed, treated."&lt;ref name="Ref_c"&gt;Jansen et al. Architektur Lehren. Institut gta, Zürich, 1989. p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;    This theory was put into action with several design exercises. One in the first semester involved extensive writing on the subject of the design concurrent with its first conceived sketches. This project involved first describing the everyday functions of the space to be designed, along with space requirements and basic diagrams. This was based on Hoesli's obsession with space. He stated as the first point of knowledge for architects, "The architect creates space."&lt;ref name="Jansen 1989. p. 52"&gt;Jansen et al. Architektur Lehren. Institut gta, Zürich, 1989. p. 52&lt;/ref&gt;   The students for this project started with a vague concept and explored avenues through which to improve their ideas as each step progressed. The openness of this first design step allowed for much more learning than the previous structure, as students were not as conceptually attached to a particular building before all the kinks in its design had been resolved. In short, "the first spatial organization is tested against the requirements and developed further…. The design is, above all, a spatial organization."&lt;ref name="Jansen 1989. p. 52"/&gt;

Hoesli taught new definitions of space as a continuous function. One key project in the first semester demonstrating this concept was called 'space within space.' Students were to design a space that was "defined without indicating and above or below."&lt;ref name="Ref_d"&gt;Jansen et al. Architektur Lehren. Institut gta, Zürich, 1989. p. 28&lt;/ref&gt;  The point of this exercise was to separate function from design; a surface or a defining of space was not necessarily a floor or a ceiling or a wall- those titles are added by people. He based this assignment off a quote by [[Le Corbusier]] that includes the phrase "the floor that is a horizontal wall."  This exercise, similar to the way many sculpture classes are taught, required that the finished product be equally viable from all sides. It could not contain a top or bottom or any other defining characteristic. This project, with so few but such stringent guidelines, challenged students to think about space in a different way. They also considered their materials in different ways, as many students attempted this exercise with many different media. They then faced the task of refining their materials to match their ideas or vice versa, another key concept Hoesli aimed for. The project also encouraged a great variety in creativity as students sought to execute the concept as thoroughly as possible. Students were encouraged to complete as much of the first step as possible independently in order to allow this creativity. In the second phase of this problem, which happened in the winter semester, students worked with advising groups together. They continued this exploration, defining the space within the space. They put the space they had created into another space, a cube, giving it a context of reference. Hoesli enforced his concept of 'geometry as image' during these space- exploring assignments. This, along with his preoccupation with collaging of materials in a geometric manner, was clearly communicated to the students based on their final products.

Another assignment during the first semester was the 'Extension to a House' project. Hoesli was interested in communicating that not every architectural creation needed to be a freestanding object, but that architecture involved working with the space that already existed- be it an empty lot or a pre-existing structure.

In this project, the students followed three concise steps. They first analyzed the existing structure, generally a home built by one of Hoesli's Texas Ranger friends. They analyzed both form and function of every part of the existing building, strengthening skills in drawing as well as proportion and geometry. They next did sketches and ideas for their proposed solutions to the problem and worked through these with help from faculty. They discussed the pros and cons of each idea they had before deciding on a final plan. The third step was actual work on the project, including material decision-making and discussions on how to integrate the new addition into the old structure both aesthetically and physically. This assignment also reinforced Hoesli's idea of working in steps and allowing revising to take a role in the creative process.

During the second year, students had the clubhouse assignment. They were to create a set of buildings- a clubhouse, an airplane hangar, and a workshop that worked together as a group without necessarily touching. The intent of this exercise was to teach yet more process, involving organization, site evaluation, architectural themes, construction and form, as well as practical presentation skills.

Another second-year project was known as the pottery. Students were faced with a much more difficult space to address: one in an existing urban environment. This meant that street space and a house on the lot would interact significantly with the structure they designed, including even a common courtyard-type exchange between the two structures. The location as well as function was specified for students: the building was to be a pottery business, including a shop and a studio. The process again went through many steps and revisions in order to reach its final outcome.

====Career changes====
In 1969, Hoesli was appointed Chairman of the architecture school. Unfortunately for him, this coincided with some serious political unrest both in Switzerland as a whole and within the university. He had a very difficult time adapting to the changes within the student body and their demeanor. His old methods of teaching from [[Texas]] and his prior ETH career didn't seem to work with the skeptical new generation. At this point, Hoesli realized he'd rather spend time working with students in the higher level classes who had already decided on their goals as architects. He left his first year courses in the same design and focused on the later year studios. He, along with [[Paul Hofer]] and [[Adolph Max Vogt]], founded the [[Institute for the History and Theory of Architecture]] within the ETH and pronounced himself director. This allowed him to work with only the most elite students.

After Hoesli questioned the third and fourth year design class practices he’d seen from other faculty, he made the decision to teach the third year design course with Paul Hofer. After the two collaborated on the course curriculum for that first year (1978/1979) Hoesli took over the design course. The course for the third and fourth year was not divided into semester work, but rather consisted of a single project for those years. This project, called the Venice Project, was a housing unit for an urban setting, specifically the [[Cannaregio]] district in [[Venice]], and contained six sections in its program.

====The Venice project====
The first step discussed the idea of a city as a working unit. In this step, students worked in clay to create massing models in order to understand the various interactions within volumetric shapes. They also attended related lectures. 
In the next step students analyzed different types of dwellings. Criteria for this analysis include size, layout in space, variation options, and so on.  They refine the ideas in the clay designs they created.

The third step, related to the second, deals with using the analyses of step two in order to create a structure that relates to the architecture around it. The knowledge of the architecture of the area informs the ideas students originally had and gives more structure to their ideas. Natural lighting becomes a factor. The students learned about a typical layout in a Venetian town, including even the piazza with the church, and altered their designs accordingly.

The fourth step refers specifically to the student's design and the important relationship between the inside and outside of the building. Students decide on a theme for their final designs as they address the transition from inside to outside space. This relates back to the very first assignment regarding the shaping and defining of space- continuous space rather than an inside versus an outside.

The next step seems quite difficult. Students must turn their ideas of spatial understandings for their plans into volumetric shapes; i.e. they must turn volume into mass. They did, in essence, a [[figure-ground reversal]]. This served to ensure that every space in the final design was active and engaging. Hoesli used as a basis for this step the common observation that it seems Le Corbusier's Unite is a volumetric explanation for the space in the Uffizi.

The final step was to design the scale models of their housing project, involving all the previous steps in their final designs.

What is considered the seventh step in the process is actually the selection of a new project for the following semesters. The students work together with faculty juries in order to select the goals for this project. The project is chosen as a general urban section that each student can contribute to in an individualized manner. They divide up sections of the area and provide solutions to the individual problems they present themselves with. In this way, students were able to become fully involved in the process while retaining a respect for a larger picture.

During the designing process, students were presented with lectures and instruction on common Venetian facades and asked to incorporate this information into their designs. This consisted the eighth step.

The ninth step was the final submission of the design.

The obsession with space and transparency continued throughout Hoesli's teaching career. He commented, "Transparency arises wherever there are locations in space which can be assigned two or more systems of reference—where the classification is undefined and the choice between one classification possibility or another remains open." &lt;ref name="Ref_e"&gt;Hoesli, Bernhard. "Commentary." Rowe, Colin and Slutzky, Robert. Transparency. Birkhauser:1964 p. 64&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death===
Hoesli's unexpected death in 1984 was a shock to students and faculty. They remember him as an extremely influential figure in the shaping of the ETH architecture school as well as in their personal lives and thought patterns.

'''''Cannon v. University of Chicago''''', 441 U.S. 677 (1979),{{ref|citation}} was a [[United States Supreme Court]] case which interpreted [[U.S. Congress|Congressional]] silence in the face of earlier interpretations of similar laws to determine that [[Title IX]] of the Higher Education Act provides an [[implied cause of action]].

==Facts==
[[Plaintiff]] Geraldine Cannon sued the [[University of Chicago]], asserting that she was denied admission on the basis of her sex, and that she had a cause of action under Title IX, which bars sex discrimination by federally funded institutions, but does not expressly grant a private right of action. The [[United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois]] dismissed the case. The dismissal was affirmed by the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit]], which held that the statutory procedure for termination of federal funds was the exclusive remedy provided by Congress.

One issue, buried in footnotes, would be of importance in the subsequent ''[[Alexander v. Sandoval]]'' decision. The University of Chicago claimed that Cannon was denied admission because the medical university admissions departments had a policy of not admitting applicants over thirty years of age, at least not without an advanced degree. Northwestern Medical School absolutely disqualified applicants over 35. Cannon was 39 years old at the time. The policy had a disparate impact on women.

The plaintiff appealed, contending that Congress acted in light of similar language in [[Civil Rights Act of 1964#Title VI|Title VI]] of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]], which the Supreme Court had already found to imply a private remedy, and to which Congress had allowed [[attorney fees]] (which would be unnecessary absent a private right of action).

==Issue==
Did Congress intend a private remedy to be implied from the Title IX?  Are individuals allowed to sue under Title IX, or are they only allowed to participate in class-action suits by the [[United States Department of Health, Education, and Welfare|HEW]]?

==Holding==
The Court, in an opinion by [[Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court|Justice]] [[John Paul Stevens|Stevens]], applied the four-part test set forth in ''[[Cort v. Ash]]'', 422 U.S. 66 (1975), used in order to determine whether Congress had meant for a law to be able to be privately enforced:
#  Is the plaintiff a member of a special class for whose benefit the statute was enacted? (The court notes that this can not be used to imply a right of action that is merely a criminal statute that prohibits all persons from engaging in a general prohibited behavior).
#  Does [[legislative history]] express a legislative intent to create or deny a private right of action?
#  Would creation of a private right of action frustrate legislative scheme, or is it in fact helpful to it?
#  Does the right involve an area that historically has basically been of concern to the States?
The court determined that all of the ''Cort'' factors pointed to an implied right of action:
#  Women are clearly in the special class protected by the statute, for the statute identifies persons who shall not be excluded.
#  Title IX contained language which copied that of Title VI, for which a private cause of action had already been implied by the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit|Fifth Circuit]] at the time Title IX was adopted; this was held to show legislative intent.
#  The remedy was necessary, or at least helpful to accomplishing one of Congress’ two purposes: avoiding federal support for discriminators ''and'' protecting individual citizens from discrimination. Private suits make this second purpose easier to implement.
#  This question is not left to states because the federal government is primarily responsible for protecting against [[discrimination]].
The Court also recognized that while this new source of financial liability might affect universities badly, it was up to Congress to weigh that concern.

==Dissent==
A dissenting opinion by Justice [[Lewis F. Powell, Jr.|Powell]] raised [[separation of powers]] concerns. He called the Court's decision legislation, noting that Congress knew how to make judicial remedies, and saying that three of the four factors invited judicial lawmaking&amp;mdash;only the second factor, he argued, was really about congressional intent. Powell contended that the Court's decision would encourage Congress to be lax in their duty to create laws, expecting democratically unaccountable judges to do the job for them.

'''City Year''' is an education nonprofit organization founded in 1988 dedicated to helping students and schools succeed. The organization partners with public schools in 29 high-need communities across the U.S. and through international affiliates in the U.K. and Johannesburg, South Africa. City Year teams are made up of 18 to 24 year olds, who provide student, classroom, and whole school support, intended to help students stay in school and on track to graduate high school. City Year is a member of the [[AmeriCorps]] national service network, and is supported by the [[Corporation for National and Community Service]], school district partnerships, and private philanthropy from corporations, foundations and individuals.

==History==
City Year was founded in 1988 by [[Michael Brown (City Year)|Michael Brown]] and [[Alan Khazei]], then-roommates at Harvard Law School, who felt strongly that young people in service could be a powerful resource for addressing America's most pressing issues. They built City Year with the conviction that one person can make a difference. Since its inception, City Year has promoted the vision of service as a common expectation – and a real opportunity – for citizens all around the world.

City Year AmeriCorps members initially focused their efforts on community rehabilitation, beautification of neighborhoods, and developing community awareness in [[Boston]]. Over the years, the organization has expanded, opening sites in 28 cities throughout the U.S., and refocused its mission to help students in under-served schools reach their full potential and graduate from high school.

Inspired by a visit with City Year during his 1992 presidential campaign, [[Bill Clinton]] enlisted the help of Michael Brown, Alan Khazei and others to establish [[AmeriCorps]] through the National and Community Service Trust Act of 1993. Since then, more than 1 million AmeriCorps members have contributed upwards of 1.2 billion hours of public service. All AmeriCorps members, originally conceived as unpaid volunteers in service, are now paid a stipend by the federal government through the [[Corporation for National and Community Service]] and subsequently through a variety of matching grants, including the Segal AmeriCorps Education Award. City Year, along with thousands of other nonprofit organizations, is a member of the AmeriCorps network, a program of the Corporation for National and Community Service.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

In early 2005, City Year opened its first international site in [[South Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cityyear.org.za/about-us/|title=About Us|date=2015-11-06|work=City Year South Africa|access-date=2017-10-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second international affiliate, City Year London based in [[London, England]], followed in 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cityyear.org/about-us/international-affiliates/city-year-uk|title=City Year UK {{!}} City Year|website=www.cityyear.org|language=en|access-date=2017-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; with City Year Birmingham and City Year Greater Manchester opening in the U.K. in 2013 and 2015, respectively.

In 2012, City Year announced its Long Term Impact (LTI) goal to dramatically increase the number of students on track to graduation, reaching the majority of off-track students in each of its communities, and expanding to cities and schools that produce two-thirds of the nation's urban dropouts.[[City Year#cite note-2|&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt;]] Based on national research from Johns Hopkins University and City Year's analysis of existing markets, roughly 15 to 20 percent of schools are producing the majority of the dropouts within urban school districts. This degree of concentration enables City Year AmeriCorps members to have an outsized impact on the graduation pipeline in each of their cities, while deploying to a relatively small number of schools. The goal of the strategy is to significantly increase graduation rates and college and career readiness in high-need urban schools by ensuring that 80 percent of students served by City Year reach the tenth grade on time and on track to graduate. City Year AmeriCorps members function as a "human capital resource" in under-resourced elementary, middle and high schools, working with off-track students and students at risk for falling off track to provide targeted academic and social-emotional interventions aimed at improving the number of high school graduates.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

==Full-time school based service==
[[Image:CityYearformation1.jpg|thumb|left|City Year AmeriCorps members in Boston's Copley Square]]
City Year AmeriCorps members commit to 11 months of service, leadership development and civic engagement, serving as tutors, mentors and role models in high-need schools. City Year responds to the challenges facing public education by providing Whole School&lt;s&gt;,&lt;/s&gt; Whole Child (WSWC) services in high-need education institutions across the country. These services are rooted in using data to monitor student progress to better meet student needs, engaging in one-on-one and small group instruction in ELA and math with embedded social-emotional supports, establishing whole school activities that improve conditions for learning along with engaging families and inspiring civic engagement. City Year also provides extended-day activities: after-school programming, homework assistance, enrichment curricula and civic projects that build and serve communities.

City Year AmeriCorps members are supervised by full-time, on site City Year staff called Impact Managers and these corps members and staff become integrated into the fabric of the school community. They collaborate with the school principal and teachers to deliver holistic, data-driven interventions at the individual student, classroom and school-wide levels that help the school achieve its vision for educational excellence.

City Year also provides small group social-emotional skill building sessions, additional capacity in the classroom and classroom management support. City Year helps to close gaps in high-need schools by providing students with personalized support and additional developmental relationships while also providing schools with increased capacity to implement research-based reforms.

City Year's model is based on research indicating that students who are at greatest risk of dropping out can be identified as early as in the sixth grade. City Year AmeriCorps members make positive connections with students, encourage them to come to school every day, and provide evidence-based academic supports for students who exhibit one or more ''early warning indicators'': low attendance, poor behavior or course failure in English or math. Research shows that preventing one or more of these warning signs makes it three times more likely that a student will graduate, dramatically improving his or her lifetime trajectory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nga.org/files/live/sites/NGA/files/pdf/1110EARLYDROPBALFANZ.PDF|title=Early Warning Systems – Foundational Research and Lessons from the Field|last=Balfanz|first=R|last2=J|first2=Fox|date=October 2011|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2017 – 2018 academic year, more than 3,000 City Year AmeriCorps members are serving approximately 223,000 students in 329 schools nationwide.

==The corps==
City Year [[AmeriCorps]] members represent a diverse array of racial, ethnic, religious and educational backgrounds. Approximately 80% of corps members are recent college graduates, 56% are people of color, 48% are Pell Grant eligible, 42% are fluent or conversational in a second language and 25% are first generation college students.

AmeriCorps members begin their service year in the summertime, undergoing several weeks of intensive training before the beginning of the school year. During this training, corps members are oriented to City Year culture and trained on how to work within schools. They are assigned to serve on a team at a particular school, where they will work for the duration of their service year.

Like other AmeriCorps members, City Year corps members receive a biweekly living allowance, or modest stipend. City Year AmeriCorps also receive health insurance benefits and qualify for a post-service Segal Education Award&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nationalservice.gov/programs/americorps/alumni/segal-americorps-education-award|title=Segal AmeriCorps Education Award|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; through AmeriCorps. Additionally, City Year has local partnerships in all cities that offer benefits such as public transit passes and discounts to local businesses just for City Year AmeriCorps members.

==Leadership development==
City Year has developed a comprehensive approach to leadership development designed to ensure AmeriCorps member success at City Year, and in whatever field City Year alumni choose to enter after their year of service. City Year was founded on the belief that a year of service transforms both the community being served and the individual providing that service. City Year recognizes that the development of new skills and knowledge is crucial, but there are also some deeper questions that need to be explored in the journey of leadership development.

==Uniform==
City Year AmeriCorps members wear a distinctive uniform&lt;s&gt;,&lt;/s&gt; issued by the organization – a red jacket worn with black pants. City Year sites located in California wear yellow jackets due to pre-existing gang associations with the color red in the communities in which they serve.

Prominent members of a community in which City Year serves and key supporters who have acted as major advocates or champions of the organization are often gifted with their own red jacket. This honor, over time, has led to the creation of [http://www.redjacketsociety.org/about/ City Year’s Red Jacket Society]. The Red Jacket Society is a community of philanthropic individuals and families who believe in the power of the red jacket, which is founded in national service and a commitment to others.

{{quote|Red Jacket Society members believe that the red jacket is more than a uniform: it's a little bit of magic. It brings hope and inspiration, caring and support. The red jacket means help is on the way.}}

==United States funding==
City Year's funding comes from a variety of sources. In [null 2017, 23% of the organization's operating revenue came from] [[AmeriCorps]], 54% from corporations, foundations and individual donors, and 23% from school districts and other local government grants. [1]

==Sponsors==
City Year was started with private funding and still maintains many of its efforts via gifts from organizations as National Leadership Sponsors and Team Sponsors.

City Year's National Partners work side by side with City Year lending their time, expertise and resources to support the mission of increasing the high school graduation rate. These investments can take many different forms and are allocated to programs and initiatives that align with the partners' and City Year's priorities. City Year National Leadership Sponsors include: [http://www.adobe.com/corporate-responsibility/community.html Adobe Foundation], [[Aramark]], [https://www.cityyear.org/support-us/partner-us/corporate-partnerships/national-partners/att AT&amp;T], [https://www.cityyear.org/support-us/partner-us/corporate-partnerships/national-partners/bain-capital Bain Capital], [https://www.cityyear.org/support-us/partner-us/corporate-partnerships/national-partners/bank-america Bank of America], [https://www.cityyear.org/celanese-foundation Celanese Foundation], [[Cisco Systems|Cisco Foundation]], [https://www.cityyear.org/support-us/partner-us/corporate-partnerships/national-partners/comcast-nbcuniversal Comcast NBCUniversal], [https://www.cityyear.org/support-us/partner-us/corporate-partnerships/national-partners/csx-transportation CSX Transportation], [https://www.cityyear.org/support-us/partner-us/corporate-partnerships/national-partners/deloitte Deloitte], [https://www.cityyear.org/new-york-life New York Life Foundation], [https://www.cityyear.org/support-us/partner-us/corporate-partnerships/national-partners/microsoft Microsoft],  [https://www.cityyear.org/support-us/partner-us/corporate-partnerships/national-partners/pepsico-foundation PepsiCo Foundation] and [https://www.rednoseday.com/ Red Nose Day].

==Schools==
Public school districts partner with City Year to bring teams of AmeriCorps member to work in schools. Though it varies from district to district, schools are responsible for financing a portion of the cost of maintaining a team of City Year AmeriCorps members in service.

==Care Force==
Care Force is a part of City Year specifically created to engage corporations and their employees in high-impact volunteer events to help improve schools and communities.

Care Force has helped to craft and lead volunteer experiences that have become an integral component of corporate partners' community service outreach, and inspired employees to want to serve again and again. Whether painting inspirational murals in a school hallway or transforming an unused space into a library; Care Force events physically transform the spaces where children and communities grow.

Since launching in 2001, Care Force has led more than 90,000 volunteers in service projects and managed more than 600 events, and worked in over 130 communities in 10 countries over three continents.

==Awards==
City Year is a five-time winner of the Social Capitalist award from the Fast Company Monitor group.[[City Year#cite note-5Fast-12|&lt;sup&gt;[8]&lt;/sup&gt;]] City Year has received positive reviews from the ''[[Princeton Review]]'' and the ''[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]'', and has earned four stars from the organization, [[Charity Navigator]].[[City Year#cite note-CYAwards-13|&lt;sup&gt;[9]&lt;/sup&gt;]] City Year was also named to the Philanthropy 400, an annual ranking of America's nonprofits based on the contributions they raise from individuals, foundations, and corporations by the ''Chronicle of Philanthropy'', in 2015 and 2016.

==Criticism==
City Year has been accused of exploiting its volunteers by demanding long hours of taxing work, while providing an inadequate stipend.[[City Year#cite note-15|&lt;sup&gt;[11]&lt;/sup&gt;]] The organization has also been criticized by some for accepting a [[Sponsor (commercial)|sponsorship]] from the [[Soft drinks|soft drink]] manufacturer PepsiCo. Because City Year Corps members are [[role model]]s to many children, this partnership might encourage greater consumption of soft drinks, which some see problematic in light of the current national woes with [[childhood obesity]].[[City Year#cite note-PepsiCriticism-14|&lt;sup&gt;[10]&lt;/sup&gt;]]

==City Year South Africa==
In 2001 at a conference on civil society in [[Cape Town]], U.S. President [[Bill Clinton]] brought a delegation of City Year Service Leaders and staff from Boston, to meet with former President [[Nelson Mandela]]. Mandela was eager to implement a programme in [[South Africa]] that afforded young people the opportunity to serve their communities. He loved the idea of City Year and after further conversations; City Year's first international site was launched in 2005 with 110 Service Leaders in Johannesburg.

City Year brings together a diverse group of young people for a year of voluntary service and leadership development. These young people work in teams as tutors, mentors and role models to children in 10 primary schools throughout [[Johannesburg]] and [[Soweto]]. City Year South Africa works to support the growing National Youth Service movement, with a strong belief that youth service is a powerful vehicle for developing a generation of young leaders for South Africa, promoting a culture of service across all sectors of society, addressing critical development needs in schools and communities, and addressing youth unemployment.

City Year South Africa provides a rigorous year of full-time community service, leadership development and skills training to young South African volunteers (Service Leaders).

Since its inception in 2005 City Year South Africa has graduated over 1,200 Service Leaders who engaged over 20,000 children through after-school programs and various other projects. In total these Service Leaders have completed over 1 million hours of service.

==City Year London==
City Year launched in London during the 2010/11 academic year with 60 corps members working in teams across six primary schools. For the start of the 2011/12 school year City Year had 81 corps members serving across nine schools.[[City Year#cite note-16|&lt;sup&gt;[12]&lt;/sup&gt;]]

Since the 2010 general election, City Year London has met with range of Members of Parliament, government ministers, and Prime Minister David Cameron to champion service opportunities for young people across the UK.[[City Year#cite note-17|&lt;sup&gt;[13]&lt;/sup&gt;]]

In 2012 City Year London was awarded a Social Action Fund grant of £300,000 by the Government's Cabinet Office, which has gone towards the expansion of City Year's service across London and the development of three new school partnerships from September 2012.[[City Year#cite note-18|&lt;sup&gt;[14]&lt;/sup&gt;]]

===Leadership development===
As part of their year of service, City Year London corps members benefit from a year-long leadership development programme which is delivered by the organisation's corporate sponsors every Friday. Leadership development days help corps members to develop skills and competencies to be successful in securing a job after City Year. This includes CV and interview guidance, work-shadowing, networking sessions, public speaking and presentation skills training. Each corps member is also matched with a corporate mentor.[[City Year#cite note-19|&lt;sup&gt;[15]&lt;/sup&gt;]] 95% of corps members who graduated from the 2011/12 City Year London programme successfully secured a place in education or employment after City Year.[[City Year#cite note-20|&lt;sup&gt;[16]&lt;/sup&gt;]]

===IVR evaluation===
An evaluation of City Year London's work in schools was conducted by the Institute for Volunteering Research in November 2012. It found that corps members were having a positive effect on the attainment, behaviour and focus of school children and that teachers valued the help and support they received from corps members in the classroom. The evaluation also highlighted a boost in confidence and the employability of City Year corps members who have completed the programme.[[City Year#cite note-21|&lt;sup&gt;[17]&lt;/sup&gt;]]

===The London Corps===
City Year London recruits a diverse corps to reflect the diversity of the children it works with. City Year is currently recruiting 18- to 25-year-old corps members from colleges, universities and youth centres across London and the rest of the UK. The organisation recruits a diversity of young people into the corps based on: socio-economic status, eligibility for Free School Meals, type of secondary education (e.g., public or private), educational attainment, gender and ethnicity. Approximately 60% of City Year London's current corps members are graduates while 40% are college leavers.

====Private Equity Foundation====
The Private Equity Foundation helped to bring City Year from America to London in 2010. The Chief Executive of the Private Equity Foundation, Shaks Ghosh visited City Year in Boston in 2009 and was so impressed by its 'double benefit' model that she donated £1 million to help start up City Year in London. The Private Equity Foundation is City Year London's Lead Founding Partner.&lt;ref&gt;Private Equity Foundation press.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Completeschool.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Complete School Package|{{deletable image-caption|1=Thursday, 30 July 2009}}]] --&gt;

'''Complete School''' is an educational product aimed at [[High school|secondary or high school]] students studying [[Mathematics]] or [[English language|English]]. It is the third title by Australian educational self-publisher Michael Milford and was first released in May 2006 around [[Australia]].

==Target Audience==

Like the previous two titles by the publisher, Complete School is aimed at the secondary or high school market. However it is broader in scope and contains material aimed at younger secondary school students as well as the older students, unlike previous titles which have focussed only on the older students. It also attempts to cover both the English and Mathematics high school subjects.

==Details==

The Complete School package is made up of two major components - [[textbook]]s and a [[DVD]], although it also contains an A2 poster. Each textbook is just under 600 pages and contains text and grayscale illustrations. The DVD contains 16 video tutorials making up just over two hours of video. The poster is grayscale and contains text and illustrations.

==Background==

The foundation for Complete School was established in 2000 with the publication of the book ''Not a C Minus: A Guide to Surviving Mathematics B''. This book featured "a conversational style" and was intended as a supplement study aide to the conventional school mathematics textbooks [http://www.completeschool.com.au/images/media/Sunday_Mail_14_01_2001_sm.jpg]. With some media coverage but no paid advertising the book went on to sell a little over 4000 copies around Australia and internationally over the next 3 years.

''Not a C Minus'' was followed by ''Painless Physics'', which was intended as a study aide for high school students of [[Physics]]. It has sold a little over 1000 copies around Australia since its release in mid-2002.

The positive public response from students for these two titles led to the commencement of the Complete School project in 2004. After a two-year development period it entered production in March 2006. After two months of production it entered the Australian marketplace on May 16.

==Methodologies==

The educational style in Complete School (and the previous two titles) differs from that found in a conventional textbook in several ways. The text is generally more conversational and colloquial than a standard textbook. This has both advantages and disadvantages; students may feel more comfortable due to the style but the lack of orthodox language and terms may restrict a student's ability to function in more formal environments.

The package also has relatively few questions. Compared to normal Mathematics textbooks which may have several dozen if not hundreds of questions per topic, Complete School only has one or two. These questions are more akin to the fully worked examples in conventional textbooks than the numbered lists of questions usually found at the end of a topic. This structure means there is a lack of questions for students to practice on, but does allow a lot more content to be fit into one product.

The topics covered in Complete School are more controversial than those found in a standard textbook. These topics include several types of [[gambling]], nuclear weapons, and subtle manipulation techniques, which some parents may find objectionable. The author reasons that they are practical real-life examples or skills.

Complete School also covers several non-traditional textbook topics such as Internet research, exam technique, and word processing software, although these topics are mostly covered on the video DVD.

==Production and Economics ==

Complete School was produced through the [[China|Chinese]] [[Printer (publisher)|printing]] company Everbest in early 2006. The initial production run comprised 1000 units. The product was produced in China because of the significantly cheaper labour and material costs available in that country compared to in the [[United States]] or Australia. This introduced additional steps into the production process including content clearance with the Chinese government and international freight.

The package's current recommended retail price is $79.95. Standard Australian single textbooks typically cost around $60.

'''DIVO''' (Digital Interactive Video Online), is an [[active learning]] education project, incorporating creativity and [[Information technology|ICTs]]. The project uses participant centred, creative digital video dialogue, and aims to promote inter-cultural understanding and peer-led learning between remote groups who are unable to meet face-to-face.

The DIVO project uses digital video to augment online dialogue between remote groups. Groups of young people record and exchange short digital films based on common themes, which are shared via a website. The films are viewed and the issues contained are discussed and explored on and offline and new films are created and shared in response. DIVO is designed to be used to promote and support dialogue in formal and informal educational contexts, including inter-cultural understanding in support of [[Key Stage]]s 3 and 4, since learning how to use digital interactive video creatively is coupled with the development of teamwork and negotiation skills. The project aims to puts media creation in the hands of participants, offering them the opportunity to experiment with a medium they are only likely to have experienced as consumers.

==Background==
In 2004, the DIVO project bought together two groups of girls: socially and economically marginalised young women from an Islamic community in [[Ghana]] and students from Elizabeth Garrett Anderson School for Girls in [[London]], UK.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/values/communityprojects/story/0,14333,1166426,00.html&lt;/ref&gt; The project facilitated a cultural exchange based on [[gender]] issues faced by participants in the groups. The two groups created and responded to each other's films. Dialogues formed through the process have continued to develop beyond the initial life of the pilot project.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} The pilot phase was funded by the [[British Council]], the [[British High Commission]] and [[Guardian Newspapers Limited]].

A 20-min project documentary was made about the project, which has been recognised by selection in a number of international human rights film festivals{{which|date=September 2014}} and screens regularly on the [[Community Channel (UK)|Community Channel]] in the UK.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

===Methodology===
The methodology of DIVO comes from the combination of the creative application of technology with peer-led, participant-centred teaching techniques. Emphasis is placed on the process of generating media clips as well as the media clips themselves. In order to create a dialogue, groups need to digest what they have viewed and examine this against their existing knowledge before proceeding to generate more media and develop their response. DIVO is intended to operate as a multilateral dialogue between many groups and offer flexibility of access and timing.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3240">{{short description|International minimum standard for a person professionally leading a group of certified recreational divers}}
'''Dive leader''' describes the minimum requirements for dive leader training and certification for [[Recreational diving|recreational scuba divers]] in international standard ISO 24801-3 &lt;ref name=" ISO24801-3" /&gt; and the equivalent European Standard EN 14153-3. Various organizations offer training that meets the requirements of the dive leader standard.

Scuba dive leaders are considered competent to plan, organise and conduct dives and to lead other recreational divers on open water dives, and for specialised recreational scuba diving activities for which they have been trained. They are also considered competent to conduct emergency procedures associated with these activities and the relevant diving environment. They may require orientation for unfamiliar local environmental conditions. Additional specialised training and experience is required to lead divers on more demanding dives.&lt;ref name="EUF certification" /&gt;

The term is also used by BSAC for a specific certification.&lt;ref name="BSAC dive leader"/&gt;

==Scope of the standard==
International standard ISO 24801-3 includes:&lt;ref name=" ISO24801-3" /&gt;
*Prerequisites for training, including age and health requirements,
*Required theoretical knowledge regarding scuba and basic diving equipment, the basic physics of diving, decompression management and dive planning, medical and psychological problems related to diving, the diving environment and the use of nitrox breathing gases,
*Required scuba skills in confined and open water,
*Practical training parameters,
*Evaluation of knowledge and practical skills.

==Training according to ISO 24801-3==
Diver qualifications which comply with ISO 24801-3

==Medical fitness to dive==
{{main|Fitness to dive}}
Before initial diver training and thereafter at regular intervals, a diver should undergo a [[fitness to dive]] examination by a diving doctor. This may be considered more important for a dive leader who has a duty of care to their clients. In some countries, such an examination is required by law and it is a prerequisite for any training in many diving schools.

'''Einstein Gravity in a Nutshell''' is a [[textbook]] by [[Anthony Zee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/820123453|title=Einstein gravity in a nutshell|last=A.|first=Zee,|isbn=9780691145587|location=Princeton|oclc=820123453}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Response ==
Michael Berg said in a review in the [[Mathematical Association of America]], "I must admit that, as its [[Quantum Field Theory in a nutshell|nutshell predecessor]], ''Einstein Gravity in a Nutshell'' is very appealing to me, and I am certainly won over by Zee’s chatty but on-the-money style".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.maa.org/press/maa-reviews/einstein-gravity-in-a-nutshell|title=Einstein Gravity in a Nutshell {{!}} Mathematical Association of America|website=www.maa.org|access-date=2017-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Luboš Motl]] said about the book on his blog ''The Reference Frame'': "Anthony is more playful and less formal but there are aspects in which he gets further than any other introductory textbook of GR. The book is full of notes, a long index, and simply clever exercises. The illustrations are pretty and professional [...] I recommend you once again to try the book".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://motls.blogspot.com/2013/05/anthony-zee-einstein-gravity-in-nutshell.html|title=Anthony Zee: Einstein Gravity in a Nutshell|website=The Reference Frame|access-date=2017-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pedro G. Ferreira]], professor at the [[University of Oxford]] called it "a remarkably complete and thorough textbook on general relativity, written in a refreshing and engaging style. Zee leads us through all the major intellectual steps that make what is surely one of the most profound and beautiful theories of all time. The book is enjoyable and informative in equal measure. Quite an achievement."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://press.princeton.edu/titles/10038.html|title=Einstein Gravity in a Nutshell|website=Princeton University Press|language=en|access-date=2017-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Escuela Brasil''', or Escuela N° 17 Brasil, or Escuela "República del Brasil", is a public elementary school located in the [[barrio]] of [[Pocitos]] in [[Montevideo]], [[Uruguay]].

==History==
The original building was designed and constructed by architect Americo Maini in 1908.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.montevideo.gub.uy/ciudad/arquitectura/edificios-y-espacios-calificados/cronologia-de-algunas-de-las-principales-obras- |title=Cronología de algunas de las principales obras arquitectónicas de Montevideo |author=Intendencia Municipal de Montevideo |date=22 March 2010 |accessdate=17 March 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120514052110/http://www.montevideo.gub.uy/ciudad/arquitectura/edificios-y-espacios-calificados/cronologia-de-algunas-de-las-principales-obras- |archivedate=14 May 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was founded in 1885 and originally located on 85 Gabriel Pereira Street.  It shared the premises with Escuela No. 18 – Noruega (School No. 18 [[Norway]]).  In 1904 the government bought the parcel of land located on what was then  Avenida de los Pocitos (Avenue of the Pocitos) and is now called Avenida Brasil (Brazil Avenue).  On November 15, 1927 the school was named Brazil.  From 1949 until 2002 the school shared the premises with Escuela No. 71 Baron de Rio Branco (School No. 71).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tagzania.com/pt/escuela-brasil-no-17-montevi/ |author=Tagzania |title=Escuela Brasil No. 17 (Montevideo, R. O. del Uruguay)|accessdate=20 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Since 1993 it had been considered a building of local interest and in 2002 was declared a National Heritage Site by resolution 1.448/002 of the Ministry of Education and Culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.montevideo.gub.uy/sites/default/files/articulo/guia_arquitectonica_y_urbanistica_cuarta_edicion.pdf |title=Guía arquitectónica y urbanística (27 MB pdf) page 317 |author=Intendencia Municipal de Montevideo |accessdate=17 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The design and in particular its tiled roof, main entrance and its railings are an outstanding example of modernist architecture, which is quite common in Pocitos.

The main entrance of the old building is on Avenida Brasil 2963, while the school occupies most of the block between streets Avenida Brasil, 26 de Marzo and José Martí. Behind the left wing of the original building has been annexed a building originally designed with 3 levels, of which only 2 levels were constructed. The annex was designed to expand the leasable capacity of this institution. With the same purpose, architect Marcelo de Vita projected classrooms for temporary use in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://marcelodevitaarquitecto.wordpress.com/ |title=Escuela N° 17 Brasil (Salones Provisorios) |author= (wordpress) |accessdate=8 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://picasaweb.google.com/ebrasil69ax/EscuelaN17BrasilAnexo# |title=Escuela N° 17 Brasil (Anexo) |author=Escuela Brasil (picasa albums) |accessdate=17 March 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106212800/http://picasaweb.google.com/ebrasil69ax/EscuelaN17BrasilAnexo |archivedate=6 November 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time and by the same architect, the gym was designed, which was built after the construction of the annexed building along with two accesses from Jose Marti street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://escuelabrasil1969.wordpress.com/ |title=Escuela N° 17 Brasil (Gimnasio) |author= (wordpress) |accessdate=8 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Red Knot from The Crossley ID Guide Eastern Birds.jpg|thumb|A species plate from ''The Crossley ID Guide: Eastern Birds'', illustrating different plumages of the [[red knot]]]]
A '''field guide''' is a [[book]] designed to help the reader identify [[wildlife]] (plants or animals) or other objects of natural occurrence (e.g. [[mineral]]s). It is generally designed to be brought into the 'field' or local area where such objects exist to help distinguish between similar objects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.library.illinois.edu/bix/fieldguides/index.html The International Field Guides Database]. Diane Schmidt. Accessed September 2, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Field guides are often designed to help users distinguish animals and plants that may be similar in appearance but are not necessarily closely related.

It will typically include a description of the objects covered, together with paintings or photographs and an index. More serious and scientific field identification books, including those intended for students, will probably include [[identification key]]s to assist with identification, but the publicly accessible field guide is more often a browsable picture guide organized by family, colour, shape, location or other descriptors.

==History==
Popular interests in identifying things in nature probably were strongest in bird and plant guides. Perhaps the first popular field guide to plants in the United States was the 1893 ''How to Know the Wildflowers'' by "Mrs. William Starr Dana" ([[Frances Theodora Parsons]]).{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} In 1890, [[Florence Augusta Merriam Bailey|Florence Merriam]] published ''Birds Through an Opera-Glass'', describing 70 common species.  Focused on living birds observed in the field, the book is considered the first in the tradition of modern, illustrated bird guides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Barrow|first=Mark V.|title=A Passion for Birds: American Ornithology after Audubon|date=1998|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|location=Princeton, NJ|isbn=9780691044026|pp=156–157}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1902, now writing as Florence Merriam Bailey (having married the zoologist [[Vernon Orlando Bailey|Vernon Bailey]]), she published ''Handbook of Birds of the Western United States''.  By contrast, the ''Handbook'' is designed as a comprehensive reference for the lab rather a portable book for the field. It was arranged by [[taxonomic order]] and had clear descriptions of [[species]] size, distribution, feeding, and nesting habits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kofalk|first=Harriet|title=No Woman Tenderfoot: Florence Merriam Bailey, Pioneer Naturalist|date=1989|publisher=[[Texas A&amp;M University Press]]|location=College Station, TX|isbn=0-89096-378-9|pp=103–104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From this point into the 1930s, features of field guides were introduced by [[Chester A. Reed]] and others such as changing the size of the book to fit the pocket, including colour plates, and producing guides in uniform editions that covered subjects such as garden and woodland flowers, mushrooms, insects, and dogs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dunlap|first=Thomas R.|title=In the Field, Among the Feathered: A History of Birders &amp; Their Guides|date=2011|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|location=New York, NY|isbn=9780199734597|pp=43–44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1934, [[Roger Tory Peterson]], using his fine skill as an artist, changed the way modern field guides approached identification. Using color plates with paintings of similar species together – and marked with arrows showing the differences – people could use his bird guide in the field to compare species quickly to make identification easier. This technique, the "[[Peterson Identification System]]", was used in most of Peterson's Field Guides from [[animal tracks]] to [[seashell]]s and has been widely adopted by other publishers and authors as well.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

Today, each field guide has its own range, focus and organization.  Specialist publishers such as Croom Helm, along with organisations like the [[Audubon Society]],  the [[RSPB]], the [[Field Studies Council]], [[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]], [[HarperCollins]], and many others all produce quality field guides.

==Principles==

It is somewhat difficult to generalise about how field guides are intended to be used, because this varies from one guide to another, partly depending on how expert the targeted reader is expected to be.

For general public use, the main function of a field guide is to help the reader identify a bird, plant, rock, butterfly or other natural object down to at least the popular naming level. To this end some field guides employ simple keys and other techniques: the reader is usually encouraged to scan illustrations looking for a match, and to compare similar-looking choices using information on their differences. Guides are often designed to first lead readers to the appropriate section of the book, where the choices are not so overwhelming in number.

Guides for students often introduce the concept of [[identification key]]s. Plant field guides such as ''Newcomb's Wildflower Guide'' (which is limited in scope to the wildflowers of northeastern North America) frequently have an abbreviated key that helps limit the search.&lt;ref name=Newcomb&gt;{{cite book|last1=Newcomb|first1=Lawrence|title=Newcomb's Wildflower Guide|date=1977|publisher=[[Little, Brown and Company]]|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-316-60442-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Insect guides tend to limit identification to Order or Family levels rather than individual species, due to their diversity.

Many taxa show variability and it is often difficult to capture the constant features using a small number of photographs. Illustrations by artists or post processing of photographs help in emphasising specific features needed to for reliable identification. Peterson introduced the idea of lines to point to these key features. He also noted the advantages of illustrations over photographs:

{{quote|A drawing can do much more than a photograph to emphasize the field marks. A photograph is a record of a fleeting instant; a drawing is a composite of the artist's experience. The artist can edit out, show field marks to best advantage, and delete unnecessary clutter. He can choose position and stress basic color and pattern unmodified by transitory light and shade. ... The artist has more options and far more control .... Whereas a photograph can have a living immediacy a good drawing is really more instructive.  (This passage was written not by Roger Tory Peterson, but by his wife, Virginia Marie Peterson, in the preface to one of Peterson's field guides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Peterson|first1=Roger Tory|title=A Field Guide to the Birds: Eastern and Central North America|date=1989|publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt]]|pages=xi}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This passage was also quoted by Law and Lynch (1988).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Lists, Field Guides, and the Descriptive Organization of Seeing: Birdwatching as an Exemplary Observational Activity|author1=Law, John  |author2=Michael Lynch|journal= Human Studies|volume= 11|issue= 2/3|date=1988|pages=271–303}}&lt;/ref&gt;)}}

Field guides aid in improving the state of knowledge of various taxa. By making the knowledge of experienced museum specialists available to amateurs, they increase the gathering of information by amateurs from a wider geographic area and increasing the communication of these findings to the specialists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Pearson, D.

'''Higher Computing''', [[Scottish Qualifications Authority|SQA]] course code ''C206 12'', is a qualification taught in Scottish [[secondary schools]], usually in the fifth or sixth year of study (S5/S6). Candidates usually progress into Higher Computing with a pass at [[National 5]], previously [[Intermediate 2]] or [[Standard Grade]] (credit).

The course consists of three units: two mandatory units and one optional unit selected by the centre. The required units are [[Computer Systems]] ''(DF2X 12)'' and [[Software Development]] ''(DF2Y 12)'' and the optional units are [[Computer Networking]] ''(DF30 12)'', [[Artificial Intelligence]] ''(DF31 12)'' and [[multimedia|Multimedia Technology]] ''(DF32 12)''.&lt;ref&gt;''SQA: Arrangements for Computing (Higher)'', page 2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assessment==
Candidates are assessed on both practical and theory work. In October, the SQA issues a coursework task to centres which candidates will attempt between November and March. The task is split into two parts:
1.A programming task
and 2.An investigation related to hardware and software studied in the Computer Systems unit.

As with most SQA qualifications, candidates sit for a written exam in May/June. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sqa.org.uk/sqa/56924.html|website=SQA}}&lt;/ref&gt;This is split into two sections. Section I is worth 20 marks and contains short response questions, while section II involves more in-depth answers and is worth a total of 70 marks.

Therefore, candidates can receive up to 150 marks. The grade is then worked out as follows:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Grade
! Band
! Percentage
! Marks
|-
| rowspan=2 | A
| 1
| ≥75
| ≥113
|-

| rowspan=2 | B
| 3
| 65-69
| 98-104
|-

|-
| D
| 7
| 45-49
| 68-74
|-
| No Award
| 8
| &lt;45
| &lt;90
|}

Note: In some years the criteria for these grades may change to reflect the difficulty of the exam.

==Units==
All three optional units are assigned 50 marks in the final exam.

===Computer Systems===

The [[Individuals with Disabilities Education Act]] is [[United States federal law]] enacted in 1990 that governs how states and public agencies provide [[Early childhood intervention|early intervention]], [[Special education in the United States|special education]], and related services to children with [[Disability|disabilities]].  In the state of [[Hawaii]], along with similar state-level legislation, it has been implemented in an Early Intervention program for qualifying children.

==Early Intervention: for Children Under the Age 3==
Early Intervention is a federal and state-mandated program that provides services to support the development of infant and toddlers from birth to three years of age.  In Hawaii, Early Intervention is managed by the [[Hawaii Department of Health|Department of Health.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hawaii.gov/health/family-child-health/eis/index.html|title=Hawaii State Department of Health|website=www.hawaii.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==After Age Three==
Under current regulations, Early Intervention services cease when a child turns 3 years old.  Instead, Early Intervention children are required on their 3rd birthday to attend a Special Education Preschool that is run by the [[Hawai'i Department of Education|Hawaii Department of Education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://doe.k12.hi.us/specialeducation/preschoolsped.htm|title=State of Hawaii - Special Education|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''I'''ndividuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) allows States to extend Early Intervention services to eligible children who are between 3 and 5 years of age.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.access.gpo.gov/uscode/title20/chapter33_subchapteri_.html (IDEA)]&lt;/ref&gt; This option maximizes parental choice, as it allows each parent to decide which option best meets the educational needs of their disabled child.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/cf/20USCodeSec1435.pdf|title=20 US Code Section 1435|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The State of Hawaii is considering legislation that would extend Early Intervention services to eligible children who are between 3 and 5 years of age. In 2007, those bills are House Bill 531 and Senate Bill 1176.

==Legislation Related to Early Intervention in Hawaii==
'''2007 Session'''

*[[Hawaii House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]: House Bill 531 &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.capitol.hawaii.gov/site1/docs/getstatus.asp?query=HB531&amp;currpage=1&amp;showstatus=on&amp;showtext=on&amp;showcommrpt=on&amp;press1=docs House Bill 531 ]&lt;/ref&gt;    amends early intervention services law to be consistent with the reauthorized [[IDEA 2004|Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act of 2004]].
*[[Hawaii Senate|Senate]]: Senate Bill 1176&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.capitol.hawaii.gov/site1/docs/getstatus.asp?query=SB1176&amp;currpage=1&amp;showstatus=on&amp;showtext=on&amp;showcommrpt=on&amp;press1=docs Senate Bill 1176 ]&lt;/ref&gt; amends early intervention services law to be consistent with the reauthorized Individuals with Disabilities Education Act of 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-7562690005008383463&amp;hl=en Video] of Senate Committee on Health hearing from 5 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3145">In the context of [[E-learning|e-Learning]], [[interactivity]] is defined as "the function of input required by the learner while responding to the [[computer]], the analysis of those responses by the computer, and the nature of the action by the computer." &lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Sims|first=R.|title="Interactivity: A forgotten art?" in Computers in Human Behavior |url=http://www2.gsu.edu/~wwwitr/docs/interact/|year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Variables of Interactivity ==
There are two variables describing the interactivity of a given lesson: technology affordance and user freedom.  Technology affordance, also known as manual operators,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Chen|first=M.|title="A methodology for characterizing computer-based learning environments" in Instructional Science|year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the richness of the communication between the [[student]] and the [[Teacher|instructor]], usually expressed in terms of the input and output channels.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last1=Helfrich|first1=J.|last2=Moulton|first2=S.|title="Leveraging interactivity to increase e-learning effectiveness" in Proceedings of World Conference on E-Learning in Corporate, Government, Healthcare, and Higher Education 2009|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  User freedom, on the other hand, is a function of the degree of freedom the learning system grants the student in influencing the presentation of the lesson.

=== Technology Affordance ===
[[Technology]] affordance in the [[E-learning|e-Learning]] is a function of the capabilities of available computer [[I/O device]]s, having a tendency to evolve as new [[Input (computer science)|input]] and [[Output (computing)|output]] devices become obtainable.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Jonassen|first=D.|title=Instructional Designs for Microcomputer Courseware|year=1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are five levels of technology affordance interactivity:
# ''Immersion'' is full sensory immersion commonly called [[virtual reality]].&lt;ref&gt;Sims, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Video game]]s are the closest approximation we have to immersion today.
# ''Text'' Allowing the student to communicate through arbitrary textual input and output.  A [[Google]] [[search box]] or a [[discussion board]] interaction are examples of text level interactivity.
# ''Voice'' The same as text, except [[emotion]] and [[body language]] are used as [[communication channel]]s. A [[telephone|phone]] conversation is an example of voice level interactivity.
# ''Menu Select''  Providing the learner the capability to "select an answer among [[multiple choice question]]s [or] pulling down a [[Menu (computing)|menu]] and selecting a menu item".&lt;ref&gt;Schwier, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;  Clicking on a [[hyperlink]] in a [[web page]] is an example of menu-select interactivity.
# ''Toggle Select''  The ability to "click a button or press a key".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Schwier|first=R.A.|title="A taxonomy of interaction for instructional multimedia" in Annual Conference of the Association for Media and Technology in Education in Canada|year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A [[pinball machine]], for example, exhibits toggle-select interactivity.

'''Kahootz''' was an education multimedia construction toolset created by the [[Australian Children's Television Foundation]]. Using this program, one can make 3D animations using the pre-made objects and backgrounds. It was used by many schools to teach not only making movies with the program but co-operation between the students.

As of 2012 the software is no longer available to purchase, and support has stopped.

== Description ==
Kahootz was designed for children. It made use of many colours, characters, movements and pictures. Many Australian schools had access to this program. In fact, the Victorian Government bought the program for [[List of schools in Victoria|every school]] in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]].

== Features ==
Kahootz starts up with a New Scene. A "world" is then chosen and characters and objects can be added in the same way as [[3D Movie Maker]]. It is possible to zoom in and out and change the camera angle, as Kahootz is 3D, so it is as if you are in a real world.

Animating the object is similar to motion tweening in [[Macromedia Flash]]. A keyframe is created with the object in the desired position. A second keyframe is then created and the object is moved to the new desired position. One can then preview this with the convenient Preview button.

Many scenes could be put into a collection called an xpression. These small files could then be converted in [[QuickTime]] and [[Audio Video Interleave|AVI]] movies for viewing.&lt;ref name="Bowden2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Greg Bowden|title=Learning Kahootz 2.0|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MihNQt_VaqYC|date=1 July 2005|publisher=Guided Computer Tutorials|isbn=978-1-921217-21-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Community ==
There was a community online but it may no longer be active. Teachers and students could post their work online for others to view.

== Plug-ins ==

=== Kahootz Movie Maker ===
Kahootz Movie Maker is a plug-in to the program. It is used to convert into AVI (for Windows) and QuickTime (for the Mac) it also was used to convert files into oxis files, used for video editing uses.

=== Pattern Manager ===
This plug-in allowed the user to edit the patterns pre-loaded into the program. Support was added for this plug-in in the 2.0.4 update.

== Kahootz versions ==

The first commercial release of Kahootz, which was version 2.0, was released in January 2003. Kahootz 2.0 was updated occasionally throughout the years until the final update, version 2.0.5, which was released August 2005.

The last version of Kahootz was Kahootz 3, released in May 2008.

== Kahootz today ==
Kahootz.com is now owned by UK company INOVEM, the developer of a cloud collaboration tool called Kahootz. It is widely used across the UK public sector and available via the government's G-Cloud framework. Kahootz provides secure online workspaces where users can share documents, manage projects and deliver agile ways of working.

== Vision and Mission ==

&lt;!-- [[File:Landegg-Entrance.jpg|frame|left|The Landegg logo sign in front of the main campus building.]] --&gt;
During the period of its existence (1992 to 2003), the following vision and mission statements guided the development of Landegg International University:

'''A Universal Vision:''' The primary objective of the curriculum of Landegg International University is to assist students to make fundamental contributions to the creation of such a civilization. All programs at Landegg International University are formulated according to the parameters of the nobility of human nature, the unity of humankind, and the harmony of scientific and spiritual principles. Landegg International University is continually evaluating its curriculum in light of new research and experience in order to anticipate the needs and challenges of humanity in the emerging global world order, and to prepare its students to meet those needs and challenges with insight, dedication, and expertise.&lt;ref name=LIU1/&gt; (p6)

'''A Global Campus:''' Landegg International University has both a physical and virtual global campus. The physical campus, which overlooks Lake Constance in Switzerland, aims at bringing together students from every country and territory of the world. Landegg students have come from more than thirty countries. The virtual campus, employing the latest information technology and lifelong education principles, will gradually bring the university to every interested and eligible student, thus connecting a large and diverse number of people in a universal web of knowledge and learning. The objective is to make the virtual campus universally accessible, affordable, and relevant.&lt;ref name=LIU1/&gt; (p6)

'''A Service Mandate:''' The ultimate aim of all knowledge is the betterment of the condition of human life, the nurturing of the nobility of human beings, the safeguarding of the principle of unity in diversity, and the creation of a civilization based on the fundamentals of the oneness of humanity. Landegg International University, through the agency of its Education for Peace (EFP) program and other similar projects, involves the entire university community of students, faculty, parents, and friends of Landegg in a global program of community development and service in pursuit of the above objectives.&lt;ref name=LIU1/&gt; (p6)

== Special projects ==

The former president of Landegg International University developed a new model of conflict resolution called 'conflict-free conflict resolution (CFCR).&lt;ref name=LIU2&gt;[http://www.onecountry.org/e132/e13201as_Landegg_story.htm 'In Switzerland, Landegg International University wins increasing attention'] One Country: The Online Newsletter of the Baha’i International Community Vol 13, Issue2 / July – October 2001.  Office of Public Information of the Baha’i International Community.&lt;/ref&gt; The theory of conflict-free conflict resolution indicates that the best way to overcome conflict is by seeking higher and higher levels of unity.&lt;ref name=LIU2/&gt;

Based on the CFCR model, Landegg developed a subsidiary program, called "Education for Peace," which sought to help war-torn communities incorporate peace education into the standard public school curriculum. Education for Peace (EFP) was implemented across Bosnia-Herzegovina from 2000–2012, winning high praise from government and international officials. EFP trainings were also conducted in a number of other countries on a smaller scale.&lt;ref name=LIU2/&gt;&lt;ref name=LIU3&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.friedenspaedagogik.de/english/topics_of_the_institute_s_work/peace_education_projects/education_for_peace_bosnia_and_herzegovina|title=Education for Peace – Bosnia and Herzegovina}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LIU4&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.efpinternational.org/faculty-2|title=Education for Peace International.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Collaborative Relationships:'''  Landegg established collaborative, contractual and bilateral academic relationships with other academic institutions, including the [[University of Wisconsin–Oshkosh|University of Wisconsin]] at Oshkosh, USA, and with major corporations, including Sun Microsystems, and Macromedia. Landegg also has academic relationships with Beijing University in China, the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, in Israel, and the State University of Sergipe in Brazil.&lt;ref name=LIU1/&gt; (p79)&lt;ref name=LIU2/&gt;

== Alumni ==

&lt;!-- [[File:Landegg-Students.jpg|frame|left|A group of Landegg staff and students on campus.]] --&gt;
Acceptance of former Landegg students by other universities: Distinguished universities, including [[Harvard University]], and [[Stanford University]], in the USA; [[University of Leicester|Leicester University]], the London School of Economics, and [[University of Warwick|Warwick University]], in the UK; [[Dalhousie University|Dalhousie]] and [[Queen's University|Queens Universitie]]s, in Canada, and [[Jagiellonian University]], in Poland, have accepted Landegg graduates and transferred their academic credits.&lt;ref name=LIU1/&gt; (p79)

In 2001 some reflections by several Landegg students were recorded in an article about Landegg International University in One Country: The Online Newsletter of the Baha’i International Community.&lt;ref name=LIU2 /&gt;

== Bahá’í historical note ==

In May 1997 [[Hands of the Cause of God|Hand of the Cause of God]] [[Rúḥíyyih Khánum|Amatu’l-Bahá Rúḥíyyih &lt;u&gt;Kh&lt;/u&gt;ánum]] made her last trip outside the Holy Land when she came to visit Landegg in order to establish the Rabbani Chair for Bahá’í History. The events of this visit were recorded in the film Making History.

== Closure ==

In the fall of 2003 the governing board of the University took the very difficult decision that because of the worsening financial condition of the University it would have to close the University at the end of 2003. The last formal convocation was held in December 2003. Every effort was made to transfer all undergraduate students who had not completed their degrees to other universities most with the credits they had already earned at Landegg. Graduate students who had completed all course lectures were assisted to complete written assignments and theses with the help of their professors via the Internet through the Registrar's office. Those with enough credits were awarded either their master‘s degree or their Graduate Certificate. The Governing Board arranged to have the complete academic records of the University preserved and that the registrar functions for transcript inquiries overseen into the future.

'''Martha W. Alibali''' is [[Professor]] of [[Psychology]] and [[Educational Psychology]] at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]], and an investigator at the [[Wisconsin Center for Education Research]].

She is a cognitive and developmental psychologist who studies children’s knowledge and communication about mathematical concepts. Her research focuses on mechanisms of knowledge change in cognitive development and learning. In particular, she investigates the change processes that take place when children learn new concepts and problem-solving strategies, and when they express and communicate their knowledge in gestures and in speech. Her current research projects examine the function of spontaneous gestures in thinking and speaking, the transition from arithmetic to algebraic reasoning, and the nature of mathematical reasoning and communication in children with language impairments. Her work has been or is currently funded by the [[U.S. Department of Education]], the [[National Science Foundation]], the [[National Institutes of Health]], the [[James S. McDonnell Foundation]], the [[Spencer Foundation]], and the Interagency Educational Research Initiative. She earned her Ph.D. in Psychology at the [[University of Chicago]].

==Awards==
* Fellow of the American Psychological Society, 2005
* American Psychological Foundation, Robert L. Fantz Memorial Award, 2004, for young investigator in perceptual or cognitive development
* Chancellor’s Distinguished Teaching Award, University of Wisconsin–Madison, 2004

The '''Saint Petersburg Military Engineering-Technical University (Nikolaevsky)''' ({{lang-ru|Санкт-Петербургский Военный инженерно-технический университет}}, '''VITU'''), previously known as the Saint Petersburg Nikolaevsky Engineering Academy, was established in 1810 under [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander&amp;nbsp;I]]. The university is situated in the former barracks of the Cavalier-Guard Regiment where the university was founded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Historical essay of development the Main Engineering school of 1819–1869 |first=M. |last=Мaksimovskiy |location=St. Petersburg, Russia |year=1869}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
Military Engineering-[[Technical University]] is a higher military educational institution preparing officers of [[engineering]] and building specialties for all branches of troops and navy. It is located in [[Saint Petersburg]] where the university was founded, near [[Saint Michael's Castle|Engineers Castle]], [[Summer Garden]], [[Suvorov Museum]], [[Tauride Palace]], and [[Smolny Convent]].

Military Engineering-Technical University has six faculties preparing specialists in the following branches: 
* Military construction,
* Military energy resource engineering,
* [[Naval base]] construction,
* Sanitary engineering,
* [[Mechanization]] of construction,
* Special for civil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vitu-spb.narod.ru/|title=НЕОФИЦИАЛЬНЫЙ САЙТ ВОЕННОГО ИНЖЕНЕРНО-ТЕХНИЧЕСКОГО УНИВЕРСИТЕТА -- ВИТУ|publisher=|accessdate=June 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The university trains experts in the field of construction of buildings and special structures, engineering and technical systems and power industry. It has a modern experimental base for testing various thermal-mechanical and power equipment, structures and construction materials, and carries out research and development activities. It provides military university trained officers for all the Engineering Troops of Russia, a counterpart of the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]]. Also, possibly teaching of foreigners.

== History ==
[[File:Spb 06-2017 img17 Suvorov Museum.jpg|thumb|250px|Suvorov Military Memorial Museum near VITU]]

This is one of Saint Petersburg's eldest Higher Military engineering schools, its history (as [[Higher learning institution]]) beginning in 1810.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[Stephen Timoshenko - Engineering Education in Russia, McGraw-Hill Book Company, 1959]&lt;/ref&gt; The Saint Petersburg Military Engineering-Technical University was founded as the Saint Petersburg military engineering School in 1810 on the base of the military school of engineering conductors (engineering of [[non-commissioned officers]]), after addition of officers classes and application of five-year term of teaching. In 1819 was renamed as the Main military [[engineering education|engineering School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://regiment.ru/reg/VI/C/29/1.htm|title=Николаевское инженерное училище|publisher=|accessdate=June 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="works.tarefer.ru"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://works.tarefer.ru/33/101252/index.html|title=Реферат История Подготовка инженеров России в XIX веке|publisher=|accessdate=June 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; How [[Stephen Timoshenko]] wrote in a book "Engineering Education in Russia" the system of Higher learning institution of five-year Education of Main military engineering school was used later on the example of Institute of railway Engineers by all Russia and develops until now.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; This engineering school was alma mater of graduate for [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]].&lt;ref&gt;''Anna Dostoyevskaya'' [http://az.lib.ru/d/dostoewskij_f_m/text_0610.shtml Flashbacks] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101020033831/http://az.lib.ru/d/dostoewskij_f_m/text_0610.shtml |date=October 20, 2010 }} [1925]. M.: Artistic literature, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1855, officers classes of the Nikolaevsky Engineering School was reformed as the Nikolaevsky Engineering Academy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grwar.ru/schools/schools.html?id=3&amp;graduated=on&amp;PHPSESSID=d2691c3775a822660dbc7248ec1f8e29|title=Русская армия в Великой войне: Военно-учебные заведения проекта|publisher=|accessdate=June 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After 1917, numerous transformations of Nikolaevsky Engineering Academy and Engineering school were undertaken (but Higher learning institution survived). It was renamed as the Military-Engineering Academy, and then as Military-Technical Academy. But in 1932 followed the unsuccessful attempt of moving the Engineering Faculty to Moscow; it was completed later as the Sea Faculty returned to [[Leningrad]] in 1939 (As a result, from the base Saint Petersburg Engineering Higher learning institution was separated a new Moscow military Engineering-administrative academy). Only [[Nikolay Gerasimovich Kuznetsov]] could counteract [[Joseph Stalin]]`s policy against the Nikolaevsky Engineering Academy and school in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;*[http://admiral.centro.ru/start_e.htm Information page, including memoirs]&lt;/ref&gt; He ordered that the university be revived, and that the Marine Engineering faculty be returned from Moscow.&lt;ref&gt;* [http://glavkom.narod.ru/ Сайт, посвящённый Н. Г. Кузнецову]&lt;/ref&gt; The attempts at bureaucratic movings (or Stalin's unfavorable attitude, 1932–1939) of the Saint Petersburg High School of Military Engineers can be examined in the historical context of the [[Case of Trotskyist Anti-Soviet Military Organization|"Military Case"]] and [[Great Purge]], on the eve of war against [[fascism]].&lt;ref&gt;*[http://stalin.memo.ru/spiski/pg02267.htm List of accused of "Military Case"]&lt;/ref&gt; Also, Stalin's dislike of Fyodor Dostoyevsky was the reason of the unfavorable attitude against a university (because Stalin did not understand Dostoyevsky) {{citation needed|date=September 2014}}.

There were destructive consequences of some degradation for the pedagogical and scientific forces of Saint Petersburg High School of Military Engineers, but it was successfully corrected only due to the donor help of [[Saint Petersburg Polytechnical University|Petersburg Polytechnical Institute]]. Nikolaevsky Engineering Academy was formally and legally reborn in 1939 as the Higher Naval Engineering Construction School on the base of the Leningrad Industrial Construction Engineers Institute (separate part of Saint Petersburg Polytechnical University), and enlarged with the Sea Engineering Faculty of the Moscow Military Academy.&lt;ref name="encspb.ru"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encspb.ru/en/article.php?kod=2804020570|title=Saint Petersburg encyclopaedia|publisher=|accessdate=June 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Higher Naval Engineering Construction School was renamed the Higher Naval Engineering Technical School. [[Leonid Kantorovich]] became the professor of Military Engineering-Technical University, previously known as the Nikolaevsky Engineering Academy, when it was revived on the site of part of the Polytechnical Institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spbstu-eng.ru|title=Saint-Petersburg State Polytechnic University in Russia (SPBSTU) in Russia. Russian universities.|publisher=|accessdate=June 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, the academician [[Boris Galerkin]] took a general's uniform in 1939, as the head of VITU's structural mechanics department became a lieutenant general. In September 1960, VITU university was called the Order of the Red Banner Higher Military Engineering School and became part of the construction troops.&lt;ref name="encspb.ru"/&gt; In 1974, the university was named after A.N. Komarovsky.&lt;ref name="encspb.ru"/&gt; In 1993, the university was reformed as the Military Engineering-Technical Institute, which received its present-day name in 1997, after as did merger the Pushkin Higher Military Engineering Construction School.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sovinformburo.com/organization/detail/?item_id=1478&amp;type=0|title=Санкт-Петербургский Военный инженерно-технический университет|publisher=|accessdate=June 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Second World War===
Military Engineering-Technical University directly took part in [[World War II]]. The graduating students of the university fought heroically at all fronts of that war. They showed spiritual force and quality of engineering competence. The forts and numerous fortifications buildings was established by the graduating students of university, all of it played a vital part in defending (for example [[Brest Fortress]]). So unique [[Krasnaya Gorka fort]] was constructed by the graduating students of VITU at the beginning of the 20th century with the installation of 12-inch guns in concrete casemates. The system of forts played a key part in the [[Siege of Leningrad]]. The VITU's graduating students by the commanders of [[Krasnaya Gorka fort]] did to finally stopped the offensive of fascists already in 1941. During the Siege of Leningrad, [[Boris Galerkin]] was the head of the city engineering defence department experts group. Also, he joined the military engineering commission of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences|Academy of Sciences]]. Hard non-stop work was undermining his health. Not long after the Victory, in {{Nowrap|July 1945}}, Galerkin died. [[Leonid Kantorovich]] was the professor of the VITU of the Navy, and there he was in charge of safety on the [[Road of Life]]; for his feat and courage he was awarded the [[Order of the Patriotic War]].&lt;ref&gt;Dochenko V. D., Navy. War. Victory. St. Petersburg, Shipbuilding. 1995&lt;/ref&gt; All employees of the university were decorated with the medal "For Defense of Leningrad". In 1944, the university was the recipient of the Order of the Red Banner award, and VITU's cadets participated in the historic [[Moscow Victory Parade of 1945]].

== Traditions of Saint Petersburg High School of Military Engineers ==
[[File:Saint Petersburg St Michael's Castle.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Engineers Castle (southern façade) with the Monument to Peter&amp;nbsp;I in the foreground, favourite place of VITU's cadets]]

[[Military Engineering]]-Technical University prolongs, saves and develops the scientific and pedagogical traditions of Saint Petersburg High (higher learning institution) School of Military Engineers, the Nikolaevsky Engineering Academy and Nikolaevsky Engineering School, in the place of its own historical motherland.&lt;ref name="works.tarefer.ru"/&gt; In present days, traditions about the unique quality of pedagogical qualification of professors and teachers are saved with punctilious care.  So [[Leonid Artamonov]], a Russian engineer, geographer and traveler, military adviser of [[Menelik II]], was the example of tradition of university about harmonic association of spiritual force and engineering competence. The Saint [[Ignatius Bryanchaninov]] chose way of spiritual service.

[[Dmitri Mendeleev]] was Professor of Chemistry at the Saint Petersburg Military Engineering-Technical University. Mendeleev got married at Nikolaev Engineering-technical University's church. So a professor Aleksey Shuliachenko, an engineer and chemist, known as the "grandfather of the Russian cement", was his student. Also, Aleksey Shuliachenko was able to become a professor for a future academician Boris Galerkin at the [[St. Petersburg Technological Institute]].

The '''National Standard Examination in Astronomy''' or NSEA is an examination in 
physics for higher secondary school students, usually conducted in the end of November (last or second last Sunday). Organized by the [[Indian Association of Physics Teachers ]]in&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; association with [[Homi Bhabha Centre for Science Education]] (HBCSE),&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://olympiads.hbcse.tifr.res.in/|title=Olympiads {{!}} Homi Bhabha Centre for Science Education|website=olympiads.hbcse.tifr.res.in|access-date=2016-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; NSEA is the first stage of selection of students in the [[International Olympiad on Astronomy and Astrophysics|IOAA]]. The NSEA is carried out every year since 1987 in English, Hindi &amp; a few other Indian languages. About 16000 &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://iapt.org.in/images/NSEA-national-1.pdf|title=NSEA National Top 1%|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;students from over 1,200 centres take part in these olympiads.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iapt.org.in/index.php/exams/nse/nsec-b-a-js.html|title=NSEC/B/A/JS|last=Himangi|website=iapt.org.in|access-date=2016-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eligibility==


Only Indian citizens born on or after July 1999 and are students studying in Class XII or lower as of 30 June 2004, can apply and appear for NSEA 2018-19. The student has to himself re-assure his eligibility. At any stage if the student is found to be not eligible for the exam, he/she may be disqualified from the program.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==Format==

Before 2014-15, The NSEA comprised both [[multiple choice question]]s and subjective questions. Due to the large volume of participating students, all questions were not checked for all candidates; subjective questions were checked for only those candidates scoring above a certain minimum in the multiple choice questions. Multiple choice questions carried about 60% of the total weightage and were the crucial determinant for selection to the next stage.
The present format (from 2014-15 onwards) is composed entirely of 80 multiple-choice questions.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.motachashma.com/scholarships/nsea-astronomy-olympiad.php|title=NSEA 2016 - Astronomy Olympiad|last=Sabharwal|first=Ankita|website=Mota Chashma|language=en-US|access-date=2016-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Question Paper==
The medium of test is English only and comprises 80 objective type questions, each with only one of the four options correct with 3 marks each and -1 negative marking for incorrect answer.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.examrace.com/Olympiad/HBCSE-Information/Astronomy-Olympiad/Astronomy-Olympiad-Stage-I.html|title=Stage I: National Standard Examination in Astronomy (NSEA)- Examrace|last=Examrace|website=www.examrace.com|access-date=2016-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Qualifying for the Second Stage== 
The basic objective of conducting this test is not focusing on merit but to involve as many students from the country to participate in the exam and try to show and expose their talent. Hence the selection to the stage II examinations i.e. [[Indian National Olympiad Examinations]] (INOs) is based on the following scheme.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blog.resonance.ac.in/2015/11/24/national-standard-examination-in-astronomy-nsea-2015-analysis-resonance/|title=National Standard Examination in Astronomy (NSEA) 2015: A detailed analysis by Resonance|last=resowatch|date=2015-11-24|website=Resonance Blog|access-date=2016-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===Cutoff===
To be eligible to get to the next level, i.e. the second stage, it is necessary that a student scores at-least a '''Minimum Admissible Score (MAS)''' which is 50% of the maximum score.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Proportional Representation Clause===
The maximum number of students that can get to '''Stage II''' (INO) in each subject is around 300. These many students are not selected only on the merit basis but also on proportionate basis. This proportion is decided on the base of the number of candidates who appeared for NSE in the previous year from that center in each State or Union Territory (UT). In case there is a tie at the last position, then all the students competing for the last position will be eligible to move to stage II. However it’s necessary that the selected students fulfill the eligibility clause laid out above. The total number to be selected from centers in each State for each subject will be displayed on the [[Indian Association of Physics Teachers|IAPT]] and [[HBCSE]] website.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===Minimum Representation Clause===
Notwithstanding the proportional representation clause the number of students selected for INO from each State and UT must be at least one, provided that the eligibility clause is satisfied.

===Merit Clause===
As stated above, approximately 300 students are to be selected for second stage. If this does not happen according to MAS, then after selection as per merit, the shortfall from 300 students will be selected based purely on merit without further consideration to proportional representation and minimum representation clauses. In the event of a tie at the last position in the list all students with the same marks at this position will qualify to appear for the Stage II examination.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==Fee==

The fee for the NSEA is about Rs. 100 ($5 for overseas candidates). Application for this examination is typically handled through the school/college to which the student is affiliate&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Indian National Astronomy Olympiad ==
Held in January, this is a subjective exam. Students are divided into two pools; A, with those in class 12, and B, with those in class 11 or below. The 25 top performers from each pool are selected for the Orientation-Cum-Selection-Camp (OCSC), Astronomy.

== OCSC Astronomy ==
The students are taught and tested on data analysis, theory and observation. From their performance in the tests, a team of five students is selected to represent India in [[International Olympiad on Astronomy and Astrophysics|IOAA]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4145">'''Prince of Wales School''' is an all-boys secondary school in [[Freetown]], [[Sierra Leone]].  Girls are admitted into its sixth form "A" Level program.  The school was established on April 6, 1925, with an emphasis on fostering science education and modern languages studies.

==School history==
Prince of Wales School was inaugurated by His Royal Highness, the [[Prince of Wales]], on April 6, 1925. It is one of Sierra Leone's top schools.

The Prince of Wales School was formally established in Freetown, [[Republic of Sierra Leone]] on April 6, 1925, with a purposeful insistence on fostering science education, and studies in modern languages. The school marked a turning point in [[secondary education]] in Sierra Leone, as its inception ushered the period in which the Sierra Leone government actively sought to control wasteful multiplication, religious bigotry, and denominational rivalry in secondary school.

Since its inauguration, the Prince of Wales School has demonstrated, with consistency, an affinity for Excellence in Education by relentlessly providing a model for a Balanced and High Quality Education at the secondary level in Sierra Leone. Its graduates have also occupied prominent positions of trust, altruism, and responsibility in Sierra Leone as well as in the international community.

The Prince of Wales [[Alumni Association]]-[[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] Branch was founded in 2002 by a cohort of former Students of the Prince of Wales Secondary School residing in the United States who not only saw the need for substantial financial, material and infra-structural support to their [[alma mater]] but also were prepared to make the necessary sacrifices destined to improve the quality of teaching and learning at the Prince of Wales School in Sierra Leone. Their patriotic zeal coupled with their conviction that they could make a difference in improving the human condition as well as positively influence posterity gave birth to the Prince Of Wales Alumni Association - Georgia Branch, U.S.A.

==School song==

The school song was introduced by the late principal, William J. Davies, MBE in 1936

1. Come swell the chorus one and all and join the ranks with me;
Prosperity to the Prince's boys upstanding three times three.
Dear as of old and dear as now and despite any storm
Long live for many a thousand years our Prince of Wales, Kingtom

CHORUS:

For searching Sierra Leone far and wide, no school can well be found;
That sends forth truer gentlemen, or stands on firmer ground.

2. T'is not alone in science lore her manly sons excel;
The cricket and the athletic grounds their tale of triumph tell.
The Church, the State, the Camp and Bar, with varied voice attest,
That whereso'er bright honour calls, her sons are with the best.

3. As on her walls we read the names renowned in former days,
With beating hearts we vow to match their daring and their praise;
For who would care through time to drift with dull and drowsy face,
Unworthy of his faith and name, his father and his race.

4. Though scattered far we seldom meet the friends our boyhood knew,
Old joys and griefs in memory dwell, toned down to sober hue,
And as some well remembered name grows great, we glow with pride,
To think that in our youthful days, we struggled at his side.

5. And when at last old age is ours and manhood's strength has fled,
And young ambition's fire is cold and earthly hopes lie dead;
We feel our boyhood's thrill once more and think its just life's morn,
And leave a niche within our hearts for Prince of Wales, Kingtom.

'''Princess Christian's Farm''' is an educational facility geared towards people with learning disabilities.  The farm is run by a partnership with Kent County Council Social Services for the benefit of adults with learning difficulties and disabilities.  The overall aim of the partnership is for the individuals to learn new skills and develop opportunities to move into employment.

== Origins and History ==
Situated on the outskirts of [[Hildenborough]] (near [[Tonbridge]], Kent), Princess Christian’s Farm was first purchased in 1910 by [[Princess Christian of Schleswig-Holstein|Princess Christian]], the third daughter of [[Queen Victoria]], as a home for people with learning difficulties.

It was intended that the farm would be self-supporting - growing vegetables, keeping cattle and poultry.  In the early days a milk round was started which was done initially on foot and then later by pony and milk float.  This practice continued until around 1935.

In 1948, with the advent of the [[National Health Service]], the Farm became a subsidiary of Leybourne Grange and admissions were made through a Regional Board.  The Farm still served as a place where those with learning difficulties could work and contribute to the community.  This continued until 1984, when the Health Authority made the decision that it was inappropriate for it to be running a farm.  Following negotiations with [[Kent County Council]] Social Services, {{convert|25|acre|m2}} of land and the farm buildings were taken over by KCC in 1987, with the remaining {{convert|96|acre|m2}} let out to local farmers through grazing agreements.  These agreements usually ran for a period of less than one year, and due to a lack of maintenance after 1984 the fields were soon in a poor state, with minimal fencing and weeds dominating pasture.  In 1990 the final farmer with a grazing agreement left and the land became redundant until, in 1991, Princess Christian’s Farm took back the land with a grazing agreement agreed between Kent County Council and the Health Authority.

This additional land proved to be a great asset to the Farm, enabling them to keep up to 200 sheep, make hay and build a nature trail which is accessible to people with learning disabilities.

In October 2009, [[Hadlow College]] – the local [[land-based college]] – took over the running of Princess Christian’s Farm.   Run in partnership with Kent County Council Social Services for the benefit of adults with learning difficulties and disabilities, the overall aim of the partnership is for the individuals to learn new skills and develop opportunities to move into employment.

==About the Farm==
As a traditional working farm, Princess Christian’s Farm comprises approximately {{convert|115|acre|km2}} of pasture and woodland.  It produces its own pork, lamb and beef as well as oven ready chickens and over 1,000 eggs a day.  Each Christmas quality turkeys are reared for local customers.  Much of the produce is sold through its own farm shop and local butchers.

Within the glasshouses and polytunnels the horticulture department grows a range of plants, herbs and vegetables for sale in the Farm Shop alongside planters and hanging baskets.  The farm kitchen provides hot lunches for the students and produces cakes and pastries for local farmers’ markets.

==About the Curriculum==
There are currently places for up to 25 individuals a day at Princess Christian’s Farm.  Underpinning the curriculum are the following values:

* Respect for self and others
* Self-determination so that people take responsibility for what happens in their lives
* Inclusiveness
* Development of relationships with people at work

These values are designed to demonstrate a commitment by Hadlow College and its staff to ensure that the education fulfils the needs of the students, as well as to acknowledge to the student their need to be challenged and supported.

A student’s first month at Princess Christian’s Farm includes an initial assessment, which includes a one-to-one interview, tasters and staff observations as well as talking with the key agencies involved.

In working with [[Hadlow College]] there is an aim for the students at Princess Christian’s Farm to benefit from a much wider access to different activities and qualifications in animal management, horticulture, conservation and agriculture.  Another aim is for them to be able to find different work placements.

It is the College’s aim that all students progress to their maximum possible level of independence so that they can become active in their communities and in employment.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="63298">'''Project DIANE''', an acronym for '''Diversified Information and Assistance NEtwork''', was a very early [[videoconferencing]] based [[community service]] network created in the United States. DIANE was a grassroots driven regional videoconferencing consortium which promoted and supported cooperative electronic alliances in [[education]], [[community service]], and [[economic development]].

Created in 1992 in [[Nashville, Tennessee]], Project DIANE was in active operation as a centrally managed public service network until 2006 when funding issues prevented its further development and expansion. Portions of the network still remain in service, however, though no longer under the Project DIANE [[moniker]].

Peak network membership consisted of more than 200 participating organizations and more than 350 program and technical coordinators, supporting live interactive video programming over a service region consisting of twelve U.S. states and five countries.

==History==
Project DIANE was first proposed in 1992 as a regional diversity development project collaboration between the U.S. [[Tennessee Valley Authority]] (TVA) and a small consortium of public and private universities located within TVA's six state service region.  After a year of deliberations and two successful community based field pilots, Project DIANE was given [[Venture capital|startup funding]] by the TVA.

The two field  pilots, named the Nashville Pilot and the City Share Pilot were instrumental in demonstrating that videoconferencing technology was a viable and highly flexible mechanism through which to deliver a broad array of educational, economic development and public service resources to the general public. Both pilots were carried out with the participation of several dozen community service organizations, [[Government agency|governmental agencies]] and corporations.

Primary sponsors and underwriters of the two pilots included TVA, [[BellSouth]], [[IBM]], and PictureTel (later purchased by [[Polycom]]). The Nashville Pilot was an intracity test of desktop [[videoconferencing]] technology with application test sites in [[Nashville, Tennessee]] constructed at [[Tennessee State University]], Cumberland Science Museum (later renamed the Adventure Science Center) and the Looby Public Library.

One month after conclusion of the Nashville Pilot, the City Share Pilot testbed was created by connecting the three Nashville video test locations to additional video sites constructed in [[Huntsville, Alabama]]. A large portfolio of community oriented and educational test applications between Nashville and Huntsville were launched with a 40-minute discussion of [[:wikt:intercity|intercity]] cooperation between the [[mayor]]s of the cities. It is believed that the City Share pilot was the first ever intercity videoconference link ever constructed for non-commercial purposes.

In the years following the project's pilot startup, many public and private organizations participated in the network's public service programming and donated both in-kind and financial resources.  Network participants and supporters were also successful in securing a wide bevy of public and private grants to pay for different types of community applications which utilized the project.

== Overview ==

=== Project objectives ===
Project DIANE's primary objectives were to: 
# develop a successful electronic community service network that could be expanded and/or replicated by all interested members of the community,
# bring education institutions, business development agencies, and community service organizations closer together for cooperative sharing of scarce public and private resources and
# provide needy individuals and groups with free, or low cost, digital access to useful information, assistance and professional expertise.

There were two notable aspects about the network. First, the project was designed as a broad-based, rather than niche-focused, community [[telecollaboration]]. DIANE membership reflected a wide spectrum of [[community organizations]] which came together online to jointly plan and carry out public programs and services.

The project was represented by most segments of the community, both in an organizational context (e.g., schools, community centers, libraries, business agencies, etc.) and individually (child through senior adult, families, handicapped, urban and rural, etc.) DIANE was inherently a "project of projects" with teleconferencing applications in the three target areas of education, community service and economic development.

A second key aspect of this project was that, from its inception, DIANE members worked diligently to include disadvantaged or neglected members of society in consortium program development activities. The avoidance of a two-tier cyber-society of "haves" vs. "have-nots" was a high priority. DIANE members took special care to include low income inner city residents, [[developmental disability|developmentally disabled children]], [[senior citizen]]s, [[speech disorder|speech]] and [[hearing impairment|hearing impaired]] individuals, and other potential information highway have-nots in program development activities.

=== Participants ===
Online members of the consortium included family and [[Community centre|community centers]], speech &amp; hearing treatment centers, [[K–12 (education)|K-12 schools]], [[zoo]]s, [[museum]]s, [[public library|public libraries]], universities, language institutes, skill training centers, [[chambers of commerce]], economic development agencies, healthcare groups, overseas military bases &amp; dependents schools, and other service organizations.

Specific notable members of the project included the [[Small Business Administration]] sponsored Small Business Development Centers, the Tennessee Foreign Language Institute, the Adventure Science Center, [[Vanderbilt University]], the Tennessee Foreign Language Institute, Tennessee League for the Deaf &amp; Hard of Hearing, the Nashville Zoo, the Metropolitan Action Commission, [[Urban League]] of Nashville, the [[Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of America|Boys &amp; Girls Club]], the [[Girl Scouts of the USA|Girl Scouts]] of Middle Tennessee, the Catholic Diocese of Nashville, the [[Tennessee State Library and Archives|Tennessee State Library &amp; Archives]], the [[The Elephant Sanctuary (Hohenwald)|Elephant Sanctuary]] of Hohenwald, the Nashville Public Library System, the [[Bank of America]] Small Business Resource Centers, and the [[U.S. Department of Defense]] Overseas Dependents School System.

=== Real-time telecollaboration ===
Telecollaboration was inherently the method by which DIANE organizations educated and assisted one another. Real-time telecollaboration took place in all project activities through two-way electronic exchanges between a resource provider (such as a K-12 teacher, college professor, business counselor, social worker, therapist, or other expert professional) and a person in need (e.g., student, small/minority business entrepreneur, researcher, family member, handicapped person, senior citizen, etc.). Real-time multimedia information exchanges occurred during videoconferences via [[Interactive whiteboard|electronic whiteboards]], [[application sharing|remote application sharing]], electronic messaging, hi-speed file transfer and other means.

== Programs and applications ==
DIANE's program portfolio included various independent and inter-dependent telecollaborations, offering resources and assistance to both mainstream and disadvantaged community segments. In addition to the general program descriptions given in this section, interested parties were able to click to the Project DIANE Directory and read the "DIANE Program &amp; Resource Profile" for each individual organization. General teleconference based program areas established by the project included: the Economic Development Partnership, Tennessee Child Development Partnership, Teachers' Teleconferencing Curriculum Forum, Internet Distance Training, Global Community Project, and others.

Examples of specific program activities within these general program areas included the following: The Tennessee League for the Hearing Impaired offered videoconferencing-based [[Deaf culture]] workshops, [[sign language]] instruction, and [[Video Relay Service|translation services]]. Looby Metro Public Library supported a distance [[mentor]]ship program called "Adopt-a-Grandparent" in which senior citizen library volunteers provide guidance and counseling to disadvantaged youth who called in from DIANE's community center locations. Therapists and physicians at the Bill Wilkerson Speech &amp; Hearing Center and the Vanderbilt Child Development Center electronically assisted disabled children, including adolescents with [[autism]] and related communication disorders. High school students and teachers regularly consulted online with the project's educational resources such as the Cumberland Science Museum (e.g., for science information, environmental workshops, etc.) and to [[Meharry Medical College]] (e.g., to learn about viruses), etc.

=== Electronic field trips ===
The use of [[videotelephony|videoconferencing technology]] to electronically and interactively take students to exotic and faraway places was pioneered by Project DIANE.  An important supplement to in-class instruction, schoolchildren frequently were able to go on electronic field trips through the DIANE network for meaningful interactive real-world learning experiences.

The [[Nashville Zoo]] conducted videoconferences with area schools to bring students safe interactive experiences with rare snow leopards and other wild animals. Animal conservationists from the [[The Elephant Sanctuary (Hohenwald)|Elephant Sanctuary]] in Lewis County, TN provided teleconference-based seminars on elephants and the need for [[wildlife|animal preservation]], even connecting video callers to remote cameras located in the elephant grazing pasture. [[Radnor Lake State Natural Area]] offered students a wide range of teleconference activities involving environmental conservation, water ecology, and wireless video/underwater camera views of its wildlife residents.

Often, Project DIANE electronic field trips took the children to international locations such as France, England, Japan, or to meet interesting people such as jet pilots, film actors and corporate executives. The [[Tennessee Foreign Language Institute]] conducted world culture seminars and foreign language instruction to DIANE participants, also providing students remote playback access to its 250+ international tape library. Tennessee's state information repository, the Tennessee State Library &amp; Archives, provided interactive teleconference-based history seminars, library reference assistance, and live curator based video access to its rare manuscript collection, includes original [[American Civil War]] photographs, historic [[architectural drawing]]s, original letters of President [[Andrew Jackson]], the 1796 [[Tennessee State Constitution]], etc.

=== Connecting students to experts outside the classroom ===
Connected schools and community centers teleconferenced with the local public library for story telling hour and puppet shows, with [[NationsBank]]'s Small Business Resource Center and the Nashville Area Chamber for youth career planning and entrepreneurship programs, and with [[Meharry Medical College]] for health and hygiene workshops. An advanced placement (AP) course shared curriculum was being developed for use by area high schools. Current AP course development included environmental science and biology.

Regarding business development programs, any area business with compatible technologies could access Project DIANE's online economic development member agencies, including SBRC business experts, SBRC library resources, SBDC business counselors, area [[chamber of commerce]] program personnel, university business faculty, etc.

=== Awards and recognitions ===
International recognitions of Project DIANE included: [[Polycom|Polycom Corporation]]’s ''Exceptional Content Provider Award'' (8/03), a Top 5 Rating by the [[European Commission]]'s ''Global Bangemann Challenge'' (Stockholm, 6/99); 6 [[Necessary International Initiative|NII]] ''Global Information Infrastructure'' award citations (12/96-2/98) including an AT&amp;T Special Telecollaboration Award; a ''"national success story"'' citation by the President's National Information Advisory Council (2/96), and an ''Awards Laureate'' designation by the [[Smithsonian Institution]] ''Information Technology Awards Program'' (6/95).

Key invited presentations and demonstrations of Project DIANE programming include national conferences and forums hosted by the [[American Library Association]] (Atlanta, GA, 6/02), [[National Science Foundation]] (Berkeley, CA, 12/00), [[United States Department of Commerce|U.S. Dept of Commerce]] (Washington DC, 4/98) and the [[White House]] (Philadelphia PA, 4/97).

== Technology evolution ==
Project DIANE began as an all [[Integrated Services Digital Network]] (ISDN) BRA based community network using [[desktop computer|desktop personal computers]] deploying an [[H.320]] [[codec]], which later evolved into a hybrid switched digital and Internet IP based H.320/[[H.324]] platform. It should be noted that the videoconferencing equipment used by Project DIANE in the Nashville and City Share startup field pilots were all [[OS/2]] based videoconference units (PCS/1s) provided through a joint development partnership at the time between [[PictureTel Corp.|PictureTel]] and the [[IBM|IBM Corporation]]. These early video units were replaced during the startup phase with [[Microsoft Windows|Windows OS]]-based [[IBM Personal Computer|PC desktop units]].

In later years, the project's infrastructure also included a large number of set top [[videoconference]] units, as well as several dozen videoconferencing units for conference rooms.  In the late 1990s, a large corporate donation of more than a hundred new videoconference units more than doubled the size of DIANE to more than two hundred video locations.

Project DIANE also later acquired a [[Tandberg]] [[Multipoint Control Unit]] (MCU), sometimes referred to as a video bridge or gateway, which allowed the network to deliver its interactive programming to up to 16 separate locations simultaneously. Funding for the MCU's required network connections (a Primary Rate Access high speed digital telephone line and an [[Internet protocol|IP]] [[Broadband Internet access|broadband access line]]) was provided by [[Tennessee State University]] and the Tennessee Department of Human Services, Rehabilitation Services Division.

==Biography==

Rajkumar Singhajit Singh was born in a family of dancers and musicians in [[Manipur]]. Early in life, he was fortunate to receive his dance education from the finest gurus of [[Manipuri dance]], starting with ‘Guru Ojha Iboton Singh’ (1942–46) for Pung (drum), followed by ‘Guru Amubi Singh’ (1948–54) – Jagoi; ‘Guru Thambal Angou Singh’ (1950–52) - Kartal Chalom; ‘Guru Chauba Singh’  (1952–53) - Kartal Chalom; and with ‘Guru Ojha Gaura Singh’ (1952–53) from whom he learned the martial arts with Sword &amp; Spear,&lt;ref name=mum/&gt; and soon established himself as a dancer, choreographer and artist of repute &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indianexpress.com/res/web/pIe/ie/daily/19990729/ile29147.html Wedded to Dance] [[Indian Express]], July 29, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Robert Antoni''' (born 1958) is a [[West Indian literature|West Indian]] writer who was awarded the 1999 [[Aga Khan Prize for Fiction]] by ''[[The Paris Review]]'' for ''My Grandmother's Tale of How Crab-o Lost His Head''.  He is a Guggenheim Fellow for 2010 for his work on the historical novel ''As Flies to Whatless Boys''.&lt;ref name=gf/&gt;

==Early life==
Robert Antoni was born in the United States of [[Trinidad and Tobago|Trinidadian]] parents and grew up largely in the [[Bahamas]], where his father practised medicine.  He says his "fictional world" is "Corpus Christi", the invented island (based on Trinidad) that he introduced in his first [[novel]], ''Divina Trace'' (1991).&lt;ref&gt;[http://robertantoni.com/biography/ Biography], Author's website.&lt;/ref&gt;

Antoni studied at [[Duke University]] and in the [[creative writing]] programme at [[Johns Hopkins University]], before joining the [[Iowa Writers' Workshop]] at the [[University of Iowa]],&lt;ref name=Tribune&gt;[http://www.tribune242.com/news/2014/apr/16/lecturer-launches-writing-workshop/ Lamech Johnson, "Lecturer Launches Writing Workshop"], Tribune 242, 16 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; where he began working on ''Divina Trace''. 
He has said that he spent a total of ten years completing the novel, which won the [[Commonwealth Writers' Prize]] for best first novel in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nalis.gov.tt/Research/SubjectGuide/Biographies/BiographiesAC/tabid/100/Default.aspx?PageContentID=1131 Robert Antoni biography], NALIS.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Antoni lived for a time in [[Barcelona]] and taught at the [[University of Miami]] from 1992 to 2001. In 2004, he began teaching at [[Barnard College]], [[Columbia University]] and [[The New School]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newschool.edu/public-engagement/faculty-list/?id=88179 Faculty, The New School.]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, he was a [[Guggenheim Fellow]].&lt;ref name=gf&gt;[http://www.gf.org/fellows/16922-robert-antoni John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation.]&lt;/ref&gt;

His novel ''As Flies to Whatless Boys'' was the overall winner of the 2014 [[OCM Bocas Prize for Caribbean Literature]]. At the award ceremony on 26 April, Antoni pledged to share the US$10,000 prize money with the other finalists, [[Lorna Goodison]] (winner of the poetry category for ''Oracabessa'') and [[Kei Miller]] (winner of the literary non-fiction category for ''Writing Down the Vision: Essays and Prophecies'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://inagist.com/all/460221834718638080/ In-A-Gist]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trinidadexpress.com/news/Whatless-Boys-wins-it-for-writer-Antoni-256919101.html Anna Ramdass , "‘Whatless Boys’ wins it for writer Antoni"], ''Trinidad Express Newspapers'', 27 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Kei Miller and Antoni were both features presenters at the 2018 [[Key West Literary Seminar]]: Writers of the Caribbean.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.potentmagazine.com/i-am-a-translation-writing-the-global-caribbean-language/|title=“I Am a Translation”: Writing the Global Caribbean Language|date=2018-02-11|work=POTENT Magazine|access-date=2018-02-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides the dance itself, students at the Ganesh Natyalaya are also taught [[Tamil language|Tamil]], [[Hindi language|Hindi]] and [[Carnatic music|Carnatic vocal music]] to give them a holistic understanding of Bharatanatyam.&lt;ref name="tamilnation"&gt;{{cite web|title=ONE HUNDRED TAMILS OF THE 20TH CENTURY : Saroja Vaidyanathan|url=http://tamilnation.co/hundredtamils/saroja.htm|accessdate=28 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1661">'''Stanford Engineering Everywhere''', or '''SEE''' is an initiative started by [[Andrew Ng]] at [[Stanford University]] to offer a number of Stanford courses free online.  SEE's initial set of courses was funded by [[Sequoia Capital]], and offered  instructional videos, reading lists and assignments. The portal was designed to assist both the students and teachers across the world.  This is similar to initiatives like [[MIT OpenCourseWare]], where some of the courses are available for viewing for the online students community at no charge. 

== Project ==

SEE initially offered ten courses from the [[Stanford University School of Engineering|Stanford School of Engineering]], including three course introductory sequence from [[computer science]].  The courses offered are from the fields of [[databases]], [[artificial intelligence]] and [[computer programming]].   

In Fall 2011, the SEE program was expanded to offer full online courses in [[Machine Learning]], [[Artificial Intelligence]], and [[Databases]].  Each of these courses had an enrollment of about 100,000 students and up, and students can register and view the courses, raise queries and submit assignments online.  Some of the courses are divided into "basic" and "advanced" categories.

'''Todd Bolender''' (February 27, 1914 – October 12, 2006) was a renowned [[ballet]] [[ballet dancer|dancer]], teacher, choreographer, and director. He was an instrumental figure in the creation and dissemination of classical dance and ballet as an American art form.  A child of the American Midwest during the [[Great Depression]], he studied under [[George Balanchine]] and led the [[Kansas City Ballet]] in [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]], [[Missouri]], from 1980 to 1995.

==Early life==
Born in [[Canton, Ohio]] on February 27, 1914, Bolender grew up in a family in which the arts, music and theater in particular, were an important part of life.  The extremely lively child—one of four—was early on dubbed the dancer of the family and his physical energy channeled in lessons in acrobatic tap.  In 1931, when he was 17, Bolender went to New York, which he said in an interview in 2002 seemed to him like a “kind of heaven”, to study theatrical dance. In 1933 he moved to New York for good, taking up full-time residence there at about the same time [[George Balanchine]] arrived in this country.

==Early years of dance==
Attendance at a concert by [[Mary Wigman]] led Bolender to [[Hanya Holm]], who he said later saved him from bad teaching. Social acquaintance with Balanchine, however, made a strong impression. Under Balanchine’s supervision, Bolender studied at the fledgling [[School of American Ballet]] with such Russian teachers as [[Pierre Vladimiroff]], [[Felia Dubrovska]], [[Anatole Oboukhoff]] and [[Ludmilla Schollar]]. He also trained with [[Muriel Stuart (dancer)|Muriel Stuart]] and, pursuing a strong interest in modern dance, studied with [[Louis Horst]] and [[Harald Kreutzberg]]. The two greatest influences on his choreography, Bolender was to say later, were Wigman and [[Uday Shankar]], both of whom he saw perform in New York in the early thirties, along with Kreutzberg.  Asked why he became a ballet dancer, Bolender said simply it was the Depression and he needed a job.

As a dancer, Bolender had an unusually long career, lasting from 1936 to 1972 when he performed onstage for the last time in [[New York City Ballet]]’s Stravinsky Festival, for which he also choreographed two pieces, ''[[Serenade in A]]'' and ''[[Piano-Rag-Music (Bolender)|Piano-Rag-Music]]''.  Not only was he a member of every permutation of the company that became New York City Ballet, he also danced with [[Littlefield Ballet]] in the late thirties, performing in [[Catherine Littlefield]]’s ''[[Barn Dance]]'' and the first American ''[[The Sleeping Beauty (ballet)|Sleeping Beauty]]''.  He performed with [[Les Ballets Russe de Monte Carlo]] for one season (1945-46) and with [[Ballet Theatre]] for four months in 1944 before being sidelined with an injury.

Bolender was a versatile dancer, originating roles in the work of Balanchine — most notably ''[[Four Temperaments (ballet)|Four Temperaments]]'', ''[[Renard (Stravinsky)|Renard]]'', and ''[[Agon (ballet)|Agon]]'' — and in much of the choreography of [[Jerome Robbins]] as well. In [[Lew Christensen]]’s work, he originated the State Trooper in ''[[Filling Station (ballet)|Filling Station]]'' and Alias in ''[[Billy the Kid (ballet)|Billy the Kid]]''. Critic and historian [[Doris Hering]], writing in the ''[[International Dictionary of the Ballet]]'' calls him “a superb comedian with a penchant for high camp.” Describing him in Jerome Robbins’ ''[[The Concert (ballet)|The Concert]]'', she writes: “[he] was a henpecked husband who constantly escaped into daydreams of sexual conquest. Clad in a vest and long underwear and chewing on a huge cigar, he was the prototype of ... J. [[Walter Mitty]].”  Longtime New York City Ballet observer Robert Garis said of him in ''Agon'', “[his] easy wit and charm in the first pas de trois seem unrecapturable” (''ibid.'')

''[[Mother Goose Suite]]'', made in 1943, was the first of some three dozen ballets Bolender made in the course of his long career, eleven of them for New York City Ballet.  Bolender’s choreography is in the repertoires of Kansas City Ballet, New York City Ballet, [[American Ballet Theatre]], the [[Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo]], [[San Francisco Ballet]], [[Pacific Northwest Ballet]], [[The Joffrey Ballet]], and the [[Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater]]. His best known works, both of which are still in active repertoire, are ''[[Souvenirs (ballet)|Souvenirs]]'' and ''The Still Point'', both made in 1955.

==Later career==
Todd Bolender's illustrious career allotted him the opportunity to work and cultivate relationships with Igor Stravinsky, Aaron Copland, Virgil Thomson and Samuel Barber.

While the bulk of his choreography was for ballet companies, Bolender also choreographed for musical theater, opera and television, starting in 1952 with ''Time Remembered'' for Albi Marre Productions.  In 1969, he choreographed ''The Conquering Hero'', followed by ''Cry for Us All'' in 1970.  In Turkey, where he worked in the seventies, Bolender choreographed ''My Fair Lady'', ''Fiddler on the Roof'', ''[[Man of La Mancha]]'', and ''Showboat''.  In Kansas City, he choreographed for many operas, including ''[[Samson and Delilah (opera)|Samson and Delilah]]'' for which the dancing got a better review than the singing.

Bolender taught throughout his career in New York and as a guest teacher all over the United States as well as in Turkey, Japan, Austria, and Germany.  From 1963 to 1966, he was ballet director for the Cologne Opera House and from 1966-69 he filled the same role in Frankfurt.  With [[Janet Reed]] he was a founding director of Pacific Northwest Ballet in 1975 and for three years starting in 1977 he was ballet director in the [[Ataturk Opera House]].

==Career in Kansas City==
Todd Bolender’s appointment as Artistic Director in the winter of 1981 opened a new chapter of opportunity for the [[Kansas City Ballet]]. Confident that a broader community support for classical ballet might be found, Bolender had a vision to build a company, a repertoire, and a school in the nation's heartland. Bolender did all three and at an age when most people have retired

Bolender became Artistic Director Emeritus in 1996 when he retired from Kansas City Ballet and William Whitener took over as Artistic Director. In the fall of 1997, Bolender was invited to New York by the George Balanchine Foundation to officially document for videotape the choreography of the solo that Balanchine created for him in The Four Temperaments. Bolender who created the role of the Fox in the original 1947 production of ''Renard'', resurrected this piece, which had initially vanished for a half century, in 2001 for Kansas City Ballet. Bolender has built a foundation of quality and grand proportion, scarcely imaginable in 1981 and now can enjoy the fruits of his own continuing creativity.

He was active in the preservation of Balanchine’s work, coaching dancers in his roles in the repertoire for the Balanchine Foundation’s Film Archive and reconstructing ''Renard'' for the Kansas City Ballet in 1998 as part of the Stravinsky Festival. In 2006, Bolender was awarded the Dance Magazine Award for his lifetime achievement in dance.

Just weeks before he was to receive the award, Bolender died on October 12, 2006 at age 92 from complications related to a stroke.

The [[Todd Bolender Center for Dance and Creativity]] opened on August 26, 2011. The building is the new home for the Kansas City Ballet and the Ballet School.

After 34 successful years, Kansas City Ballet performed its final Nutcracker featuring choreography by Todd Bolender during the 2014 winter season.

A '''training ship''' is a [[ship]] used to train students as [[sailor]]s. The term is especially used for ships employed by [[navy|navies]] to train future officers.  Essentially there are two types: those used for training at sea and old hulks used to house classrooms.

The hands-on aspect provided by [[sail training]] has also been used as a platform for everything from semesters at sea for undergraduate oceanography and biology students, marine science and physical science for high school students, and character building for at-risk youths.

In the [[Sea Cadet Corps]] all [[Military unit|Units]] use a [[ship prefix]] "T.S.", followed by the ship's proper name.  For example, the Fishguard Sea Cadets' ship's name is T.S. ''Skirmisher''. The T.S. prefix is used as the [[Sea Cadets]] is not part of the [[Royal Navy]], and cannot be prefixed "[[Her Majesty's Ship|HMS]]".

The '''Tripartite programme''' was created in 1980. It allows French, German, English and Spanish outstanding students to spend two years of their university studies in two partner universities and thus obtain a tricultural scientific, technical and linguistic profile.

==Programme Description==
After a high selection based on technical training, language skills and motivation, selected students gain access to the tripartite programme.

Having previously studied for three years in their home universities, students continue their studies during two years in two of the four partner universities. Lectures are conducted in the language of the country and final year students must complete a project lasting a minimum of one semester.

==Diploma==
Studies are recognized in each partner universities. This programme is sanctioned by a diploma from the university, and the Tripartite certificate signed by the three host universities for the student.

== Partner universities==
The tripartite programme includes four European establishments well known for their academic excellence and great reputation: 

* '''{{ESP}}''' - [[Pontifical Comillas University of Madrid|Pontifical University of Comillas - ICAI - Madrid]]
* '''{{FRA}}''' - [[ESIEE|ESIEE Paris]]
* '''{{DEU}}''' - [[Universität Karlsruhe (TH)]]
* '''{{GBR}}''' - [[University of Southampton]]

The '''[[Webometrics]] Ranking of Business Schools''',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://business-schools.webometrics.info/en|title=Welcome to Ranking Web of business {{!}} Ranking Web of business|website=business-schools.webometrics.info|access-date=2017-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; also known as Ranking Web of Business Schools, is a ranking system for the world's Business Schools based on a composite indicator that takes into account both the volume of the Web contents (number of web pages and files) and the visibility and impact of these web publications according to the number of external inlinks (site citations) they received. The ranking is published by the [[Cybermetrics Lab]], a research group of the [[Spanish National Research Council]] (CSIC) located in Madrid.

This ranking was discontinued in 2013 and is no longer updated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://business-schools.webometrics.info/en|title=Welcome to Ranking Web of business {{!}} Ranking Web of business|website=business-schools.webometrics.info|access-date=2017-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This discontinued ranking is however often cited (as at 16/6/2017) by google as its main  ranking reference.

Examples are : "Spain business school ranking " = &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.google.ch/search?q=spain+business+school+ranking&amp;oq=spain+business+school+ranking&amp;gs_l=serp.1.0.0j0i5i30k1l2j0i8i30k1l2.193838.194464.0.196438.5.5.0.0.0.0.80.354.5.5.0....0...1.1.64.serp..0.5.344...0i7i30k1j0i8i7i30k1j0i7i5i30k1.qHo7b4xMOXM|title=spain business school ranking - Google-Suche|last=|first=|date=|website=goo.gl|language=de-CH|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "Zurich business school ranking" &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.google.ch/search?q=zurich+business+school+ranking&amp;oq=zurich+business+school+ranking&amp;gs_l=serp.3..0i7i30k1j0j0i7i30k1j0i5i30k1l2j0i8i30k1.166270.167465.0.168302.6.6.0.0.0.0.104.388.4j1.5.0....0...1.1.64.serp..1.5.388...0i8i7i30k1j0i7i5i30k1.IAj3IJiJF5g|title=zurich business school ranking - Google-Suche|last=|first=|date=|website=goo.gl|language=de-CH|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; etc.
