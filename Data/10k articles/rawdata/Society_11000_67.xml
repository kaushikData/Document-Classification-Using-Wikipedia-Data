== Later life and alleged al-Qaeda ties ==

===In the United States; 1990–2002===
In 1991, al-Awlaki returned to the U.S. to attend college. He earned a [[Bachelor of science|B.S.]] in [[Civil engineering|Civil Engineering]] from [[Colorado State University]] (1994), where he was president of the [[Muslim Student Association]].&lt;ref name="nytimes2" /&gt; He attended the university on a foreign [[student visa]] and a government scholarship from Yemen, claiming to be born in that country, according to a former U.S. security agent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Herridge |first=Catherine |url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2010/04/12/radical-muslim-cleric-lied-qualify-funded-college-scholarship/ |title=Radical Muslim Cleric Lied to Qualify for U.S.-Funded College Scholarship |publisher=[[Fox News]] |date=April 12, 2010 |accessdate=April 16, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100416161600/http://www.foxnews.com/us/2010/04/12/radical-muslim-cleric-lied-qualify-funded-college-scholarship/ |archivedate=April 16, 2010 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, while still a college student in [[Colorado State University|Colorado State]]'s civil engineering program, al-Awlaki visited [[Afghanistan]] in the aftermath of the [[Soviet–Afghan War|Soviet occupation]]. He spent some time training with the ''[[mujahideen]]'' who were fighting the Soviets. He was depressed by the country's poverty and hunger, and "wouldn't have gone with al-Qaeda," according to friends from Colorado State, who said he was profoundly affected by the trip.&lt;ref name="usatoday1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ghosh" /&gt;&lt;ref name="criticalthreats"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.criticalthreats.org/yemen/militant-islams-global-preacher-radicalizing-effect-sheikh-anwar-al-awlaki|last=Zimmerman|first=Katherine |date=March 12, 2010 |title=Preacher: The Radicalizing Effect of Sheikh Anwar al Awlaki|newspaper=[[American Enterprise Institute]]|accessdate=May 15, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100526032647/http://www.criticalthreats.org/yemen/militant-islams-global-preacher-radicalizing-effect-sheikh-anwar-al-awlaki |archivedate=May 26, 2010 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mullah]] [[Mohammed Omar]] did not form the [[Taliban]] until 1994.

[[File:NAlhazmi.JPG|thumb|180px|9/11 hijacker &lt;br /&gt;[[Nawaf al-Hazmi]], for whom al-Awlaki was reportedly a spiritual adviser in San Diego]]

When police investigating the 9/11 attacks raided the [[Hamburg]] apartment of [[Ramzi bin al-Shibh]], they found the telephone number of al-Awlaki among bin al-Shibh's personal contacts.&lt;ref name=inf /&gt;&lt;ref name="wash post" /&gt; The FBI interviewed al-Awlaki four times in the eight days following the 9/11 attacks.&lt;ref name="foxnews2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes2" /&gt; One detective later told the 9/11 Commission he believed al-Awlaki "was at the center of the 9/11 story".

Six days after the 9/11 attacks, al-Awlaki [[9/11 Truth movement|suggested]] in writing on the ''[[IslamOnline.net]]'' website that Israeli intelligence agents might have been responsible for the attacks, and that the FBI "went into the roster of the airplanes, and whoever has a Muslim or Arab name became the hijacker by default".&lt;ref name="wash post" /&gt;

Soon after the 9/11 attacks, al-Awlaki was sought in Washington, D.C. by the media to answer questions about Islam, its rituals, and its relation to the attacks.

U.S. Congressman [[Frank Wolf (politician)|Frank Wolf]] (R-VA) and several congressional committees urged FBI Director [[Robert Mueller]] to provide an explanation about the bureau’s interactions with al-Awlaki, including why he was released from federal custody when there was an outstanding warrant for his arrest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Catherine |last=Herridge |title=Mueller grilled on FBI's release of al-Awlaki in 2002 |date=March 8, 2012 |url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2012/03/07/mueller-grilled-on-fbis-release-al-awlaki-in-2002/ |publisher=Fox News |accessdate=March 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The motion for rescinding the arrest warrant was approved by a magistrate judge on October 10 and filed on October 11.&lt;ref name=inf /&gt;

While living in Northern Virginia, al-Awlaki visited [[Ali al-Timimi]], later known as a radical Islamic cleric.

Al-Awlaki provided al-Qaeda members in Yemen with the protection of his powerful tribe, the Awlakis, against the government.

====Fort Hood shooter====

[[File:Major Nidal Hassan.jpg|thumb|Convicted Fort Hood shooter [[Nidal Malik Hasan]]]]

[[2009 Fort Hood shooting|Fort Hood shooter]] [[Nidal Malik Hasan]] was investigated by the FBI after intelligence agencies intercepted at least 18 e-mails between him and al-Awlaki between December 2008 and June 2009.&lt;ref name= lev&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www2.readingeagle.com/article.aspx?id=169641|last1= Hess |first1=Pamela|first2=Anne|last2= Gearan|date=November 21, 2009 |title= Levin: More e-mails from Ft.

Even if he was exchanging recipes, the bureau should have put out an alert."&lt;ref name=dal/&gt; A DC-based Joint Terrorism Task Force operating under the FBI was notified of the e-mails, and reviewed the information. Army employees were informed of the e-mails, but they didn't perceive any terrorist threat in Hasan's questions. Instead, they viewed them as general questions about spiritual guidance with regard to conflicts between Islam and military service, and judged them to be consistent with legitimate mental health research about Muslims in the armed services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.themonitor.com/articles/span-32450-hasan-class.html|date=November 10, 2009|title=FBI reassessing past look at Fort Hood suspect|author=Associated Press staff|agency=Associated Press|publisher=The Monitor (McAllen, TX)|accessdate=May 11, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120912002818/http://www.themonitor.com/articles/span-32450-hasan-class.html|archivedate=September 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The assessment was that there was not sufficient information for a larger investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/11/11/national/main5612152.shtml|title=Hasan's Ties Spark Government Blame Game|author=CBS/AP staff|publisher=CBS News|agency=Associated Press|date=November 11, 2009 |accessdate=January 24, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100105161340/http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/11/11/national/main5612152.shtml| archivedate= January 5, 2010 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one of the e-mails, Hasan wrote al-Awlaki: "I can't wait to join you [in the afterlife]". "It sounds like [[code word]]s," said Lt. Col. Tony Shaffer, a military analyst at the [[Center for Advanced Defense Studies]]. "That he's actually either offering himself up, or that he's already crossed that line in his own mind."&lt;ref name="cant wait"/&gt;

Yemeni journalist Abdulelah Hider Shaea interviewed al-Awlaki in November 2009.&lt;ref name="confidant"/&gt; Al-Awlaki acknowledged his correspondence with Hasan. He said he "neither ordered nor pressured ... Hasan to harm Americans." Al-Awlaki said Hasan first e-mailed him December 17, 2008, introducing himself by writing: "Do you remember me? I used to pray with you at the Virginia mosque." Hasan said he had become a devout Muslim around the time al-Awlaki was preaching at [[Dar al-Hijrah]], in 2001 and 2002, and al-Awlaki said 'Maybe Nidal was affected by one of my lectures.'" He added: "It was clear from his e-mails that Nidal trusted me. Nidal told me: 'I speak with you about issues that I never speak with anyone else.'" Al-Awlaki said Hasan arrived at his own conclusions regarding the acceptability of violence in Islam, and said he was not the one to initiate this. Shaea said, "Nidal was providing evidence to Anwar, not vice versa."&lt;ref name="confidant"/&gt;

Asked whether Hasan mentioned Fort Hood as a target in his e-mails, Shaea declined to comment. However, al-Awlaki said the shooting was acceptable in Islam because it was a form of ''jihad'', as the West began the hostilities with the Muslims.&lt;ref name="Yemeni reporter"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/11/16/imam-al-awlaki-says-he-di_n_358748.html|title=Imam Al Awlaki Says He Did Not Pressure Accused Fort Hood Gunman Nidal Hasan|author=Associated Press staff|agency=Associated Press|location=Washington|publisher=The Huffington Post|date=November 16, 2009|accessdate=May 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Awlaki said he "blessed the act because it was against a military target.

Al-Awlaki's e-mail conversations with Hasan were not released, and he was not placed on the FBI Most Wanted list, indicted for treason, or officially named as a co-conspirator with Hasan. The US government was reluctant to classify the Fort Hood shooting as a terrorist incident, or identify any motive.  ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' reported in January 2010 that al-Awlaki had not "played a direct role" in any of the attacks, and noted he had never been charged with a crime in the US.&lt;ref name="coker1"/&gt;

One of his fellow officers at Fort Hood said Hasan was enthusiastic about al-Awlaki.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/2009/11/11/2009-11-11_who_is_anwar_alawlaki_imam_contacted_by_fort_hood_gunman_nidal_malik_hasan_has_l.html|last=Sacks|first= Ethan|title=Who is Anwar al-Awlaki?

According to a number of sources, Al-Awlaki and [[Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab]], the convicted al-Qaeda attempted bomber of [[Northwest Airlines Flight 253]] on December 25, 2009, had contacts.

==Lawsuit against the US==

In July 2010, al-Awlaki's father, Nasser al-Awlaki, contacted the [[Center for Constitutional Rights]] and the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] to represent his son in a lawsuit that sought to remove Anwar from the targeted killing list.&lt;ref&gt;CCR, [http://www.ccrjustice.org/targetedkillings "''CCR and the ACLU v. OFAC'' &amp; ''Al-Aulaqi v. Obama''"]&lt;/ref&gt; ACLU's [[Jameel Jaffer]] said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;the United States is not at war in Yemen, and the government doesn't have a blank check to kill terrorism suspects wherever they are in the world. Among the arguments we'll be making is that, outside actual war zones, the authority to use lethal force is narrowly circumscribed, and preserving the rule of law depends on keeping this authority narrow.&lt;ref name="seerpress_lawsuit"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://seerpress.com/cia-on-the-verge-of-lawsuit/3341/ |title=CIA on the verge of lawsuit |publisher=Seer Press News |date=August 5, 2010 |author=Mark Wilson}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Lawyers for Specially Designated Global Terrorists must obtain a special license from the US Treasury Department before they can represent their clients in court.

In a letter dated May 22, 2013, to the chairman of the US Senate Judiciary committee, [[Patrick J. Leahy]], US attorney general Eric Holder wrote that

&lt;blockquote&gt;high-level U.S. government officials [...] concluded that al-Aulaqi posed a continuing and imminent threat of violent attack against the United States. Before carrying out the operation that killed al-Aulaqi, senior officials also determined, based on a careful evaluation of the circumstances at the time, that it was not feasible to capture al-Aulaqi. In addition, senior officials determined that the operation would be conducted consistent with applicable law of war principles, including the cardinal principles of (1) necessity – the requirement that the target have definite military value; (2) distinction – the idea that only military objectives may be intentionally targeted and that civilians are protected from being intentionally targeted; (3) proportionality – the notion that the anticipated collateral damage of an action cannot be excessive in relation to the anticipated concrete and direct military advantage; and (4) humanity – a principle that requires us to use weapons that will not inflict unnecessary suffering. The operation was also undertaken consistent with Yemeni sovereignty.

Awlaki's videos and writings remain highly popular on the internet, where they continue to be readily accessible.&lt;ref name="pool"&gt;{{cite news |date=September 22, 2016 |title=‘In-Betweeners’ Are Part of a Rich Recruiting Pool for Jihadists |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/23/us/isis-al-qaeda-recruits-anwar-al-awlaki.html |newspaper=The New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt; Even following his death, Awlaki has continued to inspire his devotees to carry out terrorist attacks, including the 2013 [[Boston Marathon bombing]], the [[2015 San Bernardino attack]], and the [[2016 Orlando nightclub shooting]].&lt;ref name="urged"&gt;{{cite news |date=December 18, 2015 |title=Internet Firms Urged to Limit Work of Anwar al-Awlaki |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/19/us/politics/internet-firms-urged-to-limit-work-of-anwar-al-awlaki.html?smid=tw-share |newspaper=The New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=June 21, 2016 |title=Friend Who Told FBI About Orlando Shooter Omar Mateen Saw a 'Red Flag' |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/orlando-nightclub-massacre/friend-who-told-fbi-about-orlando-shooter-omar-mateen-saw-n596496 |agency=NBC News }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Counter Extremism Project]] (CEP), 88 "extremists," 54 in the U.S. and 34 in Europe, have been influenced by Awlaki.&lt;ref name="pool"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date= |title=Anwar al-Awlaki’s Ties to Extremists |url=http://www.counterextremism.com/anwar-al-awlaki |agency=Counter Extremism Project }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because "his work has inspired countless plots and attacks," CEP has "called on YouTube and other platforms to permanently ban Mr. Awlaki’s material, including his early, mainstream lectures."&lt;ref name="urged"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=December 21, 2015 |title=CEP Highlights Importance of Removing Anwar al-Awlaki from Social Media – Particularly YouTube |url=http://www.counterextremism.com/press/cep-highlights-importance-removing-anwar-al-awlaki-social-media-%E2%80%93-particularly-youtube |agency=Counter Extremism Project }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==FOIA documents==
During the FBI investigation of the 9/11 attacks, it was discovered that a few of the attackers had attended the mosques in San Diego and Falls Church with which al-Awlaki was associated. Interviews with members of the San Diego mosque showed that Nawaz al-Hazmi, one of the attackers, may have had a private conversation with him. On that basis he was placed under 24-hour surveillance. It was discovered that he regularly patronized prostitutes.&lt;ref name=FBI6202&gt;{{cite news|author=Pasquale D’Amuro |title=F.B.I.

Shortly thereafter, he left the United States.&lt;ref name=Lessons/&gt;

In January 2013, Fox News announced that FBI documents obtained by [[Judicial Watch]] through a [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] request showed possible connections between al-Awlaki and the September 11 attackers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Catherine | last = Herridge | title = Cleric may have booked pre-9/11 flights for hijackers, FBI documents show | date = January 4, 2013 | url = http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/01/03/exclusive-al-awlaki-booked-pre-11-air-travel-for-hijackers-fbi-documents-show/ | work = Fox News | accessdate = January 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Judicial Watch, the documents show that the FBI knew that al-Awlaki had bought tickets for three of the hijackers to fly into Florida and Las Vegas. Judicial Watch further stated that al-Awlaki "was a central focus of the FBI's investigation of 9/11. They show he wasn't cooperative. And they show that he was under surveillance."

When queried by Fox News, the FBI denied having evidence connecting al-Awlaki and the September 11 attacks: "The FBI cautions against drawing conclusions from redacted FOIA documents. The FBI and investigating bodies have not found evidence connecting Anwar al-Awlaki and the attack on September 11, 2001. The document referenced does not link Anwar al-Awlaki with any purchase of airline tickets for the hijackers."

==Family==

===Abdulrahman al-Awlaki===
{{main|Abdulrahman al-Awlaki}}
Anwar al-Awlaki and [[Egypt]]ian-born Gihan Mohsen Baker had a son, Abdulrahman Anwar al-Awlaki, born August 26, 1995 in [[Denver]], who was an American citizen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/world/documents/abdulrahman-al-awlaki-birth-certificate.html |title=Abdulrahman al-Awlaki's birth certificate |publisher=The Washington Post |accessdate=November 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abdulrahman al-Awlaki was killed on October 14, 2011 in Yemen at the age of 16 in an American drone strike. Nine other people were killed in the same CIA-initiated attack, including a 17-year-old cousin of Abdulrahman.&lt;ref name="time.com"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2097899,00.html | work=Time | title=An American Teenager in Yemen: Paying for the Sins of His Father? | date=October 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to his relatives, shortly before his father's death, Abdulrahman had left the family home in Sana'a and travelled to Shabwa in search of his father who was believed to be in hiding in that area (though he was actually hundreds of miles away at the time &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esquire.com/features/obama-lethal-presidency-0812-5 Tom Junod, "The Lethal Presidency of Barack Obama"] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.esquire.com%2Ffeatures%2Fobama-lethal-presidency-0812-5&amp;date=2013-03-16 |date=March 16, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;). Abdulrahman was sitting in an open-air cafe in Shabwa when killed. According to US officials, the killing of Abdulrahman al-Awlaki was a mistake; the intended target was an Egyptian, [[Ibrahim al-Banna]], who was not at the targeted location at the time of the attack.&lt;ref name=NYT031013/&gt; Human rights groups have raised questions as to why an American citizen was killed by the US in a country with which the United States is not officially at war. Abdulrahman al-Awlaki was not known to have any independent connection to terrorism.&lt;ref name=NYT031013/&gt;

===Nasser al-Awlaki===
Nasser al-Awlaki is the father of Anwar and grandfather of Abdulrahman al-Awlaki. Al-Awlaki stated he believed his son had been wrongly accused and was not a member of Al Qaeda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/meast/01/10/yemen.al.awlaki.father/index.html|title=Al-Awlaki's father says son is 'not Osama bin Laden'|last=Newton|first=Paula|date=January 11, 2010|publisher=CNN|accessdate=May 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the deaths of his son and grandson, Nasser in an interview in ''[[Time Magazine]]'' called the killings  a crime and condemned US President Obama directly, saying: "I urge the American people to bring the killers to justice. I urge them to expose the hypocrisy of the 2009 Nobel Prize laureate. To some, he may be that. To me and my family, he is nothing more than a child killer."&lt;ref name="articles.cnn.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="time.com"/&gt;

[[Tariq al-Dahab]], who led al-Qaeda insurgents in Yemen, was a brother-in-law of al-Awlaki.

===Nawar al-Awlaki===
On January 29, 2017, Anwar al-Awlaki's 8-year-old daughter, Nawar al-Awlaki, was killed in a [[DEVGRU]] attack ordered by President [[Donald Trump]].&lt;ref name="democracynow.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="uk.reuters.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="npr.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="6abc.com"/&gt;

==Islamic education==
Al-Awlaki's [[Islam]]ic education was primarily informal, and consisted of intermittent months with various scholars (including the Salafi teacher ibn [[Uthaymeen]]&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Denis MacEion, Middle East Quarterly, Spring 2010, p 13 -19.&lt;/ref&gt;), reading and contemplating Islamic scholarly works.&lt;ref name=nef/&gt; Some Muslim scholars {{who|date=June 2014}} said they did not understand al{{nbhyph}}Awlaki's popularity, because while he spoke fluent English and could therefore reach a large non-Arabic-speaking audience, he lacked formal Islamic training and study.&lt;ref name="atc"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=123894237|title=Officials: Cleric Had Role In Christmas Bomb Attempt|last=Temple-Raston|first=Dina|work=All Things Considered|date=February 19, 2010|publisher=National Public Radio|accessdate=March 13, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100221155037/http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=123894237| archivedate= February 21, 2010 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ideology==

While imprisoned in Yemen after 2004, al-Awlaki was influenced by the works of [[Sayyid Qutb]], described by ''The New York Times'' as an originator of the contemporary "anti-Western ''Jihadist'' movement".&lt;ref name="nytimes2"/&gt; He read 150 to 200 pages a day of Qutb's works, and described himself as "so immersed with the author I would feel Sayyid was with me in my cell speaking to me directly".&lt;ref name="nytimes2"/&gt;

Terrorism consultant [[Evan Kohlmann]] in 2009 referred to al-Awlaki as "one of the principal ''jihadi'' luminaries for would-be [[Homegrown terrorism|homegrown terrorists]]. His fluency with English, his unabashed advocacy of ''jihad'' and mujahideen organizations, and his Web-savvy approach are a powerful combination." He called al-Awlaki's lecture, "Constants on the Path of ''Jihad''", which he says was based on a similar document written by al-Qaeda's founder, the "virtual bible for lone-wolf Muslim extremists".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-fort-hood-probe9-2009nov09,0,5487900.story |last=Meyer |first=Josh |title=Fort Hood shooter's ties to mosque investigated |date=November 9, 2009 |publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]] |accessdate=January 24, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091112103822/http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-fort-hood-probe9-2009nov09%2C0%2C5487900.story |archivedate=November 12, 2009 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; Philip Mudd, formerly of the CIA's [[National Counterterrorism Center]] and the FBI's top intelligence adviser, called him "a magnetic character&amp;nbsp;... a powerful orator."&lt;ref name="nytimes2"/&gt; He attracted young men to his lectures, especially US-based and UK-based Muslims.&lt;ref name="ghosh"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Ghosh|first=Bobby|url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1953426-3,00.html|title=How Dangerous Is the Cleric Anwar al-Awlaki?|publisher=Time|date=January 13, 2010|accessdate=April 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=122062942|title=In Bomb Plot Probe, Spotlight Falls On Yemeni Cleric|first=Dina|last=Temple-Raston|publisher=NPR|date=December 30, 2009|accessdate=April 16, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100313142140/http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=122062942| archivedate= March 13, 2010 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Website===
Al-Awlaki maintained a website and [[blog]] on which he shared his views.&lt;ref name="dal"/&gt; On December 11, 2008, he said Muslims should not seek to "serve in the armies of the disbelievers and fight against his brothers".&lt;ref name=dal/&gt;

In "44 Ways to Support ''Jihad''", posted on his blog in February 2009, al-Awlaki encouraged others to "fight ''jihad''", and explained how to give money to the ''mujahideen'' or their families. Al-Awlaki's sermon encourages others to conduct weapons training, and raise children "on the love of ''Jihad''".&lt;ref name="adl.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adl.org/main_Terrorism/anwar_al-awlaki.htm|title=Profile: Anwar al-Awlaki, Introduction |publisher=[[Anti-Defamation League]]|author=ADL staff|date=May 7, 2010|accessdate=May 12, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100508110152/http://www.adl.org/main_Terrorism/anwar_al-awlaki.htm| archivedate= May 8, 2010 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also that month, he wrote: "I pray that Allah destroys America and all its allies."&lt;ref name=dal /&gt; He wrote as well: "We will implement the rule of Allah on Earth by the tip of the sword, whether the masses like it or not."&lt;ref name=dal /&gt; On July 14, he said that Muslim countries should not offer military assistance to the US.

They are the party of the devils", al-Awlaki said.&lt;ref name="nytimes4"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gulf-times.com/site/topics/article.asp?cu_no=2&amp;item_no=397344&amp;version=1&amp;template_id=37&amp;parent_id=17 |title=Kill Americans at will, says US-Yemeni cleric |publisher=[[Gulf Times]] |date=November 9, 2010 |accessdate=November 8, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101113013709/http://gulf-times.com/site/topics/article.asp?cu_no=2&amp;item_no=397344&amp;version=1&amp;template_id=37&amp;parent_id=17 |archivedate=November 13, 2010 |deadurl=yes  }}&lt;/ref&gt; That month, Intelligence Research Specialist Kevin Yorke of the [[New York Police Department]]'s Counterterrorism Division called him "the most dangerous man in the world".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://liveshots.blogs.foxnews.com/2010/11/10/anwar-awlaki-most-dangerous-man-in-world/|title=Anwar Awlaki "Most Dangerous Man in World"|publisher=Fox News|date=April 7, 2010|accessdate=November 11, 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101113083734/http://liveshots.blogs.foxnews.com/2010/11/10/anwar-awlaki-most-dangerous-man-in-world/|archivedate=November 13, 2010|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/awlaki-dangerous-man-world/story?id=12109217|author1=Matthew Cole |author2=Aaron Katersky |title=Awlaki: 'The Most Dangerous Man in The World' |publisher=ABC News |date=October 29, 2010 |accessdate=November 11, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101112195631/http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/awlaki-dangerous-man-world/story?id=12109217| archivedate= November 12, 2010 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Blou''' is a band from [[Meteghan, Nova Scotia]].  The group claims a unique style of music which they call "Acadico" – a mix of [[Acadian]], [[Cajun]] and [[Zydeco]] styles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.voicemagazine.org/2009/01/23/in-conversation-with-patrice-boulianne-of-blou/|title=In Conversation With Patrice Boulianne Of Blou|work=Voice Magazine|date=January 23, 2009|accessdate=September 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group takes its name from the street where the founding member Patrice Boulianne resides: "L'Allée des Blou" was named after an aboriginal man purported to have lived at the end of that street 100 years ago or more.

== History ==
Blou began in the autumn of 1994 in the [[Canadian]] province of [[Nova Scotia]].
In 1998, Blou self-produced its first recording, "Acadico". "Acadico" was the first CD by an Acadian artist that had a European distribution.

In 2000, Blou changed its lineup.  Their second album, "Rhythm 'N Blou" had a more upbeat sound than "Acadico" and the band toured internationally.  In 2003, Blou released his third album to celebrate his upcoming tenth anniversary.  Also that year BLOU won the ''Prix ZOF-PassepArt-TV5'' award.  On October 17, 2005, Blou released the first single, "Come Away Café" from their unreleased fourth album, "Pied-à-terre."  "Pied-à-terre" was later released on February 14, 2006.

In 2012, the group won Fan's Choice Entertainer of the Year [[East Coast Music Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/nova-scotia-s-blou-takes-top-ecma-award-1.1247841|title=Nova Scotia's Blou takes top ECMA award|work=CBC News|date=April 15, 2012|accessdate=September 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Book scouting''' is the process whereby a book in one [[language]] or market is brought to the attention of a publisher in another language or market. [[File:Book.jpg|thumb|220px|alt=text|An open book.]]

==Information==
Book scouts are the individuals who carry out this process. Many book scouts in a particular market work on retainer for one or more [[publisher]]s or literary agencies in another market. When a potentially interesting book in the book scout's market is published, he or she will make his or her clients in the other market aware of this literary property. There is no conflict of interest for the book scout in representing multiple publishers, so long as there is no overlap in the type of book being scouted. For instance, a book scout cannot represent two or more romance novel publishers, but is free to represent a business publisher and a science publisher for the same particular market. 

There are also book scouts for [[Hollywood]], ferreting out books from the publishing industry and presenting them to Hollywood studios, [[film producer|producer]]s, [[film director|director]]s and stars.

Within the [[Christian]] tradition, '''bridal theology''', also referred to as '''mystical marriage''', is the [[New Testament]] portrayal of communion with Jesus as a marriage, and God's reign as a wedding banquet.&lt;ref name=Kenda&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Kenda  | first1 = Creasy Dean | title = Practicing passion: youth and the quest for a passionate church | year = 2004 | publisher = Eerdmans Pub. | location = Grand Rapids, Mich.  | isbn = 0-8028-4712-9 | pages = 124–126 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This tradition in turn traces back to the [[Old Testament]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Balthasar | first1 = Hans Urs von | last2 = Fessio | first2 = Joseph | last3 = Riches | first3 = John Kenneth | title = The glory of the Lord: a theological aesthetics | year = 1983 | publisher = Ignatius Press  | location = San Francisco  | isbn = 0-89870-249-6 | pages =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; This theology has influenced the works of [[Catherine of Siena]], [[Teresa of Ávila]], [[Gregory the Great]] and [[Bernard of Clairvaux]].&lt;ref name=Kenda/&gt; A similar concept existed in [[Valentinianism|Valentinian Gnosticism]] with the notion of the [[Valentinianism#Bridal_Chamber|bridal chamber]], which involved a marriage to one's heavenly counterpart.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gnosis.org/library/valentinus/Valentinian_Sacramental.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;  Philip L. Tite, [https://books.google.com/books?id=5Rx0oruxQg0C&amp;pg=PA2&amp;lpg=PA2&amp;dq=valentinian+bridal+chamber&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=784kHiP7dc&amp;sig=WjnkFy_8O0XIeuZ0WCCQMixFwmo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=qVJyUN7AGu200AGC1oCYCw&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=valentinian%20bridal%20chamber&amp;f=false ''Valentinian Ethics and Paraenetic Discourse'']&lt;/ref&gt; Some mystics take this 'marriage' as a symbol of Union with God and hence, no negative connotations are sharpened for orthodox thinkers.

In a cult, originating in the '60s, that is known as [[The Family International]], a particularly radical form of bridal theology is taught: members of the group of both sexes are encouraged to masturbate while visualizing themselves as women having sex with Jesus. This is known within the cult as the "Loving Jesus revelation"; &lt;ref name="tfi"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xfamily.org/index.php/Loving_Jesus|title=Loving Jesus}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, it does not accurately reflect mainstream conceptions of bridal theology, and is not accepted beyond the cult of its origin.

'''CBAFT-DT''' (branded on-air as '''ICI Acadie''') is the [[Ici Radio-Canada Télé]] [[owned-and-operated station|owned-and-operated]] [[television station]] for [[Atlantic Canada]], serving [[Acadians]] in [[the Maritimes]] and [[Franco-Newfoundlander]]s in [[Newfoundland and Labrador]]. The station is licensed to [[Moncton]], [[New Brunswick]], Canada.

Owned by the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|Société Radio-Canada]] (CBC), it broadcasts a [[high-definition television|high-definition]] [[digital television|digital]] signal on VHF channel 11 from a transmitter located at its studios on Timberline Road and its studios located at 165 Main Street in Moncton near the city of [[Dieppe, New Brunswick]]. This station can also be seen on [[Rogers Cable]] digital channel 601. There is a high definition feed offered on [[Bell Aliant]] [[Fibe (Bell Aliant)|Fibe TV]] channel 902. This station is also available on [[Bell TV]] channel 100 and in high definition on channel 1801. For [[Eastlink (company)|Eastlink]] subscribers, however, it's only offered in standard definition (the high definition signal on channel 1017 comes from [[CBLFT-DT]] in Toronto).

Prior to September 2, 2008, the station was known as ''Télévision de Radio-Canada Atlantique''. It was rebranded to "Télévision de Radio-Canada Acadie" as part of the public broadcaster's efforts to better reflect the region it serves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Découvrez Radio-Canada Acadie | url = http://www.radio-canada.ca/regions/atlantique/special/acadie.shtml | accessdate = 2008-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The station was launched at 6:25&amp;nbsp;p.m. on December 21, 1959 from Moncton on channel 11. The station slowly added rebroadcasters, such as one serving Fredericton and [[Saint John, New Brunswick|Saint John]] in 1973 on channel 5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = CBAFT Station History | url = http://www.broadcasting-history.ca/listings_and_histories/television/histories.php?id=67&amp;historyID=89 | accessdate = 2007-12-17 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071031151617/http://www.broadcasting-history.ca/listings_and_histories/television/histories.php?id=67&amp;historyID=89# | archive-date = 2007-10-31 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Radio-Canada later converted [[CJBR-DT|CJBR-TV-1]] Edmundston, a retransmitter of a former affiliate in [[Rimouski]], [[Quebec]] on channel 13, to a rebroadcaster of CBAFT.

The station operates additional news bureaus in [[Edmundston]], [[Bathurst, New Brunswick|Bathurst]], [[Caraquet]], [[Fredericton]] and [[Saint John, New Brunswick|Saint John]], [[New Brunswick]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Mise en oeuvre de l'Article 41 de la Loi sur les langues officielles: Nouveau-Brunswick Plan d'action | url = http://www.cbc.radio-canada.ca/documents/langues/2002-2003/pdf/NB02.pdf | accessdate = 2007-12-17 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080411101100/http://www.cbc.radio-canada.ca/documents/langues/2002-2003/pdf/NB02.pdf | archivedate = 2008-04-11 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Halifax, Nova Scotia|Halifax]], [[Nova Scotia]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Mise en oeuvre de l'Article 41 de la Loi sur les langues officielles: Nouvelle-Écosse Plan d'action | url = http://www.cbc.radio-canada.ca/documents/langues/2002-2003/pdf/NEcos02.pdf | accessdate = 2007-12-17 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080411101104/http://www.cbc.radio-canada.ca/documents/langues/2002-2003/pdf/NEcos02.pdf | archivedate = 2008-04-11 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. John's]], [[Newfoundland and Labrador]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Mise en oeuvre de l'Article 41 de la Loi sur les langues officielles: Terre-Neuve Plan d'action | url = http://www.cbc.radio-canada.ca/documents/langues/2002-2003/pdf/TNE02.pdf | accessdate = 2007-12-17 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080411101101/http://www.cbc.radio-canada.ca/documents/langues/2002-2003/pdf/TNE02.pdf | archivedate = 2008-04-11 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Charlottetown]], [[Prince Edward Island]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.cbc.radio-canada.ca/documents/langues/2002-2003/pdf/IPE02.pdf | title = Mise en oeuvre de l'Article 41 de la Loi sur les langues officielles: L'Île-du-Prince-Édouard Plan d'action | accessdate = 2007-12-17 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080411101102/http://www.cbc.radio-canada.ca/documents/langues/2002-2003/pdf/IPE02.pdf | archivedate = 2008-04-11 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike all other Radio-Canada stations, programming in the Atlantic region airs [[Atlantic Standard Time Zone|one hour later]] than its scheduled time in the rest of Canada: this noted by the phrase ''Une heure plus tard dans les Maritimes'', present on nearly all Radio-Canada network promos. (Due to Newfoundland's small [[Francophone]] population, the [[Newfoundland Standard Time Zone|correct time]] for programs there is only noted on local promos.)

==Local programming==
* ''[[Le Téléjournal]]/Acadie'', formerly ''Le Téléjournal/Atlantique'', daily newscast airing every day at 6:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. [[Atlantic Time Zone|AT]]. Janique LeBlanc anchors the program from Monday to Thursday. Karine Godin anchors from Friday to Sunday.
* ''Luc et Luc'' (December 2007–), a talk show hosted by comedian Luc LeBlanc. The program is recorded from the Théâtre l'Escaouette in Moncton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Luc et Luc | url = http://www.radio-canada.ca/regions/atlantique/Tele/lucetluc.shtml | accessdate = 2007-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exchange agreement with RFO===
In May 2010, it was announced that CBAFT will be exchanging news stories and reporters with Télé Saint-Pierre-et-Miquelon ([[call-sign]]: FQN), the RFO outlet for the [[France|French]] [[overseas collectivity]] of [[Saint Pierre and Miquelon]], in an agreement made with [[France Télévisions]], the public broadcaster that oversees RFO (since renamed [[Outre-Mer 1ère]], with the local affiliate called Saint-Pierre-et-Miquelon 1ère). In addition, Télé Saint-Pierre-et-Miquelon will also broadcast ''Le Téléjournal/Acadie'' to local viewers there, as well as on [[France Ô]], which showcases RFO programming for viewers in [[Metropolitan France]]. In consequence, due to Télé Saint-Pierre-et-Miquelon's availability on Canadian cable and satellite, the program will be available to viewers across Canada as well. This exchange was following the arrival of the aerial [[Télévision Numérique Terrestre|TNT]] digital television service to Saint Pierre and Miquelon, which offers only RFO and Metropolitan France channels, unlike the local cable system, which offers Canadian and American channels, including CBAFT.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radiobarachois.org/2010/05/21/france-television-et-radio-canada-signent-une-convention-d%E2%80%99echange/ Radio Barachois: "France Télévision et Radio-Canada signent une convention d’échange", May 21, 2010.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100523164259/http://www.radiobarachois.org/2010/05/21/france-television-et-radio-canada-signent-une-convention-d%E2%80%99echange/ |date=May 23, 2010 }} {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newswire.ca/fr/releases/archive/May2010/20/c5669.html Canada NewsWire: "France Télévisions et Radio-Canada signent une convention d'échange entre Radio-Canada Acadie et Saint-Pierre-et-Miquelon" (press release), May 20, 2010.] {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transmitters==
CBAFT had 21 analog television rebroadcasters throughout [[the Maritimes]].

Due to federal funding reductions to the CBC, in April 2012, the CBC responded with substantial budget cuts, which included shutting down CBC's and Radio-Canada's remaining analog transmitters on July 31, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cbc.radio-canada.ca/en/media-centre/2012/04/04/ Speaking notes for Hubert T. Lacroix regarding measures announced in the context of the Deficit Reduction Action Plan]&lt;/ref&gt; None of CBC or Radio-Canada's rebroadcasters were converted to digital.

Transmitters in mandatory markets were required to go digital or be taken off the air by the transition deadline of August 31, 2011. The CBC decided that none of its rebroadcasters would switch to digital. The following CBAFT rebroadcasters were in mandatory markets:

* CBAFT-1 and CBAFT-10 Fredericton, NB ''(CBAFT-1 served Kings County and Saint John, while CBAFT-10 offered city-grade coverage to Fredericton)''
* CBFJ-TV St John's, NL
* CBHFT Halifax, NS
* CBAFT-5 Charlottetown, PE

On August 16, 2011, the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission|CRTC]] granted the CBC permission to continue operating twenty-two repeaters in mandatory markets, including the above, in analogue until August 31, 2012, by which time they must either convert to digital or shut down.

'''''Codex Chimalpopoca''''' or '''''Códice Chimalpopoca''''' is a [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire|postconquest]] cartographic [[Aztec codices|Aztec codex]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Gibson (historian)|Gibson, Charles]] and John B. Glass. "Prose sources in the Native Historical Tradition", article 27B. "A Census of Middle American Prose Manuscripts in the Native Historical Tradition". ''Guide to Ethnohistorical Sources'' Part 4; ''Handbook of Middle American Indians''. University of Texas Press 1975, census #1028 pp. 333.&lt;/ref&gt; which is officially listed as being in the collection of the [[Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia]] located in Mexico City under "Collección Antiguo no. 159". However, the current whereabouts of the codex are unknown. It appears to sadly have been lost in the mid-twentieth century.{{sfn|Bierhorst|1992|p=10}} Study of the codex is therefore necessarily provided only through copies and photographs. The codex consists of three parts, two of which are more important, one that regards the pre-Hispanic history of Central Mexico, the ''Anales de Cuauhtitlan'' and the other that regards the study of Aztec cosmology, the ''Leyenda de los Soles''.

== Physical characteristics ==
According to [[Walter Lehmann (ethnologist)|Walter Lehmann]], who studied the Codex in 1909 and 1926 when it was housed at the Museo Nacional de México, the manuscript was about 22&amp;nbsp;cm high and 15&amp;nbsp;cm long. The paper was thin and yellowed with worn edges.{{sfn|Bierhorst|1992|p=11}}

== Name ==
The title page ''Codice Chimalpopoca'' is accompanied by the date 1849 and a note explaining that the name was given it by [[Charles Étienne Brasseur de Bourbourg]], in honor of a Mexican scholar of the early nineteenth century, Faustino Galicia Chimalpopoca.

== History ==
The original of the manuscript is unknown and the original is probably a copy of an even older work. The three parts of the copied manuscript in Mexico's National Institute are all in one hand. The script is provided with cover pages bearing the genealogy of Mexican historian [[Fernando de Alva Cortés Ixtlilxochitl]].{{sfn|Bierhorst|1992|p=12}} Although Ixtlilxochitl himself does not make mention anywhere in his works of this manuscript, it is tempting to speculate that he is the copyist.{{sfn|Graulich|1987|p=32}} In the mid-eighteenth century, the well known collector [[Lorenzo Boturini Benaduci]] describes a manuscript that closely resembles the Codex Chimalpopoca, and specifies that it was copied by Ixtlilxochitl. What is known is that at the end of the eighteenth century, Mexican scholar [[Antonio de León y Gama]] made a copy of the manuscript, which is preserved at the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]].{{sfn|Bierhorst|1992|p=11}} Following the disappearance of the original manuscript, probably in 1949, the best source for its study is the photograph of the original that was taken by [[Primo Feliciano Velázquez]] in 1945.{{sfn|Bierhorst|1992|p=11}}

== Contents ==
Codex Chimalpopoca is composed of three parts unrelated to each other. The first part, called ''Anales de Cuauhtitlan'' (Annals of Cuautitlán), is a work in the [[Nahuatl]], which takes its name from the city of [[Cuautitlán]]. The content is primarily historical. It nevertheless contains a brief version of the ''Leyenda de los Soles'' (Legend of the Suns). This part occupies pages 1–68 of the codex. The second part, with the title ''Breve relación de los dioses y ritos de la gentilidad'', consists of a short book written in Spanish (pages 69–74 of the manuscript) by a certain Indian cleric of the sixteenth and seventeenth century, Pedro Ponce de León,{{sfn|Bierhorst|1992|p=11}} which deals with Aztec deities and rites. The third part, called ''Leyenda de los Soles'' is another work in Nahuatl that develops versions of the most frequently cited sun legends (pages 75–84). The Codex's name was given it by [[Francisco del Paso y Troncoso]] in 1903.{{sfn|Bierhorst|1992|p=13}} The second section, the Breve relación, is not included in the 1945 copy.

A '''commodity market''' is a market that trades in primary [[Sector (economy)|economic sector]] rather than manufactured products. [[Soft commodity|Soft commodities]] are agricultural products such as [[wheat]], [[coffee]], [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]], fruit and [[sugar]]. Hard commodities are mined, such as [[gold]] and [[Crude oil|oil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/softcommodity.asp#axzz2EGf9ZeC2 |title=Soft Commodity Definition |publisher=Investopedia |date=15 February 2009 |accessdate=6 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Investors access about 50 major commodity markets worldwide with purely financial transactions increasingly outnumbering physical trades in which goods are delivered. [[Futures contract]]s are the oldest way of investing in commodities. Futures are secured by physical assets.&lt;ref name=washingtonpost21apr2010 /&gt; Commodity markets can include physical trading and derivatives trading using [[spot price]]s, [[Forward contract|forwards]], [[futures contract|futures]], and [[option (finance)|options]] on futures. Farmers have used a simple form of derivative trading in the commodity market for centuries for price risk management.&lt;ref name=NFA2006&gt;

A [[Derivative (finance)|financial derivative]] is a financial instrument whose value is derived from a commodity termed an [[Underlying|underlier]].&lt;ref name=washingtonpost21apr2010&gt;

An increasing number of derivatives are traded via [[Clearing house (finance)|clearing houses]] some with [[Central Counterparty Clearing]], which provide clearing and settlement services on a futures exchange, as well as off-exchange in the OTC market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chicagofed.org/webpages/publications/understanding_derivatives/index.cfm |title=Understanding Derivatives: Markets and Infrastructure - Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago |work=Chicagofed.org |date= |accessdate=23 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Derivatives such as futures contracts, [[Swap (finance)|Swaps]] (1970s-), Exchange-traded Commodities (ETC) (2003-), forward contracts have become the primary trading instruments in commodity markets. Futures are traded on regulated [[commodities exchange]]s. Over-the-counter (OTC) contracts are "privately negotiated bilateral contracts entered into between the contracting parties directly".&lt;ref name=DerivativesCanada&gt;

[[Exchange-traded fund]]s (ETFs) began to feature commodities in 2003. Gold ETFs are based on "electronic gold" that does not entail the ownership of physical bullion, with its added costs of insurance and storage in repositories such as the [[London bullion market]]. According to the [[World Gold Council]], ETFs allow investors to be exposed to the gold market without the risk of price [[volatility (finance)|volatility]] associated with gold as a physical commodity.&lt;ref name=GoldMutualVSETF&gt;

== History ==
Commodity-based money and commodity markets in a crude early form are believed to have originated in [[Sumer]] between 4500 BC and 4000 BC. Sumerians first used [[clay]] tokens sealed in a clay vessel, then [[Sumer#Mathematics|clay writing tablets]] to represent the amount—for example, the number of goats, to be delivered.&lt;ref name=forbesindia16jan2013&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; These promises of time and date of delivery resemble [[futures contract]].

Early civilizations variously used pigs, rare seashells, or other items as [[commodity money]]. Since that time traders have sought ways to simplify and standardize trade contracts.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

[[Gold]] and [[silver]] markets evolved in classical civilizations. At first the precious metals were valued for their beauty and intrinsic worth and were associated with royalty.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}} In time, they were used for trading and were exchanged for other goods and commodities, or for payments of labor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://commodityhq.com/2012/a-brief-2000-year-history-of-silver-prices/ The Historical Value of Silver: A 2000-Year Overview]&lt;/ref&gt; Gold, measured out, then became money. Gold's scarcity, its unique density and the way it could be easily melted, shaped, and measured made it a natural trading asset.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.onlygold.com/tutorialpages/historyfs.htm History of gold]&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in the late 10th century, commodity markets grew as a mechanism for allocating goods, labor, land and capital across Europe. Between the late 11th and the late 13th century, English urbanization, regional specialization, expanded and improved infrastructure, the increased use of coinage and the proliferation of markets and fairs were evidence of commercialization.&lt;ref name=comarhistoryHolland2010&gt;

The [[Amsterdam Stock Exchange]], often cited as the first stock exchange, originated as a market for the exchange of commodities. Early trading on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange often involved the use of very sophisticated contracts, including short sales, forward contracts, and options. "Trading took place at the Amsterdam Bourse, an open aired
venue, which was created as a commodity exchange in 1530 and rebuilt in 1608. Commodity exchanges themselves were a relatively recent invention, existing in only a handful of cities."&lt;ref name=Stringham&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stringham|first1=Edward|title=The Extralegal Development of Securities Trading in Seventeenth Century Amsterdam|journal=Quarterly Review of Economics and Finance|date=2003|volume=43|issue=2|page=321|ssrn=1676251|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1864, in the United States, wheat, corn, cattle, and pigs were widely traded using standard instruments on the [[Chicago Board of Trade]] (CBOT), the world's oldest futures and options exchange. Other food commodities were added to the [[Commodity Exchange Act]] and traded through CBOT in the 1930s and 1940s, expanding the list from grains to include rice, mill feeds, butter, eggs, Irish potatoes and soybeans.&lt;ref&gt;

Through the 19th century "the exchanges became effective spokesmen for, and innovators of, improvements in transportation, warehousing, and financing, which paved the way to expanded interstate and international trade."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=US Commodity Futures Trading Handbook Volume 1 Strategic Information and Regulations |ISBN=1577516095

Reputation and clearing became central concerns, and states that could handle them most effectively developed powerful financial centers.&lt;ref name="HistoryCFuturesMarkham1987"&gt;

==Commodity price index==
In 1934, the US [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]] began the computation of a daily [[Commodity price index]] that became available to the public in 1940. By 1952, the Bureau of Labor Statistics issued a [[Spot Market Price Index]] that measured the price movements of "22 sensitive basic commodities whose markets are presumed to be among the first to be influenced by changes in economic conditions. As such, it serves as one early indication of impending changes in business activity."&lt;ref name=CRBspotindex2006&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commodity index fund==
A [[commodity index fund]] is a fund whose assets are invested in financial instruments based on or linked to a commodity index. In just about every case the index is in fact a Commodity Futures Index. The first such index was the [[Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index|Commodity Research Bureau (CRB) Index]], which began in 1958. Its construction made it unuseful as an investment index. The first practically investable commodity futures index was the [[Goldman Sachs Commodity Index]], created in 1991,&lt;ref name="bub"&gt;"The Food Bubble", Frederick Kaufman, Harper's, 2010 July&lt;/ref&gt; and known as the "GSCI". The next was the Dow Jones AIG Commodity Index. It differed from the GSCI primarily in the weights allocated to each commodity. The DJ AIG had mechanisms to periodically limit the weight of any one commodity and to remove commodities whose weights became too small. After [[AIG]]'s financial problems in 2008 the Index rights were sold to [[UBS]] and it is now known as the DJUBS index. Other commodity indices include the Reuters / CRB index (which is the old CRB Index as re-structured in 2005) and the Rogers Index.

==Cash commodity==
Cash commodities or "actuals" refer to the physical goods—e.g., wheat, corn, soybeans, crude oil, gold, silver—that someone is buying/selling/trading as distinguished from derivatives.&lt;ref name=NFA2006 /&gt;

==Call options ==
In a [[call option]] [[counterparty|counterparties]] enter into a financial contract option where the buyer purchases the right but not the obligation to buy an agreed quantity of a particular commodity or financial instrument (the underlying) from the seller of the option at a certain time (the expiration date) for a certain price (the [[strike price]]). The seller (or "writer") is obligated to sell the commodity or financial instrument should the buyer so decide. The buyer pays a fee (called a premium) for this right.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In 1992 the  [[Financial Information eXchange]] (FIX) protocol was introduced, allowing international real-time exchange of information regarding market transactions. The [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] ordered U.S. stock markets to convert from the [[imperial units|fractional system]] to a [[Decimal|decimal system]] by April 2001. [[Metrification]], conversion from the [[imperial units|imperial system of measurement]] to the [[metric system|metrical]], increased throughout the 20th century.&lt;ref name=decimal&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001 the [[Chicago Board of Trade]] and the [[Chicago Mercantile Exchange]] (later merged into the CME group, the world's largest futures exchange company)&lt;ref name=decimal /&gt; launched their FIX-compliant interface.

By 2011, the [[alternative trading system]] (ATS) of [[Electronic communication network|electronic trading]] featured computers buying and selling without human dealer intermediation. [[High-frequency trading]] (HFT) algorithmic trading, had almost phased out "dinosaur floor-traders".&lt;ref name=highfrequencytrading2011 /&gt;&lt;ref group=notes&gt;In July 2009, when a high-frequency trading platform with proprietary [[algorithmic trading code]] used by [[Goldman Sachs]] to allegedly generate massive profits in the commodity market was stolen by [[Sergey Aleynikov]] there was widespread concern about the unintended economic consequences of HFT.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Complexity and interconnectedness of global market===
The robust growth of [[Emerging markets|emerging market economies]] (EMEs, such as Brazil, Russia, India, and China), beginning in the 1990s, "propelled commodity markets into a supercycle". The size and diversity of commodity markets expanded internationally,&lt;ref name=BankofCanada25sept2012&gt;

and [[pension fund]]s and [[sovereign wealth fund]]s started allocating more capital to commodities, in order to [[Diversification (finance)|diversify]] into an asset class with less exposure to currency depreciation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first1=M.

In 2012, as emerging-market economies slowed down, commodity prices peaked and started to decline. From 2005 through 2013, energy and metals' [[Real prices and ideal prices|real prices]] remained well above their long-term averages. In 2012, real food prices were their highest since 1982.&lt;ref name=BankofCanada25sept2012 /&gt;

The price of gold bullion fell dramatically on 12 April 2013 and analysts frantically sought explanations. Rumors spread that the [[European Central Bank]] (ECB) would force [[Cyprus]] to sell its gold reserves in response to its [[2012–2013 Cypriot financial crisis|financial crisis]]. Major banks such as [[Goldman Sachs]] began immediately to short gold bullion. Investors scrambled to liquidate their [[exchange-traded fund]]s (ETFs)&lt;ref group=notes&gt;Exchange Traded Funds revolutionized the mutual funds industry when they were introduced. Exchange Traded Commodities, sold first by pioneering investors group Barclays Global Investors (BGI) (now owned by BlackRock)  revolutionized the commodity market. By the end of December 2009 Barclays Global Investors (BGI) assets hit an all-time high of $1&amp;nbsp;trillion ($1,032 billion).&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Margin (finance)|margin call selling]] accelerated. George Gero, precious metals commodities expert at the [[Royal Bank of Canada]] (RBC) Wealth Management section reported that he had not seen selling of gold bullion as panicked as this in his forty years in commodity markets.&lt;ref name=Forbes15apr2013&gt;

The earliest commodity exchange-traded fund (ETFs), such as [[SPDR Gold Shares]] {{NYSE Arca|GLD}} and [[iShares]] Silver Trust {{NYSE Arca|SLV}}, actually owned the physical commodities. Similar to these are {{NYSE Arca|PALL}} ([[palladium]]) and {{NYSE Arca|PPLT}} ([[platinum]]). However, most Exchange Traded Commodities (ETCs) implement a [[futures trading]] strategy. At the time Russian Prime Minister [[Dmitry Medvedev]] warned that Russia could sink into recession. He argued that "We live in a dynamic, fast-developing world. It is so global and so complex that we sometimes cannot keep up with the changes". Analysts have claimed that Russia's economy is overly dependent on commodities.&lt;ref name=FinancialTimes17apr2013&gt;

===Contracts in the commodity market===
A [[Spot contract]] is an agreement where delivery and payment either takes place immediately, or with a short lag. Physical trading normally involves a visual inspection and is carried out in physical [[Market (place)|market]]s such as a [[Farmers' market|farmers market]]. [[Derivatives market]]s, on the other hand, require the existence of agreed standards so that trades can be made without visual inspection.

===Standardization===
US [[soybean]] futures, for something else, are of not being standard grade if they are "GMO or a mixture of GMO and Non-GMO No. 2 yellow soybeans of Indiana, Ohio and Michigan origin produced in the U.S.A. (Non-screened, stored in silo)". They are of "deliverable grade" if they are "GMO or a mixture of GMO and Non-GMO No. 2 yellow soybeans of Iowa, Illinois and Wisconsin origin produced in the U.S.A. (Non-screened, stored in silo)".  Note the distinction between states, and the need to clearly mention their status as GMO ([[genetically modified organism]]) which makes them unacceptable to most [[organic farming|organic]] food buyers.

Similar specifications apply for cotton, orange juice, cocoa, sugar, wheat, corn, barley, [[pork belly|pork bellies]], milk, feed, stuffs, fruits, vegetables, other grains, other beans, hay, other livestock, meats, poultry, eggs, or any other commodity which is so traded.

Standardization has also occurred technologically, as the use of the FIX Protocol by commodities exchanges has allowed trade messages to be sent, received and processed in the same format as stocks or equities. This process began in 2001 when the Chicago Mercantile Exchange launched a FIX-compliant interface that was adopted by commodity exchanges around the world.&lt;ref name="FIXGlobal2011"/&gt;

==Derivatives==
[[Derivative (finance)|Derivatives]] evolved from simple commodity future contracts into a diverse group of financial instruments that apply to every kind of asset, including mortgages, insurance and many more. Futures contracts, [[Swap (finance)|Swaps]] (1970s-), Exchange-traded Commodities (ETC) (2003-), forward contracts, etc. are examples. They can be traded through formal exchanges or through Over-the-counter (OTC). Commodity market derivatives unlike credit default derivatives for example, are secured by the physical assets or commodities.&lt;ref name=washingtonpost21apr2010 /&gt;

===Forward contracts===
A [[forward contract]] is an agreement between two parties to exchange at a fixed future date a given quantity of a commodity for a specific price defined when the contract is finalized. The fixed price is also called [[forward price]]. Such forward contracts began as a way of reducing pricing risk in food and agricultural product markets. By agreeing in advance on a price for a future delivery, farmers were able protect their output agains't a possible fall of market prices and in contrast buyers were able to protect themselves against's a possible rise of market prices. 

Forward contracts for example, were used for rice in seventeenth century Japan.

===Futures contract===
[[Futures contract|Futures]] contracts are standardized forward contracts that are transacted through an exchange. In futures contracts the buyer and the seller stipulate product, grade, quantity and location and leaving price as the only variable.&lt;ref&gt;Garner, Carley. ''A Trader's First Book on Commodities''. (New Jersey: FT Press, 2010): pg 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

Agricultural futures contracts are the oldest, in use in the United States for more than 170 years.&lt;ref&gt;[[Futures Trading Act of 1921]], Declared unconstitutional in [[Hill v. Wallace]] 259 U.S. 44 (1922), the [[Grain Futures Act]] of 1922 and ''[[Board of Trade of City of Chicago v. Olsen]]'' 262 U.S. 1 (1923).&lt;/ref&gt; Modern futures agreements, began in Chicago in the 1840s, with the appearance of the railroads. Chicago, centrally located, emerged as the hub between Midwestern farmers and east coast consumer population centers.

===Swaps===
A [[Swap (finance)|swap]] is a derivative in which counterparties exchange the cash flows of one party's financial instrument for those of the other party's financial instrument. They were introduced in the 1970s.&lt;ref name=GlobalFinance2003&gt;

===Exchange-traded commodities (ETCs)===
{{main|Exchange-traded product}}
Exchange-traded commodity is a term used for commodity [[exchange-traded fund]]s (which are funds) or commodity [[exchange-traded note]]s (which are notes). These track the performance of an underlying commodity index including total return indices based on a single commodity. They are similar to ETFs and traded and settled exactly like stock funds. ETCs have [[market maker]] support with guaranteed liquidity, enabling investors to easily invest in commodities.

They were introduced in 2003.

At first only professional institutional investors had access, but online exchanges opened some ETC markets to almost anyone. ETCs were introduced partly in response to the tight supply of commodities in 2000, combined with record low inventories and increasing demand from emerging markets such as China and India.&lt;ref name=ETC&gt;{{cite journal

Prior to the introduction of ETCs, by the 1990s ETFs pioneered by [[Barclays Global Investors]] (BGI) revolutionized the mutual funds industry.&lt;ref name=ETC /&gt; By the end of December 2009 BGI assets hit an all-time high of $1 trillion.&lt;ref&gt;

Gold was the first commodity to be securitised through an [[Exchange-traded fund|Exchange Traded Fund]] (ETF) in the early 1990s, but it was not available for trade until 2003.&lt;ref name=ETC /&gt; The idea of a Gold ETF was first officially conceptualised by [[Benchmark Asset Management Company Private Ltd]] in India, when they filed a proposal with the [[Securities and Exchange Board of India]] in May 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etfglobalinvestor.net/gold-etf.php |title=Benchmark Asset Management Company conceptualises Gold ETF |publisher=Etfglobalinvestor.net |accessdate=3 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first gold exchange-traded fund was [[Gold Bullion Securities]] launched on the ASX in 2003, and the first [[silver exchange-traded fund]] was iShares Silver Trust launched on the NYSE in 2006. As of November 2010 a commodity ETF, namely [[SPDR Gold Shares]], was the second-largest ETF by market capitalization.&lt;ref name="etfdb1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://etfdb.com/compare/market-cap/|title=Largest ETFs: Top 25 ETFs By Market Cap|publisher=ETFdb|accessdate=3 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, commodity ETFs are index funds tracking non-security [[index (economics)|indices]]. Because they do not invest in securities, commodity ETFs are not regulated as investment companies under the [[Investment Company Act of 1940]] in the United States, although their public offering is subject to SEC review and they need an SEC [[no-action letter]] under the [[Securities Exchange Act of 1934]]. They may, however, be subject to regulation by the [[Commodity Futures Trading Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael Sackheim, Michael Schmidtberger &amp; James Munsell, DB Commodity Index Tracking Fund: An Innovative Exchange-Traded Fund, ''Futures Industry'' (May/June 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Koyfman |first=Yevgeniy |url=http://www.indexuniverse.com/sections/newsinfocus/6362-nogaz.html |title=No Gas: Barclays Halts Issuance of Natural Gas ETN |publisher=Index universe.com |date=21 August 2009 |access-date=3 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest commodity ETFs, such as [[SPDR Gold Shares]] {{NYSE Arca|GLD}} and [[iShares]] Silver Trust {{NYSE Arca|SLV}}, actually owned the physical commodity (e.g., gold and silver bars). Similar to these are {{NYSE Arca|PALL}} (palladium) and {{NYSE Arca|PPLT}} (platinum). However, most ETCs implement a [[futures trading]] strategy, which may produce quite different results from owning the commodity.

Commodity ETFs trade provide exposure to an increasing range of commodities and commodity indices, including energy, metals, [[Soft commodity|softs]] and agriculture. Many commodity funds, such as oil roll so-called front-month futures contracts from month to month. This provides exposure to the commodity, but subjects the investor to risks involved in different prices along the ''term structure'', such as a high cost to roll.&lt;ref name=GoldMutualVSETF /&gt;&lt;ref name=commodityETF /&gt;

ETCs in China and India gained in importance due to those countries' emergence as commodities consumers and producers. China accounted for more than 60% of exchange-traded commodities in 2009, up from 40% the previous year. The global volume of ETCs increased by a 20% in 2010, and 50% since 2008, to around 2.5 billion million contracts.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

=== Over-the-counter (OTC) commodities derivatives ===
[[Over-the-counter (finance)|Over-the-counter]] (OTC) commodities derivatives trading originally involved two parties, without an [[exchange (organized market)|exchange]].  Exchange trading offers greater transparency and regulatory protections. In an OTC trade, the price is not generally made public. OTC commodities derivatives are higher risk but may also lead to higher profits.&lt;ref&gt;Jon Gregory. Counterparty credit risk. {{ISBN|978-0-470-68576-1}}. p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 2007 and 2010, global physical exports of commodities fell by 2%, while the outstanding value of OTC commodities derivatives declined by two-thirds as investors reduced risk following a five-fold increase in the previous three years.

Money under management more than doubled between 2008 and 2010 to nearly $380 billion. Inflows into the sector totaled over $60 billion in 2010, the second highest year on record, down from $72 billion the previous year. The bulk of funds went into precious metals and energy products. The growth in prices of many commodities in 2010 contributed to the increase in the value of commodities funds under management.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thecityuk.com/assets/Uploads/Commodities-Trading-2011.pdf Commodities Trading report] ([http://web.archive.org/web/20151107060517/http://www.thecityuk.com/assets/Uploads/Commodities-Trading-2011.pdf archive])&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Contract for Difference (CFD) ===
A commodity [[Contract for difference|contract for difference (CFD)]] is a derivative instrument that mirrors the price movements of the commodity underlying the contract.

Commodity CFDs are transacted worldwide (apart from the US) through regulated brokers. CFD investors can speculate on the price of a commodity moving higher (going long the CFD) or lower (going short the CFD). CFD investors do not actually own the commodity. Instead, they enter into a contract with a broker to capture the difference between the price of the commodity at the time that they transact the CFD and the price at the time they choose to exit. CFDs typically require the investor to put up margin of about 3-5% of the price of the underlying commodity contract.

For example;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://commodity.com/energy/oil/#cfd|title=Oil Commodities: Trading Oil as a Commodity|work=Commodity.com|access-date=28 November 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Imagine you’re bullish on [[oil]]. You decide to acquire CFDs to capitalize on this. You can acquire a long contract for $60.50.

To buy 20 long CFDs on 3% margin, you would need $3,630 in your account ($60.50 [long price] x 20 [number of contracts] x 100 [number of barrels in a standard contract] x 0.03 [margin percent]). You would then “control” $121,000 worth of oil for your $3,630.

That afternoon, you notice the price is up to $62.50 to $62.75, so you exit the trade, which now has a value of $125,500. Your profit would be approximately $4,500 on the deal. Of course, had the market moved against you, the leverage can have the opposite impact and losses can be significant.

CFDs are complex products for experienced traders.

==Commodities exchange==
{{main|Commodities exchange}}
A commodities exchange is an [[Exchange (organized market)|exchange]] where various commodities and derivatives are traded. Most commodity markets across the world trade in agricultural products and other raw materials (like wheat, barley, sugar, maize, cotton, [[Cocoa bean|coco]]a, coffee, milk products, pork bellies, oil, metals, etc.) and contracts based on them. These contracts can include spot prices, forwards, futures and options on futures. Other sophisticated products may include interest rates, environmental instruments, swaps, or freight contracts.&lt;ref name=NFA2006 /&gt;

===Energy===
Energy commodities include [[crude oil]] particularly [[West Texas Intermediate]] (WTI) crude oil and [[Brent Crude|Brent crude oil]], [[natural gas]], [[heating oil]], [[ethanol]] and [[purified terephthalic acid]]. [[fuel hedging|Hedging]] is a common practice for these commodities.

====Crude oil and natural gas====
{{See also|Chronology of world oil market events (1970–2005)}}

For many years, [[West Texas Intermediate]] (WTI) crude oil, a [[Light crude oil|light, sweet crude oil]], was the world’s most-traded commodity. WTI is a grade used as a [[benchmark (crude oil)|benchmark in oil pricing]]. It is the [[underlying]] [[commodity]] of Chicago Mercantile Exchange's oil futures contracts. WTI is often referenced in news reports on oil prices, alongside [[Brent Crude]]. WTI is lighter and sweeter than Brent and considerably lighter and sweeter than Dubai or Oman.&lt;ref&gt;[[Marius Vassiliou]] (2009). Historical Dictionary of the Petroleum Industry. Lanham, MD: Scarecrow Press. {{ISBN|0-8108-5993-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

From April through October 2012, Brent futures contracts exceeded those for WTI, the longest streak since at least 1995.&lt;ref name=BrentWTI2012&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Crude oil can be light or [[Heavy crude oil|heavy]]. Oil was the first form of energy to be widely traded. Some commodity market speculation is directly related to the stability of certain states, e.g., [[Iraq]], [[Bahrain]], [[Iran]], [[Venezuela]] and many others. Most commodities markets are not so tied to the politics of volatile regions.

Oil and gasoline are traded in units of 1,000 barrels (42,000 US gallons). WTI crude oil is traded through [[NYMEX]] under [[Ticker symbol|trading symbol]] CL and through [[Intercontinental Exchange]] (ICE) under trading symbol WTI. Brent crude oil is traded in through Intercontinental Exchange under trading symbol B. [[Gulf Coast Gasoline]] is traded through NYMEX  with the trading symbol of LR. [[Gasoline]] (reformulated gasoline blendstock for oxygen blending or RBOB) is traded through NYMEX via trading symbol RB. [[Propane]] is traded through NYMEX, a subsidiary of Intercontinental Exchange since early 2013, via trading symbol PN.

Natural gas is traded through NYMEX in units of 10,000 mmBTU with the trading symbol of NG. [[Heating oil]] is traded through NYMEX under trading symbol HO.

====Others====
[[Purified terephthalic acid]] (PTA) is traded through ZCE in units of 5 tons with the trading symbol of TA. [[Ethanol]] is traded at [[Chicago Board of Trade|CBOT]] in units of 29,000 U.S. gal under trading symbols AC (Open Auction) and ZE (Electronic).

===Metals===
====Precious metals====
[[Precious metal]]s currently traded on the commodity market include [[gold]], [[platinum]], [[palladium]] and [[silver]] which are sold by the [[troy ounce]]. One of the main exchanges for these precious metals is [[New York Mercantile Exchange|COMEX]].

According to the [[World Gold Council]], investments in gold are the primary driver of industry growth. Gold prices are highly volatile, driven by large flows of speculative money.&lt;ref name=NYT13Apr2012&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Industrial metals====
Industrial metals are sold by the [[metric ton]] through the [[London Metal Exchange]] and [[New York Mercantile Exchange]]. The London Metal Exchange trades include [[copper]], [[aluminium]], [[lead]], [[tin]], [[aluminium alloy]], [[nickel]], [[cobalt]] and [[molybdenum]]. In 2007, [[steel]] began trading on the London Metal Exchange.

Iron ore has been the latest addition to industrial metal derivatives. Deutsche Bank first began offering iron ore swaps in 2008, other banks quickly followed. Since then the size of the market has more than doubled each year between 2008 and 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.internationalresourcejournal.com/features/january13_features/the_importance_of_iron_ore_derivatives.html|title=The Importance of Iron Ore Derivatives -   The International Resource Journal|website=www.internationalresourcejournal.com|access-date=6 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Agriculture===
{{see also|Hedge (finance)#Agricultural commodity price hedging}}
Agricultural commodities include grains, food and fiber as well as livestock and meat, various regulatory bodies define agricultural products.&lt;ref&gt;''See'' the [[Futures Trading Act of 1921]], Declared unconstitutional in [[Hill v. Wallace]] 259 U.S. 44 (1922), the [[Grain Futures Act]] of 1922 and [[Board of Trade of City of Chicago v. Olsen]] 262 US 1 (1923).&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 July 2010, [[United States Congress]] passed the [[Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]] with changes to the definition of agricultural commodity. The operational definition used by Dodd-Frank includes "[a]ll other commodities that are, or once were, or are derived from, living organisms, including plant, animal and aquatic life, which are generally fungible, within their respective classes, and are used primarily for human food, shelter, animal feed, or natural fiber.” Three other categories were explained and listed.&lt;ref name=DoddFrankdefinition2010&gt;

In February 2013, [[Cornell Law School]] included lumber, soybeans, oilseeds, livestock (live cattle and hogs), dairy products. Agricultural commodities can include lumber (timber and forests), grains excluding stored grain (wheat, oats, barley, rye, grain sorghum, cotton, flax, forage, tame hay, native grass), vegetables (potatoes, tomatoes, sweet corn, dry beans, dry peas, freezing and canning peas), fruit (citrus such as oranges, apples, grapes) corn, tobacco, rice, peanuts, sugar beets, sugar cane, sunflowers, raisins, nursery crops, nuts, soybean complex, aquacultural fish farm species such as finfish, mollusk, crustacean, aquatic invertebrate, amphibian, reptile, or plant life cultivated in aquatic plant farms.&lt;ref name=cornell&gt;

In 1900, corn acreage was double that of wheat in the United States. But from the 1930s through the 1970s soybean acreage surpassed corn. Early in the 1970s grain and soybean prices, which had been relatively stable, "soared to levels that were unimaginable at the time." There were a number of factors affecting prices including the "surge in crude oil prices caused by the Arab Oil Embargo in October 1973 (US inflation reached 11% in 1975)."&lt;ref name=CRB&gt;

===Diamonds===
As of 2012, diamond was not traded as a commodity. Institutional investors were repelled by campaign against "[[blood diamonds]]", the monopoly structure of the diamond market and the lack of uniform standards for diamond pricing. In 2012 the SEC reviewed a proposal to create the "first diamond-backed exchange-traded fund" that would trade on-line in units of one-carat diamonds with a storage vault and delivery point in Antwerp, home of the [[World Federation of Diamond Bourses|Antwerp Diamond Bourse]]. The exchange fund was backed by a company based in [[New York City]] called [[IndexIQ]]. IndexIQ had already introduced 14 exchange-traded funds since 2008.&lt;ref name=NYT13Apr2012 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=notes&gt;IndexIQ registered Adam S. Patti as Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and David Fogel as Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President in the City of Rye Brook, New York, on 31 January 2013 as representatives of IndexIQ Advisors LLC sponsoring the IQ Physical Diamond Trust.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Citigroup]] analysts, the annual production of polished diamonds is about $18 billion. Like gold, diamonds are easily authenticated and durable. Diamond prices have been more stable than the metals, as the global diamond monopoly [[De Beers]] once held almost 90% (by 2013 reduced to 40%) of the new diamond market.&lt;ref name=NYT13Apr2012 /&gt;

===Other commodity markets===
Rubber trades on the [[Singapore Commodity Exchange]] in units of 1&amp;nbsp;kg priced in US cents. [[Palm oil]] is traded on the [[Malaysian Ringgit]] (RM), [[Bursa Malaysia]] in units of 1&amp;nbsp;kg priced in US cents. Wool is traded on the [[AUD]] in units of 1&amp;nbsp;kg. Polypropylene and Linear Low Density Polyethylene (LL) did trade on the London Metal Exchange in units of 1,000&amp;nbsp;kg priced in USD but was dropped in 2011.

==Regulatory bodies and policies==
===United States===
In the United States, the principal regulator of commodity and futures markets is the [[Commodity Futures Trading Commission]] (CFTC). The [[National Futures Association]] (NFA) was formed in 1976 and is the futures industry's self-regulatory organization. The NFA's first regulatory operations began in 1982 and fall under the [[Commodity Exchange Act]] of the [[Commodity Futures Trading Commission Act of 1974|Commodity Futures Trading Commission Act]].&lt;ref name=NFA&gt;
{{cite web

|title=National Futures Association
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dodd–Frank was enacted in response to the 2008 financial crisis. It called for "strong measures to limit speculation in agricultural commodities" calling upon the CFTC to further limit positions and to regulate over-the-counter trades.&lt;ref&gt;

===European Union===
[[Markets in Financial Instruments Directive]] (MiFID) is the cornerstone of the [[European Commission]]'s [[Financial Services Action Plan]] that regulate operations of the EU financial service markets. It was reviewed in 2012 by the [[European Parliament]] (EP) and the [[Economic and Financial Affairs Council]] (ECOFIN).&lt;ref name=SOMO26oct2012&gt;

The [[European Securities and Markets Authority]] (Esma), based in Paris and formed in 2011, is an "EU-wide financial markets watchdog". Esma sets position limits on commodity derivatives as described in Mifid II.&lt;ref name=MifidII /&gt;

The EP voted in favor of stronger regulation of commodity derivative markets in September 2012 to "end abusive speculation in commodity markets" that were "driving global food prices increases and price volatility". In July 2012, "food prices globally soared by 10 percent" ([[World Bank]] 2012). Senior British MEP Arlene McCarthy called for "putting a brake on excessive [[Food security#Treating food the same as other internationally traded commodities|food speculation]] and speculating giants profiting from hunger" ending immoral practices that "only serve the interests of profiteers".&lt;ref name=EU&gt;

'''David Aden Salmon''' (1879&amp;ndash;??) was a career [[functionary|government functionary]] in the [[U.S. Department of War]] and the [[U.S. Department of State]]. In 1931, Salmon rose to head the State Department's Bureau of Indexes and Archives, a department with over 150 employees at the time. In 2008 Cold War historian [[John Earl Haynes]] identified Salmon as "Willy", a codename for a Soviet agent, followed by a 2009 book which argued that Salmon was, from 1934 until early 1937, a paid source of [[classified information|classified]] [[diplomat]]ic and [[military]] information which ended in the hands of [[Soviet intelligence]]. This identification has been challenged by at least one historian specializing in espionage history.

==Life and career==

===Early years===
David A. Salmon was born in 1879 in [[Connecticut]].

===Government career===
Salmon joined the [[U.S. Department of War]] in 1896 as a junior [[clerk (position)|clerk]].&lt;ref name="Spies197"&gt;John Earl Haynes, Harvey Klehr, and Alexander Vassiliev, ''Spies: The Rise and Fall of the KGB in America.'' New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 2009; pg. 197.&lt;/ref&gt; His efficient work attracted the attention of [[Elihu Root]], under whom Salmon worked at the War Department from 1899.&lt;ref name="Sveta"&gt;Svetlana Chervonnaya, [http://www.documentstalk.com/wp/salmon-david-aden-1879 "David Aden Salmon (1879-?),"] DocumentsTalk.com. Retrieved August 11, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1905 Root brought Salmon with him to the [[U.S. Department of State|State Department]] he assumed the role of [[Secretary of State]].&lt;ref name="Spies197" /&gt; Salmon became known as an expert in [[cryptography]] and had supervisory control over the State Department's code room.&lt;ref name="Sveta" /&gt; He was in charge of coded communications from the various major international conferences of the era, often traveling with the American delegations.&lt;ref name="Sveta" /&gt;

In 1916, Salmon was named head of the State Department's Bureau of Indexes and Archives.&lt;ref name="Spies197" /&gt; This bureau was restructured in 1931, becoming the State Department's Division of Communications and Records, of which Salmon was again named as chief.&lt;ref name="Sveta" /&gt; Salmon supervised over 150 employees in his department's expanded incarnation, making it the largest State Department sub-agency of the day.&lt;ref name="Sveta" /&gt;

As an expert in State Department communications, Salmon was called before a [[grand jury]] on December 8, 1948, to authenticate documents produced by [[Whittaker Chambers]] to support his espionage accusations against State Department employee [[Alger Hiss]].&lt;ref name="Sveta" /&gt;

Salmon retired from government service sometime after [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="Sveta" /&gt;

===Espionage allegations===
In May 2009, American [[historian]]s [[John Earl Haynes]] and [[Harvey Klehr]] and Russian journalist [[Alexander Vassiliev]] published a book entitled ''Spies: The Rise and Fall of the KGB in America.'' In this thick tome, the three identified David A. Salmon as a key State Department source of classified documents code-named "Willy" by his Soviet handlers.&lt;ref name="Spies197" /&gt;

The identification of Salmon as "Willy" was challenged by Russian historian [[Svetlana Chervonnaya]], who asserted that the American historians had been "tricked by the odd collection of records to which their Russian source, Vassiliev, had access."&lt;ref name="background"&gt;Svetlana Chervonnaya, [http://www.documentstalk.com/wp/ludwig-lore-a-background-file "Ludwig Lore: A Background File,"] DocumentsTalk.com. Retrieved August 11, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Chervonnaya asserted that the Soviet's agent-group leader [[Ludwig Lore]] had falsely claimed Salmon as his source to his Soviet handlers so as to throw them off the trail of his actual source and particularly of the fact that he was himself rewriting information from "lower level clerks at the Communications and Records Division."&lt;ref name="background" /&gt; After enhancing the information which he received with his own interpretive content, Lore then pocketed the handsome monthly stipend which was purportedly destined for the top-ranking official Salmon, Chervonnaya explains.&lt;ref name="background" /&gt;

Chervonnaya indicates that in February 1937 Lore's deception was discovered by Soviet intelligence when they rented an apartment across the street from Lore and began round-the-clock surveillance.&lt;ref name="PaperMill"&gt;J.N. Kobiakov, “Bumazhnaia fabrika,” (The Paper Mill) in ''Ocherki istorii rossiiskoi vneshnei razvedki: Tom 3, 1933-1941 gody.''  (Essays on the History of Russian Foreign Intelligence: Vol. 3, 1933-1941). Moscow: Mezhdunarodnye otnosheniia, 2003; pp. 191-199. Svetlana Chervonnaya, translator. Available online at http://www.documentstalk.com/wp/ludwig-lore-a-background-file&lt;/ref&gt;

As the basis for her conclusions, Chervonnaya cites the published work of J.N. Kobiakov, former high official (Major General) of the KGB foreign intelligence, which was based on Ludwig Lore case file:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Throughout the whole period of surveillance, he left his home only once, for four hours. For three nights running, [Lore's] study was bustling with work, with the participation of all the family members; in particular, [Lore's] wife and son were taking turns at the typewriter typing something. When providing us with the materials, [Lore] repeated his usual lies about a trip to Washington and meetings with sources. *  *  * &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
"With the results of physical surveillance, the Centre arrived at a preliminary conclusion, that [Lore] was an exceptionally talented compiler. The use of information from open sources, fishing in them for any new data, as well as their analysis and evaluation, often produce outstanding results; many intelligence services do not neglect this method of information-gathering. But such work is considered auxiliary to the main task — obtaining information from agent sources...  *  *  * &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
"The situation was aggravated in late spring 1937, when the Soviet 'illegals' managed to ascertain that the 'Willie' and 'Daniel' whom Lore had presented to his Soviet handlers, were 'dummies.'"&lt;ref name="PaperMill" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Chervonnaya's conclusions, which were initially presented on her behalf by Jeff Kisseloff on May 20, 2009, at a conference hosted by the [[Wilson Center]], have been rejected by a number of academics.  Mark Kramer, director of the Harvard Cold War Studies program, stated in response that he did not "trust a word [Kobiakov] says."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wilsoncenter.org/ondemand/index.cfm?fuseaction=home.play&amp;mediaid=1CF9FE54-ABA6-DE06-59C4D3B1753CDA24 The Vassiliev Notebooks and Soviet Intelligence Operations in the U.S]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} video transcript of day 1, at 2:24:42 ''Wilson Center On Demand,'' May 20, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  In an article published a few days earlier [[David Garrow]], a historian of the [[civil rights movement]], accepted as fact that Salmon "handed over reams of classified information simply for the money."&lt;ref&gt;David J. Garrow [http://www.newsweek.com/2009/05/15/from-russia-with-love.html "From Russia, With Love,"] ''[[Newsweek]],'' May 16, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Chervonnaya, on the other hand, conclusive proof of David Salmon's misidentification as the source known variously as  "Willie" and "11th" appears in the published archival notes made by former [[KGB]] officer and historian [[Alexander Vassiliev]]. Vassilliev read the case file of [[Laurence Duggan]], a Soviet source at the State Department with a cover name "19th", which included a May 14, 1937, letter of Soviet intelligence's Moscow Center to its New York station chief [[Boris Bazarov]] in which the Center asked if Duggan could provide more materials "regarding the US data on the Soviet military-naval supply orders." These notes are followed by Vassiliev's notation in brackets, that apparently was his brief summary of Bazarov's response to the Center's request: "The actual '11' didn’t give '19' the folder, because these materials should not be of interest to 19.”&lt;ref&gt;Center to Nord, 14.5.37, Archival # 36857 v. 1 “Prince” Laurence Duggan file. Alexander Vassiliev, [http://www.wilsoncenter.org/topics/docs/Yellow_Notebook_No.2_Translated1.pdf Yellow Notebook #2] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100711055918/http://www.wilsoncenter.org/topics/docs/Yellow_Notebook_No.2_Translated1.pdf |date=2010-07-11 }}, pg. 13. Translated by Philip Redko, reviewed and edited by Alexander Vassiliev and John Earl Haynes, 2007. Published online by Woodrow Wilson Center’s Cold War International History Project.&lt;/ref&gt;

It follows from Vassiliev's notation that by mid-May 1937 the Soviets have already ascertained the identity of Lore's actual source at the State's Division of Communications and Records.

===Death and legacy===
The date of death of David A. Salmon is not known as of this writing.

Following the publication of Haynes, Klehr, and Vassiliev's book in May 2009, some in the [[mainstream media]] made Salmon's name a watchword for those who "handed over reams of classified information simply for the money."&lt;ref&gt;David J. Garrow, [http://www.newsweek.com/2009/05/15/from-russia-with-love.html "From Russia, With Love,"] ''Newsweek,'' May 16, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; It is in this capacity, regardless of whether the accusation is with or without merit, that Salmon's name is currently remembered.

===Age and population estimates: 1950 to 2015===
According to the 2010 revision of the [[United Nations Secretariat]]'s ''World Population Prospects'', South Africa's total population was 50,133,000 in 2010, compared to only 13,683,000 in 1950. In 2010, 30.1% of the people were children under the age of 15, 65.2% were between 15 and 64 years of age, and 4.6% were 65 or older.&lt;ref name="WPP 2010"&gt;[http://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/index.htm Population Division of the Department of Economic and Social Affairs of the United Nations Secretariat, World Population Prospects: The 2010 Revision] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110506000000/http://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/index.htm |date=6 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''All population estimates are rounded to the nearest thousand.''

Registration of vital events in South Africa has improved considerably during the past decade, but still not considered to be complete for [[black South Africans]]. The Population Department of the United Nations prepared the following estimates.&lt;ref name="WPP 2010"/&gt; (Natural increase or decrease over a time period is the difference between that period's live births and deaths, before accounting for inward or outward migration.)

[[Statistics South Africa]] asks people to describe themselves in the census in terms of five [[Race (classification of human beings)|racial]] population groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lehohla|first=Pali|title=Debate over race and censuses not peculiar to SA|url=http://www.statssa.gov.za/news_archive/05may2005_1.asp|date=5 May 2005|newspaper=Business Report|accessdate=25 August 2013|quote=Others pointed out that the repeal of the Population Registration Act in 1991 removed any legal basis for specifying 'race'. The Identification Act of 1997 makes no mention of race. On the other hand, the Employment Equity Act speaks of 'designated groups' being 'black people, women and people with disabilities'. The Act defines 'black' as referring to 'Africans, coloureds and Indians'. Apartheid and the racial identification which underpinned it explicitly linked race with differential access to resources and power. If the post-apartheid order was committed to remedying this, race would have to be included in surveys and censuses, so that progress in eradicating the consequences of apartheid could be measured and monitored. This was the reasoning that led to a 'self-identifying' question about 'race' or 'population group' in both the 1996 and 2001 population censuses, and in Statistics SA's household survey programme.|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070814143522/http://www.statssa.gov.za/news_archive/05may2005_1.asp|archivedate=14 August 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[South African National Census of 2011|2011 census]] figures for these groups were [[Black South Africans|Black African]] at 80.2%, [[White South African|White]] at 8.4%, [[Coloured]] at 8.8%, [[Indian South Africans|Indian]] /[[Asian South Africans|Asian]] at 2.5%, and Other/Unspecified at 0.5%.&lt;ref name="CIATONGA"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/sf.html|title= Africa :: SOUTH AFRICA|publisher= CIA The World Factbook}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The white percentage of the population has sharply declined. The first census in South Africa in 1911 showed that whites made up 22% of the population. This declined to 16% in 1980,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | author=Study Commission on U.S. Policy toward Southern Africa (U.S.) | title = South Africa: time running out : the report of the Study Commission on U.S. Policy Toward Southern Africa  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=sq43lnbklEUC&amp;pg=PA42&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false | publisher=University of California Press | year = 1981 | page = 42 | isbn = 0-520-04547-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 8.9% in 2011.&lt;ref name=Census2011&gt;{{cite book |title=Census 2011: Census in brief |url=http://www.statssa.gov.za/census/census_2011/census_products/Census_2011_Census_in_brief.pdf|publisher=Statistics South Africa |location=Pretoria |year=2012 |isbn=9780621413885}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|21}}

==Languages==
{{Main article|Languages of South Africa}}
South Africa has eleven [[official language]]s:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fs.gov.za/Departments/SAC/Library/DEPART/lang_legislation1.htm |title=Constitution of South Africa, Chapter 1, Section 6 |publisher=Fs.gov.za |accessdate=30 May 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090729134936/http://www.fs.gov.za/Departments/SAC/Library/DEPART/lang_legislation1.htm |archivedate=29 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[IsiZulu]]&lt;ref name="CIATONGA"/&gt; 22.7%, [[IsiXhosa]]&lt;ref name="CIATONGA"/&gt;  16%, [[Afrikaans]]&lt;ref name="CIATONGA"/&gt;   13.5%, the [[English language]] &lt;ref name="CIATONGA"/&gt;  9.6%, [[Sepedi language|Sepedi]] &lt;ref name="CIATONGA"/&gt;  9.1%, [[Setswana]]&lt;ref name="CIATONGA"/&gt;  8%, [[Sesotho]]&lt;ref name="CIATONGA"/&gt; 7.6%, [[Xitsonga]]&lt;ref name="CIATONGA"/&gt;  4.5%, [[siSwati]]&lt;ref name="CIATONGA"/&gt; 2.5%, [[Tshivenda]]&lt;ref name="CIATONGA"/&gt; 2.4% and  [[isiNdebele]]&lt;ref name="CIATONGA"/&gt; 2.1%.

In this regard it is third only to [[Bolivia]] and [[Official languages of India|India]] in number. While all the languages are formally equal, some languages are spoken more than others. According to the [[South African National Census of 2011|2011 census]], the three most spoken first languages are Zulu (22.7%), Xhosa (16.0%), and Afrikaans (13.5%).&lt;ref name=Census2011/&gt;{{rp|23–25}} Despite the fact that English is recognised as the language of commerce and science, it ranked fourth, and was spoken by only 9.6% of South Africans as a first language in 2011.&lt;ref name=Census2011/&gt;{{rp|23–25}}

The country also recognises several unofficial languages, including [[Fanagalo language|Fanagalo]], [[Khoe language|Khoe]], [[Lobedu language|Lobedu]], [[Nama language|Nama]], [[Northern Ndebele language|Northern Ndebele]], [[Phuthi language|Phuthi]], [[San language|San]] and [[South African Sign Language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mediaclub.co.za/landstatic/80-languages|title=The languages of South Africa|last=|first=|date=December 2011|website=Media Club South Africa|publisher=Brand South Africa|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=24 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; These unofficial languages may be used in certain official uses in limited areas where it has been determined that these languages are prevalent. Nevertheless, their populations are not such that they require nationwide recognition.

Many of the "unofficial languages" of the San and Khoikhoi people contain regional dialects stretching northwards into Namibia and Botswana, and elsewhere. These people, who are a physically distinct population from other Africans, have their own cultural identity based on their hunter-gatherer societies. They have been marginalised to a great extent, and many of their languages are in danger of becoming [[Extinct language|extinct]].

Many white South Africans also speak other European languages, such as Portuguese (also spoken by black [[Angola]]ns and [[Mozambique|Mozambicans]]), German, and Greek, while some Indians and other Asians in South Africa speak South Asian languages, such as Tamil, Hindi, Gujarati, [[Urdu language|Urdu]] and Telugu. Although many South Africans are of Huguenot (French) origin, South African French is spoken by fewer than 10,000 individuals country-wide. Congolese French is also spoken in South Africa by migrants.

The primary sign language of Deaf South Africans is [[South African Sign Language]]. Other sign languages among indigenous peoples are also used.

===By ethnicity===
In 2011, the first language was [[Zulu language|Zulu]] for 28.1% of Black residents, [[Xhosa language|Xhosa]] for 19.8%, [[Northern Sotho language|Northern Sotho]] for 11.2%, [[Tswana language|Tswana]] for 9.7%, [[Sesotho language|Sesotho]] for 9.3%, [[Tsonga language|Tsonga]] for  5.5%, [[Swati language|Swati]] for 3.1%, [[Venda language|Venda]] for 2.9%, English for  2.8%, [[Southern Ndebele language|Southern Ndebele]] for  2.6%, [[Afrikaans]] for 1.5%, while 3.4% had another first language.&lt;ref name=superweb&gt;{{cite web|title=Community profiles &gt; Census 2011 |url=http://interactive.statssa.gov.za/superweb |publisher=Statistics South Africa Superweb |accessdate=21 August 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130930103145/http://interactive.statssa.gov.za/superweb/ |archivedate=30 September 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among whites, Afrikaans was the first language for 59.1% of the population, compared to 35.0% for English. Other languages accounted for the remaining 5.9%.&lt;ref name=superweb/&gt;

==Religion==
{{Main article|Religion in South Africa}}
According to the 2001 national census, [[Christians]] accounted for 79.7% of the population. This includes [[Protestant]] (36.6%), [[Zionist Christian]] (11.1%), [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]]/[[Charismatic movement|Charismatic]] (8.2%), [[Roman Catholicism in South Africa|Roman Catholic]] (7.1%), [[Methodist Church of Southern Africa|Methodist]] (6.8%), [[Nederduits Gereformeerde Kerk|Dutch Reformed]] (6.7%), [[Anglican Church of Southern Africa|Anglican]] (3.8%); members of other Christian churches accounted for another 36% of the population. [[Islam in South Africa|Muslims]] accounted for 1.5% of the population, Other 2.3%, and 1.4% were Unspecified and None 15.1%.&lt;ref name="CIATONGA"/&gt;

[[African Indigenous Churches]] made up the largest of the Christian groups. Some believe that many people claiming no affiliation with any organised religion adhered to [[African traditional religion|traditional indigenous religions]]. Many people have [[Syncretism|syncretic]] religious practices combining Christian and indigenous influences.&lt;ref name="DoS"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2006/71325.htm|title=South Africa|website=State.gov|accessdate=29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Islam in South Africa|Muslims]] are largely found among the [[Coloured]] and [[Indian South African|Indian]] ethnic groups. They have been joined by black or white South African converts as well as immigrants from other parts of Africa.&lt;ref name=csmonitor/&gt; South African Muslims claim that their faith is the fastest-growing religion of conversion in the country, with the number of black Muslims growing sixfold, from 12 000 in 1991 to 74 700 in 2004&lt;ref name=csmonitor&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2002/0110/p13s1-woaf.html|title=In South Africa, many blacks convert to Islam|website=Csmonitor.com|accessdate=29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.religionnewsblog.com/9398/muslims-say-their-faith-growing-fast-in-africa |title=Muslims say their faith growing fast in Africa |publisher=Religionnewsblog.com |accessdate=7 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hindu population has its roots in the British colonial period, but later waves of immigration from India have also contributed to it. Most Hindus are of South Asian origin, but there are many who come from mixed racial stock. Some are converts due to the efforts of Hindu missionaries such as [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|ISKCON]].

Other minority religions in South Africa are [[Sikhism]], [[Jainism]] and [[Bahá'í Faith in South Africa|Bahá'í Faith]].&lt;ref name="state.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2005/51496.htm|title=South Africa – Section I. Religious Demography|publisher=U.S. Department of State|accessdate=15 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===By ethnicity===
87.9% of Black residents are Christian, 9.5% have [[Irreligion|no religion]], 0.2% are Muslim, 0.0% are Jewish, 0.0% are [[Hinduism|Hindu]] and 2.3% have other or undetermined beliefs.

71.8% of White residents are Christian, 23.8% have [[Irreligion|no religion]], 0.2% are Muslim, 1.4% are Jewish, and 0.0% are [[Hinduism|Hindu]]. 2.7% have other or undetermined beliefs.

South Africa hosts a sizeable refugee and asylum seeker population. According to the ''World Refugee Survey 2008'', published by the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants, this population numbered approximately 144,700 in 2007.&lt;ref name="World Refugee Survey 2008"/&gt; Groups of refugees and asylum seekers numbering over 10,000 included people from [[Zimbabwe]] (48,400), the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] (24,800), and [[Somalia]] (12,900).&lt;ref name="World Refugee Survey 2008"/&gt; These populations mainly lived in Johannesburg, Pretoria, Durban, Cape Town, and Port Elizabeth.&lt;ref name="World Refugee Survey 2008"&gt;{{cite news|title=World Refugee Survey 2008|publisher=U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants|date=19 June 2008|url=http://www.refugees.org/survey|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071005040657/http://www.refugees.org/article.aspx?id=1941|archivedate=5 October 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many refugees have now also started to work and live in rural areas in provinces such as [[Mpumalanga]] and [[KwaZulu-Natal]].

The '''digital divide in Canada''' refers to the discrepancy that exists between Canadians who have access to [[information and communications technology|information and communication technologies]] (ICT) and the benefits they provide compared to those who don't.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sciadas|first1=George|title=The Digital Divide in Canada|url=http://publications.gc.ca/Collection/Statcan/56F0009X/56F0009XIE2002001.pdf|publisher=Statistics Canada|accessdate=24 November 2016|date=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; This divide can be the result of many factors including high costs for technology and online access,&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite report|last1=Rajabiun|first1=Reza|last2=Ellis|first2=David|last3=Middleton|first3=Catherine|title=Literature Review: Affordability of Communications Services|url=http://www.ryerson.ca/~cmiddlet/ourresearch/lit-review-for-crtc-2016-affordability-rajabiun-ellis-middleton.pdf|accessdate=14 November 2016|date=March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; differences in the availability of online connectivity resources in different locations across the country,&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{cite web|author=CRTC|url=http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/publications/reports/policymonitoring/2015/cmr2.htm|title=Communications Monitoring Report 2015: Canada's Communications System: An Overview for Citizens, Consumers, and Creators|last=|first=|date=2015|website=Government of Canada CRTC|publisher=|access-date=17 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and lacking [[digital literacy]]. The digital divide in [[Canada]] also stems from [[income inequality]] among Canadians and differences in online connectivity practices exhibited by those of different age, gender, first language, and cultural background.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite report|last1=Haight|first1=Michael|last2=Quan-Haase|first2=Anabel|last3=Corbett|first3=Bradley A|title=Revisiting the digital divide in Canada: the impact of demographic factors on access to the internet, level of online activity, and social networking site usage|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/263307792_Revisiting_the_digital_divide_in_Canada_The_impact_of_demographic_factors_on_access_to_the_internet_level_of_online_activity_and_social_networking_site_usage|publisher=Information, Communication &amp; Society|accessdate=19 November 2016|date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The territories situated within [[Northern Canada]] in particular have been technologically divided compared to the rest of the country due to economic and geographical obstacles creating challenges regarding having high speed internet connections set up between distant and sparsely populated towns, along with the low digital literacy rates and lack of access to technology that some northern residents possess.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite report|title=Northern connections: Broadband and Canada's digital divide: final report|date=June 2014|last=Canada's Public Policy Forum|url=https://www.ppforum.ca/sites/default/files/BroadBand_Final_PPF_en.pdf|location=Ottawa, Ontario|access-date=17 October 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160806105740/http://www.ppforum.ca/sites/default/files/BroadBand_Final_PPF_en.pdf|archivedate=2016-08-06|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various government initiatives are currently being implemented to reduce the digital divide in Canada, including plans aimed at providing all Canadians with affordable high speed internet packages,&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/028.nsf/eng/50010.html#eligible|title=About Connecting Canadians|last=Government of Canada|first=|date=2016|website=Digital Canada 150|publisher=|access-date=October 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; increasing the amount of free public [[Wi-Fi]] available,&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{cite news|last1=CBC News|title=Toronto public libraries, Google to offer free take-home WiFi|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/toronto-library-wifi-1.3634855|accessdate=20 November 2016|date=14 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the improvement of digital literacy among students in public elementary and high schools.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|last=Government of Canada|url=https://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/028.nsf/eng/00537.html|title=Digital Literacy in Canada: From Inclusion to Transformation|date=2010|website=Digital Canada 150|access-date=18 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no consensus on the appropriateness of government intervention in addressing the perceived digital divide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://business.financialpost.com/fp-comment/nearly-every-canadian-will-soon-have-high-speed-internet-so-why-is-the-crtc-meddling Masse, Martin and Paul Beaudry "Nearly every Canadian will soon have high-speed Internet, so why is the CRTC meddling?"

== Connectivity gap ==
[[File:Fixed broadband subscriptions in Canada.png|thumb|280x280px|A graph displaying the number of fixed broadband subscriptions in Canada by year.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.itu.int/en/ITU-D/Statistics/Pages/stat/default.aspx|title=Fixed-broadband subscriptions|last=International Telecommunication Union|first=|date=2015|website=|publisher=|access-date=19 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
While 99% of Canadians have access to wireline telephone service, many gaps still exist between the level of ICT access and internet connectivity that different groups within Canada possess.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{cite web|author=CRTC|url=http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/2015/2015-134.htm|title=Telecom Notice of Consultation CRTC 2015-134: Review of basic telecommunications services|last=|first=|date=9 April 2015|website=Government of Canada CRTC|publisher=|access-date=17 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2015 there are over 13 million fixed broadband subscriptions in Canada, which translates into approximately thirty six subscriptions per one hundred Canadian citizens.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In the past the regulation of telephone and television monopolies in Canada by the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]] (CRTC) led to the creation of expansive [[Telecommunication|telecommunications]] networks and made connecting to them by customers affordable. Broadband's current lack of regulation at the retail level has led to a different market environment emerging for high speed internet access where [[Internet service provider|internet service providers]] (ISP) have great control over what prices they charge and what infrastructure they build.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Income and price ===
[[Statistics Canada]] states that income disparity plays a role in determining whether or not Canadians are connected online. Findings show that 97.7% of households that reside within the highest income [[quartile]] have high speed internet access, while only 58% of households that reside within the lowest income quartile possess access to the internet at home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www5.statcan.gc.ca/cansim/a26?lang=eng&amp;id=3580167|title=Canadian Internet use survey, household access to the Internet at home, by household income quartile, Canada and provinces|last=Government of Canada|first=|website=Statistics Canada|publisher=|date=26 November 2013|access-date=19 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A report conducted by Acorn Canada of low and moderate income Canadian families found that 83.5% of respondents believe the monthly cost of high speed internet service in Canada is very expensive.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite report|title=Internet for All: Internet Use and Accessibility for Low-Income Canadians|url=http://www.acorncanada.org/resource/internet-all|date=January 2015|last=Acorn Canada|access-date=17 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Canadian Internet Registration Authority]] reports that in 2015 Canadians paid an average of $38.91 per month for high speed internet service, or an average of $203.04 monthly for all communication services combined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cira.ca/factbook/2014/the-canadian-internet.html|title=The Canadian Internet|last=Canadian Internet Registration Authority|first=|date=2014|publisher=|access-date=17 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Acorn Canada is currently calling on the CRTC to mandate ISPs to provide a $10 per month high speed internet package in an effort to ensure that at least some form of online access is affordable for all Canadians.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

A lack of competition plays a large role in the prices that ISPs charge Canadians for online access. Unlike other countries which allow foreign competition to enter their national markets and keep prices competitive, regulation has forbidden the same from happening within Canada, resulting in fewer online connectivity choices for Canadians and the ability for [[Incumbent local exchange carrier|incumbent]] ISPs to have a large amount of control over the prices they charge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Middleton|first1=Catherine|title=Canada's Telecommunications Policy Environment|url=http://www.ryerson.ca/~cmiddlet/ourresearch/Middleton_TJA_2011.pdf|publisher=Telecommunications Journal of Australia|accessdate=21 November 2016|date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; To compensate for this, the CRTC has allowed for new entrant carriers to enter the broadband market in an attempt to keep prices competitive and increase consumer options regarding where internet access can be purchased from. New entrant carriers such as [[TekSavvy]] have been mandated access to incumbent carrier networks, such as those belonging to [[Rogers Communications|Rogers]] and [[Bell Canada|Bell]], giving carriers which do not have the capital or resources available to build their own networks an opportunity to compete in the market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=CRTC|title=Telecom Regulatory Policy CRTC 2015-326: Review of wholesale wireline services and associated policies |url=http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/2015/2015-326.htm|publisher=Government of Canada|accessdate=23 November 2016|date=22 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Broadband packages offered by new entrant ISPs are generally less expensive than those offered by incumbent ISPs, with many new entrant plans being between 20% to 30% cheaper compared to incumbent plans with similar speeds.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{cite report|last1=Wall Communications Inc .|title=Price Comparisons of Wireline, Wireless and Internet Services in Canada and with Foreign Jurisdictions|url=http://www.wallcom.ca/pdfs/price-comp-report_2015edition_final_CRTC.pdf|accessdate=20 November 2016|date=30 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many plans offered by new entrant carriers also feature higher data caps, periods during the day when online usage does not contribute to a user's monthly data cap, or in some cases no monthly data cap at all.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

Despite efforts by the CRTC to increase competition without allowing the presence of international competitors, Canadian broadband prices have been steadily rising, with the average cost of high speed internet packages rising at three times the rate of inflation since 2010.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; As online access continues to become more essential to life in Canada, the [[Price elasticity of demand|price elasticity]] of broadband service has been decreasing, allowing for disproportionate increases in price without the need for incumbent ISPs to fear a significant loss of customers as a result.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Fixed broadband service is not the only area which has seen disproportionate increases in prices, as according to the [[International Telecommunication Union]] Canada's mobile sector had the highest [[average revenue per user]] in 2010 compared to the mobile markets of all other countries.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite report|last1=Obar|first1=Jonathan A.|last2=Taylor|first2=Gregory|last3=Antoine|first3=Derek|last4=Bivens|first4=Rena|last5=Caidi|first5=Nadia|last6=Johnson|first6=Arndis|last7=Middleton|first7=Catherine|last8=Skinner|first8=David|title=Mapping Digital Media: Canada|url=https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/sites/default/files/mapping-digital-media-canada-20140318.pdf|publisher=Open Society Foundations|accessdate=19 November 2016|date=30 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2015 mobile packages in Canada have an average price of approximately $60 per month with the possibility existing for usage and overage fees if calling, text messaging, or data limits are exceeded.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Similar to new entrant carriers in the provision of fixed broadband service, [[Mobile virtual network operator|mobile virtual network operators]] (MVNO) also exist which use incumbent infrastructure to provide mobile services in an attempt to make the market more competitive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=CRTC|title=Telecom Regulatory Policy CRTC 2015-177: Regulatory framework for wholesale mobile wireless services|url=http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/2015/2015-177.htm|publisher=Government of Canada|accessdate=23 November 2016|date=5 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Data caps ===
Many high speed internet packages offered in Canada have [[Bandwidth cap|data caps]], or online data consumption limits that when surpassed will result in additional charges being applied to a user's monthly bill. Data caps in Canada can be as low as 20GB, which is over six times lower than the lowest data cap in the [[United States]] of 150GB.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|title=Canadian Data Caps Summary Report|date=June 9, 2016|last=Open Media Foundation|url=https://openmedia.org/sites/default/files/end-data-caps-canada-report.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Data caps contribute to the digital divide by discouraging online usage in users due to the fear of incurring overage charges for any bandwidth consumed once one's data cap has been exceeded. This results in further difficulties for low income families and minority groups regarding being able to afford and make significant use of high speed internet access at home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|last1=Kehl Danielle|first1=Philip|last2=Lucey|first2=Patrick|title=Artificial Scarcity|url=https://static.newamerica.org/attachments/3556-artificial-scarcity/DataCaps_Layout_Final.a7ef6b9029da4dd29324757e5710b903.pdf|date=2015|website=New America|publisher=Open Technology Institute|access-date=17 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plans offered by new entrant ISPs frequently have higher data caps than those offered by incumbent ISPs, with some new entrant plans offering unlimited [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] during times of the day when overall network use is lower. Some plans offered by new entrant carriers also feature no data cap at all, which is something not frequently offered in retail plans provided by incumbent ISPs.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

=== Location ===
[[File:Canada map.PNG|thumb|right|280x280px|A map highlighting Canada's ten [[Provinces and territories of Canada|provinces]] and three [[Provinces and territories of Canada|territories]] in white.]]
While [[Urban area|urban]] areas within Canada have a 100% high speed internet availability rate, [[Rural area|rural]] areas have a lower level of access to high speed internet service with a rate of only 87%.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Many locations which do not have access to high speed broadband networks reside within the [[Northwest Territories]], [[Yukon]], and [[Iqaluit]] where various [[geographical feature|geographical features]] create difficulties relating to the development of broadband infrastructure.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; These development difficulties are compounded by the fact that there exists little incentive for ISPs to build broadband infrastructure in the north due to the high cost and low return of developing in areas where towns and people are greatly dispersed.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Differences can also be found in the quality of networks that Canadians who live in different areas of the country have access to. Those living in urban areas, particularly residents of newly constructed or renovated condominiums, are more likely to have access to [[fiber to the premises]] (FTTP) internet connectivity than those in older neighbourhoods, who commonly still connect to the internet through infrastructure that is based at least partially on legacy [[DSL|telephone]] or [[DOCSIS|cable]] technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Nowak|first1=Peter|title=Beanfield serving Toronto condos a fibre broadband diet|url=http://alphabeatic.com/beanfield-fibre-condos-toronto/|accessdate=21 November 2016|publisher=Alphabetic|date=2 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2015 Canada ranks 24th out of all countries in terms of FTTP penetration at a level of less than 5%. This lags behind other developed countries such as [[Japan]] and [[South Korea]] which have national FTTP penetration levels of nearly 70%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|last1=Cybera|title=The Future of Broadband Internet Access in Canada|url=https://www.cybera.ca/assets/network/CyberaCRTC-Final-Response-Jan242014.pdf|accessdate=20 November 2016|date=24 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Demographics and the second level digital divide==
{{main article|Digital divide#Second-level digital divide}}

Aside from monetary factors, demographic differences within Canada have also resulted in disparity regarding online connectivity and ICT use. Variables such as education and age can play a role in what is considered to be the second level digital divide, where even though a person may have access to high speed internet and the ICTs required to connect to it, their ability to make effective use of them is at a disadvantage compared to more educated or [[Digital literacy|digitally literate]] groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hargittai|first1=Eszter|title=Second-Level Digital Divide: Differences in People's Online Skills|journal=First Monday|date=April 2002|volume=7|issue=4|url=http://firstmonday.org/article/view/942/864|accessdate=16 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The digital divide in Canada is no longer just a question of those who have access to ICTs and those who don't, but rather bridging gaps pertaining to the second level digital divide is becoming increasingly important as resources including health care access, government documents, and businesses transition to an online space, meaning that digital literacy and technological understanding will be a key factor in the future for ensuring access to such things.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Media Smarts|title=Digital Literacy Fundamentals|url=http://mediasmarts.ca/digital-media-literacy-fundamentals/digital-literacy-fundamentals|accessdate=19 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Education ===
The level of education attained by a Canadian citizen plays a role in determining how much one uses the internet. Canadians who have graduated high school are 67% more likely to connect online than those who have not graduated. Canadians who are currently attending school also have an almost five times higher online access rate compared to those without a high school diploma.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Education levels not only determine how frequently Canadian citizens connect online, but also represent how engaged they are in various online activities. Canadians who have graduated high school perform more online activities than those without a high school diploma, and university graduates complete more online activities than those who have only graduated high school. In regards to social networking, current students utilize [[social media]] services more frequently than those who are not currently in school, and Canadians with less than a high school diploma use social media more often than university graduates do.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== Age ===
As of 2013 research has shown that 80% of Canadians who are sixteen years of age or older are connected to the internet and actively participate online. This number is up from 2007 when only 73% of Canadians who were sixteen years of age or older were engaging online.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Approximately five million people within Canada are 65 years of age or older, and belong to an age group which shows some of the lowest levels of ICT usage and online engagement due to lacking access and digital literacy. [[Ageism]] is also a contributing factor to this phenomenon, as many elderly Canadians feel disconnected from online issues and discourse amidst an online population which tends to be composed mostly of younger people. Accessibility issues are another contributing factor to the lack of older Canadians online, as barriers such as websites with smaller text can make it more difficult for some people to navigate the [[World Wide Web]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|last1=Lagacé|first1=Martine|last2=Charmarkeh|first2=Houssein|last3=Laplante|first3=Joelle|last4=Tanguay|first4=Annick|title=How Ageism Contributes to the Second-Level Digital Divide: The Case of Canadian Seniors|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/283719507_How_Ageism_Contributes_to_the_Second-Level_Digital_Divide_The_Case_of_Canadian_Seniors|publisher=Journal of Technologies and Human Usability|accessdate=17 November 2016|date=November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gender ===
While the gap in Canada between men and women who have online access and own ICTs is shrinking to the point of almost non-existence, gaps still prevail regarding the quantity and type of use that exists between males and females. Canadian men make more use of the internet overall, performing more online activities and being generally more engaged compared to women.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; However, women are found to make greater use of social network media, with a 58% higher usage rate compared to men.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== Language and culture ===
Canada's [[Multilingualism|multilingual]] nature results in discrepancies between the use that Canadians of different first languages get out of online resources. This was a prominent factor of division during the earlier days of the internet, as there was far less motivation for [[French Canadians]] to go online due to a lack of French websites and information available compared to English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|last1=Howard|first1=Philip|last2=Laura|first2=Busch|last3=Sheets|first3=Penelope|title=Comparing Digital Divides: Internet Access and Social Inequality in Canada and the United States|url=http://www.ryerson.ca/~cmiddlet/cc8987/readings/2192-5865-1-PB.pdf|publisher=University of Washington|access-date=17 October 2016|date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of the 2011 [[Census in Canada|Canada Census]], 57% of Canadians speak English as their first language, with 21% speaking French, and 20% speaking a language other than English or French as their first language.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Immigration is another factor which must be considered when looking at the digital divide in Canada, as in some Canadian cities over half of the residents are foreign born. Immigrants who have resided in Canada for a fair length of time, as well as Canadian born immigrants have a 68% higher chance of using the internet compared to immigrants who have arrived in Canada recently.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Plans are currently underway to connect [[First Nations]] communities across Canada with high speed internet access. The [[Government of Canada]] recently announced $2.2 million in funding to support the Pathways to Technology project in [[British Columbia]], which is focused on connecting "unserved or underserved" First Nations residents in the province with internet connectivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Government of Canada|title=Government of Canada Supports Broadband Internet Connection in Eight First Nations Communities in British Columbia|url=http://news.gc.ca/web/article-en.do?nid=1056869|publisher=News Release|accessdate=18 November 2016|date=26 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Manitoba]] $4.3 million in Federal funding has been given to the Manitoba First Nations Technology Council with the purpose of providing high speed internet to all 63 First Nations communities within the province, a project which will utilize 3,600 kilometers of [[Optical fiber cable|fiber optic cable]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Taylor|first1=Jillian|title=Indigenous company to bring high-speed internet to all of Manitoba's First Nations communities|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/manitoba-first-nations-technology-council-high-speed-internet-1.3699650|accessdate=18 November 2016|publisher=CBC News|date=28 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effects ==
Lacking access to ICTs, satisfactory broadband service, or digital literacy results in a less informed society and puts those who lack access at a disadvantage compared to others,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; as Canadians are more frequently looking to online sources for news, with social media platforms such as Facebook becoming an increasingly prominent way for people in Canada to consume information.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Participation online is also important as it expands the social, cultural, and economic possibilities of those who are active on the internet, as services and resources are increasingly transitioning to online spaces, leaving those without online connectivity with a lack of access to them.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Lacking online access and the knowledge or technology to make use of it also effects Canada's economy as a whole, preventing Canadians from the ability to purchase products or services from other Canadians who operate online businesses.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Inadequate knowledge regarding technology is also a growing issue for Canadians as the world becomes more technology and online focused, making the need for digital literacy an increasingly important factor in education and labour, as computers open new opportunities for learning and training.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Solutions ==
===Broadband as an essential service===
Unlike telephone and television provision which are considered essential services within Canada, and are required under Canada's basic service objective to be available to all Canadians regardless of ability to pay for them, broadband internet access does not fall under the same guidelines.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; It has been proposed in recent years that broadband should be deemed an essential service along with telephone and television, and hearings are currently being held to discuss the feasibility of this idea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Masse|first1=Martin|last2=Beaudry|first2=Paul|title=Nearly every Canadian will soon have high-speed Internet, so why is the CRTC meddling?|url=http://business.financialpost.com/fp-comment/nearly-every-canadian-will-soon-have-high-speed-internet-so-why-is-the-crtc-meddling|accessdate=23 November 2016|publisher=Financial Post|date=4 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the present time incumbent ISPs disagree with this proposition, claiming that the currently available internet connectivity services offered in all but some rural areas are sufficient to the point of not needing to be regulated by the CRTC.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===Connecting Canadians===
A program run by the Government of Canada known as Connecting Canadians is currently undergoing the task of improving Canada's online broadband network access to the point of providing all Canadians with a minimum quality of 5 [[Megabit|megabits]] per second download speed and 1 megabit per second upload speed, target speeds seen by the CRTC as being fast enough to allow sufficient use of the Internet for carrying out essential tasks. This is to be achieved by providing subsidies to ISPs to upgrade and expand networks into rural areas, and aims to supply almost 300,000 households with high speed internet connections by 2019.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

===Public access===
Locations such as public libraries where a person can connect to the internet for free without the need of owning ICTs or paying for internet access are one way of reducing the gap between those who can participate online and those who cannot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Information Policy and Access Center|title=Digital Literacy &amp; Public Libraries|url=http://www.plinternetsurvey.org/analysis/public-libraries-and-digital-literacy|website=Public Libraries &amp; the Internet|accessdate=23 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city of [[Toronto]] is currently partnering with [[Google]] in an effort to provide portable Wi-Fi hotspots for Canadians who would not otherwise be able to afford online connectivity. These hotspots can be taken to a user's home for a period of six months and offer 10 gigabytes of usable data per month. They can currently be obtained from six [[Toronto Public Library]] locations across the city.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

===Basic service package===
In 2016 the CRTC mandated television service providers to offer a basic TV package to customers for a maximum price of $25, which can then be expanded upon by purchasing additional channels. The purpose of such a package is to make television service affordable for Canadians who otherwise might not be able to afford a package that includes various extra or undesired channels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=CRTC|title=You Have Choices. Demand Better.|url=http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/television/program/alacarte.htm|publisher=Government of Canada|accessdate=24 November 2016|date=21 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same has been proposed to be done for broadband service by having the CRTC determine a sufficient service quality of fixed price that ISPs will be mandated to offer to customers. As low cost internet connectivity options in Canada have been disappearing in favour of mid to high level packages priced at an average of around $50, it is believed that such regulation would contribute to the narrowing of the digital divide within Canada for those who lack sufficient access due to monetary reasons.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===Improvement of digital literacy===
The improvement of digital literacy among Canadians has the potential to shrink the divide which exists between citizens who make frequent use of ICTs and online resources, and those who don't. It is being recommended that Canada adapt a digital literacy strategy similar to those which already exist in countries such as the United States and [[Australia]], ensuring that children are learning how to utilize technology efficiently and safely as early as kindergarten, and improving such digital skills throughout compulsory education until grade 12.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Due to education systems within Canada being controlled at the provincial level it is difficult for the Federal government to implement digital literacy guidelines for schools within the country to use, despite the fact that an improvement in digital literacy would benefit all of Canada, making the facilitation of such a strategy a Federal issue.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

ICT use is also becoming a key way to facilitate job training and educate people regarding skills required to operate in a world with a constantly evolving digital landscape. As all but 1% of business establishments in Canada are considered either small or medium-sized enterprises, increased digital literacy would ensure that such businesses have the tools and knowledge required to make good use of the internet, as well as have the ability to better serve customers and remain competitive in the global market.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==Opposing views==
Commissioner Michael O'Rielly of the U.S. [[Federal Communications Commission]] is on record as having asserted that internet access "doesn't even come close to the threshold to be considered a basic human right."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/internet-access-digital-divide-1.3433848 CBC article]&lt;/ref&gt; He added that "People do a disservice by overstating its relevancy or stature in people's lives...People can and do live without internet access, and many lead very successful lives."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/internet-access-digital-divide-1.3433848 CBC article]&lt;/ref&gt; The Financial Post noted that [[Everett Rogers]] had described the stages of technology adoption and that "(w)hat critics consider a market failure is actually just the normal course of technology adoption."&lt;ref&gt;[http://business.financialpost.com/fp-comment/nearly-every-canadian-will-soon-have-high-speed-internet-so-why-is-the-crtc-meddling Financial Post article]&lt;/ref&gt; The author concluded "there is no need to create new funding mechanisms or impose more layers of discretionary regulation in order to duplicate what market players are already doing in an efficient manner."&lt;ref&gt;[http://business.financialpost.com/fp-comment/nearly-every-canadian-will-soon-have-high-speed-internet-so-why-is-the-crtc-meddling Financial Post article]&lt;/ref&gt; As the argument continues, some Canadians are cutting back on basic needs like food and rent to stay online because they feel that internet access is a right rather than a luxury. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/internet-access-digital-divide-1.3433848|title=CRTC will soon have to decide whether home internet access is a Canadian right|work=CBC News|access-date=2017-09-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The awards take into consideration voluntary schemes such as [[Eco-Management and Audit Scheme|EMAS]] and [[Ecolabel]], together with other comparable projects, which demonstrate commitment to develop and apply [[sustainable management]] practices. The awards were originally established in 1987 as the European Better Environment Awards for Industry, renamed in 2000 as the European Awards for the Environment, and renamed again in 2004 as the current European Business Awards for the Environment.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/environment/awards/ebae_history.html|title= History and Policy|publisher= European Commission|accessdate = 22 November 2015}} &lt;/ref&gt;

The awards are presented in five categories: Management, Product and services, Process innovation, International business cooperation and Business and [[biodiversity]].

More specifically, it is used to refer to a distinct group of farmers in Afghanistan &lt;ref&gt;Maloney, Clarence (1978) ''Language and Civilization Change in South Asia'' E.J.

Iranica'' makes clear in the article on Afghanistan&amp;nbsp;— Ethnography that "The term Farsiwan also has the regional forms Parsiwan and Parsiban. In religion they are Imamite Shiite. In the literature they are often mistakenly referred to as Tajik." [http://www.iranica.com/newsite/articles/v1f5/v1f5a040a.html Dupree, Louis (1982) "Afghanistan: (iv.) Ethnography", in ''Encyclopædia Iranica''] Online Edition 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Emadi, Hafizullah (2005) ''Culture And Customs Of Afghanistan'' Greenwood Press, Westport, Conn., {{ISBN|0-313-33089-1}}, on page 11 says: "Farsiwan are a small group of people who reside in southern and western towns and villages in Herat. They are sometimes erroneously referred to as Tajiks."&lt;/ref&gt; The term excludes the [[Hazara people|Hazāra]] and [[Aymāq]] tribes who also speak dialects of Persian, but are generally believed to be distinct from the Tajiks.&lt;ref name="EofI"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |author1=M. Longworth Dames |author2=G. Morgenstierne |author3=R. Ghirshman |title = AF&lt;u&gt;GH&lt;/u&gt;ĀNISTĀN| encyclopedia = [[Encyclopaedia of Islam]]| edition = CD-ROM Edition v. 1.0| publisher = Koninklijke Brill NV| location = Leiden, The Netherlands| year = 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Afghanistan, the Farsiwan are found predominantly in [[Herat province|Herat]] and [[Farah province|Farah]] provinces. They are roughly the same as the [[Persian-speakers of Iran|Persians of Eastern Iran]].&lt;ref&gt;H. F. Schurmann, ''The Mongols of Afghanistan: an Ethnography of the Moghols and Related Peoples of Afghanistan''. The Hague: Mouton, 1962: [https://www.jstor.org/stable/668975]; p. 75: ''"... the Tajiks of Western Afghanistan [are] roughly the same as the Khûrâsânî Persians on the other side of the line ..."''&lt;/ref&gt; Although the term was originally coined with Persian language's [[lexicon|lexical]] root (''Pārsī&lt;u&gt;bān&lt;/u&gt;''), the suffix has been transformed into a [[Pashto language|Pashto]] form (''-wān''), and is usually utilized by the [[Pashtuns]] to designate the Persian-speakers. 

The cartographer [[Mehrdad Izady|Michael Izady]] does not make a Tajik specific distinction and defines Parsiwans as "urbanites of any ethnic background who speak only Persian and have lost all their ethnic and tribal affiliations."&lt;ref&gt;Ethnic map of Afghanistan, http://gulf2000.columbia.edu/images/maps/Afghanistan_Ethnic_lg.png&lt;/ref&gt; In his 2013 study he found that 4.2% of Afghanistan's population were Parsiwans and that the group were historically the most likely ethnic group to be employed in the government as bureaucrats and that "most of what people in the West know about Afghanistan has come to them through these three Persian-speaking minorities [Tajiks, [[Qizilbash#Afghanistan|Kizilbash]] and Parsiwans]."&lt;ref&gt;Ethnic map of Afghanistan, http://gulf2000.columbia.edu/images/maps/Afghanistan_Ethnic_lg.png&lt;/ref&gt;

== Distinction from other Tajiks ==
Like the Persians of Iran, the Farsiwan are often distinguished from other Tajiks by their adherence to [[Shia|Shia Islam]] as opposed to the [[Sunni]] sect favored by the majority of Tajiks. However, there are also minor linguistic differences especially among the rural Farsiwan. The Farsiwan sometimes speak a dialect more akin to the [[Dari (Afghanistan)|''Darī'']] dialects of the [[Persian language]], for example the dialect of [[Kabul]],&lt;ref&gt;Ch. M. Kieffer, "Afghanistan v. - Languages of Afghanistan", in [[Encyclopaedia Iranica]], printed version, [http://www.iranica.com/newsite/search/searchpdf.isc?ReqStrPDFPath=/home1/iranica/articles/v1_articles/afghanistan/languages&amp;OptStrLogFile=/home/iranica/public_html/logs/pdfdownload.html p. 507]: ''"[...] 'Dari' is a term long recommended by Afghan authorities to designate Afghan Persian in contrast to Iranian Persian; a written language common to all educated Afghanis, Dari must not be confused with Kaboli, the dialect of Kabul [...] that is more or less understood by more than 80% of the non-Persian speaking population [...]"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;E. H. Glassman,  ''“Conversational Dari: An Introductory Course in Dari (= Farsi = Persian) as Spoken in Afghanistan”'' (revised edition of “Conversational Kabuli Dari,” with the assistance of M. Taher Porjosh), Kabul (''The Language and Orientation Committee, International Afghan Mission'', P.O. Box 625), 1970-72.&lt;/ref&gt; as opposed to the standard ''Tehrānī'' dialect of Iran. However, most of the Fārsīwān speak the ''[[Greater Khorasan|Khorasani]]'' dialect, native to the Afghanistan-Iran border region, namely [[Herat|Herāt]] and [[Farah province|Farāh]], as well as the Iranian provinces of [[Khorasan (Province)|Khorasan]]. Unlike the [[Hazara people|Hazara]] who are also Persian-speaking and Shia, the Farsiwan do not show any, or very limited traces of [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] and [[Mongol]] ancestry as they are, like the [[Pashtuns]], of [[Mediterranean race|Mediterranean]] substock.&lt;ref&gt;Library of Congress Country Studies - Afghanistan - ''Farsiwan'' ([http://countrystudies.us/afghanistan/46.htm LINK])&lt;/ref&gt; Although the [[Qizilbash]] of Iran and Afghanistan are also Persian-speaking Shias, they are usually regarded as a separate group from the Farsiwan.&lt;ref&gt;Savory, Roger M. (1965) "The consolidation of Safawid power in Persia" ''In'' Savory, Roger M. (1987) ''Studies on the History of Ṣafawid Iran'' Variorum Reprints, London, {{ISBN|0-86078-204-2}}, originally published in ''Der Islam'' no. 41 (October 1965) pp. 71-94&lt;/ref&gt;

Some confusion arises because an alternative name used locally for the Fārsīwān (as well as for the Tājiks in general) is '''Dehgān''', meaning "village settlers", in the sense of "urban". The term is used in contrast to "nomadic".&lt;ref name=EI&gt;M. Longworth Dames, [[G. Morgenstierne]], R. Ghirshman, ''"Afghānistān"'', in [[Encyclopaedia of Islam]], Online Edition&lt;/ref&gt;

== Geographic distribution ==
There are approximately 1.5 million Farsiwans in Afghanistan, mainly in the provinces of [[Herat Province|Herat]], [[Farah Province|Farah]]&lt;ref name="Adamec"&gt;Adamec, Ludwig W. (1997) ''Historical Dictionary of Afghanistan'' Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, {{ISBN|0-585-21026-8}}, on page 106&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ghor]], and [[Mazar-i-Sharif]]. They are also the main inhabitants of the city of [[Herat|Herāt]].&lt;ref&gt;P. English, ''"Cities In The Middle East"'', e.d. L. Brown, [[Princeton University]], USA 1973&lt;/ref&gt; Smaller populations can be found in [[Kabul]], [[Kandahar]] and [[Ghazni]].&lt;ref name=EI /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dupree"&gt;[http://www.iranica.com/newsite/articles/v1f5/v1f5a040a.html L. Dupree, "Afghanistan: (iv.) Ethnography", in ''Encyclopædia Iranica''] Online Edition 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the large number of refugees from Afghanistan, significant Farsiwan communities nowadays also exist in Iran (mostly in [[Mashhad]] and [[Tehran]]).

==Kidnapping==
On December 10, 2008, Batista was kidnapped outside a restaurant in [[Saltillo|Saltillo, Coahuila, Mexico]] by unknown assailants&lt;ref name="yahoo"/&gt; while there to speak and give anti-kidnapping advice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lacey|first=Marc|title=Anti-kidnapping consultant kidnapped in Mexico|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/16/world/americas/16iht-16mexico.18709834.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=December 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Batista was working as a negotiator to secure the release of a friend of his, while he was in a restaurant with several other people he received a phone call advising that the victim had been released and a car was being sent for him. As Batista left the restaurant he was forced into a Jeep by a group of four people who had been waiting for him. An hour later the kidnapping victim was released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Felix Batista|url=https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/kidnap/felix-batista|website=[[FBI]]|accessdate=4 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then, no one has had any communication with him and no one has ever claimed responsibility for his kidnapping {{as of|2016|June|lc=y}}.

A statement from Batista's family said there was no sign of violence at the scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/CRIME/01/07/security.expert.kidnap/index.html | work=CNN | title='Please have mercy,' wife begs kidnappers - CNN.com | date=2009-01-07 | accessdate=2010-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Female infanticide in Pakistan''' is a common practice. [[Female infanticide]] is the deliberate killing of newborn female children. [[Aid agency|Aid groups]] have reported that hardly any steps have been taken in [[Pakistan]] for preventing infanticide, especially among poor people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Mariya Karimjee |url=http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2014/1/14/infanticides-on-theriseinpakistan.html |title=Infanticide is on the rise in Pakistan &amp;#124; Al Jazeera America |publisher=America.aljazeera.com |date=2014-01-14 |accessdate=2014-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
During the 19th century, the Northwest [[British raj|British India]] one-fourth of the population preserved only half the daughters, while other 3/4th of the population had balanced sex ratio. There were 118 males per 100 females. This is comparable to the late C20th sex ratio in the area, now divided between India and Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = Child Survival: Anthropological Perspectives on the Treatment and Maltreatment of Children|last = Hughes|first = Nancy Scheper|publisher = Springer|isbn = 9781556080289|year = 1987|page = 99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among [[Kharal|Kharal people]], female infanticide was common. A report from 1884 states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Kharrals are the most northerly of the great [[Tribes of the Bar Region of the Punjab|Ravi tribes]], occupying a great portion of the land between [[Gogera|Gugera]] and the [[Lahore]] district on both sides of the river, and extending some distance into the [[Gujranwala District|Gujranwala district]]. The Kharrals were [[Rajput]]s... and never got on with each other. The feuds of the [[Lakhera]]s and upper Ravi Kharrals have been noticed. The tragic adventure of Mirza and Sahiban is said to have been the cause of desperate quarrels. Mirza was a Kharral of the Sahi muhin... went as a boy to [[Hast Khewa|Khewa]] in [[Jhang District|Jhang]], where he [[cousin marriage|fell in love with his cousin]] Sahiban, the daughter of the chief man of the place. Her parents betrothed her to a youth of the Chadar tribe, but before the marriage could place, Mirza ran away with her. He was pursued and slain. Her relations strangled Sahiban... These murders were cause of such bloody feuds between the clans that it at the length was thought inauspicious to have daughters, and as soon as they were born, they were strangled as Sahiban had been. This custom of female infanticide was common among the Kharrals till Colonel Hamilton, Commissioner of [[Multan District|Multan]], persuaded them to discontinue it.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;ref&gt; ''Gazetteer of the Montgomery District''. 1884. pp 62-63&lt;/ref&gt;

This report is cited in a 2010 book on son preference, giving the context of the [[Mirza Sahiban]] tragic romance, and putting the practice in a wider socio-economic analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = Son Preference: Sex Selection, Gender and Culture in South Asia|last = Purewal|first = Navtej K.|isbn = 9781845204686|page = 33 |publisher = Berg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Son preference==
Similarly to other countries in [[South Asia]], Pakistan has a strong social preference for sons. Such preference prevails in rural areas, due to male inheritance of agricultural land, and males being seen as better suited to work the land. Boys are often given better access to resources, healthcare, and education. Prenatal sex-selection is more common among the upper classes who have access to medical care and technology, while abuse after birth (infanticide and abandonment) is more common among the lower classes. Girls who are unwanted are often forced into [[child marriage|early marriage]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.popcouncil.org/uploads/pdfs/2015PGY_SexSelectionPakistan.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/Pnadm056.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dowry==
Families often do not want daughters because they are expected to pay [[dowry]] upon their marriage. The giving and expectation of a dowry is part of the culture, with most marriages in every region of Pakistan involving transfer of a dowry from the bride's family to a groom's family.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.popcouncil.org/pdfs/ayp0102.pdf Zeba Sathar, Cynthia Lloyd, et al. (2001–2002) "Adolescents and Youth in Pakistan"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140312003405/http://www.popcouncil.org/pdfs/ayp0102.pdf |date=2014-03-12 }} pp.92-116,  Population Council (with support from UNICEF)&lt;/ref&gt; Conflicts related to dowry often lead to violence. At over 2000 dowry-related deaths per year, and annual rates exceeding 2.45 deaths per 100,000 women from dowry-related violence, Pakistan has the highest reported number of dowry death rates per 100,000 women in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.refworld.org/pdfid/4e4213da2.pdf |title=Operational Note: Pakistan|publisher=Refworld, A United Nations initiative|date=August 2011|pages=16–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/21365/|title=To estimate an equation explaining the determinants of Dowry|publisher=|accessdate=20 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture of family honor==
{{Main|Family honor|Honor killing in Pakistan}}
Pakistan has a strong 'culture of honor', where a female can easily tarnish the 'honor' and 'reputation' of her family through certain behaviors (often related to [[chastity]]), whether these behaviors are real or suspected by the community. The ''family honor'' is an abstract concept involving the perceived quality of worthiness and respectability that affects the social standing and the self-evaluation of a group of related people, both corporately and individually.&lt;ref name="Malina2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bruce J. Malina|title=The New Testament world: insights from cultural anthropology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ek3fSY7jRDcC&amp;pg=PA42|accessdate=7 November 2011|date=15 February 2001|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|isbn=978-0-664-22295-6|page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="spain"/&gt; The [[family]] is viewed as the main source of [[honor]] and the community highly values the relationship between honor and the family.&lt;ref name="Family" /&gt; The conduct of family members reflects upon family honor and the way the family perceives itself, and is perceived by others.&lt;ref name="spain"/&gt; [[Honor killings]] in Pakistan are known locally as ''karo-kari''. An honor killing is the [[homicide]] of a member of a family or social group by other members, due to the belief the victim has brought [[honour|dishonour]] upon the family or community. The death of the victim is viewed as a way to restore the reputation and honour of the family.&lt;ref name="Goldstein 2002 31"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goldstein|first=Matthew|title=The Biological Roots of Heat-of-Passion Crimes and Honor Killings|journal=Politics and the Life Sciences|year=2002|volume=21|issue=2|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In order to avoid such problems related to the honor culture, families reject altogether the idea of having daughters.&lt;ref&gt;https://iussp.org/sites/default/files/event_call_for_papers/generaltheoryforgenderpreference%28BUSAN201308%29.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sex selective abortion==
[[Sex selective abortion]] - the practice of terminating a pregnancy based upon the female sex of the fetus -  is happening in Pakistan, although it is illegal.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2012/06/abandoned-aborted-or-left-for-dead-these-are-the-vanishing-girls-of-pakistan/258648/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.dawn.com/news/1191470&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://iussp.org/sites/default/files/event_call_for_papers/SRB%20Abstract%20-%20IUSSP%202013_fin.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Abortion]] is illegal in Pakistan, except if needed to preserve the pregnant woman' life or health.&lt;ref&gt; http://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/abortion/doc/pakistan.doc.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevalence==

According to one estimate from the end of the 20th century, about 3.1 million girls are missing in Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = Hardness of Heart/hardness of Life: The Stain of Human Infanticide|last = Milner|first = Larry Stephen|page = 223|publisher = University Press of America}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = Female Terror|last = Magma|first = Ann|publisher = Random House|year = 2012|isbn = 9781448132362|page = 103}}&lt;/ref&gt; The extent to which this is attributable to infanticide is contested; see [[Missing women of Asia]].

In 1998, 391 infant girls were found dead, about 68 in 1999, 59 in 2000, 51 in 2001, and 39 in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = Forsaken Females: The Global Brutalization of Women|authors=Andrea Parrot, Nina Cummings|page = 65|publisher = Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn = 9780742580428|year = 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of infanticides, particularly of girls, is on the increase, according to the [[Edhi Foundation]]. They know of 890 newborns killed in 2008, 999 in 2009 and about 1,210 in 2010, and this counts only the large cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=AFP |url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/105019/infanticide-on-the-rise-in-pakistan-statistics/ |title=Infanticide on the rise: 1,210 babies found dead in 2010, says Edhi – The Express Tribune |publisher=Tribune.com.pk |date= |accessdate=2014-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of Gesellschaft zu Fraumünster ==
In medieval times, in Zürich all female and male [[Citizenship|''Bürger'']] were members of the guilds, but beginning in the 19th century women were no more tolerated within the guilds then more as ''decoration'' of their men being still members of the guilds of Zürich. The history of the ''Gesellschaft zu Fraumünsters'' dates back to the late 9th century when the abbess of the [[Fraumünster]] Abbey (853 A.D.) in fact reigned the city of Zürich as ''Fürstäbtissin'' (imperial abbess) nominated by the king of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], among them [[Katharina von Zimmern]].&lt;ref name="gesellschaft"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fraumuenstergesellschaft.ch/#geschichte|title=Geschichte|publisher=Gesellschaft zu Fraumünster|author=|date=|accessdate=2014-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Gesellschaft zu Fraumünster'', being the society of the former noble women of the Fraumünster Abbey, was established in 1989. Now, the honorable women of the society cultivate the virtuous habits of the former abbey by p.e. honoring the work of engaged women in the modern society. Beginning fifteen years ago, the society started to organize every three years the so-called ''Mittelalter Spectaculum'', a medieval funfair, at the [[Münsterhof]] square.

== Sechseläuten and the guilds of Zürich ==
Since 2010 the guilds of Zürich ''allow'' to the women of the society to practice ''[[Sechseläuten]]'', as guests of the ''[[Constaffel]]'' society, for historical reasons as until 1524 AD the abbesses of the Fraumünster abbey were members of the ''Constaffel''.&lt;ref name="ta20141106"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tagesanzeiger.ch/zuerich/stadt/Manche-Witze-sind-unter-der-Guertellinie/story/11527852|title=Manche Witze sind unter der Gürtellinie|publisher=[[Tages-Anzeiger]]|author=Tina Huber|language=German|date=2014-11-06|accessdate=2014-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of November 2014, expressly agreed by the guilds of Zürich, the Fraumünster society – still as ''guest'', not as an ''official'' member –&lt;ref name="ta20141106"/&gt; may practice ''Sechseläuten'' provisorily ''until 2022'', as also confirmed by the association (''Zentralkomitee der Zünfte'') of the Zürich guilds. Mrs Regula Zweifel, representant of the Fraumünster society, told in an interview on 6 November 2014, ″''... after 25 years, the tug of war is finally over. The fact that we now have guest status at [[Sechseläutenplatz]], is great. But it is only a first step ...''″ The association of guild members will, on occasion of an official ceremony, sign an agreement between the Fraumünster society and the so-called ''Zunftmeister's'' (literally: ''masters of the guilds'') in December 2014: as long as the agreement applies, the Fraumünster society may participate namely the ''Sechseläuten'' procession and ''Böögg'' burning, but neither do any steps to join the assembly of the Zürich guilds nor participate other activities related to ''Sechseläuten''.&lt;ref name="ta20141106"/&gt;&lt;ref name="zo20141106"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zol.ch/ueberregional/kanton-zuerich/Frauenzunft-wird-SechselaeutenDauergast/story/27744642|title=Frauenzunft wird Sechseläuten-Dauergast|publisher=[[Zürcher Oberländer]]|author=|language=German|date=2014-11-06|accessdate=2014-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="zzz"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fraumuenstergesellschaft.ch/media/upload/news/MM_Verkommnis_def.pdf|title=Medienmitteilung (press release)|publisher=Zentralkomitee der Zünfte Zürichs|author=|language=German|date=2014-11-06|accessdate=2014-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activities ==
The association organizes monthly meetings, and its members are involved in numerous cultural projects, among them the honor book for women, a silent memorial to all women who do extraordinary things in everyday life and shape society actively.  Every three years the "Mittelalter Spectaculum" at the [[Münsterhof]] plaza is organized. Each year, the society honors posthumously female personalities with a plaque at their site of action in Zürich, and publishes a New Year's sheet.

== Notable women awarded by the association ==
The ''Fraumünster'' society posthumously honors women who have provided outstanding professional services or social innovations in Zürich. The honoring take place on the morning of the ''Sechseläuten'' festival and are public. Whenever possible, a plaque is attached to a former residence or place of activity of the honored women.&lt;ref name="fraumünster-Frauenehrungen"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fraumuenstergesellschaft.ch/#page387|title=Frauenehrungen|publisher=Gesellschaft zu Fraumünster|author=|language=German|date=|accessdate=2014-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fraumünster-awardlist"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fraumuenstergesellschaft.ch/media/upload/aktivitaten/frauenehrung/frauenehrungen.pdf |title=Frauenehrungen der Gesellschaft zu Fraumünster |publisher=Gesellschaft zu Fraumünster |author= |language=German |date=2014 |accessdate=2014-11-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150207162646/http://www.fraumuenstergesellschaft.ch/media/upload/aktivitaten/frauenehrung/frauenehrungen.pdf |archivedate=2015-02-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2752">'''Halbi''' or '''Halba''' is a tribal community of [[India]]. It is mostly found in the states of [[Madhya Pradesh]], [[Gujarat]], [[Chhattisgarh]] and [[Maharashtra]].

The Halba tribes were one of the major and most influential tribal groups of the state of [[Bastar state|Bastar]] in the 17th century. Halbas are spread over different parts of India like Maharashtra, Gujarat, Chattisghar, Madhya Pradesh, Odisa, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh and mainly in the Vidarbha (part of Maharashtra state) from Bastar. 
Halba tribes were active in the politics and military of Bastar State. The goddess of the Halba tribe is [[Jagdalpur#Danteshwari Temple at Jagdalpur|Ma Danteshwari]]. The language of the Halba tribe is Halbi, which is a combination of [[Marathi language|Marathi]] and [[Odia language|Odia]].&lt;ref&gt;Masica (1991)&lt;/ref&gt; Halba tribe migrated from Bastar beause of defeat in rebellion in 1774. After migration in different parts of country they adopted different occupation for their livelihood. 
As per occupation they further divided into four major occupational groups as follows- 
1) Pentiya Halba (who migrated to Odisa) 
2) Weaver Halba (who migrated to old central province and bearar now part of Maharashtra ) 
3) Telanga Halba ( Chattisghar) 
4) Zadi/Zadiya Halba.

Meanwhile in Maharashtra some zamindars who are originally upper caste Rajput and Thakur adopted the Halbi nomenclature for looting benifits given to scheduled tribe.

The primitive Weaver Halba/Halbi tribe has different kul/surnames Gonnade, Nandanmare, Jinava, Nandanwar, Ninawe, Parhate, Kumbhare, Bende, Dekate, Dhakate,Mataghare, Matwale, Karoo, Barapatre, Kohad, Hedva, Hedau, etc. They still speak their old Halbi dialect in Nagpur, Chandrapur and Bhandara district.

Halbas have also migrated to Yevla (Nashik), Bhingar (Ahmednagr), Nashik, Pune, Mumbai, Bhiwandi in then Cetral Prtovince in 18th century and adopted weaving profession. Now only in Yevla, Bhiwandi, Bhingar most of Nagpures are engaged in weaving prtofessio. Rest have diverted to various professions or services.

Most of them are known commonly as Nagpuri / Nagpure.

Most of them are belongs to 18 Kuls of Halba out of 39 Kuls in Halba.

Till today most of Nagpures speak their own Halbi dialect in their day to day livelyhood.

All are still observed their own traditions, faith-believes and daities.

'''Hauzel''' is a clan found to be within the [[Paite people|Paite]] group of the Zos [[Zomi]] tribe popularly known as [[Zomi and Mizo]] by different clans of the tribe particularly in [[Manipur]] and [[Mizoram]] areas, northeast of [[India]]. They are also found in the Chin State of Burma as a Tedim-Chin sub-clan. The Hauzel are mostly concentrated in [[Lamka]], the second largest town of Manipur state, India and many of them are living in Mizoram. Hauzel are mostly highly educated and they are known for their education and general administration skills.

The '''distinction between Hua ({{linktext|華}}) and Yi ({{linktext|夷}})''', also known as '''Sino–barbarian dichotomy''',{{sfn|Pines|2003}} is an [[History of China#Ancient China|ancient Chinese]] concept that differentiated a culturally defined "China" (called Hua, [[Huaxia]] 華夏, or Xia 夏) from cultural or ethnic outsiders ([[Dongyi|Yi]] "barbarians"). Although Yi is often translated as "barbarian", other translations of this term in English include "foreigners",{{sfn|Morrison|1823||p=586-7}}
"ordinary others"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Liu|2004|pp=10–11}} Liu believes the Chinese in early China did not originally think of ''Yi'' as a derogatory term.&lt;/ref&gt; "wild tribes",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=James |last=Legge|authorlink=James Legge|title= Shangshu, Tribute of Yu |url=http://ctext.org/shang-shu/tribute-of-yu|website=ctext.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "uncivilized tribes".{{sfn|Mair|1998}} 
The Hua–Yi distinction asserted Chinese superiority, but implied that outsiders could [[sinicization|become ''Hua'']] by adopting Chinese values and customs.

==Historical context==
{{See also|Sinocentrism|Four Barbarians}}
[[File:Huaxiasiyi.svg|thumb|[[Zhou dynasty]] cosmography of [[Huaxia]] and the [[Four Barbarians|Siyi]].]]
[[History of China#Ancient China|Ancient China]] was composed of a group of states that arose in the [[Yellow River]] valley. According to historian Li Feng, during the [[Zhou dynasty]] (ca. 1041–771 BCE), the contrast between the 'Chinese' Zhou and the 'non-Chinese' [[Xirong]] or [[Dongyi]] was "more political than cultural or ethnic".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Li|2006|p=286}}. Li explains that "Rong" meant something like "warlike foreigners" and "Yi" was close to "foreign conquerables".&lt;/ref&gt; Lothar von Falkenhausen argues that the perceived contrast between "Chinese" and "Barbarians" was accentuated during the [[Zhou dynasty|Eastern Zhou]] period (770–256 BCE), when adherence to Zhou rituals became increasingly recognized as a "barometer of civilization."; a meter for sophistication and cultural refinement.{{sfn|von Falkenhausen|1999|p= 544}} It is widely agreed by historians that the distinction between the Hua and the Yi emerged during that period.{{sfn|Shelach|1999|pp=222–23}}

Gideon Shelach claimed that Chinese texts tended to overstate the distinction between the Chinese and their northern neighbors, ignoring many intergroup similarities. He doubted the existence of the Hua–Yi distinction.{{sfn|Shelach|1999|p=222}} Nicola di Cosmo doubted the existence of a strong demarcation between the "Zhou Universe" and "a discrete, 'barbarian', non-Zhou universe"{{sfn|Di Cosmo|2002|p=103}} and claimed that Chinese historian, [[Sima Qian]]'s popularized this concept, writing of the "chasm that had always existed between China – the Hua-Hsia [Huaxia] people – and the various alien groups inhabiting the north."{{sfn|Di Cosmo|2002|p=2}}

The conclusion of the [[Warring States period]] brought the first unified Chinese state-established by the [[Qin dynasty]] in 221 BCE-who established the imperial system and forcibly standardized the traditional Chinese script, leading to the first of the distinctions between the refined Hua and the increasingly marginalized Yi. The [[Han dynasty]] (221 BCE-206 CE) further contributed to the divide with its creation of a persistent [[Han Chinese|Han cultural identity]].{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006}}

The Han Chinese civilization influenced neighboring states [[Korea]], [[Japan]], [[Vietnam]] and [[Thailand]] and other Asian countries. Although Han Chinese superiority had only been sporadically reinforced by displays of Chinese military power, the [[Sinocentrism|Sinocentric]] system treated these countries as vassals of the [[emperor of China]], literally "the Son of Heaven" (天子), who was in possession of the [[Mandate of Heaven]] (天命), the divine right to rule. Areas outside Sinocentric influence and the divine rule of the Emperor were considered to consist of uncivilized lands inhabited by barbarians.{{sfn|Arrighi|1996}}

Throughout history, Chinese frontiers had been periodically attacked by [[nomad]]ic tribes from the north and west. These people were considered ''barbarians'' by the Chinese who believed themselves to be more refined and who had begun to build cities and live an urban life based on agriculture. It was in consideration of how best to deal with this threat that the philosopher, [[Confucius]] (551 – 479 BCE) was prompted to formulate principles for relationships with the barbarians, briefly recorded in two of his ''[[Analects]]''.{{sfn|Chin|2007}}

The arrival of European trade and colonialism in the 18th and 19th centuries, exposed Chinese civilization to the developments that had long outstripped China's. As such, the nation was forced to undergo a modification of its traditional views of its relationships with those "barbarians".{{sfn|Ankerl|2000}}

==China==
Confucius lived during a time of war between Chinese states. He regarded people who did not respect [[Li (Confucianism)|"li"]], or ritual propriety, as barbarians as he believed the workings of a state should be founded on ethical conduct rather than the relatively cruel social codes imposed by conquering princes. In the Ames and Rosemont translation of Analect 3.5, Confucius said, "The [[Dongyi|Yi]] and [[Di (Five Barbarians)|Di]] barbarian tribes with rulers are not as viable as the various Chinese states without them."{{sfn|Confucius|Ames|Rosemont|1999}}

''The Disposition of Error'', a fifth-century tract defending [[Buddhism]], a religion that had originated in India, notes that when Confucius was threatening to take residence among the nine barbarian nations (九黎) he said, "If a gentleman-scholar dwells in their midst, what baseness can there be among them?"&lt;ref&gt;[http://acc6.its.brooklyn.cuny.edu/~phalsall/texts/dispos.html "The Disposition of Error (c. 5th Century BCE)"] City University of New York. Retrieved 11 Jan 2009&lt;/ref&gt; An alternate translation of the philosopher's Analect 9.14 is, "Someone said: 'They are vulgar. What can you do about them?' The Master said: 'A gentleman used to live there. How could they be vulgar?'"{{sfn|Confucius|Huang|1997}} In both translations, the author is shown to believe in the superiority of the Hua culture over that of the Yi.

The prominent ''[[Shuowen Jiezi]]'' character dictionary (121 CE) defines ''yi'' 夷 as 平 "level; peaceful" or 東方之人 "people of eastern regions" and does not attempt to marginalize them and implies that the ''Hua-Yi'' distinction was not universally held.

===Zhou Dynasty===
The ''[[Bamboo Annals]]'' records that the founder of Zhou, [[King Wu of Zhou]] "led the lords of the western barbarians" on a journey to conquer the [[Shang dynasty]]{{sfn|Creel|1970|p=59}} and while Duke Huan of Qi called upon the various Chinese states to fight the barbarian invasion and uphold the dynasty of the King of Shang, the Duke's defence of the Shang was ultimately unsuccessful, leading to the creation of the Zhou Dynasty that later contributed as much as the Shang to the Hua–Yi distinction.{{sfn|Li|Zheng|2001|p=116}}

Not all Zhou regarded the Hua–Yi distinction as a cultural barrier that needed to be overcome to 'purify' China. Zhou philosopher [[Mencius]] believed that Confucian practices were universal and timeless, and thus, followed by both Hua and Yi people- "[[Emperor Shun|Shun]] was an Eastern barbarian;{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}} he was born in Chu Feng, moved to Fu Hsia, and died in Ming T'iao. [[King Wen of Zhou|King Wen]] was a Western barbarian;{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}} he was born in Ch'i Chou and died in Pi Ying. Their native places were over a thousand ''li'' apart, and there were a thousand years between them. Yet when they had their way in the Central Kingdoms, their actions matched like the two halves of a tally. The standards of the two sages, one earlier and one later, were identical."{{sfn|Lau tran.|1970|p=128}}

===Jin Dynasty===
In order to alleviate the shortages of labor caused by the [[Three Kingdoms]] wars, the Jin allowed millions of non-Chinese, Yi people to reside in Jin territory. Many officials opposed this decision in the name of the Hua–Yi distinction, claiming that if the barbarians did not identify with the Huaxia, they would conspire to destroy the empire.{{sfn|Li|Zheng|2001|p=381}}

===Wu Hu uprising===
{{Main|Uprising of the Five Barbarians}}

During the [[Uprising of the Five Barbarians]] (五胡) and ravaging of [[North China]] that occurred around 310 CE, the [[Jin dynasty (265–420)|Jin dynasty]] and other Chinese appealed to entrenched beliefs in the Hua–Yi distinction when calling for resistance to the Wu Hu invasion and the Yi they represented.&lt;ref&gt;Li and Zheng 2001, 387–389&lt;/ref&gt; The historians of the southern dynasties, who were all Han Chinese, portrayed the Wu Hu as barbaric.{{sfn|Li|Zheng|2001|p=393–401}}

====Ran Min's order to kill the barbarians====
{{Main|Ran Min}}
{{See also|Wei–Jie war}}

In 349 or 350 CE (disputed), the Han general [[Ran Min]] (冉閔) seized power from the last emperor of the [[Zhao dynasty|Zhao]] and encouraged the [[Han Chinese]] to slaughter the [[Jie people]], many of whom lived in the Zhao capital of Ye. In this massacre and the wars that ensued, hundreds of thousands of Jie (羯), [[Qiang (historical people)|Qiang]] (羌), and [[Xiongnu]] (匈奴) were killed. The "five barbarians" quickly unified to fight Ran Min, yet Ran Min won victory after victory. Despite his military success, however, Ran's regime was toppled in 353 CE. As a result of this period of turbulence, three of the five main "barbarian" ethnic groups in China disappeared from Chinese history.{{sfn|Li|Zheng|2001|p=401}}

Ran Min continues to be a controversial figure. He is considered by some to be a hero, whereas others believe he bore extreme prejudice arising from the Hua–Yi distinction.{{sfn|Li|Zheng|2001|p=401}}

===Northern Wei===
Emperor Shaowu of [[Northern Wei]] (a state that controlled the north of China), who was of the [[Xianbei]] (鮮卑) people attempted to eliminate Yi from his state by imposing [[Sinicization]] on his people. The Xianbei language was outlawed and Xianbei people began to adopt Chinese surnames; for example, the Tuobas became the Yuans.{{sfn|Li|Zheng|2001|pp=456-458}}

===Sui Dynasty===
In 581, Sui Emperor [[Yang Jian (Sui prince)|Yang Jian]] deposed the Xianbei ruler of Northern Zhou and restored Han rule over North China. This event marked the end of all power that the Xianbei and other non-Chinese groups had over China, and racial tension subsided.{{sfn|Li|Zheng|2001}}

===Tang Dynasty===
During the [[Tang dynasty]], various ethnic groups including Koreans, Indians and Tibetans journeyed to [[Chang'an]] and other major Tang cities for business or study. These people brought their religions and customs: [[Buddhism]], [[Islam]], [[Zoroastrianism]] (''Xianjiao''), [[Manichaeism]] (''Monijiao'') and [[Syriac Christianity]] (''Jingjiao''), all of which flourished.{{sfn|Li|Zheng|2001|p=679-687}}

This cosmopolitan policy caused controversy among the literati, many of whom questioned the recommendation of the [[Kaifeng]] governor for the participation of Arab-born Li Yan-sheng in the 847 [[imperial examination]]s and several similar incidences of what they believed as incorrect racial privileging. Such was the discourse that Tang intellectual Chen An wrote an essay defending the governor's decision; ''The Heart of Being Hua'' ({{zh|t=華心|p=Huá xīn|links=no}}), which is often cited as expressing the sentiments of the "non-xenophobic" Chinese position on the Hua–Yi distinction. In the essay, Chen wrote: "If one speaks in terms of geography, then there are Hua and Yi. But if one speaks in terms of education, then there can be no such difference. For the distinction between Hua and Yi rests in the heart and is determined by their different inclinations."{{sfn|Benite|2005|p=1-3}}

A prominent Tang Confucian, [[Han Yu]], wrote in his essay ''Yuan Dao'', "When Confucius wrote the ''Chunqiu'', he said that if the feudal lords use the Yi ritual, then they should be called Yi. If they use Chinese rituals, then they should be called Chinese." Han Yu went on to lament that the Chinese of his time might all become Yi because the Tang court wanted to put Yi laws above the teachings of the former kings,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.confucianism.com.cn/detail.asp?id=25097 "孔子之作春秋也，诸侯用夷礼，则夷之；进于中国，则中国之."]&lt;/ref&gt; creating the possibility that although insiders could lose their culture, outsiders could similarly gain insider culture.

Arguments that excoriated the Tang's lax attitude towards foreigners were strengthened by the Yi-led [[An Lushan Rebellion]] (755–763), which propelled the Tang into decline.{{sfn|Li|Zheng|2001|p=679-687}} An intellectual movement "to return to the pure... sources of orthodox thought and morality", including many of the concepts of the [[Classical Prose Movement]], also targeted "foreign" religions, as exemplified by Han Yu's diatribe against Buddhism. [[Emperor Wenzong of Tang]] passed decrees in line with these views, especially restricting [[Iranian religions]] and Buddhism, but this policy was relaxed by his successors.{{sfn|Gernet|1996|pp=294–295}}

===Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms===
The "Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms" was a period in which the north of China was ruled by a non-Chinese people, the [[Shatuo]], for three short-lived dynasties while the south was ruled by Chinese. Their legitimacy was recognized by the [[Song dynasty|Song Dynasty]].{{sfn|Li|Zheng|2001|p= 778–788}}

===Song Dynasty===
The Song Dynasty saw both an economic boom and invasion by alien states. States like the [[Liao dynasty]] (遼) and [[Western Xia]] (西夏) began to take territories inhabited by large numbers of Chinese and asserted that they too were Chinese and successors to the Tang, and posed legitimacy issues for Song rule.

In response to rising concerns from citizenry and claims from Yi states such as the Western Xia, Song scholars stipulated that groups like the [[Shatuo]] (whom the Song largely succeeded and who largely continued the rule of the Tang) were not barbarian or "Yi" but Chinese or "Hua" and that the Song had only descended from ruling groups that were Hua. Secondly, the Song asserted that the Liao and Western Xia, and later the [[Later Jin (Five Dynasties)|Jin]] (金), were barbarian states despite their control of large areas of Chinese territory because they had not inherited any mandate from a legitimate, "Hua" dynasty.{{sfn|Li|Zheng|2001|pp=823–826}}

===Yuan Dynasty===
Concerns over legitimacy were not limited to the Song alone: states rose up again in the [[Yuan dynasty]], as its rulers were non-Han Chinese. However, the Yuan dynasty adopted a different approach to quelling the conflict. The Yuan asserted that the Song, Liao and Jin were all legitimate; therefore all three dynasties were given their own history, as recognition of their legitimacy.

Despite this, the Yuan racially segregated their people; dividing society into four categories:
*[[Mongols]] (蒙古): the ruling group and hence, the most important
*[[Semu]] (色目; "assorted categories"): a term for non-Chinese and non-Mongol foreigners who occupied the second slate;
*[[Han Chinese|Han]] (漢人): a term for the Han Chinese, Jurchens, and Khitan under the rule of the Jin dynasty;
*[[Han Chinese|Southerner]] (南人): a term for Han Chinese under the rule of the Song dynasty.

In addition, the Yuan also divided society into 10 castes, based on "desirability":{{sfn|Li|Zheng|2001|p=920-921}}
*High officials  (大官)
*Minor officials  (小官)
*Buddhist monks  (釋)
*Daoist priests  (道)
*Physicians  (医)
*Peasants  (農)
*Hunters  (獵)
*Courtesans  (妓)
*Confucian scholars  (儒)
*Beggars  (丐)

The Yuan rulers were [[Mongols]] and were viewed as barbaric and humiliating for the Han Chinese,{{sfn|Li|Zheng|2001|p=920-927}} although they did not last long in China (from 1271 to 1368).

===Ming Dynasty===
In 1368, Zhu Yuanzhang proclaimed the [[Ming dynasty]] and issued a long manifesto, in which he labeled the Yuan as barbarians who had usurped the Chinese throne, and who had inflicted atrocities such as rape and murder. He lists incidents where the Mongols massacred men in entire villages and appropriated the women. Zhu's northern military expedition had been a success; Beijing was captured in the same year and China was again governed by Han.{{sfn|Li|Zheng|2001|p=920–924}}

Although the Ming referred to the preceding Yuan as "胡元", or wild Yuan, they also accepted the Yuan before them as a legitimate dynasty. Zhu Yuanzhang indicated on another occasion that he was happy to be born in the Yuan period and that the Yuan did legitimately receive the Mandate of Heaven to rule over China. In addition, one of his key advisors, Liu Ji, generally supported the idea that while the Chinese and the non-Chinese are different, they are actually equal. Liu was therefore arguing against the idea that Hua was and is superior to Yi.&lt;ref&gt;Zhou Songfang, "Lun Liu Ji de Yimin Xintai" (On Liu Ji's Mentality as a Dweller of Subjugated Empire) in ''Xueshu Yanjiu'' no.4 (2005), 112–117.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Miao Rebellions (Ming dynasty)|Miao Rebellions]], Ming forces engaged in massive slaughter of the [[Hmong people|Hmong]] and other native ethnic groups in [[South China]]; after castrating Hmong boys to use as [[eunuch]] slaves, Chinese soldiers took Hmong women as wives and colonized the southern provinces.{{sfn|Tsai|1996|p=16}}{{sfn|Schein|2000|p=61}}{{sfn|Mote|Twitchett|King|1988|p=380}}{{sfn|Bowman|2000|p=43}}

Towards the end of the Ming dynasty, Ming loyalists invoked Hua-Yi zhi bian to urge the Chinese to resist the [[Manchu people|Manchu]] invaders.{{sfn|Li|Zheng|2001|p=1018–1032}}

===Qing dynasty===
The [[Qing dynasty]]'s order that all subjects shave their forehead and braid the rest of their hair into a [[Queue (hairstyle)|queue]] was viewed as a symbolic gesture of servitude by many Han Chinese, who thought that changing their dress to the same as Yi would be contrary to the spirit of "Hua-Yi zhi bian."

Scholar [[Lü Liuliang]] (1629–1683), who lived through the transition between the Ming and the Manchu-led [[Qing dynasty]], refused to serve the new dynasty because he claimed that upholding the difference between Huaxia and the Yi was more important than respecting the righteous bond between minister (臣) and sovereign (君王). In 1728, failed [[Imperial examination]] candidate Zeng Jing (曾靜), influenced by Lü's works, called for the overthrow of the Manchu regime. The [[Yongzheng Emperor]] (r. 1723–1735), whom Zeng accused of ten major crimes, took this event as an opportunity to educate the Qing's Chinese subjects. In a series of discussions with Zeng Jing, the emperor proclaimed that Chinese were not inherently superior to the barbarians. To justify his statements, he declared that King Wen, the sage king and the founder of the Zhou dynasty, was of Western Yi origin, but this did not hurt his greatness.

The [[Yongzheng Emperor]] also borrowed from Han Yu, indicating that Yi can become Hua and vice versa. In addition, according to Yongzheng, both Hua and Yi were now a part of the same family under the Qing. One of the goals of the tract ''Dayi juemi lu'' (大義覺迷錄), which the Yongzheng Emperor published and distributed throughout the empire in 1730, was "to undermine the credibility of the hua/yi distinction."&lt;ref name="Liu 84"&gt;{{harvnb||Liu|2004|p=84}}. Lü's original sentence was "Hua yi zhi fen da yu jun chen zhi yi" 華夷之分，大於君臣之義.&lt;/ref&gt; However, due to the fact that this tract also helped to expose many unsavory aspects of court life and political intrigues in the imperial government, Yongzheng’s successor the [[Qianlong Emperor]] (r. 1736–1796) recalled the tracts and had them burned for the fear that it would undermine the legitimacy of the Qing empire.

During the Qing, the Qing destroyed writings that criticized the Liao, Jin and Yuan using the Hua–Yi distinction.{{clarify|date=November 2011}}

[[Sun Yat-sen]] also used the Hua–Yi distinction to justify the overthrow of the Qing dynasty.{{sfn|Li|Zheng|2001}}

However, the Qing adopted Confucian philosophy and Han Chinese institutions to show that the Manchu rulers had received the Mandate of Heaven, while at the same time trying to retain their own indigenous culture.{{sfn|Fairbank|1998|pp=146–149}} Due to the Manchus' adoption of Han Chinese culture, most Han Chinese (though not all) accepted the Manchus as the legitimate rulers.

===Republic of China===
Historian [[Frank Dikötter]] (1990:420) says the Chinese "idea of 'race' (''zhong'' [種], "seed", "species", "race") started to dominate the intellectual scene" in the late 19th-century Qing dynasty and completed the "transition from cultural exclusiveness to racial exclusiveness in modern China" in the 1920s.{{sfn|Dikötter|1994|p=420}}

Following the overthrow of the Qing, Sun Yat-sen allegedly went to the grave of Zhu Yuanzhang and told him that the Huaxia had been restored and the barbarians overthrown.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} However, after the [[Republic of China (1912–49)|Republic of China]] revolution, Sun also advocated that all ethnic groups in China were part of the Chinese family.

===People's Republic of China===
The [[China|PRC]] did not abide by the concept of "Hua Yi zhi bian" and recognized the Liao Jin Yuan and Qing as legitimate dynasties. Initially, the [[Communist Party of China|CPC]] condemned all Chinese dynasties as "feudal oppressors".

Hua-Yi zhi bian has little practical and real significance in twenty-first century China.&lt;ref&gt;Li Bo and Zheng Yin (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the second [[Mongol invasions of Japan|Mongol invasion of Japan]] in 1281, Mongols attacked Japan with two forces of 142,000 soldiers and sailors including 100,000 Chinese ([[Song dynasty#Southern Song, 1127–1279|Southern Song]]) and 9,960 Korean. This attempt of invading  Japan ended in failure after defensive warfare by the Japanese army and a massive typhoon which hit the battle field for two days and destroyed the Mongol fleet. During the battle the Japanese army took 20,000 to 30,000 prisoners out of Mongol fleet. According to a Chinese historical text ({{ill|元史|zh}}) Japan executed Mongol, Korean and Han Chinese prisoners but spared Southern Song Chinese and kept them as slaves because of the past friendly relationship of Japan and Southern Song. &lt;ref&gt;『元史』巻二百八 列傳第九十五 外夷一 日本國「（至元十八年）官軍六月入海、七月至平壷島（平戸島）、移五龍山（鷹島か）、八月一日、風破舟、五日、文虎等諸將各自擇堅好船乘之、棄士卒十餘萬于山下、衆議推張百戸者爲主帥、號之曰張總管、聽其約束、方伐木作舟欲還、七日日本人來戰、盡死、餘二三萬爲其虜去、九日、至八角島、盡殺蒙古、高麗、漢人、謂新附軍爲唐人、不殺而奴之、閶輩是也、蓋行省官議事不相下、故皆棄軍歸、久之、莫靑與呉萬五者亦逃還、十萬之衆得還者三人耳。」&lt;/ref&gt; According to  a Korean historical text ({{ill|高麗史|zh}}), it is described that spared prisoners were artisans or those with agricultural  knowledge. &lt;ref&gt;『高麗史』巻二十九 世家二十九 忠烈王二 忠烈王八年六月己丑（一日）「蠻軍把總沈聰等六人、自白本逃來言、本明州人、至元十八年六月十八日、従葛剌歹萬戸上船至日本、値悪風船敗、衆軍十三四萬、同栖一山、十月初八日、日本軍至、我軍飢不能戰、皆降日本、擇留工匠及知田者、餘皆殺之、王遣上將軍印侯郎將柳庇、押聰等送干元。/（八月）甲午（九日）、蠻軍五人、自日本逃來」&lt;/ref&gt; 
10,000 Southern Song Chinese were spared. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.republicanchina.org/yuan.html "Khubilai Khan and Yuan Dynasty (AD 1261–1368)"] republicanchina.org. Retrieved 11Jan 2009&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some Japanese philosophers, like the neo-Confucianists [[Yamaga Sokō]] and [[Aizawa Seishisai]] claimed that Japan was 中國 Chūgoku instead of China.

Following the 1644 Manchu conquest, [[Joseon]] Koreans began to refer to themselves as ''[[Sojunghwa]]'' "Little China" ({{Korean|hangul=소중화|hanja=小中華}}). As the Joseon supported the Ming, they were reported to have extended a friendliness to the Ming that they did not display to the Qing dynasty.

This sentiment was in large part due to the fact that Jurchens were descended from Mohe people, who were once subjects of Korean kingdoms of Goguryeo and Balhae. In addition, Jurchens were widely recognized as barbarians, as Jurchen tribes have been raiding and pillaging the northern border regions of Korean Goryeo and Joseon kingdoms for centuries. This sentiment did not disappear even after Qing completed sinicization.

Because Korea had been closely tied to Han Chinese "barbarianism ruling China" became a major issue for discussion there.

As the Ming dynasty fell, Korea was worried about its own security. This was due to previous instances in which Ming China aided Korea such as in the [[Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–98)#Intervention of Ming China|Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–98)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ch 12 - Japanese Invasions|url=http://koreanhistoryproject.org/Ket/C12/E1204.htm |accessdate=January 12, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090403230844/http://www.koreanhistoryproject.org/Ket/C12/E1204.htm |archivedate=April 3, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Long after the establishment of the Qing dynasty, the Joseon ruling elite and even the Joseon government continued to use the [[Chongzhen Emperor]]'s [[Chinese era name|era name]] ({{Korean|hangul=숭정기원|hanja=崇禎紀元}}) of the last Ming emperor.{{sfn|Haboush|2005|pp=131–32}} In private they referred to the Manchu Emperor as the "barbarian ruler" and Qing ambassadors as "barbarian ambassadors".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://ido.thethirdmedia.com/article/frame.aspx?turl=http%3a//ido.3mt.com.cn/article/200901/show1260552c17p1.ibod&amp;rurl=&amp;title=%u671D%u9C9C%u7687%u5BA4%u7684%u201C%u53CD%u6E05%u590D%u660E%u201D%u8BA1%u5212%uFF1A%u4E3A%u62A5%u63F4%u671D%u6297%u65E5%u4E4B%u6069%28%u56FE%29_%u671D%u9C9C%u7687%u5BA4%u66FE%u60F3%u201C%u53CD%u6E05%u590D%u660E%u201D%20%u6697%u5730%u6269%u5145%u519B%u961F%20---%20ido.3mt.com.cn|title=In Chinese:朝鲜皇室的"反清复明"计划：为报援朝抗日之恩|date=2009-01-24|publisher=ido.3mt.com.cn|accessdate=2009-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; These feelings could not be expressed as the "barbarians" held great power over Korea following their successful invasion in the [[Later Jin invasion of Joseon]] in 1627 and the [[Qing invasion of Joseon]] of 1637.

Over time the Qing government exerted more power over Korea. This would eventually turn Korea into a [[hermit kingdom]] to limit foreign influence

The [[Ryukyu Kingdom]] was heavily influenced by Chinese culture, taking language, architecture, and court practices from China.{{sfn|Kerr|1957}} It also paid annual tribute to first the Ming and later Qing courts from 1374 until 1874.

Vietnamese dynasties considered themselves ''Hua'', in the sense that their nation was civilized, and their kingdom as a polity was at the center of Earth and Heaven.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} Even with regard to [[China proper]], Vietnamese dynasties competed for primacy, adopting the same descriptive term, "central state" (''Trung Quốc'' 中國), while Chinese were "outsiders".{{sfn|Trần|2013|p=25}} For example, Emperor [[Gia Long]] used ''Trung Quốc'' as a name for Vietnam in 1805.&lt;ref name="Woodside1971"&gt;{{cite book|author=Alexander Woodside|title=Vietnam and the Chinese Model: A Comparative Study of Vietnamese and Chinese Government in the First Half of the Nineteenth Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0LgSI9UQNpwC&amp;pg=PA18#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|year=1971|publisher=Harvard Univ Asia Center|isbn=978-0-674-93721-5|pages=18–}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cambodia]] was regularly called ''Cao Man'', the country of "upper barbarians".{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

'''[[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]]''' is a source, transit, and destination country for women and children subjected to [[Human trafficking|trafficking in persons]], specifically [[forced prostitution]] and [[forced labor]]. Macedonian women and children are trafficked internally within the country. Women and girls from [[Albania]], [[Bulgaria]] and [[Kosovo]] were reportedly subjected to forced prostitution or forced labor in Macedonia in 2009. Macedonian victims and victims transiting through Macedonia are subjected to forced prostitution or forced labor in [[Central Europe|South Central]] and [[Western Europe]]. Children, primarily ethnic [[Romani people|Roma]], are subjected to forced begging by their parents or other relatives. Girls were subjected to conditions of forced labor in Macedonian bars and nightclubs. A small number of Macedonian men were allegedly subjected to forced labor in [[Azerbaijan]]. Traffickers continued to operate in more hidden, private sectors in an attempt to conceal their exploitation of victims from law enforcement.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

The [[Government of Macedonia]] does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so. The government continued to strengthen its anti-trafficking framework and issued its first annual [[National Rapporteur]]’s report on trafficking. The government did not convict any trafficking offenders, identified fewer official trafficking victims, and did not provide funding to [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]]s for the care and assistance of foreign and domestic trafficking victims in Macedonia. The government did not prosecute any officials for trafficking specific crimes, but took significant steps in fighting trafficking-related corruption.&lt;ref name=dos&gt;"Macedonia". [https://www.state.gov/g/tip/rls/tiprpt/2010/142760.htm ''Trafficking in Persons Report 2010'']. [[U.S. Department of State]] (June 14, 2010). {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. State Department's [[Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons]] placed the country in [[Trafficking in Persons Report#Ranking System|"Tier 2"]]  in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/2017/271117.htm|title=Trafficking in Persons Report 2017: Tier Placements|website=www.state.gov|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prosecution==
The Government of Macedonia made limited progress in its law enforcement response to human trafficking during the reporting period. The government prohibits sex and labor trafficking through Article 418(a) and (d) of its 2004 criminal code.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Macedonia Criminal Code|url=http://www.protectionproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/Macedonia_Criminal-CodeTIP_2004.pdf|accessdate=30 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2009, the government arrested 18 suspects for trafficking- related offenses and opened investigations of seven trafficking cases, of which five are ongoing. In the other two cases, the [[public prosecutor]] indicted and began prosecution in 2009. The government did not convict any trafficking offenders during the reporting period. In September 2009, the government adopted amendments to its criminal code that require a minimum sentence of eight years’ imprisonment for any public official convicted of a trafficking offense committed while in the course of official duty. The government investigated and prosecuted [[corruption]] in certain sectors of law enforcement, which posed challenges to anti-trafficking and anti-smuggling efforts during the reporting period. The government reported evidence of immigration officials’ [[fake document|forging residency documents]] of potential trafficking victims in 2009. The government did not prosecute or convict any officials for complicity specific to trafficking during the reporting period; however, it convicted 60 [[border police]] for soliciting bribes and, in a separate case, convicted one official of [[people smuggling|smuggling migrants]] in 2009.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

==Protection==
The Government of Macedonia did not demonstrate sufficient progress in protecting trafficking victims in 2009. Macedonia’s victim identification procedures require that first-line responders liberally identify people, such as illegal migrants and foreign women and girls in [[prostitution]], as potential victims until they can be formally vetted by a trained anti-trafficking authority. Of the 157 potential trafficking victims identified by authorities in 2009, seven were confirmed as trafficking victims; all were children. Eighteen victims were identified in 2008. With [[International Organization for Migration|IOM]] assistance, the government organized a series of trainings reaching 280 front-line responders on proactive victim identification. These trainings were funded with the government’s [[European Union|EU]] pre-accession funds, earmarked for trafficking. Additionally, in conjunction with the [[OSCE]], the government trained all of the country’s labor inspectors on proactive victim identification in the labor sector. [[Law enforcement in the Republic of Macedonia|Macedonian law]] exempts victims from criminal prosecution for unlawful acts committed as a direct result of being trafficked. While the government’s standard operating procedures mandate a multi-disciplinary approach to identifying victims, NGOs and international organizations should be more systematically included in this process. The government continued to fund and operate a transit center for foreign migrants and trafficking victims with the help of a local NGO that specializes in victim rehabilitation, especially children. The government provided in-kind contributions to the NGO assisting foreign victims in this center. All potential victims are offered a two-month reflection period during which time they are offered victim assistance services, regardless of whether they choose to testify for the state. At any time during the reflection period, if they decide to cooperate with authorities in the investigation of the crime, an additional six-month residency permit can be granted. As an undocumented foreigner, until a foreign trafficking victim receives a legal residency status, his or her movement is restricted to within the shelter. During the reporting period, one foreign victim stayed in the transit center under the reflection period. No foreign victims to date have requested the six-month residency permit.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

The largest Macedonian NGO providing protection and assistance to domestic trafficking victims continued to rely primarily on international donors to provide victims with both immediate and long-term comprehensive services for their rehabilitation and reintegration. Victims also received reintegration support from Macedonia’s 30 social welfare centers located throughout the country. The government provided significant funding to these centers, which are not focused exclusively on helping trafficking victims and, according to NGOs, lack the capacity to fully address the complex and comprehensive needs of domestic trafficking victims. These centers assisted seven trafficking victims in 2009, the same number assisted in 2008. Aware of this problem, the government is in the process of refurbishing a domestic shelter that will house domestic victims of trafficking. In 2009, the [[Ministry of Labor and Social Policy]] succeeded in obtaining funding from the national budget for operation of a domestic shelter.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

Although the government drafted legislation to ensure that domestic trafficking victims receive [[free healthcare]], a lack of implementation of this provision resulted in an NGO paying for some victims’ emergency medical care in 2009. During the reporting period, the government took over complete financial responsibility for the [[National Referral Mechanism Office]], a coordinating body responsible for monitoring victim identification, referral, assistance, and legal processes. Macedonian law provides legal alternatives to the removal of foreign victims to countries where they may face retribution or hardship through both a two-month reflection period and a six-month residency permit. The government encouraged victims to participate in the prosecution of their traffickers; it reported that three victims provided witness testimony in courts and three assisted in law enforcement investigations in 2009. Reportedly, one of the reasons victims do not report their traffickers is because the traffickers tell the victims they have connections with the police.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

==Prevention==
The Government of Macedonia made progress in its anti-trafficking prevention efforts. In January 2010, the government’s newly appointed National Rapporteur published Macedonia’s first annual report on trafficking, which also covered migrant smuggling. The report was presented to the stakeholders, the international community, and NGOs for comment, but the final product lacked a comprehensive assessment of anti-trafficking efforts in Macedonia and contained cursory recommendations for improvement. The government continued to rely on NGOs and international organizations to assist in conducting many of its anti-trafficking prevention programs; it forged partnerships with NGOs to distribute general anti-trafficking leaflets in specified locations and schools throughout 2009. It also translated IOM’s “Buy Responsibly” campaign and in November 2009 began broadcasting it over state television as part of a campaign to target client demand for products potentially resulting from labor trafficking. The government continued seminars in the [[University of Skopje]] and collaborated with another NGO on a series of workshops that addressed client demand for victims of sex trafficking. It also provided $1,000 to an NGO to conduct trafficking prevention lectures to youth around the country in 2009. In September 2009, the government formally adopted its 2009-2012 [[National Action Plan]] on trafficking, and for the first time budgeted specific funding for the plan’s implementation.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

[[Image:Kiliwa map.png|right]]
The '''Kiliwa''' ([[Kiliwa language|Kiliwa]]: '''K'olew''') are an [[indigenous people of Mexico]] living in northern [[Baja California]]. Historically they occupied a territory lying between the [[Cochimí]] on the south and the [[Paipai]] on the north, and extending from [[San Felipe, Baja California|San Felipe]] on the [[Gulf of California]] to [[San Quintín, Baja California|San Quintín]] on the Pacific coast. Their traditional language is the [[Kiliwa language]].

The [[Ñakipa]] have sometimes been distinguished from the Kiliwa as a separate ethnolinguistic group within the southwestern portion of what is here considered Kiliwa territory. The limited linguistic evidence that is available for the Ñakipa indicates that they spoke the same language as the eastern Kiliwa.

==Prehistory==
Little archaeological research has as yet been done within Kiliwa territory. A partial exception is a sampling program of systematic survey along the west coast between El Rosario and San Quintín by Jerry D. Moore.

Radiocarbon dates and [[Clovis point]]s from farther south on the peninsula suggest that the initial occupation to the north must have occurred prior to 11,000 years ago.

==History==
The Kiliwa first encountered Europeans when [[Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo]] reached the San Quintín area in 1542. There were few subsequent contacts during the next two centuries. The [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] missionary-explorer [[Wenceslaus Linck]] came overland from the south into the eastern part of Kiliwa territory in 1766. The expedition to establish Spanish settlements in California, led by [[Gaspar de Portolà]] and [[Junípero Serra]] passed through the western portions.

The [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] mission of [[Misión Santo Domingo de la Frontera|Santo Domingo]] was founded in Kiliwa territory near the coast in 1775. It was followed by an inland mission of [[Misión San Pedro Mártir de Verona|San Pedro Mártir]] in 1794. By around the time of Mexican independence in 1821, the population at the Kiliwa missions had sharply declined.

In 1929, Meigs reported that only 36 adult Kiliwa were then living, primarily at three settlements around Arroyo León, at San Isidoro, and in Valle Trinidad. Twenty years later in 1949, Hohenthal found 30 adult Kiliwa living at four settlements, including Arroyo León, Agua Caliente, La Parra, and Tepí.

==Population==
Meigs suggested that the aboriginal population of the Kiliwa was about 1,300 individuals, or a density of about 0.3 persons per square kilometer. He excluded the southwestern "Ñakipa" territory from his estimates, which would raise the total to at least 2,000. Meigs considered his estimate to be a "conservative" one. However, Roger C. Owen has argued that Meigs' population estimates were substantially too high.

==Culture==
Information about the cultural practices of the pre-contact Kiliwa comes from a variety of sources. These include accounts of early explorers, such as [[Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo]] and [[Sebastián Vizcaíno]]; from late eighteenth and early nineteenth century observers, such as [[Luis Sales]] and [[José Longinos Martínez]]; and from twentieth century ethnographers, including [[Peveril Meigs]], William D. Hohenthal, and Jesús Ángel Ochoa Zazueta.

===Subsistence===
Aboriginal Kiliwa subsistence was based on hunting and gathering of natural animal and plants rather than on agriculture. At least two dozen different plants were food resources, and many others were used for medicine or as materials for construction or craft products. Pit-roasted ''[[Agave]]'' (mescal; ''ječà'') was the most important plant food. In the fall season, harvesting of acorns and pine nuts from the higher-elevation portions of Kiliwa territory was a major activity.

Rabbits and deer were the most important animal food sources, but a wide range of others were also hunted, including pronghorn antelope, bighorn sheep, medium-sized mammals such as mountain lions, many small mammal species, birds, reptiles, fish, and shellfish. Jackrabbits and quail were hunted communally, by being driven into nets. Treks were made to San Felipe on the east coast to harvest fish and shellfish and to collect salt.

Crop growing and stock raising were introduced during the historic period. Another highly valued food resource that was introduced during the historic period was wild honey.

===Material culture===
The traditional material culture of the Kiliwa was not highly elaborate, as would be expected for a seasonally mobile group.

* '''Structures''' included semi-subterranean houses with willow poles and thatching, ramadas, and sweat houses.
* '''Hunting equipment''' included willow bows; arrows with carrizo reed shafts, wooden foreshafts, and stone points; wooden throwing sticks; and agave fiber nets.
* '''Processing equipment''' included manos and metates for grinding seeds, wooden drills and hearths for making fire, and pottery and basketry for cooking, storing, and transporting.
* '''Clothing''' was generally lacking for men. Women wore deer hide aprons and reed caps. Both sexes wore agave fiber sandals. Rabbitskin blankets provided warmth, and human hair capes were used in ceremonies. Cradles were used to transport infants.

===Social organization===
Traditional leadership roles in communities and kin groups were held on a hereditary basis, but subject to an assessment of the individual leader's competence. Leaders' authority does not seem to have been extensive.

Kinship and community membership seems to have been defined to a large extent on the basis of [[Patrilineality|patrilineal inheritance]]. Two levels of patrilineages (or clans, sibs) were recognized, corresponding to the ''šimułs'' of other western Yuman groups. ''Maselkwa'' were the smaller, more strongly localized groups. Several ''maselkwa'' might collectively constitute an ''ichiupu''. On the broadest level, all Kiliwa were believed to be descended from four mythic brothers, the sons of the creator.

Social recreations included a variety of games: racing with balls, shinny, top spinning, archery, dice, a guessing game, and, most importantly, peón. Music was produced by singing and by instruments, including flutes, rattles, clappers, and bullroarers.

===Ceremonies===
Shamans were believed to be able to effect magical cures of disease or injuries, or to cause them. They presided at some religious ceremonies, and they were thought to transform themselves into animals or birds and to bring rain.

Most documented Kiliwa ceremonies were linked to rites of passage in the lives of individuals:

* '''Birth''' involved various taboos or special requirements, but it was primarily a private family matter. The father observed a [[couvade]].
* '''Boys' initiation''' for groups of boys aged around 15 years was marked by the nose-piercing ceremony (''mipípŭsá'') and other activities extending over two months.
* '''Girls' initiation''' at the time of first menstruation involved being baked in ashes for five days, washed in cold water for five days, and made to observe various prescriptions and taboos.
* '''Marriage''' involved little ceremony, other than the groom giving gifts to the bride's parents. Marrying up to two wives was permitted, and divorce was easy for either party.
* '''Death''' was the focus of the most elaborate Kiliwa ceremonies, occurring both immediately after an individual's death and as subsequent collective mourning observances. Talking to the dead and burning his possessions are among the formal actions.

===Traditional narratives===
Traditional narratives are conventionally classed as myths, legends, tales, and oral histories. The oral literature recorded for the Kiliwa includes narratives that can be assigned to each of these categories.

The Kiliwa creation myth conspicuously diverges from those of the other Yuman-speaking groups. However, the Kiliwa name for the creator, Metipá, recalls similar figures in other Yuman myths.

== Languages having the status of ethnic minority's language ==
*[[Karaim language|Karaim]]
*[[Kashubian language|Kashubian]]
*[[Rusyn language|Rusyn]], called '''Lemko''' in Poland - in Polish: "Łemkowski", see [[Lemkos#Language]]
*[[Romani languages]]: official recognition is granted to the languages of two groups: [[Polska Roma]] and [[Bergitka Roma]].&lt;ref&gt;According to [[Ethnologue]] the following Romani languages are spoken in Poland: [[Vlax Romani language|Romani Vlax]], [[North Central Romani|Romani Carpathian]], [[Sinte Romani|Romani Sinte]], [[Romani language|Baltic Romani]].

*[[Tatar language|Tatar]], called '''Tartar''' by the Act

The official recognition gives to the representatives of the minority certain rights (under certain conditions prescribed by the laws): of education in their language, of having the language established as the secondary administrative language or help language in their [[Bilingual communes in Poland|municipalities]], of financial support of the state to the promotion of their language and culture etc.

== Languages without officially recognised status ==

*[[Wymysorys language|Wymysorys]] - is an [[endangered language]] with very few speakers, native to [[Wilamowice]], but contrary to Karaim language having a similar situation, it was practically unknown of in the time of preparation of the forementioned Act.
*[[Silesian language|Silesian]] - status severely disputed, question whether a dialect of Polish or separate language considered a political issue. [[Ethnologue]] distinguishes ''Silesian'' language and ''Upper Silesian'' dialect of Polish language.

== Languages of new diasporas and immigrant communities ==
These languages are not recognised as minority languages, as the Act of 2005 defines minority as "a group of Polish citizens (...) striving to preserve its language, culture or tradition, (...) whose ancestors have been living on the present territory of the Republic of Poland for at least 100 years":

*[[Greek language|Greek]] - language of the big Greek diaspora in Poland of 1950's. 
*[[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] - the biggest immigrant community in Poland, since 1960's, having their own newspapers, schools, churches etc.

== Dead and artificial languages ==
Among languages used in Poland, Ethnologue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_country.asp?name=PL ''Ethnologue. Languages of the World'', Ethnologue report for Poland]&lt;/ref&gt; mentions also:
*one [[constructed language]] - the International Auxiliary Language [[Esperanto]] (created in Poland), 
*one [[dead language]] - [[Prussian language|Prussian]],

but does not mention two other known defunct languages:

*[[Slovincian language]] - dialects of the [[Pomeranian language]], dead about the beginning of the 20th century, closely related to Kashubian, 
*[[Yatvingian language|Yatvingian]], dead about mid-16th (or maybe end of 19th century).

The '''Lega people''' (or Warega) are an ethnic group of the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]].
In 1998 their population was about 250,000.{{sfn|Lega Information}}

==Location==
By the 1970s the Lega people were mostly living in the middle and upper [[Elila River|Elila]] valley and the upper [[Ulindi River]] valley.{{sfn|Biebuyck|1973|p=3}}
These rivers both rise in the east of [[South Kivu]] and flow in a northwesterly direction through [[Maniema]], joining the Lualaba downstream from [[Kindu]].{{sfn|Blaes|2008}}
The upper Ulindi valley has a richly diverse fauna, including many monkey species, chimpanzees, leopards, buffaloes, elephants and antelopes.{{sfn|Biebuyck|1973|p=5}}
The valley is administratively divided into the [[Mwenga Territory|Mwenga]] and [[Shabunda Territory|Shabunda]]  territories of [[South Kivu]] Province and the [[Pangi Territory]] of [[Maniema Province]].{{sfn|Biebuyck|1973|p=3}}

The territory is covered by deep rain forest and, in the east, rugged mountains rising to {{convert|6000|ft|m}} or more.
The climate is hot and humid year round. Average temperature is {{convert|75|°F|°C}} to {{convert|80|°F|°C}}. Annual rainfall is {{convert|60|in|mm}} to {{convert|80|in|mm}}.
The mountains hold areas of moist woodlands as well as montane forest and grasslands. To the north and west the forest is denser and deeper. The south of the region holds mosaics of forest savannah and woodlands. All of the forest has long been inhabited by humans, who have cleared land for cultivation, then let it return to the wild. In some places the forest has not grown back but has been replaced by grassland. The forest has many plants and trees that provide food and are used for other purposes, and has abundant wildlife.{{sfn|Biebuyck|1973|p=15}}

==Social structure==
[[File:WLA ima Lega People ivory necklace.jpg|thumb|This necklace may have been part of the jewelry belonging to the Bwami religious and social organization. It is made of [[elephant ivory]]]]

The Lega people traditionally live in small village groups, with no central authority.{{sfn|Lega Bwami masks}}
Within a community, a chief inherits his position on a patrilineal basis, and his close relatives have highest rank.{{sfn|Lega Information}}
Counterbalancing this hereditary structure, the Bwami society also regulates social and political life.
This society has seven levels for men and four for women and is open to all.
An initiate advances through the ranks through a complex system of instruction, payment and initiation, achieving increasing status.
A member of the highest level is recognized as a Kindi, a social leader with great [[moral authority]].{{sfn|Lega Bwami masks}}

The Lega people are polytheistic. Their gods include Kalaga, the promiser; Kenkunga, the reassembler; Ombe, the hidden; Kaginga, the incarnation of evil.
Kaginga assists sorcerers, but Bwami membership can protect an individual against the evil doings of witches.{{sfn|Lega Information}}

==History==

The Lega people originated in what is today Uganda, and started to migrate from there to their present location in the 16th century.
They were fierce warriors, conquering the people whose territory they entered and imposing many of their customs.{{sfn|Lega Information}}
By the mid-1800s the Lega were surrounded by Arab / Swahili slave posts. Although none of these posts was within the Lega territory, they were constantly threatened by slave raids. For most of the period of the [[Congo Free State]], the Lega territory was within the area that [[Tippu Tip]] and his successors had reserved.
For a period two Arab agents of the Free State, Munie Chabodu and Munie Mtoro, ruled the Lega and collected tribute in the form of rubber and ivory. They established towns at [[Micici]] on the Elila, [[Shabunda]] on the Ulindi and [[Mulungu, Democratic Republic of the Congo|Mulungu]] in the mountains.{{sfn|Biebuyck|1973|pp=12-13}}

During the 1890s the Belgians fought a series of campaigns in which they drove away the Arab slavers, and established government posts near Micici and Shabunda. They did not fully occupy the territory until the 1900s. They organized the Lega into chiefdoms, sectors and territories, changes that were neither resisted nor welcomed by the Lega. Catholic missionaries arrived in the 1910s and the first Protestant mission was founded in 1922 in Shabunda.{{sfn|Biebuyck|1973|p=13}}
Mining began in eastern Legaland in 1923, with further mines opened in the 1930s, employing many young Lega.  Often they took a job only for a short period to earn enough money for some purpose such as Bwami initiation or marriage.{{sfn|Biebuyck|1973|p=14}}

In 1933 the Belgian authorities banned Bwami, and they prohibited the society again in 1948.{{sfn|Major Exhibition}}
The Bwami continued underground and was officially recognized again in 1958, but by then much of the tradition of art production had been lost.
Zaire became independent in 1960. The regime of [[Mobutu Sese Seko]] was harsh and corrupt, and Mobutu was eventually ousted in the [[First Congo War]] (1996-1997). This was soon followed by the [[Second Congo War]] (1998-2003) in which rebels attempted to throw out his successor, [[Laurent-Désiré Kabila]].
The Lega territory was the scene of many violent conflicts during this period.{{sfn|Grootaers|2003}}

==Economy==

The Lega traditionally lived by hunting and gathering, exploiting the rich resources of the forest.{{sfn|Biebuyck|1973|p=14}}
When possible, they roast their food. The women are in charge of cooking. If it is not raining they will cook outside on a hearth formed from slow-burning logs that support a pot over the fire. In poor weather they cook in kitchens within the long houses.
The men eat as a group in the men's house, and the women eat with the young children in or outside the kitchen.{{sfn|Elisofon|1967}}

The Lega villagers were forced by the colonial administration to produce manioc, bananas, and rice to feed the miners, causing considerable disruption to their lifestyle.{{sfn|Biebuyck|1973|p=14}}
In more recent years the Lega have taken to panning for gold in the rivers and working in the iron ore mines of the region.{{sfn|Lega Information}}

==Art==

Bwami masks and figures are symbols of the owner's rank within the Bwami society.{{sfn|Lega Bwami masks}}
The objects represent moral or social values, and are used during initiation rites.{{sfn|Grootaers|2002}}
The Bwami works of art are often associated with proverbs, and these proverbs in conjunction with dance, poetry and song give wisdom to members of the society. Beauty, knowledge and power are intertwined.{{sfn|Major Exhibition}}

Some artwork can only be seen, handled or owned by the highest grades of the society.
The objects are typically small and simple in form, and have a striking patina that derives from being handled or worn on the body.
Ivory objects usually have russet or yellow patinas.{{sfn|Grootaers|2002}}
The masks are fairly standardized,  although the most important masks with special ritual use or symbolic meaning may have distinctive design. A typical mask will have a concave heart-shaped face.
The forehead protrudes slightly, the nose is narrow, eyes are slits and the mouth is slightly open.
Every time a mask is used it is rubbed with white clay, over time acquiring a white patina.{{sfn|Lega Bwami masks}}

*[[Durin's Day]] - Dwarven equivalent of [[New Years Day]]. The secret entrance to the [[Lonely Mountain]] becomes visible. - ''[[The Hobbit]]''
*Weasel Stomping Day - Day in unnamed fictional town that celebrated when every one spreads mayonnaise on the lawn, puts on Viking helmets and boots, then proceeds to kill [[weasels]] by stepping on them - [["Weird Al" Yankovic]] song of the same name, also ''[[Robot Chicken]]''.
*[[Whacking Day]] - The day (May 10) where everybody beats [[snakes]] to death with clubs - ''[[The Simpsons]]''
*[[Hogswatch]] in Wincanton Somerset England ''[[Discworld]]. 
*[[Decemberween]] - Fictionalized Christmas-Halloween hybrid, celebrated on December 25 - ''[[Homestar Runner]]''
*Freedom Day - Counterpart of American [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]] celebrated in 3000's Earth, with the saying ''If you wanna do something, you do it, and to spleckh with the consequences''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gotfuturama.com/Information/Encyc-151-Freedom_Day/ Futurama Encyclopedia]&lt;/ref&gt; - ''[[Futurama]]''
*Emperor's Day - Similar to [[Christmas]], gifts are placed in bowls rather than stockings. - ''[[Warhammer 40,000]]''
*Winter Veil - Celebrated on December 25, it is the [[Warcraft#Azeroth|Azerothian]] equivalent of Christmas - ''[[Warcraft]]''
*Harry Potter Day, the day that Harry Potter defeated an evil wizard in the [[Harry Potter]] books. This day is actually Halloween, and referred as such in all the books.
*Black Drinking Day - An [[African-American]] day, (October 7, started in 2009) dedicated to drinking alcoholic beverages. - ''[[The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien]]''

*Vermintide - Celebrated every 13 years, the Chaos moon is full for 13 days in a row. the Skaven hold many ceremonies dedicated to their patron deity, the Horned Rat. - ''[[Warhammer Fantasy (setting)|Warhammer]]''
*[[Colonial Day]] - Commemorates the signing of the Articles of Colonization which incorporated the [[Twelve Colonies of Man]] during the [[First Cylon War]]. - [[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)|''Battlestar Galactica'' reimagining]]
*[[Team Fortress 2|Australian Christmas]] - [Fictional] Australian Christmas version in ''[[Team Fortress 2]]''. Every December the 17th, children in Australia make weapons and hats for Old Nick, a crotchety old man who lives at the South Pole. After receiving all of his gifts, Old Nick realizes he received many duplicates of gifts, so he sells them off for incredibly low prices!
*[[Sadie Hawkins Day]] - Pseudo-holiday that originated in Al Capp's classic hillbilly comic strip, Li'l Abner (1934–1978). This inspired real-world Sadie Hawkins dances, where girls ask boys out.
* First Contact Day - Commemorating the first contact between humans and Vulcans on 5 April 2063 in ''[[Star Trek]]''
* Federation Day - Second Monday in October (Earth Calendar), Commemorating the founding of the United Federation of Planets on October 9, 2161 in ''[[Star Trek]]''
* Barzzle Snurfing Day - Holiday originating in the [[Facebook]] community that celebrates the first internet meme to waste an entire day's productivity being forwarded among co-workers. Since no one knows exactly when this was, the holiday is declared randomly each year by the same committee that determines when "celebrity look-alike" week and "love your sibling" day are. If a consensus cannot be reached by the fall equinox in the northern hemisphere, the holiday by default falls on the first day after the first full moon in the next month to contain 5 Saturdays (even if that day occurs in the following year).
* Heaven's Day - Essentially Christmas with a different name. Alex Rosewater even states that it's the day God's son was born. - ''[[The Big O]]''

* Unification Day - A celebration of the Alliance's victory over the Browncoats in the Unification War. According to Nathan Fillion, the main actor in ''Firefly'', the holiday is on September 20. - ''[[Firefly (TV series)|Firefly]]''
* Hurling Day - (''[[Dinosaurs (TV series)|Jim Henson's Dinosaurs]]'') Established by a wise but aging dinosaur chief during the days when dinosaurs roamed in tribes, Hurling Day served to prevent elderly tribe members from slowing down the pack, and allowed them to depart the mortal coil with dignity. Thus, upon turning 72, old dinosaurs were to be ceremonially pushed off a cliff by their closest family in a loving and respectful manner. Hurling Day soon became popular, however, as a means by which husbands could finally take revenge on their mothers-in-law. - ''[[Dinosaurs (TV series)|Jim Henson's Dinosaurs]]''
* Clearance Day - A holiday, founded by calendar-maker Clarence von Clearance, similar to Christmas and Thanksgiving where families and friends gather to celebrate commercialism and sales. People celebrate by purchasing gifts for one another, placing them under the Clearance Day anvil, and exchanging whatever survives the weight of the anvil in the morning. Celebrated sometime in August. - ''[[Sheep in the Big City]]''
* The Purge - On March 21st, all crime is legal for 12 hours and government services are shut down. Government officials with "authorization levels" of ranking 10 or higher are granted immunity from the purge Weapons of class 5 or higher, (explosive devices such as grenades, rocket launchers, bazookas, etc., weapons of mass destruction, and viral/biological and chemical agents) is prohibited. - ''[[The Purge (franchise)|The Purge]]''

== Fictional holidays created by characters ==

*Dogbert Day - from ''[[Dilbert (TV series)|Dilbert]]'' animated TV show, created by [[Dogbert]] as a holiday designed to replace all holidays and be incredibly bothersome while doing so. It includes elements from all normal holidays, including big dinners, a parade and "visits from unpleasant relatives", and some that derive from [[Druid]] holidays, such as virgin sacrifice.
*Robanukah - robot holiday made up by Bender as an excuse for not working. The characters later decide to actually celebrate it - by "doing the robot dance", with Jewish-style music playing in the background. - ''[[Futurama]]''
*Do Nothing Day - made up by Nobita who uses one of Doraemon's magical gadgets to declare it. -''[[Doraemon]]''
*Winter-een-mas - a multi-day January holiday invented by Ethan in the ''[[Ctrl+Alt+Del (webcomic)|Ctrl+Alt+Del]]'' webcomic to celebrate video games. Within the webcomic, it turned into a surprise hit and even led to a brief kidnapping plot when a corporation wanted to take advantage of its popularity.
*Scotchtoberfest - pun from [[Oktoberfest]], create by Skinner made up "Scotchtoberfest" as part of a sting to catch Bart in the act of breaking the rules. Finding out that it was in fact not a real holiday did not sit well with Groundskeeper Willie. - ''[[The Simpsons]]''
*[[Merlinpeen]], a festival of mouth pleasure from "[[Secret Santa (30 Rock)|Secret Santa]]" along with fictional religion "Verdukianism" create by Frank, Toofer, and Lutz from ''[[30 Rock]]''  have Kenneth give them things they claim to need for "Merlinpeen," the Verdukian Holiday of Mouth Pleasures (such as three-sausage pizza and having their teeth flossed by a blonde virgin). Their famous holiday song is, "Oh, Meatbowl of Verduke, you bring me such pizza. Meatbowl." When Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) tells Kenneth that they made up their religion, he goes into shock at the idea that all religions are made up by man. - ''[[30 Rock]]''
*[[Leif Erikson]] Day - A holiday made up by SpongeBob shortly after the show's narrator explains that "every day is a holiday for SpongeBob. Even if he has to make one up." It is only acknowledged by SpongeBob, Patrick, and Bubble Buddy and involves dressing up as a Viking and chanting Nordic sounding gibberish. - ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]''
*Annoy Squidward Day - A holiday marked on SpongeBob's calendar. Apparenly involves bothering his neighbor and coworker, Squidward Tentacles, for most of the day. Celebrated on February 15. - ''SpongeBob SquarePants''
*Hive Day, an annual technology release party from HiveTech on September 29, from the book ''[[Hive Propolis]]'' by [[Daniel D.W.]]
Some commentators suggest that fictional holidays, particularly in television shows' Christmas episodes, have become one of the many clichés. Meredith Blake in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' said about Merlinpeen, "here we have yet another Christmas television [[Trope (literature)|trope]]: the goofy, made-up holiday. See also: 'Chrismukkah' or 'Festivus.' It's a favorite device of TV writers, but I'm not sure why."&lt;ref name=Blake&gt;{{cite news|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/showtracker/2009/12/30-rock-.html|title='30 Rock': The most wonderful time of the year?|last=Blake|first=Meredith|date=2009-12-11|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=2009-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{ethnic Macedonians}}

'''Macedonians in Croatia''' refers to the group of [[ethnic Macedonians]] who reside in [[Croatia]]. According to the official census of 2011, there are 4,138 ethnic Macedonians in Croatia.

Macedonians are recognised as an autochthonous national minority, and as such they elect a special representative to the [[Croatian Parliament]], shared with members of four other national minorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.sabor.hr/Default.aspx?art=1874 | language = Croatian | publisher = Croatian Parliament | title = Pravo pripadnika nacionalnih manjina u Republici Hrvatskoj na zastupljenost u Hrvatskom saboru | work = Zakon o izborima zastupnika u Hrvatski sabor | accessdate = 2011-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Migration ==
Macedonians had been migrating to Croatia since the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]]. Early Migration was primarily of Macedonians from a rural background. These migrants have been joined by many newer business migrants who have come to Croatia for the opportunities offered. Many settled in the national capital [[Zagreb]], and the [[Istria County|Istria]] region. Macedonian communities can be also found in larger towns such as [[Osijek]], [[Pula]], and [[Zadar]].

== Culture ==
The main Macedonian cultural association in Croatia is the [[Macedonian Community of Croatia]] ([[Croatian language|Croatian]]: ''Zajednica Makedonaca u Republici Hrvatskoj''). It was founded in 1992 and it branches over six other smaller organisations from the major cities where Macedonians reside.&lt;ref&gt;Makedonci Zagreb-http://makedonci-zagreb.hr/site1/index.php?option=com_frontpage&amp;Itemid=1&lt;/ref&gt; The Cultural associations are as follows; KUD-Ohridski Biser from Zagreb, KUD-Makedonija from [[Split (city)|Split]], KUD-Biljana from [[Zadar]], KUD-Brak Miladinov from [[Osijek]], KUD-Ilinden from [[Rijeka]] and KUD-Kočo Racin from [[Pula]].

The associations encourage traditional Macedonian folklore and customs from the motherland. They also encourage the upkeep of Macedonian heritage, [[Macedonian language|language]] and traditions in Croatia.&lt;ref&gt;ZUMRH-http://zmurh.hr/cms/index.php//&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--[[Image:Organisation-CRO.JPG|250px|thumb|left|Organisation of Macedonian Minority in [[Croatia]]]] --&gt;

== Religion ==
[[Ethnic Macedonians|Macedonians]] in [[Croatia]] are predominantly adherents to the [[Macedonian Orthodox Church]] . There are four organised church communities which are abbreviated to the MPCO ({{lang-mk|italic=yes|Makedonska Pravoslavna Crkovna Opština}}).&lt;ref&gt;MPCO-http://www.mpc-evropa.de/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=5&amp;Itemid=3&lt;/ref&gt; The four Communities are St. [[Zlata Meglenska]] of Zagreb, St.[[Naum of Ohrid]] in [[Split (city)|Split]], St.[[Joachim of Osogovo]] of [[Pula]] and St.[[Constantine I and Christianity|Tsar Constantin]] and [[Helena of Constantinople|Tsaritsa Elena]] of [[Rijeka]]. Father [[Kiro Velinski]] holds liturgy in Zagreb and Split.

== Media ==
There are several Macedonian language newspapers operating in Croatia. The most prominent is ''Makedonski glas'' ({{lang-mk|Македонски Глас}}, meaning ''Macedonian voice'') which has been in print since the 1990s. It is printed with financial assistance from the Croatian government.&lt;ref&gt;Makedonski Glas-http://zmurh.hr/cms/index.php?option=com_virtuemart&amp;Itemid=27&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''marriage stone''', '''nuptial stone''' or '''lintel stone'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dictionary of the Scots Language|url=http://www.dsl.ac.uk/entry/snd/mairriage|access-date=10 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; is usually a stone, rarely wood, [[lintel (architecture)|lintel]] carved with the initials, [[coat of arms]], etc. of a newly married couple, usually displaying the date of the marriage. They were very popular until [[Victorian times]], but fell out of general use in the 20th century. Many survive for aesthetic value particularly where well carved or of historic value. Many are part of or in the grounds of a [[listed building]] or in [[Conservation area (United Kingdom)|conservation areas]].

==Purpose==
[[File:Marriagestone10.jpg|thumb|250px|A marriage stone at Woodside House,&lt;ref&gt;Dobie, James D. (ed Dobie, J.S.) (1876). ''Cunninghame, Topographized by Timothy Pont'' 1604–1608, with continuations and illustrative notices. Pub. John Tweed, Glasgow. P. 381.&lt;/ref&gt; Parish of Beith.]]
Marriage stones serve as a record of a marriage, the joining together of two families,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Galway Civic Trust - Marriage Stones|url=http://galwaycivictrust.ie/downloads/Marriage%20Stones.pdf
|access-date=10 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; especially important in aristocratic families and also sometimes practised amongst the newly established and monied middle classes. They were sometimes added to a building which was constructed specifically as the new family home for the married couple, especially when the dowry was large, or were carved into a pre-existing lintel over the main entrance or over a fireplace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dictionary of the Scots Language|url=http://www.dsl.ac.uk/entry/snd/mairriage|access-date=10 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stones also clearly indicated the ownership of the building to onlookers at the time as well as serving as a record for posterity of both marital bliss and often also of social advancement.&lt;ref name="McKean"&gt;McKean, Charles (2001). ''The Scottish Chateau. The Country house of Renaissance Scotland''. Sutton Publishing. {{ISBN|0-7509-2323-7}}. p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Datestone]]s are a subtly different category in that they primarily commemorate the construction of a building rather than record a marriage. They may do both and such symbolism as entwined hearts&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dictionary of the Scots Language|url=http://www.dsl.ac.uk/entry/snd/mairriage|access-date=10 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; indicates that they serve to perform both functions. Date stones are far more common than marriage stones and are found on most types of vernacular buildings, indeed they are in vogue again today (2007), partly through the influence of the significance of the 2000 [[millennium]] year. Some buildings have both marriage stones and datestones, such as 'The Hill' at [[Dunlop, East Ayrshire|Dunlop]], which has a date stone on the 'mansion house' and even the gateposts are dated.

== Positioning ==
[[File:16thC lintel, Edinburgh Old Town.jpg|thumb|One of many 16th century door lintels in Edinburgh's [[Old Town, Edinburgh|Old Town]]]]
The stones were placed where they would be easily and frequently seen by visitors, usually on the lintel above the front door of a house, above a fireplace or in a prominent position facing the entrance or in the gardens, such as above a doorway in wall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dictionary of the Scots Language|url=http://www.dsl.ac.uk/entry/snd/mairriage|access-date=10 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many are no longer visible having been covered over in some way such as when older buildings have been extended, porches built, etc. Often the husband's initials were on the left and the wife's were on the right.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Galway Civic Trust - Marriage Stones|url=http://galwaycivictrust.ie/downloads/Marriage%20Stones.pdf
|access-date=10 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Design ==
Usually carved into stone or sometimes wood, they can be very detailed, with usually only the initials of the married couple, the date of the marriage and sometimes the [[Coat of arms]] of the 
two families, just those of the husband and very rarely the combined coats of arms of both families. In some cases the adornment was religious in nature, such as at 'The Hill' farm mansion house (see photograph) or an artistic design simply placed there as an ornamentation. The designs are found cut into the stone or standing proud of the rock face. Originally some of these stones would have been brightly painted and adorned with gilt.&lt;ref name="McKean"/&gt;

===Stones associated with marriage===

====The Treustein====
Many synagogues in Germany featured a ''Treustein'', or "marriage stone" at which a goblet was shattered at the culmination of the wedding ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Ritual and Custom - Chuppah|author=Michael Kaufman|publisher=My Jewish learning|url=http://www.myjewishlearning.com//life/Life_Events/Weddings/Liturgy_Ritual_and_Custom/Huppah.shtml?p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hindu weddings====
In [[Hindu|Hinduism]], it is customary in a marriage ceremony for the bride to stand on a stone slab or millstone to symbolise her commitment to the marriage during times of difficulty, in a practice known as Shila Arohan (Ascending the stone).&lt;ref name="Gwynne2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Gwynne|title=World Religions in Practice: A Comparative Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tdsRKc_knZoC|date=7 September 2011|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-4443-6005-9|pages=RA5–PT49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Holed stones====
On the crest of a hill near the village of [[Doagh]] in [[County Antrim]], Northern Ireland, sits a Bronze Age standing stone or 'holestone'. It is 1.5 metres high, with a 10&amp;nbsp;cm diameter hole cut into it. It is not known why the Holestone was created, but has attracted visitors seeking external love and happiness since at least the 18th century. Upon reaching the Holestone couples undertake a traditional ceremony where the woman reaches her hand through the circular hole and her partner takes it, thus pledging themselves to love each other forever. There is a legend regarding a black horse that inhabits the field in which the holestone is situated. According to this legend a young couple were married at the stone, but the groom committed an act of adultery on their wedding night. For this act he was cursed by the stone to spend eternity as a horse, never dying, and never able to leave that field.

[[File:Ireland 1300.png|thumb|right|Ireland in 1300 showing maximum extent of Hiberno-Norman control]]

The '''Normans in Ireland''', or '''Hiberno-Normans''', were a group of [[Normans]] who invaded the various realms of [[Gaelic Ireland]]. They arrived from the [[Kingdom of England]] and [[Wales]] from the 12th century onwards and established themselves as a [[feudal]] [[aristocracy]] and [[merchant]] [[oligarchy]] in the [[Lordship of Ireland]] which existed throughout the [[High Middle Ages]] and [[Late Middle Ages]]. They can in many ways be seen as a branch of the [[Anglo-Normans|Normans in England and Wales]]. Most of the Normans eventually became [[Gaelicised]], especially in the Munster with Cork as the Norman capital proven statistically by the dominance of French names and linguistics.{{clarify|date=March 2018}}

These Normans nominally owed their position and claims to territory due to the [[King of England]] and were also closely associated with the [[Gregorian Reform]] of the [[Catholic Church]] in Ireland. Their fortunes took a dip in the 17th century, when they became known as '''The Old English''' and much of their caste merged with native Irish [[Gaels]] under the denominator of "[[Irish Catholic]]." This was because a New English [[Protestant]] elite had arrived as a new ruling class in Ireland during the [[Tudor period]]. Some Normans opted to assimilate with these [[Anglo-Irish people]]. Their descendants live in Ireland to this day and have spread out through the [[Irish diaspora]], but no longer commonly identify as Norman.

Some of the most prominent Norman families were the [[House of Burke|Burkes]], [[FitzGerald dynasty|FitzGeralds]] and [[Butler dynasty|Butlers]]. One of the most popular [[Irish surnames]], Walsh, derives from the Normans based in Wales who arrived in Ireland as part of this group.

==Etymology{{anchor|Old English}}&lt;!-- [[Old English (Ireland)]] redirects here--&gt;==
Historians disagree about what to call the Normans in Ireland at different times in its existence, and in how to define this community's sense of collective identity.
{{essay-like}}
Irish historian [[Edward MacLysaght]] makes the distinction in his book, ''Surnames of Ireland'', between [[Hiberno-Norman]] and [[Anglo-Normans|Anglo-Norman]] surnames. This sums up the fundamental difference between "Queen's English Rebels" and the Loyal Lieges. The Geraldines of [[county Desmond|Desmond]] or the Burkes of [[Connacht]], for instance, could not accurately be described as Old English as that was not their political and cultural world. The [[Butler dynasty|Butlers of Ormond]], on the other hand, could not accurately be described as Hiberno-Norman in their political outlook and alliances, especially after they married into the [[British Royal Family|Royal Family]].

Some historians now refer to them as [[Cambro-Norman]]s, and Seán Duffy of [[Trinity College, Dublin]], invariably uses that term rather than the misleading Anglo-Norman (most Normans came via Wales, not England), but after many centuries in Ireland and just a century in Wales or England it appears odd that their entire history since 1169 is known by the description Old English, which only came into use in the late sixteenth century. Some contend it is ahistorical to trace a single Old English community back to 1169 as the real Old English community was a product of the late sixteenth century in the Pale. Up to that time, the identity of such people had been much more fluid; it was the administration's policies which created an oppositional and clearly defined Old English community.

[[Brendan Bradshaw]], in his study of the poetry of late sixteenth century Tír Chónaill, points out that the Normans were not referred to there as ''Seanghaill'' ("Old Foreigners") but rather as ''[[Fionnghaill and Dubhghaill]]''. He argued in a lecture to the [[Mícheál Ó Cléirigh]] Institute in [[University College, Dublin]] that the poets referred in that way to hibernicised people of Norman stock in order to grant them a longer vintage in Ireland than the (''Fionnghaill'' meaning "fair-haired Foreigners", i.e. Norwegian Vikings; ''Dubhghaill'' meaning "black-haired Foreigners", i.e. Danish Vikings). This follows on from his earlier arguments that the term ''Éireannaigh'' (Irish people) as we currently know it also emerged during this period in the poetry books of the Uí Bhroin of Wicklow as a sign of unity between Gaeil and Gaill; he viewed it as a sign of an emerging [[Irish nationalism]]. Breandán Ó Buachalla essentially agreed with him, Tom Dunne and Tom Bartlett were less sure.

It was noted in 2011 that Irish nationalist politicians elected between 1918 and 2011 could often be distinguished by surname. [[Fine Gael]] parliamentarians were more likely to bear surnames of Norman origin than those from [[Fianna Fáil]], who had a higher concentration of Gaelic surnames.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2011/0627/1224299636580.html Irish Times, 27 June 2011. "FF and FG tribal split traced back to 12th century", based on research by Drs. Byrne and O'Malley]&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Old English" vs. New English===
The term '''Old English''' ({{lang-ga|Seanghaill}}, meaning "old foreigners") began to be applied by scholars for Norman descended residents of [[The Pale]] and Irish towns after the mid-16th century, who became increasingly opposed to the Protestant "[[Anglo-Irish|New English]]" who arrived in Ireland after the [[Tudor conquest of Ireland]] in the 16th and 17th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780199234837.001.0001/acref-9780199234837-e-1420 Oxford Companion to Irish History online]&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the Old English were dispossessed in the political and religious conflicts of the 16th and 17th centuries, largely due to their continued adherence to the [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] religion. As a result, those loyal to Catholicism attempted to replace the distinction between "Norman" and "Gaelic Irish" under the new denominator of [[Irish Catholic]] by 1700, as they were both barred from positions of wealth and power by the so-called New English settlers, who became known as the [[Protestant Ascendancy]].

The earliest known reference to the term "Old English" is in the 1580s&lt;ref&gt;Canny, Nicholas, ''From Reformation to Restoration : Ireland 1534–1660'' (Dublin 1987); the third volume in the Helicon history of Ireland paperback series.&lt;/ref&gt; The community of Norman descent prior to then used numerous epithets to describe themselves (such as "Englishmen born in Ireland" or "English-Irish"), but it was only as a result of the political [[cess]] crisis of the 1580s that a group identifying itself as the Old English community actually emerged.

==History==
===Normans in medieval Ireland===
[[File:Ireland 1450.png|thumb|Ireland in 1450 showing territories recognising Anglo-Norman sovereignty in blue and grey]]
Traditionally, London-based [[Anglo-Normans|Anglo-Norman]] governments expected the Normans in the [[Lordship of Ireland]] to promote the interests of the [[Kingdom of England]], through the use of the English language (despite the fact that they spoke [[Norman-French]] rather than [[Old English|English]]), law, trade, currency, social customs, and farming methods. The Norman community in Ireland was, however, never monolithic. In some areas, especially in the Pale around [[Dublin]], and relatively urbanised communities in south [[county Wexford]], [[County Kilkenny|Kilkenny]], [[County Limerick|Limerick]] and [[County Cork|Cork]], people spoke the English language (though sometimes in arcane local dialects such as [[Yola language|Yola]]), used English law, and, in some respects, lived in a manner similar to that found in England.

However, in the provinces, the Normans in Ireland ({{Lang-ga|Gaill}} meaning "foreigners"), were at times indistinguishable from the surrounding Gaelic lords and chieftains. Dynasties such as the [[Knight of Glin|Fitzgeralds]], Butlers, and Burkes adopted the native [[Irish language|language]], [[Brehon Laws|legal system]], and other customs such as fostering and intermarriage with the Gaelic Irish and the patronage of [[Irish poetry]] and music. Such people became regarded as ''[[more Irish than the Irish themselves]]'' as a result of this process (see also [[Norman Ireland]]). The most accurate name for the community throughout the late medieval period was [[Hiberno-Norman]], a name which captures the distinctive blended culture which this community created and operated within. In an effort to halt the ongoing [[Gaelicisation]] of the Anglo-Norman community, the Irish Parliament passed the [[Statutes of Kilkenny]] in 1367, which among other things banned the use of the Irish language, the wearing of Irish clothes, as well as prohibiting the Gaelic Irish from living within walled towns.

====The Pale====
Despite these efforts, by 1515, one official lamented, that "all the common people of the said half counties" [of [[The Pale]]] "that obeyeth the King's laws, for the most part be of Irish birth, of Irish habit, and of Irish language."&lt;ref&gt;'State of Ireland &amp; plan for its reformation' in ''State Papers Ireland'', Henry VIII, ii, 8&lt;/ref&gt; English administrators such as [[Fynes Moryson]], writing in the last years of the sixteenth century, shared the latter view of what he termed the ''English-Irish'': "the English Irish and the very citizens (excepting those of Dublin where the lord deputy resides) though they could speak English as well as we, yet commonly speak Irish among themselves, and were hardly induced by our familiar conversation to speak English with us".&lt;ref&gt;Cited in Graham Kew (ed.), ''The Irish Sections of Fynes Moryson's unpublished itinerary'' (IMC, Dublin, 1998), p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; Moryson's views on the cultural fluidity of the so-called ''English Pale'' were echoed by other commentators such as Richard Stanihurst who, while protesting the Englishness of the Palesmen in 1577, opined that ''Irish was universally gaggled in the English Pale''.&lt;ref&gt;Cited in S. J. Connolly, ''Contested Island: Ireland 1460–1630'' (Oxford, 2007), p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Pale According to the Statute of 1488.jpg|150px|thumb|The Pale in 1488]]
Beyond the Pale, the term 'English', if and when it was applied, referred to a thin layer of landowners and nobility, who ruled over [[Gaels|Gaelic Irish]] freeholders and tenants. The division between the Pale and the rest of Ireland was therefore in reality not rigid or impermeable, but rather one of gradual cultural and economic differences across wide areas. Consequently, the English identity expressed by representatives of the Pale when writing in English to the English Crown often contrasted radically with their cultural affinities and kinship ties to the Gaelic world around them, and this difference between their cultural reality and their expressed identity is a central reason for later Old English support of Roman Catholicism.&lt;ref&gt;See Vincent Carey, 'Bi-lingualism and identity formation in sixteenth-century Ireland' in Hiram Morgan (ed.), ''Political Ideology in Ireland, 1541–1641'' (Dublin, 1999) for a study of this aspect of Old English culture and identity.&lt;/ref&gt;

There was no religious division in medieval Ireland, beyond the requirement that English-born prelates should run the Irish church. After the [[Henrician Reformation]] of the 1530s, however, most of the pre-16th century inhabitants of Ireland continued their allegiance to [[Roman Catholicism]], even after the establishment of the [[Church of England|Anglican Church]] in England, and its Irish counterpart, the [[Church of Ireland]].

===Tudor conquest and arrival of New English===
{{main|Reformation in Ireland}}
In contrast to previous English settlers, the ''New English'', that wave of settlers who came to Ireland from England during the [[Elizabethan]] era onwards as a result of the [[Tudor conquest of Ireland]], were more self-consciously English, and were largely (though not entirely) [[Protestant]]. To the New English, many of the Old English were "degenerate",{{according to whom|date=February 2011}} having adopted Irish customs as well choosing to adhere to Roman Catholicism after the Crown's official split with Rome. The poet [[Edmund Spenser]] was one of the chief advocates of this view. He argued in ''A View on the Present State of Ireland'' (1595) that a failure to conquer Ireland fully in the past had led previous generations of English settlers to become corrupted by the native Irish culture. In the course of the 16th century, the religious division had the effect of alienating the Old English from the state, and eventually propelled them into making common cause with the Gaelic Irish as Irish [[Roman Catholic]]s.

====Cess crisis====
The first confrontation between the Old English and the English government in Ireland came with the [[cess]] crisis of 1556–1583. During that period, the Pale community resisted paying for the English army sent to Ireland to put down a string of revolts which culminated in the [[Desmond Rebellions]] (1569–73 and 1579–83). The term "Old English" was coined at this time, as the Pale community emphasised their English identity and loyalty to the Crown, while, at the same time, contradictorily they refused to co-operate with the wishes of the English Crown as represented in Ireland by the [[Lord Deputy of Ireland]].

Originally, the conflict was a civil issue, as the [[The Pale|Palesmen]] objected to paying new taxes that had not first been approved by them in the [[Parliament of Ireland]]. The dispute, however, also soon took on a religious dimension, especially after 1570, when [[Elizabeth I of England]] was [[excommunicated]] by [[Pope Pius V]]'s [[papal bull]] ''[[Regnans in Excelsis]]''. In response, Elizabeth banned the [[Jesuits]] from her realms as they were seen as being among the [[Papacy]]'s most radical agents of the [[Counter Reformation]] which, among other aims, sought to topple her from her thrones. Rebels such as [[James Fitzmaurice Fitzgerald]] portrayed their rebellion as a "Holy War", and indeed received money and troops from the papal coffers. In the [[Second Desmond Rebellion]] (1579–83), a prominent Pale lord, James Eustace, Viscount of Baltinglass, joined the rebels from religious motivation. Before the rebellion was over, several hundred Old English Palesmen had been arrested and sentenced to death, either for outright rebellion, or because they were suspected rebels because of their religious views. Most were eventually pardoned after paying fines of up to 100 pounds, a very large sum for the time. However, twenty [[Landed gentry|landed gentlemen]] from some of the Pale's leading, Old English families were executed – some of them, "died in the manner of" [Roman] "Catholic martyrs, proclaiming they were suffering for their religious beliefs".&lt;ref&gt;Colm Lennon, Sixteenth Century Ireland, The Incomplete Conquest,204–205&lt;/ref&gt;

This episode marked an important break between the Pale and the English regime in Ireland, and between the Old English and the New English.

In the subsequent [[Nine Years' War (Ireland)|Nine Years' War]] (1594–1603), the Pale and the Old English towns remained loyal&lt;ref&gt;Colm Lennon, Sixteenth Century Ireland, The Incomplete Conquest, p 322, "Despite the proclamations of O'Neill... there is little evidence that the townsfolk and Pale gentry were in sympathy with the Ulster chieftain's war, and in this they had the backing of leading Jesuits such as Father Richard Field SJ. Whatever their common Catholicism, any links with the Spanish monarchy were strongly eschewed by the vast majority of those of 'Old English' origin in Ireland."&lt;/ref&gt; in favour of outward loyalty to the English Crown during another rebellion.

===Establishment of Protestantism===
In the end, however, it was the re-organisation of the English government's administration in Ireland along Protestant lines in the early 17th century that eventually severed the main political ties between the Old English and England itself, particularly following the [[Gunpowder Plot]] in 1605.

First, in 1609, Roman Catholics were banned from holding public office in Ireland. Then, in 1613, the constituencies of the [[Parliament of Ireland|Irish Parliament]] were changed so that the New English Anglicans would have a slight majority in the [[Irish House of Commons]]. Thirdly, in the 1630s, many members of the Old English landowning class were forced to confirm the ancient title to their land-holdings often in the absence of title deeds, which resulted in some having to pay substantial fines to retain their property, while others ended up losing some or all of their land in this complex legal process (see [[Plantations of Ireland]]).

The political response of the Old English community was to appeal directly to the [[King of Ireland]] in England, over the heads of his representatives in Dublin, effectively meaning that they had to appeal to their sovereign in his role as [[King of England]], a necessity which further disgruntled them.

First from [[James I of England|James I]], and then from his son and successor, [[Charles I of England|Charles I]], they sought a package of reforms, known as [[The Graces (Ireland)|The Graces]], which included provisions for [[religious toleration]] and civil equality for Roman Catholics in return for their payment of increased taxes. On several occasions in the 1620s and 1630s, however, after they had agreed to pay the higher taxes to the Crown, they found that the Monarch or his Irish viceroy chose instead to defer some of the agreed concessions. This was to prove culturally counterproductive for the cause of the English administration in Ireland, as it led to Old English writers, such as [[Geoffrey Keating]] to argue (as Keating did in ''Foras Feasa ar Éirinn'' (1634)), that the true identity of the Old English was now Roman Catholic and Irish, rather than English. English policy thus hastened the assimilation of the Old English with the native Irish.

===Dispossession and defeat===
{{See| Penal Laws}}
In 1641, many of the Old English community made a decisive break with their past as loyal subjects by joining the [[Irish Rebellion of 1641]]. Many factors influenced the decision of the Old English to join in the rebellion, among them fear of the rebels and fear of government reprisals against all Roman Catholics. The main long-term reason was, however, a desire to reverse the anti-Roman Catholic policies that had been pursued by the English authorities over the previous 40 years in carrying out their administration of Ireland. Nevertheless, despite their formation of an Irish government in [[Confederate Ireland]], the Old English identity was still an important division within the Irish Roman Catholic community. During the [[Irish Confederate Wars]] (1641–53), the Old English were often accused by the Gaelic Irish of being too ready to sign a treaty with [[Charles I of England]] at the expense of the interests of Irish landowners and the Roman Catholic religion. The ensuing [[Cromwellian conquest of Ireland]] (1649–53), saw the ultimate defeat of the Roman Catholic cause and the almost wholesale dispossession of the Old English nobility. While this cause was briefly revived before the [[Williamite war in Ireland]] (1689–91), by 1700, the Anglican descendants of the New English had become the dominant class in the country, along with the Old English families (and men of Gaelic origin such as [[William Conolly]]) who chose to comply with the new realities by conforming to the [[Established Church]].

====Protestant Ascendancy====
In the course of the eighteenth century under the [[Protestant Ascendancy]], social divisions were defined almost solely in [[sectarian]] terms of Roman Catholic, Anglican and Protestant Nonconformist, rather than ethnic ones. Against the backdrop of the [[Penal Laws (Ireland)]] which discriminated against them both, and a country becoming increasingly [[Anglicized]], the old distinction between Old English and Gaelic Irish Roman Catholics gradually faded away,

Changing religion, or rather conforming to the [[State Church]], was always an option for any of the King of Ireland's subjects, and an open avenue to inclusion in the officially recognised "body politic", and, indeed, many Old English such as [[Edmund Burke]] were newly-conforming Anglicans who retained a certain sympathy and understanding for the difficult position of Roman Catholics, as Burke did in his parliamentary career. Others in the [[gentry]] such as the [[Viscount Dillon|Viscounts Dillon]] and the [[Baron of Dunsany|Lords Dunsany]] belonged to Old English families who had originally undergone a religious conversion from Rome to Canterbury to save their lands and titles. Some members of the ''Old English'' who had thus gained membership in the [[Protestant Ascendancy|Irish Ascendancy]] even became adherents of the cause of Irish independence. Whereas the Old English FitzGerald [[Duke of Leinster|Dukes of Leinster]] held the premier title in the [[Irish House of Lords]] when it was abolished in 1800, a scion of that Ascendancy family, the Irish nationalist [[Lord Edward Fitzgerald]], was a brother of the second duke.

==Norman surnames in Ireland==
[[File:Maurice FitzGerald, Lord Lanstephan.jpg|200px|thumb|right|[[Maurice FitzGerald, Lord of Lanstephan]], progenitor of the Irish [[FitzGerald dynasty]], from a manuscript of the Expugnatio Hibernica, an account of the 1169 invasion of Ireland written by Maurice's nephew, [[Gerald of Wales]], in 1189.]]

The following is a list of Hiberno-Norman surnames, many of them unique to Ireland. For example, the prefix "[[Fitz]]" meaning "son of", in surnames like FitzGerald appears most frequently in Hiberno-Norman surnames. (cf. modern French "fils de" with the same meaning).&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward MacLysaght]], ''Guide to Irish Surnames'' (1965)&lt;/ref&gt;  However, very few names with the prefix "Fitz-" sound Norman but are actually of native Gaelic origin; most notably [[Fitzpatrick (surname)|FitzPatrick]] (from the [[Mac Giolla Phádraig]], kings of [[Osraige]]) and FitzDermot (Mac Gilla Mo-Cholmóc, of the Uí Dúnchada sept of the [[Uí Dúnlainge]] based at [[Lyons Hill]], Co. Dublin).

==Hiberno-Norman texts==
The annals of Ireland make a distinction made between ''Gaill'' and ''Sasanaigh''. The former were split into [[Dubgaill and Finngaill|''Fionnghaill'' or ''Dubhghaill'']], depending upon how much the poet wished to flatter his patron.&lt;ref&gt;See  [[Art Cosgrove]], 'Hiberniores Ipsis Hibernis', ''Late Medieval Ireland 1370-1541'' (Dublin, 1981) for a discussion of the differences between 'Gaill', 'Gaedhil' and 'Saxain' in late medieval Irish identity. Fionnghaill, fair-haired foreigners, were of Norwegian descent; Dubhghaill, dark-haired foreigners, were of Danish descent. The former had longer roots in Ireland and thus was, as [[Brendan Bradshaw]] demonstrated, used as a greater compliment. Normans were, of course, originally "men of the North" i.e. from [[Scandinavia]]. See CELT (http://www.ucc.ie/celt/publishd.html) for English translations of these distinctions made in all the principal late medieval Irish annals.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a number of texts in Hiberno-Norman French, most of them administrative (including commercial) or legal, although there are a few literary works as well.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucc.ie/celt/frlist.html list of Hiberno-Norman French texts at CELT]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucc.ie/celt/hibfrbib.html Bibliography of Hiberno-Norman French at CELT]&lt;/ref&gt; There is a large amount of parliamentary legislation, including the famous [[Statute of Kilkenny]] and municipal documents.

The major literary text is ''[[The Song of Dermot and the Earl]]'', a [[chanson de geste]] of 3,458 lines of verse concerning [[Dermot McMurrough]] and [[Richard de Clare, 2nd Earl of Pembroke]] (known as "Strongbow").&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucc.ie/celt/published/F250001-001/index.html Online text of Song of Dermot and the Earl at CELT]&lt;/ref&gt; Other texts include the ''Walling of New Ross'' composed about 1275, and early 14th century poems about the customs of [[Waterford]].

[[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] herbalists and [[Yoruba religion|priests]] enlist the aid of [[Osanyin]], the spirit of herbal medicines,&lt;ref name="Vogel 1981"&gt;{{cite book|title=[http://libmma.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p15324coll10/id/71017/rec/1 For spirits and kings : African art from the Paul and Ruth Tishman collection] : [Exhibition held at the Metropolitan museum of art, New York, 1981]|year=1981|publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art|location=New York|isbn=0870992686|author=Thompson, additional research by Kate Ezra ; photographs by Jerry L.|editor=Susan Vogel}}&lt;/ref&gt; or Opa Erinle, in their work against mental and physical illness caused by malevolent forces and individuals. The Yoruba believe the power of Osanyin is vested in a wrought iron staff, called an '''Osanyin staff''', that is placed on altars to this [[Orisha]].

The staff is composed of a circle of small birds and a shaft in the middle that elevates a large bird above smaller ones. [[Babatunde Lawal]] suggests that the reason for this division could be to suggest the relaying of metaphysical powers from the celestial to the terrestrial realm. Lawal evokes the Yoruba reference to Osanyin as "The one who sees everything, like [[Olodumare]]," allowing him a vantage point from which he can protect all of humanity below.&lt;ref name=Lawal&gt;{{cite book|last=Lawal|first=Babatunde|title=Embodying the sacred in Yoruba art : featuring the Bernard and Patricia Wagner Collection|year=2007|publisher=High Museum of Art|location=Atlanta, Ga.|isbn=1932543201}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The birds, emissaries of [[Ogun]], refer to the herbalist's understanding of and power over these malevolent people. There are typically sixteen birds, invoking the most sacred number of divination, surrounding and confronting the central bird, which represents the smallpox god.

'''Phoenix Country Club''' is a country club located in [[Phoenix, Arizona]]. The club was founded in 1900 and was moved to its current location in 1921.&lt;ref name=azrep11271900&gt;{{cite news | title = Articles of Incorporation of the Phoenix Country Club | date = November 27, 1900 | work = Arizona Republic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Phoenix Country Club 18-Hole Grass Golf Course Will Open Today -- One of Finest in West | date = October 1, 1921 | work = Arizona Republic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Golf Connoisseur Magazine rated Phoenix Country Club among top 100 Most Prestigious Private Clubs in America in 2006. The Club was chosen for the “ultimate mix of course, history, membership, tradition and class.” In 2009 and again in 2014, Phoenix Country Club was selected by its peers as a Platinum Club of America. The original golf course designed by Harry Collis was redesigned by [[Tom Lehman]] and [[John Fought]] in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phoenixcountryclub.com/club/scripts/public/public.asp?GRP=14415&amp;NS=PUBLIC|title=Phoenix Country Club About The Club Home|website=www.phoenixcountryclub.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

[[File:Phoenix Country Club site plan.png|thumb|Original 1920 site plan for Phoenix Country Club created by Lloyd Wright]]
[[File:Phoenix Country Club veranda.png|thumb|The veranda on the front of the original clubhouse facing southwest, 1921.]]

Phoenix Country Club was officially incorporated on October 25, 1900 by a 12-member board including [[Webster Street]], Chief Justice of the Arizona Territorial Supreme Court; and [[Dwight B. Heard]], president of the Arizona Cotton Association.&lt;ref name=azrep11271900/&gt; On October 29, 1919, the club voted to purchase a 160-acre tract of land at 7th Street and Thomas Road for the construction of a new club with and 18-hole golf course, tennis grounds, and a club house. This new property was to become the current location for the club.&lt;ref&gt;Arizona Republic, October 30, 1919&lt;/ref&gt; The land was purchased for $56,000.

Golf course designer Harry Collis, of the [[Flossmoor Country Club]] in Chicago was hired to design the layout for the new course in 1920. Los Angeles-based Landscape Architect [[Lloyd Wright]] designed the landscape gardening plans for the course.&lt;ref name=Von-Breton&gt;Von Breton, Harriette. (1974) ''Lloyd Wright, architect: 20th century architecture in an organic expostion, volume 6,'' p24&lt;/ref&gt; A former employee of the landscape architectural firm of [[Olmsted Brothers]], Wright was the son of architect [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] and was noted for his landscape design of the [[Panama-California Exposition]] in San Diego, and later became a production designer for [[Paramount Studios]].&lt;ref&gt;Arizona Republic, January 14, 1920&lt;/ref&gt; To fund the construction of the new $200,000 club facilities, 52 homesites were incorporated into the plans for the new location and are known as "Country Club Estates."&lt;ref name=ar05191920&gt;Arizona Republic, May 19, 1920&lt;/ref&gt;

The new club opened on October 27, 1921. A [[white tie]] ball celebrating the opening of the new club was held on October 28 and was restricted to membership. The following day, the golf course was inaugurated with a men's golf tournament alongside a bridge tournament for female members. The original clubhouse was of brick, painted white, with red tile roofing. It was of the Spanish Colonial style of architecture, the main portion of the structure facing a southwesterly direction. From this main portion were two wings, on at each end extending in northeasterly and southeasterly directions, respectively.&lt;ref name=azrep05191920&gt;Arizona Republic, October 27, 1921&lt;/ref&gt;

The building featured a main reception hall, ballroom, and banquet hall; men's and women's locker facilities and showers; a men's grill room; a dining room; large ornamented tile fireplaces; french foors; and verandas where afternoon tea was commonly served. Also featured were a swimming pool and four tennis courts. The entire structure was designed by Phoenix architectural firm [[Lescher &amp; Kibbey]].&lt;ref name=azrep05191920/&gt;

On September 12, 1922, the body of Phoenix Country Club secretary Guy N. Dernier was found, strangled to death and cast into the [[Arizona Canal]]. No water was found in his lungs during the autopsy meaning that he had been strangled before he was disposed of in the canal. In his [[Dodge]] automobile, parked along the canal bank, were his eyeglasses, watch, purse and articles of clothing. Found among his personal effects was a diary implicating twenty two society women in both Phoenix and Los Angeles with whom he had carried out affairs. Many of the women had compensated him for their liaisons, one paying him $600. Of the twenty two women all were married but one, a widow. Dernier had been an employee of [[Montgomery Ward]] in Chicago and came to Phoenix in 1917 for treatment for [[tuberculosis]]. He was a members of the [[Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks]].&lt;ref&gt;Arizona Republic, September 16, 1922&lt;/ref&gt; It was the opinion of the police that one of the twenty one husbands of the women with whom Dernier had had an affair was the murderer.&lt;ref&gt;Chicago Tribune, October 6, 1922&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the opening of their new club, Phoenix Country Club became the seat of leadership for the Border States Tennis Association, a member of the [[United States Tennis Association|United States Lawn Tennis Association]] with members in [[Arizona]], [[New Mexico]], [[Sonora]], and [[Texas]]. The president and treasurer of the association were members [[Dwight B. Heard]] and Mrs. [[Ernest W. Lewis]], respectively.&lt;ref name=WrightandDitson&gt;Wright &amp; Ditson (1921) ''Wright &amp; Ditson's Officially Adopted Lawn Tennis Guide'' p190&lt;/ref&gt; The Phoenix Open was first hosted at Phoenix Country Club in 1932 but was discontinued after the 1935 tournament. The rebirth of the Phoenix Open came in 1939 when member Bob Goldwater, Sr. convinced fellow Thunderbirds to help run the event. The Thunderbirds, a prominent civic organization in Phoenix, were not as enthusiastic about running the event as he was, leaving Goldwater, Sr. to do most of the work in getting a golf open started.&lt;ref name=wmpsith&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wmphoenixopen.com/spectator-info/tournament-history/|title=TOURNAMENT HISTORY – Waste Management Phoenix Open|website=wmphoenixopen.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in 1955, the Arizona Country Club alternated as event host with Phoenix Country Club; this arrangement lasted until Phoenix Country Club took The Arizona Country Club's turn in 1975 and became the event's permanent home again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.azcountryclub.com/Golf-(1).aspx|title=Arizona Country Club - Phoenix, AZ - Golf|website=www.azcountryclub.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tournament was moved in 1987 to its current home, the Stadium Course at [[TPC of Scottsdale]], northeast of downtown Phoenix.&lt;ref name=wmpsith/&gt; During its time as host of the Phoenix Open, the club hosted such notable golfers as [[Ben Hogan]], [[Byron Nelson]], [[Jack Nicklaus]], [[Arnold Palmer]], [[Gene Littler]], [[Johnny Miller]], [[Miller Barber]], [[Ben Crenshaw]], [[Hal Sutton]], and many others.&lt;ref name=pcccslvdh&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phoenixcountryclub.com/club/scripts/library/view_document.asp?GRP=..&amp;NS=PUBLIC&amp;APP=80&amp;DN=HISTORY|title=Phoenix Country Club View Library Document: History|website=www.phoenixcountryclub.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The club also hosted the [[Western Open]] in 1941 and 1942.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://golfblogger.com/tag/phoenix-open/|title=Phoenix Open Archives - GolfBlogger Golf Blog|website=GolfBlogger Golf Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1961, a new contemporary clubhouse designed by the architectural firm [[Edward L. Varney|Edward L. Varney &amp; Associates]] was constructed adjacent to the old clubhouse at a cost of $1,000,000. The new clubhouse is 68,000 square feet in size and features a second floor with 35 guest rooms, larger kitchen and dining facilities and larger locker room facilities. A new swimming pool and seven additional tennis courts were also constructed. The original clubhouse was demolished soon after the completion of the new clubhouse and was replaced with a new terrace. The 1961 clubhouse continues to serve as the clubhouse for Phoenix Country Club.&lt;ref&gt;Arizona Republic, October 22, 1959&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, the 80-year-old Collis course was redesigned by Tom Lehman and John Faught.&lt;ref name=itcpgat11/&gt;

In 2017, Phoenix Country Club became the host of the [[Charles Schwab Cup Championship]], the season finale of the [[PGA Tour Champions]].

[[Population health]], a field which focuses on the improvement of the health outcomes for a group of individuals, has been described as consisting of three components: "health outcomes, patterns of health determinants, and policies and interventions".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kindig|first=David|last2=Stoddart|first2=Greg|date=2016-10-15|title=What Is Population Health?|pmc=1447747|journal=American Journal of Public Health|volume=93|issue=3|pages=380–383|issn=0090-0036|pmid=12604476|doi=10.2105/ajph.93.3.380}}&lt;/ref&gt; Policies and Interventions define the methods in which [[Health outcomes research|health outcomes]] and patterns of [[health determinant]]s are implemented. Policies which are helpful "improve the conditions under which people live".&lt;ref name=Milio/&gt; Interventions encourage healthy behaviors for individuals or populations through "program elements or strategies designed to produce behavior changes or improve health status".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://health.mo.gov/data/interventionmica/index_4.html|title=What is an intervention?|website=health.mo.gov|access-date=2016-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Policies and interventions are needed due to the inequalities amongst populations and the inconsistent way care is administered. Policies can include "necessary community and personal social and health services" &lt;ref name=Milio/&gt; as well as taxes on alcohol and soft drinks and implement smoking cessation policies. Interventions can include therapeutic or preventative health care and may also include actions taken by the individual or by someone on behalf of the individual. The application of population health is determined by the policies and interventions which can be implemented within an organization, city, state or country.

== Common methodology ==
Countries, states, provinces and providers across the globe are shifting towards better systems to respond to inconsistent health outcomes, mitigate decreasing margins and replace outdated methods such as [[fee-for-service]] health delivery. Payment model reforms, including the [[Accountable Care Organization]] (ACO), provide roadmaps for healthcare reform and drive many of its constituents towards more effective and innovative means for improving health outcomes. Population health management is a common approach for resolving these challenges but it involves new methods, tools, systems and implementations to correct inefficiencies and improve health outcomes.

Population health tools and computer systems include data exchange, large datasets, and advanced software which are used to supply data scientists and research teams with appropriate information which can then be used by policy makers and change agents. This method helps to set policies around population health as well as intervention strategies which are then used to respond to the needs of a population.

== Policies and Policymakers ==
Policy for population health "sets priorities" &lt;ref name=Milio&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Milio|first=N|date=2016-10-10|title=Glossary: healthy public policy*|pmc=1731988|journal=Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health|volume=55|issue=9|pages=622–623|doi=10.1136/jech.55.9.622|issn=0143-005X|pmid=11511639}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are a "guide to action to change what would otherwise occur".&lt;ref name=Milio/&gt; Policies are based on "social sciences of sociology, economics, demography, public health, anthropology, and epidemiology" &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kindig|first=David A|date=2016-10-13|title=Understanding Population Health Terminology|pmc=2690307|journal=The Milbank Quarterly|volume=85|issue=1|pages=139–161|doi=10.1111/j.1468-0009.2007.00479.x|issn=0887-378X|pmid=17319809}}&lt;/ref&gt; and determine how outcomes can be accomplished are implemented at various levels. Such guides determine laws, policies, and ordinances and are defined by policymakers. Examples of policies include "smoking bans, excise taxes on cigarettes and alcohol, seat belt laws, water fluoridation, and restaurant menu labeling".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.improvingpopulationhealth.org/blog/policies-and-programs.html&lt;/ref&gt; They may be applied to a commercial establishment such as a restaurant, business workplace or within a city or state level. Policies should be evidence based and require academic studies or research to support the approach. This will assure that the appropriate measures needed for each demographic are promoted to encourage the necessary intervention practices which can be applied to each population or to the nation as a whole.

Policymakers can be classified as both private and public and are defined as someone who is in a position of authority to implement health policies. A public policy maker could be a government official and a private policymaker could be a business owner or administrator. Policymakers are influenced by, and can also be, change agents. Change agents include "legislators in Washington, an attorney general, regulators at the FDA, an advocacy group or other organizations that clearly have influence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video

== Political strategy ==
The goal for any political strategies surrounding population health is to "improve chances of success for policy adoption and implementation".&lt;ref name=Milio/&gt; Such strategies include the creation of funds to support initiatives and the construction of strategies which limit conflicts of interest in the implementation of public policy.

=== Tobacco Control ===
A political strategy implemented to limit the sale and exposure to tobacco products and restrict the tobacco company's ability to benefit politically from charitable donations is the creation of the [[WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control|World Health Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC)]] treaty. The legally binding document is supported by numerous countries, government/nongovernment agencies and provides the necessary power to prevent negative influences on population health policies.

== Interventions ==
Interventions in population health "shift the distribution of health risk by addressing the underlying social, economic and environmental conditions"&lt;ref name=Hawe&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hawe|first=Penelope|last2=Potvin|first2=Louise|date=2017-02-01|title=What is population health intervention research?|pmid=19263977|journal=Canadian Journal of Public Health = Revue Canadienne De Santé Publique|volume=100|issue=1|pages=Suppl I8–14|issn=0008-4263}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are implemented through "programs or policies designed and developed in the health sector, but they are more likely to be in sectors elsewhere, such as education, housing or employment".&lt;ref name=Hawe/&gt; They are aimed at reducing such things as [[childhood obesity]], [[cardiovascular disease]], smoking and mental health issues throughout society. The means in which interventions are devised is through extensive research and contributions from medical scientists, researchers, and medical professionals. They are implemented by but are not limited to educators, practicing physicians, business administrators and mental health professionals.

== Approaches and Implementations ==

A typical approach includes assessing the conditions and possible improvements which can be made within the social determinants that have been identified. Each approach is handled at a state or health plan level.

One example was a workplace in China which implemented policies and interventions for their staff to fight depression. By recognizing the importance of mental health, they were able to reduce depression and improve job satisfaction across the company. The company published its research and findings to promote "enterprises taking more responsibility for the provision of mental health services to their employees".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sun|first=Jing|last2=Buys|first2=Nicholas|last3=Wang|first3=Xinchao|date=2013-05-14|title=Effectiveness of a Workplace-Based Intervention Program to Promote Mental Health among Employees in Privately Owned Enterprises in China|url=http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/pop.2012.0113|journal=Population Health Management|volume=16|issue=6|pages=406–414|doi=10.1089/pop.2012.0113|issn=1942-7891}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example was the implementation of a smoking cessation program to the province of Ontario. Studies were performed on weekly visit rates to psychiatric emergency departments before and after the implementation. The result was a "15.5% reduction in patient visits for patients with a primary diagnosis of psychotic disorder".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kurdyak|first=Paul|last2=Cairney|first2=John|last3=Sarnocinska-Hart|first3=Anna|last4=Callahan|first4=Russell C.|last5=Strike|first5=Carol|date=2008-11-01|title=The impact of a smoking cessation policy on visits to a psychiatric emergency department|pmid=19087472|journal=Canadian Journal of Psychiatry. Revue Canadienne De Psychiatrie|volume=53|issue=11|pages=779–782|issn=0706-7437|doi=10.1177/070674370805301110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Inequalities and Variance of Implementation ==

As is the common understanding of population health, health inequalities, defined as a "generic term used to designate differences, variations, and disparities in the health achievements of individuals and groups",&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |pmc = 1732240 | title =A Glossary for Health Inequalities | authors= Kawachi, I, S Subramanian, and N Almeida-Filho | journal = Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health | volume = 56 | pages = 647–652
 | year = 2002 | pmid=12177079 | doi=10.1136/jech.56.9.647}}&lt;/ref&gt; must be considered to correctly implement the most effective policies and interventions. Based on a population and its socioeconomic, geographic, ethnicity and other factors, policies and interventions may vary. Policies implemented for one population may be less effective and more costly than it would be for another similar population. For example, US policies tend to be more costly than European and have less impact. Research has shown that in some instances, "Americans had worse outcomes than their international peers"&lt;ref name=Squires&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Squires|first=David|last2=Anderson|first2=Chloe|title=U.S. Health Care from a Global Perspective|url=http://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/issue-briefs/2015/oct/us-health-care-from-a-global-perspective}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also had "the lowest life expectancy at birth of the countries studied".&lt;ref name=Squires/&gt;

The '''retail apocalypse''' is the closing of a large number of [[economy of North America|North American]] brick-and-mortar [[retail]] stores, especially those of large chains, starting in 2010 and continuing through 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.businessinsider.com/store-closures-in-2018-will-eclipse-2017-2018-1 |title=A tsunami of store closings is about to hit the US — and it's expected to eclipse the retail carnage of 2017 |last=Peterson |first=Hayley |date=January 1, 2018 |website= businessinsider.com |access-date= January 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="atlantic" /&gt;  Over 12,000 physical stores have been closed, due to factors such as over-expansion of malls, rising rents, bankruptcies of [[leveraged buyout]]s, low quarterly profits outside holiday binge spending, delayed effects of the [[Great Recession]],&lt;ref name="atlantic"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2017/04/retail-meltdown-of-2017/522384/|title=What in the World Is Causing the Retail Meltdown of 2017?|first=Derek|last=Thompson|date=April 10, 2017|accessdate=April 10, 2017|publisher=''[[The Atlantic]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; and changes in spending habits. North American consumers have shifted their purchasing habits due to various factors, including [[experience economy |experience-spending]] versus material goods and homes, casual fashion in relaxed [[dress code]]s, as well as the rise of [[e-commerce]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/companies/these-haunting-photos-of-the-retail-apocalypse-reveal-a-new-normal-in-america/ss-BByFpjX  Photo slideshow of shuttered retail stores and shopping centers] ''[[Business Insider]]''&lt;/ref&gt; mostly in the form of competition from juggernaut companies such as [[Amazon.com]] and [[Walmart]].

Major [[department store]]s such as [[J. C. Penney]], [[Macy’s]], [[Sears]], and [[Kmart]] have announced hundreds of store closures, and well-known apparel brands such as [[J.

The retail apocalypse phenomenon is related to the [[middle-class squeeze]], in which consumers experience a decrease in [[income]]  while costs increase for education, healthcare, and housing. [[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]]  stated that the cause of the retail apocalypse "isn’t as simple as [[Amazon.com]] Inc. taking market share or twenty-somethings spending more on experiences than things. The root cause is that many of these long-standing chains are overloaded with debt—often from [[leveraged buyout]]s led by [[private equity]] firms."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2017-retail-debt/  America’s ‘Retail Apocalypse’ Is Really Just Beginning] Matt Townsend, Jenny Surane, Emma Orr and Christopher Cannon, [[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]], November 8, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; [[Forbes]] has said the media coverage is exaggerated, and the sector is simply evolving.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/sites/gregmaloney/2017/10/23/retail-apocalypse-yawn/#66e651f0df2e Retail Apocalypse? The Sky Isn't Falling – The Sector Is Just Evolving] Greg Maloney, Forbes, 2017/10/23&lt;/ref&gt;
The most productive retailers in the [[United States]] during the retail apocalypse are Walmart and [[Target Corporation|Target]], some regional department store chains (e.g. [[Belk]], [[Boscov's]], [[Boyd's]], [[Dillard's]], and [[Von Maur]]), the low-cost "[[fast-fashion]]" brands  (e.g. [[Zara (retailer)|Zara]], [[Uniqlo]], [[Cotton On]], [[Forever 21]], and [[H&amp;M]]), off-price department stores ([[Ross Stores]] and DD's Discounts, [[Marshalls]] and [[Burlington (department store)|Burlington]]) and [[dollar stores]] (e.g. [[Dollar General]] and [[Family Dollar]]).&lt;ref&gt;[https://qz.com/1120552/the-retail-apocalypse-isnt-just-amazon-its-that-the-middle-class-is-disappearing/ The US middle class is disappearing, which makes dollar stores very happy] Helen Edwards &amp; Dave Edwards, [[Qz.com]] 8 December 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

Accompanying the store closings were, in many cases, significant declines in the stock prices of retail companies.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/sites/ericervin/2017/05/30/finding-the-best-retail-stocks-amid-broad-declines Forbes.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Since at least 2010, various economic factors have resulted in the closing of a large number of North American retailers, particularly in the [[department store]] industry. For instance, [[Sears Holdings]], which had 4,061 Kmart and Sears stores in the United States and Canada at the company's peak on October 29, 2011 (Q3 2011), including [[Orchard Supply Hardware]] locations that were spun off in 2012, those now spun off to [[Sears Hometown and Outlet Stores]] on October 11, 2012 and a de-consolidation of [[Sears Canada]] on October 16, 2014, was down to 866 in the United States as of August 13, 2018, with more closures scheduled.&lt;ref name="economiccollapse"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/its-a-retail-apocalypse-sears-macys-and-the-limited-are-all-closing-stores|title=It’s A Retail Apocalypse: Sears, Macy’s And The Limited Are All Closing Store|first=Michael|last=Snyder|date=January 8, 2017|accessdate=April 10, 2017|publisher=The Economic Collapse}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kmart operated 2,171 stores at its peak in 2000,&lt;ref name="kmartannual1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/56824/000095012400002311/0000950124-00-002311.txt|title=KMART CORP Annual Report – Fiscal Year Ending January 29th, 2000.|last=|first=|date=|website=|dead-url=|access-date=April 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; a number that has since dwindled to 360 with further closures planned.&lt;ref name="kmartwarren"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1310067/000131006717000005/shld201610k.htm|title=SEARS HOLDINGS CORPORATION Annual Report – Fiscal Year Ending January 28th, 2017|last=|first=|date=March 21, 2017|website=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kmart.com/stores/ohio/warren/4939.html|title=Kmart – Warren, OH 44484|last=|first=|date=March 21, 2017|website=Used phone number to confirm: 330-544-2098|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gregg]], [[Family Christian Stores]] and [[The Limited]] all going out of business entirely.&lt;ref name="whioohioimpact"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.whio.com/business/retail-apocalypse-500-stores-more-close-this-year/RzTeZhnIk13YIlF0skFV3H|title=RETAIL APOCALYPSE: 3,500 stores or more to close this year|first=Kara|last=Driscoll|date=March 27, 2017|accessdate=April 8, 2017|publisher=[[WHIO-TV]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Atlantic]]'' describes the phenomenon as "The Great Retail Apocalypse of 2017," reporting nine retail bankruptcies and several apparel companies having their stock hit new lows, including that of [[Lululemon]], [[Urban Outfitters]], [[American Eagle Outfitters|American Eagle]].&lt;ref name="atlantic" /&gt; [[Credit Suisse]], a major global financial services company, predicted that 25% of U.S. malls remaining in 2017 could close by 2022.&lt;ref name="gymboree"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2017/06/12/childrens-apparel-chain-gymboree-files-chapter-11-bankruptcy/102772792/|title=Gymboree files bankruptcy, closing up to 450 stores|first=Nathan|last=Bomey|date=June 12, 2017|accessdate=June 12, 2017|publisher=[[USA Today]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The retail apocalypse has had a [[domino effect]] on suppliers; [[Hasbro]], for example, cited the loss of the Toys R Us chain as a major cause for lost revenue and layoffs the company imposed in October 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wivb.com/news/national/hasbro-points-to-toys-r-us-demise-in-announcing-layoffs/1542038375|title=Hasbro points to Toys R Us' demise in announcing layoffs|publisher=CBS News|date=October 22, 2018|accessdate=October 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the second half of 2017 and throughout 2018, the media and analyst community began recognizing retail as an industry in transition, rather than demise. [[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]] said in May 2018 that ‘the death of retail has been greatly exaggerated’ and Telsey Advisory Group stated that ‘retail is not dead’ in August 2018 following news that the SPDR S&amp;P Retail ETF had risen 13% year to date to a record high, more than double the return of the S&amp;P 500 Index.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/31/digital-retailers-and-foreign-brands-fill-empty-us-malls.html|title=Is the retail collapse over?

In June 2018, SeekingAlpha wrote that 90 percent of purchases are still made in stores, and except for Amazon, the top ten retailers are brick-and mortar operators: in order, they are Walmart, Kroger, Costco, Home Depot, CVS, Walgreens, Amazon.com, Target, Lowe’s and Albertsons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://seekingalpha.com/article/4184162-retail-apocalypse-wake-experience-renaissance?page=3|title=What Retail Apocalypse?

JLL reports that digitally native brands will open 850 stores in the next five years. These retailers are finding that opening a physical store has a halo effect on web traffic: A study from the International Council of Shopping Centers shows that a new store increases traffic to that retailer’s website by an average of 37 percent and drives up share of web traffic within that market by 27 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.retaildive.com/news/e-commerce-pure-plays-set-to-open-850-stores-in-five-years/539320/|title=Digitally native brands set to open 850 stores in 5 years|work=Retail Dive|access-date=2018-11-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://reports.icsc.org/thehaloeffect|title=The Halo Effect: How Bricks Impact Clicks|website=reports.icsc.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-22/warby-parker-and-casper-are-coming-to-a-strip-mall-near-you|title=Warby Parker and Casper Are Coming to a Strip Mall Near You|last=|first=|date=|website=Bloomberg|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Retail Federation forecasted that 2018 retail sales would climb at least 4.5 percent over 2017, pointing to higher wages, gains in disposable income, a strong job market and record-high household net worth for very robust growth in the nation's consumer-driven economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/13/retail-sales-in-2018-could-climb-higher-than-previously-forecast-nrf.html|title=2018 retail sales could climb higher than forecast, the National Retail Federation says|last=Thomas|first=Lauren|date=2018-08-13|work=CNBC|access-date=2018-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main factor cited in the closing of retail stores in the retail apocalypse is the shift in consumer habits towards online shopping.&lt;ref&gt;Kyle Arnold, [http://www.orlandosentinel.com/business/consumer/os-bz-retail-apocalypse-20170716-story.html Retail apocalypse?

'''Sarwani''','''Sarvani''' or '''Sherwani''' ({{lang-ur| شیروانی }}) is a [[Pashtun people|Pashtun]] [[tribe]] settled in [[Afghanistan]], [[Pakistan]] and [[India]] , with majority members living in India,Pakistan and few in  Afghanistan who originate from the city of Sherran or Current Iran-Afghan bordered Regions and from the [[Ghazni province]]. {{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

==History==
Earliest known member of Sherwani Family was Yousf Khan Haft Hazarvi. Who was a general of 7000 soldiers of [[Ahmad Shah Durrani]],
'''Sarwani''' or '''Sherwani''' tribes migrated to Southern NWFP [[Dera Ismail Khan]] and settled in Chaudwan. A town by the name of Dhraban was built by Sarwanis in DIK, where a dispute with Suris resulted in heavy casualties on both sides.&lt;ref&gt;Hayat-i-Afghani by Muhammad Hayat Khan&lt;/ref&gt; The Miankhels of Dera Ismail Khan subsequently forced Sarwanis to leave that place. Some went to India.. A few families are now residing in Spinkane Ziarat Ka Ka Sahib and Amiro Khairabad, [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa|NWFP]], Pakistan. Those who migrated to India produced many generals especially in army of [[Sher Shah Suri]]. Some Sherwanis have made significant contributions in Indian history. Abbas Khan Sherwani wrote the history of Sher Shah Suri and Hasel??? Sherwani was an ataleeq (tutor) to Shahjehan

The '''Organization of Medical Anthropology''' was formed in 1967 and first met on April 27, 1968, at the 27th Annual Meeting of the [[Society for Applied Anthropology]] (SfAA), during which the Medical Anthropology Newsletter was conceived and first published in October 1968 with 53 subscribers. On November 22, 1968, the Organization held its first medical anthropology workshop at the [[American Anthropological Association]] (AAA) Annual Meeting and became the '''Group for Medical Anthropology''' ('''GMA'''). Thereafter, medical anthropology meetings have met regularly both at the SfAA and AAA meetings. At the AAA Annual Meeting in San Diego, California, in November 1970, the GMA became the '''Society for Medical Anthropology''' ('''SMA''') and adopted its Constitution, of which its first objective was “to promote study of anthropological aspects of health, illness, health care, and related topics.” In 1971, the SMA became a section of the AAA. 

The SMA offers several awards including the [[Rudolf Virchow Award]].

'''Sociological theories''' are statements of how and why particular facts about the social world are related.&lt;ref name="Sociology 7th Canadian Edition"/&gt; They range in scope from concise descriptions of a single social process to [[paradigm]]s for analysis and [[interpretation (philosophy)|interpretation]]. Some [[sociology|sociological]] theories explain aspects of the social world and enable prediction about future events,&lt;ref name="What is Sociological Theory?"/&gt; while others function as broad perspectives which guide further sociological analyses.&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002"/&gt;

==Sociological theory vs. social theory==
Kenneth Allan&lt;ref name="Allan2006"/&gt; proposed the distinction between sociological theory and [[social theory]]. In Allan's usage, sociological theory consists of abstract and testable propositions about society.&lt;ref name="Allan2006"/&gt; It often heavily relies on the [[scientific method]], which aims for [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objectivity]], and attempts to avoid passing [[value judgment]]s. In contrast, social theory, according to Allan, focuses on commentary and critique of [[modern society]] rather than explanation.&lt;ref name="Allan2006"/&gt; Social theory is often closer to [[Continental philosophy]]; thus, it is less concerned with [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objectivity]] and derivation of testable propositions, and more likely to pass normative judgments.&lt;ref name=sanderson/&gt;

Prominent sociological theorists include [[Talcott Parsons]], [[Robert K. Merton]], [[Randall Collins]], [[James Samuel Coleman]], [[Peter Blau]], [[Niklas Luhmann]], [[Marshal McLuhan]], [[Immanuel Wallerstein]], [[George Homans]], [[Harrison White]], [[Theda Skocpol]], [[Gerhard Lenski]], [[Pierre van den Berghe]] and [[Jonathan H. Turner]].&lt;ref name=sanderson/&gt; Prominent social theorists include: [[Jürgen Habermas]], [[Anthony Giddens]], [[Michel Foucault]], [[Dorothy E. Smith|Dorothy Smith]], [[Roberto Mangabeira Unger|Roberto Unger]], [[Alfred Schütz]], [[Jeffrey Alexander]], and [[Jacques Derrida]].&lt;ref name="sanderson"/&gt; There are also prominent scholars who could be seen as being in-between social and sociological theories, such as [[Harold Garfinkel]], [[Herbert Blumer]], [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]], [[Pierre Bourdieu]] and [[Erving Goffman]].&lt;ref name=sanderson/&gt;

==History of sociological theories==
{{Details|History of sociology}}
The field of [[sociology]] itself–and sociological theory by extension–is relatively new. Both date back to the 18th and 19th centuries. The drastic social changes of that period, such as [[industrialization]], [[urbanization]], and the rise of [[democracy|democratic states]] caused particularly Western thinkers to become aware of society. The oldest sociological theories deal with broad historical processes relating to these changes. Since then, sociological theories have come to encompass most aspects of [[society]], including [[community|communities]], [[organization]]s and [[Interpersonal relationship|relationship]]s.&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002-5"/&gt;

==Central theoretical problems==

Overall, there is a strong consensus regarding the central theoretical questions and the central problems that emerge from explicating such questions. Sociological theory attempts to answer the following three questions: (1) What is action? (2) What is social order? and (3) What determines social change? In the myriad attempts to answer these questions, three predominately theoretical (i.e. not empirical) problems emerge. These problems are largely inherited from the classical theoretical traditions. The consensus on the central theoretical problems is: how to link, transcend or cope with the following "big three" dichotomies:&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=vQbjnVBKRAkC&amp;pg=PP1 Rational Choice Theory: Resisting Colonization&lt;/ref&gt; [[subjectivity and objectivity]], [[structure and agency]], and [[synchrony and diachrony]]. The first deals with ''knowledge'', the second with ''agency'', and the last with ''time''. Lastly, sociological theory often grapples with the problem of integrating or transcending the divide between micro, meso and macro-scale social phenomena, which is a subset of all three central problems. These problems are not altogether empirical problems, rather they are epistemological: they arise from the conceptual imagery and analytical analogies that sociologists use to describe the complexity of social processes.

===Objectivity and subjectivity===
{{Main|Objectivity (science)|Objectivity (philosophy)|Subjectivity}}

The problem of subjectivity and objectivity can be divided into a concern over the general possibilities of social actions, and, on the other hand the specific problem of social scientific knowledge. In the former, the subjective is often equated (though not necessarily) with the individual, and the individual's intentions and interpretations of the objective. The objective is often considered any public or external action or outcome, on up to society writ large. A primary question for social theorists, is how knowledge reproduces along the chain of subjective-objective-subjective, that is to say: how is ''[[intersubjectivity]]'' achieved? While, historically, qualitative methods have attempted to tease out subjective interpretations, quantitative survey methods also attempt to capture individual subjectivities. Also, some qualitative methods take a radical approach to objective description [[in situ]].

The latter concern with scientific knowledge results from the fact that a sociologist is part of the very object they seek to explain. Bourdieu puts this problem rather succinctly:

{{quote| How can the sociologist effect in practice this radical doubting which is indispensable for bracketing all the presuppositions inherent in the fact that she is a social being, that she is therefore socialized and led to feel "like a fish in water" within that social world whose structures she has internalized? How can she prevent the social world itself from carrying out the construction of the object, in a sense, through her, through these unself-conscious operations or operations unaware of themselves of which she is the apparent subject| Pierre Bourdieu|"The Problem of Reflexive Sociology" in ''An Invitation to Reflexive Sociology''&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Bourdieu, "The Problem of Reflexive Sociology" in ''An Invitation to Reflexive Sociology'', 1992, pg 235, 1992, pg 235&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Structure and agency===
{{Main|Structure and agency}}
Structure and agency, sometimes referred to as determinism versus voluntarism,&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=SMbNRp5EseMC&amp;pg=PA65 Realist Social Theory: The Morphogenetic Approach&lt;/ref&gt; form an enduring ontological debate in social theory: "Do social structures determine an individual's behaviour or does human agency?" In this context '[[agency (sociology)|agency]]' refers to the capacity of individuals to act independently and make free choices, whereas '[[social structure|structure]]' relates to factors which limit or affect the choices and actions of individuals (such as social class, religion, gender, ethnicity, and so on). Discussions over the primacy of either structure and agency relate to the core of sociological [[epistemology]] ("What is the social world made of?", "What is a cause in the social world, and what is an effect?").&lt;ref name="The Constitution of Society"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Giddens, A |title=The Constitution of Society|publisher=University of California Press |location=California |year=1996|pages=14–19|isbn= 978-0-520-05728-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; A perennial question within this debate is that of "[[social reproduction]]": how are structures (specifically, structures producing inequality) reproduced through the choices of individuals?

===Synchrony and diachrony===

Synchrony and diachrony, or statics and dynamics, within social theory are terms that refer to a distinction emerging out of the work of [[Levi-Strauss]] who inherited it from the linguistics of [[Ferdinand de Saussure]].&lt;ref name="Lizardo, Omar 2010"&gt;Lizardo, Omar. "Beyond the antinomies of structure: Levi-Strauss, Giddens, Bourdieu, and Sewell." Theory and society 39.6 (2010): 651-688.&lt;/ref&gt; The former slices moments of time for analysis, thus it is an analysis of static social reality. Diachrony, on the other hand, attempts to analyze dynamic sequences. Following Saussure, synchrony would refer to social phenomena as a static concept like a ''language'', while diachrony would refer to unfolding processes like actual ''speech''. In Anthony Giddens' introduction to ''Central Problems in Social Theory'', he states that, "in order to show the interdependence of action and structure...we must grasp the time space relations inherent in the constitution of all social interaction." And like structure and agency, time is integral to discussion of [[social reproduction]]. In terms of sociology, historical sociology is often better positioned to analyze social life as diachronic, while survey research takes a snapshot of social life and is thus better equipped to understand social life as synchronic. Some argue that the synchrony of social structure is a methodological perspective rather than an ontological claim.&lt;ref name="Lizardo, Omar 2010"/&gt; Nonetheless, the problem for theory is how to integrate the two manners of recording and thinking about social data.

==Classical theoretical traditions&lt;!--'Classical sociology' and 'Classical social theory' redirect here--&gt;==

The contemporary discipline of sociology is theoretically multi-paradigmatic.&lt;ref name="Abend"&gt;Abend, Gabriel. 2008. "The meaning of 'Theory'." Sociological Theory, 26:2&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Randall Collins]]' well-cited survey of sociological theory&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://wur.on.worldcat.org/oclc/782169682|title=Four sociological traditions : selected readings|first=Randall|last=Collins|date=6 May 1994|publisher=Oxford University Press|website=worldcat.org|accessdate=6 May 2018|isbn=9780195087024}}&lt;/ref&gt; he retroactively labels various theorists as belonging to four theoretical traditions: functionalism, conflict, symbolic interactionism, and utilitarianism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://catalog.flatworldknowledge.com/bookhub/reader/2?e=barkbrief-ch01_s03|title=Sociology: Understanding and Changing the Social World, Brief Edition v1.0  -  FlatWorld|author=|date=|website=flatworldknowledge.com|accessdate=6 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern sociological theory descends predominately from functionalist (Durkheim) and conflict-centered (Marx and Weber) accounts of social structure, as well as the symbolic interactionist tradition consisting of micro-scale structural ([[Georg Simmel|Simmel]]) and [[pragmatism|pragmatist]] ([[George Herbert Mead|Mead]], [[Charles Cooley|Cooley]]) theories of social interaction. [[Utilitarianism]], also known as "rational choice" or "social exchange", although often associated with [[economics]], is an established tradition within sociological theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |jstor=2952549 |title=Archived copy }} Sociological Rational Choice Theory&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coleman, James S., and Thomas J. Fararo. "Rational choice theory." Nueva York: Sage (1992)&lt;/ref&gt; Lastly, as argued by [[Raewyn Connell]], a tradition that is often forgotten is that of [[social Darwinism]], which brings the logic of Darwinian biological evolution and applies it to people and societies.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=QZ_rAAAAMAAJ Southern theory: the global dynamics of knowledge in social science&lt;/ref&gt; This tradition often aligns with classical functionalism and is associated with several founders of sociology, primarily [[Herbert Spencer]], [[Lester F. Ward]] and [[William Graham Sumner]]. Contemporary sociological theory retains traces of each these traditions and they are by no means mutually exclusive.

===Structural functionalism===
{{Anchor|Functionalism}}
{{Main|Structural functionalism}}
A broad historical paradigm in both sociology and [[anthropology]], functionalism addresses the [[social structure]] as a whole and in terms of the necessary function of its constituent elements. A common analogy (popularized by [[Herbert Spencer]]) is to regard [[norm (sociology)|norm]]s and [[institution]]s as 'organs' that work toward the proper-functioning of the entire 'body' of society.&lt;ref name="Sociology beyond societies: mobilities for the twenty-first century"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Urry |first=John |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ogyDBobOHVEC&amp;pg=PA23 |title=Sociology beyond societies: mobilities for the twenty-first century |chapter=Metaphors |publisher=Routledge |year=2000 |page=23 |isbn=978-0-415-19089-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The perspective was implicit in the original sociological positivism of Comte, but was theorized in full by Durkheim, again with respect to observable, structural laws. Functionalism also has an anthropological basis in the work of theorists such as [[Marcel Mauss]], [[Bronisław Malinowski]] and [[Alfred Radcliffe-Brown]]. It is in Radcliffe-Brown's specific usage that the prefix 'structural' emerged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.as.ua.edu/ant/Faculty/murphy/function.htm |title=Department of Anthropology College of Arts and Sciences The University of Alabama: Anthropological theories |publisher=As.ua.edu |accessdate=2011-11-04 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111105202737/http://www.as.ua.edu/ant/Faculty/murphy/function.htm |archivedate=2011-11-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Classical functionalist theory is generally united by its tendency towards biological analogy and notions of [[social evolutionism]]. As [[Anthony Giddens|Giddens]] states: "Functionalist thought, from Comte onwards, has looked particularly towards biology as the science providing the closest and most compatible model for social science. Biology has been taken to provide a guide to conceptualizing the structure and the function of social systems and to analyzing processes of evolution via mechanisms of adaptation ... functionalism strongly emphasizes the pre-eminence of the social world over its individual parts (i.e. its constituent actors, human subjects)."&lt;ref&gt;Giddens, Anthony "The Constitution of Society" in ''The Giddens Reader'' Philip Cassell (eds.) MacMillan Press pp.88&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conflict theory===
{{Main|Conflict theories}}
[[Social conflict]] is the struggle between segments of society over valued resources.&lt;ref name="aghababa"/&gt; From the [https://books.google.co.in/books?id=YjGpDAAAQBAJ perspective of social conflict theory], in the West, by the nineteenth century, a small population had become capitalists. Capitalists are people who own and operate factories and other businesses in pursuit of profits. In other words, they own virtually all large-scale means of production. However, capitalism turned most other people into industrial workers, whom Marx called proletarians. Proletarians are people who, because of the structure of capitalist economy, must sell their labor for wages. Conflict theories draw attention to power differentials, such as class, gender and race conflict, and contrast historically dominant ideologies. It is therefore a macro level analysis of society that sees society as an arena of inequality that generates conflict and social change.&lt;ref name="Sociology"/&gt; Karl Marx is the father of the [[social conflict theory]], which is a component of the four major paradigms of sociology.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} Other important sociologists associated with this theory include [[Harriet Martineau]], [[Jane Addams]] and [[W. E. B. Du Bois]]. This sociological approach doesn't look at how social structures help society to operate, but instead looks at how "social patterns" can cause some people in society to be dominant, and others to be oppressed.&lt;ref name="Sociology 7th Canadian Ed"/&gt; However, some criticisms to this theory are that it disregards how shared values and the way in which people rely on each other help to unify the society.&lt;ref name="Sociology 7th Canadian Ed"/&gt;

===Symbolic interactionism===
{{Main|Symbolic interactionism|Dramaturgy (sociology)|Interpretive sociology|Phenomenological sociology}}
[[Symbolic interaction]], often associated with [[interactionism]], [[phenomenological sociology]], [[dramaturgy]], and [[Antipositivism|interpretivism]], is a sociological tradition that places emphasis on subjective meanings and the empirical unfolding of social processes, generally accessed through analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Macionis, John J. (2012). Sociology 14th Edition. Boston: Pearson. p. 16. {{ISBN|978-0-205-11671-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The approach focuses on creating a framework for building a theory that sees society as the product of the everyday interactions of individuals. Society is nothing more than the shared reality that people construct as they interact with one another. This approach sees people interacting in countless settings using symbolic communications to accomplish the tasks at hand. Therefore, society is a complex, ever-changing mosaic of subjective meanings.&lt;ref&gt;Gerber, John J. Macionis, Linda M. ''Sociology'' (7th Canadian ed. ed.). Toronto: Pearson Canada. p. 19. {{ISBN|978-0-13-700161-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Some critics of this approach argue that it only looks at what is happening in a particular social situation, and disregards the effects that culture, race or gender (i.e. social-historical structures) may have in that situation.&lt;ref name="Sociology 7th Canadian Ed"/&gt; Some important sociologists associated with this approach include [[Max Weber]], [[George Herbert Mead]], [[Erving Goffman]], [[George Homans]] and [[Peter Blau]]. It is also in this tradition that the radical-empirical approach of [[Ethnomethodology]] emerges from the work of [[Harold Garfinkel]].

===Utilitarianism===
{{Main| Utilitarianism|Rational choice theory|Exchange theory}}
 
Utilitarianism is often referred to as [[exchange theory]] or [[rational choice theory]] in the context of sociology. This tradition tends to privilege the agency of individual rational actors and assumes that within interactions individuals always seek to maximize their own self-interest. As argued by [[Josh Whitford]], rational actors are assumed to have four basic elements, the individual has (1) "a knowledge of alternatives," (2) "a knowledge of, or beliefs about the consequences of the various alternatives," (3) "an ordering of preferences over outcomes," (4) "A decision rule, to select amongst the possible alternatives".&lt;ref&gt;"Pragmatism and the untenable dualism of means and ends: Why rational choice theory does not deserve paradigmatic privilege" Theory and Society 31 (2002): 325-363.&lt;/ref&gt; Exchange theory is specifically attributed to the work of [[George C. Homans]], [[Peter Blau]] and [[Richard Emerson]].&lt;ref&gt;Emerson, R M. "Social Exchange Theory." Annual Review of Sociology 2.1 (1976): 335-362.&lt;/ref&gt; Organizational sociologists [[James G. March]] and [[Herbert A. Simon]] noted that an individual's [[bounded rationality|rationality is bounded]] by the context or organizational setting. The utilitarian perspective in sociology was, most notably, revitalized in the late 20th century by the work of former [[American Sociological Association|ASA]] president [[James Samuel Coleman|James Coleman]].

==List of contemporary theories==

[[Anomie theory]] seeks to understand ''[[normlessness]]'', where society provides little moral guidance to individuals.&lt;ref name="Macionis, Gerber 2010 pp. 134"/&gt; Sociologist Emile Durkheim observed that social periods of disruption result in greater anomie and higher rates of suicide and crimes.&lt;ref name="sociology13"/&gt; Merton theorizes that [[anomie]] (normative breakdown) and some forms of [[Deviance (sociology)|deviant behavior]] derive largely from a disjunction between “culturally prescribed aspirations” of a society and “socially structured avenues for realizing those aspirations". In ''[[The Division of Labor in Society]]'', [[Durkheim]] described [[anomie]] as one result of an inequitable division of labour within the society. Broadly speaking, then, during times of great upheaval, increasing numbers of individuals "cease to accept the moral legitimacy of society,” as sociologist Anthony R. Mawson, University of Keele, UK, notes.&lt;ref name="sociology13"/&gt;

[[Critical theory]] is a lineage of sociological theory, with reference to such groups as the Frankfurt School, that aims to critique and change society and culture, not simply to document and understand it.&lt;ref name="sociology9"/&gt;

[[Dramaturgy (sociology)|Dramaturgy]] or dramaturgical perspective is a specialized symbolic interactionism paradigm developed by [[Erving Goffman]], seeing life as a performance. As "actors," we have a status, which is the part that we play, where we are given various roles.&lt;ref name="Macionis, Gerber 2010 pp. 16"/&gt; These roles serve as a script, supplying dialogue and action for the characters (the people in reality).&lt;ref name="sociology10"/&gt; They also involve props and certain settings. For instance, a doctor (the role), uses instruments like a heart monitor (the prop), all the while using medical terms (the script), while in his doctor's office (the setting).&lt;ref name="Macionis, Gerber 2010 pp. 134"/&gt; In addition, our performance is the "presentation of self," which is how people perceive us, based on the ways in which we portray ourselves.&lt;ref name="sociology11"/&gt; This process, sometimes called impression management, begins with the idea of personal performance.&lt;ref name="dramaturgical"/&gt;

[[Engaged theory]] is an approach that seeks to understand the complexity of social life through synthesizing empirical research with more abstract layers of analysis, including analysis of modes of practice, and analysis of basic categories of existence such a time, space, embodiment, and knowledge.

[[Feminism]] is a collection of movements aimed at defining, establishing, and defending equal political, economic, and social rights for women.&lt;ref name="Feminism – Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary"/&gt; The theory focuses on how [[gender inequality]] shapes social life.&lt;ref name="New Feminist Sociological Directions"/&gt; This approach shows how sexuality both reflects patterns of [[social inequality]] and helps to perpetuate them. Feminism, from a [[social conflict]] perspective, focuses on gender inequality and links sexuality to the domination of women by men.&lt;ref name="Sociology5"/&gt;

[[Field theory (sociology)|Field theory]] examines social fields, which are social environments in which competition takes place (e.g., the field of electronics manufacturers). It is concerned with how individuals construct such fields, with how the fields are structured, and with the effects the field has on people occupying different positions in it.

[[Grounded theory]] is a systematic methodology in the social sciences involving the generation of theory from data.&lt;ref name="fsu"/&gt;

[[Interpretive sociology]] is a theoretical perspective based on the work of Max Weber, proposes that social, economic and historical research can never be fully empirical or descriptive as one must always approach it with a conceptual apparatus.&lt;ref name="Gerber, John J 2010 pp. 132"/&gt;

[[Middle range theory (sociology)|Middle range theory]] is an approach to sociological theorizing aimed at integrating theory and empirical research. It is currently the de facto dominant approach to sociological theory construction, especially in the United States. Middle range theory starts with an empirical phenomenon (as opposed to a broad abstract entity like the social system) and abstracts from it to create general statements that can be verified by data.&lt;ref name="structure"/&gt;

[[Mathematical sociology|Mathematical theory]], also known as formal theory, is the use of [[mathematics]] to construct social theories. Mathematical sociology aims to take sociological theory, which is strong in intuitive content but weak from a formal point of view, and to express it in formal terms. The benefits of this approach include increased clarity and the ability to use mathematics to derive implications of a theory that cannot be arrived at intuitively. The models typically used in mathematical sociology allow sociologists to understand how predictable local interactions are often able to elicit global patterns of social structure.&lt;ref name="formalization"/&gt;

[[Positivism]] is a philosophy developed by [[Auguste Comte]] in the middle of the 19th century that stated that the only authentic knowledge is [[scientific knowledge]], and that such knowledge can only come from positive affirmation of theories through strict [[scientific method]].&lt;ref name="educational"/&gt; Society operates according to laws like the physical world. Introspective and [[intuitional]] attempts to gain knowledge are rejected. The positivist approach has been a recurrent theme in the history of [[western thought]], from ancient times to the present day.

[[Network theory]] is a structural approach to sociology that is most closely associated with the work of [[Harrison White]], who views norms and behaviors as embedded in chains of social relations.&lt;ref name="Gerber, John J 2010 pp. 132"/&gt;

[[Phenomenological sociology]] is an approach within the field of sociology that aims to reveal what role human awareness plays in the production of social action, social situations and social worlds. In essence, phenomenology is the belief that society is a human construction. The social phenomenology of [[Alfred Schütz]] influenced the development of the [[social constructionism]] and [[ethnomethodology]]. It was originally developed by [[Edmund Husserl]].

[[Post-colonial theory]] is a post-modern approach that consists of the reactions to and the analysis of colonialism.

[[Postmodernism]] is a theoretical perspective approach that criticises [[modernism]], instead adhering to anti-theory and anti-method, and has a great mistrust of [[Grand theory|grand theories]] and ideologies. Due to human subjectivity, theorists believe that discovering the objective truth is impossible or unachievable.&lt;ref name="MacionisandGerber2011-10"/&gt; This is due to a perspective that sees society as ever-changing along with the assumption that truth is constantly subject to change. A post-modern theorist's purpose is to achieve understanding through observation, rather than data collection. This approach uses both micro and macro level analysis.&lt;ref name="Macionis, Gerber 2010 53"/&gt; A question that is asked by this approach would be, "How do we understand societies or interpersonal relations, while rejecting the theories and methods of the social sciences, and our assumptions about human nature? or How does power permeate social relations or society, and change with the circumstances? "&lt;ref name="sociology10"/&gt; An example of a prominent postmodernist is the French philosopher [[Michael Foucault]].

[[Pure sociology]] is a theoretical paradigm developed by [[Donald Black (sociologist)|Donald Black]] that explains variation in social life with [[social geometry]], that is, locations in social space. A recent extension of this idea is that fluctuations in social space — called social time — are the cause of social conflict.&lt;ref name="Black, Donald 2011"/&gt;

[[Rational choice theory]] models social behavior as the interaction of utility maximizing individuals. "Rational" implies cost-effectiveness is balanced against cost to accomplish a utility maximizing interaction. Costs are extrinsic, meaning intrinsic values such as feelings of guilt will not be accounted for in the cost to commit a crime.

[[Social constructionism]] is a sociological theory of knowledge that considers how social phenomena develop in particular social contexts.&lt;ref name="interpretive"/&gt;

[[Socialization]] theory is an approach to understanding the means by which human infants begin to acquire the skills necessary to perform as a functional member of their society&lt;ref name="sociological"/&gt; Sociologists use the term socialization to refer to the lifelong social experience by which people develop their human potential and learn culture. Unlike other living species, humans need socialization within their cultures for survival.&lt;ref name="Macionis, John J. 2011"/&gt;

[[Social exchange theory]] says that the interaction that occurs between people can be partly based on what someone may "gain and lose" by being with others. For example, when people think about who they may date, they'll look to see if the other person will offer just as much (or perhaps more) than they do. This can include judging an individual's looks and appearance, or their social status.&lt;ref name="Sociology 7th Canadian Ed"/&gt;

[[Thomas theorem]] refers to situations that are defined as real are real in their consequences.&lt;ref name="contemporary"/&gt; Suggests that the reality people construct in their interaction has real consequences for the future. For example, a teacher who believes a certain student to be intellectually gifted may well encourage exceptional academic performance.&lt;ref name="organizational"/&gt;

==Theories in subfields of sociology==

===Criminology===
[[File:Scale of justice 2.svg|thumb|left|200px|alt=text|'''Criminology''' - The scientific study of crime and criminals]]
{{Main|Criminology}}
* The general [[theory of crime]]: States that the main factor behind criminal behaviour is the individual's lack of [[self-control]].
* [[Differential association]] theory: The theory was developed by [[Edwin Sutherland]] and it examines the acts of a criminal from the perspective that they are learned behaviours.&lt;ref name="Sociology 7th Canadian Ed37"/&gt;
* [[Labeling theory]]: It is the main idea that deviance and conformity result not so much from what people do as from how others respond to these actions.&lt;ref name="Macionis and Gerber 2010 203"/&gt; It also states that a society's reaction to specific behaviors are a major determinant of how a person may come to adopt a "deviant" label.&lt;ref name="Sociology 7th Canadian Ed38"/&gt; This theory stresses the relativity of deviance, the idea that people may define the same behavior in any number of ways. Thus the labelling theory is a micro-level analysis and is often classified in the social-interactionist approach.&lt;ref name="Macionis and Gerber 2010 203"/&gt; Bryant, Lee. [http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/labelling_theory.htm "The Labelling Theory"], History Learning Site, 2000-2012, retrieved March 13, 2013.
* [[Control theory]]: The theory was developed by [[Travis Hirschi]] and it states that a weak bond between an individual and society itself allows the individual to defy societal norms and adopt behaviors that are deviant in nature.&lt;ref name="Sociology 7th Canadian Ed39"/&gt;
* [[Rational choice theory]]: States that people commit crimes when it is rational for them to do so according to analyses of costs and benefits, and that crime can be reduced by minimizing benefits and maximizing costs to the "would be" criminal.
* [[Social disorganization theory]]: States that crime is more likely to occur in areas where social institutions are unable to directly control groups of individuals.
* [[Social learning theory]]: States that people adopt new behaviors through observational learning in their environments.&lt;ref name="psychology"/&gt;
* [[Strain theory (sociology)|Strain theory]]: States that a social structure within a society may cause people to commit crimes. Specifically, the extent and type of deviance people engage in depend on whether a society provides the means to achieve cultural goals.&lt;ref name="Sociology 14th Edition"/&gt;
* [[Subcultural theory]]: States that behavior is influenced by factors such as class, ethnicity, and family status. This theory's primary focus is on juvenile delinquency.
* [[Psychopath]]: serious criminals who do not feel shame or guilt from their actions. They do not fear punishment and have little sympathy for the people they harm.&lt;ref name="Sociology 7th Canadian Ed40"/&gt; These individuals are said to have a psychological disorder as psychopathy or antisocial personality disorder. They exhibit a variety of maladaptive traits such as rarely experiencing genuine affection for others. They are skilled at faking affection, are irresponsible, impulsive, tolerate little frustration and they pursue immediate gratification.&lt;ref name="Psychology themes &amp; variations 2nd Canadian Ed"/&gt; Robert Hare, one of the world's leading experts on psychopathy, developed an important assessment device for psychopathy, the Psychopathy Checklist-Revised. For many, this measure is the single, most important advancement to date toward what will hopefully become our ultimate understanding of psychopathy (McCann, Weiten, 641).
* [[Containment theory]]: when an individual has a stronger conscience it will make one more tolerable to frustrations and therefore are less likely to be involved in criminal activities.&lt;ref name="Macionis, Gerber 2010 198–199"/&gt;
* [[White-collar crime]]: defined by [[Edwin Sutherland]] as crime committed by persons of high social position in the course of their occupation (Sutherland and Cressey, 1978:44).&lt;ref name="Macionis, Gerber 2010 206"/&gt; The white-collar crime involves people making use of their occupational position to enrich themselves and others illegally, which often causes public harm.&lt;ref name="Macionis, Gerber 2010 206"/&gt; In white-collar crime, public harm wreaked by false advertising, marketing of unsafe products, embezzlement, and bribery of public officials is more extensive than most people think, most of which go unnoticed and unpunished.&lt;ref name="Macionis and Gerber 2010 206"/&gt;
* [[Corporate crime]]: refers to the illegal actions of a corporation or people acting on its behalf. Corporate crime ranges from knowingly selling faulty or dangerous products to purposely polluting the environment. Like white-collar crime, most cases of corporate crime go unpunished, and many are not never even known to the public.&lt;ref name="Macionis and Gerber 2010 206"/&gt;
* [[Organized crime]]: a business that supplies illegal goods or services, including sex, drugs, and gambling.&lt;ref name="Macionis, Gerber 2010 206"/&gt; This type of crime expanded among immigrants, who found that society was not always willing to share its opportunities with them.&lt;ref name="Macionis and Gerber 2010 206"/&gt; A famous example of organized crime is the [[Italian Mafia]].&lt;ref name="Macionis and Gerber 2010 206"/&gt;
* [[Hate crime]]: a criminal act against a person or a person's property by an offender motivated by racial, ethnic, religious or other bias. Hate crimes may refer to race, ancestry, religion, sexual orientation and physical disabilities. According to a [[Statistics Canada]] publication, "Jewish" community has been the most likely the victim of [[hate crime in Canada]] during 2001-2002. Overall, about 57 percent of hate crimes are motivated by ethnicity and race, targeting mainly Blacks and Asians, while 43 percent target religion, mainly Judaism and Islam. A relatively small 9 percent is motivated by sexual orientation, targets gays and lesbians.&lt;ref name="Sociology 7th Canadian Ed41"/&gt;

Physical traits do not distinguish criminals from non criminals, but genetic factors together with environmental factors are strong [[Crime prediction|predictors]] of adult crime and violence.&lt;ref name="Macionis, Gerber 2010 198–199"/&gt; Most psychologists see deviance as the result of "unsuccessful" socialization and abnormality in an individual personality.&lt;ref name="Macionis, Gerber 2010 198–199"/&gt;

===Sociology of science and technology===
{{Main|Sociology of scientific knowledge}}
Sociologists have been active in developing theories about the nature of science and technology:
* "Institutional" sociology of science ([[Robert K. Merton]]) (1960s)
* [[Social construction of technology]] (1980s) − variant of SSK focusing on technology studies
* [[Actor-network theory]] (1980s)
* [[Normalization process theory]] (2000s)
* [[Theories of technology]]

===Social movements===
[[File:Martin Luther King - March on Washington.jpg|thumb|250px|alt=text|[[American Civil Rights Movement]] is one of the most famous social movements of the 20th century. Here, [[Martin Luther King]] is giving his "[[I Have a Dream]]" speech, in front of the [[Lincoln Memorial]] during the 1963 [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom]]]]
{{Main|Social movement}}
Sociologists have developed various theories about social movements [Kendall, 2005]. Chronologically (by approximate date of origin) they include:
* [[Collective behavior]]/[[collective action]] theories (1950s)
* [[Relative deprivation theory]] (1960s)
* [[Value-added theory]] (1960s)
* [[Resource mobilization]]/[[political process]] theory (1970s)
* [[Framing (social sciences)|Frame analysis theory]] (1970s)
* [[New social movement theory]] (1980s)
* New [[cultural theory]] (1990s) — [[James M. Jasper]], [[Jeff Goodwin]] et al.

'''Tamil South Africans''' are South Africans of [[Tamil people|Tamil]] descent. Tamil people form the majority of Indian immigrants who came from [[India]] to [[Colony of Natal|Natal, South Africa]], from 1860 onwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sahistory.org.za/article/indian-south-africans|title=Indian South Africans|first=|last=sahoboss|date=21 March 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the expiry of their indentures most of these Indians moved to the cities, becoming established as a thoroughly urban population.&lt;ref name=AD/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://scnc.ukzn.ac.za/doc/SHIP/caste.html |title= Caste and Religions of Natal Immigrants |author= K. Chetty |publisher=Gandhi-Luthuli Documentation Centre |accessdate=2007-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arrival in South Africa==
In 1833, the British Parliament passed the Act of Abolition, which banned slavery throughout the British Empire. The consequence of this was that many African slaves in the Colony of Natal decided to desert their former masters. The former masters, lacking sufficient labour force, persuaded the skeptical British authorities in India to implement the system of indentured labour in Natal. On November 16, 1860, 342 men, women and children arrived aboard the S.S. ''Truro'' in Port Natal (Durban).

==Apartheid==
[[Apartheid]] alienated all Indians as disenfranchised ''non-whites'', and [[Hinduism in South Africa|Hinduism]] in particular was perceived by many whites as antithetical to [[Christianity]]. The imposition of apartheid system also curtailed the opportunities for improvement and included the forced removals program, causing great disruption and social hardship.&lt;ref name=AD/&gt;

==Integration==
Over the 150 years of residence in South Africa, participation in religion and its many festivals has brought devotees a valuable sense of identity and solidarity, especially in the light of their marginalization and the discrimination experienced under the apartheid system. A recent resurgence of interest in indigenous Tamil festivals seems to reflect a variety of religious, social and political concerns.&lt;ref name=AD&gt;{{cite conference | first = Alleyn | last = Diesel | title = Tamil Hindus in KawZulu-Natal (South Africa): History, Identity and the Establishment of Their Place in the New South Africa |booktitle = Proceedings from the International Association for the History of Religions | publisher = International Association for the History of Religions (IAHR), | year= 2000 | location = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In South Africa, the Tamil community tend to refer to their religion as "Tamil", rather than Hindu, although this blurring of the distinctions between religion and language also occurs with other Hindu ethnic groups in South Africa.&lt;ref name="Bongmba2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Elias Kifon Bongmba|title=The Wiley-Blackwell Companion to African Religions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JFRRl1vv0kwC&amp;pg=PA393|date=21 May 2012|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-4051-9690-1|pages=393–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
South African Tamils are said to be the most educated people group in the world with an average of (3.6 pHDs per 100 People).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jagranjosh.com/current-affairs/five-indian-languages-reinstated-as-official-subjects-in-south-african-schools-1395392591-1|title=Five Indian languages reinstated as official subjects in South African schools|date=21 March 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kzneducation.gov.za/Portals/0/Circuiars/General/2014/MERCURY%20(First%20Edition)%20-%20p.3%20-%2011%20Mar%202014.pdf|title=five indian languages - Kwazulu - Natal Education Ministry|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Festivals==
"Purataasi" is the Tamil month from mid-September to mid-October and is a period dedicated to Lord Vishnu.The entire period of Purataasi is observed with the abstention of meat, sexual pleasures and intoxicants. The main prayer in every Tamil-cultured home is held on any of the four Saturdays during the period and much effort is put into this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ulwazi.org/index.php5?title=Purtuassi_in_Durban|title=Ulwazi - Top Product Reviews 2018|website=Ulwazi Wiki}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tamil Community in South Africa also observe the Mariamman Festival in the Aadi Month which falls between mid-July and mid-August. Due to the fact that Maize Meal forms a large part in the Mariamman worship this prayer is usually referred to as "Porridge Prayers" by the locals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ulwazi.org/index.php5?title=The_Mariamman_Festival_in_Durban,_KwaZulu_Natal|title=Ulwazi - Top Product Reviews 2018|website=Ulwazi Wiki}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kavadi is another famous festival among the Tamil community amongst the Tamil Community in South Africa. Such an example is the Melrose Sri Siva Subramaniar Alayam in Johannesburg that was first a steel temple dedicated to Lord Muruga and was built in 1890 and today attracts thousands of devotees during the [[Thaipusam|Thai Poosam]] festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ulwazi.org/index.php5?title=Kavady_Festival|title=Ulwazi - Top Product Reviews 2018|website=Ulwazi Wiki}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Thirty Meter Telescope protests''' are a series of protests and demonstrations that began on the [[Island of Hawaii]] in the United States over the choosing of [[Mauna Kea]] for the site location of the [[Thirty Meter Telescope]]. Mauna Kea is considered the most sacred mountain of Native [[Hawaiian religion]] and culture. Protests began locally within the state of Hawaii on October 7, 2014 but went global within weeks of the April 2, 2015 arrest of 31 people who had blockaded the roadway to keep construction crews off the summit.

The TMT, a ground-based, large [[segmented mirror]] [[reflecting telescope]] grew from astronomers' prioritization in 2000 of a thirty-meter telescope to be built within the decade. Mauna Kea was announced as TMT's preferred site in 2009. Opposition to the project began shortly after the announcement of Mauna Kea as the chosen site out of 5 proposals. While opposition against the observatories on Mauna Kea has been ongoing since the first telescope this protest may be the most vocal. The project was expected to be completed by 2024, nearly simultaneously with the 39-meter [[Extremely Large Telescope]] being built in Chile however, on December 2, 2015, the [[Supreme Court of Hawaii]] invalidated the TMT's building permits. The court ruled that [[due process]] was not followed. The TMT corporation then removed all construction equipment and vehicles from Mauna Kea, and re-applied for a new permit, meant to respect the Supreme Court's ruling.  This was granted on September 28, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maunakeaandtmt.org/hawaii-board-of-land-and-natural-resources-approves-conservation-district-use-permit-to-build-tmt-on-maunakea/|title=Hawaii Board of Land and Natural Resources Approves Conservation District Use Permit to Build TMT on Maunakea|date=Sep 29, 2017|accessdate=Nov 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bigislandnow.com/2017/09/28/hawaii-blnr-approved-tmt-permit/|title=Hawai‘i BLNR Approves TMT Permit|website=Big Island Now|date=September 28, 2017|accessdate=November 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On October 30, 2018, the Court validated the new construction permit.&lt;ref name="bbc201810313"&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-46046864 Hawaii top court approves controversial Thirty Meter Telescope] BBC News, 2018-10-31.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
{{main|Opposition to the Mauna Kea Observatories}}

===Development of Mauna Kea observatories===
After studying photos for NASA's [[Apollo program]] that contained greater detail than any ground based telescope, [[Gerard Kuiper]] began seeking an arid site for infrared studies.&lt;ref name="Zirker2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Inc.1964"&gt;{{cite book|author=Educational Foundation for Nuclear Science, Inc.|title=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8gcAAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA35|date=November 1964|publisher=Educational Foundation for Nuclear Science, Inc.|page=35|issn=0096-3402}}&lt;/ref&gt; While he first began looking in Chile, he also made the decision to perform tests in the Hawaiian Islands. Tests on [[Maui]]'s [[Haleakalā]] were promising but the mountain was too low in the inversion layer and often covered by clouds. On the "Big Island" of Hawaii, Mauna Kea is considered the highest island mountain in the world. While the summit is often covered with snow the air itself is extremely dry.&lt;ref name="Zirker2005" /&gt; Kuiper began looking into the possibility of an observatory on Mauna Kea. After testing, he discovered the low humidity was perfect for infrared signals. He persuaded then Governor, [[John A. Burns]] to bulldoze a dirt road to the summit where he built a small telescope on Pu{{okina}}u Poli{{okina}}ahu, a cinder cone peak.&lt;ref name="Zirker2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Yount1996"&gt;{{cite book|author=David Yount|title=Who Runs the University?: The Politics of Higher Education in Hawaii, 1985-1992|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZtnBE9CcxOAC&amp;pg=PA232|date=1 January 1996|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|isbn=978-0-8248-1821-0|page=232}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Astronomy Now|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CB7yAAAAMAAJ|year=1991|publisher=Intra Press|page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; The peak was the second highest on the mountain with the highest peak being holy ground, so Kuiper avoided it.&lt;ref name="PARKER2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Barry R. PARKER|title=Stairway to the Stars: The Story of the World’s Largest Observatory|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RbkACAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA25|date=11 November 2013|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-4899-6052-8|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Next, Kuiper tried enlisting NASA to fund a larger facility with a large telescope, housing and other needed structures. NASA, in turn decided to make the project open to competition. Professor of physics, John Jefferies of the [[University of Hawaii]] placed a bid on behalf of the university.&lt;ref name="Zirker2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Leverington2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=David Leverington|title=A History of Astronomy: from 1890 to the Present|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r47qBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA276|date=6 December 2012|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-1-4471-2124-4|page=276}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KaminsPotter1998"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Robert M. Kamins|author2=Robert E. Potter|author3=University of Hawaii (System)|title=Måalamalama: A History of the University of Hawai'i|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q8jyzfUmFvgC&amp;pg=PA211|date=January 1998|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|isbn=978-0-8248-2006-0|pages=210–211}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jefferies had gained his reputation through observations at [[Sacramento Peak Observatory]]. The proposal was for a two-meter telescope to serve both the needs of NASA and the university. While large telescopes are not ordinarily awarded to universities without well established astronomers, Jefferies and UH were awarded the NASA contract infuriating Kuiper who felt that "his mountain" had been "stolen" from "him".&lt;ref name="Zirker2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Tatarewicz1990"&gt;{{cite book|author=Joseph N. Tatarewicz|title=Space Technology &amp; Planetary Astronomy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MnXQtlBcRFIC&amp;pg=PA82|year=1990|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=0-253-35655-5|page=82}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kuiper would abandon his site (the very first telecope on Mauna Kea) over the competition and begin work in Arizona on a different NASA project. After considerable testing by Jefferies' team, the best locations were determined to be near the summit at the top of the cinder cones. Testing also determined Mauna Kea to be superb for nighttime viewing due to many factors including the thin air, constant trade winds and being surrounded by sea. Jefferies would build a 2.24 meter telescope with the State of Hawaii agreeing to build a reliable, all weather roadway to the summit. Building began in 1967 and first light seen in 1970.&lt;ref name="Zirker2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=J. B. Zirker|title=An Acre of Glass: A History and Forecast of the Telescope|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TYYVXIePsy4C&amp;pg=PA94|date=18 October 2005|publisher=JHU Press|isbn=978-0-8018-8234-0|pages=89–95}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Observatory opposition===
Opposition to the observatories has existed since 1964.&lt;ref name=Forbes&gt;{{cite news|last1=Knapp|first1=Alex|title=Understanding The Thirty Meter Telescope Controversy|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexknapp/2015/06/12/understanding-the-thirty-meter-telescope-controversy/|accessdate=5 August 2015|agency=Forbes|publisher=Forbes|date=Jun 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Honolulu, the governor and legislature, enthusiastic about the development, set aside an even larger area for the observatory causing opposition in the city of [[Hilo, Hawaii|Hilo]]. Native [[kānaka ʻōiwi]] believed the entire site was sacred and that developing the mountain, even for science, would spoil the area. Environmentalists were concerned about rare native bird populations and other citizens of Hilo were concerned about the sight of the domes from the city. Using town hall meetings, Jefferies was able to overcome opposition by weighing the economic advantage and prestige the island would receive.&lt;ref name="Zirker2005" /&gt;Over the years, the opposition to the observatories may have become the most visible example of the conflict science has encountered over access and use of environmental and culturally significant sites.&lt;ref name="DearKetchum2011"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Michael Dear|author2=Jim Ketchum|author3=Sarah Luria |author4=Doug Richardson |title=GeoHumanities: Art, History, Text at the Edge of Place|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zwrJBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT476|date=13 April 2011|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-88347-7|page=476}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opposition to development grew shortly after expansion of the observatories commenced. Once access was opened up by the roadway to the summit, skiers began using it for recreation and objected when the road was closed as a precaution against vandalism when the telescopes were being built. Hunters voiced concerns as did the Hawaiian [[Audubon Society]] who were supported by Governor [[George Ariyoshi]].&lt;ref name="PARKER2013b"&gt;{{cite book|author=Barry R. PARKER|title=Stairway to the Stars: The Story of the World’s Largest Observatory|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RbkACAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA56|date=11 November 2013|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-4899-6052-8|page=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Audubon Society objected to further development on Mauna Kea over concerns to habitat of the endangered [[palila]], an [[endemic]] species to only specific parts of this mountain. The bird is the last of the finch billed honeycreepers existing on the island. Over 50% of native bird species had been killed off due to loss of habitat from early western settlers or the introduction of non native species competing for resources. Hunters and sportsmen were concerned that the hunting of feral animals would be affected by the telescope operations.&lt;ref name="Gordon2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mark Gordon|title=Recollections of "Tucson Operations": The Millimeter-Wave Observatory of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iWPbIrwEKpMC&amp;pg=PA136|date=18 July 2007|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-1-4020-3236-3|pages=136–140}}&lt;/ref&gt; A "Save Mauna Kea" movement was inspired by the proliferation of telescopes with opposition believing development of the mountain to be sacrilegious.&lt;ref name="Oaks2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert F. Oaks|title=Hawaii:: A History of the Big Island|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HDVNJ5wzcisC&amp;pg=PA131|date=1 November 2003|publisher=Arcadia Publishing|isbn=978-1-4396-1403-7|page=131}}&lt;/ref&gt; Native Hawaiian non-profit groups such as [[Kahea]], whose goals are the protection of cultural heritage and the environment, oppose development on Mauna Kea as a sacred space to the Hawaiian religion.&lt;ref name="Kaufman2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ned Kaufman|title=Place, Race, and Story: Essays on the Past and Future of Historic Preservation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5fCTAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA14|date=11 September 2009|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-135-88972-2|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, Mauna Kea hosts the world's largest location for telescope observations in infrared and submillimeter astronomy. The land itself is protected by the US Historical Preservation Act due to its significance to Hawaiian culture but still allowed development.&lt;ref name="Schachter2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Judith Schachter|title=The Legacies of a Hawaiian Generation: From Territorial Subject to American Citizen|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OTTUAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA43|date=15 September 2013|publisher=Berghahn Books|isbn=978-1-78238-012-2|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Outrigger telescopes===
Further development of the Mauna Kea observatories is still opposed by environmental groups and Native Hawaiians. A 2006 proposal for the [[Navy Precision Optical Interferometer|Outrigger Telescopes]] to become extensions of the [[Keck Observatory]] was canceled after a judges determination that a full environmental impact statement must be prepared before any further development of the site.&lt;ref name="Campbell2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jeff Campbell|title=Hawaii|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TRXR69wo-rYC&amp;pg=PA97|date=15 September 2010|publisher=Lonely Planet|isbn=978-1-74220-344-7|page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "outrigger" would have linked the [[Keck I]] and [[Keck II]] telescopes. Environmental groups and Native Hawaiian activist were a lot stronger at this time than in the past but NASA went ahead with the proposal for lack of an alternate site. The group ''Mauna Kea Anaina Hou'' made several arguments against the development including that Mauna Kea was a sacred mountain to Native Hawaiians where many deities had lived, and that the cinder cone being proposed as the site was holy in Hawaiian tradition as a burial site for a demi-god. The group raised several other concerns such as environmental over native insects, the question of [[Ceded lands]] and an audit report, critical of the mountain's management.&lt;ref name="Takahashi2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Patrick Kenji Takahashi|title=Simple Solutions for Humanity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sNBF9eqXUzYC&amp;pg=PA164|date=29 February 2008|publisher=AuthorHouse|isbn=978-1-4678-3517-6|page=164}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thirty Meter Telescope proposal===
[[File:Kealoha Pisciotta.JPG|left|thumb|Kealoha Pisciotta, a former Mauna Kea Observatory employee, testifies at a State hearing in 2011]]
The Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT) is a proposed extremely large, segmented mirror telescope, planned for the summit of Mauna Kea. It is now the focal point of further development of the observatory site, with a current ongoing legal battle in the Hawaii court system. The proposal continues to spawn a great deal of controversy over the use of the site for science.&lt;ref name="Fullagar2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kate Fullagar|title=The Atlantic World in the Antipodes: Effects and Transformations since the Eighteenth Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ET4sBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA71|date=15 March 2012|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|isbn=978-1-4438-3806-1|pages=70–71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The TMT project is a response to recommendation in 2000 from the [[US National Academy of Sciences]] that a thirty-meter telescope be a top priority, and that it be built within the decade.&lt;ref name="LobanovZensus2007"&gt;{{cite book|author1=A.P.

As of April, 2015, two separate legal appeals were still pending.&lt;ref name=NPR&gt;{{cite news|last1=Solomon|first1=Molly|title=Construction Of Giant Telescope In Hawaii Draws Natives' Ire|url=https://www.npr.org/2015/04/21/400390724/construction-of-giant-telescope-in-hawaii-draws-natives-ire|agency=National Public Radio|publisher=NPR|date=April 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1998 study ''Mauna Kea Science Reserve and Hale Pohaku Complex Development Plan Update'' stated that "... nearly all the interviewees and all others who participated in the consultation process (Appendices B and C) called for a moratorium on any further development on the summit of Mauna Kea".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.envirowatch.org/MKoverview.htm |title=overview of info |work= Mauna Kea Science Reserve and Hale Pohaku Complex Development Plan Update:|accessdate=April 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Native Hawaiians and environmentalists are opposed to any further telescopes.&lt;ref name="Huliau" /&gt;

The [[Hawai'i Department of Land and Natural Resources|Hawaii Board of Land and Natural Resources]] conditionally approved the Mauna Kea site for the TMT in February 2011. While the approval has been challenged, the Board officially approved the site following a hearing on April 12, 2013.&lt;ref name="news1"&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.3news.co.nz/Massive-telescope-to-be-built-in-Hawaii/tabid/1160/articleID/294296/Default.aspx|work=3 News NZ |title= Massive telescope to be built in Hawaii| date=April 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indigenous peoples rights===
The issue of native peoples, their religious freedom and rights in regards to authority for large science-based projects has become a major issue to contend with. [[Mt. Graham]] had an issue with the sanctity of the mountain raised by activists. Observatories have succeeded in being built, but only after protracted and expensive litigation and effort.

==Blockade and protests==
[[File:Joshua Lanakila Mangauil, Thirty Meter Telescope protest, October 7, 2014.jpg|thumb|Hawaiian [[Cultural practice|cultural practitioner]], Joshua Lanakila Mangauil interrupted the TMT ground breaking on October 7, 2014]]

===Roadway blockade and ground breaking interruption===
On October 7, 2014 the groundbreaking for the telescope was being live streamed via webcam. The proceedings were interrupted when the official caravan encountered several dozen demonstrators picketing and chanting in the middle of the roadway. A planned ceremony at the base of the mountain was scheduled by the group, ''Mauna Kea Anaina Hou'', in opposition of the telescope&lt;ref name="Kelleher" /&gt; and in a press release dated that day, the organization Sacred Mauna Kea stated: "Native Hawaiians and non-Hawaiians will gather for a peaceful protest against the Astronomy industry and the State of Hawaii’s ground-breaking ceremony for a thirty-meter telescope (TMT) on the summit of Mauna Kea."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sacred Mauna Kea|title=Press Release: Hawaiians Protest 30-meter telescope on Mauna Kea, October 7th|url=http://dgrnewsservice.org/2014/10/07/press-release-hawaiians-protest-30-meter-telescope-on-mauna-kea-october-7th/|accessdate=23 April 2015|agency=Deep Green Resistance News Service|publisher=[[Deep Green Resistance]] News Service|date=October 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several members traveled up the mountain and were stopped by police, where they laid down in the road and blocked the caravan. The nonviolent protest did not stop or block any people but when the ceremony for the ground breaking began, protesters interrupted the blessing, stopping the proceedings as well as the groundbreaking.&lt;ref name="Kelleher"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kelleher|first1=Jennifer Sinco|title=Protesters halt Mauna Kea telescope groundbreaking|url=http://www.staradvertiser.com/news/breaking/20141007_Groundbreaking_delayed_for_Hawaii_telescope.html?id=278448831|accessdate=4 April 2015|agency=Honolulu Star Advertiser|publisher=staradvertiser.com|date=October 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

That same day in California, protesters demonstrated outside the headquarters of the [[Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation]] in [[Palo Alto, CA]].&lt;ref name=Mai&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mai|first1=E.

===Second Mauna Kea blockade and arrests, 2015===
Beginning in late March 2015 demonstrators halted construction crews near the visitors center, again by blocking access of the road to the summit of the mountain. Heavy equipment had already been placed near the site. Daniel Meisenzahl, a spokesman for the University of Hawaii, stated that the 5 tractors trailers of equipment that were moved up the mountain the day before had alerted protesters that began organizing the demonstrations. Kamahana Kealoha of the group Sacred Mauna Kea stated that over 100 demonstrators had traveled up to the summit to camp overnight, to be joined by more protesters in the early morning to blockade crews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Davis|first1=Chelsea|title=Thirty Meter Telescope protesters continue to block construction on Mauna Kea|url=http://www.hawaiinewsnow.com/story/28619239/thirty-meter-telescope-protesters-continue-to-block-construction-on-mauna-kea|accessdate=4 April 2015|agency=KHNL|publisher=WorldNow and KHNL|date=March 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 2, 2015, 300 protesters were gathered near the visitor's center where 12 people were arrested. 11 more protesters were arrested at the summit.&lt;ref name="usnews1"&gt;{{cite news|title=Clash in Hawaii Between Science and Sacred Land|url=https://www.usnews.com/news/science/news/articles/2015/04/03/clash-over-telescope-at-sacred-hawaiian-site-intensifies|accessdate=4 April 2015|agency=Associated Press|publisher=AP/US News and World Report|date=April 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Protesters, ranging in age from 27 to 75 years of age were handcuffed and led away by local police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Police, TMT Issue Statements on Mass Arrests on Mauna Kea|url=http://www.bigislandvideonews.com/2015/04/02/police-tmt-issue-statements-on-mass-arrests-on-mauna-kea/|accessdate=4 April 2015|agency=Big Island Video News|publisher=Big Island Video News|date=April 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the major concerns of the protest groups is whether the land appraisals were done accurately and that Native Hawaiians were not consulted. When the trucks were finally allowed to pass, protesters followed the procession up the summit. A project spokesman said that work had begun after arrests were made and the road cleared.

Among the arrests was professional surfer and former candidate for mayor of [[Kauai]], Dustin Barca. A number of celebrity activists of Native Hawaiian descent, both local and national, began campaigning over social media, including ''[[Game of Thrones]]'' star [[Jason Momoa]] who urged [[Dwayne Johnson]] (The Rock) to join the protests with him on top of Mauna Kea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Scheuring|first1=Ian|title=Local celebrities take to social media in Mauna Kea protests|url=http://www.hawaiinewsnow.com/story/28730585/more-arrests-reported-sunday-during-mauna-kea-protests|accessdate=9 April 2015|agency=WorldNow and KHNL|publisher=Hawaii News Now|date=April 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Construction was halted for one week at the request of Hawaii state governor [[David Ige]] on April 7, 2015 after the protest on Mauna Kea continued and demonstrations began to appear over the state. Project Manager, Gary Sanders stated that TMT agreed to the one-week stop for continued dialogue. Kealoha Pisciotta, president of ''Mauna Kea Anaina Hou'' viewed the development as positive but said opposition to the project would continue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.usnews.com/news/science/news/articles/2015/04/07/amid-controversy-construction-of-telescope-in-hawaii-halted |title=Amid controversy, construction of telescope in Hawaii halted - US News |format= |work= |accessdate=April 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pisciotta also stated that the protests would continue to be within a [[Kapu Aloha]]; ''"moving in Aloha with steadfast determination"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wang|first1=Frances Kai-Hwa|title=Native Hawaiians Arrested in Protests of Massive Telescope|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/native-hawaiians-arrested-protests-massive-telescope-n336176|accessdate=10 October 2015|agency=NBC News|publisher=NBC News|date=April 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Thirty Meter Telescope protest, October 7, 2014.jpg|thumb|Demonstrators call themselves protectors, not protestors]]

==Continued local demonstrations==
The protests sparked statewide, national as well as international attention to Hawaiian culture, Mauna Kea and the 45-year history of 13 other telescopes on the mountain.

At the University of Hawaii Manoa, hundreds of students lined the streets for blocks and, one by one, they passed the stones from the student taro patch of the university's Center on Hawaiian Studies down the human chain to the lawn in front of the office university president, David Lassner, where the stones were used to build an ''ahu'' (the altar of a ''[[heiau]]'') as a message to the university.&lt;ref name=Garcia&gt;{{cite news|last1=Garcia|first1=Nester|title=Hundreds form chain at UH Manoa to protest Thirty Meter Telescope|url=http://khon2.com/2015/04/10/hundreds-form-chain-at-uh-manoa-to-protest-thirty-meter-telescope-3/|accessdate=22 April 2015|agency=KHON2|publisher=LIN Television Corporation, a Media General company|date=April 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 21, 2015, hundreds of protesters filled the streets of [[Honolulu]] protesting against the TMT.&lt;ref name="Witze2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Witze|first1=Alexandra|title=Hawaiian telescope project seeks way forward amid protests|journal=Nature|year=2015|issn=1476-4687|doi=10.1038/nature.2015.17396}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Permit invalidated==
On December 2, 2015, the Supreme Court of Hawaii invalidated the TMT's building permits, ruling that [[due process]] was not followed when the Board of Land and Natural Resources approved the permit before the [[contested case hearing]]. The TMT company [[chairman]] stated: ''"T.M.T. will follow the process set forth by the state..".''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Overbye|first1=Dennis|title=Contested case hearing|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/04/science/space/hawaii-court-rescinds-permit-to-build-thirty-meter-telescope.html?_r=0|accessdate=18 December 2015|agency=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times|date=December 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.courts.state.hi.us/docs/opin_ord/sct/2015/December/SCAP-14-0000873.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; On December 16, the TMT corporation began removal of all construction equipment and vehicles from Mauna Kea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Epping|first1=Jamilia|title=TMT Equipment Removal Underway|url=http://bigislandnow.com/2015/12/16/tmt-equipment-removal-underway/|accessdate=20 December 2015|agency=Big Island Now|publisher=Big Island Now|date=December 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Permit approved==
On September 28, 2017, the Hawaii Board of Land and Natural Resources approved the TMT's Conservation District Use Permit.&lt;ref&gt;[https://dlnr.hawaii.gov/blog/2017/09/28/nr17-0153/ 09/28/17 – Board of Land and Natural Resources Approves TMT Permit]&lt;/ref&gt;  On October 30, 2018, the Supreme Court of Hawaii validated the construction permit.&lt;ref name="bbc201810313" /&gt;

{{Women in society sidebar}}
The lives, roles, and rights of '''women in Chile''' have gone through many changes over time. Chilean women's societal roles have historically been impacted by traditional [[gender roles]] and a [[patriarchy|patriarchal culture]], but throughout the twentieth century, women increasingly involved themselves in [[politics]] and [[protest]], resulting in provisions to the [[constitution]] to uphold equality between men and women and prohibit [[Sexism|sex discrimination]].

Women's educational attainment, workforce participation, and rights have improved, especially since [[Chile]] became a [[democracy]] again in 1990. Chile legalized [[divorce]] in 2004 and is also one of the few countries to have elected a [[Michelle Bachelet|female president]].&lt;ref name=SIGI&gt;{{cite web|title=Gender Equality and Social Institutions in Chile|url=http://genderindex.org/country/chile|publisher=Social Institutions and Gender Index|accessdate=31 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, Chilean women still face many economic and political challenges, including [[economic inequality|income disparity]], high rates of [[domestic violence]], and lingering gender roles.

==History of women==
{{See|History of Chile|Feminism in Chile}}
[[File:María de la Cruz Toledo.jpg|thumb|200 px|[[María de la Cruz]], (1912–1995), Chilean political activist for [[women's suffrage]], journalist, writer, and political commentator. In 1953, she became the first woman ever elected to the Chilean Senate]]
Women were granted the right to vote in 1931 and 1949 during Chile's [[Presidential Republic (1925-1973)|presidential era]].&lt;ref name=dandavati /&gt;&lt;ref name="mujeres que hacen historia" /&gt; Also during the era, thousands of women protested against [[socialist]] [[president]] [[Salvador Allende]] in the March of the Empty Pots and Pans.&lt;ref name="power"/&gt; While under [[Augusto Pinochet]]'s authoritarian regime, women also participated in ''las protestas'', protests against Allende's plebiscite in which women voted "no."&lt;ref name="dandavati"/&gt; During Chile's time under [[dictator]] Pinochet, the state of women's legal rights fell behind most of [[Latin America]], even though Chile had one of the strongest economies in [[South America]].&lt;ref name=haas&gt;{{cite book|last=Haas|first=Liesl|title=Feminist Policymaking in Chile|year=2010|publisher=The Pennsylvania State University Press|location=University Park, Pennsylvania|isbn=978-0-271-03746-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chile returned to [[democracy]] in 1990, leading to changes in women's lives and roles within society.&lt;ref name="StangeOyster2011"/&gt; Since the return to democracy, Chile's government has invested more political and economic resources to expand social welfare programs than before.&lt;ref name=Pribble&gt;{{cite journal|title=Women and Welfare|journal=Latin American Research Review|date=June 2006|volume=41|issue=2|author=Jennifer Pribble}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Coalition of Parties for Democracy|Concertación]]'' political party has been in power since the end of Pinochet's dictatorship, and from 2006 to 2010, [[Michelle Bachelet]] of the party served as the first female [[President of Chile]].&lt;ref name=Econ1&gt;{{cite web|last=|first=|title=Women in Chile: Left behind|url=http://www.economist.com/node/7281220|work=[[The Economist]]|accessdate=24 February 2012|date=10 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Santiago1&gt;{{cite web|last=Shea|first=Steve|title=Setting quotas in Chile for women in politics|url=http://santiagotimes.cl/setting-quotas-in-chile-for-women-in-politics/|work=[[Santiago Times]]|accessdate=24 February 2012|date=13 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Women in society===
Chile has been described as one of the most [[socially conservative]] countries of Latin America.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-18546587|publisher=bbc.com|title=Changing times in Chile? - BBC News|accessdate=13 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/16/world/americas/bachelet-wins-chilean-presidency-in-landslide.html?_r=0|publisher=nytimes.com|title=Chilean Voters Return a Former President to Power - The New York Times|accessdate=13 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="telegraph"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/southamerica/chile/10170520/Chiles-president-praises-11-year-old-for-going-ahead-with-pregnancy-resulting-from-rape.html|publisher=telegraph.co.uk|title=Chile's president praises 11-year-old for going ahead with pregnancy resulting from rape - Telegraph|accessdate=13 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In comparison to the United States, Chile did not have so many feminists among its evolution of women's intrusion to the political sphere. Chilean women esteemed [[Roman Catholicism in Chile|Catholicism]] as their rites of passage, which initiated women's movements in opposition to the liberal political party's eruption in the Chilean government. The traditional domesticated setting that women were accustomed to was used as a patriarchal reasoning for women's restriction of women's votes. However, Chileans religious convictions as devout Catholics initiated their desire to vote against the adamant anticlerical liberal party. In 1875, [[Domitila Silva Y Lepe]], the widow of a former provincial governor, read the requirements deeming "all adult Chileans the right to vote", and was the first woman to vote.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;{{cite book|title=Right-Wing Women in Chile: Feminine Power and the Struggle Against Allende, 1964-1973|author=Power, M.|date=2010|publisher=Pennsylvania State University Press|isbn=9780271046716|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Wq1yTZBHSiAC&amp;pg=PA49|page=49|accessdate=13 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other elitist Chilean women followed her bold lead, which resulted in the anticlerical liberal party of congress to pass a law denying women the right to vote. Despite this set back, Ms. Lepe and other elite women expressed their religious standings to the conservative party. The conservative party were favorable of the women because they knew their support would influence the conservative party's domination in politics. In [[1912 Social Catholicism]] began to erupt.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt; Social Catholicism- upper class women's organization of working class women-was led by Amalia Errazuriz de Subercaseaux. She introduced the Liga de Damas Chilenas (League of Chilean Ladies) amongst 450 other upper-middle class women with intentions to "uphold and defend the interests of those women who worked for a living without attacking the principles of order and authority". Following this organization, many other elite women began socially constructed women's institutions. [[Amanda Labarca]] was also an elitist, but disagreed with the privileged women's subjection of working class women and founded the ladies reading club.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt; She believed women should be educated, regardless of their socioeconomic status to have a more influentially productive role in society.

===Gender roles===
Traditional [[gender role]] beliefs are prevalent in Chilean society, specifically the ideas that women should focus on motherhood and be submissive to men.&lt;ref name="HIV1"/&gt; A 2010 study by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) reported that 62 percent of Chileans are opposed to full gender equality. Many of those surveyed expressed the belief that women should limit themselves to the traditional roles of mother and wife.&lt;ref name=Estrada2010&gt;{{cite news|last=Estrada|first=Daniela|title=Gender Equity Progress Blocked by Hard-Core 'Machismo'|url=http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=51446|accessdate=24 February 2012|date=May 14, 2010|agency=Inter Press Service News Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the 2012 World Development Report states that male attitudes toward gender equality are that "men do not lose out when women's rights are promoted."&lt;ref name=WDR2012&gt;{{cite book |title=Gender Equality and Development: World Development Report 2012|year=2012|publisher=The World Bank|location=Washington D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Motherhood===
Catholicism is embodied wholly among Chilean family identities. [[Virgin Mary]] is the idolized example of motherhood. Her pure and sacrificial acts are to be embodied by Chilean mothers.&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Contesting Legitimacy in Chile: Familial Ideals, Citizenship, and Political Struggle, 1970-1990|author=Thomas, G.|date=2011|publisher=Pennsylvania State University Press|isbn=9780271048499|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=oC1sjIMEOC4C&amp;pg=PA17|page=17|accessdate=13 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, women are supposed to be the connoisseurs of endurance like the Virgin Mary. The biblical significance is portrayed through the traditional government of Chile. In the early 1900s, the gendered examples among Catholicism were embodied by the patriarchal government and suffrage of women. Women were domesticated and confined to the home. In the late 1940s women's issues were embraced by [[First Lady Rosa Markman de Gonzalez Videla]] in acknowledgement of Mothers centers, women gaining access to resources to fulfill their role as housewives, encouraged women as consumers to fight against high living costs, and to raise their interest in partaking in other avenues of public life within the country, such as work and political participation.&lt;ref name="google2"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Politics of Motherhood|author=Mooney, J.P.|date=2009|publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press|isbn=9780822973614|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=HnEKKaWjcyAC&amp;pg=PA75|page=75|accessdate=13 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The First Lady's efforts to advocate the evolution of women reform led to the modern techniques of the women reform. In the 1960s, campaigns for the Christian democrat, Frei, emphasized women and women's issues. Voting had just become mandatory for all Chileans and was the first time in history registration for female voters increased from thirty-five percent to seventy-five percent. The Christian democratic change of government opened women's access to birth control. However, the government's emphasis on the modernization of women institutions and underlying issues of gender hierarchy, women in poverty were neglected. Restrictions within the women's institutions, mother centers, restricted mothers under 18. To further structurally cripple Chilean women, first lady [[Maria Ruiz Tagle de Frei]] supervised "proper functioning" of feminist organizations.&lt;ref name="google2"/&gt;  The Central Organization for Mothers [[(CEMA)]] was created as a formal structure to advise the underprivileged Chilean mothers.&lt;ref name="google2"/&gt; [[Carmen Gloria Aguayo]] revolutionized the mother's centers during the period of conflict between change and tradition during the Christian democrat campaign.&lt;ref name="google2"/&gt; Ms. Aguayo also headed the party's women's departments amongst forty-eight men and reflected the political direction of the initiatives: policies to protect the family- defending women's rights to work, to maternity leave, to equitable pay and occupation, a new opportunities for training and learning in the promised department for female labor studies. Because familial welfare was deemed important within the Chilean society, mothers have served as a political representation to have a voice in amongst the government.

==Legal rights==
Currently, women have many of the same rights as men.&lt;ref name=report/&gt;  The [[National Women's Service]] (SERNAM) is charged with protecting women's legal rights in the [[public sector]].&lt;ref name=report/&gt;&lt;ref name=WB&gt;{{cite web|last=|first=|title=Chile: Reconciling the Gender Paradox|url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTENBREVE/Newsletters/21455235/Apr07_105_GenderChile_EN.pdf|work=World Bank|accessdate=24 February 2012|date=April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marriage===
Until recently, women lost their right to manage their own [[asset]]s once they were married&lt;ref name=derechos&gt;{{cite book|title=Género y derechos de las mujeres a la tierra en Chile|year=1999|publisher=Salgó Ltd.|isbn=956-7236-13-5|author=Magdalena León|author2=Carmen Diana Deere |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; and husbands received all of the wealth,&lt;ref name="dandavati"/&gt; but that law has since changed and women can now administer their own assets.&lt;ref name="derechos"/&gt; A couple can also sign a legal agreement before marriage so that all assets continue to be owned by the one who brought them into the marriage.&lt;ref name="derechos"/&gt;

The [[Chilean Civil Code]] previously mandated that wives had to live with and be faithful and obedient to their husbands, but it is no longer in the law.&lt;ref name="dandavati"/&gt; A married woman cannot be head of the household or head of the family in the same way as a man; however, married women are not required by law to obey their husbands.&lt;ref name ="chile data"/&gt;

====Divorce====
Chile legalized [[divorce]] in 2004, overturning an 1884 legal code.&lt;ref name="bbc divorce"&gt;{{cite news|title=Chile introduces right to divorce|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4021427.stm|newspaper=BBC News|date=November 18, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law that legalizes divorce is the New Civil Marriage Law which was first introduced as a [[Bill (proposed law)|bill]] in 1995. There had been previous divorce bills before, but this one managed to secure enough conservative and liberal support to pass.&lt;ref name="haas"/&gt;

With divorce now being legal, four marital statuses exist within Chile: married, separated, divorced, and widow (er). Only the divorced and widow (er) statuses allow a new marriage.&lt;ref name="chile government divorce"&gt;{{cite web|title=How to Get Married or Divorced|url=http://chileabroad.gov.cl/en/que-hacer/para-casarse-o-separarse/|publisher=Gobierno de Chile|accessdate=11 April 2012|author=Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the legalization of divorce, the only way to leave a marriage was to obtain a civil [[annulment]] which would only be granted by telling the civil registrar that the spouse had lied in some way concerning the marriage license, thereby voiding the marriage contract.&lt;ref name="haas"/&gt;

===Property===
In marriage, there are three types of assets: those of the husband, those of the wife, and the common assets that pertain to both. Land and houses in a marriage continue to be the property of the person who brought them to the marriage, but in order to sell them, both the husband and wife must sign.&lt;ref name="derechos"/&gt; In the case of divorce, both the man and woman are entitled to ownership of the marital home.&lt;ref name="chile data"/&gt; In the case of the death of a spouse, the surviving spouse, regardless of gender, has equal inheritance rights to the marital home.&lt;ref name="chile data"/&gt; If there is no will when the husband dies, the wife is given an equal category as the children for inheritance.&lt;ref name="derechos"/&gt; Before marriage, a couple can sign a legal document separating all assets so that the woman and man each administer her or his own; in this case, the husband cannot control his wife's assets.&lt;ref name="derechos"/&gt;

If women work outside the home independent of their husbands, acquire personal assets, and can prove that they came by these assets through their independent work, then these working women can accumulate these assets as their own, unable to be touched by husbands.&lt;ref name="derechos"/&gt;

Sons and daughters have equal inheritance rights to [[personal property|moveable]] and [[immovable property]] from their parents.&lt;ref name="chile data"&gt;{{cite web|title=Women, business, and the law: creating economic opportunity for women|url=http://wbl.worldbank.org/data/exploreeconomies/chile/2011?topic=using-property|publisher=The World Bank|accessdate=18 March 2012|authorlink=Chile|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unmarried men and women have equal ownership rights to moveable and immoveable property.&lt;ref name="chile data"/&gt;

In rural Chile, inheritance is the principle way in which land is acquired by both men and women, whether the land has [[Title (property)|titles]] or not.&lt;ref name="derechos"/&gt; Sometimes women cannot claim their inheritance to land without titles because the cost of legal documents is too high.&lt;ref name="derechos"/&gt;

===Suffrage===
Women were granted the right to vote in municipal elections in 1931&lt;ref name=dandavati&gt;{{cite book|last=Dandavati|first=Annie G.|title=The Women's Movement and the Transition to Democracy in Chile|year=1996|publisher=Peter Lang Publishing, Inct.|location=New York|isbn=0-8204-2562-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and obtained the right to vote in national elections on January 8, 1949, resulting in their ability to vote under the same equal conditions as men and increasing women's participation in politics.&lt;ref name="mujeres que hacen historia"&gt;{{cite book|title=Mujeres que hacen historia|year=2005|publisher=[[LOM Ediciones]]|isbn=956-282-724-0|author=Ximena Galleguillos|author2=Diana Veneros |author3=Carmen Ortuzar |author4=Arnoldo Carreras |page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Family law===
Both Chilean men and women qualify for a [[Child benefit|family allowance]] if they have dependent children under the age of eighteen (or twenty-four if in school). There are differences in entitlement requirements for the spouse-related family allowance since a man qualifies for a family allowance if he has a dependent wife, but a woman only qualifies for a family allowance if her husband is disabled.&lt;ref name="Pribble"/&gt; Until a reform of paternity laws in 1998, children born outside marriage had less right to parental financial support and inheritance than children born within marriage.&lt;ref name="haas"/&gt; A bill was passed in 2007 to give mothers direct access to [[child support]] payments.&lt;ref name="haas"/&gt;

Working mothers of a certain low [[socioeconomic status]] and with proof of an employment contract and working hours receive subsidized [[child care]] through legislation passed in 1994. This system excludes: women whose household income is too high, unemployed women, women working in the informal sector, and women whose jobs are not by contract.&lt;ref name="Pribble"/&gt; Chile offers paid maternity leave for women working in the formal sector, paying women 100 percent of their salary during the leave, and also allows women a one-hour feeding break each day until the child has reached the age of two.&lt;ref name="Pribble"/&gt; Female workers unattached to the formal market and without an employment contract do not receive paid [[parental leave|maternity leave]].&lt;ref name="Pribble"/&gt;

Postnatal maternity leave is now six months instead of the previous three.&lt;ref name=maternityleave&gt;{{cite web|title=President Piñera enacts the law to extend postnatal maternity leave to 6 months|url=http://www.gob.cl/english/featured/2011/10/07/president-pinera-enacts-the-law-to-extend-postnatal-maternity-leave-to-6-months.htm|publisher=Gobierno de Chile|accessdate=7 April 2012|date=7 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
[[File:Escolares-chilenos-Talcahuano.jpg|thumb|250px|School girls running in the school yard]]
Women's [[literacy rates]] almost match those of men, with 97.4 percent of women being able to read, versus 97.6 percent of men (in 2015).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2103.html&lt;/ref&gt; Chilean law mandates compulsory primary and secondary education for children, boys and girls.&lt;ref name="chile data"/&gt; In 2007, the [[World Bank]] declared that enrollment levels for boys and girls in primary and secondary education were at a "virtual parity."&lt;ref name=WB /&gt; Women's education in Chile is generally higher than neighboring countries.&lt;ref name=WB/&gt; In higher education, as of 2002, women had similar attendance rates as men, with women at 47.5 percent attendance, versus men at 52.5 percent.&lt;ref name="Punnett2006B"&gt;{{cite book|author=Betty Jane Punnett|title=Successful professional women of the Americas: from polar winds to tropical breezes|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kFJwEOd8Q70C&amp;pg=PA214|accessdate=24 February 2012|year=2006|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing|isbn=978-1-84542-437-4|page=212}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Employment==

===Participation===
Chile has one of the lowest rate of female employment in all of [[Latin America]], but women's workforce participation has steadily increased over the years.&lt;ref name="un data"&gt;{{cite web|title=Chile|url=http://data.un.org/CountryProfile.aspx?crName=CHILE|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=18 March 2012|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2016, the [[employment rate]] of women was 52%.&lt;ref name="stats.oecd.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DatasetCode=LFS_SEXAGE_I_R#|author=OECD|publisher=stats.oecd.org|title=LFS by sex and age - indicators|accessdate=13 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the fact that 47.5% of students in college are women, many still choose to be [[homemakers]] rather than join the workforce.&lt;ref name="StangeOyster2011"/&gt; A 2012 World Bank study showed that the expansion of public day care had no effect on female labor force participation.&lt;ref name=WDR2012 /&gt; The low number of women entering the labor force causes Chile to rank low amongst upper-middle class countries regarding women in the work force despite higher educational training.&lt;ref name="WB"/&gt; In Chile, poorer women make up a smaller share of the workforce.&lt;ref name=WB/&gt; A 2004 study showed that 81.4 percent of women worked in the [[tertiary sector of the economy|service sector]].&lt;ref name="Punnett2006B"/&gt;

===Formal and informal work===
Women have increasingly moved out of unpaid [[domestic worker|domestic work]] and into the paid formal and informal labor markets.&lt;ref name="Pribble"/&gt; Many female workers are in Chile's [[informal sector]] because national competition for jobs has increased the number of low-skill jobs.&lt;ref name="Pribble"/&gt; In 1998, 44.8 percent of working-aged women in Chile worked in the informal sector while only 32.9 percent of men worked informally.&lt;ref name="Pribble"/&gt;

===Income gap===
For jobs that do not require higher education, women make 20 percent less money on average than men. For jobs requiring a university degree, the gap in pay increases to 40 percent. Women without a university degree make 83 percent of the income men make without a university degree.&lt;ref name="Punnett2006B"/&gt; The quadrennial 2004 National Socio-Economic Survey and World Bank report in 2007 say that the overall gender income gap stands at 33 percent (since women make 67 percent of men's salaries).&lt;ref name=WB /&gt;

==Politics==

===Female participation in politics===
Women were not involved in politics until 1934, when they could first use their municipal vote.&lt;ref name=power&gt;{{cite book|last=Power|first=Margaret|title=Right-wing women in Chile: feminine power and the struggle against Allende, 1964-1973|year=2002|publisher=Pennsylvania State University|location=University Park, PA|isbn=0-271-02174-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The municipal, and later national, vote caused women to involve themselves in politics more than before, pressuring the government and political parties.&lt;ref name="dandavati"/&gt; With women's increased political importance, many parties established women's sections for support and tried to pursue women's votes, though it would take years for political parties to truly view women as important to politics.&lt;ref name="power"/&gt;
[[File:Feministas en lucha anti Pinochet (de Kena Lorenzini).jpg|thumb|250px|Chilean feminists gather in Santiago during Pinochet's regime]]

On December 1, 1971&amp;nbsp;thousands of women who were against the newly elected [[Salvador Allende]] marched through Santiago to protest government policies and [[Fidel Castro]]'s visiting of Chile.&lt;ref name=power /&gt; This march, known as the March of the Empty Pots and Pans, brought together many conservative and some liberal women as a force in Chilean politics,&lt;ref name="power"/&gt; and in 1977 Augusto Pinochet decreed the day of the march to be National Women's Day.&lt;ref name=baldez&gt;{{cite book|last=Baldez|first=Lisa|title=Why Women Protest|year=2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=United Kingdom|isbn=0-521-81150-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Women also made their voices heard in the late 1980s when 52 percent of the national electorate was female, and 51.2 percent of women voted "no" in Augusto Pinochet's [[referendum|plebiscite]].&lt;ref name="dandavati"/&gt; The women in these popular protests are considered to have played a central role in increasing national concern with the history of women's political activism.&lt;ref name=klubock&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Hispanic American Historical Review|year=2001|volume=81|author=Thomas Miller Klubock |title=Writing the History of Women and Gender in Twentieth-Century Chile|publisher=Duke University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2006, Chile was lower than eight other Latin American countries in regards to women in political positions.&lt;ref name=Econ1/&gt; With only a few women legislators, sustaining attention to the topic of women's rights a difficult task, especially in the Senate, where there are fewer female representatives than in the [[Chamber of Deputies of Chile|Chamber of Deputies]].&lt;ref name="haas"/&gt; Unlike neighboring [[Argentina]], where 41.6 percent of the [[Argentine Chamber of Deputies]] is made up of women, only 15 percent of Chile's lower house is made up of female representatives.&lt;ref name="Econ1"/&gt; Chile has no government mandate requiring that women must make up a certain percentage of party candidates.&lt;ref name="StangeOyster2011"/&gt; Women's political representation is low but is on the rise in many political parties, and there is growing support for a quota law concerning women's representation.&lt;ref name="haas"/&gt; The progressive parties of the Left have greater openness to the participation of women, evident in the Party for Democracy's and Socialist Party's quotas for women's representation as candidates for internal party office.&lt;ref name="haas"/&gt;

In 2009, activists demanded that presidential candidates develop reforms that would improve work conditions for women. Reforms included [[maternity leave]], flexible work schedules and job training.&lt;ref name="StangeOyster2011"/&gt; Aimed at improving women's work opportunities, former president Michelle Bachelet made it illegal to ask for a job applicants' gender on applications and for employers to demand [[pregnancy tests]] be taken by employees in the public sector.&lt;ref name=Econ1/&gt;

===Second Wave Feminism===
Following these Chilean women, the contemporary phase of feminism was constructed through the social conflict between [[socialism]] and [[feminism]].&lt;ref name="muse.jhu.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/login?auth=0&amp;type=summary&amp;url=/journals/journal_of_womens_history/v015/15.3tobar.html|publisher=muse.jhu.edu|title=Project MUSE - "Feminism is Socialism, Liberty, and Much More:" Second-Wave Chilean Feminism and its Contentious Relationship with Socialism|accessdate=13 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The democratically elected president, [[Salvador Allende|Allende]], was ousted on September 11, 1973 when a military coup invaded his palace, brutally excising all [[Popular Unity Government]] officials and resulting in Allende's debated suicide.&lt;ref name="muse.jhu.edu"/&gt; This revolution "The Chilean Road to Socialism" abruptly came to an end, revitalizing the foundation of the government. However, the foundation was hastily corrupted by patriarchal values. Prominent feminist sociologist [[Maria Elena Valenzuela]] argued, the military state can be interpreted as the quintessential expression of [[patriarchy]]: "The Junta, with a very clear sense of its interests, has understood that it must reinforce the traditional family, and the dependent role of women, which is reduced to that of mother.&lt;ref name="muse.jhu.edu"/&gt; The dictatorship, which institutionalizes [[social inequality]], is founded on inequality in the family." &lt;ref name="muse.jhu.edu"/&gt; These inequalities began to agitate Chilean women. Women began to formulate groups opposing the patriarchal domination of the political sphere.

===Michelle Bachelet's presidency===
[[Michelle Bachelet]] was the first female president of Chile, leading the country between 2006 and 2010.&lt;ref name=WB /&gt;  During her presidency, Bachelet increased the budget of the [[National Women's Service]] (Servicio Nacional de la Mujer, SERNAM) and helped the institution gain funding from the United Nations Development Fund for Women.&lt;ref name="haas"/&gt; Her administration had an active role in furthering opportunities and policies for and about women, creating or improving [[child care]], [[pension]] reform and [[breastfeeding]] laws. During her presidency, Bachelet appointed a [[Cabinet of Chile|cabinet]] that was 50 percent female.&lt;ref name="haas"/&gt;

Bachelet served as the first executive director of [[UN Women|United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women]].&lt;ref name="haas"/&gt;

On March 11, 2014, she became president of Chile for the second time.

===Policy===
The [[National Women's Service]] (SERNAM) has noticed that it is easier to get politicians to support and pass poverty-alleviation programs aimed at poor women than proposals that challenge gender relations.&lt;ref name="haas"/&gt; Much of Chile's legislation concerning women's rights has been pushed by SERNAM: Between 1992 and 2010, sixty-four legislative proposals to expand women's legal equality were introduced by SERNAM.&lt;ref name="haas"/&gt;

Historically the progressive parties of the Left have drawn more attention to women's rights.&lt;ref name="haas"/&gt; Yet many political parties insincerely support women's agenda and the concept of gender equality, instead leaving any action to be taken by SERNAM or nongovernmental organizations.&lt;ref name="dandavati"/&gt;

Although SERNAM exists to aid women, there is no non-discrimination clause in the [[Constitution of Chile|Political Constitution of the Republic of Chile]].&lt;ref name="chile data"/&gt;

==Organizations==

===State===
The [[National Women's Service]] is the political institution created in 1991 that crafts executive bills concerning women's rights.&lt;ref name="haas"/&gt; Its Spanish name is Servicio Nacional de la Mujer, or SERNAM; it has established a program to aid female heads of households, a program for prevention of violence against women, and a network of information centers that focus on the issues of women's rights.&lt;ref name="haas"/&gt; Its presence in Chile is important because it was established by law and is a permanent part of Chile's state structure.&lt;ref name="Impact SERNAM"&gt;{{cite journal|title="State Feminism" and Women's Movements: The Impact of Chile's Servicio Nacinoal de la Mujer on Women's Activism|journal=Latin American Research Review|date=February 2003|volume=38|issue=1|author=Susan Franceschet|publisher=University of Texas Press|location=Austin, TX}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an institution it tends to focus much of its attention on certain segments of women: low-income women heads of households, women seasonal workers, domestic violence prevention, and teen pregnancy prevention.&lt;ref name="Impact SERNAM"/&gt;

A common complaint that SERNAM has is that the top appointees are not women linked to the feminist community.&lt;ref name="haas"/&gt; The institution also has restrictions when it comes to policy regarding women due to its state ties, as seen in 2000 when SERNAM favored but would not explicitly support the bill to legalize divorce because it was under the leadership of the Christian Democratic party. In 2002 it was finally allowed to support the bill.&lt;ref name="haas"/&gt;

===Research and activism===
Many of Chile's women's groups function outside the state sphere.&lt;ref name="Pribble"/&gt;

Centers for research began to emerge in the later part of the twentieth century, including the Centro de Estudios de la Mujer (The Women's Study Center) and La Morada.&lt;ref name="klubock"/&gt; The Women's Study Center is a [[nonprofit organization]] founded in 1984 and conducts research, trains women, has a consulting program, and tries to increase women's political participation.&lt;ref name=CEM&gt;{{cite web|title=About CEM|url=http://www.cem.cl/eque.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; La Morada is another nonprofit organization that works to expand the rights of women through political involvement, education, culture, and efforts to eradicate violence.&lt;ref name="la morada"&gt;{{cite web|title=La Morada|url=http://www.lamorada.cl/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===International relations===
Chile ratified the United Nation's [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women]] in 1988, internationally declaring support for women's [[human rights]].&lt;ref name=baldez /&gt;

One of Chile's missions as part of the UN is commitment to democracy, human rights and gender perspective as foundations of multilateral action.&lt;ref name="chile government UN page"&gt;{{cite web|title=Objcetives and Functions|url=http://chileabroad.gov.cl/onu/en/sobre-la-mision/objetivos-y-funciones/|publisher=Government of Chile|accessdate=14 April 2012|author=Permanent Mission of Chile to the UN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Crimes against women==

=== Domestic violence ===
{{Main|Domestic violence in Chile}}

[[Domestic violence]] in Chile is a serious issue affecting a large percentage of the population, especially among lower income demographics.&lt;ref name="report"&gt;[https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2006/78884.htm Report on Human Rights Practices 2006: Chile]. [[United States]] [[Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor]] (March 6, 2007). ''This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the [[public domain]].''&lt;/ref&gt; The Intrafamily Violence Law passed in 1994 was the first political measure to address violence in the home, but because the law would not pass without being accepted by both sides, the law was weak in the way it addressed victim protection and punishment for abusers.&lt;ref name="haas"/&gt; The law was later reformed in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cepal.org/oig/doc/Chi200520066ModificaLeyVIF1994.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; A 2004 [[National Women's Service|SERNAM]] study reported that 50 percent of married women in Chile had suffered spousal abuse, 34 percent reported having suffered physical violence, and 16 percent reported psychological abuse.&lt;ref name="report"/&gt; According to another study from 2004, 90 percent of low-income women in Chile experience some type of domestic violence.&lt;ref name="Cianelli2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cianelli|first=R.|author2=Ferrer, L. |author3=Peragallo, N. |title=Low income Chilean women confronting HIV/AIDS and domestic violence|journal=The XV International AIDS Conference|year=2004|url=http://www.iasociety.org/Default.aspx?pageId=11&amp;abstractId=2169470|accessdate=24 February 2012|location=Bangkok, Thailand}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the high prevalence of domestic violence, many Chilean women accept it as normal.&lt;ref name="Cianelli2004"/&gt; The legalization of divorce in 2004 won the approval of women throughout the country, especially those concerned about [[domestic violence]], as women were previously unable to escape abusive relationships due to the divorce laws.&lt;ref name="StangeOyster2011"/&gt;

From January to November 2005, 76,000 cases of family violence were reported to the ''[[Carabineros de Chile|Carabineros]]''; 67,913 were reported by women, 6,404 by men, and approximately 1,000 by children.&lt;ref name="report"/&gt;

=== Rape ===
[[Rape]], including [[spousal rape]], is a criminal offense. Penalties for rape range from five to 15 years' imprisonment, and the government generally enforces the law.&lt;ref name="report"/&gt; In 2004 the Criminal Code was changed so that the age for statutory rape is 14; previously, the age was 12.&lt;ref name=Ahumada&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ahumada|first=Claudia|title=Statutory Rape Law in Chile: For or Against Adolescents?|journal=Journal of Politics and Law|date=June 2009|volume=2|issue=2|url=http://www.ccsenet.org/journal/index.php/jpl/article/view/2311/2168|accessdate=11 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law protects the privacy and safety of the person making the charge. In 2006 from January to November, police received reports of 1,926 cases of rape, compared with 2,451 cases in all of 2005; experts believed that most rape cases go unreported. The Ministry of Justice and the PICH have several offices specifically to provide counseling and assistance in rape cases.&lt;ref name=report/&gt; A number of NGOs, such as La Morada Corporation for Women, provide counseling for rape victims.&lt;ref name=klubock /&gt;

=== Sexual harassment ===
A 2005 law against [[sexual harassment]] provides protection and financial compensation to victims and penalizes harassment by employers or co-workers.&lt;ref name="report"/&gt; The law provides [[severance package|severance pay]] to anyone who resigns due to being a victim of sexual harassment if she/he has worked for the employer for at least one year.&lt;ref name=report2010&gt;{{cite web|title=2010 Human Rights Report: Chile|url=https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/2010/wha/154498.htm|publisher=U.S. Department of State|accessdate=13 April 2012|author=Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor|date=8 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; During 2005 the Labor Directorate received 244 complaints of sexual harassment,&lt;ref name="report"/&gt; and in 2009 there were 82 complaints were received.&lt;ref name="report2010"/&gt; The majority of the complaints come from women.&lt;ref name=becerra&gt;{{cite web|last=Becerra|first=Lidia Casas|title=An Exploratory Study of Sexual Harassment Complaints in Chile|url=http://www.ialsnet.org/meetings/labour/papers/Casas-Chile.pdf|publisher=International Association of Law Schools: Diego Portales University Law School|accessdate=13 April 2012|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Discrimination ===
A 2005 study by ''Corporacion Humana'' and the [[University of Chile]]'s Institute of Public Affairs revealed that 87 percent of women surveyed felt that women suffered discrimination. According to the survey, 95 percent believed women faced discrimination in the labor market, 67 percent believed they faced discrimination in politics, 61 percent felt that women were discriminated against by the media, and 54 percent within the family.&lt;ref name=report/&gt;

==Other concerns==

===Family===
Today, younger women are opting out of marriage and having fewer children than their predecessors.&lt;ref name="StangeOyster2011"/&gt; The total fertility rate as of 2015 was 1.82 children born/woman.&lt;ref name="cia"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ci.html|publisher=cia.gov|title=The World Factbook — Central Intelligence Agency|accessdate=13 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This is below the replacement rate of 2.1, and also lower than in previous years. A 2002 study reported that urban women averaged 2.1 children per woman, with women living in rural areas having more children, at 2.9. As of the 1990s, both urban and rural women were averaging fewer children than previously. For those women who do have children, after former president Michelle Bachelet's childcare mandates, childcare centers that provide free services are four times more numerous. Nursing mothers also have the legal right to breastfeed during the workday.&lt;ref name="StangeOyster2011"/&gt; Women are less likely to seek divorces and marriage annulments.&lt;ref name="Punnett2006D"/&gt;

===Health and sexuality===
Women in Chile have long [[life expectancy]], living an average of 80.8 years, about six years longer than men.&lt;ref name="StangeOyster2011"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Mary Zeiss Stange|author2=Carol K. Oyster|author3=Jane E. Sloan|title=Encyclopedia of Women in Today's World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bOkPjFQoBj8C&amp;pg=PA280|accessdate=24 February 2012|date=23 February 2011|publisher=SAGE|isbn=978-1-4129-7685-5|pages=280–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Punnett2006D"&gt;{{cite book|author=Betty Jane Punnett|title=Successful professional women of the Americas: from polar winds to tropical breezes|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kFJwEOd8Q70C&amp;pg=PA214|accessdate=24 February 2012|year=2006|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing|isbn=978-1-84542-437-4|page=214}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sex education]] is rarely taught in schools and is considered "taboo" by many Chilean families. Friends and family usually are the main source of sex education.&lt;ref name=HIV1/&gt; In 1994, Chile decriminalized [[adultery]].&lt;ref&gt;''Women and Democracy: Latin America and Central and Eastern Europe'', edited by Jane S. Jaquette, Sharon L. Wolchik, page 62&lt;/ref&gt;

====HIV/AIDS====
The [[HIV/AIDS]] rate in Chile was estimated in 2012 at 0.4% of adults aged 15–49.&lt;ref name="cia2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2155rank.html|publisher=cia.gov|title=The World Factbook — Central Intelligence Agency|accessdate=13 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
While cases of [[HIV]] and [[AIDS]] in women have stabilized internationally, Chile has seen a rise in HIV/AIDS infection. Societal beliefs about traditional women's roles as mothers leads to women being less likely to use contraceptives, increasing the opportunity for disease. Chilean women also often feel subordinate to men due to these traditional belief systems, making women less likely to negotiate for the use of [[condoms]]. In 2007, 28 percent of people with HIV/AIDS in Chile were women. Numbers of women living with HIV is lower than those with AIDS. A study by Vivo Positivo showed that 85 percent of women living with HIV/AIDS reported that they had little to no education or information about HIV/AIDS until diagnosis.&lt;ref name=HIV1/&gt;

A 2004 study found that Chilean women with HIV/AIDS were susceptible to coerced [[Sterilisation (medicine)|sterilization]]. Fifty-six percent of HIV-positive Chilean women reported being pressured by health-care workers to prevent pregnancy by being sterilized. Of the women who chose to be sterilized, half were forced or persuaded to do so. Women victims of [[domestic abuse]] face a higher risk of getting HIV, and in 2004, 56 percent of women who have HIV and 77 percent of women with HIV/AIDS were victims of domestic abuse, sexual abuse, or rape before their diagnosis.&lt;ref name=HIV1&gt;{{cite web|last=|first=|title=Dignity Denied: Violations of the Rights of HIV-Positive Women in Chilean Health Facilities |url=http://reproductiverights.org/sites/crr.civicactions.net/files/documents/chilereport_FINAL_singlepages.pdf |work=[[Center for Reproductive Rights]]|accessdate=24 February 2012|date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Abortion====
{{See|Abortion in Chile}}
Between 1989 and 2017, Chile had some of the strictest [[abortion]] laws in the world, banning the procedure completely.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-41005517 "Chile abortion: Court approves easing total ban"] at BBC News.&lt;/ref&gt; The current law allows abortion if the mother's life in danger, in case of lethal malformations of the fetus, or in cases of rape.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.diariooficial.interior.gob.cl/publicaciones/2017/09/23/41866/01/1276248.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
