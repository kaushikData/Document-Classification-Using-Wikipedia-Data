      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6446">In 2009, the [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]] (ASEAN) established the [[ASEAN Intergovernmental Commission on Human Rights]] to promote human rights in the ten ASEAN countries. By mid-2012, the Commission had drafted the '''ASEAN Human Rights Declaration'''. The Declaration was adopted unanimously by ASEAN members at its 18 November 2012 meeting in [[Phnom Penh]], [[Cambodia]]. The Declaration details ASEAN nations' commitment to human rights for its 600 million people. The Declaration includes 40 paragraphs under 6 headings.&lt;ref name="ASEAN Declaration"&gt;{{cite web|title=ASEAN Human Rights Declaration|url=http://www.asean.org/wp-content/uploads/images/resources/ASEAN%20Publication/2013%20(7.%20Jul)%20-%20ASEAN%20Human%20Rights%20Declaration%20(AHRD)%20and%20Its%20Translation.pdf|accessdate=6 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first five Articles affirm that human rights belong to "Every person," specifically emphasizing that they belong to "women, children, the elderly, persons with disabilities, migrant workers, and vulnerable and marginalised groups (Art 5). Article 10 directly affirms "all the civil and political rights in the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]," and these are detailed in Articles 11- 25. Article 26 next affirms "all the economic, social and cultural rights in the Universal Declaration...," with these described in Articles 27 to 34. The ASEAN Human Rights Declaration goes beyond the Universal Declaration by making explicit "the right to safe drinking water and sanitation" (Art. 28. e.), "the right to a safe, clean and sustainable environment" (Art 28.f.), protection from discrimination in treatment for "people suffering from communicable diseases, including HIV/AIDS" (Art. 29), the "right to development ... aimed at poverty alleviation, the creation of conditions including the protection and sustainability of the environment...(Art. 36), and the right to peace (Art. 30).&lt;ref name="ASEAN Declaration" /&gt;

However, the Commission has been widely criticized for the lack of transparency and failure to consult with ASEAN civil society during drafting process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ASEAN leaders adopt lame-duck rights declaration |url=http://www2.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/11/19/asean-leaders-adopt-lame-duck-rights-declaration.html |publisher=The Jakarta Post |accessdate=4 January 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121128024419/http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/11/19/asean-leaders-adopt-lame-duck-rights-declaration.html |archivedate=28 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="High Commissioner"&gt;{{cite web|last=UN High Commissioner for Human Rights|title=UN official welcomes ASEAN commitment to human rights, but concerned over declaration wording|url=https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=43536#.UPgVKGckSOI|accessdate=17 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Declaration itself has been criticized by ASEAN civil society, international human rights organizations such as [[Amnesty International]]&lt;ref name="Amnesty International"&gt;{{cite web|last=Amnesty International|title=Civil society rejects flawed ASEAN Human Rights Declaration|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/ior64/005/2012/en/|accessdate=17 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[Human Rights Watch]],&lt;ref name="Human Rights Watch"&gt;{{cite web|last=Human Rights Watch|title=Civil Society Denounces Adoption of Flawed ASEAN Human Rights Declaration|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2012/11/19/civil-society-denounces-adoption-flawed-asean-human-rights-declaration|accessdate=17 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the U.S. [[Department of State]],&lt;ref name="State Department"&gt;{{cite web|last=U.S. Department of State|title=ASEAN Declaration on Human Rights|url=https://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2012/11/200915.htm|accessdate=17 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and the UN [[Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights|High Commissioner for Human Rights]].&lt;ref name="High Commissioner" /&gt; Human Rights Watch described it as a "declaration of government powers disguised as a declaration of human rights".&lt;ref name="Human Rights Watch"/&gt; ASEAN civil societies have noted that "The Declaration fails to include several key basic rights and fundamental freedoms, including the right to freedom of association and the right to be free from enforced disappearance."&lt;ref name="Human Rights Watch" /&gt; Further, the Declaration contains clauses that many fear could be used to undermine human rights, such as “the realization of human rights must be considered in the regional and national context” (Art. 7),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ASEAN Approves Controversial Human Rights Declaration|url=http://www.voanews.com/content/asean-summit-opens-in-phnom-penh/1548305.html|publisher=Voice of America|accessdate=4 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; or that human rights might be limited to preserve "national security" or a narrowly defined “public morality” (Art. 8).&lt;ref name="Amnesty International" /&gt;

The U.S. Department of State and the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights welcomed the Declaration, but with substantive reservations. The U.S. State Department issued a statement of support, "in principle," for "ASEAN's efforts to develop a regional human rights declaration," but expressing concern for "the use of the concept of 'cultural relativism' ..., stipulating that domestic laws can trump universal human rights, incomplete descriptions that are mentioned elsewhere, introducing novel limits to rights, and language that could be read to suggest that individual rights are subject to group veto."&lt;ref name="State Department" /&gt;  The U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights "welcomed the renewed commitment by leaders of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations to universal human rights norms" noting that "Other regions have shown how regional human rights systems can evolve and improve over time" and that "it is essential that ASEAN ensures that any language inconsistent with international human rights standards does not become a part of any binding regional human rights convention.”&lt;ref name="High Commissioner" /&gt;

{{common law}}
{{Criminal defenses}}

In law, an '''absolute defense''' is a factual circumstance or argument that, if proven, will end the litigation in favor of the [[defendant]].  The concept of an absolute [[Defense (legal)|defense]] is not a rigid one.  Statutes frequently use the term merely as a synonym to "full" or "complete". It is more often used, however, as a term of art in both criminal and civil law to refer to an underlying set of facts and laws, not raised by the complaint or indictment, which will require the defendant's dismissal even if the factual allegations of the complaining pleading are true.

Another characteristic of an ''absolute defense'' is that, once it is pleaded and proven, it is not subject to mitigation or collateral attack.

Examples of ''absolute defenses'' include

* ''Truth'' of an allegedly [[libel]]ous statement (in modern [[defamation]]): a person cannot be made to pay damages for a defamatory statement, if the person can show that the statement is true (even if the statement is damaging, and the person said it in bad faith).  This is the case in some jurisdictions, including the United States, but not in others, including [[English law|England and Wales]].
* ''Self-defense'' in a [[battery (crime)|battery]] case: a person cannot be held criminally liable for battery if they can prove [[Right of self-defense]] under certain circumstances (e.g. where [[withdrawal (military)|retreat]] was impossible, and where the use of force was not excessive).
* Different kinds of ''immunity'' can provide an absolute defense.  Probably the strongest of these is [[sovereign immunity]]—this is the common law doctrine, followed in many jurisdictions, that the [[state (polity)|state]] cannot be sued unless it agrees to waive its immunity, usually by legislation allowing specific claims to be brought.

Use of the word "absolute" sometimes causes confusion, because even in the law "absolute" is sometimes used simply as a synonym for "full" or "complete".  As a term or art, however, there are many ''complete'' defenses which are not customarily called ''absolute''. Most notably, innocence, while a complete defense to a criminal charge, is not generally termed "absolute", because it involves a material fact of the pleading.  On the other hand, double jeopardy is more likely to be termed an absolute defense; an indictment or (other criminal initiating pleading) does not have to state that the defendant has not previously been tried on the crime, but once a defendant shows that he has been previously tried for a crime, his dismissal is required by the US Constitution.

Both an ''absolute defense'' and a ''complete defense'' must be distinguished from a [[partial defense]].  With a partial defense, the litigant hopes to mitigate the outcome of the litigation, or limit culpability, but the liability is not eliminated. Examples include [[diminished capacity]] to understand the wrongfulness of the action, or a [[mistake of fact]] that affected the intention of the litigant.

'''''Acte clair''''' is a doctrine of [[European Union law]], which states that if a judgment or rule of law is clear enough, then a [[member state of the European Union|member state]] has no duty to refer a question for [[preliminary ruling]] to the [[Court of Justice of the European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last1=Barnard |editor-first1=Catherine |editor-last2=Peers |editor-first2=Steve |title=European Union Law |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=2014 |page=291 |isbn=978-0-19-968611-7 }} &lt;/ref&gt;

The ''acte clair'' doctrine originated in the judgment of the Court of Justice in ''[[Srl CILFIT v Ministry of Health]]'' (1982), from which developed what has been termed the 'CILFIT criteria'. Though it had initially been believed that the Court of Justice would be strict as to its application, scholarly papers claim that CILFIT criteria, although often quoted in judgments and doctrine, have been applied neither consistently nor truly rigidly by the Court. Instead, a more flexible approach to ''acte clair'' requirements is taking shape.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Limante, Agne. Recent Developments in the ''Acte Clair'' Case Law of the EU Court of Justice: Towards a more Flexible Approach. JCMS: Journal of Common Market Studies, 2016, DOI: 10.1111/jcms.12434&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Animal cognition''' describes the mental capacities of non-human [[animal]]s and the study of those capacities. The field developed from [[comparative psychology]], including the study of animal conditioning and learning. It has also been strongly influenced by research in [[ethology]], [[behavioral ecology]], and [[evolutionary psychology]], and hence the alternative name [[cognitive ethology]] is sometimes used. Many behaviors associated with the term ''animal intelligence'' are also subsumed within animal cognition.&lt;ref name ="Shettleworth"&gt;{{cite book|author=Shettleworth, S.J.|year=2010|title=Cognition, Evolution and Behavior|edition=2|publisher=Oxford Press, New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historical background ==
===Morgan's Canon===
{{main|Morgan's Canon}}
Coined by 19th-century British psychologist [[C. Lloyd Morgan]], Morgan's Canon remains a fundamental precept of [[comparative psychology|comparative (animal) psychology]]. In its developed form, it states that:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Morgan, C.L.|year=1903|title=An Introduction to Comparative Psychology|edition=2|publisher=W. Scott, London|pages=59}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;In no case is an animal activity to be interpreted in terms of higher psychological processes if it can be fairly interpreted in terms of processes which stand lower in the scale of psychological evolution and development.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In other words, Morgan believed that [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] approaches to animal behavior were fallacious, and that people should only consider behaviour as, for example, rational, purposive or affectionate, if there is no other explanation in terms of the behaviours of more primitive life-forms to which we do not attribute those faculties.

=== From anecdote to laboratory ===

The behavior of non-human animals has captivated human imagination from antiquity, and over the centuries many writers have speculated about the animal mind, or its absence.&lt;ref&gt;Descartes, R. (1649), ''Passions of the Soul''&lt;/ref&gt;  Speculation about animal intelligence gradually yielded to scientific study after [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]] placed humans and animals on a continuum, although Darwin's largely anecdotal approach to the topic would not pass scientific muster later on.&lt;ref&gt;Darwin, C. 1871, ''The descent of man, and selection in relation to sex''&lt;/ref&gt;  Unsatisfied with the anecdotal method of Darwin and his protégé J. G. Romanes,&lt;ref&gt;Romanes, J. G. 1883, ''Animal Intelligence''&lt;/ref&gt; [[E. L. Thorndike]] brought animal behavior into the laboratory for objective scrutiny.  Thorndike's careful observations of the escape of cats, dogs, and chicks from puzzle boxes led him to conclude that what appears to the naive human observer to be intelligent behavior may be strictly attributable to simple associations.  According to Thorndike, using Morgan's Canon, the inference of animal reason, insight, or consciousness is unnecessary and misleading.&lt;ref&gt;Thorndike, E. L. 1911, ''Animal intelligence''.&lt;/ref&gt;  At about the same time,  [[I. P. Pavlov]] began his seminal studies of conditioned reflexes in dogs.  Pavlov quickly abandoned attempts to infer canine mental processes; such attempts, he said, led only to disagreement and confusion. He was, however, willing to propose unseen physiological processes that might explain his observations.&lt;ref&gt;Pavlov, I.P. 1928, ''Lectures on conditioned reflexes''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The behavioristic half-century ===

The work of Thorndike, Pavlov and a little later of the outspoken behaviorist [[John B. Watson]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Watson | first1 = J. B. | year = 1913 | title = Psychology as the Behaviorist Views it. | url = | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 20 | issue = 2| pages = 158–177 | doi=10.1037/h0074428| hdl = 21.11116/0000-0001-9182-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  set the direction of much research on animal behavior for more than half a century.  During this time there was considerable progress in understanding simple associations; notably, around 1930 the differences between Thorndike's [[Operant conditioning|instrumental (or operant) conditioning]] and Pavlov's [[Classical conditioning|classical (or Pavlovian) conditioning]] were clarified, first by Miller and Kanorski, and then by [[B. F. Skinner]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Miller | first1 = S. | last2 = Konorski | first2 = J. | year = 1928 | title = Sur une forme particulière des reflexes conditionels | url = | journal = Comptes Rendus des Séances de la Société de Biologie et de Ses Filiales | volume = 99 | issue = | pages = 1155–1157 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B. F. (1932) ''The Behavior of Organisms''&lt;/ref&gt;  Many experiments on conditioning followed; they generated some complex theories,&lt;ref&gt;Hull, C. L. (1943) ''The Principles of Behavior''&lt;/ref&gt; but they made little or no reference to intervening mental processes.   Probably the most explicit dismissal of the idea that mental processes control behavior was the [[radical behaviorism]] of Skinner. This view seeks to explain behavior, including "private events" like mental images, solely by reference to the environmental contingencies impinging on the human or animal.&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B. F. ''About Behaviorism'' 1976&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the predominantly behaviorist orientation of research before 1960, the rejection of mental processes in animals was not universal during those years. Influential exceptions included, for example, [[Wolfgang Köhler]] and his insightful chimpanzees&lt;ref&gt;Köhler, W. (1917) ''The Mentality of Apes''&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Edward Tolman]] whose proposed [[cognitive map]] was a significant contribution to subsequent cognitive research in both humans and animals.&lt;ref&gt;Tolman, E. C. (1948) ''Cognitive maps in rats and men'' Psychological Review, 55, 189-208&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The cognitive revolution ===
Beginning around 1960, a "[[Cognitive psychology|cognitive revolution]]" in research on humans&lt;ref&gt;Niesser, U. (1967) ''Cognitive Psychology''&lt;/ref&gt;  gradually spurred a similar transformation of research with animals.  Inference to processes not directly observable became acceptable and then commonplace. An important proponent of this shift in thinking was [[Donald O. Hebb]],  who argued that "mind" is simply a name for processes in the head that control complex behavior, and that it is both necessary and possible to infer those processes from behavior.&lt;ref&gt;p. 3,  Hebb, D. O. 1958 '' A Textbook of Psychology''&lt;/ref&gt;  Animals came to be seen as  "goal seeking agents that acquire, store, retrieve, and internally process information at many levels of cognitive complexity".&lt;ref name="Menzel"&gt;p. 2 , Menzel, R. &amp; Fischer, J. (2010) ''Animal Thinking: Contemporary Issues in Comparative Cognition''&lt;/ref&gt; The remainder of this article touches many areas of research that have appeared or greatly progressed since this seminal change in thinking, and many of the theoretical and empirical findings that have captured wide attention.

== Methods ==
The acceleration of research on animal cognition in the last 50 years or so has led to a rapid expansion in the variety of species studied and methods employed.  The remarkable behavior of large-brained animals such as [[primates]] and [[cetacea]] has claimed special attention, but all sorts of mammals large and small, birds, fish, ants, bees, and others have been brought into the laboratory or observed in carefully controlled field studies.  In the laboratory,  animals push levers, pull strings, dig for food, swim in water mazes, or respond to images on computer screens in discrimination, [[attention]], [[memory]], and [[categorization]] experiments.&lt;ref name="Wass"&gt;p.8 ff, Wasserman &amp; Zentall (eds) (2006)  ''Comparative Cognition''&lt;/ref&gt;  Careful field studies explore memory for food caches, navigation by stars,{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} communication, tool use, identification of [[Conspecificity|conspecifics]], and many other matters. Studies often focus on the behavior of animals in their natural environments and discuss the putative function of the behavior for the propagation and survival of the species. These developments reflect an increased cross-fertilization from related fields such as [[ethology]] and [[behavioral ecology]].  Also, contributions from [[behavioral neuroscience]] are beginning to clarify the physiological substrate of some inferred mental process.

Some researchers have made effective use of a [[Jean Piaget|Piagetian]] methodology, taking tasks which human children are known to master at different stages of development, and investigating which of them can be performed by particular species. Others have been inspired by concerns for [[animal welfare]] and the management of domestic species: for example [[Temple Grandin]] has harnessed her unique expertise in animal welfare and the ethical treatment of farm livestock to highlight underlying similarities between humans and other animals.&lt;ref&gt;Grandin, Temple (2009) ''Animals Make Us Human: Creating the Best life for Animals'' (with Catherine Johnson)&lt;/ref&gt; From a methodological point of view, one of the main risks in this sort of work is [[anthropomorphism]], the tendency to interpret an animal's behavior in terms of human [[feeling]]s, thoughts, and motivations.&lt;ref name="Shettleworth"/&gt;

== Research questions ==
[[File:Chimpanzee and stick.jpg|250px|thumb|right|The common chimpanzee can use tools. This individual is using a stick to get food.]]
Human and non-human animal cognition have much in common, and this is reflected in the research summarized below; most of the headings found here might also appear in an article on human cognition. Of course, research in the two also differs in important respects.  Notably, much research with humans either studies or involves language, and much research with animals is related directly or indirectly to behaviors important to survival in natural settings. Following are summaries of some of the major areas of research in animal cognition.

=== Perception ===
Animals process information from eyes, ears, and other sensory organs to perceive the environment.  Perceptual processes have been studied in many species, with results that are often similar to those in humans. Equally interesting are those perceptual processes that differ from, or go beyond those found in humans, such as [[Animal echolocation|echolocation]] in bats and dolphins, motion detection by [[Lateral line|skin receptors]] in fish, and extraordinary visual acuity, motion sensitivity and ability to see ultraviolet light in some [[Bird vision|birds]].&lt;ref&gt;Stebbins, W. C. &amp; M. A. Berkley (1990) ''Comparative Perception,Vol. I, Basic Mechanisms; Vol. II, Complex Signals'' New York: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Attention ===
Much of what is happening in the world at any moment is irrelevant to current behavior. [[Attention]] refers to mental processes that select relevant information, inhibit irrelevant information, and switch among these as the situation demands.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, E. E., and Kosslyn, S. M. (2007) "Cognitive Psychology: Mind and Brain" Pearson Prentice Hall.&lt;/ref&gt;   Often the selective process is tuned before relevant information appears; such expectation makes for rapid selection of key stimuli when they become available. A large body of research has explored the way attention and expectation affect the behavior of non-human animals, and much of this work suggests that attention operates in birds, mammals and reptiles in much the same way that it does in humans.&lt;ref&gt;Blough, D. S. (2006)  Reaction-time explorations of visual attention, perception, and decision in pigeons. In E. A. Wasserman &amp; T. R. Zentall (Eds) ''Comparative Cognition: Experimental Explorations of Animal Intelligence''   pp. 89-105. New York: Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Selective learning ====
Animals trained to discriminate between two stimuli, say black versus white, can be said to attend to the "brightness dimension," but this says little about whether this dimension is selected in preference to others. More enlightenment comes from experiments that allow the animal to choose from several alternatives.  For example, several studies have shown that performance is better on, for example, a color discrimination (e.g. blue vs green) after the animal has learned another color discrimination (e.g. red vs orange) than it is after training on a different dimension such as an X shape versus and O shape. The reverse effect happens after training on forms. Thus, the earlier learning appears to affect which dimension, color or form, the animal will attend to.&lt;ref&gt;N. J. Mackintosh (1983) ''Conditioning and Associative Learning'' New York: Oxford&lt;/ref&gt;

Other experiments have shown that after animals have learned to respond to one aspect of the environment responsiveness to other aspects is suppressed.  In "blocking", for example, an animal is conditioned to respond to one stimulus ("A") by pairing that stimulus with reward or punishment.  After the animal responds consistently to A, a second stimulus ("B") accompanies A on additional training trials.  Later tests with the B stimulus alone elicit little response, suggesting that learning about B has been blocked by prior learning about A.&lt;ref&gt;Kamin, L. J. (1969) Predictability, surprise, attention, and conditioning.  In Campbell and Church (eds.) ''Punishment and Aversive Behavior'', New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts pp. 279-296&lt;/ref&gt;   This result supports the hypothesis that stimuli are neglected if they fail to provide new information.  Thus, in the experiment just cited,  the animal failed to attend to B because B added no information to that supplied by A.  If true, this interpretation is an important insight into attentional processing, but this conclusion remains uncertain because blocking and several related phenomena can be explained by models of conditioning that do not invoke attention.&lt;ref&gt;Mackintosh, N. J. (1994) ''Animal Learning and Cognition'' San Diego: Academic Press&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Divided attention ====
Attention is a limited resource and is not an all-or-nothing response:  the more attention devoted to one aspect of the environment, the less is available for others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zentall | first1 = T. R. | year = 2004 | title = Selective and divided attention in animals | url = | journal = Behavioural Processes | volume = 69 | issue = 1| pages = 1–16 | doi=10.1016/j.beproc.2005.01.004| pmid = 15795066 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A number of experiments have studied this in animals.   In one experiment, a tone and a light are presented simultaneously to pigeons.  The pigeons gain a reward only by choosing the correct combination of the two stimuli (e.g. a high frequency tone together with a yellow light).  The birds perform well at this task, presumably by dividing attention between the two stimuli.  When only one of the stimuli varies and the other is presented at its rewarded value, discrimination improves on the variable stimulus but discrimination on the alternative stimulus worsens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Blough | first1 = D. S. | year = 1969 | title = Attention shifts in a maintained discrimination | url = | journal = [[Science (journal)|Science]] | volume = 166 | issue = 3901| pages = 125–126 | doi=10.1126/science.166.3901.125|bibcode = 1969Sci...166..125B }}&lt;/ref&gt;  These outcomes are consistent with the notion that attention is a limited resource that can be more or less focused among incoming stimuli.

==== Visual search and attentional priming ====
As noted above, the function of attention is to select information that is of special use to the animal.  Visual search typically calls for this sort of selection, and search tasks have been used extensively in both humans and animals to determine the characteristics of attentional selection and the factors that control it.

Experimental research on visual search in animals was initially prompted by field observations published by Luc Tinbergen (1960).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tinbergen | first1 = L | year = 1960 | title = The natural control of insects in pine woods: I. Factors influencing the intensity of predation by songbirds | url = | journal = Archives Néerlandaises de Zoologie | volume = 13 | issue = | pages = 265–343 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tinbergen observed that birds are selective when foraging for insects. For example, he found that birds tended to catch the same type of insect repeatedly even though several types were available. Tinbergen suggested that this prey selection was caused by an attentional bias that improved detection of one type of insect while suppressing detection of others.  This "attentional priming" is commonly said to result from a pretrial activation of a mental representation of the attended object, which Tinbergen called a "searching image".

Tinbergen's field observations on priming have been supported by a number of experiments. For example, Pietrewicz and Kamil (1977, 1979)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pietrewicz | first1 = A. T. | last2 = Kamil | first2 = A. C. | year = 1977 | title = Visual Detection of Cryptic Prey by Blue Jays (''Cyanocitta cristata'') | url = http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1014&amp;context=biosciaviancog| journal = Science | volume = 195 | issue = 4278| pages = 580–582 | doi=10.1126/science.195.4278.580| pmid = 17732294 |bibcode = 1977Sci...195..580P }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pietrewicz | first1 = A. T. Kamil | year = 1979 | title = Search image formation in the blue jay ''(Cyanocitta cristata).'' | url = http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1065&amp;context=bioscibehavior| journal = Science | volume = 204 | issue = 4399| pages = 1332–1333 | doi=10.1126/science.204.4399.1332|bibcode = 1979Sci...204.1332P | pmid=17813172}}&lt;/ref&gt; presented blue jays with pictures of tree trunks upon which rested either a moth of species A, a moth of species B, or no moth at all.  The birds were rewarded for pecks at a picture showing a moth. Crucially, the probability with which a particular species of moth was detected was higher after repeated trials with that species  (e.g. A, A, A,...) than it was after a mixture of trials (e.g. A, B, B, A, B, A, A...).  These results suggest again that sequential encounters with an object can establish an attentional predisposition to see the object.

Another way to produce attentional priming in search is to provide an advance signal that is associated with the target.  For example, if a person hears a song sparrow he or she may be predisposed to detect a song sparrow in a shrub, or among other birds.  A number of experiments have reproduced this effect in animal subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Blough | first1 = P. M. | year = 1989 | title = Attentional priming and visual search in pigeons | url = |journal=[[Journal of Experimental Psychology: Animal Learning and Cognition]] | volume = 17 | issue = | pages = 292–298 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kamil, A.C. &amp; Bond, A. B. (2006) Selective attention, priming, and foraging behavior. In E. A. Wasserman and T. R. Zentall(eds) ''Comparative Cognition:  Experimental Exploration of Animal Intelligence'' New York: Oxford&lt;/ref&gt;

Still other experiments have explored nature of stimulus factors that affect the speed and accuracy of visual search.  For example, the time taken to find a single target increases as the number of items in the visual field increases.  This rise in RT is steep if the distracters are similar to the target, less steep if they are dissimilar, and may not occur if the distracters are very different in from the target in form or color.&lt;ref&gt;Blough, D. S. &amp; Blough, P. M. (1990) Reaction-time assessments of visual processes in pigeons. In M. Berkley &amp; W. Stebbins (Eds.) ''Comparative perception'' (pp. 245-276). New York:Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Concepts and categories ===
Fundamental but difficult to define, the [[concept]] of "concept" was discussed for hundreds of years by philosophers before it became a focus of psychological study.  Concepts enable humans and animals to organize the world into functional groups; the groups may be composed of perceptually similar objects or events, diverse things that have a common function, relationships such as same versus different,  or relations among relations such as analogies.&lt;ref name =Cats&gt;E. E. Smith &amp; D. L. Medin (1981) ''Categories and Concepts''  Harvard Univ. Press&lt;/ref&gt;     Extensive discussions on these matters together with many references may be found in Shettleworth (2010)&lt;ref name ="Shettleworth" /&gt;  Wasserman and Zentall (2006)&lt;ref name="Wass"/&gt; and in Zentall ''et al.'' (2008).  The latter is freely available online.&lt;ref name = Zentall&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zentall | first1 = T. R. | last2 = Wasserman | first2 = E. A. | last3 = Lazareva | first3 = O.

J. | year = 2008 | title = Concept Learning in Animals | url = | journal = Comparative Cognition &amp; Behavior Reviews | volume = 3 | issue = | pages = 13–45 | doi = 10.3819/ccbr.2008.30002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Methods ====
Most work on animal concepts has been done with visual stimuli, which can easily be constructed and presented in great variety, but auditory and other stimuli have been used as well.&lt;ref&gt;Dooling, R. J., &amp; Okanoya, K. (1995). Psychophysical methods for assessing perceptual categories. In G. M.Klump, R. J.Dooling, R. R.Fay, &amp; W. C.Stebbins (Eds.)," Methods in Comparative Psychoacoustics" (pp. 307–318). Basel, Switzerland: Birkhäuser Verlag.&lt;/ref&gt; Pigeons have been widely used, for they have excellent vision and are readily conditioned to respond to visual targets; other birds and a number of other animals have been studied as well.&lt;ref name="Shettleworth" /&gt;
In a typical experiment, a bird or other animal confronts a computer monitor on which a large number of pictures appear one by one, and the subject gets a reward for pecking or touching a picture of a category item and no reward for non-category items.   Alternatively, a subject may be offered a choice between two or more pictures.  Many experiments end with the presentation of items never seen before; successful sorting of these items shows that the animal has not simply learned many specific stimulus-response associations. A related method, sometimes used to study relational concepts,  is matching-to-sample. In this task an animal sees one stimulus and then chooses between two or more alternatives, one of which is the same as the first;  the animal is then rewarded for choosing the matching stimulus.&lt;ref name = "Shettleworth"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wass/&gt;&lt;ref name =Zentall/&gt;

==== Perceptual categories ====
Perceptual categorization is said to occur when a person or animal responds in a similar way to a range of stimuli that share common features.  For example, a squirrel climbs a tree when it sees Rex, Shep, or Trixie, which suggests that it categorizes all three as something to avoid.  This sorting of instances into groups is crucial to survival.  Among other things, an animal must categorize if it is to apply learning about one object (e.g. Rex bit me) to new instances of that category (dogs may bite).&lt;ref name = "Shettleworth"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wass/&gt;&lt;ref name = Zentall/&gt;

===== Natural categories =====
Many animals readily classify objects by perceived differences in form or color.  For example, bees or pigeons quickly learn to choose any red object and reject any green object if red leads to reward and green does not.  Seemingly much more difficult is an animal's ability to categorize natural objects that vary a great deal in color and form even while belonging to the same group.   In a classic study, [[Richard J. Herrnstein]] trained pigeons to respond to the presence or absence of human beings in photographs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Herrnstein | first1 = R. J. | year = 1964 | title = Complex Visual Concept in the Pigeon | url = | journal = Science | volume = 146 | issue = 3643| pages = 549–551 | doi=10.1126/science.146.3643.549|bibcode = 1964Sci...146..549H }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The birds readily learned to peck photos that contained partial or full views of humans and to avoid pecking photos with no human, despite great differences in the form, size, and color of both the humans displayed and in the non-human pictures.  In follow-up studies, pigeons categorized other natural objects (e.g. trees) and after training they were able without reward to sort photos they had not seen before .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Herrnstein | first1 = R. J. | year = 1979 | title = Acquisition, Generalization, and Discrimination Reversal of a Natural Concept | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Psychology: Animal Behavior Processes | volume = 5 | issue = 2| pages = 116–129 | doi=10.1037/0097-7403.5.2.116}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R. S. Bhatt, E. A. Wasserman, W.F.J. Reynolds, &amp; K. S.. Knauss (1988) "Conceptual behavior in pigeons: Categorization of both familiar and novel examples from four classes of natural and articifial stimuli." ''Journal of Experimental Psychology'': Animal Behavior Processes, 14, 219-234&lt;/ref&gt;  Similar work has been done with natural auditory categories, for example, bird songs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tu | first1 = H-W | last2 = Smith | first2 = E. | last3 = Dooling | first3 = R.

==== Functional or associative categories ====
Perceptually unrelated stimuli may come to be responded to as members of a class if they have a common use or lead to common consequences. An oft-cited study by Vaughan (1988) provides an example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Vaughan | first1 = W. | last2 = Jr | year = 1988 | title = Formation of equivalence sets in pigeons | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Psychology: Animal Behavior Process | volume = 14 | issue = | pages = 36–42 | doi=10.1037/0097-7403.14.1.36}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Vaughan divided a large set of unrelated pictures into two arbitrary sets, A and B.  Pigeons got food for pecking at pictures in set A but not for pecks at pictures in set B.  After they had learned this task fairly well, the outcome was reversed: items in set B led to food and items in set A did not. Then the outcome was reversed again, and then again,  and so on.   Vaughan found that after 20 or more reversals,  associating reward with a few pictures in one set caused the birds to respond to the other pictures in that set without further reward, as if they were thinking "if these pictures in set A bring food, the others in set A must also bring food."  That is, the birds now categorized the pictures in each set as functionally equivalent. Several other procedures have yielded similar results.&lt;ref name = "Shettleworth"/&gt;&lt;ref name = Zentall/&gt;

==== Relational or abstract categories ====
When tested in a simple stimulus matching-to-sample task (described above) many animals readily learn specific item combinations, such as "touch red if the sample is red, touch green if the sample is green."  But this does not demonstrate that they distinguish between "same" and "different" as general concepts.  Better evidence is provided if, after training, an animal successfully makes a choice that matches a novel sample that it has never seen before.  Monkeys and chimpanzees do learn to do this, as do pigeons if they are given a great deal of practice with many different stimuli. However,  because the sample is presented first, successful matching might mean that the animal is simply choosing the most recently seen "familiar" item rather than the conceptually "same" item. A number of studies have attempted to distinguish these possibilities, with mixed results.&lt;ref name = "Shettleworth"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Zentall/&gt;

==== Rule learning ====
The use of rules has sometimes been considered an ability restricted to humans, but a number of experiments have shown evidence of simple rule learning in primates&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = See | last2 = D'Amato | first2 = M. | last3 = Columbo | first3 = M. | year = 1988 | title = ''Representation of serial order in monkeys (''Cebus apella") | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Psychology: Animal Behavior Processes | volume = 14 | issue = | pages = 11–139 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and also in other animals.  Much of the evidence has come from studies of sequence learning in which the "rule" consists of the order in which a series of events occurs.  Rule use is shown if the animal learns to discriminate different orders of events and transfers this discrimination to new events arranged in the same order.   For example,  Murphy ''et al.'' (2008)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Murphy | first1 = R. A. | last2 = Mondragon | first2 = E. | last3 = Murphy | first3 = V. A. | year = 2008 | title = Rule learning by rats | url = http://www.cal-r.org/mondragon/home/Papers/MurphyMondragonMurphy-08.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Science | volume = 319 | issue = 5871| pages = 1849–1851 | doi=10.1126/science.1151564| pmid = 18369151 |bibcode = 2008Sci...319.1849M }}&lt;/ref&gt; trained rats to discriminate between visual sequences.  For one group ABA and BAB were rewarded, where A="bright light" and B="dim light".  Other stimulus triplets were not rewarded.  The rats learned the visual sequence, although both bright and dim lights were equally associated with reward.  More importantly, in a second experiment with auditory stimuli, rats responded correctly to sequences of novel stimuli that were arranged in the same order as those previously learned.  Similar sequence learning has been demonstrated in birds and other animals as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kundrey | first1 = S. M.

=== Memory ===
The categories that have been developed to analyze [[memory|human memory]] ([[short term memory]], [[long term memory]], [[working memory]]) have been applied to the study of animal memory, and some of the phenomena characteristic of human short term memory (e.g. the [[serial position effect]]) have been detected in animals, particularly [[monkey]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Wright |last2 = Santiago |last3 = Sands |last4 = Kendrick |last5 = Cook |year = 1985 |title = Memory processing of serial lists by pigeons, monkeys, and people |journal = Science |volume = 229 |pages = 287–289 |bibcode = 1985Sci...229..287W |first2 = Hector C. |first3 = Stephen F. |first4 = Donald F. |first5 = Robert G. |doi = 10.1126/science.9304205 |pmid = 9304205 |first1 = AA |issue = 4710 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However most progress has been made in the analysis of [[spatial memory]]; some of this work has sought to clarify the physiological basis of spatial memory and the role of the [[hippocampus]]; other work has explored the spatial memory of [[scatter-hoarder]] animals such as [[Clark's nutcracker]], certain [[jay]]s, [[tit (bird)|tits]] and certain [[squirrel]]s, whose ecological niches require them to remember the locations of thousands of caches,&lt;ref name = "Shettleworth"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Balda |first1 = R. |last2 = Kamil |first2 = A.

====Methods====
As in humans, research with animals distinguishes between "working" or "short-term" memory from "reference" or long-term memory.  Tests of working memory evaluate memory for events that happened in the recent past, usually within the last few seconds or minutes.  Tests of reference memory evaluate memory for regularities such as "pressing a lever brings food" or "children give me peanuts".

=====Habituation=====
{{main|Habituation}}
This is one of the simplest tests for memory spanning a short time interval. The test compares an animal's response to a stimulus or event on one occasion to its response on a previous occasion.  If the second response differs consistently from the first, the animal must have remembered something about the first, unless some other factor such as motivation, sensory sensitivity, or the test stimulus has changed.

=====Delayed response=====
Delayed response tasks are often used to study short-term memory in animals.  Introduced by Hunter (1913), a typical delayed response task presents an animal with a stimulus such a colored light, and after a short time interval the animal chooses among alternatives that match the stimulus, or are related to the stimulus in some other way. In Hunter's studies, for example, a light appeared briefly in one of three goal boxes and then later the animal chose among the boxes, finding food behind the one that had been lighted.&lt;ref&gt;Hunter, W. S. (1913) "The delayed reaction in animals and children" Behavior Monographs, 2&lt;/ref&gt; Most research has been done with some variation of the "delayed matching-to-sample" task. For example, in the initial study with this task, a pigeon was presented with a flickering or steady light. Then, a few seconds later, two pecking keys were illuminated, one with a steady light and one with a flickering light. The bird got food if it pecked the key that matched the original stimulus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Blough | first1 = D. S. | year = 1958 | title = Delayed matching in the pigeon | url = | journal = Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior | volume = 2 | issue = 2| pages = 151–160 | doi=10.1901/jeab.1959.2-151| pmid = 13801643 | pmc = 1403892}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A commonly-used variation of the matching-to-sample task requires the animal to use the initial stimulus to control a later choice between different stimuli. For example, if the initial stimulus is a black circle, the animal learns to choose "red" after the delay; if it is a black square, the correct choice is "green".  Ingenious variations of this method have been used to explore many aspects of memory, including forgetting due to interference and memory for multiple items.&lt;ref name="Shettleworth"/&gt;

=====Radial arm maze=====
{{main|Radial arm maze}}
The [[radial arm maze]] is used to test memory for spatial location and to determine the mental processes by which location is determined.  In a radial maze test, an animal is placed on a small platform from which paths lead in various directions to goal boxes; the animal finds food in one or more goal boxes. Having found food in a box, the animal must return to the central platform.  The maze may be used to test both reference and working memory.  Suppose, for example, that over a number of sessions the same 4 arms of an 8-arm maze always lead to food. If in a later test session the animal goes to a box that has never been baited, this indicates a failure of reference memory.  On the other hand, if the animal goes to a box that it has already emptied during the same test session, this indicates a failure of working memory.  Various confounding factors, such as odor [[Sensory cue|cue]]s, are carefully controlled in such experiments.&lt;ref&gt;Shettleworth, S. J. (2010)  "Cognition, Evolution, and Behavior"  New York: Oxford&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Water maze=====
{{main|Morris water navigation task}}
The [[Water maze (neuroscience)|water maze]] is used to test an animal's memory for spatial location and to discover how an animal is able to determine locations. Typically the maze is a circular tank filled with water that has been made milky so that it is opaque. Located somewhere in the maze is small platform placed just below the surface of the water. When placed in the tank, the animal swims around until it finds and climbs up on the platform. With practice, the animal finds the platform more and more quickly. Reference memory is assessed by removing the platform and observing the relative amount of time the animal spends swimming in the area where the platform had been located.  Visual and other cues in and around the tank may be varied to assess the animal's reliance on landmarks and the geometric relations among them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Vorhees | first1 = C.

=== Spatial cognition ===
Whether an animal ranges over a territory of measured in square kilometers or square meters, its survival typically depends on its ability to do such things as find a food source and then return to its nest. Sometimes such a task can be performed rather simply, for example by following a chemical trail. Typically, however, the animal must somehow acquire and use information about locations, directions, and distances. The following paragraphs outline some of the ways that animals do this.&lt;ref name="Shettleworth"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pigeon.psy.tufts.edu"&gt;[http://pigeon.psy.tufts.edu/asc/toc.htm Animal Spatial Cognition:Comparative, Neural &amp; Computational Approaches]&lt;/ref&gt; 
*'''Beacons''' Animals often learn what their nest or other goal looks like, and if it is within sight they may simply move toward it; it is said to serve as a "beacon".
*'''Landmarks''' When an animal is unable to see its goal, it may learn the appearance of nearby objects and use these landmarks as guides.  Researchers working with birds and bees have demonstrated this by moving prominent objects in the vicinity of nest sites, causing returning foragers to hunt for their nest in a new location.&lt;ref name="Shettleworth"/&gt;
*'''Dead reckoning''' [[Dead reckoning]], also known as "path integration," is the process of computing one's position by starting from a known location and keeping track of the distances and directions subsequently traveled. Classic experiments have shown that the [[desert ant]] keeps track of its position in this way as it wanders for many meters searching for food. Though it travels in a randomly twisted path, it heads straight home when it finds food.  However, if the ant is picked up and released some meters to the east, for example, it heads for a location displaced by the same amount to the east of its home nest.
*'''Cognitive maps''' Some animals appear to construct a [[cognitive map]] of their surroundings, meaning that they acquire and use information that enables them to compute how far and in what direction to go to get from one location to another. Such a map-like representation is thought to be used, for example, when an animal goes directly from one food source to another even though its previous experience has involved only travel between each source and home.&lt;ref name="Shettleworth"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author = Lund, Nick |title = Animal cognition |publisher = Psychology Press |year = 2002 |isbn = 978-0-415-25298-0 |page = 4 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Ti4cgStf6q8C&amp;pg=PA4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Research in this area&lt;ref name="pigeon.psy.tufts.edu"/&gt; has also explored such topics as the use of geometric properties of the environment by rats and pigeons, and the ability of [[rat]]s to represent a spatial pattern in either [[radial arm maze]]s or [[Morris water navigation task|water mazes]]. Spatial cognition is sometimes explored in [[visual search]] experiments in which a human or animal searches the environment for a particular object.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}
*'''Detour behaviour''' Some animals appear to have an advanced understanding of their spatial environment and will not take the most direct route if this confers an advantage to them.  Some jumping spiders take an indirect route to prey rather than the most direct route, thereby indicating flexibility in behaviour and route planning, and possibly insight learning.&lt;ref name="Sherwin, 2001"&gt;Sherwin, C.M., (2001).

====Long-distance navigation; homing====

{{main|Animal navigation}}
Many animals travel hundreds or thousands of miles in seasonal migrations or returns to breeding grounds. They may be guided by the sun, the stars, the polarization of light, magnetic cues, olfactory cues, winds, or a combination of these.&lt;ref&gt;Gauthreaux, Sidney A. (1980). Animal Migration, Orientation, and Navigation. Academic Press&lt;/ref&gt; This extensive area of research is covered in the main article on [[Animal navigation]].

It has been hypothesized that animals such as apes and wolves are good at spatial cognition because this skill is necessary for survival. Some researchers argue that this ability may have diminished somewhat in dogs because humans have provided necessities such as food and shelter during some 15,000 years of domestication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Savolainen|first=Peter|first2=Ya-Ping |first3=Jing |first4=Joakim |first5=Thomas |title=Genetic evidence for an East Asian origin of domestic dogs|date=22 November 2002|volume=298|pages=1060–1062|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/298/5598/1610.full.pdf|bibcode=2002Sci...298.1610S|last2=Zhang|last3=Luo|last4=Lundeberg|last5=Leitner|journal=Science|doi=10.1126/science.1073906|issue=5598|pmid=12446907}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fiset|first=Sylvain|author2=Vickie Plourde|title=Object permanence in domestic dogs (Canis lupus familiaris) and gray wolves (Canis lupus)|journal=Journal of Comparative Psychology|date=29 October 2012|pages=115–127|doi=10.1037/a0030595|pmid=23106804|volume=127|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brauer|first=Juliane|author2=Juliane Kaminski |author3=Julia Riedel |author4=Josep Call |author5=Michael Tomasello |title=Making inferences about the location of hidden food: social dog, causal ape|journal=Journal of Comparative Psychology|year=2006|volume=120|issue=1|pages=38–47|doi=10.1037/0735-7036.120.1.38|pmid=16551163}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Timing ===
{{further|Time perception}}

==== Time of day: circadian rhythms ====
{{main|Circadian rhythms}}
The behavior of most animals is synchronized with the earth's daily light-dark cycle.  Thus, many animals are active during the day, others are active at night, still others near dawn and dusk. Though one might think that these "circadian rhythms" are controlled simply by the presence or absence of light, nearly every animal that has been studied has been shown to have a "biological clock" that yields cycles of activity even when the animal is in constant illumination or darkness.&lt;ref name = "Shettleworth" /&gt; Circadian rhythms are so automatic and fundamental to living things&amp;nbsp;– they occur even in plants&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Webb |first1 = Alex A.R. |year = 2003 |title = The physiology of circadian rhythms in plants |journal = New Phytologist |volume = 160 |pages = 281–303 |doi = 10.1046/j.1469-8137.2003.00895.x |issue = 2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; – that they are usually discussed separately from cognitive processes, and the reader is referred to the main article ([[Circadian rhythms]]) for further information.&lt;ref name = "ComparativeTime"&gt;APA Handboook of Comparative Psychology, Vol 2 "Perception, Learning and Cognition",(2017), Call,J.(Ed),  Chapter 23,"Timing in Animals", APA Washington D.C.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Interval timing ====
Survival often depends on an animal's ability to time intervals. For example, rufous hummingbirds feed on the nectar of flowers, and they often return to the same flower, but only after the flower has had enough time to replenish its supply of nectar. In one experiment hummingbirds fed on artificial flowers that quickly emptied of nectar but were refilled at some fixed time (e.g. twenty minutes) later. The birds learned to come back to the flowers at about the right time, learning the refill rates of up to eight separate flowers and remembering how long ago they had visited each one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Henderson |year = 2006 |title = Timing in free-living rufous hummingbirds, ''Selasphorus rufus'' |journal = Current Biology |volume = 16 |pages = 512–515 |doi = 10.1016/j.cub.2006.01.054 |pmid = 16527747 |last2 = Hurly |first2 = TA |last3 = Bateson |first3 = M |last4 = Healy |first4 = SD |issue = 5 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The details of interval timing have been studied in a number of species.  One of the most common methods is the "peak procedure". In a typical experiment, a rat in an [[operant chamber]] presses a lever for food.  A light comes on, a lever-press brings a food pellet at a fixed later time, say 10 seconds, and then the light goes off. Timing is measured during occasional test trials on which no food is presented and the light stays on.  On these test trials, the rat presses the lever more and more until about 10 sec and then, when no food comes, gradually stops pressing.  The time at which the rat presses most on these test trials is taken to be its estimate of the payoff time.

Experiments using the peak procedure and other methods have shown that animals can time short intervals quite exactly, can time more than one event at once, and can integrate time with spatial and other cues. Such tests have also been used for quantitative tests of theories of animal timing, such as Gibbon's [[Scalar expectancy|Scalar Expectancy Theory]] ("SET"),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gibbon | first1 = J | year = 1977 | title = Scalar expectancy theory and Weber's law in animal timing | url = | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 84 | issue = 3| pages = 279–325 | doi=10.1037/0033-295x.84.3.279}}&lt;/ref&gt; Killeen's Behavioral Theory of Timing,&lt;ref&gt;Killeen, P.

Testing the Scalar Expectancy Theory (SET) and the Learning to Time model (LeT) in a double bisection task.

=== Tool and weapon use ===
{{Main|Tool use by animals}}
Although tool use was long assumed to be a uniquely human trait, there is now much evidence that many animals use tools, including mammals, birds, fish, cephalopods and insects. Discussions of tool use often involve a debate about what constitutes a "tool", and they often consider the relation of tool use to the animal's intelligence and brain size.

Tool use has been reported many times in both wild and captive [[primate]]s, particularly the great apes. The use of tools by primates is varied and includes hunting (mammals, invertebrates, fish), collecting honey, processing food (nuts, fruits, vegetables and seeds), collecting water, weapons and shelter.  Research in 2007 shows that chimpanzees in the [[Fongoli]] [[savannah]] sharpen sticks to use as [[spear]]s when hunting, considered the first evidence of systematic use of weapons in a species other than humans.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2007/02/070222-chimps-spears.html Chimps Use "Spears" to Hunt Mammals, Study Says] John Roach for National Geographic News (February 22, 2007) (accessed on June 12, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;  Other mammals that spontaneously use tools in the wild or in captivity include [[elephant]]s, [[bear]]s, [[cetacean]]s, [[sea otter]]s and [[mongoose]]s.

====Birds====
Several species of birds have been observed to use tools in the wild, including warblers, parrots, Egyptian vultures, brown-headed nuthatches, gulls and owls.  Some species, such as the [[woodpecker finch]] of the [[Galapagos Islands]], use particular tools as an essential part of their [[foraging]] behavior. However, these behaviors are often quite inflexible and cannot be applied effectively in new situations. A great many species of birds build nests with a wide range of complexities, but although nest-building behaviour fulfills the criteria of some definitions of "tool-use", this is not the case with other definitions.

Several species of [[corvid]]s have been trained to use tools in controlled experiments. One species examined extensively under laboratory conditions is the [[New Caledonian crow]]. One individual called “Betty” spontaneously made a wire tool to solve a novel problem. She was being tested to see whether she would select a wire hook rather than a straight wire to pull a little bucket of meat out of a well. Betty tried poking the straight wire at the meat. After a series of failures with this direct approach, she withdrew the wire and began directing it at the bottom of the well, which was secured to its base with duct tape. The wire soon became stuck, whereupon Betty pulled it sideways, bending it and unsticking it. She then inserted the hook into the well and extracted the meat. In all but one of 10 subsequent trials with only straight wire provided, she also made and used a hook in the same manner, but not before trying the straight wire first.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hunt|first=G.R|title=Manufacture and use of hook-tools by New Caledonian crows|journal=Nature|volume=379|pages=249–251|doi=10.1038/379249a0|year=1996|issue=6562|bibcode = 1996Natur.379..249H }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="psycnet"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shettleworth|first=Sara J.|title=Do Animals Have Insight, and What Is Insight Anyway?|journal=Canadian Journal of Experimental Psychology|year=2012|volume=66|issue=4|pages=217–226|doi=10.1037/a0030674|pmid=23231629|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/cep/66/4/217.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Fish====
Several species of [[wrasses]] have been observed using rocks as anvils to crack [[bivalve]] (scallops, urchins and clams) shells. This behavior was first filmed&lt;ref&gt;[http://scienceblog.com/48078/video-show-tool-use-by-a-fish/ Video shows first tool use by a fish]&lt;/ref&gt; in an orange-dotted tuskfish (''Choerodon anchorago'') in 2009 by Giacomo Bernardi. The fish fans sand to unearth the bivalve, takes it into its mouth, swims several meters to a rock, which it then uses as an anvil by smashing the mollusc apart with sideward thrashes of the head.  This behaviour has also been recorded in a [[blackspot tuskfish]] (''Choerodon schoenleinii'') on Australia's Great Barrier Reef, yellowhead wrasse (''[[Halichoeres garnoti]]'') in Florida and a six-bar wrasse (''[[Thalassoma hardwicke]]'') in an aquarium setting.  These species are at opposite ends of the phylogenetic tree in this [[Family (biology)|family]], so this behaviour may be a deep-seated trait in all wrasses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://bio.research.ucsc.edu/people/bernardi/Bernardi/Publications/2011Tools.pdf|title=The use of tools by wrasses (Labridae). |journal=Coral Reefs |volume=31 |pages=39 |doi=10.1007/s00338-011-0823-6|author=Bernardi, G.|year=2011|accessdate=July 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reasoning and problem solving ===

It is clear that animals of quite a range of species are capable of solving problems that appear to require abstract reasoning;&lt;ref&gt;For chimpanzees, see for example [[David Premack]] (1983) ''[[The Mind of an Ape#Other concepts|The Mind of an Ape]]''&lt;/ref&gt;  Wolfgang Köhler's (1917) work with chimpanzees is a famous early example. He observed that chimpanzees did not use trial and error to solve problems such as retrieving bananas hung out of reach. Instead, they behaved in a manner that was "unwaveringly purposeful," spontaneously placing boxes so that they could climb to reach the fruit.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfgang Köhler ''The Mentality of Apes'' (1917)&lt;/ref&gt; Modern research has identified similar behavior in animals usually thought of as much less intelligent, if appropriate pre-training is given.&lt;ref&gt;Pepperberg, I.

It has been shown that [[Barbados bullfinch]]es (''Loxigilla barbadensis'') from urbanized areas are better at innovative problem-solving tasks than bullfinches from rural environments, but that they did not differ in colour discrimination learning.&lt;ref name="Audet"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Audet, J.N. |author2=Ducatez, S. |author3=Lefebvre, L. |last-author-amp=yes |year=2015|title=The town bird and the country bird: problem solving and immunocompetence vary with urbanization|journal=Behavioral Ecology|volume=27|issue=2 |doi=10.1093/beheco/arv201 |pages=637–644}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cognitive bias===
{{main|Cognitive bias}}
[[File:Glass-of-water.jpg|thumb|150px|Is the glass half empty or half full?]]
A '''cognitive bias''' refers to a systematic pattern of deviation from norm or rationality in judgment, whereby inferences about other individuals or situations may be drawn in an illogical fashion.

Cognitive bias is sometimes illustrated by using answers to the question "[[Is the glass half empty or half full?]]". Choosing "half empty" is supposed to indicate pessimism whereas choosing "half full" indicates optimism. To test this in animals, an individual is trained to anticipate that stimulus A, e.g. a 100&amp;nbsp;Hz tone, precedes a positive event, e.g. highly desired food is delivered when a lever is pressed by the animal.  The same individual is trained to anticipate that stimulus B, e.g. a 900&amp;nbsp;Hz tone, precedes a negative event, e.g. bland food is delivered when the animal presses a lever. The animal is then tested by being given an intermediate stimulus C, e.g. a 500&amp;nbsp;Hz tone, and observing whether the animal presses the lever associated with the positive or negative reward.

=== Language ===
{{main|Animal language|Human-animal communication}}
{{further|Talking animal}}
The modeling of human language in animals is known as [[animal language]] research.  In addition to the ape-language experiments mentioned above, there have also been more or less successful attempts to teach language or language-like behavior to some non-primate species, including [[parrots]] and [[great spotted woodpecker]]s. Arguing from his own results with the animal [[Nim Chimpsky]] and his analysis of others results, Herbert Terrace criticized the idea that chimps can produce new sentences.&lt;ref&gt;Terrace, H., L.A. Petitto, R.J. Sanders, T.G. Bever(1979) Science 206 (4421): 891–902&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly thereafter [[Louis Herman]] published research on artificial language comprehension in the bottlenosed dolphin (Herman, Richards, &amp; Wolz, 1984). Though this sort of research has been controversial, especially among [[cognitive linguistics|cognitive linguists]], many researchers agree that many animals can understand the meaning of individual words, and that some may understand simple sentences and syntactic variations, but there is little evidence that any animal can produce new strings of symbols that correspond to new sentences.&lt;ref name = "Shettleworth"/&gt;

=== Insight ===
{{See also|Reason}}
[[Wolfgang Köhler]] is usually credited with introducing the concept of insight into experimental psychology.&lt;ref name="psycnet" /&gt;  Working with chimpanzees, Köhler came to dispute [[Edward Thorndike]]'s theory that animals must solve problems gradually, by trial and error. He said that Thorndike's animals could only use trial and error because the situation precluded other forms of problem solving. He provided chimps with a relatively unstructured situation, and he observed [[Eureka effect|sudden "ah-ha!"]] insightful changes of behavior, as, for example, when a chimp suddenly moved a box into position so that it could retrieve a banana.&lt;ref&gt;Köhler, W. "Mentality of Apes," 1917.&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, Asian elephants (''Elephas maximus'') were shown to exhibit similar insightful problem solving. A male was observed moving a box to a position where it could be stood upon to reach food that had been deliberately hung out of reach.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Foerder | first1 = P. | last2 = Galloway | first2 = M. | last3 = Barthel | first3 = T. | last4 = Moore De | first4 = D.

=== Numeracy ===
{{Main|Number sense in animals}}
A variety of studies indicates that animals are able to use and communicate quantitative information, and that some can count in a rudimentary way.  Some examples of this research follow.

In one study, rhesus monkeys viewed visual displays containing, for example, 1, 2, 3, or 4 items of different sorts. They were trained to respond to them in several ways involving numerical ordering, for example touching "1" first, "2" second and so on.  When tested with displays containing items they had never seen before, they continued to respond to them in order. The authors conclude that monkeys can represent the numerosities 1 to 9 at least on an ordinal scale.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.columbia.edu/cu/psychology/primatecognitionlab/References/BrannonTerrace2000.pdf Representation of the Numerosities 1-9 by Rhesus Macaques (Macaca) mulatto]&lt;/ref&gt;

Ants are able to use quantitative values and transmit this information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Reznikova | first1 = Zhanna | last2 = Ryabko | first2 = Boris | year = 2001 | title = A Study of Ants' Numerical Competence | url = | journal = [[Electronic Transactions on Artificial Intelligence]] | volume = 5 | issue = | pages = 111–126 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reznikova, Zh.

Other experiments have been conducted that show animals' abilities to differentiate between non-food quantities.  [[American black bear]]s demonstrated quantity differentiation abilities in a task with a computer screen.  The bears were trained to touch a computer monitor with a paw or nose to choose a quantity of dots in one of two boxes on the screen.  Each bear was trained with [[reinforcement]] to pick a larger or smaller amount.  During training, the bears were rewarded with food for a correct response.  All bears performed better than what random error predicted on the trials with static, non-moving dots, indicating that they could differentiate between the two quantities.  The bears choosing correctly in congruent (number of dots coincided with area of the dots) and incongruent (number of dots did not coincide with area of the dots) trials suggests that they were indeed choosing between quantities that appeared on the screen, not just a larger or smaller [[retina|retinal image]], which would indicate they are only judging size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Vonk | first1 = J. | last2 = Beran | first2 = M.J. | year = 2012 | title = Bears 'count' too: quantity estimation and comparison in black bears, Ursus americanus | url = | journal = Animal Behaviour | volume = 84 | issue = 1| pages = 231–238 | doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2012.05.001| pmid = 22822244 | pmc = 3398692 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bottlenose dolphin]]s have shown the ability to choose an array with fewer dots compared to one with more dots.  Experimenters set up two boards showing various numbers of dots in a poolside setup.  The dolphins were initially trained to choose the board with the fewer number of dots. This was done by rewarding the dolphin when it chose the board with the fewer number of dots.  In the experimental trials, two boards were set up, and the dolphin would emerge from the water and point to one board.  The dolphins chose the arrays with fewer dots at a rate much larger than chance, indicating they can differentiate between quantities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jaakkola | first1 = K. | last2 = Fellner | first2 = W. | last3 = Erb | first3 = L. | last4 = Rodriguez | first4 = M. | last5 = Guarino | first5 = E. | year = 2005 | title = Understanding of the concept of numerically "less" by bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) | url = | journal = Journal of Comparative Psychology | volume = 119 | issue = 3| pages = 296–303 | doi=10.1037/0735-7036.119.3.296 | pmid = 16131258 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
A particular [[grey parrot]], after training, has shown the ability to differentiate between the numbers zero through six using [[Talking bird|vocalizations]].  After number and vocalization training, this was done by asking the parrot how many objects there were in a display.  The parrot was able to identify the correct amount at a rate higher than chance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pepperberg | first1 = I | year = 2006 | title = Grey parrot numerical competence: a review | url = | journal = Anim Cogn | volume = 9 | issue = 4| pages = 377–391 | doi=10.1007/s10071-006-0034-7| pmid = 16909236 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Pterophyllum|Angelfish]], when put in an unfamiliar environment will group together with conspecifics, an action named [[Shoaling and schooling|shoaling]].  Given the choice between two groups of differing size, the angelfish will choose the larger of the two groups.  This can be seen with a discrimination ratio of 2:1 or greater, such that, as long as one group has at least twice the fish as another group, it will join the larger one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gómez-Laplaza | first1 = L.M. | last2 = Gerlai | first2 = R. | year = 2010 | title = Can angelfish (Pterophyllum scalare) count?

===Intelligence===

{{main|g factor in non-humans}}

As the [[Cognitive ability]] and [[intelligence]] in non-human animals cannot be measured with verbal scales, it has been measured using a variety of methods that involve such things as [[habit]] reversal, [[social learning theory|social learning]], and responses to [[novelty]]. [[Principal Component Analysis]] and [[factor analysis|factor analytic]] studies have shown that a single factor of intelligence is responsible for 47% of the individual variance in cognitive ability measures in [[primates]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Reader | first1 = S.

W. (2005). Clinical assessment of child and adolescent intelligence. Springer Science &amp; Business Media.&lt;/ref&gt;

The general factor of intelligence, or [[g factor (psychometrics)|''g'' factor]], is a [[psychometric]] construct that summarizes the correlations observed between an individual’s scores on various measures of [[cognitive abilities]].

===Theory of mind===
{{Main|Theory of mind in animals}}
[[Theory of mind]] is the ability to attribute mental states, e.g. [[intention|intents]], [[desire (emotion)|desires]], [[role-playing|pretending]], [[knowledge]], to oneself and others and to understand that others have desires, intentions, and perspectives that are different from one's own.&lt;ref name="Premack1978"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Premack |first1=David |last2=Woodruff |first2=Guy |year=1978 |title=Does the chimpanzee have a theory of mind? |journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences |volume=1 |issue=4 |pages=515–526 |doi=10.1017/S0140525X00076512}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some research with [[raven]]s provides an example of evidence for theory of mind in a non-human species. Ravens are members of the [[corvidae]] family, which is widely regarded as having high cognitive abilities. These birds have been observed to hide their food when dominant ravens are visible and audible at the same time. Based on this observation, ravens were tested for their understanding of "seeing" as a mental state.  In a first step, the birds protected their [[Hoarding (animal behavior)|cache]] when dominants were visible but not when they could only be heard from an adjacent room. In the next step, they had access to a small peephole which allowed them to see into the adjacent room.  With the peephole open, the ravens guarded their caches against discovery when they could hear dominants in the adjacent room, even when the dominant's sounds were playbacks of recordings.&lt;ref name="Bugnyar"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bugnyar |first1=Thomas |last2=Reber |first2=Stephan A. |last3=Buckner |first3=Cameron |year=2016 |title=Ravens attribute visual access to unseen competitors |journal=Nature Communications |volume=7 |doi=10.1038/ncomms10506 |url=http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2016/160202/ncomms10506/full/ncomms10506.html |pmid=26835849 |pmc=4740864 |pages=10506|bibcode=2016NatCo...710506B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Consciousness ===
{{main|Animal consciousness}}
[[File:Mirror test with a Baboon.JPG|thumb|Mirror test with a baboon]]

The sense in which animals can be said to have [[consciousness]] or a [[self-concept]] has been hotly debated. The best known research technique in this area is the [[mirror test]] devised by [[Gordon G. Gallup]], in which an animal's skin is marked in some way while it is asleep or sedated, and it is then allowed to see its reflection in a mirror; if the animal spontaneously directs grooming behavior towards the mark, that is taken as an indication that it is aware of itself.&lt;ref&gt;Bischof-Köhler, D.

It has been suggested that [[metacognition]] in some animals provides some evidence for cognitive self-awareness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1037/a0020129 |last = Couchman |first = Justin J. |author2=Coutinho, M.

Unlike the mirror test, which reveals awareness of the condition of one's own body, this uncertainty monitoring is thought to reveal awareness of one's internal mental state. A 2007 study has provided some evidence for metacognition in [[rat]]s,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/03/070308121856.htm Rats Capable Of Reflecting On Mental Processes]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Foote |first=Allison L. |author2=Crystal, J.

Some researchers propose that animal calls and other vocal behaviors provide evidence of consciousness. This idea arose from research on children's [[crib talk]] by Weir (1962) and in investigations of early speech in children by Greenfield and others (1976). Some such research has been done with a macaw (see [[Talking Birds#Arielle|Arielle]]).

In July, 2012 during the "Consciousness in Human and Nonhuman Animals" conference in Cambridge a group of scientists announced and signed a declaration with the following conclusions:
{{quotation|Convergent evidence indicates that non-human animals have the neuroanatomical, neurochemical, and neurophysiological substrates of conscious states along with the capacity to exhibit intentional behaviors. Consequently, the weight of evidence indicates that humans are not unique in possessing the neurological substrates that generate consciousness. Non-human animals, including all mammals and birds, and many other creatures, including octopuses, also possess these neurological substrates.&lt;ref name=cdeclaration&gt;{{cite web|title=The Cambridge Declaration on Consciousness|url=http://fcmconference.org/img/CambridgeDeclarationOnConsciousness.pdf|accessdate=12 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Biological constraints ==

[[File:AB003 Hedgehog from Rajasthan.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Hedgehogs instinctively roll into a ball when threatened, making them unsuitable for studies on aversion avoidance]]

Animals differ widely in many learning and cognitive tasks in ways that reflect their evolutionary history and their instinctual behaviors in natural environments. For example, dogs and rats easily learn to avoid an electric shock from the floor by moving to another part of the experimental chamber when they hear a tone preceding the shock; this is an appropriate response to a dangerous situation.  However, [[hedgehog]]s fail to learn this avoidance behavior. This might seem to show the hedgehog's inability to learn, but the hedgehog's instinctive reaction to a threat is to curl up into a ball, a response that interferes with possible escape behavior in this situation.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

[[Instinctive drift]] is another factor that can influence the interpretation of cognitive research.  Instinctive drift is the tendency of an animal to revert to [[instinctive behavior]]s that can interfere with learned responses. The concept originated with [[Keller Breland|Keller]] and [[Marian Breland|Marian]] Breland when they taught a [[raccoon]] to put coins into a box. The raccoon drifted to its instinctive behavior of rubbing the coins with its paws, as it would do when foraging for food.&lt;ref name="Breland and Breland, (1961)"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Breland | first1 = K. | last2 = Breland | first2 = M. | year = 1961 | title = The misbehavior of organisms | url = | journal = American Psychologist | volume = 16 | issue = 11| pages = 681–684 | doi=10.1037/h0040090}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Animal ability to process and respond to stimuli is correlated with brain size. Small-brain animals tend to show simple behaviors that are less dependent on learning than those of large-brained animals. Vertebrates, particularly mammals, have large brains and complex behavior that changes with experience. A formula called the [[encephalization quotient]] (EC) expresses a relationship between brain and body size; it was developed by H.J. Jerison in the late 1960s.&lt;ref name=Dinosaur_Paleoneurology&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Brett-Surman |editor1-first=Michael K. |editor2-first=Thomas R. |editor2-last=Holtz |editor3-first=James O. |editor3-last=Farlow |others=Illustrated by Bob Walters |title=The complete dinosaur |publisher=Indiana University Press |location=Bloomington, Ind. |isbn=978-0-253-00849-7 |pages=191–208 |edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the encephalization quotient is plotted as a curve, an animal with an EC above the curve is expected to show more cognitive ability than the average animal of its size, whereas an animal with an EC below the curve is expected to have less. Various formulas been suggested, but the equation  '''''Ew(brain) = 0.12w(body)&lt;sup&gt;2/3&lt;/sup&gt;'''''  has been found to fit data from a sample of mammals.&lt;ref name=Moore&gt;Moore, J. (1999): [http://weber.ucsd.edu/~jmoore/courses/allometry/allometry.html Allometry], [[University of California]], San Diego&lt;/ref&gt; The formula is suggestive at best, and should only be applied to non-mammals with extreme caution. For some of the other [[vertebrate]] classes, the power of 3/4 rather than 2/3 is sometimes used, and for many groups of [[invertebrates]], the formula may not give meaningful results.

== Cognitive faculty by species ==
A traditionally common image is the ''[[Great chain of being|scala naturae]]'', the ladder of nature on which animals of different species occupy successively higher rungs, with humans typically at the top.&lt;ref name=campbell1991snr&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Campbell | first1 = C.B.G. | last2 = Hodos | first2 = W. | year = 1991 | title = The Scala Naturae revisited: Evolutionary scales and anagenesis in comparative psychology | url = | journal = J.

Whether fairly or not, the performance of animals is often compared to that of humans on cognitive tasks. Not surprisingly, our closest biological relatives, the [[great ape]]s, tend to perform most like humans. Among the birds, [[corvid]]s and parrots have typically been found to perform well on human-like tasks. Some [[octopod]]es have also been shown to exhibit a number of higher-level skills such as tool use,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi = 10.1016/j.cub.2009.10.052 |title = Defensive tool use in a coconut-carrying octopus |year = 2009 |last1 = Finn |first1 = Julian K. |last2 = Tregenza |first2 = Tom |last3 = Norman |first3 = Mark D. |journal = Current Biology |volume = 19 |issue = 23 |pages = R1069–70 |pmid = 20064403 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but the amount of research on [[cephalopod intelligence]] is still limited.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mather|first=Jennifer A.|last2=Kuba|first2=Michael J.|date=May 2013|title=The cephalopod specialties: complex nervous systems, learning and cognition|url=|journal=NRC Research Press|volume=91|issue=6|pages=431–449|via=Canadian Journal of Zoology|doi=10.1139/cjz-2013-0009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Baboon]]s have been shown to be capable of recognizing words.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/news/baboons-can-learn-to-recognize-words-1.10432 Baboons can learn to recognize words; Monkeys' ability suggests that reading taps into general systems of pattern recognition] 12 April 2012 [[Nature (journal)|Nature]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/news/science/la-sci-word-recognition-20120413,0,5510844.story Baboons can recognize written words, study finds; The monkeys don't assign meaning to them, but learn what letter combinations are common to real words, the study authors say] April 12, 2012 [[Los Angeles Times]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencenews.org/view/generic/id/339869/title/Baboons_show_their_word_skills Baboons show their word skills; Reading may stem from a visual aptitude shared by all primates] May 5, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Board of Immigration Appeals''' ('''BIA''') is an administrative [[appellate court|appellate body]] within the [[Executive Office for Immigration Review]] of the [[United States Department of Justice]].

The BIA reviews the decisions of the [[U.S. immigration court]]s, some decisions of [[U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services]], and immigration violation arrests by [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection]] and [[U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement]]. BIA decisions are the final administrative action in a given case, and the next stage of appeal after a BIA decision is usually in the [[United States courts of appeals]] if an appeal is allowed by statute.

Most opinions of the BIA are unpublished and do not apply outside of the cases in which they were issued.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/migrated/Board_of_Immigration_Appeals_2.authcheckdam.pdf|title=AMERICAN BAR ASSOCIATION COMMISSION ON IMMIGRATION REPORT TO THE HOUSE OF DELEGATES|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a limited number of BIA decisions are selected for publication in the Administrative Decisions under the Immigration and Nationality Laws of the United States&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.uscis.gov/laws/precedent-decisions|title=Precedent Decisions|work=USCIS|access-date=2018-01-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;. There are currently 28 volumes of administrative precedent decisions under the Immigration and Nationality laws encompassing decisions dating back to 1940.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://myattorneyusa.com/comprehensive-list-of-articles-on-attorney-general-and-bia-precedent-decisions|title=Comprehensive List of Articles on Attorney General and BIA Precedent Decisions {{!}} myattorneyusa|website=myattorneyusa.com|language=en|access-date=2018-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; BIA precedent decisions are legally binding on all components of the Department of Homeland Security ([[United States Department of Homeland Security|DHS]]). A precedent decision may be overruled by a published decision of the Attorney General, by a Federal court, by a subsequent BIA precedent decision, or by a change in the law. 

The BIA is located in [[Bailey's Crossroads, Virginia]], and, as of April 2009, had 14 board members, who are administrative judges appointed by the [[U.S. Attorney General]]. The size of the full BIA varies from time to time, depending on resignations, retirements, and new appointments; it may have up to fifteen board members under the current authorizing legislation. Decisions issued by the BIA are by made up of three-member panels in limited circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{USCFR|8|1003|1|(e)(6)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Otherwise, the vast majority of cases are decided by single panel members.&lt;ref&gt;{{USCFR|8|1003|1|(e)(5)}}&lt;/ref&gt; A single panel member can also use a process called summary affirmance, which is used in 10 percent of cases (as of 2008), to affirm the lower court without issuing a written decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{USCFR|8|1003|1|(e)(4)}}; [http://www.justice.gov/eoir/press/06/BIAStreamliningFactSheet030906.htm Fact Sheet: BIA Restructuring and Streamlining Procedures] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130108082602/http://www.justice.gov/eoir/press/06/BIAStreamliningFactSheet030906.htm |date=January 8, 2013 }}; [http://www.justice.gov/eoir/press/08/EOIRs22ImprovementsProgressOverview090508v2.pdf Fact Sheet: EOIR’s Improvement Measures –– Progress Overview]&lt;/ref&gt;

The BIA is notable in that one need not be an attorney to appear before it representing a client. However, non-attorneys must be part of a BIA-recognized organization (generally a nonprofit), and also have obtained BIA accreditation as individuals.

'''Capital impairment''' is the case when the company lost its [[asset]], so the asset is lower than the [[stock]] of a company. One way to avoid capital impairment is [[reduction of capital]] without any compensation.

The '''Centre de Coordination de la Lutte Anti-drogue en Méditerranée''' or Mediterranean area anti-drug enforcement coordination centre (CeCLAD-M) is an international [[Illegal drug trade|anti drug trafficking]] agency based in [[Toulon]] (France) set up in 2008 to coordinate anti-drug trafficking operations and intelligence in the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]]. It is closely modeled on the MAOC-N based in [[Lisbon]].

==Members==
Set up on 1 December 2008, and headquartered in the [[French Navy]] base at Toulon it hosts liaison officers from six Mediterranean countries:
*[[Spain]] 
*[[Greece]] 
*[[Italy]] 
*[[Morocco]] 
*[[Portugal]]
*[[France]] 
In addition four other countries have made public their intention to participate as observers:
*[[United Kingdom|UK]]
*[[Cyprus]]
*[[Malta]]
*[[Senegal]]

==Mission==
The Centre aims to combat maritime and air drug trafficking activities through better intelligence coordination. The main tasks of the centre are:
*Contribute to better information exchange between the signatories
*Act as central repository and to analyse the information provided by the signatories
*Relay all useful information to the relevant forces in the signatory countries to enable effective identification, and interception of ships and planes transiting the Mediterranean
*Support the forces concerned in decision making

==Results==
Since its inception the centre has coordinated the surveillance of 23 ships and seizures of 3 tonnes of [[Cannabis (drug)|Cannibis]] from ships involved in trafficking.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2685">A '''custom of the sea''' is a [[custom (law)|custom]] that is said to be practiced by the officers and crew of ships and boats in the open sea, as distinguished from [[maritime law]], which is a distinct and coherent body of law that governs maritime questions and offenses.

Among these customs is the practice of [[human cannibalism|cannibalism]] among [[shipwreck]]ed survivors, by the drawing of lots to see who is to be killed and eaten so that the others might survive.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, Andrew: ''Is Eating People Wrong?: Great Legal Cases and How they Shaped the World''. Cambridge University Press, New York, 2011 {{ISBN|978-1-107-00037-7}} pg. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical examples of "agreed" cannibalism==
===''Essex''===
After a whale rammed and sank the [[whaling ship]] [[Essex (1799 whaleship)|''Essex'']] of [[Nantucket]] on 20 November 1820, the survivors were left floating in three small [[whaleboat]]s. They eventually resorted, by common consent, to [[cannibalism]] to allow some to survive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://h2g2.com/edited_entry/A671492 h2g2 - The Wreck of the Whaleship Essex - A671492&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Mignonette''===
{{main|R. v. Dudley and Stephens}}
The case of ''[[R. v. Dudley and Stephens]]'' (1884 14 QBD 273 DC) is an English case which developed a crucial ruling on [[necessity (criminal law)|necessity]] in modern [[common law]]. The case dealt with four crewmembers of an English yacht, the ''Mignonette'', who were shipwrecked in a storm some 1,600 miles from the [[Cape of Good Hope]]. After a few weeks adrift in a lifeboat, one of the crew fell unconscious due to a combination of hunger and [[seawater#Human consumption|drinking seawater]]. The others (one abstaining) decided then to kill him and eat him. They were picked up four days later. The case held that necessity was not a defense for a charge of murder, and the two defendants were convicted, though their death sentence was commuted to six months' imprisonment.

{{wiktionary|dago}}

'''DAGO''' is an acronym which stands for '''D'''epartment of the '''A'''rmy '''G'''eneral '''O'''fficer.  It is not typically used outside of the [[Department of the Army]] headquarters and staff sections, however it is sometimes seen in memorandums and other forms of correspondence to lower level [[wiktionary:en:echelon|echelons]].  It is also sometimes used to refer to [[General]] Officers that are part of the Department of the Army by personnel that are within other sections of the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]].

There are also certain orders issued by the Department of the Army that are called DAGOs or '''D'''epartment of the '''A'''rmy '''G'''eneral '''O'''rders that pertain to base closures, unit citations, the creation of JROTC units, certain awards such as the Medal of Honor and Legion of Merit and structural changes to the Army.  These are listed by year on the Army Publishing Directorate's website.

'''Dikgope Andrew "Magic Bones" Madi''' was an [[Umkhonto we Sizwe]], or MK, combatant involved in the liberation struggle under [[apartheid]].
He is believed to have been involved in military operations and extortions, including the 1981 bombing of the [[Sibasa]] police station which killed two police officers and crippled a third one. Mr Madi was later kidnapped and tortured by security policemen force and secretly buried at [[Thohoyandou]]. 
&lt;ref name="City Press 'TRC to exhume eleven more `secret' graves of MK cadres'"&gt;[http://152.111.1.87/argief/berigte/citypress/1997/12/07/18/3.html City Press 07 December 1997], "TRC to exhume eleven more `secret' graves of MK cadres", Hangwani Mulaudzi , 07 December 1997&lt;/ref&gt;
Following its exhumation in December 1997 along with 11 other combatants and under the direction of the then  Premier [[Ngoako Ramatlhodi]], he was reburied military-style at Marapyane in [[Mpumalanga]] on 11 January 1998.&lt;ref name="justice"&gt;[http://www.justice.gov.za/trc/media/1998/9801/s980112b.htm South African Press Association 12 January 1998], "NP OBJECTS TO PHOSA'S SECRET GRAVES ACCUSATIONS", 12 January 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

The investigation undertaken around his death and exhumation illustrates the challenges faced by the exhumation process of the [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission]].

== The TRC investigation ==

The investigation revealed that Mr Madi was suspected to have died in August 1983 at Tshipise, [[Venda]], in an incident that cost the life of two other combatants, Patrick Motswaletswale and Humbulani Mulaudzi.  
The family of Motswaletswale was the first to contact the Ministry of Safety and Security in order for this incident to be investigated. The case was later transferred to the TRC’s Johannesburg office, which established the identity of the combatants, Motswaletswale and Mulaudzi but the third combatants was referred to as Mandi. The only information about the latter was that he was originally from Alexandra.&lt;ref name="TRC Final Report pp.558"&gt;''Truth and Reconciliation Commission Final Report''. Volume 6, section 4, chapter 2, p.558. Retrieved 11 May 2013. [http://www.info.gov.za/otherdocs/2003/trc/4_2.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;
Once the burial site located in Mbaleni in Sibasa, the Commission undertook to establish the connection between Madi and Mandi and therefore to carry out an exhumation. This process led to an MK officer based in [[Zimbabwe]] of the time of the death of the combatants identifying Mandi as being Madi.

However, the necessary information confirming the identity of the deceased was scarce. Andrew Mandi was not listed as an [[ANC]] operative dead in exile but Andrew Madi was one of them, registered as killed in [[Rhodesia]] in 1979.
Complicating the matter, the two other combatants were listed as having been killed in August 1983 in Venda.&lt;ref name="anc"&gt;[http://anc.org.za/show.php?id=100 African National Congress], List of ANC Members who Died in Exile, March 1960 - December 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

Related to the case was a Human Rights Violation Testimony submitted by Matsutse Elias Madi living in Alexandra, Johannesburg. This testimony revealed that Matsutse Elias Madi's son, Dikgope Molefe ‘Magic Bones’ Madi, disappeared on 28 August 1978 after mentioning a possible project of exile. No investigation was opened by the police. Three or four years later, Madi received an anonymous letter saying that his son was in [[Tanzania]]. After the unbanning of the [[ANC]] in 1990, Madi was informed of the existence Ms Lovinest Nyerende from [[Malawi]], supposedly Dikgope’s girlfriend. She revealed that she had last seen her boyfriend in Tanzania in 1978 and that he had gone to Zimbabwe in order to fetch other exiles and never returned. In July 1992, Madi was informed by ANC officials that Dikgope died in Zimbabwe during the war. This version suggests that Andrew Madi and Andrew Mandi were two different people. Nevertheless, they shared almost identical names and both came from Alexandra.&lt;ref name="TRC Final Report pp.559"&gt;''Truth and Reconciliation Commission Final Report''. Volume 6, section 4, chapter 2, p.559. Retrieved 11 May 2013. [http://www.info.gov.za/otherdocs/2003/trc/4_2.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

Two other Human Rights Violation testimonies and additional information in other records later confirmed that three people were killed in Venda in 1983. But no source could cast light on the identity of the third victim, the two other being Patrick Motswaletswale and Humbulani Mulaudzi. It was finally an MK operative based in Zimbabwe during the Venda incident who was able to identify Dikgope Andrew ‘Magic Bones’ Madi as the third victim since while detained he had already been taken to identify the bodies in Venda and knew 'Magic Bones' personally.&lt;ref name="TRC Final Report pp.560"&gt;''Truth and Reconciliation Commission Final Report''. Volume 6, section 4, chapter 2, p.560. Retrieved 11 May 2013. [http://www.info.gov.za/otherdocs/2003/trc/4_2.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contributions ==

The process of exhumation was a challenging part of the [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission]] mandate. However flawed, it allowed families to get closer to the truth of what happened to their loved ones and get some closure. 
The collaboration of the different branches of the [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission]] allowed for the family of Dikgope Andrew 'Magic Bones' Madi to get some closure with his exhumation and reburial. However, no one claimed responsibility for his murder.&lt;ref name="City Press 'TRC to exhume eleven more `secret' graves of MK cadres'"/&gt;
The exhumation process goes beyond this singular case and involved hundreds of cases, some of which are still pending.

In [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church), a '''disciplinary council''' is an ecclesiastical trial during which a member of the church is tried for alleged violations of church standards. If a member of the LDS Church is found guilty of an offence by a disciplinary council, he or she may be [[Excommunication#The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|excommunicated]] or their church membership may be otherwise restricted. Disciplinary councils are also referred to unofficially as '''church courts'''.

==Purposes==
According to the LDS Church, the purposes of its disciplinary councils are to:&lt;ref&gt;LDS Church (2010). ''[[Handbook 1: Stake Presidents and Bishops]]'' (Salt Lake City, Utah: LDS Church) §6.1.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
#save the souls of the transgressors;
#protect the innocent; and
#safeguard the purity, integrity, and good name of the Church.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Structure and procedures==
===Ward disciplinary council===
Most disciplinary councils are convened by a [[Bishop (Latter Day Saints)|bishop]] of a [[Ward (LDS Church)|ward]]. In such an instance, the council is composed of the bishop and his two counselors. The ward clerk will also be present to take notes of the proceedings. After hearing all of the evidence in the case, the bishop and his counselors are encouraged to make a joint unanimous decision on the outcome. However, the bishop has the final say and can theoretically make a decision over the protest of either or both of his counselors.&lt;ref name = sixtenfour&gt;LDS Church (2010). ''[[Handbook 1: Stake Presidents and Bishops]]'' (Salt Lake City, Utah: LDS Church) §6.10.4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = sixtenone/&gt;

===Stake disciplinary council===
A stake disciplinary council is convened by the [[stake president]] in instances where it appears that a holder of the [[Melchizedek priesthood]] has committed an offence which may result in excommunication or when the subject is a member of a bishop's immediate family. In such instances, the council is composed of the [[stake president]], his two counselors, and the twelve members of the stake [[High council (Latter Day Saints)|high council]]. After hearing the evidence in the case and the submissions of the high councilors—one half of whom speak on behalf of the accused—the stake president and his counselors are encouraged to make a joint unanimous decision on the outcome. However, the stake president has the final say and can theoretically make a decision over the protest of either or both of his counselors.&lt;ref name = sixtenfour/&gt;&lt;ref name = sixtenone/&gt;

===Mission disciplinary council===
A [[mission president]] can convene a disciplinary council to try a full-time [[Mormon missionary|missionary]] in his [[Mission (LDS Church)|mission]] or a member in a [[District (LDS Church)|district]] of his mission. He can also authorize [[branch president|branch]] or [[district president]]s in a district to convene disciplinary councils.&lt;ref name = sixtenone&gt;LDS Church (2010). ''[[Handbook 1: Stake Presidents and Bishops]]'' (Salt Lake City, Utah: LDS Church) §6.10.1.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Common Council of the Church===
{{See also|Common Council of the Church#Trial of Joseph Smith|Common Council of the Church#Trial of Sidney Rigdon|l1=Trial of Joseph Smith|l2=Trial of Sidney Rigdon}}

If the need arises to convene a disciplinary council for the [[President of the Church]] or one of his counselors in the [[First Presidency]], the [[Common Council of the Church]] must be convened by the church's [[Presiding Bishop (LDS Church)|presiding bishop]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Doctrine and Covenants]] [http://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/107.73-76?lang=eng#73 107:73–76].&lt;/ref&gt; The Common Council is made up of the presiding bishop and his counselors and twelve other [[High priest (Latter Day Saints)|high priests]] selected by the presiding bishop.&lt;ref&gt;These twelve could be the members of the [[Quorum of the Twelve|Quorum of the Twelve Apostles]], but there is no requirement that the apostles be selected.&lt;/ref&gt; The Common Council has only been convened twice: In August 1838, after the return of [[Zion's Camp]], the Council formally convened for the first time to consider charges made by [[Sylvester Smith (Latter Day Saints)|Sylvester Smith]] against [[Joseph Smith]], who was eventually cleared.  In September 1844, Presiding Bishop [[Newel K. Whitney]] convened a Common Council which excommunicated [[Sidney Rigdon]], who was the senior surviving member of the First Presidency after the [[death of Joseph Smith]].

===Evidence===
The council begins by the presiding officer stating the reported misconduct and asking the accused person to admit or deny it. If the person denies the misconduct, the presiding officer or a designate presents the evidence of the misconduct. Evidence may be presented in the form of written or oral statements by witnesses or other documents. An accused person's previous confession cannot be used as evidence in a disciplinary council without the member's consent.&lt;ref name = sixtenfour/&gt; The accused member is given a chance to question the witnesses against him or her. After the evidence against the accused is presented, the accused is permitted to present evidence in response. The accused can comment on the evidence and make any other statement he or she wants to make. All witnesses and the accused may also be questioned by any member of the disciplinary council. No witness is placed under oath. Because the disciplinary council is an ecclesiastical court, rules of evidence that govern domestic courts do not apply.&lt;ref name = sixtenfour/&gt; The church has instructed leaders that "procedures in a disciplinary council must be fair and considerate of the feelings of all who participate."&lt;ref name = oneten&gt;LDS Church (2010). ''[[Handbook 1: Stake Presidents and Bishops]]'' (Salt Lake City, Utah: LDS Church) §6.10.&lt;/ref&gt;

If the accused person admits to the conduct in question, no evidence is presented before the council.

===Decision===
Once a decision has been reached by the disciplinary council, the decision is announced to the accused person and the presiding officer explains the conditions that are imposed by the decision. The accused is also informed of his or her right to appeal the decision of the council. The decision of the disciplinary council is not announced in a public church meeting unless the case involves (1) the preaching of false doctrine, (2) a transgressor who is a [[sexual predator|predator]], or (3) "other flagrant transgressions", such as participation in [[plural marriage]], "cultist teachings to attract a following", or ridicule of church leaders.&lt;ref&gt;LDS Church (2010). ''[[Handbook 1: Stake Presidents and Bishops]]'' (Salt Lake City, Utah: LDS Church) §6.10.9.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Appeal===
An accused member may appeal the decision of the disciplinary council within 30 days of the decision being made. Appeals of a ward disciplinary council are made to the stake disciplinary council (i.e. the stake president, his two counselors, and the high council). An appeal of the decision of a stake disciplinary council or a disciplinary council convened by a [[mission president]] is to the [[First Presidency (LDS Church)|First Presidency]] of the church. An appeal of a decision of a disciplinary council convened by a branch president or a district president in a mission is to the mission president. The body hearing the appeal may vary the decision of the council in any way or let the original decision stand.&lt;Ref&gt;LDS Church (2010). ''[[Handbook 1: Stake Presidents and Bishops]]'' (Salt Lake City, Utah: LDS Church) §6.10.10.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Records===
The proceedings of the disciplinary council are summarized on a Report of Church Disciplinary Action form.&lt;ref&gt;LDS Church (2010). ''[[Handbook 1: Stake Presidents and Bishops]]'' (Salt Lake City, Utah: LDS Church) §6.10.11.&lt;/ref&gt; This form is sent to the office of the First Presidency where the information it contains is permanently stored.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} It is also reviewed by the body hearing the appeal if an appeal is made.
 
The membership record of a member that is disfellowshipped or placed on formal probation is updated to note the status of the member. If the member changes congregations while under church discipline, the membership record will inform the new ward or branch leadership of the disciplinary action. After church discipline has ended the membership record will again be updated to remove notice of the disciplinary action. The membership records provided to ward and branch leaders normally do not contain information regarding past discipline; however, a membership record is annotated when a person has been disciplined for incest, sexual or serious physical abuse of a child, [[plural marriage]], an elective transsexual operation, repeated homosexual activities by adults, embezzlement of church funds or property, or other conduct that, in the church's view, "threatens the well being of other persons or of the Church."&lt;Ref name = sixthirteenthree&gt;LDS Church (2010). ''[[Handbook 1: Stake Presidents and Bishops]]'' (Salt Lake City, Utah: LDS Church) §6.13.3.&lt;/ref&gt; Annotations may be removed from a membership record if a [[stake president]] makes a request to do so and the [[First Presidency (LDS Church)|First Presidency]] approves the removal.&lt;ref&gt;LDS Church (2010). ''[[Handbook 1: Stake Presidents and Bishops]]'' (Salt Lake City, Utah: LDS Church) §6.13.4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stake presidents are permitted to request records of past discipline of members of their stake from the office of the First Presidency. Bishops may request records of past discipline of members of their ward.

In the case of excommunication, the excommunicated person is removed from church records.&lt;ref name = sixninethree&gt;LDS Church (2010). ''[[Handbook 1: Stake Presidents and Bishops]]'' (Salt Lake City, Utah: LDS Church) §6.9.3.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Qualifying offences==
===When a disciplinary council is mandatory===
The LDS Church has instructed leaders that a disciplinary council is mandatory when evidence suggests that a member of the church may have committed any of the following offences against the standards of the church:
#[[Murder]]: the "deliberate and unjustified taking of human life". The church does not classify killings performed by [[police]] or [[soldiers]] in the line of duty as being murder. It also does not classify [[abortion]] as murder.&lt;ref name = sixseventhree&gt;LDS Church (2010). ''[[Handbook 1: Stake Presidents and Bishops]]'' (Salt Lake City, Utah: LDS Church) §6.7.3.&lt;/ref&gt;
#[[Incest]]: defined as "sexual relations" between a parent (or grandparent) and a natural, adopted, or foster child or a stepchild. It also includes sexual relations between siblings.&lt;ref name = sixseventhree/&gt;
#[[Apostasy]]: refers to members who "repeatedly act in clear, open, and deliberate public opposition to the Church or its leaders" and also includes those who repeatedly present information as church doctrine that is not church doctrine and those who repeatedly follow the teachings of apostate sects or those who formally join another church. Merely failing to attend church meetings does not qualify as apostasy.&lt;ref name = sixseventhree/&gt; In November 2015, the church clarified that its members who are in a [[same-sex marriage]] are in apostasy.&lt;ref&gt;Cimaron Neugebauer, [http://kutv.com/news/local/lds-church-issues-update-on-what-is-considered-apostasy "LDS Church adds same-sex marriage to definition of apostasy"], kutv.com, 6 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;
#Serious transgression while holding a prominent church position : "serious transgression" is defined as "a deliberate and major offense against morality" and includes "attempted murder, rape, sexual abuse, spouse abuse, intentional serious physical injury of others, adultery, fornication, homosexual relations (especially sexual cohabitation),&lt;ref&gt;The phrase in parentheses was added in November 2015: Daniel Woodruff, [http://kutv.com/news/local/lds-church-to-exclude-children-of-same-sex-couples-from-membership "LDS church to exclude children of same-sex couples from membership"], kutv.com, 6 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; deliberate abandonment of family responsibilities, robbery, burglary, theft, embezzlement, sale of illicit drugs, fraud, perjury, and false swearing."&lt;ref name = sixseventhree/&gt; "Prominent church position" includes the positions of [[area seventy]], [[temple president]], [[mission president]], [[stake president]], [[Patriarch (Latter Day Saints)|patriarch]], and [[Bishop (Latter Day Saints)|bishop]].&lt;ref name = sixseventhree/&gt;
#Transgressor who is a [[sexual predator|predator]]&lt;ref name = sixseventhree/&gt;
#Pattern of serious transgressions&lt;ref name = sixseventhree/&gt; (as defined above)
#Serious transgression (as defined above) that is widely known&lt;ref name = sixseventhree/&gt;

===When a disciplinary council may be appropriate===
The LDS Church has instructed leaders that a disciplinary council ''may'' be appropriate when evidence suggests that a member of the church may have committed any of the following offences against the standards of the church. Whether or not a disciplinary council will be held will depend on the facts of the situation and is generally left to the discretion of the [[Bishop (Latter Day Saints)|bishop]] or [[stake president]].
#Serious transgression&lt;ref name = sixseventwo&gt;LDS Church (2010). ''[[Handbook 1: Stake Presidents and Bishops]]'' (Salt Lake City, Utah: LDS Church) §6.7.2.&lt;/ref&gt; (as defined in the section above)
#[[Abortion]]: a disciplinary council may be held for any member who submits to, performs, encourages, pays for, or otherwise arranges an abortion. However, councils are not held for persons involved in an abortion if the pregnancy resulted from rape or forcible incest, if the life of the mother is in jeopardy, or if it is shown that the fetus has severe defects which will not allow it to survive the birth.&lt;ref name = sixseventwo/&gt;
#[[Sex reassignment surgery|Transsexual operation]]&lt;ref name = sixseventwo/&gt;

===When a disciplinary council is not appropriate===
The LDS Church has instructed leaders that disciplinary councils are not appropriately held to resolve or deal with the following circumstances:
#Failure to comply with some church standards, such as the [[Word of Wisdom]], payment of [[tithe|tithing]], attendance at church meetings, or fulfilling church [[Calling (LDS Church)|callings]] or assignments&lt;ref name = sixsevenone&gt;LDS Church (2010). ''[[Handbook 1: Stake Presidents and Bishops]]'' (Salt Lake City, Utah: LDS Church) §6.7.1.&lt;/ref&gt;
#Business failure or nonpayment of debts&lt;ref name = sixsevenone/&gt;
#Civil disputes between two or more members&lt;ref name = sixsevenone/&gt;
#In the case of a member voluntarily confessing a serious transgression (as defined above) that "was committed long ago and [the members'] faithfulness and service in the intervening years have demonstrated full reformation and repentance".&lt;ref name = sixsevenone/&gt;

==Possible outcomes==
A disciplinary council may reach one of four possible outcomes:&lt;ref&gt;LDS Church (2010). ''[[Handbook 1: Stake Presidents and Bishops]]'' (Salt Lake City, Utah: LDS Church) §6.10.5.&lt;/ref&gt;

#'''No action'''. This is the result when the disciplinary council determines that no offence has taken place. However, even if it is determined that an offence did occur, the council may impose no formal discipline and instead give "cautionary council" or recommend consultation with the member's bishop for caution or counsel.
#'''Formal probation'''. This action temporarily restricts or suspends a member's privileges of church membership in the way specified by the council. Possible actions could include "suspending the right to partake of the [[Sacrament (Latter Day Saints)|sacrament]], hold a church [[Calling (LDS Church)|calling]], exercise the [[Priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|priesthood]], or enter the [[Temple (LDS Church)|temple]]."&lt;ref&gt;LDS Church (2010). ''[[Handbook 1: Stake Presidents and Bishops]]'' (Salt Lake City, Utah: LDS Church) §6.9.1.&lt;/ref&gt;
#'''Disfellowshipment'''. A person who is disfellowshipped is "still a member of the Church but is no longer in good standing." A disfellowshipped member may not hold a [[temple recommend]], serve in a church [[Calling (LDS Church)|calling]], or exercise the [[Priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|priesthood]]. A disfellowshipped member may attend public meetings of the LDS Church, but may not give a sermon, teach a lesson, offer a public prayer, partake of the [[Sacrament (Latter Day Saints)|sacrament]], or vote in [[Common consent (Mormonism)|sustaining church officers]]. However, disfellowshipped members may pay [[tithe|tithing]] and [[fast offerings]] and continue to wear the [[temple garment]]. If the disfellowshipped member expresses repentance and abides by the conditions imposed upon him or her, disfellowshipment usually lasts approximately one year. Only a reconvened disciplinary council can remove the condition of disfellowshipment. Disfellowshipment is considered a relatively severe action which is adequate for most serious transgressions.&lt;ref&gt;LDS Church (2010). ''[[Handbook 1: Stake Presidents and Bishops]]'' (Salt Lake City, Utah: LDS Church) §6.9.2.&lt;/ref&gt;
#'''Excommunication'''. An individual who is excommunicated is no longer a member of the LDS Church. All of the restrictions of the disfellowshipped member also apply to excommunicated individuals. In addition, an excommunicated person is not permitted to pay [[tithe|tithing]] or [[fast offerings]] or wear the [[temple garment]]. Excommunication is the most serious sanction a disciplinary council can impose and is generally reserved for only the most severe offences. Excommunication is mandatory for murder and is almost always required for incest. Excommunication may also be appropriate for members who have been disfellowshipped and have not repented. Excommunication almost always lasts at least one year; only a reconvened disciplinary council may approve an excommunicated member for readmittance to the church through [[baptism]].&lt;ref name = sixninethree/&gt;

'''Dominium''', a legal term meaning "Dominion; control; ownership," forms several related compounds in [[legal Latin]]:
*[[Dominium directum et utile|Dominium directum]] – Direct ownership, that is control of the property, but not necessarily with right to its utilization or alienation.  For example, a holder in life tenure has ''dominium directum'' but not ''dominium utile'' because he may control the property but not exhaust its resources.  This is to be distinguished from [[allod]]ial right or [[fee simple]] (''dominium plenum'') and the right retained by the grantor of the [[life estate]] who holds the rights to the utilization of the land's resources (''dominium utile'').  
*[[Dominium directum et utile]] – The complete and absolute dominion in property; the union of the title and the exclusive use. See Fairfax's Devisee v Hunter's Lessee (US) 7 Cranch 603, 618, 3 L Ed 453, 458.  Equivalent in nature to ''dominium plenum'' or ''fee simple''.
*Dominium eminens – (Civil law.) The right of eminent domain. Gilmer v Lime Point, 18 Cal 229, 251.
*[[Dominium non potest esse in pendenti]] – Ownership cannot be held in suspense.
*[[Dominium plenum]] – Full or complete ownership of an estate.  Commonly rendered in English as ''fee simple''.  
*[[Dominium directum et utile|Dominium utile]] – Beneficial ownership of an estate.  A holder of the reversion of a [[life estate]] holds the ''dominium utile'' of the property (although not the control or ''dominium directum'') because he has the right to the long-term utilization any resources (mineral, vegetative, etc.) on the property but not to the immediate use of the property–the holder of the [[life estate]] has control of the property
*[[Duorum in solidum dominium vel possessio esse non potest]] – Sole ownership or possession cannot be in two persons.

In general, "utilization" of resources on the property is subject to a reasonableness test.  A life tenant with ''dominium directum'' of an estate may make reasonable use of resources, which means roughly renewable or trivial usage:  the culling of firewood in the midst of an expansive forest, or the extraction of coal sufficient for home use from a fecund mine.  Any commercialization (e.g. selling rights to the coal shaft) or large-scale exploitation (raising extensive erections on the estate using the timber resources) will implicate the ''dominium utile'' reserved to the holder in reversion and be subject to legal action at common law.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8923">The '''E-2 Investor Visa''' allows an individual to enter and work inside of the [[United States]] based on an [[investment]] he or she will be controlling, while inside the United States. The E2 [[visa (document)|visa]] is good for three months to five years (depending on the country of origin) and can be extended indefinitely.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://rupertlawgroup.com/#invest|title=E2 Visa Lawyer in Los Angeles - Investor Visa Attorney|website=Rupert Law Group|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The investment must be "substantial." Investor visas are available only to citizens of certain countries.{{efn|As of June 20, 2018, eligible treaty countries are [[Albania]], [[Argentina]], [[Armenia]], [[Australia]], [[Austria]], [[Azerbaijan]], [[Bahrain]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Belgium]], [[Bolivia]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Cameroon]], [[Canada]], [[Chile]], [[Colombia]], [[Costa Rica]], [[Croatia]], [[Czech Republic]], [[Democratic Republic of Congo]], [[Denmark]] (excluding [[Greenland]]), [[Ecuador]], [[Egypt]], [[Estonia]], [[Ethiopia]], [[Finland]], [[France]] (including [[Martinique]], [[Guadeloupe]], [[French Guiana]], and [[Réunion|Reunion]]), [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Germany]], [[Grenada]], [[Honduras]], [[Iran]], [[Ireland]], [[Italy]], [[Israel]], [[Jamaica]], [[Japan]], [[Jordan]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Kosovo]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], [[Latvia]], [[Liberia]], [[Lithuania]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]], [[Mexico]], [[Moldova]], [[Mongolia]], [[Montenegro]], [[Morocco]], [[Netherlands]] (including [[Aruba]] and [[Netherlands Antilles]]), [[Norway]] (excluding [[Svalbard]]), [[Oman]], [[Pakistan]], [[Panama]], [[Paraguay]], [[Philippines]], [[Poland]], [[Republic of Congo]], [[Romania]], [[Senegal]], [[Serbia]], [[Singapore]], [[Slovak Republic]], [[Slovenia]], [[South Korea]], [[Spain]] (including [[Islands of Spain|all territories]]), [[Sri Lanka]], [[Suriname]], [[Sweden]], [[Switzerland]], [[Taiwan]], [[Thailand]], [[Togo]], [[Trinidad and Tobago]], [[Tunisia]], [[Turkey]], [[Ukraine]], [[United Kingdom]] (including [[Channel Islands]] and [[Gibraltar]], excluding [[British Overseas Territories|British territories outside Europe]])}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://travel.state.gov/content/visas/en/fees/treaty.html |title=Treaty Countries |author=Bureau of Consular Affairs |publisher=United States Department of State |accessdate=2016-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  E-2 visas are also available to non-investor employees of the business, as long as the persons are of the same nationality as the investor and are destined for a role in the US business that is either executive/supervisory or requires specialized skills that are essential to the efficient operation of the US enterprise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Treaty Traders (E-1) and Treaty Investors (E-2)|url=http://www.usvisalawyers.co.uk/article9add2.htm|publisher=[[Gudeon &amp; McFadden]]|accessdate=20 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For new [[startup company|startups]], the investment must be large enough to start and operate the business. The amount of investment varies on the type of business. The investment will not be considered substantial if it is not large enough to capitalize the venture. The [[USCIS]] will use an "Inverted Sliding Scale" to determine whether the investment is substantial in proportion to the overall cost of the enterprise.

Upon conclusion of the business, investors must return to their countries of origin, or change their status. The [[United States Department of State]] does not allow [[dual intent]] for this type of visa, although it is possible for E-2 visa holders to adjust their status to immigrant status. The holder of an E-2 visa may leave the United States at any time.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

==Dependents ==
Because there is no dedicated [[List of United States dependent visas|dependent visa class]] for E-2 visas, spouses and unmarried children (under 21) may receive derivative E-2 visas in order to accompany the principal immigrant. The duration of visa for a family member who is of a different nationality from the principal is determined by any reciprocal agreements between their country of nationality and the US. Only if there is no such reciprocal agreement will the duration be the same as the principal applicant. Dependents may seek [[employment]] in the US by applying for [[Employment authorization document|employment authorization]] using Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization. Children under 21 cannot apply for work; only the spouse of the E-2 holder can.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Family Members|url=https://travel.state.gov/visa/temp/types/types_1273.html#14|work=Visas for Treaty Traders and Treaty Investors|publisher=[[Bureau of Consular Affairs]]|accessdate=27 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* A [[passport]] valid for travel to the United States and with a validity date at least six months beyond the applicant's intended period of stay in the United States. If more than one person is included in the passport, each person must complete a Form DS-160 application.
* One 2-by-2-inch (5-by-5-cm) photograph.
* As part of the visa application process, an interview at the [[embassy]]'s consular section is required for almost all visa applicants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Treaty Trader and Investment Visa|url=https://travel.state.gov/content/visas/english/employment/treaty.html|publisher=U.S. Department of State}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A credible business plan showing that the US business will generate enough money to support the applicant during his/her stay in the US along with all his dependents. The business cannot be marginal.
* A business registration for the United States business.
* Proof of wire transfer.
* Proof of source of income.
* Proof of intent to return to your country (because this visa does not allow [[dual intent]]).

== How to apply ==
Applicants should generally apply at the [[List of diplomatic missions of the United States|U.S. Embassy or Consulate]] accredited to their place of permanent residence. As part of the visa application process, an interview at the embassy consular section is required for visa applicants from age 14 through 79. Persons age 13 and younger, and age 80 and older, generally do not require an interview, unless requested by embassy or consulate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Applying for the Visa|url=https://travel.state.gov/visa/temp/types/types_1273.html#4|work=Visas for Treaty Traders and Treaty Investors|publisher=[[Bureau of Consular Affairs]]|accessdate=27 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the visa application process, usually at the interview, an ink-free, digital [[fingerprint scan]] will be taken before the interview. Some applicants will need additional screening, and will be notified when they apply. The E-2 visa application process vary from Consular Posts in one country to another country as there is often difference in policies and visa processing procedures.

The applicable law has been in effect since 1968,&lt;ref name="southern4838"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thesouthern.com/news/article_7e45fc85-e12f-5f30-bce1-34530fbc7f38.html |title=Lawmakers Send Message on FOID Backlog |last=Adrian |first=Matt |date=February 23, 2006 |accessdate=December 18, 2012 |work=The Southern |publisher=[[Lee Enterprises]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; but has been subject to several subsequent amendments.

The FOID card is issued by the [[Illinois State Police]], with the application being submitted either online or via a paper application process.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isp.state.il.us/media/pressdetails.cfm?ID=837 "Officials Aim to Modernize and Expedite Licensing Process for Efficiency"], March 6, 2015, Illinois State Police.

Grounds for disqualification include a conviction for a felony or for an act of domestic violence, a conviction for assault or battery within the last five years, or being the subject of an order of protection.  The police also check an Illinois Department of Human Services database, to disqualify any applicant who has been adjudicated as a mental defective, or who has been a patient of a mental institution within the last five years.&lt;ref name="PublicAct095-0581"&gt;[http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/publicacts/fulltext.asp?Name=095-0581 Illinois General Assembly — Public Act 095-0581]&lt;/ref&gt;  Mental health professionals are required to inform state authorities about patients who display violent, suicidal or threatening behavior, for inclusion in the Human Services database.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;!-- dead link http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory?id=4307545 --&gt; Tarm, Michael.

A FOID card legally must be granted within 30 days from the date the application is received, unless the applicant does not qualify.  However, by January 2006, the backlog had increased and the State Police were taking as long as 50 days, in violation of the law, to issue or deny the FOID.&lt;ref name="southern4838" /&gt; By March 2013 the delay was often at least 60 days.&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press (March 27, 2013).

The FOID card will be revoked before its expiration if the individual becomes disqualified as described above.

Illinois law requires that, when a firearm is sold by a [[Federal Firearms License]] (FFL) holder, or at a [[gun show]], the seller perform a dial-up inquiry to the State Police to verify that the buyer's FOID card is valid.  This additional check is known as the Firearm Transfer Inquiry Program (FTIP).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ilga.gov/commission/jcar/admincode/020/02001235sections.html Illinois Administrative Code Part 1235 — Firearm Transfer Inquiry Program]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/publicacts/fulltext.asp?Name=094-0353 Illinois General Assembly — Public Act 094-0353], amending the Firearm Owners Identification Card Act to require FTIP checks at gun shows, effective July 29, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;  At the time of the inquiry, the police perform an automated search of several criminal and mental health databases, including the federal NICS database.&lt;ref name="foid-act" /&gt; (Generally, FFLs in all states must request a background check through the NICS before selling a firearm; however in some states non-FFL purchasers who possess certain state-issued firearms permits, e.g., a permit to carry a concealed handgun, may purchase firearms from FFLs without undergoing a point-of-sale NICS check.)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nraila.org/news-issues/fact-sheets/1999/guide-to-the-national-instant-check-sys.aspx "Guide to the National Instant Check System"], [[National Rifle Association]], July 16, 1999.

__NOTOC__
A '''fiber-reinforced composite''' (FRC) is a [[Composite material|composite building material]] that consists of three components: (i) the fibers as the discontinuous or dispersed phase, (ii) the matrix as the continuous phase, and (iii) the fine interphase region, also known as the interface.&lt;ref name=cantwell&gt;{{cite journal | author=WJ Cantwell, J Morton | title=The impact resistance of composite materials -- a review | journal=Composites | year=1991 | volume=22 | issue=5 | pages=347&amp;ndash;62 | url= | doi=10.1016/0010-4361(91)90549-V}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=serope&gt;Serope Kalpakjian, Steven R Schmid. "Manufacturing Engineering and Technology". International edition. 4th Ed. Prentice Hall, Inc. 2001. {{ISBN|0-13-017440-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This is a type of advanced composite group, which makes use of rice husk, rice hull, and plastic as ingredients. This technology involves a method of refining, blending, and compounding natural fibers from cellulosic waste streams to form a high-strength fiber composite material in a polymer matrix. The designated waste or base raw materials used in this instance are those of waste thermoplastics and various categories of cellulosic waste including rice husk and saw dust.
[[Image:Gal-main.jpg|thumb|Fiber-reinforced composite|300px|right]]

FRC is high-performance fiber composite achieved and made possible by cross-linking  cellulosic fiber molecules with resins in the FRC material matrix through a proprietary molecular re-engineering process, yielding a product of exceptional structural properties.

Through this feat of molecular re-engineering selected physical and structural properties of wood are successfully cloned and vested in the FRC product, in addition to other critical attributes to yield performance properties superior to contemporary wood.

This material, unlike other composites, can be recycled up to 20 times, allowing scrap FRC to be reused again and again.

The failure mechanisms in FRC materials include [[delamination]], intralaminar matrix cracking, longitudinal matrix splitting, fiber/matrix debonding, fiber pull-out, and fiber fracture.&lt;ref name=cantwell/&gt;

== Basic Principles ==
The appropriate "average" of the individual phase properties to be used in describing composite tensile behavior can be elucidated with reference to Fig. 6.2. Although

this figure illustrates a plate-like composite, the results that follow are equally applicable to fiber composites having similar phase arrangements. The two phase

material of Fig. 6.2 consists of lamellae of &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; phases of thickness &lt;math&gt;l_\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;l_\beta&lt;/math&gt;. and respectively. Thus, the volume fractions (&lt;math&gt;V_\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;V_\beta&lt;/math&gt;) of the phases are &lt;math&gt;V_\alpha=\frac{l_\alpha}{l_\alpha+l_\beta}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;V_\beta=\frac{l_\beta}{l_\alpha+l_\beta}&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Case I: Same stress, different strain'''

A tensile force F is applied normal to the broad faces (dimensions Lx L) of the phases. In this arrangement the stress borne by each of the phases (= F/&lt;math&gt;L^2&lt;/math&gt;) is the same, but the strains (&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_\alpha &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_\beta&lt;/math&gt;) they experience are different. composite strain is a volumetric weighted average of the strains of the individual phases. 

&lt;math&gt;\vartriangle l_\alpha=\varepsilon_\alpha l_\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\vartriangle l_\beta=\varepsilon_\beta l_\beta&lt;/math&gt;

The total elongation of the composite, &lt;math&gt;\vartriangle l_c&lt;/math&gt; is obtained as &lt;math&gt;\vartriangle l_c=N \vartriangle l_\alpha+ N \vartriangle l_\beta&lt;/math&gt;

and the composite strain &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_c&lt;/math&gt; is, &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_c&lt;/math&gt;=&lt;math&gt;\frac{\vartriangle l_c}{N(l_\alpha +l_\beta)}&lt;/math&gt;=&lt;math&gt;V_\alpha\varepsilon_\alpha+V_\beta\varepsilon_\beta&lt;/math&gt;= &lt;math&gt;\sigma\biggl(\frac{V_\alpha}{E_\alpha}+\frac{V_\beta}{E_\beta}\biggr)&lt;/math&gt;

Composite modulus &lt;math&gt;E_c=\frac{E_\alpha E_\beta}{V_\alpha E_\beta+V_\beta E_\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;

'''Case II: different stress, same strain'''

Fibers that are aligned parallel to the tensile axis, the strains in both phases are equal (and the same as the composite strain), but the external force is partitioned

unequally between the phases. &lt;math&gt;F=F_\alpha+F_\beta=NL(\sigma_\alpha l_\alpha+\sigma_\beta l_\beta)&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\sigma_c=\left ( \frac{\sigma_\alpha l_\alpha}{l_\alpha+l_\beta}+\frac{\sigma_\beta l_\beta}{l_\alpha+l_\beta} \right )=\sigma_\alpha V_\alpha+\sigma_\beta V_\beta&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;E_c=V_\alpha E_\alpha+V_\beta E_\beta&lt;/math&gt;

== Deformation behavior ==
When the fiber is aligned parallel to the direction of the matrix and applied the load as the same strain case. 
The fiber and matrix has the volume fraction &lt;math&gt;V_f&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;V_m&lt;/math&gt;; stress &lt;math&gt;\sigma_f&lt;/math&gt; , &lt;math&gt;\sigma_m&lt;/math&gt;; strain&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_f&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_m &lt;/math&gt;; and modulus &lt;math&gt;E_f&lt;/math&gt;,  &lt;math&gt;E_m&lt;/math&gt;. And here &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_f&lt;/math&gt;=&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_f&lt;/math&gt;=&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_c&lt;/math&gt;. The uniaxial stress-strain response of a fiber composite can be divided into several stages.

In stage 1, when the fiber and matrix both deform elastically, the stress and strain relation is
&lt;math&gt;\sigma_c=V_f E_f \varepsilon_f+V_m E_m \varepsilon_m=\varepsilon_c (V_f E_f+V_m E_m)&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;E_c=V_f E_f+V_m E_m&lt;/math&gt;

In stage 2, when the stress for the fiber is bigger than the yield stress, the matrix starts to deform plastically, and the fiber are still elastic, the stress and strain relation is

&lt;math&gt;\sigma_c=V_f E_f \varepsilon_f+V_m \sigma_m(\varepsilon_m)=V_f E_f \varepsilon_c+V_m \sigma_m(\varepsilon_c)&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;E_c=V_f E_f+V_m (\frac{d\sigma_m}{d\varepsilon_c})&lt;/math&gt;

In stage 3, when the matrix the fiber both deform plastically, the stress and strain relation is

&lt;math&gt;\sigma_c=V_f \sigma_f(\varepsilon_f)+V_m \sigma_m(\varepsilon_m)=V_f \sigma_f(\varepsilon_c)+V_m \sigma_m(\varepsilon_c)&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;E_c=V_f (\frac{d\sigma_f}{d\varepsilon_c})+V_m (\frac{d\sigma_m}{d\varepsilon_c})&lt;/math&gt;

Since some fibers do not deform permanently prior to fracture, stage 3 cannot be observed in some composite. 

In stage 4, when the fiber has already become fracture and matrix still deforms plastically, the stress and strain relation is

&lt;math&gt;\sigma_c=V_m \sigma_m(\varepsilon_m)&lt;/math&gt;

However, it is not completely true, since the failure fibers can still carry some load.

==Application==

There are also applications in the market, which utilize only waste materials. Its most widespread use is in outdoor deck floors, but it is also used for railings, fences, landscaping timbers, cladding and siding, park benches, molding and trim, window and door frames, and indoor furniture. See for example the work of ''Waste for Life'', which collaborates with garbage scavenging cooperatives to create fiber-reinforced building materials and domestic problems from the waste their members collect: [http://wasteforlife.org/ Homepage of Waste for Life]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13497">'''Formulary apportionment''', also known as '''unitary taxation''', is a method of allocating profit earned (or loss incurred) by a corporation or corporate group to a particular tax jurisdiction in which the corporation or group has a taxable presence. It is an alternative to separate entity accounting, under which a branch or subsidiary within the jurisdiction is accounted for as a separate entity, requiring prices for transactions with other parts of the corporation or group to be assigned according to the [[arm's length principle|arm's length]] standard commonly used in [[transfer pricing]].  In contrast, formulary apportionment attributes the corporation's total worldwide profit (or loss) to each jurisdiction, based on factors such as the proportion of sales, assets or payroll in that jurisdiction.&lt;ref name="CAYp12"&gt;{{harvnb|Clausing|Avi-Yonah|2007|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

When applied to a corporate group, formulary apportionment requires [[combined reporting]] of the group's results.  The parent and all of its subsidiaries are viewed as though they were a single entity (''unitary combination''), and the method is then also known as ''worldwide unitary taxation''.  In the US, most states have adopted water's edge combined reporting which restricts the taxable group to just US domestic corporations and excludes "overseas business organization", i.e., unitary foreign affiliates and foreign parents.

==In domestic taxation==
Formulary methods are used in both the United States and Canada to apportion income of corporations between the sub-national jurisdictions in which they operate.  In many U.S. states formulary apportionment is also used to apportion the combined income of a related group of companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weiner|2005|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tax in each US state is thus assessed based on the unitary combination of all related entities.&lt;ref name="MWp254"&gt;{{harvnb|McLure|Weiner|2000|pp=254&amp;ndash;255}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The related entities included in the unitary combination may be worldwide entities or only entities within the United States, depending on the state. The latter is known as water's edge combined reporting. 

Worldwide unitary combined reporting was first approved by the US Supreme Court in 1983 in Container Corp. v. Franchise Tax Board (CA) by a vote of 5-3 (Justice Stevens did not participate). The court re-visited worldwide combined reporting in 1994 in Barclays Bank v. Franchise Tax Board (CA) and Colgate-Palmolive v. Franchise Tax Board (CA) and again approved its use by California but this time by larger majorities.  The votes were 7-2 and 9-0, respectively.  However, as a result of foreign retaliatory legislation and pressure from the federal government, all states have now abandoned mandatory worldwide combined reporting.

The use of formulary apportionment in the United States dates back to the late 19th century. At that time, there was no state or federal corporate income tax, but the states did assess [[property tax|property]] and capital stock taxes. With the growth of the [[transcontinental railroad]]s, state taxation authorities faced companies which had not just [[immovable property]] (tracks) but also non-trivial movable property ([[rolling stock]]) operating across state lines. The property value of a company assessable to state tax was thus assessed by examining the proportion of value of railway lines within the state, and then taking that proportion of the company's total value (including the movable property) as the portion of value located within a certain state. When [[Wisconsin]] adopted a state income tax in 1911, it also used formulary apportionment (based on property, cost of manufacture, and sales), pointing to the impracticality of otherwise calculating separate accounts for companies operating in multiple states.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weiner|2005|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the mid-20th century, the "Massachusetts Formula" had become a commonly used standard of formulary apportionment. The formula placed an equal weight on three factors: group sales, payroll, and property within each jurisdiction.&lt;ref name="CAYp12"/&gt; Out of the forty-four states (plus one more jurisdiction, the [[District of Columbia]]) which imposed a corporate income tax in 1978, all but [[Iowa]] used the Massachusetts Formula.&lt;ref name="Mp72"&gt;{{harvnb|Mayer|2008|p=72}}; see also ''Moorman Mfg. Co. v. Bair'' ([http://supreme.justia.com/us/437/267/ 437 US 267])&lt;/ref&gt; Iowa's formula ignored payroll and property, looking solely at sales; the constitutionality of this formula was challenged in the ''Moorman'' case in Iowa, and it was held invalid by a trial court under the [[Due Process Clause]] of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] as well as the [[Commerce Clause]] of [[Article One of the United States Constitution|Article One]]; however, the [[Iowa Supreme Court]] reversed the trial court in 1978. This marked the beginning of a trend towards increasing weight on sales at the expense of the other two factors; by 2004, there were only twelve states still using an equally weighted formula.&lt;ref name="Mp72"/&gt;

==In international taxation==
Formulary apportionment is not used as a method of attributing profit between (rather than within) national tax jurisdictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|OECD|2010|para 1.16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The adoption of formulary apportionment has been advocated at various times since the 1970s.  The matter has been hotly debated by [[OECD]] member states beginning in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weiner|2005|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2000 Joann Weiner and Charles E. McLure Jr. proposed the use of formulary apportionment within the [[European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McLure|Weiner|2000|p=247}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2001, the EU issued a communication advocating the use of formulary apportionment.&lt;ref&gt;http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2001:0582:FIN:EN:PDF&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 Kimberley A. Clausing and Reuven Avi-Yonah suggested that the US [[Internal Revenue Service]] use formulary apportionment in the assessment of federal [[corporate tax in the United States|corporate income tax]], believing it would lead to increased tax revenue in the face of a trend for multinational corporations to use transfer pricing to shift profits out of the US into low-tax countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Clausing|Avi-Yonah|2007|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  None of these suggestions has been adopted.

Several US states allow, but do not mandate, that a corporate group include foreign entities for the purpose of assessing factors used in formulary apportionment ("worldwide unitary combination"). California, for example, began to accept worldwide unitary combination in the 1940s. However, its attempt to ''require'' such combination led to strong protests from US trading partners.&lt;ref name="MWp254"/&gt; The UK-US [[double taxation treaty]] signed in 1975 included a provision to prohibit US states from "tak[ing] into account the income, deductions, receipts, or out-goings of a related enterprise" in the United Kingdom or any other country for the purpose of determining tax liability.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-trty/uk.pdf US-UK Income Tax Convention (1975)] Article 9(4)&lt;/ref&gt; However, the US Senate, whose consent was required to ratify the treaty, rejected this provision,&lt;ref name="MWp254"/&gt; and the treaty was amended by a protocol in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-trty/uk.pdf US-UK Income Tax Convention (1975)] Protocol 3&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] explicitly held worldwide unitary combination as constitutional in separate cases in 1983 and 1994 ([[Barclays Bank PLC]] v. [[California Franchise Tax Board|Franchise Tax Board]]).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/pss/2204141 114 S.Ct. 2268 ]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1985 the United Kingdom passed retaliatory legislation which would have overridden the UK-US tax treaty and denied significant UK tax benefits to corporations headquartered in US states which applied worldwide unitary taxation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/1/section/812/enacted Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 Section 812]&lt;/ref&gt; This and further pressure from foreign governments,&lt;ref&gt;[http://yourdemocracy.newstatesman.com/parliament/unitary-taxation/HAN12824823 Debate in UK Parliament, December 18, 1989]&lt;/ref&gt; the executive branch and multinational corporations led US states to adopt a "water's edge" limitation on unitary combination, allowing taxpayers to decide for themselves whether or not to include foreign entities in their combined reporting.&lt;ref name="MWp254"/&gt;

== Criticism ==
Advocates claim that transfer pricing issues increase compliance costs, formulary apportionment reduces those costs and treating associated enterprises in a unitary fashion more closely reflects the underlying operating realities of multinational enterprises.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|OECD|2010|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics argue:
*Formulary apportionment leads to [[double taxation]] of the same profits unless there is agreement among all the jurisdictions on the formula to be used and the composition of the combined group.
*Tax could be avoided by manipulation of the components of the formula like the location of mobile assets.
*[[Compliance costs]] would be increased by the need to calculate each component of the formula in each jurisdiction.
*Compliance costs would be much higher unless all jurisdictions adopted a common method of calculating [[taxable profit]]s.  Otherwise a separate calculation of worldwide group profits would be required under each jurisdiction's [[tax accounting]] rules. The issue is significantly reduced within the United States and Canada because variations among each jurisdiction's tax accounting methods are relatively minor.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.taxjournal.com/tj/articles/debate-should-we-move-system-unitary-taxation-18122012&lt;/ref&gt;
*If members of the group account in different currencies, currency [[exchange rate]] movements could distort the results of the apportionment.
*Formulary apportionment does not reflect the economic profit or loss of each entity. For example, a profitable group that incurs a loss in a particular territory has taxable profit apportioned to that territory, and conversely a loss-making group which makes profits in a particular territory has no taxable profits in that territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|OECD|2010|pp=8&amp;ndash;10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Francis Fabien Michel Muguet''' (1955–2009) was a [[French people|French]] chemist who advocated open access to information.

==Biography==
Muguet graduated with a Ph.D from [[Texas Tech University]] with a thesis on water chemistry in 1992. His advisor was G. Wilse Robinson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Investigations of Diffuse Intermolecular Electronic Systems |author= Francis F. Muguet, M.S. |date= May 1992 |publisher= Texas Tech University |url= http://etd.lib.ttu.edu/theses/available/etd-02262009-31295007098873/unrestricted/31295007098873.pdf |accessdate= July 10, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
He also held a law degree. He was a researcher at [[ENSTA]] (Ecole Nationale Superieure de Techniques Avancées) from 1993 to 2009 and worked, during the last months of his life, as a consultant for [[International Telecommunication Union]] (ITU) and the [[University of Geneva]].

Defender of the free and open access to scientific content,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biomedcentral.com/openaccess/archive/?page=features&amp;issue=17 Lobbying for Open Access legislation]&lt;/ref&gt; he chaired the Civil Society Scientific Information Working Group, and co-ordinated a group on patents, trademarks and copyrights at the [[World Summit on the Information Society]] (WSIS).&lt;ref&gt;[http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=8194812893544942709# Dr. Francis Muguet's speech at Geneva]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=301222277851752196# Dr. Francis Muguet's speech at Tunis]&lt;/ref&gt;

Muguet is also known for designing the pattern of global patronage which aims to answer the legal argument raised against the global license under the Berne Convention on copyright. The sponsorship was supported by his friend [[Richard Stallman]] who co-authored with him the Declaration of Louisiana at a workshop organized by the French Society of the Internet on March 12, 2009. Muguet was then one of the founders of the SARD, a Society of acceptance and distribution of gifts inspired by the principles of global patronage.
His daughter found him on October 14, dead after not answering his mail for several days.
Following the announcement of his death, a change was made in the process of printing the book ''La bataille Hadopi'', to which he had contributed, dedicating it to him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=  Francis Muguet est mort |author= Mathieu Pasquini |date= October 17, 2009 |work= In Libro Veritas Bibliotheca |url= http://www.ilv-bibliotheca.net/blog/index.php?post/2009/10/17/Francis-Muguet-est-mort |accessdate= July 10, 2011 |language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= La bataille Hadopi |publisher= In libro veritas |year= 2009 |isbn= 978-2-35922-016-2 |language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Muguet was active in the World Network for Linguistic Diversity and point of contact for the Dynamic Coalition for Linguistic Diversity of the [[Internet Governance Forum]] and a member of [[ICVolunteers]]. From 2001 to 2005, he was Associate Editor MDPI Center Basel.

'''Facts'''

The case was handled by the [[Bombay High Court]], citation of the case AIR 1989 Bom 331 and was decided by [[Sujata Manohar|Justice S. Manohar]]. In this case, the [[plaintiff]]s (Garware Plastics and Polyester) had the right as way of assignment to telecast a cinematography film by means of video cassettes. One of the plaintiffs has granted the right of telecasting their films to the [[Government of India]] on their channel [[Doordarshan]] but have retained with themselves the right to telecast films via cable TV.

The defendant (Telelinks) bought the copyrighted videocassettes of the plaintiff and have shown the film on their Cable T.V.  Thereby infringing the copyright of the plaintiff in respect to public performance which is an exclusive right granted under the [[Copyright law of India|Indian Copyright Act, 1957]].

'''Main question of law'''

Whether by showing video films over Cable T.V. to various subscribers the defendants are broadcasting video films to the public and have infringed the copyright of the plaintiffs.

'''Main statutory provisions applied'''

Under Section 13(1), ''“A copyright is recognized in respect to cinematography films”.[1] Under S. 2(f), “Cinematography film”'', is defined to ''“include the sound track, if any, and cinematography shall be constructed as including any work produced by any process analogous to cinematography”''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://copyright.gov.in/|title=Copyright Office|website=copyright.gov.in|access-date=2016-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

S. 14(1)(c), “''"copyright in a cinematography film", means the exclusive right to do or authorize the doing of any of the following acts, namely: (I) to make a copy of the film: (ii) to cause the film, in so far as it consists if visual images, to be seen in public and, in so far as it consists of sounds, to be heard in public : (iii) to make any record embodying the recording in any part of the sound track associated with the film by utilizing such sound track: (iv) to communicate the film by broadcast.''”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://copyright.gov.in/|title=Copyright Office|website=copyright.gov.in|access-date=2016-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

S. 51. "''Copyright in a work shall be deemed to be infringed, inter alia, when any person, without a license granted by the Copyright under the Act, does anything the exclusive right to do which is by this Act conferred upon the owner of the copyright.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://copyright.gov.in/|title=Copyright Office|website=copyright.gov.in|access-date=2016-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Contention of the Defendant'''

The defendant argued that showing the film by means of cable t.v, the broadcast is only limited to private space&lt;ref&gt;Garware Plastics and Polyester vs Telelink, AIR 1989 Bom 331.&lt;/ref&gt; of the subscribers; therefore it isn’t a broadcast to the public.

'''Various Case laws applied in the case'''

To understand the difference between public and private broadcasting the following cases were referred to in the case.

''1.In Harms (Incorporated), Ltd and Chappell and Company Ltd vs Martans Club Limited&lt;ref&gt;(1927) 1 Ch 526&lt;/ref&gt;''

The plaintiffs were the owners of a play, “Tip Toes”. The defendant was a club, the club showed the play in the club. The main question before the court was, whether such an act was in public?

The court held that the purpose of the Act&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/|title=Legislation.gov.uk|website=www.legislation.gov.uk|access-date=2016-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; was to protect the author from any injury or loss of profit by reasons of any representation of his composition in public, which would have ordinarily fetched him financial gain. The Court distinguished “such an audience from a private or domestic audience which would consist of members of the family and members of the household. The court also considered the place where the performance took place. And held that the club, which accepted members from the public and guests, cannot be considered as a place which was equivalent to an enlarged family.&lt;ref&gt;(1927) 1 Ch 526&lt;/ref&gt;

''2.Messager vs British Broadcasting Company, Ltd''&lt;ref&gt;(1927) 2 KB 543&lt;/ref&gt;

The plaintiff was the composer of a comic opera, “''The little Michus”'', he gave the right to perform the opera to the producer, who in turn gave a license to BBC to broadcast it. The plaintiff filed a suit against BBC as he didn’t have a contract with them. BBC argued that the performance of the opera would take place in the privacy of its studio thereby as per the English Copyright Act, this wasn’t a broadcast to the public. The Court however rejected this assertion and held that since the opera was to be broadcast via wireless technology it was a broadcast to the public.

The decision was reverted by the Court of Appeals,&lt;ref&gt;(1928) 1KB 660&lt;/ref&gt; stating the agreement between the plaintiff and the producer and BBC.

3. ''Jennings vs Stephens''&lt;ref&gt;(1936) 1 Ch 469&lt;/ref&gt;

The Duston Women’s Institute without the consent of the plaintiff performed a performance of a copyrighted play. The Court concluded, that, ''“mere numbers cannot be the test.”''&lt;ref&gt;(1936) 1 Ch 469&lt;/ref&gt; The Court held, the true test is the, ''“character of the audience.”''&lt;ref&gt;(1936) 1 Ch 469&lt;/ref&gt;

The second test as given by the Court was, ''“ in public''", must be understood in relation to the owner of the copyright, that is performing in front of his/her public.&lt;ref&gt;(1936) 1 Ch 469&lt;/ref&gt;

The Court held that the performance was performed in private.

''4.Performance Right Society Ltd vs Hawthorns Hotel Ltd''&lt;ref&gt;(1933) 1 Ch 855&lt;/ref&gt;

The Court applied the above test in this case and held that the performance in the lounge of the hotel was a performance in public.

''5. Ernest Turner Electrical Instruments Ltd vs Performance Right Society Ltd''&lt;ref&gt;(1945) 1 Ch 167&lt;/ref&gt;

The court applied the Jennings vs Stephens&lt;ref&gt;(1933) 1 Ch 855&lt;/ref&gt; test to see the nature of music being played at work place.

''6.Perforing Right Society Ltd vs Hammons Brandford Brewery Co. Ltd''&lt;ref&gt;(1933) All ER Rep 270&lt;/ref&gt;

In this case the court held importance on nature of the place where the performance took place. In this case, the plaintiff had given a license to the defendant to play the music in the hotel but the defendant used loudspeakers which by standers could also hear, the court held that this was a performance in public.

''7. Performing Rights Society Ltd vs Camelo''&lt;ref&gt;(1936) 3 All Er 557&lt;/ref&gt;

The fact of the case as similar to the Brandford Brewery case, the defendant used loudspeakers which could be heard in the adjacent buildings, the court held there was an infringement because it was performed in public.

''8. Mellor vs Australian Broadcasting Commission''&lt;ref&gt;1940 AC 491&lt;/ref&gt;

The plaintiff by way of pamphlets stated their music was free for public performance, the plaintiff brought a suit of infringement against the defendant, the Privy Council, stated, “''The original performance in the studio may be, and generally will be, a performance in private. In such a case the broadcast performance at the receiving end., if in public and unlicensed, will be an infringements of copyright at that place....... If the broadcast is picked up only by listeners in private it might be different to establish that there is a public performance : for each performance would be separate, and each would be private: but it is not necessary to express an opinion on this point.”''&lt;ref&gt;1940 AC 491&lt;/ref&gt;

The Privy Council stated it didn’t express an opinion on whether the performance was in public or private.

'''Observations of the Bombay High Court'''

The Bombay High Court observations were guided by the various English cases. In most of these cases the owner of the copyright did give protection. In trying to answer the question of law presented before the court, the concluded three main conditions for the determination of where a work is performed in public or private, they are
* ''Nature of the audience,''
*  ''Whether the audience in relation to the owner of the copyright can be so considered and,''
* ''Whether such performance effects the protection of the copyright holder.''

Answering the first condition - Trying to answer the first one, the Court held that of course the movie is being viewed in the privacy of the home, but that doesn’t negate the fact that is can be seen by others in public setting. While explaining this situation, the Court, used the opined of Justice Mc Cardie in Messager v. British Broadcasting Company Ltd,&lt;ref&gt;(1927) 2 KB 543&lt;/ref&gt; ''“instead of gathering the audience in a theater, the defendants, by modern technology, are showing the film to that audience in their homes. To hold that this is not communication to the public would be to ignore the substance of the matter and the object and intent of the Copyright Act.''”,&lt;ref&gt;(1927) 2 KB 543&lt;/ref&gt; thus the viewers are members of the public.

Answer to the second condition – The second condition related to the relationship between the owner of the copyright and the views, the Court held, that these viewers aren’t the domestic viewers of the plaintiff but rather members of the public.

Answer to the third condition – the last condition is generally used to determine the character of the audience in respect to the Indian Copyright Act,1957. The court opined the main aim of the Act is to give monetary gains to the owner for his/her intellectual property, the Court held that since the defendant charge  a fee for the cable services he has deprived the owner of the copyright.

The Court, concluded, ''“In my view, a strong prima facie case has been made out by the plaintiffs for granting them interim relief. Undoubtedly the business of the defendants will be affected as a result. But the plaintiffs will be severely affected if their copyright in the films is not protected, while the defendants can show the films after obtaining a licence under the Copyright Act.”''&lt;ref&gt;Garware Plastics and Polyester vs Telelink, AIR 1989 Bom 331&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Judgment of the Court'''

The Court gave an interim order against the defendants from showing the film via cable t.v.

'''Similar Landmark case from the United States of America'''

''[[American Broadcasting Cos. v. Aereo, Inc.|American Broadcasting vs Aereo, Inc]]''&lt;ref&gt;573 U.S. ___ (2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

In this case, the defendant provided an online facility for its viewers to view T.V. programs while they were being aired on the television. The owners of the programs who were producers contended that they are the copyright owners of the programs, and the action of the defendant amounted to infringements. The Court opined, that the defendant wasn’t showing the programs for free, they were showing them to their subscribers after they had paid a fee. They held that the defendant was depriving the copyright owners of their monetary gains from their intellectual property.

The U.S. Supreme Court held, the right to broadcast to the public was an exclusive right&lt;ref&gt;17 U.S.C. § ''106, U.S. Copyright Act, 1976''&lt;/ref&gt; of the copyright owner as per the American Copyright Act, 1976, and they decided in favor of the plaintiff.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3128">{{Politics of Ghana}}

A '''referendum on the system of government''' was held in [[Ghana]] on 30 March 1978.

==Background==
In December 1971 the government of [[Kofi Abrefa Busia]] drastically devalued the [[Ghanaian cedi|cedi]]. However, the authorities' inability to control the subsequent inflationary pressures led to discontent, and military officers seized power in a bloodless coup on 13 January 1972.

The coup leaders, led by Col. [[Ignatius Kutu Acheampong]], formed the [[National Redemption Council]] (NRC) to which they admitted other officers, the head of the police, and one civilian. The NRC promised improvements in the quality of life for all Ghanaians and based its programs on nationalism, economic development, and self-reliance. In 1975, a government reorganization resulted in the NRC's replacement by the [[Supreme Military Council, Ghana|Supreme Military Council]] (SMC), also headed by now-General Acheampong.

Unable to deliver on its promises, the NRC/SMC became increasingly marked by mismanagement and rampant corruption. In 1977, General Acheampong brought forward the concept of union government (UNIGOV), which would make Ghana a non-party state. 

==Question==
The referendum posed the question:
*''Do you approve whether or not some form of Union Government would become the basis of Ghana's political system?''

There were 4,497,803 registered voters for the referendum.

==Aftermath==
Although the referendum passed, professional groups and students perceived UNIGOV to be ploy by Acheampong to retain power, and continued the strikes and demonstrations against the government which had begun in 1977. The steady erosion in Acheampong's power led to his arrest in July 1978 by his chief of staff, Lt. Gen. [[Fred Akuffo]], who replaced him as head of state and leader of what became known as the SMC-2.

Akuffo abandoned UNIGOV and established a plan to return to constitutional and democratic government. A Constitutional Assembly was established, and political party activity was revived. Akuffo was unable to solve Ghana's economic problems, however, or to reduce the rampant corruption in which senior military officers played a major role. On 4 June 1979, his government was deposed in a violent coup by a group of junior and non-commissioned officers - the [[Armed Forces Revolutionary Council, Ghana|Armed Forces Revolutionary Council]] (AFRC) - with Flt. Lt. [[Jerry Rawlings]] as its chairman. [[Ghanaian presidential election, 1979|Presidential]] and [[Ghanaian parliamentary election, 1979|parliamentary]] elections were held in the summer of 1979.

{{Gun laws by country}}
'''[[Gun laws|Firearms legislation]] in [[Switzerland]]'''  allows the free purchase of [[semi-automatic firearm|semi-automatic]], but not [[automatic firearm|fully automatic]] firearms by Swiss citizens and foreigners with permanent residence.&lt;ref name="SR514.541.11" group=note&gt;The law of 1997 (SR 514.54) made explicit provision for the Federal Council to restrict gun ownership by nationality (art. 7 WG/LArm). SR 514.541 art. 12, passed in 2008, amended in 2014, explicitly prohibits the purchase or ownership of weapons to nationals of eight states: [[Serbia]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Kosovo]], [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]], [[Turkey]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Algeria]] and [[Albania]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WV/&gt;
Permits for [[concealed carry|concealed carrying in public]] are issued sparingly.&lt;ref group=note&gt;SR 514.54 art. 27 § 4. No carry permit is necessary for hunting rifles carried by registered hunters with a hunting licence in the context of hunting or game-keeping, and historical firearms carried in the context of re-enactment or memorial events. Justifiable transport of unloaded firearms is regulated in art. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WG/&gt; The acquisition of fully automatic weapons, silencers and target lasers likewise requires special permits issued by the cantonal firearms office&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fedpol.admin.ch/fedpol/en/home/sicherheit/waffen/verboten.html |title=Banned weapons, ammunition and weapon components |publisher=Federal Office of Police, fedpol |location=Berne, Switzerland |type=official site |language=German, Italian, French, English |date=15 May 2018 |accessdate=2018-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The applicable federal legislations are ''[[Systematic Compilation of Federal Legislation|SR]] 514.54 Federal Law on Weapons, Weapon Equipment and Ammunition'' ({{lang-de|Waffengesetz, WG}}, {{lang-fr|Loi sur les armes, LArm}}, {{lang-it|Legge sulle armi, LArm}}) of 20 June 1997 (current edition of 1.

(The right to acquire, possess and carry arms is guaranteed in the framework of this law.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WG/&gt;

Swiss [[gun culture]] has emerged from a long tradition of [[Schützenfest#Switzerland|shooting (''tirs'')]], which served as a formative element of [[national identity]] in the [[Restoration and Regeneration in Switzerland|post-Napoleonic Restoration of the Confederacy]],&lt;ref&gt;Julie Hartley-Moore, "The Song of Gryon: Political Ritual, Local Identity, and the Consolidation of Nationalism in Multiethnic Switzerland", ''Journal of American Folklore'' 120.476 (2007) 204–229, citing Kohn Hans Kohn, ''Nationalism and Liberty: The Swiss Example''. London: George Allen and Unwin, 1956, p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; and the long-standing practice of a [[militia]] organization of the [[Swiss Army]] in which soldiers' [[service rifle]]s are stored privately at their homes. In addition to this, many [[Cantons of Switzerland|cantons]] (notably the alpine cantons of [[Grisons]] and [[Valais]]) have strong traditions of [[hunting]], accounting for a large but unknown number of privately held hunting rifles.

==Number of guns in circulation==
Switzerland thus has a relatively high [[gun ownership rate]]. There are no official statistics, and estimates vary considerably.

The 2017 report from [[Small Arms Survey]] has estimated that the number of civilian-held firearms in Switzerland is of 2.332 million, which given a population of 8.4 million corresponds to a gun ownership of around 27.6 guns per 100 residents.&lt;ref name=SMS&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.smallarmssurvey.org/de/weapons-and-markets/tools/global-firearms-holdings.html |title=Global Firearms Holdings Dynamic Map |work=smallarmssurvey.org |publisher=Institut de hautes études internationales et du développement |location=Geneva, Switzerland |date=June 2018 |accessdate=2018-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SMS2&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.smallarmssurvey.org/fileadmin/docs/Weapons_and_Markets/Tools/Firearms_holdings/SAS-Infographics-global-firearms-holdings.pdf |title=Infographics on Global Firearms Holdings |work=smallarmssurvey.org |publisher=Institut de hautes études internationales et du développement |location=Geneva, Switzerland |date=June 2018 |accessdate=2018-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Switzerland joined the [[Schengen Information System]] in 2008, it was forced to introduce a central registry for firearms. 
Only firearms which changed hands since 2008 are registered. The number of registered firearms in this database
was reported as 876,000 as of August 2017.&lt;ref&gt;Erich Aschwanden, [https://www.nzz.ch/schweiz/waffen-datenbank-in-der-schweiz-sind-876000-pistolen-und-gewehre-registriert-ld.1311250 In der Schweiz gibt es mehr Pistolen und Gewehre als geschätzt], [[NZZ]], 17 August 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regulation==
Switzerland's Weapons Law (WG, LArm)&lt;ref name=WG/&gt; and Weapons Act (WV, OArm)&lt;ref name=WV/&gt; has been revised to accede to the [[Schengen Treaty]] effective 12 December 2008. The Act on Personal Military Equipment (VPAA, OEPM) governs the handling of military equipment, and in particular the handling of personal weapons by military personnel.&lt;ref name=VPAA&gt;{{cite web |title=SR 514.10 Verordnung über die persönliche Ausrüstung der Armeeangehörigen (VPAA) |url=http://www.admin.ch/opc/de/classified-compilation/20031028/index.html |date=5 December 2003 |publisher=The Swiss Federal Council |language=de, fr, it |accessdate=2014-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The law is applied to the following weapons:
* Firearms, such as pistols, revolvers, rifles, [[pump gun]]s ({{lang-de|Vorderschaftrepetierer}}), [[lever action|lever-action rifles]], self-loading guns (shotguns and rifles).
* Air and CO2 guns with a muzzle energy of at least 7.5 joules, or if there is risk of confusion with a firearm.
* Imitation, blank firing guns ({{lang-de|Schreckschuss}}) and air-soft guns when there is risk of confusion with a firearm.
* [[Switchblade|Butterfly knives]], throwing knives, switchblade or automatic knives with total length greater than 12&amp;nbsp;cm and blade length greater than 5&amp;nbsp;cm.
* Daggers with a symmetrical blade less than 30&amp;nbsp;cm.
* Devices that are intended to hurt people such as batons ({{lang-de|Schlagrute}}), throwing star, brass knuckles, [[Sling (weapon)|slings]] with armrest.
* Electric shock devices and spray products with irritants in Annex 2 weapons ordinance (WV/OArm), except for pepper spray.
[[File:Stand-tir-p1000495.jpg|thumb|right|The federal shooting range of [[Versoix]], Switzerland; people come to such ranges to complete mandatory training ("Obligatorischschiessen") with service arms, or to shoot for sport and competition.]]
Generally prohibited arms are:
* Automatic [[Firearm#Repeating, semi-automatic, and automatic firearms|firearms]] such as machine guns.
* Automatic knives when the blade more than 5&amp;nbsp;cm and total length of more than 12&amp;nbsp;cm.
* Butterfly knives when the blade more than 5&amp;nbsp;cm and total length of more than 12&amp;nbsp;cm.
* Throwing knives; regardless of the shape and size.
* Symmetrical daggers where blade length is less than 30&amp;nbsp;cm.
* Brass knuckles.
* Shock rods or stun guns.
* Throwing Stars.
* Buttstock-equipped slingshots ({{lang-de|Schleudern mit Armstütze}}).
* Tasers.
* Hidden firearms that imitate an object of utility, such as shooting phones.

===Acquisition===

====Buying guns====
In order to purchase most weapons, the purchaser must obtain a weapon acquisition permit (art. 8 WG/LArm). Swiss citizens and foreigners with a C permit over the age of 18 who are not psychiatrically disqualified nor identified as posing security problems, and who have a clean criminal record can request such a permit. Foreigners with citizenship to the following countries are explicitly excluded from the right to possess weapons: Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, Macedonia, Turkey, Sri Lanka, Algeria and Albania.&lt;ref name="SR514.541.11" group=note/&gt;
The following information must be provided to the cantonal weapon bureau together with the weapon application form:
* valid official identification or passport copy.
* residence address.
* criminal record copy not older than 3 months.

For each transfer of a weapon or an essential weapon component without weapons acquisition permit (art. 10 WG/LArm), a written contract must be concluded. Each Party shall keep them at least ten years. The contract must include the following information (art. 11 WG/LArm):
* Family name, first name, birth date, residence address and signature of the person who sells the weapon or essential weapon component.
* Family name, first name, birth date, residence address and signature of the person who purchases the weapon or an essential weapon component.
* Kind of weapon, manufacturer or producer, label, caliber, weapon number, and date and place of transfer.
* Type and number of the official identification of the person who acquires the weapon or the essential weapon component.
* and an indication of the processing of personal data in connection with the contract in accordance with the privacy policy of the Federation or the cantons, if firearms are transmitted.

This information must be sent within 30 days to the cantonal weapon registration bureau, where the weapon holders are registered (art. 9 WG/LArm).

Some weapons do not need a weapon acquisition permit (art. 10 WG/LArm):
* Single-shot and multi-barreled hunting rifles and replicas of single-shot muzzle loaders.
* Hand bolt-action rifles, which are commonly used in off-duty and sporting gunnery recognized by the military law of 3 February 1952 and shooting clubs for hunting purposes in Switzerland.
* Single-shot rabbit slayer.
* Compressed air and CO2 weapons that develop a muzzle energy of at least 7.5 joules, or their appearance may be mistaken for real firearms.

====Buying ammunition====
[[File:Cartouches-Fass90-p1000785.jpg|thumb|right|Ready ammunition of the Swiss Army. Soldiers equipped with the [[Sig 550]] assault rifle used to be issued 50 rounds of ammunition in a sealed can, to be opened only upon alert and for use while en route to join their unit. This practice was stopped in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/Specials/Gun_debate/Background/Archives/Soldiers_can_keep_guns_at_home_but_not_ammo.html?cid=970614 |title=Soldiers can keep guns at home but not ammo |publisher=SWI Swissinfo.ch, a branch of the Swiss Broadcasting Corporation (SBC) |date=27 September 2007 |accessdate=2015-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In order to purchase ammunition, the buyer must follow the same legal rules that apply when buying guns. The buyer must provide the following information to the seller (art. 15, 16 WG/LArm; art. 24 WV/OArm):&lt;ref name=WG/&gt;&lt;ref name=WV/&gt;
*a passport or other valid official identification (the holder must be over 18 years of age and not psychiatrically disqualified nor identified as posing security problems. Further, they must not be a citizen of the following countries (art. 12 WV/OArm): Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, Macedonia, Turkey, Sri Lanka, Algeria and Albania).
*their residential address.
*a copy of their criminal record or police check, not older than 3 months.


[[File:Schwarzpulver behaelter.jpg|thumb|A Swiss 100 gram black powder container.]]
The possession of the following ammunition is generally prohibited:
* Armor-piercing bullets.
* Ammunition with projectile containing an explosive or incendiary device.
* Ammunition with one or more projectiles releasing substances which damage the health of people in the long run, particularly those mentioned in annex 2  of the WV/OArm.
* Ammunition, missiles and missile launchers for military explosive.
* Ammunition with projectiles for transmitting electric shocks.
* Ammunition for handguns which may cause deformations.

===Carrying guns===
To carry a firearm in public or outdoors (and for a militia member to carry a firearm other than his issued weapons while off-duty), a person must have a gun carrying permit ({{lang-de|Waffentragbewilligung}}, {{lang-fr|permis de port d'armes}}, {{lang-it|permesso di porto di armi}}; art. 27 WG/LArm), which in most cases is issued only to private citizens working in occupations such as security.&lt;ref name=WG/&gt; It is, however, quite common to see a person in military service to be ''en route'' with his rifle, albeit unloaded. The issue of such exceptional permits are extremely selective (see [[#Conditions_for_obtaining_a_Carrying_Permit]]).

However, it is permissible to carry firearms in public or outdoors if the holder (art. 27 § 4 WG/LArm):
* Has a valid hunting license and is carrying the firearm for hunting.
* Is participating in a demonstration and is carrying the firearm in reference to a historical event.
* Is participating in a shooting competition for air-soft guns, provided that the competition has a secure perimeter.
* Is an airport security officer for an authorized country, a border patrol officer, or a game warden, who is carrying the firearm in the course of their employment.

Furthermore, any licensed holder of a gun may ''transport'' an unloaded firearm for special situations (see [[#Transporting guns]]).

====Conditions for obtaining a Carrying Permit====
There are three conditions (art. 27 § 2 WG/LArm):
* fulfilling the conditions for a buying permit (see section above).
* stating plausibly the need to carry firearms to protect oneself, other people, or real property from a specified danger.
* passing an examination proving both weapon handling skills and knowledge regarding lawful use of the weapon.

The carrying permit remains valid for a term of five years (unless otherwise surrendered or revoked), and applies only to the type of firearm for which the permit was issued. Additional constraints may be invoked to modify any specific permit. (art. 27 § 3 WG/LArm).

===Transporting guns===
Guns may be transported in public as long as an appropriate justification is present. This means to transport a gun in public, the following requirements apply (art. 28 WG/LArm):
* The gun must be unloaded and transported separately from any ammunition, with no ammunition being transported in a magazine.
* The transport must be by the shortest reasonable route and requires a valid purpose:
** To or from courses or exercises in marksmanship, hunting or for military purposes.
** To or from an army warehouse.
** To show the gun to a possible buyer.
** To or from a holder of a valid arms trade permit.
** To or from a specific event, e.g. gun shows.
** During change of residence.

===EU Gun Ban===

The restrictions must be introduced into the Swiss legal system by August 2018 due to its membership of the [[Schengen area]].

The Directive also includes an exemption covering a specific Swiss issue – it allows possession to a ''target shooter'' of ''one'' firearm used during the mandatory military period after leaving the army, provided it was converted to semi-automatic only (art. 6(6) of the Amendment Directive).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?type=TA&amp;language=EN&amp;reference=P8-TA-2017-0068 |title=Position of the European Parliament adopted at first reading on 14 March 2017 with a view to the adoption of Directive (EU) 2017/... of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Directive 91/477/EEC on control of the acquisition and possession of weapons |id=P8_TC1-COD(2015)0269 |publisher=European Parliament |date=14 March 2017 |location=Strasbourg |type=Parliamentary decision |accessdate=2017-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; This part of the Directive specifically was however [[European Firearms Directive#European Court of Justice challenge|challenged by the Czech Republic]] before the [[European Court of Justice]] due to its discriminatory nature.

Civil rights organizations plan to hold a referendum to reject the recent EU directive.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.finger-weg-vom-schweizer-waffenrecht.ch/2017/04/offener-brief-an-den-bundesrat-nationalrat-staenderat/&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;https://www.nzz.ch/schweiz/waffenrecht-schiessen-schweizer-schuetzen-schengen-ab-ld.1085409&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Swiss People's Party]] vice-president [[Christoph Blocher]], Switzerland should consider abandoning EU's borderless [[Schengen Area]] if the Swiss people reject the proposed measures in a referendum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-swiss-eu-guns-idUSKCN1161KT| title=Swiss tell EU: Hands off veterans' assault rifles |publisher=Reuters|accessdate=2017-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Army-issued arms and ammunition collection==
The [[Swiss army]] has long been a [[militia]] trained and structured to rapidly respond against foreign aggression. Swiss males grow up expecting to undergo basic military training, usually at age 20 in the recruit school, the basic-training camp, after which Swiss men remain part of the "militia" in reserve capacity until age 30 (age 34 for officers).

Prior to 2007, members of the Swiss Militia were supplied with 50 rounds of ammunition for their military weapon in a sealed ammo box that was regularly audited by the government. This was so that, in the case of an emergency, the militia could respond quickly.

[[File:Stand-tir-p1000496.jpg|thumb|right|The federal shooting range of [[Versoix]], Switzerland; people come to such ranges to complete mandatory training (''Obligatorischeschiessen'') with service arms, or to shoot for sport and competition.]]
In December 2007, the [[Swiss Federal Council]] decided that the distribution of ammunition to soldiers would stop and that previously issued ammo would be returned. By March 2011, more than 99% of the ammo has been received. Only 2,000 specialist militia members (who protect airports and other sites of particular sensitivity) are permitted to keep their military-issued ammunition at home. The rest of the militia get their ammunition from their military armory in the event of an emergency.&lt;ref name=WG/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.admin.ch/opc/de/classified-compilation/20031035/index.html |title=SR 514.101 Verordnung des VBS über die persönliche Ausrüstung der Armeeangehörigen (VPAA-VBS) vom 9.

Januar 2015): art. 7 Taschenmunition Ziff 1 |publisher=The Swiss Federal Council |location=Berne, Switzerland |type=official site |language=de, fr, it |date=21 December 2007 |accessdate=2016-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nzzammo&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nzz.ch/nachrichten/politik/schweiz/taschenmunition_fast_vollstaendig_eingezogen_1.10450798.html |title=Taschenmunition fast vollständig eingezogen |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2 May 2011|newspaper=Neue Zürcher Zeitung |language=German |location=Zurich, Switzerland |accessdate=2015-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When their period of service has ended, militia men have the choice of keeping their personal weapon and other selected items of their equipment. However, keeping the weapon after end of service requires a weapon acquisition permit (art. 11-15 VPAA/OEPM).&lt;ref name=VPAA/&gt;

The government sponsors training with rifles and shooting in competitions for interested adolescents, both male and female. The sale of military-issued ammunition{{spaced ndash}}including [[Gw Pat.90]] rounds for army-issued [[assault rifle]]s{{spaced ndash}}is subsidized by the Swiss government and made available at the many Federal Council licensed shooting ranges. That ammunition sold at ranges must be immediately used there under supervision (art. 16 WG/LArm).

The Swiss Army maintains tightened adherence to high standards of lawful military conduct. In 2005, for example, when the Swiss prosecuted recruits who had reenacted the torture scenes of [[Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse|Abu Ghraib]], one of the charges was improper use of service weapons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.20min.ch/news/schweiz/story/20813663 |title=Schweizer Rekruten spielen Irak-Folterer |author=Patrick Marbach |date=15 August 2005 |newspaper=20 Minuten |language=German |location=Zurich, Switzerland |accessdate=2015-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recreational shooting===
Recreational shooting is widespread in Switzerland. Practice with guns is a popular form of recreation, and is encouraged by the government, particularly for the members of the militia.

Prior to the turn of the century, about 200,000 people used to attend the annual ''Eidgenössisches Feldschiessen'', which is the largest rifle shooting competition in the world. In 2012 they counted 130,000 participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lebendige-traditionen.ch/traditionen/00234/index.html?lang=en |title=Feldschiessen |publisher=Lebendige Traditionen |accessdate=2015-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the 2015 Federal Shooting (''Eidg. Schützenfest'') 37,000 shooters are registered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nzz.ch/schweiz/aktuelle-themen/familienausflug-mit-dem-sturmgewehr-1.18571604 |title=Familienausflug mit dem Sturmgewehr |author=Giannis Mavris |language=German |newspaper=Neuste Zürcher Zeitung (NZZ) |location=Zurich, Switzerland |date=4 July 2015 |accessdate=2015-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, there are several private shooting ranges which rent guns.

==Gun culture in Switzerland==
{{See also|Global gun cultures#Switzerland}}
Switzerland has a strong gun culture compared to other countries in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last1=Bachmann | first1=Helena | title=The Swiss Difference: A Gun Culture That Works | url=http://world.time.com/2012/12/20/the-swiss-difference-a-gun-culture-that-works/ | date=December 20, 2012 | publisher=''[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]'' | accessdate=March 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last1=Nelson | first1=Soraya Sarhaddi | title=What's Worked, And What Hasn't, In Gun-Loving Switzerland | url=https://www.npr.org/2013/03/19/174758723/facing-switzerland-gun-culture | date=March 19, 2013 | publisher=''[[NPR]]'' | accessdate=March 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Groups like [[ProTell]] lobby for the preservation of Switzerland's gun rights. Additionally, the [[Schweizerischer Schützenverein]], a Swiss shooting association, organizes the ''[[Eidgenössisch]]e [[Schützenfest]]e'', every five years and the ''Eidgenössisches Feldschiessen'' is held annually. Every person with a swiss citizenship, aged 10 years or older, can take part at any federal ranges and will be able to shoot for free with the ordinance rifle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.swissshooting.ch/Portaldata/1/Resources/dokumente/reglemente/gewehr300m/efs/3_10_01_d_EFS_Regl_2016.pdf |title=Reglement über das Eidgenössische Feldschiessen |publisher=SCHWEIZER SCHIESSSPORTVERBAND SSV, |date=2016 |accessdate=2016-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another possibility for the kids to shoot is the Young Shooters: the SAT (lit. shooting and off-duty activities) oversees lessons in which Swiss children can learn how to shoot using the [[SIG SG 550]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.admin.ch/opc/de/classified-compilation/20030864/index.html#a15 |title=SR 512.31 Verordnung über das Schiesswesen ausser Dienst (Schiessverordnung) |publisher=The Swiss Federal Council |location=Berne, Switzerland |type=official site |language=de, fr, it |date=1 January 2018 |accessdate=2018-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This activity is free and the Young Shooters are able to take home the rifle in-between the lessons if they are 17&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.admin.ch/opc/de/classified-compilation/20081148/index.html#a23 |title=SR 514.541 Verordnung über Waffen, Waffenzubehör und Munition (Waffenverordnung, WV) |publisher=The Swiss Federal Council |location=Berne, Switzerland |type=official site |language=de, fr, it |date=1 July 2016 |accessdate=2018-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;. For security reasons however, the [[Breech-loading weapon|breech]] has to stay at the range in which they attend the lesson. This training takes place over a span of 6 years within a 3-4 month period each year and, if wanted, they can become instructors for the new generation of Young Shooters.

Traditionally liberal Swiss gun legislation has, however, been somewhat tightened in 2008, when Switzerland has complied with [[European Firearms Directive]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.loc.gov/law/help/firearms-control/switzerland.php&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the modern political history of Switzerland, there have been advocates for tighter [[gun control]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The most recent suggestion for tighter gun control was rejected in a [[Swiss referendum, February 2011|popular referendum in February 2011]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-12441834 |title=Switzerland rejects tighter gun controls |date=13 February 2011 |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |newspaper=BBC News |accessdate=2015-08-26}}.

==Firearm-related deaths==
The vast majority of [[List of countries by firearm-related death rate|firearm-related deaths]] in Switzerland are suicides. The [[suicide method]] of shooting oneself with a firearm accounted for 21.5% of [[Suicide in Switzerland|suicides in Switzerland]] in the period of 2001–2012 (with significant gender imbalance: 29.7% of male suicides vs. 3.0% of female suicides).&lt;ref name=bag15&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.npg-rsp.ch/fileadmin/npg-rsp/Themen/Fachthemen/BAG_2015_Suizid_Epidemiologie.pdf |title=Epidemiologie von Suiziden, Suizidversuchen und assistierten Suiziden in der Schweiz, April 2015 |publisher=Federal Office of Public Health |editors=Elvira Keller-Guglielmetti, Esther Walter |date=April 2015 |accessdate=2017-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By contrast, [[gun crime]] is comparatively limited. In 2016, there were 187 attempted and 45 completed homicides, for a homicide rate of 0.50 per 100,000 population. Of the recorded homicides (attempted or completed), 20.3% were committed with a gun (47 cases, compared to an average of 41 cases in the period of 2009–2015). In addition, there were 7 cases of bodily harm and 233 cases of robbery committed with firearms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/de/home.assetdetail.2160352.html |title=Polizeiliche Kriminalstatistik (PKS) – Jahresbericht 2016 |date=23 March 2015 |publisher=Swiss Federal Statistical Office (SFO) |location=Neuchâtel, Switzerland |language=fr, de, it |type=official federal site |pages=13, 36–38 |format=PDF |isbn=978-3-303-19065-4 |accessdate=2017-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were 16 completed homicides with a firearm in 2016. Of these, 14 were committed with a handgun, one with a long gun and one case marked "other/unspecified". None of the involved weapons were ordinance weapons issued by the [[Swiss Armed Forces]]. Similarly, out of 31 attempted homicides with firearms, 25 were committed with handguns, two with long guns and four "other/unspecified", with no use of ordinance weapons on record. For the period of  2009–2016, on average 16.5 out of 49.4 completed homicides were committed with a firearm, 13.8 with handguns, 1.9 with long guns and 0.9 "other/unspecified"; an average 0.75 cases per year (6 cases in eight years) involved ordinance weapons.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/de/home/statistiken/kriminalitaet-strafrecht/polizei/gewalt.assetdetail.2260398.html Tötungsdelikt: Aufklärung und Vorjahresvergleich (vollendet und versucht) nach Tatmittel, Beschuldigte und Geschädigte 2016] 27 March 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1907 [[Stanley Shaw Bond]], editor at [[Butterworths]], began a project to produce a complete statement of the law of [[England and Wales]] that was authoritative, comprehensive and up-to-date. Bond tracked down the former [[Lord Chancellor]], [[Hardinge Giffard, 1st Earl of Halsbury|The Earl of Halsbury]], on holiday in [[Nice]] to invite him to be the editor-in-chief of ''The Laws of England''.&lt;ref name="lexisnexis.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lexisnexis.co.uk/HalsburysLaw/halsburys_laws_about.html|title=Halsbury's Laws|website=lexisnexis.co.uk|accessdate=18 September 2017}} {{irrelevant citation|date=September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, the role of editor-in-chief of ''Halsbury's Laws'' is held by a former Lord Chancellor, and the current incumbent is [[James Mackay, Baron Mackay of Clashfern|Lord Mackay of Clashfern]].

In 2007, ''Halsbury's Laws'' celebrated its centenary with an evening of seminars led by Lord Mackay of Clashfern and professor [[Richard Susskind]], and the publication of a collection of centenary essays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lexisnexis.co.uk/store/catalog/printProductDetailInfo.jsp?prodId=ukprod9781405733915HLCE&amp;price=19.95&amp;skuId=uksku9781405733915HLCE9841 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-10-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928123247/http://www.lexisnexis.co.uk/store/catalog/printProductDetailInfo.jsp?prodId=ukprod9781405733915HLCE&amp;price=19.95&amp;skuId=uksku9781405733915HLCE9841 |archivedate=2011-09-28 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt;

==First edition==
[[File:Cover page halsburys.jpg|thumb|The title and copyright page of volume 1 of the first edition of ''Halsbury's Laws of England'' (1907).]]

The first edition was published in 31 volumes from 1907 to 1917.&lt;ref name="Leslie F Maxwell 1957. Page 152"&gt;John S James and Leslie F Maxwell. ''[[A Legal Bibliography of the British Commonwealth of Nations]]''. Second Edition. Sweet &amp; Maxwell. 1957. Volume 2. Page 152.&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, new editions have been launched at intervals of about 20 to 30 years.{{Fact|date=January 2015}}

Volume 1 was published in 1907. Its articles run from [[Action (legal)|action]] to [[banking|bankers and banking]]. The volume deals with action, [[Admiralty law|admiralty]], [[Agency (law)|agency]], [[agriculture]], [[alien (law)|alien]]s, [[wikt:allotment|allotments]], [[animals]], [[arbitration]], [[auction]], [[bailment]] and bankers and banking.{{fact|date=February 2016}} 

Volume 2 was published in 1908. Its articles run from [[bankruptcy]] to [[bills of exchange]]. It contains but four treatises, upon bankruptcy and [[Insolvency (law)|insolvency]] (335 pages), [[barristers]] (67 pages), [[bastardy]] (28 pages) and bills of exchange, [[promissory notes]] and negotiable instruments (124 pages).&lt;ref&gt;J B A (1908) 22 ''Harvard Law Review'' 71 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1325489 JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

Volume 5 (companies) is devoted entirely to company law, and forms a treatise of 768 pages on that subject. After a general consideration of the nature and domicile of companies, the work considers briefly the history of company legislation. Then follows an elaborate treatise on the [[Companies (Consolidation) Act 1908|Companies Act 1908]]. Special companies, like banking, insurance and public service companies, are considered; as well as chartered companies, the livery companies of the city of London, quasi-corporations, and illegal companies; and a few pages are devoted to foreign companies. The reviewer in the ''Harvard Law Review'' thought the table of cases cited must contain at least five thousand cases. He said the importance of this treatise was at once apparent; and that to the commercial lawyer in the Eastern cities of the United States it would be exceedingly useful.

The articles in volume 11 run from descent to ecclesiastical law. It contains a short article on descent and distribution; a discussion of discovery, inspection and interrogatories, under the English practice; an elaborate article on distress; an article on easements and profits, which the ''Harvard Law Review'' said was the most interesting article in the volume to an American lawyer; and an elaborate disquisition on ecclesiastical law.

The articles in volume 12 run from education to electric lighting and power. The Harvard Law Review said that the articles on education and elections had comparatively little value to the American bar, but the hundred pages devoted to electric lighting and power were useful.&lt;ref&gt;J H B, "Book Reviews" (1910) 24 ''Harvard Law Review'' 163 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1324858 JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

Volume 20 was published in 1911. Its articles run from markets to misrepresentation. It contains articles on markets and fairs (59 pages), master and servant (221 pages), medicine and pharmacy (82 pages), the Metropolis (106 pages), mines, minerals and quarries (156 pages) and misrepresentation and fraud (110 pages). According to the ''[[Harvard Law Review]]'', the article on master and servant was of constant interest to an American lawyer; and that on misrepresentation and fraud, from the master hand of G Spencer Bower, was a valuable treatise in itself.
   
Volume 21 was published in 1912. Its articles run from mistake to partition. It contains articles on mistake (34 pages), money and money lending (29 pages), mortgage (283 pages), negligence (134 pages), notaries (9 pages), nuisance (72 pages), Parliament (197 pages) and partition (59 pages). The ''Harvard Law Review'' said that the standard set by the preceding volumes appeared to be maintained and that the series, up to this volume, was a collection of very admirable treatises on English law.&lt;ref&gt;J H B, "Book Reviews" (1913) 26 ''Harvard Law Review'' 563 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1326951 JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Second, third and fourth editions==
The second edition was published in 37 volumes from 1932 to 1941. The editor-in-chief was [[Douglas Hogg, 1st Viscount Hailsham|Viscount Hailsham]]. The managing editor was Sir [[Roland Burrows]].&lt;ref&gt;''Halsbury's Laws of England''. Third Edition. Volume 1. Page 12.&lt;/ref&gt; The second edition of volume 5 was published in 1949.&lt;ref name="Leslie F Maxwell 1957. Page 152"/&gt; The second and subsequent editions of the encyclopaedia took the name of the said Earl of Halsbury.

The third edition was published in 43 volumes from 1952 to 1964. The general editor was [[Gavin Simonds, 1st Viscount Simonds|Lord Simonds]].

The fourth edition was published in 56 volumes from 1973 to 1987. The editor-in-chief was [[Quintin Hogg, Baron Hailsham of St Marylebone|Lord Hailsham of St Marylebone]]. The editor-in-chief of volumes reissued from August 1998 onwards was [[James Mackay, Baron Mackay of Clashfern|Lord Mackay of Clashfern]].

==Fifth edition==
Publication of the fifth edition began in 2008 and is being published in 103 volumes. It will have a new title scheme, a new updating service, and improved integration of European law. New titles for the fifth edition include, ''Sports Law'', ''Information Technology Law'', ''Financial Services and Institutions'', ''Judicial Review'' and ''Environmental Quality and Public Health''.&lt;ref name="lexisnexis.co.uk"/&gt;

==Halsbury Legal Awards==
The Halsbury Legal Awards debuted in 2013.  They celebrate the value that people in law bring to society. The theme of the awards is: "The Whole of the law. Connected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lexisnexis.co.uk/media/press-release.aspx?id=135176160380248|title=Press Releases|website=Lexisnexis.co.uk|accessdate=18 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The awards recognise the achievements and talents of individuals and teams across the entire legal sector. The Bar, legal practice, in-house counsel, academia and legal journalism are all recognised, as are contribution to the promotion, growth and value of the sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.halsburylegalawards.co.uk/|title=The Halsbury Legal Awards 2016|website=Halsburylegalawards.co.uk|accessdate=18 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Halsbury Awards==
The Halsbury Awards, in association with the [[British and Irish Association of Law Librarians]], were sponsored by Halsbury's Laws from 2007-2012. They recognise outstanding performance given by legal information services, law libraries and teams managing legal collections and resources.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20091105043338/http://www.biall.org.uk/pages/halsburys-awards.html] &lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27608">{{History of Argentina}}
Ideas and practices of nationality and citizenship in the Republic of [[Argentina]] (and before that, in the [[Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata]] and the [[Inca]] Empire) have changed with distinct periods of its history, including but not limited to periods of indigenous, colonial, republican, and military rule. 

These periods, in which political rights were often denied to both citizens and non-citizens, encouraged the development of resistance movements. This history of resistance and fighting for political rights is deeply imbedded in the modern Argentine notion of citizenship.

== Inca nationality ==
The [[Inca]] Empire was a conglomeration of conquered ethnic groups - ''etnías'' - ruled by ethnic Inca from the Cuzco-Lake Titicaca Basin in what is now central Peru. They called their empire ''Tiwantinsuyu,'' meaning "four corners." Modern northern and western Argentina was a part of Kollasuyu.&lt;ref name="Daltroy"&gt;D'Altroy, Terence N. ''The Incas.'' Oxford: Blackwell Publishing, 2003 (87-88).&lt;/ref&gt; The Inca elite imposed their own institutions on conquered territories, while at the same time incorporating local customs on a case-by-case basis. Because the Argentine portion of Kollasuyu was on the edge of the empire the communities there had even more local autonomy than elsewhere in the empire, but were still subject to Inca protection and duties through the [[Mita (Inca)|mita]] system of reciprocity. At the same time, Inca statebuilding was based on the threat of violence.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, Craig. “Inka Strategies of Incorporation and Governance.” In Archaic States, ed. Gary m. Feinman and Joycee Marcus, pp293-309. School of American Research, Santa Fe, New Mexico.&lt;/ref&gt; 
This interplay of threat and promise, combined with the ethnic diversity of the conquered groups, created an Inca citizenship that was not ethnic but territorial and administrative, and based on a reciprocal relationship of rights and duties. Though citizens were ultimately loyal to their particular ''etnías'' and communities ([[ayllu]]s), the Inca Empire's formal structures were a clear and unifying presence, even at its edges.

===Mita===
{{Main|Mita (Inca)}}
The Inca state functioned through a complex system of labour extraction and tribute which consolidated their power over conquered regions. This tribute always took the form of people and their time, and was couched in kinship terms.
Censuses were conducted using the [[quipu]], and individual ethnic groups were assigned unique goods and public services to provide as their tax. In return, citizens received immediate rewards (like feasts), as well as the promise that their [[ayllu]]s would be provided  protection from enemies and food if, for example, their harvests failed.&lt;ref&gt;D'Altroy, 268/280.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other expressions of Inca presence===
* The spoken language of [[Quechua languages|Quechua]] was the official spoken language of all governance (the Inca had no written language), and became a symbol of Inca presence through contact with officials and the renaming of local landmarks.&lt;ref&gt;D'Altroy, 47-48.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Imperial, administrative titles were given to local officials and ethnic/[[ayllu]] leaders, thus incorporating them into the empire's broader, administrative structure.&lt;ref&gt;D'Altroy, 177.&lt;/ref&gt;
* As mentioned, the Inca conducted detailed censuses using the [[quipu]]. Inclusion on the census made one, officially, an Inca subject.&lt;ref&gt;D'Altroy, 234-235.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Inca resettled conquered peoples for a variety of administrative reasons. Often, the moving of these ''mitmaqkuna'' settlers was purely an expression of power over newly conquered subjects.&lt;ref&gt;D'Altroy, 248.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Colonisation and the Viceroyalty ==
After being colonised by the Spanish, Argentina was made part of the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]]. In 1776 it became part of the new, and ultimately short-lived, [[Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata]]. Throughout Spanish America, citizenship was both a legal and a social status that was implicit rather than formal, and largely informed by one's racial and class background. As in the Inca Empire, the colonising power's concepts were combined with the unique dictates of the situation in the colony itself.

===Vecindad===
{{Main|Vecino}}
''Vecino'' was the blanket term for community member in Spain and colonial and independent Spanish America, and is rather more extensive than the modern "citizen", implying ownership of property and respectability. The criteria for being a ''vecino'' were never defined in legislation, but rather conceived of as a natural, general rule.&lt;ref&gt;Herzog, Tamar. ''Defining Nations: Immigrants and Citizens in Early Modern Spain and Spanish America." New Haven &amp; London: Yale University Press, 2003, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a nuanced, personal status directly related to a person's standing within the community. Shaped by the conditions in the colony, the term took on a broader meaning in the Americas than it had in Spain itself, where citizenship and nationality were not concerns for most, and where the racial makeup was more homogenous.

===Naturaleza===
''Naturaleza,'' meaning "naturaleness" or "nativeness," was a second term for citizenship in Spain and Spanish America. It usually applied to "natives of the kingdoms of Spain," and was more closely linked to the Crown and subjecthood.&lt;ref&gt;Herzog, "Defining Nations," 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Like ''vecindad,'' ''naturaleza'' was never clearly defined in the law, and took on a broader meaning than in Spain itself.

=== Casta system ===
The [[Casta]] system of racial classification was the foundation of social order, and thus rights, throughout Spanish America.

[[Peninsulares]], [[Criollo (people)]]s, ''Indios'', and the growing group of mixed-race inhabitants (usually [[mestizos]]) all had different citizenship rights. ''Peninsulares'' had the full rights and privileges of ''naturaleza,'' and were the most esteemed in society and therefore were the ideal ''vecinos.'' ''Criollos'' were the most common in Buenos Aires, and were ''naturales'' and ''vecinos'' too, though with an implicitly lower status. ''Indios'' and ''mestizos'' were, initially, excluded from citizenship status entirely.&lt;ref&gt;Herzog, "Defining Nations," 54.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Immigration and the foreigner ===
The presence of non-Spanish Europeans in the Viceroyalties of Peru and Rio de La Plata was, officially, illegal. Though “insiders” and “outsiders” were not explicitly defined in the viceroyalties, Spanish law did differentiate between the two by granting privileges only to those considered members of the community. Because the concept of ‘community’ itself was poorly, if at all defined, non-members were deemed to be so on a case-by-case basis, based on community opinion and, where available, on precedent.
In order to become a member of the community, an outsider usually needed to prove that he was born in the territory, and culturally Spanish (Spanish speaking and writing, Catholic, etc.). In this way Spanish America tended towards jus soli (right by birthplace). Foreigners could apply to the ''audiencia'' for a license to remain in the viceroyalty, or they could apply to the Crown (through the [[Council of the Indies]]  for naturalization. The former did not grant the foreigner any rights, while the latter ''carta de naturaleza'' granted most rights afforded to other members (with some exceptions, including the right to own and operate a business).
Obtaining the  ''carta de naturaleza'' was a lengthier process requiring more proof of cultural Spanishness, and usually a monetary payment to a Crown office or official. It was considered a personal grant, and therefore a personal relationship with a Crown official was invaluable.
&lt;ref&gt;Herzog, Tamar. “’A Stranger in a Strange Land’: The Conversion of Foreigners into Members in Colonial Latin America,” in ''Constructing collective identities and shaping public spheres: Latin American paths.'' Portland: Sussex Academic Press, 1998, pp.45-65.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early Buenos Aires===
Colonial [[Buenos Aires]] was a relatively small frontier settlement threatened by the indigenous and Portuguese presence in the area, which gave the city's residents an especially acute sense of their Spanishness. To this end, city officials only allowed "natives of the kingdoms of Spain" (''naturales'') to become citizens. Only foreigners who could provide a useful service to the city and who were considered culturally Spanish were granted the status. These individuals were almost always of non-Spanish European ancestry, and where rarely (if ever) indigenous or African.&lt;ref&gt;Herzog, "Defining Nations," 49-50.&lt;/ref&gt; 
In the 1610s, an oath for citizenship candidates was created that required them to possess a house and arms; however, the number of applicants dropped in subsequent years and the oath fell out of use.&lt;ref&gt;Herzog, "Defining Nations," 50.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Indians===
By the eighteenth century, Indians were receiving citizenship statuses of their own. Initially classified as members of indigenous communities by birth, this status helped determine their labour ([[repartimiento]]) and taxation (''tributo'') duties to the Crown.  Still, the terms ''vecino'' and ''naturaleza'' were never officially applied.&lt;ref&gt;Herzog, "Defining Nations," 61.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criollo versus Peninsular===
The implicit valuing of ''peninsulares'' over ''criollos'' in Spanish America was a key point of contention in the debates over independence, particularly in the highly-literate city of Buenos Aires. Though they legally belonged to the same kingdom as ''naturalezas'', only ''criollos'' had been born in the Americas (as ''vecinos''), and thus felt that they had a unique claim to the land, its administration, and the rights that would follow.&lt;ref&gt;Herzog, "Defining Nations," 148-149.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Independence  and the new Republic ==
The Independence movement in Argentina was primarily ''criollo'' movement, and thus the citizenship laws made in its aftermath primarily affected the ''criollo'' population.
( A notable exception: The [[Asamblea del Año XIII]], or Assembly of 1813, precursed the official [[Argentine Declaration of Independence]] in July 1816, but is the republic's first attempt at a constitution. Though the delegates could not agree on many major points, [[Freedom of Wombs]] was declared, giving freedom and citizenship to slaves' children born within the territory. It also states that the Argentine Indians were ruled by the Pampas in the 1800s.)

=== Generation of 1830 ===
Led by [[Domingo Faustino Sarmiento]], [[Juan Bautista Alberdi]], and [[Esteban Echeverria]] in response to the [[Juan Manuel de Rosas|Rosas]] administration, the Generation of 1830 proposed a new, modern Argentina built on economic partnerships with Europe and European immigrants. Sarmiento’s “civilization or barbarism” and Alberdi’s “civil liberty for all, political liberty for a few” and "to rule is to populate" characterize the society they envisioned – one of order and progress, in which those qualified to run the state were men of European intellectual tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Spektorowski, Alberto. “Collective Identity and Democratic Construction: The Cases of Argentina and Uruguay,” in ''Constructing collective identities and shaping public spheres: Latin American paths''. Portland: Sussex Academic Press, 1998, pp. 103-122.&lt;/ref&gt; This more elitist approach to governance effectively proposed two tiers of citizenship.

=== Exclusion in the “New Country” ===
No matter how close economic and cultural ties were (or were desired to be) with Europe, political discourse in the mid-nineteenth century up to Peronism after the Second World War made Europeans the counterpoint “other” to Argentine collective identity. Argentina was developing on the same economically liberal  model as European powers (particularly Spain, Britain, and France), but improving on it.&lt;ref&gt;Waisman, Carlos H. “The Dynamics of National Identity Frames,” in ''Constructing collective identities and shaping public spheres: Latin American paths''. Portland: Sussex Academic Press, 1998, pp. 147-167.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Constitution of 1853 ===
The [[Argentine Constitution of 1853]], the new republic's first constitution, does not contain any explicit references to citizenship, though as a product of its framers liberal thought it is very universalist in spirit, speaking of broad, universal rights that apply to all men. This contrasts with the practice of ''vecindad'', which is by nature individual and nuanced.

==Immigration in the Nineteenth and Early Twentieth Centuries==
{{See also|Immigration to Argentina}}

The Constitution of 1853 did include a clause regarding immigration: 

{{quote|The Federal Government shall foster European immigration; and may not restrict, limit or burden with any tax whatsoever, the entry into the Argentine territory of foreigners who arrive for the purpose of tilling the soil, improving industries, and introducing and teaching arts and sciences.|&lt;ref&gt;Section 25, Constitution of the Argentine Nation, {{cite web|url=http://www.argentina.gov.ar/argentina/portal/documentos/constitucion_ingles.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-07-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111129222250/http://www.argentina.gov.ar/argentina/portal/documentos/constitucion_ingles.pdf |archivedate=2011-11-29 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This clause reflects the Generation of 1830's immigration policies. European immigrants, particularly those from developed Northern European countries, were meant to have a civilizing and modernizing effect on Argentine society, and to forge a new Argentine identity based on hard work, merit, and economic progress.

===Populating the Interior===
Along with changing the demographic makeup of the country by increasing the number of Europeans, the immigration drives of the nineteenth and early twentieth century were meant to populate the Argentine interior which was, to this point{{Clarify|date=November 2009}}, largely undeveloped.

These two aims - Europeanization and population of the interior - combined in the [[Conquest of the Desert]], where the remaining indigenous groups of the [[pampas]], [[Andes]] valleys, and [[Patagonia]] were driven out or killed to make room for immigrant farmers. The indigenous were considered a problem, and not true Argentines in the new vision, and therefore had no citizenship rights in the first place.

===Immigration Law===
* ''Ley de Desembarco'' (Law of Disembarkment), 1872 – Containing the first legal definition of ‘immigrant,’ the law allowed inspection of ships to prevent the entry of those ill or otherwise unable to work. The bill did not pass the Committee on Legislation, but was reworked and included in an 1876 law after an outbreak of yellow fever on an immigrant ship spread throughout Buenos Aires.&lt;ref&gt;Castro, Donald S. The Development and Politics of Argentine Immigration Policy 1852-1914: To Govern Is To Populate. San Francisco: Mellen Research University Press, 1991: 80-81.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Ley de Residencia'' (Law of Residence), 1902 - Legalised the expulsion of immigrants who "compromise national security or disturb public order."
*''Ley de Seguridad Social'' (Law of Social Security), 1910 – This law provided for the expulsion of anarchists and persons convicted of capital crimes in Argentina. It was also established for ship captains who allowed passengers to violate the law. It represents a further backlash against the immigration population.&lt;ref&gt;Castro, 250-251.&lt;/ref&gt; Membership in the Argentine nation was still contingent on being useful to it.

== Perón and a new collective identity==
[[Juan Peron|Juan Perón]]’s populist, participatory government encouraged a greater link between subject and state. His vision was inclusive and collective, based on the idea that all of Argentina needed to be involved in the project of national development. Ethnic, racial, or other national identities were made secondary to the new collective Argentine identity. He was the first to frame Argentine citizenship in terms of political rights, rather than community membership.&lt;ref&gt;Senkman, Leonardo. “The Transformation of Collective Identities: Immigrant Communities under the Populist Regimes Vargas and Peron,” in ''Constructing collective identities and shaping public spheres: Latin American paths''. Portland: Sussex Academic Press, 1998, pp. 123-145.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Enfranchisement and political participation===
Peron, with the influence of his wife [[Eva Peron]] (Evita), officially enfranchised women and involved the lower classes, particularly workers, in national politics for the first time. Through their social welfare programs, Peron and Evita became father and mother figures for the Argentine masses, building a collective national identity instead of a country of sovereign individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Lucy. Citizenship, Participation and Democracy: Changing Dynamics in Chile and Argentina. New York: St Martin’s Press, 1998: 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Building the collective identity===
Peron built his new Argentine identity around its Hispanic and creole roots and the concept of the ''Madre Patria'' (motherland) to which one is always, and ultimately, loyal. Later, this Hispanic tradition was replaced by a Latin one in order to incorporate the large Italian immigrant community. Public holidays like the ‘’Día de la Raza’’ and new school textbooks glorified the conquest.

He also encouraged immigrant and minority groups, especially Jews, to participate in public life through labour unions, officially recognized cultural associations and wings of political parties.&lt;ref&gt;Senkman, 123-145.&lt;/ref&gt;

Peron's initially successful economic policy of [[Import substitution industrialization]] (ISI) also fostered national pride and a sense of independence.

== Guerra Sucia and Military Rule==
The military juntas and the [[Dirty War|Guerra Sucia]] which followed Peron were exceptionally repressive, and the systematic targeting of ordinary citizens created a climate of fear and silence that was the opposite of the mass political participation of the Peron era. Still, they too built their governments around concepts of Argentine identity. The juntas attacked Peronism as a threat to the true capitalist Argentine values, conceiving a more, individualist, and exclusive model of citizenship&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, 44.&lt;/ref&gt; in which only the qualified had the right to rule, and all others must trust their decisions. The collective Argentine identity was replaced with a more individualist, favour-based model, where the citizen's role was in service of the state rather than vice versa&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, 35 &amp; 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social movements===
Though freedom of expression was nonexistent under the juntas and dissent was a punishable offence, a strong social movement grew out of the military rule. Though each group had its own concerns, most used the rhetoric of citizenship to fight for a return of their political rights. These human rights groups were eventually joined by women's groups and trade unions in early 1982, beginning the return to democracy and civilian rule.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, 50-51&lt;/ref&gt; By voicing their concerns in terms of citizenship rights, the dissent movement refashioned the model of the Argentine citizen into one of an active participator with high expectations, willing to make demands of his or her government.

== Present day ==
Present day Argentine citizenship law is derived, in the most part, from the National Constitution. Until recently, in 1994, the document did not contain any definition of citizenship and the related rights; instead, clauses were worded in terms of "residents" and "the people." The 'New Rights and Guarantees' section added in 1994 was a reaction to authoritarian rule, and clearly regulates Argentine political rights; however, the Constitution still does not contain a definition of citizenship itself.

=== Relevant sections of the Constitution ===
{{quote|The citizens of each province shall be entitled to all rights, privileges, and immunities inherent in the condition of citizen in the other provinces...|&lt;ref name="Constitution"&gt;Constitution of the Argentine Nation, {{cite web|url=http://www.argentina.gov.ar/argentina/portal/documentos/constitucion_ingles.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-07-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111129222250/http://www.argentina.gov.ar/argentina/portal/documentos/constitucion_ingles.pdf |archivedate=2011-11-29 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
In this way, Argentina's federal system uses a version of the principle of [[comity]] to uphold provinces' rights, while still maintaining that Argentine citizenship is a national, pan-provincial status.
{{quote|All the inhabitants of the Nation have the following rights according to the laws that rule their enforcement; namely: to work and run any legal industry; sell and trade; demand authorities; get in, stay, traverse and go out of the Argentine territory; make ideas public through the press with no prior censorship; use and dictate about own real estate; entire into associations with meaningful purposes; practice religion freely; teach and learn.|&lt;ref name="Constitution"/&gt;}}
*'''Section 14bis''' also includes a provision granting the benefits of social security, "which shall be of an integral nature and may not be waived."&lt;ref name="Constitution"/&gt;
Argentina extends its civil rights to "all inhabitants" of the Nation, not just those with full citizenship status. (see "section 20" below) This provision was added in 1957, with the state taking responsibility for its inhabitants' well-being.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, 65.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|The Argentine Nation admits neither blood nor birth prerogatives: there are neither personal privileges nor titles of nobility. All its inhabitants are equal before the law, and admissible to employment without any other requirement than their ability. Equality is the basis of taxation and public burdens.|&lt;ref name="Constitution"/&gt;}}
This section is a reaction to Spanish colonial rule, under which an individual's legal and practical rights were determined by their blood (both in terms of race and nobility).
The stipulation that "equality is the basis of taxation and public burdens" reflects that, in practice, Argentine citizenship flows from both rights and duties.
{{quote|Foreigners enjoy within the territory of the Nation all the civil rights of citizens... They are not obliged to accept citizenship nor to pay extraordinary compulsory taxes. They may obtain naturalization papers residing two uninterrupted years in the Nation; but the authorities may shorten this term in favor of those so requesting it, alleging and proving services rendered to the Republic.&lt;ref name="Constitution"/&gt;}}
{{quote|Suffrage shall be universal, equal, secret and compulsory...}}

=== Citizenship ===
The valid laws governing citizenship (Ley 346, Ley 23.059, and Decreto 3.213/84) set forth very simple requirements:

(1) to be 18 years old;

(2) to have been living in Argentina for 2 years; and

(3) to apply for citizenship before a federal judge.

And it can be denied if you:

(1) have been in jail for more than 3 year in the last 5 years;

(2) are under criminal prosecution;

(3) do not have an honest way of income. To work without a legal permit is considered an honest way of living.

Due to the fact that the citizenship law has existed unchanged since 1869 in its present form, the Supreme Court have issued many precedents on which there is a solution to almost every immigration situation an immigrant might face. Citizenship has been granted to immigrants who lacked legal residency or entered the country illegally, or even to immigrants with criminal records in exceptional cases.

Recently, the Federal Chamber of Parana established that illegals doesn't exist in Argentina. Illegality is regarding actions that violates the criminal law. The violation of the immigration law is a simple administrative issue that can be healed applying for residency or citizenship.

The continuous 2 years means that you have your home in this country. Foreigners have the same civil rights than Argentines, among others, to travel. It means that the continuity of the 2 years doesn't mean that the solicitant cannot leave the country.

For historic reasons, federal courts are still reluctant to recognize the rights of ¨irregular¨ immigrants, They usually request the following requirements related to the abolished law 21.795 (enacted in 1978 by Dictator Jorge Rafael Videla, was abolished in 1984 and Law 346 re-enacted):

(1) Legal residency (2) Legal work (3) That you speak, read and write Spanish (4) That you renounce your native citizenship (5) DNI with permanent residency (6) Birth certificate apostilled and translated by public notary (7) Certificate of a clean criminal record from your home country (8) Certificate of a clean criminal record in Argentina (9) CUIT or CUIL number

=== Documento Nacional de Identidad ===
The DNI is Argentina's Documento Nacional de Identidad, or National Identity Document. It is a small book of personal information that includes a unique number, used to obtain social services, to vote, in renting, opening bank accounts, etc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mininterior.gov.ar/renaper/instructivo_nacionales.asp "Instructivos par documentación" Ministerio del Interior] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071022031600/http://www.mininterior.gov.ar/renaper/instructivo_nacionales.asp |date=2007-10-22 }} {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New residents are legally required to obtain a DNI within 90 days of arrival.&lt;ref&gt;"To reside in Argentina," {{cite web |url=http://www.mininterior.gov.ar/renaper/instructivo_nacionales.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-10-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071022031600/http://www.mininterior.gov.ar/renaper/instructivo_nacionales.asp |archivedate=2007-10-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Elections ===
As mentioned in Section 37, Argentina enforces [[compulsory voting]] - it is both a right and a duty.

Though non-citizens cannot vote in federal elections, some provinces allow non-citizen residents (those with DNIs) to vote in provincial and/or municipal elections:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mininterior.gov.ar/elecciones/electores/voto_ce.asp Dirección Nacional Electoral, Electores] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071024144157/http://www.mininterior.gov.ar/elecciones/electores/voto_ce.asp |date=2007-10-24 }} {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Buenos Aires (province)]] - provincial and municipal
*[[Buenos Aires]] (city)-  local only
*[[Catamarca Province|Catamarca]] - municipal only, with DNI and four years' residence in Catamarca and having registered with the municipal authorities as a foreign voter
*[[Misiones]] - provincial and municipal, having registered specially with and obtained a voters' card from the provincial authorities
*[[Neuquén]] - provincial and municipal, having registered specially with provincial authorities
*[[Santa Fe, Argentina|Santa Fe]] - municipal intendents and councilpersons only, having registered specially with municipal and provincial authorities

'''Intensive pig farming''' is a subset of [[pig farming]] and of [[Intensive animal farming|Industrial animal agriculture]], all of which are types of [[animal husbandry]], in which [[livestock]] [[domestic pig]]s are raised up to slaughter weight.  These operations are known as [[Animal feeding operation|AFO]] or [[Concentrated Animal Feeding Operation|CAFO]] in the U.S.  In this system of pig production, grower pigs are housed indoors in group-housing or straw-lined sheds, whilst pregnant sows are housed in [[gestation crate]]s or pens and give birth in farrowing crates.

The use of gestation crates for pregnant sows has resulted in lower birth production costs; however, this practice has led to more significant [[Cruelty to animals|animal cruelty]].  Many of the world’s largest producers of pigs ([[United States|US]],  [[China]], [[Mexico]]) use gestation crates but some nations and nine US states have banned and removed these crates. The [[European Union]] has banned the use of gestation crates after the 4th week of pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Werblow|first1=Steve|title=Gestation crates: News from the front lines|url=http://www.porknetwork.com/pork-magazine/Gestation-crates-News-from-the-front-lines-242240401.html|accessdate=3 October 2015|publisher=Pork Network|date=27 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
{{Farming}}
Intensive piggeries are generally large warehouse-like buildings or barns.  Indoor pig systems allow the pigs' conditions to be monitored, ensuring minimum fatalities and increased productivity. Buildings are ventilated and their temperature regulated.  Most domestic pig varieties are susceptible to sunburn and heat stress, and all pigs lack sweat glands and cannot cool themselves. Pigs have a limited tolerance to high temperatures and heat stress can lead to death.  Maintaining a more specific temperature within the pig-tolerance range also maximizes growth and growth-to-feed ratio.  Indoor piggeries have allowed pig farming to be undertaken in countries or areas with unsuitable climate or soil for outdoor pig raising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.australianpork.com.au/index.cfm?menuid=31E2978C-B0D0-36D2-5CD946CD05CCD5DE|title=Australian pork page on Pig welfare|website=Australainpork.com.au|accessdate=28 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In an intensive operation, pigs will no longer need access to a wallow (mud), which is their natural cooling mechanism.  Intensive piggeries control temperature through ventilation or drip water systems.

Pigs are naturally omnivorous and are generally fed a combination of grains and protein sources (soybeans, or [[meat and bone meal]]).  Larger intensive pig farms may be surrounded by farmland where feed-grain crops are grown.  Consequently, piggeries are reliant on the grains industry.  Pig feed may be bought packaged, in bulk or mixed on-site.  The intensive piggery system, where pigs are confined in individual stalls, allows each pig to be allotted a portion of feed.   The individual feeding system also facilitates individual medication of pigs through feed. This has more significance to intensive farming methods, as the proximity to other animals enables diseases to spread more rapidly. To prevent disease spreading and encourage growth, drug programs such as [[vitamins]] and [[Subtherapeutic antibiotic use in swine|antibiotic]]s are administered preemptively.

Indoor systems allow for the easy collection of waste. In an indoor intensive pig farm, manure can be managed through a [[anaerobic lagoon|lagoon system]] or other waste-management system. However, waste smell remains a problem which is difficult to manage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |url=http://asae.frymulti.com/abstract.asp?aid=15521&amp;t=2 |title=Spatial Variability Of Odor Emissions From Anaerobic Piggery Lagoons In Queensland |author1=G.

The way animals are housed in intensive systems varies.  Breeding sows will spend the bulk of their time in [[gestation crate]]s during pregnancy. The use of these crates may be preferred as they facilitate feed management and growth control and prevent pig aggression. Sows are moved to farrowing crates, with litter, from before farrowing until weaning, to ease management of farrowing and reduce piglet loss from sows lying on them.  Dry or open time for sows can be spent in indoor pens or outdoor pens or pastures. Houses should be clean and well ventilated but draught-free.

Piglets can be subjected to castration, tail [[Docking (animal)|docking]] to prevent [[Tail biting in pigs|tail biting]], teeth clipping, and [[earmark (agriculture)|earmarking]] and tattooing for litter identification.  Treatments are usually made without any pain killers.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}  Weak [[runt]]s could be killed shortly after birth.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}  Injections with a high availability iron solution often are given, as [[pig milk|sow's milk]] is low in iron. The docking due to tail biting is a common practice in intensive rearing facilities as animals in that environment are more prone to increased levels of aggression and instability.&lt;ref&gt;EFSA. Scientific Opinion of the Panel on Animal Health and Welfare (Question No EFSA-Q-2006-013)  Adopted on 6 December 2007 [https://efsa.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2903/j.efsa.2007.611 The risks associated with tail biting in pigs and possible means to reduce the need for tail docking considering the different housing and husbandry systems] Efsa.europa.eu&lt;/ref&gt;

Piglets are [[wean]]ed and removed from the sows at between two and five weeks old&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nationalhogfarmer.com/mag/farming_revisiting_weaning_age/|title=Revisiting Weaning Age Trends, Dynamics|date=15 October 2005|website=Nationalhogfarmer.com|accessdate=28 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and placed in sheds, nursery barns or directly to growout barns. Grower pigs are usually housed in alternative indoor housing, such as batch pens. Group pens generally require higher stockmanship skills.  Such pens will usually not contain straw or other material.  Alternatively, a straw-lined shed may house a larger group in age groups.  Larger swine operations use slotted floors for waste removal, and deliver bulk feed into feeders in each pen; feed is available ad libitum.

==Environmental impacts==
{{main|Enviromental impact of intensive pig farming}}
==Regulation==
Many countries have introduced laws to regulate treatment of farmed animals.

===EU===
As of 2016, The European Union legislation has required that pigs be given environmental enrichment, specifically they must have permanent access to a sufficient quantity of material to enable proper investigation and manipulation activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32016H0336|title=COMMISSION RECOMMENDATION (EU) 2016/336|website=http://eur-lex.europa.eu|accessdate=11 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the legislation tail docking may only be used as a last resort. The law provides that farmers must first take measures to improve the pigs’ conditions and, only where these have failed to prevent tail biting, may they tail dock.&lt;ref name=ciwf08&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ciwf.org.uk/resources/publications/pig_farming/default.aspx|title=Species: pigs - Compassion in World Farming|website=Ciwf.org.uk|accessdate=28 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
Nine states have banned the use of gestation crates, with Rhode Island being the most recent as of July 2012.&lt;ref&gt;Marcelo, Philip. [http://news.providencejournal.com/breaking-news/2012/06/new-ri-law-bans.html New R.I. law bans cutting dairy-cow tails, raising pigs and calves in crates] ''Providence Journal'', June 21, 2012. Accessed July 31, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Discharge from CAFOs is regulated by the federal [[Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA). In 2003, the EPA revised the [[Clean Water Act]] to include permitting requirements and effluent (discharge) limitations for CAFOs.  In 2008, final AFO/CAFO regulation revised portions of it under EPA’s National Point Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permitting program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.epa.gov/npdes/regulations/cafo_final_rule_preamble2008.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-04-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090509223658/http://www.epa.gov/npdes/regulations/cafo_final_rule_preamble2008.pdf |archivedate=2009-05-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The federal [[Humane Slaughter Act]] requires pigs to be stunned before slaughter, although compliance and enforcement is questioned.  There is concern from animal liberation/welfare groups that the laws have not resulted in a prevention of animal suffering and that there are "repeated violations of the Humane Slaughter Act at dozens of [[slaughterhouses]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awionline.org/pubs/Quarterly/summer2001/hsaintroduced.htm|title=Animal Welfare Institute Quarterly – Humane Slaughter Act Resolution Introduced|website=Awionline.org|accessdate=28 July 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303193545/http://www.awionline.org/pubs/Quarterly/summer2001/hsaintroduced.htm|archivedate=3 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism ==
[[Image:Gestcrate01.jpg|thumb|250px|[[pig|Sow]]s are often confined in [[gestation crate]]s, which usually does not allow the pig to turn around or lay down comfortably. Confinement farming methods have come under increasing public scrutiny due to [[animal welfare]] and [[Environmentalism|environmental]] concerns.]]

===Dispute regarding farming methods===
Intensive piggeries have been increasingly{{when|date=July 2017}} criticized in preference of [[free range]] systems. Such systems usually refer not to a group-pen or shedding system, but to outdoor farming systems. Those that support outdoor systems usually do so on the grounds that they are more animal friendly and allow pigs to experience natural activities (e.g., wallowing in mud, relating to young, rooting soil). Outdoor systems are usually less economically productive due to increased space requirements and higher morbidity, (though, when dealing with the killing of piglets and other groups of swine, the methods are the same.)  They also have a range of environmental impacts, such as [[denitrification]] of soil&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edpsciences.org/articles/agro/pdf/2002/07/19.pdf|title=The fate of nitrogen in outdoor pig production|website=Edpsciences.org|accessdate=28 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kursus.kvl.dk/shares/ea/03Projects/32gamle/_2002/pig%20farming.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-12-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080625192517/http://www.kursus.kvl.dk/shares/ea/03Projects/32gamle/_2002/pig%20farming.pdf |archivedate=2008-06-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and erosion.  Outdoor pig farming may also have welfare implications, for example, pigs kept outside may get sunburnt and are more susceptible to heat stress than in indoor systems, where air conditioning or similar can be used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.depts.ttu.edu/porkindustryinstitute/research/MANAGING%20HEAT%20STRESS%20IN%20OUTDOOR%20PIGS.htm|title=Managing Heat Stress in Outdoor pigs|website=Depts.ttu.edu|accessdate=28 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thepigsite.com/articles/5/housing-and-environment/669/heat-stress-index-chart-for-swine-producers|title=Heat stress index chart for swine producers|website=Thepigsite.com|accessdate=28 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Outdoor pig farming may also increase the incidence of worms and parasites in pigs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0020-7519(97)00022-2 |vauthors=Roepstorff A, Murrell KD |title=Transmission dynamics of helminth parasites of pigs on continuous pasture: ''Ascaris suum'' and ''Trichuris suis'' |journal=Int. J. Parasitol. |volume=27 |issue=5 |pages=563–72 |date=May 1997 |pmid=9193950 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0020-7519(97)00022-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thepigsite.com/pighealth/article/411/management-control-and-prevention|title=Management Control and Prevention - Managing Pig Health and Treating Pig Dieases on ThePigSite.com|website=The Pig Site|accessdate=28 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Management of these problems depends on local conditions, such as geography, climate, and the availability of skilled staff.

Transition of an indoor production system to an outdoor system may present obstacles.  Some breeds of pig commonly used in intensive farming have been selectively bred to suit intensive conditions.  Lean pink-pigmented pigs are unsuited for outdoor agriculture, as they suffer sunburn and heat stress.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}  In certain environmental conditions – for example, a temperate climate – outdoor pig farming of these breeds is possible. However, there are many other breeds of pig suited to outdoor rearing, as they have been used in this way for centuries, such as [[Gloucester Old Spot]] and [[Oxford Forest]]. Following the [[UK]] ban of sow stalls, the British Pig Executive indicates that the pig farming industry in the UK has declined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bpex.org/technical/general/pdf/marketupdate-sept05.pdf|title=British Pig Executive market update September 2005|website=Bpex.org|accessdate=28 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The increase in production costs&lt;ref&gt;[http://farmfutures.com/story.aspx/another-move-away-pork-crates-/25/59594 "Another Move Away from Pork Crates,"] Farm Futures, May 8, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; has led to British pig-products being more expensive than those from other countries, leading to increased imports and the need to position UK pork as a product deserving a price premium.

In 1997, [[Grampian Country Foods]], then the UK’s largest pig producer, pointed out that pigmeat production costs in the UK were 44 p/kg higher than on the continent. Grampian stated that only 2 p/kg of this was due to the ban on stalls; the majority of the extra costs resulted from the then strength of sterling and the fact that at that time meat and bone meal had been banned in the UK but not on the continent. A study by the Meat and Livestock Commission in 1999, the year that the gestation crate ban came into force, found that moving from gestation crates, to group housing added just 1.6 pence to the cost of producing 1&amp;nbsp;kg of pigmeat. French and Dutch studies show that even in the higher welfare group housing systems – ones giving more space and straw – a kg of pigmeat costs less than 2 pence more to produce than in gestation crates.&lt;ref name=ciwf08/&gt;

===Sow breeding systems===
Organized campaigns by animal activists have focused on the use of the gestation crate, such as the '[[gestation crate]]' and farrowing crate. The gestation crate has now been banned in the UK, certain US states, and other European countries, although it remains part of pig production in much of the US and European Union.

Only the sows selected for breeding will spend time in a gestation crate.  In an intensive system, the sow will be placed in a crate prior mating and will stay there for at least the start of her pregnancy, when the risk of miscarriage is higher.{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}}  The typical length of the sow's pregnancy is 3 months, 3 weeks, and 3 days.  In certain cases, sows may spend this time in the crate.  However, a variety of farming systems are used and the time in the crate may vary from 4 weeks to the whole pregnancy.

There is also some criticism of 'farrowing crates'.  A farrowing crate houses the sow in one section and her piglets in another.  It allows the sow to lie down and roll over to feed her piglets, but keeps her piglets in a separate section.  This prevents the large sow from sitting on her piglets and killing them, which is quite common where the sow is not separated from the piglets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livestocktrail.illinois.edu/swinerepronet/paperDisplay.cfm?ContentID=6266 “Piglet Losses,”] University of Illinois Extension, November 5, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;  Sows are also prevented from being able to move other than between standing and lying.  Some models of farrowing crates may allow more space than others, and allow greater interaction between sow and young. Well-designed farrowing pens in which the sow has ample space can be just as effective as crates in preventing piglet mortality.&lt;ref name=ciwf08/&gt;  Some crates may also be designed with cost-effectiveness or efficiency in mind and therefore be smaller.

Authoritative industry data indicate that moving from sow stalls to group housing added 2 pence to the cost of producing 1&amp;nbsp;kg. of pigmeat.&lt;ref name=ciwf08/&gt;

Many English fattening pigs are kept in barren conditions and are routinely tail docked. Since 2003 EU legislation has required pigs to be given environmental enrichment and has banned routine tail docking. However, 80% of UK pigs are tail docked.&lt;ref name=ciwf08/&gt;

In 2015, use of sow crates was made illegal on New Zealand pig farms.&lt;ref name="NZ_Herald_10691325"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10691325&amp;ref=facebookheadlines |title=Sow crates to be phased out by 2015 |date=1 December 2010 |newspaper=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=4 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effects on traditional rural communities===
Common criticism of intensive piggeries is that they represent a corporatization of the traditional rural lifestyle.  Critics feel the rise of intensive piggeries has largely replaced family farming.  Between 1982 and 1987 some 21% of [[Iowa]] hog farmers went out of business.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} By 1992, another 12% had gone out of business.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}  In large part, this is because intensive piggeries are more economical than outdoor systems, pen systems, or the [[sty]].  In many pork-producing countries (e.g., [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]], [[Denmark]]) the use of intensive piggeries has led to market rationalization and concentration. ''The New York Times'' reported that keeping pigs and other animals in "unnaturally overcrowded" environments poses considerable health risks for workers, neighbors, and consumers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/20/books/20book.html|title=‘You Know That Chicken Is Chicken, Right?’|first=Michiko|last=Kakutani|date=20 November 2009|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=28 July 2017|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Waste management and public health concerns===
Contaminants from animal wastes can enter the environment through pathways such as through leakage of poorly constructed manure lagoons or during major precipitation events resulting in either overflow of lagoons and runoff from recent applications of waste to farm fields, or atmospheric deposition followed by dry or wet fallout.  Runoff can leach through permeable soils to vulnerable aquifers that tap ground water sources for human consumption.  Runoff of manure can also find its way into surface water such as lakes, streams, and ponds. An example of weather induced runoff having been recently reported in the wake of Hurricane Matthew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/capital-weather-gang/wp/2016/10/16/factory-farming-practices-are-under-scrutiny-again-in-n-c-after-disastrous-hurricane-floods/|title=Factory farming practices are under scrutiny again in N.C. after disastrous hurricane floods|first1=Arelis R. Hernández, Angela|last1=Fritz|first2=Chris|last2=Mooney|first3=Arelis R. Hernández, Angela|last3=Fritz|first4=Chris|last4=Mooney|date=16 October 2016|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|accessdate=28 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many contaminants are present in livestock wastes, including nutrients, pathogens, veterinary pharmaceuticals and naturally excreted hormones. Improper disposal of animal carcasses and abandoned livestock facilities can also contribute to water quality problems in surrounding areas of CAFOs.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

Exposure to waterborne contaminants can result from both recreational use of affected surface water and from ingestion of drinking water derived from either contaminated surface water or ground water.  High-Risk populations are generally the very young, the elderly, pregnant women, and immunocompromised individuals.  Dermal contact may cause skin, eye, or ear infections.  Drinking water exposures to pathogens could occur in vulnerable private wells.&lt;ref&gt;Burkholder JoAnn; Bob Libra, Peter Weyer, Susan Heathcote, Dana Kolpin, Peter S. Thorne, Michael Wichman [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1817674/ Impacts of Waste from Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations on Water Quality]. Environ Health Perspectives. (2007) 115:308–312.&lt;/ref&gt;

At Varkensproefcentrum Sterksel in the Netherlands, a pig farm has been created that reuses its waste streams. CO² and ammonia from the pig manure are reused to grow algae which in turn are used to feed the pigs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://innovatienetwerk.onlinetouch.nl/135/48|title=442 -|website=Innovatienetwek.onlinetouch.nl|accessdate=28 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another method to reduce the effect on the environment is to switch to other breeds of pig. The [[enviropig]] is a genetically modified type of pig with the capability to digest plant phosphorus more efficiently than ordinary pigs, though the enviropig program ended in 2012 and did not reach commercial distribution.

Nutrient-rich runoff from CAFO's can contribute to [[Algal bloom]]s in rivers, lakes and seas. The 2009 [[Harmful Algal Bloom]] event off the coast of [[Brittany|Brittany, France]] was attributed to runoff from an intensive pig farm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Chrisafis|first=Angelique|title=Lethal algae take over beaches in northern France|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/aug/10/france-brittany-coast-seaweed-algae|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=October 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===North Carolina===
As of 2010, North Carolina housed approximately ten million hogs, most of which are located in the eastern half of the state in industrialized [[CAFO]]s or Confined Animal Feeding Operations. This was not the case twenty years ago. The initial [[horizontal integration]] and the [[vertical integration]] that arose in this industry resulted in numerous issues, including issues of environmental disparity, loss of work, [[pollution]], [[animal rights]], and overall general public health. The most remarkable example of swine CAFO monopoly is found in the United States, where in 2001, 50 producers had control over 70% of total pork production. In 2001, the biggest CAFO had just over 710,000 [[Pig|sows]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.engormix.com/MA-pig-industry/management/articles/swine-production-global-perspective-t336/124-p0.htm|title=Swine production: a global perspective|website=En.engormix.com|accessdate=28 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally, Murphy Family Farms [[Horizontal integration|horizontally integrated]] the North Carolina system. They laid the groundwork for the industry to be [[Vertical integration|vertically integrated]]. Today{{when|date=July 2017}} the hog industry in North Carolina is led by [[Smithfield Foods]], which has expanded into both nationwide and international production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Ladd, Anthony |author2=Edwards, Bob |title=Corporate Swine, Capitalist Pigs: A Decade of Environmental Injustice in North Carolina |journal=Social Justice |volume=29 |issue=3 |pages=26–46 |year=2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[environmental justice]] problems in North Carolina's agroindustrialization of swine production seem to stem from the history of the coastal region's economy, which has relied heavily on black and low-income populations to supply the necessary agricultural labor. The industry's shift from family-owned hog farms to factory hogging has contributed to the frequent targeting of these areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Wimberley, Ronald C., Morris, Libbly V. |title=The Southern Black Belt : A National Perspective |publisher=University of Kentucky |location=Lexington |year=1997 |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This swine production and pollution that accompanies factory hogging is concentrated in the parts of North Carolina that have the highest disease rates, the least access to medical care, and the greatest need for positive education and economic development.&lt;ref&gt;Raine J. Environmental Justice Issues of the North Carolina Swine Industry [Masters thesis]. Durham, NC:Duke University, Nicholas School of the Environment, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Since hog production has become consolidated in the coastal region of N.C., the high water tables and low-lying flood plains have increased the risk and impact of hog farm pollution. A swine CAFO is made up of three parts: the hog house, the “lagoon,” and the “spray field.” Waste disposal techniques used by small-scale traditional hog farms, like using waste as [[fertilizer]] for commercially viable crops, were adopted and expanded for use by CAFOs. Lagoons are supposed to be protected with an [[Permeability (earth sciences)|impermeable]] liner, but some do not work properly. This can cause environmental damage, as seen in 1995 when a lagoon burst in North Carolina. This lagoon released 25 million gallons of noxious [[sludge]] into North Carolina’s [[New River (North Carolina)|New River]] and killed approximately eight to ten million fish.&lt;ref&gt;Orlando, Laura. McFarms Go Wild, Dollars and Sense, July/August 1998, cited in Scully, Matthew. Dominion, St. Martin's Griffin, p. 257.&lt;/ref&gt;

The toxins emitted by the swine CAFOs can produce a variety of symptoms and illnesses ranging from respiratory disorders, headaches, and shortness of breath to hydrogen sulfide poisoning, bronchitis, and asthma. The potential for spray field runoff or lagoon leakage puts nearby residents in danger of contaminated drinking water, which can lead to diseases like [[Salmonellosis|samonellosis]], [[giardiasis]], [[Chlamydia infection|Chlamydia]], [[meningitis]], [[cryptosporidiosis]], [[worm]]s, and [[influenza]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Donham K. |chapter=The impact of industrial swine production on human health |veditors=Thu K, Durrenberger E |title=Pigs, Profits, and Rural Communities |publisher=State University of New York Press |location=Albany, NY |year=1998 |isbn= |pages=73–83 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Denmark===
Slaughterhouses and veterinarians are obliged to report pigs with injuries to the [[Danish Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Fisheries|Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Fisheries]], which forwards cases to the police. There were relatively few cases before 2006, but by 2008-9 there were about 300 per year.&lt;ref name=poldk/&gt; When there are visible injuries, it represents not only a problem in animal welfare but also the farmers economy because parts or occasionally the entire carcass has to be discarded.&lt;ref name=poldk/&gt; From 2006 to 2009 the number of pigs with injuries caused by hard objects, such as planks or chains received by slaughterhouses rose significantly. It was possibly related to a system introduced in 2006, which rewards "the rushed loading of animals onto vehicles", as well as a sharp increase in uneducated Eastern European farm workers unaware of Danish laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thepigsite.com/swinenews/22615/alleged-increase-in-pig-cruelty|title=Alleged Increase in Pig Cruelty|website=The Pig Site|accessdate=28 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=poldk&gt;Andreas Lindquist (26 July 2010).

[[Gestation crate]]s were sometimes used on some Danish farms to restrict the movement of sows during pregnancy, as documented by British celebrity chef [[Jamie Oliver]] in a television programme for the UK's [[Channel 4]] in 2009.&lt;ref name=dbmc&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dbmc.co.uk/press%20office/news_bull_display.asp?NEWS_BULLETIN_ID=58 |title=Response to 'Jamie Saves Our Bacon' |accessdate=2009-12-19 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090504110340/http://www.dbmc.co.uk/press%20office/news_bull_display.asp?NEWS_BULLETIN_ID=58 |archivedate=May 4, 2009 |df= }}.

===New Zealand===
According to [[Scoop (news website)|Scoop]], in 2009 the New Zealand [[pork]] industry was "dealt a shameful public relations slap-in-the-face after its former celebrity kingpin, [[Mike King (comedian)|Mike King]], outed their [[farming]] practices as 'brutal', 'callous' and 'evil{{'"}} on a May episode of New Zealand television show ''[[Sunday (New Zealand TV programme)|Sunday]]''. King condemned the "appalling treatment" of factory farmed pigs. King observed conditions inside a New Zealand [[piggery]], and saw a dead female pig inside a gestation crate, lame and crippled pigs and others that could barely stand, pigs either extremely depressed or highly distressed, pigs with scars and injuries, and a lack of clean drinking water and food.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2841">The '''International Institute for the Sociology of Law (IISL)''' in [[Oñati]] is the only international establishment  which is entirely devoted to teaching and promoting the [[sociology of law]], [[Sociology of law|socio-legal studies]], and [[Sociology of law|law and society]] research.

The IISL is a joint venture of the [http://rcsl.iscte.pt/ Research Committee on Sociology of Law] (also known as RC12 of the International Sociological Association) and the government of the Basque autonomous region in Spain. It is situated (since 1989) in the [[University of Oñati]] (the Ancient University of the Basque Country) in Oñati. The founding director of the IISL, André-Jean Arnaud, had bronze plaques put on the walls of the renaissance building with the names of some of the forefathers of modern sociology of law: [[Montesquieu]], [[Henry James Sumner Maine]], [[Francisco Giner de los Ríos]], [[Henri Lévy-Bruhl]], [[Achille Loria]], [[Leon Petrażycki]], [[Émile Durkheim]], [[Max Weber]], [[Eugen Ehrlich]], [[Karl Renner]], [[Karl N. Llewellyn]], [[Theodor Geiger]], [[Georges Gurvitch]], [[Nicholas Timasheff|Nicholas S. Timasheff]].

The IISL has four "official languages": [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Basque language|Basque]]. It houses a famous library/documentation centre covering socio-legal literature in all major and many minor languages. The Institute organises socio-legal workshops and an international Master's Program in the Sociology of Law, including student scholarships. Publications from the workshops are regularly produced in both an English- and Spanish language series, including the Institute's own online peer-reviewed journal (Onati Socio-Legal Series). The IISL is also the host of the World Consortium of Law and Society associations. Applications to host a workshop, residence grants for visitors wishing to use the library, and to study on the Masters programmes are usually due mid-February.

'''Ayatollah Sheikh Isa Ahmed Qassim''' ([[Arabic]]: آية الله الشيخ عيسى أحمد قاسم) is [[Bahrain]]'s leading [[Shia]] cleric and a politician. He is the spiritual leader of [[Al Wefaq]], Bahrain's biggest opposition society. He was the leader and is the founders of [[Islamic Enlightenment institution]].&lt;ref name="Al Wasat 22.10.2010"/&gt;

==Biography==
Isa Qassim was born in 1940 to a fisherman in [[Diraz|Duraz]]. He attended [[Budaiya]] primary school where he was known for his intelligence and it was reported that he always scored the highest marks. After finishing primary school and with his brother's aid he moved to Manama's secondary school. After graduating he worked as a teacher in Budaiya primary school where he remained until 1962.&lt;ref name="Al Wasat 22.10.2010"&gt;{{cite news | author = Wesam Al-Seb'a | url = http://www.alwasatnews.com/2968/news/read/493809/1.html | language=Arabic| title = The religious block in National assembly | publisher = Al-Wasat newspaper | date=22 October 2011 | accessdate=2 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AlBayan 1"&gt;{{cite news | author = [[Staff writer]] | url = http://albayan.org/modules.php?name=Content&amp;pa=showpage&amp;pid=6 | title = Historical scrap | publisher = Al-Bayan |language=Arabic| accessdate=2 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious activity==

===Religious study in 1960s===
During his academic study Isa Qassim went to [[Noaim]] at night to study Islamic teachings under sheikh [[Abdul-Hussain Al-Heli]] (Died in 1957). In 1962 Qassim began studies at the [[Najaf]] Religious Institute in [[Iraq]], where he studied under many [[Marja'|Marja]]'s including [[Mohammad Baqir al-Sadr]].&lt;ref name="AlBayan 1"/&gt; He remained in Al-Najaf for 4 years then returned to Bahrain where he worked as a teacher in [[Khamis, Bahrain|Al-Khamis]] intermediate school for 2 years before returning to Al-Najaf. In Al-Najaf he met with other Shia Bahraini scholars including: Sheikh [[Abdul Amir al-Jamri]], Sheikh [[Abdulla Al-Guraifi]], Sheikh [[Abdulla Al-Madani]] and Sheikh [[Abbas Al-Rayes]]. All of them were from the same generation and knew each other well even before going to Al-Najaf, due to being partners as students or teachers.&lt;ref name="Al Wasat 22.10.2010"/&gt;

===Religious study in 1990s===
At the beginning of the 1990s, Isa Qassim traveled to [[Qum]] in [[Iran]] to continue his religious studies. He studied on the hands of some of the highest-ranking [[Marja'|Marjas]] including: Ayatollah Sayed [[Mahmood al-Qashimi]], Ayatollah Sayed [[Kadhem al-Haeri]] and Ayatollah [[Fadhel al-Lankarani]]. In March 2001, he finished his studies, gained the title of [[Ayatollah]] and returned to Bahrain on March 8, 2001.&lt;ref name="AlBayan 1"/&gt;

===Friday Sermon===
Isa Qassim has been leading [[Friday Sermon]] in [[Diraz|Duraz]] mosque since his return to Bahrain in 2001. Thousands of worshipers attend this sermon weekly. During the first speech preceding prayer, Qassim usually speaks about religious topics. And about political topics during the second speech.

==Political activity==

===1970s elections===
[[File:Friday prayer in Duraz.jpg|thumb|Isa Qassim leading [[Friday Sermon]] in [[Diraz|Duraz]] on 25 March 2011.]]

In 1971 Isa Qassim was chosen by religious leaders to be a candidate for elections while he was still in Iraq. At first he refused and wanted to stay in Iraq to finish his studies and stay away from politics, but just four days before candidates registration was closed, his brother Mahdi traveled to Iraq and brought him back along with his wife and kids. In 1972 he was elected for the [[Constituent assembly]] where he had big influence in including parts of the Islamic [[sharia]] in the [[Constitution of Bahrain|1973 constitution]].&lt;ref name="AlBayan 1"/&gt;

===Formation of the religious block===
In 1972 a 'religious block' was formed which included Isa Qassim, Sheikh [[Abdul Amir al-Jamri]], Sheikh [[Abdulla Al-Madani]], Sheikh [[Abbas Al-Rayes]], Suleiman Al-Mubarak and Hassan Al-Motawwaj. At first they were 9 members, but later 3 of them joined the 'Independent middle' block. During elections the block adopted a wide program including: supporting the labor's union &amp; demands, forbidding trade of [[Alcoholic drinks]] and separating men and women in higher education (like primary, intermediate and secondary schools). They also called for prohibiting male doctors from treating females (especially in pregnancy) as well as other demands that are part of the Islamic customs.&lt;ref name="Al Wasat 22.10.2010"/&gt;

In 1973 Qassim was elected a member of Bahrain's parliament, the [[National Assembly of Bahrain]], until the parliament was dissolved in August 1975. He gained 1079 votes making him the biggest winner in the fifteen constituency.&lt;ref name="Al Wasat 22.10.2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AlBayan 1"/&gt;

===1996 coup plot allegations===
The Bahraini government alleged that Qassim was implicated in a coup plot in 1996. They accused him to be the head of an Iran-based group called [[Hezbollah#In the Arab and Muslim world|Hizbullah Bahrain]], who were said to be behind a [[List of conspiracies (political)|conspiracy]] to overthrow the Bahraini government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=The Guardian (London) |date= June 12, 1996 |title= Bahrain Plot 'Is Led From Qom'}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of those convicted of the conspiracy confessed to receiving financial help and military training from [[Iran]] and [[Lebanon]]. This claim was described by [[Human Rights Watch]] as lacking any credibility.&lt;ref name="HRW report"&gt;[http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/docid/45cafc9e2.html "Routine Abuse, Routine Denial: Civil Rights and the Political Crisis in Bahrain"]. [[Human Rights Watch]]. [[UNHCR]]. 1 January 2006. Retrieved 19 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Their confessions were broadcast on Bahrain TV. Many Bahraini Shias denied that Isa Qassim was involved in any plot and claimed that the confessions were taken under torture.

===Role in Al Wefaq===
Isa Qassim is often referred to as the spiritual leader of [[Al Wefaq]]. However, he has no formal position within the party and has attained this status as a result of his religious seniority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Transnational Shia politics: religious and political networks in the Gulf |last=Louėr |first=Laurence |publisher = [[C. Hurst &amp; Co|Hurst &amp; Company]] |year=2008 |isbn=978-1-85065-911-2 |page=107}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some see this as a way for Qassim to avoid “submitting his opinions to internal democratic debate so that he can retain the final decision without paying the price for it”.&lt;ref name="louer.p284"&gt;{{cite book |title=Transnational Shia politics: religious and political networks in the Gulf |last=Louėr |first=Laurence |publisher = [[C. Hurst &amp; Co|Hurst &amp; Company]] |year=2008 |isbn=978-1-85065-911-2 |page=284}}&lt;/ref&gt; Qassim rarely makes his decisions in public.

==Involvement in the Bahraini uprising (2011–present)==
Throughout the [[Bahraini uprising (2011–present)]] Qassim has been a vocal critic of the government and has led the opposition to King [[Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa]]. "Bahrain’s Sunni rulers have treated Shiite anti-government protesters seeking greater rights in the Gulf kingdom as enemies of state." He said on September 16 during [[Friday Sermon]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://isaqassim.tumblr.com/post/10314811562/qassim-bahrain-treats-protesters-as-state-enemies "Qassim: Bahrain treats protesters as state enemies", Isa Qassim, 17 September 2011], Retrieved 5 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt; "the politics of fear and the Sunni rulers’ refusal to reform has strengthened the resolve of Bahrain’s Shiite majority. He added.&lt;ref&gt;[http://isaqassim.tumblr.com/post/10314782130/bahrain-crackdown-failed-to-end-protests "Bahrain crackdown failed to end protests", Isa Qassim, 17 September 2011], Retrieved 5 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===Deployment of Peninsula Shield Force===
On 14 March, the [[Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf|Gulf Cooperation Council]] (GCC) agreed to deploy [[Peninsula Shield Force]] troops to Bahrain. [[Saudi Arabia]] deployed about 1,000 troops with armored support, and the [[United Arab Emirates]] deployed about 500 police officers. The forces crossed into Bahrain via the [[King Fahd Causeway]]. The purported reason of the intervention was to secure key installations.&lt;ref name="al-jazeera"&gt;{{cite web | author=[[Staff writer]] | url = http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2011/03/2011314124928850647.html | title = Saudi Soldiers Sent into Bahrain&amp;nbsp;– Saudi Troops and Police from UAE Deployed to Gulf Neighbour To Help Protect Government Facilities After Weeks of Unrest |publisher=Al Jazeera English | date=15 March 2011 | accessdate=15 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ny-times"&gt;{{registration required|date=April 2011}} {{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/15/world/middleeast/15bahrain.html?_r=1&amp;hp | title = Saudi Troops Enter Bahrain to Help Put Down Unrest |work=The New York Times |date=14 March 2011 | accessdate=14 March 2011 | first1=Ethan | last1=Bronner | first2=Michael | last2=Slackman}}&lt;/ref&gt; The opposition reacted strongly, calling it an "occupation".&lt;ref name="BBCBahr14Mar"&gt;{{cite news | author=[[Staff writer]] | title = Gulf States Send Force to Bahrain Following Protests | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-12729786 |publisher=BBC News  | date=14 March 2011 | accessdate=15 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the deployment of the GCC troops in Bahrain. Isa Qassim, criticised al-Khalifa's claims that the mobilisation of GCC troops is a broader effort to ensure regional stability, rather than what Qassim considers to be Sunni entrenchment and a veiled challenge to Shia representation in the government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.aljazeera.net/indepth/features/2011/03/201131514304128920.html "Saudi presence 'fuels' strife fears", Al Jazeera English, 15 March 2011], Retrieved 2 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 March he said the [[Peninsula Shield Force]] had "made a big mistake" and he "would have been proud" if it instead went "to help our brothers in [[Gaza City|Gaza]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.muslimnews.co.uk/news/news.php?article=19875 "Bahrain: Shaykh Isa Qassim 1st Friday prayer sermon after declaration of martial law", The Muslim News, 19 March 2011], Retrieved 5 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Loss of nationality==
On 20 June 2016, a week after the government of Bahrain suspended the Shia opposition group al-Wefaq, Isa Qassim was stripped of his Bahraini citizenship. An [[Ministry of Interior (Bahrain)|interior ministry]] statement accused Sheikh Isa Qassim of using his position to "serve foreign interests" and promote "sectarianism and violence". Announcing the move to strip him of his Bahraini citizenship, the interior ministry said the cleric had "adopted theocracy and stressed the absolute allegiance to the clergy". It added that he had been in continuous contact with "organisations and parties that are enemies of the kingdom". Bahrain's [[Bahraini nationality law|citizenship law]] allows for the cabinet to revoke the citizenship of anyone who "causes harm to the interests of the kingdom or behaves in a way inimical with the duty of loyalty to it".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emirates247.com/news/bahrain-revokes-citizenship-of-man-accused-of-extremism-2016-06-20-1.633556|title=Bahrain revokes citizenship of man accused of extremism|first=|last=Wam|publisher=|accessdate=20 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/06/bahrain-strips-religious-leader-nationality-160620122338238.html|title=Bahrain strips Sheikh Isa Qassim of nationality|publisher=|accessdate=20 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-36578000|title=Bahrain revokes top Shia cleric Isa Qassim's citizenship|publisher=|accessdate=20 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Qassim is an indigenous Bahraini who received his nationality in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bahrain revokes top Shia cleric’s citizenship|url=https://next.ft.com/content/00b71fb0-36f5-11e6-9a05-82a9b15a8ee7|work=Financial Times|date=20 June 2016|accessdate=22 July 2016|author=Simeon Kerr|quote=The cabinet decided to revoke the citizenship of Sheikh Isa — an indigenous Bahraini who applied for nationality to get a passport in the 1960s.|place=Dubai}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reaction ===
* After the decision was announced, several hundred Qassim supporters gathered outside his house in the mostly Shia village of [[Diraz]], carrying posters and chanting religious slogans.
* Hussein Abdulla, executive director of campaign group Americans for Human Rights and Democracy in Bahrain, called the move to revoke his citizenship "an unprecedented low for the Bahraini authorities".
* Sayed Alwadaei, director of advocacy at the British-based campaign group Bahrain Institute for Rights and Democracy, said in a statement that the decision would "escalate tensions on the streets and may even lead to violence".
* Saudi Arabia's [[Council of Senior Scholars (Saudi Arabia)]] welcomed the actions taken by Bahrain.
* [[Hezbollah]], the Lebanese Shia group, denounced the decision on its [[Al-Manar]] TV network, which called on Bahrainis to "express their indignation" and said the move against the cleric would have "grave consequences".
* [[Ali Larijani]], [[List of Speakers of the Parliament of Iran|Speaker]] of the [[Islamic Consultative Assembly|Iranian parliament]] condemned the action, saying "this was an impolitic and quite an adventurous move by the Bahraini regime which assumed that by revoking the nationality of this prominent spiritual leader, it could lead the country's domestic political crisis toward tranquility" and "the Al-Khalifa regime must take a careful look at this historical record that clearly shows once a government starts threatening the influential figures of its nation with revocation of citizenship, it is taking its last breaths".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.mehrnews.com/news/117517/Revocation-of-Qassim-s-citizenship-sign-of-Al-Khalifa-s-last|title=Revocation of Qassim’s citizenship sign of Al-Khalifa’s ‘last breaths’|date=21 June 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In a statement published by [[Fars News Agency]], [[Major-General]] [[Qassem Soleimani]], commander of the [[Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps]] [[Quds Force]] said: "The [[House of Khalifa|Al Khalifa]] [rulers of Bahrain] surely know their aggression against Sheikh Isa Qassim is a red line that crossing it would set Bahrain and the whole region on fire, and it would leave no choice for people but to resort to armed resistance."Al Khalifa will definitely pay the price for that and their blood-thirsty regime will be toppled."
* [[Spokesperson for the United States Department of State]] [[John Kirby (admiral)|John Kirby]] said, "We are alarmed by the Government of Bahrain's decision to revoke the citizenship of prominent Shia cleric, Sheikh Isa Qassim" and "We remain deeply troubled by the Government of Bahrain's practice of withdrawing the nationality of its citizens arbitrarily, the overall precedent that this case could establish, and the risk that individuals may be rendered stateless".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2016/06/20/world/middleeast/ap-ml-bahrain.html|title=Bahrain Strips Nationality From Top Shiite Cleric|date=20 June 2016|agency=AP|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-bahrain-cleric-idUSKCN0Z626B|title=U.S. criticizes Bahrain's move to strip cleric of citizenship|date=20 June 2016|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=20 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Human Rights Watch]] said the decision to strip the cleric of his citizenship "takes Bahrain into the darkest days" since the [[Bahraini uprising (2011–present)|2011 crackdown]] and "these actions should be met with serious consequences, not expressions of concern".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/2016/jun/20/cabinet-strips-top-shiite-cleric-in-bahrain-of/|title=Bahrain strips nationality from top Shiite cleric|work=San Diego Union-Tribune|accessdate=20 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Supreme Leader of Iran]], [[Ali Khamenei]], said in a speech carried by state media, "This is blatant foolishness and insanity. When he still could address the Bahraini people, Sheikh Isa Qassim would advise against radical and armed actions" and "Attacking Sheikh Isa Qassim means removing all obstacles blocking heroic Bahraini youths from attacking the regime".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bahrain-shiites-iran-idUSKCN0ZC0DH|title=Iran supreme leader: Bahrain's move against top cleric risks violence|date=26 June 2016|publisher=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Money laundering charges==
On 16 July 2016, the head of public prosecution, Ahmed al-Dosari, said a Bahraini cleric would go on trial the next month on charges of collecting funds illegally and money laundering. Sources identified the cleric as Qassim. Bahraini media last month reported an investigation was underway into a bank account of some $10 million in Qassim's name to find the source of the funds and how they were being spent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bahrain-cleric/bahrain-to-try-top-shiite-cleric-for-money-laundering-idUSKCN0ZW11U|title=Bahrain to try top Shi'ite cleric for money laundering|date=16 July 2016|publisher=|access-date=19 January 2018|via=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Adam Treutlen''', born '''Hans Adam Treuettlen''' (January 16, 1734 – March 1, 1782), arrived in [[Colonial America]] as an [[indentured servant]] and rose to become a wealthy merchant and landowner. He was a leader in [[Province of Georgia|Georgia]] during the [[American Revolution]] and helped write [[Constitution of Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia's first constitution]]. In 1777, he was elected Georgia's first (post-British) [[governor]]. He was one of Georgia's few governors to die by violence. 

Although much of his life has been surrounded by mystery and controversy, more details have emerged in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;Susan Exley. [http://www.effinghamherald.net/archives/18993/ The life and times of John Adam Treutlen], ''Effingham Herald'', August 30, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Hans Adam Treuettlen&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:N522-Q2B|title=Baptism registry entry|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; was born to Hans Michel Treuettlen, a cooper, and Magdalena Clara, ''née'' Job, in the city of [[Kürnbach]], now in Germany, then a condominium of the [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt]] and the [[Duchy of Württemberg]]. Treutlen's home was located in the part of the city that was ruled by Württemberg. His parents were married in 1731&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:J4RV-R4H|title=Marriage registry entry|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; after having two illegitimate children. He was the second child born after his parents married. It was Hans Michel's second marriage; his first marriage was to Maria Regina and they had seven children. Maria Regina died in 1727.

The Treutlens were Protestants. In parts of the German-speaking lands, Protestants were persecuted by Catholic authorities, and many left for America seeking religious freedom. Clara, however, was a Catholic. Thus, the Treutlens were also very likely persecuted by the Protestant establishment for Clara's religion and also because the family had two children outside the marriage bond. That situation probably caused the 56-year-old Hans Michel to take, in late April 1744, his wife and four of their children on the arduous and dangerous voyage to seek a new life in America. The four children who went on this voyage were Friedrich, from Hans Michel's first marriage, Hans Philipp, one of the illegitimate children, and John Adam and Jonathan, the two youngest children.&lt;ref&gt;[http://visitebenezer.com/georgia-salzburger-society/john-adam-treutlen/ John Adam Treutlen: Recent Research Findings], ''Georgia Salzburger Society''
&lt;/ref&gt;

The Treutlens traveled first to [[Gosport]] on the southern coast of Britain. In November 1745, Clara and three of the children left [[Gosport]] for Georgia with a group of Lutheran [[Salzburg]]ers who had been expelled from their Catholic-dominated homeland (see [[Salzburg#Religious conflict]]).

The mother and children embarked on the ill-fated ''Judith''. Hans Michel and one of the children, Hanß Philipp, remained in Britain. During the voyage across the Atlantic, there was an outbreak of typhus fever on the Judith. Thirteen individuals died, including the ship's captain. The first mate also became seriously ill. The ''Judith'' was in danger of not making the trip safely for death and illness left no one skilled at navigating a ship on the high seas. However, Rev. Bartholomäus Zuberbühler, who had no prior experience sailing, used his knowledge of geometry to figure out how to navigate the ''Judith'' safely to Georgia.

Upon their arrival in Georgia, Clara and the three Treutlen children were indentured to Michael Burckhalter of [[Vernonburg]]. Pastor Johann Martin Boltzius of the Salzburgers in Ebenezer took notice of the extraordinary talents of John Treutlen and endeavored to remove him to [[Ebenezer, Georgia|Ebenezer]] in order to enroll him at the school there. However, Boltzius found it difficult to arrange for permission for Treutlen's attendance at the school because of Clara's history of abandoned husbands, illegitimate children, and Catholicism.

Treutlen's "wicked and worldly parents" were also probably the reason that his true origins have remained hidden for so long. For 200 years, it was believed that he was born in [[Berchtesgaden]], Austria. According to that story, the Treutlens, on their way to America, were attacked and the father captured and imprisoned by Spanish pirates. The father was supposed to have died in a Spanish prison in 1744. This story avoids many of the facts of Hans Michel's and Clara's lives together that people of the 18th century would find disagreeable. The story thus gained credence and then took on a life of its own over the next 200 years. However, marriage, birth, and other documents, which were recently discovered in Europe, have provided a more accurate picture of the Treutlens' European origins and their voyage to America.

==Early career==
Overcoming the burden of his parents' past, Treutlen was enrolled in the school at Ebenezer. He did extremely well in his studies at Ebenezer and acquired a broad education in a wide variety of subjects in Latin, French, German, and English. He profited from growing up among the Salzburgers. As an adult, he was described as a man who possessed "an enlightened reason, Adam's natural intelligence and ability to give a name to every animal, knowledge of the laws of the land, and some discernment of practical religion."

In 1756, Treutlen married Marguerite Dupuis, an orphan who was also educated at Ebenezer. He soon began acquiring land and established for himself a large plantation and a successful merchant business. In 1768, he was appointed Justice of the Peace. He served as Commissioner and Surveyor of Roads, and several terms in the 1770s as Ebenezer's representative in the Georgia Commons House of Assembly.

Treutlen assumed an active role in the religious life at Ebenezer. He was a teacher at the school there. He was a leader of the Rabenhorst faction in the sometimes-violent conflicts between the Ebenezer pastors, the Reverend Christoph Triebner and the Reverend Christian Rabenhorst. His association with Rev. Rabenhorst indicated Treutlen's religious sympathies. Ministers such as Rev. Rabenhorst and Rev. [[John Joachim Zubly]] of [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]], found comfort in the writings of such German theologians as Rev. [[Johann Joachim Spalding]]. Those ministers accepted the many differences among the people in the colonies as a result of the different countries and cultures of those people. In their practical day-to-day activities of ministering to the diverse population, those ministers found it most effective to employ various strategies in the gracious work of conversion.

Treutlen's religious views, formed by his association with Rev. Rabenhorst, undoubtedly helped him to develop his support for the democratic political institutions that seemed so agreeable with this diversity.

In July 1775, Treutlen represented Ebenezer at the Provincial Congress. He took an active role in the revolution. He quickly became a leader, along with [[Button Gwinnett]] and George Wells, of the radical faction. In February 1777, Treutlen, Gwinnett, and Wells were on the committee that drafted Georgia's first constitution. As a result, the constitution included such democratic provisions as virtually-universal suffrage and annual elections of office holders. On May 8, 1777, the immensely-popular Treutlen was elected by a wide margin as Georgia's first governor under this new constitution. With the selection of Treutlen, Georgia chose a man who "possesses native intelligence" and could, under pressure, reply "coolly and laconically" to his political opponents and was thus well suited for the difficult task of leading the new state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nga.org/cms/home/governors/past-governors-bios/page_georgia/col2-content/main-content-list/title_treutlen_john.html|title=John Adam Treutlen|first=|last=root|website=www.nga.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Governorship==
[[file:John Treutlen monument, Ebenezer, Effingham County, GA, US.jpg|right|thumb|Treutlen monument in [[Ebenezer, Georgia]].]]
Treutlen's term as governor was marked by political conflicts between the radical and the conservative factions of the patriots. The conservatives opposed the democratic provisions of the new constitution that allowed many of those from the lower classes, with backgrounds like the former indentured servant Treutlen, to be elected to positions of power in the government. The radicals referred to the conservatives as Tories and, in some cases, treated them accordingly. The radicals and the conservatives clashed over the issues of civil control of the military, the conduct of the war and the conservatives' initiative to merge Georgia with South Carolina. The radicals were defeated in their attempts to remove the conservative General [[Lachlan McIntosh]] from his position of leadership in the continental army in Georgia when national leaders, such as [[George Washington]], sided with McIntosh.&lt;ref name="ANB"&gt;Helene M. Kastinger Riley. [https://books.google.com/books?id=wZczV8ZxgL4C&amp;pg=PA557&amp;lpg=PA557&amp;dq=John+A.+Treutlen&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=749Ko9Liir&amp;sig=MzGSKZ1OJ4efwAf0mmwR_mMddJY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjIvbaD_K_KAhWKPD4KHZgsDIM4ChDoAQhGMAc#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Treutlen, John Adam]. In: Mark C. Carnes (Ed.).  ''American National Biography, Supplement 2''. New York: Oxford University Press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the war, thosr political conflicts erupted into violent and tragic confrontations. In February 1777, the conservative Joseph Habersham killed the radical Lieutenant Nathaniel Hughes in a dispute at the opening of the convention that was called to write Georgia's first constitution. On May 16, 1777, the conservative General McIntosh mortally wounded the radical Gwinnett. On February 16, 1780, the conservative James Jackson killed the radical Wells. Treutlen and the radicals lost many of their battles with the conservatives.

The Revolutionary War was particularly hard on the Salzburgers at Ebenezer. During the war, "when the English left, the Americans came, when the Americans went, the English came back," but one thing remained the same: no matter who was there, the Salzburgers were plundered. Some were plundered as many as ten times during the years of war.

==Fall==
On December 30, 1776, Rev. Rabenhorst died, leaving Ebenezer with no spiritual guidance. Thus, when [[John Houstoun]] was elected governor in January 1778, Treutlen dropped out of statewide politics and returned to Ebenezer to see what he could do to help the community and people that had provided him with so much during his three decades in America. At Savannah, he became a [[Freemason]] by joining the first Masonic Lodge established in Georgia, named [[Solomon's Lodge, Savannah|Solomon's Lodge]], No. 1., constituted in 1735 by the Grand Lodge of England, was founded in the Georgia Colony by the English Freemason [[James Oglethorpe]] on February 21, 1734. Treutlen's name is listed on the Lodge's Masonic membership roles in 1779 along with Archibald Bulloch, George Walton, General Samuel Elbert and many other Georgia leaders of the Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.solomonslodge.com/whoweare/lodgehistory.html Solomon's Lodge, No. 1, F.&amp; A. M.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130314190419/http://www.solomonslodge.com/whoweare/lodgehistory.html |date=March 14, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Late in 1781, Treutlen re-entered statewide politics as Ebenezer's elected representative to the [[Georgia Assembly]]. He served in the January 1782 session. In 1782, the conservatives, whom Treutlen had opposed five years earlier, controlled the government of Georgia. Treutlen was one of the few radical democrats in the government that year. The imbalance in power between the radicals and the conservatives helped to create an atmosphere where the conservatives felt free to seek revenge for old scores and wounds.&lt;ref name="ANB" /&gt;

==Murder==
On a night in March 1782, by some accounts, five men rode up to the Treutlen home. They demanded for Treutlen to come outside, but he refused. The men then set fire to the home, forcing Treutlen, his wife and children to come outside. The men seized Treutlen and killed him in full view of his family. Other accounts of Treutlen's death are considerably different as to the details of the attack.&lt;ref&gt;Finck, William J. [https://archive.org/stream/lutheranlandmark00finc#page/n257/mode/2up ''Lutheran landmarks and pioneers in America: a series of sketches of colonial times.''] Philadelphia: General Council Publication House, 1913.&lt;/ref&gt; Some versions even place his death in South Carolina, not Georgia, and give a later date (late 1782 or early 1783), but there is no dispute that he died by some kind of mob violence.

Historians continue to speculate about what person or group was behind the killing and what was the motive. Some contemporary accounts claimed Treutlen was killed by Tories angry about the American victory in the Revolutionary War. Others blamed the killing on South Carolinians who resented his opposition to merging Georgia into South Carolina during the war. There was also speculation at the time that the motive was a purely-personal grudge. The multiplicity of accounts and theories of his death indicates that there was never a consensus about the cause of the event.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5268">'''Liberalization''' (or '''liberalisation''') is any process whereby a state lifts restrictions on some private individual activities. Liberalization occurs when something which used to be banned is no longer banned, or when [[government]] [[regulation]]s are relaxed.

The term "liberalization" is most often used in discussing [[economic liberalization]], which refers to the reduction of state involvement in the economy, but it can be used in other contexts as well.

==In law==
In social policy, liberalization may refer to a relaxation of laws restricting, for example, divorce, abortion, or psychoactive drugs. Regarding [[Civil and political rights|civil rights]], it may refer to the elimination of laws prohibiting homosexuality, private ownership of firearms or other items, same-sex marriage, inter-racial marriage, or inter-faith marriage.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

==In economy and trade==
{{main|Economic liberalization}}
Economic liberalization refers to the reduction or elimination of government regulations or restrictions on private business and trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = O'Sullivan |first1 = Arthur | authorlink = Arthur O'Sullivan (economist) | first2 = Steven M. | last2 = Sheffrin | title = Economics: Principles in Action | publisher = [[Pearson Prentice Hall]] | date = 2003 | publication-place = New Jersey | page = 175 | isbn = 0-13-063085-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is usually promoted by advocates of [[free market]]s and [[free trade]], whose ideology is also called [[economic liberalism]]. Economic liberalization also often involves reductions of taxes, social security, and unemployment benefits.

Economic liberalization is often associated with [[privatization]], which is the process of transferring ownership or outsourcing of a business, enterprise, agency, [[public]] service or public property from the public sector to the private sector. For example, the [[European Union]] has liberalized gas and electricity markets, instituting a competitive system. Some leading European energy companies such as France's [[Électricité de France|EDF]] and Sweden's [[Vattenfall]] remain partially or completely in government ownership.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} Liberalized and privatized public services may be dominated by big companies, particularly in sectors with high capital, water, gas, or electricity costs.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} In some cases they may remain legal monopolies, at least for some segments of the market like consumers.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} Liberalization, privatization and stabilization are the [[Washington Consensus]]'s trinity strategy for economies in transition.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

There is also a concept of hybrid liberalization as, for instance, in Ghana, cocoa crops can be sold to competing private companies, but there is a minimum price for which it can be sold and all exports are controlled by the state.&lt;ref&gt;Marcella Vigneri and Paulo Santos (2007) "[http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=422&amp;title=ghana-cocoa-marketing-dilemma-liberalisation-without-price-competition-achieved Ghana and the cocoa marketing dilemma: What has liberalization without price competition achieved?]", [[Overseas Development Institute]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Shift from State to Market
During 1970’s societies faced economic problems due to the high taxation, employment policies, public sector, great state intervention. Politicians were not in favour of welfare state and socialism. These problems led the high wage demand, encourage patriotism etc.
In 1980’s there was shift from state to market in the field of the allocation of resources in large parts of the world. This shift resulted the reduction in taxes and reduction in government expenditure. The multilateral agencies IMF and World Bank pressurise the state to apply the policy of liberalisation.

Facets of Liberalisation
Liberation in Europe carried on by reducing the public expenditure, social security, welfare programmes, taxation
etc. It did not affect the highly agricultural production. In 1970’s liberalisation at its early phase in developing countries
maintained stabilisation of the economy–public expenditure was control, increase in tax return, currency devaluation,
reforms in industrial policy, state expenditure was controlled, reforms in market financial etc.

==Comparison with democratization==
There is a distinct difference between liberalization and [[democratization]]. Liberalization can take place without democratization, and deals with a combination of policy and social change specialized to a certain issue, such as the liberalization of government-held property for private purchase. Democratization is politically highly specialized; it can arise from a liberalization but works on a broader level of governmental liberalization.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

A '''"Little Miller Act"''' is a [[United States|U.S.]] state statute, based upon the federal [[Miller Act]], that requires prime contractors on state construction projects to post bonds guarantying the performance of their contractual duties and/or the payment of their [[subcontractor]]s and material suppliers.

{{TOC limit|limit=2}}

==Typical statutory provisions==

Little Miller Acts typically require the posting of a [[performance bond]], a type of [[surety bond]] that covers the cost of substitute performance if the prime contractor fails to fully perform his duties under the contract.

Little Miller Acts also typically require the posting of a [[Payment Bond|payment bond]], which provides an alternate source of payment to the [[subcontractors]] and material suppliers who worked on the job.  If the claimant did not have a direct contractual relationship with the prime contractor, the claimant is typically required to give some form of notice to the prime contractor within a specified time after the completion of the work to preserve the right to make a claim against the [[Payment Bond|payment bond]]. The purpose of the notice requirement is to give the prime contractor an opportunity to withhold payment to the first-tier subcontractor and otherwise encourage payment to the claimant.

==Purpose and function==

Little Miller Acts address two concerns that would otherwise exist in the performance of state government construction projects:

#'''''Performance Bonds''':''  The contractor's abandonment or other non-performance of a government job may cause critical delays and added expense in the government procurement process.  The bonding process helps weed out irresponsible contractors while the bond itself defrays the government's cost of substitute performance.  The subrogration right of the bond [[surety]] against the contractor (i.e., the right to sue for indemnification) is a deterrent to non-performance. Bond sureties often require additional security, including personal guarantees by principals of the prime contractor, to protect themselves in the event that the prime contractor ceases doing business simultaneous with the default. This provides the prime contractor's principals with additional incentive to ensure the project is completed.
#'''''Payment Bonds:'''''  Subcontractors and material suppliers would otherwise be reluctant to work on such projects (knowing that [[sovereign immunity]] prevents the establishment of a [[mechanic's lien]]) - decreasing competition and driving up construction costs.

He worked in [[Brazil]] as a captive; however, he escaped and fled to [[New York City|New York]] in 1847, assuring his freedom. He wrote a biography, published by American [[Abolitionism|abolitionist]] Samuel Moore in 1854. His report is the only known document about the slave trade written by a former Brazilian slave.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Historiadores traduzem única autobiografia escrita por ex-escravo que viveu no Brasil|url = http://oglobo.globo.com/sociedade/historia/historiadores-traduzem-unica-autobiografia-escrita-por-ex-escravo-que-viveu-no-brasil-14671795|website = O Globo|accessdate = 2015-11-30|language = pt-BR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Baquaqua was born in Djougou (currently in [[Benin]]) between 1820 and 1830 in a prominent Muslim trader family. He learned the [[Quran]], literature and mathematics in an Islamic school. Still as an [[Adolescence|adolescent]], he and his brother took part in the succession wars in [[Daboya, Ghana|Daboya]], where he was captured and then rescued.

Returning to [[Djougou]], he became the servant of a local dignitary, perhaps the chief of Soubroukou, whom he called 'king'. The abuses he committed in that period made him target of an ambush in which he was imprisoned and transported to [[Dahomey]]; he was embarked into a [[slave ship]] in 1845 and taken to [[Pernambuco]] in Brazil.

Baquaqua was a slave in [[Olinda]], Pernambuco for around two years. His master was a baker. He worked in the construction of houses, carrying stones, learned [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], and performed as an "''escravo de tabuleiro''" (peddling slave). The cruelty of his Brazilian masters made him resort to alcoholism and attempt suicide.

Taken to [[Rio de Janeiro]], Baquaqua was incorporated with the crew of the trade ship ''Lembrança'', transporting goods to the southern provinces of Brazil. In 1847, a coffee shipment to the United States was his passport to freedom. The ship arrived in [[New York harbor]] in June,  where it was approached by local abolitionists, who encouraged him to escape from the ship. After the escape, however, he was imprisoned in the local jail, and only the help of the abolitionists (who facilitated his escape from prison) prevented his return to the ship. He was then sent to [[Haiti]], where he lived with the Reverend Judd, a Baptist missionary.

Converted to Christianity and baptized in 1848, Baquaqua returned to the US due to the political instability in Haiti. He studied at the [[New York Central College]] in [[McGrawville]] for almost three years. In 1854, he moved to Canada; his autobiography was published the same year by Samuel Downing Moore in Detroit.

It not known what happened to Baquaqua after 1857. He was then in England and had turned to the [[American Baptist Free Mission Society]] to be sent as a missionary to Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Baquaqua, Mahommah Gardo (1824?-1857?)

'''Orange County''' is a [[county (United States)|county]] in the [[Los Angeles metropolitan area]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[California]]. As of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], the population was 3,010,232,&lt;ref name="QF"&gt;{{cite web |title=Orange County QuickFacts|url=http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/06/06059.html |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |accessdate=April 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; making it the third-most populous county in California, the [[County statistics of the United States|sixth-most populous]] in the United States, and more populous than 21 U.S. states.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=American FactFinder|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=July 10, 2014|url=http://factfinder2.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/PEP/2013/PEPANNRES/0100000US&amp;#124;0100000US.04000&amp;#124;0200000US1&amp;#124;0200000US2&amp;#124;0200000US3&amp;#124;0200000US4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its [[county seat]] is [[Santa Ana, California|Santa Ana]].&lt;ref name="GR6"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naco.org/Counties/Pages/FindACounty.aspx |accessdate=June 7, 2011 |title=Find a County |publisher=National Association of Counties |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6YQozzgAf?url=http://www.naco.org/Counties/Pages/FindACounty.aspx |archivedate=May 10, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the second most densely populated county in the state, behind [[San Francisco|San Francisco County]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usa.com/rank/california-state--population-density--county-rank.htm |title=California Population Density County Rank |publisher=USA.com |date= |accessdate=August 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The county's four largest cities by population, [[Anaheim, California|Anaheim]], [[Santa Ana, California|Santa Ana]] ([[County seat|county seat]]), [[Irvine, California|Irvine]], and [[Huntington Beach, California|Huntington Beach]], each have a population exceeding 200,000. Several of Orange County's cities are on the [[Pacific Ocean]] western coast, including [[Huntington Beach]], [[Newport Beach]], [[Laguna Beach]], [[Dana Point]], and [[San Clemente]].

Orange County is included in the [[Los Angeles]]-[[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]]-[[Anaheim, California|Anaheim]], [[Los Angeles metropolitan area|Metropolitan Statistical Area]]. Thirty-four [[Incorporated place|incorporated]] towns and cities are in the county; the newest is [[Aliso Viejo, California|Aliso Viejo]], which was incorporated in 2001. Anaheim was the first city, incorporated in 1870, when the region was still part of neighboring [[Los Angeles County]]. Whereas most population centers in the [[United States]] tend to be identified by a major city with a large downtown 
[[central business district]] (CBD), Orange County has no single major downtown / CBD or dominant urban center. Santa Ana, Costa Mesa, and Irvine all have smaller high-rise CBDs, and other, older cities like Anaheim, [[Fullerton, California|Fullerton]], Huntington Beach, and [[Orange, California|Orange]] have traditional American downtowns without high-rises. The county's northern and central portions are heavily urbanized and fairly dense, despite the prevalence of the single-family home as a dominant land use. Its southern portion is more suburban, with less density and limited urbanization. There are several "[[edge city]]"-style developments, such as Irvine Business Center, [[Newport Center]], and [[South Coast Metro]]. Orange County is part of the "Tech Coast".

The county is a tourist center, with attractions like [[Disneyland]], [[Knott's Berry Farm]], and several popular beaches along its more than {{convert|40|mi|km|0}} of coastline. It has also historically been known for its political [[Conservatism in the United States|conservatism]]; a 2005 academic study listed three Orange County cities as among America's 25 most conservative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://govpro.com/content/gov_imp_31439/ |title=Study ranks America's most liberal and conservative cities |publisher=Govpro.com |date=August 16, 2005 |access-date=July 22, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120722203607/http://govpro.com/content/gov_imp_31439/ |archive-date=July 22, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[California elections, 2018|2018 midterm elections]], the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] gained control of every Congressional seat in the county.&lt;ref name="ARELLANO"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wildermuth"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LAT Thornton"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT Nagourney"/&gt;

==History==
[[File:Orange County map 1921.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Orange County map, 1921]]

Members of the [[Tongva people|Tongva]], [[Juaneño]], and [[Luiseño people|Luiseño]] Native American groups long inhabited the area. After the 1769 expedition of [[Gaspar de Portolà]], a Spanish expedition led by [[Junipero Serra]] named the area Valle de Santa Ana (Valley of [[Saint Anne]]). On November 1, 1776, [[Mission San Juan Capistrano]] became the area's first permanent European settlement. Among those who came with Portolá were [[Rancho Los Nietos|José Manuel Nieto]] and [[José Antonio Yorba]]. Both these men were given land grants—[[Rancho Los Nietos]] and [[Rancho Santiago de Santa Ana]], respectively. The Nieto heirs were granted land in 1834. The Nieto ranches were known as [[Rancho Los Alamitos]], [[Rancho Las Bolsas]], and [[Rancho Los Coyotes]]. Yorba heirs [[Bernardo Yorba]] and [[José Antonio Yorba|Teodosio Yorba]] were also granted [[Rancho Cañón de Santa Ana]] (Santa Ana Canyon Ranch) and [[Rancho Lomas de Santiago]], respectively. Other ranchos in Orange County were granted by the Mexican government during the Mexican period in [[Alta California]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://egov.ocgov.com/vgnfiles/ocgov/Clerk-Recorder/Docs/Archives/Spanish_and_Mexican_Ranchos.pdf Spanish and Mexican Ranchos of Orange County] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726003947/http://egov.ocgov.com/vgnfiles/ocgov/Clerk-Recorder/Docs/Archives/Spanish_and_Mexican_Ranchos.pdf |date=July 26, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A severe drought in the 1860s devastated the prevailing industry, [[cattle]] [[ranching]], and much land came into the possession of Richard O'Neill, Sr.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ranchomissionviejo.com/blog/the-reserve-at-rancho-mission-viejo-a-rich-history/|title=The Reserve at Rancho Mission Viejo: A Rich History|work=Rancho Mission Viejo}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Irvine (landowner)|James Irvine]] and other [[land baron]]s. In 1887, [[silver]] was discovered in the [[Santa Ana Mountains]], attracting settlers via the [[Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway|Santa Fe]] and [[Southern Pacific Railroad]]s.

[[File:Los Angeles County Before OC Secession.svg|thumb|right|200px|[[Los Angeles County]] before the secession of Orange County in 1889]]

After several failed attempts in previous sessions, the [[California legislature]] passed a bill authorizing the portion of [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles County]] south of Coyote Creek to hold a referendum on whether to remain part of Los Angeles County or to secede and form a new county to be named “Orange” as directed by the legislature. Such referendum required a 2/3 vote for secession to take place, and subsequently on June 4th, 1889, the residents south of Coyote Creek voted 2,509 to 500 in favor of secession. After such referendum, Los Angeles County filed three lawsuits in the courts to stall and stop the secession from occurring, but such attempts were futile. On July 17, 1889, a second referendum was held south of the Coyote Creek to determine if the county seat of the to-be county to be in either Anaheim or Santa Ana, along with an election for every county officer. In the end, Santa Ana defeated Anaheim in such referendum and elected right leaning officers, with some, including one of the primary lobbyists for the creation of the county, Henry W. Head, elected to the [[Orange County Board of Supervisors|Board of Supervisors]] while being a member of the [[Ku Klux Klan]] (even though “...the Klan wasn't even supposed to exist at this time, with Bedford having officially told the Klan to disband and burn all belongings.” ''[https://ocweekly.com/profiles-in-oc-pioneers-who-were-klan-members-henry-w-head-oc-founding-father-6448239/ OC Weekly]''), with Head’s son, Horace Head, elected as [[District Attorney]] of the soon to be county, who was known to, as stated by the OC Weekly, threaten “...any Mexicans who walked in front of their homes with [[Shotgun|shotguns]] when not burning [[Cross|crosses]] on front lawns,” along with Horace Head supporting and defending his fathers affiliation with the Ku Klux Klan. With the referendum taken place, the County of Orange was officially incorporated on August 1st, 1889, as prescribed by state law. Since the date of the incorporation of the county, the only geographical changes to have occurred which affected Orange County was when the County and Los Angeles County agreed to trade land around Coyote Creek to adjust the border of the two counties to conform with city blocks.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ocweekly.com/profiles-in-oc-pioneers-who-were-klan-members-henry-w-head-oc-founding-father-6448239/ PROFILES IN OC PIONEERS WHO WERE KLAN MEMBERS: HENRY W.

The county is said to have been named for the [[citrus fruit]] in an attempt to promote immigration by suggesting a semi-tropical paradise–a place where anything could grow.&lt;ref&gt;Sleeper, Jim.

Other [[citrus]] crops, [[avocado]]s, and [[petroleum|oil]] extraction were also important to the early economy. Orange County benefited from the July 4, 1904 completion of the [[Pacific Electric Railway]], a [[tram|trolley]] connecting [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] with [[Santa Ana, California|Santa Ana]] and [[Newport Beach, California|Newport Beach]]. The link made Orange County an accessible weekend retreat for celebrities of early [[Hollywood]]. It was deemed so significant that Pacific City changed its name to [[Huntington Beach, California|Huntington Beach]] in honor of [[Henry E. Huntington]], president of the Pacific Electric and nephew of [[Collis Huntington]]. Transportation further improved with the completion of the State Route and [[U.S. Route 101 in California|U.S. Route 101]] (now mostly [[Interstate 5 in California|Interstate 5]]) in the 1920s.

Agriculture, such as that involving the [[boysenberry|boysenberries]] made famous by [[Buena Park, California|Buena Park]] native [[Walter Knott]], began to decline after [[World War II]]. However, the county's prosperity soared during this time. The completion of [[Interstate 5 in California|Interstate 5]] in 1954 helped make Orange County a [[bedroom community]] for many who moved to [[Southern California]] to work in [[aerospace]] and manufacturing. Orange County received a further boost in 1955 with the opening of [[Disneyland Park (Anaheim)|Disneyland]].

In 1969, [[Yorba Linda]]-born Orange County native [[Richard Nixon]] became the 37th [[President of the United States]].

In the 1980s, Orange County had become the second most populous county in California as the population topped two million for the first time.

{{anchor|bankruptcy}}In 1994, an investment fund meltdown led to the criminal prosecution of treasurer [[Robert Citron]]. The county lost at least $1.5 billion through high-risk investments in bonds. The loss was blamed on [[derivative (finance)|derivatives]] by some media reports.&lt;ref name="timebankrupt"&gt;{{cite news |title= Orange County Goes Bust |url= |publisher=Time Magazine |date=December 19, 1994 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 6, 1994, the County of Orange declared [[Chapter 9, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 9]] bankruptcy,&lt;ref name="timebankrupt"/&gt; from which it emerged on June 12, 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

In recent years, land use conflicts have arisen between established areas in the north and less developed areas in the south. These conflicts have regarded issues such as construction of new toll roads and the repurposing of a decommissioned air base. [[El Toro Marine Corps Air Station]] was designated by a voter measure in 1994 to be developed into an international airport to complement the existing [[John Wayne Airport]]. But subsequent voter initiatives and court actions have caused the airport plan to be permanently shelved. Instead, it became the [[Orange County Great Park]].&lt;ref&gt;Guide to the Collection on the Development of the El Toro Airport.

==Geography==
{{See also|List of rivers of Orange County, California}}

According to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], the county has a total area of {{convert|948|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|791|sqmi}} is land and {{convert|157|sqmi}} (16.6%) is water.&lt;ref name="GR1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.census.gov/geo/docs/maps-data/data/gazetteer/counties_list_06.txt|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=September 28, 2015|date=August 22, 2012|title=2010 Census Gazetteer Files}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the smallest county in [[Southern California]].  The average annual temperature is about {{convert|68|F|C}}.

Orange County is bordered on the southwest by the [[Pacific Ocean]], on the north by [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles County]], on the northeast by [[San Bernardino County, California|San Bernardino County]] and [[Riverside County, California|Riverside County]], and on the southeast by [[San Diego County, California|San Diego County]].

[[File:Newport Center Skyline and Santa Ana Mountains.jpg|thumb|alt=View of the Santa Ana Mountains from Newport Bay|View of [[Newport Center]] and the [[Santa Ana Mountains]] from [[Newport Beach, California#Newport Harbor and Newport Bay|Newport Harbor]]]]
The northwestern part of the county lies on the [[coastal plain]] of the [[Los Angeles Basin]], while the southeastern end rises into the foothills of the [[Santa Ana Mountains]]. Most of Orange County's population reside in one of two shallow coastal valleys that lie in the basin, the [[Santa Ana Valley]] and the [[Saddleback Valley]].  The Santa Ana Mountains lie within the eastern boundaries of the county and of the [[Cleveland National Forest]]. The high point is [[Santiago Peak]] ({{convert|5689|ft|m|0}}&lt;ref name="ngs"&gt;{{cite ngs | id = DX4296 | designation = RP 1 | accessdate = July 16, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;), about {{convert|20|mi|km|abbr=on}} east of Santa Ana. Santiago Peak and nearby [[Modjeska Peak]], just {{convert|200|ft|m|-1}} shorter, form a ridge known as [[Saddleback (Orange County, California)|Saddleback]], visible from almost everywhere in the county. The [[Peralta Hills]] extend westward from the Santa Ana Mountains through the communities of [[Anaheim Hills]], [[Orange, California|Orange]], and ending in [[Olive, California|Olive]]. The Loma Ridge is another prominent feature, running parallel to the Santa Ana Mountains through the central part of the county, separated from the taller mountains to the east by [[Santiago Creek|Santiago Canyon]].

The [[Santa Ana River]] is the county's principal watercourse, flowing through the middle of the county from northeast to southwest. Its major tributary to the south and east is [[Santiago Creek]]. Other watercourses within the county include [[Aliso Creek (Orange County)|Aliso Creek]], [[San Juan Creek]], and Horsethief Creek.  In the North, the [[San Gabriel River (California)|San Gabriel River]] also briefly crosses into Orange County and exits into the Pacific on the Los Angeles-Orange County line between the cities of [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]] and [[Seal Beach, California|Seal Beach]]. [[Laguna Beach]] is home to the county's only natural lakes, Laguna Lakes, which are formed by water rising up against an underground fault.

[[File:Three Arch Bay Photo Taken by pilot D Ramey Logan.jpg|thumb|[[Three Arch Bay]] in Laguna Beach is considered Southern Orange County]]
Residents sometimes divide the county into north Orange County and south Orange County. In effect, this is a division of the county into northwestern and southeastern halves following the county's natural diagonal orientation along the coast.  This is more of a cultural and demographic distinction perpetuated by the popular television shows [[The O.C.|The OC]], [[The Real Housewives of Orange County]] and [[Laguna Beach: The Real Orange County|Laguna Beach]]. The distinction exists between the older areas closer to Los Angeles and the more affluent and recently developed areas to the south.  A transition between older and newer development may be considered to exist roughly parallel to State Route 55, also known as the [[Costa Mesa Freeway]].  This transition is accentuated by large flanking tracts of sparsely developed area occupied until recent years by agriculture and military airfields.

While there is a northeast to southwest topographic transition from elevated areas inland to the lower coastal band, there is no formal geographic division between North and South County. Perpendicular to that gradient, the [[Santa Ana River]] roughly divides the county into northwestern and southeastern sectors. Each sector comprises 40 to 60 percent of the county respectively by area. There are significant political, demographic, economic, and cultural distinctions between North and South Orange County, with North Orange County having greater populations of people of color, younger populations, greater percentages of renters, lower median incomes, higher rates of unemployment, and greater proportions of voters registered as Democrats versus as Republicans. However, certain areas in both North and South Orange County vary from these general trends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Orange County on the Cusp of Change |date=July 2014 |author1=[[University of California, Irvine]] Community and Labor Project |author2=[[UCLA]] Labor Center |url=http://labor.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/downloads/2014/07/FINAL-OC-report-for-Web.pdf |access-date=September 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of the [[census]]&lt;ref name="GR8"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://factfinder2.census.gov|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=May 14, 2011|title=American FactFinder}}&lt;/ref&gt; of 2000, there were 2,846,289 people, 935,287 households, and 667,794 families residing in the county, making Orange County the second most populous county in [[California]]. The [[population density]] was 1,392/km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (3,606/sq&amp;nbsp;mi). There were 969,484 housing units at an average density of 474/km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (1,228/sq&amp;nbsp;mi). The racial makeup of the county was 64.8% [[White (U.S. Census)|White]], 13.6% [[Asian (U.S. Census)|Asian]], 1.7% [[African American (U.S. Census)|African American]], 0.7% [[Native American (U.S. Census)|Native American]], 0.3% [[Pacific Islander (U.S. Census)|Pacific Islander]], 14.8% from [[Race (United States Census)|other races]], and 4.1% from two or more races. 30.8% are [[Hispanic (U.S. Census)|Hispanic]] or [[Latino (U.S. Census)|Latino]] of any race. 8.9% were of [[german people|German]], 6.9% [[english people|English]] and 6.0% [[irish people|Irish]] ancestry according to [[Census 2000]]. 58.6% spoke only [[English language|English]] at home; 25.3% spoke [[Spanish language|Spanish]], 4.7% [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]], 1.9% [[Korean language|Korean]], 1.5% [[Chinese language|Chinese]] ([[Cantonese]] or [[Standard Mandarin|Mandarin]]) and 1.2% [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]].

Carona became eligible for his pension at age 50, and is also entitled, by law, to medical and dental benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Why Does Mike Carona Get a $200,000 Pension? | publisher = Orange County Register | date = August 21, 2013 | url = http://www.ocregister.com/articles/carona-173698-office-law.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Assembly Bill No. 1044 | publisher = Legislative Counsel: State of California | url = http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/pub/05-06/bill/asm/ab_1001-1050/ab_1044_bill_20050922_chaptered.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was noted that the county's retirement system faces a massive shortfall totaling $3.7 billion unfunded liabilities, and Carona was one of approximately 400 retired Orange County public servants who received more than $100,000 in benefits in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Lester |first=John |title=California Disgraced Sheriff Pension Retirement |url=http://www.newsoxy.com/world/disgraced-sheriff-pension-13760.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100716163500/http://www.newsoxy.com/world/disgraced-sheriff-pension-13760.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=July 16, 2010 |access-date=November 6, 2016 |work=newsoxy.com |date=July 12, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also on the list of those receiving extra-large pension checks is former treasurer-tax collector [[Robert Citron]], whose investments, which were made while consulting psychics and astrologers, led Orange County into bankruptcy in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Martinez |first=Edecio |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/disgraced-sheriffs-pension-215000-after-witness-tampering-conviction/ |title=Disgraced Sheriff's Pension $215,000 After Witness Tampering Conviction |publisher=CBS News |date=July 12, 2010 |access-date=January 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Citron, a Democrat, funneled billions of public dollars into questionable investments, and at first the returns were high and cities, schools and special districts borrowed millions to join in the investments.  But the strategy backfired, and Citron's investment pool lost $1.64 billion. Nearly $200 million had to be slashed from the county budget and more than 1,000 jobs were cut. The county was forced to borrow $1 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2013/01/17/obit-citron-orange-county-bankruptcy/1842401/|title=Man Blamed for Orange County Bankruptcy Dies|last=|first=|date=January 17, 2013|website=USA Today|access-date=February 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The California Foundation for Fiscal Responsibility filed a lawsuit against the pension system to get the list. The agency had claimed that pensioner privacy would be compromised by the release. A judge approved the release and the documents were released late June 2010.  The release of the documents has reopened debate on the pension plan for retired public safety workers approved in 2001 when Carona was sheriff.&lt;ref name="latimes.com"&gt;{{cite news |last=Esquivel |first=Paloma |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-oc-pension-20100709,0,5477333.story |title=Convicted Orange County sheriff collects $215,000 pension |work=latimes.com |date=July 9, 2010 |access-date=July 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Called "3 percent at 50," it lets deputies retire at age 50 with 3 percent of their highest year's pay for every year of service. Before it was approved and applied retroactively, employees received 2 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.porac.org/3percent@50.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20000830101102/http://www.porac.org/3percent@50.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=August 30, 2000 |title=Peace Officers Research Association of California |publisher=Porac.org |date= |access-date=July 22, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  "It was right after [[September 11 attacks|Sept. 11]]," said Orange County Supervisor [[John Moorlach]]. "All of a sudden, public safety people became elevated to god status. The Board of Supervisors were tripping over themselves to make the motion."  He called it "one of the biggest shifts of money from the private sector to the public sector."  Moorlach, who was not on the board when the plan was approved, led the fight to repeal the benefit. A lawsuit, which said the benefit should go before voters, was rejected in Los Angeles County Superior Court in 2009 and is now under appeal.&lt;ref name="latimes.com"/&gt;  Carona opposed the lawsuit when it was filed, likening its filing to a "nuclear bomb" for deputies.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

==Politics==
Orange County has long been known as a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] stronghold and has consistently sent Republican representatives to the state and federal legislatures. 

In [[United States presidential election in California, 1936|1936]] Orange County gave [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] a majority of its presidential vote. The Republican nominee won Orange County in the next 19 presidential elections, until [[Hillary Clinton]] won the county with a majority in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ocvote.com/fileadmin/live/gen2016/results.htm|title=2016 Presidential General Election|website=Ocvote.com|access-date=2016-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-me-oc-clinton-20161109-story.html|title=Hillary Clinton turned Orange County blue.

Republican majorities in Orange County helped deliver California's electoral votes to Republican nominees [[Richard Nixon]] in 1960, 1968 and 1972, [[Gerald Ford]] in 1976, [[Ronald Reagan]] in 1980 and 1984, and [[George H. W. Bush]] in 1988. As a measure of how Republican Orange County was during this period, it was one of only five counties in the state that voted for [[Barry Goldwater]] in 1964.

The Republican margin began to narrow in the 1990s and 2000s as the state trended Democratic, until, in the [[California elections, 2018|2018 midterm elections]], the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] gained control of all seven Congressional districts in the county, including all four districts entirely in the county.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hannon |first1=Elliot |title=Democrat Declared Winner in Orange County House Race, Marking a Clean Democratic Sweep of the Onetime Conservative Stronghold |url=https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/11/democrat-cisneros-young-kim-winner-flip-orange-county-house-congress-race-sweep.html |website=Slate |publisher=The Washington Post Group |accessdate=18 November 2018 |archiveurl=https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/11/democrat-cisneros-young-kim-winner-flip-orange-county-house-congress-race-sweep.html |archivedate=19 November 2018 |language=English |quote=Democrat Declared Winner in Orange County House Race, Marking a Clean Democratic Sweep of the Onetime Conservative Stronghold  By Elliot Hannon Nov 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This prompted media outlets to declare Orange County dead, with the [[Los Angeles Times]] writing an obituary for the “old Orange County.”&lt;ref name="ARELLANO"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-arellano-orange-county-obit-20181107-story.html |title=An obituary for old Orange County, dead at age 129 |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|first=GUSTAVO |last=ARELLANO

For the [[115th United States Congress]] in the [[United States House of Representatives]], Orange County is split between seven congressional districts:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

The 39th, 45th, 46th, and 48th districts are all centered in Orange County. The 38th and 47th have their population centers in Los Angeles County, while the 49th is primarily San Diego County-based.

In the [[California State Senate]], Orange County is split into 5 districts:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

According to the Orange County Registrar of Voters, as of May 21, 2012, Orange County had 1,612,145 registered voters.{{cn|date=September 2018}} Of these, 42.17% (679,877) were registered Republicans, and 31.41% (506,389) registered Democrats. An additional 22.01% (354,820) declined to state a political party.

Orange County has produced such notable Republicans as President [[Richard Nixon]] (born in [[Yorba Linda, California|Yorba Linda]] and lived in [[Fullerton, California|Fullerton]] and [[San Clemente, California|San Clemente]]), U.S. Senator [[John F. Seymour]] (previously [[mayor of Anaheim, California]]), and U.S. Senator [[Thomas Kuchel]] (of Anaheim). Former Congressman [[Christopher Cox]] (of Newport Beach), a White House counsel for President Reagan, is also a former chairman of the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]]. Orange County was also home to former Republican Congressman [[John G. Schmitz]], a presidential candidate in 1972 from the ultra-conservative [[American Independent Party]] and the father of [[Mary Kay Letourneau]]. In 1996, [[Curt Pringle]] (later mayor of Anaheim) became the first Republican Speaker of the [[California State Assembly]] in decades.

While the growth of the county's [[Hispanic]] and [[Asian people|Asian]] populations in recent decades has significantly influenced Orange County's culture, its conservative reputation has remained largely intact. Partisan voter registration patterns of Hispanics, Asians and other ethnic minorities in the county have tended to reflect the surrounding demographics, with resultant Republican majorities in all but the central portion of the county. When [[Loretta Sanchez]], a [[Blue Dog Coalition|Blue Dog Democrat]], defeated veteran Republican [[Bob Dornan]] in 1996, she was continuing a trend of Democratic representation of that district that had been interrupted by Dornan's 1984 upset of former Congressman [[Jerry M. Patterson|Jerry Patterson]]. Until 1992, Sanchez herself was a moderate Republican, and she is viewed as somewhat more moderate than other Democrats from Southern California.

Republicans have responded to the influx of nonwhite immigrants by making more explicit efforts to court the Hispanic and Asian vote. In 2004, [[George W. Bush]] captured 60% of the county's vote, up from 56% in 2000 despite a higher Democratic popular vote statewide. Although [[Barbara Boxer]] won statewide, and fared better in Orange County than she did in 1998, Republican [[Bill Jones (California politician)|Bill Jones]] defeated her in the county, 51% to 43%. While the 39% that [[John Kerry]] received is higher than the percentage [[Bill Clinton]] won in 1992 or 1996, the percentage of the vote George W. Bush received in 2004 (60%) is the highest any presidential candidate has received since 1988, showing a still-dominant GOP presence in the county. In 2006, Senator [[Dianne Feinstein]] won 45% of the vote in the county, the best showing of a Democrat in a Senate race in over four decades, but Orange was nevertheless the only [[Coastal California]] county to vote for her Republican opponent, [[Dick Mountjoy]]. In terms of voter registration, the Democratic Party has a plurality or majority of registrations only in Buena Park, Laguna Beach, Santa Ana and Stanton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/ror/ror-pages/15day-general-12/politicalsub1.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-11-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121107211425/http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/ror/ror-pages/15day-general-12/politicalsub1.pdf |archivedate=November 7, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The county is featured prominently in Lisa McGirr's book ''Suburban Warriors: The Origins of the New American Right''. She argues that the its conservative political orientation in the 20th century owed much to its settlement by farmers from the [[Great Plains]], who reacted strongly to communist sympathies, the [[civil rights movement]], and the turmoil of the 1960s in nearby Los Angeles — across the "[[Orange Curtain]]".

In the 1970s and 1980s, Orange County was one of California's leading Republican voting blocs and a subculture of residents with "Middle American" values that emphasized capitalist religious morality{{clarify|date=November 2012}} in contrast to [[San Francisco values|West coast liberalism]].

Orange County has many Republican voters from culturally conservative [[Asian American|Asian-American]], [[Middle Eastern]] and Latino immigrant groups. The large [[Vietnamese American|Vietnamese-American]] communities in [[Garden Grove, California|Garden Grove]] and [[Westminster, California|Westminster]] are predominantly Republican; Vietnamese Americans registered Republicans outnumber those registered as Democrats, 55% to 22%. Republican Assemblyman [[Van Tran]] was the first Vietnamese-American elected to a state legislature and joined with Texan [[Hubert Vo]] as the highest-ranking elected Vietnamese-American in the United States until the 2008 election of [[Joseph Cao]] in [[Louisiana's 2nd congressional district]]. In the 2007 special election for the vacant county supervisor seat following Democrat [[Lou Correa]]'s election to the state senate, two Vietnamese-American Republican candidates topped the list of 10 candidates, separated from each other by only seven votes, making the [[Orange County Board of Supervisors]] entirely Republican; Correa is the sole Democrat to have served on the Board since 1987 and only the fifth since 1963.

===Major highways===
[[File:So Cal Coastline photo D Ramey Logan.jpg|thumb|State Route 1 winds down the Orange County Coastline over Corona Del Mar state Beach]]
Ground transportation in Orange County relies heavily on three major interstate highways: the [[Santa Ana Freeway]] (I-5), the [[Interstate 405 (California)|San Diego Freeway]] (I-405 and [[Interstate 5 in California|I-5]] south of Irvine), and the [[San Gabriel River Freeway]] ([[Interstate 605 (California)|I-605]]), which only briefly enters Orange County territory in the northwest. The other freeways in the county are state highways, and include the perpetually congested [[Riverside Freeway|Riverside]] and [[Artesia Freeway]] ([[California State Route 91|SR 91]]) and the [[Garden Grove Freeway]] ([[California State Route 22|SR 22]]) running east-west, and the [[Orange Freeway]] ([[California State Route 57|SR 57]]), the [[Costa Mesa Freeway]] ([[California State Route 55|SR/SR 55]]), the Laguna Freeway ([[California State Route 133|SR 133]]), the [[San Joaquin Hills Toll Road|San Joaquin Transportation Corridor]] ([[California State Route 73|SR 73]]), the [[Eastern Toll Road (California)|Eastern Transportation Corridor]] ([[California State Route 261|SR 261]], [[California State Route 133|SR 133]], [[California State Route 241|SR 241]]), and the [[Foothill Toll Road|Foothill Transportation Corridor]] ([[California State Route 241|SR 241]]) running north-south. Minor stub freeways include the Richard M. Nixon Freeway (SR 90), also known as Imperial Highway, and the southern terminus of Pacific Coast Highway (SR 1). There are no [[United States Numbered Highways|U.S. Highways]] in Orange County, though two existed in the county until the mid-1960s: [[U.S. Route 91|91]] and [[U.S. Route 101|101]]. 91 went through what is now the state route of the same number, and 101 was replaced by Interstate 5. SR-1 was once a bypass of US-101 (Route 101A).

[[Metrolink (Southern California)|Metrolink]] also began offering weekend service on the Orange County Line and the Inland Empire-Orange County line in the summer of 2006. As ridership has steadily increased in the region, new stations have opened at Anaheim Canyon, [[Buena Park, California|Buena Park]], [[Tustin, California|Tustin]], and [[Laguna Niguel, California|Laguna Niguel]]/[[Mission Viejo, California|Mission Viejo]]. Plans for a future station in [[Placentia, California|Placentia]] are underway and is expected to be completed by 2014.

Since 1938, the [[Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe Railroad]] and later Amtrak, has operated the ''[[Pacific Surfliner]]'' regional [[passenger train]] route (previously named the ''[[San Diegan (train)|San Diegan]]'' until 2000)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| publisher=Trainweb| title=Amtrak Surfliner Inaugural Celebration - June 1, 2000| url=http://www.trainweb.com/routes/route_ps/2000f01a.html| accessdate=December 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; through Orange County.

A car and passenger ferry service, the [[Balboa Island Ferry]], comprising three ferries running every five minutes, operates within Newport Harbor between Balboa Peninsula and [[Balboa Island, Newport Beach, California|Balboa Island]] in [[Newport Beach, California|Newport Beach]].  The [[Catalina Flyer]] connects the Balboa Peninsula to [[Avalon, California|Avalon]] with daily round-trip passage through about nine months of the year.  The [[Catalina Express]] connects [[Dana Point, California|Dana Point]] to Avalon (with departures from two greater [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]] ports also connecting to [[Two Harbors, California|Two Harbors]]).

===Air===
Orange County's only major airport is [[John Wayne Airport]]. Although its abbreviation (SNA) refers to Santa Ana, the airport is in fact located in unincorporated territory surrounded by the cities of Newport Beach, Costa Mesa, and Irvine. Unincorporated Orange County (including the John Wayne Airport) has mailing addresses, which go through the Santa Ana Post Office. For this reason, SNA was chosen as the IATA Code for the airport.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} The actual Destination Moniker which appears on most Arrival/Departure Monitors in airports throughout the United States is "Orange County", which is the common nickname used for the [[Office of Management and Budget|OMB]] Metropolitan Designation: [[Santa Ana-Anaheim-Irvine, California]]. Its modern [[Thomas F. Riley]] Terminal handles over 9 million passengers annually through 14 different airlines.

[[File:Anaheim-streetbanners-ducksangels.JPG|thumb|250px|Street banners promoting the county's two major league teams, the Ducks and the Angels.]]

The [[Major League Baseball]] team in Orange County is the [[Los Angeles Angels]].  The team won the World Series under manager Mike Scioscia in 2002.  In 2005, new owner
Arte Moreno wanted to change the name to "Los Angeles Angels" in order to better tap into the Los Angeles media market, the second largest in the country. However, the standing agreement with the city of Anaheim demanded that they have "Anaheim" in the name, so they became the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim. This name change was hotly disputed by the city of Anaheim, but the change stood and still stands today, which [[City of Anaheim v. Angels Baseball LP|prompted a lawsuit]] by the city of Anaheim against Angels owner [[Arte Moreno]], won by Moreno.

The county's [[National Hockey League]] team, the [[Anaheim Ducks]], won the 2007 [[Stanley Cup]] beating the [[Ottawa Senators]].  They also came close to winning the 2003 [[Stanley Cup]] finals after losing in Game 7 against the [[New Jersey Devils]].

The Toshiba Classic, the only PGA Champions Tour event in the area, is held each March at The Newport Beach Country Club.  Past champions include Fred Couples (2010), Hale Irwin (1998 and 2002), Nick Price (2011), Bernhard Langer (2008) and Jay Haas (2007).  The tournament benefits the Hoag Hospital Foundation and has raised over $16 million in its first 16 years.

[[Orange County SC]] is a [[United Soccer League]] team and are the only professional soccer club in Orange County. The team's first season was in 2011 and it was successful as [[Charlie Naimo]]'s team made it to the quarter-finals of the playoffs. With home games played at Championship Soccer Stadium in [[Orange County Great Park]] the team looks to grow in the Orange County community and reach continued success. Former and current Orange County SC players include [[Richard Chaplow]], [[Bright Dike]], [[Maykel Galindo]], [[Carlos Borja (American soccer)|Carlos Borja]], and goalkeeper [[Amir Abedzadeh]].

The [[National Football League]] football left the county when the [[Los Angeles Rams]] relocated to [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] in 1995. [[Anaheim]] city leaders are in talks with the NFL to bring a Los Angeles-area franchise to Orange County, though they are competing with other cities in and around Los Angeles.
The [[Los Angeles Clippers]] played some home games at The Arrowhead Pond, now known as the [[Honda Center]], from 1994 to 1999, before moving to [[Staples Center]], which they share with the [[Los Angeles Lakers]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1513">A '''person in need of supervision''' (PINS) is a term frequently used by [[social services]] agencies in the [[United States]] to describe a [[juvenile (law)|juvenile]] who is not currently in the household of a parent or [[legal guardian]], or is currently not under their control as evidenced by the person's [[status offense]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.liftonline.org/pdf/PINS%202.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-06-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070729052801/http://www.liftonline.org/pdf/PINS%202.pdf |archivedate=2007-07-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; who is not an [[emancipated minor]]. The term is often abbreviated PINS. Usually, a person in need of supervision is a [[runaway youth|runaway]], an [[orphan]], a [[truant]], or an unruly child.

The term is most commonly used as a term of art in [[New York (state)|New York]] in the [[United States]], where the term is used in a key [[statute]] governing the treatment of juveniles. [[Hawaii]] also has the term in its statutes. [[Virginia]] has a similar designation which it calls "child in need of supervision" (CHINS), not to be confused with the broader designation "child in need of services" (also abbreviated "CHINS"), the "services" in which may be disciplinary/supervisory (due to the child's misbehavior) or assistive (due to parental neglect or abuse).

'''''Red Sea Insurance Co Ltd v Bouygues SA''''' [1995] 1 AC 190 is a judicial decision of the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council|Privy Council]] relating to [[choice of law]] in [[tort]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=[[Dicey Morris &amp; Collins]]|edition=15th|year=2012|isbn=978-0-414-02453-3|author=[[Lawrence Collins, Baron Collins of Mapesbury|Lawrence Collins]]|at=35-007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The  case was an appeal from the decision of the [[Court of Appeal (Hong Kong)|Court of Appeal of Hong Kong]], but as the case was decided in Hong Kong pursuant to the English Law Ordinance, section 3(1),&lt;ref&gt;Which provides "The common law and the rules of equity shall be in force in Hong Kong..."&lt;/ref&gt; it is also taken to be an authoritative statement of [[English law]].

==Facts==

Bouygues SA together with nine other co-plaintiffs made a claim under a policy of insurance against Red Sea Insurance Co Ltd.  Red Sea Insurance was an insurance company incorporated in Hong Kong, but with its head office located in Saudi Arabia.  In its counterclaim Red Sea Insurance alleged that one of the co-plaintiffs, PCG, negligently supplied faulty pre-cast concrete building units, and that if it was liable at all, Red Sea Insurance would be [[subrogation|subrogated]] to the claims of the other co-plaintiffs against PCG.  PCG applied to strike out that counterclaim.&lt;ref name=DMC&gt;{{Cite book|title=[[Dicey Morris &amp; Collins]]|edition=15th|year=2012|isbn=978-0-414-02453-3|author=[[Lawrence Collins, Baron Collins of Mapesbury|Lawrence Collins]]|at=35-007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Red Sea then amended its pleading and claimed that the [[proper law]] governing the relations between Red Sea and PCG was the law of Saudi Arabia, and that under Saudi Arabian law, Red Sea had a direct right of action against PCG.  

Those claims failed at first instance and in the Court of Appeal because:
* under Hong Kong law the right of action could only arise by way of subrogation once the claim had been paid under the policy of insurance; 
* in order succeed in their amended counterclaim Red Sea needed to establish that they had a right of action under both Saudi Arabian law and Hong Kong law to satisfy the [[double actionability]] test; 
* even though they had a good arguable case that there was a cause of action in tort under Saudi law, because they claim failed under Hong Kong law, it failed the dual actionability test, and therefore the claim was struck out.

Red Sea appealed to the Privy Council.

==Decision==

[[Gordon Slynn, Baron Slynn of Hadley|Lord Slynn of Hadley]] gave the decision of the board.

After reviewing the relevant authorities Lord Slynn held that the "flexible exception" to the double actionability requirement which had been created by the [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]] in ''[[Boys v Chaplin]]'' [1971] AC 356 could apply in favour of not only the forum (the ''[[lex fori]]'') but also in favour of the law of the place where the tort occurred (the ''[[lex loci delicti commissi]]'').  In this case the facts were overwhelmingly connected with Saudi Arabia, and so Saudi Arabian law only should be applied to the relevant issue.&lt;ref name=DMC /&gt;

Lord Slynn further held that although ''Boys v Chaplin'' was predicated on a single issue (heads of loss) being subject to the flexible exception, it was possible that an entire claim could be subject to the exception.  He stated: "The present appeal is not based on an isolated issue (as was the case in ''Boys v Chaplin'').  The contention put forward is that the whole case be decided according to the lex loci delictii.  Although the cases may be rare where the exception should be applied the whole case, their Lordships do not consider that to apply the exception to the whole case is in principle necessarily excluded.  In their Lordship's view the exception is not limited to specific isolated issues but may apply to the whole claim".&lt;ref&gt;[1995] 1 AC 190 at 207A-B&lt;/ref&gt;

==Authority==

In England the decision was followed by the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]] in ''Pearce v Ove Arup Partnership Ltd'' [2000] Ch 403, it has now largely been superseded by the [[Private International Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1995]].  However, it remains good law in other [[common law jurisdictions]], and in England for claims relating to [[defamation]].

In Canada, the double actionability rule itself was reversed by the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] in ''[[Tolofson v Jensen]]'' [1994] 3 SCR 1022, although the Supreme Court retained the concept of a flexible exception.

Similarly, in Australia the double actionability rule was abrogated by the [[High Court of Australia]] in ''[[John Pfieffer Pty Ltd v Rogerson]]'' (2000) 203 CLR 503.  But similarly, a broad public policy style flexible exception similar to that in ''Red Sea Insurance v Bouygues SA'' was retained.&lt;Ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sydney.edu.au/law/slr/slr30_3/Gray.pdf|title=Getting It Right: Where is the Place of the Wrong in a Multinational Torts Case?|publisher=Sydney Law Review|author=|accessdate=30 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Royal Commission on the Constitution''', also referred to as the '''Kilbrandon Commission''' (initially the '''Crowther Commission''') or '''Kilbrandon Report''', was a long-running [[royal commission]] set up by [[Harold Wilson]]'s [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] government to examine the structures of the [[constitution of the United Kingdom]] and the [[British Islands]] and the government of [[countries of the United Kingdom|its constituent countries]], and to consider whether any changes should be made to those structures. It was started under [[Geoffrey Crowther, Baron Crowther|Lord Crowther]] on 15 April 1969, [[Charles Shaw, Baron Kilbrandon|Lord Kilbrandon]] took over in 1972, and it finally reported on 31 October 1973.&lt;ref&gt;''Royal Commission on the Constitution 1969 – 1973'', Volume I, Report (Cmnd 5460)&lt;/ref&gt;

Various models of [[devolution]], [[federalism]] and [[Confederation|confederalism]] were considered, as well as the prospect of the division of the UK into separate [[sovereign states]]. [[Northern Ireland]], the [[Channel Islands]] and the [[Isle of Man]] were dealt with separately from the core issue of [[Scotland]] and [[Wales]].

A total of 16 volumes of evidence and 10 research papers were published between 1969 and 1973. The final report was delivered to [[Edward Heath]]'s [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] [[Conservative Government 1970–1974|Government]], which had come to power at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1970|general election in June 1970]]. The report rejected the options of independence or [[federalism]], in favour of devolved, directly elected [[Scottish Assembly|Scottish]] and [[Welsh Assembly|Welsh]] [[Deliberative assembly|assemblies]]. Two members of the Commission, [[Norman Crowther Hunt, Baron Crowther-Hunt|Lord Crowther-Hunt]] and [[Professor Alan Peacock]], did not sign the report, disagreeing with the interpretation of the terms of reference and the conclusions. Their views were published in a separate Memorandum of Dissent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bopcris.ac.uk/bopall/ref14465.html | title=Royal Commission on the Constitution 1969–73: volume II: memorandum of dissent by Lord Crowther-Hunt and Professor A.T.

==Background==
The royal commission was set up in response to growing demands for [[home rule]] or full independence for [[Wales]] and [[Scotland]], which came into public focus after the ground-breaking [[UK by-elections|by-election]] wins of [[Plaid Cymru]]'s [[Gwynfor Evans]] at the [[Carmarthen by-election, 1966]], and the [[Scottish National Party]]'s [[Winnie Ewing]] in [[Hamilton by-election, 1967|Hamilton in 1967]].

* To consider also whether any changes are desirable in the constitutional and economic relationships between the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man.&lt;ref name=timespw&gt;Political will for separation "does not exist", ''The Times'', 1 November 1973&lt;/ref&gt;

}}

==Proposals==
The commission was unable to reach unanimous agreement, with the final report including a number of options supported by different members. Two commissioners did not sign the report, producing instead a ''memorandum of dissent''.

===Scotland===
{{main article|Scottish Assembly}}
Eight members favoured a [[Scottish Assembly|devolved legislature]] for [[Scotland]]. Executive power would be exercised by ministers appointed by the Crown from members of a directly elected assembly. Areas of responsibility to be transferred to the devolved body would be some of those already under the supervision of the [[Secretary of State for Scotland]] and the [[Lord Advocate]]. These included:
*Education
*The environment
*Health
*Home affairs
*Legal matters
*Social services

Responsibility for agriculture, fisheries and food would be divided between the Assembly and the United Kingdom government, while the latter would retain control of electricity supply.

With the establishment of the devolved government, it was proposed that the number of [[member of parliament|MPs]] elected to [[Scottish Westminster constituencies|Westminster from Scottish constituencies]] would be reduced from 71 to about 51.

The assembly was to be a single chamber body of about 100 members, elected under the [[single transferable vote]] system of [[proportional representation]], with multi-member constituencies. The Commission did not propose to give the assembly a name, feeling this was a matter for the Scottish people, although the term "convention" had been suggested. The determination of the number of seats and boundaries was to be reserved to the [[United Kingdom parliament]].

The new constitutional arrangements would not require the appointment of a governor, while the title "Scottish Premier" was suggested for the head of the executive.

The [[office of Secretary of State for Scotland]] would be abolished, although a [[cabinet minister]] would continue to have special responsibility in representing Scotland as well as having other duties.&lt;ref name="timeskil"&gt;Kilbrandon Report, ''The Times'', 1 November 1973&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wales===
Six commissioners favoured legislative devolution for Wales. This would be similar to the scheme envisaged for Scotland, but with less responsibility in legal affairs, reflecting that Scotland had a discrete legal system separate from England and Wales.

As in Scotland, a 100-member unicameral assembly was proposed, elected by proportional representation. A title suggested to the commission for the body was "Senate". Similarly, the head of the executive might be titled "Welsh Premier", and the office of [[Secretary of State for Wales]] would be abolished. The number of Westminster MPs elected by Welsh constituencies would be reduced from 36 to about 31.&lt;ref name="timeskil"/&gt;

===England===
The signatories to the main report were unanimous in their opposition of legislative devolution to England as a whole, or to any English region. There were however proposals for some powers being devolved to regional level:
*Eight members supported the idea of non-executive co-ordinating and advisory councils to make representations and give advice to central government on government policy effecting the regions. Each council was to have about 60 members, the majority elected by local authorities in the region with about 20% nominated by the minister responsible for regional affairs to represent industry, agriculture, commerce, trade unions, and statutory promotional bodies in the region.
*Two members favoured the establishment of regional assemblies with executive powers, elected in a similar manner to those in Scotland and Wales.

In each case the regions to be used were to be those already established for economic planning, with boundaries adjusted to reflect the changes made by the [[Local Government Act 1972]], although names were not suggested:
#[[Cleveland (county)|Cleveland]], Cumbria, [[County Durham|Durham]], Northumberland, [[Tyne and Wear]]
#[[Humberside]], North Yorkshire, [[South Yorkshire]], West Yorkshire
#[[Cheshire]], Greater Manchester, [[Merseyside]], Lancashire
#[[Derbyshire]], Leicestershire, [[Lincolnshire]], Northamptonshire, [[Nottinghamshire]]
#[[Hereford and Worcester]], [[Shropshire|Salop]], Staffordshire, [[Warwickshire]], West Midlands
#[[Cambridgeshire]], Norfolk, [[Suffolk]]
#[[Avon (county)|Avon]], Cornwall, [[Devon]], Dorset, [[Gloucestershire]], Somerset, [[Wiltshire]]
#[[Bedfordshire]], Berkshire, [[Buckinghamshire]], East Sussex, [[Essex]], Greater London, [[Hampshire]], Hertfordshire, [[Isle of Wight]], Kent, [[Oxfordshire]], Surrey, [[West Sussex]]

====Cornwall====
The Commission recognised that "a very small minority" in [[Cornwall]] existed that claimed a separate national identity for the [[Cornish people]], and who wished to have separate arrangements for their government. They however felt that "despite its individual character and strong sense of regional identity, there is no evidence that its people have a wish to see it separated for the purposes of government from the rest of England". However they recognised that "the people of Cornwall regard their part of the United Kingdom as not just another English county" and accordingly they recommended that the designation "Duchy of Cornwall" be used on all appropriate occasions to emphasise the "special relationship and the territorial integrity of Cornwall".&lt;ref name="timeskil"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmselect/cmodpm/977/977we20.htm Kilbrandon Report paragraph 329 Quoted in Memorandum by the National Executive Committee of Mebyon Kernow, the Party for Cornwall (Written Evidence given to the Select Committee on Office of the Deputy Prime Minister: Housing, Planning, Local Government and the Regions)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Northern Ireland===
The Commission did not make any recommendations on devolution in [[Northern Ireland]], for which the [[Northern Ireland Constitution Act 1973]] had made provision. However, the report did recommend that the number of Westminster MPs from the province be increased in line with the rest of the UK, from 12 to about 17.

===Channel Islands and the Isle of Man===
The Commission did not propose to make any changes in the relationship between the United Kingdom, the [[Channel Islands]] and the [[Isle of Man]]. They rejected a suggestion that responsibilities for external affairs be divided between the UK and island governments, but supported a [[Home Office]] proposal that a more formal process of consultation be carried out in future over the application of international agreements in the islands.

==Memorandum of dissent==
Lord Crowther-Hunt and Professor Peacock did not sign the report, producing a separate series of proposals in a minority memorandum. The main differences between the document and the main report were:

===Regional assemblies===
There would be seven elected regional assemblies, one for Scotland, one for Wales and five [[Regional Assemblies in England]]. They would have considerably greater powers than proposed in the majority report, taking over much of the [[machinery of central government]] within their area, and each having their own civil service. They would also replace ad hoc authorities such as regional health authorities and water authorities, which were due to be introduced in reorganisation of the [[National Health Service]] and water industry. They would also have supervisory powers over gas and electricity boards. They would also be able to make policy through strategic plans for the physical, social and economic development of their regions.

A Minister for the Regions would hold a cabinet seat.

===Commons reform===
The memorandum also suggested changes in the function of the [[United Kingdom House of Commons]]. Members of parliament were to form "functional committees" corresponding to central government departments. Each committee was to have a supporting staff and would consider the implications of both United Kingdom and European legislation, as well as having policy-making powers. To reflect their greater responsibilities, MPs would be paid full-time professional salaries.

==Political reaction==
There was mixed reaction to the Commission's report:
*The chairman of [[Plaid Cymru]] regarded it as a "real breakthrough", and called for the government to provide a commitment to introduce a Welsh government with legislative power. However, they called for the assembly to have additional powers over economic and industrial planning.
*[[Winifred Ewing]], vice-chairman of the [[Scottish National Party]], described it as a "step in the right direction", and that the proposed [[Scottish assembly]] "would lead to the self-government the SNP sought".
*The secretary of the Welsh Labour Party welcomed the introduction of an assembly, but opposed the reduction in the number of Westminster MPs.
*The leader of the Welsh Liberal Party believed it to be a "major breakthrough" which would lead to proportional representation being introduced in Westminster.
*An official of the Welsh Conservative Party called for people not to be "over-influenced by the vocal minority, which includes extremists and nationalist fanatics."
*The chairman of the Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party expressed doubts about the reduction in the number of MPs.
*The secretary of [[Mebyon Kernow]], while noting that their proposal for a Cornish Regional Council had been rejected, said they were encouraged by the establishment of assemblies in Scotland and Wales, and the emphasis on the "Duchy of Cornwall".&lt;ref&gt;Generally favourable response among Welsh and Scots political leaders, ''The Times'', 1 November 1973&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consequences==
Following a change of government at the [[United Kingdom general election, February 1974|February 1974 election]], the new Labour administration published a [[white paper]] ''[[Democracy and Devolution: Proposals for Scotland and Wales]]'' based on the final report in September 1974. The white paper led directly to the unsuccessful [[Scotland and Wales Bill]], which was withdrawn in February 1977. Two separate pieces of legislation were passed in the following year: the [[Scotland Act 1978]] and the [[Wales Act 1978]]. The provisions of the Acts would not come into force unless approved by [[referendum]]s, and accordingly [[1979 Scottish devolution referendum|Scottish]] and [[1979 Welsh devolution referendum|Welsh]] devolution referendums were held on 1 March 1979. The Welsh assembly was rejected by a majority of voters, while Scottish devolution was supported by 51.6% of those voting, or 32.9% of those on the electoral register. An amendment to the Scotland Act, introduced by government backbencher [[George Cunningham (MP)|George Cunningham]], had specified that it must have the support of 40% of the entire electorate, and the referendum was lost.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/events/scotland_99/the_scottish_parliament/306859.stm ''Breaking up is hard to do'', BBC News, retrieved August 8, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; The results of the referendums led to the [[repeal]] of the respective Acts in March 1979. A vote of no confidence was subsequently lost by the government on 28 March when the Scottish National Party voted with the Conservatives, Liberals and Ulster Unionist Party, leading to the [[United Kingdom general election, 1979|general election of 1979]] and the beginning of 18 years of Conservative rule.

Scottish and Welsh devolution was finally implemented under the next Labour government, elected in 1997, by the [[Scotland Act 1998]] and the [[Government of Wales Act 1998]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28701">'''Seasteading''' is the concept of creating permanent dwellings at sea, called seasteads, outside the territory claimed by any government. The term is a combination of the words ''sea'' and ''[[Homestead principle|homesteading]]''. No one has yet created a structure on the [[high seas]] that has been recognized as a [[sovereign state]].

Seasteaders say such autonomous floating cities would foster faster development of techniques "to feed the hungry, cure the sick, clean the atmosphere and enrich the poor".&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Some critics fear seasteads are designed more as a refuge for the wealthy to avoid taxes or other problems.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jan/02/seasteading-peter-thiel-french-polynesia Guardian: "Seasteading: tech leaders' plans for floating city trouble French Polynesians"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.crikey.com.au/2017/01/19/razer-seasteading-institute-a-taxless-safe-space-for-rich-men/Helen Razer: "Rich, white finance sector men build their own 'safe space' on a floating tax haven"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Proposed structures have included modified [[cruise ship]]s, refitted [[oil platform]]s, decommissioned anti-aircraft platforms, and custom-built floating islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

As an intermediate step, the [[Seasteading Institute]] has promoted cooperation with an existing nation on prototype floating islands with legal semi-autonomy within the nation's protected territorial waters.  On January 13, 2017, the Seasteading Institute signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with [[French Polynesia]] to create the first semi-autonomous "seazone" for a prototype&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web

==History==
Many architects and firms have created designs for floating cities, including [[Vincent Callebaut]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vincent.callebaut.org/page1-img-lilypad.html|title=Vincent Callebaut Architecte LILYPAD|work=callebaut.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archinect.com/forum/threads.php?id=76356_0_42_0_C|title=LILYPAD feature|work=archinect.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paolo Soleri]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2008/aug/25/architecture.ethicalliving|title=The man who saw the future|last=Rose|first=Steve|date=August 25, 2008|work=The Guardian|location=London|accessdate=May 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and companies such as Shimizu and E. Kevin Schopfer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.treehugger.com/galleries/2011/02/12-post-apocalypse-floating-cities-and-homes-from-crazy-concepts-to-reality.php?page=5|title=12 Post-Apocalypse Floating Cities and Homes: From Crazy Concepts to Reality|work=TreeHugger}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[L. Ron Hubbard]], founder of the [[Church of Scientology]], and his executive leadership became a maritime-based community named the Sea Organization ([[Sea Org]]).  Beginning in 1967 with a complement of four ships, the Sea Org spent most of its existence on the high seas, visiting ports around the world for refueling and resupply. In 1975 much of these operations were shifted to land-based locations.

[[Marshall Savage]] discussed building tethered [[artificial island]]s in his 1992 book [[The Millennial Project: Colonizing the Galaxy in Eight Easy Steps]], with several color plates illustrating his ideas.

Other historical predecessors and inspirations for seasteading include:
* Ocean-going cruise ships, often described as "[[walking city#Floating cities|floating cities]]".
* [[Oil platform]]s.
* The [[Principality of Sealand]], a [[micronation]] formed on a decommissioned sea fort near [[Suffolk]], [[England]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/finance/2008/0919/1221689998534.html|title=Explorers in the Valley still charting new territory|date=19 September 2008|work=The Irish Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Smaller [[floating island]]s in protected waters, such as Richart Sowa's [[Spiral Island]] 
* Floating communities, such as the [[Uru people]] on  [[Lake Titicaca]], the [[Tanka people]] in [[Aberdeen, Hong Kong]], and the [[Makoko]] in Lagos, Nigeria. 
* The non-profit [[Women on Waves]], which operates hospital ships that allow access to abortions for women in countries where abortions are subject to strict laws 
* The [[Republic of Rose Island]], a short-lived micronation on a man-made platform in the Adriatic Sea, 11 kilometres (6.8 mi) off the coast of the province of Rimini, Italy.
* [[Pirate radio]] stations anchored in international waters, but broadcasting to listeners on shore.    
At least two people independently coined the term seasteading: Ken Neumeyer in his book ''Sailing the Farm'' (1981) and Wayne Gramlich in his article "Seasteading – Homesteading on the High Seas" (1998).&lt;ref name="gramlich"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gramlich.net/projects/oceania/seastead1.html|title=SeaSteading -- Homesteading the High Seas|work=gramlich.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gramlich’s essay attracted the attention of [[Patri Friedman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/magazine/seasteading-the-great-escape|title=Seasteading: the great escape|last=Fingleton|first=Eamonn|date=March 26, 2010|website=|publisher=Prospect Magazine|access-date=2017-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two began working together and posted their first collaborative book online in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gramlich.net/projects/oceania/seastead2/|title=Getting Serious About SeaSteading|last=Gramlich|first=Wayne|last2=Friedman|first2=Patri|date=2002|website=|publisher=|others=Andrew House|access-date=2017-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Their book explored many aspects of seasteading from waste disposal to [[flags of convenience]].  This collaboration led to the creation of the non-profit The Seasteading Institute (TSI) in 2008.

==The Seasteading Institute==
[[Image:stead.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The Seasteading Institute's "ClubStead"]]

On April 15, 2008, Wayne Gramlich and [[Patri Friedman]] founded the [[501(c)(3) organization|501(c)(3) non-profit]] The Seasteading Institute (TSI), an organization formed to facilitate the establishment of autonomous, mobile communities on seaborne platforms operating in [[international waters]].&lt;ref name="wired20090119"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wired.com/techbiz/startups/magazine/17-02/mf_seasteading|title=Live Free or Drown: Floating Utopias on the Cheap|accessdate=2009-01-19|publisher=Wired Magazine|date=January 19, 2009|last=Baker|first=Chris}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TSI"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://seasteading.org/about-tsi/history|title=History}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cities on the Ocean in The Economist"&gt;{{cite news|title=Cities on the Ocean|url=http://www.economist.com/technology-quarterly/2011-12-03|accessdate=6 December 2011|newspaper=The Economist|date=3 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Friedman and Gramlich noted that according to the [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea]], a country's [[Exclusive Economic Zone]] extends {{convert|200|nmi|km}} from shore. Beyond that boundary lie the [[International waters|high seas]], which are not subject to the laws of any sovereign state other than the [[flag of convenience|flag]] under which a ship sails. They proposed that a seastead could take advantage of the absence of laws and regulations outside the sovereignty of nations to experiment with new governance systems, and allow the citizens of existing governments to exit more easily.

"When seasteading becomes a viable alternative, switching from one government to another would be a matter of sailing to the other without even leaving your house," said Patri Friedman at the first annual Seasteading conference.&lt;ref name="wired20090119" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/science/planetearth/news/2008/05/seasteading?currentPage=all|title=Peter Thiel Makes Down Payment on Libertarian Ocean Colonies|work=WIRED}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CNN20090310"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/TECH/03/09/floating.cities.seasteading/index.html|title=City floating on the sea could be just 3 years away|date=March 3, 2009|publisher=CNN|accessdate=2009-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Seasteading Institute (TSI) focused on three areas: building a community, doing research,  and building the first seastead in the [[San Francisco Bay]].  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldarchitecturenews.com/index.php?fuseaction=wanappln.projectview&amp;upload_id=2345|title=The Seasteading Institute established to develop permanent ocean communities.|last=May Young|first=Niki|date=May 22, 2008|publisher=World Architecture News|accessdate=2009-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The project picked up mainstream exposure after having been brought to the attention of [[PayPal]] cofounder [[Peter Thiel]].  Thiel donated $500,000 in initial seed capital to start The Seasteading Institute, and has contributed $1.7 million &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; in total to date.  He also spoke out on behalf of its viability in his essay "The Education of a Libertarian".&lt;ref name="catounbound2009"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cato-unbound.org/2009/04/13/peter-thiel/the-education-of-a-libertarian/|title=The Education of a Libertarian|author=Peter Thiel|date = April 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of Thiel's backing, TSI received widespread media attention from a variety of sources including &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/2010/03/seasteading-the-great-escape/|title=Seasteading: the great escape|date=April 2010|publisher=[[Prospect Magazine]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Economist]]''&lt;ref name="Cities on the Ocean in The Economist" /&gt; Business Insider,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/seasteading-misconceptions-2013-11#ixzz2l1W6LQgX|title=Seasteading Misconceptions - Business Insider|date=16 November 2013|work=Business Insider}}&lt;/ref&gt; and BBC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20131101-living-on-the-ocean|title=BBC - Future - Ocean living: A step closer to reality?|work=BBC Future}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reason.com/archives/2011/02/17/is-seasteading-the-future|title=Is Seasteading the Future?|last=Stossel|first=John|authorlink=John Stossel|date=11 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Friedman and Gramlich had hoped to float the first prototype seastead in the San Francisco Bay by 2010&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://gizmodo.com/392091/silicon-valley-nerds-plan-sea+based-utopian-country-to-call-their-own|title=Silicon Valley Nerds Plan Sea-Based Utopian Country to Call Their Own|publisher=Gawker Media|author=Adam Frucci|work=Gizmodo}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=90664406|title=Libertarian Island: No Rules, Just Rich Dudes|date=21 May 2008|work=NPR.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Plans were to launch a seastead by 2014,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.meetup.com/sfbay-seasteading/calendar/14479560/|title=Meetup.com - October 2010 Seasteading Social at the Hyatt Regency SF|accessdate=20 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and TSI projected that the seasteading population would exceed 150 individuals in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://seasteading.org/mission/additionalreading/timeline|title=Seasteading: A Possible Timeline|accessdate=20 October 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101129010119/http://seasteading.org/mission/additionalreading/timeline|archivedate=29 November 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  TSI did not meet these targets.

In January 2009, the Seasteading Institute patented a design for a 200-person resort seastead, ClubStead, about a city block in size, produced by consultancy firm Marine Innovation &amp; Technology. The ClubStead design marked the first major engineering analysis in the seasteading movement.&lt;ref name="Cities on the Ocean in The Economist" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gramlich" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://seasteading.org/strategic-areas/engineering/clubstead|title=ClubStead|year=2009|publisher=seasteading.org|accessdate=2009-06-02}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Floating City Project ===

In the spring of 2013,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seasteading.org/2013/06/the-seasteading-institute-june-2013-newsletter/|title=The Seasteading Institute|author=Charlie Deist|work=The Seasteading Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt; TSI launched The Floating City Project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seasteading.org/floating-city-project/|title=Floating City Project - The Seasteading Institute - Startup Cities|work=The Seasteading Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project proposed to locate a floating city within the [[territorial waters]] of an existing nation, rather than the open ocean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://startupcities.org|title=Start|work=Startup Cities Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt; TSI claimed that doing so would have several advantages:
* Easier to engineer a seastead in relatively calm, shallow waters  
* Easier for residents to travel to and from the seastead  
* Easier to acquire goods and services from existing supply chains  
* Would place a floating city within the international legal framework.  
In October 2013, the Institute raised $27,082 from 291 funders in a crowdfunding campaign&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/designing-the-world-s-first-floating-city|title=Designing the Worlds First Floating City - Indiegogo|work=Indiegogo}}&lt;/ref&gt;  TSI used the funds to hire the Dutch marine engineering firm DeltaSync&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deltasync.nl/deltasync/%7ctitle=DeltaSync%7cwork=deltasync.nl|title=DeltaSync|work=deltasync.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; to write an engineering study for The Floating City Project.

In September 2016 the Seasteading Institute met with officials in [[French Polynesia]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.seasteading.org/2016/09/french-polynesia-open-seasteading-collaboration/&lt;/ref&gt; to discuss building a prototype seastead in a sheltered lagoon. Teva Rohfristch, Minister for Economic Recovery was the first to invite The Seasteading Institute to meet with government officials.The meeting was arranged by Former Minister of Tourism, Marc Collins.&lt;ref name="seasteading.org"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.seasteading.org/2017/01/government-french-polynesia-signs-agreement-seasteaders-floating-island-project/|title=Government of French Polynesia Signs Agreement with Seasteaders for Floating Island Project {{!}} The Seasteading Institute|website=www.seasteading.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 13, 2017,  French Polynesia Minister of Housing, Jean-Christophe Bouissou signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with TSI to create the first semi-autonomous "seazone".   TSI spun off a for-profit company called "Blue Frontiers", which will build and operate a prototype seastead in the zone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cladglobal.com/CLADnews/architecture-design/Seasteading-Seasteading-Institute-architecture-design-French-Polynesia-floating-cities/329809?source=grid|title=French Polynesia could host world's first floating city after signing agreement with Seasteading Institute|last=Megson|first=Kim|date=2017-01-24|website=|publisher=CLADnews|access-date=2017-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The prototype will be based on a design by marine engineering firm Blue 21.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

On March 3, 2018, a mayor from French Polynesia said the agreement was "not a legal document" and had expired at the end of 2017 in response to a challenger trying to make it an issue for the May, 2018 elections.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.radionz.co.nz/international/pacific-news/351420/french-polynesia-sinks-floating-island-project Radio NZ: "French Polynesia sinks floating island project"]&lt;/ref&gt; 

In May, 2018 Blue Frontiers began raising funds through a cryptographic token ([https://varyon.io Varyon]) to prepare for building in the Sea Zone when the French Polynesian government passes the SeaZone act later in the year. &lt;ref&gt;https://varyon.io Varyon fundraising page.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design proposals==
===Cruise ships===
[[Cruise ship]]s are a proven technology, and address most of the challenges of living at sea for extended periods of time.  However, they're typically optimized for travel and short-term stay, not for permanent residence in a single location.

Examples:
* Blue Seed retro-fitted cruise ship.&lt;ref name="Blueseed Startup Sees Entrepreneur-Ship As Visa Solution For Silicon Valley Huffington Post" /&gt;
* Freedom Ship&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/real-estate/world-floating-city-back-article-1.1531843|title=World’s first floating city back on course|newspaper=NY Daily News|access-date=2017-02-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spar platform===
Platform designs based on [[spar buoy]]s, similar to oil platforms.&lt;ref name=cnetnews&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; In this design, the platforms rest on spars in the shape of floating dumbbells, with the living area high above sea level.  Building on spars in this fashion reduces the influence of wave action on the structure.&lt;ref name="Gramlich"&gt;{{cite web

=== Modular island ===
[[Image:AndrasGyorfi.jpg|thumb|right|250px|András Győrfi's "The Swimming City"]]
There are numerous seastead designs based around interlocking modules made of [[reinforced concrete]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://seasteading.org/interact/forums/engineering/structure-designs/apply-seasteading-concrete-shell-structures|title=Apply Seasteading Concrete Shell Structures - The Seasteading Institute|work=The Seasteading Institute|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100710053754/http://www.seasteading.org/interact/forums/engineering/structure-designs/apply-seasteading-concrete-shell-structures|archivedate=2010-07-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Reinforced cement is used for floating docks, oil platforms, dams, and other marine structures.

=== Monolithic island ===
A single, monolithic structure that is not intended to be expanded or connected to other modules.

Examples: 
* Evolo Seascraper&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.evolo.us/architecture/seascraper-floating-city/|title=Seascraper – Floating City - eVolo - Architecture Magazine|work=evolo.us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other projects ==
=== Sea Orbiter ===
The [[SeaOrbiter]] is an oceangoing research vessel designed to give scientists and others a residential yet mobile research station.  The station will have laboratories, workshops, living quarters and a pressurized deck to support divers and submarines.  It is headed by French architect [[Jacques Rougerie (architect)|Jacques Rougerie]], oceanographer [[Jacques Piccard]] and astronaut [[Jean-Loup Chretien]]. The cost is expected to be around $52.7 million.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

===Blueseed===

== Criticism ==
Criticisms have been leveled at both the practicality and desirability of seasteading. These can be broken down into ''governmental'', ''logistical'', and ''societal'' categories.

Critics believe that creating governance structures from scratch is a lot harder than it seems.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2015/05/silicon-valley-letting-go-techie-island-fantasies/|title=Silicon Valley Is Letting Go of Its Techie Island Fantasies|last=Denuccio|first=Kyle|newspaper=WIRED|language=en-US|access-date=2017-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, seasteads would still be at risk of political interference from nation states.&lt;ref name="Cities on the Ocean in The Economist" /&gt;

On a logistical level, seasteads could be too remote and uncomfortable (without access to culture, restaurants, shopping) to be attractive to potential residents.&lt;ref name="Cities on the Ocean in The Economist" /&gt; Building seasteads to withstand the rigors of the open ocean may prove uneconomical.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cities on the Ocean in The Economist" /&gt;

Seastead structures may blight ocean views, their industry or farming may deplete their environments, and their waste may pollute surrounding waters. Some critics believe that seasteads will exploit both residents and the nearby population.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Others fear that seasteads will mainly allow wealthy individuals to escape taxes,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; or to harm mainstream society by ignoring other financial, environmental, and labor regulations.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Conferences ==
The Seasteading Institute held its first conference in [[Burlingame, California]], October 10, 2008.  45 people from 9 countries attended.&lt;ref name="AnnualReport2009"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://seasteading.org/files/annualreportfinal.pdf|title=Seasteading Institute 2008 Annual Report|date=April 15, 2009|publisher=TSI|accessdate=2009-08-12|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090419055150/http://seasteading.org/files/annualreportfinal.pdf|archivedate=April 19, 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The second Seasteading conference was significantly larger, and held in [[San Francisco]], [[California]], September 28–30, 2009.&lt;ref name="2009Conference"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://seasteading.org/stay-in-touch/press-releases/the-seasteading-institute-announces-its-second-annual-conference|title=Seasteading 2009 Annual Conference|date=August 10, 2009|publisher=TSI|accessdate=2009-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="2009ConferenceReport"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/blogs/2009/10/11/taking_liberties/entry5377477.shtml|title=Seasteaders Take First Step Toward Colonizing The Oceans|last=McCullagh|first=Declan|date=2009-10-11|publisher=CBSNews|accessdate=2009-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The third Seasteading conference took place on May 31 - June 2, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/06/04/seasteading-institute_n_1568951.html|title=Huffington Post: "Seasteading Institute Convention" June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2017}}
Seasteading has been imagined many times in fictional works. 
*[[Jules Verne]]'s 1895 science-fiction book [[Propeller Island]] (L'Île à hélice) is about an artificial island, Standard Island, designed to travel the waters of the Pacific Ocean.
*''[[Waterworld]]'' was a major motion picture featuring various seastead communities.
*In video games, a city on the ocean free from any kind of government is the premise of the games ''[[BioShock]]'' and ''[[BioShock 2]]'', ''[[Brink (video game)|Brink]]'', and ''[[Call of Duty: Black Ops II]]''; while in ''[[Metal Gear]]'', a [[private military company]] maintains its Mother Base on the ocean, independent from any government.
*Transhumania is a seasteading city in the novel ''[[The Transhumanist Wager]]'' by [[Zoltan Istvan]].
*The [[Neal Stephenson]] book ''[[Snow Crash]]'' takes place partly on Rife's Raft, a floating refugee camp of boats and rafts tied together.
*''[[Gargantia on the Verdurous Planet]]'' is a Japanese anime that takes place mainly on a traveling city made of an interconnected fleet of ocean ships.
*[[Armada (Bas-Lag)|Armada]] is the fictional floating city in [[China Miéville]]'s novel ''[[The Scar (novel)|The Scar]]''.

'''Shopkeeper's privilege''' is a law recognized in some parts of the United States under which a [[shopkeeper]] is allowed to detain a suspected [[Shoplifting|shoplifter]] on store property for a reasonable period of time, so long as the shopkeeper has cause to believe that the person detained in fact committed, or attempted to commit, theft of store property.&lt;ref&gt;See § 22, at 142, {{cite book|last1=Prosser|first1=William Lloyd|title=Prosser and Keeton on the law of torts|date=1984|publisher=West Publishing Co.|isbn=0314748806|edition=5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J-MpAQAAMAAJ|accessdate=6 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Limits==
The privilege to detain, although recognized in many jurisdictions, is not as broad as a police officer's privilege to [[arrest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''Cervantez v. J.C. Penney Co.'', 595 P.2d 975, 982 &amp; n.5 (Cal. 1979)|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9559415024528178754|website=Google Scholar|publisher=Google|accessdate=6 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the shopkeeper exceeds the bounds of this privilege and makes an arrest, the lawfulness of his action will be determined by the jurisdiction's rules governing [[citizen's arrest|arrest by a private citizen]]. The shopkeeper's privilege is for the purpose of investigation only; if, after reasonable detention and investigation, the shopkeeper mistakenly concludes that the suspect is guilty and has him arrested, the shopkeeper may becomes liable for these acts just as he would have been had he committed them without undertaking a prior detention and investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Protection and Recapture of Merchandise from Shoplifters|journal=Northwestern University Law Review|date=1952|volume=47|page=90|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/illlr47&amp;div=14&amp;id=&amp;page=|accessdate=6 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Statutes in many states have modified and in some cases broadened the common law privilege,&lt;ref name="larson"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=False Imprisonment and Unlawful Detention|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/personal-injury-and-torts/false-imprisonment-and-unlawful-detention|website=ExpertLaw|accessdate=6 November 2017|date=12 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; for example, by expressly permitting detention of the suspect until the police arrive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''Jacques v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co.'', 285 N.E.2d 871, 876 (N.Y. 1972)|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11995369245140909433|website=Google Scholar|publisher=Google|accessdate=6 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other cases, case precedent has provided shopkeepers with similar tools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Resendez'', 962 S.W.2d 539 (Sup. Ct., Tex., 1998)|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17159519265033714409|website=Google Scholar|publisher=Google|accessdate=6 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The practical effect of these extensions is to give the shopkeeper the same privilege as a police officer to make an arrest on reasonable grounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''People v. Jones'', 393 N.E.2d 443, 445 (N.Y. 1979)|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12640126213220744237|website=Google Scholar|publisher=Google|accessdate=6 November 2017}}; {{cite web|title=''State v. Hughes'', 598 N.E.2d 916, 918 (Ohio C.P. 1992)|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12141474160248748812|website=Google Scholar|publisher=Google|accessdate=6 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rationale==
This privilege has been justified by the practical need for some degree of protection for shopkeepers in their dealings with suspected shoplifters. Absent such privilege, a shopkeeper would be faced with the dilemma of either allowing suspects to leave without challenge or acting upon his suspicion and risking a false arrest.&lt;ref name="rest120a"&gt;See § 120A {{cite book|title=Restatement (second) of Torts|date=1965|publisher=American Law Institute|isbn=0314012710|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J642AQAAIAAJ|accessdate=6 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The privilege for the most part is to be able to return the stolen goods by determining ownership. The shopkeeper may not force a confession. The shopkeeper's privilege does not include the power of search.&lt;ref&gt;William L. Prosser, ''Proceedings of the 34th Annual Meeting of The American Law Institute'', 1957 A.L.I. PROC. 283 (remarks of Mr. William L. Prosser, Reporter)&lt;/ref&gt;  Some courts, however, have expanded this original common law privilege to also include the detention of criminal trespassers: "[t]he detention and removal of a criminal trespasser is an essential power of any shopkeeper or other property owner[.]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''Durante v. Fairlane Town Ctr.'', No. 05-1113, 201 F. App'x 338, 342 (6th Cir. Oct. 18, 2006) (unpublished)|url=http://www.opn.ca6.uscourts.gov/opinions.pdf/06a0773n-06.pdf|website=United States Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit|accessdate=6 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Requisite conditions==

In seeking to avail themself of the shopkeeper's privilege, the proprietor or agent thereof must ensure:

# The investigation is conducted ''near or on the premises''; the detention itself should be effected either on the store premises or in the immediate vicinity thereof. The privilege likely would not apply to after-the-fact questioning of a suspected thief who had left the store's property. While the common law does permit the owner of goods acting on fresh pursuit to use reasonable force to recapture his or her goods from one who actually took them wrongfully, in doing so the property owner acts at his or her own peril.&lt;ref&gt;See § 101, 103, {{cite book|title=Restatement (second) of Torts|date=1965|publisher=American Law Institute|isbn=0314012710|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J642AQAAIAAJ|accessdate=6 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the investigation must be to determine ownership of the property, not to force a confession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''Moffatt v. Buffums’, Inc.'', 69 P.2d 424 (Cal. Dist. Ct. App. 1937)|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15536485097427307188|website=Google Scholar|publisher=Google|accessdate=6 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# The shopkeeper has ''reasonable grounds'' to suspect the particular person detained is shoplifting. 
# Only ''reasonable, nondeadly force'' is used to effect the detention. Such force being justified when the suspect is in immediate flight or violently resists detention.&lt;ref name="rest120a"/&gt;
# The detention itself lasts only the ''time necessary to make a reasonable investigation of the facts''. Fifteen minutes may be too long where all that is necessary is to ask the cashier whether the detainee has paid.&lt;ref name="rest120a"/&gt;

In cases where a shopkeeper fails to satisfy the aforementioned requisite conditions, he or she loses the privilege and may face liability under local criminal statutes and civil [[torts]].&lt;ref name="larson"/&gt; However, so long as these conditions are established, the shopkeeper is immune from liability for false arrest, battery, etc., even when it is discovered after the investigation that the person detained was innocent of any wrongdoing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Christman|first1=Steven M.|last2=Mark|first2=Jillian M.|title=Guidelines on Dealing With Suspected  Shoplifters|journal=New York Law Journal|date=19 May 2014|url=https://www.law.com/newyorklawjournal/almID/1202655685175/|accessdate=6 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statutory analogs==

The common law shopkeeper's privilege has been superseded in most states by so-called [[shoplifting]] statutes, or [[merchant's statutes]], that allow merchants, their employees, and their agents to detain suspected shoplifters for: the investigation of merchandise or property ownership, the recovery of unpurchased merchandise or property, and the summoning of a police officer.&lt;ref&gt;Robert A. Brazener, ''Annotation, Construction and Effect, in False Imprisonment Action, of Statute Providing for Detention of Suspected Shoplifters'', 47 A.L.R. 3d 998 (1973)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stephen Gerald Breyer''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|r|aɪ|.|ər}}; born August 15, 1938) is an American lawyer, professor, and jurist serving as an [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States|Associate Justice]] of the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] since 1994. Appointed by President [[Bill Clinton]], Breyer is generally associated with the more [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] side of the Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kersch |first=Ken |year=2006 |title=Justice Breyer's Mandarin Liberty |url=https://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=5339&amp;context=uclrev |publisher=University of Chicago Law Review |volume=73 |pages=759-822 |quote=As his decision to characterize both the New Deal and Warren Courts as centrally committed to democracy and 'active liberty' makes clear, Justice Breyer identifies his own constitutional agenda with that of these earlier courts, and positions himself, in significant respects, as a partisan of midcentury constitutional liberalism. |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171226033939/https://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=5339&amp;context=uclrev |archivedate=December 26, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a [[Law clerk|clerkship]] with Supreme Court Associate Justice [[Arthur Goldberg]] in 1964, Breyer became well known as a law professor and lecturer at [[Harvard Law School]], starting in 1967. There he specialized in [[administrative law]], writing a number of influential textbooks that remain in use today. He held other prominent positions before being nominated for the Supreme Court, including special assistant to the [[United States Assistant Attorney General]] for Antitrust, assistant [[special prosecutor]] on the [[Watergate]] Special Prosecution Force in 1973, and serving on the [[United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit|First Circuit Court of Appeals]] from 1980 to 1994.

In his 2005 book ''[[Active Liberty]]'', Breyer made his first attempt to systematically lay out his views on legal theory, arguing that the [[judiciary]] should seek to resolve issues in a manner that encourages popular participation in governmental decisions.

From 1980 to 1994, Breyer was a judge on the [[United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit]]; he was the court's [[Chief Judge]] from 1990 to 1994.&lt;ref name="Supreme Court Bio" /&gt; In the last days of President [[Jimmy Carter]]'s administration, on November 13, 1980, Carter nominated Breyer to the First Circuit, to a new seat established by 92 Stat. 1629, and the [[United States Senate]] confirmed him on December 9, 1980, by an 80–10 vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Sharp Questions for Judge Breyer |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0DE0DF153FF933A25754C0A962958260 |work=The New York Times |date=July 10, 2004 |accessdate=March 8, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He received his commission on December 10, 1980. He served as Chief Judge from 1990 to 1994. He served as a member of the [[Judicial Conference of the United States]] between 1990 and 1994 and the [[United States Sentencing Commission]] between 1985 and 1989.&lt;ref name="Supreme Court Bio" /&gt; On the sentencing commission, Breyer played a key role in reforming federal criminal sentencing procedures, producing the [[Federal Sentencing Guidelines]], which were formulated to increase uniformity in sentencing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Justice Breyer Should Recuse Himself from Ruling on Constitutionality of Federal Sentencing Guidelines, Duke Law Professor Says |url=http://www.dukenews.duke.edu/2004/09/breyertip_0904.html |work=Duke University News |date=September 28, 2004 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120731163145/http://www.dukenews.duke.edu/2004/09/breyertip_0904.html |archivedate=July 31, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; His service on the First Circuit terminated on August 2, 1994, due to his elevation to the Supreme Court.

===Supreme Court (1994–present)===
In 1993, President [[Bill Clinton]] considered him for the seat vacated by [[Byron White]] that ultimately went to Justice [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Richard |last=Berke |title=The Overview; Clinton Names Ruth Ginsburg, Advocate for Women, to Court |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE7DB163EF936A25755C0A965958260 |work=The New York Times |date=June 15, 1993 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Breyer's appointment came shortly thereafter, however, following the retirement of [[Harry Blackmun]] in 1994, when Clinton nominated Breyer as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court on May 17, 1994. Breyer was confirmed by the Senate on July 29, 1994, by an 87 to 9 vote, and received his commission on August 3.&lt;ref name="Supreme Court Bio" /&gt; He was the second-longest-serving junior justice in the history of the Court, close to surpassing the record set by Justice [[Joseph Story]] of 4,228 days (from February 3, 1812, to September 1, 1823); Breyer fell 29 days short of tying this record, which he would have reached on March 1, 2006, had Justice [[Samuel Alito]] not joined the Court on January 31, 2006.

==Judicial philosophy==

===In general===
{{further information|Purposive approach}}
Breyer's [[Pragmatism|pragmatic]] approach to the law "will tend to make the law more sensible"; according to [[Cass Sunstein]], Breyer's "attack on [[originalism]] is powerful and convincing".&lt;ref name="115 YALE L.J. 1719"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sunstein|first=Cass R.|title=Justice Breyer's Democratic Pragmatism|url=http://www.yalelawjournal.org/pdf/221_om87hycw.pdf|journal=The Yale Law Journal|date=May 2006|volume=115|issue=7|pages=1719–1743|doi=10.2307/20455667|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170704041242/http://www.yalelawjournal.org/pdf/221_om87hycw.pdf|archivedate=July 4, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, Breyer said that in assessing a law's constitutionality, while some of his colleagues "emphasize language, a more literal reading of the [Constitution's] text, history and tradition", he looks more closely to the "purpose and consequences".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Justice Breyer Favors 'Less Literal' Readings |url=http://archive.newsmax.com/archives/ic/2006/2/9/130027.shtml |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120527130035/http://archive.newsmax.com/archives/ic/2006/2/9/130027.shtml |dead-url=yes |archive-date=May 27, 2012 |publisher=newsmax.com |date=February 9, 2006 |accessdate=September 16, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Virginia]]'', {{ussc|536|304|2002}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Breyer is also recognized to be deferential to the interests of law enforcement and to legislative judgments in the Court's [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] rulings. He has demonstrated a consistent pattern of deference to Congress, voting to overturn congressional legislation at a lower rate than any other Justice since 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Paul |last=Gewirtz |author2=Golder, Chad  |title=So Who Are the Activists? |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/06/opinion/06gewirtz.html |work=The New York Times |date=July 6, 2005 |accessdate=March 23, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Breyer's extensive experience in [[administrative law]] is accompanied by his staunch defense of the [[Federal Sentencing Guidelines]]. Breyer rejects the strict interpretation of the [[Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Sixth Amendment]] espoused by [[Antonin Scalia|Justice Scalia]] that all facts necessary to criminal punishment must be submitted to a jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Blakely v. Washington]]'', {{ussc|542|296|2004}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In many other areas on the Court, too, Breyer's pragmatism was considered the intellectual counterweight to Scalia's [[textualism|textualist]] philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Kathleen M. |last=Sullivan |title=Consent of the Governed |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/05/books/review/05sullivan.html |work=The New York Times |date=February 5, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In describing his interpretive philosophy, Breyer has sometimes noted his use of six interpretive tools: text, history, tradition, precedent, the purpose of a statute, and the consequences of competing interpretations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Dalia |last=Lithwick |title=Justice Grover Versus Justice Oscar |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2154993/ |work=Slate |date=December 6, 2006 |accessdate=March 19, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He has noted that only the last two differentiate him from textualists such as Scalia. Breyer argues that these sources are necessary, however, and in the former case (purpose), can in fact provide greater objectivity in legal interpretation than looking merely at what is often ambiguous statutory text.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Interview with Nina Totenberg |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4929668 |publisher=NPR |date=September 30, 2005 |accessdate=March 19, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; With the latter (consequences), Breyer argues that considering the impact of legal interpretations is a further way of ensuring consistency with a law's intended purpose.&lt;ref&gt;Sunstein at 12 ("Breyer thinks that as compared with a single-minded focus on literal text, his approach will tend to make the law more sensible, almost by definition. He also contends that it 'helps to implement the public's will and is therefore consistent with the Constitution's democratic purpose.' Breyer concludes that an emphasis on legislative purpose 'means that laws will work better for the people they are presently meant to affect. Law is tied to life; and a failure to understand how a statute is so tied can undermine the very human activity that the law seeks to benefit' (p. 100).")&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Active Liberty''===
Breyer expounded his judicial philosophy in 2005 in ''[[Active Liberty|Active Liberty: Interpreting Our Democratic Constitution]]''. In it, Breyer urges judges to interpret legal provisions (of the Constitution or of statutes) in light of the purpose of the text and how well the consequences of specific rulings fit those purposes. The book is considered a response to the 1997 book ''A Matter of Interpretation'', in which [[Antonin Scalia]] emphasized adherence to the original meaning of the text alone.&lt;ref name="Wittes2005" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Mark |last=Feeney |title=Author in the Court: Justice Stephen Breyer's New Book Reflects His Practical Approach to the Law |url=http://archive.boston.com/ae/books/articles/2005/10/03/author_in_the_court/ |work=Boston Globe |date=October 3, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Active Liberty'', Breyer argues that the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Framers of the Constitution]] sought to establish a democratic government involving the maximum liberty for its citizens. Breyer refers to [[Isaiah Berlin]]’s ''Two Concepts of Liberty''. The first Berlinian concept, being what most people understand by liberty, is "freedom from government coercion". Berlin termed this "[[negative liberty]]" and warned against its diminution; Breyer calls this "modern liberty". The second Berlinian concept&amp;nbsp;– "[[positive liberty]]"&amp;nbsp;– is the "freedom to participate in the government". In Breyer's terminology, this is the "active liberty" the judge should champion. Having established what "active liberty" is, and positing the primary importance (to the Framers) of this concept over the competing idea of "negative liberty", Breyer makes a predominantly [[utilitarian]] case for rulings that give effect to the [[Original intent|democratic intentions]] of the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]].

The book's historical premises and practical prescriptions have been challenged. For example, according to [[Peter Berkowitz]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.peterberkowitz.com/democratizingtheconstitution.pdf |format=PDF|title=Democratizing the Constitution |accessdate=October 26, 2007 |last=Berkowitz |first=Peter}}&lt;/ref&gt; the reason that "[t]he primarily democratic nature of the Constitution's governmental structure has not always seemed obvious", as Breyer puts it, is "because it's not true, at least in Breyer's sense, that the Constitution elevates active liberty above modern [negative] liberty". Breyer's position "demonstrates not fidelity to the Constitution", Berkowitz argues, "but rather a determination to rewrite the Constitution's priorities".  Berkowitz suggests that Breyer is also inconsistent in failing to apply this standard to the issue of abortion, instead preferring decisions "that protect women's modern liberty, which remove controversial issues from democratic discourse". Failing to answer the [[Textualism|textualist]] charge that the [[Living Constitution|Living Documentarian]] judge is a law unto himself, Berkowitz argues that ''Active Liberty'' "suggests that when necessary, instead of choosing the consequence that serves what he regards as the Constitution’s leading purpose, Breyer will determine the Constitution’s leading purpose on the basis of the consequence that he prefers to vindicate".

Against the last charge, [[Cass Sunstein]] has defended Breyer, noting that of the nine justices on the Rehnquist Court, Breyer had the highest percentage of votes to uphold acts of Congress and also to defer to the decision of the [[Executive branch of the United States|executive branch]].&lt;ref&gt;Sunstein, pg. 7, citing Lori Ringhand, "Judicial Activism and the Rehnquist Court", available on ssrn.com and Cass R. Sunstein and Thomas Miles, "[https://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?httpsredir=1&amp;article=2663&amp;context=journal_articles Do Judges Make Regulatory Policy? An Empirical investigation of Chevron]", University of Chicago Law Review 823 (2006).&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to [[Jeffrey Toobin]] in ''[[The New Yorker]]'', "Breyer concedes that a judicial approach based on 'active liberty' will not yield solutions to every constitutional debate," and that, in Breyer's words, "respecting the democratic process does not mean you abdicate your role of enforcing the limits in the Constitution, whether in the Bill of Rights or in separation of powers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jeffrey |last=Toobin |title=Breyer's Big Idea |url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2005/10/31/051031fa_fact?currentPage=1 |work=The New Yorker |date=October 31, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To this point, and from a discussion at the [[New York Historical Society]] in March 2006, Breyer has noted that "democratic means" did not bring about an end to [[slavery]], or the concept of "one man, one vote", which allowed corrupt and discriminatory (but democratically inspired) state laws to be overturned in favor of [[civil rights]].&lt;ref name=NYHS&gt;{{cite web|last=Pakaluk|first=Maximilian|title=Chambered in a 'Democratic Space'.

===Other books===

In 2010, Breyer published a second book, ''Making Our Democracy Work: A Judge's View''.&lt;ref&gt;({{ISBN|978-0307269911}}); {{cite news |first=David |last=Fontana |title=Stephen Breyer's "Making Democracy Work", reviewed by David Fontana |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/10/01/AR2010100103520.html |work=The Washington Post |date=October 3, 2005 |accessdate=October 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; There, Breyer argued that judges have six tools they can use to determine a legal provision's proper meaning: (1) its text; (2) its historical context; (3) [[precedent]]; (4) tradition; (5) its purpose; and (6) the consequences of potential interpretations.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Breyer, ''Making Our Democracy Work: A Judge's View'' 74 (2010).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Textualists]], like [[Scalia]], only feel comfortable using the first four of these tools; while pragmatists, like Breyer, believe that "purpose" and "consequences" are ''particularly'' important interpretative tools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media | people= Stephen Breyer, Antonin Scalia, Jan Crawford Greenburg (moderator) | date=2006-12-05 | title=A conversation on the constitution: perspectives from Active Liberty and A Matter of Interpretation | medium=Video | location=Capital Hilton Ballroom - Washington, D.C. | publisher=The American Constitution Society; The Federalist Society|url=https://fedsoc.org/commentary/videos/a-conversation-on-the-constitution-with-supreme-court-justices-stephen-breyer-and-antonin-scalia-event-audio}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Breyer cites several watershed moments in Supreme Court history to show why the consequences of a particular ruling should always be in a judge's mind. He notes that [[President Jackson]] ignored the Court's ruling in ''[[Worcester v. Georgia]]'', which led to the [[Trail of Tears]] and severely weakened the Court's authority.&lt;ref name="Shesol"&gt;Jeff Shesol. ''[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/19/books/review/Shesol-t.html?pagewanted=all&amp;mcubz=0 Evolving Circumstances, Enduring Values]'', N.Y. Times, Sept. 17, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; He also cites the ''[[Dred Scott]]'' decision, an important precursor to the [[American Civil War]].&lt;ref name="Shesol"/&gt; When the Court ignores the consequences of its decisions, Breyer argues, it can lead to devastating and destabilizing outcomes.&lt;ref name="Shesol"/&gt;                          

In 2015, Breyer released a third book, ''The Court and the World: American Law and the New Global Realities'', examining the interplay between U.S. and international law and how the realities of a globalized world need to be considered in U.S. cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Witt|first1=John Fabian|title=Stephen Breyer’s ‘The Court and the World’|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/20/books/review/stephen-breyers-the-court-and-the-world.html|work=The New York Times|date=September 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Court and the World: American Law and the New Global Realities|url=http://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/253016/the-court-and-the-world-by-stephen-breyer/|publisher=Penguin Random House|accessdate=October 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other views===
In an interview on ''[[Fox News Sunday]]'' on December 12, 2010, Breyer said that based on the values and the historical record, the [[Founding Fathers of the United States]] never intended guns to go unregulated and that history supports his and the other dissenters' views in ''[[District of Columbia v. Heller]]''. He summarized:
{{Quote|We're acting as judges. If we're going to decide everything on the basis of history — by the way, what is the scope of the right to keep and bear arms? Machine guns? Torpedoes? Handguns? Are you a sportsman? Do you like to shoot pistols at targets? Well, get on the subway and go to Maryland.

'''''Sutherland v United Kingdom''''' originated as a complaint by Mr Euan Sutherland to the European Commission of Human Rights that the fixing of the minimum age for lawful homosexual activities at 18 rather than 16, as for heterosexual activities, violated his right to respect for private life under Article 8 of the [[European Convention on Human Rights|European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms]].  The complaint was first filed on 8 June 1994 and ultimately led to the equalisation of the [[age of consent]] for homosexual and heterosexual acts.

== Facts ==
The Applicant, Mr Euan Sutherland was born in 1977,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Responses to Crime |first=David James George Hennessy |last=Windlesham |year=2001 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=0-19-924741-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and after realising he was homosexual, had his first sexual encounter with another homosexual man at the age of 16.  Although the Applicant was never prosecuted, there was a justified fear that he may be since, in 1990, 455 prosecutions had given rise to 342 convictions and, in 1991, 213 prosecutions gave rise to 169 convictions.  This fear led the Applicant to bring the complaint to the Commission.

Under section 12(1) of the [[Sexual Offences Act 1956]] it was an offence for a person to commit [[buggery]] with another person and under section 13 it was an offence for a man to commit an act of "[[Labouchere Amendment|gross indecency]]" with another man, whether in public or private.   The [[Sexual Offences Act 1967]] stated that no offence is committed if both parties are aged 21 or over and consented to the acts.

== Judgment ==
The Commission considered the application and following a hearing published its findings on 1 July 1997.  The published findings show that the Commission considered a very wide range of opinions and factors, including the rationale for a higher age of consent for homosexual acts, opinions from medical staff as to what a suitable age limit is and whether a different age for heterosexual and homosexual acts is discriminatory.

The commission found that the existence of different age limits was discriminatory and that no valid grounds existed to justify that discrimination.  They therefore found that the age of consent for homosexual acts should be lowered to 16.  In arriving at their conclusion the commission cited their reasoning in the previous cases, ''[[Dudgeon v United Kingdom]]'' and ''[[Norris v. Ireland]]''.

In response to the commission's findings the Applicant and the UK Government, on 13 October 1997, submitted an agreement that a Bill would be proposed to Parliament the summer of 1998 to reduce the age of consent for homosexual acts to 16.  They agreed that once the legislation was passed the Government would pay reasonable costs and the parties would apply to the Court for approval of a friendly settlement.

The Government brought the ''Crime and Disorder Bill'' to Parliament in June 1998 which contained a provision to reduce the age of consent for homosexual acts to 16.  Those provisions were accepted by the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], but were rejected by the [[House of Lords]].  The Sexual Offences (Amendment) Bill was introduced to the House of Commons on 16 December 1998 and the relevant provisions were again endorsed by that house, but were later rejected by the House of Lords.

The provisions were then reintroduced for a third time under the [[Parliament Act 1911]] such they could pass into force after a delay of one year.

On 28 January 2000, the Bill was re-introduced before the House of Commons and was passed by 263 votes to 102.  It was then introduced into the House of Lords on 29 February 2000, where, on 11 April 2000 its Second Reading was not opposed, but some Lords stated they would propose amendments.  As a result, the Bill was adopted under the Parliament Act at the end of the 2000 Parliamentary year and the [[Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 2000]] received [[Royal Assent]] on 30 November 2000 and was brought into force on 8 January 2001.

Following a series of requests for extensions, the Court received notification from the Government on 23 January 2001 that the age of consent had been equalised and then on 1 February 2001 that the Government had paid the Applicant's costs.  Accordingly, on 27 March 2001, the case was struck out of the Court's lists.

[[File:Title Page of 'British Government and Jihad'-1900.jpg|150px|thumb|Book-Title ''The British Government and Jihad (22 May 1900)'']]
{{Ahmadiyya}}

'''''The British Government and Jihad''''' (Urdu:''Government Angrezi Aur Jihad'') is a book written in 1900 by [[Mirza Ghulam Ahmad]], the founder of the [[Ahmadiyya]] movement in Islam. An alternative title is the ''True Meaning of [[Jihad]]''. It was published on 22 May 1900&lt;ref name="Intro"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alislam.org/library/links/80-books.html#chapter-48|title=The British Government and Jihad|publisher=Alsilam}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanchronicle.com/articles/view/82539|title=The Ahmadiyya Jama'at: a persecuted sect|publisher=American Chronicle|accessdate=15 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
and was translated into English in 2006, by Islam International Publications.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/BritishGovtAndJihad/BritishGovt-and-Jihad#page/n15/mode/2up The British Government and Jihad, Mirza Ghulam Ahmad (1900)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Founder of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Jamaat refers to the Qur'an and the Ahadith (sayings) of the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]] in order to explain the true nature of the Islamic concept of jihad. The author points to the peaceful nature of the Islamic faith and explains that Muhammad resorted to defensive war only after suffering thirteen years of brutal oppression. Divine permission to retaliate was granted for the specific purpose of self-defense, to punish aggressors, and to uphold freedom of conscience. He also argues that the command to fight and retaliate was for that specific condition in which the early Muslims found themselves.

==Opposition to God’s messengers==
The author explains why a new messenger of God finds such a great opposition from the pre-existing communities and their religious leaders. He believes it is out of anger and jealousy and the fear that their incomes shall go down if the new message and reformation succeeded. He writes, the new reformer unmasks the deficiencies of their leaders. He claims, for similar reasons the pagans, Christian and Jewish communities and their leaders strongly opposed the Islamic Prophet Muhammad and his community. He writes, “members of this faction are in fact deficient; they possess very little of Divine light and their flaws are totally exposed during a Prophet or Messenger’s time. Their egos give rise to hostility towards God’s Prophets and the righteous, and they selfishly devise plans to injure them." (The British Government and Jihad, p.&amp;nbsp;5)

Ahmad believes, the existing Arab communities, “feared that the firm establishment of this religion would in turn sow the seeds of destruction for their faith and nation.” (p.&amp;nbsp;6) and it was the main reason behind the Muslim community was so strongly opposed and acts of extreme “cruelty and brutality were committed against them”.

=== Trials and tribulations ===

Ahmad states, "For a lengthy thirteen year period” the Muslim community suffered extreme oppression but they were instructed, not to retaliate. “the streets ran red with their blood, they did not utter a sound. They were slaughtered like animals but did not protest.” (p.&amp;nbsp;7). He writes, "They were trampled underfoot but did not utter a sound.” Ahmad describes the extreme torture which the Muslim community suffered.

==God's permission to retaliate==

Ahmad discusses in reference to the verse 22:39 of the Quran, "Permission [to fight] has been given to those who are being fought, because they were wronged. And indeed, Allah is competent to give them victory".&lt;ref&gt;[http://quran.com/22/39 The Quran, 22: 39] , [http://irebd.com/quran/english/surah-22/verse-39/ Quran Surah Al-Hajj ( Verse 39 )]&lt;/ref&gt; (p.&amp;nbsp;7). He believed this was the verse that described the real philosophy of [[Jihad]].

===Command to fight specific to that time period===

[[Mirza Ghulam Ahmad]] believed, this  Command (Quran 22:39) to retaliate and fight was specific to the time period of the Prophet and the prevailing circumstances only: He writes:

{{Quotation| This commandment was specific to the period and time. It was not forever. It applied during the time when those entering the fold of Islam were being slaughtered like sheep and lambs. After the time of the Holy Prophet (may peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and his Successors, people unfortunately made very grave mistakes in understanding the philosophy of jihad, which is rooted in the preceding verse. The unjust slaughter of God’s creatures was deemed to be a mark of religious virtue.(p. 8) }}

===Medieval Muslim Jurists Erred ===
The author is of the opinion that failure to comprehend the true import of this verse, the early Muslim jurists and scholars committed profound error, and shed the blood of innocent human beings in the name of ''Holy War'' or [[Jihad]]. This belief appears unique among the past Muslim jurists.

===Today's Muslim scholars===

The author of the treatise believes that present day religious scholars (''Maulavis'') are entirely misguided in comprehending the true philosophy of [[Jihad]] and they keep preaching such dangerous and blood-spattered doctrines among the ignorant Muslims, which have become the cause of extremism and violence in the society. He writes, " ''Maulavis'' who persist in propagating these blood-spattered doctrines are in fact responsible for murders committed by ignorant, egotistical people who know nothing of why Islam was forced to fight battles in its early history".(p.&amp;nbsp;9)

===Mualavis and Christian priests===

Commenting upon the then prevalent "Jihadist" movements among the Indian Muslims [[Mirza Ghulam Ahmad]] holds responsible, besides the ''Maulavis'', the Christian priests, who incited the ignorant masses of the Muslim society, about the misguided concept of Jihad. He writes:

{{Quotation | "In my opinion, the second cause of this criminal bloodshed, which is carried out in the hopes of becoming a ghazi, is the preaching of Christian priests who have widely publicized the claim that jihad is compulsory in Islam. They claim that killing people of other faiths is a matter of great Islamic virtue. I believe that the people of the Frontier Region were not even aware of this doctrine until the Christian priests embedded it in their minds. My view is supported by the fact that there were no incidents of this type before Christian priests began the distribution of journals, newspapers and books in the Frontier Region.&lt;ref&gt;In 1849, Reverend Pfander published his book Mizan-ul-Haq  in India, the Punjab and the Frontier Region. In it, he used offensive language to attack Islam and its Prophet (may peace be upon him) This was his first book on Islam and Christianity. The book is a defense of the integrity of the Bible, as well as an attack on the Holy Qur’an and the truthfulness of the Holy Prophet Muhammad.[''The British Govt and Jihad'', p. 24, Mirza Ghulam Ahmad.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For extensive Missionary activities of C G Pfander, See 'Muslims and Missionaries Pre-Mutiny India by Avrill Ann Powell (2013)[https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=mbdFiXqsaf8C&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s]&lt;/ref&gt;  (p. 24)}}

Ahmad writes the Christian missionaries have also spread this misguided belief of [[Jihad]] by distributing provocative literature in Urdu, Pashto and other languages, to preach the false views that "Islam was spread by the sword".(p.&amp;nbsp;11) This in a way served as a combined testimony of the ''Maulavis'' and Christian Missionaries, to incite people to violent acts and create unrest.

===Why Act XXIII of 1867 failed===

Commenting upon the failure of Act Number XXIII of 1867, in order to check the spread of the
militant ideas of the Frontier’s residents, Ahmad believed it was due to the continued provocative and bitter writings of priests like [[Imad ud-din Lahiz]] &lt;ref&gt;Reverend ‘Imad-ud-Din, a former Muslim, was one of the many priests who published extensively against Islam during this period.&lt;/ref&gt; of Amritsar and some other foul-mouthed priests who greatly damaged goodwill and reconciliation within the country.

===A dangerous course===
Ahmad saw a great danger in the combined ''Testimony'' of the Christian Missionaries and ''Maulavis'' who spread a violent view of the Muslim concept of [[Jihad]]. At the same time he perceived the dangerous consequences of the naive strategy of the Christian clergy and wrote:

{{Quotation | "The Christian priests have embarked on a very dangerous course of action. On the  one side, they falsely argue that the Qur’an summons Muslims to jihad at all times and occasions, as if seeking to draw attention towards this tradition. And then they incite the Muslims’ passion with provocative literature. It is unclear why these people naively fail to recognize that these actions can combine to produce dangerous consequences". (p. 40)}}

===What should the government do===

To suggest a remedy to the British Government in India (1900) Ahmad advised a three-step policy, which will greatly control the poisonous growth of envy and spite, among the various strata of the Indian society:
{{Quotation |

[a] prohibit all parties, including the clerics of the Church, from indulging in negative attacks on other religions for a period of five years.

[b] ask all parties to live together with love and civility, and

[c] encourage all groups to focus on the positive features of their own religions.(p. 41)}}

===Hypocrisy of Maulavis===
Ahmad, has admonished the Muslim scholars (''Maulavis'') to shun hypocrisy. He believed when, "they meet present day rulers, they bow down as if ready to prostrate; but among their own kind they insist repeatedly that this country is “dar-ul-harb” [the zone of war]. They consider jihad to be obligatory in their hearts, and few of them think otherwise" (p.&amp;nbsp;11). He advised the ''Maulavis'' restore true sincerity. He believed if they pondered over the Quran and Ahadith, they may realize the truth.

==This is not the time for [[Jihad]]==

The author of the book, [[Mirza Ghulam Ahmad]] who claims to be the promised [[Messiah]] admonished the Muslims in very strong words, telling this was not the time for [[Jihad]] i.e. any kind of armed combat:

{{Quotation| O Muslim scholars and maulavis! Listen to me. I tell you truly that this is not the time for jihad. Do not disobey God’s Holy Prophet. The awaited Messiah has arrived and orders you to abstain from religious wars involving armed combat, killing and bloodshed. Not refraining even now from spilling blood and giving such sermons is therefore not the way of Islam. The person who accepts me will not merely stop preaching in this way; rather, he will recognise the evil of this path and come to know that it invites God’s anger.   (p.11) }}

==The Messiah admonishes==

He writes, I as the promised [[Messiah]] admonish you:
{{Quotation | I therefore admonish you: Refrain from evil and be truly compassionate towards mankind. Cleanse your hearts of malice and spite, for you will become like angels through this habit. It is a filthy and unholy religion that is devoid of sympathy for humanity, and polluted is the path riddled with the thorns of a rancour based on selfish desires. O those who are with me, do not become like such people. Think about what it is we seek to attain through religion. Is it to constantly oppress others? No, religion exists so that we may obtain the life that lies in God. (p. 17) }}

===I came to end religious wars===

::I have come to you with an order: jihad with the sword has ended from this time forward, but the jihad of purifying your souls must continue. I do not say this of my own accord. This is indeed the will of God. Recall the hadith from Sahih al-Bukhari which honours the Promised Messiah by saying yada-‘ul-harb. That is to say, when the Messiah comes he will put an end to religious wars. (p. 18)

The tradition prevalent among Muslims of attacking the people of other religions, which they call jihad, is not the jihad of Divine religious Law [Shari‘ah]. Rather, it is a grievous sin and a violation of the clear instructions of God and His Prophet. It may not be easy for certain Muslims to abandon this custom since it is well established among some tribes. p.&amp;nbsp;21)

==Advice to Amir of Kabul==

Ahmad also addressed the Amir of Kabal &lt;ref&gt;The Amir of the Afghan at that time was ‘Abdur Rahman (1881–1901). He ascended to the throne after the second Afghan war (1878–80) and was recognised as the Amir of Kabul on the condition that he would not have political relations with any foreign power other than the British.&lt;/ref&gt;  to "convene a discussion on the true nature of jihad. These religious scholars can then educate the public about its errors." (p.&amp;nbsp;22) Thus spreading a more peaceful and better understanding of [[Jihad]] among the people of Afghanistan. For Ahmad believed "it is mostly Afghans who commit these acts and wield the sword with the intent of becoming ghazis, and a sizable majority of them live in his country. These barbaric practices defame Islam and he should do his best to cleanse the Afghan nation of them." (p.&amp;nbsp;23)

===Afghanistan will suffer===
Probably Ahmad knew, the Amir of Kabal was not going to pay heed to any of his councils, so he warned the Afghans of bitter consequences of their extremism:
{{ Quotation | The Amir’s citizens will surely suffer if he fails to pay heed to this essential reform. The government that ignores such fatawa from these mullahs ultimately creates problems for itself because these days the maulavis readily label people as disbelievers over minor religious differences, applying to them all other fatawa that they apply to disbelievers.(p. 22)}}

==Claims to be the Messiah and Mahdi==
At the end of the booklet, Ahmad has put forth his claim to Divine Relation, and that he was the promised [[Messiah]] and [[Mahdi]]:

{{Quotation |  I also have been given the help of the Holy Spirit. The same Mighty and Holy God Who
has descended upon me appeared to all Prophets. He appeared to Moses at Sinai, to Jesus at Mount Seir, and He shined forth on the Holy Prophet (may peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) at Mount Paran. He has communicated with me and said to me:

“I am the Highest Being for the worship of Whom all Prophets were sent. I alone am the Creator and Possessor and there is none like Me. I am not subject to birth or death. I have been informed that prevailing Christian beliefs such as Trinity and Atonement are all human errors in contravention of God’s real teachings. God has directly informed me with His
own living word. If you confront difficulties, and people ask how they might know that you are from God, tell them that heavenly signs are my witness, my prayers are answered, and I am informed of what is yet to come. Hidden mysteries, known only to God, are revealed to me
before they are manifest publicly.(p. 37) }}

"Did this age not need the avatar [second coming] of Jesus the Messiah? Of course it did.
Currently, millions of Muslims are ready to kill other people under the pretense of jihad. Indeed, some are unable to truly love a benevolent government even while living under its
protection. They are unable to reach the highest levels of sympathy, and cannot cleanse themselves of affectation and pretence. There was therefore a dire need for the avatar of the
Messiah. So I am that very promised avatar, who has been sent in the spiritual likeness, personality and temperament of Jesus the Messiah". (p.&amp;nbsp;33)

=== My message will spread===

God has Himself provided the means for fulfilling His prophecy that the message of the Messiah will spread in the world like lightning and will encompass all four corners of the earth like the light from a tower. The railways, telegraph, steamships, excellent postal services, easy modes of travel and tourism and other such means have been established to fulfill the prophecy that the message of the Messiah will illuminate every corner like lightning. (p.&amp;nbsp;19)

''Thun vs. Peake''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Veterans Law: Cases and Theory|last=Ridgway|first=James|publisher=West Academic Publishing|year=2015|isbn=978-1-62810-348-9|location=United States|pages=290–296|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims]] case that dealt with extra-schedular evaluations&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=0088bb497de8487e18ef86a111427160&amp;mc=true&amp;node=se38.1.3_1321&amp;rgn=div8|title=38 C.F.R. §3.321|last=|first=|date=|website=eCFR|publisher=Government Printing Office|access-date=December 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?rgn=div5;node=38:1.0.1.1.5 VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities].

== Background ==
The Veteran appealed his 70 percent evaluation for [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|post traumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD), asserting that he was entitled to an extra-schedular evaluation because his [[PTSD]] symptoms prevented him from advancing at his job as a senior systems programmer.  He stated that his [[PTSD]] symptoms strained relationships with his direct managers that prevented his promotion and less-experienced coworkers were promoted before him and received higher salaries.  He argued that there was a significant disparity between his current income (including VA benefits) and income he believed he could have received, but for the severity of his service-connected disability, which was sufficient to trigger extra-schedular consideration.

The Board, in denying the appeal in June 2005, found that the evidence showed that he veteran did not have marked interference with obtaining or retaining employment and he had maintained steady, full-time, gainful employment since discharge from service and worked at his current job since May 1986.

== Analysis ==
The Court articulated a three-step process for determining entitlement to an extra-schedular rating and rejected the veteran’s argument that an inadequacy in the rating schedule can be established solely by showing an asserted gap between his income (including VA benefits) and the income of similarly qualified workers in his field.  The Court described such argument as flawed because it was based on a faulty proposition that a schedular rating for a service-connected disability is not adequate unless it compensates for the ''actual individual income'' that is not realized but for that disability.

The three-step process for determining whether an extra-schedular evaluation is required was outlined by the Court as follows:
# The evidence must present such an unusual disability picture that the available schedular evaluations for that service-connected disability are inadequate,
# The schedular evaluation must not contemplate the claimant's level of disability and symptomatology and is found inadequate.
# When an analysis reveals that the rating schedule is inadequate to evaluate a claimant's disability picture and that picture has related factors such as marked interference with employment or frequent periods of hospitalization, then the claim must be forwarded for an extra-schedular evaluation determination by either the Director of Compensation Service or the Under Secretary for Benefits.
The Court also found that the Board erred in its reasoning that the veteran’s PTSD did not warrant extra-schedular consideration because he did not establish an inability to obtain or retain employment. However, the error was not prejudicial because the decision not to refer for extra-schedular consideration was not based solely on that finding as the Board also made the threshold determination that the disability picture was not so unusual or exceptional as to render the 70 percent schedular rating as inadequate.

The Court noted that the very effects of the veteran’s PTSD symptoms that he asserted as having kept him from receiving a promotion, such as impaired judgment and inability to maintain effective working relationship, are criteria described as occupational impairments that are used for evaluating mental disorders under Diagnostic Code 9411, and not earmarks of an exceptional or unusual disability picture with marked interference with employment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uscourts.cavc.gov/documents/Thun_05-2066.pdf|title=No. 05-2066.

''''' Timberworld Ltd v Levin''''' was a landmark legal decision concerning whether the peak indebtedness rule operated in [[New Zealand]]. The peak indebtedness rule concerns how much a [[Liquidator (law)|liquidator]] can claw back of the value paid to a creditor of a company, as part continuing business relationship, prior to the debtor companies liquidation. The [[Court of Appeal of New Zealand|Court of Appeal]] judgment rejected the liquidators contention that the rule should be adopted in [[Law of New Zealand|New Zealand law]].

== Background ==
When companies go into [[liquidation]] the liquidator is entitled under s 292 of the [[Companies Act 1993]] to clawback property transferred, money paid, and goods or charges given if it is an insolvent transaction entered into within two years of the company commencing liquidation. An insolvent transaction is a transaction that, as per s 292 (2) of the Act, "(a) is entered into at a time when the company is unable to pay its due debts; and (b) enables another person to receive more towards satisfaction of a debt owed by the company than the person would receive, or would be likely to receive, in the company's liquidation".&lt;ref&gt;Companies Act 1993, s 292(2).&lt;/ref&gt;

This is because the "fundamental principle" underpinning [[insolvency]] law is the ''[[pari passu]]'' or equal step principle.&lt;ref&gt;''Timberworld Ltd v Levin'' [2015] NZCA 111 at [49].&lt;/ref&gt;

However, as per section 292 (4B) of the Companies Act a "series of transactions will be treated as a single transaction where such transactions are an integral part of a continuous business relationship between the parties (as where the parties have used a running account) and the level of the [[debtor]] company’s indebtedness fluctuates from time to time as a result of the various individual transactions. With a transaction of this type the liquidator will only be entitled to claim the net difference of payments made and goods and services received from a creditor, where there is an ongoing business relationship with the debtor company."&lt;ref&gt;''Timberworld Ltd v Levin'' [2015] NZCA 111 at [30].&lt;/ref&gt;

The liquidators in these two appeals heard together sought the court's adoption of the "peak indebtedness rule". The rule this; "would enable the liquidators to choose the point during the two-year specified period when the relevant indebtedness was at its highest, as opposed to an earlier date taking into account transactions predating peak indebtedness."&lt;ref&gt;''Timberworld Ltd v Levin'' [2015] NZCA 111 at [1].&lt;/ref&gt;

As Justice Stevens summarised of the decision's importance, "Naturally liquidators will wish to use the point where the indebtedness of the company is at its highest. On that basis, any later transactions under which the creditor provides further value to the company will be exceeded in value by other transactions reducing the company’s indebtedness. [[Liquidator (law)|Liquidators]] could then point to the net reduction in indebtedness as amounting to a preference. [[Supply chain|Suppliers]], however, will seek to use an earlier date so that any increase in indebtedness is offset by earlier transactions through which the creditor supplier gave value to the debtor company."&lt;ref&gt;''Timberworld Ltd v Levin'' [2015] NZCA 111 at [5].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Judgment ==

The [[Court of Appeal of New Zealand|Court of Appeal]] ruled against the liquidators,&lt;blockquote&gt;We are satisfied the peak indebtedness rule is not part of the law in New Zealand. If Parliament had intended to adopt it, it could have done so without difficulty. It chose not to do so. Any change to the legislative policy as we have interpreted it would be a matter for Parliament. We therefore dismiss the liquidators’ appeal and cross-appeal.&lt;ref&gt;''Timberworld Ltd v Levin'' [2015] NZCA 111 at [99].&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;Justice Stevens, giving the judgment of the court, explained the "arbitrariness of peak indebtedness in operation" through an example where three different [[creditor]]s supply goods on differing terms to a company, but because of the peak indebtedness rule, the preference they are said to receive is wildly different as some transactions are disregarded by the calculation.  &lt;blockquote&gt;Despite each creditor advancing the same value of goods to Company X and receiving the same payments in return, the peak indebtedness rule can operate to produce vastly different outcomes, merely on the basis of the particular credit arrangements in each case.&lt;ref&gt;''Timberworld Ltd v Levin'' [2015] NZCA 111 at [90].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Justice Stevens also noted that, &lt;blockquote&gt;The [[New Zealand Parliament|legislature]] did not see fit to address the peak indebtedness rule, or to include it in the wording of s 292(4B). ...The effect of the section, taken on its face, is to require all payments and transactions within the continuing business relationship to be netted off against one another. This includes both payments to the creditor and the supply of goods to the debtor. Of course where the business relationship began before the start of the two year period, only the transactions occurring within the period are taken into account. The statutory wording does not permit a liquidator to disregard some of those transactions. There is also no basis on which the liquidator can commence with only the first payment, and disregard the first supply of goods. The plain meaning of “all transactions” is just that.&lt;ref&gt;''Timberworld Ltd v Levin'' [2015] NZCA 111 at [99].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Furthermore, Stevens J observed that similarly to the rule in ''[[Allied Concrete Ltd v Meltzer]]'' [2015] NZSC 7, &lt;blockquote&gt;The distinct treatment of trade creditors is, in our view, a similar mechanism. Parliament took the decision to set aside a particular group of creditors who continue to provide credit and goods on the assumption of future trade. That is seen as having distinct commercial benefits in the context of [[liquidation]]. It is a policy choice consistent with New Zealand’s insolvency scheme generally.&lt;ref&gt;''Timberworld Ltd v Levin'' [2015] NZCA 111 at [98].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The '''Uniform Power of Attorney Act''' (2006) (UPOAA) was a law proposed by the [[Uniform Law Commission|National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws (ULC)]] to create a uniform framework for [[power of attorney]] provisions throughout the United States.

== History ==
Prior to the debate regarding the proposal to create a uniform framework for power of attorney, provisions regarding power of attorney were left up to each state to decide. But, their existence was assume in the [[Uniform Probate Code]], which the ULC had promulgated in 1969.

Since a normal power of attorney ends once its purpose has been fulfilled or the principle is incapacitated, states made a distinction between this normal power of attorney and a ''durable'' power of attorney, which "remains in effect even when the principal becomes incapacitated."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alegant|first=Brian|date=1999|title=When Even Becomes Odd: A Partitional Approach to Inversion|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3090660|journal=Journal of Music Theory|volume=43|issue=2|pages=193|doi=10.2307/3090660|issn=0022-2909}}&lt;/ref&gt; This prompted to ULC to create a uniform law regarding Durable Power of Attorney, which superseded the original Uniform Probate Code.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.uniformlaws.org/ActSummary.aspx?title=Durable%20Power%20of%20Attorney|title=Durable Power of Attorney Summary|website=www.uniformlaws.org|access-date=2018-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Act ==
The UPOAA was designed to correct shortcomings of both the Uniform Probate Code and the Durable Power of Attorney by supercedeing them both. It consisted of four distinct articles:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.uniformlaws.org/ActSummary.aspx?title=Power%20of%20Attorney|title=Power of Attorney Summary|website=www.uniformlaws.org|access-date=2018-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# The general rules governing the "creation and use" of power of attorney
# The definitions used by the UPOAA
# An optional form for use in granting power of attorney
# Other miscellaneous provisions regarding the UPOAA and other power of attorney laws

== Adoption ==
The ULC officially approved of the UPOAA and recommend that states adopt it in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.premierlegal.org/state-regulation-and-the-new-uniform-power-of-attorney-act/|title=State Regulation and the New Uniform Power of Attorney Act - PLG Nursing Home Abuse &amp; Neglect Personal Injury Attorney Los Angeles|date=2013-01-26|work=PLG Nursing Home Abuse &amp; Neglect Personal Injury Attorney Los Angeles|access-date=2018-09-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2011, every U.S. state, with the exception of Louisiana, has adopted and enacted the UPOAA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://info.legalzoom.com/uniform-power-attorney-act-20166.html|title=Uniform Power of Attorney Act|access-date=2018-09-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Henry Weinhard Brewery complex''', also the '''Cellar Building and Brewhouse''' and '''Henry Weinhard's City Brewery''', is a former [[brewery]] in [[Portland, Oregon]]. Since 2000, it has been listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].&lt;ref name="OPRD list"&gt;{{cite web|title=Oregon National Register List|publisher=Oregon Parks and Recreation Department|url=http://www.oregon.gov/OPRD/HCD/NATREG/docs/oregon_nr_list.pdf#page=42|page=42|format=PDF|date=June 6, 2011|access-date=2017-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that same year, construction began to reuse the property as a multi-block, [[mixed-use development]] known as the '''Brewery Blocks'''.

==Architecture==
The firm of [[Whidden &amp; Lewis]], Portland's pioneering architects, designed the Brewhouse. The building is designed in a [[medieval]] [[Tuscany|Tuscan]] style. Completed in 1908, other businesses in the area hired architects to emulate this design theme when building their own warehouses and industrial buildings.&lt;ref&gt;King, Bart: An Architectural Guidebook to Portland, pg. 181. Gibbs Smith, 2001 IBN 0-87905-991-5&lt;/ref&gt; At its highest level, the structure has six floors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==History==
[[Henry Weinhard]] purchased an existing brewery on this site, the City Brewery, in 1864. He then moved his operations to the then-two block site on West Burnside Street. Business boomed, and between 1865 and 1872 two additional blocks to the north were purchased. As many breweries also owned the saloons that sold their beer at the time, a large business empire owning properties throughout the Northwest, from [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]] to Canada was run from here. Weinhard's brewing business continued to expand to the point where he even offered to pipe beer directly to the [[Skidmore Fountain]]. This offer was declined by civic leaders. By 1890, the brewery produced 100,000 barrels of beer annually.

The present buildings were completed in 1908 in order to meet the expanding brewing needs of the Henry Weinhard brewing empire, now serving the [[Pacific Northwest]] and even the [[Philippines]] and [[China]]. Once [[Prohibition]] was enacted, the brewery managed to survive by brewing [[near-beer]] (a brew of less than 0.5 percent alcohol), [[syrup]]s and [[soft drink|sodas]] – such as [[root beer]], becoming a local bottler of national brands. Vanilla cream and other syrup products were marketed as "Gourmet Elixirs".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.breweryblocks.com/historical.html Key dates in the history of Blitz-Weinhard Brewery 1856-2000]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Weinhard Brewery from west with 1906 H. Weinhard sign and smokestack.jpg|thumb|left|Detail view of signage and deco-rative brickwork on the west façade and also the north façade of the six-story Malt House and Hop Building]]
Mergers with and sales to other breweries occurred over the years. A merger with competitor Portland Brewing brought the Blitz name into the formal name of the brewery. Arnold Blitz, who had owned Portland Brewing, became Chairman of the new Blitz-Weinhard company. The new company took 20 years to modernize the brewery and recover from Prohibition, which ended in 1933. In 1979, Blitz-Weinhard was sold to the [[Pabst Brewing Company]]. Pabst then sold the brewery to [[Stroh Brewing Company]] in 1996. The last and final sale of the company in 1999 had major effects on the brewery building. Stroh's sold the Henry Weinhard's brand to [[Miller Brewing Company]], and moved all Henry's brewing operations to the [[Olympia Brewery]] in [[Tumwater, Washington]]. After nearly 135 years of continual operations, the Weinhard Brewery brewed its last beer on August 27, 1999. It was put up for sale the following month.&lt;ref name="emporis.com"&gt;{{cite web

==Redevelopment==
In early 2000, local developers Gerdling-Edlen purchased the entire brewing complex, which consisted of five blocks by the end of brewing operations. GBD proceeded to develop a mixed-use area consisting of offices, retail, and condo towers known as the Brewery Blocks. As part of the project, historic buildings were to be preserved and integrated into the new development.&lt;ref name="emporis.com"/&gt; The brewhouse's historical importance was recognized with a listing on the National Register of Historic Places, along with the A.B. Smith Building's art deco facade, in August 2000, a year after brewing had ceased.

The renovated Brewhouse was completed in November 2002, after two years of extensive renovations. The west side of the Brewhouse's low as developed into Brewery Tower, an office building. The upper floors of the historic buildings are office space, and the first floors contain retail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
