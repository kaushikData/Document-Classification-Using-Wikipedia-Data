The '''Acts of Parliament (Commencement) Act 1793''' (33 Geo. 3 c. 13) was an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of Great Britain|Parliament]] of the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] which provided that Acts of Parliament would [[coming into force|come into force]] on the date on which they received royal assent, unless they specified some other date, instead of the first day of the session in which they were passed.

==Commencement of Acts of Parliament prior to this Act==

Previously, Acts of Parliament came into force on the first day of the session in which they were passed, because of the [[legal fiction]] that a session lasted one day.&lt;ref&gt;''Partridge v. Strange and Croker'' (1553) 1 Plowd. 77&lt;/ref&gt; This meant that all Acts came into force [[ex post facto law|retroactively]], and that an Act could come into force on a date a year before it was actually passed. The preamble to this Act said that this was liable to produce "great and manifest injustice".

==Provisions of this Act==

This Act provides that it applies to Acts of Parliament passed after 8 April 1793.

===Endorsement of Acts with the date of royal assent===

This Act imposes a duty on the [[Clerk of the Parliaments]] to endorse any Act which passes with the date ("the day, month and year") on which that Act passed and received [[royal assent]]. It provides that the date must be written, in English, immediately after the [[long title|title]] of that Act, and that that endorsement is part of the endorsed Act.

===Commencement of Acts===

This Act originally provided that the endorsed Act was to come into force on the date specified by the endorsement, where no other commencement was specified by the endorsed Act. The relevant words were repealed,&lt;ref&gt;The [[Interpretation Act 1978]], section 25(1) and Schedule 3&lt;/ref&gt; on 1 January 1979&lt;ref&gt;The [[Interpretation Act 1978]], section 26&lt;/ref&gt; and have been replaced by section 4 of the [[Interpretation Act 1978]], which says the same thing.

==Dating of Acts==
Because of the fiction that an Act had come into force on the first day of the session, it was also the convention in citing a pre-1793 Act to date it to the year in which the session had commenced. In the context of modern historical writing, however, it is more usual to date Acts (especially well-known and historically significant Acts) to the actual year in which they passed through Parliament. This leads to discrepancies in the way in which the same Act may be cited or referred to: for example, the [[Act of Uniformity 1558|Act of Uniformity]] (1 Eliz 1 c 2) is often dated to 1558 in legal contexts, but to 1559 in historical contexts; the [[Toleration Act 1688|Toleration Act]] (1 Will &amp; Mary c 18) to 1688 in legal contexts, but 1689 in historical contexts; the [[Bill of Rights 1689|Bill of Rights]] (1 Will &amp; Mary sess 2 c 2) to 1688 in legal contexts, but 1689 in historical contexts; and the [[Acts of Union 1707|Union with Scotland Act]] (6 Anne c 11) to 1706 in legal contexts, but 1707 in historical contexts.

{{update|date=May 2013}}
{{Redirect|Link tax|the EU-wide version|Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single Market}}
The so-called '''ancillary copyright for press publishers'''&lt;ref&gt;The terms "related rights" and "neighbouring rights" are also used, but they cannot conveniently stand on their own when not preceded by "copyright".&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang-de|'''Leistungsschutzrecht für Presseverleger'''}}) is a proposal incorporated in 2012 legislation proposed by the ruling coalition of the German government, led by [[Angela Merkel]] of the [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian Democratic Union]] (CDU), to extend publishers' copyrights. The [[bill (proposed law)|bill]] was agreed by the [[Cabinet of Germany|Cabinet]] at the end of August 2012 and submitted to [[Bundestag|parliament]] on 14 November 2012. It was passed by the {{lang|de|[[Bundestag]]}} on 1 March 2013 by 293 to 243, following substantial changes in the week before the vote.&lt;!-- {{As of|2012|03|04}}, the bill has still to pass the ''{{lang|de|[[Bundesrat of Germany|Bundesrat]]}}''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Leistungsschutzrecht: Bundestag beschließt Google-Gesetz |language=German |trans-title=Ancillary Copyright: Bundestag passes Google bill |url=http://www.spiegel.de/netzwelt/netzpolitik/leistungsschutzrecht-bundestag-beschliesst-google-gesetz-a-886270.html |work=[[Der Spiegel]] |date=1 March 2013 |accessdate=4 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;

In its original form, the law would have forced Internet content providers to pay fees, collected by a central clearinghouse,&lt;ref name=Schwartz&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.informationweek.com/government/policy/germany-wants-to-charge-google-for-news/240005926 |title=Germany wants to charge Google for news snippets |work=InformationWeek Government |date=2012-08-22 |author=Matthew J. Schwartz }}&lt;/ref&gt; to publishers for displaying their content: fees would have been levied for even short snippets of news made available by [[news aggregators]] and [[web search engines]].&lt;ref name="Pfanner"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/12/business/global/germany-trying-to-cut-publishers-in-on-web-profits.html |title=Germany trying to cut publishers in on web profits |work=[[The New York Times]] |author=Eric Pfanner |date=2012-03-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The intended effect would have been to force [[Google]], a leading search engine, to pay publishers fees for display of news search results, causing the bill to be dubbed a "[[Google tax]]" by some.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ghacks.net/2012/08/30/germanys-google-tax-is-a-go/|title=Germany’s Google Tax is a go |work=Ghacks Technology News |author=Martin Brinkmann |date=2012-08-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It would give press agencies the exclusive right to publish press releases for commercial purposes on the Internet&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Ministerium nimmt Google ins Visier | publisher = N24 - Gesellschaft für Nachrichten und Zeitgeschehen mbH | date = 28 August 2012 | url = http://www.n24.de/news/newsitem_8174482.html | accessdate = 30 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clarify|date=August 2012}} and would require [[search engines]] such as [[Google]] to obtain licenses for using small text passages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Geld von Google - Kabinett beschließt umstrittenes Leistungsschutzrecht | newspaper = Spiegel Online - Netzwelt | location = Hamburg | language = German | publisher = Spiegel Online | date = 29 August 2012 | url = http://www.spiegel.de/netzwelt/netzpolitik/geld-von-google-kabinett-beschliesst-umstrittenes-leistungsschutzrecht-a-852715.html | accessdate = 30 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Google spokesman called it  ''"a black day for the Internet in Germany"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Google lehnt Lizenzierungspflicht ab | newspaper = Spiegel Online - Netzwelt | location = Hamburg | language = German | publisher = Spiegel Online | date = 29 August 2012 | url = http://www.spiegel.de/netzwelt/netzpolitik/google-lehnt-lizenzierungspflicht-ab-a-852775.html | accessdate = 30 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many [[trade association]]s regard it as useless&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Leistungsschutzrecht: Die Axt an der Wurzel der Marktwirtschaft | newspaper = FOCUS Online | language = German | date = 29 August 2012 | url = http://www.focus.de/kultur/diverses/verbaende-leistungsschutzrecht-die-axt-an-der-wurzel-der-marktwirtschaft_aid_809047.html | accessdate = 30 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and critics fear a reduction in diversity of opinion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Leistungsschutzrecht: Suchmaschinen müssen zahlen | newspaper = Welt Online | language = German | date = 30 August 2012 | url = https://www.welt.de/print/welt_kompakt/webwelt/article108866798/Leistungsschutzrecht-Suchmaschinen-muessen-zahlen.html | accessdate = 30 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wikimedia Deutschland]] regards this as dangerous ''"for the creators of free content in general and for providers of open content platforms in particular"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Hedemann | first = F. | title = Leistungsschutzrecht: Wikipedia bald ohne Links? | work = t3n | publisher = yeebase media GmbH | date = 15 June 2012 | url = http://t3n.de/news/leistungsschutzrecht-wikipedia-395508/ | accessdate = 30 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was agreed between the coalition parties, the [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|CDU]] and the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|FDP]]  in their coalition agreement for the 17th session of the German ''{{lang|de|[[Bundestag]]}}''.

It passed in the {{lang|de|[[Bundesrat of Germany|Bundesrat]]}} March 22, 2013, was published in the {{lang|de|[[Bundesgesetzblatt (Germany)|Bundesgesetzblatt]]}} May 14, and came into force on August 1, 2013.

== History ==
[[Copyright law of Germany|German copyright law]] already provides for similar "[[related rights]]" in relation to other protected objects. They are regulated in sections 70 ''{{lang|la|et seq.}}'' of the German Copyright Act (''{{lang|de|Urheberrechtsgesetz}}''). A press release from the German Federal Association of Newspaper Publishers (''{{lang|de|Bundesverband Deutscher Zeitungsverleger}}'', BDZV) dated 7 May 2009 justified the demand for such a "related right" for press publishers on the grounds that  press enterprises  needed to defend themselves against unpaid use of their products on the Internet. This demand found its expression in the coalition agreement, which, in line 4776, states:
{{Quotation| 
Publishers should not be placed in a worse position in the online field than other disseminators of a work. We therefore propose to create a related right for press publishers to improve the protection of press products on the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;Original German: ''{{lang|de|Verlage sollen im Online-Bereich nicht schlechter gestellt werden als andere Werkvermittler. Wir streben deshalb die Schaffung eines Leistungsschutzrechts für Presseverlage zur Verbesserung des Schutzes von Presseerzeugnissen im Internet an.}}''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In a speech to the Newspaper Congress of the German  Federal Association of Newspaper Publishers in September 2011, the [[chancellor of Germany|chancellor]], [[Angela Merkel]], stated that legislation on such related rights was in preparation:
{{Quotation| 
Publishing costs time and money. For this reason, I can understand the demand for related rights for publishers. The [[Cabinet of Germany|Federal Government]] is therefore currently working on a bill to adapt German copyright law even more to the requirements of a modern [[information society]]. We have not forgotten it; it is being pushed forward. We are striving for a balanced solution that takes account of the just interests of all those involved.&lt;ref&gt;Original German: ''{{lang|de|Verlegerische Leistungen kosten Zeit und Geld. Deswegen kann ich auch gut verstehen, dass ein Leistungsschutzrecht für Verleger gefordert wird. Deshalb arbeitet die Bundesregierung derzeit an einem Gesetzentwurf, der das Urheberrecht weiter an die Anforderungen einer modernen Informationsgesellschaft anpassen soll. Wir haben es nicht vergessen; es wird vorangetrieben. Wir streben eine ausgewogene Regelung an, die den berechtigten Interessen aller Beteiligten Rechnung trägt.}}''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Merkel also announced that she would  push the idea at the European level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bundesregierung.de/nn_1498/Content/DE/Rede/2011/09/2011-09-19-bkin-zeitung.html |title=Rede von Bundeskanzlerin Angela Merkel anlässlich des Zeitungskongresses des Bundesverbandes Deutscher Zeitungsverleger e.V. |trans-title=Speech by Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel at the Newspaper Congress of the Federal Association of German Newspaper Publishers |author=Angela Merkel |authorlink=Angela Merkel |date=19 September 2011 |publisher=German Bundesregierung |location=Berlin |language=German |accessdate=2012-08-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120915210020/http://www.bundesregierung.de/nn_1498/Content/DE/Rede/2011/09/2011-09-19-bkin-zeitung.html |archivedate=15 September 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://netzpolitik.org/2011/merkel-rede-beim-bdzv-zu-medien-und-internet/ |title=Merkel-Rede beim BDZV zu Medien und Internet (including recording) |trans-title=Merkel's speech at the BDZV on the media and the Internet |author=Florian Altherr |date=21 September 2011 |language=German |accessdate=2012-08-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 March 2012, the joint coalition committee agreed to introduce "related rights" for press publishers  as part of the third basket of the reform of the German Copyright Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://leistungsschutzrecht.info/news/2012-03-05/koalitionssauschuss-einigt-sich-auf-leistungsschutzrecht |title=Koalitionsauschuss einigt sich auf Leistungsschutzrecht |trans-title=Coalition committee agrees on intellectual property right |author=David Pachali |date=5 March 2012 |publisher=IGEL Initiative gegen Leistungsschutzrecht |language=German |accessdate=2012-08-31 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; Within a year, the commercial use of press products on the Internet, particularly for search engine providers and news aggregators, was to be subject to a charge. There was to be the equivalent of a performing rights society for collection and distribution of the fees. One thing that remains unclear is where the line should be drawn between chargeable commercial use and private use, which was to remain free.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/Koalition-Verlage-sollen-Geld-von-News-Aggregatoren-erhalten-1447608.html |title=Koalition: Verlage sollen Geld von News-Aggregatoren erhalten |trans-title=Coalition: publishers should receive money from news aggregators |date=5 March 2012 |work=[[Heinz Heise|Heise online]] |language=German |accessdate=2012-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 June 2012, it became known that the German [[Federal Ministry of Justice (Germany)|Federal Ministry of Justice]] had sent a draft of a [[bill (proposed law)|bill]] to other ministries and lobby groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/Justizministerium-legt-Entwurf-fuer-neues-Leistungsschutzrecht-vor-1617614.html |title=Justizministerium legt Entwurf für neues Leistungsschutzrecht vor |trans-title=Ministry of Justice shall submit draft for a new intellectual property right |work=[[Heinz Heise|Heise online]] |language=German |accessdate=2012-08-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This draft, which would insert new sub-sections 87f to 87h into the German Copyright Act is currently available on the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.irights.info/userfiles/RefE%20LSR.pdf |title=Referentenentwurf des Bundesministeriums der Justiz: Entwurf eines Siebenten Gesetzes zur Änderung des Urheberrechtsgesetzes |trans-title=Draft of the Federal Ministry of Justice: draft Seventh Law amending the Copyright Law |date=13 June 2012 |publisher= |language=German |format=PDF |accessdate=2012-08-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 August 2016, [[Statewatch]] published a draft of the [[European Commission]]'s impact assessment on the modernisation of EU copyright rules. This draft states that the Commission will indeed propose the introduction of an EU wide ancillary copyright for news publishers, contradicting reassurances from [[Andrus Ansip]] that no link tax would be introduced.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.communia-association.org/2016/08/25/eu-commission-yes-will-create-new-ancillary-copyright-news-publishers-please-stop-calling-link-tax/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.openforumeurope.org/taking-bad-idea-making-worse-ancillary-copyright-snippets-disguised-neighbouring-right-publishers/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impact ==
Numerous German publishers entered a zero-cost licensing agreement with Google so that their content continued to be displayed on Google News.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.asktheeu.org/en/request/4906/response/16686/attach/6/C%202018%202107%200%20ANNEX%20EN%20V1%20P1%20972490.PDF.pdf|title=The Economic Impact of Online News Intermediaries|last=|first=|authors=Anonymous [[Joint Research Centre]] employee|date=June 2016|publisher=|via=AskTheEU.org|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Issues ==
=== Free speech ===
Opponents of the measure believe that granting copyright protection to what may be little more than headlines violates the [[freedom of speech]].  [[Till Kreutzer]] of the [[Bureau for Information Law Expertise]] wrote in 2011 that this expansion of copyright, sought by publishers since 2009, could cause "collateral damage to fundamental freedoms like the freedom of the press, the freedom of expression, the freedom of science and education as well as the communication and publication practices on the Web."&lt;ref name="Schwartz"/&gt;

Supporters have stated that freedom of speech would be protected because "journalistic citations from news articles" would be exempt from the bill, as would private Internet users.&lt;ref name="Pfanner"/&gt;  Publishers perceive the fees as fair compensation for the effort put into reporting; in an example presented at a hearing on the bill, "a bank employee reads his morning newspaper online and sees something about the steel industry, and then advises his clients to invest in certain markets ... The publishers argued that the bank consultant was only able to advise his clients because of the journalistic work in the published article.  So that means the publisher deserves a fair share of any money made"&lt;ref name="Schwartz"/&gt;

=== Consistency with other copyright law ===
According to [[Till Kreuzer]], writing in ''[[Computer Law &amp; Security Review]]'' and cited by a group opposing the bill, ''{{lang|de|[[Initiative Gegen ein Leistungsschutzrecht]]}}'', the 2009 German coalition government announced in its coalition contract that "Press Publishers shall not be discriminated against other disseminators of copyright protected works [e.g. film or music producers]. Therefore we aim for the introduction of a [[neighbouring right]] for press publishers to increase the protection of press publications on the Internet."  However, Kreuzer disputed that the proposed right is comparable to neighboring rights for other forms of copyrighted media, writing that the regulation of extraction of snippets from news sources and regulation of the right to read ("reception") of the sites containing media were unprecedented in the law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://leistungsschutzrecht.info/stimmen-zum-lsr/fachpublikation/german-copyright-policy-2011-introduction-of-a-new-neighbouring-right-for-press-publishers |title=German copyright policy 2011: Introduction of a new neighbouring right for press publishers? |author=Till Kreuzer |publisher=Computer Law &amp; Security Review |volume=27 |year=2011 |pages=214–16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Disbursements ===
The co-founder of {{lang|de|[[Perlentaucher]]}} questioned what criteria would be used to determine eligibility to receive payments from the clearinghouse, noting that if every blog were eligible, benefits to newspapers would be very small.  These criteria remain under consideration by drafters of the proposal.&lt;ref name="Pfanner"/&gt;

=== Author's right ===
German authors of news articles retain [[Deutsches Urheberrecht|author's right]] to control news articles after their publication, raising the question of how payments would be divided between publishers and authors.&lt;ref name="Pfanner"/&gt;

=== Economic considerations ===
The [[Federation of German Newspaper Publishers]] issued a statement that "In the digital age, such a right is essential to protect the joint efforts of journalists and publishers," describing such revenues as "an essential measure for the maintenance of an independent, privately financed news media."&lt;ref name="Schwartz"/&gt;

A spokesman of Google denounced the proposal: "We don't have any sympathy for these plans, as an ancillary copyright lacks all factual, economic, and legal foundation.  And we are not alone with this opinion: The Federation of German Industries (BDI) and 28 other associations vehemently oppose an ancillary copyright for publishers. The [[German parliament]] is divided on the issue as well. For a good reason: An ancillary copyright would mean a massive damage to the German economy. It's a threat to the freedom of information. And it would leave Germany behind internationally as a place for business."  Critics have suggested that Google might respond to the law by ceasing to do business in Germany.&lt;ref name="Schwartz"/&gt;

== Comparisons with other countries ==
''[[The New York Times]]'' quoted [[Cristoph Keese]], described as "co-chairman of a copyright committee of German publishers" and president of public affairs for [[Axel Springer]], "There is no other developed country that has given publishers this kind of right against aggregators.  This could be a benchmark."  The ''Times'' compared the measure to [[NewsRight]], a system introduced by the ''Times'' and other newspapers, that tracks unpaid use of articles, while noting that the NewsRight system does not address the use of snippets.&lt;ref name="Pfanner"/&gt;

'''Baidu Wangpan''' ({{zh|c=[[:zh:百度网盘|百度网盘]] |p=Bǎidù Wǎngpán}}; translation: Baidu Web Drive) is a [[Cloud storage service|Cloud]] service provided by [[Baidu, Inc.]], headquartered in Haidian District in [[Beijing]]. It offers a [[cloud storage service]], [[client software]], file management, resources sharing, and Third Party Integration. After being created on one client terminal, files can be synchronized automatically on other internet-connected client terminals. It was launched as Baidu WangPan on 23 March 2012. On 22 August 2013, an offer of permanent free 2 [[Terabyte]]s storage for users was announced.&lt;ref name="baike.baidu.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://baike.baidu.com/view/8194353.htm|title=百度网盘_百度百科|publisher=baike.baidu.com|accessdate=31 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Launch of Baidu WangPan===

The March 2012 Baidu Developer Conference released a Cloud development strategy, including the launch of a Developer Center Website (http://developer.baidu.com/en/)
,&lt;ref name="en.0430.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.0430.com/cn/web34295/|title=Baidu is clouds Web site - Chinese Website Library|publisher=en.0430.com|accessdate=31 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and
a cloud storage platform called Baidu WangPan, meaning "web disk", for individual users. Baidu WangPan had PC and Android client terminals, provided users a free 15 GB of space and allowed users to upload files and access them. It operated in competition with established Cloud operations such as [[Dropbox (service)|Dropbox]].&lt;ref name="techinasia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.techinasia.com/baidu-cloud-storage-service/|title=Baidu Takes Aim at Dropbox, Microsoft's SkyDrive, With New Cloud Storage Service|publisher=techinasia.com|accessdate=31 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Investment in Cloud Computing Center===
On 19 August 2012, Baidu started to build its Cloud Computing Center in [[Shanxi]]'s Yangquan, which is the hometown of Baidu's Founder [[Robin Li]]. Baidu was reported to invest CNY4.708&amp;nbsp;billion in this center, with CNY2.92&amp;nbsp;billion for equipment and CNY1.788&amp;nbsp;billion for infrastructure. It aimed to "attract the world's top information technology manufacturers, and promote the information technology industry development in Yangquan and Shanxi."&lt;ref name="chinatechnews"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinatechnews.com/2012/08/24/16580-baidu-pushes-cloud-computing-resources-to-shanxi|title=Baidu Pushes Cloud Computing Resources To Shanxi |publisher=chinatechnews.com|accessdate=31 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Upgrade to Baidu Cloud===

During the 2012 Baidu World Conference, Baidu announced upgrades to Baidu WangPan, and a re-branding to "Baidu Cloud". It also launched a new logo, using graphics of clouds, which has been used since.&lt;ref name="sina"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.sina.com.cn/s/blog_600ffe4d01012isf.html|title=百度网盘升级为百度云并启用新Logo_视觉会visionclub_新浪博客|publisher=blog.sina.com.cn|accessdate=31 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It also issued "seven weapons" for developers, including: PCS, Screen X technical building services Site App, applications, cloud MTC LBS moving clouds, cloud Test Engine, Baidu engine BAE, and kernel browsing.&lt;ref name="en.0430.com"/&gt;

===Partnership with Qualcomm===
On 19 November 2012, Baidu offered free cloud storage for [[Qualcomm]] chip-based devices. It provided [[Snapdragon]]-powered Android phones with 30GB cloud storage, which had been tailored to suit the Snapdragon S4 MSM 8×25 processor and the Snapdragon S4 MSM8x25Q processor.&lt;ref name="computerworld"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9233819/Baidu_offers_free_cloud_storage_to_Qualcomm_chip_based_devices|title=Baidu offers free cloud storage to Qualcomm chip-based devices - Computerworld|author=Michael Kan|publisher=computerworld.com|date=19 November 2012|accessdate=31 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Participation in Chinese Cloud Storage War===
On 22 August 2013, Baidu Cloud announced its offer of 2 Terabytes of free permanent storage for users, as its strategy in the Cloud Storage 'war' in China. The other competitors in the war included [[Tencent]], and [[Qihoo 360]], [[Sina Corp|Sina]], [[Huawei]], 115.com. Before the war, China’s free storage services were mainly focused on storage capacity under 15GB.&lt;ref name="linustechtips"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://linustechtips.com/main/topic/56904-cloud-storage-war-in-china/|title=Cloud Storage War in China |publisher=linustechtips.com|accessdate=31 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rename to Baidu Wangpan===

On 11 October 2016, Baidu Yun were renamed to Baidu Wangpan. Meanwhile, its cloud computing services were renamed to Baidu Yun.

==Technology==

===File management===
Baidu Wangpan supports preview of files of photos, musics, videos and documents on each of its client terminal without downloading them as local files. The videos can be viewed directly on the [[web browser]]s, Android system, and [[iOS]] system. It provides file synchronization, enabling users to upload and download files of different types. It supports file sharing between different users, and different devices.&lt;ref name="baidu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://baike.baidu.com/view/9273222.htm#4|title=百度云_百度百科|publisher=baike.baidu.com|accessdate=31 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Resource sharing===
Baidu Wangpan provides a platform to share resources. Combined with its own search engine, users can search resources and browse them online.&lt;ref name="pv22"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pv22.com/archives/fa4125acaeb08928ac7092b0/|title=Baidu cloud music video playback.|publisher=pv22.com|accessdate=31 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Third party integration===
Baidu's cloud operation can be divided into two main categories: 1. Personal users (http://yun.baidu.com), and 2. Developers (http://developer.baidu.com/en), which is the Open Cloud.&lt;ref name="thegmic"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.thegmic.com/2013/08/12/baidu-cloud-hackathon-singapore-testing-waters-southeast-asia/9431|title=Baidu Cloud Hackathon in Singapore: Testing the Waters in Southeast Asia|publisher=blog.thegmic.com|accessdate=31 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversy ==
On 26 December 2013, the Japanese government's National Information Security Center (NISC) and Ministry of Education, Culture, Science and Technology advised 140 institutions to either disable the cloud-input function of Baidu Input Method Editors (IMEs) or stop using Baidu IMEs. According to Bloomberg News, Tsuneo Tosaka, IDC Japan's Software &amp; Security Research Manager claimed: "Baidu provides the service using a cloud server, which means content flows through servers in China" and "Government-related documents from Japan central ministries and findings from university research institutions are important, so there is a possibility that sensitive information leaks abroad." NISC also suggested not using Google input software and Microsoft input software.&lt;ref name="bloomberg"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-12-26/japan-warns-of-security-risk-in-software-used-for-language-input.html|title=Japan Warns of Security Risk in Software for Language Input|publisher=bloomberg.com|accessdate=31 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baidu denied the claim and responded that the function aims to improve users' experience and vocabulary habits in the cloud, and "the content uploaded to its server does not contain any personal and private information and the only aim of uploading is to improve users' experience". It also said that there is no illegal uploading behavior or information leakage risk, as the uploaded information and servers are kept and managed in Japan.&lt;ref name="globaltimes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/834373.shtml|title=Japanese govt warns against Baidu input|publisher=globaltimes.cn|accessdate=28 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''bare trust''' is a [[trust law|trust]] in which the [[beneficiary (trust)|beneficiary]] has a [[right]] to both [[income]] and capital and may call for both to be remitted into his own name.  Assets in a bare trust are held in the name of a trustee, but the beneficiary has the right to all of the capital and income of the trust at any time if they’re 18 or over (in England and Wales), or 16 or over (in Scotland). Bare trusts are often used to pass assets to young people - the trustees look after them until the beneficiary is old enough.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/trusts/types/bare.htm | title=Bare trusts | publisher=[[HM Revenue &amp; Customs]], UK | accessdate=April 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Australia==

Recent amendments to the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 (SIS Act), allow superannuation funds to invest in any kind of asset and to borrow, charging those assets so long as there is no recourse for the borrowing against the superannuation fund. New section 67A &amp; 67B provides that a fund can borrow money if:

1.  the borrowed monies are used to acquire an asset which the fund is not otherwise prohibited from acquiring

2.  the asset acquired (or a replacement asset) is held on trust (the holding trust) so the fund receives a beneficial interest in the asset

3.  the SMSF has the right to acquire legal ownership of the asset (or, if applicable, the replacement asset) by making one or more payments after acquiring the beneficial interest

4.  any recourse the lender has under the arrangement against the SMSF trustee is limited to rights relating to the asset acquired (or, if applicable, the replacement asset). For example, the lender can have the right to recover outstanding amounts where there is a default on the borrowing by repossessing or disposing of the asset being acquired under the arrangement, but cannot have the right to recover such amounts through recourse to the fund's other assets.

The Bare Trust Deed Trust Deed is a key document. Care is required to ensure there are no adverse GST, taxation or stamp duty consequences. The legal and beneficial interests in the property must be separated, so that an entity separate from the Superannuation Fund Trustee holds the legal title, while the Superannuation Fund Trustee holds the beneficial interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ato.gov.au/super/self-managed-super-funds/in-detail/smsf-resources/smsf-technical/limited-recourse-borrowing-arrangements-by-self-managed-super-funds---questions-and-answers/?page%3D8 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-03-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402121240/https://www.ato.gov.au/super/self-managed-super-funds/in-detail/smsf-resources/smsf-technical/limited-recourse-borrowing-arrangements-by-self-managed-super-funds---questions-and-answers/?page=8 |archivedate=2015-04-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A case that deals with the limited powers of a bare trustee to deal with trust assets is Caterpillar Financial Australia Ltd v Ovens Nominees Pty Ltd [2011] FCA 677 which considered the law relating to the duties, powers and rights of a bare trustee in a winding up.&lt;ref name=ccw&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.corrs.com.au/publications/tgif/limited-powers-of-a-bare-trustee-to-deal-with-trust-assets/ | title=Limited powers of a bare trustee to deal with trust assets | publisher=[[Corrs Chambers Westgarth]]| accessdate=August 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This case is an important reminder to practitioners of some of the difficulties that can arise where an insolvent company owns property as a corporate trustee. Care should be taken to carefully review the trust deed on appointment to ensure the trustee retains its powers to sell trust assets.&lt;ref name=ccw/&gt;

'''''Bibb County School District vs. Wickman''''' (2005) was a case heard before the Supreme Court of the State of Alabama. It ruled that a policy permitting student-led, student-initiated prayer at football games held at private venues and initiated by personnel of said venue does not violate the [[Establishment Clause of the First Amendment|Establishment Clause]] of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]]. [[Oral argument]]s were heard April 6, 2005. The court announced its decision on June 27, holding the policy constitutional in a 6-3 decision. [[School prayer]] is a controversial topic in American jurisprudence.

==Background of the case==
The [[Bibb County School District]] (BCSD), a [[school district]] in [[Alabama]] between [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]] and [[Montgomery, Alabama|Montgomery]], allowed students to offer [[Prayer in Christianity|Christian prayers]] over the [[public address system]] at home football games held off of school property at a private venue. These prayers were given by a student selected by the director of the private venue.

A pair of former students and their father&amp;mdash;a [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|Mormon]], objected to this practice and filed a suit on the basis of a violation of the Establishment Clause. These are the Wickmans.

During the litigation, the school held its policy: as long as they held football games off of school district property and off of property controlled by the county, they would allow students to pray before sporting events if the director(s) of the venue holding the event invited a student to pray over the stadium's public announcement system.

The district court allowed this policy, though it required that they be [[nonsectarian]] and non-[[Proselytism|proselytizing]]. The judge's main authority was ''Thomas v. Dothan SD'' (Dothan SD being another Alabama school district), which allows certain types of school prayers at sporting events. The district court's final judgment was in December 2003.

The Wickmans appealed to the Alabama Supreme Court. The Wickmans appealed, wanting the football prayers found unconstitutional altogether, citing [[Santa Fe Independent School Dist. v. Doe]].

The Wickmans chose not to appeal to the United States Supreme Court after the decision was rendered, since Bibb County took possession of all sporting venues within the county, effectively eliminating their right to pray prior to school events. This did not, however, nullify the court's decision.

==The court's decision==
The Court held that the policy allowing the student-led prayer at the football games was constitutional and in no way violated the establishment clause of the first amendment to the constitution.  The majority opinion, written by Chief Justice [[Sue Bell Cobb|Cobb]] depended on [[Santa Fe Independent School Dist. v. Doe]], 530 U.S. 290 and [[Lee v. Weisman]], 505 U.S. 577. It held that pre-game prayers delivered on school property, at school-sponsored events, over the school's public address system, by a speaker representing the student body, under the supervision of school faculty, and pursuant to a school policy that explicitly and implicitly encourages public prayer are public speech, but that the school, and by definition the district and state were not fully represented when the school was invited to play off school property, using facilities not owned, operated, or related to the school faculty, and therefore the state was not responsible for prayers made by students, if said student was invited by the operation staffs of the private facility being used.

A dissenting opinion was written by Justice [[Patricia M. Smith|Smith]], joined by Justices [[Glenn Murdoch|Murdoch]] and [[Greg Shaw (judge)|Shaw]]. Her dissent stated that the majority opinion "failed to recognize the many precedents set throughout the years, both on the state and national level, especially the Santa Fe ISD case, which explicitly outlaw prayer sponsored by public institutions in any way".

==Enforcement==
It was a requirement that an [[affidavit]] be sworn in front of a [[Justice of the Peace]] (usually by a relative of the deceased), confirming burial in wool, with the punishment of a £5 fee for noncompliance.  Burial entries in [[parish register]]s were marked with the word "affidavit" or its  equivalent to confirm that affidavit had been sworn; it would be marked "naked" for those too poor to afford the woollen shroud.  

The legislation was in force until 1814, but was generally ignored after 1770.{{cn|date=March 2013}} The 1666 Act was repealed by the [[Statute Law Revision Act 1863]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=u7ouAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA659 Statute Law Revision Act 1863] (26 &amp; 27 Vict c 125) from [[Google Books]]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chaïm Perelman''' (20 May 1912, [[Warsaw]] – 22 January 1984, [[Brussels]]) was a [[Poland|Polish]]-born [[philosophy of law|philosopher of law]], who studied, taught, and lived most of his life in [[Brussels]].  He was among the most important [[argumentation]] theorists of the twentieth century. His chief work is the ''Traité de l'argumentation – la nouvelle rhétorique'' (1958), with [[Lucie Olbrechts-Tyteca]], translated into English as ''The New Rhetoric: A Treatise on Argumentation'', by John Wilkinson and Purcell Weaver (1969).

== Life and work ==
Perelman and his family emigrated from [[Warsaw]] to [[Antwerp]], [[Belgium]] in 1925. He began his undergraduate studies at the [[Université Libre de Bruxelles]], where he would remain for the duration of his career. He earned a doctorate in law in 1934, and after completing a dissertation on the philosopher and mathematician [[Gottlob Frege]], earned a second doctorate in 1938. In the same year, Perelman was appointed lecturer at Brussels in the Faculty of Philosophy and Letters. By the end of the war, he became the youngest full professor in the history of that university.

Perelman’s initial research in law and philosophy was carried out under the [[aegis]] of [[logical positivism]]. In 1944, he completed an [[empiricism|empiricist]] study of justice and concluded that since applications of the law always involve value judgments – and since values cannot be subjected to the rigors of logic – the foundations of justice must be arbitrary. Upon completing the study, Perelman considered its conclusion untenable since value judgments form an integral part of all practical reasoning and decision making, and to claim that these judgments lack any logical basis was to deny the rational foundations of philosophy, law, [[politics]], and [[ethics]].

As a result of his empiricist study of justice, Perelman rejected positivism in favour of regressive philosophies that provided a rationale for value judgments.  In 1948, he met [[Lucie Olbrechts-Tyteca]], who had also attended the Université Libre de Bruxelles, and began collaborating on a project that would eventually establish ancient [[rhetoric]] as the foundation for a logic of value judgments.

In 1958, Perelman and Olbrechts-Tyteca published their study of informal reasoning as ''Traité de l'argumentation: la nouvelle rhétorique''. Undertaken in the spirit of Fregian observation and synthesis, the work analyzed a wide range of actual [[argument]]s from the realms of philosophy, law, politics, ethics, and [[journalism]]. The result was a theory of [[argumentation]] that was grounded in considerations of value and audience and that outlined points of departure and general techniques for argument.

In 1962, Perelman was invited by Henry W. Johnstone and Robert Oliver to take a position at [[Pennsylvania State University]] as a distinguished visiting professor. The collaboration between Johnstone and Perelman in particular, which had begun prior to the publication of ''la nouvelle rhétorique'', proved fruitful. Johnstone created the influential journal ''Philosophy and Rhetoric'', and Perelman became established in the United States as a leading argumentation theorist.

Throughout the next two decades, Perelman continued publishing works related to or derived from the ''New rhetoric''. He also made significant contributions to studies in law as director of the National Center for Research in Logic at the Université Libre de Bruxelles, and through continued publications on legal philosophy and argument. In 1973 he was one of the signers of the [[Humanist Manifesto II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.americanhumanist.org/Humanism/Humanist_Manifesto_II | title=Humanist Manifesto II | publisher = American Humanist Association | accessdate=9 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recognition of his academic and civic accomplishments, Perelman was appointed to the baronage by the Belgian legislature in December 1983. In 1962 Chaïm Perelman was awarded the [[Francqui Prize]] for Human Sciences. He died at his home in Brussels from a heart attack on 22 January 1985.

== Perelmanian philosophy ==
After completing {{Citation | language = French | title = De la justice | year = 1944}}, Perelman rejected the usefulness of logical positivism beyond its applications to pure science. In {{Citation | language = French | title = Philosophies premières et philosophie regressive,}} published five years later, he further outlined the limits of first philosophies or [[metaphysics]].  Because these approaches relied on a series of self-evident and mutually supporting axioms, any perceived error would disable the entire philosophy and its claims to reveal universal and absolute [[truth]]s. Prevalent alternatives, especially the [[relativism]] of [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], were also untenable for Perelman since the absolutes of metaphysics were merely replaced in these approaches by absolute [[skepticism]].

During his research with Olbrechts-Tyteca, Perelman would develop a philosophy that avoided the absolutes of both [[positivism]] and radical relativism. After encountering an excerpt of [[Brunetto Latini]] in the appendix of [[Jean Paulhan]]’s {{Citation | language = French | title = Les fleurs de Tarbes}}, Perelman began researching ancient Greco-Latin approaches to argumentation.  He found that while a specific logic of value judgments had never been established, an approach to the problem was apparent in the works of [[Aristotle]].  In the ''Posterior analytics'', Aristotle establishes the principles of demonstration or analytics, which rely on the accepted premises and necessary conclusions of the [[syllogism]]. In the ''Topics'' and elsewhere, Aristotle opposes the demonstrative approach to [[dialectics]], or [[rhetorical reason]]ing, which relies on premises that are acceptable in a given situation and are thus contingent. With Aristotle's distinctions, Perelman was able to perceive the contradiction of first philosophies: while claiming to reveal universal and absolute truths according to demonstrative methods, philosophy was in reality more concerned with persuading specific audiences to accept its claims. For Perelman, then, a viable philosophy – capable of establishing aspects of being and inducing reasonable action – must be constructed according to probabilities and must be able to withstand impositions of value and other contingencies stemming from its reception by particular audiences. Perelman’s approach, which he termed regressive philosophy, thus sought to incorporate socially constructed truths and to remain amenable to changes should those truths be modified.

While rhetoric and argumentation provided the core of Perelman’s philosophy, his regressive approach also shaped his treatise on non-formal argumentation. In the conclusion of the {{Citation | title = New rhetoric}}, Perelman and Olbrechts-Tyteca state that in opposition to the absolutes common in philosophy, their project acknowledges that "men and groups of men adhere to opinions of all sorts with a variable intensity" and that "these beliefs are not always self-evident, and they rarely deal with clear and distinct ideas." To uncover the logic that governs these beliefs and ideas, Perelman and Olbrechts-Tyteca rely on a regressive philosophy that accounts for the variability of particular situations and particular values. Perelman would employ this same approach in future developments of the [[New Rhetoric]] and in subsequent writings on law and justice.

== The New Rhetoric ==

=== Overview ===
Perelman and Olbrechts-Tyteca began research on the logic of non-formal arguments in 1948. Following [[Gottlob Frege|Frege]]’s comprehensive approach to the study of [[mathematics]], they collected a wide range of writing from academic, professional, religious, and popular realms to devise and apply their theory. After encountering Latini and "rediscovering" the Greco-Latin rhetorical tradition, both the project and its philosophical basis took a definitive shape. Perelman hypothesized that the rationale governing non-formal argument could be derived from the principles of rhetorical theory and from considerations of audience and values in particular. These considerations in turn affected the specific structure of arguments, including the bases of agreement and the availability of specific appeals. Perelman’s analysis also produced an overview of the various techniques apparent across the diverse group of arguments collected in the course of research.

The following discussion of the ''New rhetoric'' is organized according to the three sections of the book, and covers the major concepts contained in each.

=== The framework of argumentation ===
The ''New Rhetoric'' is founded on the idea that "since argumentation aims at securing the adherence of those to whom it is addressed, it is, in its entirety, relative to the audience to be influenced" (1969, p.&amp;nbsp;19). Perelman and Olbrechts-Tyteca rely in particular for their theory of argumentation on the twin concepts of universal and particular audiences: while every argument is directed to a specific individual or group, the orator decides what information and what approaches will achieve the greatest adherence according to an ideal audience. This ideal, Perelman explains, can be embodied, for example, "in God, in all reasonable and competent men, in the man deliberating or in an elite" (2001, p.&amp;nbsp;1393). Like particular audiences, then, the universal audience is never fixed or absolute but depends on the orator, the content and goals of the argument, and the particular audience to whom the argument is addressed. These considerations determine what information constitutes "facts" and "reasonableness" and thus help to determine the universal audience that, in turn, shapes the orator's approach.

The adherence of an audience is also determined by the orator's use of values, a further key concept of the ''New Rhetoric''. Perelman's treatment of value and his view of epideictic rhetoric sets his approach apart from that of the ancients and of Aristotle in particular. Aristotle's division of rhetoric into three genres – forensic, deliberative, and epideictic – is largely motivated by the judgments required for each: forensic or legal arguments require verdicts on past action, deliberative or political rhetoric seeks judgment on future action, and epideictic or ceremonial rhetoric concerns values associated with praise or blame and seeks no specific decisions. For Aristotle, the epideictic genre was of limited importance in the civic realm since it did not concern facts or policies. Perelman, in contrast, believes not only that epideictic rhetoric warrants more attention, but that the values normally limited to that genre are in fact central to all argumentation. "Epideictic oratory, " Perelman argues, "has significance and importance for argumentation because it strengthens the disposition toward action by increasing adherence to the values it lauds" (1969, p.&amp;nbsp;50). These values, moreover, are central to the persuasiveness of arguments in all rhetorical genres since the orator always attempts to "establish a sense of communion centered around particular values recognized by the audience" (1969, p.&amp;nbsp;51).

=== The starting points of argumentation ===
All argumentation, according to Perelman and Olbrechts-Tyteca, must proceed from a point of agreement; contentious matters in particular cannot be introduced until sufficient agreement on prior or related issues has already been established. The bases of agreement are divided into two categories: the first deals with facts, truths, and presumptions; the second with values, hierarchies, and ''loci of the preferable''.

Both facts and truths are normally established prior to argument; these are aspects of reality that would be agreed to, for instance, by the universal audience as conceived by the orator. Neither facts nor truths provide opportunity for dispute; as Perelman explains, "if we presuppose the coherence of reality and of our truths taken as a whole, there cannot be any conflict between facts and truths on which we would be called to make a decision" (2001, p.&amp;nbsp;1394). Presumptions, like facts and truths, need not be defended. Should the argument require opposing presumptions, however, the orator may overturn previous opinion by proving an opposite case.

Values, both concrete and abstract, may also constitute starting points, although none should be treated as universal. Establishing and reinforcing common values is necessary, according to Perelman, because they influence action and determine acceptable behaviour (2001, p.&amp;nbsp;1394). Values, moreover, are normally arranged in hierarchies that can also serve as starting points for argument. An audience will value both justice and utility, for example, but an argument may require a determination of preference between the two. Like values, hierarchies can be abstract or concrete; they may also be homogeneous, in the case of degrees, or heterogeneous, in the example of honesty and truthfulness. Both values and hierarchies can be justified by the final point of agreement, which Perelman and Olbrechts-Tyteca term ''loci of the preferable''. These ''loci'' or commonplaces are derived from the third book of Aristotle's ''Topics'' and allow agreement according to the determination of which, between two ''loci'', is more preferred. Thus, an argument may begin from the determination that an intrinsic quality, such as health, is preferred over a contingent quality, such as beauty.

The final aspect of argument starting points discussed in the ''New rhetoric'' is the creation of "presence. " From the body of ideas that are agreed upon by a given audience, the orator may choose to emphasize or lend presence to certain elements while deemphasizing others. As Perelman explains, "things present, things near to us in space and time, act directly on our sensibility, " yet if things distant – from the past or future – are more relevant to the argument, they may be lent presence through specific rhetorical figures, such as ''hypotyposis'' or ''anaphora'' (2001, p.&amp;nbsp;1395). All points of agreement, moreover, may be distinguished as primary or secondary according to the purpose of the argument and the composition of the particular audience. This is accomplished, Perelman notes, by linguistic categories that allow the orator to mount arguments "under the guise of a descriptive narrative" (ibid).

=== Argument techniques ===
Because non-formal argument is concerned with the adherence of an audience – rather than the mere demonstration of propositions proper to [[formal logic]] – the orator must ensure that the audience adheres to each successive element of an argument. Perelman outlines two ways the orator may achieve this acceptance or adherence: the first involves associations according to quasi-logical arguments, appeals to reality, and arguments that establish the real; the second approach responds to incompatible opinions through the dissociation of concepts.

Quasi-logical arguments, Perelman explains, are "similar to the formal structures of logic and mathematics" (2001, p.&amp;nbsp;1396). Definition is a common quasi-logical approach that is used not only for establishing the meaning of a term but also for emphasizing certain features of an object for persuasive purposes. Other quasi-logical arguments include relations of division, arguments of reciprocity, and arguments of probability. While these techniques appear to share the qualities of formal demonstrations, Perelman notes that for all quasi-logical approaches, "complementary, nonformal hypotheses are necessary to render the argument compelling" (2001, p.&amp;nbsp;1398).

The remaining associative techniques involve appealing to reality and establishing the real. Arguments of the former category can be further divided into those conveying succession and those dealing with coexistence. Relations of succession include causes and effects, such as the consequences of a particular action, or means and ends, such as the projected outcome of an event or process. Relations of coexistence, on the other hand, associate a person or essence to a specific act, and include arguments from authority. Like appeals to the real, arguments that establish the structure of reality can be divided into two categories: arguments from example or model, and arguments by analogy. The former rely on generalizations derived from a single situation, in the case of example, or on the conformation of a single situation to an accepted practice or [[ethos]], in the case of models. Appeals to the real that rely on analogy are common and, according to Perelman, are "typical to [[Plato]], [[Plotinus]], and all those who establish hierarchies within reality" (2001, p.&amp;nbsp;1399). These appeals establish the relation between two terms by noting their similarity to another, more familiar set of terms; for example, "truth is to [[Socrates]] what gold is to a miser. " [[Metaphor]], another common aspect of argumentation, is a form of condensed analogy.

When orators seek to reconcile incompatible opinions, they may gain adherence by a dissociation of concepts. The final technique discussed by Perelman and Olbrechts-Tyteca is a common approach in metaphysics that opposes appearances to reality. As Perelman explains, reality is normally perceived "through appearances that are taken as signs referring to it. When, however, appearances are incompatible – an oar in water looks broken but feels straight to the touch – we must admit...that some appearances are illusory and may lead us to error regarding the real" (2001, p.&amp;nbsp;1400). This recognition in turn fosters a conception of reality by which appearances may be judged; those aspects conforming to the real are considered valuable, while those not consistent with reality are dismissed as illusive. The dissociation of ideas can be extended to any realm where the tenets of an argument are incompatible with accepted opinion; "real [[democracy]], " for instance, can be opposed to "apparent democracy, or formal or nominal democracy, or quasi-democracy" (ibid. ). In the process of this opposition, adherence to "real democracy" is achieved not on the basis of its merit as an idea, but rather through the devaluation of opposing terms.

== Responses to Perelman and the New Rhetoric ==
The most common criticisms of the ''New Rhetoric'' focus on Perelman's concept of a universal audience.  Prominent criticisms by [[Jürgen Habermas]], [[Henry Johnstone Jr.]], and John Ray challenge the practicality and applicability of Perelman’s concept.  In response, Perelman and Crosswhite both offer support for the concept of the universal audience.  The work has been translated, in whole or in part, into nine languages and has been described variously as "groundbreaking," by J. Robert Cox, a "bombshell," by [[Michael Leff]], and as "one of the most influential modern formulations of rhetorical theory," by [[Brian Vickers (academic)|Brian Vickers]]. The ''New Rhetoric'' and its later developments have been foundational for [[argumentation theory]] in the last thirty years, and Perelman's work has influenced studies ranging from justice and reason to [[social psychology]] and [[political geography]].

Crosswhite discusses [[Jürgen Habermas]]’s [[theory of truth]] in relation to the concept of a universal [[audience]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1989"&gt;James Crosswhite, "Universality in Rhetoric: Perelman’s Universal Audience," Philosophy &amp; Rhetoric, 22 .3 (1989): 160, Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, when he tries to distinguish between rational consensus and [[de facto]] consensus (or truth from agreement), there is limited relevance to the "ideal speech situation."&lt;ref name="autogenerated1989"/&gt;  Because the universal audience requires there to be equality for all speakers, ideas, and audience members, it is not a realistic representation of a situation that would ever occur and thus the idea of a universal audience is not practical.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1989"/&gt;

Perelman’s theory of a universal audience includes reasonable people of all time, thus removing the argument or speech out of the context of history.  Perelman’s theory requires the speaker to understand universal values and ideals throughout history.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1987"&gt;Henry W. Johnstone, Philosophy &amp; Rhetoric, 20.2 (1987): 130, Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Henry Johnstone Jr.]], argues the philosophical and cultural changes over time are sometimes so great, that arguments cannot be universally effective and understood.&lt;ref&gt;Henry W. Johnstone, Philosophy &amp; Rhetoric, 20.2 (1987): 131, Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  Simply due to the differences in circumstance, it is impossible for a universal audience to exist.  People of a certain time and place, the particular [[audience]], are the limits of persuasive capacities.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1987"/&gt;

John Ray critiques the concept of a universal audience as irrelevant because it lacks structure and content.  Ray claims a universal audience is disorganized because it is different for each speaker based on his or her purpose.&lt;ref&gt;James Crosswhite, "Universality in Rhetoric: Perelman’s Universal Audience," Philosophy &amp; Rhetoric, 22 .3 (1989): 161, Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  While the construction of a universal audience does require setting aside "all the particular, local features of the audience and consider only those features of the audience one considers universal," the concept of a universal audience will vary based on the motives, goals, and experiences of the speaker.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;James Crosswhite, "Universality in Rhetoric: Perelman’s Universal Audience," Philosophy &amp; Rhetoric, 22 .3 (1989): 163, Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  When abiding by the universal audience, it is difficult to construct a [[persuasive]] argument, as the speaker must use general and vague language to be cognizant of all the audience-members values and ideals.  Ray is concerned that when forced to follow such constraints, the speaker will not only fail to be persuasive, but will also fail to remain valid in specific situations.
	
James Crosswhite addresses concerns about the validity of universal claims in formal [[argument]].&lt;ref&gt;James Crosswhite, "Universality in Rhetoric: Perelman’s Universal Audience," Philosophy &amp; Rhetoric, 22 .3 (1989): 157, Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  One way to construct this universal audience is to discover its universal character.  The speaker must set aside any conflicting ideas or values, but because this process of creating a universal audience is specific to the circumstances, it can yield different and conflicting ideals as universal.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt;  Perelman makes the distinction that when creating a universal audience you should only eliminate conflicting concepts and values that are relevant.  Additionally, because the idea of a universal audience itself is [[empirical]], the speaker forms the imagined universal audience based on past experiences and pre-existing notions of how the universal audience should be defined.&lt;ref&gt;Chaïm Perelman, The New Rhetoric: A Treatise on Argumentation, (Indiana: University of Notre Dame Press, 1969), 31. Translated by John Wilkinson and Purcell Weaver.&lt;/ref&gt;
	
While the concept of the universal audience has been criticized for trying to create complete agreement, Perelman claims its main purpose is to steer the speakers towards [[reasonableness]].&lt;ref&gt;Chaïm Perelman, and Henry W. Johnstone Jr., Philosophy &amp; Rhetoric,  1.1 (Jan.,1968): 21, Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  And in regards to validity of arguments formed around the universal audience, the creation of a universal audience is a tool and constraint for the speaker.&lt;ref&gt;Chaïm Perelman, and Henry W. Johnstone Jr., Philosophy &amp; Rhetoric,  1.1 (Jan.,1968): 20, Print.&lt;/ref&gt; It is meant to be a [[moral standard]] when addressing any audience, but will still allow for persuasion and specificity.

==Areas of research==
Schneider's research is qualitative and focuses on how developments in media and technology contribute to changes in social interaction and social control.&lt;ref name="qma"/&gt;&lt;ref name="social media"&gt;Schneider, C.J. (2016). ''[https://rowman.com/ISBN/9781498533720/Policing-and-Social-Media-Social-Control-in-an-Era-of-New-Media# Policing and Social Media: Social Control in an Era of New Media]." Lanham, MD: Lexington Books | Rowman &amp; Littlefield&lt;/ref&gt; 
His book ''Policing and Social Media: Social Control in an Era of New Media'' illustrates the process by which new information technology—namely, social media—and related changes in communication formats have affected the public face of policing and police work in Canada.&lt;ref name="social media"/&gt; ''Policing and Social Media'' has been well-received by an array of critics that include academics,&lt;ref name="journal review"&gt;Wiest, J.

The '''Cod Wars''' ({{lang-is|Þorskastríðin}}, "the cod wars", or ''Landhelgisstríðin'', "the wars for the territorial waters"&lt;ref&gt;The [[Icelandic Coast Guard]]'s name in Icelandic directly translates to "Territorial waters Guard".&lt;/ref&gt;) were a series of confrontations between the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Iceland]] on [[Exclusive economic zone|fishing rights]] in the [[North Atlantic]]. Each of the disputes ended with an Icelandic victory.&lt;ref name="Habeeb1988"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Power and Tactics in International Negotiations: How Weak Nations Bargain with Strong Nations|last = Habeeb|first = William|publisher = Johns Hopkins University Press|year = 1988|chapter=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Guðmundsson2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Steinsson2016" /&gt; The Third Cod War concluded in 1976, with a highly favourable agreement for Iceland; the United Kingdom conceded to a {{convert|200|nmi|km|adj=on|abbr=off}} Icelandic exclusive fishery zone after threats that Iceland would withdraw from [[NATO]], which would have forfeited NATO's access to most of the [[GIUK gap]], a critical [[anti-submarine warfare]] {{Linktext|chokepoint}} during the [[Cold War]].

As a result, British fishing communities lost access to rich areas and were devastated, with thousands of jobs lost.&lt;ref name="Guðmundsson2006" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ledger|first=John|title=''How the Cod War of 40 years ago left a Yorkshire community devastated''|url=http://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/our-region/east-yorkshire/how-the-cod-war-of-40-years-ago-left-a-yorkshire-community-devastated-1-7636401|date=21 December 2015|work=Yorkshire Post|accessdate=13 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1982, a {{convert|200|nmi|km|adj=on|abbr=off}} [[exclusive economic zone]] has been the [[United Nations]] standard.

The term "cod war" was coined by a British journalist in early September 1958.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = British Trawlers and Iceland 1919–1976|last = Thór|first = Jón Th.|publisher = University of Gothenburg|year = 1995|pages = 182}}&lt;/ref&gt; None of the Cod Wars met any of the common thresholds for a conventional [[war]], and they may more accurately be described as [[militarised interstate dispute]]s.&lt;ref name="Steinsson2016" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Fishing in the mild West: democratic peace and militarised interstate disputes in the transatlantic community|url = http://journals.cambridge.org/article_S0260210508008139|journal = Review of International Studies|date = 2008-07-01|issn = 1469-9044|pages = 481–506|volume = 34|issue = 3|doi = 10.1017/S0260210508008139|first = Gunther|last = Hellmann|first2 = Benjamin|last2 = Herborth}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Time to Fight: Government Type and Conflict Initiation in Parliamentary Systems|jstor = 3176313|journal = The Journal of Conflict Resolution|date = 2001-10-01|pages = 547–568|volume = 45|issue = 5|first = Michael J.|last = Ireland|first2 = Scott Sigmund|last2 = Gartner}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Institutional Constraints, Political Opposition, And Interstate Dispute Escalation: Evidence from Parliamentary Systems, 1946–89|url = http://jpr.sagepub.com/content/36/3/271|journal = Journal of Peace Research|date = 1999-05-01|issn = 0022-3433|pages = 271–287|volume = 36|issue = 3|doi = 10.1177/0022343399036003002|first = Brandon C.|last = Prins|first2 = Christopher|last2 = Sprecher}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is only one confirmed death during the Cod Wars: an Icelandic engineer, who was accidentally killed in the Second Cod War.

Fishermen from Britain began to fish in the international waters near Iceland in the 15th century. From the early 16th century onward, English sailors and fishermen were a major presence in the waters off Iceland.&lt;ref name="Þorsteinsson1976" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = British trawlers and Iceland: 1919–1976|last = Thór|first = Jón Th.|year = 1995|pages = 9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Icelandic historians view the history of Iceland's struggle for control of its maritime resources in ten episodes, or ten cod wars. The first episode was a dispute between [[Norway]] and England in 1415 to 1425 over England's trading with Iceland in violation of Norway's monopoly on the Icelandic trade. The dispute ended when the English arrested [[Eric of Pomerania]]'s officials in Iceland, effectively restoring the Anglo-Icelandic trade. The agreement that was reached in 1976 concluded what in modern times is called the Third Cod War (the final and tenth Cod War in long-term history).&lt;ref name="Þorsteinsson1976"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Tíu þorskastríð 1415–1976|last = Þorsteinsson|first = Björn|year = 1976}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the increases in range of fishing that were enabled by [[steam engine|steam power]] in the late 19th century, boat owners and skippers felt pressure to exploit new grounds. Their large catches in Icelandic waters attracted more regular voyages across the [[North Atlantic]]. In 1893, the [[Danish government]], which then governed Iceland and the [[Faroe Islands]], claimed a fishing limit of {{convert|50|nmi|km|abbr=on}} around their shores. British trawler owners disputed the claim and continued to send their ships to the waters near Iceland. The British government did not recognise the Danish claim on the grounds that setting such a precedent would lead to similar claims by the nations around the [[North Sea]], which would damage the British fishing industry.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

In 1896, the United Kingdom made an agreement with Denmark for British vessels to use any Icelandic port for shelter if they stowed their gear and trawl nets. In return, British vessels were not to fish in [[Faxa Bay]] east of a line from Ílunýpa, a promontory near [[Keflavík]] to Þormóðssker ([https://tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?params=64.4334_N_-22.3092_E_ 43.43° N, 22.30° W]).{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

With many British trawlers being charged and fined by Danish gunboats for fishing illegally within the {{convert|13|nmi|km|abbr=on|0}} limit, which the British government refused to recognise, the [[British press]] began to enquire why the Danish action against British interests was allowed to continue without intervention by the [[Royal Navy]]. The British made a show of naval force ([[gunboat diplomacy]]) in 1896 and 1897.&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt;

In April 1899, the steam trawler ''Caspian'' was fishing off the Faroe Islands when a Danish [[gunboat]] tried to arrest her for allegedly fishing illegally inside the limits. The trawler refused to stop and was fired upon first with blank shells and then with live ammunition. Eventually, the trawler was caught, but before the skipper, Charles Henry Johnson, left his ship to go aboard the Danish gunboat, he ordered the mate to make a dash for it after he went on to the Danish ship. The ''Caspian'' set off at full speed. The gunboat fired several shots at the unarmed boat but could not catch up with the trawler, which returned, heavily damaged, to [[Grimsby]], [[England]]. On board the Danish gunboat, the skipper of the ''Caspian'' was lashed to the mast. A court held at [[Thorshavn]] convicted him on several counts including illegal fishing and attempted assault, and he was jailed for 30 days.&lt;ref&gt;Bale, B. (2010), ''Memories of the: Lincolnshire Fishing Industry'' Berkshire: Countryside Books pg. 35&lt;/ref&gt;

The Anglo-Danish Territorial Waters Agreement of 1901, which set {{convert|3|nmi|km|0|abbr=on}} territorial limits, measured narrowly, for Iceland for 50 years.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = How 'cod war' came: the origins of the Anglo-Icelandic fisheries dispute, 1958–61*|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-2281.2004.00222.x/abstract|journal = Historical Research|date = 2004-11-01|issn = 1468-2281|pages = 543–574|volume = 77|issue = 198|doi = 10.1111/j.1468-2281.2004.00222.x|first = Gudni Thorlacius|last = Jóhannesson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Icelandic fisheries grew in importance for the British fishing industry around the end of the 19th century.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; The reduction in fishing activity brought about by the hostilities of the [[First World War]] effectively ended the dispute for a time.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

While data is incomplete for the prewar period, one historian argues that the Icelandic fishing grounds were 'very important' to the British fishing industry as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = British trawlers and Iceland: 1919–1976|last = Thór|first = Jón Th.|publisher = |year = 1995|isbn = |location = |pages = 48–50}}&lt;/ref&gt; Data from 1919 to 1938 showed a significant increase in the British total catches in Icelandic waters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = British trawlers and Iceland: 1919–1976|last = Thór|first = Jón Th.|publisher = |year = 1995|isbn = |location = |pages = 68, 79}}&lt;/ref&gt; The British catches in Iceland were more than twice the combined catches of all other grounds of the British distant water fleet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = British trawlers and Iceland: 1919–1976|last = Thór|first = Jón Th.|publisher = |year = 1995|isbn = |location = |pages = 87}}&lt;/ref&gt; Icelanders grew increasingly dismayed at the British presence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = British trawlers and Iceland: 1919–1976|last = Thór|first = Jón Th.|publisher = |year = 1995|isbn = |location = |pages = 91–107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1949–1958 ===
In October 1949, Iceland initiated the two-year abrogation process of the agreement made between Denmark and the United Kingdom in 1901. The fishery limits to the north of Iceland were extended to {{convert|4|nmi|km|0|abbr=on}}. However, since the British trawling fleet did not use those ground, the northern extension was not a source of significant contention between the two states. Initially planning to extend the rest of its fishery limits by the end of the two-year abrogation period, Iceland chose to postpone its extension to wait for the outcome of the [[fisheries case|UK-Norway fisheries case]] in the [[International Court of Justice]] (ICJ), which was decided in December 1951.

Icelanders were satisfied with the ICJ ruling, as they believed that Iceland's preferred extensions were similar to those afforded to Norway in the ICJ ruling. The UK and Iceland tried to negotiate a solution but were unable to reach agreement. The Icelandic government declared, on 19 March 1952, its intention to extend its fishery limits on 15 May 1952.&lt;ref name="Jóhannnesson2007" /&gt;

Iceland and the United Kingdom were involved in a dispute from May 1952 to November 1956 over Iceland's unilateral extension of its fishery limits from {{convert|3|to|4|nmi|km|0|abbr=on}}. Unlike in the Cod Wars, the Royal Navy was never sent into Icelandic waters. The British trawling industry, however, implemented costly sanctions on Iceland by imposing a landing ban on Icelandic fish in British ports.&lt;ref name="Jóhannnesson2007"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Troubled Waters|last = Jóhannnesson|first = Guðni Th.|publisher = NAFHA|year = 2007|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Guðmundsson2006"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The Cod and the Cold War|last = Guðmundsson|first = Guðmundur J.|date = 2006|journal = Scandinavian Journal of History|doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The landing ban was a major blow to the Icelandic fishing industry (the UK was Iceland's largest export market for fish) and caused consternation among Icelandic statesmen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Troubled Waters|last = Jóhannesson|first = Guðni Th.|publisher = |year = 2007|isbn = |location = |pages = 104}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Utanríkisþjónusta Íslands og utanríkismál: Sögulegt Yfirlit 1.|last = Thorsteinsson|first = Pétur|publisher = |year = 1992|isbn = |location = |pages = 440}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two sides decided to refer one part of the Icelandic extension to the ICJ in early 1953: the controversial Faxa Bay delimitation.&lt;ref name="Jóhannnesson2007" /&gt;

[[Cold War]] politics proved favourable for Iceland, as the [[Soviet Union]], seeking influence in Iceland, stepped in to purchase Icelandic fish. The [[United States]], fearing greater Soviet influence in Iceland, also did so and persuaded [[Spain]] and [[Italy]] to do likewise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Í eldlínu kalda stríðsins|last = Ingimundarson|first = Valur|year = 1996|page = 288}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Soviet and American involvement resulted in weakening the punitive effects of the British landing ban. Some scholars refer to the dispute of 1952 to 1956 as one of the Cod Wars, as the object of the dispute and its costs and risks were all similar to those in the other three Cod Wars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Þorskastríð og fjöldi þeirra|last = Þorsteinsson|first = Björn|date = 1983|journal = Saga|doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Tíunda þorskastríðið 1975–1976|last = Jónsson|first = Björn|date = 1981|journal = Saga|doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = "Why Did the Cod Wars Occur and Why Did Iceland Win Them?

Just as the other Cod Wars, the dispute ended with Iceland achieving its aims, as the Icelandic {{convert|4|nmi|km|0|abbr=on}} fishery limits were recognized by the United Kingdom, following a decision by the Organisation of European Economic Co-operation in 1956.&lt;ref name="Jóhannnesson2007" /&gt;

Two years later, in 1958, the [[United Nations]] convened the first [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea#UNCLOS I|International Conference on the Law of the Sea]], which was attended by 86 states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, 1958|url=http://legal.un.org/diplomaticconferences/lawofthesea-1958/lawofthesea-1958.html|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=4 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several countries sought to extend the limits of their territorial waters to {{convert|12|nmi|km|0|abbr=on}}, but the conference did not reach any firm conclusions.&lt;ref name="NationalArchives"&gt;{{cite web|title = The Cod Wars|url = http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/cabinetpapers/themes/cod-wars.htm|publisher = The National Archives|accessdate = 4 November 2015|postscript=none}}; {{cite web|title=Icy fishing: UK and Iceland fish stock disputes|url=http://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/SN06511/SN06511.pdf|publisher=House of Commons Library|accessdate=27 February 2016|date=19 December 2012|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UN1998"&gt;{{cite web|title=The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (A historical perspective)|url=https://www.un.org/Depts/los/convention_agreements/convention_historical_perspective.htm|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=4 November 2015|date=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The First Cod War lasted from 1 September 1958 to 11 March 1961.&lt;ref name="Þorskastríðin2006"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Þorskastríðin þrjú|last = Jóhannesson|first = Guðni Th.|publisher = Hafréttarstofnun Íslands|year = 2006|isbn = |location = |pages = 61–62}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; It began as soon as a new [[Icelandic law]] came into force and expanded the Icelandic fishery zone from {{convert|4|to|12|nmi|km}} at midnight on 1 September 1958.

All members of NATO opposed the unilateral Icelandic extension.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Í eldlínu kalda stríðsins|last = Ingimundarson|first = Valur|publisher = |year = 1996|isbn = |location = |pages = 377}}&lt;/ref&gt; The British declared that their trawlers would fish under protection from their [[warship]]s in three areas: out of the [[Westfjords]], north of Horn and southeast of Iceland. In all, twenty British trawlers, four warships and a supply vessel were inside the newly declared zones. The deployment was expensive; in February 1960, [[Peter Carington, 6th Baron Carrington|Lord Carrington]], the [[First Lord of the Admiralty]], responsible for the [[Royal Navy]], stated that the ships near Iceland had expended half a million pounds sterling worth of oil since the new year and that a total of 53 British warships had taken part in the operations.&lt;ref&gt;Sveinn Sæmundsson, ''Guðmundur skipherra Kjærnested'', Örn og Örlygur. [[Reykjavík]]. 1984. p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt; Against that, Iceland could deploy seven patrol vessels&lt;ref&gt;Jón Björnsson, ''Íslensk skip''. vol. III. Reykjavik. 1990 p. 8-142 {{ISBN|9979-1-0375-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a single [[PBY Catalina|PBY-6A Catalina]] [[flying boat]].&lt;ref&gt;''Svipmyndir úr 70 ára sögu''. Landhelgisgæsla Íslands. Reykjavík. 1996. pp. 30–31, 37–38. {{ISBN|9979-60-277-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The deployment of the Royal Navy to contested waters led to protests in Iceland. Demonstrations against the British embassy were met with taunts by the British ambassador, Andrew Gilchrist, as he played bagpipe music and military marches on his [[Phonograph|gramophone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = How 'cod war' came: the origins of the Anglo-Icelandic fisheries dispute, 1958–61*|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-2281.2004.00222.x/abstract|journal = Historical Research|date = 2004-11-01|issn = 1468-2281|pages = 567–568|volume = 77|issue = 198|doi = 10.1111/j.1468-2281.2004.00222.x|first = Gudni Thorlacius|last = Jóhannesson}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many incidents followed. The Icelanders were, however, at a disadvantage in patrolling the contested waters because of the size of the area and the limited number of patrol ships. According to one historian, 'only the flagship Thór could effectively arrest and, if necessary, tow a trawler to harbour'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = How 'cod war' came: the origins of the Anglo-Icelandic fisheries dispute, 1958–61*|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-2281.2004.00222.x/abstract|journal = Historical Research|date = 2004-11-01|issn = 1468-2281|pages = 559|volume = 77|issue = 198|doi = 10.1111/j.1468-2281.2004.00222.x|first = Gudni Thorlacius|last = Jóhannesson}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jóhannesson|first1=Guðni Th.|title=Did He Matter?

On 4 September [[ICGV Ægir|ICGV ''Ægir'']], an Icelandic patrol vessel, attempted to take a British trawler off the Westfjords but was thwarted when [[HMS Russell (F97)|HMS ''Russell'']] intervened, and the two vessels collided. On 6 October, V/s ''María Júlía'' fired three shots at the trawler ''Kingston Emerald'', forcing the trawler to escape to sea. On 12 November, V/s ''Þór'' encountered the trawler ''Hackness'', which had not stowed its nets legally. ''Hackness'' did not stop until ''Þór'' had fired two blanks and one live shell off its bow. Once again, HMS ''Russell'' came to the rescue, and its [[captain (nautical)|shipmaster]] ordered the Icelandic [[captain (naval)|captain]] to leave the trawler alone, as it was not within the {{convert|4|nmi|km|abbr=on}} limit recognised by the British government. The captain of ''Þór''', Eiríkur Kristófersson, said that he would not do so and ordered his men to approach the trawler with the gun manned. In response, the ''Russell'' threatened to sink the Icelandic boat if it fired a shot at the ''Hackness''. More British ships then arrived, and the ''Hackness'' retreated.

Icelandic officials threatened to withdraw Iceland's membership of NATO and to expel US forces from Iceland unless a satisfactory conclusion could be reached to the dispute.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Í eldlínu kalda stríðsins|last = Ingimundarson|first = Valur|publisher = |year = 1996|isbn = |location = |pages = 33–34}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even the cabinet members who were pro-Western (proponents of NATO and the US Defence Agreement) were forced to resort to the threats, as that was Iceland's chief leverage, and it would have been [[political suicide]] not to use it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Uppgjör við umheiminn|last = Ingimundarson|first = Valur|publisher = |year = 2002|isbn = |location = |pages = 33, 36}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, NATO engaged in formal and informal mediations to bring an end to the dispute.&lt;ref name="Bakaki 63–78"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bakaki|first=Zorzeta|date=2016-01-01|title=Deconstructing Mediation: A Case Study of the Cod Wars|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/nejo.12147/abstract|journal=Negotiation Journal|language=en|volume=32|issue=1|pages=63–78|doi=10.1111/nejo.12147|issn=1571-9979}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The deal was very similar to one that Iceland had offered in the weeks and days leading up to its unilateral extension in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = How 'cod war' came: the origins of the Anglo-Icelandic fisheries dispute, 1958–61*|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-2281.2004.00222.x/abstract|journal = Historical Research|date = 2004-11-01|issn = 1468-2281|pages = 557, 562|volume = 77|issue = 198|doi = 10.1111/j.1468-2281.2004.00222.x|first = Gudni Thorlacius|last = Jóhannesson}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the agreement, it was stipulated that any future disagreement between Iceland and Britain in the matter of fishery zones would be sent to the [[International Court of Justice]], in [[the Hague]].

[[File:Klippuemployment.png|thumb|200px|left|The primary objective of the Icelandic Coast Guard during the last two Cod Wars was to cut nets in this manner.]]

The Second Cod War between the United Kingdom and Iceland lasted from September 1972 until the signing of a temporary agreement, in November 1973.

The Icelandic government again extended its fishing limits, now to {{convert|50|nmi|km|0|abbr=on}}. It had two goals in extending the limits: (1) to conserve fish stocks and (2) to increase its share of total catches.&lt;ref name="Hart1976"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Anglo-Icelandic Cod War of 1972–1973|last = Hart|first = Jeffrey A.|publisher = University of California|year = 1976|isbn = |location = Berkeley|pages = 19, 24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reasons that Iceland pursued 50 nmi fishery limits, rather than the 200 nmi limits that they had also considered, were that the most fruitful fishing grounds were within the 50 nmi and that patrolling a 200 nmi limit would have been more difficult.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://timarit.is/view_page_init.jsp?pageId=5364327|title = Þorskar í köldu stríði|last = Guðmundsson|first = Guðmundur J.|date = 2000|journal = Ný saga|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |pages = 67–68}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The British contested the Icelandic extension with two goals in mind: (1) to achieve the greatest possible catch quota for British fishermen in the contested waters and (2) to prevent a ''de facto'' recognition of a unilateral extension of a fishery jurisdiction, which would set a precedent for other extensions.&lt;ref name="Hart1976" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Icelandic Fisheries|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1973/mar/22/icelandic-fisheries|website=Commons and Lords Hansard, the Official Report of debates in Parliament|publisher=UK Parliament|accessdate=28 February 2016|date=22 March 1973}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All Western European states and the [[Warsaw Pact]] opposed Iceland's unilateral extension.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Uppgjör við umheiminn|last = Inimundarson|first = Valur|publisher = |year = 2002|isbn = |location = |pages = 146, 162–163}}&lt;/ref&gt; African states declared support for Iceland's extension after a meeting in 1971 where the Icelandic prime minister argued that the Icelandic cause was a part of a broader battle against colonialism and imperialism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Uppgjör við umheiminn|last = Ingimundarson|first = Valur|publisher = |year = 2002|isbn = |location = |pages = 147}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 September 1972, the enforcement of the law that expanded the Icelandic fishery limits to {{convert|50|nmi|km|abbr=on}} began. Numerous British and West German trawlers continued fishing within the new zone on the first day. The Icelandic leftist coalition then governing ignored the treaty that stipulated the involvement of the [[International Court of Justice]]. It said that it was not bound by agreements made by the previous centre-right government, with [[Lúdvik Jósepsson]], the fisheries minister, stating that 'the basis for our independence is economic independence'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEiMDdxtSeA&amp;feature=related/ |title=Interview by the BBC in 1973 |publisher=Youtube.com |date=5 December 2010 |accessdate=16 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, ICGV ''Ægir'' chased 16 trawlers, in waters east of the country, out of the 50&amp;nbsp;nmi zone. The [[Icelandic Coast Guard]] started to use [[net cutter (fisheries patrol)|net cutters]] to cut the trawling lines of non-Icelandic vessels fishing within the new exclusion zone.

On 5 September 1972, at 10:25,&lt;ref name="Sæmundsson"&gt;Sæmundsson, Sveinn (1984). ''Guðmundur skipherra Kjærnested''.  Örn og Örlygur&lt;/ref&gt; ICGV ''Ægir'', under [[Guðmundur Kjærnested]]'s command, encountered an unmarked trawler fishing northeast of [[Hornbanki]]. The master of the black-hulled trawler refused to divulge the trawler's name and number and, after being warned to follow the Coast Guard's orders, played ''[[Rule, Britannia!]]'' over the radio.&lt;ref name="Guðmundsson2006" /&gt; At 10:40, the net cutter was deployed into the water for the first time, and ''Ægir'' sailed along the trawler's port side. The fishermen tossed a thick nylon rope into the water as the [[OPV (naval)|patrol ship]] closed in, attempting to disable its propeller. After passing the trawler, ''Ægir'' veered to the trawler's starboard side. The net cutter, {{convert|160|fathom|m|lk=on}} behind the patrol vessel, sliced one of the trawling wires. As ICGV ''Ægir'' came about to circle the unidentified trawler, its angry crew threw coal as well as waste and a large fire axe at the Coast Guard vessel.&lt;ref name="Sæmundsson"/&gt; A considerable amount of swearing and shouting came through the radio, which resulted in the trawler being identified as [[Peter Scott (H103)|''Peter Scott'' (H103)]].&lt;ref name="Sæmundsson"/&gt;

On 25 November 1972, a crewman on the German trawler ''Erlangen'' suffered a head injury as an Icelandic patrolship cut the trawler's trawling wire, which struck the crewman.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Þorskastríðin þrjú|last = Jóhannesson|first = Guðni Th.|publisher = |year = 2006|isbn = |location = |pages = 82}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 January 1973, the nets of 18 trawlers were cut. That forced the British seamen to leave the Icelandic fishery zone unless they had the protection of the [[Royal Navy]]. The next day large, fast [[tugboat]]s were sent to their defence, the first being the ''Statesman''. The British considered that to be insufficient and formed a special group to defend the trawlers.

On 23 January 1973, the volcano [[Eldfell]] on [[Heimaey]] erupted, forcing the Coast Guard to divert its attention to rescuing the inhabitants of the small island.

On 17 May 1973, the British trawlers left the Icelandic waters, only to return two days later when they were escorted by British frigates.&lt;ref name="Guðmundsson2006"/&gt; The naval deployment was codenamed Operation Dewey.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=High Stakes: Britain's Air Arms in Action 1945-1990|last=Flintham|first=Vic|publisher=Pen and Sword|year=2008|isbn=1844158152|location=|pages=347}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hawker Siddeley Nimrod]] jets flew over the contested waters and notified British frigates and trawlers of the whereabouts of Icelandic patrolships.&lt;ref name="Jóhannesson 2006 90"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Þorskastríðin þrjú|last = Jóhannesson|first = Guðni Th.|year = 2006|pages = 90}}&lt;/ref&gt; Icelandic statesmen were infuriated by the entry of the Royal Navy and considered to appeal to the UN Security Council or call for Article 5 of the [[North Atlantic Treaty|NATO Charter]] to be implemented. According to the American ambassador at the time, [[Frederick Irving]], [[Ólafur Jóhannesson]] demanded for the US to send jets to bomb the British frigates.&lt;ref name="Jóhannesson 2006 90"/&gt; There were major protests in Reykjavík on 24 May 1973. All the windows of the British embassy in Reykjavík were broken.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Þorskastríðin þrjú|last = Jóhannesson|first = Guðni Th.|year = 2006|pages = 91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Icelandic lighthouse tender V/s ''Árvakur'' collided with four British vessels on 1 June, and six days later ICGV ''Ægir'' collided with [[HMS Scylla (F71)|HMS ''Scylla'']], when it was reconnoitring for icebergs off the Westfjords even though no trawlers were present.

On 29 August&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.napier-chronicles.co.uk/1973.htm |title=1973 |publisher=The Napier Chronicles |date= |accessdate=16 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Icelandic Coast Guard suffered the only fatality of the conflict, when ICGV ''Ægir'' collided with another British frigate. Halldór Hallfreðsson, an engineer on board the Icelandic vessel, died by electrocution from his welding equipment after sea water flooded the compartment in which he was making hull repairs.&lt;ref name=eng/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Anglo-Icelandic Cod War of 1972–1973|last = Hart|first = Jeffrey A.|publisher = |year = 1976|isbn = |location = |pages = 44}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://timarit.is/view_page_init.jsp?issId=264803&amp;lang=en|title = Timarit.is|last = Iceland|first = National and University Library of|website = timarit.is|language = en|access-date = 2016-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 September 1973, [[Joseph Luns]], Secretary-General of NATO, arrived in Reykjavík to talk with Icelandic ministers, who had been pressed to leave NATO, as it had been of no help to Iceland in the conflict.&lt;ref name="Bakaki 63–78"/&gt; Britain and Iceland were both NATO members. The Royal Navy made use of bases in Iceland during the Cold War to fulfill its primary NATO duty, guarding the [[GIUK gap|Greenland-Iceland-UK gap]].

After a series of talks within NATO, British warships were recalled on 3 October.&lt;ref name="Jóhannesson 2006 101"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Þorskastríðin þrjú|last = Jóhannesson|first = Guðni Th.|year = 2006|pages = 101}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trawlermen played ''[[Rule, Britannia!|Rule Britannia!]]'' over their radios, as they had done when the Royal Navy entered the waters. They also played ''[[The Party's Over (Willie Nelson song)|The Party's Over]]''.&lt;ref name="Jóhannesson 2006 101"/&gt; An agreement was signed on 8 November to limit British fishing activities to certain areas inside the 50&amp;nbsp;nmi limit. The agreement, resolving the dispute, was approved by the Althing on 13 November 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Þorskastríðin þrjú|last = Jóhannesson|first = Guðni Th.|year = 2006|pages = 102}}&lt;/ref&gt; The agreement was based on the premise that British trawlers would limit their annual catch to no more than 130,000 [[ton]]s. The Icelanders were reportedly prepared to settle for 156,000 tons in July 1972 but had increased their demands by spring of 1973 and coffered 117,000 tons (the British demanded 145,000 tons in spring 1973).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Þorskastríðin þrjú|last = Jóhannesson|first = Guðni Th.|year = 2006|pages = 88, 94, 101}}&lt;/ref&gt; The agreement expired in November 1975, and the third "Cod War" began.

The Second Cod War threatened Iceland's membership in NATO and the US military presence in Iceland. It was the closest that Iceland has come to canceling its bilateral Defence Agreement with the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = A western cold war: the crisis in Iceland's relations with Britain, the United States, and NATO, 1971–74|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09592290312331295694|journal = Diplomacy &amp; Statecraft|date = 2003-12-01|issn = 0959-2296|pages = 94–136|volume = 14|issue = 4|doi = 10.1080/09592290312331295694|first = Valur|last = Ingimundarson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Icelandic NATO membership and hosting of US military had considerable importance to Cold War strategy because of Iceland's location in the middle of the [[GIUK gap]].

After the entry of the Royal Navy into the contested waters, at any given time, four frigates and an assortment of tugboats would generally protect the British trawling fleet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Þorskastríðin þrjú|last = Jóhannesson|first = Guðni Th.|year = 2006| pages = 89}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the course of this Cod War, a total of 32 British frigates had entered the contested waters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Þorskastríðin þrjú|last = Jóhannesson|first = Guðni Th.|year = 2006|pages = 103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the third [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea#UNCLOS III|United Nations Conference of the Law on the Sea]] in 1975, several countries supported a {{convert|100|nmi|km|0|abbr=on}} limit to territorial waters.&lt;ref name=NationalArchives /&gt;&lt;ref name=UN1998 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, 1973–1982|url=http://legal.un.org/diplomaticconferences/lawofthesea-1982/lawofthesea-1982.html|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=4 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 July 1975, the Icelandic government announced its intention to extend its fishery limits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Þorskastríðin þrjú|last = Jóhannesson|first = Guðni Th.|year=2006|pages=112}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Third Cod War (November 1975 – June 1976) began after Iceland again extended its fishing limits, now to {{convert|200|nmi|km|0|abbr=on}} from its coast.

The conflict, which was the most hard-fought of the Cod Wars, saw British fishing trawlers have their nets cut by the [[Icelandic Coast Guard]], and there were several incidents of [[ramming]] by Icelandic ships and British trawlers, frigates and tugboats.

One of the most serious incidents occurred on 11 December 1975. As reported by Iceland, V/s ''Þór'', under the command of Helgi Hallvarðsson, was leaving port at [[Seyðisfjörður]], where it had been minesweeping, when orders were received to investigate the presence of unidentified foreign vessels at the mouth of the fjord. The vessels were identified as three British ships: ''Lloydsman'', an oceangoing tug three times bigger than V/s ''Þór''; ''Star Aquarius'', an oil rig supply vessel of British [[Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food]]; and her sister ship, ''Star Polaris''. They were sheltering from a [[Beaufort scale|force nine]] gale within Iceland's {{convert|12|nmi|km|adj=on}} territorial waters.&lt;ref&gt;Storey, Norman, ''What price cod? : a tugmaster's view of the cod wars.'' Beverley, North Humberside. Hutton Press. c 1992. {{ISBN|1-872167-44-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Icelandic account, when ordered to leave Icelandic territorial waters by the commander of ''Þór'', the three tugboats initially complied. However, around two nautical miles (4&amp;nbsp;km) from the coast, ''Star Aquarius'' allegedly veered to starboard and hit ''Þór''s port side as the Coast Guards attempted to overtake her. Even as ''Þór'' increased speed, ''Lloydsman'' again collided with its port side. ''Þór'' had suffered considerable damage by these hits and so when ''Star Aquarius'' came about, a blank round was fired from ''Þór''. That did not deter ''Star Aquarius'', as it hit ''Þór'' a second time. Another shot was fired from ''Þór'' as a result, this time a live round that hit the bow of ''Star Aquarius''. Then, the tugboats retreated. V/s ''Þór'', which was close to sinking after the confrontation, sailed to [[Loðmundarfjörður]] for temporary repairs.&lt;ref&gt;Atli Magnússon, ''Í kröppum sjó : Helgi Hallvarðsson skipherra segir frá sægörpum og svaðilförum''. Örn og Örlygur. [Reykjavík]. 1992. p. 204-206 {{ISBN|9979-55-035-X}} Ib. :&lt;/ref&gt;

The British reports of the incident differ considerably and maintain that ''Þór'' attempted to board one of the tugboats, and as ''Þór'' broke away, ''Lloydsman'' surged forward to protect ''Star Aquarius''. Captain Albert MacKenzie of ''Star Aquarius'' said that ''Þór'' approached from the stern and hit the support vessel before it veered off and fired a shot from a range of about {{convert|100|yd|m|-1}}. Niels Sigurdsson, the Icelandic Ambassador in London, said that ''Þór'' had been firing in self-defence after it had been rammed by British vessels. Iceland consulted the [[UN Security Council]] over the incident, which declined to intervene.&lt;ref&gt;Guðni Thorlacius Jóhannesson, ''Þorskastríðin þrjú : saga landhelgismálsins 1948–1976'', Hafréttarstofnun Íslands. Reykjavík. 2006. {{ISBN|9979-70-141-2}} (ib.)&lt;/ref&gt;

The immediate Royal Navy response was to dispatch a large frigate force, which was already well on the way to Icelandic waters, before the Prime Minister, Harold Wilson, or the Foreign Secretary, Anthony Crosland, were informed.&lt;ref&gt;S.Crosland. Tony Crosland. Cape. London (1982)&lt;/ref&gt; The Royal Navy saw the opportunity to demonstrate the capabilities of its older [[Type 12 frigate|Type 12]] and [[Tribal-class frigate|Type 81]] frigates for sustained deployment in the area of the [[Denmark Strait]], where they were expected to deter the passage of Soviet submarines while the Royal Navy was threatened by further serious defence and naval cuts by the Royal Navy's chief ''bête noire'', the Chancellor of Exchequer and former Minister of Defence, [[Denis Healey]].&lt;ref&gt;Admiral Sandy Woodward. One Hundred Days. Memoirs of a Falklands Battlegroup Commander. Naval Institute Press. RI&lt;/ref&gt; The Royal Navy saw its strategic aim at the time to be as much as fighting Healey as the Soviet Navy.&lt;ref&gt;S.Woodward.Memoirs of a Falklands Battlegroup Commander.(1992)RI&lt;/ref&gt; The Second and Third Cod Wars were necessary wars for the Royal Navy, like the Falklands Operation, six years later.&lt;ref&gt;Rear Admiral. Chris Parry. Down South. A Falklands War Diary. Penquin (2013). London.&lt;/ref&gt; To Crosland, also MP for the trawler port of Grimsby, the third war was a more serious threat to the Western Alliance than the Middle East was.&lt;ref&gt;K. Threakston. British Foreign Secretaries since 1974.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another incident occurred in January 1976, when [[HMS Andromeda (F57)|HMS ''Andromeda'']] collided with ''Þór'', which sustained a hole in its hull; the hull of ''Andromeda'' was dented. The British Ministry of Defence said that the collision represented a "deliberate attack" on the British warship 'without regard for life'. The Icelandic Coast Guard, on the other hand insisted, that ''Andromeda'' had rammed ''Þór'' by "overtaking the boat and then swiftly changing course'. After the incident and facing a growing number of ships enduring dockyard repairs, the Royal Navy ordered a 'more cautious approach' in dealing with 'the enemy cutting the trawlers' warps'.&lt;ref&gt;Ships Monthly – Volume 39 – Page 35 – Endlebury Publishing Company, 2004
&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 February 1976, the British Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food announced that a fisherman from Grimsby had become the first British casualty of the Third Cod War, when a [[hawser]] hit and seriously injured him after Icelandic vessels cut a trawl.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; While a British parliamentary source reported in a 1993 debate that a British trawlerman was accidentally killed by a solid shot fired by an Icelandic patrol boat,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Tuesday 30 March 1993|url = http://hansardarchiv.es/select-committees/tuesday-30-march-1993.html|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151117021627/http://hansardarchiv.es/select-committees/tuesday-30-march-1993.html|dead-url = yes|archive-date = 2015-11-17|website = hansardarchiv.es|accessdate = 2015-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; this suggestion has not been corroborated by any historical sources.

Britain deployed a total of 22 frigates and ordered the reactivation from reserve of the [[Leopard-class frigate|Type 41 frigate]] HMS ''Jaguar'' and [[Salisbury-class frigate|Type 61]] HMS ''Lincoln'', refitting them as specialist ramming craft with reinforced wooden bows. In addition to the frigates, the British also deployed a total of seven supply ships, nine tugboats and three support ships to protect its fishing trawlers, but only six to nine of the vessels were on deployment at any one time.&lt;ref name=Janes/&gt; The Royal Navy was prepared to accept serious damage to its Cold War frigate fleet, costing millions and disabling part of its North Atlantic capacity for more than a year. HMS ''Yarmouth'' had its bow torn off, HMS ''Diomede'' had a 40 ft gash ripped through its hull and HMS ''Eastbourne'' suffered such structural damage from ramming by Icelandic gunboats that it had to be reduced to a moored operational training frigate. Iceland deployed four patrol vessels (V/s ''Óðinn'', V/s ''Þór'', V/s ''Týr'', and V/s ''Ægir'') and two armed trawlers (V/s ''Baldur'' and V/s ''Ver'').&lt;ref name="Janes"&gt;''Jane's fighting ships : the standard reference of the world's navies.'' London, [1900–].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Atli Magnússon, ''Í kröppum sjó : Helgi Hallvarðsson skipherra segir frá sægörpum og svaðilförum''. Örn og Örlygur. [Reykjavík]. 1992. p. 201-202&lt;/ref&gt; The Icelandic government tried to acquire US [[Asheville class gunboat]]s and when it was denied by [[Henry Kissinger]], it tried to acquire Soviet [[Mirka class frigate]]s instead.

A more serious turn of events came when Iceland threatened closure of the NATO base at [[Keflavík]], which would have severely impaired NATO's ability to deny access to the Atlantic Ocean to the Soviet Union. As a result, the British government agreed to have its fishermen stay outside Iceland's {{convert|200|nmi|km|0|abbr=on}} exclusion zone without a specific agreement.

On the evening of 6 May 1976, after the outcome of the Third Cod War had already been decided, the [[V/s Týr|V/s ''Týr'']] was trying to cut the nets of the trawler ''Carlisle'' when Captain Gerald Plumer of [[HMS Falmouth (F113)|HMS ''Falmouth'']] ordered it rammed. ''Falmouth'' at the speed of more than 22 knots (41 km/h) rammed ''Týr'', almost capsizing her. ''Týr'' did not sink and managed to cut the nets of ''Carlisle'', and ''Falmouth'' rammed it again. ''Týr'' was heavily damaged and found herself propelled by only a single screw and pursued by the tug-boat ''Statesman''. In the dire situation, Captain [[Guðmundur Kjærnested]] gave orders to man the guns, in spite of the overwhelming superiority of firepower HMS ''Falmouth'' enjoyed, to deter any further ramming.&lt;ref&gt;Óttar Sveinsson, ''Útkall : Týr er að sökkva''. Útkall. [Reykjavík] 2004. {{ISBN|9979-9569-6-8}} (ib.)&lt;/ref&gt; The Third Cod War saw 55 ramming incidents altogether.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Cod Wars {{!}} Britishseafishing.co.uk|url = http://britishseafishing.co.uk/the-cod-wars/|website = britishseafishing.co.uk|accessdate = 2015-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In NATO-mediated sessions,&lt;ref name="Bakaki 63–78"/&gt; an agreement was reached between Iceland and the UK on 1 June 1976. The British were allowed to keep 24 trawlers within the 200&amp;nbsp;nmi and fish a total of 30,000 tons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title = Þorskastríðin þrjú| last = Jóhannesson| first = Guðni Th.| year = 2006| pages = 145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Iceland came closest to withdrawing from NATO and expelling US forces in the Second Cod War, Iceland actually took the most serious action in all of the Cod Wars in the Third Cod War by ending diplomatic relations with the United Kingdom on 19 February 1976.&lt;ref name="Guðmundsson2006" /&gt; Although Icelandic government was firmly pro-Western, the government linked Iceland's NATO membership with the outcomes of the fishery dispute. If a favorable outcome could not be reached, Iceland implied that it would withdraw from NATO. However, the government never explicitly linked the US Defence Agreement to the outcome of the dispute.&lt;ref name="Guðmundsson2006" /&gt;

== Results==
Iceland achieved its overall aims. As a result, the already-declining British fisheries were hit hard by being excluded from their prime fishing grounds&lt;ref&gt;Georg H.

Oxford University Press, 1992. p. 95. {{ISBN|0-19-211676-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cost for repairing the damaged Royal Navy frigates was probably over £1 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Trawling: the rise and fall of the British trawl fishery|last=Robinson|first=Robb|publisher=University of Exeter Press|year=1996|isbn=0859894800|location=|pages=243}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the British government offered a multimillion-pound compensation deal and apology to fishermen who lost their livelihoods in the 1970s. More than 35 years after the workers lost their jobs, the £1,000 compensation offered to 2,500 fisherman was criticised for being insufficient and excessively delayed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/uk/scotland/article3376266.ece |title= Cod Wars payment is 'too little, too late' |author= Nick Drainey |date= 6 April 2012 |newspaper= The Times |accessdate= 6 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Scholarship ==
A 2016 review article finds that the underlying drivers behind the desire to extend fishery limits were economic and legal for Iceland, but they were economic and strategic for the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="Steinsson2016"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Steinsson|first=Sverrir|date=2016-03-22|year=|title=The Cod Wars: a re-analysis|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09662839.2016.1160376?journalCode=feus20|journal=European Security|volume=0|pages=1–20|doi=10.1080/09662839.2016.1160376|issn=0966-2839|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It, however, argues that "these underlying causes account for the tensions but are not enough to explain why bargaining failure occurred".&lt;ref name="Steinsson2016" /&gt; After all, the outbreak of each Cod War was costly and risky for both sides.

Several factors are mentioned to explain why bargaining failure occurred.&lt;ref name="Steinsson2016" /&gt; The nature of nationalism and party competition for Iceland and pressure from the trawling industry for Britain are reasons that both sides took actions that were of noticeable risk to their broader security interests. Interdepartmental competition and unilateral behaviour by individual diplomats were also factors, with the British Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries influencing the British government's decision 'more than the Foreign Office'.&lt;ref name="Steinsson2016" /&gt;

A 2017 study argues that both a combination of powerful domestic pressures on statesmen to escalate and miscalculation by those statesmen contributed to the outbreak of the Cod Wars.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The study argues that Iceland won each of the Cod Wars because Icelandic statesmen were too greatly constrained by domestic politics to offer compromises to the British, but British statesmen were not as constrained by public opinion at home.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Lessons drawn for international relations ==
International relations scholars such as [[Robert Keohane]], [[Joseph Nye]], [[Hans Morgenthau]], [[Henry Kissinger]] and [[Richard Ned Lebow|Ned Lebow]] have written on the Cod Wars.&lt;ref name="Steinsson2016" /&gt;

The 2016 review article finds that lessons from the Cod Wars have most commonly been applied to [[Liberalism (international relations)|liberal]] and [[Realism (international relations)|realist]] [[international relations theory]] and theories on [[Inequality of bargaining power|asymmetric bargaining]].&lt;ref name="Steinsson2016" /&gt; It claims that the Cod Wars are widely seen as inconsistent with the precepts of the [[Liberalism (international relations)|liberal peace]], since democracy, trade and institutions are supposed to pacify interstate behavior.&lt;ref name="Steinsson2016" /&gt; The Cod Wars are also held up as an example of the decreasing salience of [[hard power]] in international relations, with implications for realist theory which emphasizes the importance of hard power.&lt;ref name="Steinsson2016" /&gt; Theorists on asymmetric bargaining have emphasized how Iceland, lacking structural power, can still have an issue power advantage, with its greater commitment to the cause.&lt;ref name="Steinsson2016" /&gt;

A 2017 study argues that the occurrence of the Cod Wars is inconsistent with liberal international relations theory, including the [[democratic peace theory|democratic peace thesis]], as the "supposedly pacifying factors of the liberal peace – democracy, trade and institutional ties – effectively made the disputes more contentious".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The Cod Wars are often mentioned in Icelandic and British news reporting when either state is involved in a fishery dispute or when there are disputes of some sort between the two countries.

{{Alternative dispute resolution}}

'''Collaborative law''', also known as '''collaborative practice''', '''divorce''' or '''family law''',&lt;ref&gt;See "History" in this article, and Footnote 4.&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[legal process]] enabling couples who have decided to separate or end their marriage to work with their lawyers and, on occasion, other family professionals in order to avoid the uncertain outcome of court and to achieve a settlement that best meets the specific needs of both parties and their children without the underlying threat of [[litigation]]. The process allows parties to have a fair settlement. The voluntary process is initiated when the couple signs a [[contract]] (a "participation agreement") binding each other to the process and disqualifying their respective lawyer's right to represent either one in any future family-related litigation.

The collaborative process can be used to facilitate a broad range of other family issues, including disputes between parents and the drawing up of pre and post-marital contracts. As the traditional method of drawing up pre-marital contracts is oppositional, many couples prefer to begin their married life with documents drawn up [[Consent|consensually]] and mutually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lawgazette.co.uk/news/family-solicitors-report-rise-039collaborative-prenups |title=Law Society Gazette Collaborative Pre-Nups |publisher=Lawgazette.co.uk |accessdate=31 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Collaborative law processes also have the added benefit of being cost efficient for the involved parties. As the necessary tasks in the collaborative model are assigned to specialist professionals without duplication of effort, cost savings are realized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://peteraxelrodlaw.com/efficiency-collaborative-divorce-settlement-process/ |title=The Efficiency of the Collaborative Divorce Settlement Process |publisher=Axelrod Collaborative Law |accessdate=24 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; These cost efficiencies, in addition to other potential benefits, have led parties in other contexts to explore the use of collaborative law to resolve disputes, including M&amp;A transactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Fabian |first1=Christian| title=Is Collaborative Law an Option for Resolving M&amp;A Disputes |url=https://www.transactionadvisors.com/insights/collaborative-law-option-resolving-ma-disputes|publisher=Transaction Advisors |ISSN=2329-9134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The history of the Collaborative Law process is disputed, except that it originated in the Midwestern United States. Although some {{who|date=March 2015}} credit Minnesota lawyer, Stu Webb alone, New Jersey divorce lawyer, Curtis J. Romanowski first introduced the concept in 1988 as "Collaborative Dispute Resolution (CDR)." At the time, Romanowski was based in Kansas City, Missouri, and was providing consulting services in Alternate Dispute Resolution to clients throughout the United States. Stu Webb's model of the process that he started calling "Collaborative Law" in 1990 was based upon the use of a "disqualification agreement," where, in the event the collaborative process failed, both attorneys would have to recuse themselves from further case involvement. Webb's approach also involved the retention of joint experts where indicated.

Although the name "Collaborative Law", or "Collaborative Family Law" in its present form, is believed to have originated circa 1988-1990, the ideas  in the family law context, appear to have had a clear antecedent in the concept of "Therapeutic Family Law", as put forward by Canadian-born Chicago family lawyer and writer Nester C. Kohut in the 1960s,   as set out in his book''Therapeutic Family Law; a complete guide to marital reconciliation'' and his later ''Therapeutic Separation Agreements'',  ideas that attracted favorable comment in several law journal articles. {{which|date=March 2015}} According to his writings, these are methods that he developed and implemented in his own Chicago family law practice.&lt;ref&gt;Kohut, Nester C., Therapeutic Family Law; a complete guide to marital reconciliation, 2nd ed., Chicago: 1968, Family Law Publications&lt;/ref&gt;

Romanowski, who had a background including organizational development and trial advocacy, introduced CDR as a team approach to dispute resolution. The approach also included a "recusal pact," at least initially. The application was geared toward labor and domestic relations disputes. Shortly after introducing the model in 1988, he changed his terminology and began calling his concept "Collaborative Law," owing primarily to the confusion the abbreviation "CDR" was causing with "Complimentary Dispute Resolution."

Webb has consistently defended the recusal pact as essential to the Collaborative Law model. Romanowski, on the other hand, rejected the idea of entering into a recusal pact ab initio, thereby signaling his break from what had grown to be the mainstream movement.&lt;ref&gt;John Lande, Possibilities for Collaborative Law: Ethics and Practice of Lawyer Disqualification and Process Control in a New Model of Lawyering, 64 OHIO ST. L. J. 1315, 1328-29&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, Romanowski introduced "Progressive Divorce(R)," which broke down his model into four incremental phases.&lt;ref&gt;John Lande, Possibilities for Collaborative Law: Ethics and Practice of Lawyer Disqualification and Process Control in a New Model of Lawyering, 64 OHIO ST. L. J. 1315, 1323&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Curtis J. Romanowski, Progressive Divorce: A 4-Phases Outcome-Driven Approach to Nonlitigated Dispute Resolution, MATRIMONIAL STRATEGIST, July 2002, at 4-5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="divorcenewjersey.com"&gt;{{cite news|title=About Progressive New Jersey Divorce NJ Matrimonial &amp; Family Lawyers ADR Solution|url=http://www.divorcenewjersey.com/progressive.html|publisher=divorcenewjersey.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140914034525/http://divorcenewjersey.com/progressive.html|archivedate=14 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also John Lande, Principles of Policymaking about Collaborative Law and Other ADR Processes, 22 OHIO STATE J. ON DISP. RESOL. 619 (2007)).&lt;/ref&gt;

At the heart of the Progressive Divorce(R) model was the rejection of the recusal pact until later in the process, only when settlement is imminent. Another key feature is the sparing of ancillary settlement team personnel until such time as the process stage requires it, if at all, maintaining that entering into a recusal pact and establishing a full-blown settlement team are not to be undertaken lightly, and certainly not committed to in the early stages of the process.&lt;ref name="divorcenewjersey.com"/&gt; It is speculated that Romanowski's name has not been as quickly associated with the founding of Collaborative Law since, although he independently developed the concept at about the same time as Stu Webb, he quickly became a leading critic of the model he originally created, believing it to be cumbersome, deceptively costly and largely academic, if not inherently coercive.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.divorcenewjersey.com/collaborative.html  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140914105824/http://www.divorcenewjersey.com/collaborative.html |date=14 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ever since its inception in 1988, the Collaborative Law movement has spread rapidly to most of the United States, Europe, Canada and Australia.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collaborativepractice.com |title=Per the International Academy of Collaborative Professionals ("IACP") |publisher=Collaborativepractice.com |accessdate=31 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than 22,000 lawyers have been trained in Collaborative Law worldwide and more than 1,250 lawyers have completed their training in England and Wales where Collaborative Law was launched in 2003.

The growth of the collaborative process in England and Wales has been encouraged by both the judiciary and the family lawyers organisation, Resolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.resolution.org.uk/editorial.asp?page_id=53 |title=Alternatives to Court |publisher=Resolution |accessdate=31 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an address to London family lawyers in October 2009, the newly appointed Supreme Court Justice, [[Lord Kerr of Tonaghmore]] became the first member of the Supreme Court to  publicly endorse Collaborative Law and called for its extension to other areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spearswms.com/spears-world/shot-before-dawn/15332/collaborative-law.thtml |title=Collaborative Law |publisher=Spears WMS |accessdate=31 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Lech Mintowt-Czyz Last updated 31 December 2011 12:36&amp;nbsp;pm |url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/law/article6866885.ece |title=The Times – Senior judge says 'collaborative' approach can be extended |work=The Times |location=UK |accessdate=31 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, in October 2008 the Hon.

==Organizations==

The primary global collaborative organisation is the International Academy of Collaborative Professionals (IACP), which was founded in the late 1990s by a group of northern California lawyers, psychotherapists, and financial planners. IACP has more than 5,000 members and there are more than 325 practice groups of collaborative practitioners worldwide.  The IACP offers an opportunity for education and networking for its members&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IACP Networking and Educational Forum|url=https://www.collaborativepractice.com/professional/trainings-events/iacp-networking-and-educational-forum.aspx|website=International Academy of Collaborative Professionals|accessdate=26 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well provides a resource for research on collaborative divorce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cordover |first=Adam |url=http://familydiplomacy.com/blog/collaborative-divorce/research-collaborative-divorce-by-the-numbers-2010/ |title=Research - Collaborative Divorce by the Numbers (2010) |work=Family Diplomacy: A Collaborative Law Firm |date=28 August 2015 |accessdate=26 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uniform Collaborative Law Act==

In the United States, the Uniform Collaborative Law Act was adopted in 2009 by the Uniform Law Commission, and thereby became available to the individual States to enact as law. In 2010, the Uniform Collaborative Law Act was amended to add several options and renamed the Uniform Collaborative Law Rules and Act. As of June 2013, the Uniform Collaborative Law Act was enacted into law in the states of Utah, Nevada, Texas, Hawaii, Ohio, the District of Columbia, and Washington State, and passed by the Alabama Legislature but awaiting the Governor's signature, and was pending enactment in several additional U.S. states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uniformlaws.org/Act.aspx?title=Collaborative%20Law%20Act |title=Collaborative Law Act |publisher=Nccusl.org |accessdate=31 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Texas, Houston-based family lawyer [[Harry Tindall]] has been instrumental in securing passage of the UCLA by the Texas Legislature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://law.hofstra.edu/pdf/academics/journals/lawreview/lrv_issues_v38n02_dd6_tindall.pdf |title=THE UNIFORM COLLABORATIVE LAW ACT AS  A TEACHING TOOL |publisher=Hofstra |accessdate=10 Mar 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On March 24, 2016, Florida Governor Rick Scott signed the Collaborative Law Process Act, Florida's version of the Uniform Collaborative Law Act, which creates a statutory privilege that makes confidential communications had during the collaborative process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://familydiplomacy.com/blog/florida-statutes/governor-scott-signs-florida-collaborative-divorce-bill-into-law/ |title=Governor Scott Signs Collaborative Divorce Bill Into Law |publisher=FamilyDiplomacy.com |accessdate=11 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Overview to the Act provides a comprehensive and reliable history of the emergence of collaborative law in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.upenn.edu/bll/archives/ulc/ucla/2010_final.htm |title=law.upenn.edu |publisher=law.upenn.edu |accessdate=31 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some states, like Florida, which were waiting on the passage of the Uniform Collaborative Law Act, local judges had been teaming up with collaborative professionals and creating local rules and administrative orders endorsing and regulating collaborative law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcfamilyblog.wordpress.com/2012/08/03/press-release-tampas-chief-judge-signs-administrative-order-on-collaborative-divorce/ |title=Tampa Chief Judge Signs Administrative Order on Collaborative Divorce |publisher=abcfamilyblog.wordpress.com |accessdate=22 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14468">'''Death flights''' ({{lang-es|'''vuelos de la muerte'''|links=no}}) are a form of [[extrajudicial killing]] practised by military forces in possession of aircraft: victims are dropped to their death from airplanes or helicopters into oceans, large rivers or even mountains. Death flights have been carried out in a number of [[internal conflict]]s, including the 1957 [[Battle of Algiers (1957)|Battle of Algiers]] and by the [[National Reorganization Process|junta dictatorship]] during the Argentine 1974–1983 "[[Dirty War]]".

== The Dirty War in Argentina ==
During the [[Argentine Dirty War]], from 1976 to 1983 an estimated 10,000 people [[Forced disappearance|disappeared]], kidnapped clandestinely by groups acting for the dictatorship. Human rights groups in Argentina often cite a figure of 30,000 disappeared; [[Amnesty International]] estimates 20,000.&lt;ref name="google246"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KmLdiaVnPeIC&amp;pg=PA246|title=The Politics of the Past in an Argentine Working-Class Neighbourhood|first=Lindsay|last=DuBois|date=1 October 2017|publisher=University of Toronto Press|accessdate=1 October 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many were killed in death flights, a practice initiated by Admiral [[Luis María Mendía]], usually after detention and torture. Typically they were drugged into a stupor, loaded into aircraft, stripped, and dropped into the [[Río de la Plata]] or the [[Atlantic Ocean]].

According to the testimony of [[Adolfo Scilingo]], a former Argentine naval officer convicted in [[Spain]] in 2005 of crimes against humanity under the doctrine of [[universal jurisdiction]], there were 180–200 death flights in the years 1977 and 1978; Scilingo confessed to participating in two such flights, with 13 and 17 people killed respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4193341.stm|title = Spain tries Argentine ex-officer | work=BBC News | date=January 20, 2005 | accessdate=January 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He estimated that the navy conducted the flights every Wednesday for two years, 1977 and 1978, and that 1,500 to 2,000 people were killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Calvin Sims|title=Argentine Tells of Dumping 'Dirty War' Captives Into Sea|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/13/world/argentine-tells-of-dumping-dirty-war-captives-into-sea.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Victims were sometimes made to dance for joy in celebration of the freedom that they were told awaited them. In an earlier interview, in 1996, Scilingo said, "They were played lively music and made to dance for joy, because they were going to be transferred to the south. ... After that, they were told they had to be vaccinated due to the transfer, and they were injected with [[Sodium thiopental|Pentothal]]. And shortly after, they became really drowsy, and from there we loaded them onto trucks and headed off for the airfield."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/9603/argentina.war/index.html|title = Macabre new details emerge about Argentina's 'dirty war' | work=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scilingo said that the [[Argentine Navy]] was "still hiding what happened during the Dirty War".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.scotsman.com/topics.cfm?tid=76&amp;id=65872005 |title='Death flight' captain says Argentine navy is hiding horrors |location=Edinburgh |work=The Scotsman |date=January 19, 2005 |deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070517040206/http://news.scotsman.com/topics.cfm?tid=76&amp;id=65872005 |archivedate=May 17, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2010, Spain extradited pilot Julio Alberto Poch to Argentina.

An organised military structure was in place to carry out these flights, ''Batallón de Aviación del Ejército 601'' (Army Air Battalion 601), with a commander, sub-commander, chief of staff, and officers of five [[Company (military unit)|companies]] making up the unit. Soldiers who refused to take part, as well as others who acted as airfield guards and runway cleaners, testified that they had seen live people and corpses loaded onto aircraft; after taking off, the planes returned empty.

Oregier Benavente, [[Augusto Pinochet|Pinochet's]] former personal helicopter pilot, has admitted that, many times, he threw prisoners into the [[Pacific Ocean|ocean]] or into the high peaks of the [[Andes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |date=January 11, 2001 |title=Ex piloto de Pinochet reconoció que lanzó cuerpos al mar |url=http://www.emol.com/noticias/todas/2001/01/11/42929/ex-piloto-de-pinochet-reconocio-que-lanzo-cuerpos-al-mar.html |work=Emol.com |location= |access-date=December 10, 2017|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Flights were also used to make bodies of already killed dissidents disappear. A testimony describes the following procedure: Corpses were put in [[gunny sack]]s, the sacks were attached to a piece of [[Track (rail transport)|rail]] using wire, and a second gunny sack was put around both. The sacks were carried on a pickup truck to the helicopters that flew towards the open sea off the coast of the [[Valparaíso Region]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |date=March 10, 2007 |title=La brigada más cruel de la DINA |url=http://lanacion.cl/2007/03/10/la-brigada-mas-cruel-de-la-dina/ |work=[[La Nación (Chile)|La Nación]] |location= |access-date=December 10, 2017|language=Spanish }}&lt;/ref&gt; where the bodies were thrown into the ocean.

[[Image:Modem-usr-courier-v34-front-online.jpg|thumb|Active [[modem]]]]
'''Dial-up Internet access''' is a form of [[Internet access]] that uses the facilities of the [[public switched telephone network]] (PSTN) to establish a connection to an [[Internet service provider]] (ISP) by dialing a [[telephone number]] on a conventional [[telephone line]]. The user's computer or [[router (computing)|router]] uses an attached [[modem]] to encode and decode information into and from audio frequency signals, respectively. 

In 1979, [[Tom Truscott]] and [[Steve Bellovin]], graduates for [[Duke University]], created an early predecessor to dial-up Internet access called the [[USENET]]. The USENET was a [[UNIX]] based system that used a dial-up connection to transfer data through telephone modems.&lt;ref name="Hauben"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hauben|first1=Michael|last2=Hauben|first2=Rhonda|title=Netizens: On the History and Impact of Usenet and the Internet|date=1997|publisher=IEEE Computer Society Press|location=Los Alamitos, CA|isbn=0-8186-7706-6|pages=161–200|edition=1st|url=http://www.columbia.edu/~rh120/|accessdate=25 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dial-up Internet has been around since the 1980s via public providers such as [[NSFNET]]-linked universities and was first offered commercially in July 1992 by [[Sprint Corporation|Sprint]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://h-net.msu.edu/cgi-bin/logbrowse.pl?trx=vx&amp;list=edtech&amp;month=9207&amp;week=&amp;msg=An61j4s0%2BR1UHNuEZOgGfw&amp;user=&amp;pw= |website=h-net.msu.edu |date=31 July 1992 |title=H-Net Discussion Networks – SprintLink Commercial Availability Announced (fwd)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite losing ground to [[broadband]] since the mid-2000s, dial-up is still used where other forms are not available or where the cost is too high, such as in some rural or remote areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.digitaltrends.com/cool-tech/aol-dial-up-a-relic-of-the-past/|title=What’s it like to use AOL dial-up internet in 2017?|date=2017-04-01|work=Digital Trends|access-date=2018-06-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/dial-up-internet-used-by-hundreds-of-thousands-in-canada-1.1202392|title=Dial-up internet used by hundreds of thousands in Canada {{!}} CBC News|work=CBC|access-date=2018-06-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Availability==
Dial-up connections to the Internet require no [[infrastructure]] other than the [[telephone network]] and the modems and servers needed to make and answer the calls. Where telephone access is widely available, dial-up is often the only choice available for [[Rural Internet|rural or remote]] areas, where [[broadband]] installations are not prevalent due to low population density and high infrastructure cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/dial-up-internet-used-by-hundreds-of-thousands-in-canada-1.1202392|title=Dial-up internet used by hundreds of thousands in Canada {{!}} CBC News|work=CBC|access-date=2018-06-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dial-up access may also be an alternative for users on limited budgets, as it is offered free by some ISPs, though broadband is increasingly available at lower prices in many countries due to market competition.

Dial-up requires time to establish a telephone connection (up to several seconds, depending on the location) and perform configuration for protocol synchronization before data transfers can take place. In locales with telephone connection charges, each connection incurs an incremental cost. If calls are time-metered, the duration of the connection incurs costs.

Dial-up access is a transient connection, because either the user, ISP or phone company terminates the connection. Internet service providers will often set a limit on connection durations to allow sharing of resources, and will disconnect the user—requiring reconnection and the costs and delays associated with it. Technically inclined users often find a way to disable the auto-disconnect program such that they can remain connected for more days than one.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

A 2008 [[Pew Research Center]] study stated that only 10% of US adults still used dial-up Internet access. The study found that the most common reason for retaining dial-up access was high broadband prices. Users cited lack of infrastructure as a reason less often than stating that they would never upgrade to broadband.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,375624,00.html |title=Many Dial-Up Users Don't Want Broadband |accessdate=2009-11-03 |agency=Associated Press |publisher=[[Fox News Channel]] | date=2008-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; That number had fallen to 6% by 2010,{{r|todd20120215}} and to 3% by 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title=3% of Americans use dial-up at home |url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2013/08/21/3-of-americans-use-dial-up-at-home/ | work=Pew Research Center| accessdate=2013-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission|CRTC]] estimated that there were 336,000 Canadian dial-up users in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/dial-up-internet-used-by-hundreds-of-thousands-in-canada-1.1202392|title=Dial-up internet used by hundreds of thousands in Canada {{!}} CBC News|work=CBC|access-date=2018-06-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Replacement by broadband==
Broadband internet access via [[cable Internet access|cable]], [[digital subscriber line]], [[Satellite Internet access|satellite]] and [[Fiber to the x|FTTx]] has replaced dial-up access in many parts of the world. Broadband connections typically offer speeds of 700 [[kbit/s]] or higher for two-thirds more than the price of dial-up on average.&lt;ref name="todd20120215"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/12046/1210209-28.stm | title=Plenty of Internet users cling to slow dial-up connections | work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette | date=2012-02-15 | accessdate=February 17, 2012 | author=Todd, Deborah M.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition broadband connections are always on, thus avoiding the need to connect and disconnect at the start and end of each session. Broadband does not require exclusive use of a phone line and so one can access the Internet and at the same time make and receive voice phone calls without having a second phone line.

However, many rural areas still remain without high speed Internet despite the eagerness of potential customers. This can be attributed to population, location, or sometimes ISPs' lack of interest due to little chance of profitability and high costs to build the required infrastructure. Some dial-up ISPs have responded to the increased competition by lowering their rates and making dial-up an attractive option for those who merely want email access or basic web browsing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2009/02/27/could-you-go-back-to-dial-up/ |title=Could You Go Back to Dial-Up? - Digits - WSJ.com  |accessdate=2009-02-27 |work=Wall Street Journal|publisher=Dow Jones | first=Andrew | last=LaVallee | date=2009-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,500686,00.html |title=Recession Has Many Holding on to Dirt-Cheap Dial-Up  |accessdate=2009-02-27 |work=Fox News | date=2009-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dial-up Internet access has undergone a precipitous fall in usage, and potentially approaches extinction as modern users turn towards broadband. In contrast to the year 2000 when about 34% of the U.S. population used dial-up, this dropped to 3% in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Home Broadband 2013 |work= Pew Internet &amp; American Life Project |url=http://pewinternet.org/Reports/2013/Broadband.aspx |accessdate= April 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adding to the extinction of dial-up is many newer programs such as antivirus and major applications download their sizable updates automatically in the background when a connection is first made and this can greatly impact the available bandwidth available to other applications like browsers until all updates have completed which may take several minutes or longer. Since an "always on" broadband is the norm expected by most newer applications being developed, this automatic upload trend in the background is expected to continue to eat away at dial-up's available bandwidth to the detriment of dial-up users' applications.&lt;ref&gt;Kaspersky Technical Support website [search "dial up" slow] July 17, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Many newer websites also now assume broadband speeds as the norm and when confronted with slower dial-up speeds may drop (timeout) these slower connections to free up communication resources. On websites that are designed to be more dial-up friendly, use of a [[reverse proxy]] prevents dial-ups from being dropped as often but can introduce long wait periods for dial-up users caused by the buffering used by a reverse proxy to bridge the different data rates.

Modern dial-up modems typically have a maximum theoretical transfer speed of 56 kbit/s (using the [[List of ITU-T V-series recommendations#Simultaneous transmission of data and other signals|V.90]] or [[V.92]] [[Communications protocol|protocol]]), although in most cases, 40–50 kbit/s is the norm. Factors such as phone [[line noise]] as well as the quality of the modem itself play a large part in determining connection speeds.

Some connections may be as low as 20 kbit/s in extremely noisy environments, such as in a hotel room where the phone line is shared with many extensions, or in a rural area, many miles from the phone exchange. Other factors such as long loops, [[loading coil]]s, [[pair gain]], [[electric fence]]s (usually in rural locations), and [[digital loop carrier]]s can also slow connections to 20 kbit/s or lower.

Analog telephone lines are digitally switched and transported inside a [[Digital Signal 0]] once reaching the telephone company's equipment. [[Digital Signal 0]] is 64 kbit/s and reserves 8 kbit/s for signalling information; therefore a 56 kbit/s connection is the highest that will ever be possible with analog phone lines.

Dial-up connections usually have [[latency (engineering)|latency]] as high as 150 ms or even more; this is longer than for many forms of broadband, such as cable or DSL, but typically less than satellite connections. Longer latency can make [[Videoconferencing|video conferencing]] and [[Online game|online gaming]] difficult, if not impossible. An increasing amount of Internet content such as [[streaming media]] will not work at dial-up speeds.

Video games released from the mid-1990s to the mid-2000s that utilized internet access such as ''[[EverQuest]]'', ''[[Red Faction]]'', ''[[Warcraft 3]]'', ''[[Final Fantasy XI]]'', ''[[Phantasy Star Online]]'', ''[[Guild Wars]]'', ''[[Unreal Tournament]]'', ''[[Halo: Combat Evolved]]'', ''[[Audition Online|Audition]]'',  ''[[Quake 3: Arena]]'', ''[[Starsiege: Tribes]]'' and ''[[Ragnarok Online]]'', etc., accommodated for 56k dial-up with limited [[data transfer]] between the game servers and user's personal computer. The first consoles to provide Internet connectivity, the [[Dreamcast]] and [[PlayStation 2]], supported dial-up as well as broadband. The [[GameCube]] had an ability to use dial-up and broadband connections, but this was used in very few games and required a separate adapter. The [[Xbox (console)|original Xbox]] exclusively required a broadband connection. Many computer and video games released since the mid-2000s do not even include the option to use dial-up. However, there are exceptions to this, such as ''[[Vendetta Online]]'', which can still run on a dial-up modem.

===Using compression to exceed 56k===
[[V.42|The V.42, V.42bis and V.44 standards]] allow modems to accept uncompressed data at a rate faster than the line rate. These algorithms use [[data compression]] to achieve higher throughput.

For instance, a 53.3 kbit/s connection with V.44 can transmit up to 53.3 × 6 = 320 kbit/s if the offered data stream can be compressed that much.  However, the compressibility of data tends to vary considerably, for example, due to the transfer of already-compressed files (ZIP files, JPEG images, MP3 audio, MPEG video).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pricenfees.com/digit-life-archives/modem-compression-v-44-v-42bis |title=Modem compression: V.44 against V.42bis |accessdate=2008-02-18 |author=Pavel Mitronov |publisher=Pricenfees.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A modem might be sending compressed files at approximately 50 kbit/s, uncompressed files at 160 kbit/s, and pure text at 320 kbit/s, or any rate in this range.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fndcg0.fnal.gov/Net/modm8-94.txt |accessdate=2008-02-18 |title=What You Need to Know about Modems |author=Karl Willdig |work=Fermilab Data Communications and Networking Group |publisher=Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070104124418/http://fndcg0.fnal.gov/Net/modm8-94.txt |archivedate=2007-01-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Compression by the ISP====
{{Main article|Web accelerator}}
As telephone-based internet lost popularity in the mid 2000s, some Internet service providers such as TurboUSA, [[Netscape]], CdotFree, and [[NetZero]] started using data compression to increase the perceived speed.  As an example, EarthLink advertises "surf the Web up to 7x faster" using a compression program that squeezes images, text/html, and SWF flash animations prior to transmission across the phone line.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.earthlink.net/dialup/|title=EarthLink Dial-Up Internet service – fast, reliable dialup access nationwide.|website=www.earthlink.net|access-date=2017-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pre-compression operates much more efficiently than the on-the-fly compression of V.44 modems.  Typically website text is compacted to 5% thus increasing effective throughput to approximately 1000 kbit/s, and JPEG/GIF/PNG images are lossy-compressed to 15–20% (increasing throughput up to 300 kbit/s).

The drawback of this approach is a loss in quality, where the graphics acquire [[compression artifacts]] taking on a blurry or colorless appearance; however the perceived speed is dramatically improved.  (If desired the user may choose to view uncompressed images instead, but at a much slower load rate.)  Since streaming music and video are already compressed at the source, they are typically passed by the ISP unaltered.

The '''Energy Performance of Buildings Directive''' ('''EPBD''') is the [[European Union]]'s’s main legislative instrument aiming to promote the improvement of the energy performance of buildings within the Community&lt;ref&gt;European Commission: "[https://ec.europa.eu/energy/en/topics/energy-efficiency/buildings Buildings]", 2017&lt;/ref&gt;. It was inspired by the [[Kyoto Protocol]] which commits the EU and all its parties by setting binding emission reduction targets&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change: "[http://unfccc.int/kyoto_protocol/items/2830.php Kyoto Protocol]", 2017&lt;/ref&gt;.

== History ==

=== Directive 2002/91/EC ===

The first version of the EPBD, directive 2002/91/EC, was approved on 16 December 2002 and entered into force on 4 January 2003&lt;ref name= EC1&gt;European Commission, "[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2003:001:0065:0071:EN:PDF DIRECTIVE 2002/91/EC OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 16 December 2002 on the energy performance of buildings]", Official Journal of the European Communities, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;. [[EU Member States]] (MS) had to comply with the Directive within three years of the inception date (4 January 2006), by bringing into force necessary laws, regulations and administrative provisions&lt;ref name= EC1/&gt;. In the case of lack of qualified and/or accredited experts, the directive allowed for a further extension in implementation by 4 January 2006&lt;ref name= EC1/&gt;.

The Directive required that the MS strengthen their building regulations and introduce energy performance certification of buildings&lt;ref name= EC1/&gt;. More specifically, it required member states to comply with Article 7 ([[Energy Performance Certificate]]s), Article 8 (Inspection of [[boilers]]) and Article 9 (Inspection of [[HVAC|air conditioning systems]])&lt;ref name= EC1/&gt;. 

=== Directive 2010/31/EU ===


Directive 2002/91/EC was later on replaced by the so-called "EPBD recast", which was approved on 19 May 2010 and entered into force on 18 June 2010&lt;ref name= EC2&gt;European Commission, "[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32010L0031&amp;from=EN DIRECTIVE 2010/31/EU OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 19 May 2010 on the energy performance of buildings (recast)]", Official Journal of the European Communities, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;. 

This version of the EPBD (Directive 2010/31/EU) broadened its focus on Nearly [[Zero-energy building]]s, cost optimal levels of minimum energy performance requirements as well as improved policies. 

According to the recast&lt;ref name= EC2/&gt;:
* for buildings offered for sale or rent, the energy performance certificates shall be stated in the advertisements
* Member States shall lay down the necessary measures to establish inspection schemes for heating and air-conditioning systems or take measures with equivalent impact
* all new buildings shall be nearly zero energy buildings by 31 December 2020; the same applies to all new public buildings after 31 December 2018.
* Member States shall set minimum energy performance requirements for new buildings, for buildings subject to major renovation, as well as for the replacement or retrofit of building elements 
* Member States shall draw up lists of national financial measures and instruments to improve the energy efficiency of buildings.

=== Proposal for a revised directive on the EPBD (COM/2016/0765) ===


On 30 November 2016, the European Commission published the "Clean Energy For All Europeans", a package of measures boosting the clean [[energy transition]] in line with its commitment to cut CO2 emissions by at least 40% by 2030, modernise the economy and create conditions for sustainable jobs and growth&lt;ref name= EC3&gt;European Commission, "[https://ec.europa.eu/energy/en/news/commission-proposes-new-rules-consumer-centred-clean-energy-transition Commission proposes new rules for consumer centred clean energy transition]", 30 November 2016&lt;/ref&gt;. The package included a whole set of legislative proposals&lt;ref name= EC3/&gt;, e.g.:
* A proposal for a revised electricity regulation&lt;ref&gt;European Commission, "[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52016PC0861R%2801%29 Proposal for a REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL on the internal market for electricity (recast)]", 2016&lt;/ref&gt;/directive&lt;ref&gt;European Commission, "[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52016PC0864R%2801%29 Proposal for a DIRECTIVE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL on common rules for the internal market in electricity (recast)]", 2016&lt;/ref&gt;
* A proposal for a revised regulation on a European Agency for the co-operation of energy regulators ([[Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators|ACER]])&lt;ref&gt;European Commission, "[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52016PC0863R%2801%29 Proposal for a REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL establishing a European Union Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (recast)]", 2016&lt;/ref&gt; 
* A proposal for a revised energy efficiency directive&lt;ref&gt;European Commission, "[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1485938766830&amp;uri=CELEX:52016PC0761 Proposal for a DIRECTIVE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL amending Directive 2012/27/EU on energy efficiency]", 2016&lt;/ref&gt;
* A proposal for a revised energy performance of buildings directive&lt;ref name= EC4&gt;European Commission, "[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1490877208700&amp;uri=CELEX:52016PC0765 Proposal for a DIRECTIVE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL amending Directive 2010/31/EU on the energy performance of buildings]", 2016&lt;/ref&gt;
* A proposal for a revised renewable energy directive&lt;ref&gt;European Commission, "[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52016PC0767R%2801%29 Proposal for a DIRECTIVE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources (recast)]", 2016&lt;/ref&gt;
* A proposal for a regulation on the governance of the Energy Union&lt;ref&gt;European Commission, "[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=COM:2016:759:REV1 Proposal for a REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL on the Governance of the Energy Union, amending Directive 94/22/EC, Directive 98/70/EC, Directive 2009/31/EC, Regulation (EC) No 663/2009, Regulation (EC) No 715/2009, Directive 2009/73/EC, Council Directive 2009/119/EC, Directive 2010/31/EU, Directive 2012/27/EU, Directive 2013/30/EU and Council Directive (EU) 2015/652 and repealing Regulation (EU) No 525/2013]", 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

The proposal for a revised directive on the EPBD (COM/2016/0765) puts energy efficiency first and supports cost-effective building renovation&lt;ref name= EC4/&gt;. 

The EU Council agreed its position on the proposal on 26 June 2017&lt;ref name= EC5&gt;Council of the European Union, "[http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2017/06/26-energy-efficient-buildings/ Energy efficient buildings: increased energy savings and better living conditions]", 26 June 2017&lt;/ref&gt;.

The proposal will update the EPBD through&lt;ref name= EC5/&gt;:
* The incorporation of long term building renovation strategies (Article of 4 Energy Efficiency Directive), the support to mobilise finance and a clear vision for the decarbonisation of buildings by 2050
* The encouragement of the use of information communication and smart technologies to ensure the efficient operation of buildings 
* Streamlined provisions in the case of delivery failure of the expected results  

In particular the proposal&lt;ref name= EC5/&gt;:
* introduces building automation and control (BAC) systems as an alternative to physical inspections
* encourages the roll-out of the required infrastructure for e-mobility and 
* introduces a "smartness indicator" 
* strengthens the links between public funding for building renovation and energy performance certificates and 
* incentivises tackling energy poverty through building renovation.

On 11 October 2017, the European Parliament's Committee on Industry, Research and Energy ([[European Parliament Committee on Industry, Research and Energy|ITRE]]) voted positively&lt;ref name=N1&gt;European Parliament. [http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20171009IPR85658/buildings-in-the-eu-highly-energy-efficient-and-money-saving-by-2050 Buildings in the EU: highly energy-efficient and money-saving by 2050]. Retrieved 5 December 2017&lt;/ref&gt; on a draft report&lt;ref&gt; Committee on Industry, Research and Energy. [http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//NONSGML+COMPARL+PE-603.067+01+DOC+PDF+V0//EN&amp;language=EN DRAFT REPORT on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending directive 2010/31/EU on the energy performance of buildings]. 2017&lt;/ref&gt; on the revised EPBD&lt;ref name= EC4/&gt;. The Committee ''"approved rules to channel the focus towards energy-efficiency and cost-effectiveness of building renovations in the EU, updating the EPBD as part of the "Clean Energy for All Europeans"''&lt;ref name= EC3/&gt; ''package"''&lt;ref name= N1/&gt;. 

Bendt Bendtsen, member of ITRE and rapporteur of the EPBD review dossier said&lt;ref name= N1/&gt;: ''"It is vital that Member States show a clear commitment and take concrete actions in their long-term planning. This includes facilitating access to financial tools, showing investors that energy efficiency renovations are prioritised, and enabling public authorities to invest in well-performing buildings"''.

The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety of the European Parliament ([[European Parliament Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety|ENVI]]), also provided its opinion (voted on 7 September 2017) to ITRE's report introducing an ''"obligation to ensure that energy performance upgrades also contribute to a healthy indoor environment"''&lt;ref&gt;Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety of the European Parliament (ENVI). [http://www.europarl.europa.eu/cmsdata/126183/16%20-%20ENVI%20News%207%20September%202017.pdf ENVI news, 07 September, 2017].&lt;/ref&gt;. In August 2017, during his earlier interview for the REHVA journal, ITRE's rapporteur also supported that ''"Indoor climate and health is a priority"''&lt;ref&gt;Federation of European Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning Associations (REHVA). [http://www.rehva.eu/fileadmin/REHVA_Journal/REHVA_Journal_2017/RJ4/RJ1704_WEB.pdf The REHVA European HVAC Journal, Volume 54, Issue 4, August 2017].&lt;/ref&gt;.

== EPBD Support Initiatives ==

The European Commission has launched practical support initiatives with the objective to help and support EU countries with the implementation of the EPBD.

=== EPBD Concerted Action ===
 

The Concerted Action EPBD (CA EPBD) was launched in 2005 under the European Union's [[Horizon 2020]] research and innovation programme to address the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD), with the objective to promote dialogue and exchange of knowledge and best practices between all 28 Member States and Norway for reducing energy use in buildings&lt;ref name= CAEPBD&gt;CA EPBD, "[http://www.epbd-ca.eu/home The Concerted Action EPBD (CA EPBD)]", 2017&lt;/ref&gt;.

The first CA EPBD was launched in 2005 and closed in June 2007 followed by a second phase and a third phase from 2011 to 2015&lt;ref name= CAEPBD /&gt;. The current CA EPBD (CA EPBD IV), a joint initiative between the EU Member States and the European Commission, runs since October 2015 to March 2018 with the aim to transpose and implement the EPBD recast&lt;ref name= CAEPBD /&gt;. 

=== EPBD Buildings Platform ===

The EPBD Buildings Platform was launched by the European Commission in the framework of the Intelligent Energy – Europe, 2003–2006 Programme, as the central resource of information on the EPBD&lt;ref&gt;Federation of European Heating,Ventilation and Air Conditioning Associations (REHVA), "[http://www.rehva.eu/eu-projects/completed-projects/epbd-building-platform.html EPBD Building Platform]", 2017&lt;/ref&gt;. The Platform comprises databases with publications, events, standards and software tools. Interested organisations or individuals could submit events and publications to the databases. A high number of information papers ([[fact sheets]]) were also produced, with the aim to inform a wide range of people of the status of work in a specific area. The platform also offered a helpdesk with lists of [[frequently asked questions]] and the possibility to ask individual questions.

This initiative was completed in the end of 2008, and a new one, 'BUILD UP' was launched in 2009.

=== BUILD UP ===
 
As a continuation of its support to the Member States in implementing the EPBD, the European Commission launched the BUILD UP initiative in 2009&lt;ref&gt;BUILD UP, the European Portal For Energy Efficiency in Buildings, "[http://www.buildup.eu/en/about-portal About BUILD UP]", 2017&lt;/ref&gt; . The initiative has been receiving funding under the framework of the Intelligent Energy Europe (IEE) Programme. The first BUILD UP (BUILD UP I) was launched in 2009 and closed in 2011 when BUILD UP II followed in 2012 and ran until 2014. BUILD UP III was running from January 2015 till December 2017. BUILD UP IV started early 2018.

The BUILD UP web portal aims to increase awareness and foster the market transformation towards Nearly Zero-Energy Buildings, catalysing and releasing Europe's collective intelligence for an effective implementation of energy saving measures in buildings, by connecting building professionals, including competent authorities. 

The portal includes databases of publications, news, events, software tools &amp; blog posts. Since the start of BUILD UP II in 2009 the portal introduced added value content items namely as overview articles (allowing for users to read / download them on demand) and free participation webinars, providing an effective learning resource. 

The platform also incorporates the "BUILD UP Skills" webpage, an initiative launched in 2011 under the IEE programme to assist with the training and further education of craftsmen, on-site workers and systems installers of the building sector&lt;ref&gt;BUILD UP, the European Portal For Energy Efficiency in Buildings, "[http://www.buildup.eu/en/skills/about-build-skills About BUILD UP Skills]", 2017&lt;/ref&gt;. BUILD UP hosts all BUILD UP Skills related information (EU Exchange Meetings, Technical Working Groups (TWGs), National pages and country factsheets, news, events and previous newsletters) under its separate section "Skills".

=== Intelligent Energy Europe (IEE) Programme ===
The EU's Intelligent Energy Europe (IEE) Programme was launched in 2003&lt;ref name=N2&gt;ICF. [https://ec.europa.eu/easme/sites/easme-site/files/evaluation_of_iee_buildings_projects_under_iee_ii_main_report.pdf Evaluation of building projects under the Intelligent Energy Europe II Programme]. European Commission. Executive Agency for Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (EASME). 2017&lt;/ref&gt;; the first IEE Programme (IEE I) closed in 2006, and was followed by the second IEE Programme (IEE II) from 2007 to 2013&lt;ref name= N2/&gt;. Most parts of the IEE programme were run by the Executive Agency for SMEs, EASME -formerly known as the Executive Agency for Competitiveness and Innovation (EACI)- on behalf of the European Commission&lt;ref&gt;Executive Agency for Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (EASME). [https://ec.europa.eu/easme/en/intelligent-energy-europe Intelligent Energy Europe]. Retrieved 5 December 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;. The Programme ''"supported projects which sought to overcome non-technical barriers to the uptake, implementation and replication of innovative sustainable energy solutions"''&lt;ref name= N2/&gt; .From 2007 to 2013, the IEE II Programme allocated €72m (16% of the entire IEE II funding) to 63 building-related projects (including CA EPBD II &amp; III)&lt;ref name= N2/&gt;, revealing the strong support for enabling EPBD implementation. The range of topics was broad, covering the fields of deep renovation, Nearly Zero-Energy Buildings, Energy Performance Certificates, renewable energy and the exemplary role of public buildings. Since the Programme's completion, the EU's Horizon 2020 Framework Programme has been funding these type of activities.

'''Dog fighting in the United States''' is an activity in which fights between two [[Game (dog)|game]] [[dog]]s are staged as a form of [[entertainment]] and [[gambling]]. Such activity has existed since the early 19th century in the United States and was gradually prohibited in all states.  It continues as an underground activity in both rural and urban locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=Vick case gives a boost to Georgia dogfighting measure | date=2007-12-11 | publisher= | url =http://www.ledger-enquirer.com/251/story/197128.html | work =Columbus Ledger Enquirer | pages = | accessdate = 2007-12-12 | language = }} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 20th century, police and animal control law enforcement task forces of primarily local and state authorities were formed in many parts of the country to combat dog fighting rings to combat serious animal welfare violations with links to [[organized crime]] and social problems. In 2007, the [[U.S. Congress]] passed a Federal law against interstate dog fighting activities, providing for [[felony]]-level penalties including multi-year prison sentences and large fines for each offense; passage of this law was followed by the involvement of the Inspector General's Office of the [[United States Department of Agriculture|U.S. Department of Agriculture]] in ongoing investigations around the country.

In April 2007, the illegal activity received widespread attention after evidence surfaced suggesting professional football player [[Michael Vick]] had a dog fighting ring operating on his property. The case resulted in guilty pleas by several individuals and to a single felony count for Vick, who received a 21-month federal sentence.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

==History in U.S.==
According to a study by the [[Michigan State University College of Law]] published in 2005, in the United States, dog fighting was once completely legal and was sanctioned and promoted during the colonial period (17th century through 1776) and continuing through the Victorian era in the late 19th century. The early 19th century saw the development in England of the [[Staffordshire Bull Terrier]], first imported into the United States ca. 1817.  Organized dog fighting became a part of American culture, and was promoted by the [[United Kennel Club]].&lt;ref&gt;Mike Homan, The Complete History of Fighting Dogs (Ringpress Books, 1999)&lt;/ref&gt; As the activity grew in popularity, so too did opposition to it. By the early 20th century the [[United Kennel Club]] dropped its support and by the 1960s most states had made it illegal. It was not until 1976 that it was outlawed in all states and even then, enforcement was generally lax.&lt;ref name="Animal Law Overview"&gt;{{cite web|url =http://www.animallaw.info/articles/qvusdogfighting.htm |title=Dog Fighting General Overview |first=Hanna |last=Gibson |publisher=Animal Legal and Historical Center, [[Michigan State University College of Law]] |year=2005 |accessdate=2007-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
By the late 20th century, as dog fighting became more popular in the poor areas of major U.S. cities, research and investigations revealed strong links with connected with [[Gangs|street gangs]] and social ills, enforcement efforts increased.&lt;ref name="Animal Law Overview"/&gt;

Despite legality issues, dogs are still commonly used for fighting purposes all across the continent. The [[American Pit Bull Terrier]] is the most popular breed used for fighting, but foreign breeds, such as the [[Dogo Argentino]] (used widely in South America), and to a lesser extent, the [[Presa Canario]] are also gaining popularity. The [[Dogo Argentino]] is now often seen in dog fight circuits in areas of the United States where the [[American Pit Bull Terrier]] (APBT) has been banned. In [[Miami-Dade County, Florida]], where the APBT, [[American Staffordshire Terrier]], and the [[Staffordshire Bull Terrier]] (or any other dog that substantially conforms to any of these breeds' characteristics) is banned,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.miamidade.gov/animals/pitbull-law.asp |title=Pit Bull Law - Miami-Dade County |publisher=Miamidade.gov |date= |accessdate=2014-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Dogo Argentino has become the main fighting dog of choice, being used at both organized and street level dogfighting.

==Impacts upon modern society==
In the 21st century, dog fighting has become an objectionable and unlawful activity in most places broad categories, and each have motivated constituencies in many areas.

===Animal welfare and rights===

Dog fighting is often considered one of the most serious forms of [[animal abuse]], not only for the violence that the dogs endure during and after the fights, but because they often suffer their entire lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.animallaw.info/article/detailed-discussion-dog-fighting#s54|title=Detailed Discussion of Dog Fighting - Animal Legal &amp; Historical Center|website=www.animallaw.info|accessdate=29 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; At least one major study{{Who|date=December 2009}} alleges that the prevailing mind set among dog fighters is that, the more the dog suffers, the tougher he will become, and the better fighter he will therefore be.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} This position and the resulting treatment afforded the dogs stand in stark contrast with prevailing public values regarding the treatment of dogs in many civilized societies.

In addition to the controversial treatment a dog receives when he has potential as a fighter, according to a filing in U.S. District Court in Richmond by Federal investigators in Virginia, which was obtained under the [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] and published by the ''[[Baltimore Sun]]'' on July 6, 2007, a losing dog or one whose potential is considered unacceptable faces "being put to death by drowning, strangulation, hanging, gun shot, electrocution or some other method".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baltimoresun.com/sports/football/bal-vick0706,0,1487730.story?track=rss ]{{dead link|date=July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/07/07/AR2007070700250_pf.html?noredirect=on|title=Feds: Dog Fights Staged on Vick Property - washingtonpost.com|publisher=|accessdate=29 August 2018|via=www.washingtonpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/2007/07/18/gruesome-details-in-indictment-naming-nfl-quarterback-michael-vick-in.html|title=Gruesome Details in Indictment Naming NFL Quarterback Michael Vick in Dogfighting Case|date=18 July 2007|publisher=|accessdate=29 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the furor arising around the Bad Newz Kennels investigation in Virginia in 2007 and revelations of extreme brutality there, even such diverse notables as hip-hop mogul [[Russell Simmons]] and the Reverend [[Al Sharpton]] joined with [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals]] (PETA) and the [[Humane Society of the United States]] (HSUS) in calling for strong stands against animal cruelty, jointly stating:

{{cquote|Today, we sound a clarion call to all people: Stand up for what is right, and speak out against what is wrong. Dogfighting is unacceptable. Hurting animals for human pleasure or gain is despicable. Cruelty is just plain wrong.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.localtechwire.com/sports/football/nfl/story/1608124/ ]{{dead link|date=October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Stolen pets: bait animals===
In addition to the fate which awaits fighters or even dogs likely to become fighters, often "bait" animals are used to test a dog's fighting instinct. With the use of "Adoption Wanted" or "Good Home Needed" posters to track their "bait" which is used in the training for these "fighters". The "bait" is mauled or killed in the process. Often "bait" animals are stolen pets, as officials with the Sheriff's Department in [[Pima County, Arizona]] say they were shocked to discover a few years ago, according to a story by ''[[National Geographic Society|National Geographic News]]''.&lt;ref name=NatGeo&gt;{{cite news|url= http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2004/02/0218_040218_dogfighting.html |title=U.S. Dog-Fighting Rings Stealing Pets for "Bait" |first=Maryann |last=Mott |publisher=''[[National Geographic Society|National Geographic News]]'' |date=2004-02-18 |accessdate=2007-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to news reports compiled by the National Humane Society, the snouts of bait dogs are wrapped with duct tape to prevent them from injuring dogs being trained for fighting.  Some bait animals have been recovered with their teeth ground down to the gums to render them helpless against fighting dogs.  Other animals, such as cats and rabbits are also reported to be used as "bait" for fighting dogs. Experts have said small dogs, kittens, and rabbits are more at risk of being stolen for bait than larger animals.

''National Geographic'' noted that there are no statistics on how many pets are taken and used as bait by dog fighting rings each year. Patricia Wagner, head of the National Illegal Animal Fighting Task Force for the Humane Society of the United States, offered the statement "I think every state has a problem with it, whether they know it or not."&lt;ref name=NatGeo/&gt;

===Dangers of training dogs for fighting===
After a life of training as a fighting dog, if a dog does not suffer its death while in such service, it is often euthanized. In [[Richmond, Virginia]], when a dog fighter was sentenced in June 2007, it was revealed in court that over a dozen of his dogs had to be euthanized, either because of serious illness, injury or malnutrition, or because their training as fighting dogs made them too dangerous for adoption. Until 2006, the man had kept 16 pit bulls in the backyard of his house, confined with heavy chains used for automobile towing. Experts say chaining the animals is a dogfighting technique for building strength.  When an animal control officer arrived in response to a complaint from a neighbor that one of the dogs had died, he found the dead dog in a trash can. The others had no food, no clean water and no adequate shelter. Jody Jones, program manager of Richmond Animal Care and Control, said in court that the case produced more dogs euthanized than any other case she knows of from her 15-year career in animal control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=http://www.pet-abuse.com |url=http://www.pet-abuse.com/cases/10508/VA/US/ |title=Animal Abuse Case Details: Dog-fighting - 16 dogs - Richmond, VA (US) |publisher=Pet-Abuse.Com |date= |accessdate=2014-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Richmond sentence"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.inrich.com/cva/ric/news.apx.-content-articles-RTD-2007-06-19-0144.html |title=Richmond man gets 4 years for dogfighting |first=Tom |last=Campbell |publisher=''[[Richmond Times-Dispatch]]'' |date=2007-06-19 |accessdate=2007-09-26 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927004238/http://www.inrich.com/cva/ric/news.apx.-content-articles-RTD-2007-06-19-0144.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dogfighting"&gt;{{cite news|title=The growth of dogfighting |publisher=''Richmond Times-Dispatch'' |date=2007-07-03 |url=http://www.inrich.com/cva/ric/news.apx.-content-articles-RTD-2007-07-03-0168.html |accessdate=2007-07-05 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927003433/http://www.inrich.com/cva/ric/news.apx.-content-articles-RTD-2007-07-03-0168.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the seizure of a large number of dogs in an April 2007 dog fighting case in [[Mississippi]], Tara High, executive director of the Humane Society of South Mississippi said "The reality is that they've been used for entertainment. It's quite tragic for those of us that are kind of left to deal with it and the reality that these animals aren't going to be able to be rehabilitated," she said. Ms. High compared the animals to "a loaded weapon. And not something we feel very comfortable letting out into the community."&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite web|author=http://www.pet-abuse.com |url=http://www.pet-abuse.com/cases/11309/MS/US/ |title=Animal Abuse Case Details: Dog-fighting - 41 dogs seized - Pass Christian, MS (US) |publisher=Pet-Abuse.Com |date= |accessdate=2014-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Societal impact, gang, and criminal activities===
For many years, even after it was outlawed, dog fighting was considered an isolated animal welfare issue, and as such was ignored, denied, or disregarded by law enforcement agencies. However, it has now been established that the dog fighting culture is often intimately connected to other criminal activity, with dog fighters frequently involved in organized crime, racketeering, drug distribution, or gangs, and dog fighting events often facilitating gambling and drug trafficking.&lt;ref name="Animal Law Overview"/&gt;

According to the aforementioned Michigan State study,
{{cquote|Even seasoned law enforcement agents are consistently appalled by the atrocities that they encounter before, during, and after dog fights, yet the children in those communities are routinely exposed to the unfathomable violence that is inherent within the blood sport and become conditioned to believe that the violence is normal. Those children are systematically desensitized to the suffering, and ultimately become criminalized.&lt;ref name="Animal Law Overview"/&gt;}}

==Laws in U.S.==
Dog fighting is unlawful in all 50 states and the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]], as well as [[Guam]], [[Puerto Rico]] and the [[Virgin Islands]].  Before the Federal law was passed, [[New York (state)|New York]] already had issued felony penalties up to four years to individuals fighting any types of animals, but some other levels of participation were only [[misdemeanor]] offenses. The state of New York considers attending an animal fight to be merely a violation, which ultimately leads to a fine. States surrounding New York like New Jersey and Connecticut passed a bill, stated that attendance at an animal fight is indeed a felony charge.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://animallaw.info/articles/ovusstatedogfightingchart.htm |title=Chart of State Dogfighting Laws |author=Hanna Gibson |year=2010 |publisher=animallaw.info}}&lt;/ref&gt;	Due to a loophole it is legal in 49 out of 50 states to possess dogs for fighting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.humanesociety.org/assets/pdfs/legislation/dogfighting_chart.pdf |accessdate=February 8, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130119040205/http://www.humanesociety.org/assets/pdfs/legislation/dogfighting_chart.pdf |archivedate=January 19, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Animal Fighting Spectator Prohibition Act closed the loophole that allowed people to knowingly attend dogfighting events.

In all states, it is against the law (and often a felony) even to attend a dog fighting event, regardless of direct participation. According to authorities, dog fighting is increasingly practiced by gangs, and is linked to other unlawful activities, such as illegal gambling.&lt;ref name="HSUS fact sheet"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hsus.org/hsus_field/animal_fighting_the_final_round/dogfighting_fact_sheet/ |title=Dogfighting Fact Sheet |publisher=[[Humane Society of the United States]] |accessdate=2007-09-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927220340/http://www.hsus.org/hsus_field/animal_fighting_the_final_round/dogfighting_fact_sheet/ |archivedate=2007-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 7, 2014 President Obama signed the Farm Bill which contained the U.S. H.R. 366/S. 666—Animal Fighting Spectator Prohibition Act. "The final bill includes a provision making it a federal crime to attend or bring a child under the age of 16 to an animal fighting event[.]" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=HSLF |url=http://www.humanesociety.org/news/news_briefs/2014/02/farm_bill_passed_020414.html#.UvYDYk7TnIV |title=Farm Bill Strengthens Animal Fighting Law, Maintains State Farm Animal Protection Laws : The Humane Society of the United States |publisher=Humanesociety.org |date= |accessdate=2014-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The Animal Fighting Spectator Prohibition Act would make it a federal offense to knowingly attend an organized animal fight and would impose additional penalties for bringing children to animal fights. Violators would face up to one year in prison for attending a fight, and up to three years in prison for bringing a minor to a fight." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.capwiz.com/aspca/issues/alert/?alertid=62350826&amp;type=CO&amp;from=advocacycenterlanding |title=USA: Attending an Animal Fight Now a Federal Crime! |publisher=Capwiz.com |date= |accessdate=2014-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Breed specific legislation===
Even though it is illegal, dog fighting still occurs across the globe. To combat dog fighting and curb ownership of "dangerous dogs," [[Breed Specific Legislation]] (BSL) has been passed in some countries, as well as in some local and regional jurisdictions. However, opponents argue that BSL affects responsible pet owners more than those who keep dogs for fighting purposes. Even though Breed Specific Legislation (BSL) is to keep tough dogs out of some states, many people have had problems with it and have started Petitions and held events to get rid of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stopbsl.com/ |title=Intro |publisher=StopBSL.com |date= |accessdate=2014-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stopbsl.com/bsldiscussion.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070912085426/http://www.stopbsl.com/bsldiscussion.htm |date=September 12, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Federal law effective May 2007===
In May 2007, a new Federal law went into effect making interstate dog fighting activities felonious and providing for imprisonment and imposition of large fines. The [[Animal Fighting Prohibition Enforcement Act]], a new Federal law sponsored by US Senators [[Arlen Specter]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|D]]-[[Pennsylvania|PA.]]), [[Dianne Feinstein]] (D-[[California|CA.]]), and [[John Ensign]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|R]]-[[Nevada|NV.]]), was enacted by the [[U.S. Congress]] earlier in 2007 and signed by President [[George W. Bush]] on May 3, making organizing a dog fight a felony. The law provides a penalty of up to three years of imprisonment and up to a $250,000 fine for each offense of interstate or foreign transport of animals for fighting purposes. Using the provisions of the new law, which took effect immediately, the Office of the Inspector General (OIG) of the [[U.S. Department of Agriculture]] (USDA) is pursuing cases in a number of locations around the country with considerable support from humane societies and local police departments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Lester Munson |title=Federal involvement is not good news for Vick |publisher=ESPN |date=2007-06-15 |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=2905920 |accessdate=2007-07-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nhes.org/articles.asp?article_id=476&amp;section_id=83 |title=?}}{{dead link|date=October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Widespread links to gangs, other criminal activities===
The United States Humane Society estimates that more than 40,000 people across the country buy and sell fighting dogs and are involved in dogfighting activities. But authorities say those in dogfighting circles also are involved in a number of other crimes, including [[narcotics trafficking]], [[illegal gambling]] and [[murder]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.buffalonews.com/home/story/115020.html ]{{dead link|date=October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2006, a suspected dog fighter in [[Texas]] bled to death after he was shot by intruders who apparently intended to torture him into revealing where he had hidden $100,000 wagered in a high-stakes dog match.&lt;ref name="Burke Virginian-Pilot"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://content.hamptonroads.com/story.cfm?story=126838&amp;ran=241086 |title=Once limited to the rural South, dogfighting sees a cultural shift |first=Bill |last=Burke |publisher=''[[The Virginian-Pilot]]'' |date=2007-06-17 |accessdate=2007-09-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926235159/http://content.hamptonroads.com/story.cfm?story=126838&amp;ran=241086 |archivedate=2007-09-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' reported that an analysis during a study by the College of Law at [[Michigan State University]] found that, in more than two dozen raids on dogfights, in virtually every instance police also seized illegal narcotics and weapons.&lt;ref name="Sun-Times sick hipness"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.suntimes.com/news/otherviews/431143,CST-CONT-dog17.article |title=The sick hipness of dog fighting |first=Steve |last=Malanga |publisher=''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' |date=2007-06-17 |accessdate=2007-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Police seized $250,000 in cash during another 2004 raid in [[Covington, Georgia]]. "Law enforcement is realizing it's a real community problem, intertwined with other crimes such as drugs and gambling," John Goodwin, an official with the Humane Society stated in an interview for the [[Norfolk, Virginia|Norfolk]] ''[[The Virginian-Pilot|Virginian-Pilot]]'' newspaper published in June 2007.

Many communities in widespread areas across the United States are aggressively targeting dog fighting by coordinating local and regional dog fighting task forces.&lt;ref name="Animal Law Overview"/&gt; "It's clear that when you have dogfighting, drugs and [[gambling]] and other criminal subcultures follow," according to Mark Plowden, a spokesman for the [[South Carolina]] Attorney General's Office, which in 2004 created a dogfighting task force.&lt;ref name="Burke Virginian-Pilot"/&gt; In [[Chicago|Chicago, Illinois]], a special police unit is devoted to investigating cases of abuse due to the connection between dog fighting and other gang crimes. In 2005, the police in [[Los Angeles, California]] formed an Animal Cruelty Task Force, leading to prosecutions of gang members there for animal abuse.&lt;ref name="Sun-Times sick hipness"/&gt;

===Professional athletes, entertainers===

Former [[Dallas Cowboys]] lineman [[Nate Newton]] was arrested at a dogfight in Texas, although charges were later dropped.&lt;ref name="Sun-Times sick hipness"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Palm Beach Post"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.palmbeachpost.com/sports/content/sports/epaper/2007/06/03/a1b_dogfight_603.html |title=Vicious fight: World of dogfighting seems to be growing despite awareness of its cruel side |first=Carlos |last=Frias |publisher=''[[Palm Beach Post]]'' |date=2007-06-03 |accessdate=2007-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, NFL quarterback [[Michael Vick]] is linked to property in southeastern [[Virginia]] where authorities believe a multi-state dog fighting operation was based. In an interview with [[WAVY-TV]], [[Portsmouth, Virginia]], [[Washington Redskins]] running back [[Clinton Portis]] and a teammate, offensive tackle [[Chris Samuels]], defended Vick. Portis said that if Vick is charged and convicted of dog fighting, "then you're putting him behind bars for no reason. I don't know if he was fighting dogs or not, but it's his property. It's his dog. If that's what he wants to do, do it." Those comments were sharply criticized by NFL Commissioner [[Roger Goodell]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/18783681/ Goodell blasts Portis' dog-fighting comments - NFL - MSNBC.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070603103035/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/18783681/ |date=June 3, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Redskins and Portis himself later apologized, stating that his controversial remarks about dog fighting were insensitive and that he now realizes he "shouldn't have made the comments." He added, "At that time I had no idea the love people have for animals, and I didn't consider it when I made those comments."
&lt;ref name=Portis&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/05/AR2007060501632.html |title=Portis Recants Words About Dogfighting |first=Jason |last=La Canfora |publisher=''[[The Washington Post]]'' |date=2007-06-06 |accessdate=2007-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New York Animal Control Officer Kleinfelder says, "For pro athletes, it's not about the money.... Instead of boxers just beating up on each other, they want to see it go to the death, and with dogs they can let it go that far. To them, dogs are expendable."&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

Rhonda Evans is a sociologist and associate professor in the department of criminal justice at the [[University of Louisiana at Lafayette]] who has published four academic articles on dog fighting. She stated in a story published by the ''[[Palm Beach Post]]'' that she had found that owners of high-dollar fighting dogs spanned all walks of life and social classes, with a common link of "a machismo mentality." Evans said "For them, tough dogs are a symbol of manhood... and by winning, the dogs build up their owners' ego. They see it as a valid, legitimate sport that is no worse than boxing or football."&lt;ref name="Palm Beach Post"/&gt;

[[Rap music|Rap]] and other urban music also seem to glorify dog fighting. [[Jay-Z]] shows dogs being prepared for a fight in the uncensored version of his music video, ''99 Problems''. A powerful-looking pit bull is on the cover of a CD by rapper [[DMX (rapper)|DMX]] that is titled ''[[Grand Champ]]''. "Grand Champ" is said to be a reference to a dog that has won five dogfights.

Madison Avenue advertising firms have capitalized on the same theme. When [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] was criticized about an ad featuring a growling pit bull and [[Rottweiler]] about to face off, the company denied the ad encourages dog fighting. The representative went on to state, however, "People have to understand the youth culture we cater to. Our market is the urban, edgy, [[hip-hop music|hip-hop]] culture."&lt;ref name="Sun-Times sick hipness"/&gt;

===Athletes speak out against dog fighting===
[[International Boxing Federation]] Champion [[Steve Cunningham]]: "Dogs are truly Man's best friend. Yet some people take advantage of their loyalty by forcing them into dog fighting. It's disgusting and a heinous thing to do. It must be stopped. So join me in Knocking Out Dog Fighting."&lt;ref name="KnockOut"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.knockoutdogfighting.org |title=Knock Out Dog Fighting Public Service Announcements |publisher=Knockoutdogfighting.org |date= |accessdate=2014-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mixed Martial Arts Champion [[Tito Ortiz]]: "Animal abuse happens every day in the form of dog fighting. It's cruel, inhumane, and it needs to be stopped. Show your strength and join me, Tito Ortiz, The Huntington Beach Bad Boy, in Knocking Out Dog Fighting."&lt;ref name="KnockOut"/&gt;

Mixed Martial Arts Champion [[Andrei Arlovski]]: "The pit bull has a long history in America. In the early 1900s the U.S. proudly used pit bulls on WWI posters to symbolize qualities that make up America - friendly, courageous, hard working and worthy of respect. I chose my name because I admire the breed for the same reasons. When I hear about pit bulls being used in dog fighting, it makes me angry. I have a choice to step into the cage to fight, but these dogs have no choice. Dog fighting is morally wrong and inhumane. In my opinion it's torture. Please join me in Knocking Out Dog Fighting."&lt;ref name="KnockOut"/&gt;

Mixed Martial Arts Champion [[Cung Le]]: "Dog fighting is cruel and inhumane and those who engage in it are losers. Show your strength and join me in Knocking Out Dog Fighting."&lt;ref name="KnockOut"/&gt;

Mixed Martial Arts Champion [[Josh Thomson]]: "Torturing or abusing animals is not cool nor is it a sign of strength. Real fighters stand up for what is right to protect those less able to do so. Show your strength and join me in Knocking Out Dog Fighting."&lt;ref name="KnockOut"/&gt;

Mixed Martial Arts Champion [[Rob McCullough]]: "I choose to fight, but a lot of dogs don't get that choice. Knock Out Dog Fighting...cuz dog fighting is not cool."&lt;ref name="KnockOut"/&gt;

===Increased enforcement, penalty===
In recent times, a combination of animal rights groups and law enforcement agencies have drawn new attention to dog fighting and related criminal activities in the United States. A story in the [[New York Daily News|New York ''Daily News'']] published on June 10, 2007, stated "dog fighting is a multi-million-dollar industry that is part of an underground subculture that holds its events in secret locations. It is extremely difficult for authorities to prove who has dogs for fighting purposes." A few weeks later, in [[Buffalo, New York]], police and animal control officers at the City of Buffalo Animal Shelter rescued 15 [[pit bull]]s believed to be part of dogfighting activities during a two-week period. Authorities found pit bulls — dead and alive — as well as "dogfighting kits", which include harnesses, muzzles, pre-fight training guides, stacks of breeding papers, and even videos on dogfighting. "We have been back to the same house three different times, and each time we pull out more and more dogs," said Animal Control Officer Andrew Kleinfelder. "Even when someone is arrested, a normal pit bull fighting ring has at least 30 people involved. Someone keeps the fights going."&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

Recently, longer sentences have resulted in some dog fighting-related cases.  In South Carolina, [[David Tant]], breeder of fighting dogs, is serving a 30-year sentence, among the stiffest ever imposed for the crime. Tant, 63, formerly of the Charleston area, pleaded guilty in November 2004 to more than 40 counts of illegally breeding fighting dogs, and one assault count connected to a surveyor who was wounded by a booby trap after he wandered onto Tant’s property in southern Charleston County. The surveyor was showered by an explosion of birdshot, injuring him slightly. The device was described as a "directional mine" meant to ward off intruders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.postandcourier.com/news/2010/jun/14/breeder-of-fighting-dogs-seeks-parole/ |title=Update: Tant's parole hearing postponed |author=Schuyler Kropf |date=June 14, 2010|newspaper=The µPost and Courier}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Reynolds (publisher)|"Fat Bill" Reynolds]] of [[Henry County, Virginia]] near [[Martinsville, Virginia|Martinsville]], publisher of ''American Gamedog Times'', a dog fighting magazine with an Internet website, was convicted in 2001 of transmitting images of fighting dogs across state lines and sentenced to 30 months in prison.&lt;ref name="Burke Virginian-Pilot"/&gt;

===Major recent incidents===

====March 2007 Dayton Ohio====
In March 2007, a combined Federal, state and local law enforcement team disrupted a large dog fighting network in [[Dayton, Ohio]] which was operating in Ohio, [[Kentucky]], and [[Michigan]]. The investigation of the operation based in [[Montgomery County, Ohio]] had lasted a year. More than two dozen arrests were made and more than 60 dogs were seized. In May, 7 persons in Ohio submitted guilty pleas to state charges. Sentencing was pending at the time of a USDA news release in June 2007.&lt;ref name="HSUS Ohio release"&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.hsus.org/press_and_publications/press_releases/massive_law_enforcement_raid.html |title=Massive Law Enforcement Raid Targets Ohio Dog Fighting Network |publisher=Humane Society of the United States |date=2007-03-25 |accessdate=2007-09-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927220451/http://www.hsus.org/press_and_publications/press_releases/massive_law_enforcement_raid.html |archivedate=2007-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usda.gov/oig/webdocs/InvPosting070601.pdf |title=Investigation of Multi-State Dog Fighting Enterprise Yields Currency, Illegal Drugs, and Firearms |date=June 1, 2007|author=Office of Inspector General, USDA Investigation Developments |publisher=USDA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====April 2007 Pass Christian, Mississippi====
On April 24, authorities in [[Pass Christian, Mississippi]] raided a large dog fighting training compound owned by [[Maxwell Landry]]. According to several news stories on local television station [[WLOX]], 17 persons were arrested and fighting dogs from [[Louisiana]], [[crack cocaine]] and several other illicit drugs were found at the scene and confiscated. 44 pit bulls were seized. Landry once lived in [[Chalmette, Louisiana]]. After the area was damaged as a result of [[Hurricane Katrina]] in 2005, he moved to the [[Harrison County, Mississippi]] site, located about {{convert|8|mi|km}} north of [[Interstate 10]]. Federal agents with the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA) discovered the dogs and the training compound during aerial surveillance relating to an investigation of drug trafficking.

Members of the Louisiana [[Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals]] came to help take care of the dogs. Property owner Landry was one of 14 people named in a Federal drug trafficking indictment involving activity between Mississippi, Louisiana and [[South Carolina]]. He faces to 43 counts of illegal dog fighting in Harrison County.

John Wesley Black and Constance Jean Courtney could spend a minimum of one year in prison per illegal dog fighting charge, and are linked to two dog fighting allegations. Courtney was employed as a [[veterinarian]]'s assistant. According to Harrison County Prosecutor [[Herman Cox]], Landry has confessed to investigators that he made about $5,000 a month fighting his dogs against other dogs.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

====April 2007 Surry, Virginia====
{{main article|Bad Newz Kennels dog fighting investigation}}
On April 25, 2007, an investigation began in [[Virginia]] after evidence of a dog fighting ring turned up during a narcotics search of a {{convert|15|acre|m2|sing=on}} home and property owned by [[Michael Vick]], a professional football player with the [[Atlanta Falcons]] of the [[NFL]] and a dog breeder. The property is located in southeastern [[Surry County, Virginia|Surry County]] a few miles northwest of the [[Isle of Wight County, Virginia|Isle of Wight County]] town of Smithfield. The original search began following several narcotics arrests of 26-year-old Davon T. Boddie, Vick's cousin and cook, who had given authorities the address of Vick's property at 1915 Moonlight Road, [[Surry, Virginia]] as his home address when he was arrested.

The investigation eventually involved local, state and Federal authorities. In late April, Vick told ''[[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution]]'' "I'm never at the house…I left the house with my family…They just haven't been doing the right thing…It's unfortunate I have to take the heat behind it. If I'm not there, I don't know what's going on."&lt;ref name="No Knowledge"&gt;{{cite web |title=UPDATE - Vick claims no knowledge of situation on his property |publisher=WAVY-TV |date=2007-03-28 |url=http://www.wavy.com/Global/story.asp?S=6428206 |accessdate=2007-07-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 2, agents of the [[U.S. Department of Agriculture]] (USDA) filed court documents describing a five-year operation of an interstate dog fighting ring which called itself "[[Bad Newz Kennels dog fighting investigation|Bad Newz Kennels]]" and had been based at Vick's property. No one was named individually in the July 2 court papers. [[WAVY-TV]] ([[Portsmouth, Virginia]]) posted a copy of one of the Federal court document from July 2, and has made it available online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wavy.com/Global/link.asp?L=253800|title=WAVY-TV online copy of July 2 document obtained under Freedom of Information request about the "Bad Newz Kennels" interstate dog fighting investigation|publisher=|accessdate=29 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 17, Vick and three men described as his employees were indicted by a Federal grand jury for "conspiracy to travel in interstate commerce in aid of unlawful activities and to sponsor a dog in animal fighting venture".&lt;ref name="indictmentespn"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=2940065|title=Falcons' Vick indicted by grand jury in dogfighting probe|date=2007-07-17|accessdate=2007-07-07|publisher=ESPN}}&lt;/ref&gt; They faced $350,000 in fines and six years in prison if convicted of the Federal felony and misdemeanor charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/07/17/sportsline/main3067633.shtml | work=CBS News | title=Michael Vick Indicted By Grand Jury | date=2007-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Details in the indictments describing extreme acts of brutality against losing and under-performing dogs included executions by electrocution, hanging, drowning, shooting, and blunt force resulted in widespread public protests and calls for Vick's removal from NFL play pending resolution by a diverse spectrum of notable persons and public officials. On July 23, Commissioner [[Roger Goodell]] suspended him for an indefinite period pending investigation of possible violations of the league's Personal Conduct Policy. Atlanta Falcons team owner [[Arthur Blank]] stated that Vick should give up thoughts of playing until the case is resolved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=2950226 |title=ESPN - Judge orders Vick's conditional release - NFL |publisher=Sports.espn.go.com |date=2007-07-26 |accessdate=2014-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An arraignment and detention hearing was held on July 26 in U.S. District Court in Richmond. A trial date was set for November 26, and all four defendants were released without bond, but under the direct supervision of the court and under certain conditions. Federal prosecutors stated they would file a superseded indictment in August, which could have included additional charges and/or defendants. According to the Code of Virginia at the time, various violations of the Virginia laws involving dog fighting and cruelty to companion animals &lt;ref name="VA Code"&gt;Code of Virginia, [https://web.archive.org/web/20010413153024/http://leg1.state.va.us/cgi-bin/legp504.exe?000%20cod%203.1-796.124 § 3.1-796.124] (2003).&lt;/ref&gt; were considered class 6 [[felony]] crimes, each carrying a fine and 1 to 5 years in prison per offense. Over fifty dogs were seized, in addition to carcasses recovered during several searches of Vick's property.

On August 24, Vick plead guilty. He joined three others who had also plead guilty earlier to similar charges. The four faced up to five years in prison, fines of up to $250,000 and restitution. Each received sentences ranging from 60 days to 23 months.

====June 2007 Richmond, Virginia====
In June 2007, a circuit court judge in [[Richmond, Virginia]] imposed a four-year prison sentence and $20,000 in fines on 40-year-old Stacey A. Miller, an Army veteran and convicted dog fighter. The ''[[Richmond Times-Dispatch]]'' reported that Miller was convicted in January by a jury of felony dogfighting, two counts of felony animal cruelty, a dozen counts of misdemeanor animal cruelty and two counts of possessing steroids. The jury recommended the four-year sentence and $20,000 in fines that the judge imposed. Miller also was ordered to pay Richmond Animal Care and Control $26,205.29 in restitution for the cost of caring for the 15 American pit bull terriers that were seized from him in February 2006, 12 of which had to be euthanized.&lt;ref name="Richmond sentence"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dogfighting"/&gt;

====July 2007 South Holland, Illinois====
On July 13, 2007, police in a suburb of [[Chicago, Illinois]] rescued 37 fighting dogs from a heavily insulated and ventilated old chicken coop behind a house in the village of [[South Holland, Illinois|South Holland]]. At a news conference, [[Cook County, Illinois|Cook County]] Sheriff [[Tom Dart]] stated that it was "the largest seizure of fighting dogs in state history."

According to the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', an investigation began in May after police were informed that fighting dogs were being bred and raised at the home. Two workers for an animal shelter said that they had tipped off police. Officials close to the investigation confirmed their role. Neighbors told the news media that they had also called police to complain about barking from the barn and what was described as "a stench" by several. One neighbor said that he had called police several months ago after seeing a dog chained in the yard on a hot day without water. Another neighbor who lives across the street told reporters that he began seeing police in unmarked cars watching the home several weeks earlier, and one investigator had interviewed him about a week before the raid. The ''Tribune'' reported that the neighbor said that he told the investigator "...the place was like a gas station, people coming and going constantly at night...I thought maybe he was dealing drugs."

Executing a warrant, a team formed by the [[Cook County, Illinois|Cook County]] sheriff's police special operations unit, Cook County animal control, and the South Holland Police Department entered the property and the soundproofed barn, seizing the dogs and evidence. They also found a boa constrictor snake and a substance suspected of being [[crack cocaine]] inside of the home, according to a [[WLS-TV]] (Chicago) news report.

The ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' reported that the site had "all the makings of a sophisticated and professional dog fighting operation." It was noted that treadmills and weights were nearby for building strength, while a female dog was kept in a separate room where breeding was done. Drugs used to make them stronger and fight harder were also found. One of the dogs, larger than the pit bulls and described as "urine-soaked" with its hair falling out, was thought to be a "bait dog" used in training others.

[[WBBM (AM)|WBBM]] radio news reported that the dogs seized in the raid ranged from weeks-old puppies to older dogs, some of whom suffered from physical injuries. Officers wore industrial masks Friday as they rescued the dogs, which were kept in [[pet shipping|pet transport]] carriers in the barn and positioned in a way that restricted sunlight. Several of the carriers had bite marks around their openings. Dart described the conditions inside the barn as horrible. "It's very difficult to breathe inside," he said. "The smell is overwhelming, and the conditions are deplorable."

Sheriff Dart said it was clear that the 29-year-old homeowner was an active ringleader on the dog-fighting circuit, breeding fighting dogs while renting out others for matches and raking in hundreds of dollars each time. Kevin Taylor was known to authorities. He has two prior convictions related to dog fighting, including cruelty to animals. He was convicted On June 15, 2007 in [[Livingston County, Illinois|Livingston County]] after being arrested for attending dog fights near [[Pontiac, Illinois|Pontiac]] in September 2005. According to news reports, a Livingston County jury convicted Taylor on a Class C misdemeanor charge. He paid a fine of $1,275 and spent six days in jail, a total that counts his initial arrest and subsequent arrests on bench warrants after he failed to show for court dates.

On July 14, Taylor was charged with 37 misdemeanor counts of cruelty to animals, a felony count of possession of a controlled substance, a felony count of dog-fighting and two other misdemeanor charges, one count each of possession of dogs by a felon and owning sport fighting dogs. Sheriff Dart said that although Taylor is thought to have bred and trained the dogs to sell or rent there, evidence did not indicate that any dogfights took place at the South Holland location. On July 16, Cook County Circuit Judge Camille Willis set Taylor's bond at $100,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/chi-070713dogsjul13,1,344855.story?coll=chi-news-hed | work=Chicago Tribune | title=Watch dog | date=2009-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sun-Times South Holland"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.suntimes.com/news/metro/468221,CST-NWS-dogs14.article |title=37 fighting dogs seized, many hurt |first=Steve |last=Patterson |publisher=''Chicago Sun-Times'' |date=2007-07-14 |accessdate=2007-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WLS20070713&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abclocal.go.com/wls/story?section=local&amp;id=5478525 |title=Dog fighting ring broken up |first=Stacey |last=Baca |publisher=[[WLS-TV]] |date=2007-07-13 |accessdate=2007-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wbbm780.com/pages/683153.php?contentType=4&amp;contentId=690469 WBBM 780 - Chicago's #1 source for local news, traffic and weather - Sheriff Says Seizure Of Fighting Dogs Largest In Illinois History]{{dead link|date=July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Keller&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nwitimes.com/articles/2007/07/14/news/top_news/doc537edc9052fd442d86257318000ceefc.txt |title=Cops break up fighting dog site |first=Chris |last=Keller |publisher=''The Times'' ([[Munster, Indiana]]) |date=2007-07-14 |accessdate=2007-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/chi-dogs_14jul14,1,3558706.story?coll=chi-newsnationworld-hed | work=Chicago Tribune | title=Topic Galleries - chicagotribune.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WLS20070714&gt;{{cite web|url= http://abclocal.go.com/wls/story?section=local&amp;id=5479174 |title=Man charged in South Holland dog-fighting operation |first=Stacey |last=Baca |publisher=WLS-TV |date=2007-07-14 |accessdate=2007-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wbbm780.com/pages/689130.php?contentType=4&amp;contentId=695462 WBBM 780 - Chicago's #1 source for local news, traffic and weather - $100K Bond For Man Charged In Dog-Fighting Operation]{{dead link|date=July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sun-Times 41 charges"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.suntimes.com/news/metro/471004,CST-NWS-dogs17.article |title='They think it's cool': 41 dog-fighting charges |first=Steve |last=Patterson |publisher=''Chicago Sun-Times'' |date=2007-07-17 |accessdate=2007-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==U.S. Senators speak out==
On July 19, 2007, U.S. Senator [[Robert Byrd]], 89, of [[West Virginia]], a well-known dog lover, gave a passionate speech in the [[U.S. Congress]] about the practice of dog fighting in response to the indictment of football player [[Michael Vick]]. Senator Byrd stated:

{{cquote|Dog fighting is a brutal, sadistic event motivated by barbarism of the worst sort and cruelty of the worst, worst, worst sadistic kind. One is left wondering, who are the real animals... the creatures inside the ring, or the creatures outside the ring.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Speech of Senator Robert Byrd following the Indictment of Michael Vick on Dog-fighting Charges|"Speech of Senator Robert Byrd following the Indictment of Michael Vick on Dog-fighting Charges."]]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The following day, Senator [[John Kerry]] of [[Massachusetts]] said he had sent a letter to the NFL commissioner calling for Vick's immediate suspension. Kerry wrote to Commissioner [[Roger Goodell]]:

{{cquote|Dogfighting is one of society's most barbaric and inhumane activities.}}

Kerry, the 2004 Democratic presidential nominee, also said he planned to introduce anti-dogfighting legislation. According to his office, Senator Kerry's proposal would make it illegal to transmit images of dogfighting, to run Web sites that cater to dogfighting, and to own or train dogs for the purpose of fighting under Federal laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/US/07/20/vick.dogfighting/?iref=mpstoryview |title=Vick dogfighting charges stir stinging reaction - CNN.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070820190151/http://www.cnn.com/2007/US/07/20/vick.dogfighting/?iref=mpstoryview |archivedate=August 20, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Farm Debt Review Act'''''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite canlaw|short title  =Farm Debt Review Act|abbr =S.C.|year =1986|chapter = 33|link= https://archive.org/stream/actsofparl1986v02cana#page/n15/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang-fr|Loi sur l'examen de l'endettement agricole}}) was an Act of the [[Parliament of Canada]] dealing with the [[farm crisis]] affecting Canadian agriculture in the 1980s. It was in force from 1986 to 1998.

==Background==
Farm credit increased significantly in the late 1970s as Canadian farmers expanded their operations to meet greater world demand with expectations of continuing high commodity prices for their production.&lt;ref name="HansardJW1986"&gt;{{cite hansard |jurisdiction= Canada|title= Farm Debt Review Act|url= http://parl.canadiana.ca/view/oop.debates_HOC3301_10/952?r=0&amp;s=1|house= House of Commons|date= 20 June 1986|page_start= 14787|page_end= 14790|speaker= [[John Wise (Ontario)|John Wise]]|position=Minister of Agriculture}}, at p. 14788&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1980s, prices collapsed, and annual interest rates suddenly rose from 10% to as high as 24%.&lt;ref name="HansardJW1986"/&gt; Similar, but more severe, conditions had been previously encountered during the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s.{{efn|for which the ''[[Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act]]'' was passed to deal with the situation}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www5.agr.gc.ca/resources/prod/doc/prod/pdf/fdms-smmea_1_e.pdf|title= Report to Parliament on the ''Farm Debt Mediation Act'', Farm Debt Mediation Service and Farm Consultation Service|last= Mitchell|first= Andy|author-link= Andy Mitchell (politician)|date= May 2005|publisher= [[Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1985, a moratorium had been placed on all [[foreclosure]] actions by the [[Farm Credit Corporation]].&lt;ref&gt;John Wise, ''Hansard'', p. 14789&lt;/ref&gt; To provide debt relief on a nationwide basis, the Act was introduced in June 1986, and received [[Royal Assent]] later that month.

==Framework==
===Scope===
The Act's scope was broad, as noted in its definitions:&lt;ref&gt;FDRA, s. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

:* a "farmer" included any individual or entity engaged in farming
:* "farming" included the production or raising of any animal or thing on a farm
:* an "Insolvent farmer" meant any farmer who could not meet obligations as they came due, had ceased paying current obligations in the ordinary course of business as they came due, or whose property (valued either at [[fair market value]] or at a value obtained at a fairly conducted sale under legal process) is insufficient to enable payment of all obligations, due and accruing due
:* farmers who were not insolvent, but were in financial difficulty, also came within certain provisions of the Act&lt;ref name="FDRA16"&gt;FDRA, ss. 16-19&lt;/ref&gt;

Its aim was to "help farmers with the potential to be viable and remain in business."&lt;ref&gt;John Wise, ''Hansard'', p. 14790&lt;/ref&gt; The significance of its framework was later described thus by one commentator:

{{cquote|
The Act is significant in that it is based on creditors and applicant farmers coming to a voluntary arrangement.... The government has recognized that many insolvent farmers must leave the industry and that only commercially-viable farmers will be assisted by this Act. All applicants are provided with an opportunity to receive third-party expert advice on these financial affairs and relationships with their creditors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Farlinger|first1= B.|date= 1988|title= The Farm Debt Review Act|url= |journal= Banking and Finance Law Review|volume= 2|issue= |pages= 223|issn= 0832-8722}}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}
===Operation===
The Act's operation was conducted in a decentralized manner:

:* Farm Debt Review Boards were established for each province, or a region of a province, and each Board had power to appoint experts and establish review panels to help in their functions&lt;ref&gt;FDRA, ss. 4-15&lt;/ref&gt;
:* farmers in financial difficulty were able to have a review panel either review his financial affairs or assist him in facilitating an arrangement with his creditors&lt;ref name="FDRA16"/&gt;
:* insolvent farmers could apply to a Board for a review of his financial affairs and for a [[stay of proceedings]] against him by any of his creditors,&lt;ref&gt;FDRA, s. 20&lt;/ref&gt; following which a review panel would be appointed to facilitate an arrangement between the farmer and the creditors&lt;ref&gt;FDRA, s. 28&lt;/ref&gt; which would be administered by a [[trustee in bankruptcy|licensed trustee]]&lt;ref&gt;FDRA, s. 31&lt;/ref&gt;
:* insolvent farmers who had made an application would be barred from making another application during the following two years, unless written consent had been previously given by the Board&lt;ref&gt;FDRA, s. 33&lt;/ref&gt;
:* [[secured creditor]]s were required to give a notice of 15 [[business day]]s before realizing upon the security, and the notice had to advise the farmer of his right to apply for a stay of proceedings&lt;ref&gt;FDRA, s. 22&lt;/ref&gt;
:* the stay of proceedings was in effect for 30 days, and could be extended by the Board for a further three 30-day periods&lt;ref&gt;FDRA, ss. 23, 29&lt;/ref&gt;
:* the Board had to appoint a guardian for the farmer's assets (which could be the farmer), and such guardian was subject to any directions given by the Board&lt;ref&gt;FDRA, ss. 24-26&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact==
The Act protected [[hobby farmer]]s as well as commercial farmers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.coxandpalmerlaw.com/en/home/publications/tread-carefully-enforcement-of-farming-assets.aspx|title= Tread Carefully – Enforcement of Farming Assets|last= Howard|first= Ben|date= 23 May 2016|website= coxandpalmerlaw.com|publisher= Cox &amp; Palmer}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the stay of proceedings applied to all the farmer's assets, whether connected to the farm or not.{{efn|An Ontario agency noted that the property of a farmer included "not only farm property, but any other property owned by a farmer, such as a house in the city or property of another business carried on by the farmer."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://files.ontario.ca/87004.pdf|title= 87004: The Farm Debt Review Act, 1986|author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= 26 May 1987|website= ontario.ca|publisher= Ministry of Consumer and Commercial Relations}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} As well, a stay of proceedings under the Act voided any actions by a secured creditor, whether the stay was pleaded or not before a judge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CanLII|litigants=M &amp; D Farm Ltd v Manitoba Agricultural Credit Corp|link=|year=1999|court=scc|num=648|format=canlii|parallelcite=[1999] 2 SCR 961|date=1999-09-02|courtname=auto}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
The Act would be in effect until the coming into force of the ''[[Farm Debt Mediation Act]]'' in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite canlaw|short title  =Farm Debt Mediation Act|abbr =S.C.|year =1997|chapter = 21|link= https://archive.org/stream/actsofparl1997v02cana#page/n127/mode/2up}}, in force 1 April 1998: {{cite journal |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= 15 April 1998|title= SI 98/52: Order Fixing April 1, 1998 as the Date of the Coming into Force of the Farm Debt Mediation Act|url= http://gazette.gc.ca/rp-pr/p2/1998/1998-04-15/pdf/g2-13208.pdf|journal= [[Canada Gazette]], Part II|volume= 132|issue= 8|page= 1379 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fisheries management''' is the activity of protecting [[fishery]] resources so [[Sustainable fishery|sustainable exploitation]] is possible, drawing on [[fisheries science]], and including the [[precautionary principle]].  Modern fisheries management is often referred to as a governmental system of appropriate management rules based on defined objectives and a mix of management means to implement the rules, which are put in place by a system of [[monitoring control and surveillance]]. A popular approach is the ecosystem approach to fisheries management.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fao.org/3/a-y4773e.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The ecosystem approach to fisheries. Issues, terminology, principles, institutional foundations, implementation and outlook.|vauthors = Garcia SM, Zerbi A, Aliaume C, Do Chi T, Lasserre G|publisher=FAO|year=2003|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations]] (FAO), there are "no clear and generally accepted definitions of fisheries management".&lt;ref name=FAOFM&gt;FAO (1997) [http://www.fao.org/docrep/003/w4230e/w4230e05.htm Fisheries Management] Section 1.2, Technical Guidelines for Responsible Fisheries. FAO, Rome. {{ISBN|92-5-103962-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the working definition used by the FAO and much cited elsewhere is: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;The integrated process of information gathering, analysis, planning, consultation, decision-making, allocation of resources and formulation and implementation, with enforcement as necessary, of regulations or rules which govern fisheries activities in order to ensure the continued productivity of the resources and the accomplishment of other fisheries objectives.&lt;ref name=FAOFM /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==History==
Fisheries have been explicitly managed in some places for hundreds of years. More than 80 percent of the world's commercial exploitation of fish and shellfish are harvested from natural occurring populations in the oceans and freshwater areas.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;u&gt;Elements of Ecology&lt;/u&gt; - Thomas M. Smith, Robert Leo Smith&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the [[Māori people]], New Zealand residents for about 700 years, had prohibitions against taking more than what could be eaten and about giving back the first fish caught as an offering to sea god [[Tangaroa]].&lt;ref&gt;Meredith P (2009) [http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/te-hi-ika-maori-fishing/3 Te hī ika – Māori fishing - Traditional practices] ''Te Ara - the Encyclopedia of New Zealand''. Updated 2 March 2009. Retrieved 22 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in the 18th century attempts were made to regulate fishing in the [[Nord-Norge|North Norwegian]] fishery. This resulted in the enactment of a law in 1816 on the [[Lofoten]] fishery, which established in some measure what has come to be known as territorial use rights.&lt;ref&gt;Christy FT (1983) [http://www.fao.org/docrep/003/T0507E/T0507E00.htm ''Territorial Use Rights in Fisheries: Definitions and Conditions''] FAO Fisheries, Technical Paper No. 227, Rome. {{ISBN|978-92-5-101269-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The fishing banks were divided into areas belonging to the nearest fishing base on land and further subdivided into fields where the boats were allowed to fish. The allocation of the fishing fields was in the hands of local governing committees, usually headed by the owner of the onshore facilities which the fishermen had to rent for accommodation and for drying the fish."&lt;ref&gt;Hannesson R, Salvanes JG and Squires A (2008) [http://www.nhh.no/Files/Filer/institutter/sam/Discussion%20papers/2008/05.pdf "Technological change and the Tragedy of the Commons: The Lofoten Fishery over Hundred and Thirty Years"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724181724/http://www.nhh.no/Files/Filer/institutter/sam/Discussion%20papers/2008/05.pdf |date=24 July 2011 }} ''Institutt for Samfunnsøkonomi''. Discussion paper SAM 5 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Governmental resource protection-based fisheries management is a relatively new idea, first developed for North European fisheries after the first [[Overfishing]] Conference held in London in 1936. In 1957 British fisheries researchers [[Ray Beverton]] and [[Sidney Holt]] published a seminal work on [[North Sea]] commercial fisheries dynamics.&lt;ref name="Beverton and Holt, 1957"&gt;{{harvnb|Beverton|Holt|1957}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1960s the work became the theoretical platform for North European management schemes.

After some years away from the field of fisheries management, Beverton criticized his earlier work in a paper given at the first World Fisheries Congress in Athens in 1992. "The Dynamics of Exploited Fish Populations" expressed his concerns, including the way his and Sidney Holt's work had been misinterpreted and misused by fishery biologists and managers during the previous 30 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Beverton|1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the institutional foundation for modern fishery management had been laid.

In 1996, the [[Marine Stewardship Council]] was founded to set standards for [[sustainable fishing]]. In 2010, the [[Aquaculture Stewardship Council]] was created to do the same for [[aquaculture]].

A report by [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]]' International Sustainability Unit, the New York-based [[Environmental Defense Fund]] and 50in10 published in July 2014 estimated global fisheries were adding $270 billion a year to global GDP, but by full implementation of sustainable fishing, that figure could rise by  an extra amount of as much as $50 billion.&lt;ref name="GlobalFisheries"&gt;{{cite news|title=Prince Charles calls for greater sustainability in fisheries|url=http://www.londonmercury.com/index.php/sid/223769121/scat/415361b06433ee08/ht/Prince-Charles-calls-for-greater-sustainability-in-fisheries|accessdate=13 July 2014|publisher=''London Mercury''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political objectives==
According to the [[FAO]], fisheries management should be based explicitly on political objectives, ideally with transparent priorities.&lt;ref name="FAOGuidebook"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cochrane|first1=Kevern L.|last2=Garcia|first2=Serge M.|title=A Fishery Manager's Guidebook|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=wIEtBDxOxZUC|page=91}}|date=22 June 2009|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-4051-7085-7|pages=91–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typical political objectives when exploiting a fish resource are to:&lt;ref name=Duzgunes/&gt;
* [[maximum sustainable yield|maximize sustainable biomass yield]]
* [[optimum sustainable yield|maximize sustainable economic yield]]
* secure and increase employment
* secure protein production and food supplies
* increase export income

Such political goals can also be a weak part of fisheries management, since the objectives can conflict with each other.&lt;ref name=Duzgunes&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Duzgunes | first1 = E | last2 = Erdogan | first2 = N | year = 2008 | title = Fisheries Management in the Black Sea Countries | url = http://www.trjfas.org/pdf/issue_8_1/181_192.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Turkish Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences | volume = 8 | issue =  | pages = 181–192 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110726074655/http://www.trjfas.org/pdf/issue_8_1/181_192.pdf | archivedate = 26 July 2011 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International objectives==
Fisheries objectives need to be expressed in concrete management rules. In most countries fisheries management rules should be based on the internationally agreed, though non-binding, Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fao.org/fi/agreem/codecond/ficonde.asp Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries]&lt;/ref&gt; agreed at a meeting of the U.N.'s Food and Agriculture Organization [[FAO]] session in 1995. The [[precautionary principle|precautionary approach]] it prescribes is typically implemented in concrete management rules as minimum [[spawn (biology)|spawning]] [[Biomass (ecology)|biomass]], maximum fishing mortality rates, etc. In 2005 the [[UBC Fisheries Centre]] at the [[University of British Columbia]] comprehensively reviewed the performance of the world's major fishing nations against the Code.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pitcher|Kalikoski|Pramod|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

International agreements are required in order to regulate fisheries in international waters. The desire for agreement on this and other maritime issues led to three conferences on the Law of the Sea, and ultimately to the treaty known as the [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea]] (UNCLOS). Concepts such as [[exclusive economic zone]]s (EEZ, extending {{convert|200|nmi|km}} from a nation's coasts) allocate certain sovereign rights and responsibilities for resource management to individual countries.

Other situations need additional intergovernmental coordination. For example, in the Mediterranean Sea and other relatively narrow bodies of water, EEZ of {{convert|200|nmi|km}} are irrelevant.&lt;!--why?--&gt; International waters beyond {{convert|12|nmi|km|adj=on}} from shore require explicit agreements.

[[Straddling stocks|Straddling fish stocks]], which [[Fish migration|migrate]] through more than one EEZ also present challenges. Here sovereign responsibility must be agreed with neighbouring [[coastal states]] and fishing entities. Usually this is done through the medium of a regional organisation set up for the purpose of [[Straddling Fish Stocks Agreement|coordinating the management]] of that stock.

UNCLOS does not prescribe precisely how fisheries confined only to international waters should be managed. Several new fisheries (such as high seas [[bottom trawling]] fisheries) are not (yet) subject to international agreement across their entire range. In November 2004 the [[UN General Assembly]] issued a resolution on Fisheries that prepared for further development of international fisheries management law.

==Management mechanisms==
Many countries have set up Ministries/Government Departments, named "[[Ministry of Fisheries (New Zealand)|Ministry of Fisheries]]" or similar, controlling aspects of fisheries within their [[exclusive economic zones]].
Four categories of management means have been devised, regulating either input/investment, or output, and operating either directly or indirectly:

{|class=wikitable
!!!Inputs!!Outputs
|-
|Indirect
|Vessel licensing
|Catching techniques
|-
|Direct
|Limited entry
|[[IFQ|Catch quota]] and technical regulation
|}

Technical means may include:
* prohibiting devices such as bows and arrows, and spears, or firearms
* prohibiting nets
* setting minimum mesh sizes
* limiting the average potential catch of a vessel in the fleet (vessel and crew size, gear, electronic gear and other physical "inputs".&lt;ref&gt;Sustainable Fishery system, Charles, A. (ed) (2001). Oxford: Blackwell science. p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt;
* prohibiting bait
* snagging&lt;!--snagging?--&gt;
* limits on fish traps
* limiting the number of poles or lines per fisherman
* restricting the number of simultaneous fishing vessels
* limiting a vessel's average operational intensity per unit time at sea
* limiting average time at sea

==Catch quotas==
{{main|Individual transferable quota}}

Systems that use ''individual transferable quotas'' (ITQ), also called individual fishing quota limit the total catch and allocate shares of that quota among the fishers who work that fishery. Fishers can buy/sell/trade shares as they choose.

A large scale study in 2008 provided strong evidence that ITQ's can help to prevent fishery collapse and even restore fisheries that appear to be in decline.&lt;ref name=costello2008&gt;{{cite web

==Precautionary principle==
''A Fishery Manager's Guidebook'' issued in 2002 by the [[FAO]] advises that a set of working principles should be applied to "highlight the underlying key issues" of fisheries management."&lt;ref name=FAOGuidebook /&gt;{{rp|130}}&lt;ref name=FAO2002&gt;[[FAO]] (2002) [http://www.fao.org/docrep/005/y3427e/y3427e03.htm#bm03.3 A Fishery Manager's Guidebook - Management Measures and Their Application]. Rome. {{ISBN|92-5-104773-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; There are 8 principles that should be considered as a whole in order to best manage a fishery. The first principle focuses on the finite nature of fish stocks and how potential yields must be estimated based on the biological constraints of the population.

In a paper published in 2007, Shertzer and Prager suggested that there can be significant benefits to [[Fish stock|stock biomass]] and fishery yield if management is stricter and more prompt.&lt;ref&gt;Shertzer KW and Prager MH (2007) [http://icesjms.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/64/1/149 "Delay in fishery management: diminished yield, longer rebuilding, and increased probability of stock collapse"] ''ICES J. Mar. Sci.'' '''64''': 149–159.&lt;/ref&gt; This is supported by recent work on the management of North Sea fisheries in accordance with ranges of acceptable fishing, where fishing at the top of the "acceptable" ranges is many times more risky than fishing near the bottom, but delivers only 20% more yield.&lt;ref&gt;[https://academic.oup.com/icesjms/article-abstract/doi/10.1093/icesjms/fsx062/3787892/Risks-and-benefits-of-catching-pretty-good-yield?redirectedFrom=fulltext] ''ICES J. Mar. Sci.'': DOI 10.1093/icesjms/fsx062&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fisheries law==
{{main|Fisheries law}}

[[Fisheries law]] is an emerging and specialized area of law which includes the study and analysis of different fisheries management approaches, including seafood safety regulations and aquaculture regulations. Despite its importance, this area is rarely taught at law schools around the world, which leaves a vacuum of advocacy and research.

Fisheries legislation on a national level differs greatly between countries &lt;ref name=FAOGuidebook /&gt;{{rp|130}}&lt;ref name=FAO2002 /&gt; Fisheries may also me managed on an international level. One the first laws enacted was the "United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982 (LOS Convention)", which entered into force in 1994.&lt;ref name=FAOGuidebook /&gt;{{rp|130}}&lt;ref name=FAO2002 /&gt; This law set the foundation for all international agreements related to oceans that followed.

==Climate change==
{{main|Fisheries and climate change}}

In the past, changing [[climate]] has affected inland and offshore fisheries and such changes are likely to continue.&lt;ref&gt;Gucinski, Lackey, and Spence (1990)&lt;/ref&gt;  From a fisheries perspective, the specific driving factors of climate change include rising water temperature, alterations in the [[hydrologic cycle]], changes in nutrient fluxes, and relocation of [[spawning]] and nursery habitat.  Further, changes in such factors would affect resources at all levels of biological organization, including the genetic, organism, population, and [[ecosystem]] levels.&lt;ref&gt;Hlohowskyj, Brody, and Lackey, (1996)&lt;/ref&gt; Understanding how these factors affect fisheries at a more nuanced level stand as challenges that fish biologists, across multiple fields, still need to face.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2018|title=On the challenges and opportunities facing fish biology: a discussion of five key knowledge gaps|journal=Journal of Fish Biology|volume=92|issue=3|pages=690–698|doi=10.1111/jfb.13545|pmid=29537088|last1=Jacobs|first1=A.|last2=Doran|first2=C.|last3=Murray|first3=D.

==Population dynamics==
{{main|Population dynamics of fisheries}}

[[Population dynamics of fisheries|Population dynamics]] describes the growth and decline of a given fishery [[Fish stock|stock]] over time, as controlled by birth, death and migration. It is the basis for understanding changing fishery patterns and issues such as habitat destruction, predation and optimal harvesting rates. The population dynamics of fisheries has been traditionally used by [[Fisheries science|fisheries scientists]] to determine [[Sustainable yield in fisheries|sustainable yields]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilderbuera, Thomas K and Zhang, Chang Ik (1999) [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6T6N-3WDKGMG-7&amp;_user=10&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=a9c222a53c510d31b89d6ece311422be ''Evaluation of the population dynamics and yield characteristics of Alaska plaice, Pleuronectes quadrituberculatus, in the eastern Bering Sea.''] Fisheries Research.

The basic accounting relation for population dynamics is the [[Matrix population models|BIDE]] model:&lt;ref&gt;Caswell, H.  2001.  Matrix population models: Construction, analysis and interpretation, 2nd Edition.  Sinauer Associates, Sunderland, Massachusetts.  {{ISBN|0-87893-096-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

: ''N''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''N''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; + ''B'' − ''D'' + ''I'' − ''E''

where ''N''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is the number of individuals at time 1, ''N''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the number of individuals at time 0, ''B'' is the number of individuals born, ''D'' the number that died, ''I'' the number that immigrated, and ''E'' the number that emigrated between time 0 and time 1. While immigration and emigration can be present in [[Wild fisheries of the world|wild fisheries]], they are usually not measured.

Care is needed when applying population dynamics to real world fisheries. In the past, over-simplistic modelling, such as ignoring the size, age and reproductive status of the fish, focusing solely on a single species, ignoring [[bycatch]] and [[Environmental effects of fishing|physical damage]] to the ecosystem, has accelerated the collapse of key [[Fish stock|stocks]].&lt;ref name=Epitaph&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Larkin | first1 = PA | year = 1977 | title = An epitaph for the concept of maximum sustained yield | url = https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:0ZITmBnzlDUJ:fiesta.bren.ucsb.edu/~gsd/595e/docs/22.%2520Larkin_Epitaph_Max_Sust_Yield.pdf+Larkin+1977+%22An+epitaph+for+the+concept+of+maximum+sustained+yield%22&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=nz&amp;sig=AHIEtbSBFh-w5xzWiBK7rnHSLBmolsfaWA | journal = Transactions of the American Fisheries Society | volume = 106 | issue =  | pages = 1–11 | doi = 10.1577/1548-8659(1977)106&lt;1:AEFTCO&gt;2.0.CO;2 }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lessons&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Walters | first1 = C | authorlink = Carl Walters | last2 = Maguire | first2 = J | year = 1996 | title = Lessons for stock assessment from the northern cod collapse | url = | journal = Reviews in Fish Biology and Fisheries | volume = 6 | issue = 2| pages = 125–137 | doi=10.1007/bf00182340}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ecosystem based fisheries==
{{rquote|right|We propose that rebuilding ecosystems, and not sustainability per se, should be the goal of fishery management. Sustainability is a deceptive goal because human harvesting of fish leads to a progressive simplification of ecosystems in favour of smaller, high turnover, lower trophic level fish species that are adapted to withstand disturbance and habitat degradation.|[[Tony J. Pitcher|Tony Pitcher]] and [[Daniel Pauly]]&lt;ref&gt;Pitcher TJ and Pauly D (1998) [http://www.accordsdepeche.com/fichiers/docs/bibli_08/873.pdf "Rebuilding ecosystems, not sustainability, as the proper goal of fishery management"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513143826/http://www.accordsdepeche.com/fichiers/docs/bibli_08/873.pdf |date=13 May 2013 }} Pages 311-325 in T Pitcher, D Pauly and P Hart, ''Reinventing Fisheries Management'', Chapman &amp; Hall.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
{{See also|Ecosystem-based management}}

According to [[Marine ecology|marine ecologist]] Chris Frid, the [[fishing industry]] points to pollution and global warming as the causes of unprecedentedly low fish stocks in recent years, writing,  "Everybody would like to see the rebuilding of fish stocks and this can only be achieved if we understand all of the influences, human and natural, on fish dynamics." [[Overfishing]] has also had an effect. Frid adds, “Fish communities can be altered in a number of ways, for example they can decrease if particular sized individuals of a species are targeted, as this affects [[Population dynamics of fisheries#Predator-prey equations|predator and prey dynamics]]. Fishing, however, is not the sole perpetrator of changes to marine life - [[Marine pollution|pollution]] is another example [...] No one factor operates in isolation and components of the ecosystem respond differently to each individual factor."&lt;ref&gt;University of Liverpool (2006). [https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2006/02/060216233254.htm "Marine Ecologists To Help Rebuild Decreasing Fish Stocks"] ''ScienceDaily''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to the traditional approach of focusing on a single species, the [[Ecosystem Approach|ecosystem-based approach]] is organized in terms of [[ecosystem services]]. Ecosystem-based fishery concepts have been implemented in some regions.&lt;ref&gt;[[FAO]]: Fisheries governance: [http://www.fao.org/fishery/topic/13261/en The ecosystem approach to fisheries management] Rome.

==Elderly maternal fish==
[[File:Sebastes mystinus 2.jpg|thumb|right|Old, fat, female rockfish are the best producers.]]
Traditional management practices aim to reduce the number of old, slow-growing fish, leaving more room and resources for younger, faster-growing fish. Most marine fish produce huge numbers of eggs. The assumption was that younger spawners would produce plenty of viable [[larvae]].&lt;ref name="ASSS 2005"&gt;[[American Association for the Advancement of Science|AAAS]] (2005) [http://www.compassonline.org/pdf_files/PR_2005_2_19a.pdf ''New Science Sheds Light on Rebuilding Fisheries''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217092613/http://www.compassonline.org/pdf_files/PR_2005_2_19a.pdf |date=17 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, 2005 research on [[Sebastes|rockfish]] shows that large, elderly females are far more important than younger fish in maintaining productive fisheries. The larvae produced by these older maternal fish grow faster, survive starvation better, and are much more likely to survive than the offspring of younger fish. Failure to account for the role of older fish may help explain recent collapses of some major US West Coast fisheries. Recovery of some stocks is expected to take decades. One way to prevent such collapses is to establish marine reserves, where fishing is not allowed and fish populations age naturally.&lt;ref name="ASSS 2005"/&gt;

==Data quality==
According to fisheries scientist Milo Adkison, the primary limitation in fisheries management decisions is the absence of quality data. Fisheries management decisions are often based on population models, but the models need quality data to be effective. He asserts that scientists and fishery managers would be better served with simpler models and improved data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[University of Alaska Fairbanks]] |year=2007 |url=http://www.sfos.uaf.edu/news/story/?ni=184 |title=Adkison advocates increased fisheries data gathering |access-date=14 November 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070711045411/http://www.sfos.uaf.edu/news/story/?ni=184 |archive-date=11 July 2007 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most reliable source for summary statistics is the [[FAO]] Fisheries Department.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fao.org/DOCREP/FIELD/006/Y3354M/Y3354M00.HTM Fishery statistics: Reliability and policy implications]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ecopath==
[[Ecopath]], with [[Ecosim]] (EwE), is an [[ecosystem]] modelling [[software suite]]. It was initially a [[NOAA]] initiative led by Jeffrey Polovina, later primarily developed at the [[UBC Fisheries Centre]] of the [[University of British Columbia]]. In 2007, it was named as one of the ten biggest scientific breakthroughs in NOAA’s 200-year history. The citation states that Ecopath "revolutionized scientists’ ability worldwide to understand complex marine ecosystems". Behind this lies two decades of development work by [[Villy Christensen]], [[Carl Walters]], [[Daniel Pauly]], and other [[fisheries scientist]]s. As of 2010 there are 6000 registered users in 155 countries. Ecopath is widely used in fisheries management as a tool for modelling and visualising the complex relationships that exist in real world marine ecosystems.

==Human factors==
Managing fisheries is about managing people and businesses, and not about managing fish. Fish populations are managed by regulating the actions of people.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mahon|McConney|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; If fisheries management is to be successful, then associated human factors, such as the reactions of fishermen, are of key importance, and need to be understood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
|last=Hilborn |first=R |year=2007 |url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/bsc/faf/2007/00000008/00000004/art00002
|title=Managing fisheries is managing people: what has been learned? |journal=Fish and Fisheries |volume=8 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-2979.2007.00263_2.x |pages=285–296
|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Management regulations must also consider the implications for stakeholders. Commercial fishermen rely on catches to provide for their families just as farmers rely on crops. Commercial fishing can be a traditional trade passed down from generation to generation. Most commercial fishing is based in towns built around the fishing industry; regulation changes can impact an entire town’s economy. Cuts in harvest quotas can have adverse effects on the ability of fishermen to compete with the tourism industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Elder|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Effective management of fisheries includes involving all stakeholders in the fishery. To do this successfully, stakeholders need to feel empowered enough to make meaningful contributions to the management process.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jentoft|first=Svein|date=January 2004|title=Fisheries co-management as empowerment|url=|journal=Marine Policy|volume=29|pages=1–7|via=Elsevier Science Direct}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Empowerment has a wide application but in this context it refers to a tool that gives people within the fishing communities an opportunity to shape their own future in order to cope with the impacts from large-scale commercial fishing, competition of resources, and other threats that impact fishing communities.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Svein|first=Jentoft|date=January 2004|title=Fisheries co-management as empowerment|url=|journal=Marine Policy|volume=29|pages=1–7|via=Elsevier Science Direct}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, there are limits to empowerment in the fisheries management process. Empowerment maintains an involvement on the part of the state in fisheries management and no matter how empowered the other stakeholders are, the success of fisheries isn't possible without the legislative powers, financial resources, educational support, and research the government provides.&lt;ref name="svein1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Svein|first=Jentoft|date=January 2004|title=Fisheries co-management as empowerment|url=|journal=Marine Policy|volume=29|pages=1–7|via=Elsevier Science Direct}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This concept is not accepted by all, as some communities and individuals argue that the state should withdraw completely and let the local communities handle their own fishery management based on cultural traditions and established practices.&lt;ref name="svein1"/&gt; Additionally, others have argued that co-management only empowers the wealthy and powerful which in turn solidifies and validates the already existing inequalities of fisheries management. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Empowerment working as a function of co-management, carried out correctly, will not only enable but it will authorize individuals and communities to make meaningful contributions to fisheries management. It is a mechanism that works in a loop, where an individual gains empowerment and encouragement from being a part of the group and the collective action is only successful because of its empowered individuals. &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In order to effectively and successfully use empowerment as co-management, it is imperative that study programs, guidelines, reading materials, manuals, and checklists are developed and incorporated into all fisheries management. 

==Performance==
The [[Biomass (ecology)|biomass]] of certain global [[fish stock]]s have been allowed to run down.  The biomass of many species have now diminished to the point where it is no longer possible to [[Maximum sustainable yield|sustainably]] catch the amount of fish that could be caught. According to a 2008 UN report, titled ''[[The Sunken Billions|The Sunken Billions: The Economic Justification for Fisheries Reform]]'', the world's [[fishing fleet]]s incur a "$US 50 billion annual economic loss" through depleted stocks and poor fisheries management. The report, produced jointly by the [[World Bank]] and the UN [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO), asserts that half the world's [[fishing fleet]] could be scrapped with no change in catch.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"By improving governance of marine fisheries, society could capture a substantial part of this $50 billion annual economic loss. Through comprehensive reform, the fisheries sector could become a basis for economic growth and the creation of alternative livelihoods in many countries. At the same time, a nation’s natural capital in the form of fish stocks could be greatly increased and the negative impacts of the fisheries on the marine environment reduced."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arnason|Kelleher|Willmann|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The most prominent failure of fisheries management in recent times has perhaps been the events that lead to the collapse of the [[Cod fisheries#Collapse of the northern cod fishery|northern cod fisheries]]. More recently, the [[International Consortium of Investigative Journalists]] produced a series of journalistic investigations called ''[[Looting the seas]]''. These detail investigations into the black market for [[Atlantic bluefin tuna|bluefin tuna]], the subsidies propping up the Spanish fishing industry, and the overfishing of the [[Chilean jack mackerel]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iwatchnews.org/environment/natural-resources/looting-seas Looting the Seas] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120304215856/http://www.iwatchnews.org/environment/natural-resources/looting-seas |date=4 March 2012 }} ''iWatch News'', 17 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3919">'''Food render''' or '''food rent''' ([[Old English]]: ''foster''){{sfn|Lavelle|2013|pp=261-262}} was a form of [[tax in kind]] (Old English: ''feorm''){{sfn|Faith|2013|p=186}} levied in [[Anglo-Saxon England]], consisting of essential foodstuffs provided by territories such as ''[[regiones]]'', [[Anglo-Saxon multiple estate|multiple estates]] or [[Hundred (county subdivision)|hundreds]] to kings and other members of royal households at a territory's [[royal vill]].{{sfn|Faith|2013|p=186}}

The early medieval [[British Isles]] lacked the sophisticated trade in essential foodstuffs that had supported the urban economies of [[Roman Britain]], and which would be necessary to support large agriculturally unproductive households remaining static in a single location.{{sfn|Charles-Edwards|1989|p=28}} Kings and their entourages therefore constantly toured the subdivisions of their kingdoms, staying at networks of royal properties where they could expect to be supported by the territory's inhabitants.{{sfn|Charles-Edwards|1989|p=28}} In the words of historian [[Thomas Charles-Edwards]]: "it made much more sense to take a royal household to the food than the food to the royal household".{{sfn|Charles-Edwards|1989|p=28}}

Food renders were distinct from the [[tribute]] that Kings extracted from other subjugated kingdoms.{{sfn|Charles-Edwards|1989|p=30}} Food renders consisted of the varied range of foodstuffs that constituted a [[balanced diet]]{{sfn|Charles-Edwards|1989|pp=29-30}} and were consumed within the donor's territory.{{sfn|Charles-Edwards|1989|p=31}} If the King or members of his household did not visit the donor was freed from his obligations for the year.{{sfn|Lavelle|2013|p=261}} Kings did not routinely travel through subjugated kingdoms, however, and tribute extracted from such areas often took the form of livestock that could easily be transported to the dominant kingdom.{{sfn|Charles-Edwards|1989|p=30}}

The late 7th century laws of [[Ine of Wessex]] list the food render expected of an estate of ten [[Hide (unit)|hide]]s as "10 vats of honey, 300 loaves, 12 ambers of Welsh ale, 30 ambers of clear ale, 2 full-grown cows or 10 wethers, 10 geese, 20 hens, 10 cheeses, a full amber of butter, 5 salmon, 20 pounds in weight of fodder, and 100 eels."{{sfn|Faith|2013|p=186}} Grazing would also have been made available for visitors mounts.{{sfn|Faith|2013|pp=186-187}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="53464">'''Hate crime laws in the United States''' are state and federal laws intended to protect against [[hate crimes]] (also known as ''bias crimes'') motivated by enmity or animus against a protected class of persons.  Although state laws vary, current statutes permit federal prosecution of hate crimes committed on the basis of a person's protected characteristics of [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[religion]], [[ethnicity]], [[nationality]], [[gender]], [[sexual orientation]], [[gender identity]], and [[disability]]. The [[U.S. Department of Justice]] (DOJ)/[[FBI]], as well as campus security authorities, are required to collect and publish hate crime statistics.

== Federal prosecution of hate crimes ==
{{Cite check|date=October 2008}}

=== Civil Rights Act of 1968 ===
{{main|Civil Rights Act of 1968}}
The Civil Rights Act of 1968 enacted {{UnitedStatesCode|18|245}}(b)(2), which permits federal prosecution of anyone who "willingly injures, intimidates or interferes with another person, or attempts to do so, by force because of the other person's race, color, religion or national origin"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Federally Protected Activities |website=United States Department of Justice, Civil Rights Division |url=http://www.justice.gov/crt/crim/245.php |dead-url=yes |archive-date=1 January 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110101133706/http://www.justice.gov/crt/crim/245.php }}&lt;/ref&gt; or because of the victim's attempt to engage in one of six types of federally protected activities, such as attending school, patronizing a public place/facility, applying for employment, acting as a juror in a state court or voting.

Persons violating this law face a fine or imprisonment of up to one year, or both. If bodily injury results or if such acts of intimidation involve the use of firearms, explosives or fire, individuals can receive prison terms of up to 10 years, while crimes involving kidnapping, sexual assault, or murder can be punishable by life in prison or the [[death penalty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Civil Rights Statutes|website=FBI|url=https://www.fbi.gov/investigate/civil-rights/federal-civil-rights-statutes}}&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. District Courts provide for criminal sanctions only. The [[Violence Against Women Act]] of 1994 contained a provision at {{USC|42|13981}} which allowed victims of gender-motivated hate crimes to seek "compensatory and punitive damages, injunctive and declaratory relief, and such other relief as a court may deem appropriate", but the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] ruled in ''[[United States v. Morrison]]'' that the provision is unconstitutional.

=== Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act (1994) ===
{{main|Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act}}
The [[Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act]], enacted in {{UnitedStatesCode|28|994}} [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/994- note Sec. 280003], requires the [[United States Sentencing Commission]] to increase the penalties for hate crimes committed on the basis of the actual or perceived race, color, religion, national origin, ethnicity, or gender of any person. In 1995, the Sentencing Commission implemented these guidelines, which only apply to [[federal crime]]s.&lt;ref name="ADL-HCSA"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.adl.org/issue_government/hate_crime_sentencing_act.asp | title = Hate Crime Sentencing Act | accessdate = 10 December 2009 | work = [[Anti-Defamation League]] | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090707195447/http://www.adl.org/issue_government/hate_crime_sentencing_act.asp | archivedate = 7 July 2009 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Church Arson Prevention Act (1996) ===
The S. 1980 (104th): Church Arson Prevention Act of 1996 was introduced to Congress on June 19, 1996, but died because the Senate Committee found some places for improvement of the bill. It was sponsored by Republican Duncan Faircloth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=S. 1890 (104th): Church Arson Prevention Act of 1996|url=https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/104/s1890|website=GovTrack.us|publisher=Civic Impulse, LLC|accessdate=13 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 23, 1996, the House of Representatives introduced H.R. 3525 (104th): Church Arson Prevention Act. The Act was passed by both houses in Congress and signed by President [[Bill Clinton]] on July 3, 1996. This bill became law number Pub.L. 104-155. It was sponsored by Republican Henry Hyde.&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;{{cite web|title=H.R. 3525 (104th): Church Arson Prevention Act of 1996|url=https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/104/hr3525|website=GovTrack.us|publisher=Civic Impulse, LLC|accessdate=13 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill was summarized by the Congressional Research Service as follows: "[the Church Arson Prevention Act of 1996] makes Federal criminal code prohibitions against, and penalties for, damaging religious property or obstructing any person's free exercise of religious beliefs applicable where the offense is in, or affects, interstate commerce."&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt; One of the changes in the bill was the sentence increase for "defacing or destroying any religious real property because of race, color, or ethnic characteristics…" from 10 to 20 years. It also changed the statute of limitations from five years to seven years after the date the crime was committed. It reauthorizes the Hate Crimes Statistics Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Civil Rights Monitor|url=http://www.civilrights.org/monitor/vol8_no5_6/art4.html|website=The Leadership Conference|publisher=The Leadership Conference Education Fund|accessdate=19 November 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129055141/http://www.civilrights.org/monitor/vol8_no5_6/art4.html|archive-date=2014-11-29|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act (2009) ===
{{main|Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act}}
On October 28, 2009 President Obama signed the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, attached to the [[National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010]], which expanded existing United States federal hate crime law to apply to crimes motivated by a victim's actual or perceived gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability, and dropped the prerequisite that the victim be engaging in a federally protected activity.

== State laws ==
45 states and the [[District of Columbia]] have statutes criminalizing various types of bias-motivated violence or intimidation (the exceptions are [[Arkansas]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], whose hate crime statute was struck down by the Georgia Supreme Court in 2004,&lt;ref name="Ga. High Court Strikes Down State's Hate Crimes Law, The Washington Post, October 26, 2004; Page A26"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A62848-2004Oct25.html | work=The Washington Post | title=Nation In Brief | date=2004-10-26 | accessdate=2010-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Indiana]], [[South Carolina]], and [[Wyoming]]). Each of these statutes covers bias on the basis of race, religion, and ethnicity; 32 cover [[Disability hate crime|disability]]; 31 of them cover sexual orientation; 28 cover gender; 17 cover transgender/gender-identity; 13 cover age; 5 cover political affiliation.&lt;ref name="adl"&gt;[http://www.adl.org/99hatecrime/state_hate_crime_laws.pdf State Hate Crime Laws] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070614124916/http://www.adl.org/99hatecrime/state_hate_crime_laws.pdf |date=2007-06-14 }}, [[Anti-Defamation League]], June 2006.  Retrieved 2007-05-04;&lt;/ref&gt; and 3 along with Washington, D.C. cover homelessness.&lt;ref name="homeless" /&gt;

31 states and the District of Columbia have statutes creating a [[Legal liability|civil cause of action]], in addition to the criminal penalty, for similar acts.&lt;ref name="adl"/&gt;

27 states and the District of Columbia have statutes requiring the state to collect hate crime statistics; 16 of these cover sexual orientation.&lt;ref name="adl" /&gt;

3 states and the District of Columbia cover homelessness.&lt;ref name="homeless" /&gt;

===Members of law enforcement===
On May 26, 2016, [[Louisiana]] was the first state to add [[police officers]] and [[firefighters]] to their state hate crime statute, when Governor [[John Bel Edwards]] signed an amendment from the legislature into law. This amendment was added, in part, as a response to the [[Black Lives Matter]] movement, which seeks to end [[police brutality]] against black people, with some advocates of the amendment using the slogan "[[Blue Lives Matter]]". Since the inception of Black Lives Matter, critics have found some of the movement's rhetoric anti-police, with the author of the amendment, [[Lance Harris]], stating some "were employing a deliberate campaign to terrorize our officers". Despite [[Shooting of Darren Goforth|the killing of a Texas sheriff]] in 2015 and [[2014 killings of NYPD officers|the killings of two NYPD officers]] in the previous year, in response to the [[death of Eric Garner]] and the [[shooting of Michael Brown]], there was little to no data suggesting hate crimes against law enforcement were a common problem when the bill was passed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pérez-Peña|first1=Richard|title=Louisiana Enacts Hate Crimes Law to Protect a New Group: Police|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/27/us/louisiana-enacts-hate-crimes-law-to-protect-a-new-group-police.html|accessdate=27 May 2016|newspaper=The New York Times|date=27 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Harris|first1=Lance|website=Louisiana State Legislature|title=House Bill No. 953|url=http://www.legis.la.gov/Legis/ViewDocument.aspx?d=990021|format=PDF|accessdate=27 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A little less than two months after the amendment was passed, [[Baton Rouge]] was in the national spotlight after the [[Baton Rouge Police Department|Baton Rouge Police]] killing of [[Shooting of Alton Sterling|Alton Sterling]] by two white police officers. This sparked protests in Baton Rouge, resulting in hundreds of arrests and increased racial tension nationally. In the week during those protests, [[2016 shooting of Dallas police officers|five police officers were killed in Dallas]], and the week after the protests, [[2016 shooting of Baton Rouge police officers|three more officers were killed in Baton Rouge]]. Both perpetrators were killed and the motives behind both shootings were responses to the recent police killings by police officers of black men.

=== Hate Crime Statistics Act of 1990 ===
{{main|Hate Crime Statistics Act}}
The Hate Crime Statistics Act of 1990 {{UnitedStatesCode|28|534}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Appendix A |website=Hate Crime Statistics, 2004 |publisher=FBI |url=https://www.fbi.gov/ucr/hc2004/appendix_a.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=January 14, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090114101004/http://www.fbi.gov/ucr/hc2004/appendix_a.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt; requires the [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] to collect data on crimes committed because of the victim's race, religion, disability, sexual orientation, or ethnicity.  The bill was signed into law in 1990 by [[George H. W. Bush]], and was the first federal statute to "recognize and name gay, lesbian and bisexual people."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thetaskforce.org/issues/hate_crimes_main_page/timeline |title=Hate Crimes Protections Timeline |website=[[National Gay and Lesbian Task Force]] |access-date=2007-05-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140401073246/http://www.thetaskforce.org/issues/hate_crimes_main_page/timeline |archivedate=2014-04-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1992, the Department of Justice and the FBI have jointly published an annual report on hate crime statistics.&lt;ref name="UCRMain"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.fbi.gov/ucr/ucr.htm | title = Uniform Crime Reports | accessdate = 10 December 2009 | website = [[CJIS]] | publisher = FBI | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20041024015252/https://www.fbi.gov//ucr/ucr.htm | archivedate = 24 October 2004 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 ===
{{main|Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act}}
In 1994, the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act expanded the scope to include crimes based on [[Disability hate crime|disability]], and the FBI began collecting data on disability bias crimes on January 1, 1997.&lt;ref name = "UCR96"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.fbi.gov/ucr/hate96.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 10 December 2009 | title = Hate crime statistics 1996 | work = [[CJIS]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070709230626/http://www.fbi.gov/ucr/hate96.pdf |archivedate=2007-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, Congress permanently reauthorized the Act.

=== Campus Hate Crimes Right to Know Act of 1997 ===
The Campus Hate Crimes Right to Know Act of 1997 enacted {{USCSub|20|1092|f|1|F|ii}}, which requires campus security authorities to collect and report data on hate crimes committed on the basis of race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, ethnicity, or disability. This bill was brought to the forefront by Senator [[Robert Torricelli]].

== Prevalence of hate crimes ==
The DOJ and the FBI have gathered statistics on hate crimes reported to law enforcement since 1992 in accordance with the [[Hate Crime Statistics Act]]. The FBI's [[Criminal Justice Information Services Division]] has annually published these statistics as part of its [[Uniform Crime Reports|Uniform Crime Reporting]] program. According to these reports, of the over 113,000 hate crimes since 1991, 55% were motivated by racial bias, 17% by religious bias, 14% sexual orientation bias, 14% ethnicity bias, and 1% disability bias.&lt;ref&gt;Abrams, J.

=== Deliberate attacks on the homeless as hate crimes ===
Florida, Maine, Maryland, and Washington, D.C. have hate crime laws that include the homeless status of an individual.&lt;ref name="homeless"&gt;
{{cite web
| title = Florida among first states to make attacks on homeless hate crimes
| url = http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2010-05-18/features/os-homeless-hatecrimes-20100518_1_homeless-people-homeless-person-national-law-center
| accessdate = May 25, 2010
}} May 18, 2010, ''Orlando Sentinel'', Quote: "Florida becomes only the fourth jurisdiction to make attacks on homeless people a hate crime – behind Maryland, Maine and Washington, D.C."&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2007 study found that the number of [[Homelessness in the United States#Crimes against homeless people|violent crimes against the homeless]] is increasing.&lt;ref&gt;Lewan, Todd, [https://web.archive.org/web/20181010060835/http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/P/PREYING_ON_THE_HOMELESS?SITE=WIJAN&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT "Unprovoked Beatings of Homeless Soaring"], [[Associated Press]], April 8, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hate, Violence, and Death on Main Street USA"&gt;[[National Coalition for the Homeless]], [http://www.nationalhomeless.org/getinvolved/projects/hatecrimes/pressrelease.html Hate, "Violence, and Death on Main Street USA: A report on Hate Crimes and Violence Against People Experiencing Homelessness, 2006"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070403051522/http://www.nationalhomeless.org/getinvolved/projects/hatecrimes/pressrelease.html |date=2007-04-03 }}, February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The rate of such documented crimes in 2005 was 30% higher than of those in 1999.&lt;ref name="A Dream Denied"&gt;National Coalition for the Homeless: [http://www.nationalhomeless.org/publications/crimreport/report.pdf A Dream Denied].&lt;/ref&gt; 75% of all perpetrators are under the age of 25. Studies and surveys indicate that homeless people have a much higher criminal victimization rate than the non-homeless, but that most incidents never get reported to authorities.

In recent years, largely due to the efforts of the [[National Coalition for the Homeless]] (NCH) and academic researchers the problem of violence against the homeless has gained national attention. The NCH called deliberate attacks against the homeless [[hate crimes]] in their report ''Hate, Violence, and Death on Mainstreet USA'' (they retain the definition of the American Congress).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Hate, Violence, and Death on Main Street USA: A report on Hate Crimes and Violence Against People Experiencing Homelessness|year=2008|publisher=National Coalition for the Homeless|url=http://www.nationalhomeless.org/publications/hatecrimes/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Center for the Study of Hate &amp; Extremism'' at [[California State University]], San Bernardino in conjunction with the NCH found that 155 homeless people were killed by non-homeless people in "hate killings", while 76 people were killed in all the other traditional hate crime [[homicide]] categories such as race and religion, combined.&lt;ref name="Hate, Violence, and Death on Main Street USA"/&gt; The CSHE contends that negative and degrading portrayals of the homeless contribute to a climate where violence takes place.

== Hate crime laws debate ==
{{Main|Hate_crime#Support_for_and_opposition_to_hate_crime_laws|l1=Debate over hate crime laws}}
Penalty-enhancement hate crime laws are traditionally justified on the grounds that, in [[William Rehnquist|Chief Justice Rehnquist]]'s words, "this conduct is thought to inflict greater individual and societal harm.... bias-motivated crimes are more likely to provoke retaliatory crimes, inflict distinct emotional harms on their victims, and incite community unrest."&lt;ref&gt;[[Wisconsin v. Mitchell|Wisconsin v. Mitchell, 508 U.S. 476 (1993)]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classification of crimes committed against Caucasians===
{{refimprove section|date=January 2013}}
In a 2001 report: ''Hate crimes on campus: the problem and efforts to confront it,'' by Stephen Wessler and Margaret Moss of the Center for the Prevention of Hate Violence at the [[University of Southern Maine]], the authors note that "although there are fewer hate crimes directed against [[Caucasian race|Caucasians]] than against other groups, they do occur and are prosecuted."&lt;ref name=Altschiller2005&gt;{{cite book|title=Hate crimes: a reference handbook|series=Contemporary world issues|author=Donald Altschiller|edition=2nd|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2005|isbn=9781851096244|pages=146}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the case in which the Supreme Court upheld hate crimes legislation against [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] attack, ''[[Wisconsin v. Mitchell]]'', 508 U.S. 476 (1993), involved a white victim. Hate crime statistics published in 2002, gathered by the FBI under the auspices of the Hate Crime Statistics Act of 1990, documented over 7,000 hate crime incidents, in roughly one-fifth of which the victims were white people.&lt;ref name=Samaha2005&gt;{{cite book|title=Criminal justice|author=Joel Samaha|edition=7th|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=2005|isbn=9780534645571|pages=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, these statistics have caused dispute.  The FBI's hate crimes statistics for 1993, which similarly reported 20% of all hate crimes to be committed against white people, prompted Jill Tregor, executive director of Intergroup Clearinghouse, to decry it as "an abuse of what the hate crime laws were intended to cover", stating that the white victims of these crimes were employing hate crime laws as a means to further penalize minorities.&lt;ref name="JacobsPotter2000"&gt;{{cite book | title=Hate crimes: criminal law &amp;amp; identity politics | publisher=Oxford University Press, USA | author=Jacobs, James B. | isbn=9780198032229 | series=Studies in Crime and Public Policy | year=2000 | pages=134 | quote=When the FBI's 1993 hate crime statistics reported that whites comprised 20 percent of all hate crime victims, some advocacy groups questioned whether the hate crime laws were being perverted.&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; Jill Tregor, executive director of the San Francisco-based Intergroup Clearinghouse, which provides legal and emotional counseling to hate crime victims, stated, "This is an abuse of what the hate crime laws were intended to cover."&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt; Tregor accused white hate crime victims of using the laws to enhance penalties against minorities, who already experience prejudice within the criminal justice system.&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; Whites, generally sympathetic to the aspirations of minorities, may bristle at the suggestion that crimes motivated by blacks' racism against whites should be treated as a less virulent strain of hate crime, or not as hate crime at all. While no enacted hate crime law makes that distinction, a number of writers in prominent publications, likening hate crime laws to affirmative action for "protected groups," advocate the exclusion of racist crimes against whites from their coverage.&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; This issue alone seems fraught with potential for social conflict and constitutional concerns. | author2=Potter, Kimberly}}&lt;/ref&gt;

James B. Jacobs and Kimberly Potter note that white people, including those who may be sympathetic to the plight of those who are victims of hate crimes ''by'' white people, bristle at the notion that hate crimes against whites are somehow inferior to, and less worthy than, hate crimes against other groups.  They observe that while, as stated by Altschiller, no hate crime law makes any such distinction, the proposition has been argued by "a number of writers in prominent publications", who have advocated the removal of hate crimes against whites from the category of hate crime, on the grounds that hate crime laws, in their view, are intended to be [[affirmative action]] for "protected groups".  Jacobs and Potter firmly assert that such a move is "fraught with potential for social conflict and constitutional concerns."

Analysis of the 1999 FBI statistics by John Perazzo in 2001 found that white violence against black people was 28 times more likely to be labelled as a hate crime (1 in 45 incidents) than black violence against white people (1 in 1254 incidents).&lt;ref name=Walsh2004&gt;{{cite book|title=Race and crime: a biosocial analysis|author=Anthony Walsh|publisher=Nova Publishers|year=2004|isbn=9781590339701|pages=44–45}}&lt;/ref&gt; In analyzing hate crime ''hoaxes'', Katheryn Russell-Brown propounds a hypothesis explaining the disparity in how hate crimes against whites are viewed with respect to hate crimes against blacks.  She hypothesizes that the prevailing view in the minds of the public, that hate-crimes-against-blacks hoaxers intend to take advantage of, is that the crime that whites are most likely to commit against blacks is a hate crime, and that it is hard for (in her words) "most of us" to envision a white person committing a crime against a black person for a different reason.  The ''only'' white people who commit crimes against black people, goes the public belief, are racially prejudiced white extremists.  Whereas in contrast, she continues, the situation with hate-crimes-against-whites hoaxers differs, because the popular perception is that black people ''in general'' are liable to "run amok, committing depraved, unprovoked acts of violence" against white people.&lt;ref name=Russell-Brown1998&gt;{{cite book|title=The color of crime: racial hoaxes, white fear, black protectionism, police harassment, and other macroaggressions|series=Critical America|author=Katheryn Russell-Brown|publisher=NYU Press|year=1998|isbn=9780814774717|pages=80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Henry and Felicia Pratto assert that while certain hate crimes (that they do not specify) against white people are a valid category, that one can "speak sensibly of", and that while such crimes may be the result of racial prejudice, (and therefore if that is the case, they are squarely covered by hate crime legislation intent for prosecution), in a limited definition of the word, they assert do not constitute actual ''racism'' per se, because a hate crime against a member of a group that is superior in the alleged and dated power hierarchy by a member of one that is inferior, they believe may not be racist.  The concept of racism as understood by a limited number of social scientists and some others, they allege, requires as a fundamental element a superior-to-inferior group-based power relationship, which a hate crime against white people they believe does not have. However, other social scientists who define racism in a broader sense realize "whites" have over the many centuries, and often do experience discrimination and segregation from their "non white" human cousins, because of their actually or perceived race. And since the components of discrimination and segregation exist within an academic definition of racism, "whites" have been, and many times are victims of racism. Current prison culture in America is a classic example of such discrimination and segregation, as whole groups, and different "races" are discriminated against and segregated based on such, with "whites" receiving more harsh treatment because of their perceived race and/or minority status in prison.

Not all social scientists agree or affirm the opinion/supposition that racism litmus tests should be based on a group-based power relationships that include thousands of individuals over hundreds of years, rather they affirm they should be taken on a more individual case by case basis.  Many social scientists agree that this is the most comprehensive and sensible way to determine whether racism is truly a motivating factor when the victim is white and the perpetrator is black. "Whites" are legally protected by hate crimes laws both within the laws themselves, and within the constitution's requirement they receive equal protection of the laws. Therefore, it's a moot point to determine if racism is a factor in the case of "black" on "white" crime for prosecution, since racism alone is not the only factor needed for prosecution. What is relevant to determine prosecution for a hate crime is whether any race or some other "protected characteristic" not "protected groups" was a factor in why a person targeted that/those individual/s to be their victim. e.g. If a "black" person targets a "white" person to be their victim simply because of his/her race or perceived race, whatever their accompanying rationale, they would be subject to hate crime prosecution. However, it's not without merit to determine their rationale, because it's within their rationale that one may verify if a true hate crime has been committed. This is why hate crimes are difficult to prosecute, because they essentially involve prosecuting thoughts rather than physical crimes, which are easier to prove. Therefore, this individual approach has been preferred over a blanket broad brush approach of past perceived ancestral sufferings and feelings of inferiority and/or superiority of groups that encompass thousands of individuals over hundreds of years.&lt;ref name=HenryPratto&gt;{{cite book|author=P.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10106">'''Intangible Asset Finance''' is the branch of [[finance]] that deals with [[intangible assets]] such as [[patents]] (legal intangible) and [[reputation]] (competitive intangible). Like other areas of finance, intangible asset finance is concerned with the interdependence of [[Value (economics)|value]], [[risk]], and [[time]].

== Basic principles ==

In 2003, one estimate put the [[economic equilibrium]] of intangible assets in the U.S. [[economy]] at $5 trillion, which represented over one-third or more of the value of U.S. domestic [[corporations]] in the first quarter of 2001.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=RmFLUk7NydQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Intangible+Assets:+Values,+Measures+and+Risks,&amp;sig=W2d87NPMzvfWlTDrmUNijOziu-8#PPA28,M1 "A Trillion Dollars A Year In Intangible Investment," Leonard Nakamura in '''Intangible Assets: Values, Measures and Risks''' at 28, Hand &amp; Lev, Oxford University Press (2003).]&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the goals of people working in this field is to unlock the "hidden value" found in intangible assets through the techniques of finance. Another goal is to measure how firm performance correlates with intangible asset [[management]].

Intangible assets include [[business processes]], Intellectual Property (IP) such as [[patents]], [[trademarks]], [[reputation]]s for [[ethics]] and [[integrity]], [[Quality (business)|quality]], [[safety]], [[sustainability]], [[security]], and [[Resilience (organizational)|resilience]]. Today, these intangibles drive [[cash flow]] and are the primary sources of risk. Intangible asset information, [[management]], [[risk forecasting]] and [[risk transfer]] are growing services as the [[economic base]] divests itself of physical [[assets]]. Rights to tangible and intangible assets are intangible, and can be traded globally.&lt;ref&gt;Gio Wiederhold; ''Valuing intangible Capital, Multinationals and Taxhavens''; Springer Verlag, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Business models ==

A number of intangible asset business models have evolved over the years.

*'''Patent Licensing &amp; Enforcement Companies ("P-LECs")''': These are firms that acquire patents for the sole purpose of securing licenses and/or damages awards from infringing parties. Perhaps the most famous P-LEC is [[NTP, Inc.]], which has successfully asserted patents related to email [[push technology]]. Another name for a P-LEC is "[[patent troll]]," although this is viewed as a pejorative reference. Recently, [[hedge funds]] have raised capital for the specific purpose of investing in patent litigation.   One such hedge fund is Altitude Capital Partners, which is based in [[New York City]].
*'''Royalty stream securitizers''': These are firms that are engaged in the buying and selling of what are essentially specialized [[Asset-backed security|asset-backed securities]]. The assets that are securitized are typically intellectual properties, such as patents, that have been bearing royalties for a period of time. Royalty Pharma is a well known firm that uses this business model, and which has done by far the largest and most high-profile deals in this space.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thedeal.com/newsweekly/features/a-seller's-market.php#bottom "A seller's market," The Deal, September 5, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; Royalty Pharma handled what many consider to be the first [[pharmaceutical]] patent-backed securitization to be rated by [[Standard and Poors]], which involved a patent on the [[HIV]] drug [[Zerit]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=rESRFPqSKzQC&amp;pg=PA487&amp;lpg=PA487&amp;dq=zerit+patent+securitization&amp;source=web&amp;ots=sN9S5ZWcrM&amp;sig=LhlE-nYfxXddjCKeoGql6ap5KxM&amp;hl=en#PPA487,M1 "Avoiding Transaction Peril," Heller et al., in '''From Ideas to Assets: Investing Wisely in Intellectual Property''' at 487, Bruce Berman, John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2002]&lt;/ref&gt;  The other parties involved in the Zerit transaction were [[Yale]] (the owner of the patent) and [[Bristol Myers Squibb]].
*'''Reinsurers''': These are firms that use the techniques of [[reinsurance]] to mitigate intangible asset risks. In the same way that some firms issue [[Catastrophe bond|cat bonds]] to mitigate the risks associated with [[extreme weather]], [[earthquake]]s, or other natural disasters, firms exposed to substantial intangible risk can issue "intangible asset risk-linked securities" that transfer intangible risk to hedge funds and other players in the capital markets with a sufficient appetite for risk. Steel City Re, which is based in [[Pittsburgh]], is a [[thought leader]] regarding the use of risk transfer techniques to protect and recover intangible asset value.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.steelcityre.com/accelerating_innovation.shtml Steel City Re]&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Market makers''': Firms that are working to provide more [[liquidity]] to the market for intellectual property. Early [[market maker]]s offered on-line intellectual property exchanges where buyers and sellers could exchange rights in licensed intellectual property, usually patents. On April 22, 2008, Ocean Tomo reported&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oceantomo.com/press/Europe_Auction_Catalogue_Release_4.22.08.pdf Ocean Tomo Press Release April 22, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; that it had transacted approximately $70 million in its IP auctions across [[Europe]] and the [[United States]]. In 2009, The Intellectual Property Exchange International (IPXI), headquartered in Chicago, will begin operations as the world’s first [[stock exchange]] with an intellectual property focus.
*'''Investment Research Firms''': Companies that provide specific advice to investors on intellectual property issues.   Recently, hedge fund managers have been hiring patent [[Lawyer|attorneys]] to follow and handicap outcomes in high-stakes patent cases.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

== Significant transactions ==

*'''1997''':  [[David Bowie]] securitizes the future royalty revenues earned from his pre-1990 music catalogue by issuing [[Bowie Bonds]].
*'''2000''': BioPharma Royalty Trust completes the $115 million securitization of a single Yale patent with claims covering [[Stavudine]], which is a [[reverse transcriptase inhibitor]] and the active ingredient in the drug Zerit. This was the first publicly rated patent securitization in the U.S. At the time of the deal, Bristol Myers Squibb had the exclusive rights to distribute Zerit in the U.S. Not long after closing slow sales of Zerit along with an accounting [[scandal]] at Bristol Myers Squibb triggered the accelerated and premature [[amortization]] of the transaction. Many observers believe that this deal was ultimately unsuccessful because of a lack of [[Diversification (finance)|diversification]] as it involved a single patent and a single [[licensee]].
*'''2005''': UCC Capital Corporation securitization of BCBG [[Max Azria]]'s royalty receivables generated from worldwide intellectual property rights worth $53 million. This transaction is recognized as the first "whole company securitization" involving primarily intangible assets. UCC Capital Corporation was founded by Robert W. D'Loren, and was acquired by [[NexCen Brands, Inc.]] in 2006. NexCen sold substantially all of its assets to Levine Leichtman Capital Partners in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/2010/05/13/idUS107689+13-May-2010+BW20100513 NexCen Press Release, May 13, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''2005''': Ocean Tomo holds its first live IP auction. Although proceeds from the first auction were unremarkable, the relative success of the Ocean Tomo auctions that followed showed that the live auction is a reasonably viable business model for monetizing intellectual property.
*'''2006''':  [[Marvel Entertainment]]'s film rights securitization in conjunction with [[Ambac Financial Group]] to provide a triple-A financial guarantee on a [[credit facility]] for Marvel backed by a slate of 10 films to be produced by Marvel Studios and [[intellectual property]] related to some of Marvel’s most popular [[comic book]] characters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ambac.com/pdfs%5CDeals%5Cmarvel.pdf Ambac's press release, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Government, societies, think tanks, and other non-profits ==

On June 23, 2008, the [[United States National Academies]] hosted a one-day conference in [[Washington, D.C.]] entitled "Intangible Assets: Measuring and Enhancing Their Contribution to Corporate Value and Economic Growth."

[[The Intangible Asset Finance Society]] provides a forum for finance, innovation, legal and management professionals to discover better ways to create, capture and preserve the value of intangible assets.

The Athena Alliance is a non-profit organization dedicated to
public education and research on the emerging global [[information economy]]. On April 16, 2008 it published&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.athenaalliance.org/pdf/IntangibleAssetMonetization.pdf "Intangible Asset Monetization: The Promise and the Reality"]&lt;/ref&gt; a widely circulated working paper on the topic of intangible asset finance.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2415">==Enforcement and attitudes==
As in most [[developing countries]], [[intellectual property]] protection in [[Senegal]] is weak.  [[Copyright infringement]] is not regarded as a crime, and it is widely accepted by consumers.  Senegal’s criminal law provisions do not provide for criminal procedures in case of trademark counterfeiting or copyright piracy on a commercial scale.  In addition, because of budget constraints, Senegal’s Copyright Office has had difficulty enforcing sanctions against individuals who infringe copyrights in the course of business, including hackers and distributors of infringed copies.  Nonetheless, the Copyright Office has begun vigorous attempts against [[counterfeit]] media, seizing items as well as putting stickers on legal merchandise.  It is currently continuing these enforcement efforts.  [[Microsoft]] began an anti-[[piracy]] campaign in Senegal in early 2004 and reports some success in converting users of pirated Microsoft products through the sale of deeply discounted Microsoft licenses.&lt;ref name=ccg&gt;[http://www.buyusa.gov/westafrica/en/senegal_ccg.pdf Senegal Country Commercial Guide 2008] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090507200048/http://www.buyusa.gov/westafrica/en/senegal_ccg.pdf |date=2009-05-07 }}. [[U.S. Commercial Service]] (2008). {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
==Treaties and law==
Senegal is a signatory to the [[Berne Convention]].  It also is a member of the [[African Organization of Intellectual Property]] (OAPI), a grouping of 15 [[Francophone]] [[Africa]]n countries, which has established among its member states a common system for obtaining and maintaining protection for patents, trademarks and industrial designs.  Therefore, rights registered in one member country are valid in all.  [[Patent]] validity is 20 years.  Registered trademarks are protected for 20 years at each registration, renewable without limit.&lt;ref name=ccg/&gt;
 
Senegal is a signatory to the [[World Trade Organization]] and its [[Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Agreement]] (TRIPS).  Since January 2000, Senegal theoretically has been in full compliance with the TRIPS accord, but has yet to deposit its instruments of ratification for [[WIPO Copyright Treaty]] and the [[WIPO Performances and Phonograms]].&lt;ref name=ccg/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2694">While no [[creative work]] is automatically protected worldwide, there are '''international [[treaty|treaties]]''' which provide protection automatically for all creative works as soon as they are fixed in a medium. There are two primary international copyright agreements, the [[Universal Copyright Convention]] and the [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works]].

==Berne Convention==
{{main|Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works}}

The '''Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works''' (also referred to as just the Berne Convention) requires protection for all creative works in a fixed medium be automatic, and last for at least 50 years after the author's death for any work except for photographic and cinematographic works. Photographic works are tied to a minimum of 25 years. Cinematographic works are protected for 50 years after first showing, or 50 years after creation if it hasn't been shown within 50 years after the creation. The Berne Convention also allows for the rule of the shorter term, stating that "unless the legislation of that country otherwise provides, the term shall not exceed the term fixed in the country of origin of the work". Not all countries have applied this rule however.

==Buenos Aires Convention==
{{main|Buenos Aires Convention}}

The '''Buenos Aires Convention''' (Third [[Pan-American Convention]]) was a treaty signed by most [[North America|North]] and [[South America]]n countries, which allows for protection of all creative works as long as they contain a notice informing that the creator claims copyright on it. The Buenos Aires Convention also instituted the ''[[rule of the shorter term]]'', where the length of the copyright term for the work in a country was whichever was shorter - the length of the term in the source country, or the protecting country of the work.

All Buenos Aires countries are now also parties to the Berne Convention, but elements from Buenos Aires are still used in the modern era, such as the rule of the shorter term.

'''Kermit Roosevelt III''' (born July 14, 1971) is an American writer, author, lawyer, and professor at the [[University of Pennsylvania]]. He is a great-great-grandson of [[United States President]] [[Theodore Roosevelt]] (1858–1919)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://m.bizjournals.com/philadelphia/news/2014/09/19/teddy-roosevelts-great-great-grandson-talks.html?page=all&amp;r=full|title=Teddy Roosevelt's great-great-grandson talks documentary, family|last=|first=|date=|website=m.bizjournals.com|access-date=2017-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the fifth cousin four times removed of President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]  (1882–1945).

==Early life==
Roosevelt was born in [[Washington, D.C.]] on July 14, 1971. His father, also named Kermit (born April 7, 1938), is a great-grandson of President [[Theodore Roosevelt]]. He graduated from [[St. Albans School (Washington, D.C.)|St. Albans School]] (where he was a Presidential Scholar),&lt;ref&gt;''Presidential Scholars.'' Charles Elder. '''[[The Washington Post]]'''. DISTRICT WEEKLY; PAGE J3; PEOPLE. June 1, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Harvard University]], and [[Yale Law School]]. He was a [[law clerk]] for Judge [[Stephen F. Williams]] of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit|D.C. Circuit]], and clerked for [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court Justice]] [[David Souter]].&lt;ref name=Skews&gt;"Politics skews perception on judicial rulings: author". STEPHANIE POTTER. '''Chicago Daily Law Bulletin''' Pg. 10001. January 23, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Roosevelt worked as a lawyer with [[Mayer Brown]] in [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]] from 2000 to 2002 before joining the Penn Law faculty in 2002.&lt;ref name=Skews/&gt;

Roosevelt's areas of academic interest include conflicts of law and constitutional law. He has published in the Virginia Law Review, the Michigan Law Review, and the Columbia Law Review, among others, and his articles have been cited twice by the United States Supreme Court and numerous times by state and lower federal courts.

Some of his recent scholarly publications include "Detention and Interrogation in the Post-9/11 World," delivered as the Donahue Lecture at Suffolk University Law School in 2008, "[[Guantanamo Bay Detention Camp|Guantanamo]] and the Conflict of Laws: ''[[Rasul v. Bush|Rasul]]'' and Beyond" (2005), published in the ''[[University of Pennsylvania Law Review]]'', "Constitutional Calcification: How the Law Becomes What the Court Does," ''[[University of Virginia Law Review]]'' (2005), and "Resolving [[Renvoi]]: the Bewitchment of Our Intelligence by Means of Language," ''[[Notre Dame University|Notre Dame]] Law Review'' (2005).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ndlawreview.org/volume-80-issue-5/ |title=Volume 80, Issue 5 |publisher=Notre Dame Law Review |accessdate=June 15, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111207075441/http://ndlawreview.org/volume-80-issue-5/ |archivedate=December 7, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roosevelt is also an award-winning novelist. His debut novel ''In the Shadow of the Law'' (Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, 2005) won the Philadelphia Athenaeum Annual Literary Award. A national campus bestseller, the novel was the New York Times Book Review Editors' Choice Selection and a Christian Science Monitor Best Book of the Year. In a 2005 ''[[New York Times]]'' review of Roosevelt's novel ''In the Shadow of the Law'', [[Alan Dershowitz]] wrote, "I recommend this book with real enthusiasm. Why? Precisely because it doesn't glamorize its subject. Roosevelt's gritty portrayal of the transformation of bright-eyed and colorful young associates into dim-eyed and gray middle-aged partners (no one seems to make it to his or her golden years) rings true of all too many corporate law factories."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/12/books/review/12DERSHOW.html|title='In the Shadow of the Law': Their Finest Billable Hour|last=Dershowitz|first=Alan M.|date=2005-06-12|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-03-28|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, Paramount filmed a pilot episode (written by Carol Mendelsohn) for a TV series based on the novel, starring Joshua Jackson, Frank Langella, Kevin Pollak, Monet Mazur, and Alan Tudyk.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=|first=|title=Capitol Law|date=2000-01-01|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0759744/fullcredits/|last2=|last3=|last4=|first2=|first3=|first4=|work=Internet Movie Database|accessdate=2017-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His second novel, ''Allegiance'', published in 2015, was a Harper Lee Prize finalist. It received favorable reviews in ''The Wall Street Journal'' ("well worth reading") and ''The Richmond Times-Dispatch'' ("splendid, troubling, and authoritative") and a starred review from Publishers Weekly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/war-powers-1440190804|title=War Powers|last=Lat|first=David|date=2015-08-21|work=Wall Street Journal|access-date=2017-03-28|issn=0099-9660}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.richmond.com/entertainment/books/article_844bfb51-5dcd-57c6-95cd-575ee99bc027.html|title=Book review (Fiction): 'Allegiance'|last=Strafford|first=Jay|date=|work=Richmond Times-Dispatch|access-date=2017-03-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-1-941393-30-7|title=Fiction Book Review: Allegiance by Kermit Roosevelt|last=|first=|date=|work=PublishersWeekly.com|access-date=2017-03-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on actual events, the story examines U.S. national security policies during World War II, focusing on President Franklin D. Roosevelt's executive order 9066, which authorized the internment of Japanese Americans. Roosevelt studied court documents and personal diaries of key political figures, including Supreme Court Justice Hugo Black, J. Edgar Hoover, Felix Frankfurter, and Francis Biddle, to accurately portray the circumstances and motivations behind the decisions that led to the internment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.scotusblog.com/2015/09/book-review-allegiance-to-rules-or-justice/|title=Book review: Allegiance - to rules or justice? - SCOTUSblog|date=2015-09-29|work=SCOTUSblog|access-date=2017-03-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Allegiance'' recaptures the legal debates within the US government, including the Supreme Court cases Hirabayashi vs. United States and [[Korematsu v. United States|Korematsu vs. United States]], and explores the moral issues surrounding U.S. national security policies.

In December, 2015, Kermit Roosevelt was a keynote speaker at The Commonwealth Club in San Francisco, California. Karen Korematsu, daughter of [[Fred Korematsu]] and director of The Korematsu Institute, attended the event. In May, 2016, Roosevelt and Karen Korematsu were featured speakers at the National Constitution Center for a program entitled, "Civil Liberties in Times of Crisis." Jess Bravin, the Supreme Court correspondent for ''The Wall Street Journal'', served as moderator. It is the first time a member of the Roosevelt family and a member of the Korematsu family appeared in a public forum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://constitutioncenter.org/experience/programs-initiatives/past-programs/civil-liberties-in-times-of-crisis-japanese-american-internment-and-america|title=Civil Liberties in Times of Crisis: Japanese-American Internment and America Today - National Constitution Center|website=National Constitution Center – constitutioncenter.org|language=en|access-date=2017-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January, 2015, the Japan Society hosted an event featuring Kermit Roosevelt and actor/activist [[George Takei]], who was five years old when he and his family were forced into an internment camp.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.japansociety.org/event/george-takei-from-barbed-wire-to-broadway|title=Event Detail|website=www.japansociety.org|language=en|access-date=2017-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Takei called Roosevelt's book ''Allegiance,'' "A rip-roaring good read."

Roosevelt is a Distinguished Research Fellow of the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.annenbergpublicpolicycenter.org/annenberg-public-policy-center-distinguished-research-fellows/|title=The Annenberg Public Policy Center of the University of Pennsylvania  –  Distinguished Research Fellows|work=The Annenberg Public Policy Center of the University of Pennsylvania|access-date=2017-03-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a member of the American Law Institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ali.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=directory.viewmembers|title=Members {{!}} American Law Institute|last=Institute|first=The American Law|website=American Law Institute|language=en|access-date=2017-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2014, the American Law Institute announced that Roosevelt had been selected as the Reporter for the Third Restatement of Conflict of Laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ali.org/email/pr-14-11-17.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-01-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150105194613/http://www.ali.org/email/pr-14-11-17.html |archivedate=2015-01-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Roosevelt is also a lecturer for Kaplan Bar Review.  He prepares students in all 50 states for the Constitutional Law portion of the bar exam.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=KaplanBarReview|title=Constitutional Law - Excerpt of lecture by Professor Kermit Roosevelt|date=2013-01-02|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=di5GpL_ApN0|accessdate=2017-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roosevelt is an internationally recognized expert on constitutional law, the Supreme Court, national security and civil liberties, US Presidential history, and Japanese American internment. He is a frequent contributor to national and international media outlets, including ''Time'', ''The New York Times'', the ''Huffington Post'', and ''Newsmax''. His TEDx talk (June, 2016) is entitled "Myth America: The Declaration, the Constitution, and Us."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=TEDx Talks|title=Myth America: The Declaration, The Constitution, and Us {{!}} Kermit Roosevelt {{!}} TEDxBerkshires|date=2016-08-30|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFYKRISKqYI|accessdate=2017-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1945">'''Land consolidation''' is a planned readjustment and rearrangement of land parcels and their ownership. It is usually applied to form larger and more rational land holdings.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2927">'''Legal syllogism''' is a legal concept concerning the law and its application. It is based upon deductive reasoning applied for the sake of law, hence it is also called '''legal deduction''' or '''deductive legal reasoning'''.

In legal syllogism there are two premises, minor and major, and one conclusion.

The place of the major premise is taken by a legal norm (or rule). This norm (rule) may be derived from canonical text (text of statutes, constitutions, regulations, international treaties and agreements, ordinances, bylaws etc) or from a judicial precedent. In the latter case, it can be called ''[[ratio decidendi]]'' or ruling. In the main, it can be considered as a general expression which, in generic terms, states what one ought to do or ought not to do in a certain type of circumstances. 

The facts of the case at hand (also called pending, instant, ''[[sub judice]]'', at bar or under argument) serve as the minor premise. These facts may be understood as all elements of the factual setting of the case at hand, i.e. the details of the events, things and persons which occurred in a case to which the rule/norm that constitutes the major premise is to be applied deductively.

The conclusion is formed by the legal consequence for the case at hand.

If the norm that forms the major premise is valid (binding in a given legal system) and the facts of the case at hand are proven or posited as true, the conclusion of legal syllogism which flows from subsuming these facts under this norm (rule) is supposed to be correct as well.&lt;ref&gt;Maciej Koszowski, "Legal Analogy as an Alternative to the Deductive Mode of Legal Reasoning." The Indonesian Journal of International &amp; Comparative Law no 1/2017: 74–76.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maciej Koszowski, "Intricacies, Fallacy and Madness of Legal Deduction." Archiv für Rechts- und Sozialphilosophie no. 4/2017: 495-496.&lt;/ref&gt;

In that sense, legal syllogism can be deemed to be equally infallible  as 'ordinary' ('logical') [[syllogism]]. Such a claim is, however, ill-founded and, in fact, subsumption of a concrete case under a general rule proves to be a value-laden and goal-oriented process. Neither is it 'logical', nor 'mechanical'.&lt;ref&gt;Maciej Koszowski, "Legal Analogy as an Alternative to the Deductive Mode of Legal Reasoning." The Indonesian Journal of International &amp; Comparative Law no 1/2017: 76-81.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maciej Koszowski, "Intricacies, Fallacy and Madness of Legal Deduction." Archiv für Rechts- und Sozialphilosophie no. 4/2017: 496-502.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Labor Relations Act of 1935''' (49 Stat. 449) {{usc|29|151–169}} (also known as the '''Wagner Act''' after New York Senator [[Robert F. Wagner]]&lt;ref&gt;See also {{USPL|74|198}}, {{USStat|49|449}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a foundational statute of [[United States labor law]] which guarantees basic rights of private sector employees to organize into [[trade union]]s, engage in [[collective bargaining]] for better terms and conditions at work, and take [[collective action]] including [[strike action|strike]] if necessary. The act also created the [[National Labor Relations Board]], which [[NLRB election procedures|conducts elections]] that can expect employers to engage in collective bargaining with [[Labor history of the United States|labor unions]] (also known as trade unions). The Act does not apply to workers who are covered by the [[Railway Labor Act]], agricultural employees, domestic employees, supervisors, federal, state or local government workers, independent contractors and some close relatives of individual employers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last2=Phelps|first2=Shirelle|last1=Lehman|first1=Jeffrey|title=West's Encyclopedia of American Law|year=2005|publisher=Thomson/Gale|location=Detroit|isbn=978-0-7876-6367-4|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
{{see also|Inequality of bargaining power}}
Under section 1 ({{usc|29|151}}) of the Act, the key principles and policy findings on which the Act was based are explained. The Act aims to correct the "[[inequality of bargaining power]] between employees who, according to the Act's proponents, do not possess full [[freedom of association]] or actual [[liberty of contract]] and employers who are organized in the corporate or other forms of ownership association". To achieve this, the central idea is the promotion of collective bargaining between independent trade unions, on behalf of the workforce, and the employer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Our Documents: 100 Milestone Documents from the National Archives|year=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-530959-1|pages=162–63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|encouraging the practice and procedure of collective bargaining and by protecting the exercise by workers of full freedom of association, self-organization, and designation of representatives of their own choosing, for the purpose of negotiating the terms and conditions of their employment or other mutual aid or protection.}}

Various definitions are explained in section 2, ({{usc|29|152}}) including 2(5) defining "labor organization" and 2(9) defining "labor dispute". The Act aims to protect employees as a group, and so is not based on a formal or legal relationship between an employer and employee.&lt;ref&gt;See also, E Dannin, "Not a Limited, Confined, or Private Matter: Who is an Employee under the National Labor Relations Act" (2008) 59 ''Labor Law Journal'' 5&lt;/ref&gt;

===Enforcement===
{{main|National Labor Relations Board}}
The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), which was established in NLRA 1935 sections 3 to 6 ({{usc|29|153–156}}), is the primary enforcer of the Act. Employees and unions may act themselves in support of their rights, however because of [[collective action problems]] and the costs of litigation, the National Labor Relations Board is designed to assist and bear some of the costs. Under section 3, ({{usc|29|153}}) the NLRB has two basic functions: overseeing the process by which employees decide whether to be represented by a labor organization and prosecuting violations. Those processes are initiated in the regional offices of the NLRB.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nlrb.gov/About_Us/locating_our_offices/] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130530090543/http://www.nlrb.gov/About_Us/locating_our_offices/ |date=May 30, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The General Counsel of the National Labor Relations Board give legal advice. Sections 4 ({{usc|29|154}}) and 5 ({{usc|29|155}}) set out provisions on the officers of the Board and their expenses. Section 6 ({{usc|29|156}}) empowers the Board to issue rules interpreting the labor legislation. This will generally be binding, unless a court deems it to have acted outside its authority.

Under section 10 ({{usc|29|160}}) the NLRB is empowered to prevent unfair labor practices, which may ultimately be reviewed by the courts. Under section 11 it can lead investigations, collect evidence, issue [[subpoena]]s, and require witnesses to give evidence. Under section 12 ({{usc|29|162}}) it is an offense for people to unduly interfere with the Board's conduct.

===Collectively bargaining===
{{see also|Collective bargaining}}
Section 7 ({{usc|29|157}}) sets out the general principle that employees have the right to join a trade union and engage in collective bargaining.

{{quote|Employees shall have the right to self-organization, to form, join, or assist labor organizations, to bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing, and to engage in other concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection, and shall also have the right to refrain from any or all of such activities except to the extent that such right may be affected by an agreement requiring membership in a labor organization as a condition of employment as authorized in section 8(a)(3).}}

Specific rules in support of collective bargaining are as follows.
* There can be only one exclusive bargaining representative for a unit of employees.
* Promotion of the practice and procedure of collective bargaining.
* Employers are compelled to bargain with the representative of its employees.
* Employees are allowed to discuss wages.&lt;ref name="Salary and Benefit Discussions Among Employees"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.twc.state.tx.us/news/efte/salary_discussions.html |title=Salary and Benefit Discussions Among Employees |accessdate=2012-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Where Does NLRA Apply?"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.payscale.com/compensation/2011/05/where-does-nlra-apply.html |title=Where Does NLRA Apply? |accessdate=2012-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Know Your Rights"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kclabor.org/kyrmpp.htm |title=Know Your Rights |accessdate=2012-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unfair labor practices===
{{main|Unfair labor practice}}
{{quote box|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|width=22em|salign=right|quote="Employees shall have the right to self-organization, to form, join, or assist labor organizations, to bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing, and to engage in other concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection, and shall also have the right to refrain from any or all of such activities except to the extent that such right may be affected by an agreement requiring membership in a labor organization as a condition of employment as authorized in section 158 (a)(3) of this title."|source=National Labor Relations Act of 1935 §[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/157 7]}}
Under section 8 ({{usc|29|158}}) the law defines a set of prohibited actions by employers, employees, and unions, known as an unfair labor practice.&lt;ref&gt;Initially there were five, now there are eight categories. See RL Hogler, ''The Employment Relationship: Law and Policy'' (Ardsley 1989) 52. See also ''Our Documents: 100 Milestone Documents from the National Archives'' (OUP 2003) 163&lt;/ref&gt; The first five unfair labor practices aimed at employers are in section 8(a). These are,
* (a)(1) "to interfere with, restrain, or coerce employees in the exercise of the rights guaranteed in section 7". This includes [[freedom of association]], mutual aid or protection, self-organization, to form, join, or assist labor organizations, to bargain collectively for wages and working conditions through representatives of their own choosing, and to engage in other protected concerted activities with or without a union.
* (a)(2) "to dominate or interfere with the formation or administration of any labor organization or contribute financial or other support to it"
* (a)(3) "by discrimination in regard to hire or tenure of employment or any term or condition of employment to encourage or discourage membership in any labor organization"
* (a)(4) discriminating against employees who file charges or testify.
* (a)(5) refusing to bargain collectively with the representative of the employer's employees.

In addition, added by the [[Taft–Hartley Act]], there are seven unfair labor practices aimed at unions and employees.

===Election of bargaining representatives===
{{main|NLRB election procedures}}
Under section 9 ({{usc|29|159}}) the people elected by a majority of the workforce have the right to become the exclusive representatives of workers in collective bargaining with the employer.

===Exclusions===
The NLRA 1935 does not cover two main groups of employees: those working for the government, and in the railway or airline industries. Section 2(2) (29 USC §152(2)) states that the Act does not apply to employees of the "United States or any wholly owned Government corporation, or any [[Federal Reserve Bank]], or any State or political subdivision thereof, or any person subject to the [[Railway Labor Act]]". Under section 19 ({{usc|29|169}}), people who have religious convictions against joining a trade union are entitled to not associate or financially support it.

It also excludes domestic workers and farm workers. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;The Social Security Act of 1935 excluded from coverage about half the workers in the American economy. Among the excluded groups were agricultural and domestic workers—a large percentage of whom were African Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=DeWitt|first1=|title=The Decision to Exclude Agricultural and Domestic Workers from the 1935 Social Security Act|url=https://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/ssb/v70n4/v70n4p49.html|website=Social Security Administration|date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Reactions==
{{quote box|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|width=22em|salign=right|quote="Nothing in this subchapter, except as specifically provided for herein, shall be construed so as either to interfere with or impede or diminish in any way the [[right to strike]], or to affect the limitations or qualifications on that right."|source=[[Wagner Act 1935]] §[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/157 13]}}
The act was bitterly opposed by the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] and business groups. The [[American Liberty League]] viewed the act as a threat to freedom and engaged in a campaign of opposition in order to repeal these "socialist" efforts. This included encouraging employers to refuse to comply with the NLRB and supporting the nationwide filing of injunctions to keep the NLRB from functioning. This campaign continued until the NLRA was found constitutional by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] in ''[[National Labor Relations Board v. Jones &amp; Laughlin Steel Corporation]]'' (1937).

Labor groups, while overwhelmingly supportive, expressed a set of reservations. The [[American Federation of Labor]] and some employers accused the NLRB of favoring the [[Congress of Industrial Organizations]], particularly when determining whether to hold union elections in plant-wide, or wall-to-wall, units, which the CIO usually sought, or to hold separate elections in separate craft units, which the craft unions in the AFL favored. While the NLRB initially favored plant-wide units, which tacitly favored the CIO's [[industrial unionism]], it retreated to a compromise position several years later under pressure from Congress that allowed craft unions to seek separate representation of smaller groups of workers at the same time that another union was seeking a wall-to-wall unit.

Employers and their allies in Congress also criticized the NLRA for its expansive definition of "employee" and for allowing supervisors and plant guards to form unions, sometimes affiliated with the unions that represented the employees whom they were supposed to supervise or police. Many accused the NLRB of a general pro-union and anti-employer bias, pointing to the Board's controversial decisions in such areas as employer free speech and "mixed motive" cases, in which the NLRB held that an employer violated the Act by using misconduct that ordinarily would not result in termination to fire an employee who was engaged in pro-union activity. In addition, employers campaigned over the years to outlaw a number of union practices such as [[closed shop]]s, [[secondary boycott]]s, [[jurisdictional strike]]s, mass picketing, strikes in violation of contractual no-strike clauses, pension and health and welfare plans sponsored by unions and [[multi-employer bargaining]].

Many of these criticisms included provisions that employers and their allies were unable to have included in the NLRA. Others developed in reaction to NLRB decisions. Over all, they wanted the NLRB to be neutral as to bargaining power, but the NLRA's policy section takes a decidedly pro-employee position:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is declared to be the policy of the United States to eliminate the causes of certain substantial obstructions to the free flow of commerce and to mitigate and eliminate these obstructions when they have occurred ''by encouraging the practice and procedure of collective bargaining and by protecting the exercise by workers of full freedom of association, self-organization, and designation of representatives of their own choosing, for the purpose of negotiating the terms and conditions of their employment or other mutual aid or protection''.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some of these changes were later achieved in the 1947 amendments.

==Amendments==
{{main|Right-to-work law}}
Opponents of the Wagner Act introduced several hundred bills to amend or repeal the law in the decade after its passage. All of them failed or were vetoed until the passage of the [[Labor Management Relations Act of 1947]], or the Taft–Hartley Act, in 1947.

More recent unsuccessful efforts included attempts in 1978 to permit triple backpay awards and union collective bargaining certification based on signed union authorization cards, a provision that is similar to one of the proposed amendments in the [[Employee Free Choice Act]]. Under the NLRA, unions can become the representative based on signed union authorization cards only if the employer voluntarily recognizes the union. If the employer refuses to recognize the union, the union can be certified through a secret-ballot election conducted by the NLRB.

'''Oleksandr Oksentiyovych Shevchenko''' ({{lang-uk|Олександр Оксеньтійович Шевченко}}; 26 June 1937 – 15 January 2016) was a Ukrainian scientist, jurist, politician, and doctor of legal sciences.

Shevchenko was born on June 26, 1937 in [[sovkhoz]] Partizany, [[Simferopol Raion]], [[Russian SFSR]]. He graduated from the historic-philosophy faculty of [[Kiev University]] in 1965. Shevchenko obtained his doctorate in 1995. After graduation, he worked at [[Dnipropetrovsk National University]] and as an English language interpreter during construction of a metallurgy plant in [[Egypt]]. Since 1971 Shevchenko has worked at [[Kiev University]].

In the October [[Ukrainian parliamentary election, 2014|2014 parliamentary election]] Shevchenko was 31st on the election list of his party; since the party came 0.29% short to overcome the 5% threshold to win seats on the nationwide list he was not elected into parliament.&lt;ref name="allcountedCECIU81114"&gt;[http://utr.tv/eng/news-from-www-ukrinform-ua/327072-poroshenko_bloc_to_have_greatest_number_of_seats_in_parliament_327072.html Poroshenko Bloc to have greatest number of seats in parliament] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141110220835/http://utr.tv/eng/news-from-www-ukrinform-ua/327072-poroshenko_bloc_to_have_greatest_number_of_seats_in_parliament_327072.html |date=2014-11-10 }}, [[Ukrainian Television and Radio]] (8 November 2014)&lt;br /&gt;[http://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/233404.html People's Front 0.33% ahead of Poroshenko Bloc with all ballots counted in Ukraine elections - CEC], [[Interfax-Ukraine]] (8 November 2014)&lt;br /&gt;[http://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/233426.html Poroshenko Bloc to get 132 seats in parliament - CEC], [[Interfax-Ukraine]] (8 November 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{uk icon}} [http://www.pravda.com.ua/articles/2014/10/3/7039669/ Party list All-Ukrainian Union "Freedom"], [[Ukrayinska Pravda]] (3 October 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1192">The '''Police Reservists Act 1902''' (2 Edw 7 c. 10) was an [[Act of Parliament]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]], given the royal assent on 22 July 1902 and repealed shortly thereafter.

It provided that if a [[police constable]] was called out for permanent service in the [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Army Reserve]] as a result of the proclamation of 7 October 1899 (embodying the reserves for the [[South African War]]), the police authority was empowered to count any time served in the Reserve as time spent in police service for the purpose of pensions awarded under the [[Police Act 1890]] or the [[Police (Scotland) Act 1890]].

The Act was repealed by the [[Police (Superannuation) Act 1906]] in so far as it applied to England and Wales, and by the [[Police (Scotland) Act (1890) Amendment Act 1910]] for the residue applying to Scotland.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12439">{{Canadian politics}}
The '''Public Service Commission of Canada''' ('''PSC'''; {{lang-fr|Commission de la fonction publique du Canada}}) is an independent government agency that safeguards merit-based hiring, non-partisanship, representativeness of Canada's diversity and the use of both official languages (English and French) in the Canadian public service. The PSC aims to protect the integrity of hiring and promotion within the public service. As well, the Commission works to protect the political impartiality and non-partisanship of public servants. The Commission develops staffing policies and provides guidance to public service managers and recruits Canadians into the public service. To ensure the staffing system in the government is properly maintained, the PSC has the authority to audit and investigate to ensure departments and managers make improvements. While typical government departments are headed by Ministers, the PSC is an independent agency that is headed by a President (currently Patrick Borbey) who reports to the Canadian Parliament.

==Mandate and goals==
The PSC has the mandate to appoint people to the public service, and to promote people within the government which can in turn be delegated to deputy heads (often referred to as Deputy Ministers in Canada).  The PSC can also assist government departments with recruitment and assessment services.
The PSC oversees the integrity of the hiring and promotion system, and makes sure that the hiring process is not compromised by partisan interference from elected officials. Part of this overseeing role involves collecting and analyzing data on hiring and promotion in the public service (e.g., hiring of different groups, by region, by department). As well, the PSC performs audits across the staffing system, examining  hiring and promotion files, to ensure that employees are hired and promoted based on merit. Lastly, the PSC administers the Part VII of ''Public Service Employment Act'' that recognizes the rights of public service employees to engage in political activities while maintaining the principle of political impartiallity in the public service.
  
The mission of the PSC is to achieve "A highly competent, non-partisan and representative Public Service, able to provide services in both official languages and in which employment practices are characterized by fairness, access, representativeness and transparency

==Program Activities==
The PSC has set out four program activities that are done to reach its strategic outcome:

*The Appointment Integrity and Political Neutrality activity (policies and standards on safeguarding the integrity of hiring and promotion and political neutrality issues)
*The Oversight of Integrity of Staffing and Political Neutrality (makes sure that the integrity of public service hiring and promotion is protected and safeguards the political neutrality of public servants)
*The Staffing Services and Assessment activity (provides managers with tools to help them assess and select employment applicants).
*The Internal Services program activity (corporate management and planning frameworks for the Management Accountability Framework, finance, internal staff, information technology, communications, and other administrative and general support).

==Public Service Employment Act==
The 2003 ''Public Service Employment Act'' (which came into force on December 31, 2005) emphasizes the values of merit, non-partisanship, fairness, access, transparency and representativeness.

Merit refers to the use of essential qualifications during the hiring and promotion process. This means that people who are hired and promoted in the public service must possess certain competencies, skills, and experience (merit), rather than based on political connections or partisan affiliations (political patronage). The merit principle requires that every person who is appointed to the public service has met the essential qualifications and requirements established for the position. The essential requirements can include official language proficiency, asset qualifications, operational requirements (e.g., availability to do shift work or work on weekends), and organizational needs (e.g., need to increase the hiring of women) that have been identified by the head of a department or agency.

Non-partisanship means that appointments of people to the public service (and promotions of public servants )have to be made without political influence from Ministers or partisan officials. Although Canadian public servants were disallowed any involvement in political activities in their private time throughout much of the 20th century, in 1967, legislative changes allowed public servants to request permission to take leave without pay to run in an election. In 1991, a Supreme Court decision gave public servants the right to engage in political activities. The 2003 Public Service Employment Act clarified what political activities public servants are allowed to engage in.

Public servants can engage in political activities such as supporting a candidate in an election or taking leave without pay to run in an election, but they have to maintain their political impartiality as public servants. In order to comply with the non-partisanship values in the Act, public servants must only do the types of political activities that do not conflict or impair their ability to fulfill their responsibilities in a politically impartial manner. The type and degree of political activities that a public servant can engage in depends on several factors, such as the visibility of the political activities that the public servant wants to engage in and the visibility of the public servant in their job in the public service.

==Historical timeline==
* Before [[responsible government]], Canada had no real civil service; government officials were appointed by either [[the Crown]] or its [[Provinces and territories of Canada|provincial]] representatives. These officials usually served for an unspecified period ("during the pleasure of the Crown") for as long as they were deemed fit for the position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://faculty.marianopolis.edu/c.belanger/quebechistory/encyclopedia/Civilservice-CanadianHistory.htm|title=Civil Service in Canada|accessdate=2007-07-20|publisher=Marionopolis College}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1849 - when responsible government began in 1849, there was a recognition that the roles of the political and non-political government officials needed to be defined and distinguished from one another.
* 1868 - the ''Canada Civil Service Act'' was enacted &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psc-cfp.gc.ca/research/timeline/psc_timeline_e.htm|title=A Timeline of the Public Service Commission of Canada|accessdate=2007-07-23|publisher=Public Service Commission of Canada |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070703131234/http://www.psc-cfp.gc.ca/research/timeline/psc_timeline_e.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* The "Civil Service Act" of 1882 created a process for examining candidates for the civil service, with a Board of Civil Service Examiners
* 1908 - the ''Civil Service Amendment Act'' created the Civil Service Commission, an independent body to oversee appointments to government positions in Ottawa (this was called the "inside service", in contrast to the public service outside the capital).
* The ''[[Civil Service Act 1918]]'' set in place merit-based appointments and reinforced the independence of the Commission. It also brought the "outside service" (the public service outside of Ottawa) under the domain of the Commission, along with greater oversight with regards to appointments and promotions for members of the "inside service".&lt;ref&gt;[[Alasdair Roberts (academic)|Roberts, Alasdair]]. ''So-Called Experts: How American Consultants Remade the Canadian Civil Service, 1918-1921''.  Institute of Public Administration of Canada, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1920s - the Commission developed its competitive system of examinations for appointment and [[Promotion (rank)|promotion]] (a merit system) as a viable alternative to the [[patronage]] system.
* 1921 - formal restrictions were placed against the employment of married women. Women already holding permanent positions who married had to resign. These restrictions were not removed until 1955.
* 1924 - The Civil Service Superannuation Act was intended to promote and protect a career civil service.
* 1932 - staff control regulations are established and Treasury Board is given authority over the Civil Service Commission's staffing responsibilities.
* 1949 - the number of [[World War II]] veterans assigned to positions in the civil service under the statutory veterans preference rises to 55,000.
* 1951 - The Financial Administration Act of 1951 provided final authority to the Treasury Board for management (administration and organization) of the public service.
* 1957 - The CSC establishes the Pay Research Bureau to provide objective information on rates of pay and conditions of employment in government and industry, and to recommend salary rates for civil servants.
* 1961 - The new Civil Service Act of 1961 gave civil servants the right of appeal against not only promotions, but also transfers, demotions, suspensions and dismissals.
* 1962 - The Government adopted recommendations by the [[Royal Commission on Government Organization]] (Glassco Commission) on the management of the Public Service, including delegating authority to departments to manage their own personnel and to be held accountable for efficient performance.
* 1966 - [[Multilingualism|Bilingualism]] becomes an element of merit in the national capital area.
* 1967 - Public Service Employment Act (PSEA) and Public Service Staff Relations Act (PSSRA) come into effect. The PSEA gave the renamed Public Service Commission the responsibility for all the elements of the staffing process. The PSSRA created a [[collective bargaining]] regime in the civil service.
* early 1970s - rapid expansion of the public service.
* Late 1970s - significant reduction of public service.
* 1979 - The Bilingualism Bonus was introduced for public servants who met the bilingual language requirements of their positions.
* 1984 - the Commission on Equality in Employment issued its report, which recommended that targets and not quotas are the most effective means of achieving equity in the employment of members of under-represented groups.
* 1986 - further employment layoff programs again reduce the public service.
* 1992 - Public Service Reform Act amends both the PSEA and the Public Service Staff Relations Act. This provides more flexibility for managers to respond quickly to changing operational needs or to allow employees to acquire new skills. The Act also enabled the PSC to prescribe standards of competence to measure merit.
* 1995 - a restraint-focused federal budget leads to further reductions in the size of the civil service.
* Late 1990s and early 2000s - rapid growth of the public service
* 2003 - a new Public Service Employment Act, which created the first legislative definition of merit (it also redefined merit)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10932">The title of '''senior counsel''' or '''state counsel''' ([[post-nominal letters]]: '''SC''') is given to a senior [[lawyer]] in some countries that were formerly part of the [[British Empire]]. "Senior Counsel" is used in current or former [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries or jurisdictions that have chosen to change the title "[[Queen's Counsel]]" to a name without monarchical connotations, sometimes (but not always) because the British monarch is no longer head of state, such that reference to the Queen is no longer appropriate. Examples of jurisdictions which have made the change because of the latter reason include  Mauritius, Zambia, [[India]], [[Hong Kong]], the [[Republic of Ireland]], [[South Africa]], [[Kenya]], [[Malawi]], [[Singapore]], [[Guyana]] and [[Trinidad and Tobago]]. Just as a '''junior counsel''' is "[[Call to the Bar|called to the [Outer] Bar]]", a senior counsel is, in some jurisdictions, said to be "'''called to the Inner Bar'''". Senior counsel may informally style themselves as ''silks'', like their British counterparts. This is the case in Ireland, Australia, Hong Kong and South Africa.

A second usage, prevalent in the United Kingdom itself (which retains the separate and distinct Queen's Counsel title for barristers) refers to a [[solicitor]] who is senior and autonomous, but is neither a partner nor on the career path to partnership. 

== Dress ==

[[Image:QC Court robes.jpg|thumb|200px|An example of dress in court]]

In Hong Kong, senior counsel (both men and women) must wear the black robe and silk gown together with a wig when appearing in open court.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hkba.org/the-bar/code-of-conduct/code_of_conducta11.htm Code of Conduct Annex 11] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091003114150/http://www.hkba.org/the-bar/code-of-conduct/code_of_conducta11.htm |date=3 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Republic of Ireland, senior counsel wear a silk gown which differs from that of a Junior Counsel. The wig is optional in the Republic of Ireland.

== Australia ==

The rank of senior counsel has also been introduced in most [[states of Australia|states and territories]] of [[Australia]], even though [[Monarchy of Australia|the Queen remains head of state]]. Between 1993 and 2008 all Australian jurisdictions except the [[Northern Territory]] replaced the rank of Queen's Counsel with that of senior counsel. However, in 2013 [[Queensland]] restored the rank of Queen's Counsel and there was talk of other Australian states following suit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/legal-affairs/states-divide-over-restoration-of-queens-counsel-title/story-e6frg97x-1226663452676|title=States divide over restoration of 'Queen's Counsel' title |publisher=theaustralian.com.au |date= |accessdate=2013-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 3 February 2014, the Victorian Attorney-General announced that the rank of Queen's Counsel would shortly be reinstated in Victoria, with existing and future senior counsel having the option to apply to be issued with letters patent appointing them as Queen's Counsel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vicbar.com.au/GetFile.ashx?file=MembersFiles/140203+Clark+-+Victoria+to+give+senior+barristers+option+to+become+QCs+_(media+release).pdf Victoria to give senior barristers option to become QCs]{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The formal difference appears to be that QCs receive a warrant signed by the relevant State Governor, who is the formal representative of the Head of State,  whereas SCs receive a certificate issued by the relevant Bar Association or bureaucracy such as by the judicature of the State Supreme Court as the case may be.

== Hong Kong ==

"Senior Counsel" ({{zh|t=資深大律師}}&lt;ref name="zaobao"&gt;[http://chineseterms.zaobao.com/gov/gov_agc1.html Translation Standardisation Committee for the Chinese Media, Singapore] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040417195207/http://chineseterms.zaobao.com/gov/gov_agc1.html |date=17 April 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) replaced QC in the [[law of Hong Kong]] after the [[transfer of the sovereignty of Hong Kong]] from the [[United Kingdom]] to [[People's Republic of China|China]] in 1997. [[Queen's Counsel]] who had been appointed QC in HK or British Queen's Counsel who had been admitted to practice in Hong Kong generally prior to the handover became senior counsel automatically.&lt;ref&gt;See the savings and transitional provisions contained in s. 2 of Schedule 2 to Ordinance No. 94 of 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

Queen's Counsel from England or other senior counsel from other jurisdictions are not accorded any precedence if they are admitted generally in Hong Kong. However, visiting Queen's Counsel from another jurisdiction who have been admitted for a specific case are entitled to use the title, and to be accorded the status, of senior counsel for the purposes of those proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;Legal Practitioner's Ordinance, S.31B&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ireland ==

The [[Irish Free State]] became independent in 1922 as a [[dominion]] of the British Crown. Shortly after the [[Courts of Justice Act 1924]] came into effect, [[Chief Justice of Ireland|Chief Justice]] [[Hugh Kennedy]] in conjunction with the [[Bar Council of Ireland]] modified the procedure for issuing [[patent of precedence|patents of precedence]]. From July 1924, "King's Counsel" was replaced by "Senior Counsel" on patents;&lt;ref name="dail19490224"&gt;[http://debates.oireachtas.ie/dail/1949/02/24/00005.asp Vol.114 No.4 cols.493–5] 24 February 1949&lt;/ref&gt; these were issued by the chief justice,&lt;ref name="dail19490224"/&gt; although the "privilege of patent" continued to fall within the [[royal prerogative]] until transferred to the [[Executive Council of the Irish Free State|Executive Council]] (government) by the [[Executive Powers (Consequential Provisions) Act 1937]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oireachtas-debates.gov.ie/D/0521/D.0521.200006130070.html Dáil deb Vol.521 c.191–2] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110609131200/http://www.oireachtas-debates.gov.ie/D/0521/D.0521.200006130070.html |date=9 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1937/en/act/pub/0020/sec0002.html §2, Executive Powers (Consequential Provisions) Act, 1937] Irish Statute Book&lt;/ref&gt; The title "KC" continued to be used by many senior counsels, both those created before July 1924 and those after.&lt;ref name="dail19490224"/&gt;

In 1949, shortly before the coming into force of the [[Republic of Ireland Act 1948]] which broke the final link with the [[The Crown|British Crown]], [[Frank Aiken]] asked [[John A. Costello]] during [[Question Time|Taoiseach's questions]] "whether, in view of the fact that certain members of the Inner Bar who received their patents as senior counsel continue to describe themselves as king's counsel, he will introduce a bill entitled an act to declare that the description of a senior counsel shall be senior counsel"; Costello said he had "no intention of wasting public time and money" on the idea.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail1949032300004?opendocument] 23 March 1949&lt;/ref&gt;

As late as the 1960s, R. G. L. Leonard was described in the official Irish [[law report]]s as "Queen’s Counsel",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hall|first=Eamonn|date=April 2005|title=The ancien régime|journal=Law Society Gazette|publisher=[[Law Society of Ireland]]|volume=99|issue=3|page=14|url=http://www.lawsociety.ie/Documents/Gazette/Gazette%202005/april2005.pdf#page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; reflecting the British change from [[George VI|King]] to [[Elizabeth II|Queen]] in 1952.

== New Zealand ==

The title "Senior Counsel" was briefly established in [[New Zealand]] from 2007 until 2009. It was abolished by the following government in favour of restoring the title of Queen's Counsel on the basis of the respect felt accorded to those appointed Queen's Counsel. Those appointed as senior counsel have been given the option of becoming Queen's Counsel or remaining as senior counsel.

== Singapore ==

"Senior Counsel" ({{zh|s=高级律师}}&lt;ref name="zaobao"/&gt;) is used in the [[law of Singapore]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sal.org.sg/Lists/Senior%20Counsel%20Directory/AllItems.aspx|title=Senior Counsel Directory|publisher=Singapore Academy of Law|accessdate=8 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no independent bar in Singapore and senior counsel practice as members of law firms.

== South Africa ==

"Senior Counsel" (in [[Afrikaans]] Senior Advokaat) replaced QC in [[South Africa]] after the [[Union of South Africa|union]] became a [[republic]] in 1961, with appointments being made by the [[State President of South Africa|state president]] until 1994, when the office was succeeded by that of [[President of South Africa|president]]. A judge in the high court in the province of [[Gauteng]] ruled that under the 1993 [[Constitution of South Africa|constitution]], the president did not have the power to grant senior counsel status.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mg.co.za/article/2012-02-09-court-rules-president-cannot-grant-senior-counsel-status Court rules president cannot grant senior counsel status], ''[[Mail and Guardian]]'', 9 February 2012&lt;/ref&gt; This judgment has been overturned by the supreme court of appeal and also the constitutional court. See [[Advocate#Advocates in South Africa]].

== United Kingdom ==

In the United Kingdom, the position of Senior Counsel is used to denote an experienced solicitor (who need not be an advocate), who is not on the path to partnership. This position is therefore analogous to the American title [[of counsel]], and is not directly comparable to the position of Queen's Counsel, which is held by barristers.

== Similar titles ==

Other jurisdictions have adopted similar titles:

* Senior Advocate under the [[law of Bangladesh]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Advocate|title=Advocate|work=banglapedia.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[law of India|laws of India]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.sci.nic.in/constitution.htm |title=Supreme Court of India |access-date=1 December 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161201210904/http://www.sci.nic.in/constitution.htm |archive-date=1 December 2016 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[law of Pakistan]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.pbbarcouncil.com/downloads/barcouncil_act_amended_2005.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=9 November 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120405104651/http://www.pbbarcouncil.com/downloads/barcouncil_act_amended_2005.pdf |archive-date=5 April 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and that of [[Nigeria]] (see [[Senior Advocate of Nigeria]]).

A '''shill''', also called a '''plant''' or a '''stooge''', is a person who publicly helps or gives credibility to a person or organization without disclosing that they have a close relationship with the person or organization. Shills can carry out their operations in the areas of media, journalism, marketing, politics, [[confidence game]]s, or other business areas. A shill may also act to discredit opponents or critics of the person or organization in which they have a vested interest through [[character assassination]] or other means.

In most uses, ''shill'' refers to someone who purposely gives onlookers, participants or "marks" the impression of an enthusiastic customer independent of the seller, marketer or con artist, for whom they are secretly working. The person or group in league with the shill relies on [[crowd psychology]] to encourage other onlookers or audience members to do business with the seller or accept the ideas they are promoting.  Shills may be employed by salespeople and professional marketing campaigns. ''Plant'' and ''stooge'' more commonly refer to a person who is secretly in league with another person or outside organization while pretending to be neutral or a part of the organization in which they are planted, such as a magician's audience, a political party, or an intelligence organization (see [[double agent]]).{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

Shilling is illegal in many circumstances and in many jurisdictions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |url=http://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/cases-proceedings/x030044/greeting-cards-america-inc-et-al |litigants=FTC v. Greeting Cards of America, Inc. et al – USA |court=S.D. Fla. |date=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; because of the potential for [[fraud]] and damage; however, if a shill does not place uninformed parties at a risk of loss, but merely generates "buzz", the shill's actions may be legal. For example, a person planted in an audience to laugh and applaud when desired (see [[claque]]), or to participate in on-stage activities as a "random member of the audience", is a type of legal shill.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} ''Shill'' can also be used pejoratively to describe a critic who appears either all-too-eager to heap glowing praise upon mediocre offerings, or who acts as an [[apologist]] for glaring flaws.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

==Etymology==
The origin of the term "shill" is uncertain; it may be an abbreviation of "shillaber". The word originally denoted a carnival worker who pretended to be a member of the audience in an attempt to elicit interest in an attraction. Some sources trace the usage back to 1914.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/shill |entry=shill |encyclopedia=The Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-Webster, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Note: Shillaber as a surname was known in the US during the 19th century.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Internet ==
{{See also|Conflict-of-interest editing on Wikipedia}}
In online discussion media, satisfied consumers or "innocent" parties may express specific opinions in order to further the interests of an organization in which they have an interest, such as a commercial [[vendor]] or [[Advocacy group|special interest group]]. In academia, this is called ''opinion spamming''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |url=http://www.cs.uic.edu/~liub/FBS/opinion-spam-WSDM-08.pdf |title=Opinion Spam and Analysis |author1=Nitin Jindal |author2=Bing Liu |booktitle=Proceedings of the ACM International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining (WSDM-2008) |date=2008 |ISBN=978-1-59593-927-2 |pages=219–230 |doi=10.1145/1341531.1341560}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Web sites]] can also be set up for the same purpose. For example, an employee of a company that produces a specific product might praise the product anonymously in a discussion forum or group in order to generate interest in that product, service, or group. In addition, some shills use "[[Sockpuppet (Internet)|sock puppetry]]", where they sign on as one user soliciting recommendations for a specific product or service. They then sign on as a different user pretending to be a satisfied customer of a specific company.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

In some [[jurisdiction]]s and circumstances, this type of activity is illegal. The plastic surgery company Lifestyle Lift ordered their employees to post fake positive reviews on websites. As a result, they were sued, and ordered to pay $300,000 in damages by the New York Attorney General's office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title= Attorney General Cuomo Secures Settlement With Plastic Surgery Franchise That Flooded Internet With False Positive Reviews |url=http://www.ag.ny.gov/press-release/attorney-general-cuomo-secures-settlement-plastic-surgery-franchise-flooded-internet |date=July 14, 2009 |publisher= [[New York Attorney General|Office of the New York State Attorney General]] |accessdate= 2016-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reputable organizations may prohibit their employees and other interested parties (contractors, agents, etc.) from participating in public forums or discussion groups in which a [[conflict of interest]] might arise, or will at least insist that their employees and agents refrain from participating in any way that might create a conflict of interest.

== Gambling ==
Both the illegal and legal [[gambling]] industries often use shills to make winning at games appear more likely than it actually is. For example, illegal [[Three-card Monte|three-card monte]] and [[Shell game|shell-game]] peddlers are notorious employers of shills. These shills also often aid in cheating, disrupting the game if the ''[[mark (victim)|mark]]'' is likely to win. In a legal casino, however, a shill is sometimes a gambler who plays using the casino's money in order to keep games (especially poker) going when there are not enough players. The title of one of [[Erle Stanley Gardner]]'s mystery novels, ''Shills Can't Cash Chips'', is derived from this type of shill. This is different from "[[Glossary of poker terms#prop|proposition player]]s" who are paid a salary by the casino for the same purpose, but bet with their own money.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

== Marketing ==
{{See also|Astroturfing}}

In marketing, shills are often employed to assume the air of satisfied customers and give [[testimonial]]s to the merits of a given product. This type of shilling is illegal in some jurisdictions, but almost impossible to detect. It may be considered a form of [[unjust enrichment]] or [[unfair business practices|unfair competition]], as in [[California law|California's Business &amp; Professions Code]] § 17200, which prohibits any "unfair or fraudulent business act or practice and unfair, deceptive, untrue or misleading [[advertising]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Balough Dancey |first1=Cheryl |title=A survey of False Advertising In Cyberspace |journal=The Business Lawyer |date=November 2012 |volume=68 |pages=297–304 |jstor=23527095}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Auctions ==
Shills, or "potted plants", are sometimes employed in auctions. Driving prices up with phony bids, they seek to provoke a [[bidding]] war among other participants. Often they are told by the seller precisely how high to bid, as the seller actually pays the price (to himself, of course) if the item does not sell, losing only the auction fees. Shilling has a substantially higher rate of occurrence in [[online auction]]s, where any user with multiple accounts can bid on their own items. One detailed example of this has been documented in online auctions for used cars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |ssrn=2935389 |title=Cyber-shilling in automobile auctions | author1=David Grether | author2=David Porter | author3=Matthew Shum}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many online auction sites employ sophisticated (and usually secret) methods to detect [[collusion]]. The online auction site [[EBay#Auction-style listings|eBay]] forbids shilling; its rules do not allow friends or employees of a person selling an item to bid on the item,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/hi/technology/newsid_10500000/newsid_10508900/10508913.stm |title=Man fined over fake eBay auctions |first=Dan |last=Whitworth |publisher=BBC |date=July 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; even though eBay has no means to detect if a bidder is related to a seller or is in fact the seller.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shill Bidding Policy|url=https://pages.ebay.com/help/policies/seller-shill-bidding.html|website=Ebay|accessdate=2018-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''Fake: Forgery, Lies, &amp; eBay'', [[Kenneth Walton (writer)|Kenneth Walton]] describes how he and his cohorts placed shill bids on hundreds of eBay auctions over the course of a year. Walton and his associates were charged and convicted of fraud by the United States Attorney for their eBay shill bidding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/g2/story/0,,1835157,00.html |title=A brush with the law |last=Glaister |first=Dan |date=August 1, 2006 |newspaper=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the proliferation of live online auctions in recent years, shill bidding has become commonplace.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} Some websites allow shill bidding by participating auctioneers. These auctioneers are able to see bids placed in real time and can then place counter bids to increase the amount. One Proxibid auctioneers' website states, "At the request of the auction company, this auction permits bids to be placed by the seller or on the seller's behalf, even if such bids are placed solely for the purpose of increasing the bid."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://primestarauctions.com/tos |title=General Terms And Conditions |website=Prime Star Auctions |accessdate=2014-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term can apply to journalists, commentators, and media outlets, who have vested interests in or associations with parties, and report in a way favorable to those interests. The term is often used by antiestablishment figures to denounce the media.

== Research and experiments ==
[[File:Expérience de Milgram.png|thumb|200px|The experimenter (E) orders the teacher (S), the subject of the experiment, to give what the latter believes are painful electric shocks to a learner (A), who is actually an actor and [[wikt:confederate|confederate]]. The subject believes that for each wrong answer, the learner was receiving actual electric shocks, though in reality there were no such punishments. Being separated from the subject, the confederate set up a tape recorder integrated with the electro-shock generator, which played pre-recorded sounds for each shock level.]]
A shill in a psychology experiment, or the like, is called a "confederate". In [[Stanley Milgram]]'s [[Milgram experiment|experiment]], in which the subjects witnessed people getting electric shocks, a confederate would pretend to be one of the experimental subjects who would receive the fake shocks, so that the real experimental subject would think that a draw of names from a hat was random. The confederate would always play the role of the learner, and the subject would be the teacher, and the subject would think that this was a random draw from a hat containing papers that say [https://www.britannica.com/biography/Stanley-Milgram "learner" and "teacher"].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Rogers |first1=Kara |title=Stanley Milgram AMERICAN SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGIST |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Stanley-Milgram |website=Encyclopedia Britannica |accessdate=2018-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In performance art, such as DECONference (Decontamination Conference), the confederates were called "deconfederates". When a large group of DECONference attendees were asked to remove all clothing prior to entry to the event, the deconfederates, planted among the attendees, would comply immediately with the request, causing all of the others to follow the orders and disrobe as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |volume=36 |number=4 |date=August 2003 |work=Leonardo |issn=0024-094X |title=Decon 2 (Decon Squared): Deconstructing Decontamination |last=Mann |first=Steve |pages=285–290 |url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/leonardo/summary/v036/36.4mann.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Interrogations ==
Police or military interrogators sometimes use [[undercover agent]]s (called "plants") to assist with the [[interrogation]] of an individual or suspect. The plant can pose as a fellow inmate or internee, build a rapport and earn the confidence of the interviewee. The plant may subtly suggest that telling the interrogators what they want to know is the sensible or right thing to do. Even if no outright confessions are obtained, minor details and discrepancies that come out in supposedly innocent conversation can be used to chip away at the interviewee. Some plants are in reality inmates or [[Prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] who have been promised better treatment and conditions in return for helping with the interrogation; the character played by [[William Hurt]] in the film ''[[Kiss of the Spider Woman (film)|Kiss of the Spider Woman]] ''is an example of this. One notorious UK case is that of Colin Stagg, a man who was falsely accused of the [[murder of Rachel Nickell]], in which a female police officer posed as a potential love interest to try to tempt Stagg to implicate himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Who Really Killed Rachel? | first1 = Colin | last1 = Stagg | first2 = David | last2 = Kessler | year = 1999 | publisher = Greenzone Publishing | isbn = 978-0958202725}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Related concepts ==

=== Puppet government ===
[[Puppet state|Puppet]], [[Vassal state|vassal]], [[Quisling regime|quisling]], or [[Satellite state|satellite]] states have been routinely used in exercises of [[foreign policy]] to give weight to the arguments of the country that controls them. Examples of this include the [[USSR]]'s use of its satellites in the [[United Nations]] during the [[Cold War]]. These states are used to give the impression of legitimacy to domestic policies that are ultimately harmful to the population they control, while beneficial to the government that controls them.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

Even outside the spectrum of sovereign powers many multiparty democratic systems give foreign powers the capacity to influence political discourse through shills and pseudo sock-puppets. Thanks to the reliance of many political parties on external sources of revenue for campaigns it can be easy for a government or business to either choose which party it funds or to outright create one. This way they can either choose to support existing minority voices that echo their views or form their own, using their funds and usually semi-covert influence to make them a more prominent voice.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

Another concept in foreign policy is seen in sovereign alliances. In these instances, an allied country acts on behalf of another's interests so that it appears that the original power does not want to get involved. This is useful in situations where there is little public support in the original country for the actions. This type of collusion is typically practiced between countries that share common goals and are capable of returning favours. An example of this may be Cuba's role during the Cold War, in sending active combat troops to [[Military history of Cuba#Cuban Military Actions in Angola .281961-2002.29|wars in Africa]] when it was unpalatable for the USSR to do so.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

=== Undercover operations ===
During covert operations or police investigations agents may routinely claim to be of political views or a part of an organization in order to gain the confidence of the people they wish to surveil. Sometimes this goes further with the agents participating in acts on behalf of the organizations they infiltrate or falsely represent as was the case during the Operations like [[Operation Gladio|Gladio]] and [[Operation Chaos|Chaos]]. Often the end goal is not just to gain information about the organization but to discredit them in the eyes of the public. However, these kinds of actions are more similar to [[false flag]] operations than typical undercover operations. In other examples, operatives may act in a manner they deem positive to assist an organization to which they cannot have overt ties.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

[[File:Albania Soviet Union Locator.png|thumb|right|250px|A map depicting the locations of Albania and the Soviet Union.]]
The '''Soviet–Albanian split''' refers to the worsening of relations between the [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics]] (USSR) and the [[People's Socialist Republic of Albania]], which occurred in the 1955&amp;ndash;1961 period as a result of Soviet leader [[Nikita Khrushchev]]'s rapprochement with [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] along with his "[[On the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences|Secret Speech]]" and subsequent [[de-Stalinization]], including efforts to extend these policies into Albania as was occurring in other [[Eastern Bloc]] states at the time. The Albanian leadership under [[Enver Hoxha]] perceived Khrushchev's policies as contrary to [[Marxism–Leninism|Marxist–Leninist]] doctrine and his denunciation of [[Joseph Stalin]] as an opportunistic act meant to legitimize [[Marxist revisionism|revisionism]] within the [[International communism|international communist movement]]. Occurring within the context of the larger [[Sino-Soviet split|split between China and the USSR]], the Soviet–Albanian split culminated in the rupturing of [[Soviet-Albanian relations|relations]] in 1961.

==Origins==
The Communist Party of Albania (known as the [[Party of Labour of Albania]] after 1948) was founded in November 1941 in the context of the [[Albanian Kingdom (1939–1943)|foreign occupation]] of the country, with the majority of its members including its leader, [[Enver Hoxha]], having no connection to the [[Comintern]].{{sfn|Held|1992|p=29}} Historian [[Jon Halliday]] has commented that "it was set up without any known direct contact with Moscow. It was not at all a 'Moscow creation'&amp;nbsp;... the bulk of the founding leadership were middle-class intellectuals on whom the strongest influences were ''Western'' intellectual traditions."{{sfn|Halliday|1986|p=22}} Albania furthermore was the only country in Eastern Europe, except Greece, which had liberated itself without the presence of the [[Red Army]] on its soil.{{sfn|Held|1992|p=33}} A combination of these factors led Stalin to initially have been "both curious and suspicious about the only leader of a Communist regime in the Soviet bloc who escaped from any historical ties or contact with the Soviet Union." This, Halliday continues, "was true not just of Hoxha as an individual, but of almost the entire leading group in Albania."{{sfn|Halliday|1986|p=6}} Despite this, however, Hoxha was "the quintessential Stalinist. Many of the descriptions Nikita Khrushchev used to denounce Josef Stalin&amp;nbsp;... could easily be applied to Enver Hoxha."{{sfn|O'Donnell|1999|p=195}}

Following Albania's liberation on November 29, 1944 the country's economic and foreign policies were dominated by its neighbor [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] under the leadership of [[Josip Broz Tito]], and Albania became in the words of historian Miranda Vickers a "sub-[[Satellite state|satellite]]."{{sfn|Vickers|1999|p=173}} During this period ties with the Soviet Union remained limited, though formal diplomatic relations were established in December 1945.{{sfnm |1a1=Pano |1y=1968 |1p=86 |2a1=Omari| 2a2=Pollo |2y=1988 |2p=82}}

===Soviet–Yugoslav split===
Within the leadership of the Communist Party of Albania tensions arose between pro- and anti-Yugoslav factions and personalities, with the former increasingly coming under attack by [[Koçi Xoxe]], the head of the pro-Yugoslav faction.{{sfn|Logoreci|1977|pp=93&amp;ndash;100}} Hoxha was threatened on the basis of his opposition to the pro-Yugoslav line, as Xoxe's final goal was to overthrow Hoxha and to incorporate Albania into Yugoslavia as its Seventh Republic.{{sfn|Vickers|1999|p=173}} The [[Soviet–Yugoslav split]] in 1948, however, had allowed Albania to break from Yugoslav dominance, and it became the first state to side with the Information Bureau (better known in the West as the [[Cominform]]) with its resolution attacking the Yugoslav leadership for allegedly pursuing a road of nationalist deviation and capitalist restoration.{{sfn|Pano|1968|pp=83&amp;ndash;86}} From that point onwards relations between Albania and the Soviet Union "remained quite close until March 5, 1953," when Stalin died.{{sfn|O'Donnell|1999|p=38}} In the words of historian Nicholas C. Pano, "by the beginning of 1949, Albania had progressed from the status of a sub-satellite to that of a full-fledged satellite of the Soviet Union."{{sfn|Pano|1968|p=89}} Albania became a member of [[Comecon]] in 1949 and the [[Warsaw Pact|Warsaw Treaty]] upon its founding in 1955.{{sfn|Omari|Pollo|1988|pp=153&amp;ndash;154}} In addition the Soviets built a submarine base at [[Vlora]] in 1952.{{sfn|O'Donnell|1999|pp=37-38}}

===Stalin's death===
In his memoirs Hoxha recounts the apprehension he and others had about the post-Stalin leadership, just days after Stalin's death. "The way in which the death of Stalin was announced and his funeral ceremony was organized created the impression&amp;nbsp;... that many members of the [[Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Presidium]] of the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Central Committee]] of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] had been awaiting his death impatiently."{{sfn|Hoxha|1984|pp=13&amp;ndash;14}} A meeting with Soviet leaders held in June that year further raised his suspicions about the intentions of the new leadership, as did a reduction in Soviet and [[Eastern Bloc]] aid to Albania early in 1954 as Soviet leader [[Nikita Khrushchev]] "seemed to believe that the high cost of aid to support Albania was not worth the return in terms of Soviet strategic interests in the country."{{sfn|O'Donnell|1999|pp=38&amp;ndash;39}} Reacting to early post-Stalin Soviet pressure on the East European countries to pursue economic and political reforms, Albania announced slight changes in planning priorities and some willingness to improve state relations with Yugoslavia as the Soviets were doing.{{sfn|Pano|1968|pp=113&amp;ndash;114}} There was also a reshuffling of political portfolios in line with the Soviet re-emphasis on the principle of [[collective leadership]].{{sfn|Pano|1968|pp=113&amp;ndash;114}}

Hoxha regarded Soviet pressure as acting in the service of ulterior, [[Marxist revisionism|revisionist]] aims in an effort to unseat or otherwise undermine "Stalinist" leaders. Thus in a meeting with Khrushchev on the issue of collective leadership, he recalled that, "Khrushchev told us that the other sister parties had been told of the Soviet 'experience' of who should be first secretary of the party and who prime minister in the countries of people's democracy. 'We talked over these questions with the Polish comrades before the congress of their party,' Khrushchev told us. 'We thrashed matters out thoroughly and thought that Comrade [[Bolesław Bierut|Bierut]] should remain chairman of the Council of Ministers and Comrade [[Edward Ochab|Ochab]] should be appointed first secretary of the party&amp;nbsp;...' Hence, right from the start Khrushchev was for pushing Bierut aside in the leadership of the party&amp;nbsp;... [the Soviets] were giving the green light for all the revisionist elements, who, up till yesterday, were wriggling and keeping a low profile, awaiting the opportune moments. Now these moments were being created by Khrushchev who, with his actions, stands and 'new ideas', was becoming the inspirer and organizer of 'changes' and 'reorganizations'."{{sfn|Hoxha|1984|pp=38-39}}

==Beginnings of the split==
Jon Halliday has noted that, "On the surface, relations between Moscow and Tirana seemed good right up to the late 1950s" but that Khrushchev's rapprochement with Yugoslavia in 1955 and his denunciation of Stalin in 1956 were the two main issues responsible for the deterioration of relations between the two states.{{sfn|Halliday|1986|p=143}} In June 1954 Khrushchev sent a letter to the leaders of the parties of the Eastern Bloc in which the Cominform resolutions denouncing Yugoslavia in the 1948&amp;ndash;49 period were criticized for allegedly forcing Tito and the rest of the Yugoslav leadership "into the arms of the United States and Great Britain and had led to Yugoslavia's [[Balkan Pact (1953)|conclusion of a military pact]] with two NATO members."{{sfn|Kola|2003|p=113}} Hoxha, however, disagreed with this view, later writing that "even if the Yugoslav leadership had been unjustly condemned in 1949, as Khrushchev was claiming, nothing could permit or justify its falling into the lap of imperialism."{{sfn|Hoxha|1984|pp=110&amp;ndash;111}}

In May 1955 Khrushchev led a Soviet delegation to the Yugoslav capital of Belgrade with the aim of [[Political rehabilitation|rehabilitating]] Tito, a move which encouraged reformist and dissident trends in Eastern Europe.{{sfn|Logoreci|1977|pp=115&amp;ndash;116}} The Albanian government had received a letter two days before the Soviet delegation was to leave Moscow: in it, the Soviets requested that the Albanians approve a statement drawn up by Khrushchev in the name of the Information Bureau even though he had not convened it. The move was refused by the Albanians "on the grounds that there had been no change in the line of the Yugoslav leadership since it had been condemned by the 1948 resolution of communist and workers' parties represented on the Bureau."{{sfn|Ash|1974|p=182}} On May 25 the Central Committee of the Party of Labour sent a letter to its Soviet counterpart stating among other things that, "In our opinion such a hasty (and ill-considered) decision on an issue of great importance and of principle" was conducted "without first making a profound analysis together with all the parties interested in this issue."{{sfn|Hoxha|1984|p=122}} With only Albania among the Eastern Bloc states opposing Khrushchev's move, the Soviets succeeded in unilaterally rehabilitating Tito's standing within the international communist movement and apologized for past Soviet activities in relation to Yugoslavia.{{sfn|Kola|2003|p=114}}

===Twentieth Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union===
At the [[Twentieth Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] in February 1956 Khrushchev issued, in addition to his main report, his "[[On the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences|Secret Speech]]" denouncing Stalin. Hoxha later remarked of the Congress that, in addition to its attack on Stalin, "All the distortions of the major issues of principle, such as those about the character of our epoch, the roads of transition to socialism, peaceful coexistence, war and peace, the stand towards modern revisionism and towards imperialism, etc., etc., which later became the basis of the great, open polemic with modern revisionism, have their official beginning in Khrushchev's report to the 20th Congress&amp;nbsp;... we saw how the Khrushchevites, in order to consolidate their power, operated allegedly with 'a great party spirit', 'free from the fear of Stalin'&amp;nbsp;... Every good thing of the past was distorted, allegedly in light of the 'new situations', 'new developments', 'new roads and possibilities', in order to go ahead."{{sfn|Hoxha|1984|p=185&amp;ndash;186}}

A notable event at the Congress was the promotion of the policy of "peaceful coexistence" by Khrushchev, which officially was a policy to increase East-West collaboration against the threat of nuclear war, but which [[anti-revisionism|anti-revisionists]] believed "was merely a way to divide the world in to spheres of influence inside which each side would enjoy unquestioned supremacy."{{sfn|O'Donnell|1999|p=42}} One anti-revisionist author described Khrushchev's policy as follows: "Khrushchev made it clear that he was prepared to give up international class struggle, renouncing on behalf of the colonial peoples any right to liberate themselves from oppression and reassuring capitalist governments by emphasising 'peaceful transition to socialism' or the Parliamentary road&amp;nbsp;..." He then quoted Khrushchev as saying that "'if any mad man wanted war, we [the Soviet Union and the United States], the two strongest countries in the world, would have but to shake our fingers to warn him off.'"{{sfn|Ash|1974|pp=183&amp;ndash;184}}

=== Third Congress of the Party of Labour of Albania===
One of Tito's preconditions for improving relations with the Soviets was for a Soviet-backed removal of "Stalinist" leaders in Eastern Europe, such as [[Mátyás Rákosi]] of Hungary and [[Valko Chervenkov]] of Bulgaria; Hoxha was also an obvious target for removal due to his intransigent position on Yugoslavia.{{sfn|Griffith|1963|p=24}} The Soviets sought without success to force Hoxha to rehabilitate Koçi Xoxe.{{sfnm |1a1=Freedman |1y=1970 |1p=61 |2a1=O'Donnell|2y=1999 |2p=40 |3a1=Vickers|3y=1999 |3p=181}} In April 1956 a party conference was held in Tirana: various delegates, inspired by Khrushchev's actions, attacked the line of the Party of Labour, calling for a review of the case of Xoxe along with other political and economic policies and phenomena.{{sfn|Logoreci|1977|pp=119&amp;ndash;120}}  However, Hoxha entered the conference and managed to defeat these proposals.{{sfn|Logoreci|1977|pp=119&amp;ndash;120}} The Third Congress of the Party of Labour was convened a month later, electing a Central Committee and Politburo "composed of staunch Hoxha loyalists" while also demonstrating "Hoxha's first public defiance of the Soviet Union" by refusing to rehabilitate Xoxe and other persons linked with, or otherwise supportive of, rapprochement with Yugoslavia.{{sfn|Held|1992|p=37}}

Although the Third Party Congress did not openly criticize the 20th Party Congress of the CPSU in part because "the real aims of [the Soviets] were still not fully recognized" and there was a perceived need to keep intact the unity of the international communist movement, it did declare that the line of the Party of Labour which had been "followed up to now has been correct" and thus tacitly rejected Khrushchev's "[[de-Stalinization]]" policies.{{sfn|Omari|Pollo|1988|p=165}}

Following the [[Hungarian Uprising of 1956|Hungarian Uprising]] in November 1956 relations between Albania and the Soviet Union improved somewhat due to Yugoslavia's part in the event, which caused friction in Yugoslav-Soviet relations. On November 7 Hoxha wrote an article for ''[[Pravda]]'' denouncing Tito for encouraging the activity of the rebels, though the Soviets rebuked Hoxha for his harsh tone soon after.{{sfnm |1a1=Logoreci |1y=1977 |1p=122 |2a1=Freedman |2y=1970 |2p=62}} Soviet efforts to improve relations with Yugoslavia resumed before long, prompting a further deterioration in Soviet–Albanian relations.

===1957 plenum===
In a February 1957 speech to a [[Plenary session|plenum]] of the Central Committee of the Party subsequently published in the newspaper ''[[Zëri i Popullit]]'', Hoxha defended Stalin's legacy and attacked the Yugoslavs (but not the Soviet leadership by name.){{sfn|Hoxha|1975|p=691}}  He added that, "In blackening Stalin, the enemies are not concerned about him as a person, but their aim is to discredit the Soviet Union, the socialist system, and the international communist movement, consequently, to undermine the workers' faith in socialism."{{sfn|Hoxha|1975|p=691}}

As a result of the February plenum of 1957, which was seen as directly rebuffing many post-Stalin Soviet views, the Soviet leadership invited Hoxha to visit Moscow in April that year allegedly for consultations. Instead, Khrushchev called on Hoxha to rehabilitate and reinstate party members who had been sacked for their support of Yugoslavia and the theses of the 20th Party Congress; Hoxha refused. In response to this Khrushchev accused Hoxha of sectarianism and of being "hell-bent on pursuing Stalinist policies."{{sfn|Logoreci|1977|p=123}} Hoxha later recalled the meeting as follows: Khrushchev advised the Albanians to improve their relations with Yugoslavia, to which Hoxha replied, "We have always wanted to have good relations with Yugoslavia, but to put it bluntly, we do not trust the Yugoslav leaders, because they speak against the social system in our countries and are opposed to the foundations of Marxism-Leninism. In all their propaganda, they do not say one word against imperialism, on the contrary, [they] have joined the chorus of the Western powers against us." He once more said that the Yugoslav leadership failed to understand "any of its grave mistakes and deviations," to which Khrushchev replied that Yugoslavia did not betray Marxism–Leninism though it had "slipped" from its positions. "According to you," Khrushchev continued, "we ought to return to what Stalin did, which caused all these things we know about." The meeting became increasingly acrimonious and when the subject of rehabilitating disgraced Albanian politicians came up Khrushchev eventually concluded, "You are like Stalin who killed people," to which Hoxha replied, "Stalin killed traitors, and we kill them, too."{{sfn|Hoxha|1984|pp=364-365, 374}}

===Trade===
In an effort to persuade the Albanian leadership to reconcile itself with the Soviets, the USSR gave a credit of $160 million [[Soviet ruble|ruble]] loan to Albania in late 1957 for Albania's Third Five-Year Plan and among other things forgave $105 million in past debts Albania owed the Soviet Union. These efforts proved unsuccessful in persuading the Albanians to change their course.{{sfnm |1a1=Logoreci |1y=1977 |1p=123 |2a1=Vickers |2y=1999 |2p=183}} James S. O'Donnell remarked that the Soviets, then in an early stage of the [[Sino-Soviet split]], may have also tried to demonstrate Soviet "generosity" in an effort to counteract the amount of trade Albania was conducting with the [[People's Republic of China]].{{sfn|O'Donnell|1999|p=44}} Albania's passive trade balance with China had grown from 4.2% in 1955 to 21.6% in 1957.{{sfn|O'Donnell|1999|p=44}}

===Moscow Conference===
Relations between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia deteriorated further following Tito's refusal to attend the [[1957 International Conference of the Communist and Workers' Parties]], the goal of which was to establish the general line and common positions of the international communist movement.{{sfn|O'Donnell|1999|p=45}} As Hoxha later wrote, "Khrushchev and Co. made feverish efforts not only to ensure that the [[League of Communists of Yugoslavia]] would take part as a 'party of a socialist country', but if possible also, to ensure that Tito would reach agreement with Khrushchev over the platform&amp;nbsp;...  Each side wanted to exploit the meeting for its own aims: Khrushchev, to declare 'unity', even with painful concessions to satisfy and draw in Tito, while the latter, to urge the others to openly and finally abandon Marxism-Leninism, the struggle against modern revisionism and any principled stand."{{sfn|Hoxha|1984|pp=334-335}} The Albanian delegation led by Hoxha worked with the Chinese and other like-minded delegations to the Conference in drafting a declaration alongside the CPSU and the pro-Soviet parties, with the resulting document being described by some Western observers as a compromise; historian William E. Griffith wrote that "the statement leaned strongly toward the Russian position but usually was sufficiently ambiguous so that the Chinese and Albanians could (and did) interpret it in their favor."{{sfn|Griffith|1963|pp=57&amp;ndash;59}} In a notable example, the Albanian and Chinese view that revisionism was the "principal danger in the communist world" existed alongside the Soviet view that the Twentieth Party Congress "opened a new stage in the international communist movement," but despite this the declaration was considered overall by both Albania and China as an ideological victory.{{sfn|Ash|1974|pp=192&amp;ndash;193}} In Hoxha's view, "The whole concern of the Soviet Khrushchevites was 'to preserve unity', to keep the socialist countries and the communist parties of different countries in check&amp;nbsp;... They retreated, held back temporarily, in order to gather strength and take their revisionist revenge in the future."{{sfn|Hoxha|1984|pp=344-345}} O'Donnell states that after the Moscow Conference any trouble in Soviet–Albanian relations "was kept strictly private" until June 1960.{{sfn|O'Donnell|1999|p=46}}

==The split deepens==
At the end of 1958 Comecon had begun to push for what was later termed an "international socialist division of labor," in which Albania was relegated to "the task of supplying the member states with agricultural and mineral raw materials."{{sfn|Pano|1968|pp=130-131}} In May 1959 Khrushchev paid a visit to Albania with the aim of pressuring Albania's leadership into building up Yugoslav–Albanian and Soviet–Albanian ties and also to, in the words of historian Miranda Vickers, "focus their economy on the growing of citrus fruits rather than concentrate on industrialization and the expansion of their oil industry&amp;nbsp;... Khrushchev's visit was clouded by an atmosphere of mistrust, which culminated in a hurried departure two days earlier than scheduled."{{sfn|Vickers|1999|p=184}} According to Hoxha, Khrushchev displayed contempt for Albanian archaeology in [[Butrint]] and said to [[Rodion Malinovsky]], the Soviet Defense Minister who was visiting the country with him, "Look, how marvelous this is! An ideal base for our submarines could be built here. These old things [reference to archaeological findings] should be dug up and thrown into the sea&amp;nbsp;... We shall have the most ideal and most secure base in the Mediterranean. From here we can paralyze and attack everything."{{sfn|Hoxha|1984|p=385}} He was also said to have remarked to Hoxha to turn his country "into a flourishing garden," suggested he make it an attractive holiday spot for Soviet tourists, and that rather than produce grain, Albania should focus on growing oranges for export.{{sfn|Ash|1974|p=195}} Khrushchev allegedly said, "The Soviet Union has such an abundance of grain that the mice eat more than you can produce here."{{sfn|Ash|1974|p=195}}

By the beginning of 1960 Albania and China had concurred "on such questions as Yugoslav revisionism, global strategy, and de-Stalinization" and the Albanian leadership made "little secret of their sympathies for the Chinese stand."{{sfn|Pano|1968|p=134}} With the Sino-Soviet split also deepening the Soviet leadership began applying its first signs of economic pressure on Albania in March 1960, stating its intention to alter a scholarship agreement for Albanians to study in the USSR in which the Soviets paid 60% of tuition costs and upkeep for the students; this threat was subsequently retracted on the eve of the Bucharest Conference in June that year, possibly in an attempt not to push Albania further into the Chinese orbit.{{sfn|Freedman|1970|p=71}}

Early in June, however, Khrushchev met with Greek politician [[Sophocles Venizelos]] and reacted positively to the latter's suggestion of greater autonomy for [[Greeks in Albania]]; O'Donnell comments that, "The obvious purpose of this discussion was to infuriate Enver Hoxha as Albanian-Greek relations were strained at this time. It became known that Khrushchev had hinted to Venizelos that the Soviet Union would not be against territorial and/or [[concession (politics)|political concessions]] to the Greeks by the Albanians&amp;nbsp;... It is likely that Khrushchev used the meeting with Venizelos as a way to pay back Hoxha for snubbing him during his visit to Albania."{{sfn|O'Donnell|1999|p=46}} Griffith comments that, "Hoxha viewed this move by Khrushchev as an implicit threat to partition Albania – the overwhelming traditional fear of all Albanian nationalists."{{sfn|Griffith|1963|p=40}}

===Bucharest Conference===
At the opening of the Bucharest Conference on June 21, 1960, which was held on the occasion of the Third Congress of the [[Romanian Workers' Party]], Hoxha was not among the various heads of [[communist parties]] and [[Communist state|state]]s in attendance; Politburo member [[Hysni Kapo]] took his place.{{sfn|O'Donnell|1999|pp=46-47}} The stated purpose of the Conference was to have "the character of a preliminary meeting of the representatives of the communist and workers' parties, mainly for the purpose of 'exchanging opinions' and taking a joint decision on the date and place of a future meeting of the communist and workers' parties of the world."{{sfn|Omari|Pollo|1988|p=201}} In his memoirs Hoxha describes the Conference as being a "putsch" and adds, "The revisionist renegades needed another meeting of international communism to gain approval for their old plan for the final legitimization of modern revisionism," he did not attend because "[we] suspected that the problem of the differences which had emerged between China and the Soviet Union would be discussed&amp;nbsp;... we had heard only one side of the argument, the Soviet side, and we were not acquainted with the objections of the Chinese&amp;nbsp;... They had to be thrashed out thoroughly, they had to be studied carefully, and time was required for this. Therefore our Party sent Comrade Hysni Kapo to Bucharest to discuss only the date of the future meeting," for decisions besides this date were not to be taken at the Conference itself.{{sfn|Hoxha|1984|p=394, 400&amp;ndash;401}}

In the words of Nicholas C. Pano, "Khrushchev attempted to transform the Bucharest Conference into a communist summit meeting for the purpose of securing the condemnation of the Chinese" with Kapo being the only representative of a European party "to refrain from criticizing Peking, to attack Yugoslav revisionism, and to refuse to alter his stand on the Chinese and Yugoslav issues despite Soviet pressure. Khrushchev's hopes of bringing the Albanians to heel by means of peaceful persuasion were certainly shattered by the time the Bucharest Conference had come to an end."{{sfn|Pano|1968|p=136}} During the Conference Hoxha communicated with Kapo via radiogram, stating for instance on June 24, in response to a lengthy document distributed at the Conference by the Soviets attacking the Chinese, "When you make your speech at the meeting you should declare: 'I am not authorized to make statements on these matters because our leadership knows that these matters will be discussed at the forthcoming Meeting of representatives of the parties, as we have all agreed.'&amp;nbsp;... We understand your difficult situation, but don't worry at all, for we are on the right road."{{sfn|Hoxha|1976|pp=15&amp;ndash;16}}

===Hostilities===
After the Conference ended Khrushchev stepped up economic pressure on Albania, delaying a reply concerning 50,000 tons of requested grain to offset an acute food shortage caused by drought, and then issuing significant reductions in the amount of grain shipments.{{sfnm |1a1=Freedman |1y=1970 |1p=61 |2a1=O'Donnell|2y=1999 |2p=72 |3a1=O'Donnell|3y=1999 |3p=47 |4a1=Pano |4y=1968 |4p=137}} According to an Albanian account, the Soviet Union began to "cut systematically all economic aid to Albania. It delayed and in some cases ceased altogether the delivery of goods and industrial equipment to Albania, refused to ship the grain our people were in urgent need of&amp;nbsp;... sell[ing it] not through clearing but in free currency&amp;nbsp;... stopped all supplies for the Albanian People's Army, from food and clothing to weapons and technical equipment whose delivery had been approved by the Joint Command of the Warsaw Treaty. The countries of Eastern Europe, too, set out on the course of aggravating relations with the PRA [People's Republic of Albania] and created a difficult situation by setting up a blockade on Albania jointly with the Soviet government."{{sfn|Omari|Pollo|1988|pp=203&amp;ndash;204}}

The Soviets also attempted to threaten the Albanians with force; [[Andrei Grechko]], then Commander-in-chief of the Warsaw Treaty forces, remarked to an Albanian military delegation that they would not get military equipment agreed upon beforehand, saying, "You are only in the Warsaw Pact for the time being, anyway."{{sfn|Ash|1974|p=197}} Attempts were made to inoculate anti-government views in Albanian students studying abroad in the USSR and to convince the armed forces to go against the government.{{sfn|Logoreci|1977|p=127}} According to an Albanian account, the Soviet embassy in Albania also "carried out intensive diversionist activity in order to create an atmosphere of uncertainty and ideological confusion about the correct line of the PLA [Party of Labour of Albania]."{{sfn|Omari|Pollo|1988|p=202}} In July a military plot headed by Soviet-trained Rear Admiral Teme Sejko was uncovered and the plotters executed.{{sfnm |1a1=O'Donnell |1y=1999 |1pp=47-48 |2a1=Pano |2y=1968 |2pp=137-138}}

===Pro-Soviet faction in Albania===
Within the Party itself an effort was also made by pro-Soviet elements to overthrow Hoxha. In June Politburo member Liri Belishova visited China, giving a speech on June 6 which, in the words of Griffith, "could hardly have made her pro-Soviet sympathies clearer," having been full of praise for the Soviet Union, with said praise being omitted when the text was published the day after in the Party newspaper ''Zëri i Popullit''.{{sfn|Griffith|1963|pp=38-39}} While in China Belishova made contact with the Soviet embassy there, telling them what the Chinese had told her without authorization from the Albanian Politburo.{{sfn|Hoxha|1976|pp=92&amp;ndash;93}} Belishova and Koço Tashko, Chairman of the Central Auditing Committee, shared leadership of the pro-Soviet faction.  Foreign journalist Harry Hamm was told by Albanian functionaries that "Belishova and Tashko had never made any secret of their pro-Soviet leanings, and that they had maintained their attitude long after the decision had been made to move closer to [[Beijing|Peking]]'s general line. Their stubborn attitude was bound to lead to their expulsion from the Party and to their being relieved of all their offices."{{sfn|Hamm|1963|p=14}} Tashko, asked to speak on his own behalf, had his text prepared beforehand by the Soviet embassy and, having gotten confused, accidentally read the punctuation mark for a [[full stop]] in Russian amid a burst of laughter from those present.{{sfnm |1a1=O'Donnell |1y=1999 |1p=48 |2a1=Hoxha |2y=1976 |2pp=109-110}} Both Belishova and Tashko were expelled from the Party in September.{{sfn|Pano|1968|p=137}}

=== International Conference of the Communist and Workers' Parties===
In October 1960 a preparatory Commission for the upcoming International Conference of the Communist and Workers' Parties scheduled for November that year was held from October 1&amp;ndash;21, with the Albanian delegation being led by Hysni Kapo and [[Ramiz Alia]]. Alia later recalled that "the aim of the Soviets was to ensure that our Party did not come out against their party and Khrushchev, did not bring the fight out in the open, and speak about Bucharest and the contradictions which existed. To this end, they created around our delegation a harsh and dangerous atmosphere, in which open threats were combined with cunning flattery."{{sfn|Alia|1988|p=265}} Hoxha once again communicated via radiogram, writing to Kapo on October 13 that, "We are not of the same opinion as those who are trying to smooth out the problems by means of phrases in resolutions or declarations&amp;nbsp;... ''We are for carrying the matter through to the end.'' If this is not understood, ''it means that the danger which the Khrushchev group represents for the world communist movement is not understood.'' It does not depend on us whether this group should continue in power or not, but ''it is essential that we, should expose this group with Khrushchev at the head, as they deserve''&amp;nbsp;... we shall not allow ourselves to be impressed by those who say: 'How can one attack the glorious Soviet Union or the great Communist Party of Lenin for the faults of a few rascals?' We say: ''Precisely to defend the Soviet Union and the Party of Lenin, these 'rascals' must be exposed, and there must be no toning down of criticism or covering up of the deviationists.''"{{sfn|Hoxha|1976|pp=151&amp;ndash;152}}

On October 22, after the work of the Commission had ended, Khrushchev invited the delegates to a dinner which, according to Alia, was used "to threaten those parties which might oppose the line of the Soviets in November." He gave as an example an exchange between Soviet Politburo member [[Yekaterina Furtseva]] and Kapo, in which the former asked, "Are you Hysni Kapo?! I've heard so much about you&amp;nbsp;..." Kapo replied, "For good or bad?" to which Furtseva stated, "You have attacked the Soviet Union, but you are heading for trouble on that course," getting "the reply she deserved" from Kapo, with Alia further writing that "her mission was just to transmit the signal. Throughout the whole dinner she did not speak to us again."{{sfn|Alia|1988|pp=278-279}}

From November 3&amp;ndash;25 Enver Hoxha headed the Albanian delegation which would present its case at the Second International Conference of the Communist and Workers' Parties together with Kapo, Alia, and others.{{sfn|Alia|1988|pp=282&amp;ndash;283}}  Alia later noted, "The Soviets' aim was to ensure that Comrade Enver did not speak openly in Moscow, that, at the most, he should restrict himself to general criticisms on a theoretical plane&amp;nbsp;... they brought all-sided pressure to bear on our delegation&amp;nbsp;... even us[ing] the official reception for the celebration of [[October Revolution|November 7]] against our delegation for these purposes."{{sfn|Alia|1988|pp=282&amp;ndash;283}} On November 5 a 125-page letter was sent from the Central Committee of the CPSU to its Chinese counterpart ignoring the existence of Albania as a socialist country and "malign[ing] the Party of Labour of Albania."{{sfnm |1a1=Logoreci |1y=1977 |1p=126 |2a1=Hoxha |2y=1980 |2pp=70}} Later noting this letter in regards to China, Hoxha wrote that, "They distributed this voluminous material against China before the meeting, in order to prepare the terrain and to brainwash the delegations of other parties, and to intimidate the Chinese, to compel them to take a moderate stand, if they would not submit. This anti-Chinese material did not surprise us, but it strengthened the conviction we had in the correctness of the line and the Marxist-Leninist stands of our Party in defence of the Communist Party of China."{{sfn|Hoxha|1984|p=444}}

On November 10, 1960 the second International Conference of the Communist and Workers' Parties was convened.{{sfn|Pano|1968|p=139}} As Hoxha recalled, "In his speech Khrushchev expressed the revisionist views completely and attacked the Communist Party of China and the Party of Labour of Albania, as well as those who were going to follow these parties, but without mentioning any names&amp;nbsp;... wanted to keep all the communist and workers' parties of the world under his conductor's baton, under his dictate."{{sfn|Hoxha|1984|pp=446&amp;ndash;447}} On November 12 a private meeting was held between members of the Albanian delegation including Hoxha and members of the Soviet leadership, which "showed that no compromise between them was possible."{{sfn|Logoreci|1977|p=126}} During the meeting Hoxha noted that "[The Soviet ambassador to Albania] has asked to whom the Albanian army will be loyal. This question he addressed to our generals at the airport, in the presence of one of your generals. Our officers replied that our army would be loyal to Marxism-Leninism, to the Party of Labour and socialism." Khrushchev replied, "If our ambassador said such a thing, he was foolish." Hoxha in turn replied, "He was no fool. He committed this 'foolishness' following the Bucharest Meeting." The subject eventually came to the [[Vlora]] naval base, which was the subject of a Soviet–Albanian dispute to become acute months later. Khrushchev threatened Hoxha, saying, "We can dismantle the base if you like." Hoxha replied, "If you dismantle the base you will be making a big mistake. We have fought empty-bellied and bare-footed, but have never kowtowed to anybody." As the meeting's atmosphere became increasingly hostile Khrushchev declared, "You flare up in anger. You spat on me; no one can talk to you." The meeting ended after Kapo declared, "I do not agree that the talks should be conducted like this."{{sfn|Hoxha|1980|pp=84&amp;ndash;92}}

Hoxha delivered his speech to the Conference on November 16; he "spoke of the tremendous Soviet pressures to which the Albanian party and government had been subjected after the Bucharest meeting&amp;nbsp;... The only crime his régime had committed, the Albanian leader added, was that it did not agree that the Chinese communist party should be summarily and unjustly condemned. For this it had been treated in a manner that was shabby, anti-Marxist and uncomradely. Hoxha's speech had a shattering effect on the Moscow gathering."{{sfn|Logoreci|1977|pp=127-128}} Amongst other things Hoxha said that, according to Khrushchev, the Party of Labour and Albania itself "should merely applaud and approve, but express no opinion of its own. But this is neither Marxist nor acceptable. Marxism-Leninism has granted us the right to have our say, and no one can take this from us, either by means of political and economic pressure, or by means of threats and names they might call us."{{sfn|Hoxha|1980|pp=126-127}} According to Alia, Khrushchev "tried to appear calm" when first replying, reading his written text "almost mechanically" in regards to China but as soon as he began to reply to Hoxha's speech "he lost his head and began to shout, scream and splutter."{{sfn|Alia|1988|p=289}} Khrushchev was said to have angrily remarked, "Comrade Hoxha, you have poured a bucket of filth over me: you are going to have to wash it off again."{{sfn|Hamm|1963|p=19}} Jon Halliday states that, "On this occasion Hoxha truly succeeded in putting himself and Albania on the world map. His denunciation of Khrushchev made headlines round the world and even his harshest critics usually concede that Hoxha turned in an able performance and showed personal courage."{{sfn|Halliday|1986|p=227}} In retirement Khrushchev later recalled the Conference and said that Hoxha "bared his fangs at us even more menacingly than the Chinese themselves. After his speech, comrade [[Dolores Ibarruri]], an old revolutionary and a devoted worker in the Communist movement, got up indignantly and said, very much to the point, that Hoxha was like a dog who bites the hand that feeds it."{{sfn|O'Donnell|1999|p=47}}

Alia relates that during the Conference a Soviet security officer had said to both him and Kapo that the Soviet leadership might have been contemplating Hoxha's assassination.{{sfn|Alia|1988|pp=284&amp;ndash;285}} For this reason, as Hoxha relates in his memoirs, "The Khrushchevites were capable of anything and we took our own measures&amp;nbsp;... Hysni and Ramiz stayed on in Moscow, as they had to sign the declaration" while Hoxha left the Soviet Union by train and "arrived in Austria, went down by train through Italy and from Bari returned safe and sound to Tirana on our own aircraft and went directly to the reception organized on the occasion of the [[Albanian independence day|28th]] and [[Liberation Day (Albania)|29th of November]]."{{sfn|Hoxha|1984|p=455}}

At the Conference itself the Albanian delegation played a leading role together with its Chinese counterpart in giving the draft declaration "Marxist-Leninist content" and that, despite "serious flaws" (in the view of these delegations) "the Declaration eventually signed by the 81 parties was a repudiation of revisionist theses&amp;nbsp;... [and] condemned the Yugoslav form of 'international opportunism which is a concentrated expression of the theories of modern revisionism.'&amp;nbsp;... the Soviet revisionists and the revisionists in other countries and parties demonstrated [in the view of Albania and China] their opportunistic character by completely disregarding the principles set forth in a document they had found it expedient to sign."{{sfn|Ash|1974|pp=201-202}}

On December 19 Hoxha delivered his report to a plenum of the Central Committee of the Party concerning the Moscow Conference, remarking on the mutual defenses Albania and China provided for each other at Bucharest and Moscow and adding, "In the future our Party will strengthen its ties and friendship with the Communist Party of China and the great Chinese people, always upholding the teachings of Marxism-Leninism and the correct line always pursued by the Central Committee of our Party."{{sfn|Hoxha|1976|p=277}}

==Culmination==
At the Fourth Congress of the Party of Labour held in February 1961 Hoxha declared—although still not mentioning the Soviets by name—that, "During the past few years, our Party and other Marxist-Leninist parties have waged a successful struggle against the views of modern revisionists&amp;nbsp;... But in spite of all the crushing blows and defeats it has received, revisionism&amp;nbsp;... remains the main danger to the international communist movement&amp;nbsp;... a resolute and uncompromising struggle must be waged against revisionism until it is utterly destroyed."{{sfn|Hoxha|1980|pp=278&amp;ndash;278}} According to an Albanian account, "Right after the 4th Congress of the PLA, when it became clear that its attempts at imposing its will on Albania were futile, the Soviet leadership cut off all the credits envisaged in the agreements between the two countries."{{sfn|Omari|Pollo|1988|p=213}} The Congress, which was the last one in which Soviet and East European representatives from other parties would attend, "confirmed that the rift with Russia was almost complete and the alliance between China and Albania an accomplished fact."{{sfn|Logoreci|1977|pp=128-129}}

On January 20 that year the Soviets announced that their oil specialists would be withdrawn within a seven- to ten-day period. The Albanians later claimed that the specialists had sabotaged Albania's oil installations before departing.{{sfn|Freedman|1970|pp=76-77}}  Although Khrushchev had symbolically delivered blueprints for the [[Palace of Culture of Tirana]] on the occasion of his 1959 visit, all Soviet construction efforts on it ceased by April 1961. A shipment of materials for the Palace, which arrived in [[Durrës]], was "withdrawn at once on the pretext that the materials 'had been loaded by mistake and were not really intended for Albania.'"{{sfnm |1a1=Ash |1y=1974 |1p=204 |2a1=Hamm |2y=1963 |2pp=34}} On April 23 a Sino–Albanian trade agreement was concluded; Soviet First Deputy Premier [[Alexei Kosygin]] sent a letter five days later which effectively signaled an end to Soviet–Albanian trade agreements. Among other things it stated that "It is understandable that the Albanian leadership cannot expect in the future that the USSR will help it as it has in the past, with aid from which only true friends and brothers have a right to benefit."{{sfn|Freedman|1970|pp=77-78}} On August 19 the Soviet ambassador to Albania left Tirana "and was never to return."{{sfnm |1a1=Freedman |1y=1970 |1p=79 |2a1=Ash |2y=1974 |2pp=205}} On August 26, "only five days before the beginning of the fall semester," the Soviets canceled scholarships for Albanian students studying in the USSR; these students given a deadline to leave by October.{{sfnm |1a1=Freedman |1y=1970 |1p=79 |2a1=Ash |2y=1974 |2pp=205}} An Albanian account of the economy during this period states that, "The foreign specialists left unfinished about 40 important objects of the 2nd Five-year Plan in the industrial sector alone. Difficulties increased even more after the cessation of military aid. Thus in the first years of the 3rd Five-year Plan the fulfillment of the plan in many sectors of the economy was made very difficult and to a certain extent the development of the Albanian economy as a whole was impaired."{{sfn|Omari|Pollo|1988|p=214}}

Military pressure was stepped up still further; during summer "the training of all Albanian officers, cadets, and noncoms in the Soviet Union or the East European satellite countries was brought to a stop. Since then, there has been not a single Albanian studying at a military academy in the Eastern Bloc. It has been impossible, therefore, for the Tirana Government to keep its army up-to-date on military theory."{{sfn|Hamm|1963|p=28}} In March Albania had not been invited to attend a meeting of the Warsaw Treaty states.{{sfn|O'Donnell|1999|p=53}} Hoxha later recalled that "When we returned from Moscow [in November 1960], the provocations at the [Vlora submarine] base were increased and in order to exert pressure on and impress us, the Soviet deputy foreign minister, Firyubin, came to Tirana with two other 'deputies': the first deputy-chief of the General Staff of the Soviet Army and Navy, Antonov, and the deputy chief of the Supreme Staff of the Soviet Navy, Sergeyev. They came allegedly 'to reach agreement', but in fact they brought us an ultimatum: The Vlora base must be put completely and solely under Soviet command, which was to be subordinate to the commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces of the Warsaw Treaty."{{sfn|Hoxha|1984|pp=466-467}}

An Albanian account describes the dispute as follows: "By violating the formal Albanian-Soviet agreements signed in September 1957 an May 1959, the Soviet government did everything in its power to put under its control this Albanian base which at the same time served the defence of the socialist countries&amp;nbsp;... On April 5, 1961, in a letter addressed to the governments of the Soviet Union and the East-European states it resolutely reaffirmed that it accepted only one solution of the problem: the base of Vlora belonged to Albania and all the naval means that were its property should be handed over to Albanian crew as soon as possible. Any other solution was an act which would lead to the unilateral violation on the part of the Soviet Union of the existing Albanian-Soviet agreements of the years 1957 and 1959."{{sfn|Omari|Pollo|1988|pp=282-283}} In May 1961 the Soviets began dismantling the base and tried to seize the submarines, seizing some Albanian ships undergoing repairs at [[Sevastopol]] in the process.{{sfnm |1a1=Pano |1y=1968 |1p=148 |2a1=Logoreci |2y=1977 |2p=129}} As the Albanian account describes it, "The Soviet sailors and officers carried out numerous provocations, trying by all manner of means to create a pretext for the Soviet military intervention in Albania&amp;nbsp;... On May 26, 1961 it seized in a demonstrative manner 8 submarines, the floating base 'Kotelnikov', as well as the Albanian warships that were laid for repair in the port of Sevastopol. On June 5, 1961 the personnel of Soviet advisers left the base at Vlora, too."{{sfn|Omari|Pollo|1988|pp=285-286}} Hoxha's account is as follows: Admiral [[Vladimir Kasatonov]] of the Black Sea fleet "came to Tirana with the mission of seizing not only the eight submarines&amp;nbsp;... but even the submarines which we had taken over earlier. We told him bluntly: Either you hand the submarines over to us according to the agreement, or within a short time (we set the date) you must withdraw immediately from the bay&amp;nbsp;... He did not hand over the submarines, but went to Vlora, boarded the command submarine and lined up the others in fighting formation. We gave orders to close the Sazan Narrows and to train the guns on the Soviet ships. Admiral Kasatonov, who had wanted to frighten us, was frightened himself. He was caught like a rat in a trap and if he attempted to implement his plan he might find himself at the bottom of the sea. In these conditions the admiral was obliged to take only the submarines with Soviet crews, and he sailed out of the bay back home with his tail between his legs."{{sfn|Hoxha|1984|pp=467-468}}

At the [[22nd Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Twenty-Second Congress of the CPSU]] in October that year Khrushchev openly attacked the Albanian leadership, proclaiming Hoxha a "leftist nationalist deviationist" and calling for his overthrow, declaring that, "We are certain the time will come when the Albanian communists and the Albanian people will have their say, and then the Albanian leaders will have to answer for the harm they have done their country, their people and the cause of socialist construction in Albania."{{sfn|Freedman|1970|p=79}} He further stated that "The imperialists are always prepared to pay thirty pieces of silver to those who split the Communist ranks." To this Hoxha replied in a November 7 speech, "the Albanian people and their Party of Labor will even live on grass if need be, but they will never sell themselves 'for 30 pieces of silver'&amp;nbsp;... They would rather die honourably on their feet than live in shame on their knees."{{sfn|O'Donnell|1999|pp=56-57}} Nicholas C. Pano noted that "[Khrushchev's] pronouncements [at the Twenty-Second Congress], at least insofar as the Soviet leadership was concerned, had made the policies of de-Stalinization, peaceful coexistence, and reconciliation with Yugoslavia adopted at the Twentieth Congress of the CPSU binding upon the members of the communist system."{{sfn|Pano|1968|pp=150-151}} Despite Albanian calls for the continued existence of state relations between the two countries, the Soviet government formally withdrew its ambassador on November 25 and on December 3 withdrew "the whole personnel of its embassy and commercial representation from the PRA, while at the same time demanding that the personnel of the Albanian embassy and the Albanian commercial adviser should leave the territory of the Soviet Union." "Thus," the Albanian account continues, "the Khrushchev revisionist group, consistent in its line, cut off all relations with socialist Albania at a time when it maintained contacts with and was drawing ever closer to the most reactionary regimes of the world."{{sfn|Omari|Pollo|1988|pp=287-288}}

In a December 10 ''Zëri i Popullit'' article, Hoxha wrote that, "The real cause" of the break in diplomatic relations "must be sought in the revisionist views of Khrushchev and in his anti-Marxist efforts to impose them on the other parties by any means&amp;nbsp;... with a view to silencing our Party, to subjugating it and giving a lesson to anyone that would dare to oppose him, Khrushchev extended the ideological disagreements to the field of state relations and began to behave with the PRA as towards an enemy country&amp;nbsp;... he aims to intimidate and subjugate the PLA, to shift it from its revolutionary Marxist-Leninist positions, to shake the confidence of our people in the PLA and its leadership, to upset the feelings of friendship of the Albanian people towards the Soviet Union&amp;nbsp;... But Khrushchev is trying in vain&amp;nbsp;... Under the leadership of the PLA, the Albanian people have scored historic victories in the course of these twenty years: they liberated the country from the fascist invaders and established the people's state power, reconstructed the war-ravaged country, liquidated the centuries-old backwardness and achieved great successes in the construction of socialist society&amp;nbsp;... Our Party is fighting for a great cause, for the truth of Marxism-Leninism&amp;nbsp;... On this course, marching shoulder to shoulder with the sister Marxist-Leninist parties and the fraternal peoples of the socialist countries, as well as with all the revolutionary forces of the world, our Party and people will score complete victory over the imperialist and revisionist enemies. Marxism-Leninism cannot be vanquished! Socialism and communism will triumph!"{{sfn|Hoxha|1980|pp=352-356}}

==Subsequent developments==
In his memoirs Khrushchev described the Albanian leadership as "monsters," saying that, "The rift which developed between the Soviet Union and Albania stemmed mainly from the Albanians' fear of democratisation."{{sfn|Halliday|1986|p=143}} The downfall of Khrushchev in 1964 saw Hoxha write an article for ''Zëri i Popullit'' in which he stated that, "Despite the fact that Khrushchev was the head of modern revisionism, his political liquidation as a person does not mean the liquidation of his political, ideological, economic and organizational course&amp;nbsp;... Khrushchevite revisionism is not dead, his ideology and policy expressed in the line of the 20th and 22nd Congresses of the CPSU are not liquidated."{{sfn|Hoxha|1980|p=663}} In the view of [[William Ash (writer)|William Ash]], writing in support of the Albanian position, "The final proof of the correctness of Albania's characterisation of Soviet revisionism came with the [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia|invasion and military occupation of Czechoslovakia]] in 1968 – 'Khrushchevism without Khrushchev', since Brezhnev who succeeded the deposed revisionist leader followed the same line."{{sfn|Ash|1974|p=207}} An Albanian account discussing the invasion notes that, "Albania resolutely denounced this act, calling it 'an aggression of the fascist type' which 'represented the greatest debasement of the honour and authority of the Soviet Union and the Soviet people on the part of the Khrushchevite revisionist Brezhnev-Kosygin clique'&amp;nbsp;... the Warsaw Treaty had completely been transformed from a means of defence into a means of aggression" and that, having been ''[[de facto]]'' excluded from the Pact since 1961, "on September 13, 1968, at an extraordinary session the People's Assembly of the People's Republic of Albania decided to denounce this Treaty and exonerate Albania from any obligation deriving from it."{{sfn|Omari|Pollo|1988|pp=289-290}} In the 1970s the alliance between Albania and China against perceived Soviet revisionism gradually began to break down, resulting in the [[Sino–Albanian split]].

Writing in 1988, Ramiz Alia reiterated the Albanian view that, "The revisionist current most dangerous to the world communist movement has been and still is Soviet revisionism" and that, "To oppose the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, which had great political and theoretical authority, meant to isolate oneself, at least for a time, from most of the communist parties of the world. Precisely here lies the heroism of the Party of Labour of Albania, the majesty of its decision, and its courage and determination for the cause of Marxism-Leninism, for the cause of socialism and communism."{{sfn|Alia|1988|p=236, 238-239}}

In July 1990, after the fall of the Eastern Bloc and political upheaval in Albania itself, Alia announced the restoration of diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Vickers|1999|p=215}} In an official communiqué the Soviets "attributed the normalisation [of diplomatic relations] to the better political climate in Europe, and the state radio reported that, as the Soviet Union was on course for reform, 'there has been a marked trend recently towards democratisation of Albanian society'."{{sfn|Kola|2003|p=196}} In June 1991 the ruling Party of Labour became the social-democratic [[Socialist Party of Albania|Socialist Party]], dropping its prior commitment to Marxism–Leninism, and in December 1991 the Soviet Union was dissolved.

{{Civil procedure (United States)}}

A '''special appearance''' is a term used in the  [[United States|American]]  [[law]]  of  [[civil procedure]]  to describe a civil [[defendants|defendant]]'s  appearance in the  [[court]]  of another  [[U.S. state|state]]  solely to dispute the  [[in personum jurisdiction|personal jurisdiction]]  of the court over that defendant.   Prior to the advent of this procedure, defendants had to either appear in the other state's court to defend the case on the merits, or not show up in court at all, and then mount a [[collateral attack]] on any [[Judgment (law)|judgment]] rendered against them, when the  [[plaintiff]]  came to the defendant's state to collect on the judgment.   In a legal [[catch-22]],  if the defendant appeared solely to contest jurisdiction, the court would then be permitted to assert jurisdiction based on the defendant's presence.

In response to the apparent inequity presented by this situation, most states have passed [[statutes]] permitting the defendant to make a special appearance in the courts of the state to contest jurisdiction, without further subjecting themselves to the jurisdiction of the court. The equivalent of such an appearance is possible in [[U.S. federal courts]], for the defendant may make a motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction.  Where a special appearance is permitted, the term '''general appearance''' is used to denote the normal type of appearance in court. A "special appearance" is in contrast to a "general appearance".

Beginning in the late 1990's, adherents of the [[sovereign citizen|sovereign citizen's movement]] have attempted to use the special appearance to question the jurisdiction and competence of courts where the point is moot. The most prevalent use of the special appearance is in any criminal court, as special appearances are only recognized in the civil rules of procedure and the civil courts. Thus, the term special appearance has no meaning in the context of a criminal court, as anyone committing, or having been indicted for or charged with committing or otherwise alleged to have committed a criminal offense are de jure within the jurisdiction of the criminal courts, whatever their residence or national citizenship. 

This type of special appearance is not to be confused with a first special appearance in which an attorney who has not had the opportunity to formally become a defendant's attorney of record appears on that person's behalf.

{{Campaignbox Sheep Wars}}

The '''Spring Creek raid''', also known as the '''Tensleep Murders''' or the '''Tensleep Raid''', occurred in 1909 and was the last serious conflict during the [[Sheep Wars]] in [[Wyoming]], as well as the deadliest sheep raid in the state's history. On the night of April 2, the [[sheepherder]] Joe Allemand and four of his associates were encamped along Spring Creek, near the town of [[Ten Sleep, Wyoming|Ten Sleep]], when a group of seven masked [[Cowman (profession)|cattlemen]] attacked them. It remains uncertain as to whether or not an exchange of gunfire took place between the two parties, but evidence suggests that Allemand and two of his men were [[execution|executed]] while the remaining two escaped unharmed. Two sheep wagons were also destroyed by fire and about two dozen head of sheep were shot to death. Seven men were arrested for the crime, two of whom turned state's evidence and were acquitted. The rest were found guilty and sent to prison for sentences ranging from three years to life in prison. The conviction of the Tensleep murderers effectively put an end to the killings on the [[open range]] and exemplified the arrival of [[law and order (politics)|law and order]] in a region that still retained its rugged [[American Frontier|frontier]] environment after the end of the 19th century. Although there continued to be sheep raids in Wyoming into the 1910s, there were no more deaths.&lt;ref name="Elman, pg. 139"&gt;{{cite book|last=Elman|first=Robert|authorlink=|title=Badmen of the West|publisher=The Ridge Press, Inc.|series=|year=1974|doi=|isbn=0-600-313530}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="truewestmagazine.com"&gt;{{Cite web| title=Conflict on the Range: On the trail of the Colorado and Wyoming sheep and cattle wars.| work=Candy Moulton| url=http://www.truewestmagazine.com/jcontent/travel/travel/renegade-roads/4272-conflict-on-the-range| date=August 28, 2011| accessdate=June 27, 2012| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130915183925/http://www.truewestmagazine.com/jcontent/travel/travel/renegade-roads/4272-conflict-on-the-range| archivedate=September 15, 2013| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="westernheritagestudio.com"&gt;{{Cite web| title=Night Riders of Norwood - Western Heritage Studios - Cody Wyoming| work=L.D.

==Background==
For decades prior to 1909, sheepmen and cattlemen had been fighting for control of America's vast unsettled grasslands. The conflicts usually began as disputes over [[grazing rights]], but the cattlemen also complained that the sheepmen destroyed the open range and made it unsuitable for cattle. For example, cattlemen claimed that sheepmen let their flocks [[overgraze]], or that the sharp hooves of the sheep were cutting up the grass to a point where it wouldn't grow back. Sheepmen were also said to have polluted the water sources so badly that cattle could not drink from them without becoming sick. Generally, the cattlemen were the stronger of the two factions and they controlled the range by establishing a type of border called "deadlines" and hiring [[gunfighter|gunmen]] to prevent sheepherders from crossing them.&lt;ref name="rootsweb.ancestry.com"&gt;{{Cite web| title=History Of Natrona County - Tragedies of Natrona County - Hanging of "Cattle Kate" and Jim Averill| work=| url=http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~wytttp/natrona/history/chapter24.html| date=| year=| accessdate=June 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="answers.com"&gt;{{Cite web| title=Sheep Wars: Information from Answers.com| work=| url=http://www.answers.com/topic/sheep-wars| date=| year=| accessdate=June 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 1908, the sheep and cattlemen's associations of Wyoming agreed to the establishment of a deadline in [[Big Horn County, Wyoming|Big Horn County]]. [[Tensleep Creek]] made up at least part of the border; west of the creek was cattle country while the area to the east was for the sheepmen. However, not long after the agreement was in effect, the herder Joe Allemand and his partner, Joseph Emge, became some of the first to break it when they began moving their flocks across the deadline to a place near [[Worland, Wyoming|Worland]] for the winter season. Soon after, other sheepherders followed suit "until the division [deadline] was practically no division, and no range was safe to the cattlemen." Together, Allemand and Emge owned three ranches in the area east of the deadline, all near the mouth of Spring Creek and Tensleep Creek. Emge, a [[Germany|German]] immigrant, was formerly a cattlemen, but he "abandoned the business, and went over to the enemy" sometime shortly after the turn of the century. According to author George C. Morris, Allemand was well-liked and considered a peaceful man that had been involved in the sheep trade for years, but Emge was more aggressive and probably the one who decided to lead the sheep across cattle country, being that he was the trail master. In this case, Emge was well aware of the consequences of passing through cattle country with a herd of sheep, so, during the first drive, he had a local [[deputy sheriff]] accompany him. According to Morris, the deputy prevented the cattlemen from attacking, but when Emge requested assistance for the drive back home he was declined. The sheriff warned Emge to detour around the cattle ranges, but he failed to follow the advice, possibly because taking the detour was a longer journey. Instead of relying on the police, Emge purchased two automatic rifles with 1,000 rounds of ammunition and openly said they were for "running the cattlemen off the range."&lt;ref name="Morris, pg. 142-148"&gt;{{cite book|last=Morris|first=George C.|authorlink=|title=The Pacific Monthly, Volume 23: Cowboy or Sheepherder?

==Raid==
The Allemand-Emge party consisted of five men, including Allemand and Emge, two sheep wagons, several [[Livestock guardian dog|sheep dog]]s, and between 2,500 and 12,000 head of sheep, depending on varying sources. The other three men were hired hands named Jules Lazier, Allemand's nephew, Pierre Cafferal and Charles "Bounce" Helmer. The herd was divided into two groups, one on each side of Spring Creek, with a wagon and at least one dog attached to each one. For the first thirty miles or so the journey was uneventful, but, on April 2, the party met up with a pair of friends, who lived nearby, and stopped to have dinner with them. Allemand also telephoned his wife sometime during the drive, to tell her that he would be home soon. According to one source, some of Emge's enemies were listening in on the phone call and were able to plan an attack based on the information. When dinner was over it was already dark, so the party decided to camp for the night and continue on in the morning. The location of the camp was about a half day's ride from the deadline and safety, but also near the Keyes Ranch, where the raiders had assembled. The raiders, who were later identified as George Saban, Herbert Brink, Albert Keyes, Charles Farris, Ed Eaton, Tommy Dixon, and Milton Alexander, rode out from the ranch sometime that night and found the sheepherders' camp soon after. At least half of the group were wealthy cattlemen. George Saban, the leader of the group, was the owner of the Bay State Cattle Company, one of the largest in Wyoming, and already known to the public for having led the [[Lynching|lynch mob]] that raided the Big Horn County jail in 1903, where two prisoners and a deputy sheriff were killed.&lt;ref name="Morris, pg. 142-148"/&gt;&lt;ref name="genealogyalongtherockies.com"&gt;{{Cite web| title=Facts About The Spring Creek Raid| work=| url=http://www.genealogyalongtherockies.com/wyoming/Big%20Horn/wybhspr.htm| date=| year=| accessdate=June 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wyohistory.org"&gt;{{Cite web| title=The Spring Creek Raid: The Last Murderous Sheep Raid in the Big Horn Basin| work=John W.

There were two other cattlemen in the area as well, Porter Lamb and Fred Greet, who were camping in a tent within 400 yards of the Allemand-Emge camp, on land that was part of the Lamb Ranch. According to Morris: "[Lamb and Greet] were awakened by staccato cracks of automatic rifles and the glimmering starlight made indistinctly visible moving shadows stepping swiftly about in the haze, punctured with spitting flame flashes when the weapons spoke. Ultimately the firing ceased, then followed the flare of burning sheep wagons. A chorus of galloping hoofs- then silence." Lamb and Greet were the ones who first discovered the remains of the sheepherders on the following morning. Morris wrote: "When dawn came Lamb and Greet stood aghast at the vendetta vengeance that had been taken. In front of the wagon ruins Allemand lay face upward with bullet holes in his neck and side, to show where deadly soft-nosed missiles took his life. In the charred still-smoking embers were two baked bodies, subsequently identified as Emge, the daring, and Jules Lazier, a herder. 'Bounce' Helmer and Pierre Cafferal, two herders in the wagon on the other side of the creek, escaped through the leniency of the raiders and it is believed their lives were spared because Helmer's father is of the cattlemen and a leader among them." Although some accounts vary, it is generally believed that the group of raiders snuck up to the Allemand-Emge camp, split in two, and then began shooting at the flocks or advancing on the wagons. After that they called on the herders to surrender, but when Allemand came out he was shot down in cold blood. The raiders then fired into the wagons and it was during this time that Emge and Lazier were killed while Cafferal and Helmer were captured and tied up with rope. However, the latter two men were either freed by the raiders later on, as Morris claims, or they were able to untangle the ropes and free themselves, as another source says.&lt;ref name="Morris, pg. 142-148"/&gt;&lt;ref name="travel-to-wyoming.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="genealogyalongtherockies.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wyohistory.org"/&gt;

Cafferal and Helmer went straight from the camp to alert the police, who organized a [[posse comitatus (common law)|posse]], which arrived at the crime scene on the next day. Overall, Allemand, Emge, and Lazier were killed along with two of their dogs and twenty-five sheep. The rest of the herd was scattered and both wagons were burned. Cafferal and Helmer had suspicions about who had attacked their camp, but all of the raiders wore masks and therefore could not be positively identified by the survivors' testimony alone.&lt;ref name="Morris, pg. 142-148"/&gt;&lt;ref name="travel-to-wyoming.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="genealogyalongtherockies.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wyohistory.org"/&gt;

==Aftermath==
The Tensleep Murders shocked the people in the surrounding communities, particularly the sheepmen, so the Wyoming Wool Growers' Association offered a large reward for the capture of the murderers or information that led to it. The Wyoming Wool Growers' put up a bounty [[US$|$]]5,000, which was supplemented by $2,000 from the National Wool Growers' Association, $1,000 from Big Horn County, and another $500 from the state of Wyoming. In Morris' words; "the sheepmen played upon the cupidity of men and balanced golden gains in rewards against silence and fear of punishment." Sheep raiders had never been convicted in a Wyoming court before so all of the raiders assumed they had nothing to fear. In the days that followed, Brink and Dixon bragged about committing the murders until one of their friends, William "Billy" Goodrich, informed Sheriff Felix Alston in [[Basin, Wyoming|Basin]]. Goodrich told the sheriff the identities of all the men involved and he then told either Brink or Dixon that if they wanted to help the rest of the raiders then they had better surrender before the [[grand jury]] met later that month. At that point, Keyes and Farris took the advice and surrendered to Sheriff Alston. Then, Alston, Goodrich, Keyes, and Farris had a meeting in [[Sheridan, Wyoming|Sheridan]] with [[Governor of Wyoming|Governor]] [[Bryant B. Brooks]] and a few Wyoming attorneys. There, Keyes and Farris made a full confession with the promise that they'd be pardoned and safely escorted out of the state after the trial. None were eligible for the reward. Warrants were issued for the arrest of the other five raiders, Saban, Brink, Eaton, Dixon and Alexander, and they were hastily detained without any trouble on May 3.&lt;ref name="rootsweb.ancestry.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Morris, pg. 142-148"/&gt;&lt;ref name="travel-to-wyoming.com"/&gt;

Around this time, a man name "Billy" Garrison committed suicide because of his involvement in the case. Like Goodrich, Garrison was one of the men Dixon and Brink bragged too so, instead of testifying against his friends, he rode to a place five miles from his home, the Goodrich Ranch, and shot himself. Garrison's death was officially determined to have been caused by suicide, but there is a possibility that the cattlemen wanted to silence him before a trial could begin. Morris wrote the following: "It was a season of suppressed seething that threatened to boil over at any moment. Feeling was intense when it was known that Farris and Keyes had confessed, for that is one of the unpardonable offenses of the range. In the history of Big Horn County only three grand juries have ever been assembled because of the reluctance or refusal of witnesses summoned to give testimony that would be inadmissible in courts of law. That it went hard against the grain is eloquently verified by the suicide of 'Billy' Garrison. He lived at the Goodrich place and had been told things by Brink and Dixon. He perjured himself loyally before the grand jury, then drove to a ranch some five miles distant from the Goodrich home, put his horse up in the barn and shot himself to death. It was his conception of loyalty. Rather than send his friends to death he went to his own bravely."&lt;ref name="Morris, pg. 142-148"/&gt;

The trial was held in Basin. The remaining five raiders quickly gave in and confessed like Keyes and Farris or pleaded guilty. Brink was the first to be tried. The testimony of Keyes, Farris, and Goodrich convinced the jury that he was almost solely responsible for the deaths. Farris' testimony was actually a direct accusation that Brink shot Allemand. Morris quoted the following from the state's records: "I heard Brink shout: 'Show a light and come out,'... A man appeared at the front of the wagon. 'Hands up!' cried Brink. The man's hands were in the air as he came towards us. Then Brink said: 'This is a hell of time o' night to come up with your hands in the air!' There was a shot. Who fired it? Herbert Brink." Brink was sentenced to hang for first degree murder, but it was later reduced to life in prison at the [[Wyoming State Penitentiary]] in [[Rawlins, Wyoming|Rawlins]]. Saban and Alexander both admitted to second degree murder and were sentenced to twenty-five years in prison while Dixon and Eaton each received three years imprisonment for [[arson]]. Morris says that the majority of the people of Wyoming were aligned with the cattlemen so, on November 20, 1909, when the raiders were to begin their sentences, Basin citizens crowded the train station to say goodbye to the raiders and give them gifts, such as blankets. Morris notes that nobody was waiting to greet Farris, Keyes, and Goodrich when they left. All three sold their belongings and headed west with a deputy sheriff, who escorted them to the state border.&lt;ref name="Morris, pg. 142-148"/&gt;

As for the five prisoners, Eaton died in state custody, Dixon was paroled in 1912, Saban escaped in 1913 and was never recaptured, and Brink and Alexander were paroled in 1914. The conviction of the Tensleep Murderers brought some peace to Wyoming's open range. Because the state's government was finally making convictions, cowboys became reluctant to shoot people over grazing rights, knowing that now they could be held accountable for it. One of the prosecutors in the case, Will Metz, summarized the meaning of the verdicts by saying that "it is significant of the beginning of a new era, of a period where lawlessness in any form will be no more tolerated [in Wyoming] than in the more densely settled communities of the east." A monument now marks the site of the raid.&lt;ref name="truewestmagazine.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wyohistory.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tensleepworlandwyoming.net"/&gt;

In 1911, the area where the murders occurred became part of [[Washakie County, Wyoming|Washakie County]].&lt;ref name="newberry.org"&gt;{{Cite web| title=WY: Individual County Chronologies| work=| url=http://historical-county.newberry.org/website/Wyoming/documents/WY_Individual_County_Chronologies.htm#Individual_County_Chronologies| date=| year=2004| accessdate=June 27, 2012| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718043802/http://historical-county.newberry.org/website/Wyoming/documents/WY_Individual_County_Chronologies.htm#Individual_County_Chronologies| archivedate=July 18, 2011| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''substitution principle''' in sustainability is the maxim that processes, services and products should, wherever possible, be replaced with alternatives which have a lower impact on the environment. An example of a strong, hazard-based interpretation of the principle in application to chemicals is: "that hazardous chemicals should be systematically substituted by less hazardous alternatives or preferably alternatives for which no hazards can be identified".&lt;ref&gt;Greenpeace, (2003, 2005). Safer Chemicals Within Reach: Using the Substitution Principle to drive Green Chemistry. London. p.7 [http://www.cleanproduction.org/library/SafeChem.pdf (PDF)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The principle has historically been promoted by environmental groups. The concept is becoming increasingly mainstream, being a key concept in [[green chemistry]] and a central element of EU [[Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals|REACH]] regulation.&lt;ref&gt;European Commission website on REACH. http://ec.europa.eu/environment/chemicals/reach/reach_intro.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Critics of the principle claim it is very difficult to implement in reality, especially in terms of [[legislation]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

Nonetheless, the concept is an important one and a key driver behind identifying Substances of Very High Concern in REACH and the development of hazardous substance lists such as the [http://www.sinlist.org/ SIN List] and the [http://www.etuc.org/a/6023 ETUC Trade Union Priority List]. EU-funded projects such as SubsPort are under development to aid the identification and development of safer substitutes for hazardous chemicals.&lt;ref&gt;Lissner L, Romano D. Substitution for Hazardous Chemicals on an International Level-The Approach of the European Project "SUBSPORT". New Solut. 2011 Jan 1;21(3):477-97. PubMed {{PMID|22001043}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''supersedeas bond''', also known as a defendant's appeal bond, is a type of [[surety bond]] that a court requires from an [[appellant]] who wants to delay payment of a [[Judgment (law)|judgment]] until the [[appeal]] is over.

An appellant's bond to stay execution on a judgment during the pendency of the appeal.  [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure|Fed. R. Civ. P.]] 62(d); [[Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure|Fed. R. App. P.]] 8(b). -- Often shortened to ''supersedeas''.

This is a feature of [[common law]], and in particular the American legal system. In most European countries an appeal leads to an automatic [[stay of execution]], unless the judge expressly ordered immediate execution.

== Definition  ==
According to [[Black's Law Dictionary]] a supersedeas bond (also known as an "appeal bond") is:
{{quote|[A] bond required of one who petitions to set aside a judgment or execution and from which the other party may be made whole if the action is unsuccessful.}}

== Purpose and usage ==

After [[litigation]] and a [[civil court|civil]] [[court ruling]], the losing party can [[appeal]] against the judgment. At this point, both the [[plaintiff]] and [[defendant]] could have similar kinds of concerns. An appeal takes time and can be dragged out in some cases for many years. After the case (and any other processes) is finally decided, whichever party wins will perhaps be more "out of pocket" from its costs. Also time will have passed, and the losing party may be [[bankrupt]] or have used the time to frustrate any potential future payments in the event of losing.

Therefore, it is often either a requirement of the law, or a possible point in a ruling, that prior to commencing its appeal processes, the losing party must provide a [[surety bond]] – money it pays to the court or a third party, to demonstrate its [[good faith]], intention and commitment to meeting the ruling if it loses, and in some cases to show that their appeal is not [[frivolous litigation|frivolous]] or merely a tactic to delay or avoid payment. This is known as a supersedeas (or "appeal") bond, and shows that they can and will cover the damages or fees awarded – including any additional costs of the appeal.

The bond may not be - and often is not – the exact value of the ruling. In some cases it is significantly larger since it is planned to cover interest or other costs which may arise on appeal.

A supersedeas bond is often paid in full – and may be handled via [[insurance]] or [[underwriter|underwriting]] in some cases.

==Supersedeas bond rules in the United States==
The amount and availability of a supersedeas bond depends on state regulations and case specifics. 

In [[New Jersey]], the posting of a bond is not required to appeal a decision.  However, if the party wishes to stay a judgment during the appeal, a motion must be made with the Superior Court, and the Court can require the posting of a bond or cash deposit under R.2:9-5 and R.2:9-6. The same rule applies in Delaware under the State Constitution&lt;ref&gt;http://delcode.delaware.gov/constitution/constitution-05.shtml#P572_88069&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the court rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://courts.delaware.gov/forms/download.aspx?id=39368 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-02-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303190900/http://courts.delaware.gov/forms/download.aspx?id=39368 |archivedate=2016-03-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://courts.delaware.gov/forms/download.aspx?id=39348&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Arizona]] Rules of Civil Appellate Procedure, Rule 7, provides that "except in cases involving custody of children," an appellant may obtain a stay on a lower court judgment and all other further proceedings by filing a supersedeas bond in the Superior Court. ARCAP 7(a)(1).

In [[California]], for instance, the supersedeas bond amount must be 150% of the judgment amount, whereas in Florida, the amount may include two years of statutory interest for those fees.&lt;ref&gt;http://jurisco.com/supersedeas-bonds-money-judgment-appeals/&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Florida]], the amount of a supersedeas bond is limited to no more than $50 million per appellant.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2011/45.045/&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Texas]], the amount of a supersedeas bond (referred to as "security for judgments pending appeal" in the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code) is determined as follows:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/Docs/CP/htm/CP.52.htm Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code, Section 52.006.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Under subsection (a),  the amount of the bond must equal 1) the amount of compensatory damages awarded in the judgment, 2) interest for the estimated duration of the appeal, and 3) costs awarded in the judgment.
* Under subsection (b), notwithstanding the requirements of subsection (a), the security cannot equal the lesser of 1) 50 percent of the judgment debtor's net worth or 2) USD$25 million.
* Under subsection (c), if the judgment debtor shows that the amount of the security would cause "substantial economic harm", the trial court is required to lower it to an amount that would not cause such harm.
* Subsection (d) allows an appellate court to review and modify the amount of security, but not to exceed the limitations above.
* Subsection (e) permits a trial court to enter orders preventing dissipation or transfer of assets to avoid satisfaction of the judgment, but not so as to prohibit use, transfer, conveyance, or dissipation of assets in the normal course of business.

==Bond advantages==
Obtaining a supersedeas bond may appear to be judicial red tape; however, it serves the best interest of the defendant and plaintiff. The appellant uses a supersedeas bond to stay the execution of the judgment, meaning appellant does not have to pay the full amount of the judgment until the appellate court makes a ruling and then only if the ruling is to affirm the judgment. A surety bond also replaces the need for collateral. The plaintiff, or party to whom the money judgment is awarded, is fully protected by the bond and ensured payment, that is if the appealing party can afford the bond. &lt;ref&gt;http://jurisco.com/supersedeas-bonds-money-judgment-appeals/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sweethearting''' in the [[retail loss prevention]] industry means theft by employees at the [[cash register]], by giving away merchandise to a "sweetheart" customer (friend, family, fellow employee).  [[Cashier]]s can do it in numerous ways, including:&lt;ref&gt;Morris, Jeff (Jun 1, 2005 12:00 PM). "[http://multichannelmerchant.com/mag/minding_store/ Minding the Store]", ''MultiChannelMerchant.com''.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Scan avoidance
* [[Price override]]s
* Refund fraud, gift card fraud
* Void fraud
* Invoicing scams

Sweethearting is the most common type of employee theft.&lt;ref&gt;Greenhouse, Steven (December 29, 2009). "[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/30/business/30theft.html?_r=1 Shoplifters? Studies Say Keep an Eye on Workers]", ''NYTimes.com''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Countermeasures==
Most methods of stopping sweethearting include physical supervision of the cashier or installation of software that detects sweethearting, which can be difficult to do.
Common countermeasures include use of [[CCTV]] surveillance cameras and security guards checking customer receipts at exits. A modern, well-implemented and tightly managed retail management system enables store management to track which cashiers may ring up unusually high amounts of merchandise known to be attractive to thieves.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1660">The '''Trial of Fifty''' ({{lang-pt|Processo dos 50}}, or '''Case of Fifty''') was a series of three political trials, beginning on 29 March 1959 with the jailing of Angolan nationalist prisoners in [[Portuguese Angola]].&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Fashioning Africa: Power and the Politics of Dress|author=Allman, J.|date=2004|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=9780253111043|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=_K9Zvt8kkkcC&amp;pg=PA86|page=86|accessdate=2015-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The period ended on 24 August of that year with the final imprisonments. The name refers to the fact that [[Joaquim Pinto de Andrade]] had sent to his brother living abroad, Mário Pinto de Andrade, a pamphlet denouncing the imprisonment of 50 nationalists.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} This denunciation was disseminated, informing the world of what was occurring in Angola, and revealing the true intentions of the  PIDE ([[Policia Internacional e de Defesa do Estado]]), which was to prevent news of the jailings from coming to international attention and prevent drawing attention to the misdeeds of the Salazar regime.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} The news of the jailing of these 50 nationalists also alerted other members of the independence movement to their dangerous situation, leading them to evade capture and setting the scene for the eventual [[Angolan War of Independence]] which began 4 February 1961, when Angolan nationalists launched attacks against jails holding political prisoners.&lt;ref name="google"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7123">'''Truth-seeking''' processes allow societies to examine and come to grips with past crimes and atrocities and prevent their future repetition. Truth-seeking often occurs in societies emerging from a period of prolonged conflict or authoritarian rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ictj.org/our-work/transitional-justice-issues/truth-and-memory|title=Truth-seeking, Memory, and Memorials - ICTJ|date=25 February 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most famous example to date is the [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Africa)|South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission]], although many other examples also exist. Most commonly these are carried out by official [[truth and reconciliation commission]]s as a form of [[restorative justice]], but there are other mechanisms as well.

Through a truth-seeking process, actors in a country are able to investigate past abuses  and seek redress for victims and their families. Such investigations go beyond simply identifying guilty parties or individuals, but may investigate root causes, patterns of suffering, and social impact as well as events in individual cases, such as disappearances.

By seeking to investigate such questions with a high degree of professionalism and commitment, truth-seeking processes seek to create long-lasting public impact, often through the publication of a public report. Such reporting helps expose the facts of violations and suffering, which are often otherwise denied, and minimize possibilities of revisionism in the future.

Given that truth-seeking requires both considerable time and resources to properly tackle investigations and victims’ needs, local community and regional representatives, [[civil society]] organizations, [[Non-governmental organization|NGOs]] and aid agencies, and governmental and judicial entities play different roles in this process.

==The Right to Truth==
Many steps taken in a truth-seeking process are based on the premise of a right to truth. The right to truth entails that victims and communities affected by past crimes have the right to know the identity of suspected perpetrators consistent with the rights of the suspects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ictj.org/publication/ex-combatants-and-truth-commissions|title=Ex-Combatants and Truth Commissions|date=20 April 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[International Center for Transitional Justice]]: "Any person who has suffered atrocities has the unalienable right to know who is responsible; any family whose members have disappeared has the basic right discover their fate and whereabouts; every society where these crimes have taken place have the right to learn their history without lies or denial."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.ictj.org/gallery-items/right-truth|title = Right to the Truth|last =|first =|date =|website =|publisher = International Center for Transitional Justice|access-date = 9 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The right to truth is an emerging principle in customary international law. It has been recognized in the United Nations Principles on Impunity&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://derechos.org/nizkor/impu/principles.html|title=Equipo Nizkor - Updated Set of principles for the protection and promotion of human rights through action to combat impunity.|website=derechos.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequent [[UN]] materials, and the UN has declared March 24 to be the "International Day for the Right to the Truth Concerning Gross Human Rights Violations and for the Dignity of Victims" in memory of Archbishop [[Óscar Romero|Oscar Romero]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.un.org/en/events/righttotruthday/documents.shtml|title = International Day for the Right to the Truth Concerning Gross Human Rights Violations and for the Dignity of Victims|last =|first =|date =|website =|publisher = United Nations|access-date = 9 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The right to truth has also been proclaimedby regional  bodies such as the [[Inter-American Court of Human Rights]], and in some national courts.

==Truth-seeking Mechanisms==
Frequently used tactics during truth-seeking include the protection of evidence, collection of extensive victim data and testimony, the opening and maintenance of state information and public archives, and the publication of comprehensive reports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ictj.org/our-work/transitional-justice-issues/truth-and-memory|title=Truth-seeking, Memory, and Memorials - ICTJ|date=25 February 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; To implement such practices, [[truth commissions]] are often established to represent voices of victims. Such commissions are typically independent in nature and focus on accountability for past crimes, the root causes for the conflict and constructing historical narratives countering revisionism of the past. Policy recommendations issued by commissions often lead to a call for national reforms and further [[transitional justice]] initiatives, such as reparations, vetting and prosecutions.

Official truth commissions (often called truth and reconciliation commissions) have taken place in many countries, including [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Africa)|South Africa]], [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (Peru)|Peru]], [[Commission for Reception, Truth and Reconciliation in East Timor|Timor-Leste]], [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (Liberia)|Liberia]], the [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (Solomon Islands)|Solomon Islands]], and [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Korea)|South Korea]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.usip.org/resources-tools/latest?filter1=**ALL**&amp;filter0=**ALL**&amp;filter2=2222&amp;filter3=**ALL**&amp;filter4=&lt;/ref&gt; Most recently truth commissions have begun to be implemented in developed countries such as [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (Canada)|Canada]] and [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (Germany)|Germany]].

==Unofficial or Local Truth-seeking==
Unofficial or local truth-seeking projects became popular in the 1980s and 1990s in Latin America, when community organizations such as churches and academic institutions documented human rights violations and issued reports following the end to military rule. Though unofficial, such efforts from civil society often serve to pave the way for or complement state- led transitional justice initiatives, and sometimes produce superior results, as in [[Historical Clarification Commission|Guatemala]]. Unofficial truth-seeking initiatives have also taken place more recently at the local level in Northern Ireland, the [[Greensboro Truth and Reconciliation Commission|United States]], [[The Jeju 4.3 Committee|South Korea]], and elsewhere. Calls for truth-seeking processes continue to be debated in other countries, such as [[Truth and Reconciliation in Cambodia|Cambodia]] and [[Truth and Reconciliation in Colombia|Colombia]].

'''''Two Treatises of Government'''''  (or '''''Two Treatises of Government: In the Former, The False Principles, and Foundation of Sir Robert Filmer, and His Followers, Are Detected and Overthrown. The Latter Is an Essay Concerning The True Original, Extent, and End of Civil Government''''') is a work of [[political philosophy]] published anonymously in 1689 by [[John Locke]]. The ''First Treatise'' attacks [[patriarchalism]] in the form of sentence-by-sentence refutation of [[Robert Filmer]]'s ''[[Patriarcha]]'', while the ''Second Treatise'' outlines Locke's ideas for a more civilized society based on [[natural rights]] and [[social contract|contract theory]].

This publication contrasts former political works by Locke himself.

==Historical context==
King [[James II of England]] (VII of Scotland) was overthrown in 1688 by a union of Parliamentarians and the [[stadtholder]] of the [[Dutch Republic]] William III of Oranje-Nassau (William of Orange), who as a result ascended the English throne as [[William III of England]]. This is known as the [[Glorious Revolution]], also called the Revolution of 1688. Locke claims in the "Preface" to the ''Two Treatises'' that its purpose is to justify William III's ascension to the throne, though [[Peter Laslett]] suggests that the bulk of the writing was instead completed between 1679–1680 (and subsequently revised until Locke was driven into exile in 1683).&lt;ref&gt;Laslett, "Introduction," 59–61.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Laslett, Locke was writing his ''Two Treatises'' during the [[Exclusion Crisis]], which attempted to prevent James II from ever taking the throne in the first place. [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury]], Locke's mentor, patron and friend, introduced the bill, but it was ultimately unsuccessful. [[Richard Ashcraft]], following in Laslett's suggestion that the ''Two Treatises'' were written before the Revolution, objected that Shaftesbury's party did not advocate revolution during the Exclusion Crisis. He suggests that they are instead better associated with the revolutionary conspiracies that swirled around what would come to be known as the [[Rye House Plot]].&lt;ref&gt;Ashcraft, ''Revolutionary Politics''.&lt;/ref&gt; Locke, Shaftesbury and many others were forced into exile; some, such as Sidney, were even executed for treason. Locke knew his work was dangerous—he never acknowledged his authorship within his lifetime.

==Publication history==
[[File:LockeTreatiseAmerica.png|200px|thumb|left|The only edition of the ''Treatises'' published in America during the 18th century (1773)]]
''Two Treatises'' was first published, anonymously, in December 1689 (following printing conventions of the time, its title page was marked 1690). Locke was unhappy with this edition, complaining to the publisher about its many errors. For the rest of his life, he was intent on republishing the ''Two Treatises'' in a form that better reflected his meaning. Peter Laslett, one of the foremost Locke scholars, has suggested that Locke held the printers to a higher "standard of perfection" than the technology of the time would permit.&lt;ref&gt;Laslett, Peter. "Introduction." ''Two Treatises of Government''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press (1988), 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Be that as it may, the first edition was indeed replete with errors.  The second edition was even worse, and finally printed on cheap paper and sold to the poor. The third edition was much improved, but Locke was still not satisfied.&lt;ref&gt;See {{Cite book |last= |first= |author-link= |year=1698 |editor-last= |editor-first= |contribution= |title=Two Treatises of Government: In The Former the False Principles and Foundation of Sir Robert Filmer and His Followers, are Detected and Overthrown.

The ''Two Treatises'' begin with a Preface announcing what Locke hopes to achieve, but he also mentions that more than half of his original draft, occupying a space between the ''First'' and ''Second Treatises'', has been irretrievably lost.&lt;ref&gt;Locke, John. ''Two Treatises of Government''. Ed. Peter Laslett. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press (1988), 137.&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Laslett maintains that, while Locke may have added or altered some portions in 1689, he did not make any revisions to accommodate for the missing section; he argues, for example, that the end of the ''First Treatise'' breaks off in mid-sentence.&lt;ref&gt;Laslett, "English Revolution," 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1691 ''Two Treatises'' was translated into French by David Mazzel, a French [[Huguenot]] living in the Netherlands. This translation left out Locke's "Preface," all of the ''First Treatise'', and the first chapter of the ''Second Treatise'' (which summarised Locke's conclusions in the ''First Treatise''). It was in this form that Locke's work was reprinted during the 18th century in France and in this form that [[Montesquieu]], [[Voltaire]] and [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]] were exposed to it.&lt;ref&gt;Laslett, "Introduction," 12–13.&lt;/ref&gt; The only American edition from the 18th century was printed in 1773 in Boston; it, too, left out all of these sections. There were no other American editions until the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Laslett, "Introduction," 14–15.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Main ideas==
''Two Treatises'' is divided into the ''First Treatise'' and the ''Second Treatise''. The original title of the ''Second Treatise'' appears to have been simply "Book II," corresponding to the title of the ''First Treatise'', "Book I."  Before publication, however, Locke gave it greater prominence by (hastily) inserting a separate title page:  "An Essay Concerning the True Original, Extent and End of Civil Government."&lt;ref&gt;Laslett, 266.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''First Treatise'' is focused on the refutation of [[Robert Filmer|Sir Robert Filmer]], in particular his ''Patriarcha'', which argued that civil society was founded on a divinely sanctioned patriarchalism. Locke proceeds through Filmer's arguments, contesting his proofs from [[Scripture]] and ridiculing them as senseless, until concluding that no government can be justified by an appeal to the [[divine right of kings]].

The ''Second Treatise'' outlines a theory of civil society. Locke begins by describing the [[state of nature]], a picture much more stable than [[Thomas Hobbes]]' state of "war of every man against every man," and argues that all men are created equal in the state of nature by God. From this, he goes on to explain the hypothetical rise of property and civilization, in the process explaining that the only legitimate governments are those that have the consent of the people. Therefore, any government that rules without the consent of the people can, in theory, be overthrown.

==''First Treatise''==
[[File:Patriarcha; or the Natural Power of Kings.jpg|200px|right|thumb|Title page from [[Robert Filmer|Filmer's]] ''Patriarcha'' (1680)]]
The ''First Treatise'' is an extended attack on [[Sir Robert Filmer]]'s ''Patriarcha''. Locke's argument proceeds along two lines:  first, he undercuts the Scriptural support that Filmer had offered for his thesis, and second he argues that the acceptance of Filmer's thesis can lead only to slavery (and absurdity). Locke chose Filmer as his target, he says, because of his reputation and because he "carried this Argument [''jure divino''] farthest, and is supposed to have brought it to perfection" (1st Tr., §&amp;nbsp;5).

Filmer's text presented an argument for a [[divine right of kings|divinely ordained]], [[hereditary monarchy|hereditary]], [[absolute monarchy|absolute]] monarchy. According to Filmer, [[Adam and Eve|the Biblical Adam]] in his role as father possessed unlimited power over his children and this authority passed down through the generations. Locke attacks this on several grounds. Accepting that fatherhood grants authority, he argues, it would do so only by the act of begetting, and so cannot be transmitted to one's children because only God can create life. Nor is the power of a father over his children absolute, as Filmer would have it; Locke points to the joint power parents share over their children referred to in the Bible. In the ''Second Treatise'' Locke returns to a discussion of parental power. (Both of these discussions have drawn the interest of modern [[feminism|feminists]] such as [[Carole Pateman]].)

Filmer also suggested that Adam's absolute authority came from his [[property|ownership]] over all the world. To this, Locke responds that the world was originally held in common (a theme that will return in the ''Second Treatise''). But, even if it were not, he argues, God's grant to Adam covered only the land and brute animals, not human beings. Nor could Adam, or his heir, leverage this grant to enslave mankind, for the [[natural law|law of nature]] forbids reducing one's fellows to a state of desperation, if one possesses a sufficient surplus to maintain oneself securely. And even if this charity were not commanded by reason, Locke continues, such a strategy for gaining dominion would prove only that the foundation of government lies in consent.

Locke intimates in the ''First Treatise'' that the doctrine of [[divine right of kings]] (''jure divino'') will eventually be the downfall of all governments. In his final chapter he asks, "Who heir?"  If Filmer is correct, there should be only one rightful king in all the world—the heir of Adam. But since it is impossible to discover the true heir of Adam, no government, under Filmer's principles, can require that its members obey its rulers. Filmer must therefore say that men are duty-bound to obey their present rulers. Locke writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I think he is the first Politician, who, pretending to settle Government upon its true Basis, and to establish the Thrones of lawful Princes, ever told the World, That he was ''properly a King, whose Manner of Government was by Supreme Power, by what Means soever he obtained it''; which in plain ''English'' is to say, that Regal and Supreme Power is properly and truly his, who can by any Means seize upon it; and if this be, to be ''properly a King'', I wonder how he came to think of, or where he will find, an ''Usurper''.  (1st Tr., §&amp;nbsp;79)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Locke ends the ''First Treatise'' by examining the history told in the Bible and the history of the world since then; he concludes that there is no evidence to support Filmer's hypothesis. According to Locke, no king has ever claimed that his authority rested upon his being the heir of Adam. It is [[Robert Filmer|Filmer]], Locke alleges, who is the innovator in politics, not those who assert the natural equality and freedom of man.

==''Second Treatise''==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2008}}
In the ''Second Treatise'' Locke develops a number of notable themes. It begins with a depiction of the [[state of nature]], wherein individuals are under no obligation to obey one another but are each themselves judge of what the [[natural law|law of nature]] requires. It also covers conquest and slavery, property, representative government, and the right of revolution.

===State of nature===
Locke defines the state of nature thus:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
To properly understand political power and trace its origins, we must consider the state that all people are in naturally.
That is a state of perfect freedom of acting and disposing of their own possessions and persons as they think fit within the bounds of the law of nature. People in this state do not have to ask permission to act or depend on the will of others to arrange matters on their behalf. The natural state is also one of equality in which all power and jurisdiction is reciprocal and no one has more than another. It is evident that all human beings—as creatures belonging to the same species and rank and born indiscriminately with all the same natural advantages and faculties—are equal amongst themselves. They have no relationship of subordination or subjection unless God (the lord and master of them all) had clearly set one person above another and conferred on him an undoubted right to dominion and sovereignty.&lt;ref&gt;''Two Treatises On Government: A Translation Into Modern English'', ISR/Google Books, 2009, p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=d_4BGe7-pFIC&amp;pg=PA106&amp;lpg=PA106&amp;dq=%22To+properly+understand+political+power+and+trace+its+origins,+we+must+consider+the+state+that+all+people+are+in+naturally.+That+is+a+state+of+perfect+freedom+of+acting+and+disposing+of+their+own+possessions+and+persons+as+they+think+fit+within+the+bounds&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=XBknIlI2v2&amp;sig=E1ATOrww4ECFdDHuTaXUG-UQWPs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj21K-K8-7QAhXqAMAKHaJPD5MQ6AEIKzAC#v=onepage&amp;q=%22To+properly+understand+political+power+and+trace+its+origins,+we+must+consider+the+state+that+all+people+are+in+naturally.+That+is+a+state+of+perfect+freedom+of+acting+and+disposing+of+their+own+possessions+and+persons+as+they+think+fit+within+the+bounds&amp;f=false|title=Two Treatises on Government: A Translation Into Modern English|first=John|last=Locke|date=15 August 2013|publisher=Industrial Systems Research|via=Google Books|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220193727/https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=d_4BGe7-pFIC&amp;pg=PA106&amp;lpg=PA106&amp;dq=%22To+properly+understand+political+power+and+trace+its+origins,+we+must+consider+the+state+that+all+people+are+in+naturally.+That+is+a+state+of+perfect+freedom+of+acting+and+disposing+of+their+own+possessions+and+persons+as+they+think+fit+within+the+bounds&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=XBknIlI2v2&amp;sig=E1ATOrww4ECFdDHuTaXUG-UQWPs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj21K-K8-7QAhXqAMAKHaJPD5MQ6AEIKzAC#v=onepage&amp;q=%22To+properly+understand+political+power+and+trace+its+origins,+we+must+consider+the+state+that+all+people+are+in+naturally.+That+is+a+state+of+perfect+freedom+of+acting+and+disposing+of+their+own+possessions+and+persons+as+they+think+fit+within+the+bounds&amp;f=false|archivedate=20 December 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The work of [[Thomas Hobbes]] made theories based upon a [[state of nature]] popular in [[Early Modern Britain|17th-century England]], even as most of those who employed such arguments were deeply troubled by his absolutist conclusions. Locke's state of nature can be seen in light of this tradition. There is not and never has been any divinely ordained monarch over the entire world, Locke argues. However, the fact that the natural state of humanity is without an institutionalized government does not mean it is lawless. Human beings are still subject to the laws of God and nature. In contrast to Hobbes, who posited the state of nature as a hypothetical possibility, Locke takes great pains to show that such a state did indeed exist. Actually, it still exists in the area of international relations where there is not and is never likely to be any legitimate overarching government (i.e., one directly chosen by all the people subject to it).  Whereas Hobbes stresses the disadvantages of the state of nature, Locke points to its good points. It is free, if full of continual dangers (2nd Tr., §&amp;nbsp;123). Finally, the proper alternative to the natural state is not political dictatorship/tyranny but democratically elected government and the effective protection of basic human rights to life, liberty, and property under the rule of law.

Nobody in the natural state has the political power to tell others what to do. However, everybody has the right to authoritatively pronounce justice and administer punishment for breaches of the natural law. Thus, men are not free to do whatever they please.  "The state of nature has a law of nature to govern it, which obliges every one: and reason, which is that law, teaches all mankind, who will but consult it, that... no one ought to harm another in his life, health, liberty, or possessions" (2nd Tr., §&amp;nbsp;6).  The specifics of this law are unwritten, however, and so each is likely to misapply it in his own case.  Lacking any commonly recognised, impartial judge, there is no way to correct these misapplications or to effectively restrain those who violate the law of nature.

The law of nature is therefore ill enforced in the state of nature.
&lt;blockquote&gt;IF man in the state of nature be so free, as has been said; if he be absolute lord of his own person and possessions, equal to the greatest, and subject to no body, why will he part with his freedom? Why will he give up this empire, and subject himself to the dominion and control of any other power? To which it is obvious to answer, that though in the state of nature he hath such a right, yet the enjoyment of it is very uncertain, and constantly exposed to the invasion of others: for all being kings as much as he, every man his equal, and the greater part no strict observers of equity and justice, the enjoyment of the property he has in this state is very unsafe, very unsecure. This makes him willing to quit a condition, which, however free, is full of fears and continual dangers: and it is not without reason, that he seeks out, and is willing to join in society with others, who are already united, or have a mind to unite, for the mutual preservation of their lives, liberties and estates, which I call by the general name, property.  (2nd Tr., §&amp;nbsp;123)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
It is to avoid the state of war that often occurs in the state of nature, and to protect their [[private property]] that men enter into civil or political society, i.e., state of society.

===Conquest and slavery===
Ch. 4 ("Of Slavery") and Ch. 16 ("Of Conquest") are sources of some confusion:  the former provides a justification for [[slavery]], the latter, the [[Right of conquest|rights of conquerors]]. Because the ''[[Fundamental Constitutions of Carolina]]'' provided that a master had perfect authority over his slaves, some{{who|date=January 2014}} have taken these chapters to be an [[apologetics|apology]] for the institution of [[slavery in Colonial America]].

Most Locke scholars{{who|date=January 2014}} roundly reject this reading, as it is directly at odds with the text. The extent of Locke's involvement in drafting the ''Fundamental Constitutions'' is a matter of some debate, but even attributing full culpability for its contents and for his having profited from the [[Atlantic slave trade]], the majority of experts will concede that Locke may have been a hypocrite in this matter, but are adamant that no part of the ''Two Treatises'' can be used to provide theoretical support for slavery by bare right of conquest.

In the rhetoric of 17th-century England, those who opposed the increasing power of the kings claimed that the country was headed for a condition of slavery. Locke therefore asks, facetiously, under what conditions such slavery might be justified. He notes that slavery cannot come about as a matter of contract (which became the basis of Locke's political system). To be a slave is to be subject to the absolute, arbitrary power of another; as men do not have this power even over themselves, they cannot sell or otherwise grant it to another. One that is deserving of death, i.e., who has violated the [[natural law|law of nature]], may be enslaved. This is, however, but the state of war continued (2nd Tr., §&amp;nbsp;24), and even one justly a slave therefore has no obligation to obedience.

In providing a justification for slavery, he has rendered all forms of slavery as it actually exists invalid. Moreover, as one may not submit to slavery, there is a moral injunction to attempt to throw off and escape it whenever it looms. Most scholars take this to be Locke's point regarding slavery:  submission to [[absolute monarchy]] is a violation of the law of nature, for one does not have the right to enslave oneself.

The legitimacy of an [[List of British monarchs|English king]] depended on (somehow) demonstrating descent from [[William I of England|William the Conqueror]]:  the [[right of conquest]] was therefore a topic rife with constitutional connotations. Locke does not say that all subsequent English monarchs have been illegitimate, but he does make their rightful authority dependent solely upon their having acquired the people's approbation.

Locke first argues that, clearly, aggressors in an unjust war can claim no right of conquest:  everything they despoil may be retaken as soon as the dispossessed have the strength to do so.  Their children retain this right, so an ancient usurpation does not become lawful with time.  The rest of the chapter then considers what rights a just conqueror might have.

The argument proceeds negatively:  Locke proposes one power a conqueror could gain, and then demonstrates how in point of fact that power cannot be claimed.  He gains no authority over those that conquered with him, for they did not wage war unjustly:  thus, whatever other right William may have had in England, he could not claim kingship over his fellow [[Normans]] by right of conquest. The subdued are under the conqueror's despotical authority, but only those who actually took part in the fighting. Those who were governed by the defeated aggressor do not become subject to the authority of the victorious aggressor. They lacked the power to do an unjust thing, and so could not have granted that power to their governors:  the aggressor therefore was not acting as their representative, and they cannot be punished for his actions.  And while the conqueror may seize the person of the vanquished aggressor in an unjust war, he cannot seize the latter's property:  he may not drive the innocent wife and children of a villain into poverty for another's unjust acts. While the property is technically that of the defeated, his innocent dependents have a claim that the just conqueror must honour.  He cannot seize more than the vanquished could forfeit, and the latter had no right to ruin his dependents.  (He may, however, demand and take reparations for the damages suffered in the war, so long as these leave enough in the possession of the aggressor's dependants for their survival).

In so arguing, Locke accomplishes two objectives.  First, he neutralises the claims of those who see all authority flowing from William I by the latter's right of conquest.  In the absence of any other claims to authority (e.g., [[Robert Filmer|Filmer]]'s [[primogeniture]] from [[Adam and Eve|Adam]], [[divine right of kings|divine]] [[anointing|anointment]], etc.), all kings would have to found their authority on the [[consent of the governed]]. Second, he removes much of the incentive for conquest in the first place, for even in a just war the spoils are limited to the persons of the defeated and reparations sufficient only to cover the costs of the war, and even then only when the aggressor's territory can easily sustain such costs (i.e., it can never be a profitable endeavour). Needless to say, the bare claim that one's spoils are the just compensation for a just war does not suffice to make it so, in Locke's view.

===Property===

In the ''Second Treatise'', Locke claims that [[civil society]] was created for the protection of [[property]].&lt;ref&gt;Second Treatise, Sec. 85&lt;/ref&gt; In saying this, he relies on the etymological root of "property," [[Latin]] ''proprius'', or what is one's own, including oneself (cf. French ''propre''). Thus, by "property" he means "life, liberty, and estate."  By saying that political society was established for the better protection of property, he claims that it serves the private (and non-political) interests of its constituent members: it does not promote some good that can be realised only in community with others (e.g., virtue).

For this account to work, individuals must possess some property outside of society, i.e., in the [[state of nature]]:  the state cannot be the sole origin of property, declaring what belongs to whom. If the purpose of government is the protection of property, the latter must exist independently of the former. [[Sir Robert Filmer|Filmer]] had said that, if there even were a state of nature (which he denied), everything would be held in common:  there could be no private property, and hence no justice or injustice (injustice being understood as treating someone else's goods, liberty, or life as if it were one's own).  [[Thomas Hobbes]] had argued the same thing. Locke therefore provides an account of how material property could arise in the absence of government.

He begins by asserting that each individual, at a minimum, "owns" himself; this is a corollary of each individual's being free and equal in the state of nature. As a result, each must also own his own labour:  to deny him his labour would be to make him a slave.  One can therefore take items from the common store of goods by mixing one's labour with them:  an apple on the tree is of no use to anyone—it must be picked to be eaten—and the picking of that apple makes it one's own.  In an alternate argument, Locke claims that we must allow it to become private property lest all mankind have starved, despite the bounty of the world.  A man must be allowed to eat, and thus have what he has eaten be his own (such that he could deny others a right to use it).  The apple is surely his when he swallows it, when he chews it, when he bites into it, when he brings it to his mouth, etc.:  it became his as soon as he mixed his labour with it (by picking it from the tree).

This does not yet say ''why'' an individual is allowed to take from the common store of nature.  There is a necessity to do so to eat, but this does not yet establish why others must respect one's property, especially as they labour under the like necessity.  Locke assures his readers that the [[state of nature]] is a state of plenty:  one may take from communal store if one leaves a) enough and b) as good for others, and since nature is bountiful, one can take all that one can use without taking anything ''from'' someone else.  Moreover, one can take only so much as one can use before it spoils.  There are then two provisos regarding what one can take, the "enough and as good" condition and "spoilage."

Gold does not rot.  Neither does silver, or any other precious metal or gem.  They are, moreover, useless, their aesthetic value not entering into the equation.  One can heap up as much of them as one wishes, or take them in trade for food.  By the tacit consent of mankind, they become a form of money (one accepts gold in exchange for apples with the understanding that someone else will accept that gold in exchange for wheat).  One can therefore avoid the spoilage limitation by selling all that one has amassed before it rots; the limits on acquisition thus disappear.

In this way, Locke argues that a full economic system could, in principle, exist within the [[state of nature]]. Property could therefore predate the existence of government, and thus society can be dedicated to the protection of property.

===Representative government===
Locke did not demand a republic. Rather, Locke felt that a legitimate contract could easily exist between citizens and a monarchy, an oligarchy or some mixed form (''2nd Tr.'', sec. 132). Locke uses the term Common-wealth to mean "not a democracy, or any form of government, but any independent community" (sec. 133) and "whatever form the Common-wealth is under, the Ruling Power ought to govern by declared and received laws, and not by extemporary dictates and undetermined resolutions." (sec 137)

Locke does, however, make a distinction between an executive (e.g. a monarchy), a "Power always in being" (sec 144) that must perpetually execute the law, and the legislative that is the "supreme power of the Common-wealth" (sec 134) and does not have to be always in being. (sec 153) Furthermore, governments are charged by the consent of the individual, "i.e. the consent of the majority, giving it either by themselves, or their representatives chosen by them." (sec 140)

His notions of people's rights and the role of civil government provided strong support for the intellectual movements of both revolutions.

===Right of revolution===
The concept of the right of revolution was also taken up by John Locke in ''Two Treatises of Government'' as part of his [[social contract]] theory.  Locke declared that under [[natural law]], all [[people]] have the right to [[life]], [[liberty]], and [[estate (law)|estate]]; under the social contract, the people could instigate a [[revolution]] against the government when it acted against the interests of [[citizenship|citizens]], to replace the government with one that served the interests of citizens.  In some cases, Locke deemed revolution an obligation.  The right of revolution thus essentially acted as a safeguard against [[tyrant|tyranny]].

Locke affirmed an explicit right to revolution in ''Two Treatises of Government'': “''whenever the Legislators endeavor to take away, and destroy the Property of the People'', or to reduce them to Slavery under Arbitrary Power, they put themselves into a state of War with the People, who are thereupon absolved from any farther Obedience, and are left to the common Refuge, which God hath provided for all Men, against Force and Violence. Whensoever therefore the ''Legislative'' shall transgress this fundamental Rule of Society; and either by Ambition, Fear, Folly or Corruption, ''endeavor to grasp'' themselves, ''or put into the hands of any other an Absolute Power'' over the Lives, Liberties, and Estates of the People; By this breach of Trust ''they forfeit the Power'', the People had put into their hands, for quite contrary ends, and it devolves to the People, who have a Right to resume their original Liberty.” (sec. 222) &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fee.org/the_freeman/detail/john-locke-natural-rights-to-life-liberty-and-property#axzz2qx7Z9g7e Powell, Jim (1 August 1996): "John Locke: Natural Rights to Life, Liberty, and Property".] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140204014810/http://www.fee.org/the_freeman/detail/john-locke-natural-rights-to-life-liberty-and-property |date=4 February 2014 }} In: ''The Freemann''.

==Reception and influence==

===Britain===
Although the ''Two Treatises'' would become well known in the second half of the 18th century, they were somewhat neglected when published. Between 1689 and 1694, around 200 tracts and treatises were published concerning the legitimacy of the [[Glorious Revolution]]. Three of these mention Locke, two of which were written by friends of Locke.&lt;ref&gt;Goldie, Mark. “Introduction.” ''The Reception of Locke's Politics''. 6 vols. London: Pickering &amp; Chatto (1999), xxii.&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Thomas Hobbes|Hobbes]] published the ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'' in 1651, by contrast, dozens of texts were immediately written in response to it. As [[Mark Goldie]] explains: "''Leviathan'' was a monolithic and unavoidable presence for political writers in Restoration England in a way that in the first half of the eighteenth the ''Two Treatises'' was not."&lt;ref&gt;Goldie, "Introduction," xxii.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the ''Two Treatises'' did not become popular until the 1760s, ideas from them did start to become important earlier in the century. According to Goldie, "the crucial moment was 1701" and "the occasion was the [[Kentish petition]]." The pamphlet war that ensued was one of the first times Locke's ideas were invoked in a public debate, most notably by [[Daniel Defoe]].&lt;ref&gt;Goldie, "Introduction," xxxi.&lt;/ref&gt; Locke's ideas did not go unchallenged and the periodical ''The Rehearsal'', for example, launched a "sustained and sophisticated assault” against the ''Two Treatises'' and endorsed the ideology of patriarchalism.&lt;ref&gt;Goldie, "Introduction," xxiv.&lt;/ref&gt; Not only did patriarchalism continue to be a legitimate political theory in the 18th century, but as J. G. A. Pocock and others have gone to great lengths to demonstrate, so was [[civic humanism]] and [[classical republicanism]]. Pocock has argued that Locke's ''Two Treatises'' had very little effect on British political theory; he maintains that there was no contractarian revolution. Rather, he sees these other long-standing traditions as far more important for 18th-century British politics.&lt;ref&gt;Goldie, "Introduction," xxviii.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the middle of the 18th century, Locke's position as a political philosopher suddenly rose in prominence. For example, he was invoked by those arguing on behalf of the American colonies during the [[Stamp Act]] debates of 1765–66.&lt;ref&gt;Goldie, "Introduction," xxxv.&lt;/ref&gt; Marginalized groups such as women, [[nonconformism|Dissenters]] and those campaigning to abolish the [[slavery|slave trade]] all invoked Lockean ideals. But at the same time, as Goldie describes it, "a wind of doubt about Locke's credentials gathered into a storm. The sense that Locke's philosophy had been misappropriated increasingly turned to a conviction that it was erroneous.”&lt;ref&gt;Goldie, "Introduction, xxxviii.&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1790s Locke was associated with [[Rousseau]] and [[Voltaire]] and being blamed for the [[American Revolution|American]] and [[French Revolution]]s as well as for the perceived secularisation of society.&lt;ref&gt;Goldie, "Introduction," xxxviii.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1815, Locke's portrait was taken down from Christ Church, his alma mater (it was later restored to a position of prominence, and currently hangs in the dining hall of the college).

===North America===
Locke's influence during the American Revolutionary period is disputed. While it is easy to point to specific instances of Locke's ''Two Treatises'' being invoked, the extent of the acceptance of Locke's ideals and the role they played in the [[American Revolution]] are far from clear. The ''Two Treatises'' are echoed in phrases in the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] and writings by [[Samuel Adams]] that attempted to gain support for the rebellion. Of Locke's influence [[Thomas Jefferson]] wrote: "[[Francis Bacon|Bacon]], [[John Locke|Locke]] and [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] I consider them as the three greatest men that have ever lived, without any exception, and as having laid the foundation of those superstructures which have been raised in the Physical &amp; Moral sciences".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Letters of Thomas Jefferson: 1743–1826 Bacon, Locke, and Newton |url=http://www.let.rug.nl/usa/P/tj3/writings/brf/jefl74.htm |publisher= |accessdate=2009-07-12 |quote=Bacon, Locke and Newton, whose pictures I will trouble you to have copied for me: and as I consider them as the three greatest men that have ever lived, without any exception, and as having laid the foundation of those superstructures which have been raised in the Physical &amp; Moral sciences. |deadurl=no |archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20090615160740/http://www.let.rug.nl/usa/P/tj3/writings/brf/jefl74.htm |archivedate=15 June 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://explorer.monticello.org/text/index.php?id=82&amp;type=4 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-08-28 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121112020132/http://explorer.monticello.org/text/index.php?id=82&amp;type=4 |archivedate=12 November 2012 |df=dmy-all }} Jefferson called Bacon, Newton, and Locke, who had so indelibly shaped his ideas, "my trinity of the three greatest men the world had ever produced"&lt;/ref&gt; The colonists frequently cited [[William Blackstone|Blackstone's]] ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]'', which synthesised Lockean political philosophy with the [[common law]] tradition. [[Louis Hartz]], writing at the beginning of the 20th century, took it for granted that Locke was the political philosopher of the revolution.

This view was challenged by [[Bernard Bailyn]] and [[Gordon S. Wood]], who argued that the revolution was not a struggle over property, taxation, and rights, but rather "a Machiavellian effort to preserve the young republic's 'virtue' from the corrupt and corrupting forces of English politics."&lt;ref name="GoldieIntroduction"&gt;Goldie, "Introduction," liii.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Garry Wills]], on the other hand, maintains that it was neither the Lockean tradition nor the classical republican tradition that drove the revolution, but instead Scottish moral philosophy, a political philosophy that based its conception of society on friendship, [[sensibility]] and the controlled passions.&lt;ref name="GoldieIntroduction" /&gt; [[Thomas Pangle]] and [[Michael Zuckert]] have countered, demonstrating numerous elements in the thought of more influential founders that have a Lockean pedigree.&lt;ref&gt;Pangle, ''Spirit of Modern Republicanism''; Zuckert, ''Launching Liberalism'', ''Natural Rights Republic''.&lt;/ref&gt; They argue that there is no conflict between Lockean thought and classical Republicanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb| Zuckert |1994|loc=chpt. 7–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Huyler 1995 loc=chpt. 4,5"&gt;{{harvnb| Huyler |1995|loc=chpt. 4,5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Natural Rights Liberalism from Locke to Nozick |editor=Ellen Frankel Paul |editor2=Fred D.

==Controversies regarding interpretation==
Locke’s political philosophy is often compared and contrasted with [[Thomas Hobbes]]’ ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]''. The motivation in both cases is self-preservation with Hobbes arguing the need of an absolute monarch to prevent the war of “all against all” inherent in anarchy while Locke argues that the protection of life, liberty, and property can be achieved by a parliamentary process that protects, not violates, one’s rights.

[[Leo Strauss]] and [[C. B. Macpherson]] stress the continuity of thought. In their view Locke and Hobbes describe an atomistic man largely driven by a hedonistic materialistic acquisitiveness. Strauss’ Locke is little more than Hobbes in “sheep’s clothing.”&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb| Huyler |1995|pp=13, 130}}&lt;/ref&gt; C. B. Macpherson argued in his ''Political Theory of Possessive Individualism'' that Locke sets the stage for unlimited acquisition and appropriation of property by the powerful creating gross inequality. Government is the protector of interests of capitalists while the “labouring class [are] not considered to have an interest.”&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb | Huyler |1995|pp=102, 120}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb | Macpherson | 1962 |p=228}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike Macpherson, [[James Tully (philosopher)|James Tully]] finds no evidence that Locke specifically advocates capitalism. In his ''A Discourse on Property'', Tully describes Locke’s view of man as a social dependent, with Christian sensibilities, and a God-given duty to care for others. Property, in Tully’s explanation of Locke, belong to the community as the public commons but becomes “private” so long as the property owner, or more correctly the “custodian,” serves the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb| Huyler |1995|pp=130–35}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zuckert believes Tully is reading into Locke rights and duties that just aren’t there.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb| Zuckert |1994|p=367}}&lt;/ref&gt; Huyler finds that Locke explicitly condemned government privileges for rich, contrary to Macpherson’s pro-capitalism critique, but also rejected subsidies to aid the poor, in contrast to Tully’s social justice apologetics.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb| Huyler |1995|pp=162–71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cambridge School of political thought, led principally by [[Quentin Skinner]], [[J. G. A. Pocock]], Richard Ashcraft, and [[Peter Laslett]], uses a historical methodology to situate Locke in the ''political'' context of his times. But they also restrict his importance to those times.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb| Huyler |1995|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ashcraft’s Locke takes the side of the burgeoning merchant class against the aristocracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ashcraft|1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Neal Wood]] puts Locke on the side of the agrarian interests, not the manufacturing bourgeoisie.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb| Huyler |1995|pp=104–05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jerome Huyler and Michael. P. Zuckert approach Locke in the broader context of his oeuvre and historical influence. Locke is situated within changing religious, philosophical, scientific, and political dimensions of 17th century England. Objecting to the use of the contemporary concept of [[economic man]] to describe Locke’s view of human nature, Huyler emphases the “virtue of industriousness” of Locke’s Protestant England. Productive work is man’s earthly function or calling, ordained by God and required by self-preservation. The government’s protection of property rights insures that the results of industry, i.e. “fruits of one’s labor,” are secure. Locke’s prohibition of ill-gotten gains, whether for well-connected gentry or the profligate, is not a lack of Locke’s foresight to the problems in the latter stages of liberalism but an application of equal protection of the law to every individual.&lt;ref name="Huyler 1995 loc=chpt. 4,5" /&gt;

[[Richard Pipes]] argues that Locke holds a [[labor theory of value]] that leads to the socialist critique that those not engaging in physical labor exploit wage earners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Pipes |first=Richard |title=Property and Freedom |page=36 |year=1999 |publisher=Knopf |isbn=978-0375404986}}&lt;/ref&gt; Huyler, relying on Locke’s ''Essays on the Law of Nature'' shows that reason is the most fundamental virtue, underwrites all productive virtue, and leads to human [[Eudaimonia|flourishing]] or happiness in an [[Aristotle|Aristotelean]] sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb| Huyler |1995|loc=chpt. 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When a worker has an injury, all US states have a structure of laws designed to provide multiple benefits to that injured worker.  These laws are referred to as [[Workers' compensation|workers’ compensation]] and the laws define the benefits, identify all of the parties, and dictate the manner and method for dispensing such [[Employee benefit|benefits]]. Since every employee, by definition, must work for some employer, when there is a dispute over the benefits or the injury itself, these two primary entities find themselves in conflict within the system.  These controversies are thereafter resolved through either negotiation or trial, and the practice of representing the employer side is referred to as '''workers’ compensation employer defense'''.

==Examples==
The system itself involves billions of dollars in payments per year and involves a broad spectrum of a sub-communities of different and often conflicting interests and individuals

For example, the major entities in most US state systems are:
:::* [[Judge]]s
:::* [[Lawyers]] (for both sides)
:::* [[Hearing Representatives or Hearing Officers]]
:::* Insurance company claims examiners
:::* Third party administrators for self insured employers and their examiners
:::* Injured workers (employees)
:::* [[Employers]]
:::* [[Physician|Doctors]] and various medical providers
:::* Bill collectors for the doctors and other providers
:::* [[Interpreters]]
:::* Court reporters
:::* [[Photocopy]] companies
:::* [[Private investigators]]
:::* Bill reviewers
:::* Professional reviewers of requests for medical treatment
:::* Expert witnesses

The attorneys who regularly perform this kind of work do so with such frequency that their practice becomes specialized, and states have endeavored to acknowledge and control this focus by [[certification]] or [[licensing]] of the practitioners as designated specialists within the field, after appropriate education, time and successful testing has been accomplished.
