      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2465">'''The 10 Under 10 Film Festival''' was created by independent [[Documentary film|documentary]] filmmaker and [[University of Texas at Austin]] Associate Professor, [[Ellen Spiro]].  The intention of the film festival is to encourage raw creativity among new filmmakers without relying on huge budgets.

Since 2002 the [[film festival]] has showcased short, high-quality, low-budget documentaries "founded on the notion that great ideas can happen on no budget and in little time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Issue/story?oid=oid:471805 Austin Chornicls]&lt;/ref&gt; As a film professor, Spiro says she’s watched too many students get caught in the romance of film school debt and challenges filmmakers to make films with "little money but lots of substance and inventiveness".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Issue/story?oid=oid:471805 The Austin Film Society Documentary Tour: 10 Under 10 and Its First Five Years]&lt;/ref&gt;

The name expresses the informal desire to show ten films, each less than ten minutes long, costing less than $10 to make.

The '''Amazon Theatre''' ({{Lang-pt|Teatro Amazonas}}) is an [[opera house]] located in [[Manaus]], in the heart of the [[Amazon rainforest]] in [[Brazil]]. It is the location of the annual ''[[Festival Amazonas de Ópera]]'' (Amazonas Opera Festival) and the home of the [[Amazonas Philharmonic|Amazonas Philharmonic Orchestra]] which regularly rehearses and performs at the Amazon Theater along with choirs, musical [[concert]]s and other performances.

==History==
The Amazonas Theatre was built during the [[Belle Époque]] at a time when fortunes were made in the [[rubber boom]]. Construction of the Amazon Theatre was first proposed in 1881 by a member of the local House of Representatives, Antonio Jose Fernandes Júnior, who envisioned a "jewel" in the heart of the Amazon rainforest.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/apr/14/manaus-amazon-theatre-brazil-history-cities-50-buildings The Guardian UK, Tuesday 14 April 2015 11.29 BST]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1882, the State legislature approved some limited financing, but this was considered insufficient. Later that year, the president of the Province, [[José Lustosa Paranaguá]], approved a larger budget and initiated a competition for the presentation of plans. The chosen project was made by the ''Gabinete Português de Engenharia e Arquitectura'', an engineering and architecture office from [[Lisbon]]. By 1884, construction was ready to begin under the Italian architect [[Celestial Sacardim]]. Work proceeded slowly over the following fifteen years with some stops and restarts from 1885 to 1892.

By 1895, when the masonry work and exterior were completed, the decoration of the interior and the installation of electric lighting could begin more rapidly. The theatre was inaugurated on December 31, 1896, with the first performance occurring on January 7, 1897, with the [[Italian opera]], ''[[La Gioconda (opera)|La Gioconda]]'', by [[Amilcare Ponchielli]].

==Architecture and style==
The theatre's architectural style is considered typically [[Renaissance Revival architecture|Renaissance Revival]]. The roofing tiles were imported from [[Alsace]], the steel walls from [[Glasgow]], [[Scotland]] and the [[Carrara marble]] for the stairs, statues and columns, from [[Italy]]. The [[dome]] is covered with 36,000 decorated [[ceramic tile]]s painted in the colors of the national flag of Brazil. The interior furnishing came from [[France]] in the [[Louis Quinze|Louis Quinze style]]. Italian artist Domenico de Angelis the Younger painted the panels that decorate the ceilings of the auditorium and of the audience chamber. The curtain, with its painting "Meeting of the Waters", was originally created in Paris by [[Crispim do Amaral]]. The theatre's 198 [[chandelier]]s were imported from Italy, including 32 of [[Murano glass]].

*The theatre is featured in the film ''[[Fitzcarraldo]]''&lt;ref&gt;Herzog, Werner (2001). Herzog on Herzog. Faber and Faber. {{ISBN|0-571-20708-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; directed by the German director [[Werner Herzog]] in 1982.  At the beginning of the film, the opera-obsessed character Brian Sweeney "Fitzcarraldo" Fitzgerald makes his way by paddling his own boat to the opera house to hear [[Enrico Caruso]] sing in [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]]'s ''[[Ernani]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://lanfiles-vm.williams.edu/mbrown/Brown_ArtOfDarkness_1982.pdf Art of Darkness, The Progressive, August 1982]&lt;/ref&gt; which also features aging [[Sarah Bernhardt]] whose role is sung by an off-stage soprano. (Sarah seems to think she is in [[Lucia di Lammermoor]], with its mad scene). Fitzcarraldo arrives right at the end of the opera, and there are scenes of the interior of the opera house. While it is believed that the opera house was constructed to attract Caruso to perform at its opening, there is some doubt that he actually did perform there.
*It is featured twice in novels by [[Eva Ibbotson]]: ''[[Journey to the River Sea]]''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/oct/09/guardianchildrensfictionprize2001.awardsandprizes18 "And the winner is ... : ... a book that lasts.

Both are adventure stories set principally in the city of [[Manaus]] (where the theatre is situated) and surroundings in 1912. In the former (children's) book a visiting acting group performs the play, [[Little Lord Fauntleroy]] at the theatre, which is briefly described.  In the latter (young adult) novel a visiting ballet troupe performs [[Swan Lake]], [[Giselle]], [[The Nutcracker]] and [[La Fille Mal Gardee]] at the theatre.
*The theatre was featured in [[Ann Patchett]]'s 2011 novel, "State of Wonder".

The '''Augustalia''', also known as the '''''Ludi Augustales''''' ("Augustan Games"), was a [[Roman festival|festival]] celebrated October 12 in honor of [[Augustus]], the first [[Roman emperor]]. It was established in conjunction with an altar to [[Fortuna Redux]] to mark the return of Augustus from Asia Minor to Rome in 19 BC.{{sfnp|Scheid|2009|page=288}} The [[College of Pontiffs|pontiffs]] and [[Vestals]] conducted [[sacrifice in ancient Roman religion|sacrifices]], and the date became a holiday ''([[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#feria|feriae]])'' on the official religious calendar of Rome.

The altar to Fortuna Redux was [[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#inauguratio|inaugurated]] on October 12, 19 BC, but dedicated on December 15.{{sfnp|Scheid|2009|pages=288–289}} Until Augustus died in 14 AD, Fortuna Redux was the recipient of the day's religious honors, and the name ''Augustalia'' does not appear in sources before that time. During his lifetime, Augustus was honored with ''ludi Augustales'', games ''([[ludi]])'' presented on the initiative of individual [[Executive magistrates of the Roman Empire|magistrates]].{{sfnp|Scheid|2009|page=289}} Strictly speaking, the Augustalia was the anniversary sacrifice, though ''Augustalia'' can also refer to commemorations of Augustus on his birthday, September 23.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Michael Swan, ''The Augustan Succession: An Historical Commentary on Cassius Dio's Roman History Books 55–56 (9 B.C.–A.D. 14)'' (Oxford University Press, 2004), pp. 297–298, 36.&lt;!--more here--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 

Augustus lists the establishment of the festival in his posthumously published first-person account of his achievements ''([[Res Gestae Divi Augusti|Res Gestae]])'',&lt;ref&gt;''Res Gestae'' 11.&lt;/ref&gt; emphasizing that it takes its name from his ''[[cognomen]]''. Roman festivals were often named for the [[list of Roman deities|deities]] they honored ([[Neptunalia]] for [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]], [[Cerealia]] for [[Ceres (mythology)|Ceres]]), and the unstated implication was that Augustus was to be accorded divine status.{{sfnp|Scheid|2009|pages=288–289}} The establishment of the Augustalia thus marks a major development in what was to become [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|Imperial cult]].

The Augustalia, abbreviated as ''AVG'', appears on calendars in large, capital letters like some of the oldest festivals for deities of Rome's archaic religion. It occurs between the [[Meditrinalia]] (October 11) and the [[Fontinalia]] (October 13), both of great antiquity.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Thonemann, "The Tragic King: Demetrios Poliorketes and the City of Athens," in ''Imaginary Kings: Royal Images in the Ancient Near East, Greece and Rome'' (Franz Steiner, 2005), p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19699">The '''Baltimore Plot''' was an alleged conspiracy in late February 1861 to assassinate [[President-elect]] [[Abraham Lincoln]] ''en route'' to his [[First inauguration of Abraham Lincoln|inauguration]]. [[Allan Pinkerton]], founder of the [[Pinkerton National Detective Agency]], played a key role by managing Lincoln's security throughout the journey. Though scholars debate whether or not the threat was real, clearly Lincoln and his advisors believed that there was a threat and took actions to ensure his safe passage through [[Baltimore, Maryland]].

On November 6, 1860, Lincoln was elected as the 16th [[President of the United States]], a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], and the first to be elected from that [[political party|party]]. Shortly after his election, many representatives of southern states made it clear that the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]]'s [[secession]] from the U.S. was inevitable, which greatly increased tension across the nation. A plot to assassinate Lincoln in Baltimore was alleged, and he ultimately arrived secretly in Washington, D.C. on February 23, 1861.   A planned train route through [[Bellaire, Ohio|Bellaire Ohio]], to [[Wheeling, West Virginia|Wheeling Virginia]] ([[West Virginia]] wasn't a state yet) and eastward, was subsequently rerouted up through the Pittsburgh vicinity, through Pennsylvania, into  Maryland and eventually to Washington.

For the remainder of his presidency, Lincoln's many critics would hound him for the seemingly cowardly act of sneaking through Baltimore at night, in disguise, sacrificing his honor for his personal safety. However, the efforts at security may well have been prudent.

==Background==
{{More citations needed|date=November 2010}}
[[Allan Pinkerton]] was commissioned by the railroad to provide security for the president-elect on his journey to Washington, D.C. Maryland was a [[slave state]] with strong Southern sympathies and therefore potentially dangerous for the Republican president elect to pass through. Two months following his journey, Baltimore citizens [[Baltimore riot of 1861|attacked a Union Army regiment from Massachusetts]] as it marched through the city on its way to Washington. When Virginia seceded and joined the Confederacy, it became necessary for Lincoln to cross Maryland to reach Washington.

The incoming Republican government was not about to take risks, and later that year Lincoln would suspend many civil liberties, even ordering the arrest of Maryland's state legislature for fear it might vote for secession. Pinkerton, in particular, was overly cautious, which he would demonstrate during the coming war, when he repeatedly overestimated Confederate strength and negatively influenced Union Army policy.

==Lincoln's actions==
[[File:Pinkerton allan late harpers.jpg|thumb|left|Portrait of [[Allan Pinkerton]] from ''Harper's Weekly'', 1884]]
On February 11, 1861, President-elect Lincoln boarded an east-bound train in [[Springfield, Illinois]] at the start of a [[Whistle stop train tour|whistle stop tour]] of 70 towns and cities ending with his [[inauguration]] in Washington, D.C. [[Allan Pinkerton]] had been hired by railroad officials to investigate suspicious activities and acts of destruction of railroad property along Lincoln's route through Baltimore. Pinkerton became convinced that a plot existed to ambush Lincoln's carriage between the Calvert Street Station of the [[Northern Central Railway]] and the Camden Street Station of the [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]]. This opportunity would present itself during the President-elect's passage through Baltimore on February 23, 1861. Pinkerton tried to persuade Lincoln to cancel his stop at [[Harrisburg]], [[Pennsylvania]], and proceed secretly straight through Baltimore, but Lincoln insisted upon keeping to his schedule.

Pinkerton famously clashed with Lincoln's friend and escort, [[Ward Hill Lamon]], over the President-elect's protection. Lamon offered Lincoln "a Revolver and a Bowie Knife" but Pinkerton protested that he "would not for the world have it said that Mr. Lincoln had to enter the National Capitol armed."&lt;ref&gt;Cuthbert, N: ''Lincoln and the Baltimore Plot, 1861,'' page 79. Huntington Library, 1949.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the evening of February 22, telegraph lines to Baltimore were cut at Pinkerton's behest to prevent communications from passing between potential conspirators in Pennsylvania and Maryland. Meanwhile, Lincoln left Harrisburg on a special train and arrived secretly in Baltimore in the middle of the night. The most dangerous link in the journey was in Baltimore, where a city ordinance prohibited night-time rail travel through the downtown area. Therefore, the railcars had to be horsedrawn between the President Street and Camden Street stations.
[[File:1861 feby 23 nast.jpg|thumb|The crowd waiting for Lincoln was disappointed.]]
According to Pinkerton, a captain of the roads reported that there was a plot to stab the President-elect. The alleged plan was to have several assassins, armed with knives, interspersed throughout the crowd that would gather to greet Lincoln at the President Street station. When Lincoln emerged from the car, which he had to do to change trains, at least one of the assassins would be able to get close enough to kill him.

Once Lincoln's rail carriage had safely passed through Baltimore, Pinkerton sent a one-line telegram to the president of the Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore Railroad: "Plums delivered nuts safely."

On the afternoon of February 23, Lincoln's scheduled train arrived at Calvert Street Station &lt;ref&gt;Road to Lincoln's end ran through Baltimore, Jonathan M. Pitts, The Baltimore Sun&lt;/ref&gt; in Baltimore. The large crowd that gathered at the station to see the president-elect quickly learned that Lincoln had already passed by. Even though the rest of the Lincoln party, including [[Mary Todd Lincoln|Mrs. Lincoln]] and the children, had been on this train as originally scheduled, they had already alighted from the train in an unscheduled stop several blocks north of the President Street station.&lt;ref&gt;Scharf, John, History of Maryland vol.III, Tradition Press, p.39&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

Many historians believe that Pinkerton's perception of an assassination plot was incorrect, and Lincoln came to regret that he had slipped through the city unannounced.&lt;!-- Is the statement about Lincoln's regret a separate 'sentence', or is it merely part of what many historians believe? --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://teachingamericanhistorymd.net/000001/000000/000015/html/t15.html |title=Baltimore, Allan Pinkerton, and the Plot to Assassinate President Lincoln, 1861 |publisher=Teachingamericanhistorymd.net |date= |accessdate=2011-05-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724094108/http://teachingamericanhistorymd.net/000001/000000/000015/html/t15.html |archive-date=2011-07-24 |dead-url=yes |df= }} {{Failed verification|date=November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=November 2014}}
Many years after the fact, Ward Hill Lamon would publicly argue that there had been no plot to assassinate the president in 1861. "It is perfectly manifest that there was no conspiracy—no conspiracy of a hundred, of fifty, of twenty, of three; no definite purpose in the heart of even one man to murder Mr. Lincoln in Baltimore."&lt;ref&gt;Lamon, W: ''Life of Abraham Lincoln'', p. 513. James R. Osgood and Company, 1872.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1891 book ''Recollections of President Lincoln and his Administration'', author L.E. Chittenden argues that there was no need for any precautions, such as a disguise, because Lincoln "entered the sleeping–car at Philadelphia, and slept until awakened within a few miles of Washington."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Recollections of President Lincoln and his Administration|last=Chittenden|first=L.E.|publisher=BiblioBazaar|year=2009|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; That account contradicts other firsthand accounts, which state that Lincoln spent a sleepless and anxious night with Lamon and Pinkerton, during which he "spoke in a quiet voice to avoid being noticed."&lt;ref&gt;Harris, William C., Lincoln's Rise to the Presidency. (Lawrence:University of Kansas Press, 2007), 318.&lt;/ref&gt;

Whether or not the president-elect was ever in any real danger of being assassinated, Lincoln's efforts to reach Washington, D.C., safely instantly became a humiliating ''[[cause célèbre]]'' across the nation, much to his chagrin.

Several elements of the initial ''[[New York Times]]'' article of February 23, 1861 were especially damning. Primarily, the fact that such a negative report came from an ardently Republican newspaper gave it instant credibility,&lt;ref&gt;Harper p. 90&lt;/ref&gt; much more than it would have enjoyed if it had come from a [[Copperheads (politics)|Copperhead]] or Southern source. When ''The New York Times'' published [[Joseph Howard, Jr.]]'s account of the President-elect disguised in a scotch-cap and long cloak, the nation "rocked with laughter, bringing abuse and ridicule down on Lincoln."&lt;ref&gt;Holzer, Harold, ''Lincoln Seen &amp; Heard''. (University Press of Kansas, 2000.) (p. 118)&lt;/ref&gt;

Substantively, the Howard article was a direct assault on Lincoln's manliness. The article states that Lincoln was reluctant and too scared and to go but compelled to go by Colonel Sumner's indignation and by the insistence and shame of his wife and several others.&lt;ref&gt;Harper p. 89&lt;/ref&gt;

The newspapers lampooned Lincoln for slipping through Baltimore in the dead of night. [[Adalbert J. Volck]], a Baltimore dentist and caricaturist, was inspired to pen his famous satirical etching "Passage through Baltimore". Volck's image of a startled Lincoln in his nightshirt peering out of the side of his rail car as it passes through Baltimore has become part of the Lincoln iconography. "In the nineteenth century, when pictures were less common and more prized, the scotch-cap symbol remained a prop in Confederate graphics, and some Northern-made prints as well, for years—the reminder of Lincoln fleeing in disguise an automatic accusation of his supposed lack of character."&lt;ref&gt;Holzer, p. 118&lt;/ref&gt;

For the rest of his presidency, the story of his sneaking like a coward through Baltimore would be told and retold by his enemies, with particular effect by cartoonists of the day. He was drawn with many variations of Scottish headwear, which eventually morphed into a Scottish [[Balmoral bonnet|balmoral]] cap and very short [[kilt]]. The absurd disguise was often accompanied by a terrified expression on the President-elect's face, to further undermine the public's image of his courage and manliness. Images such as [http://www.sonofthesouth.net/leefoundation/civil-war/1861/march/plot-kill-lincoln-1861.htm a comic strip] in ''[[Harper's Weekly]]'' plagued Lincoln throughout his presidency.

Newspapers of all parties mocked Lincoln's actions. In a ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine, historical)|Vanity Fair]]'' cartoon, the kilt was traded for a dress the president had borrowed from his wife. By the time that Lincoln arrived in Washington, he was the laughing stock of the entire country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CZh2pgihScoC&amp;pg=PA46 |title=Lincoln's wrath: fierce mobs, brilliant scoundrels and a president's mission|publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2011-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[New-York Tribune|The New York Tribune]]'' was nonetheless forced to admit, "It is the only instance recorded in our history in which the recognized head of a nation ... as been compelled, for fear of his life, to enter the capital in disguise." More blunt was the denunciation by the ''[[The Baltimore Sun|Baltimore Sun]]'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;Had we any respect for Mr. Lincoln, official or personal, as a man, or as President-elect of the United States ... the final escapade by which he reached the capital would have utterly demolished it ... He might have entered Willard's Hotel with a "head spring" and a "summersault," and the clown's merry greeting to Gen. Scott, "Here we are!" and we should care nothing about it, personally. We do not believe the Presidency can ever be more degraded by any of his successors than it has by him, even before his inauguration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historynet.com/historical_figures/3704871.html?showAll=y&amp;c=y |title=Historical Figures &amp;#124; Abraham Lincoln Takes the Heat |publisher=TheHistoryNet |date= |accessdate=2011-05-28| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071004205937/http://www.historynet.com/historical_figures/3704871.html?showAll=y&amp;c=y| archivedate=October 4, 2007&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Hollywood recreations===
In 1951, [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] (MGM) released a fictional re-creation of the alleged plot against Lincoln, ''[[The Tall Target]]''. Its story generally follows what is known about the Baltimore Plot, with some differences. It is a [[New York Police Department]] detective named John Kennedy, played by [[Dick Powell]], who contacts the administration about the conspiracy and boards the train hoping to discover whether any of the plotters are on board before they reach Baltimore.

Kennedy discovers a plot that involves a riot to distract police protection away from Lincoln and a sharpshooter armed with a rifle with a telescopic sight to shoot the president-elect. Through Kennedy's efforts, the attempt is aborted and key members of the conspiracy are identified.

There actually was an NYPD officer, [[John Alexander Kennedy]], who claimed to have been the one who uncovered the Baltimore Plot; but, unlike Powell's movie character, he was not actually on scene. Moreover, in real life, Kennedy was the [[New York City Police Commissioner|superintendent]] of the entire force. In the film, he is depicted as a mere [[detective sergeant]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

"The Death Trap," an episode of the 1966–1967 television series ''[[The Time Tunnel]]'', includes the 1861 Baltimore plot, but it also depicts a brief difficulty with the time machine that caused the showing of an enactment of the April 14, 1865 shooting of Lincoln at [[Ford's Theatre]] in Washington.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://whatisusa.info/usa-presidents/abraham-lincoln/|title=About President Abraham Lincoln|publisher=What is USA News|date=26 February 2014|accessdate=2012-09-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130729234926/http://www.whatisusa.info/usa-presidents/abraham-lincoln/|archive-date=2013-07-29|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The episode depicts a bomb being used in the 1861 Baltimore plot and has the attempt being plotted by [[Abolitionism|Abolitionists]], who hope to plunge the nation into a war in which slavery will be ended; the plotters are apparent sympathizers with [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]], who had already been hanged. In reality, the [[American Civil War]] actually began in April 1861, with the attack on [[Fort Sumter]].

The '''Battle of Silva Arsia''' was a battle in 509 BC between the republican forces of [[ancient Rome]] and Etruscan forces of [[Tarquinii]] and [[Veii]] led by the deposed Roman king [[Lucius Tarquinius Superbus]].  The battle took place near the ''[[Silva Arsia]]'' (the Arsian forest) in Roman territory, and resulted in victory to Rome but the death of one of her consuls, [[Lucius Junius Brutus]].

The battle was one of a number of attempts by Tarquin to regain the throne, and can also be seen as part of the [[Roman-Etruscan Wars|ongoing conflict]] between the Etruscan cities and the expanding Roman state.  The battle forms part of Rome's early history, which is probably in part legendary.

==Background==
In 509 BC [[Overthrow of the Roman monarchy|the Roman monarchy was overthrown]], and the [[Roman Republic]] was established with the election of the first [[Roman consul|consuls]].  The deposed king, [[Lucius Tarquinius Superbus]], whose family originated from [[Tarquinii]] in [[Etruria]], garnered the support of the Etruscan cities of Veii and Tarquinii, recalling to the former their regular losses of war and of land to the Roman state, and to the latter his family ties.

==Battle==
The armies of the two cities followed Tarquin to battle, and the Roman consuls led the Roman army to meet them, with [[Publius Valerius Publicola|Publius Valerius]] commanding the Roman infantry and [[Lucius Junius Brutus]] the [[equites]].  Similarly, the king commanded the Etruscan infantry, and his son [[Aruns (son of Tarquinius Superbus)|Aruns]] had command of the cavalry.  

The cavalry first joined battle and Aruns, having spied from afar the [[lictors]], and thereby recognising the presence of a consul, soon saw that Brutus was in command of the cavalry.  The two men, who were cousins, charged each other, and speared each other to death.  The infantry also soon joined the battle, the result being in doubt for some time.  The right wing of each army was victorious, the army of Tarquinii forcing back the Romans, and the Veientes being routed.  However the Etruscan forces eventually fled the field, the Romans claiming the victory.&lt;ref&gt;[[Livy]], ''[[Ab urbe condita (book)|Ab urbe condita]]'', 2.6-7&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
On the night after the battle, [[Livy]] reports that a voice believed to be the spirit of [[Silvanus (mythology)|Silvanus]] was heard to come from the nearby forest, saying "more of the Etrurians by one had fallen in the battle; that the Roman was victorious in the war".&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;[[Livy]], ''[[Ab urbe condita (book)|Ab urbe condita]]'', 2.7&lt;/ref&gt;

The consul Valerius collected the spoils of the routed Etruscans.  He returned to Rome to celebrate a triumph which, according to the [[Fasti Triumphales]], took place on 1 March 509 BC.  The funeral of Brutus was carried out by Valerius with great magnificence.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Fasti Triumphales]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Livy]] writes that later in 509 BC Valerius returned to fight the Veientes.  It is unclear whether this was continuing from the Battle of Silva Arsia, or was some fresh dispute.  It is also unclear what happened in this dispute.&lt;ref&gt;[[Livy]], [[Ab urbe condita (book)|Ab urbe condita]] 2.8&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Beyond Media''' was an architecture film festival held in [[Florence]] from 1997 to 2009. The festival aimed at observing the use of audiovisual tools for architecture and more generally at discussing relationships between [[architecture]] and the [[New media|media]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.beyondmedia.it/index.php?pg=17 |title=Festival |website=Beyond Media official website |accessdate=1 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Beyond Media was organized by Image, a group of architects, historians and researchers based in [[Florence]] and active in the field of [[communication]] in architecture.
In the course of its nine editions, the festival became one of the main events worldwide devoted to architecture videos.&lt;ref name="gadanho"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://volumeproject.org/2009/07/beyond-the-digital-turn |title=Beyond the digital turn |last1=Gadanho |first1=Pedro |date=21 July 2009 |accessdate=1 October 2014 |website=Volume |quote=When Beyond Media was initiated by multitasking Marco Brizzi in 1997, it was only too obvious to a given few that digital tools were there to change the way we worked, the way we designed reality, the way we represented it and also thought about it.

==History==
The festival began in the context of the deep changes occurred in the mediasphere during the 1990s. With the large diffusion of new media and [[computer]] driven design tools, videos quickly became an accessible and powerful instrument for [[architects]]. They were used by [[designers]] not only as a more lively form of [[Representation (arts)|representation]] but also as a [[storytelling]] device for projects. In other words, they made it possible for architects to express their projects in a [[narrative]] form and created a brand new and autonomous form of expression for architecture.  This is the context in which Beyond Media was born and had its mission, that was to provide an account of all shifts produced by the introduction of new media in architectural design and to promote a venue for discussion about this topic. As Pedro Gadanho, today curator for Contemporary Architecture at the [[Museum of Modern Art, New York|Museum of Modern Art]] in New York, wrote:&lt;ref name="gadanho" /&gt; “When I say that this Festival is “haunted by its very initial premises” I do not mean that showing the audiovisual media which are today  quintessential to architecture representation should bear any special problem. On the contrary, it is only natural and logical that someone should be doing it. At its 9th edition, the [[Florence]] festival also has in its curriculum to be one of the firsts to do so”.
Since its very first edition in 1997, the core of the event was the screening of architecture videos. Besides presenting the early videos produced by famous architects like [[Zaha Hadid Architects]], [[UNStudio]], [[MDRDV]], [[Rem Koolhaas]] the festival also paid attention to emerging firms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mimoa.eu/blog/?p=815 |title=Beyond Media |website=MIMOA |accessdate=1 October 2014 |quote=In the tradition of the festival, a program of 80 architecture videos (selected from over 600 international submissions) will be presented and on public view in order to construct an understanding of the issues that represent the world’s architectural thought and production, that interpret the potential of the audio-visual medium and qualify the architectural discourse. Special recognition will be given to three noted practitioners of contemporary architecture, “THE VIEW MASTERS”, who in different ways demonstrated peculiar and fertile employment of video: UNStudio, Zaha Hadid Architects, and MVRDV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond Media was interested in promoting the debate around the emerging phenomena occurring in the architecture world. The festival adopted an holistic approach bringing on stage experts in many disciplines such as [[Derrick De Kerckhove]], [[Beatriz Colomina]], [[Peter Wilson (architect)|Peter Wilson]], [[Tony Fretton]], John Frazer and many scholars, journalists and writers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arqchile.cl/beyond_media_2009_visions.htm |title=Beyond Media 2009 Visions |website=arqchile.cl |accessdate=1 October 2014 |quote=The symposium on the theme VISIONS, curated by Pietro Valle, brought on the stage such personalities as Peter Wilson from BOLLES+WILSON, Pier Vittorio Aureli from the Berlage Institute in Rotterdam, John Frazer from Queensland University of Technology, Lars Krueckeberg from GRAFT, Tony Fretton, Derrick De Kerckhove, Beatriz Colomina, Marcos Novak and many more protagonists from the world of architecture, journalism, communication and arts}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The festival also included a series of exhibitions. Starting from "Beyond Media 2003: Intimacy" the exhibition “Spot on schools” curated by Paola Giaconia put on display the most advanced researches produced by worldwide architecture teaching departments. Among the schools selected for the 2009 edition of the “Spot on Schools” exhibition were: Asia University, [[Ball State University]], [[Clemson University]], [[California Polytechnic State University]], [[Southern California Institute of Technology]], [[Rhode Island School of Design]], [[Southern Illinois University]], [[University of Calgary]], [[University of Florida]], [[University of Hong Kong]], Asia University, [[RMIT Architecture]], [[Universidade Tecnica de Lisboa]], [[Nuova Accademia di Belle Arti|NABA]], [[Politecnico di Torino]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.designrepublic.it/viewdoc.asp?co_id=3682 |title=Spot on Schools |accessdate=1 October 2014 |website=Design Republic |language=Italian |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141015073610/http://www.designrepublic.it/viewdoc.asp?co_id=3682 |archivedate=15 October 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other exhibitions were “Urban Visions” (curated by Michele Bonino) in 2009, “The Storytellers” (curated by Marco Brizzi) in 2005, “About cities” (curated by Elisa Strano) in 2003, “Architecture, media, industrial design for Prada. Prada, OMA/AMO” (curated by Clemens Weisshaar and Reed Kram) in 2002.

Beyond Media also hosted workshops and other activities aimed at promoting an experience of architecture for a non-professional or younger audience. In 2009 Beyond Media brought to Italy ¿Que es arquitectura?, a workshop created by Jorge Raedó and Eva Serrat to let the children investigate visual perception and vision.

Beyond Media was supported by many academic and public institutions. Among them: the [[Ministry of Cultural Heritage and Activities (Italy)|Italian Ministry of Culture]], through PARC (today PaBAAC), the [[Tuscany|Region of Tuscany]], the [[Florence|Municipality of Florence]], the [[University of Florence]].

Starting in 2002 Beyond Media took place in two main venues in Florence, the [[Ospedale degli Innocenti]] and [[Stazione Leopolda]].

The videos selected for the various editions of Beyond Media are part of the media archive curated by Image in Florence, Italy. The archive counts today more than 3500 architecture videos which are presented to the public during screenings hosted at museums and other cultural institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.designcontext.net/en/topics/intervista-a-marco-brizzi/ |title=Interview with Marco Brizzi |date=6 June 2013 |website=Design Context |accessdate=1 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2071">The '''Bôcher Memorial Prize''' was founded by the [[American Mathematical Society]] in 1923 in memory of [[Maxime Bôcher]] with an initial endowment of $1,450 (contributed by members of that society).  It is awarded every three years (formerly every five years) for a notable research memoir in [[mathematical analysis|analysis]] that has appeared during the past six years in a recognized North American journal or was authored by a member of the Society. This provision, introduced in 1971 and modified in 1993, is a liberalization of the terms of the award.  The current award is $5,000.

The 1921 '''Cairo Conference''', described in the official minutes as '''Middle East Conference held in Cairo and Jerusalem, March 12 to 30, 1921''', was a series of meetings by British officials for examining and discussing Middle Eastern problems, and to frame a common policy.&lt;ref name=report_mec_vi&gt;''Report on Middle East Conference held in Cairo and Jerusalem, March 12th to 30th, 1921'', Part VI, p. 12. British Colonial Office, juni 1921 (CO935/1/1)&lt;/ref&gt; Particular concerns of the conference related to resolving the conflicting policies defined in the [[McMahon–Hussein Correspondence|McMahon letters]] (1915), the [[Sykes–Picot Agreement|Sykes-Picot agreement]] (1916) and the [[Balfour Declaration]] (1917). [[Winston Churchill]], the newly appointed [[Secretary of State for the Colonies|Colonial Secretary]], called all the British Military Leaders and civil administrators in the Middle East to a conference at the Semiramis hotel in [[Cairo]] to discuss these issues. It was an experimental conference organized by the [[Colonial Office]], with the purpose to solve problems more efficiently, with improved communications, without protracted correspondence.&lt;ref name=report_mec_vi/&gt;

At the conference, it was agreed that Lebanon and Syria should remain under French control and that Britain should maintain the mandate over Palestine and continue to support the establishment of a Jewish Homeland there. As the result of meetings with [[Abdullah I of Jordan|Abdullah bin Hussein]], it was agreed that he would administer the territory east of the Jordan River, Transjordan. It was decided that [[Faisal I of Iraq|Faisal]] should become king of a newly created Kingdom of Iraq. [[Hussein bin Ali, Sharif of Mecca|Husain]], the Sharif of Mecca, was to be recognized as King of the Hejaz and [[Abdul Aziz ibn Saud]] left in control of the [[Nejd]] in the heart of the Arabian Desert. Both were to continue to receive financial support from Great Britain.

==Prelude==
During 1920 a popular uprising had broken out in British [[Mandatory Iraq]], a new creation. The British army had suffered hundreds of casualties and sections of the British press were calling for the ending of the Mandate. [[T.E. Lawrence]], whose wartime activities were beginning to capture the public imagination and who had strong attachments to the [[Hussein bin Ali, Sharif of Mecca|Husain]] dynasty based in the [[Hejaz]], was lobbying the British Government on behalf of Emir [[Faisal I of Iraq|Feisal]]. The Emir's attempt to establish a kingdom with [[Damascus]] as its capital had been thwarted by the French army. In November 1920 Feisal's older brother [[Abdullah I of Jordan|Abdullah]] appeared with several hundred followers in the town of [[Ma'an]] and announced his intention of attacking the [[French Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon]] and restoring his brother to power there.

Churchill's task as the new Colonial Secretary with special responsibility for the Middle East, was to find a solution to the unrest in Iraq and satisfy the aspirations of the Husains. He appointed Lawrence as his special advisor. They held a series of meetings with Feisal in London prior to the conference.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Garnett|Garnett, David]] (1938) ''Letters of T. E. Lawrence'' 1942 edition. pp. 124,125. Summary by Garnett: "Evacuate Mesopotamia".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[George Antonius|Antonius, George]] (1938) ''The Arab Awakening. The Story of The Arab National Movement'' Hamish Hamilton 1945 edition. p.316.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the decisions about the future of Iraq had been already taken in London; Feisal should become king of a new Kingdom of Iraq, to be approved by a plebiscite of the local population. Once installed, the King would sign a friendship treaty or Alliance with Great Britain. In a major policy change, with Lawrence arguing strongly in favour, it was decided that security in the area should be transferred from the army to the [[Royal Air Force]]. By the time the conference started the British army had managed to crush the revolt in Mesopotamia, at a cost of £40–50 million, with over 400 British soldiers and over 10,000 Iraqis killed. It was anticipated that the new policy would make significant financial savings.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Asher (explorer)|Asher, Michael]] (1998) ''Lawrence. The uncrowned King of Arabia.'' Penguin edition 1999. {{ISBN|9780879517120}}. p.356.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conference==

On 12 March 1921, the conference was convened at the Semiramis Hotel in Cairo and was attended by all the senior military and civil figures from Palestine and Mesopotamia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = David Fromkin | title = A Peace to End all Peace | place = New York | publisher = Henry Holt | year = 1989 |  pages = 502–503}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two Arabs present were members of the Mesopotamian Mandate administration. Churchill described the gathering, which lasted two weeks, as one of "Forty Thieves" and spent his leisure time practising his new hobby of oil painting and working on the manuscript of his history of the [[First World War]], ''The World Crisis''.&lt;ref&gt;Lacey, Robert (1981) ''The Kingdom'', Fontana edition, 1982, {{ISBN|0-00-636509-4}}. p.160&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Christopher Sykes (author)|Sykes, Christopher]] (1965) ''Cross Roads to Israel: Palestine from Balfour to Bevin.'' New English Library Edition August 1967. p.66.&lt;/ref&gt;
	
The agenda consisted of three sections: Iraq, Palestine (including Transjordan), [[Aden]] and the [[Persian Gulf]].&lt;ref&gt;Sykes, p.54&lt;/ref&gt; The Judiciary, Finance, the size of the British Army garrison and the proposed Legislative Council were all on the agenda.&lt;ref&gt;Sykes, p.55.&lt;/ref&gt; An Arab delegation from Palestine met Churchill in Cairo briefly on 22 March, at which he refused to discuss anything political but agreed to meet them in Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=sY27UmuT6-4C ''A Broken Trust: Sir Herbert Samuel, Zionism and the Palestinians''], p.125. Huneidi, Sahar (2001), I.B.Tauris. {{ISBN|1-86064-172-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The issue of Trans-Jordania was complicated by the arrival of Abdullah's army in Amman, with an influx of rebels and refugees from Syria and the fact that the Zionists regarded Transjordan as part of the promised Jewish Homeland. Churchill held a series of meetings with Abdullah in Jerusalem on his way back to London.

The only public announcement on the decisions made during the conference, was a report made by Winston Churchill to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] on 14 June 1921. It drew little comment from the press and the conference is barely mentioned in the published letters and autobiographies of the main participants.&lt;ref&gt;Sykes. pp.66, 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jerusalem meetings==
On 24 March 1921, the Palestine Mission continued its work in Jerusalem. In Gaza, Churchill's train was met by a large demonstration against the British Mandate of Palestine. He met the mayor of Gaza and other leaders and was presented with a list of demands which had been put forward by the [[Muslim-Christian Associations]] in Haifa. [[Winston Churchill]] and Herbert Samuel, supposing they were welcomed by the inhabitants, waved to the protesting crowds, who were chanting anti-Jewish slogans.&lt;ref&gt;Sykes, pp.55,56. Reports Churchill and Samuel waving to the crowds unaware that they were chanting anti-Jewish slogans. pp.58,59.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Meeting with Emir Abdullah ===

On 28 March, [[Secretary of State for the Colonies]] Winston Churchill had several meetings with [[Abdullah I of Jordan|Emir Abdullah]]. Abdullah had already established himself in Amman and was threatening to proceed further northwards. Churchill proposed to constitute Transjordan as an Arab province under an Arab Governor, who would recognise British control over his Administration and be responsible to the [[High Commissioners for Palestine and Transjordan]].  Abdullah argued that he should be given control of the entire area of Mandate Palestine responsible to the High Commissioner. Alternatively he advocated a union with the territory promised to his brother (Iraq). Churchill rejected both demands.

Responding to Abdullah's fear for a Jewish kingdom west of the Jordan, Churchill decreed it was not only not contemplated "that hundreds and thousands of Jews were going to pour into the country in a very short time and dominate the existing population", but even was quite impossible. "Jewish immigration would be a very slow process and the rights of the existing non-Jewish population would be strictly preserved." "Trans-Jordania would not be included in the present administrative system of Palestine, and therefore the Zionist clauses of the mandate would not apply.  Hebrew would not be made an official language in Trans-Jordania, and the local Government would not be expected to adopt any measures to promote Jewish immigration and colonisation." About British policy in Palestine, Herbert Samuel added that "There was no question of setting up a Jewish Government there ... No land would be taken from any Arab, nor would the Moslem religion be touched in any way."&lt;ref name=report_mec_appendix_19&gt;''Report on Middle East Conference held in Cairo and Jerusalem, March 12th to 30th, 1921'', Appendix 19, p. 109-111. British Colonial Office, June 1921 (CO 935/1/1)&lt;/ref&gt;

The British representatives suggested that if Abdullah were able to control the anti-French actions of the Syrian Nationalists it would reduce French opposition to his brother's candidature for Mesopotamia, and might even lead to the appointment of Abdullah himself as [[Emir of Syria]] in Damascus.  In the end, Abdullah agreed to halting his advance towards the French and to administer the territory east of the Jordan River for a six-month trial period during which he would be given a British subsidy of £5,000 per month.  The territory, which the British had been happy to include in Feisal's Damascus kingdom, was to remain part of Mandate Palestine.

=== Meeting with the Arab delegation ===

After the conversations with the Emir, Churchill met a delegation of the [[Palestine Arab Congress#Third congress: Haifa, 1920|1920 Haifa Congress]], representing Palestinian Moslems and Christians, and led by [[Musa al-Husayni]]. They handed over a memorandum, which sounded a strong protest against British policies in Palestine.  They complained that Great Britain "under the financial stress of the war, had sold their country to Zionists".  They added that England, "disregarding the feelings of the inhabitants, has appointed a Jew as High Commissioner", despite "the fact that the predominating majority of the people he governs are not of his own race or faith".  "To the most important post of justice in Palestine, namely that of Legal Secretary, or Minister of Justice, a Jew has been appointed.  And what is worse, this official is an out and out Zionist."

The delegation contested the legal validity of the [[Balfour Declaration]], which had staked the historical claims of the Jews, according to the logic of which "the Arabs should claim Spain since once upon a time they conquered it and there developed a high civilisation."  They criticised charged customs and trade competition, and warned for Zionists dominating the market.  They protested against the buying up of lands, they criticized as costly; less than necessary projects to employ Jewish immigrants at double salaries, though doing less works, at a cost to public education. "...the highest posts with fat salaries are given to the Jews", the delegates complained, "while the native official, who is more conversant with local needs, is relegated to a third-class position, with a salary too little for his needs and out of all proportion with his work".

The delegation objected to the draft [[Mandatory Palestine|Mandate for Palestine]], which added nothing to Arab rights already derived from existing law, but gave the British her right of handing over to the Jews Crown lands which are not her own. "On the other hand, the Jews have been granted a true advantage, namely, that of becoming our rulers". They called for the rescinding of the Balfour Declaration and the establishment of an elected Parliament and a suspension of Jewish immigration.&lt;ref name=report_mec_appendix_23/&gt;

In reply to the statement, Churchill called the paper partisan and one-sided, with a great many untrue statements. As the Balfour Declaration was ratified by the Allied Powers, it was an established fact. The National Home for the Jews would be "good for the world, good for the Jews and good for the British Empire ... good for the Arabs who dwell in Palestine". He emphasized that Balfour spoke of "the establishment in Palestine of ''a'' National Home for the Jews", and did not say he would make Palestine ''the'' National Home for the Jews".  It "does not mean that it will cease to be the National Home of other people, or that a Jewish Government will be set up to dominate the Arab people."  The British Government "cherish a strong friendship and desire for co-operation with the Arab race as a whole. That is what you would expect from the  British Empire, which is the greatest of all the Muslem States in the world ..." Churchill continued his speech by explaining the appointment of Samuel as High Commissioner.  He was appointed because of his training and experience.  Because he was a Jew, "in holding the balance even and securing fair tradement for all he could not be reproached for being hostile to his own people, and he was believed by them when he said that he was only doing what was just and fair;".  Samuel then spoke of the great advantages the Jewish immigration brought to Palestine as a whole.&lt;ref name=report_mec_appendix_23&gt;''Report on Middle East Conference held in Cairo and Jerusalem, March 12th to 30th, 1921'', Appendix 23, pp. 142-153. British Colonial Office, June 1921 (CO 935/1/1)&lt;/ref&gt; He refused to promise any changes to British policy.&lt;ref&gt;Huneidi. pp. 124-127. "The colonial secretary's visit was the chief event in Palestine in March 1921 and can be regarded as the real starting point of Arab opposition to the British administration."&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Meeting with the Jewish National Council ===

The [[Jewish National Council of Palestine]], representing the Palestinian Jews, presented a memorandum to Winston Churchill.  They expressed their gratitude towards Britain for supporting "the rebuilding of the Jewish National Home" and trusted that the realisation of it would "be made possible by giving Palestine its historical frontiers".  They declared that "by our efforts to rebuild the Jewish National Home, which is but a small area in comparison with all the Arab lands, we do not deprive them of their legitimate rights".  They lauded the results of the Jewish colonisation in the past forty years.  They asked for charging the Jewish people with the development of State lands and non-private uncultivated lands, and the development of the natural resources of the country.&lt;ref name=report_mec_appendix_23-2&gt;''Report on Middle East Conference held in Cairo and Jerusalem, March 12th to 30th, 1921'', Appendix 23, pp. 153-157.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Imperial Cabinet was "perfectly convinced that the cause of Zionism is one which carries with it much that is good for the whole world, and not only for the Jewish people, but that it will also bring with it prosperity and contentment and advancement to the Arab population of this country".  He believed "that you were animated by the very highest spirit of justice and idealism, and that your work would in fact confer blessings upon the whole country".  Zionists should be forewarned to anticipate adverse criticism from the majority population.  The Colonial Secretary concluded that he had read the memorandum "with great interest and sympathy".&lt;ref name=report_mec_appendix_23-2/&gt;

=== Churchill's speech at the Hebrew University ===

On 29 March 1921, Churchill made a speech at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem.  He unveiled that his heart was full of sympathy for Zionism for twelve years ago, since he had met the Manchester Jews.  Once more reiterating the blessings of a Jewish National Home for the whole world, the Jewish race and Great Britain: the inhabitants of Palestine would greatly depend on its auditors, the Jews of Palestine. By taking the right steps Palestine would transform into a paradise as foretold in the scriptures, "a land flowing with milk and honey, in which sufferers of all races and religions will find a rest from their sufferings".&lt;ref name=report_mec_appendix_23-2/&gt;

== Aftermath ==

Lawrence concluded that Churchill had "made straight all the tangle" and that Britain had fulfilled "our promises in letter and spirit ... without sacrificing any interest of our Empire or any interest of the people concerned." One of Lawrence's biographers comments that the conference "heralded a period of unrest in the Middle East which had scarcely been surpassed even under Ottoman rule."&lt;ref&gt;Asher. p.357. Lawrence quote from ''Seven Pillars of Wisdom'' (1935) footnote p. 276.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Antonius. pp. 316–319.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3696">The '''Calgary Fringe Festival''' is an annual [[fringe theatre]] festival in [[Calgary]], [[Alberta]].

==History==

The earliest [[Fringe Theatre|Fringe]]-type drama festival in Calgary was the Plan B Festival, held in 2000 at a variety of locations in both Calgary's downtown and the neighbouring community of [[Inglewood, Calgary|Inglewood]]. The Plan B Festival arose after the 2000 Calgary Fringe Festival was cancelled due to administrative difficulties, and involved (and was organized by) many of the same artists that were originally planning on partaking in the aborted Fringe. Calgary Artist/Activist Patricia Anne Duquette, on behalf of Green Fools Physical Theatre Co., coordinated a massive community effort to rescue the festival with the additional aims of setting a precedent for future fundraising efforts. Approximately 5,000 people attended the adhoc presentations and events over the course of five days, establishing an overwhelming show of interest among Calgarians.
The first official Fringe festivals in Calgary took place in 2001 and 2002, organized primarily by the [[Loose Moose Theatre]] company, and based entirely in the inner-city neighbourhood of Inglewood. These were short, three-day festivals, held the weekend after the [[Edmonton International Fringe Festival]]. However, after the completion of the 2002 festival, Loose Moose lost their lease on the Garry Theatre, and were thus unable to produce the Fringe in subsequent years.

===Reestablishment===
A new license to produce a Fringe in Calgary was secured from the ''Canadian Association of Fringe Festivals''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fringefestivals.com Canadian Association of Fringe Festivals]&lt;/ref&gt; in 2005 by a new team headed by Blair Gallant and Jason Rothery, and a new Fringe was held in the summer of 2006. Many elements have changed from the earlier Fringes, including time, scope and locations. 
The Fringe is now a full-length 8-day Fringe: 2016 dates are Fri. July 29--Sat. Aug. 6, almost the same time as Saskatoon Fringe, and just before the Aug. 11 start of the Edmonton Fringe. &lt;ref&gt;http://fringefestivals.com/fringe-festivals/&lt;/ref&gt; In previous years when they overlapped, a number of shows were performed at both Fringes, either closing in Calgary early or opening in Edmonton late. 
In addition to the theatrical performances (greatly increased to 36 from the roughly dozen in the 01 and 02 Fringes), the 2006 Calgary Fringe included street performances and vendors (typical for a Fringe) as well as a film festival, visual arts displays and live music (less common). The 2006 Calgary Fringe was held at a number of venues; the festival elements, film, visual art and music were held on 17th Avenue in the [[Beltline, Calgary|Beltline]] district, with the theatrical performances split between the nearby [[Calgary Opera]] rehearsal hall and the more distant [[EPCOR Centre for the Performing Arts]], located in the downtown. The [[Sanctuary#Sanctuary as an altar|sanctuary]] and [[fellowship hall]] of the [[Lantern Church]] are two of the four main venues for Calgary Fringe Festival performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|journal=[[Calgary Sun]]|title=Focus on the Fringe|author=Louis Hobson|date=July 17, 2010|url=http://www.calgarysun.com/entertainment/columnists/louis_hobson/2010/07/18/14748466.html|accessdate=September 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Group Captain]] '''Sir Douglas Robert Steuart Bader''', {{postnominals|country=GBR|size=100%|sep=,|CBE|DSO1|DFC1|DL|FRAeS}} ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|ɑː|d|ər}}; 21 February 1910 – 5 September 1982) was a [[Royal Air Force]] [[flying ace]] during the [[Second World War]]. He was credited with 22 aerial victories, four shared victories, six probables, one shared probable and 11 enemy aircraft damaged.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 1998, p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Price and Holmes 2000, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bader joined the RAF in 1928, and was commissioned in 1930. In December 1931, while attempting some [[aerobatics]], he crashed and lost both his legs. Having been on the brink of death, he recovered, retook flight training, passed his check flights and then requested reactivation as a pilot. Although there were no regulations applicable to his situation, he was retired against his will on medical grounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=33936 |page=2940 |date=2 May 1933}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939, however, Douglas Bader returned to the RAF and was accepted as a pilot. He scored his first victories over [[Dunkirk]] during the [[Battle of France]] in 1940. He then took part in the [[Battle of Britain]] and became a friend and supporter of Air Vice Marshal [[Trafford Leigh-Mallory]] and his "[[Big Wing]]" experiments.

In August 1941, Bader {{Not a typo|baled}} out over [[German occupation of France during World War II|German-occupied France]] and was captured. Soon afterward, he met and was befriended by [[Adolf Galland]], a prominent German fighter ace.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson 1983, p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his disability, Bader made a number of escape attempts and was eventually sent to the [[prisoner of war]] camp at [[Colditz Castle]]. He remained there until April 1945 when the camp was liberated by the [[First United States Army]].

Bader left the RAF permanently in February 1946 and resumed his career in the oil industry. During the 1950s, a book and a film, ''[[Reach for the Sky]]'', chronicled his life and RAF career to the end of the Second World War. Bader campaigned for the disabled and in the Queen's Birthday Honours 1976 was appointed a [[Knight Bachelor]] "for services to disabled people".&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=46919 |date=4 June 1976 |page=8015 | supp=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; He continued to fly until ill health forced him to stop in 1979. Bader died, aged 72, on 5 September 1982, after a heart attack.

==Early years==
===Childhood and education===
Bader was born on 21 February 1910 in [[St John's Wood]], London, the second son of Frederick Roberts Bader, a civil engineer, and his wife Jessie Scott MacKenzie.&lt;ref&gt;Mackenzie 2008, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Turner 1995, p. 12"&gt;Turner 1995, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; His first two years were spent with McCann relatives in the [[Isle of Man]] while his father, accompanied by Bader's mother and older brother Frederick (named after his father but called ‘Derick’ to distinguish the two), returned to his work in India after the birth of his son. At the age of two, Bader joined his parents in India for a year; however, when his father resigned from his job in 1913 the family moved back to London&lt;ref name="Turner 1995 p. 1"&gt;Turner 1995, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; and settled in [[Kew]].&lt;ref&gt;Mackenzie 2008, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Bader's father saw action in the [[World War I|First World War]] in the [[Royal Engineers]], and was wounded in action in 1917. He remained in France after the war, where, having attained the rank of [[major]], he died in 1922 of complications from those wounds in a hospital in [[Saint-Omer]], the same area where Bader would bale out and be captured in 1941.&lt;ref&gt;Lucas 1981, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bader's mother remarried shortly thereafter to the Reverend Ernest William Hobbs. Bader was subsequently brought up in the rectory of the village of [[Sprotbrough and Cusworth|Sprotbrough]], near [[Doncaster]], [[West Riding of Yorkshire]],&lt;ref name="Turner 1995 p. 2"&gt;Turner 1995, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Bader's mild-mannered stepfather did not become the father figure he needed.&lt;ref name="Turner 1995 p. 12–13"&gt;Turner 1995, pp. 12–13&lt;/ref&gt; His mother showed little interest in Bader and sent him to his grandparents on occasion. Without guidance, Bader became unruly. During one incident, Bader's competitive nature saw him shoot his older brother with an [[air gun|air rifle]] at close range.&lt;ref name="Turner 1995 p. 12–13" /&gt; He was first sent as a boarder to [[Temple Grove School]],&lt;ref&gt;Spencer Tucker, ''Who's Who in Twentieth Century Warfare'' (2003), p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; one of the "Famous Five" of English prep schools, but one which gave its boys a Spartan upbringing.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Gronn, ''The Making of Educational Leaders'' (1999), pp. 49–50&lt;/ref&gt;

Bader's aggressive energy found a new lease of life at [[St Edward's School, Oxford|St Edward's School]], where he received his secondary education. During his time there, he thrived at sports. Bader played [[Rugby football|rugby]] and often enjoyed physical battles with bigger and older opponents. The then Warden (or Headmaster), Henry E. Kendall, tolerated Bader's aggressive and competitive nature. At one point, he made him a [[prefect]] despite what others saw as a strong streak of conceit in the boy.&lt;ref&gt;Mackenzie 2008, pp. 12–13.&lt;/ref&gt; Fellow RAF night fighter and bomber pilots [[Guy Gibson]] and [[Adrian Warburton]] also attended the school.&lt;ref&gt;Lucas 1981, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; In later life, Bader was deemed to be so good that he was invited to play a trial (or friendly game) with the [[Harlequin F.C.|Harlequins]], but it is not clear whether he actually played.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson 1983, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bader's sporting interests continued into his military service. He was selected for the [[Royal Air Force cricket team]], to play a [[first-class cricket|first-class match]] against the [[British Army cricket team|Army]] at [[The Oval (cricket ground)|the Oval]] in July 1931. He scored 65 and 1.&lt;ref&gt;Cricketarchive match f13551&lt;/ref&gt; In August, he played in a two-day game against the [[Royal Navy Cricket Club|Royal Navy]]. He played cricket in a German prisoner of war camp after his capture in 1941, despite his later disability.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson 1983, p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid-1923, Bader, at the age of 13, was introduced to an [[Avro 504]] during a school holiday trip to visit his aunt, Hazel, who was marrying RAF [[Flight lieutenant|Flight Lieutenant]] Cyril Burge, adjutant at [[RAF Cranwell]]. Although he enjoyed the visit and took an interest in aviation, he showed no signs of becoming a keen pilot.&lt;ref name="Turner 1995 p. 2"/&gt; Still very sports minded, an interest which dominated Bader's formative years, he took less of an interest in his studies. Bader received guidance from Warden Kendall and, with Kendall's encouragement, he excelled at his studies and was later accepted as a cadet at [[RAF Cranwell]].&lt;ref&gt;Lucas 1981, pp. 25–26.&lt;/ref&gt; Soon afterwards, he was offered a place at Oxford University, but turned it down as he preferred Cambridge University.&lt;ref&gt;Lucas 1981, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

His mother refused to allow Bader to attend Cambridge in December 1927, claiming she could not afford the fees.&lt;ref name="Turner 1995 pp. 3–4"&gt;Turner 1995 pp. 3–4.&lt;/ref&gt; A master at St. Edwards, a Mr Dingwall, helped pay these fees in part. Due to his new connection with Cyril Burge, Bader learned of the six annual prize cadetships offered by RAF Cranwell each year. Out of hundreds of applicants, he finished fifth. He left St Edward's in early 1928, aged 18.&lt;ref name="Turner 1995 pp. 3–4"&gt;Turner 1995 pp. 3–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Joining the RAF===
In 1928, Bader joined the RAF as an officer cadet at the [[Royal Air Force College Cranwell]] in rural [[Lincolnshire]]. He continued to excel at sports, and added hockey and boxing to his repertoire. Motorcycling was tolerated at Cranwell, though cadets usually took part in banned activities such as speeding, pillion racing and buying and racing motorcars. Bader was involved in these activities and was close to expulsion after being caught out too often, in addition to coming in 19th out of 21 in his class examinations; however, his commanding officer (CO), Air Vice-Marshal [[Frederick Halahan]] gave him a private warning about his conduct.&lt;ref&gt;Mackenzie 2008, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 September 1928, Bader took his first flight with his instructor [[Flying officer|Flying Officer]] W.&amp;nbsp;J. "Pissy" Pearson in an [[Avro 504]].&lt;ref&gt;Lucas 1981, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; After just 11 hours and 15 minutes of flight time, he flew his first solo, on 19 February 1929.&lt;ref&gt;Lucas 1981, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bader competed for the "Sword of Honour" award at the end of his two-year course, but lost to [[Patrick Coote]], his nearest rival. Coote went on to become the Wing Commander of Western Wing, British Air Forces Greece and was killed on 13 April 1941 while flying as an observer in a No. 211 Squadron [[Bristol Blenheim]], ''L4819'' flown by Flying Officer R. V. Herbert when six of the squadron's aircraft were shot down [[Battle of Greece|over Greece]]. Coote's aircraft was the first of 29 aerial victories for the ''Luftwaffe'' ace ''Unteroffizier'', (later ''Leutnant'') [[Fritz Gromotka]].&lt;ref&gt;Lucas 1981, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Weal 2003, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 July 1930, Bader was commissioned as a [[pilot officer]] into [[No. 23 Squadron RAF]] based at [[RAF Kenley|Kenley]], [[Surrey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/33638/pages/5298 |title=Viewing Page 5298 of Issue 33638 |publisher=''London-gazette.co.uk'', 26 August 1930 |accessdate=3 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flying [[Gloster Gamecock]]s and soon after, [[Bristol Bulldog]]s, Bader became a daredevil while training there, often flying illegal and dangerous stunts. While very fast for its time, the Bulldog had directional stability problems at low speeds, which made such stunts exceptionally dangerous. Strict orders were issued forbidding unauthorised aerobatics below {{convert|2000|ft|m}}. Douglas took this as an unnecessary safety rule rather than an order to be obeyed. After one training flight at the gunnery range, Bader achieved only a 38 percent hit rate on a target. Receiving jibes from a rival squadron ([[No. 25 Squadron RAF]]), Bader took off to perform aerobatics and show off his skill. It was against regulations, and seven out of 23 accidents caused by ignoring regulations had proven fatal. The CO of No. 25 Squadron remarked that he would order Bader to face a [[court-martial]] if Bader was in his unit. The COs of Bader's unit, [[Harry Day]] and Henry Wollett, gave the pilots more latitude, although Day encouraged them to recognise their own limits.&lt;ref&gt;Mackenzie 2008, pp. 22–23.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hendon-display-teamLG.jpg|thumb|Bader, Fl.Lt. Harry Day and Fl.Off. Geoffrey Stephenson during training for the 1932 Hendon airshow, with a [[Gloster Gamecock]]]]
No. 23 Squadron had won the [[Hendon Aerodrome|Hendon Air Show]] "pairs" event in 1929 and 1930. In 1931 Bader, teamed with Harry Day, successfully defended the squadron's title in the spring that year.&lt;ref&gt;Lucas 1981, pp. 46–47.&lt;/ref&gt; In late 1931, Bader undertook training for the 1932 Hendon Air Show, hoping to win a second consecutive title.&lt;ref&gt;Lucas 1981, pp. 48–53.&lt;/ref&gt; Two pilots had been killed attempting aerobatics. The pilots were warned not to practise these manoeuvres under {{convert|2000|ft|m}} and to keep above {{convert|500|ft|m}} at all times.&lt;ref name="Turner 1995 p. 6"&gt;Turner 1995, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, on 14 December 1931, while visiting [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]] Aero Club, he attempted some low-flying aerobatics at [[Woodley, Berkshire|Woodley Airfield]] in a Bulldog Mk. IIA, ''K1676'', of 23 Squadron,&lt;ref&gt;Ford 1999, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; apparently on a dare. His aircraft crashed when the tip of the left wing touched the ground. Bader was rushed to the [[Royal Berkshire Hospital]], where, in the hands of the prominent surgeon J. Leonard Joyce (1882–1939), both his legs were amputated&amp;nbsp;— one above and one below the knee. Bader made the following [[Laconic phrase|laconic]] entry in his logbook after the crash:
{{quote|Crashed slow-rolling near ground. Bad show.|Douglas Bader|&lt;ref&gt;Brookes 1991, p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lucas 1981, p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1932, after a long convalescence, throughout which he needed [[morphine]] for pain relief, Bader was transferred to the [[RAF Hospital Uxbridge|hospital]] at [[RAF Uxbridge]] and fought hard to regain his former abilities after he was given a new pair of artificial legs. In time, his agonising and determined efforts paid off, and he was able to drive a specially modified car, play golf, and even dance. During his convalescence there, he met and fell in love with Thelma Edwards, a waitress at a tea room called the Pantiles on the A30 London Road in Bagshot, Surrey.&lt;ref name="Turner 1995, p. 12"/&gt;

Bader got his chance to prove that he could still fly when, in June 1932, Air Under-Secretary [[Philip Sassoon]] arranged for him to take up an [[Avro 504]], which he piloted competently. A subsequent medical examination proved him fit for active service, but in April 1933 he was notified that the RAF had decided to reverse the decision on the grounds that this situation was not covered by King's Regulations. In May, Bader was invalided out of the RAF, took an office job with the [[Asiatic Petroleum Company]] (now [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]]) and, on 5 October 1933, married Thelma Edwards.&lt;ref&gt;Lucas 1981, p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Return to RAF===
With increasing tensions in Europe in 1937–1939, Bader repeatedly requested that the Air Ministry give him a posting and he was finally invited to a selection board meeting at [[Television House#Adastral House|Adastral House]] in Kingsway.&lt;ref&gt;Turner 1995, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Bader was disappointed to learn that it was only "ground jobs" that were being offered. It appeared that he would be refused a flying position;&lt;ref name="Turner 1995 p. 20"&gt;Turner 1995, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; but Air Vice Marshal Halahan, commandant of RAF Cranwell in Bader's days there, personally endorsed him and asked the [[Central Flying School]], [[Upavon]], to assess his capabilities.&lt;ref name="Turner 1995 p. 20"/&gt;

On 14 October 1939, the Central Flying School requested Bader report for flight tests on 18 October. He did not wait; driving down the next morning, Bader undertook refresher courses.&lt;ref name="Turner 1995 p. 21"&gt;Turner 1995, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite reluctance on the part of the establishment to allow him to apply for an A.1.B. (full flying category status), his persistent efforts paid off.&lt;ref&gt;Brickhill 1954, p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt; Bader regained a medical categorisation for operational flying at the end of November 1939 and was posted to the Central Flying School for a refresher course on modern types of aircraft. On 27 November, eight years after his accident, Bader flew solo again in an [[Avro Tutor]]; once airborne, he could not resist the temptation to turn the biplane upside down at {{convert|600|ft|m}} inside the circuit area. Bader subsequently progressed through the [[Fairey Battle]] and [[Miles Master]] (the last training stage before flying [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfires]] and [[Hawker Hurricane|Hurricanes]]).&lt;ref&gt;Brickhill 1954, p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Second World War==
===Phoney War===
[[File:Squadron Leader D R S Bader, DSO, DFC. (1940) (Art.IWM ART LD 832).jpg|thumb|Squadron Leader D R S Bader, DSO, DFC. (1940) by [[Eric Kennington]],(Art.IWM ART LD 832)]]
In January 1940, Bader was posted to [[No. 19 Squadron RAF|No. 19 Squadron]] based at [[Duxford Aerodrome|RAF Duxford]] near [[Cambridge]], where, at 29, he was older than most of his fellow pilots. [[Squadron Leader]] Geoffrey Stephenson, a close friend from his Cranwell days, was the commanding officer, and it was here that Bader got his first glimpse of a Spitfire.&lt;ref name="Turner 1995 p. 22"&gt;Turner 1995, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; It was thought that Bader's success as a fighter pilot was partly because of his having no legs; pilots pulling high "[[g-force]]s" in combat turns often "blacked out" as the flow of blood from the brain drained to other parts of the body, usually the legs. As Bader had no legs he could remain conscious longer, and thus had an advantage over more able-bodied opponents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://douglasbaderfoundation.co.uk/about-the-dbf/sir-douglas-bader/ "Douglas Bader Foundation: The advantages of artificial limbs."]  ''Douglasbaderfoundation.co.uk''. Retrieved 27 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between February and May 1940 Bader practised formation flying, air tactics, and undertook flights over sea convoys. Bader found opposition to his ideas about aerial combat. He favoured using the sun and altitude to ambush the enemy, but the RAF did not share his opinions. Official orders/doctrine dictated that pilots should fly line-astern and attack singly. Despite this being at odds with his preferred tactics, Bader obeyed orders, and his skill saw him rapidly promoted to section leader.&lt;ref name="Turner 1995 p. 24"&gt;Turner 1995, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

During this time, Bader crashed a Spitfire on take-off. He had forgotten to switch the [[Blade pitch|propeller pitch]] from coarse to fine, and the aircraft careered down the runway at 80&amp;nbsp;mph, ultimately crashing. Despite a head wound, Bader got into another Spitfire for a second attempt. Leigh-Mallory made Bader a flight commander of [[No. 222 Squadron RAF]] a few weeks later which also meant an advance from flying officer to flight lieutenant.&lt;ref name="Turner 1995 p. 24"/&gt;

===Battle of France===
Bader had his first taste of combat with [[No. 222 Squadron RAF]], which was based at [[RAF Duxford]] and commanded by another old friend of his, Squadron Leader "Tubby" Mermagen. On 10 May the ''[[Wehrmacht]]'' invaded [[German occupation of Luxembourg in World War II|Luxembourg]], the [[Battle of the Netherlands|Netherlands]], [[Battle of Belgium|Belgium]] and [[Battle of France|France]]. The campaigns went badly for the [[Allies of World War II|Western Allies]] and soon they were [[Dunkirk evacuation|evacuating from Dunkirk]] during [[Battle of Dunkirk|the battle for the port]]. RAF Squadrons were ordered to provide [[air supremacy]] for the [[Royal Navy]] during [[Dunkirk evacuation|Operation Dynamo]]. While patrolling the coast near [[Dunkirk]] on 1 June 1940&lt;ref name="Mackenzie 2008 p. 38"&gt;Mackenzie 2008, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; at around {{convert|3000|ft|m|abbr=on}}, Bader happened upon a [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]] in front of him, flying in the same direction and at approximately the same speed. He believed that the German must have been a novice, taking no evasive action even though it took more than one burst of gunfire to shoot him down.&lt;ref&gt;Lucas 1981, p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt; Bader was also credited with a [[Messerschmitt Bf 110]] damaged, despite claiming five victories in that particular dogfight.&lt;ref name="Mackenzie 2008 p. 39"&gt;Mackenzie 2008, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the next patrol Bader was credited with a [[Heinkel He 111]] damaged. On 4 June 1940, his encounter with a [[Dornier Do 17]], which was attacking Allied shipping,&lt;ref name="Mackenzie 2008 p. 39"&gt;Mackenzie 2008, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; involved a near collision while he was firing at the aircraft's rear gunner during a high-speed pass. Shortly after Bader joined 222 Squadron, it moved to [[RAF Kirton in Lindsey]], just south of the [[Humber]].&lt;ref&gt;Bader 2004, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

After flying operations over Dunkirk, Bader was posted to command [[No. 242 Squadron RAF]] as acting squadron leader on 28 June 1940,&lt;ref name="Mackenzie 2008 p. 48"&gt;Mackenzie 2008, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; a [[Hawker Hurricane]] unit based at [[RAF Coltishall]], mainly made up of [[Canadians]] who had suffered high losses in the [[Battle of France]] and had low morale. Despite initial resistance to their new commanding officer, the pilots were soon won over by Bader's strong personality and perseverance, especially in cutting through red tape to make the squadron operational again. Bader transformed 242 Squadron back into an effective fighting unit. Upon the formation of [[No. 12 Group RAF]], 242 Squadron was assigned to the Group while based at RAF Duxford.&lt;ref name="Mackenzie 2008 p. 46"&gt;Mackenzie 2008, p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; No. 242 Squadron only became fully operational on 9 July 1940.&lt;ref name="Mackenzie 2008 p. 54"&gt;Mackenzie 2008, p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Battle of Britain===
[[File:Squadron Leader Douglas Bader, CO of No. 242 Squadron, seated on his Hawker Hurricane at Duxford, September 1940. CH1406.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.4|Bader sitting on his Hurricane, as commanding officer of No.242 Squadron after the Battle of France]]

After the French campaign, the RAF prepared for the coming [[Battle of Britain]] in which the ''Luftwaffe'' intended to achieve [[air supremacy]]. Once attained, the Germans would attempt to launch [[Operation Sea Lion|Operation ''Sea Lion'']], the codename for an invasion of Britain. The battle officially began on 10 July 1940.

On 11 July, Bader scored his first victory with his new squadron.&lt;ref&gt;Burns 2002, p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; The cloud base was down to just 600&amp;nbsp;ft while drizzle and mist covered most of the sky, and forward visibility was down to just 2,000 yards. Bader was alone on patrol, and was soon directed toward an enemy aircraft flying north up the [[Norfolk]] coast.&lt;ref&gt;Lucas 1981, p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt; Spotting the aircraft at 600 yards, Bader recognised it as a [[Dornier Do 17]], and after he closed to 250 yards its rear gunner opened fire. Bader continued his attack and fired two bursts into the bomber before it vanished into cloud.&lt;ref&gt;Bader 2004, pp. 19–20.&lt;/ref&gt; The Dornier, which crashed into the sea off [[Cromer]], was later confirmed by a member of the [[Royal Observer Corps]]. On 21 August, a similar engagement took place. This time, a Dornier went into the sea off [[Great Yarmouth]] and again the Observer Corps confirmed the claim. There were no survivors.&lt;ref&gt;Lucas 1981, p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Turner 2007, pp. 22–23.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in the month, Bader scored a further two victories over [[Messerschmitt Bf 110]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Lucas 1981, p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brickhill 2004, p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 August 1940, No. 242 Squadron was moved to Duxford again and found itself in the thick of the fighting.&lt;ref name="Mackenzie 2008 p. 54"&gt;Mackenzie 2008, p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; On this date, the squadron claimed 10 enemy aircraft, Bader scoring two victories against Bf 110s.&lt;ref&gt;Burns 2002, pp. 59 (date), 61 (battle description).&lt;/ref&gt; Other squadrons were involved, and it was impossible to verify which RAF units were responsible for the damage on the enemy.&lt;ref name="Mackenzie 2008 p. 58"&gt;Mackenzie 2008, p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt; On 7 September, two more Bf 110s were shot down, but in the same engagement Bader was badly hit by a [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]]. Bader almost {{Not a typo|baled}} out, but recovered the Hurricane. Other pilots witnessed one of Bader's victims crash.&lt;ref&gt;Brickhill 2004, pp. 209–211.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 September, Bader claimed two Bf 109s shot down, followed by a [[Junkers Ju 88]].&lt;ref name="Lucas 1981, p. 138"&gt;Lucas 1981, p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt; On 9 September, Bader claimed another Dornier.&lt;ref&gt;Lucas 1981, pp. 136–137.&lt;/ref&gt; During the same mission, he attacked a He 111 only to discover he was out of ammunition. Enraged, he thought about ramming it and slicing off the [[rudder]] with his propeller, but turned away when he regained his composure.&lt;ref&gt;Brickhill 2004, p. 214.&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 September, Bader was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Order]] (DSO) for his combat leadership.&lt;ref&gt;Burns 2002, p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 September, known as the [[Battle of Britain Day]], Bader damaged a Do 17 and a Ju 88, while destroying another Do 17 in the afternoon.&lt;ref&gt;Brickhill 2004, pp. 219–225.&lt;/ref&gt; Bader flew several missions that day, which involved heavy air combat.&lt;ref&gt;Price 1990, pp. 34, 51–53, 80, 89, 121.&lt;/ref&gt; The original combat report states that he destroyed one enemy aircraft, claimed no probable, but did claim several damaged.&lt;ref&gt;Turner 2007, no page number: image of report in photo gallery between pp. 64–65.&lt;/ref&gt; The Dornier's gunner attempted to bale out, but his parachute was caught on the tail wheel and he died when the aircraft crashed into the [[Thames Estuary]].&lt;ref&gt;Turner 1995, p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; Further detail suggests Bader took pity on the gunner and "tried to kill him to put him out of his misery".&lt;ref&gt;Turner 1995, p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt; Another Do 17 and a Ju 88 were claimed on 18 September.&lt;ref name="Lucas 1981, p. 138"/&gt; A Bf 109 was claimed on 27 September.&lt;ref&gt;Shores and Williams 1994, p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt; Bader was [[The London Gazette|gazetted]] on 1 October 1940.&lt;ref name="dso"/&gt; On 24 September, he had been promoted to the war substantive rank of flight lieutenant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/35042/pages/274 |title=Viewing Page 274 of Issue 35042 |publisher=''London-gazette.co.uk,'' 14 January 1941 |accessdate=3 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a friend and supporter of his 12 Group commander, Air Vice Marshal [[Trafford Leigh-Mallory]], Bader joined him as an active exponent of the controversial "[[Big Wing]]" theory which provoked much [[Battle of Britain Day#British strategy|debate in the RAF during the battle]].&lt;ref&gt;Lucas 1981, pp. 125–129.&lt;/ref&gt; Bader was an outspoken critic of the careful "husbanding" tactics being used by Air Vice Marshal [[Keith Park]], the commander of 11 Group. Park was supported by [[RAF Fighter Command|Fighter Command]] Air Chief Marshal [[Hugh Dowding, 1st Baron Dowding|Sir Hugh Dowding]], the overall commander. Bader vociferously campaigned for an aggressive policy of assembling large formations of defensive fighters north of London ready to inflict maximum damage on the massed German bomber formations as they flew over [[South East England]]. As the Battle progressed, Bader often found himself at the head of a composite wing of fighters consisting of up to five squadrons, known as the "[[Duxford Wing]]". Achievements of the Big Wing were hard to quantify, as the large formations often took too long to form up, over claimed victories, and too often did not provide timely support of the over-committed 11 Group. The episode probably contributed to the departure of Park, who was replaced with Leigh-Mallory in November 1940, and Dowding.&lt;ref&gt;Lucas 1981, pp. 154–158.&lt;/ref&gt; While it is not known whether Mallory and Bader were aware that the claims of the RAF and Big Wings were exaggerated, they certainly tried to use them as a potent tool with which to remove Park and Dowding from command and pursue the Big Wing tactic.&lt;ref&gt;Ray 2009, p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt; After the war, Bader insisted that both he and Leigh-Mallory wanted the Big Wing tactic enacted in 12 Group only. They both believed, according to Bader, that it was impractical to use it in 11 Group, as the command was located too close to the enemy and would not have enough time to assemble.&lt;ref&gt;Ray 2000, p. 2009, p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt;

RAF ace [[Johnnie Johnson (RAF officer)|Johnnie Johnson]] offered a balanced view of Bader and the Big Wing:
{{quote|Douglas was all for the Big Wings to counter the German formation[s]. I think there was room for both tactics – the Big Wings and the small squadrons. It might well have been fatal had Park always tried to get his squadrons into "Balbos", for not only would they have taken longer to get to their height, but sixty or seventy packed climbing fighters could have been seen for miles and would have been sitting ducks for higher 109s. Also nothing would have pleased [[Göring]] more than for his 109s to pounce on large numbers of RAF fighters. Indeed, Adolf Galland and [[Werner Mölders]] complained about the elusiveness of Fighter Command and Park's brilliance was that by refusing to concentrate his force he preserved it throughout the battle. This does not mean, as Bader pointed out at the time, that two or three Balbos from 10 and 12 Groups, gaining height beyond the range of the 109s, would not have played a terrific part in the fighting.&lt;ref&gt;Turner 1995, p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

During the Battle of Britain, Bader used three Hawker Hurricanes. The first was ''P3061'', in which he scored six air victories. The second aircraft was unknown, but Bader did score one victory and two damaged in it on 9 September. The third was ''V7467'', in which he destroyed four more and added one probable and two damaged by the end of September. The machine was lost on 1 September 1941 while on a training exercise.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 1998, p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 December 1940, Bader was awarded the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Flying Cross]] (DFC) for his services during the Battle of Britain. His unit, No. 242 Squadron, had claimed 62 aerial victories.&lt;ref&gt;Burns 2002, p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt; Bader was gazetted on 7 January 1941. By this time, he was an acting [[squadron leader]].&lt;ref name="dfc"/&gt;

===Wing leader===
[[File:Douglas Bader by Cuthbert Orde.JPG|thumb|right|Douglas Bader by [[Cuthbert Orde]], March 1941]]

On 18 March 1941, Bader was promoted to acting [[Wing Commander (rank)|wing commander]] and became one of the first "[[wing leader]]s".&lt;ref&gt;Burns 2002, p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Turner 1995, p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt; Stationed at [[RAF Tangmere|Tangmere]] with [[No. 145 Squadron RAF|145]], [[No. 610 Squadron RAF|610]] and [[No. 616 Squadron RAF|616 Squadrons]] under his command,&lt;ref&gt;Burns 2002, p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt; Bader led his wing of Spitfires on sweeps and [[Circus offensive|"Circus" operations]] (medium bomber escort) over north-western Europe throughout the summer campaign. These were missions combining bombers and fighters designed to lure out and tie down German ''Luftwaffe'' fighter units that might otherwise serve on the Russian front. One of the wing leader's "perks" was permission to have his initials marked on his aircraft as personal identification, thus "D-B" was painted on the side of Bader's Spitfire. These letters gave rise to his radio call-sign "[[Dogsbody]]".&lt;ref&gt;Jackson 1983, p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt;

During 1941 his wing was re-equipped with [[Supermarine Spitfire (early Merlin powered variants)#Mk V (Types 331, 349 &amp; 352)|Spitfire VB]]s, which had two Hispano 20&amp;nbsp;mm [[cannon]] and four .303 [[machine gun]]s. Bader flew a Mk VA equipped with eight .303 machine guns, as he insisted that these guns were more effective against fighter opposition. His tactics required a close-in approach in which he felt the lower calibre weapons had a more devastating effect. At the time, RAF trials with wing-mounted cannons had also revealed a number of shortcomings that precluded a widespread acceptance of the armament.&lt;ref&gt;Price 2002, p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bader's combat missions were mainly fought against Bf 109s over France and the [[English Channel|Channel]]. On 7 May 1941 he shot down one Bf 109 and claimed another as a probable victory. The German formation belonged to ''[[Jagdgeschwader 26]]'' (Fighter Wing 26), which on that date was led in action by German ace [[Adolf Galland]], and was also when Galland claimed his 68th victory.&lt;ref&gt;Burns 2002, p. 152.&lt;/ref&gt; Bader and Galland met again 94 days later. On 21 June 1941, Bader shot down a Bf 109E off the coast near [[Desvres]]. His victory was witnessed by two other pilots who saw a Bf 109 crash and the German pilot bale out.&lt;ref&gt;Turner 1995, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Turner 2007, p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Burns 2002, p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 June 1941 Bader shot down two more Bf 109Fs. The first was shot down between 11:58 and 13:35 off the coast of [[Gravelines]]; the pilot {{Not a typo|baled}} out.&lt;ref&gt;Turner 1995, p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt; In the same action he shared in the destruction of another Bf 109F.&lt;ref&gt;Burns 2002, p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt; The second Bf 109 was shot down in the afternoon.&lt;ref&gt;Turner 1995, pp. 97–98.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Turner 2007, p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt;

The following month was more successful for Bader. On 2 July 1941 he was awarded the [[Medal bar|bar]] to his DSO. Later that day he claimed one Bf 109 destroyed and another damaged.&lt;ref&gt;Burns 2002, p. 167.&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 July, Bader fired on a Bf 109E which slowed down so much that he nearly collided with it. Squadron Leader Burton saw the entire combat and noted the Bf 109 "fell away in a sloppy fashion", "as though the pilot had been hit". It was marked as a probable. On 6 July another Bf 109 was shot down and the pilot {{Not a typo|baled}} out. This victory was witnessed by Pilot Officers [[Johnnie Johnson (RAF officer)|Johnnie Johnson]] and [[Alan Smith (RAF officer)|Alan Smith]] (Bader's usual wingman).&lt;ref&gt;Turner 1995, p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt; On 9 July, Bader claimed one probable and one damaged, both trailing coolant or oil. On 10 July Bader claimed a Bf 109 (and one damaged) over Bethune. Later, Bader destroyed a Bf 109E which blew up south of, or actually over, [[Calais]].&lt;ref&gt;Turner 1995, p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 July, Bader found further success, shooting down one Bf 109 and damaging three others between Bethune and St Omer.&lt;ref&gt;Turner 1995, p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Burns 2002, p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt; Bader was again gazetted on 15 July.&lt;ref name="dsobar"/&gt; On 23 July, Bader claimed another Bf 109 damaged and possibly destroyed, even though the action resulted in two Bf 109s destroyed. The other was shot down by Squadron Leader Burton. Bader did not see his Bf 109 crash, so he claimed it as a damaged only, despite the fact pilots of [[No. 242 Squadron RAF]] saw two Bf 109s crash.&lt;ref&gt;Turner 1995, p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Burns 2002, p. 179.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bader had been pushing for more sorties to fly in late 1941 but his Wing was tired. He was intent on adding to his score, which, according to the CO of [[No. 616 Squadron RAF]] Billy Burton, brought the other pilots and mood in his wing to a near-mutinous state. Trafford Leigh-Mallory, Bader's immediate superior as OC No. 11 Group, Fighter Command, relented and allowed Bader to continue frequent missions over France even though his score of 20 and the accompanying strain evident on his features obliged Leigh-Mallory to consider his withdrawal from operations. Ultimately, Leigh-Mallory did not want to upset his star pilot, and did not invoke any restrictions.&lt;ref&gt;Mackenzie 2008, p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Last combat===
Between 24 March and 9 August 1941, Bader flew 62 fighter sweeps over France.&lt;ref&gt;Lucas 1981, p. 179.&lt;/ref&gt; On 9 August 1941, Bader was flying a [[Supermarine Spitfire (early Merlin powered variants)#Mk V (Types 331, 349 &amp; 352)|Spitfire Mk VA]] serial ''W3185'' "D-B" on an offensive patrol over the French coast, looking for Messerschmitt Bf 109s from Abbeville or Wissant&lt;ref&gt;Price 1997, p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bader 2004, pp. 30–31.&lt;/ref&gt; without his trusted wingman Alan Smith. Smith, who was described by fellow pilot Johnnie Johnson as "leechlike" and the "perfect number two",&lt;ref&gt;Wing Leader, The Reprint Society (originally published by Chatto and Windus, 1956). p.85&lt;/ref&gt; was unable to fly on that day due to a head cold, so was in London being fitted for a new uniform ready for his officer commission.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/military-obituaries/air-force-obituaries/9908401/Sir-Alan-Smith.html Sir Alan Smith Obituary Daily Telegraph]. Retrieved 4 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible that this may have been a contributing factor as to how events unfolded.

Just after Bader's section of four aircraft crossed the coast, 12 Bf 109s were spotted flying in formation approximately 2,000 to 3,000&amp;nbsp;feet (600 to 900 metres) below them and travelling in the same direction. Bader dived on them too fast and too steeply to be able to aim and fire his guns, and barely avoided colliding with one of them. He levelled out at 24,000&amp;nbsp;feet (7,300&amp;nbsp;metres) to find that he was now alone, separated from his section, and was considering whether to return home when he spotted three pairs of Bf 109s a couple of miles in front of him.&lt;ref&gt;Bader 2004, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; He dropped down below them and closed up before destroying one of them with a short burst of fire from close range. Bader was just opening fire on a second Bf 109, which trailed white smoke and dropped down, when he noticed the two on his left turning towards him. At this point he decided it would be better to return home; however, making the mistake of banking away from them, Bader believed he had a mid-air collision with the second of the two Bf 109s on his right that were continuing straight ahead.&lt;ref name="Bader32-33"&gt;Bader 2004, pp. 32–33.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Turner 1995, pp. 102–103.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bader's fuselage, tail and fin were gone from behind him, and he lost height rapidly at what he estimated to be 400&amp;nbsp;mph (640&amp;nbsp;km/hr) in a slow spin. He jettisoned the cockpit canopy, released his harness pin, and the air rushing past the open cockpit started to suck him out, but his prosthetic leg was trapped. Part way out of the cockpit and still attached to his aircraft, Bader fell for some time before he released his parachute, at which point the leg's retaining strap snapped under the strain and he was pulled free.&lt;ref name="Bader32-33"/&gt; A Bf 109 flew by some 50 yards away as he neared the ground at around 4,000&amp;nbsp;feet (1,200&amp;nbsp;metres).&lt;ref&gt;Turner 1995, pp. 104–105.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controversy over cause===
Although Bader believed for years that he had collided in midair with a Bf 109, two other possibilities have later been put forward; that he was shot down by a German Bf 109, or alternatively that he may have been a victim of [[friendly fire]].&lt;ref&gt;Mackenzie 2008, p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt; Recent research shows no Bf 109 was lost to a collision that day, and there is also doubt that a German pilot was responsible for shooting him down. ''Feldwebel'' Max Meyer of II./''[[Jagdgeschwader 26]]'' flying a Bf 109 had claimed him shot down that morning and according to ''Luftwaffe'' records a ''Leutnant'' Kosse of 5./JG 26 and Meyer, of 6./JG 26 were the only German pilots to claim a victory that day. Furthermore, Meyer mentioned that he had followed the downed Spitfire and watched the pilot bale out, something which seems to match this passage in Bader's memoirs:

{{quote|I was floating in the sunshine above broken, white cloud&amp;nbsp;... I heard an aeroplane just after I passed through. A Bf 109 flew past.&lt;ref&gt;Lucas 1981, p. 191.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Bader met Max Meyer in [[Sydney]] in 1981 during the Schofields Air Show.&lt;ref&gt;Lucas 1981, p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt; None of the German pilots who made a claim for an aerial victory that day could match their report with the demise of Bader's Spitfire. Adolf Galland, ''[[Geschwaderkommodore]]'' of ''[[Jagdgeschwader 26]]'' (JG 26 or Fighter Wing 26), went through every report, even those of German pilots killed in the action, to determine Bader's victor. Each case was dismissed.&lt;ref&gt;Saunders 2007, p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; Kosse's claim only matches the victory against [[No. 452 Squadron RAF]]'s Sergeant Haydon.&lt;ref&gt;Saunders 2007, p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, in 2003 air historian Andy Saunders wrote a book ''Bader's Last Flight'', following up with a [[Channel 4]] documentary ''Who Downed Douglas Bader?'', which first aired on 28 August 2006.&lt;ref name="Saunders 2007, p. 102"&gt;Saunders 2007, p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt; Saunders' research now suggests that Bader may have been a victim of friendly fire, shot down by one of his fellow RAF pilots after becoming detached from his own squadron. RAF combat records indicate Bader may have been shot down by Flight Lieutenant "Buck" Casson of [[No. 616 Squadron RAF]], who claimed a Bf 109 whose tail came off and the pilot {{Not a typo|baled}} out, before he himself was shot down and captured.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson 1983, pp. 102–103.&lt;/ref&gt; Casson also mentioned that for a while he watched as the pilot struggled to bale out. Bader was flying at the rear of the German fighter formation, alone, and his squadron were the opposite side of the Germans. "Buck" had only a few seconds in which he saw Bader and mistook his Spitfire for a Bf 109. In a letter to Bader on 28 May 1945, Casson explained the action. While this source made it into the public domain, it was severely edited. The nature of the letter, that it was from Casson to Bader, was removed. Crucially, an entire paragraph, which mentioned specifically the tail coming off "a Bf 109" and the pilot struggling to get out of the cockpit, was completely omitted from the original source, still in the Casson family's possession. Saunders stated that this was not absolute proof, and that it would be helpful to find the "Bader Spitfire".&lt;ref name="Saunders p.88"&gt;Saunders 2007, p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Search for W3185===
The quest to find Bader's Spitfire, ''W3185'', shed light on the demise of another famous wartime ace, [[Wilhelm Balthasar]], ''Geschwaderkommodore'' of ''[[Jagdgeschwader 2]]'', who was killed in action on 3 July 1941 when his Bf 109F crashed into Ferme Goset, [[Wittes]], France. It was recovered in March 2004.&lt;ref&gt;Saunders 2007, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, in the summer 2004, a further aircraft was discovered in Widdebrouch. It was found to be that of a Bf 109F, flown by ''[[Unteroffizier]]'' Albert Schlager of JG 26, who was reported missing during Bader's last combat on 9 August 1941.&lt;ref&gt;Saunders 2007, p. 93 (picture unmarked page opposite p. 97).&lt;/ref&gt; A brief glimpse of hope was discovered later, when a Spitfire wreck was found. Inside was a flying helmet with the letters "DB" written on the top. It was later identified as a Spitfire IX, owing to the findings of a 20mm cannon (which Bader's Spitfire did not have), and ammunition dated as 1943.&lt;ref&gt;Saunders 2007, pp. 99–100.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bader's aircraft was not found. It is likely that it came down at Mont Dupil Farm near the French village of [[Blaringhem]], possibly near Desprez sawmill. A French witness, Jacques Taffin, saw the Spitfire disintegrating as it came down. He thought it had been hit by anti-aircraft fire, but none was active in the area. There were also no Spitfire remains in the area. The lack of any remains was not surprising, owing to the Spitfire breaking up on its descent. Historians have also been misled as to the whereabouts of the Spitfire because of a mistake in the book ''Reach for the Sky'', in which Bader stated his leg had been dug out from the wreckage but was damaged, indicating a definite crash site. Bader's leg had actually been found in an open field.&lt;ref&gt;Saunders 2007, pp. 116–118.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prisoner of war===
[[File:PicOf 4C Colditz.jpg|thumb|[[Colditz Castle]] in April 1945. Bader was a prisoner here for nearly three years]]

The Germans treated Bader with great respect. When he {{Not a typo|baled}} out, Bader's right [[Prosthesis|prosthetic]] leg became trapped in the aircraft, and he escaped only when the leg's retaining straps snapped after he pulled the ripcord on his parachute.&lt;ref&gt;Lucas 1981, p. 187.&lt;/ref&gt; General Adolf Galland notified the British of his damaged leg and offered them safe passage to drop off a replacement. [[Hermann Göring]] himself gave the green light for the operation. The British responded on 19 August 1941 with the "Leg Operation"&amp;nbsp;— an RAF bomber was allowed to drop a new prosthetic leg by parachute to [[Saint-Omer|St Omer]], a ''Luftwaffe'' base in occupied France, as part of Circus 81 involving six [[Bristol Blenheim]]s and a sizeable fighter escort. The Germans were less impressed when, task done, the bombers proceeded on to their bombing mission to [[Gosnay]] Power Station near [[Béthune|Bethune]], although bad weather prevented the target being attacked. Galland stated in an interview that the aircraft dropped the leg after bombing Galland's airfield.&lt;ref&gt;Mackenzie 2008, pp. 130–131.&lt;/ref&gt; Galland did not meet Bader again until mid-1945, when he, [[Günther Rall]] and [[Hans-Ulrich Rudel]] arrived at [[RAF Tangmere]] as prisoners of war. Bader, according to Rall, personally arranged for Rudel, a fellow amputee, to be fitted with an artificial leg.&lt;ref&gt;Saunders 2007, p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bader escaped from the hospital where he was recovering by tying together sheets. Initially the "rope" did not reach the ground; with the help of another patient, he slid the sheet from under the comatose New Zealand pilot, Bill Russell of No. 485 Squadron, who had had his arm amputated the day before. Russell's bed was then moved to the window to act as an anchor. A French maid at the St. Omer hospital attempted to get in touch with British agents to enable Bader to escape to Britain. She later brought a letter from a peasant couple (a Mr. and Mrs. Hiecques), who promised to shelter him outside St. Omer until he could be passed further down the line. Until then, their son would wait outside the hospital every night until there was a chance of escape. Eventually, he escaped out of a window. The plan worked initially. Bader completed the long walk to the safe house despite wearing a British uniform. Unfortunately for him, the plan was betrayed by another woman at the hospital. He hid in the garden when a German staff car arrived at the house, but was found later. Bader denied that the couple had known he was there. They, along with the French woman at the hospital, were sent for forced labour in Germany. The couple survived. After the war, French authorities sentenced the woman informer to 20 years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;Turner 1995, p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the next few years, Bader made himself a thorn in the side of the Germans. He often practised what the RAF personnel called [[goon baiting|"goon-baiting"]].&lt;ref&gt;Turner 1995, p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt; He considered it his duty to cause as much trouble to the enemy as possible,&lt;ref&gt;Lucas 1981, p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; much of which included escape attempts. He made so many escape attempts that the Germans threatened to take away his legs. In August 1942, Bader escaped with Johnny Palmer and three others from the camp at ''[[Stalag Luft III]] B'' in [[Żagań|Sagan]].&lt;ref&gt;Lucas 1981, p. 200.&lt;/ref&gt; Unluckily, a ''Luftwaffe'' officer of ''[[Jagdgeschwader 26]]'' was in the area. Keen to meet the Tangmere wing leader, he dropped by to see Bader, but when he knocked on his door, there was no answer. Soon the alarm was raised, and a few days later, Bader was recaptured.&lt;ref&gt;Lucas 1981, p. 205.&lt;/ref&gt; During the escape attempt, the Germans produced a poster of Bader and Palmer asking for information. It described Bader's disability and said he "walks well with stick". Twenty years later, Bader was sent a copy of it by a Belgian civilian prisoner, who had worked in a ''[[Gestapo]]'' office in [[Leipzig]]. Bader found this amusing, as he had never used a stick.&lt;ref&gt;Lucas 1981, p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt; He was finally dispatched to the "escape-proof" [[Colditz Castle]] ''[[Oflag IV-C]]'' on 18 August 1942, where he remained until 15 April 1945 when it was liberated by the [[First United States Army]].&lt;ref&gt;Turner 1995, p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lucas 1981, p. 201.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-war==
===Last years in the RAF===
After his return to Britain, Bader was given the honour of leading a victory [[flypast]] of 300 aircraft over London in June 1945. On 1 July, he was promoted to temporary [[Wing commander (rank)|wing commander]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/37240/supplements/4331 |title=Viewing Page 4331 of Issue 37240 |publisher=''London-gazette.co.uk,'' 24 August 1945 |accessdate=3 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after, Bader was looking for a post in the RAF. Air Marshal [[Richard Atcherley]], a former [[Schneider Trophy]] pilot, was commanding the Central Fighter Establishment at Tangmere. He and Bader had been junior officers at Kenley in 1930, while serving in [[No. 23 Squadron RAF]]. Bader was given the post of the Fighter Leader's School commanding officer. He received a promotion to war substantive wing commander on 1 December&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/37418/supplements/228 |title=Viewing Page 228 of Issue 37418 |publisher=''London-gazette.co.uk,'' 1 January 1946 |accessdate=3 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and soon after was promoted to temporary [[group captain]].&lt;ref name="Lucas 211-213"&gt;Lucas 1981, pp. 211–213.&lt;/ref&gt;

Unfortunately for Bader, fighter aircraft's roles had now grown significantly and he spent most of his time instructing on ground attack and co-operation with ground forces. Also, Bader did not get on with the newer generation of squadron leaders who considered him to be "out of date". In the end, Air Marshal [[James Robb (RAF officer)|James Robb]] offered Bader a role commanding the [[North Weald]] sector of [[No. 11 Group RAF]], an organisation steeped in Fighter Command and Battle of Britain history.&lt;ref name="Lucas 211-213"/&gt; It is likely Bader would have stayed in the RAF for some time had his mentor Leigh-Mallory not been killed in an air crash in November 1944, such was the respect and influence he held over Bader,&lt;ref name="Lucas 1981, pp. 209–211"&gt;Lucas 1981, pp. 209–211.&lt;/ref&gt; but Bader's enthusiasm for continued service in the RAF waned.&lt;ref&gt;Lucas 1981, p. 213.&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 July 1946, Bader retired from the RAF with the rank of group captain&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/37676/pages/3985 |title=Viewing Page 3985 of Issue 37676 |publisher=''London-gazette.co.uk,'' 2 August 1946 |accessdate=3 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; to take a job at [[Royal Dutch Shell]].&lt;ref&gt;Lucas 1981, p. 214.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-war career===
Bader considered politics, and standing as a [[Member of Parliament]] for his home constituency in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]]. He despised how the three main political parties used war veterans for their own political ends. Instead, he resolved to join Shell. His decision was not motivated by money, but a willingness to repay a debt. Shell had been ready to take him on, aged 23, after his accident. Other companies had offered him more money, but he chose to join Shell on principle. There was another incentive. Joining Shell would allow him to continue flying. He would travel as an executive, and it meant he could fly a light aircraft.&lt;ref name="Lucas 1981, pp. 209–211"/&gt; He spent most of his time abroad flying around in a company-owned [[Percival Proctor]] and later a  [[Miles Gemini]]. On one mission, between 15 August and 16 September 1946, Bader was sent on a public relations mission for Shell around Europe and [[North Africa]] with [[United States Army Air Forces]] (USAAF) Lieutenant General [[Jimmy Doolittle|James Doolittle]], Doolittle having left active duty in January 1946 and returned to the Reserves.&lt;ref&gt;Lucas 1981, p. 217.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bader became Managing Director of [[Shell Aircraft]] until he retired in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rafmuseum.org.uk/research/online-exhibitions/douglas-bader-fighter-pilot/back-to-civilian-life.aspx "Back to civilian life"]. ''Rafmuseum.org.uk''. Retrieved 27 February 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;  That same year, he also served as a technical advisor to the film, ''[[Battle of Britain (film)|Battle of Britain]]''.  Bader travelled to every major country outside the [[Communist world]],&lt;ref&gt;Lucas 1981, pp. 232, 239, 260, 263.&lt;/ref&gt; becoming internationally famous and a popular after-dinner speaker on aviation matters. In 1975 he spoke at the funeral of [[Air Chief Marshal]] [[Keith Park]].

===Personality===
[[File:Douglas Bader 1955.jpg|thumb|left|Bader in 1955]]
When the film ''[[Reach for the Sky]]'' was released, people associated Bader with the quiet and amiable personality of actor [[Kenneth More]], who played Bader. Bader recognised that the producers had deleted all those habits he displayed when on operations, particularly his prolific use of bad language. Bader once said, "[they] still think [I'm] the dashing chap Kenneth More was". Bader's more controversial traits were touched upon by Brickhill in the book ''Reach for the Sky''. "He is a somewhat 'difficult' person," Brickhill told (Sir) Billy Collins, head of his publishing house William Collins and Sons, after spending over a year talking to him.&lt;ref name="Dando-Collins 2016 p. 268"&gt;Dando-Collins 2016, p. 268.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Bader was received as a legendary figure by the wider public, who closely identified him as a leader of ''[[The Few]]'' in the [[Battle of Britain]].&lt;ref name="Mackenzie 2008 p. 166"&gt;Mackenzie 2008, p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt;

Never a person to hide his opinions, Bader also became controversial for his political interventions. A staunch conservative with traditional Victorian values, his trenchantly expressed views on such subjects as juvenile delinquency, [[apartheid]] and [[Rhodesia]]'s defiance of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] (he was a strong supporter of [[Ian Smith]]'s white minority regime) attracted much criticism.&lt;ref&gt;Lucas 1981, pp. 261–262.&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Suez Crisis]], Bader travelled to [[New Zealand]]. Some of the more recent African Commonwealth countries had been critical of British military intervention; he replied that they could "bloody well climb back up their trees".&lt;ref name="Mackenzie 2008 p. 166"/&gt; During a trip to [[South Africa]] in November 1965, Bader said that if he had been in Rhodesia when it made its declaration of independence, he "would have had serious thoughts about changing my citizenship".&lt;ref name="Mackenzie 2008 p. 166"/&gt; Later, Bader also wrote the foreword to [[Hans-Ulrich Rudel]]'s biography ''Stuka Pilot''. Even when it emerged that Rudel was a fervent supporter of the [[Nazi Party]], Bader said that prior knowledge would not have changed his mind about his contribution.&lt;ref&gt;Mackenzie 2008, p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1960s, Bader was interviewed on television, where his comments provoked controversy. During the interview, he expressed a desire to be Prime Minister, and listed some controversial proposals should the opportunity ever arise:&lt;ref name="Turner 1995, pp. 231–232"&gt;Turner 1995, pp. 231–232.&lt;/ref&gt;
*  Withdraw sanctions from Rhodesia so negotiations could take place without pressure.&lt;ref name="Turner 1995, pp. 231–232"/&gt;
* Stop immigration into Britain immediately until the "situation had been examined".&lt;ref name="Turner 1995, pp. 231–232"/&gt;
* Reintroduce the death penalty for murder.&lt;ref name="Turner 1995, pp. 231–232"/&gt;
* Ban betting shops, "They breed protection rackets. That's why we're getting like [[Chicago mob|Chicago in the '20s]]".&lt;ref name="Turner 1995, pp. 231–232"/&gt;

Bader was known, at times, to be head-strong, blunt and unsophisticated when he made his opinion known. During one visit to [[Munich]], [[West Germany|Germany]], as a guest of Adolf Galland, he walked into a room full of ex-''Luftwaffe'' pilots and said, "My God, I had no idea we left so many of you bastards alive".&lt;ref name="Mackenzie 2008 p. 166"/&gt; He also used the phrase to describe the [[Trades Union Congress]] during economic and social unrest in the 1970s. Later, he suggested that Britons in support of the [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]] were a "rabble" and should be deported.&lt;ref name="Mackenzie 2008 p. 166"/&gt;

===Personal life===
Bader's first wife, Thelma, developed [[throat cancer]] in 1967. Aware that her survival was unlikely, the two spent as much time with each other as possible. Thelma was a smoker, and although she stopped smoking, it did not save her. After a long battle, she died on 24 January 1971.&lt;ref&gt;Turner 1995, p. 242.&lt;/ref&gt; Bader married Joan Murray (née Hipkiss) on 3 January 1973. They spent the remainder of their lives in the village of [[Marlston]], [[Berkshire]]. Joan was the daughter of a steel tycoon. She had an interest in riding and was a member of the British Limbless Ex-Serviceman's Association. They first met at one of the association's events in 1960. She also helped associations involved in riding for the disabled.&lt;ref&gt;Lucas 1981, p. 276.&lt;/ref&gt;
Bader campaigned vigorously for people with disabilities and set an example of how to overcome a disability. In June 1976, Bader was [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]] for his services to disabled people.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=46919|page=8015 |supp=y|date=4 June 1976}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Actor [[John Mills]] and Air Vice-Marshal [[Neil Cameron, Baron Cameron of Balhousie|Neil Cameron]] attended the ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;Lucas 1981, pp. 279–280.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Turner 1995, p. 229.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other awards followed. Bader maintained his interest in aviation, and in 1977 he was made a [[fellow]] of the [[Royal Aeronautical Society]]. He also received a [[Doctorate of Science]] from [[Queen's University Belfast]]. Bader was also busy acting as a consultant to Aircraft Equipment International at [[Ascot, Berkshire|Ascot]], [[Berkshire]].&lt;ref&gt;Turner 1995, pp. 246–247.&lt;/ref&gt; Bader's health was in decline in the 1970s, and he soon gave up flying altogether. On 4 June 1979, Bader flew his [[Beechcraft Travel Air|Beech 95 Travelair]] {{#tag:ref|Galland had bought one as well.&lt;ref&gt;Baker 1996, pp. 302–303.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=N}} for the last time, the aircraft having being gifted to him on his retirement from Shell. He had recorded 5,744 hours and 25 minutes flying time. Bader's friend Adolf Galland followed Bader into retirement soon afterwards for the same reasons.&lt;ref&gt;Lucas 1981, p. 281.&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1982, he was featured on the [[Thames Television]] ''[[This Is Your Life (UK TV series)|This Is Your Life]]'' series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bigredbook.info/douglas_bader.html |title=Douglas Bader |publisher=Bigredbook.info |date= |accessdate=9 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; His workload was exhausting for a legless man with a worsening heart condition. On 5 September 1982, after a dinner honouring Marshal of the Royal Air Force [[Sir Arthur Harris, 1st Baronet|Sir Arthur "Bomber" Harris]] at the [[Guildhall, London|Guildhall]], at which he spoke, Bader died of a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]] while being driven through [[Chiswick]], west London, on his way home.&lt;ref&gt;Turner 1995, p. 247.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the many dignitaries and personalities at his funeral was Adolf Galland. Galland and Douglas Bader had shared a friendship that spanned more than 42 years since their first meeting in France. Although Galland was on a business trip to [[California]], he made sure to attend the memorial service held for Bader at the [[St Clement Danes]] Church in the [[Strand, London|Strand]]. Peter Tory wrote in his ''London Diary'' newspaper column:&lt;ref name="Toliver and Constable pp193–194"&gt;Toliver and Constable 1999, pp. 193–194.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Certainly Bader, had he been present, would have instantly recognised the stranger in the dark raincoat. Stomping over to his side, he would have banged him on the back and bellowed: "Bloody good show, glad you could come!"|Peter Tory&lt;ref name="Toliver and Constable pp193–194"/&gt;}}

===Tributes===
[[File:Douglas Bader House, Geograph.jpg|left|thumb|Douglas Bader House in Fairford is now the headquarters for the RAF Charitable Trust]]

A biography about Douglas Bader by [[Paul Brickhill]], ''Reach for the Sky'', was published in 1954. Some 172,000 copies were sold in the first few months alone.&lt;ref&gt;Mackenzie 2008, p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt; The initial print run of 300,000 quickly sold out, as the biography became the biggest-selling hardback in post-war Britain. Brickhill had originally offered Bader fifty per cent of all proceeds, sealing the arrangement with a handshake. As sales soared, Bader became concerned that, after tax, he would make very little, and he insisted on a new deal, in writing. So, Brickhill agreed to make him a one-off payment from his company Brickhill Publications Limited of [[£]]13,125, the majority of which would be for  'expenses', and tax-free, with only a small portion for 'services' and therefore taxable (£{{Format price|{{Inflation|UK|10000|1954|r=2}}}} today).&lt;ref&gt;Dando-Collins 2016, p. 278.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Inland Revenue]] subsequently waived any tax liabilities on Bader's earnings.&lt;ref&gt;Saunders 2007, pp. 33–35.&lt;/ref&gt; After film director [[Daniel M. Angel]] bought the film rights and teamed up with [[Lewis Gilbert]] to write the [[screenplay]], Bader came to regret the limiting new deal he had wrung from Brickhill. He was so bitter, he refused to attend the premiere, and only saw the film eleven years later, on television. He never spoke to Brickhill again, and never answered his letters. The [[Reach for the Sky (1956 film)|feature film]] of the same title was released in 1956, starring [[Kenneth More]] as Bader, topping the box office in Britain that year.&lt;ref&gt;Dando-Collins 2016, pp. 303–304.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the 60th anniversary of Bader's last combat sortie, his widow Joan unveiled a statue at [[Goodwood House|Goodwood]], formerly [[RAF Westhampnett]], the aerodrome from which he took off. The 6&amp;nbsp;ft (1.8 m) bronze sculpture, the first such tribute, was created by Kenneth Potts and was commissioned by the [[Earl of March]], who runs the Goodwood estate.&lt;ref&gt;Hunter, Martyn. "Bader in Bronze Graces Goodwood." ''FlyPast'', Issue no. 243, October 2001,  p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mackenzie 2008, p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Douglas Bader Foundation was formed in honour of Bader in 1982 by family and friends—many also former RAF pilots who had flown with Bader during the Second World War.&lt;ref&gt;[http://douglasbaderfoundation.co.uk/about-the-dbf/ "About the DBF."] ''The Douglas Bader Foundation'', 2009.

One of Bader's artificial legs is kept by the RAF Museum at their warehouse in [[Stafford]], and is not on public display.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/stoke/hi/people_and_places/history/newsid_8672000/8672814.stm |title=Nazi treasures uncovered in RAF Stafford collection |publisher=BBC News |date=10 May 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6HVv03zBm?url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/stoke/hi/people_and_places/history/newsid_8672000/8672814.stm |archivedate=20 June 2013 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another was sold at auction in February 2008, along with several other items belonging to the RAF ace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Maynard |first=Geoff |url=http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/35610/115-000-for-Douglas-Bader-s-fake-leg-and-wartime-Treasures |title=£115,000 for Douglas Bader's fake leg and wartime Treasures |work=The Daily Express |date=21 February 2008 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6HVv1rLxO?url=http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/35610/115-000-for-Douglas-Bader-s-fake-leg-and-wartime-Treasures |archivedate=20 June 2013 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Northbrook College|Northbrook College Sussex]] campus at [[Shoreham Airport]] has a building named after him in which aeronautical and automotive engineering are taught. The building was opened by his wife Joan Murray.

The Bader Way, in [[Woodley, Berkshire|Woodley]], [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]] is named after Bader. [[Woodley Airfield]] is where Bader lost his legs in 1931.

Bader Drive, near [[Auckland Airport|Auckland International Airport]], is named in his honour.

A pub at [[Martlesham Heath]], [[Suffolk]], is named after Bader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thedouglasbader.co.uk/website/about-us/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-02-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150227080926/http://www.thedouglasbader.co.uk/website/about-us/ |archivedate=27 February 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[RAF Coltishall]], sold off by the MoD, was purchased privately in 2006 and later renamed Badersfield.

Heyford Park Free School [[Upper Heyford, Oxfordshire|Upper Heyford]] which is located on the former RAF Station Upper Heyford [[US Air Force]] airfield has honoured Bader by using his name for one of the school's houses.  The tie stripe representing Bader is blue.  The other houses are red and yellow. Those houses are named after McGuire and Lynd, two US Air Force pilots who sacrificed themselves when their planes crashed in a nearby village in 1992.

{{Mechanical failure modes}}
In [[materials science]], '''fatigue''' is the weakening of a material caused by repeatedly applied loads. It is the progressive and localized structural damage that occurs when a material is subjected to cyclic loading. The nominal maximum [[stress (physics)|stress]] values that cause such damage may be much less than the strength of the material typically quoted as the [[tensile strength|ultimate tensile stress limit]], or the [[tensile strength|yield stress limit]].

Fatigue occurs when a material is subjected to repeated loading and unloading. If the loads are above a certain threshold, microscopic cracks will begin to form at the stress concentrators such as the surface, persistent slip bands (PSBs), interfaces of constituents in the case of composites, and grain interfaces in the case of metals.&lt;ref name="Laird"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kim |first1=W. H. |last2=Laird |first2=C. |year=1978 |title=Crack nucleation and stage I propagation in high strain fatigue—II. mechanism |journal=Acta Metallurgica |volume=26 |issue=5 |pages=789–799 |doi=10.1016/0001-6160(78)90029-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually a crack will reach a critical size, the crack will propagate suddenly, and the structure will fracture. The shape of the structure will significantly affect the fatigue life; square holes or sharp corners will lead to elevated local stresses where fatigue cracks can initiate. Round holes and smooth transitions or fillets will increase the fatigue strength of the structure.

==Fatigue life==
The [[ASTM International|American Society for Testing and Materials]] defines ''fatigue life'', ''N&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;'', as the number of stress cycles of a specified character that a specimen sustains before [[Structural failure |failure]] of a specified nature occurs.&lt;ref name="Stephens"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Stephens |first1=R. I. |last2=Fuchs |first2=H. O. |year=2001 |title=Metal Fatigue in Engineering |page=69 |edition=2nd |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=978-0-471-51059-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; For some materials, notably [[steel]] and [[titanium]], there is a theoretical value for stress amplitude below which the material will not fail for any number of cycles, called a [[fatigue limit |fatigue limit, endurance limit, or fatigue strength]].&lt;ref name="Bathias"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bathias |first=C. |year=1999 |title=There is no infinite fatigue life in metallic materials |journal=Fatigue &amp; Fracture of Engineering Materials &amp; Structures |volume=22 |issue=7 |pages=559–565 |doi=10.1046/j.1460-2695.1999.00183.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Engineers have used any of three methods to determine the fatigue life of a material: the stress-life method, the strain-life method, and the linear-elastic fracture mechanics method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Shigley |first1=J. E. |last2=Mischke |first2=C. R. |last3=Budynas |first3=R. G. |year=2003 |title=Mechanical Engineering Design |edition=7th |publisher=[[McGraw Hill Higher Education]] |isbn=978-0-07-252036-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; One method to predict fatigue life of materials is the Uniform Material Law (UML).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bäumel |first1=A. Jr. |last2=Seeger |first2=T. |year=1990 |title=Materials Data for Cyclic Loading, Supplement 1 |series=Materials Science Monographs |volume=61 |publisher=Elsevier |isbn=978-0-444-88603-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; UML was developed for fatigue life prediction of [[aluminium]] and titanium alloys by the end of 20th century and extended to [[High-strength low-alloy steel |high-strength steels]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Korkmaz |first=S. |year=2010 |title=Uniform Material Law: Extension to High-Strength Steels |publisher=[[VDM Publishing |VDM]] |isbn=978-3-639-25625-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[cast iron]].&lt;ref name=korkmaz&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Korkmaz |first1=S. |year=2011 |title=A Methodology to Predict Fatigue Life of Cast Iron: Uniform Material Law for Cast Iron |journal=International Journal of Iron and Steel Research |volume=18 |issue=8 |pages=42–45 |doi=10.1016/S1006-706X(11)60102-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics of fatigue==
[[File:Pedalarm Bruch.jpg|thumb|Fracture of an aluminium crank arm. Dark area of striations: slow crack growth. Bright granular area: sudden fracture.]]

* In metal alloys, and for the simplifying case when there are no macroscopic or microscopic discontinuities, the process starts with [[dislocation]] movements at the microscopic level, which eventually form persistent slip bands that become the nucleus of short cracks.
* Macroscopic and microscopic discontinuities (at the crystalline grain scale) as well as component design features which cause stress concentrations (holes, keyways, sharp changes of load direction etc.) are common locations at which the fatigue process begins.
* Fatigue is a process that has a degree of randomness ([[stochastic]]), often showing considerable scatter even in seemingly identical samples in well controlled environments.
* Fatigue is usually associated with tensile stresses but fatigue cracks have been reported due to compressive loads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fleck |first1=N. A. |last2=Shin |first2=C. S. |last3=Smith |first3=R.A. |year=1985 |title=Fatigue Crack Growth Under Compressive Loading |journal=Engineering Fracture Mechanics |volume=21 |issue=1 |pages=173–185 |doi=10.1016/0013-7944(85)90063-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The greater the applied stress range, the shorter the life.
* Fatigue life scatter tends to increase for longer fatigue lives.
* Damage is cumulative. Materials do not recover when rested.
* Fatigue life is influenced by a variety of factors, such as [[temperature]], [[surface finish]], metallurgical microstructure, presence of [[oxidizing]] or [[Chemically inert|inert]] chemicals, [[residual stress]]es, scuffing contact ([[fretting]]), etc.
* Some materials (e.g., some [[steel]] and [[titanium]] alloys) exhibit a theoretical [[fatigue limit]] below which continued loading does not lead to fatigue failure.
* High cycle [[fatigue strength]] (about 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; cycles) can be described by stress-based parameters. A load-controlled servo-hydraulic test rig is commonly used in these tests, with frequencies of around 20&amp;ndash;50&amp;nbsp;Hz. Other sorts of machines&amp;mdash;like resonant magnetic machines&amp;mdash;can also be used, to achieve frequencies up to 250&amp;nbsp;Hz.
* [[Low Cycle Fatigue (LCF)|Low cycle fatigue]] (loading that typically causes failure in less than 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; cycles) is associated with localized plastic behavior in metals; thus, a strain-based parameter should be used for fatigue life prediction in metals. Testing is conducted with constant strain amplitudes typically at 0.01&amp;ndash;5&amp;nbsp;Hz.

==Timeline of fatigue research history==
[[File:Ewing and Humfrey fatigue cracks.JPG|thumb|right|Micrographs showing how surface fatigue cracks grow as material is further cycled. From Ewing &amp; Humfrey, 1903]]

* 1837: [[Wilhelm Albert (engineer)|Wilhelm Albert]] publishes the first article on fatigue. He devised a test machine for [[conveyor]] chains used in the [[Clausthal-Zellerfeld|Clausthal]] [[Mining|mines]].&lt;ref name=schutz&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Schutz |first1=W. |year=1996 |title=A history of fatigue |journal=Engineering Fracture Mechanics |volume=54 |issue=2 |pages=263–300 |doi=10.1016/0013-7944(95)00178-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1839: [[Jean-Victor Poncelet]] describes metals as being 'tired' in his lectures at the military school at [[Metz]].
* 1842: [[William John Macquorn Rankine]] recognises the importance of [[stress concentration]]s in his investigation of [[railroad]] [[axle]] failures. The [[Versailles rail accident|Versailles train wreck]] was caused by fatigue failure of a locomotive axle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rankine |first=W. J. M. |year=1843 |title=On the causes of the unexpected breakage of the journals of railway axles, and on the means of preventing such accidents by observing the law of continuity in their construction |journal=Minutes of the Proceedings of the Institution of Civil Engineers |volume=2 |issue=1843 |pages=105–107 |doi=10.1680/imotp.1843.24600}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1843: Joseph Glynn reports on the fatigue of an axle on a locomotive tender. He identifies the [[keyway (engineering)|keyway]] as the crack origin.
* 1848: The [[Railway Inspectorate]] reports one of the first tyre failures, probably from a rivet hole in tread of railway carriage wheel. It was likely a fatigue failure.
* 1849: [[Eaton Hodgkinson]] is granted a "small sum of money" to report to the [[UK Parliament]] on his work in "ascertaining by direct experiment, the effects of continued changes of load upon iron structures and to what extent they could be loaded without danger to their ultimate security".
* 1854: Braithwaite reports on common service fatigue failures and coins the term ''fatigue''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Braithwaite |first=F. |year=1854 |title=On the fatigue and consequent fracture of metals |journal=Institution of Civil Engineers, Minutes of Proceedings |volume=13 |issue=1854 |pages=463–467 |doi=10.1680/imotp.1854.23960}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1860: Systematic fatigue testing undertaken by Sir [[William Fairbairn]] and [[August Wöhler]].
* 1870: Wöhler summarises his work on railroad axles. He concludes that cyclic stress range is more important than peak stress and introduces the concept of ''endurance limit''.&lt;ref name=schutz/&gt;
* 1903: Sir [[James Alfred Ewing]] demonstrates the origin of fatigue failure in microscopic cracks.
* 1910: [[O. H. Basquin]] proposes a log-log relationship for S-N curves, using Wöhler's test data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Basquin |first=O. H. |year=1910 |title=The exponential law of endurance test |journal=Proceedings of the American Society for Testing and Materials |volume=10 |issue= |pages=625–630}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1940: [[Sidney M. Cadwell]] publishes first rigorous study of fatigue in rubber.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cadwell |first=Sidney |author2=Merrill |author3=Sloman |author4=Yost |title=Dynamic fatigue life of rubber |journal=Rubber Chemistry and Technology |year=1940 |volume=13 |issue=2 |pages=304–315 |doi=10.5254/1.3539515}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1945: [[A. M. Miner]] popularises Palmgren's (1924) linear damage hypothesis as a practical design tool.
* 1952: [[W. Weibull]] An S-N curve model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= |first= |year=1952 |chapter=The statistical aspect of fatigue failure and its consequences |pages=182–196 |editor-last=Murray |editor-first=W. M. |title=Fatigue and Fracture of Metals |publisher=Technology Press of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology/Wiley}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1954: The world's first commercial jetliner, the [[de Havilland Comet]], suffers disaster as three planes break up in mid-air, causing de Havilland and all other manufacturers to redesign high altitude aircraft and in particular replace square apertures like windows with oval ones.
* 1954: [[L. F. Coffin]] and [[S. S. Manson]] explain fatigue crack-growth in terms of [[plasticity (physics)|plastic]] [[Strain (materials science)|strain]] in the tip of cracks.

==High-cycle fatigue==&lt;!-- [[High-cycle fatigue]] redirects here --&gt;
Historically, most attention has focused on situations that require more than 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; cycles to failure where stress is low and primarily [[Elasticity (physics)|elastic]].

===Stress-cycle (S-N) curve===
In high-cycle fatigue situations, materials performance is commonly characterized by an ''S-N curve'', also known as a ''[[August Wöhler|Wöhler]] curve ''. This is a graph of the magnitude of a cyclic stress (''S'') against the [[logarithmic scale]] of cycles to failure (''N'').&lt;ref name="Burhan and Kim"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Burhan |first1= I. and Kim, H.S. |year=2018 |title=S-N curve models for composite materials characterisation: an evaluative review |journal=Journal of Composites Science |volume= 2 |issue= |pages=1–19 |doi=10.3390/jcs2030038}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:BrittleAluminium320MPa S-N Curve.svg|thumb|S-N curve for a brittle aluminium with an ultimate tensile strength of 320 MPa]]
S-N curves are derived from tests on samples of the material to be characterized (often called ''[[Coupon (materials science)|coupons]]'') where a regular [[Sine wave |sinusoid]]al stress is applied by a testing machine which also counts the number of cycles to failure. This process is sometimes known as ''coupon testing''. For greater accuracy but lower generality component testing is used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/596184290 |title=Fatigue testing and analysis of results |last=1887-1979. |first=Weibull, Waloddi, |date=1961 |publisher=Published for Advisory Group for Aeronautical Research and development, North Atlantic Treaty Organization, by Pergamon Press |isbn=9780080093970 |location=Oxford, |oclc=596184290}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each coupon or component test generates a point on the plot though in some cases there is a ''runout'' where the time to failure exceeds that available for the test (see [[censoring (statistics) |censoring]]). Analysis of fatigue data requires techniques from [[statistics]], especially survival analysis and [[linear regression]].

The progression of the ''S-N curve'' can be influenced by many factors such as stress ratio (mean stress), loading frequency, [[temperature]], [[corrosion]], residual stresses, and the presence of notches. A constant fatigue life (CFL) diagram&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kawai |first1=M. |last2=Itoh |first2=N. |year=2014 |title=A failure-mode based anisomorphic constant life diagram for a unidirectional carbon/epoxy laminate under off-axis fatigue loading at room temperature |journal=Journal of Composite Materials |volume=48 |issue=5 |pages=571–592 |doi=10.1177/0021998313476324}}&lt;/ref&gt; is useful for the study of stress ratio effect. The [[Goodman relation |Goodman-Line]] is a method used to estimate the influence of the mean stress on the [[fatigue strength]].

===Probabilistic nature of fatigue===
As coupons sampled from a homogeneous frame will display a variation in their number of cycles to failure, the S-N curve should more properly be a Stress-Cycle-Probability (S-N-P) curve to capture the probability of failure after a given number of cycles of a certain stress. Probability distributions that are common in data analysis and in design against fatigue include the [[log-normal distribution]], [[extreme value theory|extreme value distribution]], [[Birnbaum–Saunders distribution]], and [[Weibull distribution]].

===Complex loadings===
[[File:Rainflow fig2.PNG|thumb|right|Spectrum loading]]

In practice, a mechanical part is exposed to a complex, often [[random]], sequence of loads, large and small. In order to assess the safe life of such a part:
#Complex loading is reduced to a series of simple cyclic loadings using a technique such as [[rainflow-counting algorithm|rainflow analysis]];
#A [[histogram]] of cyclic stress is created from the rainflow analysis to form a [[fatigue damage spectrum]];
#For each stress level, the degree of cumulative damage is calculated from the S-N curve; and
#The effect of the individual contributions are combined using an algorithm such as ''Miner's rule''.

====For multiaxial loading====
Since S-N curves are typically generated for uniaxial loading, some equivalence rule is needed whenever the loading is multiaxial. For simple, proportional loading histories (lateral load in a constant ratio with the axial), [[Sines rule]] may be applied. For more complex situations, such as nonproportional loading, [[critical plane analysis]] must be applied.

===Miner's Rule===
In 1945, [[Milton A. Miner|M. A. Miner]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Rattle of Theta Chi (Stanford 1938) |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WDbPAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA2-PA36&amp;lpg=RA2-PA36&amp;dq=%22milton+a.+miner%22+douglas+aircraft&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=yMivf-zQeK&amp;sig=fwq2b_HhE7Y1ziyVIlSMP5j1GlY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiNoJ7m9drXAhVkyoMKHQmPBwUQ6AEIKjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=%22milton%20a.%20miner%22%20douglas%20aircraft&amp;f=false |accessdate=26 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; popularised a rule that had first been proposed by [[:sv:Arvid Palmgren |A. Palmgren]] in 1924. The rule, variously called ''Miner's rule'' or the ''Palmgren-Miner linear damage hypothesis'', states that where there are ''k'' different stress magnitudes in a spectrum, ''S&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' (1 ≤ ''i'' ≤ ''k''), each contributing ''n&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''(''S&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'') cycles, then if ''N&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''(''S&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'') is the number of cycles to failure of a constant stress reversal ''S&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' (determined by uni-axial fatigue tests), failure occurs when:
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^k \frac {n_i} {N_i}=C &lt;/math&gt;

Usually for design purposes, C is assumed to be 1. This can be thought of as assessing what proportion of life is consumed by a linear combination of stress reversals at varying magnitudes.

Although Miner's rule may be a useful approximation in many circumstances, it has several major limitations:
#It fails to recognise the probabilistic nature of fatigue and there is no simple way to relate life predicted by the rule with the characteristics of a probability distribution. Industry analysts often use design curves, adjusted to account for scatter, to calculate ''N&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''(''S&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'').
#The sequence in which high vs. low stress cycles are applied to a sample in fact affect the fatigue life, for which Miner's Rule does not account. In some circumstances, cycles of low stress followed by high stress cause more damage than would be predicted by the rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Eskandari |first=H. |last2=Kim |first2=H.

High stress followed by low stress may have less damage due to the presence of compressive residual stress.

===Constant Fatigue Life (CFL) diagram and Goodman relation===
A CFL diagram is useful for stress ratio effect on S-N curve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kim |first=H. S. |year=2016 |title=Mechanics of Solids and Fracture |edition=2nd |publisher=Ventus Publishing |isbn=978-87-403-1395-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, in the presence of a steady stress superimposed on the cyclic loading, the [[Goodman relation]] can be used to estimate a failure condition. It plots stress amplitude against mean stress with the fatigue limit and the [[ultimate tensile strength]] of the material as the two extremes. Alternative failure criteria include Soderberg and Gerber.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Beardmore |first=R. |date=13 January 2013 |title=Fatigue Stress Action Types |url=http://www.roymech.co.uk/Useful_Tables/Fatigue/Stress_levels.html |publisher=Roymechx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Paris' Law===
[[File:ParisLaw.png|thumb|Typical fatigue crack growth rate graph]]

In [[Fracture mechanics]], Anderson, Gomez, and Paris derived relationships for the stage II crack growth with cycles N, in terms of the cyclical component Δ''K'' of the [[Stress Intensity Factor]] ''K''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Paris |first1=P. C. |last2=Gomez |first2=M. P. |last3=Anderson |first3=W. E. |year=1961 |title=A rational analytic theory of fatigue |url=http://www.ewp.rpi.edu/hartford/~ernesto/F2012/MEF2/Z-Links/Papers/Paris-Gomez-Anderson1961-A-RationalAnalyticTheory-of-Fatigue.pdf |journal=The Trend in Engineering |volume=13 |issue= |pages=9–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\frac {\mathrm{d}a} {\mathrm{d}N}=C (\Delta K)^m&lt;/math&gt;

where ''a'' is the crack length and ''m'' is typically in the range 3 to 5 (for metals), which states that the rate of crack growth with respect to the cycles of load applied is a function of the stress intensity factor; this is named [[Paris' law]].

This relationship was later modified by Forman in 1967&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kim |first1=S. T. |last2=Tadjiev |first2=D. |last3=Yang |first3=H. T. |year=2006 |title=Fatigue Life Prediction under Random Loading Conditions in 7475-T7351 Aluminum Alloy using the RMS Model |journal=International Journal of Damage Mechanics |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=89–102 |doi=10.1177/1056789506058605}}&lt;/ref&gt; to make better allowance for the mean stress, by introducing a factor depending on (1&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''R'') where ''R''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;min stress/max stress, in the denominator.

===Strain-cycle (ε-N) curve===
Due to the proportionality between stress and strain, high cycle fatigue can also be expressed as strain amplitude vs. number of cycles. High cycle fatigue can be approximated by equating the total strain to just the elastic strain. Using this approximation, {{frac|1|2}}Δε&lt;sub&gt;elastic&lt;/sub&gt; ≡ {{frac|σ&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;'&lt;/sup&gt;|E}}(2''N''&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;−''b''&lt;/sup&gt;

where
:Δε&lt;sub&gt;elastic&lt;/sub&gt; is the change in elastic strain per cycle
:σ&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;'&lt;/sup&gt; is a parameter that scales with tensile strength obtained by fitting experimental data
:''E'' is the Young's modulus
:''N''&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; is the number of cycles to failure
:''b'' is the slope of the log-log curve again determined by fitting

The figure below shows high cycle fatigue as the right-most linear portion. Any test performed in the bottom left region (i.e. with a low enough strain amplitude and number of cycles) below the dark line has a high probability to avoid failure.

[[File:Strain-N.png|thumb|Graph showing fatigue failure as a function of strain amplitude.]]
As shown in the figure above (the left-most linear section) and as described in the next section, the total strain is approximated to be equal to just the plastic strain. For regions between high and low cycle fatigue, an unweighted sum of the high cycle and low cycle expressions gives a reasonable approximation with a built-in safety factor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Courtney |first=T. H. |year=2005 |title=Mechanical Behavior of Materials |pages=578–581 |publisher=Waveland Press |isbn=978-1-57766-425-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Low-cycle fatigue==
{{main|Low-cycle fatigue}}

Where the stress is high enough for [[plasticity (physics)|plastic deformation]] to occur, the accounting of the loading in terms of stress is less useful and the [[Strain (materials science)|strain]] in the material offers a simpler and more accurate description. This type of fatigue is normally experienced by components which undergo a relatively small number of straining cycles. [[Low-cycle fatigue]] is usually characterised by the ''Coffin-Manson relation'' (published independently by [[L. F. Coffin]] in 1954&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Coffin |first=L. F. Jr. |year=1954 |title=A study of the effects of cyclic thermal stresses on a ductile metal |journal=Transactions of the ASME |volume=76 |issue= |pages=931–950}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[S. S. Manson]] in 1953):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Manson |first=S. S. |year=1953 |title=Behavior of materials under conditions of thermal stress |url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19930083626.pdf |publisher=National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics |id=NACA TN-2933}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac {\Delta \varepsilon_p} {2}=\varepsilon_f '(2N)^c&lt;/math&gt;
where,
* Δε&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; /2 is the plastic strain amplitude;
* ε&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;' is an empirical constant known as the ''fatigue ductility coefficient'', the failure strain for a single reversal;
* 2''N'' is the number of reversals to failure (''N'' cycles);
* ''c'' is an empirical constant known as the ''fatigue ductility exponent'', commonly ranging from −0.5 to −0.7 for metals in time independent fatigue. Slopes can be considerably steeper in the presence of creep or environmental interactions.

A similar relationship for materials such as Zirconium is used in the nuclear industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=O'Donnell |first1=W. J. |last2=Langer |first2=B. F. |year=1964 |title=Fatigue Design Basis for Zircaloy Components |journal=Nuclear Science and Engineering |volume=20 |issue=1 |pages=1–12 |doi=10.13182/NSE64-A19269 |via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fatigue and fracture mechanics==
{{see also|Fracture mechanics}}

Fatigue failures, both for high and low cycle, all follow the same basic steps process of crack initiation, stage I crack growth, stage II crack growth, and finally ultimate failure. To begin the process cracks must nucleate within a material. This process can occur either at [[Stress (mechanics)|stress]] risers in metallic samples or at areas with a high void density in polymer samples. These cracks propagate slowly at first during stage I crack growth along crystallographic planes, where shear stresses are highest. Once the cracks reach a critical size they propagate quickly during stage II crack growth in a direction perpendicular to the applied force. These cracks can eventually lead to the ultimate failure of the material, often in a brittle catastrophic fashion.

===Crack initiation===
The formation of initial cracks preceding fatigue failure is a separate process consisting of four discrete steps in metallic samples. The material will develop cell structures and harden in response to the applied load. This causes the amplitude of the applied stress to increase given the new restraints on strain. These newly formed cell structures will eventually break down with the formation of persistent slip bands (PSBs). Slip in the material is localized at these PSBs, and the exaggerated slip can now serve as a stress concentrator for a crack to form. Nucleation of a crack to a detectable size accounts for most of the cracking process. It is for this reason that cyclic fatigue failures seem to occur so suddenly- the bulk of the changes in the material are not visible without destructive testing. Even in normally ductile materials, fatigue failures will resemble sudden brittle failures.

PSB-induced slip planes result in intrusions and extrusions along the surface of a material, often occurring in pairs. This slip is not a [[Microstructure|microstructural]] change within the material, but rather a propagation of dislocations within the material. Instead of a smooth interface, the intrusions and extrusions will cause the surface of the material to resemble the edge of a deck of cards, where not all cards are perfectly aligned. Slip-induced intrusions and extrusions create extremely fine surface structures on the material. With surface structure size inversely related to stress concentration factors, PSB-induced surface slip quickly becomes a perfect place for fractures to initiate.

It should be noted that these steps can be bypassed entirely if the cracks form at a preexisting stress concentrator either from an inclusion in the material or from a geometric stress concentrator such as a sharp corner or small radius. Forming a PSB before failure requires more energy than crack initiation at a preexisting stress concentrator. It is for that reason that part design and material quality must be scrutinized when producing parts that will be subjected to high cycle loading.

==Design against fatigue==
Dependable design against fatigue-failure requires thorough education and supervised experience in [[structural engineering]], [[mechanical engineering]], or [[materials science]]. There are four principal approaches to life assurance for mechanical parts that display increasing degrees of sophistication:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Udomphol |first=T. |year=2007 |title=Fatigue of metals |url=http://www.sut.ac.th/engineering/metal/pdf/MechMet/12_Fatigue%20of%20metals.pdf |page=54 |publisher=Suranaree University of Technology |access-date=2013-01-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130102220804/http://www.sut.ac.th/engineering/metal/pdf/MechMet/12_Fatigue%20of%20metals.pdf |archive-date=2013-01-02 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Design to keep stress below threshold of [[fatigue limit]] (infinite lifetime concept);
# [[Fail-safe]], [[graceful degradation]], and [[fault-tolerant design]]: Instruct the user to replace parts when they fail. Design in such a way that there is no [[single point of failure]], and so that when any one part completely fails, it does not lead to catastrophic failure of the entire system.
#[[Safe-life design]]: Design (conservatively) for a fixed life after which the user is instructed to replace the part with a new one (a so-called ''lifed'' part, finite lifetime concept, or "safe-life" design practice); [[planned obsolescence]] and [[disposable product]] are variants that design for a fixed life after which the user is instructed to replace the entire device;
# [[Damage tolerant design]]: Instruct the user to inspect the part periodically for cracks and to replace the part once a crack exceeds a critical length. This approach usually uses the technologies of [[nondestructive testing]] and requires an [[accuracy|accurate]] prediction of the rate of crack-growth between inspections. The designer sets some [[aircraft maintenance checks]] schedule frequent enough that parts are replaced while the crack is still in the "slow growth" phase. This is often referred to as damage tolerant design or "retirement-for-cause".

===Stopping fatigue===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Manahawkin Bay Bridge]] --&gt;
Fatigue cracks that have begun to propagate can sometimes be stopped by [[drilling]] holes, called ''drill stops'', in the path of the fatigue crack.&lt;ref name="Material Technologies"&gt;{{cite press |date=17 April 2007 |title=Material Technologies, Inc. Completes EFS Inspection of Bridge in New Jersey |url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/material-technologies-inc-completes-efs-inspection-of-bridge-in-new-jersey-58419432.html |publisher=Material Technologies}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is not recommended as a general practice because the hole represents a [[stress concentration]] factor which depends on the size of the hole and geometry, though the hole is typically less of a stress concentration than the removed tip of the crack. The possibility remains of a new crack starting in the side of the hole. It is always far better to replace the cracked part entirely.

===Material change===
Changes in the materials used in parts can also improve fatigue life. For example, parts can be made from better fatigue rated metals. Complete replacement and redesign of parts can also reduce if not eliminate fatigue problems. Thus [[helicopter rotor]] blades and [[Propeller (aircraft)|propeller]]s in metal are being replaced by [[Composite material|composite]] equivalents. They are not only lighter, but also much more resistant to fatigue. They are more expensive, but the extra cost is amply repaid by their greater integrity, since loss of a rotor blade usually leads to total loss of the aircraft. A similar argument has been made for replacement of metal fuselages, wings and tails of aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hoffer |first=W. |date=June 1989 |title=Horrors in the Skies |url=https://books.google.com/?id=BeQDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA67&amp;dq=Popular+Mechanics+Science+installing+linoleum#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true |journal=Popular Mechanics |volume=166 |issue=6 |pages=67–70, 115–117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Peening treatment of welds and metal components===
[[File:Example HiFIT-treated assembly.jpg |thumb |Example of a HFMI treated steel highway bridge to avoid fatigue along the weld transition.]]

Increases in fatigue life and strength are proportionally related to the depth of the compressive residual stresses imparted by surface enhancement processes such as shot peening but particularly by [[laser peening]]. Shot peening imparts compressive residual stresses approximately 0.005 inches deep, laser peening imparts compressive residual stresses from 0.040 to 0.100 inches deep, or deeper. Laser peening provide significant fatigue life extension through shock wave mechanics which plastically deform the surface of the metal component changing the material properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Research (Laser Peening) |url=https://engineering.purdue.edu/LAMPL/research_peening.html |publisher=LAMPL}}&lt;/ref&gt; Laser peening can be applied to existing parts without redesign requirements or incorporated into new designs to allow for lighter materials or thinner designs to achieve comparable engineering results.

===High frequency mechanical impact (HFMI) treatment of welds===
The durability and life of dynamically loaded, welded steel structures are determined often by the welds, particular by the weld transitions. By selective treatment of weld transitions with the [[High Frequency Impact Treatment |High Frequency Mechanical Impact]] (HFMI) treatment method,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Can Yildirim |first1=H. |last2=Marquis |first2=G. B. |year=2012 |title=Fatigue strength improvement factors for high strength steel welded joints treated by high frequency mechanical impact |journal=International Journal of Fatigue |volume=44 |issue= |pages=168–176 |doi=10.1016/j.ijfatigue.2012.05.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Can Yildirim |first1=H. |last2=Marquis |first2=G.

This method is universally applicable, requires only specific equipment and offers high reproducibility and a high degree of quality control.

====Deep Cryogenic treatment====
The use of Deep Cryogenic treatment has been shown to increase resistance to fatigue failure. Springs used in industry, auto racing and firearms have been shown to last up to six times longer when treated. Heat checking, which is a form of thermal cyclic fatigue has been greatly delayed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Search Results for 'fatigue' |url=https://www.cryogenictreatmentdatabase.org/?cat_ID=220&amp;s=fatigue |publisher=Cryogenic Treatment Database |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable fatigue failures==

===Versailles train crash===
[[File:Meudon 1842.jpg|thumb|left Versailles train disaster]]
[[File:Tender fatigued axle.JPG|thumb|right Drawing of a fatigue failure in an axle by Joseph Glynn, 1843]]
{{main|Versailles rail accident}}

Following the [[Louis-Philippe I, King of the French|King Louis-Philippe I]]'s celebrations at the [[Palace of Versailles]], a train returning to Paris crashed in May 1842 at [[Meudon]] after the leading locomotive broke an axle. The carriages behind piled into the wrecked engines and caught fire. At least 55 passengers were killed trapped in the carriages, including the explorer [[Jules Dumont d'Urville]]. This accident is known in France as the "Catastrophe ferroviaire de Meudon". The accident was witnessed by the British locomotive engineer [[Joseph Locke]] and widely reported in Britain. It was discussed extensively by engineers, who sought an explanation.

The derailment had been the result of a broken [[locomotive]] axle. [[William John Macquorn Rankine|Rankine's]] investigation of broken axles in Britain highlighted the importance of stress concentration, and the mechanism of crack growth with repeated loading. His and other papers suggesting a crack growth mechanism through repeated stressing, however, were ignored, and fatigue failures occurred at an ever-increasing rate on the expanding railway system. Other spurious theories seemed to be more acceptable, such as the idea that the metal had somehow "crystallized". The notion was based on the crystalline appearance of the fast fracture region of the crack surface, but ignored the fact that the metal was already highly crystalline.

===de Havilland Comet===
{{Main|BOAC Flight 781|South African Airways Flight 201}}
[[File:Comet 1 G-ALYP - wreckage recovered png.png|thumb|right|The recovered (shaded) parts of the wreckage of ''G-ALYP'' and the site (arrowed) of the failure]]

Two [[de Havilland Comet]] passenger jets broke up in mid-air and crashed within a few months of each other in 1954. As a result, systematic tests were conducted on a [[fuselage]] immersed and pressurised in a water tank. After the equivalent of 3,000 flights, investigators at the [[Royal Aircraft Establishment]] (RAE) were able to conclude that the crash had been due to failure of the pressure cabin at the forward [[Radio direction finder|Automatic Direction Finder]] window in the roof. This 'window' was in fact one of two apertures for the [[Antenna (radio)|aerials]] of an electronic navigation system in which opaque [[fibreglass]] panels took the place of the window 'glass'. The failure was a result of metal fatigue caused by the repeated pressurisation and de-pressurisation of the aircraft cabin. Also, the supports around the windows were riveted, not bonded, as the original specifications for the aircraft had called for. The problem was exacerbated by the punch rivet construction technique employed. Unlike drill riveting, the imperfect nature of the hole created by punch riveting caused manufacturing defect cracks which may have caused the start of fatigue cracks around the rivet.

The Comet's pressure cabin had been designed to a safety factor comfortably in excess of that required by British Civil Airworthiness Requirements (2.5 times the cabin [[proof test]] pressure as opposed to the requirement of 1.33 times and an ultimate load of 2.0 times the cabin pressure) and the accident caused a revision in the estimates of the safe loading strength requirements of airliner pressure cabins.

In addition, it was discovered that the [[stress (physics)|stresses]] around pressure cabin apertures were considerably higher than had been anticipated, especially around sharp-cornered cut-outs, such as windows. As a result, all future [[jet airliner]]s would feature windows with rounded corners, greatly reducing the stress concentration. This was a noticeable distinguishing feature of all later models of the Comet. Investigators from the RAE told a public inquiry that the [[stress concentration|sharp corners]] near the Comets' window openings acted as initiation sites for cracks. The skin of the aircraft was also too thin, and cracks from manufacturing stresses were present at the corners.

===Alexander L. Kielland oil platform capsizing===
[[File:ALK columns fractures english.png|thumb|Fractures on the right side of the Alexander L. Kielland rig]]

The [[Alexander L. Kielland (platform)|''Alexander L. Kielland'']] was a Norwegian [[semi-submersible]] [[drilling rig]] that capsized whilst working in the [[Ekofisk oil field]] in March 1980, killing 123 people. The capsizing was the worst disaster in Norwegian waters since World War II. The rig, located approximately 320&amp;nbsp;km east of [[Dundee]], Scotland, was owned by the Stavanger Drilling Company of Norway and was on hire to the United States company [[Phillips Petroleum]] at the time of the disaster. In driving rain and mist, early in the evening of 27 March 1980 more than 200 men were off duty in the accommodation on the ''Alexander L. Kielland''. The wind was gusting to 40 knots with waves up to 12 m high. The rig had just been winched away from the ''Edda'' production platform. Minutes before 18:30 those on board felt a 'sharp crack' followed by 'some kind of trembling'. Suddenly the rig heeled over 30° and then stabilised. Five of the six anchor cables had broken, with one remaining cable preventing the rig from capsizing. The list continued to increase and at 18:53 the remaining anchor cable snapped and the rig turned upside down.

A year later in March 1981, the investigative report&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Alexander L. Kielland accident, Report of a Norwegian public commission appointed by royal decree of March 28, 1980, presented to the Ministry of Justice and Police March |year=1981 |series=Norwegian Public Reports 1981:11 |publisher=Norwegian Ministry of Justice and Public Security |asin=B0000ED27N}}&lt;/ref&gt; concluded that the rig collapsed owing to a fatigue crack in one of its six bracings (bracing D-6), which connected the collapsed D-leg to the rest of the rig. This was traced to a small 6&amp;nbsp;mm fillet weld which joined a non-load-bearing flange plate to this D-6 bracing. This flange plate held a sonar device used during drilling operations. The poor profile of the fillet weld contributed to a reduction in its fatigue strength. Further, the investigation found considerable amounts of [[lamellar tearing]] in the flange plate and cold cracks in the butt weld. Cold cracks in the welds, increased stress concentrations due to the weakened flange plate, the poor weld profile, and cyclical stresses (which would be common in the [[North Sea]]), seemed to collectively play a role in the rig's collapse.

The '''Grande Prairie Stompede''' is an agricultural event held typically at the end of May every year at Evergreen Park in [[Grande Prairie]], [[Alberta]]. Recent years have seen as many as 50,000 people attending during the 5 days of Stompede. Events held at Stompede include: [[Rodeo]], Pony Chuckwagon Racing, thoroughbred [[Chuckwagon racing|Chuckwagon Racing]] and usually a midway.

Originally called the Grande Prairie Chuckwagon Stompede, the event was first held in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;Logan Clow, [http://www.dailyheraldtribune.com/2015/05/31/thirty-eighth-grande-prairie-stompede-sees-younger-crowds-impresses-founders "Thirty-eighth Grande Prairie Stompede sees younger crowds, impresses founders"], ''[[Grande Prairie Daily Herald-Tribune]]'', May 31, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; By 2014, the event had welcomed its millionth visitor, and reported attendance in excess of 50,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.q99live.com/news/?news_action=view&amp;news_id=3802&amp;ret=%2Findex.php "Millionth Customer Honored at GP Stompede"], [[CIKT-FM]], June 2, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The chuckwagon races are the opening event of the [[World Professional Chuckwagon Association]] season.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.calgarysun.com/2015/05/27/kirk-sutherland-aims-to-win-grande-prairie-stompede "Kirk Sutherland aims to win Grande Prairie Stompede"], ''[[Calgary Sun]]'', May 26, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.calgaryherald.com/sports/Rick+Fraser+wins+WPCA+season+opening+Grande+Prairie+Stompede+title/8468636/story.html "Rick Fraser wins WPCA season-opening Grande Prairie Stompede title"], ''[[Calgary Herald]]'', June 1, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Prince Charles 2012.jpg|thumb|[[Prince Charles]], pictured, was the main subject of this play.]]

'''''Her Royal Highness..?''''' was a comedy/drama play (billed as "an affectionate comedy") by [[Royce Ryton]] and [[Ray Cooney]], who also directed.

==Production==
After opening at the [[Theatre Royal, Lincoln]] in September 1981 and touring to several UK theatres, it transferred to the [[Palace Theatre, London]] in November 1981 where it ran until the end of January 1982. The deliberately cheeky publicity 'strap-line' read "Come and see Her Royal Highness at The Palace".

It starred [[Marc Sinden]], Eva Lohman, [[Rona Anderson]], [[Timothy Carlton]], Morar Kennedy, Gwen Nelson, David Cunningham and [[Tony Steedman]].

Sinden had been cast to play the lead role of [[Prince Charles]] as a result of his portrayal of the same character in the [[Ray Davies|Ray Davies/Kinks]] musical, ''[[Chorus Girls (musical)|Chorus Girls]]'' at the [[Theatre Royal, Stratford East]] earlier in 1981.&lt;ref name="Who's Who 17th"&gt;{{cite book | title = Who's Who in the Theatre 17th edition | year = 2000 | publisher = Who's Who | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The production photographs were taken by [[Patrick Anson, 5th Earl of Lichfield|Lord Patrick Lichfield]], who had taken the photographs of the [[Wedding of Charles, Prince of Wales, and Lady Diana Spencer|real Royal Wedding]] in July of the same year and the lighting was designed by Joe Davis (who had been [[Marlene Dietrich]]'s bespoke theatrical lighting designer).

==Plot==
The plot of the comedy/drama purports to tell the ‘true’ story of [[Diana Spencer]] (played by Eva Lohman) during the week before her wedding to [[Prince Charles]] (played by Marc Sinden).

The young bride-to-be loses her nerve and flees to a secret hideout. However, with all that is at stake, the wedding to Prince Charles must go ahead – a ‘double’ for Diana has to be found and schooled within the week. The best look-alike is found in a shanty town in Australia and during the course of the next week the play charts a course between romantic comedy, thriller and drama, with the 'Diana' stand-in being schooled in all things 'Royal' by the real [[Frances Shand Kydd|Diana's mother]] (Rona Anderson), the [[Elizabeth II|Queen]] (Morar Kennedy) and the [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother|Queen Mother]] (Gwen Nelson) so as to pull-off the charade successfully, while a panicked courtier (Timothy Carlton) and a bemused bodyguard (Tony Steedman) try to pacify Prince Charles and persuade him to go ahead, while trying to keep the secret from a prying press.

According to the play's rights-holder, "Owing to subsequent events in the tragic life of the real Diana, this play is not available for performance at the present time".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.raycooneyplays.plus.com/plays.htm#hrh&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trivia==
The marquee of the Palace Theatre when running this show can be seen in episode 4 of the BBC show ''[[Smiley's People (miniseries)|Smiley's People]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10130">[[File:Trooping the Colour, 1956.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Trooping the Colour]] at Horse Guards Parade in 1956.]]

'''Horse Guards Parade''' is a large [[Military parade|parade ground]] off [[Whitehall]] in [[central London]], at [[British national grid reference system|grid reference]] {{gbmappingsmall|TQ299800}}. It is the site of the annual ceremonies of [[Trooping the Colour]], which commemorates the [[Queen's Official Birthday|monarch's official birthday]], and [[Beating Retreat]].

==History==
[[File:Parade at Horseguards.jpg|thumb|''The Coldstream Guards on Parade at Horse Guards'', by [[John Chapman (painter)|John Chapman]], c. 1755.]]
Horse Guards Parade was formerly the site of the [[Whitehall Palace|Palace of Whitehall]]'s [[tiltyard]], where [[tournament (medieval)|tournament]]s (including [[jousting]]) were held in the time of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]. It was also the scene of annual celebrations of the birthday of Queen [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]]. The area has been used for a variety of reviews, parades and other ceremonies since the 17th century.

It was once the Headquarters of the British Army. [[The Duke of Wellington]] was based in Horse Guards when he was [[Commander-in-Chief]] of the British Army. The current General Officer Commanding London District still occupies the same office and uses the same desk. Wellington also had living quarters within the building, which today are used as offices.

===Car park===
[[File:Horse Guards - London - UK.jpg|thumb|Horse Guards Parade with the [[London Eye]] [[Ferris wheel]] in the background.]]
For much of the late 20th century, Horse Guards Parade was used as a car park for senior [[civil servant]]s; about 500 were granted the privilege, which was known as the 'Great Perk'.&lt;ref name="Perk"&gt;{{cite news|first=Simon|last=Jenkins|authorlink=Simon Jenkins|title=Desperate to guard the perk on the Park|newspaper=The Times|date=4 June 1994|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Provisional IRA|PIRA]]'s [[Downing Street mortar attack|mortar attack on 10 Downing Street]] on 7 February 1991, which was carried out from a vehicle parked in Horse Guards Avenue near to Horse Guards Parade, although producing no casualties, led to concern about security. In April 1993 the Royal Parks Review Group, headed by Dame Jennifer Jenkins, Lady Jenkins of Hillhead, recommended that Horse Guards Parade should be restored for public use, and linked to St James's Park by closing Horse Guards Road.&lt;ref&gt;John Young, "Watchdog deplores traffic disgrace at Buckingham Palace", ''The Times'', 22 April 1993, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; The proposal was taken up by the Department of National Heritage but then resisted by senior Cabinet members, apparently under pressure from the civil servants who were to lose their parking places.&lt;ref&gt;David Lister, "Mandarins say No Minister to traffic ban", ''The Independent'', 2 June 1994, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Public revelation of the resistance led to considerable criticism, with [[Simon Jenkins]] urging the [[Head of the Home Civil Service]], [[Robin Butler, Baron Butler of Brockwell|Sir Robin Butler]], to remove the car park as part of his reforms.&lt;ref name="Perk"/&gt; In late 1996 Horse Guards Parade was cleared in order to be resurfaced. Finally in March 1997 it was announced that car parking on Horse Guards Parade was to be ended.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Hamilton, "Bashed square back on parade fit for a king", ''The Times'', 7 March 1997, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Vehicles are no longer permitted to park anywhere in the area.

==Layout==
The parade ground is open on the west side, where it faces [[Horse Guards Road]] and [[St James's Park]]. It is enclosed to the north by the [[Military citadels under London#Admiralty Citadel|Admiralty Citadel]] and the [[Admiralty#Admiralty Extension|Admiralty Extension building]], to the east by [[Admiralty House, London|Admiralty House]], [[William Kent]]'s [[Horse Guards (building)|Horse Guards]] (formerly the headquarters of the [[British Army]]) and the rear of [[Dover House]] (home of the [[Scotland Office]]), and to the south by Kent's Treasury building (now used by the [[Cabinet Office]]) and the rear garden wall of [[10 Downing Street]] (the official residence of the [[British Prime Minister]]). Access to the south side of Horse Guards Parade is now restricted for security reasons.

* To the north, the [[Royal Naval Division War Memorial]], designed by Sir [[Edwin Lutyens]] in 1925, removed before the Second World War, and returned to its original site beside the Admiralty Extension building and rededicated on "Beaucourt Day" (13 November 2003).
* To the east:
**[[Equestrian statue]]s of Field Marshals [[Frederick Roberts, 1st Earl Roberts|Roberts]] and [[Garnet Joseph Wolseley|Wolseley]] (see [[Equestrian statue of the Earl Roberts, London]] and [[Equestrian statue of the Viscount Wolseley]]).
** A [[Turkey|Turkish]] cannon made in 1524 "by Murad son of Abdullah, chief gunner" which was captured in Egypt in 1801.
** The [[Cádiz Memorial]], a French mortar mounted on a brass monster which commemorates the lifting of the siege of [[Cádiz]] in Spain in 1812.
* To the south, statues of Field Marshal [[Horatio Kitchener|Kitchener]] and of Admiral of the Fleet [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Mountbatten]] (see [[Statue of the Earl Kitchener, London]] and [[Statue of the Earl Mountbatten, London]]).

An oddity is the black background to the number 2 of the double sided clock which overlooks the Parade Ground and the front entrance, it is popularly thought to commemorate the time the last absolute monarch of England, [[Charles I of England|Charles I]], was beheaded at the [[Banqueting House]] opposite.

'''Invisible ink''', also known as '''security ink''', is a substance used for writing, which is invisible either on application or soon thereafter, and can later be made visible by some means. Invisible ink is one form of [[steganography]].

==History==
One of the earliest writers to mention an invisible ink is [[Aeneas Tacticus]], in 4th century BCE. He mentions it in discussing how to survive under siege but does not indicate the type of ink to be used.&lt;ref name="Dooley"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dooley|first1=John F.|title=Review of ''Prisoners, Lovers, and Spies: The Story of Invisible Ink from Herodotus to al-Qaeda'' by Kristie Macrakis|journal=Cryptologia|date=25 July 2015|volume=40|issue=1|pages=107–112|doi=10.1080/01611194.2015.1028684}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was part of his list of the 20 different methods of secret communications&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Codes, Ciphers and Spies: Tales of Military Intelligence in World War I|last=Dooley|first=John|publisher=Copernicus Books|year=2016|isbn=9783319294148|location=New York|pages=210}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a book called ''On the Defense of Fortifications''. One of the techniques that involved steganography involved puncturing a tiny hole above or below letters in a document to spell out a secret message.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Codes: The Guide to Secrecy From Ancient to Modern Times|last=Mollin|first=Richard|publisher=CRC Press|year=2005|isbn=9781584884705|location=Boca Raton, FL|pages=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; This did not include an invisible ink but the Germans improved on the method during [[World War I]] and [[World War II]] and they used invisible ink and microdots instead of pinpricks.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[Philo of Byzantium]] may be the first writer known to describe an invisible ink using a reagent around 280-220 BC, with [[oak galls]] and [[vitriol]].&lt;ref name="Macrakis"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Macrakis|first1=Kristie|title=Prisoners, lovers, &amp; spies : the story of invisible ink from Herodotus to al-Qaeda|date=2014|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|isbn=978-0300179255|pages=11–13|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Yiv4AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA11|accessdate=12 January 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171221020035/https://books.google.com/books?id=Yiv4AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA11|archivedate=21 December 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These ingredients were used to make [[oak gall ink]].&lt;ref name="Wheeler"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wheeler|first1=Jo|first2= Katy|last2= Temple|title=Renaissance secrets, recipes &amp; formulas|date=2009|publisher=Victoria and Albert Museum|location=London|isbn=9781851775774}}&lt;/ref&gt; People soon discovered that they could write invisibly with one of the ingredients and then cause the writing to appear by adding the other.&lt;ref name="Reisert" /&gt;
[[Pliny the Elder]] and the Roman poet [[Ovid]] gave advice on the use of plant juices and milk to write secret messages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Intelligence Digest Supplement|date=1957|publisher=University of Michigan|page=xxvi}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Lemons were also used as organic inks by [[Arabs]] around 600 CE, and during the 16th century in Europe.&lt;ref name="Reisert"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Reisert|first1=Sarah|title=Under Cover of Ink|journal=Distillations|date=2015|volume=1|issue=4|pages=46–47|url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/magazine/under-cover-of-ink|accessdate=23 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Giovanni Battista della Porta]] is credited with the first recipe for a sympathetic ink, derived from [[alum]] and [[vinegar]], as well as the first book on secret writing and invisible inks, ''[[Magia Naturalis]]''(1558, 1589).&lt;ref name="Lukes"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lukes|first1=Igor|title=Book Reviews Prisoners, Lovers, and Spies: The Story of Invisible Ink from Herodotus to al-Qaeda. By Kristie Macrakis. New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 2014. Pp. xiv+377. $27.50.|journal=The Journal of Modern History|date=September 2016|volume=88|issue=3|pages=638–640|doi=10.1086/687421}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Macrakis" /&gt;{{rp|24}} Since then, a wide variety of invisible inks have been used for all sorts of secretive purposes.  A formula similar to oak gall ink was created by [[John Jay]] and used by [[George Washington]] and the [[Culper Spy Ring]] during the [[American Revolution]] and lemon juice was used by the Lemon Juice Spies during World War I.&lt;ref name="Reisert" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Macrakis" /&gt; In World War II, neutral or acidic solutions of [[phenolphthalein]], a chemical compound extracted from pills for [[constipation]], were used as invisible ink.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Chemistry in the Marketplace|last=Selinger|first=Ben|last2=Barrow|first2=Russell|publisher=CSIRO Publishing|year=2017|isbn=9781486303328|location=Clayton, Victoria|pages=297}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is colorless but turns pink when exposed to alkali such as [[ammonia]] and [[Sodium bicarbonate|bicarbonate soda]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== General application and use ==
{{Howto|section|date=January 2011}}
Invisible ink can be applied to a writing surface with a specialty purpose [[stylus]], [[Rubber stamp|stamp]], [[fountain pen]], [[toothpick]], [[calligraphy pen]], or even a finger dipped in the liquid. Once dry, the written surface looks as if it were blank, with a similar texture and reflectivity as the surrounding surface.

The ink can be later made visible by different methods according to the type of invisible ink used. The ink may be revealed by heat or by application of an appropriate chemical, or it may be made visible by viewing under [[ultraviolet light]]. Inks which are developed by a [[chemical reaction]] may depend on an [[acid-base reaction]] (like [[litmus paper]]), reactions similar to the [[blueprint]] process, or any of hundreds of others. Developer fluids may be applied using a spray bottle, but some developers are in the form of vapor, e.g. [[ammonia]] fumes used to develop [[phenolphthalein]] ink.

There are also toy invisible ink pens which have two tips—one tip for invisible ink writing, and another tip for developing the ink. Invisible ink is sometimes used to print parts of pictures or text in [[book]]s for children to play with, always including a "[[decoder pen]]" which is used to show the invisible parts of texts or pictures, thus revealing answers to questions printed in regular ink or completing missing parts of pictures.

Security marker pens or [[UV marker]]s with fluorescent ink that glows when illuminated with a UV light is often used to invisibly mark valuable household items in case of [[burglary]]. There are especially security maker pens formulated for writing on non-porous surfaces such as glass, plastics, metals, etc. The inks that have been applied and can then be identified by using a black light or other UV light source. Security marker pens can be obtained commercially and are widely used as a crime countermeasure.

Some commercially available invisible inks glow very brightly, in a variety of colors, under UV light. This makes them suitable for use in readmission such as hand stamping.

There some invisible ink types that can only be invisible when applied to certain types of surfaces, but are still visible on others.

Some vendors now offer invisible ink for use in computer [[inkjet printer]]s.  Such inks are usually visible under ultraviolet light. Typical uses include printing information on business forms for use by the form processor, without cluttering up the visible contents of the form. For example, some [[United States Postal Service]] mail sorting stations use UV-visible ink to print bar codes on mailed envelopes giving routing information for use by mail handling equipment further down the line before delivery.

Very rarely, invisible ink has been used in art. It is usually developed, though not always. There are artists who use the effect in conjunction with invisible and other reactive inks and paints to create a variety of effects when used in conjunction with UV lights.

An [[End-to-end auditable voting systems|E2E]] voting system called [[Scantegrity II]] uses invisible ink to enable the voter to obtain a confirmation code only for the voted selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Chaum |first=David |authorlink=David_Chaum |author2=Richard Carback |author3=Jeremy Clark |author4=Aleksander Essex |author5=Stefan Popoveniuc |author6=Ronald L. Rivest |author7=Peter Y. A. Ryan |author8=Emily Shen |author9=Alan T. Sherman |title=Scantegrity II: End-to-End Verifiability for Optical Scan Election Systems using Invisible Ink Confirmation Codes |journal=Proceedings of USENIX/ACCURATE EVT |year=2008 |url=http://www.usenix.org/event/evt08/tech/full_papers/chaum/chaum_html/ |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081203123100/http://www.usenix.org/event/evt08/tech/full_papers/chaum/chaum_html/ |archivedate=2008-12-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Properties of an "ideal" invisible ink ==

What an "ideal" invisible ink is depends on its intended use.  For example, property marking should ideally be done with ink easily read under ultraviolet light, whereas in espionage such an ink would be considered too easily detectable since a large number of letters may be screened relatively quickly using UV light.

Invisible inks are inherently "insecure" against a determined and well-equipped inspector, which must be balanced against the logistical difficulty in carrying out mass-screening of posted mail. It is easier to perform [[ECHELON|large-scale]] undetected screening of millions of electronic communications, than to mass-screen even a small fraction of conventional mail. Apart from in dictatorships where large numbers of personnel are employed to spy on fellow nationals, screening of posted mail is only feasible in particular situations, such as letters to and from a particular suspect or facility.

The British [[Special Operations Executive|SOE]] training manual used in the Second World War identified the following properties of an "ideal" invisible ink:

#  Mixes with water.
#  Non-volatile, i.e. no pronounced smell.
#  Not depositing crystals on paper, i.e. not easily seen in glancing light.
#  Invisible under ultraviolet light.
#  Does not decompose or discolor the paper e.g. [[silver nitrate]].
#  Nonreactive with iodine, or with any of the other usual developers.
#  Potential developers for the ink should be as few as possible.
#  Should not develop under heat.
#  Easily obtainable and has at least one plausible innocent use by the holder.
#  Not a compound of several chemicals, as this would violate {{Numero|7}}.

From practical experience "6" and "9" were usually incompatible. [[Special Operations Executive|SOE]] agents were trained not to risk their lives through reliance on insecure inks, most of which were from World War I. In general, [[Special Operations Executive|SOE]] used invisible inks as a back-up method of communication when other, more secure communication techniques were unavailable. The agency was known to supply special inks to its field agents, rather than have them depend upon improvisation from obtainable everyday chemicals. When agents were forced to improvise, they were advised to dilute their invisible ink as much as possible to reduce chances of detection.&lt;ref&gt;SOE Syllabus: Lessons in Ungentlemanly Warfare, World War II (Surrey: Public Record Office, 2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Screening letters for secret messages ==

Any invisible ink can be made visible by someone who is sufficiently determined, but the limitation is generally time available and the fact that one cannot apply hours of effort to every single piece of paper. Thus successful use of invisible ink depends on not arousing suspicion that invisible ink may be present.

Telltale signs of invisible ink, such as pen scratches from a sharp pen, roughness, or changed reflective of the paper (either more dull or more shiny, usually from using undiluted ink), can be obvious to a careful observer who simply makes use of strong light, a magnifying glass and his or her nose. Also, key words in the visible letter, such as "heat" or any other odd code name, in an out of place context may alert a censor to the presence of invisible ink. Invisible ink is not effective with glossy or very smooth paper types, since the [[sizing]] of these papers prevents ink from being absorbed deep into the paper and it is easily visible, especially if the paper is examined under glancing light. There are, however, commercially available inks for non-porous surfaces that are only visible under ultraviolet light and are otherwise virtually invisible on such surfaces.

Using either ultraviolet light or an iodine fume cupboard, messages can be quickly screened for invisible ink and also read without first permanently developing the invisible ink. Thus, if a censor uses this method to intercept messages,  the letter may then be sent to the intended recipient, who will be unaware that the secret message has already been intercepted by a third party.

A "screening station" theoretically could involve visual and olfactory inspection, an examination under ultraviolet light and then the heating of all objects in an oven before finally trying exposure to iodine fumes to produce optimal security in optimal time.

== Invisible ink types ==

For practical reasons, the inks are listed here according to their method of development. It must be understood however that some inks - particularly those of organic origin or those consisting of a mixture of several chemicals - may be made visible by several methods.  For example, invisible writing with soap water may be made visible either by heat, reaction with phenolphthalein, viewing under ultraviolet light, or by placing the page inside an iodine fume cupboard.

=== Inks developed by heat ===
Some of these are organic substances that oxidize when heated, which usually turns them brown. For this type of "heat fixed" ink, any acidic fluid will work. The most secure way to use any of the following substances for invisible ink is by dilution, usually with water, close to the point when they become difficult to develop.

* Cola drink
* Honey solution, sugar solution (sugar turns into [[caramel]] by dehydration)
* Lemon, apple, orange or onion juice (organic acids and the paper forms [[ester]] under heat)
* Milk (lactose dehydrates)
* Bodily fluids such as blood [[Blood plasma|serum]].
* Soap water ([[carboxylate]] partially oxidises)
* Wine, or vinegar
* [[Cobalt(II) chloride|Cobalt chloride]], which turns blue when heated and becomes invisible again after a while (if not overly heated)

The writing is rendered visible by [[heating]] the paper, either on a [[radiator]], by [[ironing]] it, using a hair dryer, or by placing it in an [[oven]]. A 100-watt [[light bulb]] is less likely to damage the paper.

=== Inks developed by chemical reaction ===

In most cases, these substance changes color when mixed with an [[acid]] or [[base (chemistry)|base]].

* [[Phenolphthalein]], commonly used as a [[pH]] indicator, turns pink in the presence of a base such as [[ammonia|ammonia fumes]] or [[sodium carbonate]].
* [[Vinegar]], is revealed by [http://chemistry.about.com/library/weekly/aa012803a.htm red cabbage water]. Vinegar contains [[acetic acid]] that affects the pH indicator in red cabbage water.  Vinegar may also be developed by heat, as above.
* [[Ammonia]], developed by red cabbage water.
* [[Copper sulfate]], developed by [[sodium iodide]], [[sodium carbonate]], [[ammonium hydroxide]] or [[potassium ferricyanide]].
* [[Lead(II) nitrate]], developed by [[sodium iodide]].
* [[Iron(II) sulfate]], developed by [[sodium carbonate]] or [[potassium ferricyanate]].
* [[Cobalt(II) chloride]], developed by [[potassium ferricyanide]].
* [[Iron(III) sulfate]], developed by [[sodium sulfide]].
* [[Starch]], developed by [[iodine]] solution which turns starch dark blue and the paper light blue.
* [[lemon|Lemon juice]], developed by [[iodine]] solution (ink turns white, paper turns light blue).
* [[Sodium chloride]] (common table salt), developed by [[silver nitrate]].
* [[Cerium oxalate]] developed by [[manganese sulfate]] and [[hydrogen peroxide]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2006/11/061108103815.htm |title=Cold War Invisible Ink Secrets Unlocked |publisher=ScienceDaily |date= |accessdate=2014-06-10 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140320203148/https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2006/11/061108103815.htm |archivedate=2014-03-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kristie Macrakis, Elizabeth K. Bell, Dale L. Perry, Ryan D. Sweeder “Invisible Ink Revealed: Concept, Context and Principles of “Cold War” Writing”, Journal of Chemical Education, 89(4) 529-532. (2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Inks visible under ultraviolet light ===

Some inks glow faintly ([[fluorescence|fluoresce]]) when under an [[ultraviolet]] lamp. This is a property of many substances, particularly organic substances and body fluids.

Other inks work in a near opposite way by ''absorbing'' ultraviolet light but without fluoresceing. When these are used on [[fluorescence|fluorescent]] paper, the inked areas fluoresce less than the surrounding paper area when under an ultraviolet lamp. This is especially a property of inks with a yellow tint.

Some UV-visible inks may be detected on a photocopy, due to the relatively strong ultraviolet component in light from the photocopier scanning head.

Examples of inks revealed by ultraviolet light are:

* [[Laundry detergent]]s containing [[optical brightener]]s
* [[Soap]]
* Body fluids, [[Blood plasma|serum]], [[saliva]]
* Sunscreen
* Lemon juice

=== Inks which alter the surface of paper ===

This includes virtually all invisible inks, but pure distilled water can also be used in this way. Application of any fluid will alter the paper surface fibers or sizing.

Fumes created from heating iodine crystals will develop the writing, which will appear brown because the iodine sticks preferentially to the altered areas of the paper. Exposing the paper to strong sunlight will return the writing to its invisible state, as will using a bleach solution.

Slightly dampening paper with a sponge or by steam and then drying it before writing a message will prevent writing from being developed by this method, but overdoing dampening will result in telltale paper cockling.

=== Disappearing inks ===

Inks that are visible for a period of time without the intention of being made visible again are called disappearing inks. Disappearing inks typically rely on the chemical reaction between [[thymolphthalein]] and a basic substance such as [[sodium hydroxide]]. Thymolphthalein, which is normally colorless, turns blue in solution with the base. As the base reacts with carbon dioxide (always present in the air), the pH drops below 10.5 and the color disappears.  Pens are now also available that can be erased simply by swiping a special pen over the original text. Disappearing inks have been used in gag squirtguns, for limited-time secret messages, for security reasons on non-reusable passes, for fraudulent purposes, and for dress-making and other crafts where measurement marks are required to disappear.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cfo.com/article.cfm/3004020/c_3046521?f=magazine_alsoinside Bad Sign] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120403025911/http://www.cfo.com/article.cfm/3004020/c_3046521?f=magazine_alsoinside |date=2012-04-03 }} CFO Magazine, April 1, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tv.com/exhibit-a/schemes-and-dreams/episode/880177/recap.html Exhibit A: Schemes and Dreams Recap] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090115082110/http://www.tv.com/exhibit-a/schemes-and-dreams/episode/880177/recap.html |date=2009-01-15 }} TV.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.joann.com/dritz-quilting-purple-fine-point-disappearing-ink-marking-pen/4792438.html Dritz Quilting Fine Point Disappearing Ink Marking Pen] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161227060720/http://www.joann.com/dritz-quilting-purple-fine-point-disappearing-ink-marking-pen/4792438.html |date=2016-12-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an indication of security, most inks mentioned above were already known by the end of [[World War I]]. However, in 1999, the U.S. [[Central Intelligence Agency]] successfully requested that World War I invisible ink remain exempt from mandatory [[declassification]], based on the claim that invisible ink was still relevant to [[national security]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://fas.org/sgp/news/1999/06/spt062399.html The formula for invisible ink will remain classified] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222120938/https://fas.org/sgp/news/1999/06/spt062399.html |date=2015-12-22 }} St. Petersburg Times, June 23, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; The World War I documents remained classified until 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://articles.latimes.com/2001/jun/13/news/cl-9673 | work=Los Angeles Times | title=The Very Visible Battle Over Invisible Ink | first=Bill | last=Miller | date=2001-06-13 | accessdate=2010-05-02 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100706045432/http://articles.latimes.com/2001/jun/13/news/cl-9673 | archivedate=2010-07-06 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/US/04/19/cia.invisible.ink/ | work=CNN | title=Spy agency reveals invisible ink formula | first=Laurie | last=Ure | date=2011-04-19 | accessdate=2011-04-19 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140110091629/http://www.cnn.com/2011/US/04/19/cia.invisible.ink/ | archivedate=2014-01-10 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''La Imperial''' or '''Ciudad Imperial''' was a city founded by [[Pedro de Valdivia]] on 16 April 1552 and named in honor of the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], then (also) king of Spain. It was abandoned on 5 April 1600 and destroyed as a result of the [[Mapuche Uprising of 1598]] during the [[War of Arauco]]. The ruins ('old city') were called '''Antigua Imperial'''. A city was refounded there in 1882 under the name [[Carahue]].

== Ecclesiastical history ==
* Established on 1563.05.22 as '''Diocese of La Imperial''' (Spanish) / Civitatis Imperialis (Latin, actually corresponding to 'Ciudad Imperial') on territory split off (with border at the river [[Maule River|Maule]]) from the only two year older [[Diocese of Santiago de Chile]] (now Metropolitan, in the Chilean national capital) as [[Suffragan]] of the ([[Peru]]vian) [[Archdiocese of Lima]] 
* Suppressed in 1603, as the city was destroyed in 1600, its territory being reassigned to establish (at present [[Penco]]) the then [[Diocese of Concepción]] (now Metropolitan).

;''Suffragan bishops of La Imperial
* Antonio de San Miguel Avendaño y Paz, [[Friars Minor]] (O.F.M.) (1563.03.22 – 1588.03.09), next Bishop of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Quito|Quito]] ([[Ecuador]]) (1588.03.09 – death 1590.11.07)
* Agustín de Cisneros Montesa (1589.03.09 – death 1596)
* Reginaldo de Lizárraga, [[Dominican Order]] (O.P.) (Spaniard) (1598.08.31 – 1603), next first Bishop of successor see [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Concepción|Concepción]] (Chile) (1603 – 1609.07.20), Bishop of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Paraguay|Paraguay]] (Paraguay) (1609.07.20 – 1609.11.10).

=== Titular see ===
The diocese was nominally restored in 2000 as Latin [[Titular bishopric]] of La Imperial (Spanish) / Civitatis Imperialis (Latin)&lt;ref&gt;''Annuario Pontificio 2013'' (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 2013 {{ISBN|978-88-209-9070-1}}), p. 912&lt;/ref&gt;

It has had the following incumbents, so far of the fitting Episcopal (lowest) rank :
* [[Ricardo Ezzati Andrello]], [[Salesians]] (S.D.B.) (Italian) (10 July 2001 - 27 Dec 2006) as [[Auxiliary Bishop]] of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Santiago de Chile|Archdiocese of Santiago de Chile]] (Chile) (2001.07.10 – 2006.12.27); previously Bishop of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Valdivia (Chile) (1996.06.28 – 2001.07.10); later Metropolitan Archbishop of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Concepción|Concepción]] (Chile) (2006.12.27 – 2010.12.15), President of Episcopal Conference of Chile (2010.11 – 2016.11.11), Metropolitan Archbishop of above Santiago (de Chile) (2010.12.15 – ...), created [[Cardinal-Priest]] of [[SS.

The '''Leeuwin Estate Concert Series''' are annual open-air events featuring international and Australian performers at [[Leeuwin Estate|Leeuwin Estate Winery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Santich |first=Barbara |url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0D12FC3B550C778EDDAF0894D9404482 |title=NYTimes - Choice Tables |location=Australia; Margaret River (Australia) |publisher=Select.nytimes.com |date=24 June 2001 |accessdate=2010-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The first concert was a performance from the [[London Philharmonic Orchestra]] in 1985, with the Australian tour underwritten by Leeuwin Estate owners Denis and Tricia Horgan on the condition that the orchestra play at Leeuwin Estate.&lt;ref name=MRW&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.margaretriverwine.org.au/leeuwin.html |title=Leeuwin |publisher=Margaret River Wine |date= |accessdate=2010-11-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110221112647/http://www.margaretriverwine.org.au/leeuwin.html |archivedate=21 February 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/01/02/dining/from-a-granite-coast-velvet-wines.html?pagewanted=1 |title=From a Granite Coast, Velvet Wines |publisher=NYTimes |date=2 January 2002 |accessdate=2010-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/news/entertainment/music/vine-romance-artists-line-up-for-picnic-gigs/2008/11/28/1227491821734.html |title=Vine romance: artists line up for picnic gigs |publisher=Brisbane Times |date= |accessdate=2010-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hosting the concert was considered a risk due to the physically remote location of the [[Margaret River]], being 260 kilometres from the state capital of [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]]. Friends tried to talk the Horgans out of the idea,&lt;ref name=MRW /&gt; but they went ahead and the concert was a great success, with 5000 people attending and the event attracting international coverage.&lt;ref name=NYT /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=John Mariani - 23 November 2009 00:01 EST |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=aya.T3PIHWMA |title=Rhone Ranger’s Vinthology, Winemakers’ Profiles: Holiday Books |publisher=Bloomberg |date=23 November 2009 |accessdate=2010-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next two concerts also featured orchestras, with the [[Berlin Staatskapelle]] performing in 1986 and the [[Royal Danish Orchestra]] in 1987.&lt;ref name=Hist /&gt; In 1989 the series featured its first individual star, when the [[Chicago Symphony Orchestra]] could not attend and instead [[Ray Charles]] was brought in to perform with the [[West Australian Symphony Orchestra]].&lt;ref name=MRW /&gt; The West Australian Symphony Orchestra has featured eight further times since accompanying other musicians.&lt;ref name=Hist /&gt;

In 1990 Leeuwin Estate hosted [[Dame Kiri Te Kanawa]], with other stars [[Diana Ross]] and [[Tom Jones (singer)|Tom Jones]] performing in 1992 and 1993 respectively. 1993 also saw the first iteration of the "Australian Family Concert" series featuring Australian performers at a separate event each year.&lt;ref name=Hist /&gt;

In February 2005, a concert was performed by [[Sting (musician)|Sting]] that drew an audience of 6,000 and raised over $4 million for the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami]] relief efforts after Sting had to cancel a scheduled concert in Sri Lanka due to the disaster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/Music/Sting-concert-raises-4m-for-tsunami/2005/02/11/1108061853169.html |title=Sting Concert Raises 4m for Tsunami |publisher=SMH |date=11 February 2005 |accessdate=2010-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/australia/wa/bunbury/200502/s1295113.htm |title=Sting's special gig for tsunami victims |publisher=ABC |date=3 February 2005 |accessdate=2010-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4160707.stm |title=BBC - Willie Nelson stages Tsunami gig |publisher=BBC News |date=10 January 2005 |accessdate=2010-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 26th year of the series in 2010 saw [[Boz Scaggs]] &amp; [[Michael McDonald (singer)|Michael McDonald]] perform in front of a sold out crowd of 6500 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://au.news.yahoo.com/thewest/entertainment/a/-/entertainment/6803538/the-leeuwin-concert-michael-mcdonald-and-boz-scaggs/ |title=Yahoo Entertainment - The Leeuwin Concert - Michael McDonald and Boz Scaggs |publisher=Au.news.yahoo.com |date=15 February 2010 |accessdate=2010-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Paddenburg |first=Trevor |url=http://www.perthnow.com.au/entertainment/all-walks-of-life-lured-to-leeuwin/story-e6frg30c-1225830081478 |title=All walks of life lured to Leeuwin |publisher=Perth Now |date=13 February 2010 |accessdate=2010-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a list of Democratic party unpledged delegates, also known as [[superdelegate]]s or automatic delegates,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; who voted in the [[2008 Democratic National Convention]], the culmination of the Party's presidential nominating process that began with the [[Democratic Party (United States) presidential primaries, 2008|2008 Democratic Party presidential primaries]] and caucuses.

At the time of [[Hillary Clinton]]'s campaign suspension on June 7, 2008, the count was 246½ for her and 478 for [[Barack Obama]],&lt;ref name="demconwatch1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://demconwatch.blogspot.com/2008/02/superdelegates-by-position.html |title=Superdelegates by Position |publisher=2008 Democratic Convention Watch |date=2008-06-07 |accessdate=2008-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; with 99 still 'Uncommitted'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://demconwatch.blogspot.com/2008/06/silent-superdelegates.html |title=The Silent Superdelegates |publisher=2008 Democratic Convention Watch |date=2008-06-06 |accessdate=2008-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the 823½ total then existing, although this number represents the realignment of around 50 superdelegates who switched their support from Clinton to Obama when he had gained the majority of delegates. Clinton released her delegates during the convention.

The breakdown by position for Clinton was 144 DNC, 52½ Representatives, 14 Senators, 17 Add-ons, 10½ Governors, and 7½ DPLs;
the breakdown by position for Obama was 229 DNC, 157 Representatives, 34 Senators, 29 Add-ons, 20 Governors, and 9 DPLs;
and the breakdown for "Uncommitted" was: 39 DNC, 22 Representatives, 1.5 Senators, 32.5 Add-ons, 1 Governor, and 3 DPLs.&lt;ref name="demconwatch1"/&gt;

==Composition==
The Democratic Party's official rules do not use the term "superdelegate." This is an informal name for about 20% of all delegates, whose status as delegates is independent of primary and caucus results and who are officially unpledged to any candidate.  About half of the superdelegates are current Democratic elected officials - Governors, U.S. Senators and Representatives. The other half consists of other party leaders.

The following totals reflect the fact that superdelegates from Florida and Michigan will be seated at the convention, but with only one-half vote each, because of their states' [[Democratic Party (United States) presidential primaries, 2008#Nullified primaries|violations of scheduling rules]].

===Unpledged party leaders and elected officials===
The formal description (in Rule 9.A) is "unpledged party leader and elected official delegates" (Unpledged PLEOs).&lt;ref name="Dem rules"&gt;{{cite web|last=Democratic National Committee |authorlink=Democratic National Committee |title=Delegate Selection Rules for the 2008 Democratic National Convention |date=June 12, 2007 |url=http://www.democrats.org/page/-/pdf/DelegateSelectionRules.pdf |accessdate=2008-02-08 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081203153151/http://www.democrats.org/page/-/pdf/DelegateSelectionRules.pdf |archivedate=December 3, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*19.5 votes from 20 Distinguished Party Leaders (DPL). Officially there are 23 delegates in this category,&lt;ref name="Dem call"/&gt; but this includes sitting elected officials (2 Senators and 1 Governor), who are here counted in those categories. Former party Chairman [[Kenneth M. Curtis]] (FL) has 0.5 vote.
*31.5 votes from 32 Democratic [[Governor#United States|Governors]]. This category includes 28 state Governors, the Mayor of DC, and 3 Governors of [[Territories of the United States|Territories]]. Michigan Gov. [[Jennifer Granholm]] has 0.5 vote.
*49.5 votes from 51 members of the [[United States Senate|Senate]]. This category includes 49 U.S. Senators and the 2 [[Shadow congressperson|Shadow Senators]] from DC. The 3 Senators from Michigan and Florida have only 0.5 vote each.
*231.5 votes from 238 members of the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]. This category includes 234 Representatives from the states, and 4 [[Delegate (United States Congress)|Congressional Delegates]] from DC and from the [[Territories of the United States|Territories]]. The 15 Michigan and Florida Representatives have only 0.5 vote each.
*413 votes from 432 [[Democratic National Committee]] Members. A total of 38 DNC delegates (12 from Florida, 18 from Michigan, and 8 representing [[Democrats Abroad]]) have only 0.5 vote each.

The PLEOs listed above currently represent a total of 745 votes. However, that tally is subject to change as events affect individual delegates. For example, the count has decreased due to the death of Rep. [[Tom Lantos]]; the loss of one half of [[Kenneth M. Curtis|Ken Curtis']] vote because of his current residency in Florida;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20070619044406/http://ellsworthmaine.com/site/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=13090&amp;Itemid=31 Two of Maine’s Super Delegates Are Ineligible], ''The Ellsworth American'', 27 February 2008&lt;/ref&gt; the resignation of [[Eliot Spitzer]] as Governor of New York (his replacement, [[David Paterson]], was already a superdelegate as a DNC member); and the resignation of Representative [[Albert Wynn]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://clerk.house.gov/member_info/vacancies_pr.html?pr=house&amp;vid=15 Current Vacancies], Office of the Clerk, U.S. House of Representatives, 1 June 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The count has increased because of the special-election victories of Reps. [[Bill Foster (Illinois politician)|Bill Foster]] (IL-14), [[André Carson]] (IN-7), [[Jackie Speier]] (CA-12), [[Don Cazayoux]] (LA-6), [[Travis Childers]] (MS-1), and [[Donna Edwards]] (MD-4). A more complete history of superdelegate composition changes is provided in a later section.

Finally, note that the tallies here reflect eligibility only; the final, official vote tally will be determined solely by the number of eligible delegates who actually participate in the national convention.

Unpledged PLEO delegates should not be confused with pledged PLEOs.  Under Rule 9.C, the pledged PLEO slots are allocated to candidates based on the results of the primaries and caucuses.&lt;ref name="Dem rules"/&gt;

===Unpledged add-ons===
Under Rule 9.B, each state party selects one or more "unpledged add-on delegates," intended for other elected officials and party leaders not included in the above groups.&lt;ref name="Dem rules"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TerryMichael"&gt;Terry Michael, [http://terrymichael.net/PDF%20Files/DNC_PrezNomProcess.pdf The Democratic Party's Presidential Nominating Process] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080528190503/http://terrymichael.net/PDF%20Files/DNC_PrezNomProcess.pdf |date=2008-05-28 }}. March, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; There are 76 such slots, which are filled according to Democratic Party rules;&lt;ref name="Dem call"&gt;{{cite web|last=Democratic National Committee |authorlink=Democratic National Committee |title=Call for the 2008 Democratic National Convention |url=http://www.democrats.org/page/-/pdf/FINAL2008CalltotheConvention.pdf |date=March 2000 |accessdate=2008-03-24 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608011743/http://www.democrats.org/page/-/pdf/FINAL2008CalltotheConvention.pdf |archivedate=2011-06-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in practice, it is usually the chairperson of the state Democratic Party who appoints the add-ons, effectively allowing the state chairs to multiply their vote.&lt;ref name="ap-moresuper"&gt;[http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2008/04/04/some_superdelegates_more_super_than_rest/?page=full AP: Some superdelegates more super than rest]&lt;/ref&gt; The formal selection of add-ons is performed at the state party's convention or at a state executive committee meeting. All 76 add-ons are scheduled to be identified by 21 June 2008.&lt;ref name="demconwatch-addon"&gt;[http://demconwatch.blogspot.com/2008/03/add-on-superdelegate-selection-schedule.html DemConWatch Add-On Schedule and Tracker]&lt;/ref&gt;

¹ For purposes of this list members of Congress and governors are counted in that category even if they are also members of the DNC or are a ''Distinguished Party Leader'' (DPL).  The DNC, however, considers such delegates to be DNC members or DPL's first.  The following members of Congress and governors are either DNC members or are DPL's:  Reps. Joe Baca, Mike Honda, Eddie Bernice Johnson, Carolyn Cheeks Kilpatrick, Gregory Meeks, Nancy Pelosi, and Maxine Waters. Sens. Robert Byrd (DPL), Chris Dodd (DPL), Harry Reid, and Debbie Stabenow.  Govs. Tim Kaine, Joe Manchin, Ruth Ann Minner, David Paterson, and Ed Rendell (DPL). Florida and Michigan delegations not yet updated to reflect full votes.

² Includes former presidents, former vice presidents, former house and senate leaders, and former party chairs.

====Notes====
&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt; Democrats Abroad superdelegates have ½ vote. [Florida and Michigan delegations not yet un-marked.]

↔ Gov. Ed Rendell (PA), Sen. Robert Byrd (WV), and Sen. Chris Dodd (CT) are credentialed by the DNC as Distinguished Party Leaders&lt;ref name="DNC"&gt;[http://www.democrats.org/a/convention_2008/delegate/ Unpledged Party Leader and Official Delegates] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080220012147/http://www.democrats.org/a/convention_2008/delegate/ |date=2008-02-20 }}, Democratic National Committee, 13 February 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

↓ Rep. Brad Ellsworth (IN) has committed to vote for Clinton in deference to their constituents' votes in the state primaries.  They explicitly distinguish this from an "endorsement" and have not personally endorsed either candidate.

Ж Commit Date is the actual date of commitment or earliest instance of public support.  For reasons of file size management, candidate-by-candidate citations may not be provided.  The best source of this information is from the press releases and blog entries of the candidate websites: hillaryclinton.com and barackobama.com. January 20, 2007 is the date Senator Hillary Clinton opened her exploratory committee for the Presidential Democratic nomination and is thus considered the first date that a superdelegate can endorse her. February 10, 2007 is the date Senator Barack Obama announced his candidacy for the Presidential Democratic nomination and is thus considered the first date that a superdelegate can endorse him.

† The "Pelosi Club" is an informal name for a group of superdelegates who announced their intention to vote for the candidate who won the absolute majority of pledged delegates(Barack Obama). The group is named for its first two members, House Speaker Rep. Nancy Pelosi (CA) and her daughter Christine Pelosi (CA DNC), who announced their intention on March 30. The group prominently includes Former President Jimmy Carter (GA DPL, announced May 1); other members are Sen. Maria Cantwell (WA), Denise Johnson (TX; April 6), and Rep. Chris Van Hollen (MD, May 24).&lt;ref name="PelosiClub"/&gt; Somewhat confusingly, Sen. Cantwell is on record endorsing Clinton, but she has vowed to vote for the pledged delegate leader. [Note: Please do *not* move these delegates to Obama's column without a specific endorsement first since it is only a conditional pledge, per DCW May 20 update.]

There are also 'former members' of the Pelosi Club. All of the following have since gone on to become outright Obama delegates, and are listed here together with the date they were recognized as such: Former DNC Chair Roy Romer (CO DPL, May 13). Rep. Zoe Lofgren (CA, May 22), former Sen. Tom Daschle (SD DPL, May 22), Rep. Robert Wexler (FL, May 22), and charter Pelosi Club member Betty Richie (TX DNC, May 29).&lt;ref name="PelosiClub"/&gt;

'''Mha Pujā''' ([[Devanagari]]: म्हपुजा) is an annual ritual performed by the [[Newar]] people of [[Nepal]] to purify and empower the soul as part of New Year celebrations. It is performed on New Year's Day of [[Nepal Sambat]], the national lunar calendar of Nepal, which occurs during the [[Swanti (festival)|Swanti festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last= Dhaubhadel |first= Manoranjan N.|title= Mha Puja -- A Unique Newah Tradition |url= http://www.noa-fl.org/resources/NOA-FL_Newsletter_Vol1_Year1.pdf |accessdate=12 October 2013|newspaper= NOA-FL Newsletter |publisher= NOA Florida Chapter |date= 17 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mha Puja means "worship of the self", and it celebrates the spirit within oneself. The ceremony signifies an auspicious beginning of the New Year, and invokes prosperity and longevity for the participant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Maharjan|first=Ujjwala|title=Cultural symbolisms in Mha Puja|url=http://archives.myrepublica.com/portal/index.php?action=news_details&amp;news_id=24968|accessdate=21 November 2012|newspaper=Republica|date=5 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=|first=|title=Mha Puja today, Nepal Sambat 1132 being observed|url=http://www.ekantipur.com/2011/10/27/top-story/mha-puja-today-nepal-sambat-1132-being-observed/342845.html|accessdate=21 November 2012 |newspaper=Ekantipur |date=27 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mha Puja and Nepal Sambat are also celebrated abroad where Nepalese have settled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ppguk.org/Activities-/-Events/ppguk-recent-activites.html|title=Mha Puja 2012 &amp; New Year Nepal Samvat 1133 Celebration|last=|first=|date=2012|website=Pasa Puchah Guthi UK|publisher=|accessdate=15 October 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130720024545/http://www.ppguk.org/Activities-/-Events/ppguk-recent-activites.html|archivedate=20 July 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The ceremony==

A row of [[mandala]]s (sandpainting of a sacred circular diagram) are drawn on the floor for each member of the family. Extra mandalas are drawn at the end of the row for the two messengers of death. Mandalas are also drawn for essential household items like water pitcher, winnowing tray and broom. The mandala is worshipped by making offerings of ritual food, sacred thread, colored paste, incense, lighted wicks and flowers.

Family members then sit cross-legged in front of one's mandala, and the lady of the household walks down the row putting a dab of colored paste on their forehead. She then presents each member an extra long burning wick (khelu itāh खेलु इता:) which is placed next to the mandala. She also gives them sacred threads (kwakha क्वखा) and a basket of fruits including [[citron]] (tahsibwa त:सिब्व) symbolizing long life and good fortune.

The next part of the ceremony is [[Sagan (ceremony)|Sagan Biyegu]] (सगं बियेगु). One of the women walks down the line holding a clay pot containing [[Dhau]] ([[yogurt]]) from which everybody takes a dab and puts it on one's temple. The participants are then presented a set of auspicious ritual food consisting of boiled egg, smoked fish and [[rice wine]]. The rice wine is poured in a little bowl and refilled three times, until when the bowl must be held in the hand and not set down.

The worship of the mandala is the principal ritual during Mha Puja. The mandala represents the universe, and the wick and incense stick which are lighted during the ceremony means that the participant should spread brightness and fragrance for others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Maharjan|first=Ujjwala|title=Cultural symbolisms in Mha Puja|url=http://archives.myrepublica.com/portal/index.php?action=news_details&amp;news_id=24968|accessdate=21 November 2012|newspaper=Republica|date=5 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mha Puja is a revered custom among Newars, and is observed outside Nepal too.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newah.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=165:noalc-celebrate-mha-puja-2012&amp;catid=28:press-releases&amp;Itemid=43 |title=NOALC Celebrate Mha Puja 2012 |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |year=2012 |website= |publisher=Newah Organization of America |accessdate=10 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ppguk.org/Activities-/-Events/ppguk-recent-activites.html |title=Mha Puja 2012 &amp; New Year Nepal Samvat 1133 Celebration |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=18 November 2012 |website= |publisher=Pasa Puchah Guthi UK |accessdate= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130720024545/http://www.ppguk.org/Activities-/-Events/ppguk-recent-activites.html |archivedate=20 July 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The mandala==

The mandala is a [[sandpainting]] made with powdered limestone. The Mha Puja mandala is drawn in the shape of an eight-petalled [[Nelumbo nucifera|lotus]] inside a circle marked with water. It can be drawn freehand or by using a stencil or mould. At the center of the mandala, a small circle is drawn with mustard oil. This is surrounded by concentric rings marked with red rice, black lentil, black soybean, unhusked rice and puffed rice as per family tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bajracharya |first=Chunda |title=Newah Tajilajii Nakhah Chakhah |url= |accessdate= |year=2000 |publisher=Nepal Bhasa Academy |location=Kathmandu |isbn= |page=145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The items used to adorn the mandala symbolize good fortune, long life and freedom from perils. The mandala has been interpreted as a microcosmic and macrocosmic representation of the self.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=van den Hoek |first=A.

==The feast==
[[File:Mhapuja bhoy.jpg|thumb|200px|Bronze dinner plate with initial servings]]
At the end of the ceremony, the family members partake of a feast. The bronze plate containing auspicious food items is placed on one's mandala, destroying the painstakingly made and decorated design to signify worldly impermanence.

The main menu consists of a set of eight items representing the [[Matrikas|Astha Matrika]], the eight grandmother goddesses who are worshipped as protectors. They are known as [[Ajima]] in [[Nepal Bhasa]]. The arrangement of the food on the plate also represents a mandala, with a mound of [[Baji (food)|beaten rice]] at the center surrounded by portions of eight side dishes. In addition, other food items are served to make a sumptuous feast. After dinner, the plates and leftover food are left as they are overnight. The floor is swept clean the next day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bajracharya |first=Chunda |title=Newah Tajilajii Nakhah Chakhah |url= |accessdate= |year=2000 |publisher=Nepal Bhasa Academy |location=Kathmandu |isbn= |page=148}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, 3 Mongolian [[Members of Parliament]] passed a law on the establishment of State Flag Day. As a result, State Flag Day was celebrated for the first time on July 10 the following year.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.news.mn/mobile/102732?id=102732&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2018-07/10/c_137314558.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary of the Military Parade==
The annual military parade [[Mongolian Armed Forces]] on the southern part of [[Sükhbaatar Square]] is the main event during State Flag Day. The parade has been held since 2009, and is presided by the [[President of Mongolia]] in his/her capacity as Commander in Chief of the MAF. 

The ceremonies begin as the president steps out of the [[Government Palace (Mongolia)|Government Palace]] to be received at the saluting base by the Speaker of the State Great Khural, the Prime Minister, the Minister of Defense, as well as members of the government and the General Staff of the Mongolian Armed Forces. As the President receives the salute, then a car carrying a color guard from the [[National Defense University (Mongolia)|National Defense University]] takes its place in the parade to the tune of a slow march. After a fanfare by the combined massed bands of the [[Ulaanbaatar]] garrison provided by the [[Military Band of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Mongolia]] and the Brass Band of the [[Military Music College of Mongolia]] of the NDU, the Minister of Defense arrives in the center of the square to receive the report from the Chief of the General Staff of the MAF, on the status of the parade and its readiness for inspection. As the Minister's vehicle pass the mobile column of the parade he/she greets the formations and congratulates them on the holiday. Once the minister and the parade commander finish their inspection, the minister's vehicle heads to the saluting base to greet the president and give his/her ceremonial report on the parade's readiness to march off. Following this, the [[National Anthem of Mongolia]] is played by the band as the national flag is raised.

Following a threefold [[Oorah (Marines)|Urra]] by the armed forces, the parade commander orders the parade formations to stand [[at attention]] and to move their colours and commanders to the front of their formation for the march past. Once the commander orders the parade to march in quick time with the command ''Eyes on the right, quick march!'', the Corps of Drums of the [[Military Music College of Mongolia|Military Music College]], march to a tune being played by the drummers and fifers. By the signal of the Corps Drum Major, massed bands start playing and the corps stops and swings its drumsticks while their eyes are on the right.

The Corps of Drums are then immediately followed by cadets from the NDU, who are then followed by the parade formations participating in the parade, ending with the [[Mongolian State Honor Guard]] Battalion.

The '''Nag Hammadi massacre''' was a [[massacre]] of [[Copts|Coptic]] Christians carried out on the eve of 7 January 2010, in the [[Egypt]]ian city of [[Nag Hammadi]]. The massacre occurred at the hands of [[Muslim]] gunmen in front of the Nag Hammadi cathedral, as Coptic Christians were leaving the church after celebrating the midnight [[Christmas]] mass.

==Background==
{{Modern persecution of Coptic Christians}}
Coptic Christians form the largest religious minority in the Egypt, and represent between 15% and 20% of a population of over 80 million Egyptians. Estimates of the size of Egypt's Christian population vary from the low government figures of 6 to 7 million to the 15 to 19 million reported by Christian leaders,&lt;ref&gt;Ibrahim, Youssef M. "[https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/15/world/muslims-fury-falls-on-egypt-s-christians.html Muslims' Fury Falls on Egypt's Christians]". ''[[The New York Times]]'', 15 March 1993. Retrieved 10 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="U.S.Dept of State/Egypt"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/5309.htm|title= Egypt from "U.S. Department of State/Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs"|date=30 September 2008 |publisher= [[United States Department of State]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FCO/Egypt/"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/about-the-fco/country-profiles/middle-east-north-africa/egypt|title=Egypt from "Foreign and Commonwealth Office"|date=15 August 2008|publisher=[[Foreign and Commonwealth Office|Foreign and Commonwealth Office -UK Ministry of Foreign Affairs]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6CI40kVBk?url=http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/travel-and-living-abroad/travel-advice-by-country/country-profile/middle-east-north-africa/egypt|archivedate=19 November 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LOOKLEX Encyclopedia/Egypt/Religions&amp;Peoples"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lexicorient.com/e.o/egypt_4.htm|title=Egypt Religions &amp; Peoples from "LOOKLEX Encyclopedia"|date=30 September 2008|publisher= LookLex Ltd.}}&lt;/ref&gt; though estimates vary (see [[Religion in Egypt]]). The Coptic community has been targeted by terrorism throughout the past by Islamic extremists, and has faced varying degrees of discriminatory government policies, such as restrictions on building churches and a school curriculum focused on [[Islam]].&lt;ref name=bbccata/&gt; Since the 1970s, the rise of [[Islamist]] movements in Egypt has led to [[sectarian violence]]. Disputes over land and inter-faith relationships have sometimes split communities along religious lines, and [[civil rights]] groups have criticized local authorities' handling of such cases. Police have been accused of delaying their response to reports of fighting and then simply arresting more Christians than Muslims. Criminal investigations are occasionally discontinued in favor of informal reconciliation meetings.&lt;ref name=bbccata&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/8478397.stm Egypt's anxious Copts 'await next catastrophe'], BBC&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifex.org/egypt/2010/01/20/activists_charged |title=International Freedom of Expression eXchange |publisher=Ifex.org |date= |accessdate=2011-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="catastrophe"&gt;{{cite news | title=Egypt's anxious Copts 'await next catastrophe' | date=2010-01-25 | publisher=BBC News | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/8478397.stm | accessdate = 2010-03-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other forms of anti-Christian discrimination in Egypt include discrimination in hiring in the public sector and staff appointments to public universities, prohibition from studying at [[Al-Azhar University]] (a publicly funded institution with approximately half a million students), and barring from certain jobs such as Arabic language teachers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=John Pike |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/egypt/copt.htm |title=Coptic Christianity |publisher=Globalsecurity.org |date= |accessdate=2011-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Events==
Bishop Kyrillos (Cyril), the [[Coptic Orthodox Church|Coptic Orthodox]] bishop of Nag Hammadi, had warned the Egyptian police that there had been threats in the days leading up to the [[Christmas Eve]] service. For this reason, he decided to end his mass one hour earlier than normal. He told the [[Associated Press]] that, for days, he had expected something to happen on Christmas Eve. He said he left the church minutes before the attack, and had to take the back door when a suspiciously driven car swerved near him. Seconds later he heard the mayhem, lots of machine-gun shots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/8445838.stm |title=Clashes in Egyptian town after Coptic killings |publisher=BBC News |date=2010-01-07 |accessdate=2011-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the Christian worshipers were leaving the Nag Hammadi Cathedral after the Christmas Eve service, a car pulled up and gunfire was sprayed into the crowd. As a result, eight Copts, all aged between 15 and 23, were killed. Six died immediately, while two more died the following day from severe wounds.&lt;ref name="wordpress1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://besara7a.wordpress.com/2010/01/06/%D9%85%D8%B3%D9%84%D9%85%D9%8A%D9%86-%D9%8A%D9%82%D8%AA%D9%84%D9%88%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D9%82%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%B7-%D9%84%D9%8A%D9%84%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D9%8A%D8%AF-%D9%81%D9%89-%D9%86%D8%AC/ |title=Muslims kill Christians on Christmas Eve At Nag Hammadi |publisher=Besara7a.wordpress.com |date= |accessdate=2011-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wordpress2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://justaq.wordpress.com/category/%D8%AA%D8%B5%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%AD%D8%A7%D8%AA/ |title=تصريحات " مجرد سؤال ؟ |publisher=Justaq.wordpress.com |date= |accessdate=2011-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; One Muslim bystander was also killed in the attack.&lt;ref name="BBC.Egypt"&gt;{{cite news | title=Egypt Copts killed in Christmas church attack | date=2010-01-07 | publisher=BBC News | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/8444851.stm | accessdate = 2010-03-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.themajlis.org/2010/01/08/egypt-arrests-nag-hammadi-shooters Egypt arrests Nag Hammadi shooters], Gregg Carlstrom | 8 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Nine other Copts were confirmed wounded, and two Muslims were reportedly wounded in the attack.

==Aftermath==

On 6 January 2010, three men from the [[Berbers|Berber]] tribe of Al-Hawara were arrested and charged with premeditated murder in association with the Nag Hammadi massacre.&lt;ref name="Church attack spark riots"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.arabnews.com/node/332420 |title=Church attack spark riots |publisher=Arab news |date=8 January 2010 |accessdate=10 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The three accused were Mohamed Ahmed Hassanein, more commonly known as Hamam el-Kamouny, Qurshi Abul Haggag and Hendawi Sayyed. The trial opened on 13 February 2010. Despite initially confessing to the police, they pleaded not guilty to the charges of premeditated murder, putting lives of citizens at risk, and damaging property.&lt;ref name='bbc-adj'&gt;{{cite news | title=Egyptian Coptic murder trial opens and is adjourned | date=2010-02-14 | publisher=BBC News | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/8514705.stm | accessdate = 2010-03-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Supreme State Security Court (Egypt)|Supreme State Security Court]] adjourned the trial until 20 March 2010, and the trial was subsequently delayed twelve times. The accused men appeared in court for the final verdict on 16 January 2011. El-Kamouny received a death sentence for the "premeditated murder" of seven people, as well as for the "attempted murder" of the nine others who were wounded.&lt;ref name='NYTimes'&gt;{{cite news | title=Egypt Sentences Muslim to Death in Killings of Christians | date=2011-01-16 | publisher=NYTimes | url =https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/17/world/middleeast/17egypt.html?ref=middleeast | accessdate = 2011-01-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The other two defendants were sentenced on 20 February 2011.&lt;ref name='AlJazeera'&gt;{{cite news | title=Egypt attacker gets death sentence | date=2011-01-16 | publisher=AlJazeera News | url =http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2011/01/2011116114813218283.html | accessdate = 2011-01-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Motives==
Egyptian officials suspected that the shooting may have been "in revenge for the alleged rape of a 12-year-old girl from the Berber tribe of Al-Hawara by a Coptic man" in the nearby town of [[Farshout]] in November, which at the time led to five days of riots and attacks on Christian businesses and properties in [[Upper Egypt]].&lt;ref name="BBC.Egypt"/&gt; A man was arrested and charged with the alleged rape on 21 November 2009.&lt;ref name='tdne'&gt;{{cite news | first=Essam | last=Fadl | title=Lawyer of alleged Coptic rapist requests trial transfer | date=2010-02-09 | publisher=The Daily News Egypt | url =http://www.thedailynewsegypt.com/lawyer-of-alleged-coptic-rapist-requests-trial-transfer.html | accessdate = 2010-03-08 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Church attack spark riots"/&gt;

==Egyptian reaction==
Following the Nag Hammadi massacre and the associated attacks, the Egyptian police raided the homes of Coptic Christian families in Nag Hammadi on 10 January 2010, and arrested 22 young Copts, most of whom were teenagers. These Copts were detained at the Nag Hammadi police station for a few days, then transferred to jail in the isolated [[New Valley Governorate]]. None of the arrested Copts was ever formally charged with any crime.&lt;ref name="wordpress2"/&gt;

It was not until two weeks after the massacre that President [[Hosni Mubarak]] made his first remarks directly condemning what happened. He stated that "The criminal act in Nag Hammadi has made the hearts of Egyptians bleed, whether Copts or Muslims".&lt;ref name="catastrophe"/&gt;

The Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights (EIPR) condemned the attack, stating that despite warnings by local church authorities of possible violence during the Coptic holiday, police had not increased security for Christmas.&lt;ref name="catastrophe"/&gt;

On 9 January 2010, hundreds of people in [[Cairo]] demonstrated, carrying placards condemning "the shocking silence of the authorities" and stating "We are All Copts". On the same day, Egyptian police arrested 20 people who demonstrated in the town of Bahgura against the Nag Hammadi massacre.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

On 15 January, 29 Egyptian human rights activists, bloggers, and members of political parties visited Nag Hammadi in order to show solidarity with the Coptic community against the recent attacks on Coptic civilians. All 29 activists were arrested by Egyptian police while on their way to pay their condolences to the families of the victims. The group included prominent activists such as [[Wael Abbas]], members of [[6 April Youth Movement]], and members of the [[Democratic Front Party]]. The group included eight women, one of whom was a [[France|French]] citizen. The activists were detained and interrogated by the prosecutor of the [[Qena Governorate]]. A number of them were charged with demonstrating illegally, chanting slogans against the state, and causing disorder. Group members denied these allegations, stating that Egyptian police arrested them when they arrived at the train station, and that the group had not had time to engage in any activities.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/en/news/2010/01/15/egypt-free-activists-detained-solidarity-visit |title=Human Rights Watch |publisher=Hrw.org |date=2010-01-16 |accessdate=2011-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International reaction==

The Nag Hammadi massacre gained widespread international attention, and was condemned by [[Pope Benedict XVI]],&lt;ref name="google1"/&gt; [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] MP [[Nadim Gemayel]],&lt;ref name="nadimgemayel1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lebanese-forces1"/&gt; [[Italy|Italian]] foreign minister [[Franco Frattini]],&lt;ref name="frat"/&gt;&lt;ref name="allvoices1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="freecopts1"/&gt; and [[Canada|Canadian]] foreign minister [[Lawrence Cannon]].&lt;ref name="international1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Vladtepesblog.com"/&gt;

The actions of the Egyptian government in the aftermath of the crime were also strongly condemned by Sarah Leah Whitson, the [[Middle East]] director of [[Human Rights Watch]]. "The Egyptian authorities should be focusing on the causes of the tragic shooting of six Coptic Christians," she stated. "Instead, they're arresting activists whose efforts to express their condolences is an important step toward healing sectarian fractures."&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt;

'''Netherworld Haunted House''' is a self-guided, walk-through [[haunted attraction (simulated)|haunted attraction]] located near [[Atlanta, Georgia]].  It is a seasonal [[Halloween]]-based event which opened in 1997.

Netherworld is distinguished by having developed an original theme which was not based on popular movies, such as slasher films, but rather on a unique storyline. It operates during October of each year.

==History==
[[File:The_Collector_an_Icon_character_from_Netherworld_Haunted_House.jpg|thumb|right|The Collector is an icon character at '''Netherworld Haunted House''' in [[Norcross, GA]].]]
Beginning in 1997, there was only a single haunted house.  A second smaller haunt was added in 1999, featuring a [[Three-dimensional space|3-D]] [[ChromaDepth]] experience. This coincided with a move to the Georgia Antique Center in Norcross, GA. In 2000, a third event was added at a remote location for one year, called Bloodfeast, a replica of a Medieval Torture Chamber. This event can now be seen every Spring at the [[Georgia Renaissance Festival]].  In 2003 Netherworld expanded with a third attraction that was located one floor below the larger one. It began as Tomb of Darkness, a very dark show, and slowly evolved into a more gory reality based event when compared with the traditional gothic horror elements of the upstairs haunt. In 2007 The 3-D Show and the Main show were combined in Leviathan, and a new introductory section and gift shop were added.

As of 2016, Netherworld Haunted Attractions LLC announced that they would be moving the entire attraction to Stone Mountain, Georgia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.bizjournals.com/atlanta/news/2016/10/24/netherworld-haunted-house-moving-haunts-to-stone.html|title= Netherworld Haunted House moving haunts to Stone Mountain|last= Wenk |first= Amy|date= October 24, 2016|website= |publisher= Atlanta Business Chronicle|access-date= October 20, 2017|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://buzz.blog.ajc.com/2017/05/24/netherworld/&lt;/ref&gt;  This move was announced in 2016, and as of 2017, the new location was open featuring three indoor "escape games" (escape rooms).  In 2017, the main haunted houses remained at the Norcross location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.escapethenetherworld.com/|title= Escape the Netherworld|last= |first= |date= 2017|website= |publisher= Netherworld LLC|access-date= October 21, 2017|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the 2017 season ended, Netherworld packed up over 20 years of props and monsters and moved to its new location at 2076 West Park Place Boulevard in Stone Mountain, GA.

==Attractions==
The current haunted attractions, as of 2018, are "The Awakened" and "Subject: UNKNOWN", which are both indoor haunted houses. In addition, the company is running ''Escape the Netherworld'', three escape room games, at their new location in Stone Mountain. The themes of the escapes rooms are Sasquatch, Nosferatu, and The Haunted. 

Netherworld has always created original monsters and props, rather than utilizing movie or television intellectual properties, as many other haunted attractions customarily do. Netherworld is known for its elaborate sets, innovative special effects, lighting and sound. Some of the actors perform stunts such as bungee jumps and sliding toward guests.  A number of actors also stalk the queue line and Midway before the haunted house actually begins, starting the experience the moment guests get out of their cars. This is a somewhat different take on "scare zones", which are utilized by the larger theme parks.

==Media and awards==

The 2009 Movie [[Zombieland]] had portions filmed inside of Netherworld, and members of the Netherworld crew participated in the films production. [[Rob Zombie]]'s HALLOWEEN 2 2009 film also rented props from the event and used Haunted House staff. Many Netherworld crew are now involved with production of the AMC TV series, [[The Walking Dead (TV series)|The Walking Dead]].  Several key staff are members of the Special Effects Makeup and Costuming unions.

Netherworld won the #1 haunted house in America for 2017, according to Hauntworld.com, in their selection of the top 13 scariest haunted houses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.hauntedhouseassociation.org/|title=Top 50 Rated Best and Scariest Haunted Houses in America 2017 |last= |first= |date= October 4, 2017|website= |publisher= Haunted House Association|access-date= October 26, 2017|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The North Carolina State Fair was first held by the North Carolina State Agricultural Society at a site east of Raleigh in 1853. The event has been held at three different locations since, finding its current home in 1928. It has been celebrated continuously since 1853, with the exceptions of 1861 to 1869 (during the Civil War and [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]]), 1926 to 1927 (when the Agricultural Society disbanded and the state Agriculture Department took over operations), and 1942 to 1945 (during [[World War II]]). In the 1870s and 1880s, the mills in [[Winston-Salem]] would close so that workers could attend the state fair in Raleigh.&lt;ref name="winston-salem book"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WFIg7mDiPlEC |publisher=''[[NYU Press]]'' |date=1997 |title=From Congregation Town to Industrial City |first=Michael |last=Shirley |page=211}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fair has been held at its present site on the western edge of Raleigh since 1928. The 344 acre site includes many notable buildings, including [[Dorton Arena]], a 7,500-seat arena constructed with a unique large suspended roof.

Held for 11 days in mid-October, the fair attracts more than a million people to the N.C. State Fairgrounds in Raleigh. In 2010, the fair broke an attendance record with 1,091,887.&lt;ref name="NC State Fair website"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ncstatefair.org/2010/About/Attendance.htm |title=About Us: Attendance|publisher=N.C.

Along with Dorton Arena, the '''North Carolina State Fair Commercial &amp; Education Buildings''' are listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].  The pair of large rectangular exhibition halls were built in 1928, and are [[stucco]]-covered [[Mediterranean Revival architecture|Mediterranean Revival]] style buildings.  The buildings appear as a single building because of their unified facade and design, but are a large rectangular complex of two buildings, 504 feet in length and 80 feet in depth.  They feature twin, tower-flanked entrances and glazed [[terra cotta]] ornamentation.&lt;ref name = nrhpinv&gt;{{Cite web |first1=Davyd|last1=Foard Hood|first2=Jim|last2=Sumner |title=North Carolina State Fair Commercial &amp; Education Buildings |work=National Register of Historic Places - Nomination and Inventory |date=January 1987 |url=http://www.hpo.ncdcr.gov/nr/WA4968.pdf |format=pdf |publisher=North Carolina State Historic Preservation Office |accessdate=July 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Accidents and incidents===
On October 24, 2013 five people (between the ages of 14 and 39 years old) were injured on the ''"Vortex"'' ride when the ride started up again as people were attempting to get off the ride. All were taken to [[WakeMed|WakeMed hospital]] in [[Raleigh, North Carolina|Raleigh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=5 injured on 'Vortex' ride at NC State Fair |url=http://www.wral.com/5-injured-on-vortex-ride-at-nc-state-fair/13035196/ |publisher=WRAL TV |accessdate=July 7, 2017|date=October 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 29, 2013 the operator of the ride, Timothy Dwayne Tutterow, was charged with three felony counts of [[assault with a deadly weapon]], for inflicting serious bodily injury in connection with the accident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=North Carolina State Fair ride operator in court |url=http://abc11.com/archive/9303376/ |publisher=ABC 11 |accessdate=July 7, 2017|date=October 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2015, Tutterow pleaded guilty, but has not been sentenced as part of a plea arrangement to testify against the ride owner, Joshua Gene Macaroni. On February 19, 2016, Macaroni was sentenced to 30 days in jail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vortex ride owner gets 30 days in jail for NC State Fair accident|url=http://www.newsobserver.com/news/local/crime/article61321992.html|publisher=Raleigh News &amp; Observer|accessdate=July 7, 2017|date=February 26, 2016|first=Anne|last=Blythe}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exhibits==

===Antique Farm Machinery===

The Antique Farm Machinery exhibit, located near the [[Village of Yesteryear]] displays a collection of vintage farm tools including traditional spinning wheels, horse-pulled tobacco and cotton pickers and planters, and aged hand reapers.  The exhibit also features an old milk bottle display, and Model-T engine and more than a dozen Allis-Chalmers, Farmall, John Deere and Silver King tractors from the 1930s through the 1950s.

===Cultivate a Career Tent===

This exhibit replaced the Green NC exhibit during its debut in 2011. In the exhibit, visitors can go on a fun and interactive career personality scavenger hunt to learn about the wide variety of career paths in the agricultural industry.

===Field of Dreams===

This exhibit takes children through the growing and harvesting process, going from farm to table. Visitors to Field of Dreams can get a basket at the exhibit entrance and pick crops such as apples, strawberries and cucumbers. Along the way, they learn about other crops and how they turn into everyday staples, such as peanut butter and cereal. After picking the crops, children can then "sell" their harvest at the Field of Dreams Farmers Market for fair money. The money can then be spent at the Field of Dreams Grocery Store.

====Flower and Garden Show====
This oasis on the fairgrounds features winding pathways through beautiful gardens grown by local organizations. More than 90 demonstrations are held throughout the fair, with experts offering advice on such topics as pumpkin carving, flower arranging and proper plant care.

===Got to Be NC Agriculture Tent===

If you want the best, it's "Got to Be NC." In this exhibit, visitors can discover and sample food products from across North Carolina. More than 20 local vendors participate in the exhibit throughout the course of the fair.

===Heritage Circle===

Heritage Circle is a step back in time. There is plenty of activity at the circle, from the crew maintaining the tobacco barn during the fair to the craftsmen demonstrating their traditional methods of woodcarving, blacksmithing and chair-building. Visitors can also enjoy the taste of homemade ice cream, apple cider or a hush puppy from the Old Grist Mill as they listen to engaging stories or the sweet melodies from the Bluegrass Stage.

===State Fair Ark===

Fairgoers can see cattle, sheep, goats, swine and learn more about the various breeds of farm animals raised in North Carolina. More than 60 animals are on display, including the grand and reserve champions from the junior market steer, lamb, goat, turkey and barrow shows.

===Village of Yesteryear===

One of the N.C. State Fair's most popular and enduring attractions, the Village of Yesteryear features more than 75 artists and crafters creating, displaying and selling time-honored handmade crafts. Village crafters spin wool into yarn, weave yarn into cloth, make rugs, turn pottery, carve wooden bowls and utensils, make split-oak baskets and more. Native American crafts such as hand-coiled pottery, beadwork and stone carving are also featured. Kids and kids-at-heart can even make their own dolls or stuffed toy to take home.

==Competitions==

===General Exhibits===
Division I competitions cover a variety of general topics including wine, cheese and butter, agronomy, forage crops, flower show, horticulture, arts and photography, and bees and honey.

===Livestock===
Division II premium book competitions cover all livestock categories, except for poultry and rabbits. The categories are dairy cattle, beef cattle, special shows, swine, meat sheep, dairy goats, pygmy goats, wool sheep and meat goats.

===Poultry &amp; Rabbits===
Division III competitions cover poultry and domestic rabbit competitions. The winners of the rabbit competitions are on display in the Rabbit Barn during the State Fair.

===Family &amp; Consumer Sciences===
Division IV categories include family and consumer sciences, such as culinary, specialty cooking contest, clothing and home furnishings. The division also houses all the 4-H competitions.

===Special Exhibits===
Division V competitions are made up of special exhibits on the fair. These include the Folk Festival, Department of Labor apprentice contest, horseshoe pitching contest, handicrafts and hobbies, and the essay contest.

====Folk Festival====
The Folk Festival was first held at the N.C. State Fair in 1948 to showcase North Carolina's traditional music and dance. More than 1,500 people participate each year for the coveted Bascom Lamar Lunsford Trophy. The trophy was named after the festival founder.

===Horses===
In addition to the N.C. State Fair, the fairgrounds is also host for the N.C. State Fair Horse Show and Hunter Jumper Show, which runs before, during and after the N.C. State Fair. The competition features thousands of horses and is open to the public.

==Entertainment==

===Fireworks===
Fireworks are shot off nightly at 9:45&amp;nbsp;p.m. For years, the fireworks were shot off from the lake across from Gate 8. In 2011, the fireworks were shot off from a new location across the street from the fairgrounds. The new location offers additional safety, frees traffic congestion and offers a spectacular panoramic view above the Midway.

===Free Entertainment===
The N.C. State Fair offers plenty of free entertainment for the price of admission ticket. There are roaming ground entertainers across the fairgrounds, staged entertainment acts in Kiddieland Fun Park and outside the Expo Center, as well as continuous musical performances on the Bluegrass and Waterfall stages.

===Grandstand Shows===
The Sam Rand Grandstand is home to several special events during the N.C. State Fair. The grandstand is the site of the annual Tractor Pull and Demolition Derby. In addition, there are performances by Keith King and the King Action Sports Stunt Show. The stunt show includes freestyle, flatlander, ramp riders, inline skaters, skateboarders and Motocross.

===Kiddieland Fun Park===
Kiddieland Fun Park, located near Gate 1, is nestled under the trees near the Kiddieland carnival area. This section of the N.C. State Fair caters to children with entertaining shows, rides and attractions, plus space to take a break from the Midway.

===Carnival Rides and Games===
[[File:NC state fair 2015.jpg|thumb|People walk around the 2015 fair midway]]
The N.C. State Fair has the largest [[Midway (fair)|midway]] at any state fair.

Rides require tickets; some cost two to three tickets, while the wilder ones are five to six tickets.

In 2006, [[Powers Great American Midways]], based out of [[Burgaw, North Carolina]] (corporate office is in [[Corfu, New York]]) won the midway contract for the fair.&lt;ref name="CONTACT"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.powersmidways.com/pages/contact.html|title=Powers Great American Midways: Contact Us at Powers Great American Midways|publisher=Powers Great American Midways|accessdate=July 7, 2017|website=powersmidways.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company provides more than 100 rides each year, as well as carnival games and concession stands on the midway.

Since then, Powers Great American Midways has made steps to create an eco-friendly midway. These steps including the addition of LED lighting on nearly all the rides and using B20, a soybean-based biodiesel, to power all of the generators.

In 2011, Powers unveiled the refurbished SkyDiver, which is similar to a Ferris wheel in shape. The difference is that passengers ride in cages and can spin the cages in a barrel roll fashion. The 90-foot-tall ride was completely overhauled with a spectacular lighting display composed of about 100,000 energy-efficient LED lights.

====Roller coasters====
In 2008, Susan Ogden of Raleigh helped name the Pinfarri RC-48 roller coaster when it premiered on the midway. The Toxic Shock is a blue and orange roller coaster that is known for twists and banked curves.

=====The Ride=====

The train makes a loose turn out of the station and up a steep {{convert|70|ft|m|adj=on}} lift hill. It then proceeds down a banked twisting drop and into the first of three over-banked curves. At the base of the third over-banked curve, the track stays moderately banked and around a 3.0 g helix. The track levels and pulls into the station.

Another roller coaster, the Avalanche, is milder. The car pulls out of the station and around a 180-degree right turn onto the lift. The car ascends the {{convert|50|ft|m|adj=on}} lift and around another 180 turn to the right. The car then descends a {{convert|40|ft|m|adj=on}} drop, reaching 54&amp;nbsp;mph before climbing {{convert|40|ft|m}} into the first banked curve. Around that and down a second {{convert|20|ft|m|adj=on}} drop that then takes you back up into the spiral, banking more heavily as you descend. You are warned about high g forces here but there are no strong g forces on this ride.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} When you finally exit the spiral, you descend a small dip and pull into the station.

=====The State Fair Flyer=====

The State Fair added a new way to get around in 2016 when they built the State Fair Flyer, a 40 foot high sky lift that has 126 seats that hang from a cable that stretches more than 1,400 feet across the fairgrounds. American Sky Lifts, based in Sanford, owns and built the massive machine at a cost of $1 million. A one-way trip on the State Fair Flyer costs $5, a round-trip ride is $8. The ride moves at 2&amp;nbsp;mph and has a lap restraint to keep passengers in their seat. American Sky Lifts has a 10-year lease to have the lift on the fairgrounds with an option for a 10-year renewal.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wral.com/-new-state-fair-flyer-offers-one-heck-of-a-view-/16017955/

The '''Persio Flacco''' is an active opera and theater stage in [[Volterra]], Italy.

==History==
[[Volterra]] still lacked a proper indoor performance stage in the early nineteenth century. In 1816 a group of citizens, including cavaliere Bartolommeo Falchi, cavaliere Mario Maffei, Luigi Ducci, Francesco Cinci, and Luigi Campani, commissioned the architect [[Luigi Campani]] (an architect of the [[Grand Duke Ferdinand III of Tuscany]]). The theater was erected on the site of the palazzo belonging to Marchesi Incontri. Work began in 1816 and the theater was inaugurated in 1820.

===Description===
The main curtain (''sipario'') was painted by [[Nicola Contestabili]], who represented [[Aulus Persius Flaccus]], a Roman satirist and playwright born in Volerra, being led by the muses to the summit of [[Mount Parnassus|Parnassus]], ruled by Apollo. This gave the theater its final name. The ceiling over the seats was painted with ''Venus in a chariot drawn by swans'', and the parapets, with cupids, garlands and vignettes, harmonizing with the curtain. All these beautiful decorations were lost with subsequent restorations.

===Ongoing care===
In 1820, a group of 60 prominent citizens formed the ''Academy of the Riuniti'' (of the reunited), and purchased the entire theater, assigning to each member property of the individual boxes and seats, and this organization has continuously maintained that theatrical activity.

The theater was closed for physical repairs for 15 years, from 1984 to 1999, before the reopening,  members donated their ownerships of seats and boxes to the Academy. This availed them of funds to pursue reconstruction.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7395">[[File:Image943-knee mount.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[knee-on-stomach position]] compresses the chest, making it difficult for the person on the bottom to [[breath]]e.]]
'''Positional asphyxia''', also known as '''postural asphyxia''', is a form of [[asphyxia]] which occurs when someone's [[human positions|position]] prevents the person from [[breath]]ing adequately. Positional asphyxia may be a factor in a significant number of people who die suddenly during restraint by [[police]], [[prison]] (corrections) officers, military or [[health care]] staff.&lt;ref name="dt"&gt;Reay, D.T. (1996) 'Suspect Restraint and Sudden Death.' Law Enforcement Bulletin. Quantico, Virginia: Federal Bureau of Investigation.&lt;/ref&gt; Positional asphyxia is also a common cause of death in [[infant]]s.

* Positional asphyxia is a potential danger of some physical restraint techniques.
* People may die from positional asphyxia by simply getting themselves into a breathing-restricted position they cannot get out of, either through the person's own carelessness, as a consequence of another [[accident]], or where infants are placed in a position where the mouth and nose is blocked, or where the chest may be unable to fully expand.

==Prone restraint==

Research has suggested that restraining a person in a face-down position is likely to cause greater restriction of breathing than restraining a person face-up.&lt;ref&gt;Parkes, J. (2002) ‘A Review of the Literature on Positional Asphyxia as a Possible Cause of Sudden Death During Restraint.’ British Journal of Forensic Practice. 4(1) 24–30.&lt;/ref&gt; Multiple cases have been associated with the hogtie or hobble prone restraint position.&lt;ref&gt;Reay, D.T., Fligner, C.L., Stilwell, A.D., Arnold, J. (1992)  'Positional Asphyxia During Law Enforcement Transport.'  The American Journal of Forensic Medicine and Pathology. 13(2) 90–97.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;O'Halloran, R.L., &amp; Frank, J.G. (2000) 'Asphyxial Death During Prone Restraint Revisited: A Report of 21 Cases.' The American Journal of Forensic Medicine and Pathology.  21(1) 39–52.&lt;/ref&gt; Many law enforcement and health personnel are now taught to avoid restraining people face-down or to do so only for a very short period of time.&lt;ref name="dt" /&gt;

Risk factors which may increase the chance of death include prolonged (particularly resisted) restraint, obesity, prior cardiac or respiratory problems, and the use of illicit drugs such as cocaine.&lt;ref name="sj"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Stratton SJ, Rogers C, Brickett K, Gruzinski G |title=Factors associated with sudden death of individuals requiring restraint for excited delirium |journal=Am J Emerg Med |volume=19 |issue=3 |pages=187–91 |year=2001 |pmid=11326341 |doi=10.1053/ajem.2001.22665}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other issues in the way the subject is restrained can also increase the risk of death, for example kneeling or otherwise placing weight on the subject and particularly any type of restraint hold around the subject's neck. Research measuring the effect of restraint positions on lung function suggests that restraint which involves bending the restrained person or placing body weight on them has more effect on their breathing than face-down positioning alone.&lt;ref&gt;Parkes, J. &amp; Carson, R. (2008) ‘Sudden Death During Restraint: Do Some Positions Affect Lung Function.’ [[Medicine, Science and the Law]] 48(2) 137-41&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other restraint positions==

Positional asphyxia is not limited to restraint in a face down position. Restraining a person in a seated position may also reduce the ability to breathe, if the person is pushed forwards with the chest on or close to the knees. The risk will be higher in cases where the restrained person has a high [[body mass index]] (BMI) and/or large waist girth.&lt;ref&gt;Parkes, J., Thake, D., Price, M. (2011) ‘Effect Of Seated Restraint And Body Size On Lung Function.’ Medicine Science And The Law. 51(3) 177-81&lt;/ref&gt;

==Resuscitation==

Resuscitation of persons who exhibit cardiac arrest following restraint has proven to be difficult. Even in cases where the subject was in the immediate care of paramedics, resuscitation has failed and the subject has died.&lt;ref&gt;Stratton, J.S., Rogers, C., Green, K. (1995) 'Sudden Death in Individuals in Hobble Restraints During Paramedic Transport.' Annals of Emergency Medicine. 25(5) 710-12&lt;/ref&gt; One group of doctors has presented a method of resuscitation, correcting [[acidosis]] in the blood of the victim, which proved effective in their small scale study.&lt;ref&gt;Hick, J.L., Smith, S.W., Lynch, M.T. (1999) 'Metabolic Acidosis In Restraint Associated Cardiac  Arrest: A Case Series.' Academic Emergency Medicine 6 239-43.&lt;/ref&gt; This approach appears to be supported by another report of a single case of successful resuscitation.&lt;ref&gt;Alshayeb H  (2010) Lactic Acidosis in Restrained Cocaine Intoxicated Patients. Tennessee Medicine. Nov-Dec. 37-39.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Debate regarding positional asphyxia==

'''''Power and Control: Domestic Violence in America''''' is a [[documentary film]] released in 2010 that depicts the issue of [[domestic violence in the U.S.]] as told through the personal story of Kim Mosher, a mother of three from [[Wabasha, Minnesota]] and victim of [[Physical abuse|physical]] and [[Psychological abuse|emotional abuse]]. Finally leaving her husband in 2008 and facing an uncertain future, she succeeds in re-building much of her life, seeking refuge at a [[women's shelter]] and forming deep friendships with other victims.&lt;ref name=synopsis/&gt; 

Detailing the problems dealt with by the multi-disciplinary anti-abuse effort known as the "[[Duluth model]]", it has received a variety of supportive critical reviews from publications such as the ''[[City Pages]]'' and ''The Minnesota Post''.&lt;ref name=digital/&gt;

==Background and film contents==
{{expand section|date=October 2013|the background issues in fighting domestic violence and the related details of how the anti-abuse programs work}}
As stated before, the film looks at the film of Kim Mosher and her suffering at the hands of both physical and emotional abuse. The [[Wabasha, Minnesota]] mother wanted to keep her ten-year marriage and family together, yet, once her husband began to physically [[Child abuse|abuse their children]] as well, she left her home with her children in 2008 for the Safe Haven battered [[women's shelter]] in [[Duluth, Minnesota|Duluth]] where she began to build a new life for them as well as her. The film shows her struggles as she searches for a job, seeks child care services, looks out for affordable housing, and otherwise attempts to raise her children safely.&lt;ref name=synopsis&gt;[http://www.powerandcontrolfilm.com/synopsis/ ''Power and Control: Domestic Violence in America'' Synopsis.] Hillcrest Films LLC. Retrieved November 19, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The documentary specifically explores the '[[Duluth model|Domestic Abuse Intervention Project]]', often called the '[[Duluth model]]', which was the first multi-disciplinary program designed to coordinate the actions of a variety of agencies in [[Duluth, Minnesota]] dealing with [[domestic violence]] for a more effective outcome. This organizational effort has become a test case looked at for programs in many other U.S. [[jurisdiction]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theduluthmodel.org/history.php Domestic Abuse Intervention Project: History]&lt;/ref&gt;  A nationwide study published in 2002, sponsored by the [[U.S. federal government|federal government]], found that batterers who complete programs based on the model are less likely to repeat acts of domestic violence than those who do not complete any batterers intervention program.&lt;ref name="MTwohey"&gt;{{cite web | last= Twohey | first = Megan | title = How Can Domestic Violence Be Stopped? | publisher = Chicago Tribune | url = http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/chi-abusers-02-jan02,0,1147422.story?page=2 | date = 2009-01-02 | accessdate = 2009-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
{{expand section|date=October 2013}}
The movie made its world premiere at the 'Minneapolis-St. Paul International Film Festival' in April 2010. Upon wide release, it has received critical praise from several publications. For example, ''[[City Pages]]'' writer Ira Booker found the film a "stark reminder that this kind of violence is all around us." ''The Minnesota Post'' ran an article referring to it as "a purely harrowing story" and "highly recommended.” As well, the [[Buffalo, NY]] web-project ''Educational Media Reviews Online'' endorsed the film.&lt;ref name=digital&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newdaydigital.com/Power-and-Control.html?authorization=3A38CEEE9528ADE0DEF5E81ABAC0F6A0&amp;verify=0|title=Power and Control|publisher=[http://www.newdaydigital.com newdaydigital.com]|accessdate=October 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In developed countries, PVF is a leading cause of death.&lt;ref name=pvf.com&gt;[http://www.primaryventricularfibrillation.com primaryventricularfibrillation.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Worldwide, the annual number of deaths caused by PVF is comparable to the number of deaths caused by road traffic accidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mathers CD, Loncar D |title= Projections of global mortality and burden of disease from 2002 to 2030|journal= PLoS Med|volume=3 |issue=11|pages=e442 |year=2006|pmid=17132052|doi= 10.1371/journal.pmed.0030442|url= |pmc= 1664601}}&lt;/ref&gt; A substantial portion of these deaths could be avoided by seeking immediate medical attention when symptoms are noticed.&lt;ref name=pvf.com/&gt;

==Definition==
PVF is defined as ventricular fibrillation not preceded by [[heart failure]] or [[Shock (circulatory)|shock]], in contrast to secondary ventricular fibrillation, which is.

==Risk factors==
The risk of PVF during acute myocardial infarction is related to the amount of [[ST elevation]], the presence of [[hypokalemia]], the absence of pre-infarction [[angina]], the size of the infarction, and the presence of a blocked left [[coronary artery]]. Other risk factors could include younger age, male gender, and history of [[sudden cardiac death]] in [[first degree relative]]s.&lt;ref name="Gheeraert PJ, De Buyzere ML, Taeymans YM, Gillebert TC, Henriques JP, De Backer G, De Bacquer D 2006 2499-510"/&gt;

==Survival==
The survival of PVF largely depends on the promptness of [[defibrillation]]. The success rate of prompt defibrillation during monitoring is currently higher than 95%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Volpi A, Cavalli A, Santoro L, Negri E |title=  Incidence and prognosis of early primary ventricular fibrillation in acute myocardial infarction--results of the Gruppo Italiano per lo Studio della Sopravvivenza nell'Infarto Miocardico (GISSI-2) database.|journal= Am J Cardiol |volume= 82|issue=3 |pages= 265–71|year= 1998|pmid= 9708651|doi= 10.1016/S0002-9149(98)00336-1|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that the success rate decreases by 10% for each additional minute of delay.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

==Prognosis==
After return of heart function, there has been a moderately higher risk of death in the hospital when compared to MI patients without PVF.  Whether this still holds true with the recent changes in treatment strategies of earlier hospital admission and immediate [[angioplasty]] with [[thrombus]] removal is unknown. PVF does not affect the long-term [[prognosis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Behar S, Goldbourt U, Reicher-Reiss H, Kaplinsky E |title=  Prognosis of acute myocardial infarction complicated by primary ventricular fibrillation.

{{Violence against women}}

Violence during the [[Rwandan genocide]] of 1994 took a gender-specific form when, over the course of 100 days, up to half a million women and children were raped, sexually mutilated, or murdered. The [[International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda]] (ICTR) handed down the first conviction for the use of rape as a weapon of war during the civil conflict, and, because the intent of the mass violence against Rwandan women and children was to destroy, in whole or in part, a particular ethnic group, it was the first time that mass rape during wartime was found to be an act of [[genocidal rape]].{{sfn|Chalk|2007|p=372}}{{efn|"...&amp;nbsp;any of the following acts committed with [[Genocide#Intent to destroy|intent to destroy]], [[Genocide#In part|in whole or in part]], a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such:
:(a) Killing members of the group;
:(b) Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group;
:(c) Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part;
:(d) Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group;
:(e) Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group. Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, Article 2"}}

The mass rapes were carried out by the [[Interahamwe]] militia and members of the Hutu civilian population, both male and females, the [[Rwandan Defence Forces|Rwandan military]], and the Rwandan Presidential Guard. The sexual violence was directed at the national and local levels by political and military leaders in the furtherance of their goal, the destruction of the [[Tutsi]] ethnic group.{{sfn|Nowrojee|1996|p=1}}{{sfn|Leatherman|2011}}

There was extensive use of propaganda through both print and radio to incite violence against women, with both mediums being used to portray Tutsi women as untrustworthy, and as acting against the [[Hutu]] majority. The conflict resulted in an estimated 2,000 to 10,000 "[[war babies]]" being born as a result of forced impregnation.

== Rape as a weapon of genocide ==
{{main article|Wartime sexual violence}}

[[File:Rwandan refugee camp in east Zaire.jpg|thumb|250px|Refugee camp for Rwandans in Kimbumba, eastern Zaire (current Democratic Republic of the Congo), following the Rwandan genocide.]]

During the conflict Hutu extremists released hundreds of patients from hospitals, who were suffering from [[AIDS]], and formed them into "rape squads". The intent was to infect and cause a "slow, inexorable death".{{sfn|Drumbl|2012}} Obijiofor Aginam argues that while throughout history sexual violence against women is replete with such incidents of rape during times of war, more recent conflicts have seen the use of rape as a weapon of war become a "conspicuous phenomenon". He believes that the deliberate infection of women with [[HIV]] is evidenced from survivors testimony. Françoise Nduwimana documented testimony from survivors of rape, recounting the testimony of one woman:

&lt;blockquote&gt;For 60 days, my body was used as a thoroughfare for all the hoodlums, militia men and soldiers in the district&amp;nbsp;... Those men completely destroyed me; they caused me so much pain. They raped me in front of my six children&amp;nbsp;... Three years ago, I discovered I had HIV/AIDS. There is no doubt in my mind that I was infected during these rapes.{{sfn|Aginam|2012}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Aginam argues that these testimonies provide proof that there was a clear intent by the rapists to infect women with HIV.{{sfn|Aginam|2012}}

Survivors have testified that the transmission of the HIV virus was a deliberate act by talking about how the men, before they raped them, would say that they were not going to kill them directly but rather give them a slow death from AIDS. Two-thirds of a sample of 1,200 Rwandan genocide widows tested positive for HIV, and the infection rates in rural areas more than doubled after the genocide.{{sfn|Elbe|2002|pp=159-177}} There is no data on the number of victims who died from AIDS after 1994 who had contracted the disease from having been raped during the genocide.{{sfn|Verwimp|2006|pp=5-22}}

Although Tutsi women were the main targets, moderate Hutu women were also raped during the genocide.{{sfn|de Brouwer|2005|p=13}} Along with the Hutu moderates, Hutu women who were married to Tutsis and Hutu women who hid Tutsis were targeted.{{sfn|Nowrojee|1996|p=2}} In a  testimonial, Maria Louise Niyobuhungiro recalls seeing local people and Hutu men watched her get raped up to five times a day, and that when she was kept under watch by a woman, she received neither sympathy nor help and was also forced to farm between rapes.{{sfn|Ka Hon Ch|2010|pp=29-34}}

Tutsi women were also targeted with the intent of destroying their reproductive capabilities. [[Sexual mutilation]] sometimes occurred after the rape and included mutilation of the vagina with machetes, knives, sharpened sticks, boiling water, and acid.{{sfn|Nowrojee|1996|p=63}} The genocidaires also held women as sex slaves for weeks.{{sfn|Rittner|2009|p=291-305}}

Major Brent Beardsley, assistant to Dallaire, gave testimony at the ICTR. When asked about the sexual violence he had witnessed, he stated that the killing blows tended to be aimed at the reproductive organs, and that the victims had been deliberately slashed on the breasts and vagina. Beardsley also testified to having seen the bodies of girls as young as six and seven who had been raped so brutally that their vaginas were split and swollen from what had obviously been gang rapes. He concluded by saying "Massacres kill the body. Rape kills the soul. And there was a lot of rape. It seemed that everywhere we went, from the period of 19th of April until the time we left, there was rape everywhere near these killing sites."{{sfn|Nowrojee |2007|p=364}}

== Estimates of victims ==

Research has suggested that nearly every female survivor over twelve years of age had been a victim of rape.{{sfn|Walsh|2012|p=59}} According to U.N. Special Rapporteur, Rene Degni-Segui, "Rape was the rule, and its absence the exception".

In 1996, Degni-Segui estimated that the number of women and girls raped was between 250,000 and 500,000. Degni-Segui's estimate was arrived at after he evaluated rape cases which had been documented and the number of resulting war babies. Degni-Segui believed that the 15,700 rape incidents reported by the Rwanda Ministry for Family and Protection of Women were most likely an underestimate, given the number of years victims would take to report their rapes, if ever they did. He also discovered that the estimates by medical personnel of one birth per 100 rapes did not include women who had been murdered. He said of the atrocities, "Rape was systematic and was used as a 'weapon' by the perpetrators of the massacres. This can be estimated from the number and nature of the victims as well as from the forms of rape."{{sfn|Sai|2012}}

Bijleveld, Morssinkhof, and Smeulers estimated 354,440 women raped. They examined the testimonies of the victims, and also the number of those who had been forcibly impregnated; these were then added to the known amount of those who had been raped, but had been killed. They stated that "Almost all surviving Tutsi women were raped."{{sfn|Sai|2012}}

== Use of propaganda ==

[[File:Propaganda cartoon from the Rwandan Genocide.png|thumb|right|250px|1994 cartoon printed in Kangura and written in Kinyarwanda: "General Dallaire and his army have fallen into the trap of Tutsi ''[[Femme fatale|Femmes fatales]]''."]]

Hutu propaganda played an important role in both the genocide and the gender-specific violence. It often depicted Tutsi women as "a sexually seductive 'fifth column' in league with the Hutus' enemies". The brutality of the sexual violence, and complicity of Hutu women in the attacks, suggested that the propaganda was effective at mobilizing both females and males to participate in the genocide.{{sfn|Jones|2010|pp=138-141}}

One of the first victims was [[Agathe Uwilingiyimana]], who had been the first woman to hold the post of prime minister. For the twelve months preceding the genocide, she had been portrayed in extremist political literature and propaganda as being a threat to the nation, and as sexually promiscuous.{{sfn|Lynch|McGoldrick|2010|p=111}}

Early in 1990, over a dozen newspapers were launched, in either [[Kinyarwanda]] or [[French language|French]] methodically exploited ethnic tensions. In December 1990, the newspaper ''[[Kangura]]'' printed the [[Hutu Ten Commandments]] of which four dealt specifically with women.{{efn|
* Every Hutu should know that a Tutsi woman, wherever she is, works for the interest of her Tutsi ethnic group. As a result, we shall consider a traitor any Hutu who: marries a Tutsi woman; befriends a Tutsi woman; employs a Tutsi woman as a secretary or a concubine. 
* Every Hutu should know that our Hutu daughters are more suitable and conscientious in their role as woman, wife and mother of the family. Are they not beautiful, good secretaries and more honest?
* Hutu women, be vigilant and try to bring your husbands, brothers and sons back to reason.
* The Rwandese Armed Forces should be exclusively Hutu. The experience of the October [1990] war has taught us a lesson. No member of the military shall marry a Tutsi.{{sfn|Singular|1999|pp=113–115}} }}{{sfn|Nowrojee|2007|p=366}} On 29 January 1992, Kangura accused Tutsi women of having a monopoly on employment in both the private and public sectors, saying that they would hire their "Tutsi sisters on the basis of their thin noses" (a stereotypical 'Tutsi feature'). Kangura requested that all Hutu be vigilant against the Tutsi, who they called Inyenzi (cockroaches), as well as those considered accomplices. In an interview with [[Human Rights Watch]] one Hutu woman stated, "According to the propaganda, the Tutsi were hiding the enemy. And their beautiful women were being used to do it. So, everybody knew what that meant."{{sfn|Nowrojee|2007|p=366}}

Cartoons in print media represented Tutsi women as being sexually provocative. One printed by Kangura depicted the head of the UN peace-keeping forces in an amorous position with two Tutsi women; the caption read, "General Dallaire and his men have fallen into the trap of [[Femme fatale]]s". Another image portrayed Tutsi women having sex with three Belgian paratroopers.{{sfn|Taylor|2009|p=131}}

Using both printed press and the [[Radio Télévision Libre des Mille Collines]] (RTLMC), propagandists portrayed Tutsi women as "devious seductresses who would undermine the Hutu". Members of the military were barred from marrying Tutsi women, and Tutsi women were portrayed as arrogant, ugly and viewing Hutu men as inferior.{{sfn|Nowrojee|2007|p=365}}

== Aftermath ==

Survivors found themselves [[Social stigma|stigmatized]], often denied their rights to property and inheritance as well as opportunities for employment.{{sfn|De Brouwer|2010|p=19}} It is estimated by the National Population Office of Rwanda that between 2,000 and 5,000 children were born as a result of forced impregnation. However, victims groups believe this is underestimated and the number exceeds 10,000. These children are themselves stigmatized and referred to as ''les enfants mauvais souvenir'' (children of bad memories) or ''enfants indésirés'' (lit. "unwanted children", glossed as "children of hate" by M. Mukangendo{{sfn|Mukangendo|2007|p=40}}). Victims also suffered from [[Survivor guilt|survivor's guilt]], and anxiety due to their assailants not being held accountable.{{sfn|Mukamana|Collins|2006|p=141}} In 1995, widows of the genocide founded ''[[Association des Veuves du Genocide]]'' (AVEGA, Widows of the Genocide of April) to see to the needs of female survivors who had been widowed or raped.{{sfn|Mukamana|Collins|2006|pp=142-143}} The extent of the rapes was quickly recognized by human rights groups, with one report, ''Shattered Lives: Sexual Violence During the Rwandan Genocide and Its Aftermath'' written by Binaifer Nowrojee, becoming one of the most highly cited human rights reports in up to thirty years.{{sfn|Jones|2011|p=143}}

== War crimes trials ==

[[File:ICTR in Kigali.jpg|thumb|right|250px|An ICTR building in [[Kigali]]]]

Evidence presented to the ICTR revealed Hutu political leaders ordered the mass rapes be carried out.{{sfn|Merry|2008|p=166}}

[[Jean-Paul Akayesu]] became the first person convicted for using rape as form of genocide.{{sfn|De Brouwer|2005|pp=105-107}}{{sfn|Volkmann-Benkert|2009|pp=162-163}} Initially, gender based violence had not been included in the indictment against Akayesu; however, following pressure by [[non-governmental organization]]s (NGOs), the indictment was amended.{{sfn|Schabas|2000|p=164-165}} During the trial of Akayesu, the ICTR affirmed that sexual violence, including rape, fell under paragraph B of the [[Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide]], as the rapes had been carried out with the sole intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a specific group.{{sfn|Schabas|2000|pp=162-163}} The ICTR also found that the sexual violence against Tutsi women was a systematic part of the genocide. To this extent, the finding against Akayesu, that rape can be an act of genocide,{{sfn|Eboe-Osuji|2012|pp=159-160}} represented a major change in international jurisprudence and prosecutions of genocide.{{sfn|Schabas|2000|p=163-164}} On 2 September 1998, Akayesu was sentenced to life imprisonment after being found guilty of genocide and crimes against humanity, including rape.{{sfn|Eltringham|2004|p=28}}

The first woman charged for genocidal rape was [[Pauline Nyiramasuhuko]], a politician, who was the Minister for Family Welfare and the Advancement of Women during the conflict.{{sfn|Fielding |2012|p=25}} The ICTR found that

&lt;blockquote&gt;Between 19 April and late June 1994 Nyiramasuhuko, Ntahobali, ''Interahamwe'' and soldiers went to the BPO to abduct hundreds of Tutsis; the Tutsi refugees were physically assaulted and raped; and the Tutsi refugees were killed in various locations throughout Ngoma commune."{{sfn|Drumbl|2012}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

During the Media trial, [[Hassan Ngeze]] (editor-in-chief of Kangura), and [[Ferdinand Nahimana]] and [[Jean-Bosco Barayagwiza]] (founders of RTLMC) were all brought up on charges. The ICTR judged that the ''Hutu Ten Commandments'' and another article titled ''The Appeal to the Conscience of the Hutu'' conveyed "contempt and hatred for the Tutsi ethnic group, and for Tutsi women in particular as enemy agents, and called on readers to take all necessary measures to stop the enemy, defined as the Tutsi population".{{sfn|Grunfeld|2007|pp=21-22}}

[[File:Iranian Kilo-class diesel submarine.jpg|thumb|Iranian Navy [[Kilo-class submarine]]. The rescue buoy (red and white sectors) is just ahead of the aft rescue hatch (white ring)]]
A submarine '''rescue buoy''' is a floating [[buoy]], attached to a [[submarine]] and released in the event of a serious accident or sinking. The buoy remains attached to the submarine by a cable. Once on the surface it can indicate to rescuers the position of the submarine, and may include a telephone for communication with the trapped submariners.

== Soviet Navy ==
Rescue buoys were a prominent feature of Soviet submarines. A large steel buoy, painted red and white, could be seen in a deck housing on most submarine classes. Soviet submarines also had two rescue hatches and these were highlighted by white painted rings.

As it may be difficult to manually release the buoy, or the compartment where the buoy controls are located may have been flooded, the buoys were arranged with automatic releases, in the event of a fire or internal flooding. Such automatic sensors proved unreliable and buoys were sometimes released unexpectedly. Accidental release of a buoy would have been a hazard during wartime operations, or even during exercises. There is some indication that unreliable buoys were welded into place.&lt;ref name="Underwood, 2005" /&gt; This may have been a factor in incidents such as the [[Kursk submarine disaster#Rescue buoy failed|''Kursk'' sinking]], where the buoy was not released and it was difficult to locate the wreck.&lt;ref name="Underwood, 2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NRPA" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1848">'''Sementivae''', also known as '''Feriae Sementivae''' or '''Sementina dies''' (in the country called '''Paganalia'''), was a [[Roman festival]] of [[sowing]].

It was a type of ''[[feriae conceptivae]]'' [or ''conceptae'']. These free days were held every year, but not on certain or fixed days, the time being every year appointed by the magistrates or priests (''quotannis a magistratibus vel sacerdotibus concipiuntur''&lt;ref&gt;[[Macrobius]] l. c.; [[Marcus Terentius Varro|Varro]], ''On the Latin Language in 25 Books,'' vi. 25, etc.; [[Sextus Pompeius Festus|Festus]] s. v.).&lt;/ref&gt;.

It was held in honor of [[Ceres (Roman mythology)|Ceres]] (the goddess of agriculture) and [[Terra (goddess)|Tellus]] (Mother Earth). The initial half of the event was a festival in honor of [[Terra (mythology)|Tellus]] which ran from January 24 through January 26. The festival honoring Ceres occurred one week later, starting February 2. The ''Sementina dies'' were kept in seed-time at Rome for the purpose of praying for a good crop; it lasted only for one day, which was fixed by the pontiffs.&lt;ref&gt;Varro ''On the Latin Language in 25 Books,'' vi. 26, ''de Re Rustica,'' i. 2, init.; [[Ovid]], ''On the Roman Calendar,'' i. 658, etc.)&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time the Paganalia were observed in the country.&lt;ref&gt;Merkel, [[Ovid]], ''On the Roman Calendar,'' p. clv.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

'''The Day the Earth Smiled''' refers to July 19, 2013, the date on which the ''[[Cassini–Huygens|Cassini]]'' spacecraft turned to image [[Saturn]], most of its visible [[ring system]], and [[Earth]], during an [[eclipse]] of the [[Sun]]. The spacecraft had done this twice before (in 2006 and 2012) in its previous nine years in [[orbit]]. The name is also used to refer to the activities associated with the event, as well as to the [[photographic mosaic]] created from it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA17171 |title=Catalog Page for PIA17171 |publisher=[[NASA]]'s [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conceived by the planetary scientist [[Carolyn Porco]], who was the imaging team leader for ''Cassini'', the concept called for the people of the world to reflect on their place in [[Universe|the cosmos]], to marvel at [[life]] on Earth, and, at the time the pictures were taken, to look up and smile in celebration.&lt;ref name=Porco&gt;{{cite news|last=Porco|first=Carolyn|title=NASA's Cassini Cameras to Provide Breathtaking Image of Earth from Saturn|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/2013/06/celebrating-saturn.html|accessdate=2 July 2013|newspaper=[[PBS]]|date=18 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Jones&gt;{{cite news|last=Jones|first=Jonathan|title=People of Earth, say cheese!

==Events==

The ''[[Cassini-Huygens|Cassini]]'' probe took images of Earth from close to a billion miles away at 21:27 UTC, July 19, 2013. A number of activities were planned to celebrate the occasion:

* A website was set up as a portal to activities associated with July 19.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Day the Earth Smiled|url=http://thedaytheearthsmiled.com/info.php|accessdate=2 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On it, Porco encouraged the world to celebrate life on planet Earth and humanity's accomplishments in the exploration of the solar system.
* [[Astronomers Without Borders]] coordinated events internationally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Day the Earth Smiled|url=http://www.astronomerswithoutborders.org/projects/the-day-the-earth-smiled.html|publisher=Astronomers Without Borders|accessdate=2 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* [[NASA]] spearheaded a related event called 'Wave at Saturn' "to help acknowledge the historic interplanetary portrait as it is being taken".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/news/newsreleases/newsrelease20040618/|title=Cassini to Take Photo of Earth from Deep Space|publisher=saturn.jpl.nasa.gov|accessdate=2013-06-27|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130622053829/http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/news/newsreleases/newsrelease20040618/|archivedate=2013-06-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* A "Message to the Milky Way" contest was held by Porco's company, Diamond Sky Productions. People could submit a digital photo taken on July 19 and/or a musical composition. The winning entries were beamed as a message to extraterrestrials, "into the Milky Way from the [[Arecibo Observatory|Arecibo Radio Telescope]] in Puerto Rico".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Message to the Milky Way|url=http://diamondskyproductions.com/recent/index.php#mmw}}&lt;/ref&gt; This follows the example set in 1974, when the first serious communication to alien civilizations, the [[Arecibo message]], was broadcast from Arecibo.

==Results==

Raw images from ''Cassini'' were received on Earth shortly after the event, and a couple of processed images—a high-resolution image of the Earth and the Moon, and a small portion of the final wide-angle mosaic showing the Earth—were released to the public a few days following the July 19 imaging sequence.&lt;ref name=FoxJuly22&gt;{{cite news|title=Cassini spacecraft photographs Earth from 900 million miles away|url=http://www.foxnews.com/science/2013/07/22/day-earth-smiled/|accessdate=15 November 2013|newspaper=[[Fox News]]|date=22 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Spinks&gt;{{cite news|last=Spinks|first=Peter|title=Earth viewed from a billion miles away|url=http://www.smh.com.au/technology/sci-tech/earth-viewed-from-a-billion-miles-away-20130726-2qo22.html|accessdate=15 November 2013|newspaper=Sydney Morning Herald|date=26 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The New Three Stooges''''' is an American animated television series that ran from 1965 to 1966 starring [[the Three Stooges]]. The show follows the trio's antics both in live-action and animated segments. The cast consisted of [[Moe Howard]], [[Larry Fine]] and [[Joe DeRita|Joe "Curly Joe" DeRita]], with actor and close friend [[Emil Sitka]] co-starring, as well as [[Margaret Kerry]].

==Production==
41 live action sequences were executively produced by cartoonist [[Norman Maurer]], Moe's son-in-law, who was their film agent at this time. [[Edward Bernds]], who had directed the team at Columbia Pictures from 1945 to 1952 during most of the [[Shemp Howard|Shemp]] era, was also hired to write and direct the series. Emil Sitka, who had appeared in many of the Stooges comedies over the years, was slated to appear in these wraparounds as straightman to the Stooges.&lt;ref name="Scrapbook"&gt;{{cite book| last = Howard Maurer| first = Joan| authorlink = Joan Howard Maurer|author2=Jeff Lenburg |author3=Greg Lenburg | title = The Three Stooges Scrapbook| publisher = Citadel Press| year = 1982| location = | pages = 170–171| doi =| id = | isbn = 0-8065-0946-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cambria Productions|Cambria Studios]] produced 156 short Stooge cartoons under the supervision of Lee Orgel. Four cartoons were produced to correspond thematically with 40 of the live-action Stooge opening and closing sequences, so that one live-action sequence could serve as a wraparound for four different cartoons. Joe DeRita later commented that this presented something of a problem for viewers:

{{cquote|There were 156 cartoons and we made only 40 live-action segments. So after they ran the whole 40, they'd just start over by using these same introductions on ''new'' cartoons. This turned out to be misleading because viewers would say, 'Oh, I've seen this one before.' and they'd turn off the television. They didn't know it was a new cartoon.&lt;ref name="Scrapbook"/&gt;}}

Most of the cartoons ended up with the trio running into the horizon after accidentally causing havoc at their current jobs. The cartoons were unusual for Cambria in that they did not use [[Syncro-Vox]], Cambria's patented technique which used filmed footage of the voice actors' mouths over top of still frames. The pilot cartoon, "That Little Old Bomb Maker", featured a unique live-action wrap around that was not reused on other cartoons.

Some of the cartoons featured a recurring character named Badman, a jerky supervillain with a [[Batman]] get-up who is actually a 5-year-old boy that is nice and kind. The boy can only transform to Badman if he ever hears or says the word "bad", and for Badman, vice versa for "good". In the episode "Badman of the Briny", the two finally find out that they are the same person in several scenes. Another recurring character was a western outlaw named Getoutoftownbysundown Brown.

To avoid any licensing problems, Cambria did not use any of the past Three Stooges theme songs, including "[[Three Blind Mice]]", or "[[Listen to the Mockingbird]]", even though both had lapsed into the [[public domain]] at the time (likewise, the on-screen title used a numeral 3 to avoid infringing on any trademark [[Columbia Pictures]] might have held on the phrase "The Three Stooges"). Several of the musical pieces used on the show were also used for the ''[[Bozo's Big Top]]'' series in the 1960s and early 1970s.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}

This was actually not the first attempt at an animated version of "The Three Stooges", nor was it the last. During the late 1950s, [[Norman Maurer]] attempted to sell ''Stooge Time'', a partially live action, partially [[rotoscoping|rotoscope animation]] half-hour series to television. In 1960, Maurer and the Stooges filmed a pilot for a half-hour series ''[[The Three Stooges Scrapbook]]'', which featured a five-minute Stooge cartoon. The Three Stooges would later return to animated form in two episodes of ''[[The New Scooby-Doo Movies]]'' and in the series ''[[The Robonic Stooges]]''.

==Reception==
''The New Three Stooges'' was well received upon initial airings, despite the use of [[limited animation]]. However, the boys were visibly aging during this time (Moe was 68 and Larry was 63), so the [[slapstick]] was subdued in the live action segments. Orgel later stated that the Stooges' penchant for slapstick violence was kept to a minimum due to the concerns of parental groups.&lt;ref name="Scrapbook"/&gt;&lt;ref name=DVD/&gt; In addition, Larry's health was in decline, resulting in several lines of dialogue being slurred. This resulted in much of the comedy being divided between Moe and Curly Joe, with Larry only chiming in when necessary.&lt;ref name="Forrester"&gt;{{cite book| last = Forrester| first = Jeff| authorlink = Jeff Forrester| title = The Three Stooges: The Triumphs and Tragedies of the Most Popular Comedy Team of All Time| publisher = Donaldson Books| year = 2004| pages = 162| url = | doi =| id = | isbn = 0-9715801-0-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The color television series lasted successfully from 1965 to 1966. Although animated portions of the show were last aired in [[Television syndication|syndication]] on [[WGN-TV]] in the [[Chicago]] area in the early 1980s (and later the early 1990s), repackaged and distributed at the time by [[Harmony Gold USA]] and Jeffrey Scott Productions,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUmIMeqNfKQ New 3 Stooges – Syndicated Program Elements, Circa 1984 – YouTube], accessed on January 26, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; it is occasionally seen on [[Me-TV]]. It also aired in Japan on TV Tokyo. Several episodes are currently available on [[VHS]] and [[DVD]] (often in cheap "dollar packages") because the majority of the series fell into the [[public domain]]. An example of an episode that is not in the public domain is "The Tree Nuts".

''The New Three Stooges '' became the only regularly scheduled television series in the Stooges' history. Unlike other film shorts that aired on television like ''[[Looney Tunes]]'', ''[[Tom and Jerry]]'' and ''[[Popeye the Sailor (animated cartoons)|Popeye]]'', the Stooges' short films never had a regularly scheduled national television program to air in, neither on network nor syndicated; the film shorts, at roughly 20 minutes apiece, were of ideal size to be run as a stand-alone television series in and of themselves. When Columbia/Screen Gems licensed the film library to television beginning in 1958, local stations aired the shorts when they saw fit, either as late-night "filler" or marathon sessions.

On October 15, 2013, [[Image Entertainment|Image Madacy Entertainment]] released ''The New Three Stooges: Complete Cartoon Collection'' on DVD in Region 1 for the very first time.&lt;ref name="tvshowsondvd"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tvshowsondvd.com/news/New-Stooges-Complete-Cartoon-Collection/18642 |title=The New Three Stooges DVD news: Announcement for The New Three Stooges – Complete Cartoon Collection |publisher=tvshowsondvd.com |accessdate=September 7, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304203725/http://tvshowsondvd.com/news/New-Stooges-Complete-Cartoon-Collection/18642 |archivedate=March 4, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The five-disc set features all 156 cartoons and 40 live action sequences on four discs and the bonus disc is a CD by the Stooges.

==Lawsuit==
The series proved to be a financial headache for the Stooges. In accordance with their contract, Cambria Studios' distributor was supposed to forward quarterly statements to the trio to keep them abreast of the show's profits. Norman Maurer recalled receiving only one or two statements over a five-year period, ultimately leading to a lawsuit. The judge presiding over the case knew little about the film or television industry and ruled in favor of Cambria. The Stooges appealed the decision in 1975, leading to a victory in their favor. However, it changed nothing in regard to the distributor's failure to provide the necessary profit statements to Normandy Productions, and by the time the case was decided, both Larry and Moe had died.&lt;ref name="Scrapbook"/&gt;

'''The Shed at Dulwich''' was a spoof restaurant in a [[garden shed]] in [[Dulwich]].  It was created as a hoax by journalist Oobah Butler for [[Vice (magazine)|Vice magazine]] and became the top-rated restaurant in London on [[TripAdvisor]] before the listing was taken down.&lt;ref name=T/&gt; The restaurant was open for one night in November 2017, serving ten guests including a couple from California.&lt;ref name=ES/&gt;

The faux menu theme was "moods”&lt;ref name=DT/&gt;, and Butler photographed plates of food created using household products including shaving foam and [[dishwasher tablet]]s.&lt;ref name="ny"&gt;{{cite news |title=The Never-Ending War on Fake Reviews |url=https://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/the-never-ending-war-on-fake-reviews |accessdate=1 June 2018 |work=The New Yorker |date=31 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; One item on the menu purported to be "[[Empathetic]] Vegan clams in a clear broth with parsnips, carrots, celery, and potatoes. Served with rye crisps."&lt;ref name=DT/&gt;

Butler had once worked posting fake reviews of other restaurants at a rate of £10 per review, saying, "I’d look at the menu, pick something, and start lying." For The Shed, he asked friends to post fake TripAdvisor reviews&lt;ref name="vice"&gt;{{cite web |title=I Made My Shed the Top Rated Restaurant On TripAdvisor |url=https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/434gqw/i-made-my-shed-the-top-rated-restaurant-on-tripadvisor |website=Vice |accessdate=1 June 2018 |language=en-uk |date=6 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; in sufficient quantity to place the venue among the top two thousand restaurants in London.&lt;ref name="ny"/&gt; The restaurant attracted a single one-star review from what Butler assumed was a rival.&lt;ref name="ny"/&gt;

After becoming the top-rated restaurant on TripAdvisor and bombarded with requests for bookings, Butler staged a genuine opening night for the restaurant, serving thinly-disguised £1 [[ready meal]]s to ten customers.&lt;ref name=ES/&gt;&lt;ref name="vice"/&gt; Having been blindfolded and then led down the alley past his house to the end of the garden and the shed, some said they wanted to come back and would recommend it.&lt;ref name="vice"/&gt;

The hoax drew comparison to the trend for [[micro-restaurant]]s. In 2017 chef [[Tom Kerridge]]  started a real venue called ''The Shed'', opposite his gastropub, [[The Hand and Flowers]], in [[Marlow, Buckinghamshire|Marlow]], which was described as an "intimate private dining space".&lt;ref name=T18/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2573">'''Ustadh Sis''' (also spelled: Ustad Sis, or Ostad Sis, {{lang-fa|استاذ سیس}}) was a [[Persian people|Persian]] [[heresiarch]] and anti-[[Arab]] [[rebellion|rebel]] leader.
They write that he was once a governor of Khorasan and father to Ma'mūn’s Iranian mother, Marjil, which makes him Ma'mūn’s grandfather.

He claimed he was a [[prophet]] of [[God]] in the eastern fringe of [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] in the mid 8th century and managed to gain followers among the villagers in that area. Many were previously followers of [[Bihafarid]], whom the [[Abbasid]] commander, [[Abu Muslim]], crushed militarily.

== Reinvigoration of Bihafarid's movement ==
Ustadh Sis launched a rebellion in 767, purportedly with 300,000 fighting men.&lt;ref name="al-Tabari"&gt;

{{cite book |last1=al-Tabari|first1=Muhammad ibn Jarir|title=The History of al-Tabari Vol. 29: Al-Mansur and al-Mahdi A.D. 763-786/A.H. 146-169 |publisher=SUNY Press|year=1990 |pages=44-48 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xWtKTONN7BoC |isbn=9780791401439}}

&lt;/ref&gt; His initial base was the mountainous region of [[Badghis]], and he soon occupied [[Herat]] and [[Sistan]] before marching towards [[Merv]]. He initially defeated an Abbasid army under the command of al-Ajtham of [[Merv]], but was himself defeated in a bloody battle against an army led by [[al-Mahdi]], the son of the [[Caliph]] [[al-Mansur]] (and a future Caliph himself).

== Suppression of Ustadh Sis rebellion ==
According to [[al-Tabari]], 70,000 of Ustadh Sis's followers were killed in the battle, and 14,000 were taken captive.&lt;ref name="al-Tabari" /&gt; Ustadh Sis managed to flee to the mountains, but the general [[Khazim ibn Khuzayma al-Tamimi]] followed him and was able to capture him. Ustadh Sis was sent in chains to [[Al-Mansur]], who ordered his execution. Later, [[Al-Mahdi]] gave amnesty to 30,000 captives.

Chairman of The Swedish Writers' Union and President of WALTIC 2008: Mats Söderlund. Program Committee: [[Gabriella Håkansson]] and [[Henrik C. Enbohm]].

== WALTIC Resolution ==

During WALTIC 2008 a resolution was adopted stating that: "''Literature is a source of knowledge with the strength to empower entire populations''", hence underlining that "''Literacy, freedom of expression and authors' rights are keys to the never-ending pursuit of truth, for the development of societies based on democratic and humanitarian values as well as for the individual aspiring to express his or her unique knowledge and experience''", and moreover, that "''Increasing literacy is essential to improvement of welfare and democratic processes, and to the safeguarding of human rights''." The resolution also noted that "''Safeguarding freedom of expression makes it possible for both the ordinary citizen and decision makers to better understand the world around them and thus to make informed decisions''". (The WALTIC Resolution can be read in full at www.waltic.com)

'''William Ansel Kinney''' (1860–1930) was a lawyer and politician in the [[Kingdom of Hawaii]], through the [[Republic of Hawaii]] and into the [[Territory of Hawaii]].

==Family==
William Ansel Kinney was born October 16, 1860, in [[Honolulu]], [[Hawaii]].
His father was William Kinney, who was born April 15, 1832, in [[Chebogue, Nova Scotia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Sons of the American Revolution. Hawaii Society Yearbook |editor= [[William DeWitt Alexander]] |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k0sCAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA45 |year=1897 |page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;
His uncle [[Joseph Robbins Kinney]] (1839–1919) was a member of the [[House of Commons of Canada]].
His father came to the [[Hawaiian Islands]] in the 1850s and married his mother Caroline Dailey (died March 25, 1897) on July 6, 1857.&lt;ref name="marriage"/&gt;
His father then married up to three different [[native Hawaiian]] women, having many other children by them. 
For example, half-brother William Kihapi{{okina}}ilani Kinney (1868–1953) married Mary Francesca Vierra, and their son Ernest Kaipoleimanu Kinney (1906–1987) married Esther Kauikeaulani Ka{{okina}}ulili and had daughter [[Rubellite Kawena Kinney Johnson]], who became a Hawaiian historian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= John Keny, d. 1693, Milton, MA |work= DNA test results |author= Georgia Kinney Bopp |date= June 4, 2010 |url= http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~gkbopp/KINNEY/Research/LINES2/73491.htm |accessdate= August 15, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The youngest half-sibling was [[Ray Kinney]], born in [[Hilo]] September 26, 1900, who became a popular musician and composer. His father managed the [[sugarcane]] [[Sugar plantations in Hawaii|plantation]] at [[Honomu, Hawaii]] and died June 3, 1915.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Nick Hayes &amp; Sue Drake - root and branch |work= Rootsweb |url = http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=hayes-drake&amp;id=I17983 |accessdate= August 14, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Law career==
Kinney attended [[Royal School (Hawaii)|Royal School]] and later [[Punahou School]] 1874–1877 and worked as a clerk in a law office. He graduated from law school at the [[University of Michigan]] in 1883.&lt;ref name="UofM"&gt;{{cite book |author=Charles I.

He married Alice Vaughan McBryde on August 16, 1893 in Honolulu.&lt;ref name="marriage"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ulukau.org/gsdl2.7/cgi-bin/algene?e=q-0algene&amp;a=d&amp;c=algene&amp;d=D10-000042 |title=Marriage record |work=state archives digital collections |publisher=state of Hawaii |accessdate= August 14, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
His first law partner was [[Arthur P. Peterson]]. In 1887 he became partners with [[William Owen Smith]] and [[Lorrin A. Thurston]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Hawaiian Kingdom 1874-1893, the Kalakaua Dynasty |author= [[Ralph Simpson Kuykendall]] |url= http://www.ulukau.org/elib/cgi-bin/library?c=kingdom3&amp;l=en |volume=3 |publisher= University of Hawaii Press |year= 1967 |isbn= 978-0-87022-433-1 |page= 347 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1887 he was elected to the [[legislature of the Hawaiian Kingdom]] as a representative from [[Hawaii (island)|Hawai{{okina}}i island]].&lt;ref name="card"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://archives1.dags.hawaii.gov/gsdl/collect/governme/index/assoc/HASH016c/205230a5.dir/Kinney,%20William%20A.jpg  |title= Kinney, William Ansel office record |work=state archives digital collections |publisher=state of Hawaii |accessdate= August 14, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
During the summer of 1887, he helped draft the [[1887 Constitution of the Kingdom of Hawaii]], called the "Bayonet Constitution" because King [[Kalākaua]] was forced to sign it. The government headed by [[Walter M. Gibson]] was forced to resign and was replaced by one including Thurston in the cabinet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=David W.

He moved to [[Salt Lake City, Utah]], about 1891 and practiced law there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Mrs. Caroline D. Kinney Passed Away March 25:She was the Mother of William A.

After [[Liliuokalani|Queen Lili{{okina}}uokalani]] was arrested in January 1895 following the failed [[1895 Counter-Revolution in Hawaii|1895 rebellion]] against the [[Republic of Hawaii]], Kinney was selected as [[Judge Advocate]] (with honorary rank of Captain) to prosecute her in a military trial in her former throne room at [[Iolani Palace|{{okina}}Iolani Palace]]. She was convicted of [[misprision of treason]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Abdication of Queen Liliuokalan: Safety at the Price of a Kingdom, of Little Moment Now for the Cause of the Royalists is a Lost Cause |newspaper= The Morning Call |location= San Francisco |date= February 7, 1895 |url=  http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn94052989/1895-02-07/ed-1/seq-1/ |accessdate= August 14, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
On March 7 he traveled to [[San Francisco]] to press charges against the people accused of shipping arms to the rebels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= More Exiles from Honolulu: The ex-Queen Refuses to Leave Her Residence While Serving the Term of Her Sentence |newspaper= [[New York Times]] |date= March 15, 1895 |url= https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1895/03/15/105977994.pdf |format= pdf |accessdate= August 14, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 5, 1897, he was selected for another commission to lobby for annexation to the United States. He traveled to [[Washington, DC]], and in reply to the Queen's protest was quoted with a comment that might sound racist by modern standards regarding native Hawaiians and Chinese and Japanese interests:&lt;blockquote&gt;Their future is one of two things, to pass under Asiatic or Anglo-Saxon control. If Asiatics dominate, the native must become a coolie, for certainly he cannot expect to be better off than the rank and file of the dominant race....It is a choice between the status of a white American laborer and that of an Asiatic coolie laborer. The white race, if Asiatics absorb Hawaii, can get out to their own country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Reply to Liliuokalani: Special Commissioner Kinney Discusses the Ex-Queen's Protest |newspaper= [[New York Times]] |date= June 20, 1897 |url= https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1897/06/20/105947014.pdf |format= pdf |accessdate= August 14, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This time US Secretary of State [[John Sherman (politician)|John Sherman]] signed a treaty with Kinney, Thurston, and [[New Hampshire]] lawyer Francis March Hatch on June 16, 1897.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author= Clarence Johnson  |editor= Otis Grant Hammond |title=  Francis March Hatch   |work= The Granite state monthly |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YchYAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA65 |date= August 1897 |publisher=Granite Monthly Company |pages= 63–70 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |work= The [[Morgan Report]]  |url= http://morganreport.org/mediawiki/index.php?title=1897_Annexation_Treaty |title= 1897 Hawaii Annexation Treaty |accessdate= August 14, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Treaty of Annexation was unanimously adopted by the Senate of the Republic of Hawaii on September 9, 1897.  The U.S. Senate passed it by vote of 42–21, the U.S. House of Representatives passed it by vote of 209–91, and President William McKinley signed it on July 7, 1898.

On his return, he heard that physician Jared Knapp Smith, brother of his former law partner who was then attorney general, had been killed on September 24, 1897. It was suspected to be in retaliation for ordering patients suspected of [[leprosy]] to exile in [[Kalaupapa Leprosy Settlement and National Historical Park|Kalaupapa]], which had ignited the [[Leper War on Kaua'i]] four years earlier. Kinney sailed to [[Kauai|Kaua{{okina}}i]] island and was appointed special prosecutor. A native Hawaiian suspect Kapea was arrested, tried on November 13, 1897, found guilty of first degree murder, and hanged on April 11, 1898.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |hdl= 10524/564 |title= Murder, a Trial, a Hanging: The Kapea Case of 1897–1898 |work= Hawaiian Journal of History |publisher=Hawaii Historical Society |volume= 42 |author1= Esther Kwon Arinaga |author2= Caroline Axtell Garrett |year= 2008 |pages= 201–230 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1900 he sued a newspaper editor for [[libel]].&lt;ref name="sues Gill for libel"&gt;{{cite news |title= A Criminal Libel Suit: Attorney Sues E. S. Gill Editor of Republican |newspaper= The Hawaiian Gazette |location= Honolulu |date= August 17, 1900 |url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83025121/1900-08-17/ed-1/seq-2/ |accessdate=2013-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In May 1901 he was sentenced to prison for contempt of court, but pardoned by [[Sanford B. Dole]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Executive Interference with Judicial Rights: Three Lawyers Sent to Prison for Contempt of Court Given Immediate Pardons |newspaper= The Honolulu Republican |date= May 26, 1901 |url=  http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85047165/1901-05-26/ed-1/seq-1/ |page= 1 |accessdate= August 14, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
His partnership was then called "Kinney, McClanahan &amp; Cooper", including [[Henry Ernest Cooper]] who had chaired the [[Committee of Safety (Hawaii)|Committee of Safety]] in 1893 and E. B. McClanahan.  At least one of their cases, "Territory of Hawaii vs. Cotton Brothers &amp; Company" of 1904 went to the [[United States Supreme Court]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=United States Supreme Court |title=United States Supreme Court records and briefs |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=riArAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=RA8-PA20 |year=1907 |pages=27–177}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1906 the firm replaced Cooper with S. H. Derby. In June 1909 he represented the [[Hawaiian Sugar Planters' Association]] in a conflict during a strike by Japanese workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Japanese Charge Burglary: Hawaiian Strike Leaders Retort to Prosecution for Conspiracy to Murder |newspaper= [[New York Times]] |date= June 19, 1909 |url= https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1909/06/19/101740162.pdf |format= pdf |accessdate= August 16, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite his role in her trial, on November 1909 Kinney served as an attorney for deposed Queen Lili{{okina}}uokalani in a [[United States Court of Claims]] case "Liliuokalani v. The United States".&lt;ref name="LvUS"&gt;{{cite wikisource|title=Liliuokalani v. The United States|author=[[United States Court of Claims]]|date=November 20, 1909}}&lt;/ref&gt; His partners are listed as Sidney Miller Ballou and Anderson. The case claimed that the Queen was due compensation for the taking of the [[crown land]]s of the kingdom. In the decision known as 45 Ct. Cl. 418 (1910), the case was dismissed on May 16, 1910. The issue continues to be controversial, known as the [[ceded lands]] issue. Kinney's grand-niece Rubellite Kawena Kinney Johnson filed a similar case 80 years later which was also dismissed on appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Rubellite Kinney Johnson, Plaintiff-appellant, v. the United States |work= United States Court of Appeals, Federal Circuit. - 976 F.2d 747 |date= August 10, 1992 |url= http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/976/747/48008/|accessdate= August 16, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kinney political cartoon 1912.jpg|thumb|right|Political cartoon of 1912 depicting Kinney on the shoulder of a governor going after sugarcane plantation interests]]
Kinney grew disenchanted with the territorial government. Instead of the labor reform he had hoped for, he considered the sugarcane plantation owners, known as the "[[Big Five (Hawaii)|Big Five]]", an [[oligopoly]] which continued to exploit cheap workers. By 1912 he joined with congressional delegate [[Jonah Kūhiō Kalaniana'ole|Jonah Kūhiō Kalaniana{{okina}}ole]] in public opposition to appointed [[governor of Hawaii|Territorial Governor]]  [[Walter F. Frear]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= United States Congress House Committee on the Territories |title=Hearing before the Committee on the Territories of the House of Representatives on leasing of land in Hawaii: Statements of B.G.

Kūhiō was the only territorial-wide elected official, although with no direct power. Earlier a firmly conservative Republican,&lt;ref name="UofM"/&gt; Kinney switched to the [[Democratic Party of Hawaii]]. When Democratic President [[Woodrow Wilson]] was elected in 1912, Kinney lobbied for a strong reformer to be swiftly appointed as governor. Kinney was attacked in the Hawaii press (controlled by Republicans), and characterized as proposing a [[carpetbagger]] for governor. Frear said "Mr. Kinney would do better if he stayed here and worked for the best interests of the Territory, instead of going to Washington and complaining."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Governor from Mainland Best!

Pinkham]]. Pinkham had not lived in Hawaii and but had represented plantation owners and other industrialists earlier.&lt;ref name="hjh"&gt;{{cite news |hdl= 10524/373 |title= The Controversial Appointment of Lucius Eugene Pinkham, Hawaii's First Democratic Governor |work= Hawaiian Journal of History |publisher=Hawaii Historical Society |volume= 17 |author= [[H.

By the end of 1913 he was living in [[California]], where he filed suit against [[Alexander &amp; Baldwin]], one of the Big Five who were agents for his in-laws' McBryde sugarcane plantation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Shareholders of M'Bryde in Session: Meeting of Sugar Plantation Company is Called to Take Action on Charges of Mismanagement Against Alexander &amp; Baldwin, Agents of the Company, by W.

In 1928 Kinney sued Utah Senator [[Reed Smoot]] and [[Mormon]] leader [[Heber Grant]], accusing them of trying to prevent his book from being published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Mormons Sued for Damages: Head of Church and U.S. Senator Smoot Charged with Conspiracy |newspaper= Sarasota Herald |date= May 20, 1928 |url= https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=n98cAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=H2QEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1356,926551&amp;dq=william+a+kinney&amp;hl=en |accessdate= August 14, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Sues Senator Smoot and Head of Mormons; Los Angeles Man Also Names 21 Concerns for "Conspiracy and Harassment" |newspaper= [[New York Times]] |date= February 4, 1893  |url= http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F00D14FE395C177A93C2AB178ED85F4C8285F9 |accessdate= August 15, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
He died sometime after 1930 in California.&lt;!-- suspected children Ansel McBryde Kinney born 1898, Harvard 1920,  PhD 1923, died February 1969, son Douglas McBryde Kinney --&gt;
