[[Image:Multiplexed Analogue Components transmission (simulation).jpg|thumb|300px|Simulated MAC signal. From left to right: digital data, chrominance and luminance]]
'''A-MAC''' carries the digital information: sound, data-teletext on an FM subcarrier at 7&amp;nbsp;MHz. Since the vision bandwidth of a standard MAC signal is 8.4&amp;nbsp;MHz, the horizontal resolution on A-MAC has to be reduced to make room for the 7&amp;nbsp;MHz carrier. ''A-MAC has not been used in service.''

== Technical details ==
MAC transmits luminance and chrominance data separately in time rather than separately in frequency (as other analog television formats do, such as composite video).

Audio and Scrambling (selective access)
* Audio, in a format similar to [[NICAM]] was transmitted digitally rather than as an FM subcarrier.
* The MAC standard included a standard scrambling system, EuroCrypt, a precursor to the standard DVB-CSA encryption system.

[[Image:Aerospaceplane.jpg|thumb|300px|''Aerospaceplane 1'' (artist conception). Lab research showed that hydrogen-fueled airbreathers could be used for space launch.]]

The [[US Air Force]]'s '''aerospaceplane''' project encompassed a variety of projects from 1958 until 1963 to study a fully reusable [[spaceplane]]. A variety of designs were studied during the lifetime of the project, including most of the early efforts on [[liquid air cycle engine]]s (LACE) and even a [[nuclear propulsion|nuclear-powered]] [[ramjet]].

The effort was started largely due to the work of Weldon Worth at the [[Wright-Patterson AFB]], who published a short work outlining a manned spaceplane. AF officials were interested enough to start SR-89774 ("SR" stands for "study requirement") for a reusable spaceplane in 1957. By 1959 this work had resulted in the '''Recoverable Orbital Launch System''', or '''ROLS''', based around a LACE engine, known at the time as a ''Liquid Air Collection System'', or ''LACES''.

Further work showed that more performance could be gained by extracting only the oxygen from the [[liquid air]], a system they referred to as ''Air Collection and Enrichment System'', or ''ACES''. A contract to develop an ACES [[testbed]] was placed with [[Marquardt Corporation|Marquardt]] and [[General Dynamics]], with [[Garrett AiResearch]] building the [[heat exchanger]] for cooling the air. The original ACES design was fairly complex; the air was first liquified in the heat exchanger cooled by [[liquid hydrogen]] fuel, then pumped into a low-pressure tank for short-term storage. From there it was then pumped into a high-pressure tank, where the oxygen was separated and the rest (mostly nitrogen) was dumped overboard. In late 1960 and early 1961 a 125 N demonstrator engine was being operated for up to 5 minutes at a time.

In early 1960 Air Force offered a development contract to build a spaceplane with a crew of three that could take off from any runway and fly directly into orbit and return. They wanted the design to be in operation in 1970 for a total development cost of only $5 billion. [[Boeing]], [[Douglas Aircraft|Douglas]], [[Convair]], [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]], [[Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company|Goodyear]], [[North American Aviation|North American]], and [[Republic Aviation|Republic]] all responded. Most of these designs ignored the ACES system and instead used a [[scramjet]] for power. The scramjet had first been outlined at about the same time as the original LACES design in a [[NASA]] paper of 1958, and many companies were highly interested in seeing it develop, perhaps none more than Marquardt, whose [[ramjet]] business was dwindling with the introduction of newer jet engines and who had already started work on the [[scramjet]]. Both [[Alexander Kartveli]] and [[Antonio Ferri]] were proponents of the scramjet approach. Ferri successfully demonstrated a scramjet producing net thrust in November 1964, eventually producing {{convert|517|lbf|kN}}, about 80% of his goal.

Later that year a review suggested that the basic concepts of the aerospaceplane were far too new for development of an operational system to begin. They pointed out that far too much was being spent on development of the aircraft, and not nearly enough on basic research. Moreover, the designs were all extremely sensitive to weight, and any increase (and there always is some) could result in all of the designs not working. In 1963 the Air Force changed their priorities in SR-651 and focused entirely on development of a variety of high-speed engines. Included were LACES and ACES engines, as well as scramjets, [[turboramjet]]s and a "normal" (subsonic-combustion) ramjet with an intake suitable for use up to [[Mach number|Mach]] 8. In October a further review concluded that the technology was simply too new for anyone to predict when any such aerospaceplane could ever be built, and funding was wound down in 1964.

'''Airplane mode''', '''aeroplane mode''',  '''flight mode''', '''offline mode''', or '''standalone mode''' is a setting available on [[smartphone]]s and other portable [[computer]]s that, when activated, suspends [[radio-frequency]] [[Signal (electrical engineering)|signal transmission]] by the device, thereby disabling [[Bluetooth]], [[Mobile telephony|telephony]], and [[Wi-Fi]]. GPS may or may not be disabled, because it does not involve transmitting radio waves.

The name comes from the prohibition by most of the [[airline]]s of using [[mobile phones on aircraft|equipment transmitting radio-frequency signal while in flight]]; using airplane mode prevents devices from transmitting.

When the "aeroplane mode" is activated, it disables all voice, text, telephone, and other signal-transmitting technologies such as [[Wi-Fi]] and [[Bluetooth]]. Wi-Fi and Bluetooth can be enabled separately even while the device is in airplane mode; this is acceptable on some aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204234|title=iOS: Understanding airplane mode|quote=If allowed by the aircraft operator and applicable laws and regulations, you can re-enable Wi-Fi and Bluetooth while in airplane mode|date={{date|2015-04-14|mdy}}|website=Apple Support}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://developer.android.com/reference/android/provider/Settings.Global.html#AIRPLANE_MODE_RADIOS|title=Android: AIRPLANE_MODE_RADIOS|quote=A comma separated list of radios that need to be disabled when airplane mode is on. This overrides WIFI_ON and BLUETOOTH_ON, if Wi-Fi and bluetooth are included in the comma separated list.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Receiving radio-frequency signals, as by [[radio receiver]]s and [[satellite navigation]] services, is not inhibited. However, even receiving telephone calls and messages without responding would require the phone to transmit.

In a revised review in October 2013, the United States [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA) made a recommendation on the use of electronic devices in "airplane mode"—cellular telephony is disabled, while Wi-Fi may be used if the carrier offers it. Short-range transmission such as Bluetooth is always permissible. The statement cites the common practice of aircraft operators whose aircraft can tolerate use of these personal electronic devices, but use may still be prohibited on some models of aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faa.gov/news/press_releases/news_story.cfm?newsId=15254|title=FAA to Allow Airlines to Expand Use of Personal Electronics|publisher=Federal Aviation Administration|date=2014-10-31|quote=Cell phones should be in airplane mode or with cellular service disabled—i.e., no signal bars displayed—and cannot be used for voice communications based on FCC regulations that prohibit any airborne calls using cell phones. If your air carrier provides Wi-Fi service during flight, you may use those services.  You can also continue to use short-range Bluetooth accessories, like wireless keyboards. [...] The PED Aviation Rulemaking Committee (ARC) concluded most commercial airplanes can tolerate radio interference signals from PEDs. In a recent report, they recommended that the FAA provide airlines with new procedures to assess if their airplanes can tolerate radio interference from PEDs. Once an airline verifies the tolerance of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use handheld, lightweight electronic devices—such as tablets, e-readers, and smartphones—at all altitudes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While in airplane mode, most devices allow the user to continue to use their [[email client]] or other program to write [[Text messaging|text]] or [[E-mail]] messages which are saved in memory to send when airplane mode is disabled.

Although it is not possible to make normal calls or send text in airplane mode, devices such as some [[Nokia]] [[smartphones]] allow the user to make calls to [[emergency service]]s even in airplane mode, while others do not.

As a side-effect, airplane mode reduces [[electric energy consumption|power consumption]] and increases battery endurance by shutting down the device's transmitters and receivers.

==Legal status in various nations==
{{update|chapter|time=2018-01-19|date=January 2018}}
* [[China]]: Prior to September 2017, all cell phones, even with Airplane mode, were never allowed to be used during the flight although other devices can be used while in cruising altitude. On September 18, 2017, the [[Civil Aviation Authority of China]] relaxed these rules and allowed all Chinese air carriers to allow the use of Portable Electronic Devices (PEDs) for the entire flight as long as they're in Aeroplane Mode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/china/policies-politics/article/2111724/chinese-air-passengers-could-soon-be-allowed-use|title=China’s air passengers could soon be allowed to use smartphones|author=|date=|website=scmp.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* [[Europe]]: On December 9, 2013, the [[European Aviation Safety Agency]] updated its guidelines on portable electronic devices (PEDs), allowing them to be used throughout the whole flight as long as they're set in Airplane mode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/news/Regulator-confirms-tablets-safe-to-use-during-take-off/|title=Regulator confirms tablets safe to use during take-off|first=Jolyon|last=Attwooll|date=5 February 2016|publisher=|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[India]]: On 23 April 2014, the [[Directorate General of Civil Aviation (India)|Directorate General of Civil Aviation]] (DGCA) amended the rule which bans use of portable electronic devices and allowing their usage in all phases of flight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/business/companies/dgca-allows-in-flight-use-of-mobile-phones-tablets-on-flight-mode/|title=DGCA allows in-flight use of mobile phones, tablets on flight mode|author=|date=23 April 2014|website=indianexpress.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Conversor Pro - for brochure.jpg|alt=Wireless assitive listening device|thumb|Using an assistive listening device to hear better in noisy environments]]
An '''Assistive listening device (ALD)''' is used to improve hearing ability for people in a variety of situations where they are unable to distinguish speech in noise.  Often in a noisy or crowded room it is almost impossible for an individual who is hard of hearing to distinguish one voice among many.  The hard of hearing listener has to distinguish between background noise, noise between them and the speaker and then there will be the effect of room acoustics on the quality of sound reaching their ears.  Hearing aids are able to amplify and process these sounds and improve the speech to noise ratio but if the sound is too distorted by the time it reaches the listener even the best hearing aids will struggle to unscramble the signal.

A common usage is to aid people who are [[Hearing Loss|hard of hearing (HOH)]]. by amplification and better sound to noise ratio (SNR).  The ALD may be used to help HOH people hear televisions and other audio devices and also to help people hear speech through [[public address]] (PA) systems such as in synagogue or at a lecture.

The assistive listening device usually uses a microphone to capture an audio source near to its origin and broadcast it [[wireless]]ly over an FM (Frequency Modulation) transmission, IR (Infra Red) transmission, IL (Induction Loop) transmission, or other transmission method.  The person who is listening may use an FM/IR/IL [[Receiver (radio)|Receiver]] to tune into the signal and listen at his/her preferred volume. There are also other consumer ALD such as alarm clocks with bed shakers, amplified stethoscopes, baby monitors and flashing door bell indicators.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://audiologysupplies.com/hearing-impaired-assistive-devices/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-01-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160205051051/http://audiologysupplies.com/hearing-impaired-assistive-devices |archive-date=2016-02-05 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most FM assistive listening devices operate on seventeen channels between 72.1000 and 75.800 MHz.&lt;ref&gt;http://w0is.com/miscpages/assistivelisteningdevicereceivers.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of a wireless microphone placed next to the speaker helps to reduce the effects of reverberation from poor room acoustics, bypasses the sounds between the speaker and the listener, eliminates the background noise by the listener, and by using a directional microphone reduces the background noise by the speaker.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.conversorproducts.com/the-benefits-of-alds/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''BITNET''' was a co-operative [[The United States of America|U.S.]] university computer network founded in 1981 by [[Ira Fuchs]] at the [[City University of New York]] (CUNY) and Greydon Freeman, Inc. at [[Yale University]].&lt;ref name=CREN&gt;{{cite web|title=A Brief History of "Bit.net"|url=http://bit.net/|website=Bit.net|accessdate=August 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first network link was between CUNY and Yale.

The name BITNET originally meant "Because It's There Network", but it eventually came to mean "Because It's Time Network". &lt;ref name="CailliauGillies2000"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Robert|last1=Cailliau|first2=James|last2=Gillies|title=How the Web Was Born: The Story of the World Wide Web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BCZhPwAACAAJ|date=1 January 2000|publisher=San Val, Incorporated|isbn=978-0-613-92163-3|pages=74, 75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A college or university wishing to join BITNET was required to lease a data circuit ([[phone line]]) from a site to an existing BITNET [[network node|node]], buy [[modem]]s for each end of the data circuit, sending one to the connecting point site, and allow other institutions to connect to its site free of charge.

==Technical details==
Bitnet's NJE (Network Job Entry) [[network protocol]]s, called [[RSCS]], were used for the huge [[IBM]] internal network known as [[VNET]]. BITNET links originally ran at 9600 [[baud]]. The BITNET [[Protocol (computing)|protocol]]s were eventually ported to non-IBM [[mainframe computer|mainframe]] [[operating system]]s, and became particularly widely implemented under [[VAX/VMS]], in addition to DECnet.

BITNET featured [[email]] and [[LISTSERV]] software, but predated the [[World Wide Web]], the common use of [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]], and [[Gopher (protocol)|Gopher]]. Gateways for the lists made them available on [[Usenet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hura |first=Gurdeep |date=28 March 2001 |title=Data and Computer Communications: Networking and Internetworking |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BViV0PoH_voC&amp;pg=PA779 |publisher=[[CRC Press]] |page=779 |isbn=9780849309281}}&lt;/ref&gt; BITNET also supported interactive transmission of files and messages to other users. A gateway service called [[TRICKLE]] enabled users to request files from Internet FTP servers in 64&amp;nbsp;Kb [[Uuencoding|UUencoded]] chunks. The ''Interchat Relay Network'', popularly known as [[Bitnet Relay]], was the network's [[instant messaging]] feature.

BITNET differed from the [[Internet]] in that it was a [[point-to-point (telecommunications)|point-to-point]] "[[store and forward]]" network. That is, [[email]] messages and files were transmitted in their entirety from one server to the next until reaching their destination. From this perspective, BITNET was more like [[UUCPNET]].

BITNET’s first electronic magazine, VM/COM, began as a [[University of Maine]] newsletter and circulated broadly in early 1984.  Two email newsletters that began as Bitnet newsletters in the fall of 1987 are known to still be transmitting. They are the Electronic Air and SCUP Email News (formerly SCUP Bitnet News).

BITNET's eligibility requirements limited exchange with commercial entities, including IBM itself, which made technical assistance and bug fixes difficult. This became a particular problem when trying to communicate on heterogeneous networks with graphical workstation vendors such as [[Silicon Graphics]].

==Extent==
At its zenith around 1991, BITNET extended to almost 500 organizations and 3,000 nodes, all educational institutions. It spanned North America (in Canada it was known as NetNorth), Europe (as [[European Academic Research Network|EARN]]), Israel (as [[ISRAEARN]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dhhumanist.org/Archives/Virginia/v04/1140.html |title=Humanist Archives Vol. 4 : 4.1144 Bitnet in Israel (1/69) |website=Dhhumanist.org |date=1991-03-08 |accessdate=2017-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; India ([[VIDYANET]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gadgets.ndtv.com/internet/news/as-emails-turn-40-scientists-recall-india-arrival-277436 |title=As emails turn 40, scientists recall India arrival &amp;#124; NDTV Gadgets360.com |website=Gadgets.ndtv.com |date=2012-10-09 |accessdate=2017-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some [[Persian Gulf]] states (as GulfNet).  BITNET was also very popular in other parts of the world, especially in South America, where about 200 nodes were implemented and heavily used in the late 1980s and early 1990s. With the rapid growth of [[Internet protocol suite|TCP/IP]] systems and the Internet in the early 1990s, and the rapid abandonment of the base IBM mainframe platform for academic purposes, BITNET's popularity and use diminished quickly.

==Legacy==
In 1984, a [[text-based]] BITNET game called [[MAD (MUD)|MAD]] became the first global [[MUD|Multi-User Dungeon]] (MUD).  Players connected from the United States, Europe or Israel to a single server running in France.

In 1996, [[Corporation for Research and Educational Networking|CREN]] ended their support for BITNET.  The individual nodes were free to keep their phone lines up as long as they wished, but as nodes dropped out, the network splintered into parts that were inaccessible from each other. As of 2007, BITNET has essentially ceased operation. However, a successor, BITNET II, which transmits information via the Internet using BITNET protocols, still has some users.

In [[building services engineering]] and [[HVAC]], a '''bell mouth''' is a tapered expanding or reducing opening in the end of a [[Ventilation (architecture)|ventilation]] duct, so named because the taper can resemble that of a [[Bell (instrument)|bell]] shape. They are primarily designed and used for return air or extract air purposes within building ventilation systems, more commonly located within ceiling voids or other similar [[Plenum chamber|plenum]]. The bellmouth cross-sectional area is normally double that of the duct area so that the air velocity entering the bellmouth is low (to reduce noise, turbulence and pressure drop), and gradually increases to the normal design velocity of the ductwork. The angle of the bellmouth is normally tapered at about 45° as a balance between keeping the bellmouth short without causing too much turbulence or excessive pressure drop. Bellmouths can be manufactured to suit either circular or rectangular ductwork sections.

The bell-mouth shape allows the maximum amount of air to be drawn into the duct with minimum loss.

[[File: Cosworth V8 F1 engine Brabham BT49.jpg|thumb|[[Cosworth DFV|Cosworth]] Formula One engine, with bell-mouthed inlet trumpets for each cylinder]]
A bell-mouth inlet duct is a form of convergent inlet air duct used to direct air into the inlet of a gas turbine engine. The area of a convergent duct gets smaller as the air flows into the engine. A bell-mouth inlet duct is extremely efficient and is used where there is little ram pressure available to force the air into the engine. Bell-mouth ducts are used in engine test cells and on engines installed in helicopters.

A '''bioship''' is a type of [[spacecraft]] or [[starship]] described in [[science fiction]].  Bioships differ from other types of spacecraft in that they are composed, either predominantly or totally, of [[biological component]]s, rather than being constructed from manufactured materials. Because of this, they nearly always have a distinctively [[organic (model)|organic]] look.

Bioships are usually quite powerful, and can often regenerate or heal damaged parts.  Some bioships are intelligent or sentient, and some are considered to be lifeforms. Like most organic beings, many bioships contain large amounts of "scaffolding" materials to keep their shape, such as the [[xylem]] in trees or [[bone]] and [[chitin]] in animals.

==In fiction==
In the science fiction [[short story]] "[[Specialist (short story)|Specialist]]" by [[Robert Sheckley]], published in 1953 in ''[[Galaxy (magazine)|Galaxy]]'' magazine, it is revealed that many galactic races are actually capable of symbiotic cooperation to become bioships, with each race forming a different part. Earth, apparently, is one of the planets inhabited by creatures that are supposed to function as FTL drives (Pushers), and, it is stated that all the conflicts and discontent of humanity are due to the fact that, while they have matured, they have nowhere to apply their true purpose. This story is perhaps the first mention of a bioship in science fiction.&lt;ref&gt;Noel Keyes, editor ''Contact: Man Faces Extraterrestrial Life'' New York:1963 Paperback Library, Inc. "Specialist" by Robert Sheckley (1953) Pages 153-166&lt;/ref&gt;

Volume 322 of the German [[Perry Rhodan]] magazine series, first published in November 1967, marks another very early appearance of the bioship concept in science fiction. The [[Dolan (bioship)|Dolans]] are powerful bioengineered combat spaceships that are grown from the same synthetic genetic material as their extraterrestrial commanders.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perrypedia.proc.org/wiki/Quelle:PR322 Perrypedia vol. 322: Ein Gigant erwacht] (A Giant Awakes) (German)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pr-materiequelle.de/begriffe/riss/risszei/r863.htm Schematic of a Dolan] [https://www.webcitation.org/5nXeBuwFT Archived]&lt;/ref&gt; Different types of bioships are a recurrent feature in later stages of the Perry Rhodan universe.

''[[The Night's Dawn Trilogy]]'': the Edenist [[The Night's Dawn Trilogy#Voidhawk|Voidhawk]] and Mercenary [[The Night's Dawn Trilogy#Blackhawk|Blackhawk]] are both advanced bioships (the latter being a genetic tailoring for combat of the former). Both types employ mental bonding to the captain. In the case of Voidhawks this is done by both the craft and captain gestating together and maintaining mental contact during their formative years. Blackhawks however are purchased as eggs and are bonded to the buyer who will become captain when the Blackhawk matures.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, Peter F. (1996). ''[[The Reality Dysfunction]].'' Pan Books (UK).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first novel of [[Julian May]]'s [[Saga of Pliocene Exile|Pliocene series]], ''[[The Many-Colored Land]]'' (1982), the backstory of two races of alien refugees living in the [[Earth]]'s [[Pliocene|Pliocene epoch]] describes their [[hard landing]] in a bioship. The bioship was emotionally bonded to one of the aliens (the "shipwife") and sacrificed its own life to safely deliver its passengers to the planet surface.&lt;ref&gt;May, J. C. (1982).

The '''Boeing YAL-1''' [[Airborne Laser]] Testbed (formerly Airborne Laser) weapons system was a megawatt-class [[chemical oxygen iodine laser]] (COIL) mounted inside a modified [[Boeing 747-400#747-400F|Boeing 747-400F]]. It was primarily designed as a [[missile defense]] system to destroy [[tactical ballistic missile]]s (TBMs) while in [[boost phase]].  The aircraft was designated '''YAL-1A''' in 2004 by the [[United States Department of Defense|U.S. Department of Defense]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/412015l.pdf |title=DoD 4120.15-L, Model Designation of Military Aerospace Vehicles |publisher= U.S Department of Defense |date=May 12, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The YAL-1 with a low-power laser was test-fired in flight at an airborne target in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.afmc.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123038913 |title=Airborne Laser returns for more testing |publisher=Air Force |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070308070103/http://www.afmc.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123038913 |archivedate=March 8, 2007 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A high-energy laser was used to intercept a test target in January 2010,&lt;ref name=ABL_2010_test /&gt; and the following month, successfully destroyed two test missiles.&lt;ref name="reuters"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN1111660620100212?type=marketsNews |title=U.S. successfully tests airborne laser on missile |publisher=reuters.com | first=Jim |last=Wolf |date=February 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Funding for the program was cut in 2010 and the program was canceled in December 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/blogs/aircraft-pictures/boeing-yal-1-airborne-laser/ |title=Boeing YAL-1 Airborne Laser impacted by Pentagon spending priorities |work=Flight Image of the Day |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131020012544/http://www.flightglobal.com/blogs/aircraft-pictures/boeing-yal-1-airborne-laser/ |archivedate=October 20, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It made its final flight on February 14, 2012 to [[Davis–Monthan Air Force Base]] in [[Tucson, Arizona]] to be kept in storage at the "[[Aircraft boneyard|Boneyard]]" by the [[309th Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group]]. It was ultimately scrapped in September 2014 after all usable parts were removed.

The Airborne Laser Laboratory was a less-powerful prototype installed in a [[Boeing NC-135|Boeing NKC-135A]].  It shot down several missiles in tests conducted in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/space/systems/all.htm|title= Airborne Laser Laboratory |publisher=globalsecurity.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Airborne Laser program was initiated by the [[United States Air Force|US Air Force]] in 1996 with the awarding of a product definition risk reduction contract to Boeing's ABL team.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boeing.com/special/abl/news/] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100722004407/http://www.boeing.com/special/abl/news/ |date=July 22, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="overview"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.boeing.com/defense-space/military/abl/doc_src/ABL_overview.pdf |title=Airborne Laser Background presentation |publisher=boeing.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070224135448/http://www.boeing.com/defense-space/military/abl/doc_src/ABL_overview.pdf |archivedate=February 24, 2007 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, the program was transferred to the MDA and converted to an acquisition program.&lt;ref name="overview" /&gt;

The development of the system was being accomplished by a team of contractors. [[Boeing Defense, Space &amp; Security]] provides the aircraft, the management team and the systems integration processes. [[Northrop Grumman]] was supplying the COIL, and [[Lockheed Martin]] was supplying the nose turret and the fire control system.&lt;ref name="overview" /&gt;&lt;ref name="atn1" /&gt;

In 2001, a retired [[Air India]] 747-200 was acquired by the air force, and trucked without its wings from the [[Mojave Spaceport|Mojave Airport]] to [[Edwards Air Force Base]] where the airframe was incorporated into the System Integration Laboratory (SIL) building at Edwards' Birk Flight Test Center, to be used to fit check and test the various components.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Radecki |first=Alan K. |title=A Mojave Scrapbook |publisher=Mojave Books |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aerotech070406"&gt;{{cite web |last=Hernandez |first=Jason |url=http://www.edwards.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123046780 |title=Testers end high-energy laser tests, dismantle Airborne Laser SIL facility |publisher=USAF press release |date=March 29, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080107124906/http://www.edwards.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123046780 |archivedate=January 7, 2008 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The SIL was built primarily to test the COIL at a simulated operational altitude, and during that phase of the program, the laser was operated over 50 times, achieving lasing durations representative of actual operational engagements. These tests fully qualified the system so that it could be integrated into the actual aircraft. Following the completion of the tests, the laboratory was dismantled, and the 747-200 fuselage was removed.&lt;ref name="aerotech070406" /&gt;

Boeing completed initial modifications to a new 747-400F off the production line in 2002, culminating in its first flight on July 18, 2002 from Boeing's [[Wichita, Kansas]] facility. Ground testing of the [[Chemical oxygen iodine laser|COIL]] resulted in its successful firing in 2004. The YAL-1 was assigned to the 417th Flight Test Squadron Airborne Laser Combined Test Force at Edwards AFB.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

=== Testing ===
Besides the COIL, the system also includes two kilowatt-class Target Illuminator Lasers for target tracking. On March 15, 2007, the YAL-1 successfully fired this laser in flight, hitting its target. The target was an [[Boeing NC-135|NC-135E]] ''Big Crow'' test aircraft that has been specially modified with a "signboard" target on its fuselage. The test validated the system's ability to track an airborne target and measure and compensate for atmospheric distortion.&lt;ref name="atn1" /&gt;

The next phase in the test program involved the "surrogate high-energy laser" (SHEL), a stand-in for the COIL, and demonstrated the transition from target illumination to simulated weapons firing.  The COIL system was installed in the aircraft and undergoing ground testing by July 2008.&lt;ref name="bbc1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7531046.stm|title=BBC NEWS – Science/Nature – 'Laser jumbo' testing moves ahead|work=bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an April 6, 2009 press conference, the [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] Robert Gates recommended the cancellation of the planned second ABL aircraft and said that the program should return to a Research and Development effort. "The ABL program has significant affordability and technology problems and the program's proposed operational role is highly questionable," Gates said in making the recommendation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2008997361_defensecuts07.html |title=Local News – Boeing "hit harder" than rivals by defense budget cuts – Seattle Times Newspaper |work=nwsource.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090410052937/http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2008997361_defensecuts07.html |archivedate=April 10, 2009 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was a test launch off the California coast on June 6, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalsecuritynewswire.org/gsn/nw_20090609_8318.php|title=Home Security Systems : My Home Security|work=globalsecuritynewswire.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time it was anticipated that the new Airborne Laser Aircraft could be ready for operation by 2013 after a successful test. On August 13, 2009 the first in-flight test of the YAL-1 culminated with a successful firing of the SHEL at an instrumented test missile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boeing.mediaroom.com/index.php?s=43&amp;item=796|title=Boeing Airborne Laser Team Completes 1st Airborne Test Against Instrumented Target Missile|work=mediaroom.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. Missile Defense Agency  (MDA) on August 18, 2009 successfully fired the high-energy laser aboard the aircraft in flight for the first time.   The YAL-1 took off from Edwards Air Force Base and fired its high-energy laser while flying over the California High Desert. The laser was fired into an onboard calorimeter, which captured the beam and measured its power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boeing.mediaroom.com/index.php?s=43&amp;item=803|title=Boeing: Boeing Airborne Laser Team Fires High-Energy Laser in Flight|work=mediaroom.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2010, the high-energy laser was used in-flight to intercept, although not destroy, a test ''Missile Alternative Range Target Instrument'' (MARTI) in the boost phase of flight.&lt;ref name="ABL_2010_test"&gt;[http://www.mda.mil/news/gallery_abl.html] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100128055002/http://www.mda.mil/news/gallery_abl.html |date=January 28, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  On February 11, 2010 in a test at Point Mugu Naval Air Warfare Center-Weapons Division Sea Range off the central California coast, the system successfully destroyed a liquid-fuel boosting ballistic missile. Less than an hour after that first missile had been destroyed, a second missile—a solid-fuel design—had, as announced by the MDA, been "successfully engaged", but not destroyed, and that all test criteria had been met. The MDA announcement also noted that ABL had destroyed an identical solid-fuel missile in flight eight days earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mda.mil/news/10news0002.html |title=Airborne Laser Testbed Successful in Lethal Intercept Experiment |publisher=U.S. Department of Defense Missile Defense Agency |date=February 11, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100215081702/http://www.mda.mil/news/10news0002.html |archivedate=February 15, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This test was the first time that a [[directed-energy weapon|directed-energy]] system destroyed a ballistic missile in any phase of flight.  It was later reported that the first February 11 engagement required 50% less dwell time than expected to destroy the missile, the second engagement on the solid-fuel missile, less than an hour later, had to be cut short before it could be destroyed because of a "beam misalignment" problem.&lt;ref&gt;''Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology'', February 22, 2010 , p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cancellation ===
[[File:YAL-1 AMARG.JPG|thumb|In storage with engines removed. Ultimately broken up on 25 September 2014.]]
Secretary of Defense [[Robert Gates|Gates]] summarized fundamental concerns with the practicality of the program concept: &lt;blockquote&gt;"I don't know anybody at the Department of Defense, Mr. Tiahrt, who thinks that this program should, or would, ever be operationally deployed. The reality is that you would need a laser something like 20 to 30 times more powerful than the chemical laser in the plane right now to be able to get any distance from the launch site to fire....So, right now the ABL would have to orbit inside the borders of Iran in order to be able to try and use its laser to shoot down that missile in the boost phase. And if you were to operationalize this you would be looking at 10 to 20 747s, at a billion and a half dollars apiece, and $100 million a year to operate. And there's nobody in uniform that I know who believes that this is a workable concept."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://csis.org/blog/missile-defense-umbrella |title=Missile Defense Umbrella? |publisher=[[Center for Strategic and International Studies]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110111093235/http://csis.org/blog/missile-defense-umbrella |archivedate=January 11, 2011 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Air Force did not request further funds for the Airborne Laser for 2010; Air Force Chief of Staff Schwartz has said that the system "does not reflect something that is operationally viable".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.airforcetimes.com/news/2010/02/airforce_budget_022610w/ |title=Schwartz: Get those AF boots off the ground |publisher=airforcetimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Hodge |first=Nathan |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704570104576124173372065568 |title=Pentagon Loses War To Zap Airborne Laser From Budget |publisher= ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' |date= 11 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2011, it was reported that the project was to be ended after 16 years of development and a cost of over US$5 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aviationweek.com/aw/generic/story_generic.jsp?channel=defense&amp;id=news%2Fasd%2F2011%2F12%2F21%2F02.xml&amp;headline=Lights+Out+For+The+Airborne+Laser|title=Lights Out For The Airborne Laser|author=Amy Butler|publisher=Aviation Week|date=21 December 2011}}{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; While in its current form, a relatively low power laser mounted on an unprotected airliner may not be a practical or defensible weapon, the YAL-1 testbed is considered to have proven that air mounted energy weapons with increased range and power could be another viable way of destroying otherwise very difficult to intercept sub-orbital ballistic missiles and rockets. On 12 February 2012, the YAL-1 flew its final flight and landed at [[Davis-Monthan AFB]], Arizona, where it was placed in storage at the [[AMARG]] until it was ultimately scrapped in September 2014 after all usable parts were removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.strategies-u.com/articles/2014/05/the-death-of-a-giant-laser.html|title=The Death of A Giant Laser|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/maps/@32.1547999,-110.8419426,93m/data=!3m1!1e3?hl=en|title=Google Maps|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2013, studies were underway to apply the lessons of the YAL-1 by mounting laser anti-missile defenses on [[unmanned combat aerial vehicle]]s that could fly above the altitude limits of the converted jetliner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aviationweek.com/Article/PrintArticle.aspx?id=/article-xml/asd_08_16_2013_p01-01-607382.xml&amp;p=1&amp;printView=true|title=MDA Eyes UAVs For Discrimination, Boost-Phase Kill|work=aviationweek.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2015, the [[Missile Defense Agency]] had started efforts to deploy a laser on a high-altitude UAV.  Rather than a manned jetliner containing chemical fuels flying at {{convert|40000|ft|km}}, firing a megawatt laser from a range of "tens of kilometers" at a boost-phase missile, the new concept envisioned an unmanned aircraft carrying an electric laser flying at {{convert|65000|ft|km}}, firing the same power level at targets potentially up to "hundreds of kilometers" away for survivability against air defenses.  While the ABL's laser required {{convert|55|kg|lb|abbr=on}} to generate one kW, the MDA wanted to reduce that to {{convert|2|-|5|kg|lb|abbr=on}} per kW, totaling {{convert|5,000|lb|kg|abbr=on}} for a megawatt.  Unlike the ABL, which required its crew to rest and chemical fuel to be reloaded, an electric laser would need only power generating from fuel to fire, so a UAV with in-flight refueling could have near-inexhaustible endurance and armament.  A "low-power demonstrator" has been planned to fly sometime in or around 2021.&lt;ref&gt;[http://breakingdefense.com/2015/08/return-of-the-abl-missile-defense-agency-works-on-laser-drone/ Return Of The ABL?

=== COIL ===
The heart of the system was the COIL, comprising six interconnected modules, each as large as an [[SUV]].  Each module weighed about 6,500 pounds (3,000&amp;nbsp;kg).  When fired, the laser produced enough energy in a five-second burst to power a typical American household for more than an hour.&lt;ref name="atn1"&gt;{{cite web|author=Grill, Tech. Sgt. Eric M. |url=http://www.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123045745 |title=Airborne Laser fires tracking laser, hits target |publisher=Air Force |date=March 21, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211212241/http://www.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123045745 |archivedate=December 11, 2008 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Use against ICBMs vs TBMs ===
[[File:Airbornelaserturret.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The US Air Force says the aircraft holds the world's largest turret assembly.]]

The ABL was designed for use against [[tactical ballistic missile]]s (TBMs). These have a shorter range and fly more slowly than [[ICBM]]s.  The MDA has recently suggested the ABL might be used against ICBMs during their boost phase. This could require much longer flights to get in position, and might not be possible without flying over hostile territory.  Liquid-fueled ICBMs, which have thinner skins, and remain in boost phase longer than TBMs, might be easier to destroy.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

If the ABL had achieved its design goals, it could have destroyed liquid-fueled ICBMs up to 600&amp;nbsp;km away.  Tougher solid-fueled ICBM destruction range would likely have been limited to 300&amp;nbsp;km, too short to be useful in many scenarios, according to a 2003 report by the [[American Physical Society]] on [[National Missile Defense]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aps.org/about/pressreleases/boosts2.cfm |title=APS Study |publisher=aps.org |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070213231108/http://www.aps.org/about/pressreleases/boosts2.cfm |archivedate=February 13, 2007 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Intercept sequence ===
The ABL system used infrared sensors for initial missile detection.  After initial detection, three low power tracking lasers calculated missile course, speed, aimpoint, and air turbulence.  Air turbulence deflects and distorts lasers.  The ABL [[adaptive optics]] use the turbulence measurement to compensate for atmospheric errors.  The main [[laser]], located in a turret on the aircraft nose, could be fired for 3 to 5 seconds, causing the missile to break up in flight near the launch area.  The ABL was not designed to intercept TBMs in the terminal, or descending, flight phase.  Thus, the ABL would have had been within a few hundred kilometers of the missile launch point.  All of this would have occurred in approximately 8 to 12 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airborne-laser.com/how_does_it_work.php|title=How Does it work - Airborne Laser|website=www.airborne-laser.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Operational considerations ===
[[File:Lasertests.jpg|thumb|upright|A technician evaluates the interaction of multiple lasers that will be used aboard the Airborne Laser.]]

The ABL did not burn through or disintegrate its target. It heated the missile skin, weakening it, causing failure from high speed flight stress. The laser used chemical fuel similar to rocket propellant to generate the high laser power. Plans called for each 747 to carry enough laser fuel for about 20 shots, or perhaps as many as 40 low-power shots against fragile TBMs. To refuel the laser, YAL-1 would have to land. The aircraft itself could have been refueled in flight, which would have enabled it to stay aloft for long periods. Preliminary operational plans called for the ABL to be escorted by fighters and possibly [[electronic warfare]] aircraft. The ABL aircraft would likely have had to orbit near potential launch sites (located in hostile countries) for long periods, flying a figure-eight pattern that allows the aircraft to keep the laser aimed toward the missiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Congress| title = Congressional Record| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=oj5jAMspUfAC&amp;pg=PA11290| year = 2011| publisher = Government Printing Office }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Use against other targets ===
In theory, an airborne laser could be used against hostile fighter aircraft, cruise missiles, or even low-earth-orbit satellites (see [[anti-satellite weapon]]). However, the YAL-1 infrared target acquisition system was designed to detect the hot exhaust of TBMs in boost phase. Satellites and other aircraft have a much lower heat signature, making them more difficult to detect. Aside from the difficulty of acquiring and tracking a different kind of target, ground targets such as armored vehicles and possibly even aircraft are not fragile enough to be damaged by a megawatt-class laser.

An analysis by the [[Union of Concerned Scientists]] discusses potential airborne laser use against low earth orbit satellites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ucsusa.org/global_security/space_weapons/asat-capabilities-of-us-missile-defense-systems.html |title=Anti-Satellite Capabilities of Planned US Missile Defense Systems |publisher=ucsusa.org |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051211090828/http://www.ucsusa.org/global_security/space_weapons/asat-capabilities-of-us-missile-defense-systems.html |archivedate=December 11, 2005 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another program, the [[Advanced Tactical Laser]], envisions air-to-ground use of a megawatt-class laser mounted on an aircraft better suited for low altitude flight.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

The '''Chilean moth''' (''Chilecomadia moorei'') is a [[moth]] of the [[Cossidae]] family. The '''butterworm''' is the [[larva]]l form and is commonly used as [[fishing bait]] in South America.&lt;ref name="Pavia"&gt;"The Incredible Edible Worm", by Audrey Pavia, ''Reptiles Magazine'', July, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Butterworms, like [[mealworm]]s, are used as [[food]] for [[insectivore]] pets, such as [[gecko]]s and other [[reptile]]s, as their scent and bright color help attract the more stubborn eaters. They are also called '''tebo worms''' or '''trevo worms''', and are high in fat and [[calcium]].  They are difficult to breed in captivity, and most are imported directly from [[Chile]]. They are usually [[irradiated]] to kill bacteria and prevent pupation as the moth is an invasive species.&lt;ref name="Pavia"/&gt;

'''Detonation''' ({{ety|la|detonare|to thunder down}}) is a type of [[combustion]] involving a [[supersonic]] exothermic front accelerating through a medium that eventually drives a [[shock front]] propagating directly in front of it.  Detonations occur in both conventional solid and liquid explosives,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fickett|last2= Davis|title=Detonation|publisher= Univ. California Press|year=1979|isbn= 978-0-486-41456-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in reactive gases.  The [[detonation velocity|velocity of detonation]] in solid and liquid explosives is much higher than that in gaseous ones, which allows the wave system to be observed with greater detail (higher [[Image resolution|resolution]]).

A very wide variety of fuels may occur as gases, droplet fogs, or dust suspensions.  Oxidants include halogens, ozone, hydrogen peroxide and oxides of nitrogen.  Gaseous detonations are often associated with a mixture of fuel and oxidant in a composition somewhat below conventional flammability ratios.  They happen most often in confined systems, but they sometimes occur in large vapor clouds.  Other materials, such as [[acetylene]], [[ozone]], and [[hydrogen peroxide]] are detonable in the absence of [[dioxygen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stull|title=Fundamentals of fire and explosion|publisher=A.I.Chem.E.|series=Monograph Series|volume=10|page=73|year=1977|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zcBTAAAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bretherick's Handbook of Reactive Chemical Hazards|publisher=Butterworths|location=London|year=2006|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/book/9780123725639|isbn=978-0-12-372563-9|first1=Peter |last1=Urben |first2= Leslie|last2= Bretherick|edition=7th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Detonation was discovered in 1881 by two pairs of French scientists [[Marcellin Berthelot]] and P. Vieille&lt;ref&gt;6 M. Berthelot and P. Vieille, “On the velocity of propagation of explosive processes in gases,” Comp. Rend. Hebd. Séances Acad. Sci., Vol. 93, pp. 18-21, 1881&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ernest-François Mallard]] and [[Henry Louis Le Chatelier]].&lt;ref&gt;5 E. Mallard and H. L.

Doin.&lt;/ref&gt; The next advance in understanding detonation was made by [[Zel'dovich]], [[von Neumann]], and [[W. Doering]] in the early 1940s.

== Theories ==
The simplest theory to predict the behaviour of detonations in gases is known as [[Chapman-Jouguet condition|Chapman-Jouguet]] (CJ) theory, developed around the turn of the 20th century.  This theory, described by a relatively simple set of algebraic equations, models the detonation as a propagating shock wave accompanied by exothermic heat release.  Such a theory confines the chemistry and diffusive transport processes to an [[infinitesimal]]ly thin zone.

A more complex theory was advanced during World War II independently by [[Zel'dovich]], [[von Neumann]], and [[W. Doering]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zel'dovich |last2= Kompaneets|title=Theory of Detonation|publisher=Academic Press|location= New York|year=1960|asin= B000WB4XGE|oclc=974679}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|year=1942|last=von Neumann|first=John|title=Progress report on "Theory of Detonation Waves"|id= OSRD Report No. 549.

With a reference frame of a stationary shock, the following flow is subsonic, so that an acoustic reaction zone follows immediately behind the lead front, the [[Chapman-Jouguet condition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Chapman |first=David Leonard |title=On the rate of explosion in gases |journal=Philosophical Magazine |location=London |series=Series 5 |volume=47 |issue=284 |pages=90–104 |date=January 1899 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N4u8y0Kf8NQC&amp;pg=PA90#v=onepage&amp;f=false |issn=1941-5982 |lccn=sn86025845 |doi=10.1080/14786449908621243}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jouguet|url=http://math-doc.ujf-grenoble.fr/JMPA/PDF/JMPA_1905_6_1_A9_0.pdf|first=Jacques Charles Emile|title=Sur la propagation des réactions chimiques dans les gaz|journal=Journal des Mathématiques Pures et Appliquées|series=6|volume=1|pages=347–425|year=1905|trans-title=On the propagation of chemical reactions in gases|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019171453/http://math-doc.ujf-grenoble.fr/JMPA/PDF/JMPA_1905_6_1_A9_0.pdf|archivedate=2013-10-19|df=}} Continued in Continued in {{cite journal|last=Jouguet|first=Jacques Charles Emile|journal=Journal des Mathématiques Pures et Appliquées|series=6|volume=2|pages=5–85|year=1906|url=http://sites.mathdoc.fr/JMPA/PDF/JMPA_1906_6_2_A1_0.pdf|title=Sur la propagation des réactions chimiques dans les gaz|trans-title=On the propagation of chemical reactions in gases|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016140100/http://sites.mathdoc.fr/JMPA/PDF/JMPA_1906_6_2_A1_0.pdf|archivedate=2015-10-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
There is also some evidence that the reaction zone is semi-metallic in some explosives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1038/nphys806 | title = A transient semimetallic layer in detonating nitromethane | year = 2007 | last1 = Reed | first1 = Evan J. | last2 = Riad Manaa | first2 = M. | last3 = Fried | first3 = Laurence E. | last4 = Glaesemann | first4 = Kurt R. | last5 = Joannopoulos | first5 = J.

Both theories describe one-dimensional and steady wave fronts.  However, in the 1960s, experiments revealed that gas-phase detonations were most often characterized by unsteady, three-dimensional structures, which can only in an averaged sense be predicted by one-dimensional steady theories. Indeed, such waves are quenched as their structure is destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Edwards, D.H. |author2=Thomas, G.O. |author3=Nettleton, M.A. |lastauthoramp=yes |title=The Diffraction of a Planar Detonation Wave at an Abrupt Area Change|journal=Journal of Fluid Mechanics|volume= 95|issue=1|pages =79–96|year= 1979|doi=10.1017/S002211207900135X|bibcode = 1979JFM....95...79E }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.2514/5.9781600865497.0341.0357 |volume=75 |journal=Progress in Astronautics &amp; Aeronautics|year=1981|title=Diffraction of a Planar Detonation in Various Fuel-Oxygen Mixtures at an Area Change|isbn=978-0-915928-46-0|pages=341|editors=A.

Experimental studies have revealed some of the conditions needed for the propagation of such fronts. In confinement, the range of composition of mixes of fuel and oxidant and self-decomposing substances with inerts are slightly below the flammability limits and for spherically expanding fronts well below them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Nettleton|first=M.

Mathematical modeling has steadily advanced to predicting the complex flow fields behind shocks inducing reactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Oran |last2= Boris| title=Numerical Simulation of Reactive Flows|publisher= Elsevier Publishers|year=1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Sharpe, G.J. |author2=Quirk, J.J.|title=Nonlinear cellular dynamics of the idealized detonation model: Regular cells|journal=Combustion Theory and Modelling|volume= 12|issue= 1|pages=1–21|year= 2008|doi=10.1080/13647830701335749
|bibcode=2007CTM....12....1S}}&lt;/ref&gt; To date, none has adequately described how structure is formed and sustained behind unconfined waves.

== Applications ==

When used in explosive devices, the main cause of damage from a detonation is the supersonic blast front (a powerful [[shock wave]]) in the surrounding area. This is a significant distinction from [[deflagration]]s where the exothermic wave is subsonic and maximum pressures are at most one eighth{{Citation needed|date = February 2010}} as great. Therefore, detonation is most often used for explosives and the acceleration of projectiles.  However, detonation waves may also be used for less destructive purposes, including deposition of coatings to a surface&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Nikolaev, Yu.A. |author2=Vasil'ev, A.A. |author3=Ul'yanitskii |author4=B.Yu. |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Gas Detonation and its Application in Engineering and Technologies (Review)|journal=Combustion, Explosion, and Shock Waves|volume= 39|issue= 4|pages=382–410|year= 2003|doi=10.1023/A:1024726619703}}&lt;/ref&gt; or cleaning of equipment (e.g. slag removal&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Huque, Z. |author2=Ali, M.R. |author3=Kommalapati, R. |lastauthoramp=yes|title=Application of pulse detonation technology for boiler slag removal|journal=Fuel Processing Technology|volume= 90|issue= 4|pages=558–569|year= 2009|doi=10.1016/j.fuproc.2009.01.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and even [[explosive welding|explosively welding]] together metals that would otherwise fail to fuse.

== In engines and firearms ==
Unintentional detonation when [[deflagration]] is desired is a problem in some devices.  In internal combustion engines it is called [[engine knocking]] or pinging or pinking, and it causes a loss of power, excessive heating, and eventual engine failure in some cases.&lt;ref&gt;[[Engine knocking#Abnormal combustion]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=May 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hpacademy.com/technical-articles/dont-waste-your-time-listening-for-knock/&lt;/ref&gt; In firearms, it may cause catastrophic and potentially lethal failure.

== Etymology ==
In classical Latin, ''detonare'' means "to stop thundering", as in weather. The modern meaning developed later.

A '''diode-OR circuit''' is used in electronics to isolate two or more voltage sources.  There are two typical implementations:

When a DC supply voltage needs to be generated from one of a number of different sources, for example when terminating a [[parallel SCSI]] bus, a very simple circuit like this can be used:

[[Image:Diode-OR.png]]

In [[digital circuit|digital electronics]] a diode-OR circuit is used to derive a simple Boolean logic function.  This kind of circuit was once very common in [[diode–transistor logic]] but has been largely replaced by [[CMOS]] in modern electronics:

This allowed the eNose to then smell novel odorants it never encountered before, yet still generate odor pleasantness estimates in high agreement with human assessments regardless of the subject's cultural background. This suggests an innate component of odorant pleasantness that is tightly linked to molecular structure&lt;ref&gt;Haddad et al., doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000740&lt;/ref&gt;]]

An '''electronic nose''' is a device intended to detect [[odor]]s or [[flavor]]s.

Over the last decades, "electronic sensing" or "e-sensing" technologies have undergone important developments from a technical and commercial point of view. The expression "electronic sensing" refers to the capability of reproducing human senses using sensor arrays and [[pattern recognition]] systems.
Since 1982,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/299352a0 |title=Analysis of discrimination mechanisms in the mammalian olfactory system using a model nose |year=1982 |last1=Persaud |first1=Krishna |last2=Dodd |first2=George |journal=Nature |volume=299 |issue=5881 |pages=352–5 |pmid=7110356}}&lt;/ref&gt; research has been conducted to develop technologies, commonly referred to as electronic noses, that could detect and recognize odors and flavors. The stages of the recognition process are similar to human [[olfaction]] and are performed for identification, comparison, [[Quantification (science)|quantification]] and other applications, including [[Computer data storage|data storage]] and retrieval. However, [[hedonic]] evaluation is a specificity of the human nose given that it is related to subjective opinions. These devices have undergone much development and are now used to fulfill industrial needs.

==Other techniques to analyze odors==
In all industries, odor assessment is usually performed by human sensory analysis, by [[Molecular sensor|chemosensor]]s, or by [[gas chromatography]]. The latter technique gives information about [[volatile organic compound]]s but the correlation between analytical results and meme odor perception is not direct due to potential interactions between several odorous components.

In the [[Wasp Hound]] odor detector, the mechanical element is a video camera and the biological element is five parasitic wasps who have been conditioned to swarm in response to the presence of a specific chemical.&lt;ref name=scicentr&gt;{{cite web|title=Wasp Hound |url=http://www.sciencentral.com/articles/view.php3?article_id=218392717 |publisher=Science Central |accessdate=23 February 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716014856/http://www.sciencentral.com/articles/view.php3?article_id=218392717 |archivedate=16 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Scientist [[Alexander Graham Bell]] popularized the notion that it was difficult to measure a smell,&lt;ref name="chemos"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chemosensory.com/chemosense/chemosense-Sept03.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-08-22 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331020759/http://www.chemosensory.com/chemosense/chemosense-Sept03.pdf |archivedate=2012-03-31 |df= }}{{full citation needed|date=March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1914 said the following:
{{quote|Did you ever measure a smell? Can you tell whether one smell is just twice strong as another? Can you measure the difference between two kinds of smell and another? It is very obvious that we have very many different kinds of smells, all the way from the odour of violets and roses up to asafetida.
But until you can measure their likeness and differences, you can have no science of odour. If you are ambitious to find a new science, measure a smell.|Alexander Graham Bell|1914&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/chemse/25.4.429 |title=Quantification of Odor Quality |year=2000 |last1=Wise |first1=P. M. |journal=Chemical Senses |volume=25 |issue=4 |pages=429–43 |pmid=10944507 |last2=Olsson |first2=MJ |last3=Cain |first3=WS}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
In the decades since Bell made this observation, no such science of odor materialised, and it was not until the 1950s and beyond that any real progress was made.&lt;ref name="chemos" /&gt;

==Working principle==

The electronic nose was developed in order to mimic human olfaction that functions as a non-separative mechanism: i.e. an odor / flavor is perceived as a global fingerprint.
Essentially the instrument consists of head space sampling, sensor array, and pattern recognition modules, to generate signal pattern that are used for characterizing odors.

Electronic noses include three major parts: a sample delivery system, a detection system, a computing system.

The sample delivery system enables the generation of the headspace (volatile compounds) of a sample, which is the fraction analyzed. The system then injects this headspace into the detection system of the electronic nose. The sample delivery system is essential to guarantee constant operating conditions.

The detection system, which consists of a sensor set, is the "reactive" part of the instrument. When in contact with volatile compounds, the sensors react, which means they experience a change of electrical properties.

In most electronic noses, each sensor is sensitive to all volatile molecules but each in their specific way. However, in bio-electronic noses, receptor proteins which respond to specific odor molecules are used. Most electronic noses use [[sensor array]]s that react to volatile compounds on contact: the [[adsorption]] of volatile compounds on the sensor surface causes a physical change of the sensor. A specific response is recorded by the electronic interface transforming the signal into a digital value. Recorded data are then computed based on statistical models.&lt;ref name=alphamos&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alpha-mos.com/technology/instruments.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081023013258/http://www.alpha-mos.com/technology/instruments.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2008-10-23|title=Sensory expert and Analytical Instruments|work=alpha-mos.com|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bio-electronic noses use [[olfactory receptors]] - proteins cloned from biological organisms, e.g. humans, that bind to specific odor molecules. One group has developed a bio-electronic nose that mimics the signaling systems used by the human nose to perceive odors at a very high sensitivity: femtomolar concentrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.bios.2012.03.012 |title=Nanovesicle-based bioelectronic nose platform mimicking human olfactory signal transduction |year=2012 |last1=Jin |first1=Hye Jun |last2=Lee |first2=Sang Hun |last3=Kim |first3=Tae Hyun |last4=Park |first4=Juhun |last5=Song |first5=Hyun Seok |last6=Park |first6=Tai Hyun |last7=Hong |first7=Seunghun |journal=Biosensors and Bioelectronics |volume=35 |pages=335–41 |pmid=22475887 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The more commonly used sensors for electronic noses include 
* [[metal–oxide–semiconductor]] (MOSFET) devices - a transistor used for amplifying or switching electronic signals. This works on the principle that molecules entering the sensor area will be charged either positively or negatively, which should have a direct effect on the electric field inside the MOSFET. Thus, introducing each additional charged particle will directly affect the transistor in a unique way, producing a change in the MOSFET signal that can then be interpreted by pattern recognition computer systems. So essentially each detectable molecule will have its own unique signal for a computer system to interpret.
* [[conducting polymer]]s - organic polymers that conduct electricity.&lt;ref&gt;Summary of electronic nose technologies - Andrew Horsfield {{vs|need more bibliographic info|date=March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some devices combine multiple sensor types in a single device, for example polymer coated QCMs.  The independent information leads to vastly more sensitive and efficient devices.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chem.ucla.edu/dept/Faculty/gimzewski/publications/219_2010_SensorsActuatorsB.pdf{{full citation needed|date=March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, other types of electronic noses have been developed that utilize mass spectrometry  or ultra-fast gas chromatography as a detection system.&lt;ref name=alphamos/&gt;

The computing system works to combine the responses of all of the sensors, which represents the input for the data treatment. This part of the instrument performs global fingerprint analysis and provides results and representations that can be easily interpreted. Moreover, the electronic nose results can be correlated to those obtained from other techniques (sensory panel, [[Gas chromatography|GC]], [[GC/MS]]). Many of the data interpretation systems are used for the analysis of results.  These systems include [[artificial neural network]] (ANN)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Skarysz|first=Angelika|date=July 2018|title=Convolutional neural networks for automated targeted analysis of raw gas chromatography-mass spectrometry data|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/324921031_Convolutional_neural_networks_for_automated_targeted_analysis_of_raw_gas_chromatography-mass_spectrometry_data|journal=International Joint Conferences on Neural Networks (2018) Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[fuzzy logic]], pattern recognition modules, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.economist.com/node/5571438 | work=The Economist | title=What the nose knows | date=9 March 2006 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110531131659/http://www.economist.com/node/5571438 | archivedate=31 May 2011 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Performing an analysis==
As a first step, an electronic nose needs to be trained with qualified samples so as to build a database of reference. Then the instrument can recognize new samples by comparing a volatile compound's fingerprint to those contained in its database. Thus they can perform qualitative or quantitative analysis. This however may also provide a problem as many odors are made up of multiple different molecules, which may be wrongly interpreted by the device as it will register them as different compounds, resulting in incorrect or inaccurate results depending on the primary function of a nose.&lt;ref&gt;Summary of electronic nose technologies{{vs|need more bibliographic info|date=March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
[[File:Enose prototype Analytical Dept Chemical Faculty GUT Gdansk.jpg|thumb|Electronic nose developed in Analytical Chemistry Department (Chemical Faculty of [[Gdańsk University of Technology]]) allows for rapid classification of food or environmental samples]]
Electronic nose instruments are used by research and development laboratories, quality control laboratories and process &amp; production departments for various purposes:

===In quality control laboratories===
* Conformity of raw materials, intermediate and final products
* Batch to batch consistency
* Detection of contamination, spoilage, adulteration
* Origin or vendor selection
* Monitoring of storage conditions.

===In process and production departments===
* Managing raw material variability
* Comparison with a reference product
* Measurement and comparison of the effects of manufacturing process on products
* Following-up cleaning in place process efficiency
* Scale-up monitoring
* Cleaning in place monitoring.

===Possible and future applications in the fields of health and security===
* The detection of dangerous and harmful bacteria, such as software that has been specifically developed to recognise the smell of the MRSA ([[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1186/1475-925X-5-65 |year=2006 |last1=Dutta |first1=Ritaban |last2=Dutta |first2=Ritabrata |journal=BioMedical Engineering OnLine |volume=5 |page=65 |pmid=17176476 |title=Intelligent Bayes Classifier (IBC) for ENT infection classification in hospital environment |pmc=1764885}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also able to recognise methicillinsusceptible S. aureus (MSSA) among many other substances.

===Possible and future applications in the field of crime prevention and security===
* The ability of the electronic nose to detect odorless chemicals makes it ideal for use in the police force, such as the ability to detect drug odors despite other airborne odors capable of confusing police dogs. However this is unlikely in the near term as the cost of the electronic nose is quite high.
* It may also be used as a bomb detection method in airports. Through careful placement of several or more electronic noses and effective computer systems, one could triangulate the location of bombs to within a few metres of their location in less than a few seconds.

===In environmental monitoring===
*For identification of volatile organic compounds in air, water and soil samples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eponline.com/articles/2006/11/01/a-sensitive-electronic-nose.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-08-22 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008180556/http://eponline.com/articles/2006/11/01/a-sensitive-electronic-nose.aspx |archivedate=2011-10-08 |df= }}{{full citation needed|date=March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It improves understanding of critical sources, leading to pro-active odor management.   Real time modeling will present the current situation, allowing the operator to understand which periods and conditions are putting the facility at risk. Also, existing commercial systems can be programmed to have active alerts based on set points (odor concentration modeled at receptors/alert points or odor concentration at a nose/source) to initiate appropriate actions.

The "'''Environmental Impact of the Big Cypress Swamp Jetport'''", unofficially known as the "Leopold Report" or the "Leopold-Marshall Report", was a report authored by hydrologist [[Luna Leopold]] of the [[United States Geological Service]] for the [[Department of the Interior]] and officially released on September 17, 1969.  [[Arthur R. Marshall]], formerly of the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service]], helped draft the report.  It is considered the first ecological impact report in the state of Florida.&lt;ref&gt;Gunderson et al. 1995, p. 128&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
On June 2, 1969, [[Walter Hickel]], [[United States Secretary of the Interior|Secretary of the Interior]] in the [[Nixon administration]], created a [[Select or special committee (United States Congress)|select committee]] to conduct an inquiry into a proposed jetport&lt;ref&gt;McPherson et al. 1976, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; for [[supersonic transport]] in what is now known as the [[Big Cypress National Preserve]] on the border of the [[Everglades National Park]] in [[Florida]].  The proposed Everglades Jetport would have had six runways for [[supersonic aircraft]], making it the largest airport in the world at the time.  [[Russell E. Train]], then undersecretary of the Department of the Interior, appointed Luna Leopold of the USGS to direct the [[environmental impact assessment]].&lt;ref&gt;Davis 2009, p. 485&lt;/ref&gt;  Before the report was published, Wisconsin Senator [[Gaylord Nelson]] leaked key conclusions from the report&lt;ref&gt;Davis 2003, p. 64; See also Davis 2009, pp. 487&amp;ndash;488&lt;/ref&gt; in defense of the Everglades: "Either we stop the jetport at the present site, or we publicly admit that we are going to destroy the park."&lt;ref&gt;Vileisis 1999, p. 224; Vileisis quotes Blake 1980, p. 219&lt;/ref&gt;

==Findings==
[[File:South Florida Big Cypress Swamp.jpg|thumb|Location of the proposed jetport within a {{convert|101|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} area selected by the Port Authority.&lt;ref&gt;McPherson et al. 1976, p. 5; Figure 1, Map of south Florida showing the location of the jetport in the Big Cypress Swamp.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
When the report was finally released, Leopold began by stating his strong opposition to the plan:  "Development of the proposed jetport and its attendant facilities will lead to land drainage and development for agriculture, transportation, and services in the Big Cypress Swamp which will inexorably destroy the south Florida ecosystem and thus the Everglades National Park."&lt;ref name=Davis488&gt;Davis 2009, p. 488&lt;/ref&gt;  A report from the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] was subsequently published the next day supporting the findings of the Leopold report.&lt;ref name=Davis488/&gt;

==Outcome==
Because the jetport did not meet the necessary standards, Walter Hickel opposed it. Hickel successfully defeated the construction of the jetport by preventing it from being listed by the Department of Transportation for funding under an airport development program.&lt;ref&gt;Warshaw 1996, p. 61&lt;/ref&gt;  Although construction of only one runway was completed, the remains of the Everglades Jetport was later opened as the [[Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport]] and is sometimes used as an aviation training facility.

'''Gambia Film Unit''' was an agency of the [[Politics of the Gambia|Gambian government]] that produced short films and showed them in remote parts of [[The Gambia]]. It was founded in 1967 and led by Ebrima Sagnia from 1972. It was merged into Gam TV, a predecessor to the [[Gambia Radio &amp; Television Service]] (GRTS), in 1995.

== History ==
The Gambia Film Unit was founded in 1967 as a cinema projection unit in the Department of Agriculture. [[Oxfam]] donated a camera and projection equipment, and the Department acquired a [[Land Rover]] with a built-in power generator. The unit produced short films on various topics that it then showed to people in villages. One film, 'Two Years of Progress', highlighted the government's achievements in the two years following independence. In 1969, the unit was transferred to the control of the Department of Information. Following this transfer, it began producing films on topics such as health, nutrition, the 1973 census, and the 1978 state visit of the [[President of Nigeria]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0004/000442/044234eo.pdf|title=Gambia Film Unit: Project Findings and Recommendations|last=|first=|date=1981|website=United Nations|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=6 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1969, Ebrima Sagnia was sent on a production course at the [[London Film School]], returning in 1972 to head the unit. The unit acted in the place of a television service in remote parts of The Gambia. Early production was hampered by a lack of laboratory facilities and editing equipment, and the lack of trained Gambians in this field. Due to these conditions, the government requested assistance from the [[United Nations Development Programme|UN Development Programme]] for the expansion of the unit. An expert from the UNDP began working with the unit in July 1972. In 1975, a black and white film laboratory and the training of technicians were also provided for.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 1981, the unit was able to capture footage of the [[1981 Gambian coup d'etat|coup d'etat attempt]] that was used by news media across the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://thepoint.gm/africa/gambia/article/ebrima-e-sagnia-1942-2012-pioneer-cinematographer-media-administrator|title=Ebrima E. Sagnia (1942-2012) Pioneer Cinematographer, media administrator|last=|first=|date=20 April 2012|work=The Point|access-date=4 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The unit held an important role in Gambian media, alongside Radio Gambia and the Gambia News Bulletin. The unit became part of Gam TV, The Gambia's first TV station, which was shortlived before it became itself part of [[Gambia Radio &amp; Television Service]] (GRTS) in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://thepoint.gm/africa/gambia/article/court-overturns-udp-activists-conviction|title=Court overturns UDP activist’s conviction|last=|first=|date=5 December 2017|work=The Point|access-date=6 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.kairabanews.com/uncategorized/history-of-television-services-in-the-gambia/|title=History Of Television Services In The Gambia.|last=|first=|date=30 April 2015|work=Kairaba News|access-date=6 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sagnia and others involved in the unit have since been described as "pioneers" of Gambian film by Gambian filmmaker [[Prince Bubacarr Aminata Sankanu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://whatson-gambia.com/news/headline-news/1191-nollywood-actors-try-to-steal-the-history-of-our-gambian-film-industry|title=Nollywood actors try to steal the history of our Gambian film industry|last=|first=|date=11 November 2015|work=What's On Gambia|access-date=4 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Glen Davis Shale Oil Works''' was a [[shale oil extraction]] plant in [[Glen Davis, New South Wales]], Australia which operated from 1940 until 1952 and was the last [[oil shale in Australia|oil-shale operation in Australia]] until the [[Stuart Oil Shale Project]] in the late 1990s.&lt;ref name=dyni&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; although the basis of this project was the 1934 report of the [[Newnes Investigation Committee]], which looked at ways to decrease the number of unemployed miners in the region.&lt;ref name=herald170652/&gt; The project was operated by National Oil Proprietary Pty. Ltd.,&lt;ref name=kraemer/&gt; a company created as a [[special purpose vehicle]] by G. F. Davis of Davis Gelantine. A public notice in the ''[[Commonwealth of Australia Gazette]]'', on 28 May 1936, invited offers for developing the oil industry in the Glen Davis area.&lt;ref name=ratification/&gt; The company was established by private interests with financial support from the [[Commonwealth of Australia]] and [[New South Wales]] governments.&lt;ref name=kraemer/&gt;

Construction of the shale oil works started in 1938 and the plant was commissioned in 1939, with operations starting on 3 January 1940.&lt;ref name=magi/&gt;&lt;ref name=kraemer&gt;

In 1942, under the [[National Security Act (Australia)|National Security Act]], the government took over the company and in August 1949 acquired the private shareholdings. After expansion in 1946, a shortage of mined shale reduced its output. In December 1950, it was decided to end the project.

The {{convert|55000|acre}} mining and shale oil extraction complex was located in Gindantherie, Goolloinboin, Barton, Glen Alice, and [[Capertee, New South Wales|Capertee]] parishes of [[Cook County, New South Wales|Cook]] and [[Hunter County|Hunter]] counties.&lt;ref name=ratification/&gt; The plant used [[Room and pillar|room-and-pillar]] mining techniques, and employed 170&amp;nbsp;miners.&lt;ref name=kraemer/&gt; The shale was crushed by a Pennsylvania single-roll type crusher and was then conveyed into the retorts.&lt;ref name=kraemer/&gt;

The company planned to use two tunnel ovens, each with a daily capacity of 336&amp;nbsp;tons, designed by ''[[AS Franz Krull]]'' of Estonia and ''[[Lurgi AG]]'' of Germany, similar to those used by some [[oil shale in Estonia|oil shale industries in Estonia]].&lt;ref name=magi/&gt;&lt;ref name=kraemer/&gt;&lt;ref name=holmberg&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; However, for economic reasons, it was decided in March 1939 to instead use a technology that had been employed in the closed [[Newnes Shale Oil Works]], and 64 modified [[Pumpherston retort]]s were transferred from Newnes.

'''Hemp hurds''', also known as shives or hemp wood, are an agricultural product made from [[hemp]]. Hurds consist of "the woody inner portion of the hemp stalk, broken into pieces and separated from the fiber in the processes of breaking and [[scutching]]" and "correspond to the shives in flax, but are coarser and usually softer in texture".{{sfn|Pulp and Paper|1917}} Hurds have traditionally been a by-product of fiber production.{{sfn|Fike|2017}}

==Decortication==
[[File:Hanfstengel.jpg|thumb|A partly decorticated hemp straw]]
Decortication separates [[Bast fibre|bast fiber]] from the hurd. The fine bast fiber is used to make textiles. Decortication is accomplished by manually crushing, a labor-intensive process, or by a hemp [[decorticator]] machine.{{sfn|Horne|2012|p=133}}{{sfn|Bouloc|2013|p=152|ps=&amp;nbsp;(diagram of decortication and fiber extraction process)}}

==Uses==

== Development of water-repellent coatings ==
Hemp shiv is a renewable organic raw material used for the production of insulation boards.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cavac-biomateriaux.com/applications.php CAVAC Biomaterials: Applications.]&lt;/ref&gt;
The use of biomaterials for insulation boards in walls is attracting increasing interest, but wider acceptance in the construction industry has so far been slowed-down by adverse material properties. Because such materials consist mainly from cellulose, they are flammable and their hydrophilic surface leads to high water uptake, which can lead to mold or rot.&lt;ref&gt;Mahmoud Khazma, Adeline Goullieux, Rose-Marie Dheilly and Michèle Quéneudec: [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0958946511001302?via%3Dihub ''Coating of a lignocellulosic aggregate with pectin/polyethylenimin mixtures: Effects on flax shive and cement-shive composite properties.''] In: ''Cement and Concrete Composites'', Volume 34, Issue 2, February 2012, Pages 223-230 DOI: [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cemconcomp.2011.07.008 10.1016/j.cemconcomp.2011.07.008].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nadjla Mostefai, Rabah Hamzaoui, Sofiane Guessasma, Amadou Aw and Hedi Nouri: [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264127515004529?via%3Dihub ''Microstructure and mechanical performance of modified hemp fibre and shiv mortars: Discovering the optimal formulation.''] In: ''Materials &amp; Design'', Volume 84, 5 November 2015, Pages 359-371.

Therefore, engineering studies have investigated whether a coating with a water-repellent thin film provides the desired benefits. For the hydrophobic coating with silica particles, a [[colloid]]al [[Sol–gel process|sol-gel]] [[dispersion (chemistry)|dispersion]] was successfully synthesized by the [[Stöber process]], characterized and deposited on hemp shiv. These samples passed a 72-hour test in the humidity chamber without loss of their hydrophobic property and no signs of mold growth.&lt;ref Name="Study"/&gt;

When the hemp shiv was coated several times with functionalized silica particles, uniform and complete coverage of the surface was achieved. Such a treatment provided the hemp shiv with a comprehensive water repellency: The hydrophilic character of the untreated hemp shiv was modified to durably hydrophobic, once the bio-materials were coated with functionalised silica particles. Mould growth was delayed when exposed to humidity, whilst the liquid water repellent property of the treated hemp shiv was maintained despite the humid conditions. The treatment developed in this study could be a viable solution for use on bio-materials that need to repel liquid water, whilst preserving the integrity of the insulation panel in common environmental conditions. There are of course still further tests to be carried out before adopting this treatment in the construction sector, such as additional moisture tests, mechanical tests, biodegradation tests, etc. However, the promising results described here give a good first assessment of feasibility. Before being fully adopted in the construction sector, these treatments and materials must be fully tested in accordance with the building codes. In addition, with the recent recent use of biomaterials, new standards and test methods for these specific materials should be developed.&lt;ref Name="Study"/&gt;

'''High-end audio''' is a class of consumer [[home audio]] equipment marketed to [[audiophile]]s on the basis of high price or quality, and esoteric or novel sound reproduction technologies. The term can refer simply to the price, to the build quality of the components, or to the subjective or objective quality of sound reproduction.&lt;ref name=Branch1&gt;{{Cite book

== Definition ==
The distinction between the terms high-end and [[high fidelity]] is not well defined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.students.tut.fi/~jmikkola/hifiopas/highend.html#terminologiaa | title = Finnish hi-fi and high-end guide: terminology | language = Finnish | accessdate = | year = }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to one industry commentator, high-end could be defined as "gear below which’s price and performance one could not go without compromising the music and the sound."&lt;ref name=200801stereotimes&gt;Szabady, Paul (January 2008). [http://www.stereotimes.com/acc010708.shtml "The Rega P3-24 Turntable"]. ''Stereo Times''. [https://www.webcitation.org/6LI88RX8Y Archived] from the original on 21 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt; [[Harry Pearson (audio critic)|Harry Pearson]], founder of ''[[The Absolute Sound]]'' magazine, is widely acknowledged to have coined the term "high-end audio".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnet.com/news/who-invented-high-end-audio/|title=Who invented high-end audio?|website=CNET|access-date=2016-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Costs ==
High-end audio equipment can be extremely expensive. It is sometimes referred to as cost-no-object equipment. [[Audiophile]] equipment can encompass the full range from budget to high-end in terms of price.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1987/08/30/arts/sound-how-about-a-pair-of-loudspeakers-priced-at-65000.html SOUND; How About a Pair of Loudspeakers Priced at $65,000?], New York Times, 1987&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fidelity assessment ==
Assessing the fidelity of sound reproduction may be done [[hearing (sense)|aurally]] or using [[Audio system measurements|dedicated measurement equipment]].

The human sense of hearing is subjective and difficult to define. [[Psychoacoustics]] is a division of acoustics that studies this field.

Measurements can be deceiving; high or low figures of certain technical characteristics do not necessarily offer a good representation of how the equipment sounds to each person. For example, some valve (vacuum tube) amplifiers produce greater amounts of [[total harmonic distortion]], but this type of distortion (2nd harmonic) is not as disturbing to the ear as the higher order distortions produced by poorly designed transistor equipment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://stereophile.com/asweseeit/1082awsi/ The Truth About High End], As We See It, by J. Gordon Holt, October 1982&lt;/ref&gt;  The terms "high-end audio" and "audiophile" are typically used disparagingly by [[Audio Engineering Society]] members, who feel that the term "high end audio" is vague, concerning the widely varying performance of the products sold in this premium price segment, and that an "audiophile" is too often a person who is overly suggestible to the marketing claims from manufacturers and sellers.

The validity of certain products are often questioned by those outside the industry include accessories such as [[speaker wire]]s utilizing exotic materials (such as [[Oxygen-free copper#Use in home audio|Oxygen-Free Copper (OFC)]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=A.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20390">[[File:Electronic-hydraulic analogy.svg|thumb|300px|Analogy between a hydraulic circuit (left) and an electronic circuit (right).]]

The '''electronic&amp;ndash;hydraulic analogy''' (derisively referred to as the '''drain-pipe theory''' by [[Oliver Lodge]]) &lt;ref&gt;[[Paul J. Nahin]], ''Oliver Heaviside: The Life, Work, and Times of an Electrical Genius of the Victorian Age'', JHU Press, 2002 
{{ISBN|0801869099}} page 59&lt;/ref&gt; is the most widely used analogy for "electron fluid" in a metal conductor.  Since [[electric current]] is invisible and the processes at play in [[electronics]] are often difficult to demonstrate, the various [[electronic component]]s are represented by [[hydraulic]] equivalents.  Electricity (as well as [[heat current|heat]]) was originally understood to be a kind of [[fluid]], and the names of certain electric quantities (such as current) are derived from hydraulic equivalents.  As with all analogies, it demands an intuitive and competent understanding of the baseline [[paradigm]]s (electronics and hydraulics).

==Paradigms==
There is no unique paradigm for establishing this analogy.  Two paradigms can be used to introduce the concept to students using pressure induced by gravity or by pumps.

In the version with pressure induced by gravity, large tanks of water are held up high, or are filled to differing water levels, and the potential energy of the water [[Head (hydraulic)|head]] is the pressure source.  This is reminiscent of electrical diagrams with an up arrow pointing to +V, grounded pins that otherwise are not shown connecting to anything, and so on.  This has the advantage of associating [[electric potential]] with [[gravitational potential]].

A second paradigm is a completely enclosed version with pumps providing pressure only and no gravity.  This is reminiscent of a circuit diagram with a voltage source shown and the wires actually completing a circuit.  This paradigm is further discussed below.

Other paradigms highlight the similarities between equations governing the flow of fluid and the flow of charge. Flow and pressure variables can be calculated in both steady and transient fluid flow situations with the use of the [[hydraulic ohm]] analogy.&lt;ref&gt;A. Akers, M. Gassman, &amp; R. Smith, ''Hydraulic Power System Analysis''. Taylor &amp; Francis, New York, 2006, Chapter 13, {{ISBN|0-8247-9956-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A. Esposito, "A Simplified Method for Analyzing Circuits by Analogy". Machine Design, October 1969, pp. 173-177.&lt;/ref&gt;  Hydraulic ohms are the units of hydraulic impedance, which is defined as the ratio of pressure to volume flow rate.  The pressure and volume flow variables are treated as [[phasor]]s in this definition, so possess a phase as well as magnitude.&lt;ref&gt;Brian J. Kirby, ''Micro- and Nanoscale Fluid Mechanics'', p. 69, Cambridge University Press, 2010 {{ISBN|1139489836}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A slightly different paradigm is used in acoustics, where [[acoustic impedance]] is defined as a relationship between pressure and air speed.  In this paradigm, a large cavity with a hole is analogous to a capacitor that stores compressional energy when the time-dependent pressure deviates from atmospheric pressure. A hole (or long tube) is analogous to an inductor that stores kinetic energy associated with the flow of air.&lt;ref&gt;Schelleng, John C. "The violin as a circuit." The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America 35.3 (2005): 326-338. http://www.maestronet.com/forum/index.php?app=core&amp;module=attach&amp;section=attach&amp;attach_id=13435&lt;/ref&gt;

A circuit was used to model feedback stabilization of a hydrodynamic plasma instability in a [[magnetic mirror]] &lt;ref&gt;"Axial feedback stabilization of a flute mode in a simple mirror reactor, by M. A. Lieberman and S. L. Wong, Plasma Physics, Vol. 19, pp. 745-55 (1977). The article contains an L-C circuit that is unstable because the "capacitance" is negative: http://iopscience.iop.org/0032-1028/19/8/005/pdf/0032-1028_19_8_005.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  In this application, the effort was to keep the plasma column centered by applying voltages to the plates, and except for the presence of turbulence and non-linear effects, the plasma was an actual electric circuit element (not really an analog).

==Hydraulic analogy with horizontal water flow==

===Voltage, current, and charge===
[[File:Hydraulic pressure.svg|thumb|300px|Hydraulic pressure difference]]
In general, [[electric potential]] is equivalent to [[hydraulic head]]. This model assumes that the water is flowing horizontally, so that the force of gravity can be ignored.  In this case electric potential is equivalent to [[pressure]].  The [[voltage]] (or [[voltage drop]] or ''potential difference'') is a difference in pressure between two points. Electric potential and voltage are usually measured in [[volts]]. 
 
[[Electric current]] is equivalent to a hydraulic [[volume flow rate]]; that is, the volumetric quantity of flowing water over time.  Usually measured in [[amperes]].

[[Electric charge]] is equivalent to a quantity of water.

===Basic circuit elements===
&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Electrionics Analogy - Pipe (Wire).svg|''[[electrical wiring|Conducting wire]]:''&amp;nbsp; a simple pipe.
Image:Electrionics Analogy - Reduced Pipe (Resistor).svg|''[[Resistor]]:''&amp;nbsp;a constricted pipe.
File:1-1111 CU-solderfitting-type 5130-22.jpg|''Node in [[Kirchhoff's circuit laws|Kirchhoff's junction rule]]:''&amp;nbsp;A [[Piping and plumbing fittings|pipe tee]] filled with flowing water.
 
&lt;/gallery&gt;
A relatively wide pipe completely filled with water is equivalent to [[Wire|conducting wire]].  When comparing to a piece of wire, the pipe should be thought of as having semi-permanent caps on the ends.  Connecting one end of a wire to a circuit is equivalent to un-capping one end of the pipe and attaching it to another pipe.  With few exceptions (such as a high-voltage power source), a wire with only one end attached to a circuit will do nothing; the pipe remains capped on the free end, and thus adds nothing to the circuit.

A [[resistor]] is equivalent to a constriction in the bore of the pipe which requires more pressure to pass the same amount of water. All pipes have some resistance to flow, just as all wires have some resistance to current.

A node (or junction) in [[Kirchhoff's circuit laws|Kirchhoff's junction rule]] is equivalent to a [[Piping and plumbing fittings|pipe tee]].  The net flow of water into a piping tee (filled with water) must equal the net flow out.
&lt;gallery&gt;
File:CapacitorHydraulicAnalogyAnimation.gif|''[[Capacitor]]:''&amp;nbsp; a flexible diaphragm sealed inside a pipe.
File:Hydraulic inductor model.svg|''[[Inductor]]:''&amp;nbsp; a heavy paddle wheel or turbine placed in the current.
File:Axial compressor.gif|''[[voltage source|Voltage]] or [[current source|current]] source:'' &amp;nbsp;A dynamic pump with feedback control.
&lt;/gallery&gt;

A [[capacitor]] is equivalent to a tank with one connection at each end and a rubber sheet dividing the tank in two lengthwise&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://amasci.com/emotor/cap1.html|title=ELECTRICITY MISCONCEPTIONS:  Capacitor|website=amasci.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; (a [[hydraulic accumulator]]). When water is forced into one pipe, equal water is simultaneously forced out of the other pipe, yet no water can penetrate the rubber diaphragm. Energy is stored by the stretching of the rubber. As more current flows "through" the capacitor, the back-pressure (voltage) becomes greater, thus current "leads" voltage in a capacitor. As the back-pressure from the stretched rubber approaches the applied pressure, the current becomes less and less. Thus capacitors "filter out" constant pressure differences and slowly varying, low-frequency pressure differences, while allowing rapid changes in pressure to pass through. &lt;!--Don't understand the next paragraph--&gt;
&lt;!--  Note that the device described will pass all changes in pressure "through" equally well, regardless of rate of change, just as an electrical capacitor will. Any device in series must obey (electrical) Kirchhoff's Current Law, or its hydraulic equivalent. 
Considering the "filter" action, a better and more exact analogy is the hydraulic accumulator "pressure tank", as described, but with a closed, pressurized air bladder and only one water connection. Such accumulators are commonly used in hydraulic power systems exactly for the purpose of damping out pressure surges and "hammers" due to valves opening and closing. --&gt;
 An [[inductor]] is equivalent to a heavy paddle wheel placed in the current. The [[mass]] of the wheel and the size of the blades restrict the water's ability to rapidly change its rate of flow (current) through the wheel due to the effects of [[inertia]], but, given time, a constant flowing stream will pass mostly unimpeded through the wheel, as it turns at the same speed as the water flow. The mass and surface area of the wheel and its blades are analogous to inductance, and friction between its axle and the axle bearings corresponds to the resistance that accompanies any non-superconducting inductor.&lt;br/&gt;An alternative inductor model is simply a long pipe, perhaps coiled into a spiral for convenience.  This fluid-inertia device is used in real life as an essential component of a [[hydraulic ram]].  The [[inertia]] of the water flowing through the pipe produces the inductance effect; inductors "filter out" rapid changes in flow, while allowing slow variations in current to be passed through.  The drag imposed by the walls of the pipe is somewhat analogous to parasitic resistance. &lt;br/&gt;In either model, the pressure difference (voltage) across the device must be present before the current will start moving, thus in inductors voltage "leads" current. As the current increases, approaching the limits imposed by its own internal friction and of the current that the rest of the circuit can provide, the pressure drop across the device becomes lower and lower.{{clear}}

An ideal [[voltage source]] (ideal [[battery (electricity)|battery]]) or ideal [[current source]] is a [[gas compressor|dynamic pump]] with feedback control. A pressure meter on both sides shows that regardless of the current being produced, this kind of pump produces constant pressure difference.  If one terminal is kept fixed at ground, another analogy is a large body of water at a high elevation, sufficiently large that the drawn water does not affect the water level.  To create the analog of an ideal [[current source]], use a [[positive displacement pump]]: A current meter (little [[paddle wheel]]) shows that when this kind of pump is driven at a constant speed, it maintains a constant speed of the little paddle wheel.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
A [[diode]] is equivalent to a one-way [[check valve]] with a slightly leaky valve seat.  As with a diode, a small pressure difference is needed before the valve opens.  And like a diode, too much  [[P-n junction#Reverse bias|reverse bias]] can damage or destroy the valve assembly.

A [[transistor]] is a valve in which a diaphragm, controlled by a low-current signal (either constant current for a [[Bipolar junction transistor|BJT]] or constant pressure for a [[Field effect transistor|FET]]), moves a plunger which affects the current through another section of pipe.

[[CMOS]] is a combination of two [[MOSFET]] transistors.  As the input pressure changes, the pistons allow the output to connect to either zero or positive pressure.

A [[memristor]] is a [[needle valve]] operated by a flow meter.  As water flows through in the forward direction, the needle valve restricts flow more; as water flows the other direction, the needle valve opens further providing less resistance.

== Principal equivalents ==
EM wave speed ([[velocity of propagation]]) is equivalent to the [[speed of sound]] in water.  When a light switch is flipped, the electric wave travels very quickly through the wires.

Charge flow speed ([[drift velocity]]) is equivalent to the particle speed of water.  The moving charges themselves move rather slowly.

[[Direct current|DC]] is equivalent to the a constant flow of water in a circuit of pipes.

[[Low frequency]] [[Alternating current|AC]] is equivalent to water oscillating back and forth in a pipe

[[high frequency|Higher-frequency]] AC and [[transmission line]]s is somewhat equivalent to [[sound]] being transmitted through the water pipes, though this does not properly mirror the cyclical reversal of alternating electric current. As described, the fluid flow conveys pressure fluctuations, but fluids do not reverse at high rates in hydraulic systems, which the above "low frequency" entry does accurately describe. A better concept (if sound waves are to be the phenomenon) is that of direct current with high-frequency "ripple" superimposed.

Inductive spark used in [[induction coil]]s is similar to [[water hammer]], caused by the inertia of water

If the differential equations have the same form, the response will be similar.

== Limits to the analogy ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2018}}
If taken too far, the water analogy can create misconceptions.  For it to be useful, one must remain aware of the regions where electricity and water behave very differently.

'''[[electromagnetic field|Fields]] ([[Maxwell equations]], [[Inductance]]):''' Electrons can push or pull other distant electrons via their fields, while water molecules experience forces only from direct contact with other molecules.  For this reason, waves in water travel at the speed of sound, but waves in a sea of charge will travel much faster as the forces from one electron are applied to many distant electrons and not to only the neighbors in direct contact.  In a hydraulic transmission line, the energy flows as mechanical waves through the water, but in an electric transmission line the energy flows as fields in the space surrounding the wires, and does not flow inside the metal.  Also, an accelerating electron will drag its neighbors along while attracting them, both because of magnetic forces.

'''Charge:'''  Unlike water, movable charge carriers can be positive or negative, and conductors can exhibit an overall positive or negative net charge.  The mobile carriers in electric currents are usually electrons, but sometimes they are charged positively, such as the positive ions in an [[electrolyte]], the [[hydron (chemistry)|H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;ions]] in [[proton conductor]]s or [[electron hole|holes]] in [[p-type semiconductor]]s and some (very rare) conductors.

'''Leaking pipes:'''  The [[electric charge]] of an electrical circuit and its elements is usually almost equal to zero, hence it is (almost) constant. This is formalized in [[Kirchhoff's current law]], which does not have an analogy to hydraulic systems, where amount of the liquid is not usually constant. Even with [[incompressible]] liquid the system may contain such elements as [[piston]]s and open pools, so the volume of liquid contained in a part of the system can change. For this reason, continuing electric currents require closed loops rather than hydraulics' open source/sink resembling spigots and buckets.

'''Fluid velocity and resistance of metals:'''  As with water hoses, the carrier drift velocity in conductors is directly proportional to current.  However, water only experiences drag via the pipes' inner surface, while charges are slowed at all points within a metal, as with water forced through a filter.  Also, typical velocity of charge carriers within a conductor is less than centimeters per minute, and the "electrical friction" is extremely high.  If charges ever flowed as fast as water can flow in pipes, the electric current would be immense, and the conductors would become incandescently hot and perhaps vaporize.  To model the resistance and the charge-velocity of metals, perhaps a pipe packed with sponge, or a narrow straw filled with syrup, would be a better analogy than a large-diameter water pipe. Resistance in most electrical conductors is a linear function: as current increases, voltage drop increases proportionally (Ohm's Law). Liquid resistance in pipes is not linear with volume, varying as the square of volumetric flow (see [[Darcy–Weisbach equation]]).

'''[[Quantum Mechanics]]:''' Solid conductors and insulators contain charges at more than one [[Energy level|discrete level of atomic orbit energy]], while the water in one region of a pipe can only have a single value of pressure.  For this reason there is no hydraulic explanation for such things as a [[battery (electricity)|battery]]'s charge pumping ability, a [[diode]]'s [[depletion layer]] and voltage drop, [[solar cell]] functions, [[Peltier effect]], etc., however equivalent devices can be designed which exhibit similar responses, although some of the mechanisms would only serve to regulate the flow curves rather than to contribute to the component's primary function.

In order for the model to be useful, the reader or student must have a substantial understanding of the model (hydraulic) system's principles. It also requires that the principles can be transferred to the target (electrical) system. Hydraulic systems are deceptively simple: the phenomenon of [[Cavitation#Pumps and propellers|pump cavitation]] is a known, complex problem that few people outside of the fluid power or irrigation industries would understand. For those who do, the hydraulic analogy is amusing, as no "cavitation" equivalent exists in electrical engineering. The hydraulic analogy can give a mistaken sense of understanding that will be exposed once a detailed description of electrical circuit theory is required.

One must also consider the difficulties in trying to make an analogy match reality completely.  The above "electrical friction" example, where the hydraulic analog is a pipe filled with sponge material, illustrates the problem: the model must be increased in complexity beyond any realistic scenario.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6888">The '''Internationalization Tag Set''' ('''ITS''') is a set of attributes and elements designed to provide [[internationalization and localization]] support in [[XML]] documents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.w3.org/TR/its/ Internationalization Tag Set (ITS)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ITS specification identifies concepts (called "ITS data categories") which are important for internationalization and localization. It also defines implementations of these concepts through a set of elements and attributes grouped in the ITS namespace. XML developers can use this namespace to integrate internationalization features directly into their own XML schemas and documents.

==Overview==

ITS v1.0 includes seven data categories:

* '''Translate''': Defines what parts of a document are translatable or not.
* '''Localization Note''': Provides alerts, hints, instructions, and other information to help the localizers or the translators.
* '''Terminology''': Indicates parts of the documents that are terms and optionally pointers to information about these terms.
* '''Directionality''': Indicates what type of display directionality should be applied to parts of the document.
* '''Ruby''': Indicates what parts of the document should be displayed as ruby text. ([[Ruby character|Ruby]] is a short run of text alongside a base text, typically used in East Asian documents to indicate pronunciation or to provide a brief annotation).
* '''Language Information''': Identifies the language of the different parts of the document.
* '''Elements Within Text''': Indicates how elements should be treated with regard to linguistic segmentation.

The vocabulary is designed to work on two different fronts: First by providing markup usable directly in the XML documents. Secondly, by offering a way to indicate if there are parts of a given markup that correspond to some of the ITS data categories and should be treated as such by ITS processors.

ITS applies to both new document types as well as existing ones. It also applies to both markups without any internationalization features as well as the class of documents already supporting some internationalization or localization-related functions.

ITS can be specified using '''global rules''' and '''local rules'''.

* The global rules are expressed anywhere in the document (embedded global rules), or even outside the document (external global rules), using the &lt;code&gt;its:rules&lt;/code&gt; element.
* The local rules are expressed by specialized attributes (and sometimes elements) specified inside the document instance, at the location where they apply.

==Examples==

===Translate data category===

In the following ITS markup example, the elements and attributes with the &lt;code&gt;its&lt;/code&gt; prefix are part of the ITS namespace. The &lt;code&gt;its:rules&lt;/code&gt; element lists the different rules to apply to this file. There is one &lt;code&gt;its:translateRule&lt;/code&gt; rule that indicates that any content inside the &lt;code&gt;head&lt;/code&gt; element should not be translated.

The &lt;code&gt;its:translate&lt;/code&gt; attributes used in some elements are utilised to override the global rule. Here, to make translatable the content of &lt;code&gt;title&lt;/code&gt; and to make non-translatable the text "faux pas".

&lt;source lang="xml"&gt;
&lt;text xmlns:its="http://www.w3.org/2005/11/its"&gt;
 &lt;head&gt;
  &lt;revision&gt;Sep-10-2006 v5&lt;/revision&gt;
  &lt;author&gt;Gerson Chicareli&lt;/author&gt;
  &lt;contact&gt;gersonchicareli@gmail.com&lt;/contact&gt;
  &lt;title
   its:translate="yes"&gt;The Origins of Modern Novel&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;its:rules version="1.0"&gt;
   &lt;its:translateRule translate="no" selector="/text/head"/&gt;
  &lt;/its:rules&gt;
 &lt;/head&gt;
 &lt;body&gt;
  &lt;div xml:id="intro"&gt;
   &lt;head&gt;Introduction&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It would certainly be quite a &lt;span its:translate="no"&gt;faux
pas&lt;/span&gt; to start a dissertation on the origin of modern novel without 
mentioning the &lt;tl&gt;HKLM of GFDL&lt;/tl&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/text&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

===Localization Note data category===

In the following ITS markup example, the &lt;code&gt;its:locNote&lt;/code&gt; element specifies that any node corresponding to the [[XPath|XPath expression]] &lt;code&gt;"//msg/data"&lt;/code&gt; has an associated note. The location of that note is expressed by the &lt;code&gt;locNotePointer&lt;/code&gt; attribute, which holds a relative XPath expression  pointing to the node where the note is, here &lt;code&gt;="../notes"&lt;/code&gt;.

Note also the use of the &lt;code&gt;its:translate&lt;/code&gt; attribute to mark the &lt;code&gt;notes&lt;/code&gt; elements as non-translatable.

&lt;source lang="xml"&gt;
&lt;Res xmlns:its="http://www.w3.org/2005/11/its"&gt;
 &lt;prolog&gt;
  &lt;its:rules version="1.0"&gt;
   &lt;its:translateRule selector="//msg/notes" translate="no"/&gt;
   &lt;its:locNoteRule locNoteType="description" selector="//msg/data" locNotePointer="../notes"/&gt;
  &lt;/its:rules&gt;
 &lt;/prolog&gt;
 &lt;body&gt;
  &lt;msg id="FileNotFound"&gt;
   &lt;notes&gt;Indicates that the resource file {0} could not be loaded.&lt;/notes&gt;
   &lt;data&gt;Cannot find the file {0}.&lt;/data&gt;
  &lt;/msg&gt;
  &lt;msg id="DivByZero"&gt;
   &lt;notes&gt;A division by 0 was going to be computed.&lt;/notes&gt;
   &lt;data&gt;Invalid parameter.&lt;/data&gt;
  &lt;/msg&gt;
 &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/Res&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

==ITS limitations==

ITS does not have a solution to all XML internationalization and localization issues.

One reason is that version 1.0 does not have data categories for everything. For example, there is currently no way to indicate a relation source/target in bilingual files where some parts of a document store the source text and some other parts the corresponding translation.

The other reason is that many aspects of internationalization cannot be resolved with a markup. They have to do with the design of the DTD or the schema itself. There are [http://www.w3.org/TR/xml-i18n-bp/ best practices, design and authoring guidelines] that are necessary to follow to make sure documents are correctly internationalized and easy to localize. For example, using attributes to store translatable text is a bad idea for many different reasons, but ITS cannot prevent an XML developer from making such choice.

Some of the ITS 1.0 limitations are being addressed in the version 2.0: See http://www.w3.org/TR/its20/ for more details.

A '''learning store''' is a specialised [[retailer]] of materials expressly for the [[education]] and development of children of all ages.  These materials include [[toy]]s, [[book]]s, [[game]]s, [[building block]]s and [[music]], along with traditional teaching resources and curriculum materials.   Some learning stores offer materials for developmentally disabled adults as well.  The term ''learning store'' was coined in 1984 &lt;ref name=td3895&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.toydirectory.com/monthly/article.asp?id=3895|title=Retailer Spotlight: Golden Apple Learning Store Selection and Staff Make Toy Shop a Match for Teachers and Kids  |last=Ruggiero |first=Brenda |date=October 2009|work=TD Monthly|accessdate=2 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the Golden Apple Learning Store.  Large chains such as [[Early Learning Centre]] now exist and learning stores can now be found in many urban and suburban areas.

== Types of materials ==
Learning stores have traditionally offered less mainstream toys such as [[BRIO]], [[Playmobil]], Melissa &amp; Doug, or toys sold primarily in the speciality toy market.  Other resources found at Learning Stores are often published by small educational publishers outside of the mainstream textbook publishing world.  Learning stores and their suppliers are generally members of either the [[American Specialty Toy Retailing Association]] (ASTRA) or the [[National School Supply and Equipment Association]] (NSSEA).&lt;ref name=td3895 /&gt;

'''Life Technologies Corporation''' was a biotech company founded in November 2008 through a [[United States dollar|US]]$6.7 billion merger of [[Invitrogen]] Corporation and [[Applied Biosystems]] Inc. The joint sales of the combined companies were about $3.5 billion; they had about 9,500 employees, and owned more than 3,600 licenses and patents.&lt;ref name=biz&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/stories/2008/11/17/daily103.html |title = Applied Biosystems, Invitrogen complete $6.7 billion merger |date = 21 November 2008 |work = San Francisco Business Times |accessdate = 19 August 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thermo Fisher Scientific]] Corporation acquired the company in 2014 and used the Life Technologies brand name for a family of [[biotechnology]] products and services from Feb 2014 to July 2015. Thermo Fisher retired the Life Technologies brand name and logos in late July 2015, following a world-wide release letter to all customers in five languages.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.lifetechnologies.com/content/dam/LifeTech/Documents/PDFs/Brand_Project_Customer_Letter_FINAL_06-26-2015_EN.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.lifetechnologies.com/content/dam/LifeTech/Documents/PDFs/Brand-Project-Customer-Letter-FINAL_ES.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.lifetechnologies.com/content/dam/LifeTech/Documents/PDFs/Brand-Project-Customer-Letter-FINAL_DE.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.lifetechnologies.com/content/dam/LifeTech/Documents/PDFs/Brand-Project-Customer-Letter-FINAL_IT.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.lifetechnologies.com/content/dam/LifeTech/Documents/PDFs/Brand-Project-Customer-Letter-FINAL_FR.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Company name==
The name "Life Technologies" was an old name from the history of Invitrogen.  GIBCO (Grand Island Biological Company) had been founded around 1960 in New York; in 1983 GIBCO merged with a reagent company called Bethesda Research Laboratories and the merged company was named Life Technologies. In 2000, Invitrogen acquired Life Technologies and discontinued that name. When Invitrogen and Applied Biosystems merged, the companies revived the name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Life Technologies: A Look Back |url=https://www.genengnews.com/gen-news-highlights/life-technologies-a-look-back/81248226 |work=Genetic Engineering News |date=April 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of the "Life Technologies" brand name is disputed. [[Life Technologies (India)]] Private Limited, a company founded in 2002, operating in this corporate name claims ownership of the brand name.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.separationsnow.com/details/news/144548b7a73/Life-Technologies-loses-Indian-court-battle.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2014, a legal dispute on the use of the mark "Life Technologies" in India concluded as the [[Delhi High Court]] denied&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Delhi High Court |title=Case 1698OS/2012 |url=http://lobis.nic.in/dhc/PKB/judgement/29-01-2014/PKB29012014IA108792012.pdf |date=29 January 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141215010443/http://lobis.nic.in/dhc/PKB/judgement/29-01-2014/PKB29012014IA108792012.pdf |archivedate=15 December 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Life Technologies' request to prevent the similarly named biotechnology company Life Technologies India Pvt.

==Acquisition==
In 2013 [[Thermo Fisher Scientific|Thermo Fisher]] agreed to buy Life Technologies for $13.6 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Thermo Fisher to buy Life Tech for $13.6 billion |author = Bill Berkrot |url = https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/04/15/us-lifetechnologies-thermofisher-idUSBRE93D0A620130415 |newspaper = [[Reuters]] |date = 15 April 2013 |accessdate = 17 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They completed the sale on 3 February 2014, and the Life Technologies brand became part of the Life Sciences Solutions Group of Thermo Fisher Scientific.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.marketwatch.com/story/thermo-fisher-scientific-completes-acquisition-of-life-technologies-corporation-2014-02-03 |title = Thermo Fisher Scientific Completes Acquisition of Life Technologies Corporation |date = 3 February 2014 |website = [[MarketWatch]] |publisher = ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' |accessdate = 4 February 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between its formation in 2008 and its [[mergers and acquisitions|acquisition]] by Thermo Fisher Scientific in 2014, Life Technologies Corporation was an independent multinational corporation based in [[Carlsbad, California]], United States.

==Legal disputes==

A court case involving Life Technologies (as the former [[Applied Biosystems|Applera Corp]]) ended in January 2014, as the [[United States District Court for the District of Connecticut|Connecticut District Court]] penalized Life Technologies Corp over $60 million&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = US District Court Order |url = http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/connecticut/ctdce/3:2004cv00929/65721/543 |work = Justia |date = 3 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; for patent infringements by its parent companies prior to the merger. The jury awarded $48 million in royalty damages to the plaintiffs Enzo Biochem, Inc, Enzo Life Sciences, and Yale University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Federal Court Awards Enzo Additional $12.4M Related to IP Suit Against Life Tech |url = http://www.genomeweb.com/pcrsample-prep/federal-court-awards-enzo-additional-124m-related-ip-suit-against-life-tech |work = GenomeWeb Daily News |date = 6 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

| '''BAg-3''', '''AMS 4771''', '''AG 351''', '''Easy-Flo 3''', '''Silvaloy 50N''', '''Mattibraze 50N'''. For 300-series [[stainless steel]]. For joining [[tungsten carbide]], [[beryllium copper]] and [[aluminium bronze]] to steel. Introduced as a replacement of BAg-1a due to its increased corrosion resistance in certain conditions. Resistant to chloride corrosion. Used in marine applications. Used in dairy equipment exposed to strong chlorine-based cleaning solutions. Used extensively for brazing tungsten carbide tips on woodcutting, metal cutting and mining tools. Recommended for [[aluminium bronze]] as the nickel content offsets the detrimental effect of aluminium diffusion. Mushy during melting, most volume melts at the higher end of melting range. Can be used to shape fillets and to bridge large gaps. Fillets may be used for bridging large gaps or for distributing stresses in the assembly. Tendency to liquation. Light yellow color. Maximum service temperature 204 °C (intermittently 316 °C). Gap 0.1–0.25&amp;nbsp;mm. Cadmium-free alternative is BAg-24.

Large use on small electric motors, where soft soldering would fail on overheating. Used for soldering gun parts instead of soft solders due to high resistance to alkali solutions used for blacking, and due to higher strength at high temperatures. Gray color.

A '''maraschino cherry''' ({{IPAc-en|m|ær|ə|ˈ|s|k|iː|n|oʊ}} {{respell|marr-ə|SKEE|noh}} or {{IPAc-en|m|ær|ə|ˈ|ʃ|iː|n|oʊ}} {{respell|marr-ə|SHEE|noh}}) is a preserved, sweetened [[cherry]], typically made from light-colored sweet cherries such as the [[Royal Ann cherry|Royal Ann]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Murray | first=M.T. | last2=Pizzorno | first2=J. | last3=Pizzorno | first3=L. | title=The Encyclopedia of Healing Foods | publisher=Atria Books | year=2010 | isbn=978-1-4391-0344-9 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UKtAMVUT57EC&amp;pg=PA264 | access-date=August 25, 2018 | page=264}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rainier cherry|Rainier]], or Gold varieties. In their modern form, the cherries are first preserved in a [[brine]] solution usually containing [[sulfur dioxide]] and [[calcium chloride]] to bleach the fruit, then soaked in a [[Suspension (chemistry)|suspension]] of [[food coloring]] (common red food dye is [[Allura Red AC|FD&amp;C Red 40]]), [[sugar syrup]], and other components.&lt;ref name=who&gt;{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=Who Made That Maraschino Cherry? |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/21/magazine/who-made-that-maraschino-cherry.html |quote= In 1925, Wiegand discovered that adding calcium salts to the preserving brine firmed up the fruit. |newspaper=[[New York Times Magazine]] |date=September 19, 2014 |accessdate=2015-02-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maraschino cherries are an ingredient in many [[cocktail]]s, giving them the nickname "cocktail cherries". As a [[Garnish (food)|garnish]], they often are used to decorate [[frozen yogurt]], baked [[ham]], [[cake]]s, [[pastry]], [[parfait]]s, [[milkshake]]s, [[sundae|ice cream sundae]]s, and [[ice cream soda]]s. They are an integral part of an American [[ice cream sundae]]. The term "''cherry on top''" refers to the Maraschino cherries on top of the ice cream sundae. They are frequently included in canned [[fruit cocktail]].&lt;ref&gt;[[USDA]]'s [http://www.ams.usda.gov/AMSv1.0/getfile?dDocName=STELPRD3105806 Grading Manual for Canned Fruit Cocktail]&lt;/ref&gt; They are also used as an accompaniment to [[paan#Varieties|sweet paan]]. Sometimes the cherries, along with some of the maraschino "juice", are put into a glass of [[Coca-Cola]] to make an old-fashioned or homemade "[[Cherry Coke]]".

==Europe==
The name ''maraschino'' originates from the [[Marasca cherry]] of [[Croatian cuisine|Croatian]] origin{{cn|date=August 2018}} and the [[maraschino]] [[liqueur]] made from it, in which Marasca cherries were crushed and preserved after being pickled.&lt;ref name="Blech 2009"&gt;{{cite book | last=Blech | first=Z.Y. | title=Kosher Food Production | publisher=Wiley | year=2009 | isbn=978-0-8138-0480-4 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=smFVSUWXTbkC&amp;pg=PA266 | access-date=August 25, 2018 | page=266}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whole cherries preserved in this liqueur were known as "maraschino cherries".&lt;ref name=blech&gt;{{cite book|last=Blech|first=Zushe Yosef|title=Kosher Food Production|year=2009|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|isbn=0-8138-2093-6|pages=266}}&lt;/ref&gt; These had been a local means of preserving the fruit in [[Dalmatia]].&lt;ref name="Blech 2009"/&gt;

In the 19th century, these became popular in the rest of Europe, but the supply in Dalmatia was too small for the whole continent, so they came to be seen as a delicacy for royalty and the wealthy.

Because of the relative scarcity of the Marasca, other cherries came to be preserved in various ways and sold as "maraschino".

==United States==
The cherries were first introduced in the United States in the late 19th century, where they were served in fine bars and [[restaurant]]s. Because they were scarce and expensive, by the turn of the century American producers were experimenting with other processes for preserving cherries, with flavors such as [[almond extract]] and substitute fruit like [[Royal Ann cherry|Queen Anne cherries]]. Among these, alcohol was already becoming less common.

In response, the [[USDA]] in 1912 defined "maraschino cherries" as "Marasca cherries preserved in maraschino" under the authority of the [[Food and Drugs Act of 1906]]. The artificially-colored and sweetened Royal Anne variety were required to be called "Imitation Maraschino Cherries" instead.&lt;ref name="FDA CPG"&gt;{{cite web|author=U.S. FDA | date=1980-01-10 |url=http://www.fda.gov/ICECI/ComplianceManuals/CompliancePolicyGuidanceManual/ucm074535.htm |title=Sec. 550.550 Maraschino Cherries |work= CPG 7110.11 |accessdate=2006-05-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Food Inspection Decision 141 defined Marasca cherries and maraschino themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=USDA |title=Food Inspection Decision 141.

During [[Prohibition in the United States]] as of 1920, the decreasingly popular alcoholic variety was illegal as well. [[Ernest H. Wiegand]], a professor of [[horticulture]] at [[Oregon State University]], developed the modern method of manufacturing maraschino cherries using a brine solution rather than alcohol.&lt;ref name=who/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Oregon Encyclopedia|maraschino_cherries|author=Verzemnieks, Inara}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, most modern maraschino cherries have only a historical connection with maraschino liqueur.

According to Bob Cain, Cliff Samuels, and Hoya Yang, who worked with Wiegand at OSU, Prohibition had nothing to do with Wiegand's research: his intention was to develop a better brining process for cherries that would not soften them. When Wiegand began his research, there were several ways to preserve maraschino cherries without alcohol, long before Prohibition went into effect. Wiegand took a process that people had their own recipes for—"and who knows what they were putting in there" (frequently not alcohol)—and turned it into a science, something replicable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The fruit that made Oregon famous |first=Inara |last=Verzemnieks |date=2006-02-12 |publisher=[[The Oregonian]] |url=http://blog.oregonlive.com/oregoniantest/2007/04/the_fruit_that_made_oregon_fam.html |accessdate=2007-07-04 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930040753/http://blog.oregonlive.com/oregoniantest/2007/04/the_fruit_that_made_oregon_fam.html |archivedate=30 September 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Wiegand began his research, [[sodium metabisulfite]] was being used to preserve maraschino cherries. Some accounts indicate that this preservation method was being used long before Prohibition. Some manufacturers used maraschino or imitation liqueurs to flavor the cherries, but newspaper stories from the early part of the century suggest that many manufacturers stopped using alcohol and artificial dyes before Prohibition.

After [[Repeal of Prohibition|Prohibition was repealed]] lobbying by the non-alcoholic preserved cherry industry encouraged the [[Food and Drug Administration]] to revise federal policy toward canned cherries. It held a hearing in April 1939 to establish a new [[standard of identity]]. Since 1940, "maraschino cherries" have been defined as "cherries which have been dyed red, impregnated with sugar, and packed in a sugar syrup flavored with [[Almond#Sweet_and_bitter_almonds|oil of bitter almonds]] or a similar flavor."&lt;ref name="FDA CPG" /&gt;

FD&amp;C Red Number 1 and 4, and FD&amp;C Yellow Number 1 through 4 were removed from the approved list in 1960. The ban on [[FD&amp;C Red No. 4|Red Number 4]] was lifted in 1965 to allow the coloring of maraschino cherries, which by then were considered mainly decorative and not a foodstuff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Pavia|first=Donald L.|year=2005|title=Introduction to Organic Laboratory Techniques: A Small Scale Approach|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1975, [[William F. Randolph]] of the [[FDA]] ruled that if an "artificial bitter almond flavor or any synthetic flavor is used, the product must be labeled artificial or artificially flavored."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=U.S. Sets Up Limits for Processors of Maraschino Cherries |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9F04E4D8123CE034BC4A53DFB266838E669EDE |quote=There are limits beyond which the processors of maraschino cherries may not go, the United States Food and Drug Administration has decided. ... |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |date=April 2, 1975 |accessdate=2015-02-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The following year, the ban on Red #4 was reinstated.  

As of 2010, modern American Maraschino cherries typically use [[FD&amp;C Red 40]] as a colorant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=The Mystery of the Red Bees of Red Hook |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/30/nyregion/30bigcity.html |quote=...

'''Mechanical Engineering Technology''' is the application of engineering principles and technological developments for the creation of useful [[Product (business)|product]]s and production machinery.

==Technologists==
Mechanical engineering technologists are expected to apply current technologies and principles from machine and product design, production and material and manufacturing processes.

Expandable specialties may include aerospace, automotive, energy, nuclear, petroleum, manufacturing, product development, and [[industrial design]]. 

Mechanical engineering technologists can have many different titles, including in the United States: 
* Mechanical Engineering Technologist
* Mechanical Engineer 
* Product Engineering Technologist
* Mechanical Designer
* Product Development Engineering Technologist
* Manufacturing Engineering Technologist 

===Training===
Mechanical Engineering Technology coursework is less theoretical, and more application based than a [[mechanical engineering]] degree.  This is evident through the additional laboratory coursework required for a degree.  The ability to apply concepts from the [[chemical engineering]] and [[electrical engineering]] fields is important. 

Some university Mechanical Engineering Technology degree programs require mathematics through [[differential equation]]s and [[statistics]].  Most courses involve algebra and calculus.

Oftentimes, a MET graduate could get hired as an engineer; job titles may include Mechanical Engineer and Manufacturing Engineer. In the U.S. it is possible to get an associates or bachelor's degree.  Individuals with a bachelor's degree in engineering technology may continue on to complete the E.I.T. (Engineer in Training) examination to eventually become Professional Engineers if the program is [[ABET]] accredited.

==Applications==
Software tools such as [[Finite Element Analysis]] (FEA) and [[Computational Fluid Dynamics]] (CFD) are often used to analyze parts and assemblies. 3D models can be made to represent parts and assemblies with [[computer-aided design]] (CAD) software. 

Through the application of [[computer-aided manufacturing]] (CAM), models may also be used directly by software to create "instructions" for the manufacture of objects represented by the models, through computer numerically controlled (CNC) machining or other automated processes.

==History==
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2014}}

===Foundation and early years (2011–2013)===
Phnom Penh Institute of Technology was founded by Japan's Graduated Cambodia Students and Yamada Osamitsu Scholarship Foundation as the Phnom Penh Vocational School on April 1, 2011, three years after the [[Great Recession]]. To accomplish the quick catch-up to the future economic recovering, the government expected this school to cultivate new modernized craftsmen and engineers. In 2013, it was renamed Phnom Penh Institute of Technology.

===Rectangular Strategy Phase III (2013–present)===
After forming a new government, the new education policy was promulgated in late 2013 with the Industrial Development Policy and Science Technology and Innovation Policy. Phnom Penh Institute of Technology was recognized by the Royal Government of Cambodia.

Many three-year courses were turned into four-year courses with the start of the School of Engineering this year. The university started graduate programmes in engineering in 2013.

The following year, the four centers were integrated and reorganized. The Center for the Promotion of Science Technology and Innovation; the Center for Continuing Education and Professional Development; the Center for Research Development and Industrial Liaison; the Center for Global Communication and International Language; and the School of Engineering were merged to create School of Science and Engineering.

Since January 2014, it has been privatized into the National University Incorporation of Phnom Penh Institute of Technology under a sub-decree.

&lt;/ref&gt; He then read a [[Sunday Supplement|Sunday supplements]] article that asked 40,000 people what they wanted from a washing machine and the most requested feature was a larger door for easier loading and unloading.&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt; Reason sketched plans of a machine with a drum which slides out when you open the washing machine door to allow easy access.&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt; He added [[Environmentalism|green]] features; the machine automatically weighed the washing to dispense exactly the right amount of water and detergent, and instead of a concrete base, the water used for the wash acted as ballast.&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt; Reason approached the major manufacturers but they did not want to incorporate it at that time.&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt; Reason and his team in [[Pembrokeshire]], [[Wales]] claimed that the machine could clean clothes using less energy and water, and was easy to load.&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27902">'''Recovery boiler''' is the part of [[Kraft process]] of [[wood pulp|pulp]]ing where chemicals for [[white liquor]] are recovered and reformed from [[black liquor]], which contains [[lignin]] from previously processed wood. The black liquor is burned, generating heat, which is usually used in the process or in making electricity, much as in a conventional steam [[power plant]]. The invention of the recovery boiler by G.H. Tomlinson in the early 1930s was a milestone in the advancement of the kraft process.&lt;ref name="eero"&gt;{{cite book |author= E. Sjöström |title= Wood Chemistry: Fundamentals and Applications |publisher= [[Academic Press]]|year= 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recovery boilers are also used in the (less common) [[sulfite process]] of wood pulping; this article deals only with recovery boiler use in the Kraft process.

[[Image:SantaFeRecoveryBoiler.JPG|thumb|500px|CMPC Celulosa Santa Fe Recovery boiler is one of the newest boilers in South America]]

== Function of recovery boilers ==
Concentrated black liquor contains organic dissolved wood residue in addition to sodium sulfate from the cooking chemicals added at the digester. Combustion of the organic portion of chemicals produces heat. In the recovery boiler heat is used to produce high pressure steam, which is used to generate electricity in a turbine. The turbine exhaust, low pressure steam is used for process heating.

Combustion of black liquor in the recovery boiler furnace needs to be controlled carefully. High concentration of sulfur requires optimum process conditions to avoid production of sulfur dioxide and reduced sulfur gas emissions. In addition to environmentally clean combustion, reduction of inorganic sulfur must be achieved in the [[char bed]].

Several processes occur in the recovery boiler:

*Combustion of organic material in black liquor to generate heat.
*Reduction of inorganic sulfur compounds to sodium sulfide, which exits at the bottom as smelt
*Production of molten inorganic flow of mainly sodium carbonate and sodium sulfide, which is later recycled to the digester after being re-dissolved
*Recovery of inorganic dust from flue gas to save chemicals
*Production of sodium fume to capture combustion residue of released sulfur compounds

=== First recovery boilers ===
[[File:Svartlut 76.jpg|thumb|Black liquor]]
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:EarlyTomlinsonRB.gif|thumb|400px|One of the first recovery boilers built, Sweden 1930's]] --&gt;
Some features of the original recovery boiler have remained unchanged to this day. It was the first recovery equipment type where all processes occurred in a single vessel. The drying, combustion and subsequent reactions of black liquor all occur inside a cooled furnace. This is the main idea in Tomlinson’s work.

Secondly the combustion is aided by spraying the black liquor into small droplets. Controlling process by directing spray proved easy. Spraying was used in early rotary furnaces and with some success adapted to stationary furnace by H. K. Moore. Thirdly one can control the [[char bed]] by having primary air level at char bed surface and more levels above. Multiple level air system was introduced by C. L. Wagner.

Recovery boilers also improved the smelt removal. It is removed directly from the furnace through smelt spouts into a dissolving tank. Some of the first recovery units employed the use of Cottrell’s electrostatic precipitator for dust recovery.

Babcock &amp; Wilcox was founded in 1867 and gained early fame with its [[Water-tube boiler|water tube boilers]]. The company built and put into service the first black liquor recovery boiler in the world in 1929.&lt;ref name="steam"&gt;{{cite book |author1=S. Stultz S. |author2=J. Kitto |title= Steam its generation and use |publisher= [[Babcock &amp; Wilcox]]|year= 1992|edition=40th   |isbn=0-9634570-0-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was soon followed by a unit with completely water cooled furnace at Windsor Mills in 1934. After reverberatory and rotating furnaces the recovery boiler was on its way.

The second early pioneer, Combustion Engineering based its recovery boiler design on the work of William M. Cary, who in 1926 designed three furnaces to operate with direct liquor spraying and on work by Adolph W. Waern and his recovery units.

Recovery boilers were soon licensed and produced in Scandinavia and Japan. These boilers were built by local manufacturers from drawings and with instructions of licensors. One of the early Scandinavian Tomlinson units employed an 8.0 m high furnace that had 2.8*4.1 m furnace bottom which expanded to 4.0*4.1 m at superheater entrance.&lt;ref name="Korsnas"&gt;{{cite book |author= Bertil, Pettersson |title= Korsnäs sodapannor under 40 år (40 years of recovery boilers at Korsnäs) In Swedish |publisher= Sodahuskonferensen ‘83, ÅF-IPK, Stockholm |year= 1983 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This unit stopped production for every weekend. In the beginning economizers had to be water washed twice every day, but after installation of shot sootblowing in the late 1940s the economizers could be cleaned at the regular weekend stop.

The construction utilized was very successful. One of the early Scandinavian boilers 160 t/day at Korsnäs, operated still almost 50 years later.&lt;ref name="Sandquist"&gt;{{cite book |author= Kent, Sandquist |title= Operational experience with single drum recovery boilers in North America |publisher= Tappi 1987 Kraft Recovery Operations Seminar, Orlando, Fl, January 11–16 |year= 1987 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Development of recovery boiler technology ===
[[File:Black_liquor_nozzle.JPG|thumb|upright|A nozzle used in recovery boilers for injecting black liquor]]
The use of Kraft recovery boilers spread fast as functioning chemical recovery gave Kraft pulping an economic edge over sulfite pulping.&lt;ref name="Boniface"&gt;{{cite book |author= Arthur, Boniface |title= Operational Introduction. in Chemical recovery in alkaline pulping processes, Ed. Hough, Gerald |publisher= Tappi Press, Atlanta |year= 1985 |isbn= 0-89852-046-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first recovery boilers had horizontal evaporator surfaces, followed by superheaters and more evaporation surfaces. These boilers resembled the state-of-the-art boilers of some 30 years earlier. This trend has continued until today. Since a halt in the production line will cost a lot of money the adopted technology in recovery boilers tends to be conservative.

The first recovery boilers had severe problems with [[fouling]].&lt;ref name="Deely"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Deeley |first=E. |authorlink= |author2=Deeley  |date=September 1967 |title=The development of chemical recovery boiler |journal=Journal of the Institute of Fuel |volume= |issue=  |pages=417–424 |id= |url= |accessdate= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tube spacing wide enough for normal operation of a coal-fired boiler had to be wider for recovery boilers. This gave satisfactory performance of about a week before a water wash. Mechanical sootblowers were also quickly adopted. To control chemical losses and lower the cost of purchased chemicals [[electrostatic precipitator]]s were added. Lowering dust losses in [[flue gases]] has more than 60 years of practice.

One should also note square headers in the 1940 recovery boiler. The air levels in recovery boilers soon standardized to two: a primary air level at the [[char bed]] level and a secondary above the liquor guns.

In the first tens of years, the furnace lining was of refractory brick. The flow of smelt on the walls causes extensive replacement and soon designs that eliminated the use of bricks were developed.

=== Improving air systems ===

To achieve solid operation and low emissions the recovery boiler air system needs to be properly designed. Air system development continues and has been continuing as long as recovery boilers have existed.&lt;ref name="Vakkilainen"&gt;{{cite book |author= Esa, Vakkilainen |title= Recovery boiler adjustable air |publisher= Presentation at Spring BLRBAC, Atlanta, Georgia |year= 1996 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As soon as the target set for the air system has been met new targets are given. Currently the new air systems have achieved low NOx, but are still working on lowering fouling. Table 1 visualizes the development of air systems.

The first generation air system in the 1940s and 1950s consisted of a two level arrangement; primary air for maintaining the reduction zone and secondary air below the liquor guns for final oxidation.&lt;ref name="Llinares"&gt;{{cite book |author1=V., Llinares, Jr.  |author2=P. J., Chapman   |lastauthoramp=yes |title= Stationary firing, three level air system retrofit experience |publisher= Proceedings of 1989 Tappi Engineering Conference, Atlanta, Georgia, September 10–13 |year= 1989 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The recovery boiler size was 100 – 300 TDS (tons of dry solids) per day. and black liquor concentration 45 – 55%. Frequently to sustain combustion auxiliary fuel needed to be fired. Primary air was 60 – 70% of total air with secondary the rest. In all levels openings were small and design velocities were 40 – 45&amp;nbsp;m/s. Both air levels were operated at 150&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C. Liquor gun or guns were oscillating. Main problems were high [[Carryover with steam|carryover]], plugging and low reduction. But the function, combustion of black liquor, could be filled.

The second generation air system targeted high reduction. In 1954 CE moved their secondary air from about 1 m below the liquor guns to about 2 m above them.&lt;ref name="Llinares" /&gt; The air ratios and temperatures remained the same, but to increase mixing 50&amp;nbsp;m/s secondary air velocities were used. CE changed their frontwall/backwall secondary to tangential firing at that time. In tangential air system the air nozzles are in the furnace corners. The preferred method is to create a swirl of almost the total furnace width. In large units the swirl caused left and right imbalances. This kind of air system with increased dry solids managed to increase lower furnace temperatures and achieve reasonable reduction. B&amp;W had already adopted the three-level air feeding by then.

Third generation air system was the three level air. In Europe the use of three levels of air feeding with primary and secondary below the liquor guns started about 1980. At the same time stationary firing gained ground. Use of about 50% secondary seemed to give hot and stable lower furnace.&lt;ref name="Westerberg"&gt;{{cite book |author= E. Norman, Westerberg |title= Kraft mill recovery units examined |publisher= PPI, march 1983 |year= 1983   }}&lt;/ref&gt; Higher black liquor solids 65 – 70% started to be in use. Hotter lower furnace and improved reduction were reported. With three level air and higher dry solids the sulfur emissions could be kept in place.

Fourth generation air systems are the multilevel air and the vertical air. As the feed of black liquor dry solids to the recovery boiler have increased, achieving low sulfur emissions is not anymore the target of the air system. Instead low NOx and low carryover are the new targets.

==== Multilevel air ====

The three-level air system was a significant improvement, but better results were required. Use of CFD models offered a new insight of air system workings. The first to develop a new air system was Kvaerner (Tampella) with their 1990 multilevel secondary air in Kemi, Finland, which was later adapted to a string of large recovery boilers.&lt;ref name="Mannola"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mannola |first=Lasse |authorlink= |author2=Richard, Burelle  |date=March 1995 |title=Operating experience of a 7,270,000 lb d.s./day recovery boiler |journal=Pulp &amp; Paper Canada |volume=96 |issue= 3 |pages= |id= |url= |accessdate= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kvaerner also patented the four level air system, where additional air level is added above the tertiary air level. This enables significant NOx reduction.

==== Vertical air ====

Vertical air mixing was invented by Erik Uppstu.&lt;ref name="Uppstu"&gt;{{cite book |author= Erik, Uppstu |title= Soodakattilan ilmanjaon hallinta. (Control of recovery boiler air distribution) In Finnish |publisher= Soodakattilapäivä 1995, Finnish recovery boiler committee |year= 1995 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His idea is to turn traditional vertical mixing to horizontal mixing. Closely spaced jets will form a flat plane. In traditional boilers this plane has been formed by secondary air. By placing the planes to 2/3 or 3/4 arrangement improved mixing results. Vertical air has a potential to reduce NOx as staging air helps in decreasing emissions.&lt;ref name="Forssen"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Forssén |first=Mikael |authorlink= |author2=Pia, Kilpinen |author3=Mikko, Hupa |date=June 2000 |title=NOx reduction in black liquor combustion - reaction mechanisms reveal novel operational strategy options |journal=Tappi Journal |volume=83 |issue= 6 |pages= |id= |url= |accessdate= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In vertical air mixing, primary air supply is arranged conventionally. Rest of the air ports are placed on interlacing 2/3 or 3/4 arrangement.

== Black liquor dry solids ==

 [[Image:NetheatingvalueBlackLiquor.jpg|thumb|300px|Net heating values of industrial black liquors at various concentrations]]

As fired black liquor is a mixture of organics, inorganics and water. Typically the amount of water is expressed as mass ratio of dried black liquor to unit of black liquor before drying. This ratio is called the black liquor dry solids.&lt;br /&gt;
 
If the black liquor dry solids is below 20% or water content in black liquor is above 80% the net heating value of black liquor is negative. This means that all heat from combustion of organics in black liquor is spent evaporating the water it contains. The higher the dry solids, the less water the black liquor contains and the hotter the adiabatic combustion temperature.

Black liquor dry solids have always been limited by the ability of available evaporation.&lt;ref name="Holmlund"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Karl, Holmlund  |author2=Kari, Parviainen,  |lastauthoramp=yes |title= Evaporation of black liquor. Chapter 12 in Chemical Pulping, Book 6, series editors Johan Gullichsen and Carl-Johan Fogelholm |publisher= Finnish Paper Engineers' Association and TAPPI |year= 2000  |isbn= 952-5216-06-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Virgin black liquor dry solids of recovery boilers is shown as a function of purchase year of that boiler.

[[Image:DrySolidsvsYear.jpg|thumb|300px|Virgin black liquor dry solids as a function of purchase year of the recovery boiler]]

When looking at the virgin black liquor dry solids we note that on average dry solids has increased. This is especially true for latest very large recovery boilers. Design dry solids for green field mills have been either 80 or 85% dry solids. 80% (or before that 75%) dry solids has been in use in Asia and South America. 85% (or before that 80%) has been in use in Scandinavia and Europe.

== High temperature and pressure recovery boiler ==

Development of recovery boiler main steam pressure and temperature was rapid at the beginning. By 1955, not even 20 years from birth of recovery boiler highest steam pressures were 10.0 MPa and 480&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C. The pressures and temperatures used then backed downward somewhat due to safety.&lt;ref name="McCarthy"&gt;{{cite book |author= J. H., McCarthy |title= Recovery plant design and maintenance. Chapter 5 of Chemical recovery in alkaline pulping process, Ed. Whitney, Roy P. 
 |publisher= TAPPI Monograph series No. 32, Mack Printing Company, Easton, Pa. |year= 1968   }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1980 there were about 700 recovery boilers in the world.&lt;ref name="Westerberg" /&gt;

=== Safety ===

One of the main hazards in operation of recovery boilers is the smelt-water explosion. This can happen if even a small amount of water is mixed with the solids in high temperature. Smelt-water explosion is purely a physical phenomenon. The smelt water explosion phenomena have been studied by Grace.&lt;ref name="Grace12"&gt;{{cite book |author= Thomas M., Grace, J. H., Cameron and David T., Clay,   |title= Role of the sulfate/sulfide cycle in char burning - experimental results and implications  |publisher= TAPPI Kraft Recovery Operations Seminar |year= 1988   }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1980 there were about 700 recovery boilers in the world.&lt;ref name="Westerberg" /&gt; The liquid - liquid type explosion mechanism has been established as one of the main causes of recovery boiler explosions.

In the smelt water explosion even a few liters of water, when mixed with molten smelt can violently turn to steam in few tenths of a second. [[Char bed]] and water can coexist as steam blanketing reduces heat transfer. Some trigger event destroys the balance and water is evaporated quickly through direct contact with smelt. This sudden evaporation causes increase of volume and a pressure wave of some 10 000 – 100 000 Pa. The force is usually sufficient to cause all furnace walls to bend out of shape. Safety of equipment and personnel requires an immediate shutdown of the recovery boiler if there is a possibility that water has entered the furnace. All recovery boilers have to be equipped with special automatic shutdown sequence.

The other type of explosions is the combustible gases explosion. For this to happen the fuel and the air have to be mixed before the ignition. Typical conditions are either a blackout (loss of flame) without purge of furnace or continuous operation in a substoichiometric state. To detect blackout flame monitoring devices are installed, with subsequent interlocked purge and startup. Combustible gas explosions are connected with oil/gas firing in the boiler. As also continuous O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; monitoring is practiced in virtually every boiler the noncombustible gas explosions have become very rare.

=== Modern recovery boiler ===
The modern recovery boiler is of a single drum design, with vertical steam generating bank and wide spaced superheaters. This design was first proposed by Colin MacCallum in 1973 in a proposal by Götaverken (now Metso Power inc.) for a large recovery boiler having a capacity of 4,000,000&amp;nbsp;lb of black liquor solids per day for a boiler in Skutskär, Sweden, but this design was rejected as being too advanced at that time by the prospective owner.  MacCallum presented the design at BLRBAC and in a paper "The Radiant Recovery Boiler" printed in Tappi magazine in December 1980.  The first boiler of this single-drum design was sold by Götaverken at Leaf River in Mississippi in 1984.  The construction of the vertical steam generating bank is similar to the vertical economizer. Vertical boiler bank is easy to keep clean. The spacing between superheater panels increased and leveled off at over 300 but under 400&amp;nbsp;mm. Wide spacing in superheaters helps to minimize fouling. This arrangement, in combination with sweetwater attemperators, ensures maximum protection against corrosion.

The effect of increasing dry solids concentration has had a significant effect on the main operating variables. The steam flow increases with increasing black liquor dry solids content. Increasing closure of the pulp mill means that less heat per unit of black liquor dry solids will be available in the furnace. The flue gas heat loss will decrease as the flue gas flow diminishes. Increasing black liquor dry solids is especially helpful since the recovery boiler capacity is often limited by the flue gas flow.

A modern recovery boiler consists of heat transfer surfaces made of steel tube; furnace-1, superheaters-2, boiler generating bank-3 and economizers-4. The steam drum-5 design is of single-drum type. The air and black liquor are introduced through primary and secondary air ports-6, liquor guns-7 and tertiary air ports-8. The combustion residue, smelt exits through smelt spouts-9 to the dissolving tank-10.

The nominal furnace loading has increased during the last ten years and will continue to increase.&lt;ref name="McCan6"&gt;{{cite book |author= Colin, McCann |title= A review of recovery boilers process design |publisher= CPPA 77th Annual meeting |year= 1991 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Changes in air design have increased furnace temperatures.&lt;ref name="Adams"&gt;{{cite book |author= Terry N., Adams |title= Air flow, mixing and modelling for recovery boilers |publisher= 30 Years Recovery Boiler Co-operation in Finland.

The average flue gas flow decreases as less water vapor is present. So the vertical flue gas velocities can be reduced even with increasing temperatures in lower furnace.

The most marked change has been the adoption of single drum construction. This change has been partly affected by the more reliable water quality control. The advantages of a single drum boiler compared to a bi drum are the improved safety and availability. Single drum boilers can be built to higher pressures and bigger capacities. Savings can be achieved with decreased erection time. There is less tube joints in the single drum construction so drums with improved startup curves can be built.

The construction of the vertical steam generating bank is similar to the vertical economizer, which based on experience is very easy to keep clean.&lt;ref name="Tran"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors= Tran HN, Barham D, Reeve DW |year=1988 |title=Sintering of fireside deposits and its impact on plugging in kraft recovery boiler |journal=Tappi Journal |volume=70 |issue= 4 |pages= |id= |url= |accessdate= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Vertical flue gas flow path improves the cleanability with high dust loading.&lt;ref name="vakki12"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Esa, Vakkilainen  |author2=Hanna, Niemitalo  |lastauthoramp=yes |title= Measurement of high dry solids fouling and improvement of sootblowing control |publisher= Proceedings of 1994 Tappi Engineering Conference, San Francisco, California|year= 1994 }}&lt;/ref&gt; To minimize the risk for plugging and maximize the efficiency of cleaning both the generating bank and the economizers are arranged on generous side spacing. Plugging of a two drum boiler bank is often caused by the tight spacing between the tubes.

The spacing between superheater panels has increased. All superheaters are now wide spaced to minimize fouling. This arrangement, in combination with sweetwater attemperators, ensures maximum protection against corrosion. With wide spacing plugging of the superheaters becomes less likely, the deposit cleaning is easier and the sootblowing steam consumption is lower. Increased number of superheaters facilitates the control of superheater outlet steam temperature especially during start ups.

The lower loops of hottest superheaters can be made of austenitic material, with better corrosion resistance. The steam velocity in the hottest superheater tubes is high, decreasing the tube surface temperature. Low tube surface temperatures are essential to prevent superheater corrosion. A high steam side pressure loss over the hot superheaters ensures uniform steam flow in tube elements.

==Future prospects==
Recovery boilers have been the preferred mode of [[Kraft process|Kraft mill]] chemical recovery since the 1930s and the process has been improved considerably since the first generation. There have been attempts to replace the Tomlinson recovery boiler with recovery systems yielding higher efficiency. The most promising candidate appears to be gasification,&lt;ref name="vakkil3"&gt;Esa K. Vakkilainen, Jaakko Pöyry/Finnish Recovery Boiler Committee, Future of recovery boiler technology http://www.soodakattilayhdistys.fi/Vakkilainen.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;T.E. Hicks and J.J. Gries, Babcock &amp; Wilcox, A Comparison of Superheat and Reheat Steam Cycles with Black Liquor Gasification for Pulp Mill Power Generation http://www.babcock.com/library/pdf/BR-1836.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; where [[Chemrec|Chemrec's]] technology for [[gasification#Gasification processes|entrained flow gasification]] of black liquor could prove to be a strong contender.&lt;ref&gt;Ingvar Landälv, The status of the Chemrec black liquor gasification concept, 2007 http://www.baumgroup.de/Renew/download/8%20-%20Landalv%20-%20paper.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Even if new technology is able to compete with traditional recovery boiler technology the transition will most likely be gradual. First, manufacturers of recovery boilers such as [[Metso]], [[Andritz AG|Andritz]] and [[Mitsubishi]], can be expected to continue development of their products. Second, Tomlinson recovery boilers have a long life span, often around 40 years, and will probably not be replaced until the end of their economic lifetime, and may in the meantime be upgraded at intervals of 10 – 15 years.

'''Sonar technician''' (abbreviated as '''ST''') is a  [[United States Navy]] occupational [[List of United States Navy ratings|rating]].

STs are responsible for underwater surveillance. They assist in safe navigation and aid in search, rescue and attack operations. They operate and repair sonar equipment. STs track underwater threats and send tracks to fire control (antisubmarine warfare controlling station) operator (ASWCS) for further evaluation and or destruction.

Sonar technicians are separated into two categories, STG (sonar technician surface) who are on surface ships and STS (sonar technician submarine) who operate on [[submarine]]s.

Sonar technicians are colloquially referred to{{By whom|date=January 2018}} as "ping jockeys" on board vessels, after the sound of active [[sonar]].

==Sonar technician submarines (STS)==
Sonar technician submarines operate (control, evaluate, and interpret data) submarine sonar, oceanographic equipment and submarine auxiliary sonar; coordinate submarine sonar and underwater interface; perform organizational and intermediate maintenance on submarine and allied equipment.  During battle stations, sonarmen track targets, passing bearing information to fire control to refine speed, range and course.  The result is a firing solution used to launch and guide torpedoes to their intended target(s).

The majority of the sonar used aboard submarines is passive, since active emissions give away a vessel's position.  Active sonar is mainly used for under ice operations.&lt;ref name="HIST"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4724">In 1931 [[RCA]] introduced a new line of '''Superette''' radio receivers. These used the [[superheterodyne]] principle but were lower cost than earlier products,in an attempt to maintain sales during the onset of the Great Depression. 

[[File:Comparison of RCA Superette R7 Table Versus R9 Console (1931).jpg|thumbnail|right|RCA Superette Console R-9 (Bottom) and RCA Superette Table Radio R-7 (Above)]]
[[File:RCA R7 Superette Superheterodyne Table Radio (1931).JPG|thumb|1931 RCA Superette R-7 Table Radio- the most common version]]

== Background ==

[[Edwin Howard Armstrong]] invented the [[superheterodyne receiver]] in 1918.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McMahon|first=Morgan E.|title=Vintage Radio 1887-1929|year=1981|publisher=Vintage Radio|location=Rolling Hills Estates, CA|isbn=0-914126-02-4|pages=12–13 and 24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Armstrong and [[RCA]] (under [[David Sarnoff]]) had a business and technical relationship, that would last into the 1940s. 

Funded by RCA, Armstrong designed a radio that can receive stations easily without complex tuning or interference from other stations. Early radio designs by Armstrong and others produced radios that were very sensitive but hard to keep under control due to the nature of radio waves operating at higher frequencies. Armstrong's superheterodyne receiver converted these high frequencies into one lower frequency. This allow the radio to be more stable or easier to tune, with less interference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Burns|first=Ken|title=Empire of the Air: The Men Who Made Radio|url=https://www.pbs.org/kenburns/empire/|publisher=PBS/WETA|accessdate=2013-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;   

The result was the RCA Radiola AR-812 and Radiola VIII Superheterodynes in 1924, the world's first consumer superheterodyne receivers. In 1924, these cost $224 and $475 respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Douglas|first=Alan|title=Radio Manufacturers of the 1920's VOL 3|year=1991|publisher=Sonoran Publishing|location=Chandler, AZ|isbn=1-886606-04-8|pages=28–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Up to 1930, RCA controlled the superheterodyne patent, and any radio manufacturer that wanted to build one had to pay royalties to RCA. In 1928 RCA launched their first [[Batteryless radio|AC operated]] superheterodyne radio, the Radiola 60 ($147 in 1928 dollars).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Douglas|first=Alan|title=Radio Manufacturers of the 1920's VOL 3|year=1991|publisher=Sonoran Publishing|location=Chandler, AZ|isbn=1-886606-04-8|pages=45–51}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

All these superhets were large and expensive. In the 1930s the depression was in full force. The trend in radios were smaller, more compact and lower cost. RCA introduced the Superette line in 1931 with the R7 table and R9 console.

== Models ==

From 1931 RCA produced a range of small mantel radios called the '''Superette''', which at introduction sold for $57.50 not including the vacuum tubes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=zJchAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=spkFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3557,2002162&amp;dq=superette+rca&amp;hl=en ''"The Smallest Big Radio Ever Built"'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radiomuseum.org/r/rca_superette_r7.html RCA Superette R7, www.radiomuseum.org]&lt;/ref&gt; "Super" was derived from  [[superheterodyne receiver|superheterodyne]]. Probably the most well known is the Model R-7, which was produced in several versions.

RCA also produced a console version, the model R-9. The R-7 and R-9 share identical chassis (using RCA tubes 280, 227, 235, 245 and 224). There were several versions of the R7 table (mantel) version: the R-7A using pentode output tubes (RCA 247), R-7DC and R-9DC for 110 VDC power, and the R-7 LW for long wave listening. These early superheterodynes had no [[Automatic gain control|AVC]] so stronger stations were louder than weaker ones.

== Spinoffs ==

RCA produced spinoffs of the Superette during the 1931-32 model year. These models are based on the R-7 design but are not called Superette in RCA's literature.&lt;ref name=RCA32&gt;{{cite book|last=RCA Victor Service Notes|first=1931-1932|year=1932|publisher=RCA Victor Company|location=Camden, NJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://sites.google.com/site/johnengsdeadtechrescue/photos/1930-1937-the-depression-and-the-rise-of-the-golden-age-of-radio&lt;/ref&gt; "Superette" was reserved for the R-7 and R-9 models.&lt;ref name=RCA32/&gt;

'''Synthetic molecular motors''' are [[molecular machine]]s capable of continuous directional rotation under an energy input.&lt;ref&gt;''Artificial molecular motors'' Salma Kassem, Thomas van Leeuwen, Anouk S. Lubbe,  Miriam R. Wilson,  Ben L. Feringa, David A. Leigh Chem. Soc. Rev., 2017 {{DOI|10.1039/C7CS00245A}} &lt;/ref&gt; Although the term "molecular motor" has traditionally referred to a naturally occurring protein that induces motion (via [[protein dynamics]]), some groups also use the term when referring to non-biological, non-peptide synthetic motors. Many chemists are pursuing the synthesis of such molecular motors.

The basic requirements for a synthetic motor are repetitive 360° motion, the consumption of energy and unidirectional rotation. The first two efforts in this direction, the chemically driven motor by Dr. T. Ross Kelly of Boston College with co-workers and the light-driven motor by Feringa and co-workers, were published in 1999 in the same issue of [[nature (journal)|Nature]]. 

==Chemically driven rotary molecular motors==
[[Image:Kelly chem motor.png|500px|right|thumb|The prototype of a chemically driven rotary molecular motor by Kelly and co-workers.]]An example of a prototype for a synthetic chemically driven rotary molecular motor was reported by Kelly and co-workers in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Unidirectional rotary motion in a molecular system|journal=Nature|volume=401|issue=6749|pages=150–2|doi=10.1038/43639|pmid=10490021|year=1999|author1=Kelly|first1=T. R.|last2=De Silva|first2=H|last3=Silva|first3=R. A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their system is made up from a three-bladed [[triptycene]] rotor and a [[helicene]], and is capable of performing a unidirectional 120° rotation.

This rotation takes place in five steps. The [[amine]] group present on the triptycene moiety is converted to an [[isocyanate]] group by condensation with [[phosgene]] ('''a'''). Thermal or spontaneous rotation around the central bond then brings the isocyanate group in proximity of the [[hydroxyl]] group located on the helicene moiety ('''b'''), thereby allowing these two groups to react with each other ('''c'''). This reaction [[Irreversibility|irreversibly]] traps the system as a [[Strain (chemistry)|strained]] cyclic [[Carbamate|urethane]] that is higher in energy and thus energetically closer to the rotational energy barrier than the original state. Further rotation of the triptycene moiety therefore requires only a relatively small amount of [[Activation energy|thermal activation]] in order to overcome this barrier, thereby releasing the strain ('''d'''). Finally, cleavage of the urethane group restores the amine and alcohol [[Functional group|functionalities]] of the molecule ('''e''').

The result of this sequence of events is a unidirectional 120° rotation of the triptycene moiety with respect to the helicene moiety. Additional forward or backward rotation of the triptycene rotor is inhibited by the helicene moiety, which serves a function similar to that of the pawl of a [[Ratchet (device)|ratchet]]. The unidirectionality of the system is a result from both the asymmetric skew of the helicene moiety as well as the strain of the cyclic urethane which is formed in '''c'''. This strain can be only be lowered by the clockwise rotation of the triptycene rotor in '''d''', as both counterclockwise rotation as well as the inverse process of '''d''' are energetically unfavorable. In this respect the preference for the rotation direction is determined by both the positions of the functional groups and the shape of the helicene and is thus built into the design of the molecule instead of dictated by external factors.

The motor by Kelly and co-workers is an elegant example of how [[chemical energy]] can be used to induce controlled, unidirectional rotational motion, a process which resembles the consumption of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] in organisms in order to fuel numerous processes. However, it does suffer from a serious drawback: the sequence of events that leads to 120° rotation is not repeatable. Kelly and co-workers have therefore searched for ways to extend the system so that this sequence can be carried out repeatedly. Unfortunately, their attempts to accomplish this objective have not been successful and currently the project has been abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Progress toward a Rationally Designed, Chemically Powered Rotary Molecular Motor|journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society|volume=129|issue=2|pages=376|doi=10.1021/ja066044a|pmid=17212418|year=2007|last1=Kelly|first1=T.

Some other examples of synthetic chemically driven rotary molecular motors that all operate by sequential addition of reagents have been reported, including the use of the [[Stereoselectivity|stereoselective]] [[Ring-opening reaction|ring opening]] of a [[Racemic mixture|racemic]] [[biaryl]] [[lactone]] by the use of chiral reagents, which results in a directed 90° rotation of one aryl with respect to the other aryl. Branchaud and co-workers have reported that this approach, followed by an additional ring closing step, can be used to accomplish a non-repeatable 180° rotation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Net directed 180° aryl–aryl bond rotation in a prototypical achiral biaryl lactone synthetic molecular motor|journal=Tetrahedron Letters|volume=46|issue=48|pages=8359|doi=10.1016/j.tetlet.2005.09.151|year=2005|last1=Lin|first1=Ying|last2=Dahl|first2=Bart J.|last3=Branchaud|first3=Bruce P.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feringa and co-workers used this approach in their design of a molecule that can repeatably perform 360° rotation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.1117090 | title = A Reversible, Unidirectional Molecular Rotary Motor Driven by Chemical Energy | year = 2005 | last1 = Fletcher | first1 = S.

In stages A and C rotation of the [[aryl]] [[wiktionary:moiety|moiety]] is restricted, although [[Magnetic helicity|helix]] inversion is possible. In stages B and D the aryl can rotate with respect to the [[naphthalene]] with [[steric effects|steric interactions]] preventing the aryl from passing the naphthalene. The rotary cycle consists of four chemically induced steps which realize the conversion of one stage into the next. Steps 1 and 3 are asymmetric ring opening reactions which make use of a chiral reagent in order to control the direction of the rotation of the aryl. Steps 2 and 4 consist of the [[protecting group|deprotection]] of the [[phenol]], followed by [[Regioselectivity|regioselective]] ring formation.

==Light-driven rotary molecular motors==
[[Image:First gen mol motor feringa.png|400px|right|thumb|Rotary cycle of the light-driven rotary molecular motor by Feringa and co-workers.]]
In 1999 the laboratory of Prof. Dr. Ben L. Feringa at the [[University of Groningen]], [[Netherlands|The Netherlands]] reported the creation of a unidirectional molecular rotor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Light-driven monodirectional molecular rotor|journal=Nature|volume=401|issue=6749|pages=152|doi=10.1038/43646|pmid=10490022|year=1999|last1=Feringa|first1=Ben L.|last2=Koumura|first2=Nagatoshi|last3=Zijlstra|first3=Robert W. J.|last4=Van Delden|first4=Richard A.|last5=Harada|first5=Nobuyuki}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their 360° molecular motor system consists of a bis-[[helicene]] connected by an [[alkene]] double bond displaying [[axial chirality]] and having two [[stereocenter]]s.

One cycle of unidirectional rotation takes 4 reaction steps. The first step is a low temperature [[endothermic reaction|endothermic]] [[photoisomerization]] of the [[trans isomer|trans]] (''P'',''P'') isomer '''1''' to the [[cis isomer|''cis'']] (''M'',''M'') '''2''' where ''P'' stands for the right-handed [[helix]] and ''M'' for the left-handed helix. In this process, the two [[axial bond|axial]] [[methyl]] groups are converted into two less [[steric hindrance|sterically]] favorable [[equatorial bond|equatorial]] methyl groups.

By increasing the temperature to 20&amp;nbsp;°C these methyl groups convert back [[exothermic reaction|exothermally]] to the (''P'',''P'') ''cis'' axial groups ('''3''') in a '''helix inversion'''. Because the axial isomer is more stable than the equatorial isomer, reverse rotation is blocked. A second photoisomerization converts (''P'',''P'') cis '''3''' into (''M'',''M'') trans '''4''', again with accompanying formation of sterically unfavorable equatorial methyl groups. A thermal isomerization process at 60&amp;nbsp;°C closes the 360° cycle back to the axial positions.
[[Image:TBu Helicenemolecularmotor.png|left|thumb|100px|Synthetic molecular motors: fluorene system]]

A major hurdle to overcome is the long reaction time for complete rotation in these systems, which does not compare to rotation speeds displayed by motor proteins in biological systems. In the fastest system to date, with a [[fluorene]] lower half, the half-life of the thermal helix inversion is 0.005 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Fine Tuning of the Rotary Motion by Structural Modification in Light-Driven Unidirectional Molecular Motors|journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society|volume=128|issue=15|pages=5127|doi=10.1021/ja058303m|pmid=16608348|year=2006|last1=Vicario|first1=Javier|last2=Walko|first2=Martin|last3=Meetsma|first3=Auke|last4=Feringa|first4=Ben L.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This compound is synthesized using the [[Barton-Kellogg reaction]].  In this molecule the slowest step in its rotation, the thermally induced helix-inversion, is believed to proceed much more quickly because the larger [[tert-butyl|''tert''-butyl]] group makes the unstable isomer even less stable than when the [[methyl]] group is used. This is because the unstable isomer is more destabilized than the transition state that leads to helix-inversion. The different behaviour of the two molecules is illustrated by the fact that the half-life time for the compound with a methyl group instead of a ''tert''-butyl group is 3.2 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Controlling the speed of rotation in molecular motors. Dramatic acceleration of the rotary motion by structural modification|journal=Chemical Communications|issue=47|pages=5910|doi=10.1039/b507264f|year=2005|last1=Vicario|first1=Javier|last2=Meetsma|first2=Auke|last3=Feringa|first3=Ben L.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Feringa principle has been incorporated into a prototype [[nanocar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=En Route to a Motorized Nanocar|journal=Organic Letters |volume=8 |issue=8 |pages=1713 |doi=10.1021/ol060445d |pmid=16597148 |year=2006 |last1=Morin |first1=Jean-François |last2=Shirai |first2=Yasuhiro |last3=Tour |first3=James M. }}&lt;/ref&gt; The car [[organic synthesis|synthesized]] has a helicene-derived engine with an oligo (phenylene ethynylene) chassis and four [[carborane]] wheels and is expected to be able to move on a solid surface with [[scanning tunneling microscopy]] monitoring, although so far this has not been observed.

In 2016 Feringa was awarded with a Nobel prize for his work on molecular motors.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3294">'''T5 retrofit conversion''' is a means of converting [[Light fixture|light fittings]] designed to use [[T8 Lamp|T8 format lamps]], so that they can use more energy-efficient T5 lamps.&lt;ref name="ct"&gt;{{Cite web|title=How to implement T5 retrofit conversion kits|url=http://www.carbontrust.com/resources/reports/advice/lighting|publisher=The Carbon Trust|accessdate=2009-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is done by electronically converting the luminaires to high frequency operation.&lt;ref name="sie"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Save It Easy|url=http://www.saveiteasy.co.uk/product-info/how-it-works/|accessdate=2009-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Differences from other fluorescent lamps==
{{See also|T5_fluorescent_lamp#Differences_with_other_fluorescent_lamps|l1=T5 fluorescent lamp}}

T5 lamps are approximately 40% smaller than [[T8 Lamp]]s. T5 lamps have a miniature bi-pin base while T8 lamps use a medium bi-pin base.&lt;ref name="lrc"&gt;{{Cite web|title=T5 Fluorescent Systems|url=http://www.lrc.rpi.edu/programs/nlpip/lightingAnswers/lat5/abstract.asp|publisher=Lighting Research Center|accessdate=2009-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conversion technology==
[[Conversion kits]] are available which will work in existing fittings containing switch start, mains frequency [[fluorescent lamp]] ballasts. The kits convert the fittings to use energy efficient, high frequency ballasts and accommodate the smaller diameter T5 lamp.&lt;ref name="ct" /&gt;

The magnetic ballast remains in place but it is bypassed, rendering it ineffective as a conductor. The new high-frequency ballast draws only 2&amp;nbsp;[[Watt|W]], rather than the 6-10&amp;nbsp;W of the old ballast, increasing the efficiency of the system.&lt;ref name="bsd"&gt;{{Cite web|title=New generation energy efficient fluorescent tubes: triphosphor|url=http://www.bsdlive.co.uk/story.asp?storycode=3110142|publisher=Building Sustainable Design|accessdate=2009-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Changing to this type of lamp without taking the ballast out of operation (rather than simply bypassing it) results in an increased power factor for the fitting. This increase in power is a result of the separate coils used in an electric ballast, as opposed to the single coil in a magnetic ballast, because it allows the electricity to flow more consistently.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thegrowlightdistrict.com/2015/08/t5-vs-t8/&lt;/ref&gt;

There are tree main types of conversion kits:
* '''Lamp-end type''' – Kits which include a replacement starter and two separate components to fit over each end of the T5 lamp. The lamp is then slotted into the existing fitting.
* '''Baton type''' – One piece kits which slot into the existing fitting and into which the T5 lamp is placed.&lt;ref name="ct" /&gt;
* '''IP65 types''' –  Waterproof [http://store.elam-lighting.eu/en/t5-retrofit-energy-save IP65 T5-module]

==Energy efficiency==
T5 retrofit conversion can maintain existing lighting levels at up to 65% reduction in energy use.&lt;ref name="sie" /&gt;

The '''Tolt pipeline''' runs from the [[Tolt Reservoir]] in the [[Cascade Range]] to the [[Lake Forest Park, Washington|Lake Forest Park]] Reservoir, owned by the City of [[Seattle]], supplying the city with about 30% of its water supply.  It passes through Seattle's northern [[Eastside (King County, Washington)|Eastside]] suburbs and also supplies several suburban cities and water districts.

The pipeline was originally built of wood slats wrapped with iron hoops.  A section of the original pipeline can be viewed at the city of [[Kirkland, Washington|Kirkland]]'s public works department.

: ''For the ironworks in the US state of Virginia, see [[Tredegar Iron Works]].''

'''Tredegar Iron and Coal Company''' was an important 19th century [[ironworks]] in [[Tredegar]], [[Wales]], which due to its need for [[coke (fuel)|coke]] became a major developer of [[coal mine]]s and particularly the [[Sirhowy Valley]] of [[South Wales]]. It is most closely associated with the [[Industrial Revolution]] and coal mining in the [[South Wales Valleys]].

==Background==
In 1778 an [[iron]] [[furnace]] was built in the upper Sirhowy Valley by Thomas Atkinson and William Barrow, who came to the area from [[London]].&lt;ref name=""&gt;"A look at Old Tredegar in photographs" Volume 1 Philip Prosser Old Bakehouse Publications 1990&lt;/ref&gt; Fuel was needed for the furnace so men were employed to dig [[coal]] at Bryn Bach and Nantybwch, the first small scale [[coal mining]] operation in the area. The furnace failed in 1794, and hence also the business.

==Sirhowy Ironworks==
In 1797, [[Samuel Homfray]], with partners [[Richard Fothergill (ironmaster)|Richard Fothergill]] and the [[Revd. Matthew Monkhouse|Matthew Monkhouse]] built a new furnace which they called the '''Sirhowy Ironworks''', leasing the land in Bedwellty, [[Newport, Wales|Newport]] from the [[Tredegar Estate]].&lt;ref name="web"&gt;[http://web.ukonline.co.uk/b.gardner/tredegar/tredpage.html B. Gardner's History of Tredegar and other information] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050219091738/http://web.ukonline.co.uk/b.gardner/tredegar/tredpage.html |date=19 February 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1800, the company was renamed the '''Tredegar Iron Company,''' named in honour of the Tredegar Estate at [[Tredegar House]] and [[Tredegar Park]] in [[Newport, Wales|Newport]]. The company was taken over by the Harfords of [[Ebbw Vale]] in 1818.&lt;ref name=TredHist&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tredegar.co.uk/history/|title=History|publisher=tredegar.co.uk|accessdate=14 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was expanded in the late 1830s and early 1840s, producing significant volumes of rails, largely for export. The works was purchased by the Tredegar Iron Company Limited in 1873 and nine years later began to produce steel.

==Operations==
The company ironworks were developed on a single site, which later became known as Whiteheads, after that company took over the southern section of the site in 1907. By 1850, TICC employed between 2000 and 3000 people at its 9 furnaces, mills shops and ancillary plants.&lt;ref name=TredHist/&gt;

However, all of this production on such a vast scale had a price. Adrian Vaughn, in his 1985 book "Grub, Water &amp; Relief," mentions that in 1832 John Gooch took a managerial post in the Tredegar iron works:
{{cquote|Utterly remote at the head of the Sirhowy valley, the town was a man-made hell. Men and children worked killing hours in the smoke and filth of the foundries and were maimed by molten metal. Their only medical help was that administered by the 'Penny Doctor.' Wages were paid in Homfray's private coinage — banks were not allowed in the town — so workers spent their coins in Homfray's shops, buying food at Homfray's prices. Poverty and malnutrition followed and disease followed both}}

With many people in such a small area, and with poor sanitation provision, there were several [[cholera]] epidemics in the town in the 19th century. A dedicated cholera burial ground was later established at [[Cefn Golau]].&lt;ref name=BG1&gt;{{cite web

===1875-1946===
In 1875, the company renamed itself the '''Tredegar Iron and Coal Company,''' to allow development of additional coal mining capacity.&lt;ref name=TredHist/&gt;

In 1891, the company ceased production of iron, but continued to develop coal mines and produce coal. The former Tredegar Ironworks were effectively abandoned, with Whiteheads taking over the southern section of the site from 1907. In 1931, they also closed down their operations, moving everything to their Newport works.&lt;ref name=TredHist/&gt;

TICC continued to develop coal mines and work pitts, until it was nationalised in 1946, becoming part of the [[National Coal Board]].&lt;ref name=TredHist/&gt; Its last chairman was [[Henry McLaren, 2nd Baron Aberconway]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dmm.org.uk/company/t1001.htm|title=Tredegar Iron and Coal Company|publisher=Durham National Coal Mining Museum|accessdate=14 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though now almost entirely redeveloped, traces of the terracing of the valley sides at the site can still be noted at OS grid reference SO 155093.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, R. 2005 ''Southeast Wales Industrial Ironworks Landscapes, Year 1: the core ironworks areas'' Report for Cadw by GGAT p65&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Masons trowel.jpg|250px|thumb|[[Masonry trowel]]]]

A '''trowel''' is a small [[hand tool]] used for digging, applying, smoothing, or moving small amounts of viscous or particulate material.  Common varieties include the [[masonry trowel]], garden trowel, and float trowel.

A [[power trowel]] is a much larger gasoline or electrically powered walk-behind device with rotating paddles used to finish concrete floors.

==Hand tool==
[[File:Trowel.JPG|thumb|200px|right|Garden trowel]]
[[File:Foundation trowel.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Ceremonial bricklayer's trowel used in laying one of the foundation stones of the commencement column of the Federal Capital city of [[Canberra]] in 1913]]
[[File:TrowelPS.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Pointing trowel used in an archaeological excavation]]

Numerous forms of trowel are used in [[masonry]], [[concrete]], and [[drywall]] construction, as well as applying adhesives such as those used in tiling and laying synthetic flooring.  [[Masonry trowel]]s are traditionally made of [[forged]] [[carbon steel]], but some newer versions are made of cast [[stainless steel]],{{cn|date=February 2017}} which has longer wear and is rust-free. These include:

*'''Bricklayer's trowel''' has an elongated triangular-shaped flat metal blade, used by [[stonemason|masons]] for leveling, spreading, and shaping [[cement]], [[plaster]], and [[mortar (masonry)|mortar]].

*'''Pointing trowel''', a scaled-down version of a bricklayer's trowel, for small jobs and repair work.

*'''Tuck pointing trowel''' is long and thin, designed for packing mortar between bricks.  

*'''Float trowel''' or '''finishing trowel''' is usually rectangular, used to smooth, level, or texture the top layer of hardening concrete.   A '''flooring trowel''' has one rectangular end and one pointed end, made to fit corners. A '''grout float''' is used for applying and working [[grout]] into gaps in floor and wall tile.

*'''Gauging trowel''' has a rounded tip, used to mix measured proportions of the different ingredients for quick set [[plaster]].

*'''Pool trowel''' is a flat-bladed tool with rounded ends used to apply coatings to concrete, especially on [[swimming pool]] decks.

*'''Margin trowel''' is a small rectangular bladed tool used to move, apply, and smooth small amounts of masonry or adhesive material.

[[File:US Navy 050705-N-1261P-025 Builder Constructionman Guthrie Kees and Utilitiesman 3rd Class Robert Jones use trowels to smooth freshly poured concrete for a new dispatch office.jpg|thumb|upright|US Navy personnel using float trowels to smooth freshly poured concrete]]

*'''Notched trowel''' is a rectangular shaped tool with regularly spaced notches along one or more sides  used to apply adhesive when adhering tile, or laying synthetic floor surfaces.

Other forms of trowel include:

*'''[[gardening|Garden]] trowel''', a tool with a pointed, scoop-shaped metal [[blade]] and wooden, metal, or plastic handle.  It is used for breaking up earth, digging small holes, especially for [[planting]] and [[weeding]], mixing in [[fertilizer]] or other additives, and transferring plants to [[container gardening|pots]].

*'''[[Cathole]] trowel''' is used for burying personal waste in the [[backcountry]].  They are often made of lighter weight materials than gardening trowels to make them easier to carry.  Also, they may have features such as [[ruler|ruled]] sides to measure for proper cathole depth or jagged edges for cutting through roots or frozen soil.  Some cathole trowels are also designed to fold-up or collapse into a smaller size for easier storage.  Others allow for items such as toilet paper to be stored inside the handle.&lt;ref name="Straight Up On The Rocks"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://straightupontherocks.co.uk/posts/174/camping-trowels-equipment-spotlight |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-07-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808042848/http://straightupontherocks.co.uk/posts/174/camping-trowels-equipment-spotlight |archivedate=2014-08-08 |df= }} Camping Trowels - Equipment Spotlight&lt;/ref&gt;

*In '''[[archaeology]]''' brick or pointing trowels (usually 4" or 5" steel trowels) are used to scratch the strata in an  [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavation]] and allow the colours of the soil to be clear, so that the different strata can be identified, processed and excavated.  In the [[United States]], there are several preferred brands of pointing trowels, including the [[Marshalltown trowel]]; while in the [[British Isles]] the [[William Hunt and Sons|WHS 4" pointing trowel]] is the traditional tool.

'''Waste House''' is a building on the [[University of Brighton]] campus in the centre of [[Brighton]] on the south coast of England.  It was built between 2012 and 2014 as a project involving hundreds of students and apprentices and was designed by Duncan Baker-Brown, an architect who also lectures at the university.  The materials consist of a wide range of construction industry and household waste—from toothbrushes and old jeans to VHS cassettes and bicycle inner tubes—and it is the first public building in Europe to be built primarily of such products.  "From a distance [resembling] an ordinary contemporary [[Townhouse|town house]]",&lt;ref name="BBM-WH"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbm-architects.co.uk/index.php/waste-house|title=Waste House, Grand Parade Campus, Brighton University|year=2015|publisher=BBM Sustainable Design|accessdate=15 September 2015|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6bZFEvQPZ|archivedate=15 September 2015|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Waste House is designed to be low-energy and sustainable, and will be in continuous use as a test-bed for the university's design, architecture and engineering students.  The building has won several awards and was shortlisted for the [[Royal Institute of British Architects]]' Stephen Lawrence Prize in September 2015.

==Background==
Waste House has its origins in an earlier project by Duncan Baker-Brown,&lt;ref name="BUA&amp;H-Team"/&gt; a senior lecturer at the university and a director of architecture firm BBM Sustainable Design&lt;ref name="BUA&amp;H-Team"/&gt; based at [[Cooksbridge railway station]] in East Sussex.&lt;ref name="BBM-Contact"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbm-architects.co.uk/index.php/contact/contact-us|title=Contact BBM|year=2015|publisher=BBM Sustainable Design|accessdate=15 September 2015|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6bZFEqqCF|archivedate=15 September 2015|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On [[Channel 4]] television programme ''The House That Kevin Built'' (2008), he and designer and television presenter [[Kevin McCloud]] assembled a "low-energy ... ecologically friendly" [[Prefabricated home|prefabricated house]] made of organic materials.  It was the first such building to be constructed in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="BUA&amp;H-Team"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mail-2684545"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2684565/The-house-junk-built-4-000-VHS-cassettes-two-tons-jeans-20-000-toothbrushes-used-build-Brightons-eco-friendly-home.html|title=The house that junk built: 4,000 VHS cassettes, two tons of jeans and 20,000 toothbrushes used to build Brighton's eco-friendly home|date=8 July 2014|publisher=[[DMG Media|Associated Newspapers Ltd]]|work=[[Daily Mail]]|accessdate=15 September 2015|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6bZFP3f15|archivedate=15 September 2015|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC-20503267"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-sussex-20503267|title=Brighton university recreates designer's rubbish house|date=26 November 2012|publisher=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=15 September 2015|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6bZFOzAnV|archivedate=15 September 2015|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Baker-Brown was responsible for the design of this building, which was in turn referred to as "The House that Kevin Built".&lt;ref name="ASME"/&gt;  Originally Baker-Brown planned simply to take down the building and re-erect it at the University.&lt;ref name="ASME"/&gt;  Instead, the temporary building formed the prototype for Waste House, and since 2008 work has been undertaken at the [[University of Brighton Faculty of Arts]] to develop the ideas and techniques used on the programme in order to build a permanent house which can be used to test materials, construction theories and new techniques.&lt;ref name="BUA&amp;H-About"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arts.brighton.ac.uk/business-and-community/the-house-that-kevin-built/about|title=About|publisher=[[University of Brighton Faculty of Arts]]|date=August 2014|accessdate=16 September 2015|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6baq0XSRk|archivedate=16 September 2015|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is intended to be "a real live research project"&lt;ref name="ASME"/&gt; as well as a building which the university and other groups can use.&lt;ref name="BUA&amp;H-About"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TreeHugger"/&gt;

==Design and construction==
Work was planned to begin in 2012 in time for an end-of-year completion date and a public opening in February 2013.&lt;ref name="BUA&amp;H-About"/&gt;  These dates were not achieved, but preparation started on 26 November 2012&lt;ref name="Mears"/&gt; and by May 2013 construction was underway.&lt;ref name="Dezeen"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BUA&amp;H-Team"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arts.brighton.ac.uk/ease/wastehouse/about/the-team|title=The Team|publisher=[[University of Brighton Faculty of Arts]]|year=2014|accessdate=15 September 2015|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6bZFEl1YD|archivedate=15 September 2015|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Work finished in April 2014, the building was featured as part of the [[Brighton Festival]] the following month,&lt;ref name="Dezeen"/&gt; the public were able to view the interior during June 2014,&lt;ref name="Mail-2684545"/&gt; and by August 2014 Waste House was complete.&lt;ref name="BUA&amp;H-About"/&gt;  Construction cost £140,000&lt;ref name="AJ"/&gt; and the total value of the contract was £200,000.&lt;ref name="RIBA-SE-Award"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ribaj.com/buildings/brighton-waste-house-brighton|title=Brighton Waste House, Brighton|date=24 April 2015|publisher=[[Royal Institute of British Architects]]|work=[[RIBA Journal]]|accessdate=15 September 2015|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6bZFPMtZX|archivedate=15 September 2015|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Waste House is the first permanent public building in Europe made from waste material.&lt;ref name="BHN-42246"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BUA&amp;H"/&gt;

Over 300 students from the University of Brighton, [[City College Brighton &amp; Hove]] (CCB) and apprentices from housing provider [[Mears Group]] were involved in the project.&lt;ref name="BHN-42246"/&gt;  The construction work was mainly undertaken by CCB students, the Mears apprentices and some volunteers,&lt;ref name="Dezeen"/&gt; led by a project manager from Mears Group.&lt;ref name="BUA&amp;H-Team"/&gt;  Students learning carpentry at CCB designed the timber-framed structure and the "fine timber staircase, finished with a decorative flourish of offcuts".&lt;ref name="Guardian"/&gt;  Many of the structural elements were created in the college's own workshops.  University of Brighton Faculty of Arts students worked with Baker-Brown on the design, the selection of materials and on interior features such as furniture.  Overall, 97.5% of the time taken to build Waste House—2,507 [[Man-hour|person-days]]—was provided by students and volunteers,&lt;ref name="Dezeen"/&gt; and about 700 people worked on the project.&lt;ref name="BUA&amp;H-Team"/&gt;  A major aim of the project was to introduce students and apprentices to sustainable building techniques and to allow them to continue testing their ideas by [[retrofitting]] new fixtures.&lt;ref name="Mears"/&gt;

==Materials==
The purpose of building Waste House was to demonstrate that material considered to be waste, and therefore destined for [[landfill]], could be used to create a viable permanent building.  Baker-Brown stated that in the United Kingdom, 20% of construction materials go to waste—so the equivalent of one house worth of unwanted material is generated for every five houses built.&lt;ref name="BHN-42246"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian"/&gt;  Between 85%&lt;ref name="BUA&amp;H"/&gt; and 90%&lt;ref name="BHN-42246"/&gt; of the materials used in Waste House are building waste of this type or ordinary household and consumer products which are no longer needed.&lt;ref name="BUA&amp;H-About"/&gt;

Sensors have been installed to monitor how well heat is kept in,&lt;ref name="Dezeen"/&gt; which will form part of a [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] project for a University of Brighton student.&lt;ref name="BUA&amp;H-About"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ASME"/&gt;  The insulation materials are revealed in various places by "little peephole windows"&lt;ref name="Guardian"/&gt; (transparent panels in the walls):&lt;ref name="Dezeen"/&gt; as well as some secondhand conventional ([[polyurethane]]) insulation material,&lt;ref name="Guardian"/&gt; there are floppy disks, 4,000 VHS cassettes, 4,000 DVD and video cases, two tonnes of denim offcuts from pairs of jeans and denim jackets, cycle inner tubes to insulate windows, and 20,000 toothbrushes.&lt;ref name="Guardian"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dezeen"/&gt;  The cassettes and other media came from the stock of rental shops which were closing down; an aeroplane cleaning company at nearby [[Gatwick Airport]] donated most of the toothbrushes, which were provided to First and Business Class passengers and discarded after one use,&lt;ref name="BUA&amp;H-About"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mail-2684545"/&gt; and some others were provided by Brighton schoolchildren; and the denim came from textile traders&lt;ref name="Dezeen"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ASME"/&gt; (in particular, one company which turned imported jeans into denim shorts by cutting off the legs).&lt;ref name="Guardian"/&gt;

Many materials were obtained on the [[Freegle]] website—a free reuse and recycling service developed from [[The Freecycle Network]].&lt;ref name="Guardian"/&gt;  These include the clay tiles on the roof,&lt;ref name="Guardian"/&gt; the kitchen&lt;ref name="Dezeen"/&gt; and some of the insulation material.&lt;ref name="ASME"/&gt;  Cat Fletcher, one of the founders of Freegle UK, was part of the Waste House project team&lt;ref name="BUA&amp;H-Team"/&gt; and was responsible for obtaining many of the materials, both from Freegle members (numbering 18,000 in the Brighton area) and from other sources.&lt;ref name="Argus-12910839"/&gt;&lt;ref name="2DN"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.2degreesnetwork.com/groups/2degrees-community/resources/how-can-20000-old-toothbrushes-be-used-insulate-house-brightons-waste-house-explains-all/|title=How can 20,000 old toothbrushes be used to insulate a house?

==Awards and reception==
In September 2015, Waste House was nominated for that year's Stephen Lawrence Prize.  This [[Royal Institute of British Architects]] (RIBA) award, named after the aspiring architect who was [[Murder of Stephen Lawrence|murdered in 1993]], is for projects with a budget of up to £1 million.  In its shortlisting for the award, which was judged in mid-October 2015, judges from the RIBA stated that the house "has sufficient scientific integrity to be taken seriously by the construction industry" and the potential to alter political attitudes to recycling.&lt;ref name="BHN-42246"/&gt;  Waste House was one of seven buildings nominated for the prize, which was won by a fishing hut designed by [[Niall McLaughlin Architects]].&lt;ref name="SLP"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.architecture.com/StirlingPrize/Awards2015/StephenLawrencePrize/RIBAStephenLawrencePrize2015.aspx|title=Stephen Lawrence Prize 2015|publisher=[[Royal Institute of British Architects]]|year=2016|accessdate=23 March 2016|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6gETSpdYB|archivedate=23 March 2016|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Waste House was one of several buildings in Sussex, along with the [[Chichester Festival Theatre]] and [[St Botolph's Church, Botolphs|St Botolph's Church]] at [[Botolphs]], to win an award at the RIBA South East Regional Awards in April 2015.  It was described as "a project with an interesting agenda" and "a collective of experiments in which students learn by application".&lt;ref name="Argus-12910839"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theargus.co.uk/news/12910839.Waste_house_given_a_top_design_gong/|title=Waste house given a top design gong|last=James|first=Ben|date=24 April 2015|publisher=[[Newsquest|Newsquest Media (Southern) Ltd]]|work=[[The Argus (Brighton)|The Argus]]|accessdate=15 September 2015|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6bZFPDeEP|archivedate=15 September 2015|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Duncan Baker-Brown also won an Argus Achievement Award from local newspaper ''[[The Argus (Brighton)|The Argus]]''.&lt;ref name="Argus-12910839"/&gt;

RIBA awarded Waste House a Sustainability Award in 2014.&lt;ref name="Argus-12910839"/&gt;  It described "some of the experiments [as] extraordinary", commenting specifically on the toothbrush insulation and the vinyl banner vapour control layers, and noted that "the continually evolving [design] brief" would "continue to question important issues of recycling that affect everyone".&lt;ref name="RIBA-SE-Award"/&gt;

The 2Degrees Network, a worldwide collaborative association of [[sustainable business]]es,&lt;ref name="2DN-About"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.2degreesnetwork.com/about/|title=Our Story|year=2015|publisher=2degrees Ltd|accessdate=16 September 2015|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6baq4lhDo|archivedate=16 September 2015|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; awarded the building a Champions Award in 2014.  Waste House was described as "an investment in educating the next generation of designers and builders to think and build more sustainably".&lt;ref name="2DN"/&gt;

In view of its low energy use, Waste House has a [[building energy rating]] of A.&lt;ref name="BUA&amp;H"/&gt;  When work started, Baker-Brown stated the aim of making it one of the United Kingdom's first A*-rated buildings.&lt;ref name="Mears"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC-20503267"/&gt;

'''Well integrity''', in regard to [[oil well]]s, is defined by [http://www.standard.no/en/sectors/energi-og-klima/petroleum/norsok-standard-categories/d-drilling/d-0104/ NORSOK D-010] as the "“Application of technical, operational and organizational solutions to reduce risk of uncontrolled release of formation fluids throughout the life cycle of a well”.  There are various facets to well integrity, including accountability/responsibility, well operating processes, well service processes, tubing/annulus integrity, tree/wellhead integrity and testing of safety systems.

==Accountability/responsibility==
Accountability is the position that ensures a particular task is being done. They typically control the budget and [[organizational chart]] structure.

Responsibility is the position that actually does the task. There are a variety of tasks associated with well integrity and responsibility can reside with a field's [[Well services|well operations engineer]], operators, well service technicians, etc.

==Well operating processes==
This includes processes such as personnel competency, well startup-operating-shutdown procedures, process to report anomalies, corrosion/erosion control, etc.

==Well service processes==
This includes processes such as personnel competency, intervention procedures, etc.

==Tubing/annulus integrity==
This refers to the integrity of the [[production tubing]].  Common threats to tubing integrity are erosion and corrosion by production fluids, which denude the steel.  The other threat is pressure differential between the tubing and the 'A' annulus.  If it exceeds the rated pressure of the tubing, there is a risk of tubing burst or tubing collapse.

This refers to the integrity of the [[Casing (oil well)|casing strings]], which bound the [[Annulus (oil well)|annuli]].  All annuli will naturally be filled to some level with brine or other fluids from the completion, though the 'A' annulus may have gas down to the lowest gas lift valve if the well is [[gas lift]]ed.  The major integrity issues comes from the differential pressure across the casings due to the weight of brine on either side.  To protect well integrity, each annulus will have a [[MAASP|Maximum Allowable Annulus Surface Pressure]].

==Tree and wellhead integrity==
This refers to the integrity of the surface (or [[subsea]]) equipment.  The [[wellhead]] and the [[Christmas tree (oil well)|tree]] are typically suitably engineered to be able to withstand the normal operating pressures.  The major integrity issues for these components surround the operation of the valves, which are prone to leaking.  For this reason, valves must be routinely maintained.

==Testing of safety systems==
This refers to testing of surface and subsurface safety systems.

'''ZDNet''' is a business technology news website published by [[CBS Interactive]], along with [[TechRepublic]]. The brand was founded on April 1, 1991, as a general interest technology portal from [[Ziff Davis]] and evolved into an enterprise IT-focused online publication owned by [[CNET Networks]].

==History==

===Beginnings: 1991 to 1995===

ZDNet began as a subscription-based digital service called "ZiffNet" that offered computing information to users of CompuServe. It featured computer industry forums, events, features and searchable archives.

Initially, ZiffNet was intended to serve as a common place to find content from all [[Ziff-Davis]] print publications. As such, ZiffNet was an expansion on an earlier online service called PCMagNet for readers of [[PC Magazine]]. Launched in 1988, PCMagNet in turn was the evolution of Ziff Davis' first electronic publishing venture, a bulletin board, which launched in 1985.&lt;ref name="Ziff-Davis"&gt;{{Cite web

  | accessdate = 1 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 20, 1995, Ziff-Davis announced the consolidation of its online information services under a single name, "ZD Net." The service had grown its membership to 275,000 subscribers across six platforms: CompuServe, Prodigy, AT&amp;T Interchange, the Microsoft Network, AppleLink and eWorld.&lt;ref name="thefreelibrary.com"&gt;{{Cite web

  | accessdate = 1 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A few months prior to the name consolidation, Ziff-Davis expanded onto the World Wide Web under the name "ZD Net."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dan Farber]], former editor-in-chief of ''[[PC Week]]'' and ''[[MacWeek]]'', was named editor-in-chief of the property.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

  | accessdate = 1 April 2010}}
&lt;/ref&gt; By June, the site was recording web traffic of 2.5 million pageviews per week.&lt;ref name="thefreelibrary.com"/&gt;

===Early history: 1995 to 2000===

By its fifth anniversary in 1996, the collective "ZD Net" brand—now on the Web, America Online, Microsoft Network and Prodigy—counted 300,000 subscribers and was named the second-highest grossing advertising site on the Web.&lt;ref name="Ziff-Davis"/&gt; The site also expanded overseas: initially to France, Germany and the U.K.; later to China, Australia, Hong Kong, Italy, Korea, Malaysia, Russia, Spain, Taiwan and India.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

  | accessdate = 1 April 2010}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, the website—now the brand's flagship property—underwent another redesign that featured topical "channels" of content. It also marked the change in name from "ZD Net" to "ZDNet."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

  | accessdate = 1 April 2010}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

====ZDNet News====

Two months prior, the company launched ZDNet News, or "ZDNN," the site's first dedicated section to original reportage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

  | accessdate = 1 April 2010}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The appointment of digital publishing executive [[Dan Rosensweig]] as ZDNet's first president capped a year of significant change for the brand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/cheggcom-names-daniel-rosensweig-as-president-and-chief-executive-officer-83367592.html|title=Chegg.com Names Daniel Rosensweig as President and Chief Executive Officer |accessdate=2010-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, ZDNet launched "Inter@active Investor," or ZDII, a spin-off website for investors that offered financial news and information on technology companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

====ZDTV====

On May 11, 1998, Ziff-Davis launched ZDTV as the first cable television channel and website to offer 24-hour programming about computing and the Internet. The venture, which was partly owned by Vulcan Enterprises, was supported with a staff of 170 and incorporated ZDNet content on its website, ZDTV.com.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; The channel would later become [[Tech TV]].

By the end of 1998, ZDNet was the dominant technology brand online. It led its closest rival, CNET, by a 26 percent margin and was the 13th most popular site on the Web, reaching 8.4 million users, or 13.4 percent of all users on the Web.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

====ZDNet the company====

In 1999, Ziff-Davis spun ZDNet off as a separate company and offered it as a tracking stock, ZDZ, to accompany the parent stock, ZD. An initial public offering raised $190 million, but the tracking stock was eliminated in early 2000 and revived as common stock.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ecommerce.hostip.info/pages/1117/Ziff-Davis-Inc-COMPUTER-TECHNICAL-PORTAL-ZDNET.html|title=Inc Ziff-Davis – Computer And Technical Portal, Zdnet}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new company soon acquired Updates.com, a software upgrade service. It was incorporated into the site's "Help Channel."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

  | accessdate = 1 April 2010}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

====Consumer expansion====

In 1999, ZDNet also launched "Tech Life," a network of six consumer-focused tech sites intended to attract parents ("FamilyPC"), music listeners ("ZDNet Music"), gadget enthusiasts ("ZDNet Equip"), gamers ("ZDNet [[GameSpot]]") and basic users ("Internet Life" with Yahoo).

It also launched "Computer Stew," a web-based comedy show about technology that featured John Hargrave and Jay Stevens,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the first ZDNet Holiday Gift Guide.

On December 30, 1999, ZDNet launched a $25 million branding campaign in response to a $100 million advertising campaign launched by rival CNET.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

ZDNet's lead over the competition narrowed by 2000. Despite a record 10.7 million unique users in January, it managed only a 13 percent lead over the next competitor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

===The CNET years: 2000 to 2007===

On July 19, 2000, CNET Networks—parent company of CNET, ZDNet's largest rival—announced that it would acquire ZDNet for about $1.6 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

  | accessdate = 1 April 2010}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Some analysts thought that the merger of CNET and ZDNet would lead to redundancy in their product offerings, but research revealed that their target audiences had just 25 percent overlap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/07/20/business/cnet-is-buying-what-remains-of-ziff-davis.html|title=CNET Is Buying What Remains Of Ziff-Davis |accessdate=2017-11-14 | work=The New York Times |first1=Greg |last1=Winter |first2=Alex |last2=Kuczynski |date=20 July 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, Ziff Davis Media Inc. reached an agreement with CNET Networks Inc. and ZDNet to regain the URLs lost in the 2000 sale of Ziff Davis Inc, to Softbank Corp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_2001_Jan_23/ai_69405336/|title=Ziff Davis Media to Regain URLs |accessdate=2001-01-23 | work=Business Wire |year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, CNET Networks launched ZDNet sister site Builder.com, a site intended for enterprise software developers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

====Realignment====

In 2003, CNET Networks redesigned and relaunched ZDNet as an enterprise-focused publication intended to help business executives make better technology decisions.

The entire site was realigned as part of a CNET Networks B2B portfolio that included CNET News.com, Builder.com and TechRepublic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mediapost.com/publications/index.cfm?fa=Articles.showArticle&amp;art_aid=16081|title=CNET Networks Re-launches ZDNet |accessdate=2003-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A "Tech Update" section was created to serve as a directory of proprietary IT research (dubbed "IT Priorities"), and a new "Power Center" was implemented to prominently feature webcasts, white papers and case studies from partners. ZDNet also offered eight enterprise-targeted newsletters, as well launched its first blogs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, ZDNet Government was launched as the brand's first industry vertical, with a mission to cater to IT professionals in the public sector. Editorial features included writing by former Utah CIO Phil Windley, TechRepublic columnist Ramon Padilla and CNET News reporter Declan McCullagh. ZDNet also launched its first original podcasts in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

====ZDNet Blogs====

In 2006, ZDNet experienced another redesign that reduced its editorial focus on traditional news articles and product reviews and emphasized a growing network of expert bloggers, now totaling more than 30. The blogs covered topics such as enterprise IT, open source, Web 2.0, Google, Apple and Microsoft, and featured journalists David Berlind, Mary Jo Foley and Larry Dignan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 19, 2008, Larry Dignan was appointed editor-in-chief of ZDNet and editorial director of TechRepublic,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

===The CBS years: 2008 to present===

On May 17, 2008, CBS Corporation announced that it would acquire CNET Networks for approximately $1.8 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

  | accessdate = 1 April 2010}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The entire company would be organized under its CBS Interactive division.

In May 2010, ZDNet redesigned its site to place emphasis on the topics its blog network covers—now "Companies," "Hardware," "Software," "Mobile," "Security" and "Research"—and de-emphasize the downloads and reviews it imported from CNET post-merger.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

==Content==

ZDNet currently operates a network of about 50 blogs loosely aligned by its major verticals: companies, hardware, software, mobile, security and IT research. Within those general areas are blogs on gadgets, management strategy, social media, datacenters, technology law, SOA, healthcare, CRM, virtualization and sustainability.

The site still offers product reviews and software downloads, which are mostly imported from CNET. It maintains an extensive database of enterprise-focused white papers.

==Awards and recognition==

At the 14th Annual Computer Press Awards in 1999, ZDNet was adjudged the Best Overall Online Site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.computerpress.org/awards/awardwinners/14thpressrelease.html|title=Technology Journalists Honor the Best in Their Field|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
