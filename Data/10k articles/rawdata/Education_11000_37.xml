'''''April Fools''''' is a 2007 [[horror film]] written and directed by Nancy Norman.

== Plot ==

While pulling an [[April Fools' Day]] prank on a [[nerd]]y classmate named Melvin, a group of high school friends (Missy, DeAnna, Eva, Diego, Malik, and Marlin) accidentally kill him when Marlin hits Melvin with a football, causing him to fall on and be impaled by a piece of [[rebar]]. Panicking, the group drag Melvin's body into a wooded area, and stage it to look like he was the victim of a random gang-related attack. Exactly one year later, DeAnna is stabbed to death by a hooded figure while [[Internship (medicine)|interning]] at a hospital. After murdering DeAnna, the killer writes "April Fools" on a wall with her blood.

Hearing about DeAnna's death, Missy meets up with the others, convinced that DeAnna's murder may have something to do with Melvin's death, though her worries are dismissed. Later, Eva is stabbed in a locker room after dance practice by the same hooded assailant, who once again writes "April Fools" on a wall in blood. Unaware of Eva's death, Missy goes to the high school's Spring Jam, despite being unnerved by surveillance footage of DeAnna's murder, accidentally left in her room by her detective father. 

At the Spring Jam, Missy recognizes the attending killer from the surveillance footage, and looks for help from Malik after witnessing Diego and a teacher be murdered. Malik and the killer fight, sparking a brawl on the dance floor that covers the killer's escape after he fatally stabs Malik. Along with the other revelers, Missy is rounded up by the authorities, and at the police station she admits to her and her friends' involvement in Melvin's death to her father. A police officer escorts Missy home, where she is confronted by "the April Fools Killer" - Marlin, who has killed the officer, and the one stationed at his house. Marlin claims that he was only one affected by Melvin's death, his life falling to shambles after it while everyone else easily moved on, enraging him. Marlin attacks Missy, but she manages to briefly incapacitate him and get outside, a recovered Marlin giving chase.

Marlin soon catches up with Missy, only to die when she hits him with a rock, and turns his own blade on him. Stumbling away from Marlin's body, Missy collapses into the arms of her father, who had gone out looking for her after piecing together the April Fools Killer's identity.

== Reception ==

Black Horror Movies wrote, "You have to love ''April Fools''. Otherwise, you might end up blowing your brains out. What feels like a film with production values above typical 'urban horror' fare turns out to be frustratingly devoid of quality. But where quality is lacking, camp appeal reigns supreme, and if camp is ''April Fools''' ultimate goal, it's downright brilliant. This is a perfect storm of incompetence on all fronts: acting, writing, direction, editing, continuity, special effects, and basic human decency."&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url = http://www.blackhorrormovies.com/aprilfools.htm|title = ''April Fools'' (2007)|last = Harris|first = Mark|publisher = Black Horror Movies|date = |website = blackhorrormovies.com|accessdate = 11 July 2012}} &lt;/ref&gt; The acting and script were criticized by Blogcritics, which gave the closing statement, "''April Fools'' fooled the hell out of me. I thought it was a horror film, but it turned out to be a bad joke."&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url = http://blogcritics.org/video/article/dvd-review-april-fools/|title = DVD Review: ''April Fools''|last = Milam|first = Matthew|publisher = Blogcritics|date = 6 September 2007|website = blogcritics.org|accessdate = 11 July 2012}} &lt;/ref&gt; ''April Fools'' was described as being like "a glorified [[YouTube]] video" that had "no style, no substance" by Direct to Video Connoisseur.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url = http://www.mattmovieguy.com/2011/04/april-fools-2007.html|title = ''April Fools'' (2007)|last = |first = |publisher = Direct to Video Connoisseur|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110913011948/http://www.mattmovieguy.com/2011/04/april-fools-2007.html|archivedate=September 13, 2011|date = 2 April 2011|website = mattmovieguy.com|accessdate = 11 July 2012}} &lt;/ref&gt;

Film Critics United said, "The young actors struggle with their lines, the story – though liberally stolen – stole only the worthless parts of movies that weren't that good anyway, the ending was completely outlandish, the camera work was spotty at best, and it wasn't scary. In fact it was quite funny."&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url = http://filmcriticsunited.com/aprilfools.html|title = ''April Fools''|last = Armstead|first = Christopher|publisher = Film Critics United|date = |website = filmcriticsunited.com|accessdate = 11 July 2012}} &lt;/ref&gt; Horror Movie a Day found the film terrible and awkward, and wrote that "it's so short (72 minutes, with lots of easily skippable padding) and lovingly stupid that I can't really muster up the energy to go off on it" and that to do so would be like "berating an infant for not knowing how to drive".&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url = http://horror-movie-a-day.blogspot.ca/2011/09/april-fools.html|title = ''April Fools'' (2007)|last = Collins|first = Brian|publisher = Horror Movie a Day|date = 22 September 2011|website = horror-movie-a-day.blogspot.ca|accessdate = 11 July 2012}} &lt;/ref&gt; A score of one out of a possible five was given by Slasherpool, which said the story was thin, the actors incompetent, the direction dreadful, the death scenes pathetic, and the picture quality extremely poor.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url=http://slasherp.nexcess.net/htm/reviews/aprilfools.htm |title=''April Fools'' |last=Fred |first=Anthro |publisher=slasherpool.starbase.se. |date= |website=[[Internet Archive]] |accessdate=11 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081016204840/http://slasherp.nexcess.net/htm/reviews/aprilfools.htm |archivedate=October 16, 2008 }} &lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bac diplome0001.jpg|thumb|right|The diploma given to all ''baccalauréat'' graduates. The diploma is issued by the ''recteur d'académie'' by delegation from the Minister of National Education.]]
The '''baccalauréat''' ({{IPA-fr|bakaloʁea}}), often known in France colloquially as '''''bac''''', is an academic qualification that French students take after high school. Introduced by [[Napoleon I]] in 1808, it is the main diploma that is required to pursue university studies.

There is also the [[European Baccalaureate]], which students take at the end of the [[European School]] education. It confirms a rounded secondary education and gives access to a wide range of [[university]] education. It differs from [[United Kingdom|British]] [[A levels]] and [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[Higher (Scottish)|Highers]] but is similar to a US two-year college diploma in that it is earned comprehensively and can be obtained in streams requiring a high level in a number of different subjects, depending on the stream.

The general streams are Sciences, Economics and Social Sciences and Literature.

==Overview==
Much like British [[Advanced Level (UK)|A levels]] or European [[Matura]], the ''baccalauréat'' allows French and international students to obtain a standardised qualification, typically at the age of 18. It qualifies holders to work in certain areas, go on to [[tertiary education]], or acquire some other professional qualification or training.

Although it is not legally required, the vast majority of students in their final year of secondary school take a final exam. Unlike some US high school diplomas, this exam is not for ''lycée'' completion but university entrance.

The word ''bac'' is also used to refer to one of the end-of-year exams that students must pass to get their ''baccalauréat'' diploma: ''le bac de philo'', for example, is the philosophy exam, which all students must take, regardless of their field of study.

Within France, there are three main types of ''baccalauréat'':
*the ''baccalauréat général'' (general baccalaureate);
*the ''baccalauréat professionnel'' (professional baccalaureate);
*the ''baccalauréat technologique'' (technological baccalaureate).


For entrance to regular [[universities]] within France, however, there are some restrictions as to the type of baccalauréat that can be presented. In some cases, it may be possible to enter a French university without the ''bac'' by taking a special exam, the ''diploma for entrance to higher education''.

Though most students take the ''bac'' at the end of secondary school, it is also possible to enter as a ''candidat libre'' (literally, "free candidate") without affiliation to a school. Students who did not take the bac upon completion of [[secondary school]] (or did not manage to pass it) and would like to attend university, or feel that the bac would help them accomplish professional aspirations, may exercise that option. The exam is the same as the one administered to secondary-school students except that free candidates are tested in Physical Education, but students' Physical Education grade is calculated based on evaluation throughout the year.

==''Baccalauréat général'' streams==
The students who sit for the ''baccalauréat général'' choose one of three streams (termed ''séries'') in the penultimate ''[[lycée]]'' year. Each stream results in a specialization and carries different weights (''coefficients'') associated with each subject. Another terminology is sometimes used, which existed before 1994 and further divided the different ''séries''. Until then, it was possible to sit for a ''bac C'' or ''D'' (which is now S), ''B'' (now ES), or ''A1, A2, A3'' (now L). People who passed the ''baccalauréat'' before the reform still use that terminology in referring their diploma. However, the streams for the ''baccalauréat général'' are now as follows:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! style="width:33%" | S &lt;br /&gt; ''scientifique''&lt;br /&gt; (sciences) 
! style="width:33%" | ES &lt;br /&gt;''sciences économiques et sociales''&lt;br /&gt; (economics and social sciences) 
! style="width:33%" | L &lt;br /&gt;''littéraire''&lt;br /&gt; (literature)
|- 
| The natural sciences stream requires a high level in [[mathematics]], [[physics]] &amp; [[chemistry]], and [[biology]] or, if available, engineering sciences. 
| The ''[[bac ES]]'' requires a high level in economics and social courses of studies but also mathematics. Students must take an [[economics]] and [[social sciences]] exam. 
| The ''[[bac L]]'' weighs [[French literature]], [[philosophy]], [[history]] &amp; [[geography]], and [[language|foreign languages]] heavily.
|}

The ''baccalauréat'' permits students to choose to sit for exams in over forty world languages or French regional languages (such as [[Alsatian language|Alsatian]], [[Catalan language|Catalan]] or [[Norman language|Norman]]).

==Content==

===''Série scientifique'' (S)===
The S stream prepares students for work in scientific fields such as [[medicine]], [[engineering]] and the [[natural sciences]]. Natural sciences students must specialise in either [[Mathematics]], [[Physics]] &amp; [[Chemistry]], [[Computer science]] or [[Geology|Earth]] &amp; [[Life Sciences]].

| Students must choose a science-related subject. They need to sum it up into a file (generally around 30 pages) and present it to several professors who will then assign them an individual rating out of 20. Five minutes are allotted for each pupil. This exam is generally prepared by groups of 3 students but they can go up to 4.  They also have to write a 2-page essay about how they participated in the project. The grade is the sum of the documents they gave, their oral presentation and, students who have presented practical experiences to illustrate their point are often valued.

===''Série économique et sociale'' (ES)===
Students of the '''''Baccalauréat économique et social''''' prepare for careers in the [[social sciences]], in [[Philosophy]] (and other human sciences) in [[management]] and [[business administration]], and in [[economics]]. The subject Economics &amp; Social Sciences is the most heavily weighed and is only offered in this stream. [[History]] &amp; [[Geography]] and [[Mathematics]] are also important subjects in ES.

===''Série littéraire'' (L)===
Students in the L stream prepare for careers in the [[humanities]] such as [[education]], [[linguistics]], [[litterature]], [[law]], [[history]] (and the other social sciences) and [[public services|public service]]. They also have interests in the [[arts]]. The most important subjects in the literary stream are [[Philosophy]] and [[French language]] and [[French literature|literature]] and other languages, usually English, German and Spanish.

===''Baccalauréat technologique''===
{{Main|Baccalauréat technologique}}

==Format==
The majority of the ''baccalauréat'' examination takes place in a week in June. For ''[[lycée]]'' students, that is the end of the last year, ''terminale''.

Most examinations are given in [[essay]]-form. The student is given a substantial block of time (depending on the exam, that is from two to five hours) to complete a multiple-page, well-argued paper. The number of pages varies from exam to exam but is usually substantial considering all answers have to be written down, explained and justified. [[Mathematics]] and [[science]] exams are problem sets but some science questions also require an essay-type answer. Foreign-language exams often have a short [[translation]] section, as well. In the S stream, the Mathematics and the Earth &amp; Life Sciences examinations sometimes contain some [[multiple-choice questions]] (''choix multiples'').

All students also have to work on a [[scientific research]] project (''travaux personnels encadrés'', or TPE). Those are generally conducted in groups of 2, 3 or 4 and focus on a subject determined by the students, under the supervision of a faculty member.

When taken in mainland France, the ''baccalauréat'' material is the same for all students in a given stream. Secrecy surrounding the material is very tight, and the envelopes containing the exams are unsealed by a high-ranking school officer (usually a principal or vice-principal) in front of the examinees only a few minutes prior to the start of the examination. The procedure is the same for each subject, in each stream. Students usually have an identification number and an assigned seat. The number is written on all exam material and the name is hidden by folding and sealing the upper right-hand corner of the examination sheet(s). That way, anonymity is respected. The correcting staff is usually a member of the teaching staff in the same district or, at a larger scale, in the same ''académie''. To avoid conflicts of interests, a teacher who has lectured to a student or group of students cannot grade that exam. Also, to ensure greater objectivity on the part of the examiners, the test is anonymous. The grader sees only an exam paper with a serial number, with all personally identifying material stripped away and forbidden from appearing, thus curbing any favoritism based upon sex, religion, national origin, or ethnicity.

Unlike the English [[GCSE]]s, [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[Standard Grade]]s or the American [[SAT]], the French ''baccalauréat'' is not a completely-standardised test. Since most answers, even for biology questions, are given in essay form, the grades may vary from grader to grader, especially in subjects like [[philosophy]] and [[French literature]].

Students generally take the [[French language]] and literature exam at the end of ''première'' since that subject is not taught in ''terminale'', where it is replaced with a philosophy course. It also has an oral examination component, along with the written part. The oral exam covers works studied throughout ''première''.

===Weight system===
Each ''baccalauréat'' stream has its own set of subjects that each carry a different weight (''coefficient''). That allows some subjects to be more important than others. For example, in the ES stream, [[Economics]] &amp; [[Social Science]] carry more weight than the [[Natural Sciences]] and so the former is more important than the latter. Students usually study more for exams that carry heavier weights since the grade that they obtain in these exams have a bigger impact on their mean grade. Whether or not one passes the ''bac'' and/or receives eventual honours are determined in the calculation of that mean.

=== Option Internationale du Baccalauréat ===
The general baccalauréat offers several additional variants. The best-known subset is the "option internationale du baccalauréat" (OIB). Sometimes confusingly translated as the "French international baccalaureat",  it is, however, unrelated to the [[International Baccalaureate]] (IB).

The OIB adds further subjects to the French national exam. Students choose one of the L, ES or S streams. It differs, as students take a two-year syllabus in literature, history and geography in a foreign language. That syllabus and the way that it is examined is modelled on the national exam of the target nation. For instance, the British Section (administered by the [[University of Cambridge]]) models the programmes on A-levels in English, History and Geography. It is therefore necessary to be fully bilingual to complete this qualification. To date there are 15 different sections supporting 14 different languages. The list is as follows: American (US), Arabic, British, Chinese, Danish, Dutch, German, Italian, Japanese, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish and Swedish.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.education.gouv.fr/cid23092/les-sections-internationales-au-lycee.html "les sections Internationales au lycée"] Education.gouv.fr Retrieved 2013-07-04&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of ''terminale'', OIB students have extra exams in Literature and History/Geography. Those exams have a high weight in the final mark of the baccalaureate and do not give extra points to OIB students. Overall, these students work much more (up to an additional 10 hours per week of classes, with a significant amount of required reading and homework attached as well) than the other general baccalauréat students, and many of them tend to go to foreign universities. University admissions tutors often consider reducing the entrance requirements for students taking the OIB compared with those taking the standard French baccalaureate to reflect the additional demands of the OIB.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OIB: The Option Internationale du Baccalauréat Explained|url=http://www.gsgi.co.uk/articles/curricula-and-exams/oib-option-internationale-du-baccalaureat|website=The Good Schools Guide|accessdate=28 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the students that attend these schools make up a fairly-small demographic, they tend to be spread over a far larger area than would traditionally be expected of a normal lycée or secondary school. As a consequence, many of these students must commute long distances, with one-hour trips each way being fairly common. The long commutes to the longer days and the increased workload that come with the OIB make system be highly demanding of students, and many students cannot handle the workload and so transfer to schools teaching the standard French baccalaureate. Thus, many consider the OIB qualification to be highly challenging and a sign of not only academic prowess but also one of tenacity and hard work.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

=== Different languages ===

To test their foreign or regional language students can choose among these different languages (not at all schools): [[English language|English]], [[German language|German]], [[Arabic]], [[Armenian language|Armenian]], [[Cambodian language|Cambodian]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Danish language|Danish]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[Modern Greek]], [[Hebrew]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]]; regional languages: [[Basque language|Basque]], [[Breton language|Breton]], [[Catalan language|Catalan]], [[Corsican language|Corsican]], [[Auvergnat (dialect)|Auvergnat]], [[Gascon language|Gascon]], [[Languedoc]], [[Limousin (dialect)|Limousin]], [[Niçard]], [[Provençal dialect|Provençal]], [[Vivaro-Alpine]], regional languages of [[Alsace]] regional languages of [[Moselle]]), [[Tahitian language|Tahitian]], [[Albanian language|Albanian]], [[Amharic]], [[Melanesian languages]], [[Bambara language|Bambara]], [[Berber language|Berber]], [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], [[Cambodian language|Cambodian]], [[Korean language|Korean]], [[Croatian language|Croatian]], [[Hausa language|Hausa]], [[Hindi]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]], [[Malaysian language|Malaysian]], [[Laotian language|Laotian]], [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]], [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]], [[Malagasy language|Malagasy]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Fula language|Fulani]], [[Romanian language|Romanian]], [[Serbian language|Serbian]], [[Slovak language|Slovak]], [[Slovenian language|Slovenian]], [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Swahili language|Swahili]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]], [[Czech language|Czech]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.education.gouv.fr/bo/2003/30/MENE0301542N.htm |title=Bulletin officiel n°30 du 24 juillet 2003 - M.J.E.N.R |publisher=Education.gouv.fr |date= |accessdate=2012-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Passing and honours==
The pass mark is 10 out of 20. The 2014 success rate for the ''baccalauréat'' in mainland France was 87.9%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://media.education.gouv.fr/file/2008/69/0/NI_provisoire_BAC2008_31690.pdf |title=NI du bac.vp |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the ''baccalauréat'', three levels of honours are given&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.admis-examen.fr/bac/mentions-examen-du-bac|title=Les mentions au BAC|website=Admis-Examen|language=fr-FR|access-date=2017-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;:
*A mark between 12 and 13.99 will earn a ''mention assez bien'' (honours);
*A mark between 14 and 15.99 will earn a ''mention bien'' (high honours);
*A mark of 16 or higher will earn a ''mention très bien'' (highest honours).
Excellent candidates who score over 18 can be awarded by the jury the unofficial and extremely-rare ''félicitations du jury'' (highest honours with praise), which is mentioned by hand on the official ''baccalauréat'' document&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. 

Honours are prestigious but not crucial, as admissions to the ''classes préparatoires'' (preparatory classes), which prepare students for the [[grande école]] examinations, are decided months before the examination.

French educators seldom use the entire grading scale. The same applies when marking the ''baccalauréat''. Therefore, students are very unlikely to get a 20 out of 20 or more (it is actually possible to get more than 20 because of options). It is also very rare to see scores lower than 5.

[[Grade inflation]] has become a concern. Between 2005 and 2016, the proportion of students who received an honour in the general baccalaureate doubled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===European section===
European section is an option in [[France|French]] [[high school]]s to teach a subject through a [[European language]] other than French. It also gives pupils the opportunity of having more hours in the language studied. It is also an opportunity to learn more about the culture of the country of which the language is being spoken. For example, learning History in Spanish the history of Spain and that of Central and South America would be emphasized. Teachers present their lessons in [[English language|English]], [[German language|German]], [[Italian language|Italian]] or [[Spanish language|Spanish]].

At the end, students can receive a "European section" mention on their [[baccalaureat]]. To have that mention, they need to get at least 12/20 on their language examination and at least 10/20 at an additional oral examination on the subject in the language.

For example, those who choose History in Spanish as an additional subject would take their Spanish examination like the rest of their classmates, who do not have History in Spanish, and get at least 12/20. They then have to pass an oral examination on history in Spanish and get at least 10/20.

===Supplemental examination===
A student who averages between 8 and 10 is permitted to sit for the ''épreuve de rattrapage'' (also called the ''second groupe''), a supplemental oral examination given in two subjects of the student's choice. A student who does well enough in those examinations to raise the overall weighted grade to a 10 gets the ''baccalauréat''. A student who does poorly in the orals and receives below a 10 may choose to repeat the final year of lycée (''terminale'').

Students may not redo the entire examination in September; the September examinations may be taken only by those who have not been able to take the June examinations for serious reasons (such as illness).

==In the United States==
There are a small number of schools which prepare students for the ''baccalauréat'' in the United States. Otherwise, it is possible to prepare for the ''baccalauréat'' with the [[CNED]], a French public institution under the oversight of the department of education dedicated to providing distance learning material. It can, of course, be taken only after completion of the necessary coursework, which is entirely in French. Upon receiving the ''baccalauréat'', students wishing to pursue postsecondary studies in the US generally will submit their lycée/high school transcripts to a college or university office of undergraduate admissions. If it is decided that the coursework, along with American standardized test scores, application essays, and letters of recommendation, merits admission, students holding the baccalauréat will be admitted to the undergraduate program to which they have applied.

==Note==
# The formula was taken from the [http://www.claudel.org Lycée Claudel website], a French lycée in Ottawa, Canada and might only be accurate for Canadian—and even Ontarian—percentage grades.  In Ontario an 80% grade is an "A" on the American Scale and the student is awarded an Ontario Scholar Diploma.  A 90% grade is an A+ on the American Scale is considered a grade with honours and automatically qualifies the student for government funded scholarships and bursuries. The formula should be used for comparison only.

[[File:Cambridge Bedells.jpg|upright|thumb|1815 engraving (from [[Rudolf Ackermann]]'s ''History of the [[University of Cambridge]]'') of an Esquire Bedell (left) and a Yeoman Bedell (right)]]

The '''bedel''' (from [[medieval Latin]] ''pedellus'' or ''bidellus'', occasionally ''bidellus generalis'', from [[Old High German]] ''bital'', ''pital'', "the one who invites, calls"; cognate with [[beadle]]) was, and is to some extent still, an administrative official at [[university|universities]] in several European countries, and often had a policiary function at the time when universities had their own jurisdiction over students.

==History of the bedel==
The office can be traced back as far as 1245, and originated in [[Paris]]. In French universities, the position was frequently open to purchase. In the medieval English universities in [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], the ''bedel'' was an administrative assistant of the [[chancellor]] and the [[proctor]]s. The bedel was, among other things, to collect fines and fees, keep rolls of scholars with the license to teach, and participate in ceremonial dress in academic processions and on other similar occasions. There were six bedels at Oxford, one superior and one inferior bedel for each faculty, while Cambridge had only two (Cobban, p.&amp;nbsp;231f); Oxford today has four bedels representing Divinity, Law, Medicine, and Arts.  The [[University of St Andrews]] has six bedels at official ceremonies and still maintains at least a single Bedel at the weekly United College chapel service. The office of [[Esquire Bedell]] is still preserved for purely ceremonial purposes at some other universities, including the [[University of Southampton]] in the UK.

==Pedell==
[[File:Pedell Payer Tübingen.jpg|thumb|{{Interlanguage link multi|Johann Friedrich Payer|de}} (1775-1851), ''Oberpedell'' ("Chief Pedell") in Tübingen, Germany, checks the behaviour of students in a pub.]]

The '''''Pedell''''' at German universities would also function as a [[Civil law notary|notary]], and had a relatively prominent position. At the [[University of Tübingen]], the ''Pedell'' was responsible both for arresting and detaining students in the [[karzer]] and for acting as prosecutor in the university court.

In universities in the [[Netherlands]] the '''''pedel''''' acts as a [[master of ceremonies]]. {{As of|2005}} the office is an entirely ceremonial one, the pedel leading public processions and acting as the [[master of ceremonies]] at [[graduation]]s and [[Ph.D.]] examinations. As a master of ceremonies, the pedel is largely mute. The only words that a pedel utters in public are "[[Wiktionary:Hora|Hora]] [[Wiktionary:Est|Est]]", announcing that the allotted time for a Ph.D. [[Test (assessment)|examination]] has expired.

At the [[University of Uppsala]] in [[Sweden]] the function of ''pedell'' is mentioned for the first time in the statutes of 1626, with a function similar to that of the [[cursor (academic)|cursor]]; in Uppsala there were several pedells, one of which was each morning to appear in front of the [[Rector (academia)|rector]], serve him at official functions and hold the silver [[sceptre]] of the university. He was also to keep a ledger over the students and keep guard over incarcerated students. The ''pedell'' at Uppsala wore a richly decorated livery in blue and yellow with silver embroidery, and carried a wooden staff with a silver button.

==Beadle==
The word [[Beadle]], the name for various similar but not identical offices in [[Scotland]] and [[England]], is of the same origin.

==Bidello==
The [[Italian language|Italian]] word ''bidello'', the person whose work is to check classrooms and schedules and, in the past, to signal the end of the class, has the same origin. The function of announcing the end of each hour-long lesson by uttering the word ''finis'' (Latin for "end") has long been abandoned due to the introduction of electrical bells and [[public address system]]s.

The '''British Educational Research Association (BERA)''' is a member-led charity to encourage educational research and its application for the improvement of practice and public benefit.

It is an association promoting a researching culture within the academic field, and shaping guidance on policy and practice within the field.&lt;ref name="Oxford"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.answers.com/topic/british-educational-research-association |title= British Educational Research Association |work=Oxford Dictionary of Education|publisher=Answers.com |accessdate=11 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They provide a forum for academic discussion through holding conferences, disseminating material, publishing current research, and designating awards for research.&lt;ref name="Oxford"/&gt; The association is open to researchers from any discipline.&lt;ref name="Oxford"/&gt; Their publications have become a well known fixture for educational research, and provide an interdisciplinary approach that includes:"''reports of experiments and surveys, discussions of conceptual and methodological issues and of underlying assumptions in educational research, accounts of research in progress, and book reviews.''"&lt;ref name="JournalSeek"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://journalseek.net/cgi-bin/journalseek/journalsearch.cgi?field=issn&amp;query=0141-1926 |title= British Educational Research Journal |work=[[JournalSeek]]|accessdate=11 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is governed by an elected Council with its President serving a two-year term. It is run on a daily basis by a permanent office staff, headed by Nick Johnson.

The '''Central University''' was founded by the [[International Central Gospel Church]] (ICGC) in [[Accra]], Ghana.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.icgchosannatemple.com/?page_id=5|title=ABOUT US {{!}} International Central Gospel Church – Hosanna Temple – Teshie, Accra, Ghana|website=www.icgchosannatemple.com|access-date=2016-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; It started off as a pastoral training institute in 1988. It was then known as the Central Bible College by June 1991. It later became the Central Christian College in 1993 and eventually became the Central University College in 1997.

== History ==
In 1988, the ''Central Bible College'' was born. In 1993, it became the ''Christian University College'' and became the Central University College (CUC) in the year 1997 after a change of name.

Central University College (CUC) is a privately owned university colleges in Ghana. Owned by the International Central Gospel Church, its founder and Chancellor, Rev. Dr. [[Mensa Otabil]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ghanatoghana.com/Ghanahomepage/pastor-mensah-otabil-ghanaians-talk-loudly | title=Mensah Otabil | accessdate=30 August 2012 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120824205546/http://www.ghanatoghana.com/Ghanahomepage/pastor-mensah-otabil-ghanaians-talk-loudly | archivedate=24 August 2012 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; has within the last two decades, emerged as a leading voice in African Christianity advocating for a proper synthesis of Christian religious expression and the translation of spirituality into practical everyday action. The Idea of CUC was birthed in 1988.

CUC started as a short-term pastoral training institute mainly for pastors of ICGC. It became a Christian University College in 1993 expanding its programs over the years to include the academic study of Christian Theology, [[Business Administration]], Economics, [[Computer Science]] and a select number of modern languages including French. Most of its current programs are offered up to the graduate level and has seen the establishment of the schools of architecture and pharmacy in the 2008/2009 academic year. In 1998, the university college was accredited by the&lt;ref&gt;National Accreditation Board&lt;/ref&gt; (NAB). A Ghanaian newspaper feature on CUC that appeared in ''The Spectator'' of Saturday 16 October 2007 described CUC as ''"a University college in a class of its own"''. The [[Valley View University]] of the Seventh Day Adventist Church was established before CUC.

Ten (10) years down the line, CUC's development has been phenomenal with the construction of a permanent campus in [[Miotso]], near [[Dahwenya]]. On 26 October 2007 CUC relocated a greater part of its campus from the heart of [[Accra]], the capital to Miotso a community near Dawhenya in the Greater Accra Region.

The University's first Registrar Mr. [[Johnson Kanda]] was the first employee of the university who drafted and put together almost all the documentation needed for the university he served a period of 10 years between 1998 and 2008.

The university's chancellor Rev. Dr. [[Mensa Otabil]] is the Head Pastor of the [[International Central Gospel Church]] (ICGC) The university's past [[President V. P. Y. Gadzekpo, FGA]] had been president since 15 September 2004 till 2012. He took over from [[Rev. Prof. Kingsley Larbi]] who was the principal of Central Christian College, Ghana. His distinguished pioneering efforts at the then Central Christian College led to the establishment of Central University College, Ghana, where he served as its first President or Vice-Chancellor from November 1998 until July 2003. The university is now headed by [[Prof. Kwesi Yankah]], who serves as the university's new president. He took over from [[Prof V. P. Y. Gadzekpo, FGA]] on 1 September 2012.

The University received a charter&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.graphic.com.gh/news/education/central-university-college-charting-a-new-agenda.html|title=Central University College - Charting a new agenda - Graphic Online - {{!}} 2016|last=Jasmine|first=Arku|newspaper=Graphic Online|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the president in 2016 and now has changed from a College to a University.

'''Critical university studies (CUS)''' is a new field examining the role of [[higher education]] in contemporary society and its relation to culture, politics, and labor. Arising primarily from [[Cultural Studies]], it takes a [[Critical theory|critical stance]] toward changes to the university since the 1970s, particularly the shift away from a strong [[Public university|public model]] of higher education to a [[neoliberal]] [[privatized]] model. Emerging largely in the United States, which has the most extensive system of higher education, the field has also seen significant work in the United Kingdom, as well as in other countries confronting neoliberalism. Key themes of CUS research are [[corporatization]], academic labor, and [[student debt]], among other issues.

Like those doing research under the banner of [[Critical Legal Studies]] (CLS), scholars of Critical University Studies often have an activist bent.&lt;ref&gt;Unger, Roberto Mangabeira, ''[http://www.robertounger.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/the-critical-legal-studies-movement-another-time-a-greater-task.pdf The Critical Legal Studies Movement]''. New York: Verso, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; CLS and CUS both analyze powerful institutions in order to draw attention to structural inequalities and embedded practices of exploitation and marginalization. In addition, both fields seek to move beyond abstract theorizing, targeting institutional practices and making proposals for policy changes.

In contrast to CLS, which has roots in elite institutions like [[Harvard]] and [[Yale]], CUS largely comes out of public colleges and universities. While CLS has tended to seek remedies in the legal system, CUS has gravitated toward student and labor union movements. Moreover, CUS has emphasized investigative reportage and exposés of current institutional policies and practices alongside academic work. Rather than a uniform group, CUS includes a range of scholars, critics, and activists, among them [[Tenure|tenured professors]], graduate students, and [[Adjunct professors in North America|adjunct instructors]].

== History ==
The term “Critical University Studies” was first defined in print by Jeffrey J. Williams in a 2012 article in ''[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]''.&lt;ref name= "Jeff"&gt;Williams, Jeffrey J. "[http://www.chronicle.com/article/An-Emerging-Field-Deconstructs/130791 An Emerging Field Deconstructs Academe]." ''The Chronicle of Higher Education'', February 19, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jaschik, Scott. "[https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2015/01/09/mla-scholars-talk-about-how-their-teaching-focuses-tough-issues-higher-ed Critical University Studies.]" ''Inside Higher Ed'', January 9, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The piece, “An Emerging Field Deconstructs Academe,” describes the “new wave of criticism of higher education” that came to the fore in the 1990s and has gained momentum in the ensuing decades. This new work has primarily come from [[Literary Studies|literary]] and cultural critics, as well as those in [[Education Studies|education]], history, [[sociology]], and [[labor studies]].&lt;ref name= "Jeff"/&gt; As Williams notes, criticism of higher education has a strong tradition, and scholars like Heather Steffen have traced CUS's lineage at least to the early 20th century, for example to [[Thorstein Veblen]]’s ''The Higher Learning in America: A Memorandum on the Conduct of Universities by Business Men'' (1918) and [[Upton Sinclair]]’s ''The Goose-Step: A Study of American Education'' (1923), which criticize the influence of business principles and [[Gilded Age]] wealth on the emerging university system.&lt;ref&gt;Steffen, Heather. “[https://www.academia.edu/426574/Intellectual_Proletarians_in_the_20th_Century Intellectual Proletarians in the 20th Century.]” ''Chronicle of Higher Education.'' November 28, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Veblen, Thorstein. ''[http://www.elegant-technology.com/resource/HI_LEARN.PDF The Higher Learning in America: A Memorandum on the Conduct of Universities by Business Men]''. 1918. Ed. Richard R. Teichgraeber III. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sinclair, Upton. ''[https://archive.org/details/goosestepstudyof00sinc The Goose-Step: A Study of American Higher Education.] Whitefish: Kessinger, 1923.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the 1960s saw a great deal of criticism of social institutions, and much focused on university campuses. [[Students for a Democratic Society]] (SDS) started with a strong statement about higher education, and [[anti-war]] and [[civil rights]] protests were a major presence on US campuses. The [[Critical Pedagogy]] movement, inspired by [[Paolo Freire]] and furthered by [[Henry Giroux]] and others, arose from this moment.&lt;ref&gt;Loughead, Tanya. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=WXy9CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR12&amp;lpg=PR12&amp;dq=critical+university+studies&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=I1dhTaSq6V&amp;sig=Ed4JM6WKR5X2zpM4LelCM5t0nkc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiU-oGAnfbVAhWJq1QKHVi3D-I4KBDoAQgnMAA#v=onepage&amp;q=critical%20university%20studies&amp;f=false Critical University: Moving Higher Education Forward]''. Lanham: MD, Lexington Books, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[feminist movement]] also played a role in criticism of the university during the ‘60s and ‘70s, with activists like [[Adrienne Rich]] calling for “a women-centered university.”&lt;ref&gt;Rich, Adrienne. “Toward a Woman-Centered University.” ''[https://books.google.com/books/about/On_Lies_Secrets_and_Silence_Selected_Pro.html?id=wSm6BwAAQBAJ On Lies, Secrets, and Silence: Selected Prose]'' 1966-1978. New York: Norton, 1979. 125-55.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980, the [[Bayh-Dole Act]] granted universities the right to patent their inventions, thereby encouraging them to conduct research with business aims in mind. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, critics began to address the new direction of higher education, often coming from the graduate student unionization movement.&lt;ref name= "Williams"/&gt; Some met in conferences such as “Reworking/Rethinking the University” at the [[University of Minnesota]] (2008–11), or came out of groups such as Edu-factory, which was inspired by the Italian [[autonomist movement]].&lt;ref&gt;"[https://rethinkingtheu.wordpress.com/ Conference – Beneath the University, the Commons]." Reworking/Rethinking the University. November 17, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Edu-factory Collective, ed. ''[https://libcom.org/files/The%20Edu-factory%20Collection%20-%20Toward%20a%20Global%20Autonomous%20University%20-%20Cognitive%20Labor,%20The%20Production%20of%20Knowledge,%20and%20Exodus%20from%20the%20Education%20Factory.pdf Toward a Global Autonomous University]''. New York, NY: Autonomedia, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

This first wave of CUS publications addressed the corporatization of higher education, along with the exploitation of academic labor and the rise of student debt. Key texts from this period include Sheila Slaughter and Larry Leslie's ''Academic Capitalism: Politics, Policies, and the Entrepreneurial University'' (1997), [[David F. Noble|David Noble's]] ''Digital Diploma Mills: The Automation of Higher Education'' (2001), Marc Bousquet's “The Waste Product of Graduate Education” (2002) and ''How the University Works: Higher Education and the Low-Wage Nation'' (2008).&lt;ref name= "Ethos"&gt;Walker, Katherine, and Benjamin Mangrum.

(2003), Stefano Harney and Fred Moten's “The University and the Undercommons" (2004), Williams’ “The Post-Welfare State University” (2006) and “Student Debt and the Spirit of Indenture” (2008), and Christopher Newfield's ''Unmaking the Public University: The Forty-Year Assault on the Middle Class'' (2008).&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Benjamin, Patrick Kavanagh and Kevin Mattson. ''[https://www.researchgate.net/file.PostFileLoader.html?id=568d242160614bf7388b4568&amp;assetKey=AS:314904119054338@1452090400464 Steal This University: The Rise of the Corporate University and an Academic Labor Movement]''.

More recently, a second wave of CUS scholars have widened the field's scope to address issues including universities’ reliance on proprietorial technology, the dominance of [[Entrepreneurship|entrepreneurial values]], and [[globalization]]. Notable texts in this vein include Newfield's ''The Great Mistake: How We Wrecked Public Universities and How We Can Fix Them'' (2016), [[Benjamin Ginsberg (political scientist)|Benjamin Ginsberg's]] ''The Fall of the Faculty: The Rise of the All-Administrative University and Why It Matters'' (2011), Robert Samuels’ ''Why Public Higher Education Should Be Free: How to Decrease Cost and Increase Quality at American Universities'' (2013).&lt;ref&gt;Newfield, Christopher.

In addition, after Britain adopted neoliberal policies and raised tuitions from minor fees to major levels, critics such as Stefan Collini, in “Browne’s Gamble” (2010), and Andrew McGettigan, in ''The Great University Gamble: Money, Markets, and the Future of Higher Education'' (2013), focused on the United Kingdom. Meng-Hsuan Chou, Isaac Kamola, and Tamson Pietsch's edited volume ''The Transnational Politics of Higher Education'' (2016) looks at globalization.&lt;ref&gt;Collini, Stefan. “[https://www.lrb.co.uk/v32/n21/stefan-collini/brownes-gamble Browne’s Gamble],” ''London Review of Books'', 32(21): 23-25, 4 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McGettigan, Andrew.

London: Routledge, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Key themes ==
Although continually responding to new trends in higher education, Critical University Studies has so far concerned itself with several key themes:

* [[Privatization]] and Corporatization: CUS research shows the various ways that public investment in universities has decreased as costs have been shifted to students and their families. As a 2014 report from public policy organization [[Demos (U.S. think tank)|Demos]] shows, state funding for higher education has progressively decreased since the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Hiltonsmith, Robert, and Tamara Draut. "[http://www.demos.org/publication/great-cost-shift-continues-state-higher-education-funding-after-recession The Great Cost Shift Continues: State Higher Education Funding After the Recession]." Demos. March 21, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, universities appear to be acting more and more like corporations, enhancing managerial administration, cutting full-time faculty labor, and treating students like customers. The result is a higher education system that functions as “a mercantile market rather than a public realm apart from the market,” with those attending reconfigured “as job seekers rather than as citizens” — a dramatic alteration from the [[Liberalism|liberal]] [[Humanism|humanistic]] university of the postwar US.&lt;ref name ="Williams"&gt;Williams, Jeffrey J. “The Need for Critical University Studies,” in ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=23SwCgAAQBAJ&amp;dq=A+New+Deal+for+the+Humanities:+Liberal+Arts+and+the+Future+of+Public+Higher+Education&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s A New Deal for the Humanities: Liberal Arts and the Future of Public Higher Education]''. Edited by Gordon Hutner and Feisal G. Mohamed. New Brunswick, NJ: Rutgers University Press, 2016. 145-157.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Wage labour|Labor]]: According to the New Faculty Majority, a US-based adjunct advocacy group that formed in 2009, three quarters of college faculty are now off the tenure track, with no access to the job stability that universities historically provided.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.newfacultymajority.info/facts-about-adjuncts/ Facts about adjuncts]." New Faculty Majority. January 16, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Of this group, over half are adjunct or part-time workers, positions characterized by low wages and lack of [[job security]]. CUS takes issue with this new norm of [[Precarious work|precarious labor]], as well as with the increasing burden on graduate students to take on heavy teaching loads. As such, CUS has organic connections to [[graduate student unionization]] and adjunct labor organization efforts.&lt;ref name= "Jeff" /&gt;
* Student Debt: In 2015, 68% of graduating students in the US left college with some student loan debt.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Zack. "[https://www.forbes.com/sites/zackfriedman/2017/02/21/student-loan-debt-statistics-2017/#48b00e25daba Student Loan Debt In 2017: A $1.3 Trillion Crisis]." Forbes, February 21, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; This marks a dramatic increase from student debt during previous eras of higher education, a development that CUS attributes to the effects of neoliberal policies on universities. For one thing, higher education now tends to be framed as a private endeavor rather than as a public service, a shift that has resulted in reductions to state funding and subsequent increases in tuition costs.&lt;ref&gt;Rizzo, Michael J. “State Preferences for Higher Education Spending: A Panel Data Analysis, 1977-2001.” ''[https://books.google.com/books/about/What_s_Happening_to_Public_Higher_Educat.html?id=9dFLSnKeKP8C What’s Happening to Public Higher Education? The Shifting Financial Burden]''. Ed. Ronald G. Ehrenberg. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2006. 3-35.&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1980, college student loan debt has increased nearly 1000% (while the price of consumer goods has increased only about 250%).&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/15/cost-of-college-degree-increase-12-fold-1120-percent-bloomberg_n_1783700.html Cost Of College Degree In U.S. Has Increased 1,120 Percent In 30 Years, Report Says]." HuffPost. August 15, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; This has been exacerbated by a shift in policy for [[For-profit higher education in the United States|for-profit institutions]]: Since the late 1990s, they have been able to receive up to 90% of their funding from federal aid, and they now represent around 25% of loan debt.&lt;ref&gt;Shen, Lucinda. "[http://fortune.com/2016/09/29/student-loan-defaults-2/ For-Profit Colleges Account for a Third of All Federal Student Loan Defaults]." Fortune. September 29, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kelchen, Robert. "[https://www.brookings.edu/blog/brown-center-chalkboard/2017/01/11/how-much-do-for-profit-colleges-rely-on-federal-funds/ How Much Do For-Profit Colleges Rely on Federal Funds?]" Brookings. January 11, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to raising awareness about the issue of growing student debt, CUS scholars push for policy changes, such as loan forgiveness and debt-free college.&lt;ref name= "JeffW" /&gt;
* Globalization: American universities are increasingly being exported to locations around the globe through the opening of [[Satellite campus|satellite and affiliate campuses]]. This practice—exemplified by schools like [[New York University]], [[Carnegie Mellon University]], and [[Duke University]]—often seems to be profit-driven rather than beneficent, with universities receiving large sums of money from local governments in exchange for the presence of the school's brand. For many scholars, the so-called “global university” is merely a perpetuation of Western [[hegemony]].&lt;ref name= "Globe" /&gt;
* [[Innovation]] and Entrepreneurship: A new wave of CUS research has drawn attention to the increasing emphasis that universities place on values of innovation and entrepreneurship. While this focus may seem harmless or even beneficial to students, CUS scholars point out the damaging effects of structuring student's college experience around these buzzwords. Both terms reflect the infiltration of a business mindset into academics, with “innovation” often entailing the mechanization of teaching and a subsequent increase in inequality among student populations.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Jeffrey J. "[https://www.dissentmagazine.org/article/innovation-for-what-the-politics-of-inequality-in-higher-education Innovation for What? The Politics of Inequality in Higher Education.]" ''Dissent'', Winter 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, entrepreneurship encourages students to adopt a corporate work ethos, with science and tech companies—and increasingly Silicon Valley billionaires—reaping the benefits of student labor.&lt;ref&gt;Wiscomb, Avery J. "[http://www.chronicle.com/article/Hyperserfs/239433 Hyperserfs: How Silicon Valley Exploits Students and Their Universities.]" ''The Chronicle for Higher Education'', March 12, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Influence ==
Critical University Studies research has contributed to student and faculty movements across US campuses, including the aforementioned New Faculty Majority, the graduate student union movement, Oregon's CORE faculty-student advocacy group, and the [[Occupy movement|Occupy]] Student Debt Campaign (on which cultural critic [[Andrew Ross (sociologist)|Andrew Ross]] has worked).&lt;ref&gt;Ross, Andrew. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=G0LzAgAAQBAJ&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s Creditocracy and the Case for Debt Refusal]''. New York: OR Books, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Petrina, Stephen. "[http://ices.library.ubc.ca/index.php/workplace/article/view/184777/184351. Critical University Studies: Workplace, Milestones, Crossroads, Respect, Truth]." Workplace: A Journal for Academic Labor 23 (2014): 62-72.&lt;/ref&gt;

CUS scholars often publish outside of traditional academic outlets, through blogs like Michael Meranze and Christopher Newfield's Remaking the University, as well as through contributions to new media like [[Jacobin (magazine)|Jacobin]], the [[Los Angeles Review of Books]] (LARB), [[Salon (website)|Salon]] and [[HuffPost]].&lt;ref&gt;Newfield, Christopher, and Michael Meranze. [http://utotherescue.blogspot.com/. Remaking the University].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ethos"/&gt; Through such non-traditional outlets, as well as through book publications and academic journal articles, CUS has helped to bring issues like student debt into the mainstream political conversation.&lt;ref name= "Williams"/&gt;

=== Unionization ===

Alongside CUS criticism and activism in the 1990s, U.S. campuses saw a rise in unionization efforts. This culminated in a 2000 decision by the [[National Labor Relations Board]] (NLRB) that graduate employees were protected by the [[National Labor Relations Act]] and could unionize.&lt;ref&gt;United Automobile Workers. "[https://uaw.org/uaw-graduate-workers-harvard-reach-historic-union-election-agreement/ UAW Graduate Workers and Harvard Reach Historic Union Election Agreement.]" News release, October 18, 2016. UAW.&lt;/ref&gt; Union efforts proliferated following this decision, with organizations like the [[United Automobile Workers]] (UAW) and the [[Service Employees International Union]] (SEIU) allying with graduate students and adjunct instructors in the fight for employee status and collective bargaining rights. Despite setbacks, including a 2004 reversal of the 2000 ruling, student and adjunct unions have made significant headway. In August 2016, the NLRB reversed itself again, ruling that graduate research and teaching assistants at private universities do have the right to unionize (UAW vs. Columbia).&lt;ref&gt;Gonzales, Richard."[https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/08/23/491090762/nlrb-rules-graduate-students-are-employees-with-the-right-to-unionize NLRB Rules Graduate Students Are Employees With The Right To Unionize]." NPR, August 23, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Developments ==
The journal ''Workplace: A Journal for Academic Labor'', co-founded by Bousquet, stemmed from early efforts in the field and continues to publish open-access issues around themes of academic labor and higher education activism.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://ices.library.ubc.ca/index.php/workplace/index Workplace: A Journal for Academic Labor]''.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, 2015 saw the formation of ''Academic Labor: Research and Artistry'', a journal devoted to issues of tenure and contingency in the university.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://journals.colostate.edu/labor Academic Labor: Research and Artistry]''.&lt;/ref&gt;
In book publishing, The [[Johns Hopkins University Press]] initiated a book series on Critical University Studies, edited by Jeffrey J. Williams and Christopher Newfield, and In the UK, [[Palgrave Macmillan|Palgrave]] also launched a series on CUS, edited by John Smyth.&lt;ref&gt;The Johns Hopkins University Press. "[http://ihum.innovate.ucsb.edu/sites/secure.lsit.ucsb.edu.engl.d7_ih/files/sitefiles/CUS%20Announcement.pdf Critical University Studies]." News release, January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.palgrave.com/gb/series/14707 Palgrave Critical University Studies]." Palgrave Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the whole, the stance of CUS against the status quo of US universities puts it at odds with individuals and administrators who are in favor of the continued privatization, corporatization, and globalization of the university.

Scholars like Williams, Steffen, and others continue to call for the incorporation of CUS into the undergraduate curriculum, encouraging students to think critically about the institutions in which they find themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Jeffrey J. “[https://muse.jhu.edu/article/229021 Teach the University!]” ''Pedagogy'' (8)1: 25-42, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Samuels, Robert. "[https://radicalteacher.library.pitt.edu/ojs/index.php/radicalteacher/article/view/382/287 Introduction: Teaching Critical University Studies]." ''Radical Teacher'', Spring 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the term first appeared in a 1964 paper by Michael Beldoch, it gained popularity in the 1995 book by that title, written by author and science journalist [[Daniel Goleman]].&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=Emotional+intelligence&amp;case_insensitive=on&amp;year_start=1900&amp;year_end=2008&amp;corpus=15&amp;smoothing=0&amp;share=&amp;direct_url=t4%3B%2CEmotional%20intelligence%3B%2Cc0%3B%2Cs0%3B%3Bemotional%20intelligence%3B%2Cc0%3B%3BEmotional%20Intelligence%3B%2Cc0%3B%3BEmotional%20intelligence%3B%2Cc0%3B%3BEMOTIONAL%20INTELLIGENCE%3B%2Cc0 | Google Ngram graph&lt;/ref&gt; Since this time, EI, and Goleman's 1995 analysis, have been criticized within the [[scientific community]],&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, Kevin R.

[[Empathy]] is typically associated with EI, because it relates to an individual connecting their personal experiences with those of others. However, a number of models exist that aim to measure levels of (empathy) EI. There are currently several models of EI. Goleman's original model may now be considered a ''mixed model'' that combines what has since been modeled separately as ''ability EI'' and ''trait EI''. Goleman defined EI as the array of skills and characteristics that drive leadership performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last= Goleman |first= Daniel |year= 1998 |title= What Makes a Leader? |publisher= Harvard Business Review |location= |page= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''trait model'' was developed by Konstantin Vasily Petrides in 2001.  It "encompasses behavioral dispositions and self perceived abilities and is measured through self report".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last1 = Petrides| first1 = Konstantin| author-link =| last2 = Furnham| first2 = Adrian| author2-link =| title = Trait Emotional Intelligence: Psychometric Investigation with Reference to Established Trait Taxonomies| newspaper = European Journal of Personality| pages = 425–448| year = 2001| url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''ability model'', developed by [[Peter Salovey]] and [[John D. Mayer|John Mayer]] in 2004, focuses on the individual's ability to process emotional information and use it to navigate the [[social environment]].&lt;ref name = "Emotional Intelligence: Theory, Findings, and Implications"&gt;{{Citation |last1= Salovey |first1= Peter |last2 = Mayer |first2 =John |last3 = Caruso |first3 = David |year= 2004|title= Emotional Intelligence: Theory, Findings, and Implications | newspaper = Psychological Inquiry | pages = 197–215 |publisher= |location= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies have shown that people with high EI have greater [[mental health]], [[job performance]], and [[leadership skills]] although no [[causal relationships]] have been shown and such findings are likely to be attributable to [[general intelligence]] and specific [[personality traits]] rather than emotional intelligence as a construct. For example, Goleman indicated that EI accounted for 67% of the abilities deemed necessary for superior performance in leaders, and mattered twice as much as technical expertise or IQ.&lt;ref&gt;Goleman, D. (1998). Working With Emotional Intelligence. New York, NY. Bantum Books.&lt;/ref&gt; Other research finds that the effect of EI on leadership and managerial performance is non-significant when ability and personality are controlled for,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cavazotte|first1=Flavia|last2=Moreno|first2=Valter|last3=Hickmann|first3=Mateus|title=Effects of leader intelligence, personality and emotional intelligence on transformational leadership and managerial performance|journal=The Leadership Quarterly|volume=23|issue=3|pages=443–455|year=2012|doi=10.1016/j.leaqua.2011.10.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that general intelligence correlates very closely with leadership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Atwater|first1=Leanne|last2=Yammarinol|first2=Francis|title=Personal attributes as predictors of superiors' and subordinates' perceptions of military academy leadership|journal=Human Relations|volume=46|issue=5|pages=645–668|year=1993|doi=10.1177/001872679304600504}}&lt;/ref&gt; Markers of EI and methods of developing it have become more widely coveted in the past decade.&lt;sup&gt;[by whom?]&lt;/sup&gt;{{when|date=October 2017}} In addition, studies have begun to provide evidence to help characterize the neural mechanisms of emotional intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barbey|first1=Aron K.|last2=Colom|first2=Roberto|last3=Grafman|first3=Jordan|title=Distributed neural system for emotional intelligence revealed by lesion mapping|journal=Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience|volume=9|issue=3|pages=265–272|doi=10.1093/scan/nss124|pmid=23171618|year=2012|pmc=3980800}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Yates|first1=Diana|title=Researchers Map Emotional Intelligence in the Brain|url=http://news.illinois.edu/news/13/0122emotional_intelligence_AronBarbey.html|website=University of Illinois News Bureau|publisher=University of Illinois|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140813092504/http://news.illinois.edu/news/13/0122emotional_intelligence_AronBarbey.html|archivedate=2014-08-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Scientists Complete 1st Map of 'Emotional Intelligence' in the Brain|url=http://health.usnews.com/health-news/news/articles/2013/01/28/scientists-complete-1st-map-of-emotional-intelligence-in-the-brain|agency=US News and World Report|date=2013-01-28|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140814225540/http://health.usnews.com/health-news/news/articles/2013/01/28/scientists-complete-1st-map-of-emotional-intelligence-in-the-brain|archivedate=2014-08-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Criticisms have centered on whether EI is a real [[intelligence]] and whether it has [[incremental validity]] over [[IQ]] and the [[Big Five personality traits]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Harms | first1 = P.

== History ==
The term "emotional intelligence" seems first to have appeared in a 1964 paper by Michael Beldoch,&lt;ref&gt;Beldoch, M. (1964), Sensitivity to expression of emotional meaning in three modes of communication, in J. R. Davitz et al., The Communication of Emotional Meaning, McGraw-Hill, pp. 31–42&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=LKqQM3CLAyQC&amp;pg=PA121&amp;lpg=PA121&amp;dq=%22Sensitivity+to+expression+of+emotional+meaning+in+three+modes+of+communication%22+Beldoch&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=oqKrhg_zer&amp;sig=ZS86mte_m-BGbNb24vZ_bTwoUjA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCIQ6AEwAGoVChMIk4vYqYzMyAIVglwsCh344g3I#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Sensitivity%20to%20expression%20of%20emotional%20meaning%20in%20three%20modes%20of%20communication%22%20Beldoch&amp;f=false "Contributions to social interactions: Social Encounters"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170905144115/https://books.google.com/books?id=LKqQM3CLAyQC&amp;pg=PA121&amp;lpg=PA121&amp;dq=%22Sensitivity+to+expression+of+emotional+meaning+in+three+modes+of+communication%22+Beldoch&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=oqKrhg_zer&amp;sig=ZS86mte_m-BGbNb24vZ_bTwoUjA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCIQ6AEwAGoVChMIk4vYqYzMyAIVglwsCh344g3I |date=2017-09-05 }} Editor: Michael Argyle, reprint online on Google Books&lt;/ref&gt; and in the 1966 paper by B. Leuner entitled ''Emotional intelligence and emancipation'' which appeared in the psychotherapeutic journal: ''Practice of child psychology and child psychiatry''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Leuner | first1 = B | year = 1966 | title = Emotional intelligence and emancipation | url = | journal = Praxis der Kinderpsychologie und Kinderpsychiatrie | volume = 15 | issue = | pages = 193–203 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983, [[Howard Gardner]]'s ''Frames of Mind: The Theory of Multiple Intelligences''&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, H. (1983). Frames of mind. New York: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt; introduced the idea that traditional types of intelligence, such as [[IQ]], fail to fully explain cognitive ability. He introduced the idea of [[multiple intelligences]] which included both ''interpersonal intelligence'' (the capacity to understand the intentions, motivations and desires of other people) and ''intrapersonal intelligence'' (the capacity to understand oneself, to appreciate one's feelings, fears and motivations).&lt;ref&gt;Smith, M.K. (2002) "Howard Gardner and multiple intelligences", ''The Encyclopedia of Informal Education'', downloaded from {{cite web |url=http://www.infed.org/thinkers/gardner.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-11-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051102035039/http://www.infed.org/thinkers/gardner.htm |archivedate=2005-11-02 |df= }} on October 31, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term subsequently appeared in Wayne Payne's [[doctoral thesis]], ''A Study of Emotion: Developing Emotional Intelligence'' in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;Payne, W.L. (1983/1986). A study of emotion: developing emotional intelligence; self integration; relating to fear, pain and desire" ''Dissertation Abstracts International'' 47, p. 203A (University microfilms No. AAC 8605928)&lt;/ref&gt;

The first published use of the term 'EQ' (Emotional Quotient) is an article by Keith Beasley in 1987 in the British Mensa magazine.&lt;ref&gt;Beasley, K. (1987). The Emotional Quotient. ''Mensa'', May 1987, p25. It should be noted that earlier use of the term E.Q has been found in a [http://stanforddailyarchive.com/cgi-bin/stanford?a=d&amp;d=stanford19791205-01.2.86.1# 1979 Stamford Daily Ad Campaign] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160625165121/http://stanforddailyarchive.com/cgi-bin/stanford?a=d&amp;d=stanford19791205-01.2.86.1 |date=2016-06-25 }} but was used to denote something quite different, The Economic Quotient&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary source inline|date=July 2016}}{{verification needed|date=July 2016}}{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

In 1989 [[Stanley Greenspan]] put forward a model to describe EI, followed by another by [[Peter Salovey]] and John Mayer published in the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Salovey | first1 = P. | last2 = Mayer | first2 = J.D. | year = 1989 | title = Emotional intelligence | url = http://ei.yale.edu/journal/imagination-cognition-and-personality/ | journal = Imagination, Cognition, and Personality | volume = 9 | issue = 3| pages = 185–211 | doi=10.2190/dugg-p24e-52wk-6cdg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the term became widely known with the publication of [[Daniel Goleman|Goleman]]'s book: ''Emotional Intelligence – Why it can matter more than IQ''&lt;ref&gt;Goleman, D., (1995) Emotional Intelligence, New York, NY, England: Bantam Books, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; (1995). It is to this book's best-selling status that the term can attribute its popularity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dan-goleman/ |title=Dan Goleman |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |accessdate=2014-03-07 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140304084501/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dan-goleman/ |archivedate=2014-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Dan Schawbel |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/danschawbel/2011/09/15/daniel-goleman-on-leadership-and-the-power-of-emotional-intelligence |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121104185806/http://www.forbes.com/sites/danschawbel/2011/09/15/daniel-goleman-on-leadership-and-the-power-of-emotional-intelligence |archivedate=2012-11-04 |title=Daniel Goleman on Leadership and The Power of Emotional Intelligence – Forbes |accessdate=2014-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goleman has followed up with several further popular publications of a similar theme that reinforce use of the term.&lt;ref&gt;Goleman, D. (1998), Working with Emotional Intelligence&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Goleman, D. (2006), Social Intelligence: The New Science of Human Relationships&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lantieri, L. and Goleman, D.

(2011), The Brain and Emotional Intelligence: New Insights&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Goleman, D. (2011), Leadership: The Power of Emotional Intelligence&lt;/ref&gt;
To date, tests measuring EI have not replaced IQ tests as a standard metric of intelligence. Emotional Intelligence has also received criticism on its role in leadership and business success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-505125_162-57376240/why-emotional-intelligence-is-just-a-fad/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121128120307/http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-505125_162-57376240/why-emotional-intelligence-is-just-a-fad/ |archivedate=2012-11-28 |title=Why emotional intelligence is just a fad – CBS News |date=2012-02-13 |accessdate=2014-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The distinction between trait emotional intelligence and ability emotional intelligence was introduced in 2000.&lt;ref name="pet2000"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Petrides | first1 = K.V. | last2 = Furnham | first2 = A. | year = 2000a | title = On the dimensional structure of emotional intelligence | url = | journal = Personality and Individual Differences | volume = 29 | issue = 2| pages = 313–320 | doi=10.1016/s0191-8869(99)00195-6| citeseerx = 10.1.1.475.5285 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definitions ==
Emotional intelligence has been defined as "the ability to monitor one's own and other people's emotions, to discriminate between different emotions and label them appropriately, and to use emotional information to guide thinking and behavior" by Peter Salovey and John Mayer. This definition was later broken down and refined into four proposed abilities: perceiving, using, understanding, and managing emotions. These abilities are distinct yet related.&lt;ref name="A Dictionary of Psychology" /&gt; Emotional intelligence also reflects abilities to join intelligence, empathy and emotions to enhance thought and understanding of interpersonal dynamics.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/5907081|title = Human Abilities: Emotional Intelligence|last = Mayer|first = John D|date = 2008|journal = Annual Review of Psychology|doi = 10.1146/annurev.psych.59.103006.093646|pmid = 17937602|access-date = |volume = 59|pages = 507–536|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151222125327/https://www.researchgate.net/publication/5907081_Human_Abilities_Emotional_Intelligence|archivedate = 2015-12-22|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, substantial disagreement exists regarding the definition of EI, with respect to both terminology and operationalizations. Currently, there are three main models of EI:
# Ability model
# Mixed model (usually subsumed under trait EI)&lt;ref name="Kluemper, D.H. 2008"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kluemper | first1 = D.H. | year = 2008 | title = Trait emotional intelligence: The impact of core-self evaluations and social desirability | url = | journal = Personality and Individual Differences | volume = 44 | issue = 6| pages = 1402–1412 | doi=10.1016/j.paid.2007.12.008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.paid.2010.05.029 | last1 = Martins | first1 = A. | last2 = Ramalho | first2 = N. | last3 = Morin | first3 = E. | year = 2010 | title = A comprehensive meta-analysis of the relationship between emotional intelligence and health | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Individual Differences | volume = 49 | issue = 6| pages = 554–564 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Trait model

Different models of EI have led to the development of various instruments for the [[psychometrics|assessment]] of the construct. While some of these measures may overlap, most researchers agree that they tap different constructs.

Specific ability models address the ways in which emotions facilitate thought and understanding. For example, emotions may interact with thinking and allow people to be better decision makers (Lyubomirsky et al. 2005).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A  person who is more responsive emotionally to crucial issues will attend to the more crucial aspects of his or her life.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Aspects of  emotional  facilitation factor is to also know how  to include or exclude emotions from thought depending on context and situation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This is also related to [[emotional reasoning]] and understanding in response to the people, environment and circumstances one encounters in his or her day-to-day life.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Ability model ==

Salovey and Mayer's conception of EI strives to define EI within the confines of the standard criteria for a new intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mayer | first1 = J.D. | last2 = Salovey | first2 = P. | last3 = Caruso | first3 = D.L. | last4 = Sitarenios | first4 = G. | year = 2001 | title = Emotional intelligence as a standard intelligence | url = | journal = Emotion | volume = 1 | issue = 3| pages = 232–242 | doi=10.1037/1528-3542.1.3.232}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = MacCann | first1 = C. | last2 = Joseph | first2 = D.L. | last3 = Newman | first3 = D.A. | last4 = Roberts | first4 = R.D. | year = 2014 | title = Emotional intelligence is a second-stratum factor of intelligence: Evidence from hierarchical and bifactor models | url = | journal = Emotion | volume = 14 | issue = 2| pages = 358–374 | doi=10.1037/a0034755| pmid = 24341786 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following their continuing research, their initial definition of EI was revised to "The ability to perceive emotion, integrate emotion to facilitate thought, understand emotions and to regulate emotions to promote personal growth." However, after pursuing further research, their definition of EI evolved into "the capacity to reason about emotions, and of emotions, to enhance thinking. It includes the abilities to accurately perceive emotions, to access and generate emotions so as to assist thought, to understand emotions and emotional knowledge, and to reflectively regulate emotions so as to promote emotional and intellectual growth." &lt;ref name="Emotional Intelligence: Theory, Findings, and Implications" /&gt;

The ability-based model views emotions as useful sources of information that help one to make sense of and navigate the social environment.&lt;ref&gt;Mayer, J.D., &amp; Salovey, P. (1997). What is emotional intelligence? In P. Salovey &amp; D. Sluyter (Eds.), Emotional development and emotional intelligence: Implications for educators (pp. 3–31). New York: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="grewal"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Salovey | first1 = P | last2 = Grewal | first2 = D | year = 2005 | title = The Science of Emotional Intelligence | url = | journal = Current Directions in Psychological Science | volume = 14 | issue = 6| page = 6 | doi=10.1111/j.0963-7214.2005.00381.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The model proposes that individuals vary in their ability to process information of an emotional nature and in their ability to relate emotional processing to a wider cognition. This ability is seen to manifest itself in certain adaptive behaviors. The model claims that EI includes four types of abilities:
# Perceiving emotions – the ability to detect and decipher emotions in faces, pictures, voices, and cultural artifacts—including the ability to identify one's own emotions. Perceiving emotions represents a basic aspect of emotional intelligence, as it makes all other processing of emotional information possible.
# Using emotions – the ability to harness emotions to facilitate various cognitive activities, such as thinking and problem solving. The emotionally intelligent person can capitalize fully upon his or her changing [[mood (psychology)|moods]] in order to best fit the task at hand.
# Understanding emotions – the ability to comprehend emotion language and to appreciate complicated relationships among emotions. For example, understanding emotions encompasses the ability to be sensitive to slight variations between emotions, and the ability to recognize and describe how emotions evolve over time.
# Managing emotions – the ability to regulate emotions in both ourselves and in others. Therefore, the emotionally intelligent person can harness emotions, even negative ones, and manage them to achieve intended goals.

The ability EI model has been criticized in the research for lacking face and predictive validity in the workplace.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.psicothema.com/pdf/3277.pdf|author1=Bradberry, T.|author2=Su, L.|date=2003|title=Ability-versus skill-based assessment of emotional intelligence|journal=Psicothema|volume=18|pages=59–66|format=PDF|accessdate=2014-03-07|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120905061723/http://www.psicothema.com/pdf/3277.pdf|archivedate=2012-09-05|df=|pmid=17295959}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in terms of construct validity, ability EI tests have great advantage over self-report scales of EI because they compare individual maximal performance to standard performance scales and do not rely on individuals' endorsement of descriptive statements about themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Convergent, discriminant, and incremental validity of competing measures of emotional intelligence|last = Brackett M.A. &amp; J.D.

=== Measurement ===

The current measure of Mayer and Salovey's model of EI, the [[Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test]] (MSCEIT) is based on a series of emotion-based problem-solving items.&lt;ref name="grewal"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mayer | first1 = J.D. | last2 = Salovey | first2 = P. | last3 = Caruso | first3 = D.R. | last4 = Sitarenios | first4 = G. | year = 2003 | title = Measuring emotional intelligence with the MSCEIT V2.0 | url = | journal = Emotion | volume = 3 | issue = 1| pages = 97–105 | doi=10.1037/1528-3542.3.1.97| pmid = 12899321 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Consistent with the model's claim of EI as a type of intelligence, the test is modeled on ability-based [[IQ tests]]. By testing a person's abilities on each of the four branches of emotional intelligence, it generates scores for each of the branches as well as a total score.

Central to the four-branch model is the idea that EI requires attunement to [[social norms]]. Therefore, the [[Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test|MSCEIT]] is [[consensus based assessment|scored in a consensus fashion]], with higher scores indicating higher overlap between an individual's answers and those provided by a worldwide sample of respondents. The MSCEIT can also be expert-scored, so that the amount of overlap is calculated between an individual's answers and those provided by a group of 21 [[emotion|emotion researchers]].&lt;ref name="grewal"/&gt;

Although promoted as an ability test, the [[Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test|MSCEIT]] is unlike standard IQ tests in that its items do not have objectively correct responses. Among other challenges, the consensus scoring criterion means that it is impossible to create items (questions) that only a minority of respondents can solve, because, by definition, responses are deemed emotionally "intelligent" only if the majority of the sample has endorsed them. This and other similar problems have led some cognitive ability experts to question the definition of EI as a genuine intelligence.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}

In a study by Føllesdal,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.psykologi.uio.no/studier/drpsych/disputaser/follesdal_summary.html |title=Emotional Intelligence as Ability: Assessing the Construct Validity of Scores from the Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test (MSCEIT) |author=Hallvard Føllesdal |others=PhD Thesis and accompanying papers – University of Oslo 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216094950/http://www.psykologi.uio.no/studier/drpsych/disputaser/follesdal_summary.html |archivedate=2008-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test|MSCEIT]] test results of 111 business leaders were compared with how their employees described their leader. It was found that there were no correlations between a leader's test results and how he or she was rated by the employees, with regard to [[empathy]], ability to motivate, and leader effectiveness. Føllesdal also criticized the Canadian company Multi-Health Systems, which administers the [[Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test|MSCEIT]] test. The test contains 141 questions but it was found after publishing the test that 19 of these did not give the expected answers. This has led Multi-Health Systems to remove answers to these 19 questions before scoring but without stating this officially.

=== Other measurements ===
Various other specific measures have also been used to assess ability in emotional intelligence. These measures include:
# Diagnostic Analysis of Non-verbal Accuracy&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; – The Adult Facial version includes  24 photographs of equal amount of happy, sad, angry, and fearful facial expressions of both high and low intensities which are balanced by gender. The tasks of the participants is to answer which of the four emotions is present in the given stimuli.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
# Japanese and Caucasian Brief Affect Recognition test&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; – Participants try to identify 56 faces of Caucasian and Japanese individuals expressing seven emotions such happiness, contempt, disgust, sadness, anger, surprise, and fear, which may also trail  off for 0.2 seconds to a different emotion.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
# Levels of Emotional Awareness Scale&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; – Participants reads 26 social scenes and answers their anticipated feelings and continuum of low to high emotional awareness.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Mixed model ==

The model introduced by Daniel Goleman&lt;ref name="goleman98"&gt;Goleman, D. (1998). Working with emotional intelligence. New York: Bantam Books&lt;/ref&gt; focuses on EI as a wide array of competencies and skills that drive leadership performance. Goleman's model outlines five main EI constructs (for more details see "What Makes A Leader" by Daniel Goleman, best of Harvard Business Review 1998):

# [[Self-awareness]] – the ability to know one's emotions, strengths, weaknesses, drives, values and goals and recognize their impact on others while using [[gut feeling]]s to guide decisions.
# [[Emotional self-regulation|Self-regulation]] – involves controlling or redirecting one's disruptive emotions and impulses and adapting to changing circumstances.
# [[Social skill]] – managing relationships to move people in the desired direction
# [[Empathy]] – considering other people's feelings especially when making decisions
# [[Motivation]] – being driven to achieve for the sake of achievement

Goleman includes a set of [[emotional competence|emotional competencies]] within each construct of EI. Emotional competencies are not innate talents, but rather learned capabilities that must be worked on and can be developed to achieve outstanding performance. Goleman posits that individuals are born with a general emotional intelligence that determines their potential for learning emotional competencies.&lt;ref name="boy"&gt;Boyatzis, R., Goleman, D., &amp; Rhee, K. (2000). Clustering competence in emotional intelligence: insights from the emotional competence inventory (ECI). In R. Bar-On &amp; J.D.A. Parker (eds.): Handbook of emotional intelligence (pp. 343–362). San Francisco: Jossey-Bass.&lt;/ref&gt; Goleman's model of EI has been criticized in the research literature as mere "[[pop psychology]]" (Mayer, Roberts, &amp; Barsade, 2008).

=== Measurement ===

Two measurement tools are based on the Goleman model:
# The Emotional Competency Inventory (ECI), which was created in 1999, and the Emotional and Social Competency Inventory (ESCI), a newer edition of the ECI was developed in 2007. The Emotional and Social Competency – University Edition (ESCI-U) is also available. These tools developed by Goleman and [[Richard Boyatzis|Boyatzis]] provide a behavioral measure of the Emotional and Social competencies.
# [[The Emotional Intelligence Appraisal]], which was created in 2001 and which can be taken as a self-report or 360-degree assessment.&lt;ref&gt;Bradberry, Travis and Greaves, Jean. (2009). ''[[Emotional Intelligence 2.0]]''. San Francisco: Publishers Group West. {{ISBN|978-0-9743206-2-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Trait model ==
{{See also|Trait theory}}
Konstantinos Vasilis Petrides ("K. V. Petrides") proposed a conceptual distinction between the ability based model and a [[Phenotypic trait|trait]] based model of EI and has been developing the latter over many years in numerous publications.&lt;ref name="pet2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="petrides07"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Petrides | first1 = K.V. | last2 = Pita | first2 = R. | last3 = Kokkinaki | first3 = F. | year = 2007 | title = The location of trait emotional intelligence in personality factor space | url = | journal = British Journal of Psychology | volume = 98 | issue = 2| pages = 273–289 | doi=10.1348/000712606x120618| pmid = 17456273 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Trait EI is "a constellation of emotional self-perceptions located at the lower levels of personality."&lt;ref name="petrides07"/&gt; In lay terms, trait EI refers to an individual's self-perceptions of their emotional abilities. This definition of EI encompasses behavioral dispositions and self-perceived abilities and is measured by [[self-report inventory|self report]], as opposed to the ability based model which refers to actual abilities, which have proven highly resistant to scientific measurement. Trait EI should be investigated within a [[personality psychology|personality]] framework.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Petrides | first1 = K.V. | last2 = Furnham | first2 = A. | year = 2001 | title = Trait emotional intelligence: Psychometric investigation with reference to established trait taxonomies | url = | journal = European Journal of Personality | volume = 15 | issue = 6| pages = 425–448 | doi=10.1002/per.416}}&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative label for the same construct is trait emotional [[self-efficacy]].

The trait EI model is general and subsumes the Goleman model discussed above. The conceptualization of EI as a personality trait leads to a construct that lies outside the [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]] of human cognitive ability. This is an important distinction in as much as it bears directly on the operationalization of the construct and the theories and hypotheses that are formulated about it.&lt;ref name="pet2000"/&gt;

=== Measurement ===

There are many self-report measures of EI,&lt;ref&gt;Pérez, J.C., Petrides, K.V., &amp; Furnham, A. (2005). [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.474.294&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf Measuring trait emotional intelligence]. In R. Schulze and R.D. Roberts (Eds.), International Handbook of Emotional Intelligence (pp.181–201). Cambridge, Massachusetts: Hogrefe &amp; Huber.&lt;/ref&gt; including the EQ-i, the Swinburne University Emotional Intelligence Test (SUEIT), and the Schutte EI model. None of these assess intelligence, abilities, or skills (as their authors often claim), but rather, they are limited measures of trait emotional intelligence.&lt;ref name="petrides07" /&gt; The most widely used and widely researched measure of self-report or self-schema (as it is currently referred to) emotional intelligence is the EQ-i 2.0. Originally known as the [[Reuven Bar-On|BarOn]] EQ-i, it was the first self-report measure of emotional intelligence available, the only measure predating Goleman's best-selling book. There are over 200 studies that have used the EQ-i or EQ-i 2.0. It has the best norms, reliability, and validity of any self-report instrument and was the first one reviewed in Buros Mental Measures Book. The EQ-i 2.0 is available in many different languages as it is used worldwide.

The TEIQue provides an operationalization for the model of Petrides and colleagues, that conceptualizes EI in terms of personality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Petrides | first1 = K.V. | last2 = Furnham | first2 = A. | year = 2003 | title = Trait emotional intelligence: behavioral validation in two studies of emotion recognition and reactivity to mood induction | url = | journal = European Journal of Personality | volume = 17 | issue = | pages = 39–75 | doi=10.1002/per.466}}&lt;/ref&gt; The test encompasses 15 subscales organized under four factors: [[Quality of life|well-being]], [[self-control]], [[emotionality]], and [[sociability]]. The [[psychometrics|psychometric]] properties of the TEIQue were investigated in a study on a French-speaking population, where it was reported that TEIQue scores were globally [[normally distributed]] and [[reliability (statistics)|reliable]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mikolajczak | first1 = Luminet | last2 = Leroy | last3 = Roy | year = 2007 | title = Psychometric Properties of the Trait Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire: Factor Structure, Reliability, Construct, and Incremental Validity in a French-Speaking Population | url = | journal = Journal of Personality Assessment | volume = 88 | issue = 3| pages = 338–353 | doi=10.1080/00223890701333431| pmid = 17518555 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The researchers also found TEIQue scores were unrelated to nonverbal reasoning ([[Raven's Progressive Matrices|Raven's matrices]]), which they interpreted as support for the personality trait view of EI (as opposed to a form of intelligence). As expected, TEIQue scores were positively related to some of the [[Big Five personality traits]] ([[extraversion]], [[agreeableness]], [[openness to experience|openness]], [[conscientiousness]]) as well as inversely related to others ([[alexithymia]], [[neuroticism]]). A number of quantitative genetic studies have been carried out within the trait EI model, which have revealed significant genetic effects and heritabilities for all trait EI scores.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1037/a0013439 | last1 = Vernon | first1 = P.A. | last2 = Petrides | first2 = K.V. | last3 = Bratko | first3 = D. | last4 = Schermer | first4 = J.A. | year = 2008 | title = A behavioral genetic study of trait emotional intelligence | url = | journal = Emotion | volume = 8 | issue = 5| pages = 635–642 | pmid = 18837613 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two recent studies (one a meta-analysis) involving direct comparisons of multiple EI tests yielded very favorable results for the TEIQue.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1080/00049530903312857 | last1 = Gardner | first1 = J.

== General effects ==
A review published in the journal of ''Annual Psychology'' found that higher emotional intelligence is positively correlated with:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
# Better social relations for children – Among children and teens, emotional intelligence positively correlates with good social interactions, relationships and negatively correlates with deviance from social norms, anti-social behavior measured both in and out of school as reported by children themselves, their own family members as well as their teachers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
# Better social relations for adults – High emotional intelligence among adults is correlated with better self-perception of social ability and more successful interpersonal relationships while less interpersonal aggression and problems.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
# Highly emotionally intelligent individuals are perceived more positively by others – Other individuals perceive those with high EI to be more pleasant, socially skilled and empathic to be around.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
# Better family and intimate relationships – High EI is correlated with better relationships with the family and intimate partners on many aspects.
# Better academic achievement – Emotional intelligence is correlated with greater achievement in academics as reported by teachers but generally not  higher grades once the factor of IQ is taken into account.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
# Better social relations during work performance and in negotiations – Higher emotional intelligence is correlated with better social dynamics at work as well as better negotiating ability.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
# Better psychological well-being - Emotional intelligence is positively correlated with higher [[life satisfaction]], self-esteem and lower levels of insecurity or depression. It is also negatively correlated with poor health choices and behavior.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
# Allows for self-compassion - Emotionally intelligent individuals are more likely to have a better understanding of themselves, and to make conscious decisions based on emotion and rationale combined. Overall, it leads a person to [[Self-actualization|self-actualization]].&lt;ref name="Self-compassion"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Heffernan|first1=Mary|last2=Quinn|first2=Mary|last3=McNulty|first3=Rita|last4=Fitzpatrick|first4=Joyce|date=2010|title=Self-compassion and emotional intelligence in nurses|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/c8f7/332816fda3b9f702204718ff69e773f1ed05.pdf|journal=International Journal of Nursing Practice|volume=16|pages=366–373|accessdate=6 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticisms of theoretical foundation ==

=== Cannot be recognized as form of intelligence ===
Goleman's early work has been criticized for assuming from the beginning that EI is a type of intelligence or [[cognitive ability]]. Eysenck (2000)&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite book|author-link = Hans Eysenck|last = Eysenck|first = H.J.|title = Intelligence: A New Look|year = 2000|isbn = 978-0-7658-0707-6|postscript = &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; writes that Goleman's description of EI contains unsubstantiated assumptions about intelligence in general, and that it even runs contrary to what researchers have come to expect when studying types of intelligence:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"[Goleman] exemplifies more clearly than most the fundamental absurdity of the tendency to class almost any type of behavior as an 'intelligence'... If these five 'abilities' define 'emotional intelligence', we would expect some evidence that they are highly correlated; Goleman admits that they might be quite uncorrelated, and in any case if we cannot measure them, how do we know they are related? So the whole theory is built on quicksand: there is no sound scientific basis."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Similarly, Locke (2005)&lt;ref name="locke"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1002/job.318 | last1 = Locke | first1 = E.A. | year = 2005 | title = Why emotional intelligence is an invalid concept | url = | journal = Journal of Organizational Behavior | volume = 26 | issue = 4| pages = 425–431 }}&lt;/ref&gt; claims that the concept of EI is in itself a misinterpretation of the intelligence construct, and he offers an alternative interpretation: it is not another form or type of intelligence, but intelligence—the ability to grasp [[abstractions]]—applied to a particular life domain: emotions. He suggests the concept should be re-labeled and referred to as a skill.

The essence of this criticism is that scientific inquiry depends on valid and consistent construct utilization, and that before the introduction of the term EI, psychologists had established theoretical distinctions between factors such as abilities and achievements, skills and habits, attitudes and values, and personality traits and emotional states.&lt;ref name="everydaypsychology"&gt;Mattiuzzi, P.G. (2008) [http://everydaypsychology.com/2008/12/emotional-intelligence-im-not-feeling.html Emotional Intelligence? I'm not feeling it.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090720053237/http://everydaypsychology.com/2008/12/emotional-intelligence-im-not-feeling.html |date=2009-07-20 }} everydaypsychology.com&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, some scholars believe that the term ''EI'' merges and conflates such accepted concepts and definitions.

=== Confusing skills with moral qualities ===

[[Adam Grant]] warned of the common but mistaken perception of EI as a desirable moral quality rather than a skill, Grant asserting that a well-developed EI is not only an instrumental tool for accomplishing goals, but has a dark side as a weapon for manipulating others by robbing them of their capacity to reason.&lt;ref name=TheAtlantic20140102&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/01/the-dark-side-of-emotional-intelligence/282720/ |title=The Dark Side of Emotional Intelligence |last=Grant |first=Adam |date=January 2, 2014 |website=The Atlantic |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6MsAko357?url=http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/01/the-dark-side-of-emotional-intelligence/282720/ |archivedate=January 24, 2014 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Has little predictive value ===

Landy (2005)&lt;ref name="landy"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Landy | first1 = F.J. | year = 2005 | title = Some historical and scientific issues related to research on emotional intelligence | url = | journal = Journal of Organizational Behavior | volume = 26 | issue = 4| pages = 411–424 | doi=10.1002/job.317}}&lt;/ref&gt; claimed that the few [[wikt:incremental|incremental]] validity studies conducted on EI have shown that it adds little or nothing to the explanation or prediction of some common outcomes (most notably academic and work success). Landy suggested that the reason why some studies have found a small increase in [[predictive validity]] is a [[methodology|methodological]] fallacy, namely, that alternative explanations have not been completely considered:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"EI is compared and contrasted with a measure of abstract intelligence but not with a personality measure, or with a personality measure but not with a measure of academic intelligence." Landy (2005)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Similarly, other researchers have raised concerns about the extent to which self-report EI measures [[correlation|correlate]] with established personality dimensions. Generally, self-report EI measures and personality measures have been said to converge because they both purport to measure personality traits.&lt;ref name="petrides07"/&gt; Specifically, there appear to be two dimensions of the [[Big Five personality traits|Big Five]] that stand out as most related to self-report EI&amp;nbsp;– [[neuroticism]] and [[extroversion]]. In particular, neuroticism has been said to relate to negative emotionality and [[anxiety (mood)|anxiety]]. Intuitively, individuals scoring high on neuroticism are likely to score low on self-report EI measures.

The interpretations of the correlations between EI questionnaires and personality have been varied. The prominent view in the scientific literature is the Trait EI view, which re-interprets EI as a collection of personality traits.&lt;ref name="Mikolajczak07"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mikolajczak | first1 = M. | last2 = Luminet | first2 = O. | last3 = Leroy | first3 = C. | last4 = Roy | first4 = E. | year = 2007 | title = Psychometric properties of the Trait Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire | url = | journal = Journal of Personality Assessment | volume = 88 | issue = 3| pages = 338–353 | doi=10.1080/00223890701333431| pmid = 17518555 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Smith08"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Smith | first1 = L. | last2 = Ciarrochi | first2 = J. | last3 = Heaven | first3 = P.

== Criticisms of measurement ==

=== Ability model ===
[[File:Tom Reed speaks at NAVAIR’s “Mentoring at the Speed of Life” event.jpg|thumb|right|A speaker describes four stages of emotional intelligence: [[self-awareness]], [[social consciousness]], [[self-care]] and relationship management, as part of [[NAVAIR]]’s “Mentoring at the Speed of Life” event]]

====Measures conformity, not ability ====
One criticism of the works of Mayer and Salovey comes from a study by Roberts et al. (2001),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Roberts | first1 = R.D. | last2 = Zeidner | first2 = M. | last3 = Matthews | first3 = G. | year = 2001 | title = Does emotional intelligence meet traditional standards for an intelligence? Some new data and conclusions | url = | journal = Emotion | volume = 1 | issue = 3| pages = 196–231 | doi=10.1037/1528-3542.1.3.196| pmid = 12934681 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which suggests that the EI, as measured by the MSCEIT, may only be measuring conformity. This argument is rooted in the MSCEIT's use of consensus-based assessment, and in the fact that scores on the MSCEIT are negatively distributed (meaning that its scores differentiate between people with low EI better than people with high EI).

==== Measures knowledge, not ability ====
Further criticism has been leveled by Brody (2004),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Brody |first1=N |year=2004 |title=What cognitive intelligence is and what emotional intelligence is not |url=http://psychometriclab.com/Brody.pdf |journal=Psychological Inquiry |volume=15 |issue=3 |pages=234–238 |doi=10.1207/s15327965pli1503_03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160207093225/http://psychometriclab.com/Brody.pdf |archivedate=2016-02-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; who claimed that unlike tests of cognitive ability, the MSCEIT "tests knowledge of emotions but not necessarily the ability to perform tasks that are related to the knowledge that is assessed". The main argument is that even though someone knows how he or she should behave in an emotionally laden situation, it doesn't necessarily follow that the person could actually carry out the reported behavior.

==== Measures personality and general intelligence ====
New research is surfacing that suggests that ability EI measures might be measuring personality in addition to general intelligence. These studies examined the multivariate effects of personality and intelligence on EI and also corrected estimates for measurement error (which is often not done in some validation studies)[cite source]. For example, a study by Schulte, Ree, Carretta (2004),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schulte | first1 = M. J. | last2 = Ree | first2 = M. J. | last3 = Carretta | first3 = T. R. | year = 2004 | title = Emotional intelligence: Not much more than g and personality | url = | = Personality and Individual Differences | volume = 37 | issue = 5| pages = 1059–1068 | doi = 10.1016/j.paid.2003.11.014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; showed that general intelligence (measured with the Wonderlic Personnel Test), agreeableness (measured by the NEO-PI), as well as gender could reliably be used to predict the measure of EI ability.

They gave a multiple correlation (R) of .81 with the MSCEIT (perfect prediction would be 1). This result has been replicated by Fiori and Antonakis (2011),;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fiori | first1 = M. | last2 = Antonakis | first2 = J. | year = 2011 | title = The ability model of emotional intelligence: Searching for valid measures | url = https://serval.unil.ch/notice/serval:BIB_B46FDCF00E58| journal = Personality and Individual Differences | volume = 50 | issue = 3| pages = 329–334 | doi = 10.1016/j.paid.2010.10.010 | type = Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt; they found a multiple R of .76 using Cattell’s "Culture Fair" intelligence test and the Big Five Inventory (BFI); significant covariates were intelligence (standardized beta = .39), agreeableness (standardized beta = .54), and openness (standardized beta = .46). Antonakis and Dietz (2011a),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Antonakis | first1 = J. | last2 = Dietz | first2 = J. | year = 2011a | title = Looking for Validity or Testing It?

§

=== Self-report measures susceptible to faking ===
More formally termed socially desirable responding (SDR), faking good is defined as a response pattern in which test-takers systematically represent themselves with an excessive positive bias (Paulhus, 2002). This bias has long been known to contaminate responses on personality inventories (Holtgraves, 2004; McFarland &amp; Ryan, 2000; Peebles &amp; Moore, 1998; Nichols &amp; Greene, 1997; Zerbe &amp; Paulhus, 1987), acting as a mediator of the relationships between self-report measures (Nichols &amp; Greene, 1997; Gangster et al., 1983).{{full citation needed|date=July 2012}}

It has been suggested that responding in a desirable way is a response set, which is a situational and temporary response pattern (Pauls &amp; Crost, 2004; Paulhus, 1991). This is contrasted with a response style, which is a more long-term trait-like quality. Considering the contexts some self-report EI inventories are used in (e.g., employment settings), the problems of response sets in high-stakes scenarios become clear (Paulhus &amp; Reid, 2001).

There are a few methods to prevent socially desirable responding on behavior inventories. Some researchers believe it is necessary to warn test-takers not to fake good before taking a personality test (e.g., McFarland, 2003). Some inventories use validity scales in order to determine the likelihood or consistency of the responses across all items.

=== Predictive power unsubstantiated ===
Landy&lt;ref name="landy"/&gt; distinguishes between the "commercial wing" and "the academic wing" of the EI movement, basing this distinction on the alleged predictive power of EI as seen by the two currents. According to Landy, the former makes expansive claims on the applied value of EI, while the latter is trying to warn users against these claims. As an example, Goleman (1998) asserts that "the most effective leaders are alike in one crucial way: they all have a high degree of what has come to be known as emotional intelligence. ...emotional intelligence is the sine qua non of leadership". In contrast, Mayer (1999) cautions "the popular literature's implication—that highly emotionally intelligent people possess an unqualified advantage in life—appears overly enthusiastic at present and unsubstantiated by reasonable scientific standards." Landy further reinforces this argument by noting that the data upon which these claims are based are held in "proprietary databases", which means they are unavailable to independent researchers for reanalysis, replication, or verification.&lt;ref name="landy"/&gt; Thus, the credibility of the findings cannot be substantiated in a scientific way, unless those datasets are made public and available for independent analysis.

In an academic exchange, Antonakis and Ashkanasy/Dasborough mostly agreed that researchers testing whether EI matters for leadership have not done so using robust research designs; therefore, currently there is no strong evidence showing that EI predicts leadership outcomes when accounting for personality and IQ.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Antonakis | first1 = J. | last2 = Ashkanasy | first2 = N.

A recently published meta-analysis seems to support the Antonakis position: In fact, Harms and Credé found that overall (and using data free from problems of common source and common methods), EI measures correlated only [[Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient|ρ]] = 0.11 with measures of [[transformational leadership]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Harms | first1 = P.

=== NICHD pushes for consensus ===
The [[National Institute of Child Health and Human Development]] has recognized that because there are divisions about the topic of emotional intelligence, the mental health community needs to agree on some guidelines to describe good mental health and positive mental living conditions. In their section, "Positive Psychology and the Concept of Health", they explain. "Currently there are six competing models of positive health, which are based on concepts such as being above normal, character strengths and core virtues, developmental maturity, social-emotional intelligence, subjective well-being, and [[Psychological resilience|resilience]]. But these concepts define health in philosophical rather than empirical terms. Dr. [Lawrence] Becker suggested the need for a consensus on the concept of positive psychological health...".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Nitkin |first1=Ralph |last2=Harris |first2=Meredith |date=August 29, 2006 |title=National Advisory Board on Medical Rehabilitation Research: Meeting for Minutes for December 2–3, 2004 |url=http://www.nichd.nih.gov/about/overview/advisory/nmrrab/minutes/2004dec.cfm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090716163703/http://www.nichd.nih.gov/about/overview/advisory/nmrrab/minutes/2004dec.cfm |archivedate=July 16, 2009 |publisher=[[National Institute of Child Health and Human Development]] |accessdate=April 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Interactions with other phenomena ==

=== Bullying ===
{{Main|Bullying and emotional intelligence}}
[[Bullying]] is [[abusive]] [[social interaction]] between peers which can include [[aggression]], [[harassment]], and [[violence]]. Bullying is typically repetitive and enacted by those who are in a position of [[Abusive power and control|power]] over the victim. A growing body of research illustrates a significant relationship between bullying and emotional intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Approach to bullying and victimization|journal = Canadian Family Physician|date = 2009-04-01|issn = 0008-350X|pmc = 2669002|pmid = 19366941|pages = 356–360|volume = 55|issue = 4|first = Jennifer|last = Lamb|first2 = Debra J.|last2 = Pepler|first3 = Wendy|last3 = Craig}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The relationship between bullying, victimization, trait emotional intelligence, self-efficacy and empathy among preadolescents|journal = Social Psychology of Education|date = 2011-07-26|issn = 1381-2890|pages = 41–58|volume = 15|issue = 1|doi = 10.1007/s11218-011-9168-9|first = Constantinos M.|last = Kokkinos|first2 = Eirini|last2 = Kipritsi}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Brief report: Emotional intelligence, victimisation and bullying in adolescents|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S014019711100025X|journal = Journal of Adolescence|date = 2012-02-01|pages = 207–211|volume = 35|issue = 1|doi = 10.1016/j.adolescence.2011.03.002|pmid = 21470670|first = Justine|last = Lomas|first2 = Con|last2 = Stough|first3 = Karen|last3 = Hansen|first4 = Luke A.|last4 = Downey}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also have shown that emotional intelligence is a key factor in the analysis of cases of cybervictimization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rey|first=Lourdes|last2=Quintana-Orts|first2=Cirenia|last3=Mérida-López|first3=Sergio|last4=Extremera|first4=Natalio|date=2018-07-01|title=Emotional intelligence and peer cybervictimisation in adolescents: Gender as moderator|journal=Comunicar|language=es|volume=26|issue=56|pages=09–18|doi=10.3916/c56-2018-01|issn=1134-3478}}&lt;/ref&gt;

by demonstrating a relevant impact on health and social adaptation.   Emotional intelligence (EI) is a set of abilities related to the understanding, use and management of emotion as it relates to one's self and others. Mayer et al., (2008) defines the dimensions of overall EI as: "accurately perceiving emotion, using emotions to facilitate thought, understanding emotion, and managing emotion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mayer | first1 = J.D. | last2 = Roberts | first2 = R.D | last3 = Barasade | first3 = S.G. | year = 2008 | title = Human abilities: Emotional intelligence | url = | journal = Annual Review of Psychology | volume = 59 | issue = | pages = 507–536 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.psych.59.103006.093646 | pmid = 17937602 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept combines emotional and intellectual processes.&lt;ref name="Tolegenova"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tolegenova | first1 = A.A. | last2 = Jakupov | first2 = S.M. | last3 = Cheung Chung | first3 = Man | last4 = Saduova | first4 = S. | last5 = Jakupov | first5 = M.S | year = 2012 | title = A theoretical formation of emotional intelligence and childhood trauma among adolescents | journal = Procedia – Social and Behavioral Sciences | volume = 69 | issue = | pages = 1891–1894 | doi = 10.1016/j.sbspro.2012.12.142 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lower emotional intelligence appears to be related to involvement in bullying, as the bully and/or the victim of bullying. EI seems to play an important role in both bullying behavior and [[victimization]] in bullying; given that EI is illustrated to be malleable, EI education could greatly improve bullying prevention and intervention initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mckenna | first1 = J. | last2 = Webb | first2 = J. | year = 2013 | title = Emotional intelligence | url = | journal = British Journal of Occupational Therapy | volume = 76 | issue = 12| page = 560 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Job performance ===
{{Main|Job performance and emotional intelligence}}
Research of EI and [[job performance]] shows mixed results: a positive relation has been found in some of the studies, while in others there was no relation or an inconsistent one.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; This led researchers Cote and Miners (2006)&lt;ref name="Côté 2006" /&gt; to offer a compensatory model between EI and IQ, that posits that the association between EI and job performance becomes more positive as cognitive intelligence decreases, an idea first proposed in the context of academic performance (Petrides, Frederickson, &amp; Furnham, 2004). The results of the former study supported the compensatory model: employees with low IQ get higher task performance and organizational citizenship behavior directed at the organization, the higher their EI. It has also been observed that there is no significant link between emotional intelligence and work attitude behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Relojo|first1=D.|last2=Pilao|first2=S.J.|last3=Dela Rosa|first3=R.|title=From passion to emotion: Emotional quotient as predictor of work attitude behavior among faculty member|journal=Journal of Educational Psychology|date=2015|volume=8|issue=4|pages=1–10|url=https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1098164.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A more recent study suggests that EI is not necessarily a universally positive trait.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Farh|first=C. C.|author2=Seo, Tesluk|title=Emotional Intelligence, Teamwork Effectiveness, and Job Performance: The Moderating Role of Job Context|journal=Journal of Applied Psychology|date=March 5, 2012|volume=97|issue=4|doi=10.1037/a0027377|pages=890–900|pmid=22390388}}&lt;/ref&gt; They found a negative correlation between EI and managerial work demands; while under low levels of managerial work demands, they found a negative relationship between EI and teamwork effectiveness. An explanation for this may suggest gender differences in EI, as women tend to score higher levels than men.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt; This furthers the idea that job context plays a role in the relationships between EI, teamwork effectiveness, and job performance. Another find was discussed in a study that assessed a possible link between EI and entrepreneurial behaviors and success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ahmetoglu|first=Gorkan|author2=Leutner, Franziska|author3=Chamorro-Premuzic, Tomas|title=EQ-nomics: Understanding the relationship between individual differences in trait emotional intelligence and entrepreneurship|journal=Personality and Individual Differences|date=December 2011|volume=51|issue=8|pages=1028–1033|doi=10.1016/j.paid.2011.08.016&lt;!--pmid=893295016--&gt;|url=http://www.drtomascp.com/uploads/EQNomics_PAID_2011.pdf|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131101125012/http://www.drtomascp.com/uploads/EQNomics_PAID_2011.pdf|archivedate=2013-11-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although studies between emotional intelligence (EI) and job performance has shown mixed results of high and low correlations, EI is undeniably better predictor than most of the hiring methods commonly used in companies, such as [[Recommendation letter|letter of references]], [[cover letter]], among others. By 2008, 147 companies and consulting firms in U.S had developed programmes that involved EI for training and hiring employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Joseph|first=Dana L.|last2=Jin|first2=Jing|last3=Newman|first3=Daniel A.|last4=O’Boyle|first4=Ernest H.|title=Why does self-reported emotional intelligence predict job performance?

These findings may contribute organisations in different ways. For instance, employees high on EI would be more aware of their own emotions and from others, which in turn, could lead companies to better profits and less unnecessary expenses. This is especially important for expatriate managers, who have to deal with mixed emotions and feelings, while adapting to a new working culture.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Moreover, employees high in EI show more confidence in their roles, which allow them to face demanding tasks positively.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sy|first=Thomas|last2=Tram|first2=Susanna|last3=O’Hara|first3=Linda A.|date=2006-06-01|title=Relation of employee and manager emotional intelligence to job satisfaction and performance|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001879105001260|journal=Journal of Vocational Behavior|volume=68|issue=3|pages=461–473|doi=10.1016/j.jvb.2005.10.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a popular science book by the journalist Daniel Goleman, emotional intelligence accounts for more career success than IQ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Goleman|first1=Daniel|title=Emotional Intelligence|date=1994|publisher=Bantam Books|isbn=9780747526254}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, other studies argued that employees high on EI perform substantially better than employees low in EI.

In the job performance – emotional intelligence correlation is important to consider the effects of [[Managing up and managing down|managing up]], which refers to the good and positive relationship between the employee and his/her supervisor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://hbr.org/2015/01/what-everyone-should-know-about-managing-up|title=What Everyone Should Know About Managing Up|website=Harvard Business Review|access-date=2016-04-19|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160426042345/https://hbr.org/2015/01/what-everyone-should-know-about-managing-up|archivedate=2016-04-26|df=|date=2015-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previous research found that quality of this relationship could interfere in the results of the subjective rating of job performance evaluation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Janssen|first=Onne|last2=Yperen|first2=Nico W.

Hence, the likelihood of  obtaining better results on performance evaluation is greater for employees high in EI than for employees with low EI.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  Based on theoretical and methodological approaches, EI measures are categorized in three main streams: (1) stream 1: ability-based measures (e.g. MSCEIT), (2) stream 2: self-reports of abilities measures (e.g. SREIT, SUEIT and WLEIS) and (3) stream 3: mixed-models (e.g. AES, ECI, EI questionnaire, EIS, EQ-I and GENOS), which include measures of EI and traditional social skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ashkanasy|first=Neal M.|last2=Daus|first2=Catherine S.|date=2005-06-01|title=Rumors of the death of emotional intelligence in organizational behavior are vastly exaggerated|journal=Journal of Organizational Behavior|volume=26|issue=4|pages=441–452|doi=10.1002/job.320|issn=1099-1379|deadurl=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; O’Boyle Jr. and his colleagues (2011)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=O'Boyle|first=Ernest H.|last2=Humphrey|first2=Ronald H.|last3=Pollack|first3=Jeffrey M.|last4=Hawver|first4=Thomas H.|last5=Story|first5=Paul A.|date=2011-07-01|title=The relation between emotional intelligence and job performance: A meta-analysis|journal=Journal of Organizational Behavior|volume=32|issue=5|pages=788–818|doi=10.1002/job.714|issn=1099-1379|deadurl=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that the three EI streams together had a positive correlation of 0.28 with job performance. Similarly, each of EI streams independently obtained a positive correlation of 0.24, 0.30 and 0.28, respectively. Stream 2 and 3 showed an incremental validity for predicting job performance over and above personality ([[Big Five personality traits|Five Factor model]]) and [[G factor (psychometrics)|general cognitive ability]]. Both, stream 2 and 3 were the second most important predictor of job performance below [[G factor (psychometrics)|general cognitive ability.]] Stream 2 explained 13.6% of the total variance; whereas stream 3, explained 13.2%. In order to examine the reliability of these findings, a publication bias analysis was developed. Results indicated that studies on EI-job performance correlation prior to 2010 do not present substantial evidences to suggest the presence of [[publication bias]].

Despite the validity of previous findings, some researchers still question whether EI – job performance correlation makes a real impact on business strategies. They argue that popularity of emotional intelligence’s studies is due to media advertising, rather than objective scientific findings.&lt;ref name="Côté 2006"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Côté|first=Stéphane|last2=Miners|first2=Christopher T. H.|date=2006-01-01|title=Emotional Intelligence, Cognitive Intelligence, and Job Performance|jstor=20109857|journal=Administrative Science Quarterly|volume=51|issue=1|pages=1–28|doi=10.2189/asqu.51.1.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, it is mentioned that relationship between job performance and EI is not as strong as suggested. This relationship requires the presence of other constructs to rise important outcomes. For instance, previous studies found that EI is positively associated with teamwork effectiveness under job contexts of high managerial work demands, which improves job performance. This is due to activation of strong emotions during performance on this job context. In this scenario, emotional intelligent individuals show a better set of resources to succeed on their roles. However, individuals with high EI show a similar level of performance than non-emotional intelligent employees under different job contexts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Farh|first=Crystal I. C. Chien|last2=Seo|first2=Myeong-Gu|last3=Tesluk|first3=Paul E.|title=Emotional intelligence, teamwork effectiveness, and job performance: The moderating role of job context|journal=Journal of Applied Psychology|volume=97|issue=4|pages=890–900|doi=10.1037/a0027377|pmid=22390388|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Joseph and Newman (2010)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Joseph|first=Dana L.|last2=Newman|first2=Daniel A.|title=Emotional intelligence: An integrative meta-analysis and cascading model|journal=Journal of Applied Psychology|volume=95|issue=1|pages=54–78|doi=10.1037/a0017286|pmid=20085406|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggested that emotional perception and emotional regulation components of EI highly contribute to job performance under job contexts of high emotional demands. Moon and Hur (2011)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moon|first=Tae Won|last2=Hur|first2=Won-Moo|date=2011-09-01|title=Emotional Intelligence, Emotional Exhaustion, And Job Performance|url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/sbp/sbp/2011/00000039/00000008/art00008?token=004e15b5ca926383a4b3b2570507b457a2438383b40664c2a726e2d58464340592f3f3b575b18b|journal=Social Behavior and Personality: An International Journal|volume=39|issue=8|pages=1087–1096|doi=10.2224/sbp.2011.39.8.1087|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160624215721/http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/sbp/sbp/2011/00000039/00000008/art00008?token=004e15b5ca926383a4b3b2570507b457a2438383b40664c2a726e2d58464340592f3f3b575b18b|archivedate=2016-06-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that [[emotional exhaustion]] (“burn-out”) significantly influences the job performance – EI relationship. [[Emotional exhaustion]] showed a negative association with two components of EI (optimism and social skills). This association impacted negatively to job performance, as well. Hence, job performance – EI relationship is stronger under contexts of high emotional exhaustion or burn-out; in other words, employees with high levels of optimism and social skills possess better resources to outperform when facing high [[emotional exhaustion]] contexts.

=== Health ===
A 2007 meta-analysis of 44 effect sizes by Schutte found that emotional intelligence was associated with better mental and physical health. Particularly, trait EI had the stronger association with mental and physical health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/216626194|title=A meta-analytic investigation of the relationship between emotional intelligence and health|author=Schutte|date=1 April 2007|website=ResearchGate|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208060534/http://www.researchgate.net/publication/216626194_A_meta-analytic_investigation_of_the_relationship_between_emotional_intelligence_and_health|archivedate=8 December 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was replicated again in 2010 by researcher Alexandra Martin  who found trait EI as a strong predictor for health after conducting a meta-analysis based on 105 effect sizes and 19,815 participants. This meta-analysis also indicated that this line of research reached enough sufficiency and stability in concluding EI as a positive predictor for health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222693042|title=A comprehensive meta-analysis of the relationship between Emotional Intelligence and health|author=Alexandra Martins|date=1 October 2010|website=ResearchGate|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208045106/http://www.researchgate.net/publication/222693042_A_comprehensive_meta-analysis_of_the_relationship_between_Emotional_Intelligence_and_health|archivedate=8 December 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Self-esteem and drug dependence ===
A 2012 study cross examined emotional intelligence, [[self-esteem]] and [[marijuana]] dependence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nehra|first=D. K.|author2=Sharma, Mushtaq, Sharma, Sharma, Nehra|title=Emotional intelligence and self esteem in cannabis abusers|journal=[[Journal of the Indian Academy of Applied Psychology]] |date=July 2012|volume=38|issue=2|pages=385–393}}&lt;/ref&gt; Out of a sample of 200, 100 of whom were dependent on cannabis and the other 100 emotionally healthy, the dependent group scored exceptionally low on EI when compared to the control group. They also found that the dependent group also scored low on self-esteem when compared to the control.

Another study in 2010 examined whether or not low levels of EI had a relationship with the degree of [[Substance dependence|drug]] and [[alcoholism|alcohol]] addiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brown|first=Chiu|author2=Chiu, Edmond|author3=Neill, Lloyd|author4=Tobin, Juliet|author5=Reid, John|title=Is low emotional intelligence a primary causal factor in drug and alcohol addiction?|journal=Australian Academic Press (Bowen Hills, QLD, Australia)|date=16 Jan 2012|pages=91–101|url=http://0-search.proquest.com.helin.uri.edu/docview/916528622?accountid=28991}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the assessment of 103 residents in a drug rehabilitation center, they examined their EI along with other psychosocial factors in a one-month interval of treatment. They found that participants' EI scores improved as their levels of addiction lessened as part of their treatment.

== Utilization ==
It has been noted that having EI as a skill can increase one's own [https://eclass.teicrete.gr/modules/document/file.php/IP-ERLSF116/Mayer-Salovey.1993-libre.pdf well being]. In other words, individuals who are conscious of the emotions of themselves and others have the privilege of enhancing relationships. It also allows people to see the multiple perspectives of a given situation, and acknowledge others' feelings about the event.

The '''Falcon School Cyprus''' is an [[international school]] in [[Nicosia]] which follows an English-style curriculum, adapted to the Cyprus environment. Founded in 1976 and accredited by the Cyprus Ministry of Education, the School provides a continuous education for boys and girls from the age of 3 years and 8 months until graduation at the age of 18. A full 15 years can be spent at the School, and "Falcon 15ers" receive an award at the end of their schooling.

The School profile on its website describes its aims as promoting traditional values, while looking to the future.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.falconschool.ac.cy&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, an ambitious renovation project has been taking place, rewiring and networking the buildings, and upgrading facilities, such as the swimming pool, which is now run on solar energy. In addition to a complete refit of the pool, the gymnasium has been re-roofed and re-floored, and a new climate-control system has been installed.

Examination successes are announced on the School's website, with pass rates comparing very favourably to other similar schools in Cyprus and in the UK. Students tend to choose UK universities as their ultimate destination, with Russell Group Universities a high priority. Students are mainly prepared for UK qualifications at IGCSE/GCSE, and Advanced level for entry to UK and other universities allied to the British system, although a small minority of students choose universities in the US or countries in the EU. In 2016, the School was proud to announce that one of its students was the only undergraduate from Cyprus to gain a place at Oxford University. Each year, the School sends students to Higher Education institutions such as Cambridge, Harvard, Imperial College London, LSE, Manchester, Edinburgh, King's London, UCL, Bath, Bristol, Nottingham, Caltech, MIT, among others.

The Falcon School is one of the most diverse schools in Cyprus, with students coming from a variety of backgrounds including the UK, France, Russia, Lebanon, Egypt, Libya, Spain, Portugal, Brazil, India, the Philippines, and the US. The school takes pupils from all ages (from [[kindergarten]] to secondary education).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.isbi.com/istd-viewschool/4010-Falcon_School.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, the School was the subject of a documentary-style film produced by MediaBox Productions http://mediabox.com.cy/our-work/the-falcon-school-nicosia-cyprus/&lt;ref&gt;http://mediabox.com.cy/our-work/the-falcon-school-nicosia-cyprus/&lt;/ref&gt;

{{wikt|fellow}}
A '''fellow''' is a member of a group (or fellowship) that work together in pursuing mutual knowledge or practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/69094|website=oed.com|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|title=Oxford English Dictionary: Fellow}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are many different kinds of fellowships which are awarded for different reasons in academia and industry, often indicating an advanced level of [[scholarship]].

==Education and academia==
In education and academia there are several kinds of fellowships, awarded for different reasons:
===Research fellowships===
{{Main article|Research fellow}}
The title of research fellow is used to denote an academic research position at a university or a similar institution and is roughly equivalent to the title of lecturer in the teaching career pathway.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} Research fellow is also used to refer to the holder of a research fellowship. These are often shortened to the name of the programme or organization, e.g. [[Dorothy Hodgkin]] Fellow rather than Dorothy Hodgkin Research Fellow, except where this might cause confusion with another fellowship, e.g. [[Royal Society University Research Fellowship]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://royalsociety.org/fellows/research-fellows-directory/|title=Research Fellows Directory|publisher=[[Royal Society]]|location=London|accessdate=19 June 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160503045104/https://royalsociety.org/fellows/research-fellows-directory/|archivedate=3 May 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imperial.ac.uk/engineering/departments/chemical-engineering/people/fellows/|title=Research Fellows|publisher=[[Imperial College London]]|accessdate=19 June 2016}} Contains examples (as of 19 June 2016) of staff titled "Research Fellow", "Junior Research Fellow", "Royal Society – EPSRC Dorothy Hodgkin Research Fellow" and "Royal College of Surgeons Research Fellow".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=urf&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160203164426/https://royalsociety.org/grants-schemes-awards/grants/university-research/|archivedate=2016-02-03|url=https://royalsociety.org/grants-schemes-awards/grants/university-research/|publisher=Royal Society|title=University Research Fellowship: for outstanding scientists in the UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=urfs&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cook|first1=Alan|authorlink1=Alan Cook|title=URFs become FRS: Frances Ashcroft, Athene Donald and John Pethica|journal=Notes and Records of the Royal Society|volume=54|issue=3|year=2000|pages=409–411|doi=10.1098/rsnr.2000.0181}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the context of [[graduate school]] in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]], a fellow is a recipient of a [[postgraduate]] fellowship. Examples include the [[NSF-GRF|NSF Graduate Research Fellowship]], the National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate Fellowship, the [[Guggenheim Fellowship]], the [[Harold Wallace Rosenthal|Rosenthal Fellowship]], [[Woodrow Wilson Teaching Fellowship]] and the [[Presidential Management Fellowship]]. It is granted to prospective or current students, on the basis of their academic or research achievements.

In the UK, research fellowships are awarded to support [[postdoctoral research]]ers such as those funded by the [[Wellcome Trust]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wellcome.ac.uk/funding/sir-henry-wellcome-postdoctoral-fellowships|title=Sir Henry Wellcome Postdoctoral Fellowships|publisher=[[Wellcome Trust]]|website=wellcome.ac.uk|location=London|author=Anon|year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council|Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council]]|location=Swindon|author=Anon|year=2016|url=http://www.bbsrc.ac.uk/funding/filter/david-phillips/|website=bbsrc.ac.uk|title=David Phillips Fellowships}}&lt;/ref&gt; At [[ETH Zurich]], postdoctoral fellowships support incoming researchers.&lt;ref name=eth&gt;{{cite web|title=ETH Zurich Postdoctoral Fellowships (ETH Fellows)|url=https://www.ethz.ch/en/research/research-promotion/eth-internal-programmes/eth-fellowships.html|website=ethz.ch|author=Anon|year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[MacArthur Fellows Program]] (aka "genius grant") as prestigious research fellowship awarded in the United States.

===Teaching fellowships===
{{main|Teaching fellow}}
The title of (senior) teaching fellow is used to denote an academic teaching position at a university or similar institution and is roughly equivalent to the title of (senior) lecturer. The title ''(senior) fellow'' can also be bestowed to an academic member of staff upon retirement who continues to be affiliated to a university in the United Kingdom.

The term teaching fellow or [[teaching assistant]] is used, in the United States and United Kingdom, in secondary school, high school and middle school setting for students or adults that assist a teacher with one or more classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teachingfellows.org|website=teachingfellows.org |title=North Carolina Teaching Fellows Program |publisher=Teaching Fellows |date= |accessdate=2013-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fellowships as a prize or honor===
{{main article|Research fellow|:Category:Academic awards|Honorary title (academic)}}
Fellowships can be awarded as a prize in their own right, e.g. the [[Fellow of the Royal Society|Fellowship of the Royal Society (FRS)]] and Fellows are often the highest grade of membership of many [[professional association]]s or [[learned society|learned societies]], for example, the [[Chartered Institute of Arbitrators]] or [[Royal College of Surgeons]]. Lower grades are referred to as members (who typically share voting rights with the fellows), or associates (who may or may not, depending on whether "associate" status is a form of full membership). How a fellowship is awarded varies for each society, but may typically involve some or all of these:
* A qualifying period in a lower grade
* Passing a series of examinations
* Nomination by two existing fellows who know the applicant professionally
* Evidence of continued formal training post-qualification
* Evidence of substantial achievement in the subject area
* Submission of a thesis or portfolio of works which will be examined
* Election by a vote of the fellowship

Exclusive [[learned society|learned societies]] such as the [[Royal Society]] have Fellow as the only grade of membership, others like the Faculty of Young Musicians (now defunct) have members holding the post of Associate and posts ''[[Honorary degree|Honoris Causa]]''.  The Management and Strategy Institute has two membership grades titled Fellow and Senior Fellow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msicertified.com/msi-fellowship.html|title=Management and Strategy Institute Fellowship Program}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of Fellowship in the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia and Canada include:

{{div col end}}

Appointment as an honorary fellow in a learned or professional society can be either to honour exceptional achievement and/or service within the professional domain of the awarding body or to honour contributions related to the domain from someone who is professionally outside it. Membership of the awarding body may or may not be a requirement.

===Ancient university fellowships===
{{See also|President and Fellows of Harvard College}}
{{anchor|university_fellows_dons}}
At the [[ancient universities]] of the [[University of Oxford]], the [[University of Cambridge]], and [[Trinity College, Dublin]], members of the teaching staff typically have two affiliations: one as a reader, lecturer, or other [[academic rank]] within a department of the university, as at other universities, and a second affiliation as a fellow
of one of the [[residential college|colleges]] of the university.
The fellows, sometimes referred to as [[University don]]s, form the [[governance|governing body]] of the college.  They may elect a council to handle day-to-day management. All fellows are entitled to certain privileges within their colleges, which may include dining at [[High Table]] (free of charge) and possibly the right to a room in college (free of charge).

At Cambridge, retired academics may remain fellows.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} At Oxford, however, a Governing Body fellow would normally be elected a ''fellow emeritus'' and would leave the Governing Body upon his or her retirement.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} Distinguished old members of the college, or its benefactors and friends, might also be elected 'Honorary Fellow', normally for life; but beyond limited [[dining rights]] this is merely an honour. Most Oxford colleges have 'Fellows by Special Election' or 'Supernumerary Fellows', who may be members of the teaching staff, but not necessarily members of the Governing Body.

Some senior administrators of a college such as [[bursar]]s are made fellows, and thereby become members of the governing body, because of their importance to the running of a college.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

At [[Harvard University]] and some other universities in the United States, "fellows" are members of the [[Board of Governors|Board of Trustees]] who hold administrative positions as non-executive [[trustee]] rather than academics.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

===Medical fellowships===
{{main|Fellowship (medicine)}}
In US medical institutions, a fellow refers to someone who has completed residency training (e.g. in internal medicine, pediatrics, general surgery, etc.) and is currently in a 1 to 3 year subspecialty training program (e.g. cardiology, pediatric nephrology, transplant surgery, etc.).

==Industry and corporate fellows==

{{See also|IBM Fellow|ICL Fellows}}
Corporations in [[research and development]] - intensive industries (e.g., [[IBM]], [[Intel]], [[Microsoft]], [[Google]] or [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] in [[information technology]], [[Bell Labs]], [[Northrop Grumman]] or [[L3 Technologies]] in [[telecommunications]], [[United Technologies]] in aerospace, and [[Boston Scientific]] in medical devices, for example) and large scientific organizations (e.g., [[NASA]], [[ORNL]]) appoint a very small number of top senior researchers as corporate or technical Fellows, either in [[Science]] or in [[Engineering]]. These are internationally recognized [[R&amp;D]] leaders who are among the smartest individuals in the world in their respective fields.

Fellow is the most senior rank or title one can achieve in a scientific or engineering [[career]], though some fellows also hold business titles such as [[Vice President]] or [[Chief Technology Officer]].

Examples of Science and Engineering Fellows in research and development - intensive organizations include:

'''The GRE Literature in English Test''' is a [[standardized test]] administered by the [[Educational Testing Service]]. It is intended to evaluate applicants seeking admission to a [[graduate program]] in [[English Studies]]. The test surveys a wide range of topics related to literature in English, but the focus is on works long 
accepted as part of the [[Western canon|canon]].

Scores are scaled and then reported as a number between 200 and 800; however, in recent versions of the test, the maximum and minimum reported scores have been 760 (corresponding to the 99 percentile) and 320 (1 percentile) respectively. The mean score for all test takers from July, 2009, to July, 2012, was 549 with a standard deviation of 99.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ets.org/s/gre/pdf/gre_guide_table2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content specification==

The test contains 230 questions, grouped in four broad categories. Since many students who apply to graduate programs in English do so during the first half of their fourth year, the scope of most questions is largely that of the first three years of a standard American undergraduate English curriculum. A sampling of test item content is given below:

===Literary analysis (40-55%)===

* Conventions and genres
* Allusions and references
* Meaning and tone
* Grammar and [[rhetoric]]
* Literary techniques

===Identification (15-20%)===

This section tests the ability of examinees to perform recognition of date, author or work by style and/or content. The literary-historical scope of the test is as follows:

* Continental, classical and comparative literature through 1925 (5-10%)
* British literature through 1660 (including [[John Milton]]) (25-30%)
* British literature from 1660 to 1925 (25-30%)
* American literature through 1925 (15-25%)
* Literature in English after 1925 (20-30%)

===Cultural and historical contexts (20-25%)===

* Literary history
* Cultural history
* Identification of details in a work

===Literary criticism (10-15%)===

Identification and analysis of the characteristics and methods of various critical and theoretical approaches.

[[Monash University]] is an [[Australian]] university located in [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]] with some international campuses. It was established by an Act of the State Parliament of Victoria in 1958 as a result of the Murray Report which was commissioned in 1957 by the then Prime Minister [[Sir Robert Menzies]] to establish the second university in the state of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]].

==Early history==
[[Monash University]] is a commissioned Victorian university. It was established by an Act of the State Parliament of Victoria in 1958 as a result of the Murray Report which was commissioned in 1957 by the then Prime Minister [[Sir Robert Menzies]] to establish the second university in the state of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]. The university was named after the prominent Australian general [[John Monash|Sir John Monash]]. This was the first time in Australia that a university had been named after a person, rather than a city or state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.griffith.edu.au/vc/ate/pdf/univfacts.pdf| title=List of Australian Universities with date of foundation| publisher=Griffith University| format=pdf| accessdate=7 April 2010| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091007091334/http://www.griffith.edu.au/vc/ate/pdf/univfacts.pdf| archivedate=7 October 2009| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:John Monash 1.jpg|right|thumb|upright|The University's eponym, Sir [[John Monash]]]]

The original campus was in the south-eastern Melbourne suburb of [[Clayton, Victoria|Clayton]] (falling in what is now the [[City of Monash]]). The first University Council, led by Monash's first Chancellor Sir Robert Blackwood, selected a British professor of engineering, Sir [[Louis Matheson]], to be the first Vice-Chancellor of Monash University, a position he held until 1976. The University was granted an expansive site of 115 hectares of land at Clayton, after it had argued that, in the distant future, it was possible that Monash would have up to 12,000 students.&lt;ref name="Marginson1"/&gt;

From its first intake of 347 students at Clayton on 13 March 1961, the university grew rapidly in size and student numbers so that by 1967, it had enrolled more than 21,000 students since its establishment. It was originally intended to have an emphasis on science and technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Monash: Remaking the University| first=Simon| last=Marginson| year=2000| publisher=Allen &amp; Unwin| location=St Leonards, NSW, Australia| isbn=1-86508-268-6 | pages=6–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it quickly expanded beyond this. In its early years, it offered undergraduate and postgraduate degrees in engineering, medicine, science, arts, economics and politics, education and law. Initially, it was best known for its strong research capacity in the sciences and for its innovative teaching in law and medicine.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} Along with the [[University of New South Wales]] and the [[Australian National University]], it also attracted interest for its focus on Asia. Along with UNSW, it was the major provider for international student places under the [[Colombo Plan]], which saw the first Asian students enter the Australian education system.

In its early years of teaching, research and administration, Monash had the advantage of no entrenched traditional practices. This enabled it to adopt modern approaches without resistance from those who preferred the status quo. Matheson had also deliberately selected young, talented staff to fuel the rapid rise of the University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atse.org.au/index.php?sectionid=1060 |title=ATSE - MATHESON James Adam Louis |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720104229/http://www.atse.org.au/index.php?sectionid=1060 |archivedate=20 July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A modern administrative structure was set up, Australia's first research centres and scholarships devoted to [[Indigenous Australians]] were established, and, thanks to Monash's entirely new facilities, students in wheelchairs were able to enroll. By contrast, Melbourne University struggled to enter the modern educational era, to the point that there was talk of a [[Royal Commission]] to overcome its antiquated style.&lt;ref name="Marginson1"&gt;{{cite book| title=Monash: Remaking the University| first=Simon| last=Marginson| year=2000| publisher=Allen &amp; Unwin| location=St Leonards, NSW, Australia| isbn=1-86508-268-6 | page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other respects, however, the youth of Monash was a burden. While [[Louis Matheson]] had good relations with government, Monash in the 1960s existed in a city where almost all professionals had attended Melbourne University. {{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} This meant that many officials and heads of professional bodies were "unsympathetic" to Monash's requests.&lt;ref name="Marginson1"/&gt; For example, it was many years before the Faculty of Medicine received funding for Monash Medical Centres to complement its teaching and research.

==1970s onwards==
From the mid-1960s to the early 1970s, Monash became the centre of [[student activism|student radicalism]] in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.lib.monash.edu.au/exhibitions/communism/xcommunismcat.html| title="Communism" - An exhibition of highlights from the Monash University Library Rare Books Collection| publisher=Monash University Library| date=21 October 2010| accessdate=7 April 2010| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091006113301/http://www.lib.monash.edu.au/exhibitions/communism/xcommunismcat.html| archivedate=6 October 2009| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.usyd.edu.au/about/publication/gazette/april03/features/pub/rebels.shtml| title=Where have all the rebels gone?| publisher=The University of Sydney| date= 20 June 2007| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071210221622/http://www.usyd.edu.au/about/publication/gazette/april03/features/pub/rebels.shtml| archivedate=10 December 2007| accessdate=7 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the site of many mass student demonstrations, particularly concerning Australia's role in [[Vietnam War]] and [[conscription]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://menzieslecture.org/trust.html| title=About the Trust| first=Alan| last=Gregory| publisher=Sir Robert Menzies Lecture Trust| accessdate=7 April 2010| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090911074335/http://menzieslecture.org/trust.html| archivedate=11 September 2009| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The origins of mass student demonstrations in Melbourne were those against [[capital punishment]], and some of the largest protests occurred at Monash in the final years before it was abolished in Victoria. By the late 1960s, several student organisations, some of which were influenced by or supporters of communism, turned their focus to Vietnam, with numerous blockades and sit-ins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.monash.edu.au/pubs/monmag/issue16-2005/around-monash/around-activism.html| title=Those were the days| first=Robyn| last=Anns| work=Monash Magazine| publisher=Monash University| date=20 October 2005| accessdate=7 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1971, for example, over 4500 students—a substantial proportion of the Monash student population at the time—carried out a blockade on University Council chambers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ecu.edu.au/RMAA/bc/business_continuity.html| title=Business Continuity Management| publisher=Edith Cowan University| date=10 March 2009| accessdate=7 April 2010| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090221234117/http://www.ecu.edu.au/RMAA/bc/business_continuity.html| archivedate=21 February 2009| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The student meetings held at Monash during this time remain the largest in Australia's history. In May 1969, one meeting saw over 6,000 gather to vote against a disciplinary statute passed by the University Council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.anu.edu.au/polsci/marx/interventions/students.htm| title=Marxist Interventions| first=Mick| last=Armstrong| publisher=Australian National University| accessdate=7 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most famous student radical was [[Albert Langer]], who regularly made newspaper headlines and caused major disruptions at the Clayton Campus. So great was publicity surrounding the protests that many in Australia and around the world first heard of Monash not because of its teaching and research, but because of its protests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eduweb.vic.gov.au/edulibrary/public/highered/Monash_Com_engagement_July05jw.pdf |title=Monash case study final |format=pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080414103527/http://www.eduweb.vic.gov.au/edulibrary/public/highered/Monash_Com_engagement_July05jw.pdf |archivedate=14 April 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In one extraordinary event that came to be known as the Monash Siege, students forced then Prime Minister [[Malcolm Fraser]] to hide in a basement at the Alexander Theatre, in a major protest over the [[Whitlam dismissal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/education/once-were-campus-warriors-20120903-25a4f.html | location=Melbourne | work=The Age | title=Once were campus warriors}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, student radicalism has died down, although there have been occasional protests on government higher education policy.

In the late 1970s and 1980s, Monash's most publicised research came through its pioneering of [[in-vitro fertilisation]] (IVF). Led by Professors [[Carl Wood]] and [[Alex Lopata]], the Monash IVF Program achieved the world's first early IVF pregnancy in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.monash.edu.au/timeline/1973-IVF.html| title=1973 - World's first IVF pregnancy| publisher=Monash University| date=3 July 2009| accessdate=7 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1980,  the first IVF baby in Australia was born at the Royal Women's Hospital in Melbourne as a result of the work of Alex Lopata and Ian Johnston.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.monashivf.com/default.asp?action=article&amp;ID=21660| title=History of IVF - Our Contribution| publisher=Monash IVF Australia| accessdate=7 April 2010| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090915053811/http://www.monashivf.com/default.asp?action=article&amp;ID=21660| archivedate=15 September 2009| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This eventually became a massive source of revenue for the University at a time when university funding in Australia was beginning to slow down. In addition to the Medicine Faculty's work in IVF, Monash academics shaped the practice in other ways. Professor [[Louis Waller]] of the Law School created the model IVF legislation adopted in Victoria, and philosophers [[Peter Singer]] and [[Helga Kuhse]] led the world in their consideration of the ethical implications of IVF, establishing the [[Centre for Human Bioethics]] in 1980.

==Expansion in the 1990s==
In the late 1980s, the [[Dawkins Reforms]] changed the landscape of higher education in Australia. All Australian universities either sought to expand and consolidate their teaching and research bases, or merged with larger institutions. Under the leadership of Vice-Chancellor [[Mal Logan]], Monash transformed dramatically. In 1988, Monash University had only one campus, [[Monash University, Clayton campus|Clayton]], with around 15,000 students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Monash: Remaking the University| first=Simon| last=Marginson| year=2000| publisher=Allen &amp; Unwin| location=St Leonards, NSW, Australia| isbn=1-86508-268-6 | page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt; Just over a decade later, it had 8 campuses (including 2 overseas), a European research and teaching centre, and more than 50,000 students, making it the largest and most internationalised Australian university.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.monash.edu.au/about/overview/brief-history.html| title=Brief history of Monash| publisher=Monash University| date= 10 November 2009| accessdate=1 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The expansion began in 1990, with a series of mergers between Monash, the Chisholm Institute of Technology, the Gippsland Institute of Advanced Education. In 1991, Monash, to the surprise of many, merged with the [[Victorian College of Pharmacy]], which most people had predicted would merge with the [[University of Melbourne]]. Monash University's expansion continued in 1994, with the establishment of the [[Monash University, Berwick campus|Berwick Campus]]. So great was the University's expansion that it was reported at the time that Monash might attempt a takeover of La Trobe University, but this did not happen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Monash: Remaking the University| first=Simon| last=Marginson| year=2000| publisher=Allen &amp; Unwin| location=St Leonards, NSW, Australia| isbn=1-86508-268-6 | page=98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, the University opened the [[Monash University Malaysia campus|Malaysia Campus]], its first overseas campus and the first foreign university in [[Malaysia]], after a longstanding presence in [[South East Asia]]. In 2001, the Johannesburg Campus opened its doors, making Monash the first foreign university in [[South Africa]]. The same year, the University secured an 18th-century Tuscan Palace to open a research and teaching centre in [[Prato]], [[Italy]]. This expansion made Monash one of the world's most internationalised universities, but in fact the University administrators in the late 1990s contemplated going even further than they did. They explored the possibility of, and devoted much energy to, opening campuses in [[Thailand]], [[Laos]] and [[Indonesia]], but these plans were not followed through. While the University has established the [[IITB-Monash Research Academy]] with the [[Indian Institute of Technology Bombay]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.iitbmonash.org/about.html| title=IITB-Monash Research Academy| accessdate=7 April 2010| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100310194353/http://www.iitbmonash.org/about.html| archivedate=10 March 2010| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has made its international focus explicit, it has stated that no further large-scale international campuses are planned within the next few years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,,25747766-12332,00.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090717005323/http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0%2C%2C25747766-12332%2C00.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=17 July 2009 |title=New chief wants Monash on regional map |publisher=The Australian |date=7 July 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Monash has also established study and research exchange links with over 120 partner universities around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.monash.edu.au/news/newsline/story/949| title=Open to opportunity at Open Day| publisher=Monash University| date=26 July 2006| accessdate=7 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, Australian universities faced unprecedented demand for international student places, which Monash met on a larger scale than most, to the point that today around 30% of its students are from outside Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.monash.edu.au/about/stats.html| title=Monash Statistics| publisher=Monash University| date=10 November 2009| accessdate=7 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, Monash students come from over 100 different countries, and speak over 90 different languages. The increase in international students, combined with its expansion, meant that Monash's income skyrocketed throughout the 1990s, and it is now one of Australia's top 200 exporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.emelbourne.net.au/biogs/EM00993b.htm| title=Monash University| first=Simon| last=Marginson| work=The Encyclopedia of Melbourne Online| publisher=School of Historical Studies| date=25 February 2010| accessdate=1 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2000 onwards==
In recent years, the University has been particularly prominent in medical research. A highlight of this came in 2000, when Professor [[Alan Trounson]] led the team of scientists which first announced to the world that nerve stem cells could be derived from embryonic stem cells, a discovery which led to a dramatic increase in interest in the potential of [[stem cells]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stemcellcentre.edu.au/public-education_research.aspx |title=Australian Stem Cell Centre |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071007230027/http://www.stemcellcentre.edu.au/public-education_research.aspx |archivedate=7 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.vic.gov.au/domino/Web_Notes/newmedia.nsf/798c8b072d117a01ca256c8c0019bb01/773344f4c4f794baca25714e0005c518!OpenDocument |title=VICTORIA TO HOST KEY SEMINARS AT BIO2006 |date=10 April 2006 |accessdate=1 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090623161914/http://www.legislation.vic.gov.au/domino/Web_Notes/newmedia.nsf/798c8b072d117a01ca256c8c0019bb01/773344f4c4f794baca25714e0005c518%21OpenDocument |archivedate=23 June 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; To capitalise on its medical research capacity, the University has been awarded hundreds of millions of dollars in funding to develop large research facilities at its Clayton Campus. In 2006, the University began developing the $138 million [[Australian Regenerative Medicine Institute]], which will be one of the largest stem cell research centres in the world when it opens in 2008. In addition to this, the University now houses the [[Australian Stem Cell Centre]], Nanotechnology Victoria Limited (NanoVic), Stem Cell Sciences Limited and the largest monoclonal antibody production facility in the Southern Hemisphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.monash.edu.au/strip/tenants/index.html| title=Cluster of Enterprises| publisher=Monash University| date=26 June 2007| accessdate=7 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.monash.edu.au/news/monashmemo/stories/20070711/antibody.html| title=Monash University home to largest monoclonal antibody production facility in Southern Hemisphere - Monash Memo| publisher=Monash University| date=11 July 2007| accessdate=7 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such developments have made Monash the main location of stem cell research in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/reprint/312/5772/345a.pdf?ck=nck| title=On The Go In California| journal=Science| publisher=American Association for the Advancement of Science| volume=312| issue=5772| page=345| date=21 April 2006| accessdate=7 April 2010| format=pdf| doi=10.1126/science.312.5772.345c}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also led to Monash being ranked in the top 20 universities in the world for biomedicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.monash.edu.au/news/monashmemo/stories/20070509/medicine-institute.html| title=Monash academic to head Victoria's Regenerative Medicine Institute - Monash Memo| publisher=Monash University| date=9 May 2007| accessdate=7 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the [[John Monash Science School]], Victoria's first specialist select-entry high school for students gifted in maths, science and technology, opened at the Clayton Campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/20m-maths-science-school-for-clayton/2007/08/12/1186857347045.html| title=$20m maths, science school for Clayton| first=Bridie| last=Smith| publisher=The Age| date=13 August 2007| accessdate=7 April 2010| location=Melbourne}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Holiday Lake 4-H Educational Center''', also known as Surrender Grounds Forest and Holiday Lake [[4-H]] Camp, is located within the confines of [[Appomattox-Buckingham State Forest]] near [[Appomattox, Virginia|Appomattox]], [[Appomattox County, Virginia]].

==History==
The [[4-H]] camp was originally built by [[Works Progress Administration]] workers (in association with the [[Resettlement Administration]]) in 1937.  The WPA workers housed at the camp built the nearby [[Holliday Lake State Park]], and also worked on a [[New Deal]] reforestation demonstration project begun in 1935 to reclaim depleted farmland in the surrounding area.  At the completion of the federal project, the WPA camp was turned over to the state of Virginia over a number of years for use as a state forest and park.&lt;ref name=VAnom&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dhr.virginia.gov/registers/Counties/Appomattox/006-5009_Holiday_Lake_4-H_Educational_Center_FINAL.pdf|title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory/Nomination: Holiday Lake 4-H Educational Center|author=Marc C. Wagner and Dr. Robert R. Meadows|date=May 2010}} and [http://www.dhr.virginia.gov/registers/Counties/Appomattox/006-5009.Holiday4Hcenter.photos.html ''Accompanying four photos'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==4-H camp==
The WPA camp was not in use by 1941, it was owned by the Federal government but operated by the Virginia State Conservation Commission.  The local [[Lions Club]] asked the  State Conservation Commission to make improvements to the roads and buildings and complete [[Rural Electrification Administration]] hookups in the area. The 4-H Club took over the camp in 1941 and has used and expanded the facility up to the present. The 4-H Club currently leases the camp from the State Department of Forestry.

The historic portion of the camp includes 23 contributing buildings, 2 contributing sites, and 1 contributing structure.  They include a dining center, 15 cabins and associated cabin site, a girl's bunk house and boy's bunk house, and a covered open-air amphitheater.  Much of the historic area of the camp is contained within two natural ridges surrounding a man-made terraced field.&lt;ref name=VAnom /&gt;

==Significance==

The Camp is one of the few surviving examples of a WPA camp in Virginia, mainly due to its continuous operation as a 4-H camp since 1941.  Survival of camp residential areas is unusual as they were intended as temporary facilities, most were disassembled by the 1950s.  While an individual building was sometimes maintained, only one other complex of buildings as been noted in Virginia, a former CCC camp now called Natural Bridge Juvenile Correction Center in Rockbridge County. The Holiday Lake WPA camp differs from the CCC camp in that CCC camps were generally organized in military style and favored larger barracks-style accommodations. The WPA camp features several eight-person cabins and only one larger barracks.&lt;ref name=VAnom /&gt;

The Camp was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 2011.&lt;ref name="nps"/&gt;

==Spelling==
The state park uses the double L spelling "Holliday", after the family that owned land in the area.  One of the three creeks that fills adjacent man-made lake in the area is also spelled "Holliday Creek" for the same reason.  Some sources call the lake "Holliday Lake",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.dcr.virginia.gov/state-parks/documents/data/trail-guide-hollidaylake.pdf| title = Holliday Lake State Park Trail Map| accessdate = 2014-12-19|  format = PDF| publisher=Virginia Department of Conservation and Recreation}}&lt;/ref&gt; while some online maps refer to it as "Holiday Lake".

The name of the 4-H camp is spelled with one L, Holiday Lake 4-H Camp, as is the name of the NRHP listing, Holiday Lake 4-H Educational Center.&lt;ref name="nps" /&gt;

The '''Institute of Political History''' ({{lang-hu|Politikatörténeti Intézet}}, PTI) is a company located in [[Budapest]], [[Hungary]], outside the Hungarian governmental institute-system and a public utility private research place. It is aiming and organizing the multifold scientific research of the recent past and the present age. Besides history it is widening its focus on other social sciences as well. It helps the birth of new scientific results with tenders, scholarships, support of individual and team researches. It enables the public usage of the documents of national value kept in the Archives and Library of the Institute. Besides the historical and societal research works, it hosts scientific conferences and cultural events as well. It is a kind of intellectual center that is concentrating first of all on renewing and popularizing social criticism in the widest range of the term.  For the publication of the results of the researches the Foundation operates a detached publishing house, ''Napvilág Kiadó'', and publishes the historical quarterly ''Múltunk'' (Our Past).

==The Archives of Political History and of Trade Unions==

The precursor of the Archives was established in 1948. It served as a department of the Institute of Labour Movement of the Hungarian Workers' Party until 1955, of the Institute of Party History of the [[Hungarian Socialist Workers’ Party]] from 1957, of the Institute of Political History of the [[Hungarian Socialist Party]] between 1989 and 1998, and as a part of the non-profit organization of the Institute of Political History from 1998. Its maintainer is the Foundation of Political History. Before the year 1989, the Archives had been collecting primarily the documents of the pre-1945 legal and illegal movements of the Hungarian labour movement, of the parties of the popular democratic period following the [[First World War]], of the left-wing youth organizations, and of the people connected to these movements and organizations. Now it is storing the documents of the [[Hungarian Workers' Party]] and the Hungarian Socialist Workers’ Party as well until 1992. Since 1998 it has been storing the documents of the Hungarian trade-unionist movement that were produced during the period of 1945 to 1989 and which had previously been stored in the [[Central Archives of Trade Unions]]. Nowadays the Archives are focusing not merely on the political Left, but also on the entire Hungarian history of the [[modern age]]. It is endeavoring to trace, collect and preserve the private documentations that are enduring sources of contemporary history, with a special emphasis on the history of the [[change of regime]], 1989.
As open proprietary archive, it is handling the documents in its care in accordance with the Hungarian rules set forth for public archives. According to its own rules, the Archives are open for research, while the staff is ready to provide the necessary information and supplies data as well.
In the care of the Archives there are 4298 running-metres of documents, and also 1215 cassettes and tapes, 30 discs and 284 rolls of research films. The majority of the fonds are co-ordinated and included in the inventory.

==Recent attacks against the PTI by the Hungarian government ==

The Hungarian right-wing government of [[FIDESZ]]-[[KDNP]] alliance with the assistance of the extreme right-neofascist opposition party [[Jobbik]] is attempting to confiscate both the majority of the materials of the Archives and the headquarters building &lt;ref&gt;[http://hvg.hu/itthon/20120404_kuria_politikaitorteneti_intezet Kell a hely a Kúriának, átköltöztetnék a Politikatörténeti Intézetet] – hvg.hu; 14. 04. 2012 (Hungarian)&lt;/ref&gt; of the Institute of Political History, since it is the last independent historical workshop in Hungary;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.polhist.hu/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=289&amp;Itemid=124 Petition to stop government offensive against the Institute of Political History in Hungary]&lt;/ref&gt; with its two-third majority in Parliament the government even changed the Hungarian [[Constitution]] to make its attacks against the Institute legal.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3505">'''Isabella Thoburn''' (March 29, 1840–Sept. 1, 1901) was an [[United States|American]] [[Christian]] [[missionary]] of the [[Methodist Episcopal Church]] best known for her establishment of educational institutions and [[Mission (Christian)|missionary work]] in [[North India]], subsequent to the [[East India Company]]'s relinquishment of power to the British government in India.

==Biography== 
Isabella Thoburn was born in 1840 near [[St. Clairsville, Ohio]]. She attended local schools and the Wheeling Female Seminary in [[Wheeling Creek (West Virginia)|Wheeling]], Virginia (now in West Virginia).

In 1866, after she had taught for several years, Isabella was invited by her brother [[James Mills Thoburn]], a  Methodist Episcopal missionary in India, to assist him in his educational and missionary work in India. She delayed her departure until 1869, when the formation of the Women’s Foreign Missionary Society of the [[Methodist Episcopal Church]] enabled her to undertake missionary work under denominational affiliation and auspices.

In India, Thoburn's work culminated in the founding of an important woman’s college, [[Isabella Thoburn College]] in [[Lucknow]] (1870), as well as a [[Methodist High School, Kanpur|Methodist High School]] in [[Kanpur]]. These two educational establishments were among the first in [[colonial India]], catering to the educational and religious needs of an emergent [[Anglo Indian]] population in [[Awadh]].

Thoburn returned to the United States for a period to study at [[Lucy Rider Meyer]]'s [[Chicago Training School for Home and Foreign Missions|Chicago Training School for City, Home, and Foreign Missions]] in Illinois. In 1887, Meyer appointed her as the first house mother and superintendent of the school's new Methodist Deaconess Home for training female deacons.&lt;ref name=keller&gt;Keller, Rosemary Skinner, Rosemary Radford Ruether, and Marie Cantlon. ''Encyclopedia of Women and Religion in North America: Women and religion: methods of study and reflection''. Vol. 1. Indiana University Press, 2006, pp. 824-38.&lt;/ref&gt;

She died in 1901 in Lucknow, [[India]].

'''Jake Berthot''' (1939–2014)  was an American artist whose abstract paintings contained elements of both the [[Minimalism|minimalist]] and [[Abstract expressionism|expressionist]] styles. During the first 36 years of his career his paintings were entirely [[Abstract art|non-figurative]]. His style changed in 1995 when he moved his studio from New York City to a rural community in [[upstate New York]].  While continuing to be abstract his paintings thereafter contained figurative elements and were seen to have greater emotional content.&lt;ref name="2015 Jan artcritical"/&gt; Throughout his career his work frequently appeared in solo and group exhibitions in both commercial and public galleries. It has been collected by the [[Museum of Modern Art]], [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|Guggenheim Museum]], [[National Gallery of Art]], and other major American art museums. He received a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]] in 1981 and a [[National Endowment for the Arts]] grant in 1983.&lt;ref name="2015 Jan 9 NYT"/&gt;
 
==Early life and training==

Berthot was born on March 30, 1939 in Niagara Falls, New York, and, from age two, was raised on a truck farm in [[Clearfield, Pennsylvania]], 175 miles to the south. As a child, he received his first drawing lessons from his maternal grandmother who was also his primary caregiver.&lt;ref name="2013 Dec Beer with a Painter"/&gt; Having completed his education at local public schools, he briefly enrolled in a commercial art school in Pittsburgh before moving on to New York where, from 1960 to 1962, he attended evening classes at [[Pratt Institute]]&lt;ref name="2015 Jan NYT"/&gt; and from 1960 to 1961 at the [[new school|New School for Social Research]].&lt;ref name="1985 MoMa"/&gt; Berthot later credited a Pratt instructor, Hank Raleigh, with getting him a start as a professional painter.&lt;ref name="2013 Dec Beer with a Painter"/&gt; The classes he took gave him relatively little grounding in the technique or history of art, but he learned much from hours spent in museums. He also learned much from other artists, particularly [[Milton Resnick]] who, as he later said, took him under his wing and through his friendship and guidance I became more aware of the real possibility of painting."&lt;ref name="2006 Feb Brooklyn Rail"/&gt;

==Career==

===Artistic style===
[[File:Berthot Lovellas Thing.jpg |left|thumb|Jake Berthot, "Lovella's Thing," 1969, acrylic on shaped canvas, 84 x 72 inches]] 
Berthot began his career making [[Abstraction (art)|abstract]] paintings in the [[Minimalism|minimalist]] tradition. He would apply a thick painterly surface to large shaped canvases&lt;ref name="2013 Dec Beer with a Painter"/&gt; that were seen to employ the reductive means of minimalism, but expressing instead of restraining emotion.&lt;ref name="Cerrito 1996"/&gt;  Despite its simplicity of means, his work was said to deal "more in feelings than in analysis."&lt;ref name="1974 Oct NYT"/&gt;  Painted in 1969,  "Lovella's Thing" is a good example of his style at this time.&lt;ref name="Cerrito 1996"/&gt; Shortly before his death, Berthot explained the way in which it evolved: "With Lovella's Thing I originally thought of painting the middle a flat, blank color, but when I got into it, putting down a lot of acrylic washes, I just started to paint it in a more felt way. So it became a kind of dialect between something very concrete and something very felt. I liked the blunt presence the shape had on the wall and then penetrating the surface in the middle in what I suppose could be called a Rothkoesque kind of way."&lt;ref name="2015 Jan Left Bank Art Blog"/&gt;

In the mid-1970s Berthot's style evolved. His work continued to have a painterly, lyrical quality, but he added bright colors to the muted palette of earlier work&lt;ref name="1970 Dec NYT"/&gt; and introduced rectangular bars and ovals into canvases that were now simple rectangles.&lt;ref name="1983 Nov NYT"/&gt; Regarding the bars, he later said that he worked to uncover the tension points, or focal points, that were inherent in the vertical and horizontal axes of a grid. He said he sought "a balance between the object and the opening," and thereby "to gradually achieve balance between my two influences: the systemic and the felt."&lt;ref name="2013 Dec Beer with a Painter"/&gt; "Yellow Bar With Red," of 1977 is typical of paintings in this period.&lt;ref name="1985 MoMa"/&gt;{{rp|page=207}} Another well-known painting from this period, "Walken's Ridge," 1975-1976, is somewhat unusual. Although a pure abstraction, it has the size and shape of Monet's Water Lily paintings&amp;mdash;14 feet wide in two equal sections&amp;mdash; and has, as Berthot said, the feel of a landscape.&lt;ref name="2015 Jan Left Bank Art Blog"/&gt;{{refn|group=note|Regarding the painting's design he said: "I was concerned about getting to the middle of the canvas. That seemed to be the biggest problem in painting at the time, including my painting. I started thinking about it and decided to try putting some kind of form in the middle &amp;mdash; to just do the same things I'd been doing but reverse it. Rather than having the bars on the outside, I would create an internal situation; rather than having the void in the middle, I would move it out to the sides."&lt;ref name="2015 Jan Left Bank Art Blog"/&gt; }} 
[[File:Berthot Walkens Ridge.jpg |right|thumb|Jake Berthot, "Walken's Ridge," 1975-1976, oil on canvas mounted on wood, two panels, 60.125 x 152.7 inches overall]] 
During the 1980s Berthot began to exhibit etchings and drawings along with his paintings.&lt;ref name="1984 BAMPFA"/&gt; The drawings were often graphite on a background of a gray enamel. The lines frequently formed ovoid shapes and were accompanied by quasi-calligraphic markings.&lt;ref name="1984 BAMPFA"/&gt; A critic said this work contained a "poetic lyricism" that could be accessed "not at a cognitive level but at a more elemental, intuitive one."&lt;ref name="1987 Jan Philadelphia Inquirer"/&gt; Berthot later told an interviewer that in it "gradually feeling began to predominate."&lt;ref name="1984 BAMPFA"/&gt; The paintings of this period continued to employ ovals and rectangles in canvases on which the "materiality of pigment," as one critic noted, produced "a highly tactile surface."&lt;ref name="1988 May Boston Globe"/&gt; Another critic wrote that "the shimmering, encrusted surfaces of the 'ovals' are reminiscent of Claude Monet's late Waterlilies. The use of gold with deep reds and bright blues recall Medieval icons."&lt;ref name="1984 BAMPFA"/&gt; Of his work at this time, Berthot said: "I try to break the code of painting and let it take on its own life without any code."&lt;ref name="1988 May Boston Globe"/&gt;
[[File:Berthot Hardline.jpeg |left|thumb|Jake Berthot, "Hard Line," 1980-1983, oil on linen, 60 x 50 inches]]
During the early 1990s, Berthot continued to employ bars and ovals in paintings. Of this period in his career, Berthot later said, "I reached another point where the idea was closing in on itself, there was too much idea; the paintings started to feel too literal, too much like a figure in space. I wanted something more organic, more felt." He said that he wanted to "make the painting something you experience rather than just see."&lt;ref name="2015 Jan Left Bank Art Blog"/&gt; His "Hard Line" of 1980-83 is an early example of this approach, showing a rectangle in a muted background having bright accents that a critic said were and unexpected fiery flame.&lt;ref name="1983 Nov NYT"/&gt; In 1994, Pepe Karmel, writing in the ''New York Times'', said of works like these: "Despite the lack of recognizable imagery, the paintings seem haunted by a nostalgia for representation."&lt;ref name="1994 Dec NYT"/&gt; The oval shape appears as well in Berthot's drawings and etchings of this period some of which had representational content, including most often an ovoid skull.&lt;ref name="1984 BAMPFA"/&gt;

Apart from a brief period spent in Maine, Berthot had lived in New York City from the time he moved there in 1959 until the day in 1994 when he moved his home and studio about 100 miles north of the city to a rural spot in [[Ulster County, New York|Ulster County]] along the [[Hudson Valley]] in the foothills of the [[Catskill Mountains]].&lt;ref name="2006 VQR"/&gt; At this time he made a gradual transition from abstract paintings that had no clear subject to ones that, while continuing to be abstract in character, had the natural environment as their subject.&lt;ref name="1998 Oct Boston Globe"/&gt;{{refn|group=note|In 1998 a critic explained this transition:"Jake Berthot, long a master of abstraction, has moved to the country and started painting forests....  In a sense, Berthot begins, as he always has, with abstraction. He pencils a skeleton of grids and crosshatches over his canvas, a construction of lines that builds into something almost three-dimensional, like a blueprint of the universe.... Berthot's taste for abstraction hasn't left him. His fields of paint shift and move, full of questions and implications. The trees almost fight the colors around them, asserting their noble presences in great fogs of paint. Springing from their gridlike backgrounds, they trumpet their organic shapes, but don't deny their kinship to the abstract."&lt;ref name="1998 Oct Boston Globe"/&gt; }} Of this transition, Berthot said: "Even though my work now is landscape-based, it is more abstract than it was a few years ago. It is dealing with the space in the middle. At first I was painting the volume of the tree in space. Next, what I felt was that space itself has volume. And now, it is the light that has volume."&lt;ref name="2013 Dec Beer with a Painter"/&gt; The painting, "Chapel Trail Near Alter Road" shows the direction that his work took at this time. His drawings similarly enlarged the scope of their subjects as the untitled tree drawing of 2002 shows.{{refn|group=note|In 2006 Berthot, who was right-handed, fell from a ladder while pruning a tree seriously injuring his right wrist. While it was mending he was unable to paint as usual and later said that the loss of dexterity was a useful obstacle for him to try to overcome.&lt;ref name="2014 Jul Shawangunk Journal"/&gt; }}
[[File:Berthot Chapel Trail.jpeg |right|thumb|Jake Berthot, "Chapel Trail Near Alter Road," 2000, oil on panel, 26.675 x 26.125 inches]]
Throughout his career, Berthot consciously kept aloof from the labeled art movements of his time. He once said, "I am not interested in the new but in trying to make paintings that refuse to grow old,"&lt;ref name="1984 BAMPFA"/&gt; and on another occasion, speaking of an affinity he felt with Cézanne's approach to his work, he said: "His clear method ... is not a closure but an opening.... You have to have a form and method and within that form and method, at a certain point you have to become the servant of the painting."&lt;ref name="frauleinspeil video"/&gt; Summing up this attitude on another occasion he said that as he worked a time would come when he felt that a painting would take over his consciousness "to dictate what it wanted to be."&lt;ref name="2015 Jan Left Bank Art Blog"/&gt; His paintings were his companions as well as the focus of his life. When the Phillips Collection asked to mount a major retrospective of combining the many works of his that it owned along with the work then in his studio, he declined saying he could not live without having the paintings around him.&lt;ref name="2015 Jan NYT"/&gt;{{refn|group=note|As noted below, Berthot bequeathed the paintings in his studio to the Phillips Collection, which, after his death, did mount a large retrospective exhibit of the works in its collection with those it had been bequeathed. }}
[[File:Berthot Night Wood.jpg|left|thumb|Jake Berthot, "Night Wood and Rock," 2012-2014, oil on linen, 20.5 x 24.5 inches]]
During the course of his career critics had pointed to an increasing emotional impact in his paintings and one or two of them had said that while the paintings could be comprehended entirely on their own merits, it was possible to see in them Berthot's responses to the personal difficulties he encountered over the years of his career.&lt;ref name="2015 Jan Left Bank Art Blog"/&gt;{{refn|group=note|One critic noted "shifts in feeling" in his work at the time of his separation from his first wife, his move to Maine, and the theft of some of his paintings, saying these events could partially explain the "contentious attitude" of this work.&lt;ref name="2015 Jan Left Bank Art Blog"/&gt; }} While he was undergoing treatment for leukemia during the last few years of his life, Berthot produced paintings that have been seen to possess a high level of emotional content.&lt;ref name="2006 Feb Brooklyn Rail"/&gt; Writing in 2015, a friend of his, the artist Elisa Jensen, referred to them as "haunting, haunted, living, breathing, and absolutely undeniably alive."&lt;ref name="2015 Jan artcritical"/&gt;{{refn|group=note|Berthot seems to have understood this himself. In a 2006 interview he said that his work changed after 1987 so that it subsequently had "more to do with simultaneity of feeling and seeing that leads to thought, rather than thought leading to feeling.".&lt;ref name="2006 Feb Brooklyn Rail"/&gt; }} Concerning one of them, called "Night, Wood, and Rock," a friend said it was "pure essence, stripped of all inessentials," and that his close observation of it infused him with a  "serene acceptance of life's glory, suspended always above death, no matter death's imminence or seeming finality."&lt;ref name="2014 Jul Shawangunk Journal"/&gt;

===Exhibitions and awards===

Berthot's earliest exhibitions were at the Feiner, [[Park Place Gallery|Park Place]], and O.K. Harris galleries&lt;ref name="2013 Dec Beer with a Painter"/&gt;{{refn|group=note|The O.K. Harris Gallery, also known as OK Harris Works of Art, was one of the first galleries located in the area called [[SoHo, Manhattan|SoHo]] south of Houston Street in Manhattan. Operated by [[Ivan Karp]] between 1969 and 2014, it aimed "to exhibit the broadest spectrum of the most adventuresome art being offered."&lt;ref name="2015 OK Harris AAA"/&gt; Run by a sister of Milton Resnick, the Feiner Gallery was located at 42 5th Avenue in New York.&lt;ref name="1963 Oct NYT"/&gt;  }} and the [[Jewish Museum (Manhattan)|Jewish]] and [[Whitney Museum of American Art|Whitney]] museums in New York. He was given solo shows at the Feiner Gallery, 42 Fifth Avenue, in 1963,&lt;ref name="1963 Oct NYT"/&gt; and the O.K. Harris Gallery, 465 West Broadway, in 1970,&lt;ref name="1970 Mar NYT"/&gt; and was included in group exhibitions at the Jewish Museum, in 1970,&lt;ref name="1970 Mar NYT"/&gt; the Whitney Museum, in 1971.&lt;ref name= "1971 May NYT"/&gt;  Before showing at O.K. Harris Berthot had been supporting himself as an art instructor. He later said the gallery's owner, [[Ivan Karp]] had enabled him to work full-time in his studio by giving him a living allowance equal to his teaching salary.&lt;ref name="2015 Feb Eric Holzman"/&gt;

During the 1970s he exhibited frequently in commercial galleries and museums. He was given a solo show at O.K. Harris in 1975, appeared in a charity exhibition at the Cayman Gallery in 1977, was selected to appear in a show called "Artists Choose Artists" at the CDS Gallery (1982),&lt;ref name="1982 May NYT"/&gt; and appeared in a solo exhibition at the McKee Gallery (1983).&lt;ref name="1983 Nov NYT"/&gt; In addition, paintings of his appeared in shows at the Whitney Museum Downtown Branch (1974),&lt;ref name="1974 Oct NYT"/&gt; [[Corcoran Gallery of Art|Corcoran Gallery]]  (1975),&lt;ref name="1975 Feb Washington Post"/&gt; [[Baltimore Museum of Art]] (1975),&lt;ref name="1975 May Washington Post"/&gt; [[Venice Biennale]] (1976),&lt;ref name="1976 May NYT"/&gt; [[Aldrich Contemporary Art Museum|Aldrich Museum]] (1978), [[Fuller Craft Museum|Brockton Art Museum]] (1980),&lt;ref name="1980 May Boston Globe"/&gt; and the [[Hudson River Museum]] (1983).&lt;ref name="1983 Six Painters"/&gt;

The Museum of Modern Art included works by Berthot in "New Works on Paper" (1981),&lt;ref name="1981 Feb NYT"/&gt;  "An International Survey of Recent Painting and Sculpture" (1984),&lt;ref name="John Berthot Obituary Daily Freeman"/&gt; and "Contrasts of Form: Geometric Abstract Art, 1910-1980" (1985).&lt;ref name="1985 MoMa"/&gt; His work was also included in exhibitions at the [[Berkeley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive|Berkeley Art Museum]]  (1984),&lt;ref name="1984 BAMPFA"/&gt; the galleries of [[Muhlenberg College|Muhlenberg]] and [[Lafayette College|Lafayette]] colleges (1984),&lt;ref name="1984 Nov Morning Call"/&gt; Mandeville Gallery, [[University of California, San Diego]] (1986),&lt;ref name="1986 Nov Los Angeles Times"/&gt; the [[Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego]],&lt;ref name="1986 Nov Los Angeles Times"/&gt; and the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]] (1987).&lt;ref name="1987 Jan Boston Globe"/&gt; In 1988 he was given a retrospective exhibition at the [[Rose Art Museum]], Brandeis University.&lt;ref name="1988 May Boston Globe"/&gt;

Until about 2004 he continued to be represented by the McKee Gallery&lt;ref name="2004 Mar NYT"/&gt; and thereafter by the Betty Cunningham Gallery&lt;ref name="2006 Catalog Cunningham"/&gt; which, since his death, has also represented his estate.&lt;ref name="Betty Cunningham pdf"/&gt; Museum exhibitions from the early 1990s include: "Slow Art: Painting in New York Now" at P.S.1, Long Island City, New York (1992), "Square Painting/Plane Painting at the [[Center on Contemporary Art]], Seattle, Washington (1997),&lt;ref name="John Berthot Obituary Daily Freeman"/&gt; "Jake Berthot" at the [[Phillips Collection]] (1998), "Against The Grain" at Museum of Modern Art (2006), an exhibition at [[Hood Museum of Art]], Dartmouth (2009),&lt;ref name="Art2009"/&gt; an exhibition at the gallery of [[SUNY Ulster]] (2010),&lt;ref name="2010 Oct Targeted News Service"/&gt; and "Jake Berthot: From the Collection and Promised Gifts" at the Phillips Collection (2016).&lt;ref name="2016 Phillips Collection"/&gt;

==Art teacher==

While Berthot was in evening school at Pratt, a teacher asked him to take over a class for another teacher who had not shown up. He did well enough so that he was offered a job in the fall of 1961. He later said he liked the work partly because it required him to tell people what to do, "rather than them telling me what to do."&lt;ref name="2013 Dec Beer with a Painter"/&gt; Berthot subsequently taught classes at [[Cooper Union]] (1974–81), [[Yale University]] (1982-92), the [[University of Pennsylvania]] (1993) and the [[School of Visual Arts]] (1994 -2013).&lt;ref name="2015 Jan 9 NYT"/&gt;

==Personal life and family==

Berthot was born on March 30, 1939 in Niagara Falls, New York.&lt;ref name="2015 Jan NYT"/&gt; His father was Earl H. Berthot (1911–1962) and his mother Sara Catherine Barr Berthot (1912–2002). His birth name was John Alex Berthot.&lt;ref name="John Berthot Obituary Daily Freeman"/&gt; When he was two years old his parents separated and his mother took him to her parents' eight-acre truck farm&lt;ref name="2015 Jan NYT"/&gt; in [[Clearfield, Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref name="1983 Six Painters"/&gt;{{refn|group=note|Berthot later said he understood that the separation took place because his father was abusive &lt;ref name="2006 VQR"/&gt; and because he had abandoned his mother and himself.&lt;ref name="2015 Jan NYT"/&gt; }} At this time his grandmother, Cora Barr (1887–1969) became his primary caregiver. His grandfather, Thomas Barr (1886–1967), owned and worked the farm. Including Sara, his grandparents had three of their eleven children living with them when she returned home.&lt;ref name="1930 US Census Barr"/&gt; The youngest of them was thirteen years older than Berthot and in that rural setting he had no companions his own age. The farm was self-sufficient but austere; there was electricity but no indoor plumbing.&lt;ref name="2006 VQR"/&gt; Before her marriage Cora had a relationship with a boyfriend who was an artist.&lt;ref name="2013 Dec Beer with a Painter"/&gt; She encouraged Berthot's early interest in drawing.&lt;ref name="2013 Dec Beer with a Painter"/&gt;

He went through the public school system where he lived and afterwards attended a commercial art school in Pittsburgh.&lt;ref name="2013 Dec Beer with a Painter"/&gt; At the age of 20 in 1959, he moved to New York City,&lt;ref name="1983 Six Painters"/&gt; enrolled in a school to learn window display, and got a job in that occupation in a store in the Bronx.&lt;ref name="2013 Dec Beer with a Painter"/&gt; Shortly afterwards, he married his first wife, the poet, Ginny MacKenzie, whose job, teaching at Pratt Institute, enabled him to take evening art classes there.&lt;ref name="1985 MoMa"/&gt; In the early 1980s he and MacKenzie divorced&lt;ref name="2006 Feb Brooklyn Rail"/&gt;  and he moved briefly to Maine.&lt;ref name="1985 MoMa"/&gt; Sometime later he married Kristin Flynn and some years later they too divorced.&lt;ref name="2015 Jan NYT"/&gt;

In 2006, 11 years after his move to the rural home and studio in Accord, N.Y.,&lt;ref name="2015 Jan artcritical"/&gt; Berthot seriously injured his right wrist when he fell from a ladder while pruning a tree and about six years after that he was diagnosed with a virulent form of [[leukemia]] from which he did not recover.&lt;ref name="2014 Jul Shawangunk Journal"/&gt; He died on December 30, 2014.&lt;ref name="John Berthot Obituary Daily Freeman"/&gt;

'''Other names used'''

Named John Alex Berthot at birth, he used Jake Berthot as his professional name all his life. His surname is pronounced BEAR-TOE.&lt;ref name="2015 Jan NYT"/&gt;

'''Joe Frank''' (August 19, 1938 – January 15, 2018) was a French-born American [[radio]] personality and humorist known best for his often philosophical, humorous, [[surrealism|surrealist]], and sometimes [[absurdism|absurd]] [[monologue]]s and [[radio drama]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peabody.uga.edu/winners/search.php Peabody Awards Web site] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080726170249/http://www.peabody.uga.edu/winners/search.php |date=2008-07-26 }} – search for Joe Frank&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Frank was born '''Joseph Langermann''' in [[Strasbourg, France]], near the border of Germany, to father Meier Langermann (then aged 51, a Polish-born shoe manufacturer) and mother Friederike "Fritzi" Passweg (then aged 27). Frank was born months before the family fled from Nazi Germany’s persecution of Jewish people in their native Poland &lt;ref name="rsandomir"&gt;Richard Sandomir, [https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/19/obituaries/joe-frank-spinner-of-strange-radio-tales-is-dead-at-79.html "Joe Frank, Spinner of Strange Radio Tales, Is Dead at 79,"] ''[[New York Times]]'', January 19, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; Legislation to allow the family and others into the country was passed by the US Congress twice, the first having been vetoed by President Roosevelt.&lt;ref&gt;Congressional Record on 1940 May 2 (86 Congressional Record 5425 (1940), page 5469): By Mrs. O'DAY [Caroline Love Goodwin, congresswoman from New York]:
    H.R. 9651: A bill for the relief of Meier Langermann, his wife Friederike, and son Joseph; to the Committee on Immigration and Naturalization.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Senate passed the bill on  1940 June 22 (86 Congressional Record 8909 (1940), page 8974). President Roosevelt vetoed the bill on 1940 July 2 (86 Congressional Record 9142 (1940), page 9146). Quoth his message: 'Meier Langermann, his wife and son, formerly of Germany, although citizens of Poland'&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Congresswoman O'Day submitted an identical bill the next day (86 Congressional Record 9231 (1940), page 9244) A reading of the bill on 1940 September 30 (86 Congressional Record 12842 (1940), page 12870) noted: "Meier Langermann, his wife Friederike, and son Joseph, as of April 12, 1939, the date on which they were admitted temporarily to the United States." Congress passed it on March 6, 1941 (87 Congressional Record 1902 (1941), page 1906).&lt;/ref&gt; His father died of kidney failure when Joe was five years old.&lt;ref name="rsandomir"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.italiangen.org/NYCDeathresults.asp?kind=exact&amp;Esurname=langerman&amp;Efirst=meyer&amp;StartYear=1943&amp;EndYear=1943&amp;County=Manhattan&amp;B1=Submit NYC Death Index Results]&lt;/ref&gt; The next year his mother married Teddy Frank and changed Joe's last name.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.joefrank.com/newsarch/LAW97.html Joe Frank :: News and Reviews] – ''[[LA Weekly]]'' – "Joe Frank is Off the Air"&lt;/ref&gt;

In his twenties, Frank studied at [[Hofstra University]] in [[New York (state)|New York]] and later at the [[Iowa Writers' Workshop]]. In 1964, he taught five grades of English at the Sands Point Academy for Gifted Children in Sands Point, NY. From 1965-1975, Joe taught English and Russian literature and philosophy at the [[Dalton School]] in Manhattan and later, while working as a music promoter (1976-1977), became interested in the power of radio.&lt;ref name="rsandomir"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.salon.com/ent/feature/2000/03/07/joe_frank/print.html March 7, 2000 Salon.com] article by Susan Emerling.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early radio career==
In 1977, Frank started volunteering at [[Pacifica Radio|Pacifica Network station]] [[WBAI]] in [[New York (state)|New York]], performing experimental radio involving monologues, improvisational actors, and live music during late-night, free-form hours. In 1978, he moved to Washington, D.C., to serve as a co-anchor for the weekend edition of [[National Public Radio]]'s ''[[All Things Considered]]'', his first paying radio job.&lt;ref name="rsandomir"/&gt;

During this period he wrote, performed in, and produced 18 dramas for the "[[NPR Playhouse]]," which won several awards. His 1982 monologue "Lies" was used, without permission, as the inspiration for the [[Martin Scorsese]] movie ''[[After Hours (film)|After Hours]]''.&lt;ref name="Panopticist"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://andrewhearst.com/blog/2008/05/the_scandalous_origins_of_martin_scorseses_after_hours | title=The Scandalous Origins of Martin Scorsese’s ''After Hours'' | work=Panopticist | date=May 27, 2008 | accessdate=September 9, 2015 | author=Hearst, Andrew}}&lt;/ref&gt; (He later settled out of court for a "handsome" settlement.)&lt;ref name="Salon"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://archive.salon.com/ent/feature/2000/03/07/joe_frank/index.html | title=Public radio's bad dream | work=[[Salon.com]] | date=March 8, 2000 | accessdate=September 9, 2015 | author=Susan Emerling | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090919030503/http://archive.salon.com/ent/feature/2000/03/07/joe_frank/index.html | archivedate=September 19, 2009 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==KCRW, 1986–2018==
In 1986, on the invitation of Ruth Hirschman Seymour, the general manager of [[NPR]]'s [[Santa Monica]], [[California]] affiliate [[KCRW]], Frank moved to Santa Monica, where he wrote, produced, and performed in his own weekly hour-long radio program, "Joe Frank: Work In Progress."

While at KCRW, Frank received several accolades.

Joe Frank continued to work at KCRW until 2002, and his work evolved, as evidenced by the diverse series he produced. The first was "Work in Progress," then "In The Dark," followed by "Somewhere out There", and finally "The Other Side."

Beginning in 2004, Frank began creating full-length shows for subscribers to his web site.

In 2012, Frank started producing periodic half-hour shows for KCRW's "UnFictional" series. He continued to produce all-new shows for the series until months before his death.

==2003–2018==
Starting in 2003, Frank performed on stage at [[South Coast Repertory ]] in Costa Mesa, CA, the [[Art Institute of Chicago]] and the [[Steppenwolf Theatre]] in [[Chicago, Illinois]]; at the [[Great American Music Hall]] in San Francisco; and in Los Angeles at the [[Hammer Museum]] and Largo at the [[Coronet Theatre (Los Angeles)|Coronet]], as well as other venues.

His 230-hour body of work continues to be re-aired on the [[Pacifica Radio]] affiliate station [[KPFA]] in [[Berkeley, California]] and many [[NPR]] stations including [[WNYC]] New York, and [[KCRW]] [[Santa Monica]]. The radio station at the University of California at Davis, [[KDVS]] and the independent station [[WFMU]] in Jersey City also re-air shows.

In 2012, Frank returned to KCRW for episodes of the station's "UnFictional" program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.kcrw.com/pressroom/2012/07/radio-icon-joe-frank-returns-to-kcrw/|title=Radio Icon Joe Frank Returns to KCRW|date=2012-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kcrw.com/etc/programs/uf|title=UnFictional|date=2012-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Frank had surgery to treat colon cancer in May 2014.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gofundme.com/joefrank?u=17269028#story|title=Joe Frank Medical &amp; Recovery Fund|last=|first=|date=|website=gofundme.com|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frank was hospitalized in December 2015 due to a [[gastrointestinal perforation]] following a routine medical procedure.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This led to heart issues and Joe's complete recovery took a full year. His colon cancer returned in July 2017; he had surgery in October 2017 to excise a tumor in his colon in October 2017.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  He died on January 15, 2018 after multiple reversals following the surgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/amphtml/local/obituaries/joe-frank-boundary-pushing-storyteller-whose-medium-was-radio-dies-at-79/2018/01/17/d5238ebc-fb9a-11e7-ad8c-ecbb62019393_story.html |title=Joe Frank, boundary-pushing storyteller whose medium was radio, dies at 79 |first=Harrison |last=Smith |date=January 17, 2018 |work=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2018/01/16/578422431/radio-artist-writer-joe-frank-dies-at-79|title=Radio Artist, Writer Joe Frank Dies At 79|work=NPR.org|access-date=2018-01-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Radio programs==
Frank's radio programs are often dark and ironic and employ a dry sense of humor and the sincere delivery of ideas or stories that are patently absurd. Subject matter often includes religion, life's meaning, death, and Frank's relationships with women.&lt;ref name="rsandomir"/&gt;

Frank's voice is distinctive, resonant, authoritative, and, because of his occasional voice-over work, often oddly familiar. At the 2003 Third Coast Festival, he explained that he was recording in Dolby and playing back without it, which created Joe's now familiar intimate and gritty sound.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thirdcoastfestival.org/library/collections/3-tcf-winners/year/2003 Third Coast Archives] – scroll to bottom for speech.&lt;/ref&gt; A 1987 [[Los Angeles Times]] article described it as a voice "like dirty honey" and "rich as chocolate."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Radio Noir | journal = Los Angeles Times | date = 1987-11-22 | first = Jamie | last = Diamond| id = | url = http://articles.latimes.com/1987-11-22/magazine/tm-23630_1_joe-frank | accessdate = 2012-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The repetitive cadence of the music, drones and Frank's dry, announcer-like delivery are sometimes mixed with recorded phone calls with actor/friends such as [[Larry Block]], [[Debi Mae West]] and Arthur Miller (not the playwright), broken into segments over the course of each hour-long program.

Frank's series "The Other Side" included excerpts from [[Buddhist]] teacher [[Jack Kornfield]]'s [[Dharma talk]]s at [[Spirit Rock Meditation Center]]. In an interview on [[KPFA]]'s "Morning Show," Kornfield was asked about working with Joe Frank. Kornfield explained that, although he had never met or talked to Joe Frank or heard his show, he didn't mind Frank using the lectures and that many of his meditation students had found Kornfield through the show.

The '''Joint Service Defence College (JSDC)''' was a training academy for [[British Armed Forces|British military]] personnel in the period from 1983 to 1997. It has now been amalgamated into the [[Joint Services Command and Staff College]].

==History==
The college was originally established as the '''Combined Staff College''' (CSC) in 1947.&lt;ref name=nmm&gt;[http://www.nmm.ac.uk/collections/archive/catalogue/record.cfm?ID=RNCG National Maritime Museum Archive]&lt;/ref&gt; The college was an independent Ministry of Defence Establishment offering courses to officers of all three services.&lt;ref name=nmm/&gt; It was based at [[Latimer House]] in [[Latimer, Buckinghamshire]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/en-44951-latimer-house-national-defence-college-la Latimer House (National Defence College), Latimer] British Listed Buildings&lt;/ref&gt; It was renamed the '''National Defence College''' (NDC) in 1971. On 12 February 1974, an [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|IRA]] bombing at the NDC took place but there were no fatalities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/othelem/chron/ch74.htm A Chronology of the Conflict - 1974]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983 it was renamed the '''Joint Service Defence College''' (JSDC), and moved to the [[Royal Naval College, Greenwich]].&lt;ref name=nmm/&gt; The college was closed in 1997 and amalgamated into the new [[Joint Services Command and Staff College]].&lt;ref name=nmm/&gt;

==Staff and students==
The [[Commandant]] was always a [[Major-general]] or equivalent. Senior Directing Staff included [[Royal Navy]], [[British Army]], [[Royal Air Force]], civilian [[colonel]]s and equivalent: civilian G5 or Assistant Secretary ([[Consul (representative)|Counsellor]]). Those officers attending the course, which focussed on managing tri-service operations, were typically of [[lieutenant-colonel]] rank or equivalent&lt;ref name=guide&gt;[http://www.greenwich-guide.org.uk/february.htm Greenwich Guide]&lt;/ref&gt; and had to have had the potential to rise at least two grades in rank. Three courses, each of nine months,&lt;ref name=guide/&gt; were held every two years, each with 60 officers (typically 17 from each service plus 9 others from the civil service or the police). Those officers passing the course, or serving on the directing staff for at least six months, received the letters ''jsdc''. The majority of students went on to joint, central staff or international appointments. The crest featured a [[cormorant]], which was also the name of the college magazine.

[[File:JonasNovel.jpg|thumb|First edition]]

'''''Jonas''''' is a [[novel]] by Norwegian author [[Jens Bjørneboe]], originally published in 1955 by [[Aschehoug]]. It is widely recognised as one of his most important works,{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} and as one of the most significant Norwegian literary works of the post-war era.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} The novel has a complex narrative taken from several different environments from the 1920s [[Weimar Republic]] and the [[Nazi era]] to the 1950s Norwegian society.

The novel's [[title character]], "Jonas," is a first grader in Norway, who early in the novel encounters a public school system that according to Bjørneboe is increasingly controlled by the "[[salamander]]s," a term used [[metaphor]]ically for the bigoted enemies of culture which Bjørneboe sees in Norway at the time.
 
''Jonas'' is usually interpreted as a harsh critique of the Norwegian public school system and the social democratic society of the 1950s,&lt;ref&gt;Sander, Ola Skage Knudsen, ''Jens Bjørneboes kritikk av sosialdemokratiet 1945 - 1957. : Et forsvar for indivdet i kollektivismens tidsalder, mellom skjebne, idealisme og pragmatisme'', University of Oslo, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Baukhol, Bjørnar Steinsund, ''Romankunst og agitatorvirksomhet : Jonas og Jonas-debatten 1955-56'', University of Oslo, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; and has a warm portrayal of an alternative form of education, which is a thinly veiled reference to [[Waldorf education]]. At the time, Bjørneboe and his wife Lisel Bjørneboe both worked as Waldorf teachers in Oslo, and the central character "Johannes Marx" is inspired by Lisel. The novel however has a much broader focus than the education debate, Bjørneboe's intention was to portray the topic of [[Human nature|humanity]]. To this end, he uses four main biographies, which are all ultimately linked, with a particular emphasis on the character of "Jonas."

In this novel, Bjørneboe articulates his often cited idea that [[Nazism]], broadly construed to mean hostility to the idea of humanity, could manifest itself anywhere and any time, for example in Norway in the 1950s.

Bjørneboe, a proponent of the conservative [[Riksmål]] language (the traditional language of the educated elite of Norway), uses the radical [[Samnorsk]] language as an expression of the lack of culture of the salamanders.

'''Lauren B. Resnick''' is an [[educational psychology|educational psychologist]] who has made notable contributions to the [[cognitive science]] of learning and instruction. She is a professor of [[psychology]] at the [[University of Pittsburgh]], and was previously director of the University's [[Learning Research and Development Center]]. In 1986-1987, Resnick was the president of the [[American Educational Research Association]]. She received the 1998 E. L. Thorndike Award from the [[American Psychological Association]].

In her book "Education and Learning to Think" (The National Academies Press, 1987) and the 1987 Presidential Address, she proposed that the concept of [[out of school learning]] is very beneficial for children and young adults. In her address she stated: "Because they are continuously engaged with objects and situations that make sense to them, people do not fall into the trap of forgetting what their calculation or their reasoning is about".&lt;ref&gt;Resnick, Lauren B. “The 1987 Presidential Address: Learning in School and Out.” ''Educational Researcher'', vol. 16, no. 9, 1987, pp. 13–54. ''JSTOR'', JSTOR, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1175725 www.jstor.org/stable/1175725]. Retrieved 2018-03-03.&lt;/ref&gt;

Having discovered her passion for history and literature while pursuing her bachelor's degree at Radcliffe College, Resnick continued her studies earning both a master's degree in teaching and her doctorate from Harvard University before teaching abroad at the American School of Paris.

In addition to working as a research associate for the Harvard University Committee on Programmed Instruction and Laboratory for Research in Instruction and then as a lecturer in the Office of Research and Evaluation in the Division of Teacher Education at City University of New York, Resnick also served as a Senior Scientist and Staff Consultant at Basic Systems, Inc. before accepting her first faculty position at the University of Pittsburgh. As a faculty member, educational researcher, and scholar, Resnick has dedicated more than 50 years to conducting pioneering research on learning and development, scientific understanding in children, and socially shared cognition. As past president of the American Educational Research Association (AERA, 1986-1987) and a member of both the National Academy of Education (NAE) and International Academy of Education (IAE), she has served as an invited lecturer, visiting scholar, and keynote speaker at universities around the world. In recognition of her distinguished contributions to research, she has received numerous awards and honors including as a Fellow in the American Psychological Association (APA) and American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS); Lifetime National Associate of the National Academies of Sciences (Engineering and Medicine); Award for Distinguished Contributions to Research in Education (AERA, 1990); Edward L. Thorndike Award for Distinguished Psychological Contributions to Education (APA, 1998); ''Oeuvre'' Award for Outstanding Contributions to the Science of Learning and Instruction (European Association for Research on Learning and Instruction, 1999); Award for Distinguished Contributions of Applications of Psychology to Education and Training (APA, 2007); Wallace Foundation Distinguished Lecture Award (AERA, 2009); and the FABBS Award (Fabbs Foundation, 2011). As of 2016, Resnick published more than 200 scholarly works that have been cited more than 25,000 times. Her recent authored and edited books include: ''Socializing Intelligence Through Academic Talk and Dialogue'' (2015, with C. Asterhan and S. L. Clarke); ''Reading and Writing with Understanding'' (2009, with S. Hampton); ''Reading and Writing Grade by Grade'' (2009, with S. Hampton); and ''Speaking and Listening for Preschool through Third Grade'' (2009, with C. E. Snow).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://insidetheacademy.asu.edu/lauren-resnick|title=Lauren Resnick {{!}} Inside the Academy|website=insidetheacademy.asu.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents of the law state that it is meant to promote critical thinking and improve education.&lt;ref name=AP&gt;{{cite news|title=Protest rally pushes Louisiana science law repeal|newspaper=The Associated Press|date=28 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; State Senator [[Ben Nevers]] said the law is intended to allow educators to create an environment that "(promotes) [[critical thinking]] skills, logical analysis, and open and objective discussions of scientific theories such as evolution, the [[Abiogenesis|origins of life]], global warming, and [[human cloning]]."&lt;ref name=schon&gt;{{cite web|last=Schon |first=Sylvia |url=http://www.hammondstar.com/articles/2008/04/06/top_stories/9327.txt |title=Bill allows teaching creationism as science |publisher=Hammondstar.com |date=2008-04-06 |accessdate=2012-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Senator Ben Nevers |url=http://www.legis.la.gov/Legis/ViewDocument.aspx?d=631380&amp;n=Resume%20Digest%20for%20SB733 |title=Digest for SB733 |publisher=Louisiana Legislature |date= |accessdate=2008-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics argue that SB733 simply opens a backdoor to teaching [[creationism]] in public schools, which is illegal under federal law.&lt;ref&gt;Basilan, Marvie (2015). [http://www.christiantoday.com/article/in.louisiana.students.read.the.book.of.genesis.in.their.science.classes/55647.htm "In Louisiana, students read the Book of Genesis in their science classes." ''Christian Today'' June 8, 2015.]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alan Leshner]], the executive publisher of ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', condemned the bill as the "latest effort to insert religious, unscientific views into science classrooms."&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|author=Ginger Pinholster |url=http://www.aaas.org/news/releases/2008/0611la_letter.shtml |title=AAAS Writes Louisiana's Speaker of the House, Reiterating Opposition to Anti-Science Education Efforts |publisher=Aaas.org |date= |accessdate=2012-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leshner stated the bill would, "unleash an assault against scientific integrity, leaving students confused about science and unprepared to excel in a modern workforce."&lt;ref name=spt1&gt;{{cite news|last=Leshner|first=Alan|title='Academic freedom' bill dangerous distraction|newspaper=Shreveport Times|date=28 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, high school student [[Zack Kopplin]] launched a high-profile campaign sponsored by Louisiana State Senator [[Karen Carter Peterson]] to repeal the law. Kopplin's campaign has been endorsed by 78 [[List of Nobel laureates|Nobel laureates]], the [[New Orleans]] City Council, and more than a dozen scientific and educational associations.&lt;ref name="repealcreationism"&gt;{{cite web|author=Name: |url=http://www.repealcreationism.com/endorsements/ |title=Endorsements and Letters &amp;#124; Repealing the Louisiana Science Education Act |publisher=Repealcreationism.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bills to repeal the LSEA have failed to advance past the Senate Education committee five years in a row from 2011 through 2015.

==Background to the bill==

Senator Nevers originally pre-filed the bill as the Louisiana Education Freedom Act (SB 561), at the behest of the [[Louisiana Family Forum]] to allow creationism to be taught in public schools.&lt;ref name=schon/&gt; "They (the Louisiana Family Forum) believe that scientific data related to creationism should be discussed when dealing with Darwin's theory.

Critics of the bill suggest that it is intended as an end-run around the federal ban on the teaching of creationism in public schools, and say that the sole purpose of the law is to provide legal cover to educators who want to introduce things other than science to the teaching of evolution in contravention of court rulings in cases such as ''[[Edwards v.

==Legislative history==

=== Passage of Act ===
Senator [[Ben Nevers]], Chairman of the Louisiana Senate Education Committee, a [[Bogalusa]] [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]], filed the "Louisiana Academic Freedom Act," (SB 561) on March 21, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ben Nevers |url=http://www.legis.la.gov/Legis/ViewDocument.aspx?d=472973&amp;n=SB561%20Original |title=SB561  |publisher=Legis.state.la.us |date=2008-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill was heard by the Senate Education committee on April 17.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Senate Education Committee |url=http://senate.la.gov/Education/archives/2008/04-17-04.pdf |title=Senate Committee on Education April 17, 2008  |publisher=Legis.state.la.us |date=2008-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Senate Education Committee |url=http://senate.la.gov/Video/2008/April/041708_educ.ram |title=Video of Senate Committee on Education April 17, 2008 Hearing  |publisher=Legis.state.la.us |date=2008-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; When introducing his legislation to the education committee, Senator Nevers substituted the original bill with SB733, the "Louisiana Science Education Act" or LSEA. After hearing two proponents in addition to Senator Nevers and approximately twenty opponents, the Education committee voted in favor of the legislation. On April 22, the Education committee presented the substitute bill to the Senate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Senate Education Committee |url=http://www.legis.la.gov/Legis/BillInfo.aspx?i=211183  |title=SB733 History  |publisher=Legis.state.la.us |date=2008-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill was passed by the Senate on April 28 by a unanimous vote of 35 to 0.

The Louisiana House referred LSEA to the Committee on Education on April 30. The House Committee on Education reported the bill favorably on May 21 by a unanimous vote of 14 to 0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Senate Education Committee |url=http://house.louisiana.gov/Agendas_2008/May_08/0521_08_ED.pdf |title=House Committee on Education Agenda May 21, 2008  |publisher=Legis.state.la.us |date=2008-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Senate Education Committee |url=http://house.louisiana.gov/rmarchive/Ram/RamMay08/0521_08_EDUC.ram |title=House Committee on Education Video May 21, 2008 |publisher=Legis.state.la.us |date=2008-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The full House passed the legislation by a vote of 94 to 3 on June 11, 2008.

On June 16 the Senate unanimously accepted the House's amendments. Governor [[Bobby Jindal]] signed the legislation into law on June 25 making the LSEA Act 473 of 2008.

===Repeal attempts===
Bills that would have repealed the LSEA were introduced by Senator [[Karen Carter Peterson]] as SB70 in 2011, SB374 in 2012, SB26 in 2013 and SB175 in 2014. SB70 failed to pass on a 1-5 vote by the Senate Education committee after an hour-long hearing. The bill was then deferred by the committee ending consideration on the legislation for the year.&lt;ref name=nbc33&gt;{{cite news|title=Bill to repeal La Science Education Act deferred|url=http://www.nbc33tv.com/news/louisiana-politics/bill-to-repeal-la-science-education-act-deferred|accessdate=5 February 2013|newspaper=NBC 33|date=26 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; SB374 was rejected by the Senate Education committee in a 2-1 vote with four abstentions.&lt;ref name=sb374&gt;{{cite news|title=Repeal effort fails in Louisiana|url=http://ncse.com/news/2012/04/repeal-effort-fails-louisiana-007311|accessdate=5 February 2013|newspaper=NCSE|date=20 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The third attempt to repeal the measure met again with failure when the Senate Education Committee voted 3-2 to defer the bill on May 1, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wdsu.com/news/around-louisiana/third-time-no-charm-bill-to-repeal-science-act-fails/-/9853348/19977426/-/847a3pz/-/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sb175&gt;{{cite news | title=Repeal effort revived again in Louisiana | url=http://ncse.com/news/2014/02/repeal-effort-revived-again-louisiana-0015429 | accessdate=10 April 2014|newspaper=NCSE | date=26 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fourth attempt was rejected in a 3-1 vote on April 24, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theadvertiser.com/story/news/local/education/2014/04/24/panel-kills-repeal-of-louisiana-science-education-act/8103127/ |title=Panel kills repeal of Louisiana Science Education Act |last=Hasten |first=Mike |location=Lafayette, Louisiana |date=25 April 2014 |publisher=[[The Daily Advertiser (Lafayette)|The Daily Advertiser]] |accessdate=19 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2014/04/25/christians-have-grabbed-theocratic-control-over-public-schools-in-louisiana-critic-says/ |title=Christians have grabbed 'theocratic control over public schools' in Louisiana, critic says |last=Kaufman |first=Scott|date=25 April 2014 |publisher=[[The Raw Story]] |accessdate=19 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fifth attempt was rejected in a 4-3 vote on April 22, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://theadvocate.com/news/12176293-123/bill-to-repeal-disputed-science |title=Rejected again: Bill to repeal Louisiana law critics say allows teaching creationism fails in committee |last=Sentell |first=Will |location=Baton Rouge, Louisiana |date=27 April 2015 |publisher=[[The Advocate (Louisiana)|The Advocate]] |accessdate=2 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism of bill==

===Backlash===
The [[scientific community]] in the [[United States]] has called the Louisiana Science Education Act an "anti-science" law with the purpose of allowing creationism into public school science classrooms.&lt;ref name=AAAS/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aibs.org/position-statements/20080620_joint_statement.html |title=Eight Scientific Societies Write to Governor Bobby Jindal Urging Opposition to the Louisiana Science Education Act |publisher=Aibs.org |date= |accessdate=2012-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Society for Integrative and Comparative Biology]] had planned to host a conference in New Orleans in 2011, but decided to change the location of the conference "in large part" because of the LSEA, stating that it was their "firm opinion ... that this law undermines the integrity of science and science education in Louisiana." They also announced that they would not consider hosting further conferences in New Orleans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sicb.org/resources/LouisianaLetterJindal.pdf |title=ControlCenter2 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lifted&gt;{{cite news|title=SICB lifts boycott of New Orleans|url=http://ncse.com/news/2013/01/sicb-lifts-boycott-new-orleans-0014676|accessdate=6 February 2013|newspaper=NCSE|date=14 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The New Orleans Convention and Visitors Bureau estimated that losing the conference caused an economic loss to Louisiana of at least $2.7 million.&lt;ref name=lifted/&gt;&lt;ref name=citybiz&gt;{{cite news|title=N.O. convention bureau 'saddened' by scientific conference loss|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-19893967.html|accessdate=6 February 2013|newspaper=New Orleans CityBusiness|date=17 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;   SICB lifted their boycott in early 2013 after the New Orleans City Council and Orleans Parish School Board both rejected the teaching of creationism in science classes.&lt;ref name=lifted/&gt;

Prominent critic of the Louisiana Science Education Act [[Zack Kopplin]] has stated that the law "leaves our students at a disadvantage when competing for jobs in the global economy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.repealcreationism.com/390/legislation-filed-to-repeal-louisiana’s-creationism-law/ Legislation filed to repeal Louisiana’s creationism law]&lt;/ref&gt; To illustrate this, he often humorously refers to the fact that when you search [[creationism]] on [[Monster.com]] or [[CareerBuilder]] you get "zero jobs," while when you search [[biology]], you find over 1000.&lt;ref name=lamar2&gt;{{cite web|last=White |first=Lamar |url=http://noladefender.com/content/evolving-leader |title=Evolving as a Leader |publisher=Noladefender.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. [[Barbara Forrest]], professor of philosophy at Southeastern Louisiana University in Hammond,&lt;ref&gt;[[Barbara Forrest]]&lt;/ref&gt; a prominent critic of the [[Discovery Institute]] and the [[intelligent design]] movement, has explained that she thinks the law itself passed because,

&lt;blockquote&gt;In Louisiana, we had no organizational framework to respond to [the Louisiana Science Education Act]. One of the ways that Florida, for example, has kept [creationism] out is they have a very active, well organized Florida Citizens for Science. At the time we didn't have that. I and a couple of people, very, very quickly, had to get something together. [Although] there weren't very many of us... we did put up some opposition, but Louisiana Family Forum had been planning such a move probably since their founding in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Barbara Forrest |url=http://www.csicop.org/specialarticles/show/interview_with_defender_of_evolution_and_csicon_speaker_barbara_forrest |title=Interview with Barbara Forrest, Defender of Evolution |publisher=Csicop.org |date= |accessdate=2012-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Zack Kopplin]] began an effort to repeal the LSEA while he was a Senior in high school in 2010. His repeal bill was sponsored by Senator [[Karen Carter Peterson]].

===Creationism===
Critics of the Louisiana Science Education Act call the law a [[creationism]] law, because it singles out specific [[scientific theory|scientific theories]], which happen to be politically controversial, for teachers to "critique and review" using "supplemental materials."  The theories in question include "evolution, the origins of life, global warming, and cloning."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legis.state.la.us/billdata/streamdocument.asp?did=482728 |title=SB 733 |date= |accessdate=2012-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jerry Coyne]], a prominent biologist and President of the [[Society for the Study of Evolution]] sarcastically illustrated what he perceived as problematic about the law by saying,

&lt;blockquote&gt;Yep, we don't need more critical thinking in areas like physics, chemistry, or medicine—just human cloning, evolution, and global warming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2011/05/03/the-louisiana-science-education-act-letter-to-governor-jindal-and-request-for-reader-action/ |title=The Louisiana "Science Education Act": letter to Governor Jindal and request for reader action |publisher=Whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com |date=2011-05-02 |accessdate=2012-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Prominent critic of the law, [[Zack Kopplin]] explained:

&lt;blockquote&gt;You don't need a law to teach critical thinking. That's what science is. You need a law to teach creationism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3036697//vp/43199385#43199385 |title=Hardball with Chris Matthews: High School Student takes on Administration |publisher=MSNBC |date=2012-06-04 |accessdate=2012-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another prominent critic, [[Barbara Forrest|Dr. Barbara Forrest]], is also wary of the law because the Board of Elementary and Secondary Education's initial draft policy to implement the Louisiana Science Education Act was changed under pressure from a local conservative Christian group, the [[Louisiana Family Forum]]. The initial draft would have explicitly prohibited teaching religion under the guise of 'critical thinking' and using creationist materials in public school science classrooms. Dr. Forrest said,

{{quote|The initial version&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lasciencecoalition.org/docs/LDoE_Proposed_LSEA_Policy_12.2.08.pdf |title=Student/School Performance and Support Committee, December 2, 2008 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the policy contained two crucial statements that would have prohibited school districts from doing what the legislative sponsors and creationist authors of the LA Science Education Act designed the law to allow them to do: (1) "Religious beliefs shall not be advanced under the guise of encouraging critical thinking"; and (2) "Materials that teach creationism or intelligent design or that advance the religious belief that a supernatural being created humankind shall be prohibited for use in science classes."

[President of the Louisiana Family Forum, Rev. Gene Mills] referred to these statements as expressing "religious hostility" and "a cheap shot." In doing so, he revealed his true intent concerning both the LSEA and the BESE policy: to promote and protect the religious agenda of the LA Family Forum and its Discovery Institute accomplices. If, as Mills keeps insisting, the LSEA were only intended to promote good science education and not to promote creationism, there would be no reason for him to object to the initial policy's prohibition against teaching "creationism or intelligent design or that advance the religious belief that a supernatural being created humankind.

In the revised policy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lasciencecoalition.org/docs/LDoE_Proposed_LSEA_Policy_1.13.09.pdf |title=Student/School Performance and Support Committee, January 13, 2009 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; introduced at the S/SPS Committee meeting on January 13, 2009, the first statement had been deleted prior to the meeting. To the second statement, another had been added: "Evaluations of supplementary materials shall be made without regard to the religious or non-religious beliefs and affiliations of the authors of supplementary materials." This new sentence was clearly added to prohibit any supplemental material from being challenged based on its having been authored by creationists."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Published by admin on 25 January 2009 at 09:02 pm |url=http://lasciencecoalition.org/2009/01/25/louisiana-open-for-business/ |title=Louisiana Open for Business - Creationists Welcome |publisher=Lasciencecoalition.org |date=2009-01-25 |accessdate=2012-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[Americans United for Separation of Church and State]] is also worried about the process for parents to challenge supplemental materials brought into the classroom, because "the proposed procedure for reviewing challenged supplemental materials... appears designed to provide a forum for promoting [[creationism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lasciencecoalition.org/docs/AU_BESE_LA_LA_Register_2009.12.31.pdf |title=Americans United for Separation of Church and State's Letter to the Louisiana State Board of Elementary and Secondary Education |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barbara Forrest is the current Secretary for Americans United.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.au.org/about/board-of-trustees&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, supporters of the law have openly admitted that its purpose is to bring creationism into public school science classrooms. In July 2010, the [[Livingston Parish]] [[school board]] discussed using this law to teach creationism in public school science class. The [[National Center for Science Education]] reported,

&lt;blockquote&gt;The director of curriculum for [Livingston Parish] reportedly told the board that, under the Louisiana Science Education Act, schools are allowed to present "critical thinking and creationism" in science classes. The response from the board was enthusiastic, with David Tate asking, "Why can't we get someone with religious beliefs to teach creationism?" and Clint Mitchell adding, "Teachers should have the freedom to look at creationism and find a way to get it into the classroom."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ncse.com/news/2010/07/creationist-rumblings-louisiana-005799 |title=Creationist rumblings in Louisiana |publisher=Ncse.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Senator [[Ben Nevers]], the sponsor of the Louisiana Science Education Act, has also said that the Louisiana Family Forum suggested the bill because "They believe that scientific data related to creationism should be discussed when dealing with Darwin's theory."&lt;ref name="schon" /&gt;

The law was written with a caveat: it says that it should not be construed "to promote any religious doctrine, promote discrimination for or against a particular set of religious beliefs or promote discrimination for or against religion or nonreligion."

Critics like James Gill, who writes for the ''[[New Orleans Times Picayune]]'' dismiss this clause. Gill says the line was "written with a nod and a wink, and it just goes to show how much craftier the obscurantists have become."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Scott Threlkeld / The Times-Picayune |url=http://www.nola.com/opinions/index.ssf/2011/06/louisianas_science_education_a.html |title=Louisiana's Science Education Act lacking in science |publisher=Nola.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This wording is a religion disclaimer from the Discovery Institute's model bill and is in all of the different variants of the bill in every state where it has been introduced.

==Repeal effort==
In early June 2010, a student at [[Baton Rouge Magnet High School]], Zack Kopplin, launched a campaign to repeal the law as his high school [[senior project]]. He started working on a repeal with [[Barbara Forrest]], who was an [[expert witness]] at the ''[[Kitzmiller v. Dover]]'' trial and was responsible for demonstrating [[intelligent design]] was simply creationism dressed up to appear scientific.&lt;ref name=lamar&gt;{{cite web|last=White |first=Lamar |url=http://noladefender.com/content/evolving-leader |title=Evolving as a Leader |publisher=Nola Defender |date= |accessdate=2012-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Kopplin, he is organizing Louisiana "students, scientists, clergy, teachers, and business leaders in support of repealing the Louisiana Science Education Act."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Name: |url=http://www.repealcreationism.com/mission-statement/ |title=Mission Statement &amp;#124; Repealing the Louisiana Science Education Act |publisher=Repealcreationism.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They convinced Senator [[Karen Carter Peterson]], a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] from [[New Orleans]], to sponsor their repeal bill. Representative [[Walt Leger III]], who represents part of Senator Peterson's district, agreed to handle the legislation in the House. Senator Peterson introduced SB 70 to repeal the Louisiana Science Education Act on April 14, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.legis.state.la.us/billdata/streamdocument.asp?did=740920&lt;/ref&gt;

The repeal effort gained support nationally and internationally. It is supported by 78 Nobel laureate scientists, the City of [[New Orleans]], the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]], the largest general science organization in the world with over 10 million members, and many other organizations.&lt;ref name=repealcreationism/&gt;

SB 70 was heard in the Senate Education Committee on May 26, 2011. After a heated debate, where in response to being presented the Nobel laureate letter, Senator [[Julie Quinn]] declared she was "tired of seeing little letters behind everyone's names,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://cenlamar.com/2011/07/11/summer-interview-series-part-one-zack-kopplin/ |title=Summer Interview Series (Part One): Zack Kopplin " CenLamar |publisher=Cenlamar.com |date=2011-07-11 |accessdate=2012-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Senate Education Committee voted 5-1 to defer action on SB 70, in effect killing it. The sole vote for SB 70 was Senator [[Yvonne Dorsey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ncse.com/news/2011/05/repeal-effort-fails-committee-006685 |title=Repeal effort fails in committee |publisher=NCSE |date= |accessdate=2012-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bill was introduced and rejected again from 2012 through 2015, see section [[#Repeal attempts|Repeal attempts]]. In 2013 Kopplin said about Bobby Jindal: "I expect this law bothers him as much as it bothers me. He's a Brown biology major."&lt;ref name="Weiss"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Weiss | first = Joanna | title = Bobby Jindal and the problem of the 'stupid party' | work = [[Boston Globe]] | date = 2013-01-29 | accessdate = 2014-04-10 | url = https://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/2013/01/29/bobby-jindal-and-problem-stupid-party/aK8w7jgHOqI7TjBIemgcVM/story.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Creationism===
Nine [[academic freedom bills]] were proposed in various state legislatures in 2011. The effort to repeal the Louisiana Science Education Act may have had an effect in dampening the pressure to pass those bills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ncse.com/evolution/antievolution-legislation-scorecard |title=Antievolution Legislation Scorecard |publisher=NCSE |date= |accessdate=2012-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, the Louisiana Coalition for Science was able to stop two new efforts to put creationism in Louisiana classrooms after the passage of the Louisiana Science Education Act. First, they convinced the [[Louisiana Board of Elementary and Secondary Education]] to adopt new [[biology]] books after creationists attempted to have the books thrown out. Then they also succeeded in killing a Louisiana House bill (HB 580) which was meant to weaken the Board of Elementary and Secondary Education's oversight of public school biology books and supplementary materials.&lt;ref name="lasciencecoalition"&gt;{{cite web|author=Published by admin on 24 June 2011 at 03:13 am |url=http://lasciencecoalition.org/2011/06/24/announcement-louisiana-hb-580-is-dead/ |title=Louisiana Coalition for Science " Announcement: Louisiana HB 580 is dead |publisher=Lasciencecoalition.org |date=2011-06-24 |accessdate=2012-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Louisiana College biology professor Wade Warren gave testimony in favor of the LSEA and opposed the repeal, along with challenging the ideological motives of many of the scientists who have opposed the LSEA. He also distributed to the Committee a letter from 15 Ph.D. scientists supporting academic freedom.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.evolutionnews.org/2011/05/scientists_issue_letter_suppor046881.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Support of bill==
Advocates of the bill argue that it does not concern Creationism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |people=Gene Mills |date=April 24, 2014 |title=Louisiana State Senate Education Committee meeting |medium=Webcast archive |url=http://senate.la.gov/Video/2014/April/042414EDUC.asx |format=Microsoft ASF |time=00:59:52 |timecaption=At time}}&lt;/ref&gt; The LSEA allows teachers to supplement additional information into the curricula that is not in the textbook. In fact, the bill does not even mention Creationism, and Section D states: "This section shall not be construed to promote any religious doctrine, promote discrimination for or against a particular set of religious beliefs, or promote discrimination for or against religion or nonreligion."&lt;ref name=nevers/&gt;

Furthermore, advocates of the bill argue it is necessary for three reasons. First, the supplementation provided for by the LSEA is needed to keep the science textbooks updated, because Biology textbooks are often already falling behind modern research by the time they are written, edited, and published. Second, most science textbooks have several, if not dozens, of known errors that can be solved with supplementation. Third, many science books are faulty of focusing on only one viewpoint when discussing controversial issues, and further do not accurately critique their proposed theory. The LSEA aids both in supplying the necessary critiques of the scientific theories, and also in providing the other viewpoints that are disregarded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |people=Jonathan Beard |date=April 24, 2014 |title=Louisiana State Senate Education Committee meeting |medium=Webcast archive |url=http://senate.la.gov/Video/2014/April/042414EDUC.asx |format=Microsoft ASF |time=01:01:53 |timecaption=At time}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''NATO Communications and Information Systems School''', (NCISS), is the School that provides formal technical training for [[NATO]] on certain Communication and information Systems (CIS) deployed on operations or exercises by the Alliance. NCISS operates as a training establishment for both NATO Strategic Commands and since 2004 it is responsible to the [[NATO CIS Services Agency]] (NCSA), in consultation with [[Allied Command Transformation]] (ACT).

The NCISS is due to be transferred from its present location in [[Latina, Lazio|Latina]], [[Italy]] to [[Oeiras, Portugal]].

== Historical notes ==
It was created in 1959 as a Contractor Training Facility to conduct [[ACE High|ACE HIGH]] instruction, the school was hosted by an Italian Air Force Base in [[Latina, Lazio|Latina]] (at that time the Centro Tecnico Addestrativo Difesa Aerea – CTA-DA), with the transformation of the Alliance was later modified to become the present day NATO Communications and Information Systems School.

In January 1963 [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe]] (SHAPE) assumed full control of this still relatively small facility and recruited NATO civilian instructional staff to replace those of the civil contractor. In 1964 the training responsibility was extended into the area of Command and Control with the introduction of the "Status, Control Alert and Reporting System" (SCARS). The facility at this time was named the "SHAPE Centralised Training Facility" (SCTF). A further expansion occurred in the early 1970s with the addition to the training curriculum of Satellite Communications (SATCOM).

In April 1974 the title of the SCTF was changed to "NATO Communications School Latina" (NCS). To satisfy the increasing requirements arising from NATO's Integrated Communications System (NICS) concept, a project for a custom built training facility was initiated in 1976. This project called for a facility comprising a training and administrative building and a separate student accommodation block. The new complex was opened in 1983. It enabled the School to take on additional training associated with NICS such as TARE, IVSN and TCF, and allowed the School to cater for future developments within NATO CIS.

The School entered the area of Officer Training in the late 1970s with courses for NATO CIS Staff Officers, Officers CIS Orientation, Communications Security Officers and ADP Site/Terminal Area Security Officers.

On the occasion of the 30th Anniversary in 1989 the School was renamed "NATO Communications and Information Systems School" (NCISS) since with the introduction and increased use of specific Command and Control Information Systems within NATO, a requirement arose for software engineering and programming. In the 1990s the School entered the area of ADP, project management and information systems training, part of it being offered as off-site courses throughout NATO Europe.

In October 1994, the first CIS Officers' Course for Cooperation Partner (CP) Nations was conducted at Latina. This course is now included in our annual training schedule. The School successfully introduced Computer Assisted Training (CAT) modules on all its courses and analyzed the parameters for future contractor produced CAT and Advanced Distributed Learning (ADL) programmes.

Additionally, in the last ten years, the lessons learned from NATO operations introduced the requirement of more deployable and mobile systems, to which the relative training is now being conducted in Latina.

Concurrently, in 2004 the NATO CIS Services Agency (NCSA) was established within NATO, with the mission to ensure the provision of secure "end-to-end" information exchange services required for NATO Consultation, Command, and Control (NC3) functions, using fielded communications and information systems in the most cost-effective manner, and the School was put under its organisation.

In the recent past and to date, the School is challenged with supplementary training, as a result of NATO involvement in "Beyond NATO's Area of Responsibility" operations.

== School organization ==
* NCISS Commandant - This post is assigned to an Italian Air Force Colonel. However, in the past it was covered also by Officers from other Nations. The name Commandant was first adopted when Mr Robert J. Pinoteau, a contractor first and then a NATO civilian who was a former French Navy Commandant, was appointed as the first Training Facility Director, in 1964. Since then, also when in 1971 the School was under the responsibility of the first military Colonel (Col. RNLA Theodore De Bie) the name has remained, also because, being the School hosted on an Italian Air Force Base, in Italian language the appointment of the Head of a Military Body is pronounced "Comandànte".
* Chief of staff and command group - They are responsible of the coordination of the activities assigned to the two Branches of the School, and take care of the planning and policy, either for works and for the training aspects. Additionally they also manage the System Approach to Training (SAT) methodology.
* Training branch - Core business of the School, the Training Branch is responsible for all training aspects at NCISS. It is composed of a Training Management office, responsible for the student administration, and the instructors are divided into some specific Subject Matter Expert Pools.
* Support branch - As far as the support to a typical military Unit is concerned, this is taken care of by the Support Branch. Its area of responsibility covers mainly financial, logistics, security, Information Technology and Personnel aspects.

== Mission ==
* Provide cost-effective highly developed formal training to personnel (military &amp; civilian) from NATO as well as Non-NATO Nations for the efficient operation and maintenance of those NATO Communication and Information Systems assigned to NCISS for instruction.
* Conduct orientation and management training on NATO CIS for selected (Staff) personnel.
Within the Systems Approach to Training Methodology conduct Course Design and Development and Internal Evaluation for those courses assigned to and delivered by NCISS and, when requested by ACT (JET) or NCSA HQ, provide assistance with the External Evaluation process Contribute professional expertise to NATO projects and related training matters.

== Training ==
In accordance with NATO mission and NCSA guiding principles and in the framework of NATO System Approach to Training methodology, the School today delivers cost-effective advanced formal training to military and civilian personnel from the NATO Nations and PfP/MD/ICI to obtain efficient operations and maintenance of NATO Communications and Information Systems training on NATO CIS.

Additionally, it conducts orientation courses and management training on NATO CIS for selected (Staff) personnel and contributes with its professional expertise to NATO projects for training related matters. Recently,  with the introduction of e-learning methodology, the School has also expanded the way training is delivered, associating the newly born Advanced Distributed Learning (ADL) to the traditional theoretical training in the classrooms and the practical hands-on in the laboratories, which is the added value of the School. Furthermore, even more requested is the off-site training, especially in Theatre of Operations, and the training on deployable, transportable and scalable systems, that is unavoidably the most flexible and efficient answer for the future of NATO operations.

The courses, covering both static systems and deployable communications equipment, are subject to continuous development and improvement to meet the new tasks assigned to NATO in Out-of-Area contingency operations, with emphasis on mobility and interfacing with national defence networks.

Training in Latina, using state-of-the art systems employing advanced techniques, and the professionalism of its instructors have also granted recognition to the School as an accredited CISCO Academy. Furthermore, NCISS is frequently available as a forum for important meetings and seminars, to increase knowledge and share experience.

NCISS's offers more than 90 different courses and over 370 sessions are scheduled. The courses, of various duration up to 6 weeks, range from the Communication area (SATCOM, DLOS, COM Systems, BME/NCN, Video Tele Conferencing, etc.), to the Information Systems (Functional Area Sub-Systems, MCCIS, AIFS, Geo-spatial IS, WISE, etc.), and the Security on Communications/AIS (Compusec, Information Assurance, Crypto, PTC, Cyber Defense, etc.) or simply on specific equipment (Fiber Optics, Crypto Devices, HF Radios, etc.) or even tailored on particular requirements (e.g. Frequency Management for Theatre of Operations, etc.).

The School response to NATO exercises and especially to SFOR, KFOR and ISAF operations, some of which even with short notice, was decisive for the deployment of qualified technicians and engineers in the new Theatres of Operation. Consequently, the overall student throughput is in continuous increase by a factor of about 15-20% a year.

== School motto ==
The NCISS motto is "[[Sapere aude|Sapére Aude]]" which is Latin for "dare to know".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1846">'''Nicolas Fizes''' (27 October 1648 in [[Frontignan]] – 1718) was a French professor of mathematics and hydrography, who lived under the reign of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]]. He is especially known as the [[Libretto|librettist]] who wrote [http://occitanica.eu/omeka/items/show/223 ''L'Opéra de Frontignan''] (1670), a play in [[Occitan language|occitan]], dealing with a slight love intrigue, and an idyllic poem on the fountain of Frontignan.

== Career ==
Nicolas Fizes's parents were carpenters in the French Navy. He studied with the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]], and became engineer to armies and a doctor of law. In 1682 he held the first professorship of mathematics and hydrography in [[Montpellier]].

From 1689, he headed a school of hydrography in Frontignan. In the hall of the Town Hall, he taught a few young sailors the concepts of mathematics and astrology. But this school was previously free, and Fizes asked for a salary of 150 pounds a year, which led to a conflict with the consuls of Frontignan. The school only survived 7 years, and closed its doors in 1696.

The '''Public Broadcast Service''' ('''PBS''') is a government-owned educational radio and television broadcast service located in [[Barbados]]. Public Broadcast Service owns a radio station, 91.1FM and its television programming was introduced in 2009.
The station falls under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Education and Human Resource Development.&lt;ref name="NationNews"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nationnews.com/story/309145714884655.php|title= PM: No more stations|accessdate=2008-11-07|first=P|last=A|authorlink=|date=2008-10-23|format=|work=[[The Daily Nation (Barbados)|Nation Newspaper]]|pages=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110526024338/http://www.nationnews.com/story/309145714884655.php|archivedate=2011-05-26|dead-url=yes|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main focus is educational programming.  The radio and television station will be geared towards everyone from school children to continuous education for adults.  The stated intention according to the acting Education Minister Patrick Todd, was that: "if Barbados wants to be competitive, there must be further reform of the educational system, to fully embrace and deploy all the technologies... in order to reach those individuals who do not respond readily to traditional teaching methods."

Todd added that the PBS would cater to those Barbadians, who, for one reason or another, want to re-educate themselves. "The PBS for Education in Barbados will have the capacity to offer certified online training courses for teachers, public officers, police officers, fire officers and the Defence Force," he explained.&lt;ref name="Caribbean Press"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.caribbeanpressreleases.com/articles/4129/1/Barbados-Ministry-of-Education-Launches-Public-Broadcast-Service-/Free-to-air-TV-station.html |title= Barbados Ministry of Education Launches Public Broadcast Service |accessdate=2008-11-07 |first= |last= |authorlink= |date=2008-10-23 |work=Caribbean Press Releases |pages= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The facility for the service will encompass a radio station, a free-to-air television station and an umbrella website. It will fall under the auspice of the Media Resource Department (Formerly the Ministry’s Audio-Visual Aids Department from the years 1969-1996) at Government Hill, will officially be in charge of overseeing the service.&lt;ref name="Barbados Advocate"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.barbadosadvocate.com/NewViewNewsleft.cfm?Record=37251 |title= Harmonisation of technology in teaching still needed |first= |last= |authorlink= |date=2008-10-23 |format= |work=[[Barbados Advocate|Barbados Advocate Newspaper]] |pages= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120215152331/http://www.barbadosadvocate.com/NewViewNewsleft.cfm?Record=37251|archivedate=2012-02-15| dead-url=yes |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is planned over a seven-year period that the station will gradually progress towards a full 24-hour programming schedule. The planned themed programming includes: Listening Comprehension, Story-Telling, Religious Education, Science, Language Arts, Social Studies, Mental Arithmetic, Spanish and Geography.

==History==
After a stay of 19 years in Austria, Dr. Abouleish returned to Egypt for a cultural trip in 1975. Touched by the deplorable economic and social situation of his country of origin, he decided to begin a project of cultural renewal on the basis of a synthesis of [[Islam]] and [[anthroposophy]]. Two years later he bought a plot of land in what was, at the time, desert bordering farmland of the Nile valley. The original goal was to develop the land and improve crop yields using biodynamic methods. A thick border of trees was planted to encircle the seventy hectares of land, and trees were planted along all the roads built; a forest was also planted on part of the land. (The initial planting included 120,000 casuarina, eucalyptus and Persian lilac seedlings.) The Bedouins who lived nearby, and sometimes on the land, were brought into the project, given work and helped with their living needs. Buildings were built using traditional adobe; some of these were designed by [[Hassan Fathy]]. The initial farm animals were [[List of Domestic Asian Water buffalo breeds|Egyptian buffalo]]. The organization sold milk products produced from the buffalo milk and produce from the farm.

The first large economic venture of the community initiative was production of a medicinal compound, [[ammoidin]], an extract of [[Ammi majus]] (Laceflower). The manufacture of herbal teas and a company to market fresh biodynamic produce in Europe followed. The needs of these companies led to many farms throughout Egypt switching to biodynamic methods; the SEKEM organization began an active advisory service to aid these farms in the transition to and the maintenance of biodynamic standards. Sekem leased many of these lands.

Community projects began early in the initiative's history: a medical clinic using [[anthroposophic medicine]], and a Society for Cultural Development sponsoring lectures, concerts and other cultural activities.

In 1987, the center for adult education (Mahad) began its work; children with handicaps are also educated in this center. In 1988, SEKEM opened a kindergarten also open to the local Bedouin community; this grew into the SEKEM school, educating children from kindergarten through twelfth grade (about 18 years of age) on the basis of [[Waldorf education]]. "The school serves Muslim and Christian children alike encouraging them to live in harmony and have respect for the other's religious practices."[http://www.sekem.com/School_n.html] The school also operates a literacy center for illiterate children between ten and fourteen years of age.

In response to the use of child labor in Egypt, SEKEM founded the project ''Chamomile Children", which offers children between ten and fourteen an education, vocational training, meals, and medical care in conjunction with their work; the children's teachers look after the children the whole day. There is also a cooperative for employees to organize the social processes (the Cooperative of SEKEM Employees), an independent organization with members from all the businesses and cultural institutions associated with SEKEM.

In 1990, SEKEM founded the [[Centre of Organic Agriculture in Egypt]] (COAE), an independent organization that inspects organic farms in Egypt, Iran and Sudan.

Faced with pesticide residues in their products that came from aerial spraying on nearby farms, SEKEM took up an initiative to eliminate such spraying in Egypt. As cotton production depended upon the sprays, SEKEM explored organic cotton production on initially small fields. The experiments were successful and yields actually were better than non-organic production achieved. The Egyptian Ministry of Agriculture sponsored further and more extensive tests. Within three years, the ministry agreed that organic pest suppression was superior for cotton farming and began converting the entire area of Egyptian cotton, 4,000 square kilometres, to organic methods for controlling pests; the conversion took two years. The conversion resulted in a reduction in the use of synthetic pesticides in Egypt by over 90% and an increase in the average yield of raw cotton of almost 30%.&lt;ref name="CSR"/&gt; SEKEM then created a company to process organic cotton using mechanical rather than chemical methods, NatureTex.

In response to increasing publicity about the novel methods employed by the community in many realms, the association of Muslim sheiks in Egypt gave the community a plaque verifying that SEKEM is an Islamic initiative. This was the result of intensive meetings between SEKEM and Muslim religious leaders.

SEKEM's next initiative was the first private pharmaceutical company in Egypt, specializing in medicinal teas. The medical center had now grown to the point where it needed its own building; concurrently it considerably expanded its outreach into the Bedouin community, helping establish sanitary facilities and clean water supplies.

In 1997, SEKEM established a vocational training center offering trainings in metalwork, carpentry, mechanical work, electrical work, tailoring, biodynamic farming and trading. The vocational center also includes an art school. The German Society for Technical Cooperation helped establish this project. In 1999 the SEKEM Academy (now Sekem University) opened. Originally a center for agricultural, pharmaceutical and medical research, the University now also conducts studies and offers training in other areas.

In 2001, a holding company was established to administer the finances of all the SEKEM companies and to oversee developmental projects. The holding company includes a department to help each individual company with its developmental process, and is also responsible for the education and training programs for employees.&lt;ref name="Abouleish"&gt;Abouleish, Ibrahim, ''SEKEM: A Sustainable Community in the Egyptian Desert'', {{ISBN|0-86315-532-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social connections==
All SEKEM companies have a policy of ensuring transparency in the production, distribution and consumption of their goods. They work to ensure fair and secure prices for the farmers supplying them, basing their operations on the principle that the health of the economy depends upon producers, distributors and consumers cooperating to generate stable businesses.&lt;ref name="CSR"/&gt; SEKEM hosts a monthly gathering of all farmers working together with it; about 200 farmers attended these sessions as of 2004. It has created the following [[NGO]]s:&lt;ref name="CSR"/&gt;
* A ''Cooperative of SEKEM Employees'' that works to ensure equality, equity and dignity for all employees. In particular, the cooperative supports employee training, career development and health care provisions. Ten percent of SEKEM employees' working time is available for professional and personal development through social and cultural enrichment activities.&lt;ref name=UNGC/&gt;
* The ''SEKEM Developmental Foundation'', with the goal of raising the quality of people's lives and supporting cultural and economic development in Egypt. The foundation provides education and literacy support for surrounding communities as well as programs for children with special needs. This includes a kindergarten, a "co-educational school with pupils from a diversity of cultural and social backgrounds, Muslim and Christian children learning together in a community where respect for all differences of gender, religion, class and ethnicity is cultivated", special education facilities and vocational trainings.&lt;ref name=UNGC&gt;[http://www.unglobalcompact.org%2Fsystem%2Fattachments%2F4124%2Foriginal%2FCOP.pdf%3F1262614948&amp;ei=aFtRTPjNK8H48AaQ1ZHmBA&amp;usg=AFQjCNFzcXgvIPfqcBK8pzH2-R76711VBA&amp;sig2=54wED8bbtrcaVfdoMWesQw UN Global Compact report]&lt;/ref&gt;
* An adult education center, ''MAHAD'', that offers professional trainings as well as continuing education programs in a variety of areas.&lt;ref name=UNGC/&gt;
* The ''Egyptian Biodynamic Association'', established in 1990 as a research and training center in [[biodynamic agriculture|biodynamic]] methods. Approximately 800 farmers are now farming biodynamically in Egypt.&lt;ref name="RLA"/&gt;

SEKEM and Dr. [[Ibrahim Abouleish]] received the [[Right Livelihood Award]] in 2003 for integrating the commercial success with promotion of the social and cultural development of society.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rightlivelihood.org/recip.htm ''Right Livelihood'' organization] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060715035256/http://www.rightlivelihood.org/recip.htm |date=2006-07-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization has been cited as a successful example of [[social entrepreneurship]] that has had a significant impact on Egyptian society both through its influence on the country's agricultural practices and through its educational and cultural institutions.&lt;ref&gt;Mair and Marti, [https://web.archive.org/web/20060822105932/http://www.usasbe.org/data/Documents/mair%20and%20marti.pdf "Social entrepreneurship research: A source of explanation, prediction, and delight"], Journal of World Business 41 (2006) p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldfuturecouncil.org/ibrahim_abouleish.html World Future Council] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070630190308/http://www.worldfuturecouncil.org/ibrahim_abouleish.html |date=2007-06-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Furthermore, Dr. [[Ibrahim Abouleish]] and his Son Helmy were named Social Entrepreneurs of the year 2003 by the [[Schwab Foundation for Social Entrepreneurship]], and Well known business schools like [[IESE]] and [[CIDA City Campus]] use various case studies (e.g. Harvard Business Press &lt;ref name="Harvard Business Press"&gt;[http://harvardbusinessonline.hbsp.harvard.edu/b02/en/common/item_detail.jhtml;jsessionid=5CJSMGABUPTF2AKRGWDR5VQBKE0YIISW?id=IES129&amp;referral=2341 Case Study published by Harvard Business School Publishing]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Power of Unreasonable People"&gt;[http://www.odemagazine.com/doc/51/in-praise-of-unreasonable-people The Power of Unreasonable People (Harvard Business School Press, 2008)]&lt;/ref&gt; to illustrate this novel approach to sustainable social entrepreneurship. Recent visitors included the first lady of Egypt, [[Suzanne Mubarak]], a group from the Full Bright Commission in Egypt,&lt;ref name="Full Bright Commission in Egypt"&gt;[http://www.fulbright-egypt.org/highlights/highlightslist.asp#b171 Full Bright Commission in Egypt] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081222183955/http://www.fulbright-egypt.org/highlights/highlightslist.asp |date=2008-12-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the former Federal Minister of the Interior of [[Germany]], [[Otto Schily]] and the founder of the [[Witten/Herdecke University]] Dr. [[Konrad Schily]] (a former member of the German [[Bundestag]]).

'''Senior Stick''' is a title used for the [[President]] or heads of [[student association]]s at [[University of Manitoba]]. No other known Canadian university that uses this title.{{sayswho|date=March 2016}} The term Senior Stick is also sometimes used to refer to the actual stick of office carried by a Senior Stick.

==Stick of Office==
[[Image:UMES Stick of Office.jpg|thumb|right|The sticks of office of the [[University of Manitoba Engineering Society]]]]
The stick of office is a [[staff of office]] carried by the Senior Stick as a symbol of their position.

While the styles of sticks of office vary greatly between student associations, they are typically composed of an elongated wooden rod, painted or stained dark, with a metal bottom cap and an ornamental metal top in either silver or gold.

== Senior Stick at the University of Manitoba ==

=== Faculty of Engineering ===
The University of Manitoba Engineering Society (UMES) has been electing a Senior Stick to serve as its head since 1909.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = History {{!}} University of Manitoba Engineering Society|url = http://umes.mb.ca/page/governance/history|website = umes.mb.ca|access-date = 2016-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Every spring at the annual UMES graduation ceremony the ceremonial passing of the Stick-of-Office takes place. During this ceremony the outgoing Senior Stick passes the newest Stick-of-Office to the incoming Senior Stick and whispers words of wisdom that have been passed down from Senior Stick to Senior Stick. These words are only known by the Senior Sticks and no one else. At the end of every year the name of the outgoing Senior Stick is added to the Stick-of-Office along with the year that they served as Senior Stick.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The tradition of having a Senior Stick as president of UMES was brought to the University of Manitoba by Professor E.E. Brydon-Jack who was named as the first professor of engineering at the University of Manitoba in 1906.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; After starting in engineering this tradition of having a Senior Stick quickly spread to all faculties at the University of Manitoba. There was insufficient funds for the creation of the first Stick-of-Office until 1927.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; At this point all the names of the previous Senior Sticks dating back to 1907 were added retroactively. In 1987 the first Stick-of-Office no longer had any room for additional names. A new Stick-of-Office was commissioned and the names of all the Senior Sticks since 1988 have been added to this Stick-of-Office instead.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Faculty of Arts ===
The Faculty of Arts followed the Faculty of Engineering and started electing a Senior Stick in 1915.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title = University of Manitoba - Libraries - Faculty of Arts fonds, Senior and Lady Stick Series|url = http://umanitoba.ca/libraries/units/archives/collections/rad/arts_stick.html|website = umanitoba.ca|access-date = 2016-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Faculty of Arts elected both a Senior Stick and a lady stick until 1974.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In 1975 the Faculty of Arts then decided to drop the position of lady stick and simply allow both male and female students to run for Senior Stick.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Board of Senior Sticks ===
At the University of Manitoba there are meetings that are called between all of the Senior Sticks. These meetings are called by the [[University of Manitoba Students' Union]]. These meetings are called Board Of Senior Stick or BOSS for short.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url =http://www.umsu.ca/sites/default/files/UMSU-Bylaw-Manual-2015-02.pdf|title =UMSU|date =|access-date =|website =UMSU|publisher =|last =|first =|deadurl =yes|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20160201235453/http://www.umsu.ca/sites/default/files/UMSU-Bylaw-Manual-2015-02.pdf|archivedate =2016-02-01|df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Solomon Schechter School of Manhattan''' is a K-8 [[Jewish day school]] located in [[Manhattan]], New York City. It is a member of the [[Solomon Schechter Day School Association| Schechter Day School Network]], affiliated with the Conservative Movement, and is the only Conservative day school in Manhattan. The school adheres to a progressive or constructivist educational philosophy, which espouses the value of experiential learning and self-reflection. 

==History==
The Schechter Manhattan school opened in 1996 with Dr. Steven C. Lorch as the founding Head of School.  The first eighth graders graduated in June 2006; alumni have gone on to a wide range of excellent independent, Jewish, and public high schools including but not limited to: Bard, Beacon, Dalton, Heschel, High School of Math, Science &amp; Engineering, Horace Mann, LaGuardia, Ramaz, SAR, [[Solomon Schechter School of Westchester]], Stuyvesant, and Trinity.

The elementary division (K-5) and the middle school division (6–8) are each led by a Division Head.

Schechter Manhattan is a member of both the Schechter Day School Network and the Independent Schools Association of Greater New York (ISAAGNY). Additionally, the school is a full member of [[New York State Association of Independent Schools]] (NYSAIS). The school is governed by a Board of Trustees and advised by both an Education Committee and a Rabbinic Advisory Committee.

In January 2011, the entire school moved into a new building at 805 Columbus Avenue. Prior to that time, the kindergarten and first grade classes met at the [[Park Avenue Synagogue]] and the rest of the school, grades 2–8, was located on the Upper West Side at 15 West 86th Street, in the building of the [[Society for the Advancement of Judaism]].

'''St. Alphonsus Rodriguez School''' (ESAR) (''Escola Santo Afonso Rodriguez'') is a [[Brazil]]ian school in [[Teresina]], [[Piauí]].

It was established by the [[Jesuits]] in 1963 and opened in 1965. It covers elementary through high school and includes technical courses.

==History and operations==
The school is located in the Socopo neighborhood on the east side of Teresina. The neighborhood consists of many underemployed people earning a minimum wage in the informal sector. Basic services are inadequate, in sanitation, education, health, and leisure, which inhibits the human development of the population.

School construction began in 1963 with the arrival of the Jesuits and it opened in 1965 with 105 students. Since this was a rural area, it began as an [[agricultural school]] but with urbanization it grew into an elementary school and high school, also offering courses in [[human resources]] and [[information technology]], to a combined 700 students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.esar.org.br/|title=Escola Santo Afonso Rodriguez - ESAR {{!}} Teresina, PI|website=Escola Santo Afonso Rodriguez - ESAR {{!}} Teresina, PI|language=pt-BR|access-date=2017-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The school offers courses in Computer Technician and Technician Human Relations School for high school students. Coursework in computer technology requires 320 hours of practical experience through an internship. Among the projects undertaken was developing a system for Teresina's [[Diocesan College (Teresina)|Diocesan College]] and for the Pedro Arrupe Social Center.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.diocesano.g12.br/noticias/noticias/alunos-da-escola-santo-afonso-rodriguez-desenvolvem-sistemas-para-o-colegio-diocesano-45082.html|title=Alunos da Escola Santo Afonso Rodriguez desenvolvem sistemas para o Colégio Diocesano - Notícias Colégio Diocesano Teresina,PI|website=Colégio Diocesano {{!}} Teresina, PI|language=pt-BR|access-date=2017-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Activities===
Among its outreach works, the parents and students held a bazaar to benefit education in [[Haiti]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://ignacianosporhaiti.org/pais/brasil/bazar-escola-santo-afonso-rodriguez/|title=Bazar Escola Santo Afonso Rodriguez (Brasil) - Ignacianos por Haiti|date=2015-06-30|work=Ignacianos por Haiti|access-date=2017-09-23|language=es-ES}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Steven Erikson''' (born October 7, 1959) is the pseudonym of '''Steve Rune Lundin''', a Canadian [[author|novelist]], who was educated and trained as both an [[archaeologist]] and [[anthropologist]].

He is best-known for his ten-volume spanning epic fantasy series ''[[Malazan Book of the Fallen]]'', which began with the publication of ''[[Gardens of the Moon]]'' (1999) and was completed with the publication of ''The Crippled God'' (2011). By 2012 over 1 million copies of the series had been sold worldwide&lt;ref&gt;Per the cover copy of the paperback edition of ''The Crippled God.''&lt;/ref&gt;, and over 3 million copies by 2018. ''SF Site'' has called the series "the most significant work of epic fantasy since Donaldson's Chronicles of [[Thomas Covenant]],"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfsite.com/08b/mt182.htm|title=The SF Site Featured Review: Midnight Tides|last=Thompson|first=William|year=2004|publisher=The SF Site|accessdate=2009-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Fantasy Book Review'' described it as "the best fantasy series of recent times."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=House of Chains by Steven Erikson |url=http://www.fantasybookreview.co.uk/Steven-Erikson/House-Of-Chains.html |year=2008 |work=Fantasy Book Review |publisher= Fantasybookreview.com |accessdate=August 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fellow author [[Glen Cook]] has called the series a masterwork, while [[Stephen R. Donaldson]] has praised him for his approach to the fantasy genre and has compared him to the likes of [[Joseph Conrad]], [[Henry James]], [[William Faulkner]], and [[Fyodor Dostoevsky]].

Set in the Malazan world, Erikson has written a prequel trilogy, ''[[The Kharkanas Trilogy]]'', six novellas, and is currently working on a sequel trilogy, ''The Witness Trilogy'', the first book of which, titled ''The God is Not Willing'', is expected to be published in 2019. 

His foray into ''[[Science Fiction]]'' has produced a comedic trilogy, the ''Willful Child Trilogy'', a spoof on ''[[Star Trek]]'' and other tropes common in the genre, and a [[First contact (science fiction)|First Contact]] novel titled ''Rejoice, a Knife To the Heart'', published in 2018.

==Life and career==
Erikson was born in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], and grew up in [[Winnipeg]].&lt;ref name="FBR_bio"&gt;{{cite web |title= Steven Erikson biography|url= http://www.fantasybookreview.co.uk/Steven-Erikson/biography.html|date= |work=Fantasy Book Review |publisher= Fantasybookreview.com|accessdate=August 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He subsequently lived in the UK with his wife and son, but has since returned to Winnipeg.&lt;ref name="FBR_bio"/&gt; He is an anthropologist and archaeologist by training and is a graduate of the [[Iowa Writers' Workshop]].&lt;ref name="meetse"&gt;{{cite web |title=Steven Erikson |url=http://us.macmillan.com/author/stevenerikson |year=2008 |work= |publisher= Macmillan|accessdate=July 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; For his thesis at the Iowa Writers' Workshop, Erikson wrote a "story cycle" of short stories titled ''A Ruin of Feathers'' about an archaeologist in Central America. Subsequently, he received a grant to finish the work which was published by TSAR, a small Canadian publishing house. For his next work he co-won the Anvil Press International 3-Day Novel Contest for which he signed away the rights, a mistake he attributes to inexperience. Erikson's third book was also published by TSAR, and consisted of a novella and short stories titled ''Revolvo and other Canadian Tales''. Later, upon moving to England, he sold what he refers to as his "first real novel" to Hodder and Stoughton — ''[[This River Awakens]]'' — written when he still lived in Winnipeg. Before assuming his pseudonym, Erikson published his first four books, currently out of print, under his real name.&lt;ref name ="Vandemeer"&gt;{{cite web |last=Vandermeer |first=Jeff |coauthors= |title=Steven Erikson: No Lies, No Holding Back|url=http://clarkesworldmagazine.com/erikson_interview/ |year=2008 |work= |publisher=Clarkesworld Magazine |accessdate=August 31, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to writing, he paints using oil paints.&lt;ref name ="Vandemeer"/&gt;

===''Malazan Book of the Fallen''===
{{main|Malazan Book of the Fallen}}

Erikson and [[Ian Cameron Esslemont|Esslemont]] initially devised the Malazan world as a backdrop for a table-top [[role-playing]] game.&lt;ref name=spot1&gt;{{cite web |title=On the spot at Bookspotcentral: Interview with Steven Erikson |url=http://www.bscreview.com/2008/06/on-the-spot-at-bookspotcentral-interview-steven-erikson |date= |work= |publisher= bookspotcentral.com|accessdate=July 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29EqmOpqVM0|title=Suvudu - Steven Erikson Reading and Q&amp;A (Part 6)|first=|last=Unbound Worlds|date=23 September 2008|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unhappy with the lack of quality adult oriented fantasy movies at the time, the duo decided to write their own movie script using their gaming experience and the world they had created. The script, titled ''Gardens of the Moon'', was deemed too risky and failed to sell. With interest in the script seeming nonexistent, Erikson, with Esslemont's go ahead, reworked it into a fantasy novel, which he completed around 1991–92.

After meeting almost a decade of rejection, the novel was finally sold to [[Transworld (company)|Transworld]], a division of [[Random House]]. The publisher was pleased with the work and requested Erikson write additional books in the series.&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/1999/oct/14/artsfeatures|title=Malazans and megabucks|last=Moss|first=Stephen|date=October 14, 1999|work=The Guardian|accessdate=2009-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using the history of the Malazan world Erikson plotted nine additional novels. After the publication of ''Gardens of the Moon'', reviews spread via the internet, and Orion publications attempted to lure Erikson away from Transworld. However, Transworld retained an option on additional novels in the series and offered £675,000 for the remaining nine books of the series.&lt;ref name="guardian" /&gt;

While there are many plotlines woven through the whole series, the main storyline focuses on a period in time where the Malazan Empire is facing resistance to their conquest of the world. When gods and ascendants come into play, everything that follows has repercussions for the whole world. The series was completed with the publication of ''[[The Crippled God]]'', the tenth novel in the series, in 2011.&lt;ref name="spanish"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://caballerodelarbolsonriente.blogspot.com/2017/12/steven-erikson-no-hay-nada-para.html|title=Steven Erikson: "There is nothing glorifying in war"|last=Garrido|first=Daniel|date=December 1, 2012|work=El Caballero del Arbols Onriente|accessdate=2018-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wert"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thewertzone.blogspot.com/2017/11/malazan-franchise-familiariser.html|title=Malazan Franchise Familiariser|last=Whitehead|first=Adam|date=November 11, 2017|work=The Wertzone|accessdate=2018-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Erikson's background as an archeologist and anthropologist also shaped how he crafted the story. His approach was to use as many perspectives and point of views as possible in terms of interpreting history, which without a doubt has given the Malazan world more layers and has created a sense of reality. He also drew inspiration from ''[[Homer]]'''s ''Illiad'', where gods constantly meddled into mortal affairs, adding the twist that it doesn't always workout as planned for the god, since even a lowly thief has the power to bring him down.&lt;ref name="French"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://justaword.fr/interview-steven-erikson-3d21dc6fff9f|title=Interview Steven Erikson: The Malazan Archaeologist - Imaginales festival in Épinal 2018|last=Winter |first=Nicolas |date=June 5, 2018|work=Just a Word - France|accessdate=2018-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Kharkanas Trilogy''===
{{main|The Kharkanas Trilogy}}

After the publication of the seventh novel in the ''[[Malazan Book of the Fallen]]'' series, ''[[Reapers Gale]]'', Erikson and his publisher reached an agreement for him to write two trilogies and novellas set in the Malazan world. This consequently led Erikson to the choose to write a prequel trilogy, titled the Kharkanas Trilogy, set almost three hundred thousand years before the events of the main series, elements of which he began introducing in ''[[Toll the Hounds]]'' and in ''[[The Crippled God]]''.

The series deals with numerous founding or elder races from the Malazan World, with the narrative anchored around the circumstances that would ultimately lead to the split of the Tiste race. It sheds light and demystifies the events that are often hinted at in the background of ''Malazan Book of the Fallen''. Primarily focusing on characters such as Anomander Rake, Draconus, Gothos, Krull and Hood, mainly through the eyes of secondary characters.

As of 2018, two novels have been published, ''[[Forge of Darkness]]'' (2012) and ''[[Fall of Light]]'' (2016), with the third taking a backseat to the first novel in the Witness trilogy. In a post on his official Facebook account, the author explained that the dismal sale figures for the previous novels and the creative toll employing the writing style used throughout the previous books was what had led to his decision to take a break from it in order to do it justice.&lt;ref name="Facebook Steven Erikson - Author"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/steveneriksonofficial/posts/942659669219667|title=and occasionally an exchange goes like this|work=Steven Erikson Social Media|accessdate=May 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Witness Trilogy''===
The second trilogy Erikson planned on writing centres around the popular Karsa Orlong character. This trilogy will be a sequel to the main series, set, according to the author, a decade after the main narrative.&lt;ref name="FHive"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fantasy-hive.co.uk/2018/11/interview-with-steven-erikson/|title=INTERVIEW WITH STEVEN ERIKSON|last=Thornton|first=Jonathan|date=November 1, 2018|work=Fantasy Hive|accessdate=2018-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first novel is titled ''The God is Not Willing'', which is set to be released in November, 2019.&lt;ref name="Podcast"&gt;{{cite episode | title = NOT A TSACAST - *Spoilers Malazan* - Fireside Conversations with Steven Erikson | url =https://soundcloud.com/tsa-cast/erikson_final | series =NOT A TSACAST | minutes =50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Tales of Bauchelain and Korbal Broach''===
Erikson wrote side stories centering on two necromancers and their butler, characters he introduced in ''[[Memories of Ice]]'', the third novel in the ''[[Malazan Book of the Fallen]]'' series. These side stories take place in the Malazan world, but have no connection to the series' overall plot. 

As of 2018, six novellas have been published, the first in 2002, titled ''[[Blood Follows]]'', and the latest in 2016, tilted ''The Fiends of Nightmaria''. In 2009, the first three novellas were collected and published together as ''The Tales of Bauchelain and Korbal Broach''. And in 2018, books four to six were collected and published together as ''The Second Collected Tales of Bauchelain &amp; Korbal Broach''.

Erikson, as per his agreement with his publisher, is expected to write three more novellas featuring these characters.&lt;ref name="spanish"/&gt;

===''Willful Child Trilogy''===
Erikson is a huge fan of the ''[[Star Trek]]'' series, especially the first iteration which he credits as being his gateway to [[Science Fiction]] in general. But he finds himself feeling disenfranchised by some of the later iterations, especially from ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation|The Next Generation]]'' onward. In an interview he goes into detail regarding this issue, concluding that among other things creative compromises were to blame for the dip in quality. But while criticizing the series' current state, he affirms that he nonetheless still is a fan.&lt;ref name="UW"&gt;{{cite web | title=INTERVIEWS - New Release Interview: Steven Erikson &amp; His WILLFUL CHILD | url=https://www.unboundworlds.com/2014/11/new-release-interview-steven-erikson-his-willful-child/ | work=Unbound Worlds| publisher=Unbound Worlds| accessdate=October 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
''Willful Child'', published in September, 2014, is Erikson's "response" to the overused tropes and caricature of ''[[Captain Kirk]]'' esque characters in science fiction, with the main character, Captain Hardrian, being the most recognizable reflection. While the novel is a spoof of science fiction in general, it is rife with often times poignant social commentary.&lt;ref name="CD"&gt;{{cite web | title=Review: Willful Child by Steven Erikson | url=https://thecriticaldragon.com/2015/12/01/review-willful-child-by-steven-erikson/ | work=The Critical Dragon Reviews| publisher=The Critical Dragon| accessdate=October 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Wrath of Betty'', the follow-up, was published in 2016.&lt;ref name="CD2"&gt;{{cite web | title=In the Dragon’s Den: Interview with Steven Erikson Part 3 | url=https://thecriticaldragon.com/2016/04/26/in-the-dragons-den-interview-with-steven-erikson-part-3/ | work=The Critical Dragon Reviews| publisher=The Critical Dragon| accessdate=October 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|-
|style="text"-align: left;"|— Steven Erikson&lt;ref name="Big Idea" /&gt;
|}
Having written a three million words spanning fantasy series and having dealt with all the tropes that came with it, Erikson feels desensitized by most works found in the genre, which is why he prefers reading Science Fiction.&lt;ref name="spanish"/&gt; For more than a decade, he has also had aspirations to write a First Contact science fiction novel. In 2017, UK based publisher ''[[Victor Gollancz Ltd|Gollancz]]'' revealed in a press release that they had acquired the right to this project, titled ''Rejoice, A Knife to the Heart''.&lt;ref name="Gollancz"&gt;{{cite web | title=Gollancz Acquire Steven Erikson’s Rejoice, A Knife to the Heart | url=https://www.gollancz.co.uk/2017/10/12/gollancz-acquire-steven-ericksons-rejoice-knife-heart/ | date=2017-10-12 | work=Gollancz | publisher=Gollancz| accessdate=October 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BB"&gt;{{cite web | title=Gollancz signs Steven Erikson SF Novel | url=

Similar to his fantasy work, Erikson revealed that he would be playing with and overturning the conventions and dismantling a few tropes. It was his opinion that far too often the invading aliens would seek contact with an authority figure, someone in power. His goal was to flip that by asking what would happen if the aliens made contact with someone completely opposite.&lt;ref name="Big Idea"/&gt;

The novel was released on October 16, 2018, and was received with critical acclaim, with science fiction author Robert Sawyer praising its concept and its execution.&lt;ref name="Amazon3"&gt;{{cite web | title=Rejoice, A Knife to the Heart Steven Erikson | url=https://www.fantasticfiction.com/e/steven-erikson/rejoice.htm | work=Fantastic Fiction| publisher=Fantastic Fiction.| accessdate=October 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Amazon4"&gt;{{cite web | title=Rejoice, A Knife to the Heart Steven Erikson | url=https://www.amazon.com/Rejoice-Knife-Heart-Steven-Erikson/dp/1773740121/ | work=Amazon Catalogue Books| publisher=Amazon, INC.| accessdate=October 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Themes===
Erikson has stated that apart from examining the "human condition", all his literary work share "compassion" as a theme, or main driving force.&lt;ref name="FHive" /&gt;
Furthermore, when envisioning the Malazan world, both Esslemont and he agreed to create societies and cultures that never knew sexism and gender based hierarchies of power.&lt;ref name="Lunna"&gt;{{cite episode | title = Steven Erikson - Le livre des martyrs : Volume 1, Les jardins de la lune | url =https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PglugQjKsi0 | series =Mollat | minutes =2:40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other themes include social inequality, egalitarianism, death, life, history, historical accuracy .&lt;ref name="Tor15"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.tor.com/2018/10/22/diversity-and-equality-are-foundational-concepts-in-malazan-book-of-the-fallen/|title=Diversity and Equality Are Foundational Concepts in Malazan Book of the Fallen|work=Tor|accessdate=October 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TQ"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thequilltolive.com/2018/07/13/why-you-should-read-malazan-part-5-the-themes/|title=Why You Should Read Malazan – Part 5: The Themes|work=The Quill To Live|accessdate=October 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Spec"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://speculiction.blogspot.com/2011/11/slow-exhale-consistency-of-malazan-book.html|title=A Slow Exhale: The Consistency of Malazan Book of the Fallen|work=Speculiction|accessdate=October 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tor0"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.tor.com/2016/09/06/14-reasons-to-read-steven-eriksons-gardens-of-the-moon/|title=14 Reasons to Read Steven Erikson’s Gardens of the Moon|work=Tor|accessdate=October 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Med"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://medium.com/inner-worlds/inner-worlds-ii-steven-erikson-the-author-of-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-8c1094ee7fed|title=Inner Worlds II: Steven Erikson, the author of The Malazan Book of the Fallen - On fantasy, bias, and telling a story|work=Medium|accessdate=October 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Style===
Erikson has stated explicitly that he enjoys playing with and overturning the conventions of fantasy, presenting characters that violate the stereotypes associated with their roles. They embody the multidimensional characteristics found in human beings, making them more realistic and giving the story more depth, which is why his books are anything but predictable. He deliberately began ''Gardens of the Moon'' mid-plot rather than beginning with a more conventional narrative.&lt;ref name="sffw-interview"&gt;{{cite web |title=Interview with Steven Erikson |url=http://www.sffworld.com/2006/01/scifiint_165/? |date=January 21, 2006 |work= |publisher=SFFWorld.com |accessdate=July 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=spot1/&gt; Erikson's style of writing includes complex plots with masses of characters. In addition, Erikson has been praised for his willingness to kill central characters when it enhances the plot.&lt;ref name ="FBR_bio"/&gt;

===Reception===
{|class="toccolours" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 2em; font-size: 85%; background:#F6F5F5; color:black; width:25em; max-width: 25%;" cellspacing="5"
|style="text-align: left;"|Word of mouth is very powerful in fantasy, and the net carries its own energy. It made a huge difference – people were picking [Gardens of the Moon] up from Amsterdam to the US.
|-
|style="text"-align: left;"|— Steven Erikson&lt;ref name="guardian" /&gt;
|}

Erikson's first novel of the ''[[Malazan Book of the Fallen]]'' series, ''[[Gardens of the Moon]]'' (1999), was well received. It was short-listed for a [[World Fantasy Award]]&lt;ref name="transworld"&gt;{{cite web |title=Steven Erikson |url=http://www.booksattransworld.co.uk/stevenerikson/home.htm |date= |work= |publisher=booksattransworld |accessdate=July 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also earned him the reputation as one of the best authors in the fantasy genre,&lt;ref name ="transworld"/&gt; and was described as "An astounding début".&lt;ref name="twbooks" &gt;{{cite web |title=Steven Erikson |url=http://www.twbooks.co.uk/authors/stevenerikson.html |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=July 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The novel was acclaimed for its "combination of originality and intelligent, strong and exciting storytelling".&lt;ref name="transworld" /&gt; The second book in the series, ''[[Deadhouse Gates]]'' (2000), was voted one of the ten best fantasy novels of 2000 by ''SF Site''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.sfsite.com/columns/best01.htm | title = Top ten books of 2000 | publisher = [[SF Site]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fellow author [[Glen Cook]] has called the series a masterwork of the imagination that may be the high water mark of the epic fantasy genre. In his treatise written for ''[[The New York Review of Science Fiction]]'', fellow author [[Stephen R. Donaldson]] has also praised Erikson for his approach to the fantasy genre, the subversion of classical tropes, the complex characterizations, the social commentary — pointing explicitly to parallels between the fictional Letheras Economy and the US Economy — and has referred to him as "an extraordinary writer", comparing him to the likes of [[Joseph Conrad]], [[Henry James]], [[William Faulkner]], and [[Fyodor Dostoevsky]].&lt;ref name="twbooks"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Author1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nyrsf.com/2015/03/fantasy-is-the-most-intelligent-precise-and-accurate-means-of-arriving-at-the-truth-s-p.html|title=Stephen R.

==Influences==
Erikson attributes paper and pen Role-Playing games, specifically AD&amp;D and GURP, as being the biggest influence in his writing career, and even calls it the fundament the Malazan Empire, from his ''[[Malazan Book of the Fallen]]'' series, is based on. [[Stephen_R._Donaldson|Stephen R. Donaldson's]], [[The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant]] and [[Glen Cook|Glenn Cook's]] [[The Black Company]], both ushering post-Tolkien style of writing, are among some of the works that have influenced his storytelling. He also credits the works of [[Robert E. Howard]], [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]], [[Homer]], [[Arthur C. Clarke]], [[Roger Zelazny]], [[John Gardner (American writer)|John Gardner]], [[Gustav Hasford]], [[Mark Helprin]] and [[Robin Hobb]] as some of the influences he used in the Malazan works.&lt;ref name ="Erikson"&gt;{{cite web |last=Erikson |first=Steven|coauthors= |title=The World of the Malazan Empire and Role-Playing Games |url=http://www.steven-erikson.com/index.php/the-world-of-the-malazan-empire-and-role-playing-games/ |accessdate=October 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FBR_bio"/&gt;

'''Stop the New Sex-Ed Agenda''' is a minor [[social conservative]] provincial political party in [[Ontario]], Canada. It was founded by Queenie Yu, who also serves as its leader.&lt;ref name="ElectionsON"/&gt; It is a [[single issue party]] with a platform based on being in opposition to the updated [[sexual education]] curriculum for Ontario public schools implemented in 2015. Yu has stated on multiple occasions that the goal of the party is not to win seats, but rather to encourage others to oppose the curriculum.&lt;ref name="iPolitics"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NFR"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Werner|first1=Kevin|title=Niagara West-Glanbrook candidate wants to “expose” Tory leader Patrick Brown’s sex-education policy|url=https://www.cambridgetimes.ca/news-story/6946267-niagara-west-glanbrook-candidate-wants-to-expose-tory-leader-patrick-brown-s-sex-education-policy/|accessdate=23 May 2018|work=CambridgeTimes.ca|agency=Stoney Creek News|date=3 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Prior to the foundation of the party, Queenie Yu ran as an independent candidate in the September 1, 2016 byelection in [[Scarborough—Rouge River (provincial electoral district)|Scarborough—Rouge River]],&lt;ref name="iPolitics"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cruickhshank|first1=Annie|title=Sex-ed opponents plan to split conservative vote in Ottawa-Vanier|url=https://ipolitics.ca/2016/11/04/sex-ed-opponents-plan-to-split-conservative-vote-in-ottawa-vanier/|accessdate=23 May 2018|work=iPolitics|date=4 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; coming in fourth with 582 votes.

Yu and other protesters opposed to the Ontario government's [[Kathleen Wynne#Education|February 2015 update]] of the Ontario sex education [[Education in Ontario|curriculum]] founded the party in October 2016.&lt;ref name="Global News"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jones|first1=Allison|title=Anti-sex-ed curriculum activists form new political party in Ontario|url=https://globalnews.ca/news/3045263/anti-sex-ed-curriculum-activists-form-new-political-party-in-ontario/|accessdate=23 May 2018|work=Global News|agency=The Canadian Press|date=3 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It ran one candidate each in the 2016 by-elections in [[Ottawa—Vanier (provincial electoral district)|Ottawa—Vanier]]&lt;ref name="iPolitics"/&gt; and [[Niagara West—Glanbrook (provincial electoral district)|Niagara West—Glanbrook]].&lt;ref name="NFR"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fraser|first1=Don|title=By-election candidates open up in Lincoln|url=https://www.niagarafallsreview.ca/news-story/8191333-by-election-candidates-open-up-in-lincoln/|accessdate=23 May 2018|work=Niagara Falls Review|date=7 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[2018 Ontario general election]], the party ran a total of three candidates, none of which won their seats.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21631">The traditional [[MBA]] degree (Masters in Business Administration) requires coursework and other study of business from a primarily [[Finance|financial]] standpoint, with some attention to management of people, to conventional economic theory, and to [[business ethics]]. A '''sustainable MBA''' program includes these subjects, and also study of managing for environmental and social [[sustainability]]. These programs are sometimes called "green MBAs".

==Conceptual foundation==

[[Sustainability]] in these programs is generally defined to include economic, environmental, and social sustainability, collectively known as the [[Triple Bottom Line]]. For each of these domains, sustainability means that it will be possible to continue through the foreseeable future, at least, without major breakdowns, such as

* Economic: running out of oil or other natural resources and having nothing to replace them on the scale required
* Environmental: loss of habitat, species, and whole ecologies; [[global warming]]
* Social: [[Overpopulation (biology)|overpopulation]] beyond the carrying capacity of the earth; consequences of eliminating poverty within the current economic model

The [[social environment|environmental]] and [[social justice]] movements are sources for many of the issues, arguments, and research on sustainability, but the idea has firm roots in [[classical economics]].

* [[Externalities]]: economically significant effects of manufacturing and trade on those who are not part of the industry or market in question. The classic example of a negative externality is [[pollution]], while the largest current issue is [[global warming]]. The literature has identified many others, and many positive externalities, and has proposed many controversial measures to improve the balance.
* Natural resources: conventional [[accounting]], including national accounts, treats extraction of finite natural resources as income, priced at the cost of extraction, and not as depletion of non-renewable [[natural capital]]. The resources of nature come to us for free. They are of infinite value from the point of view of preserving and sustaining life, but may not be subject to trading in a market, as in the case of air for breathing, for agriculture, or for burning fuels.
* The problem of [[value (economics)|value]]: conventional economics can describe the process of setting prices in a marketplace through the interaction of [[supply and demand]], but cannot adequately explain value. (Though not for lack of trying. See [[Labor Theory of Value]] and [[Util]] for examples.) The most economists generally agree on is that an individual purchaser in a free market will only buy something worth more to that individual than the price, and that the seller values the goods less than the price, so that both sides come out ahead.
* Participation: The [[free market]] is not free to those who have no access to it.

One of the themes of sustainable MBA education is the extent to which environmental and social sustainability can be achieved at a profit, a question by no means answered fully.

Sustainability MBA programs can vary significantly from one school to another, some may stress management, some may stress entrepreneurship, others simply add a few "green" classes to their existing MBA program.  Many advise to look at a program's curriculum, history, vision, mission, and most of all, to go and attend a class before fully enrolling in a program, as transparency is espoused as core to a sustainable MBA.

The longest running fully integrated sustainability graduate school (founded 2003) is [[Presidio Graduate School]] with MBA programs in San Francisco and Seattle.

==Sustainable MBA rankings==
As interest in sustainability within MBA programs has increased, so has an interest on assessing their quality and different approaches. ''[[Beyond Grey Pinstripes]]'', a biennial ranking and program survey, published by the [[Aspen Institute]] is based on the integration of social, environmental, and ethical stewardship into university curriculum and faculty research. The ranking also weights significantly the extent to which students are exposed to these topics throughout their studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beyondgreypinstripes.org/about/methodology.cfm|title=Methodology|accessdate=2011-06-18|publisher=Beyond Grey Pinstripes|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718165449/http://beyondgreypinstripes.org/about/methodology.cfm|archive-date=2011-07-18|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Participation in the survey requires US-based schools possess accreditation; international schools must also be accredited or be recognized as leading institutions. The 2009-2010 cycle consisted of 149 participating universities. The top-ranked school with a specialization in sustainability, Schulich, is Canadian.  63% of these schools were based in the US, while the remaining 37% were located throughout 24 countries. Although survey information from all participating schools is made available online, the top participating schools were ranked in the ''Aspen's Global 100'' list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aspen's Global 100|url=http://www.beyondgreypinstripes.org/pdf/2009-2010BGP_Brochure.pdf|publisher=Aspen Institute Center for Business Education|accessdate=26 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 2011-2012 survey and ranking again include data from 149 universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Samuelson|first=Judy|title=The Business of Education: Why change-minded MBA candidates turn to the Institute before they pick a business school.|journal=The Aspen Idea|date=Summer 2011|pages=66–67|url=http://www.aspencbe.org/documents/AspenIdea_Pinstripes.Summer%202011_p66-67.pdf|accessdate=18 July 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110712011811/http://www.aspencbe.org/documents/AspenIdea_Pinstripes.Summer%202011_p66-67.pdf|archivedate=12 July 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although not a ranking of business programs, [[Net Impact]] annually produces and publishes a graduate program guide titled ''Business as UNusual''. The guide seeks to provide information about what graduate programs offer their students within the realm of corporate responsibility and sustainability. Data for the guide come from surveys completed by graduate student Net Impact chapter leaders and from chapter member surveys. The most recent report contains profiles of 95 business schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Business as UNusual: The Student Guide to Graduate Programs 2010|url=http://www.netimpact.org/associations/4342/files/2010_Business_as_UNusual_Guide.pdf|publisher=Net Impact|accessdate=26 July 2011}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many MBA programs which offer sustainability degrees or concentrations also appear in general business school rankings. ''[[US News &amp; World Report]]'', ''[[Business Week]]'', ''[[Financial Times]]'', ''[[The Economist]]'', and the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' all publish [[business school rankings|rankings]] of selected MBA programs. While the methodologies of each differ, most weight ranks heavily by employment and salary statistics, standardized test scores, and surveys of corporate recruiters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/usnews/edu/grad/rankings/about/08biz_meth_brief.php|title=Business Methodology|accessdate=2007-12-18|publisher=U.S.News &amp; World Report.

==Criticism==

Followers of [[Milton Friedman]] and the [[Chicago school of economics]] often claim that business has no other duty than profits to shareholders, and that business therefore has a duty not to pursue environmental and social sustainability except where it increases profits. The extent to which such actions are profitable is much disputed. On the other hand, Friedman actually did not say&lt;ref&gt;Milton Friedman, [[Capitalism and Freedom]]: "There is one and only one social responsibility of business—to use its resources and engage in activities designed to increase its profits so long as it stays within the rules of the game, which is to say, engages in open and free competition without deception or fraud."&lt;/ref&gt; that the duty to shareholders was absolute: corporations also had a duty to obey the law and compete fairly. Friedman's criticism has been debunked by legal scholars (e.g., Stout 2002), who have shown that Friedman had no legal basis for his conclusion.  Corporate executives do not legally need to run the corporation for shareholders and could, in fact, operate the corporation to benefit society and environment.  The fact that Friedman misunderstood corporate governance is no surprise as it was not his area of expertise, and the fact that the NYT Magazine allowed the mistake is not a surprise as it is not a double blind peer reviewed academic journal.

The debate must then turn to the question of what laws may properly be placed on corporate behavior to prevent fraud and other forms of malfeasance, and to ensure open and free competition, with what enforcement mechanisms. Also, whether corporate lobbying for subsidies and other legally-mandated advantages is fair, given that it is economically inefficient and indeed harmful. This question turns in part on the honesty and effectiveness of governments, where results are decidedly mixed. It also turns in part on the honesty and effectiveness of public pressure groups. Results there are also decidedly mixed.

Criticism of sustainable or "green MBAs" has also been heard from environmentalists and social activists. Some complain of corporate [[greenwashing]], that is, of companies pretending to be sustainable or green by hiring graduates of these programs when the companies really are not.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thinktosustain.com/greenzone/2011/04/green-dialogues-with-giselle-weybrecht-author-the-sustainable-mba/ ThinktoSustain.com Interviews Giselle Weybrecht, Author of "The Sustainable MBA"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111024190353/http://thinktosustain.com/greenzone/2011/04/green-dialogues-with-giselle-weybrecht-author-the-sustainable-mba/ |date=2011-10-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some complain that the programs themselves are not sustainable enough, pointing to weaknesses in their curriculum and core proposition.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}

Another criticism relates to the sustainability skills gap. A recent [http://www.edie.net/downloads/Preparing-for-the-perfect-storm--Skills-for-a-sustainable-economy/56 study] shows that business schools are too slow to adjust  and the skills gap is broadening, regardless the recent surge of sustainable MBA programs. The report states that "environment and sustainability skills will be essential to plan the adaptations needed to survive and stay competitive", businesses unfortunately are ill prepared for these growing challenges and business schools are failing to offer enough environmental and ecological education, despite the increasing demand from businesses. In line with the IEMA report, [https://www.see.leeds.ac.uk/blog/put-sustainability-first-for-innovative-business-education/ several academics] also criticize business schools emphasizing that the gap will be finally closed by those programs with sustainability at the core, which in most cases are emerging outside the business school world.

The '''Taman Siswa''' (literally "Garden of Students" or "Students' Garden") was a Javanese educational movement in the [[Dutch East Indies]], founded in July 1922 by [[Ki Hadjar Dewantara]] (1889–1959), who was born as [[Raden Mas]] Soewardi Soerjaningrat, a Javanese nobleman.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9577">A '''teaching fellow''' (sometimes referred to as a '''TF''') is an individual at a higher education institution, including [[university|universities]], whose role involves teaching and potentially [[pedagogy|pedagogic research]]. The work done by teaching fellows can vary enormously from institution to institution, depending on the requirements and position of individual institutions.&lt;ref name="RSC Teaching Fellows Meeting"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.open.ac.uk/about/teaching-and-learning/esteem/news/view-lively-first-rsc-teaching-fellows-meeting|title=A view of a lively first RSC Teaching Fellows Meeting|accessdate=7 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United Kingdom and Ireland==

In the [[UK]] and [[Ireland]], teaching fellows are typically full members of [[Academia#Academic personnel|academic staff]] who are involved in teaching. Teaching fellows can undertake the full range of teaching, pastoral and administrative duties, and can also be involved in research activity, specifically [[pedagogy|pedagogic research]]. Their responsibilities can include developing innovative learning materials, mentoring colleagues and contributing to staff development activities, shaping the faculty's and the university's agenda in learning and teaching and spreading good practice in learning, teaching and assessment.&lt;ref name="Teacher Fellow Network"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.leedsbeckett.ac.uk/teacherfellows/|title=Teacher Fellows|accessdate=7 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other UK institutions may use the title of teaching fellow as an additional accolade, awarded to a member of academic staff who has shown excellence in teaching.

Teaching fellows may have the same rank and pay as 'traditional' research-active academic staff, although this depends on the attitude of the individual department and the institution. The equivalence in rank and status is relatively new in some institutions, since teaching fellows in the past were sometimes paid at a grade lower than their research-active colleagues.

Teaching fellows are present at a number of institutions across the UK. Institutions such as [[University College London|UCL]] as well as [[Robert Gordon University|The Robert Gordon University]] in Aberdeen and the universities of [[University of Aberdeen|Aberdeen]], [[University of Stirling|Stirling]], [[University of Bristol|Bristol]] and [[University of Manchester|Manchester]] all employ academics known as teaching fellows. Thus, a senior teaching fellow may have the same salary, status and teaching responsibilities as a senior lecturer. Teaching fellows in institutions such as the University of Aberdeen may also potentially reach the rank of professor.

The [[University of Reading]] runs a University Teaching Fellowship scheme that was launched in 2007/8.&lt;ref name="University of Reading University Teaching Fellowship scheme."&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reading.ac.uk/cqsd/CommunitiesandNetworks/cqsd-UniversityTeachingFellowsList.aspx|title=University Teaching Fellows|accessdate=7 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scheme is open to academic and support staff across the university and it has awarded so far 21 University and 11 Early Career Teaching Fellowships since it was launched. The criteria for the scheme is consistent with the [[Higher Education Academy]]'s [https://www.heacademy.ac.uk/professional-recognition/awards/national-teaching-fellowship-scheme-ntfs National Teaching Fellowship Scheme] (NTFS).

===National Teaching Fellowship Scheme===

The [[National Teaching Fellowship]] Scheme recognises and rewards individual excellence in teaching in higher education in the UK and supports individuals' professional development in learning and teaching.&lt;ref name="National Teaching Fellowship Scheme"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.heacademy.ac.uk/professional-recognition/awards/national-teaching-fellowship-scheme-ntfs|title=National Teaching Fellowship Scheme (NTFS)|accessdate=7 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The National Teaching Fellows (NTFs) are an active community, currently consisting of 643 NTFs from more than 40 disciplines.&lt;ref name="National Teaching Fellowship Scheme" /&gt;

The Association of National Teaching Fellows (ANTF) promotes innovation and supports the sharing of best practice.&lt;ref name="Association of National Teaching Fellows (ANTF)"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.heacademy.ac.uk/professional-recognition/awards/national-teaching-fellowship-scheme-ntfs/support-and-networking/an-0|title=Association of National Teaching Fellows (ANTF)|accessdate=7 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; National Teaching Fellows automatically become a member of the ANTF.&lt;ref name="Association of National Teaching Fellows (ANTF)" /&gt; The Committee of the Association of the National Teaching Fellows (CANTF) organises the ANTF's work and is the official voice of the association.&lt;ref name="Committee of the Association of National Teaching Fellows (CANTF)"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.heacademy.ac.uk/professional-recognition/awards/national-teaching-fellowship-scheme-ntfs/support-and-networking/antf|title=Committee of the Association of National Teaching Fellows (CANTF)|accessdate=7 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==
In the U.S. a teaching fellow is an advanced [[graduate student]] who serves as the primary instructor for an undergraduate course. Known as teaching fellows at many universities, such as [[Harvard University]], [[Boston College]] and [[Boston University]], they are also referred to as 'graduate student instructors' (GSIs) at some other universities, such as the [[University of Michigan]] and the [[University of California]] system. Typically, TFs teach courses in their area of research specialty, in which they hold a [[master's degree]] or equivalent. Teaching fellows differ from [[teaching assistant]]s in that they are responsible for all aspects of the course, including lecture, whereas TAs ''assist'' the instructor by performing ancillary course-related tasks such as grading and holding discussion section or laboratory. Many (about two-thirds) of the graduate students who have served as TAs serve as a TF for one or more classes each semester.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Butler| first=D.D.| author2=J.F. Laumer Jr. |author3=M. Moore| lastauthoramp=y| year=1993| title=A content analysis of pedagogical and policy information used in training graduate teaching assistants| journal=Journal for Higher Education Management |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=27–37}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Gray| first=P.L.|author2=N. Buerkel-Rothfuss | year=1991| chapter=Teaching assistant training: A view from the trenches| editor=J. D. Nyquist |editor2=R. D. Abbott |editor3=D. H. Wulff |editor4=J. Sprague | title=Preparing the professorate of tomorrow to teach| pages=40–51| location=Dubuque, Iowa| publisher=Kendall/Hunt}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although TFs are fairly autonomous in their duties, many universities, such as the [[University of Pittsburgh]], require supervision of TFs by [[professors]] experienced in teaching the course content, with whom TFs must hold regular meetings and receive feedback about the quality of their teaching. As a general rule, TFs receive a higher [[stipend]] than TAs in accordance with the greater responsibility and time commitment of a teaching fellowship, but like TAs, their contracts are renewed on a semester-by-semester basis, and they cannot be granted [[tenure]].

===Teaching associate===
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2006}}
A '''teaching associate''' is an academically qualified and registered [[graduate student]], usually in full-time residence, employed temporarily to teach [[freshman]]- and [[wiktionary:sophomore|sophomore]]-level courses (or occasionally more advanced [[undergraduate]] courses) in an [[United States|American]] [[university]]. They are an advanced form of graduate [[teaching assistant]], normally doctoral students, and are paid better than teaching assistants.

==India==
To tackle faculty shortage in the university departments, [[Anna University]] recruits postgraduates on contract basis and allow them to complete their doctoral degrees on the job. Candidates are shortlisted through a written test and an interview. Candidates are given the opportunity to pursue their PhD in the university departments simultaneously as they teach. Technically they are employed only for six months, but contracts get renewed through the years, they do almost the same job as regular staff, but receive what has been described as an "abysmally low" salary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Anna University to recruit PGs as teachers|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/education/news/Anna-University-to-recruit-PGs-as-teachers/articleshow/17013003.cms|work=The Times of India|date=30 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Temporary trouble|url=http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/tamil-nadu/2017/apr/15/temporary-trouble-1593802--1.html|work=The New Indian Express|date=15 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Big Bang UK Young Scientists and Engineers Fair''' is the United Kingdom’s largest celebration of [[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|STEM]] (science, technology, engineering and maths) for young people, and is the largest youth event in the [[UK]]. The fair takes place annually in March. It is led by [[EngineeringUK]] in partnership with over 200 organisations across government, industry, education and the wider science and engineering community.

The Big Bang programme exists to bring science and engineering to life for young people. The Big Bang celebrates and raises the profile of young people’s achievements in science and engineering and encourages more young people to take part in science, technology, engineering and maths initiatives with support from their parents and teachers.

Big Bang Near Me events take place across the UK to enable young people to discover close to home the exciting and rewarding science and engineering careers that their science and maths subjects can lead to.

In 2012, the Big Bang Fair was hosted in the [[National Exhibition Centre]] in Birmingham. An all-girls team of pupils from a state school in the Highlands- Alness Academy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tes.co.uk/article.aspx?storycode=6243101 |title=Ace of clubs is on shaky ground |first=Jean |last=McLeish |website=Tes.co.uk |date=2012-06-01 |accessdate=2016-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; were awarded the prestigious title of UK Young Engineers of the Year for their work on health and safety prototypes to be used in Haiti, which had recently suffered major earthquake damage alongside an outbreak of cholera. The six girls were Josie Tolliday, Emma Roddick, Cassie Armstrong, Meg Beattie, Holly Henderson and Kayleigh MacDonald.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.highland.gov.uk/news/article/6010/alness_academy_team_becomes_young_engineers_club_of_the_year_2012 |title=Alness Academy team becomes Young Engineers Club of the Year 2012 |website=Highland.gov.uk |date=2012-03-19 |accessdate=2016-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The all-girl team have continued to excel in their extra-curricular activities. Cassie Armstrong is now an elected Member of Scottish Youth Parliament; Emma Roddick went on to become Donald Dewar Debater of the Year;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://speakupscotland.squarespace.com/storage/Programme%20for%20Big%20Balloon%20Debate%20Final.pdf |format=PDF |title=Big Balloon Debate Final |website=Speakupscotland.squarespace.com |date=2012-03-30 |accessdate=2016-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kayleigh MacDonald has been successful in dance competition Rock Challenge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ross-shirejournal.co.uk/News/Alness-pupils-rock-judges-with-their-dance-moves-22022012.htm |title=Alness pupils rock judges with their dance moves |publisher=Ross-shire Journal |date=2012-02-24 |accessdate=2016-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
The Big Bang Fair has been criticised by NGOs such as the Campaign Against the Arms Trade&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.caat.org.uk/campaigns/arms-trade-out/science/big-bang-fair|title=CAAT - Campaigns - Arms Trade Out! - Science - Big Bang Fair|website=Campaign Against Arms Trade|access-date=2016-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Friends of the Earth due to the heavy involvement of arms manufacturers and fossil fuel companies at the event. The event has also been described as being led by the PR of companies rather than education, and for presenting a "distorted view of the value of science" in reference to the involvement of arms manufacturers and oil companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/political-science/2013/mar/18/science-policy1|title=The Big Bang Fair: a depressing vision of science and engineering|last=Bell|first=Alice|date=2013-03-18|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=2016-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/political-science/2014/mar/26/the-big-bang-fair-puts-pr-above-education|title=The Big Bang Fair puts PR above education|last=Bell|first=Alice|date=2014-03-26|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=2016-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.themanufacturer.com/articles/big-bang-fair-kicks-off-today-with-thousands-of-students-expected/|title=Big Bang Fair kicks off today with thousands of students expected|last=Brown|first=Tim|date=2014-03-13|work=The Manufacturer|access-date=2018-01-05|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''School of Chemistry''' is a constituent body of the [[Sydney Faculty of Science|Faculty of Science]] at the [[University of Sydney]], [[Australia]].

Two [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry|Nobel Laureates]] are associated with the School: [[John Cornforth]] completed his undergraduate degree in the School, graduating in 1938 with First Class Honours and the University Medal; and [[Robert Robinson (organic chemist)|Robert Robinson]] was appointed as the first Professor of Pure and Applied Organic Chemistry at the University in 1912.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chem.usyd.edu.au/aboutus/laureates.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Liquid_Nitrogen_Tank.JPG|thumb|right|Liquid nitrogen tank outside the Chemistry Building]]

The Chemistry Building, which is the School's main building, is notable in architectural history as one of the first structures in Australia with a [[curtain wall (architecture)|curtain wall]]. The building was completed in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chem.usyd.edu.au/aboutus/aboutusattachments/ChemistryBuildingJME.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The Venture Café was originally conceived as a restaurant located in the CIC in Boston, Massachusetts.&lt;ref name="bostonglobe-hottest"&gt;{{cite web |title=How a failed restaurant became Cambridge’s hottest Thursday spot|work=Boston Globe |url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2018/06/21/this-could-hottest-place-town-thursday-night-and-beer-free/so61lJpjP7HcZLXTCEGvcK/story.html|first=Scott|last=Kirsner|date= 21 June 2018|accessdate=24 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The restaurant failed to attract investment and was reimagined as a gathering for the entrepreneurial community based on the book Venture Café by Teresa Esser.&lt;ref name="venture-name"&gt;{{cite web |title=Venture Café’s mission is connecting innovators to make things happen.|work=Venture Cafe Official Website |url=http://venturecafeglobal.org/about/|date= 24 August 2018 |accessdate=24 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Venture Café Kendall launched in 2009 bringing together hundreds of entrepreneurs each week for the flagship program, the Thursday Gathering. 

== Venture Café St. Louis ==

In 2014, Venture Café expanded to the [[Cortex Innovation Community]] in [[St. Louis]], Missouri, to bring together the emerging startup community.&lt;ref name="stltoday-cambridge"&gt;{{cite web |title=Cambridge Innovation Center opens at Cortex|work=St. Louis Post Dispatch |url=https://www.stltoday.com/business/columns/building-blocks/cambridge-innovation-center-opens-at-cortex/article_202c0df4-dbbb-567e-aec8-32ee0a9eff35.html|first=Tim|last=Bryant|date= Sep 29, 2014 |accessdate=24 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The success of the St. Louis location prompted the launch of Venture Cafés in other cities and ultimately the creation of Venture Café Global Institute, a public benefit corporation based in both St. Louis and Boston.&lt;ref name="silicon-venture"&gt;{{cite web |title=T-REX and Venture Cafe STL are changing St. Louis’ startup landscape|work=Silicon Prairie News |url=http://siliconprairienews.com/2018/03/t-rex-venture-cafe-changing-st-louis-startup-landscape/|first=Christine|last=McGuigan|date=2 March 2018 |accessdate=24 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the City of Boston and Venture Café Kendall opened District Hall, a free drop-in workspace for entrepreneurs, including an event venue, restaurant and coffee shop. In 2018, as part of St. Louis Cortex District's new 4220 Duncan building anchored by Microsoft, Venture Cafe launches Innovation Hall in St. Louis based upon Boston's District Hall.&lt;ref name="nextstl-innovationhall"&gt;{{cite web |title=Cortex Unveils New 4220 Duncan Building|work=NextSTL |url=https://nextstl.com/2018/05/cortex-unveils-new-4220-duncan-building/|first=Jason |last=Deem |date=10 May 2018 |accessdate=24 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The St. Louis location will also be the first to launch the Education Hub, also known as EdHub STL, a program supporting and bringing together innovators in education to benefit youth access to education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Venture Cafe St. Louis To Open Innovation Hall At Cortex|url=http://eqstl.com/venture-cafe-st-louis-open-innovation-hall-cortex/|date=12 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; EdHub STL is inspired by the Forward Through Ferguson report which calls for an innovation education hub to address the region's most entrenched educational issues.&lt;ref name="fwdthruferguson"&gt;{{cite web |title=Create an Innovative Education Hub|work=Forward Through Ferguson |url=https://forwardthroughferguson.org/calls-to-action/innovative-education-hub/|date= 24 August 2018 |accessdate=24 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Programs ==
=== Thursday Gathering ===
The flagship program of Venture Café, is the Thursday Gathering, a weekly, community-focused event that provides opportunities for new and experienced entrepreneurs the ability to exchange ideas and support. The Thursday Gathering includes several free educational sessions aimed at entrepreneurs to learn how to start and run a business. The Gatherings are intentionally informal allowing for more opportunity to engage in creative and speculative ideas and look for collaborators, co-founders, mentors, or investors.&lt;ref name="venture-name" /&gt;

=== Civic Innovation Centers ===
Venture Cafés in St. Louis, Boston, and Philadelphia currently offer free drop-in workspace for entrepreneurs to work and collaborate in addition to paid event and meeting rooms and restaurants and coffeeshops.

=== Education ===
Venture Café Foundation in Boston currently runs the Roxbury Innovation Center and St. Louis is launching EdHub STL in 2018.&lt;ref name="bizjournal-cortex"&gt;{{cite web |title='Innovation center,' restaurant to open at Cortex|work=St. Louis Business Journal |url=https://www.bizjournals.com/stlouis/news/2018/04/11/innovation-center-restaurant-to-open-at-cortex.html|date= 11 April 2018 |accessdate=24 August 2018| first=Steph |last=Kukuljan}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both programs focus on bringing together innovators in education including students, parents, administration, and teachers to help solve inequities in education and introduce youth to entrepreneurship and STEAM activities.

=== Café Nights ===
Café Nights are monthly or quarterly versions of the Thursday Gathering located outside the weekly event.

[[File:Labour productivity levels in Europe. OECD, 2015.png|thumb|[[Labour economics|Labour]] productivity levels in [[Europe]]. [[OECD]], 2016&lt;ref name="oecd-data"&gt;{{cite report |url=https://data.oecd.org/lprdty/gdp-per-hour-worked.htm#indicator-chart |title=GDP per hour worked |date=2018 |access-date=November 16, 2018 |work=OECD}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[File:LabourProdComparison.PNG|thumb|Labour productivity US, Japan, [[Germany]]]]

'''Workforce productivity''' is the amount of [[good (economics)|goods]] and [[Service (economics)|services]] that a [[worker]] produces in a given amount of time. It is one of several types of [[productivity]] that [[economics|economists]] measure. Workforce productivity, often referred to as '''[[Productivity#Labor productivity|labor productivity]]''', is a measure for an organization or company, a process, an industry, or a country.

Workforce productivity is to be distinguished from [[employee productivity]] which is a measure employed at ''individual level'' based on the assumption that the overall productivity can be broken down to increasingly smaller units until, ultimately, to the individual employee, in order be used for example for the purpose of allocating a benefit or sanction based on individual performance (see also: [[Vitality curve]]).

In 2002, the [[OECD]] defined it as "the ratio of a volume measure of output to a volume measure of input".&lt;ref&gt;OECD Manual: ''Measuring Productivity; Measurement of Aggregate and Industry-Level Productivity Growth''. (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; Volume measures of output are normally [[gross domestic product]] (GDP) or [[gross value added]] (GVA), expressed at constant prices i.e. adjusted for [[inflation]]. The three most commonly used measures of input are:
# hours worked, typically from the OECD Annual National Accounts database&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170419234822/https://www.oecd.org/std/productivity-stats/40526851.pdf|title=Defining and Measuring Productivity|date=2017-04-19|access-date=2017-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# workforce jobs; and
# number of people in employment.

== Measurement ==
Workforce productivity can be measured in 2 ways, in physical terms or in price terms.
* the intensity of labour-effort, and the quality of labour effort generally.
* the creative activity involved in producing technical innovations.
* the relative efficiency gains resulting from different systems of management, organization, co-ordination or engineering.
* the productive effects of some forms of labour on other forms of labour.

These aspects of productivity refer to the ''qualitative'' dimensions of labour input. If an organization is using labour much more intensely, one can assume it's due to greater labour productivity, since the output per labour-effort may be the same. This insight becomes particularly important when a large part of what is produced in an economy consists of services. Management may be very preoccupied with the productivity of employees, but the productivity gains of management itself is very difficult to prove. While labor productivity growth has been seen as a useful barometer of the U.S. economy’s performance, recent research has examined why U.S. labor productivity rose during the recent downturn of 2008–2009, when U.S. gross domestic product plummeted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/wp/wp694.pdf Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, ''The Labor Productivity Puzzle'', May 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

The validity of international comparisons of labour productivity can be limited by a number of measurement issues. The comparability of output measures can be negatively affected by the use of different valuations, which define the inclusion of taxes, margins, and costs, or different deflation indexes, which turn current output into constant output.&lt;ref&gt;International Labor Comparisons Program [http://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/prod4.pdf International comparisons of manufacturing productivity and unit labor costs trends]. Bureau of Labor Statistics&lt;/ref&gt; Labor input can be biased by different methods used to estimate average hours&lt;ref&gt;Susan Fleck [http://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2009/05/art1full.pdf International comparisons of hours worked: an assessment of the statistics]. ''Monthly Labor Review'', May 2009&lt;/ref&gt; or different methodologies used to estimate employed persons.&lt;ref&gt;Gerard Ypma and Bart van Ark [http://www.euklems.net/pub/no10.pdf Employment and Hours Worked in National Accounts: a Producer’s View on Methods and a User’s View on Applicability] Groningen Growth and Development Centre, University of Groningen and The Conference Board&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, for level comparisons of labor productivity, output needs to be converted into a common currency.  The preferred conversion factors are [[Purchasing Power Parity|Purchasing Power Parities]], but their accuracy can be negatively influenced by the limited representativeness of the goods and services compared and different aggregation methods.&lt;ref&gt;International Labor Comparisons Program [http://www.bls.gov/fls/flsgdp.pdf International comparisons of GDP per capita and per employed person]. Bureau of Labor Statistics&lt;/ref&gt; To facilitate international comparisons of labor productivity, a number of organizations, such as the [[OECD#Statistics|OECD]], the [http://www.ggdc.net/ Groningen Growth Centre], [[Division of international labor comparisons|International Labor Comparisons Program]], and The Conference Board, prepare productivity data adjusted specifically to enhance the data’s international comparability.

== Factors of labour productivity and quality ==
[[File:US productivity and real wages.jpg|thumb|U.S. productivity and average real earnings, 1947–2008]]

In a survey of manufacturing growth and performance in Britain and Mauritius, it was found that:

&lt;blockquote&gt; 
"The factors affecting labour productivity or the performance of individual work roles are of broadly the same type as those that affect the performance of manufacturing firms as a whole. They include: (1) physical-organic, location, and technological factors; (2) cultural belief-value and individual attitudinal, motivational and behavioural factors; (3) international influences – e.g. levels of innovativeness and efficiency on the part of the owners and managers of inward investing foreign companies; (4) managerial-organizational and wider economic and political-legal environments; (5) levels of flexibility in internal labour markets and the organization of work activities – e.g. the presence or absence of traditional craft demarcation lines and barriers to occupational entry; and (6) individual rewards and payment systems, and the effectiveness of personnel managers and others in recruiting, training, communicating with, and [[Employee motivation|performance-motivating employees]] on the basis of pay and other incentives."&lt;ref name="survey"&gt;''Manufacturing In Britain: A Survey Of Factors Affecting Growth &amp; Performance'', ISR/Google Books, revised 3rd edition. 2003, page 58. {{ISBN|978-0-906321-30-0}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=z_xxhBtL8uAC]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It was further found that:

&lt;blockquote&gt; 
"The emergence of computers has been noted as a significant factor in increasing labor productivity in the late 1990s, by some, and as an insignificant factor by others, such as R.J. Gordon. Although computers have existed for most of the 20th century, some economic researchers have noted a lag in productivity growth caused by computers that didn't come until the late 1990s."&lt;ref name="survey"/&gt;

The '''Young American Award''' is an award of the [[Boy Scouts of America]] for outstanding college students ages 19 through 25 who have achieved excellence in the fields of art, athletics, business, community service, education, government, humanities, literature, music, religion, and science; and have given service to their community, state, and/or country.

The award was presented at both the national and the local council levels, but the national program was discontinued in 2009 due to funding. A maximum of five national awards had been presented annually while local awards continue to be unlimited. Each local council made the determination for nominating its candidates for national competition.  Recipients of the national award also received a $7,500 cash award that was primarily funded by [[Learning for Life]].  Membership in any of the BSA or Learning for life programs is not obligatory.&lt;ref name=YAA&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scouting.org/awards/youngamerican/ |title=The Young American Award |accessdate=August 4, 2007 |publisher=Boy Scouts of America}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.learning-for-life.org/cgi/catalog/catalog.cgi?p=99-290&amp;c=4 |title=Young American Award Information |accessdate=August 4, 2007 |publisher=Learning for Life}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Award==
The national award consisted of a silver medallion suspended from a red, white and blue ribbon worn around the neck.  The medallion bears the images of young man and a young woman above a wreath.  Local recipients receive a gold version of the medallion affixed to a wooden plaque.  Recipients may wear the corresponding square knot insignia, with a silver knot on a red, white and blue background, on the BSA uniform.

==History==
The award was first presented in 1954 by the [[United States Department of Justice]] as the Young American Award for Service and the Young American Award for Bravery.  Each of these awards were to be presented to two young people from each state and territory annually.  The Justice Department had trouble promoting the award and approached the BSA for assistance in 1966.

With the launch of coeducational [[Exploring (Learning for Life)|Exploring]] in 1968, the BSA took on the role of soliciting and receiving nominations, and assumed the program in 1971.  The awards were originally available to youth ages 15 through 25; in 2005, it was changed to college students ages 19 through 25.

The original medals were suspended from neck ribbons, but the BSA soon changed them to a table medal, with the medallion placed in a block of [[acrylic glass]].  The ribbon version of the medal was restored for the national award after the introduction of [[Venturing (Boy Scouts of America)|Venturing]].

The square knot insignia is the same as was used for three former [[Exploring (Learning for Life)|Exploring]] awards: the Explorer Silver Award, Exploring Achievement Award and the Exploring G.O.L.D. Award.  This knot may also be worn by those Scouting and Venturing leaders who have earned the predecessor awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Insignia Guide 2009–2010 |publisher=Boy Scouts of America |date=2009 |isbn=978-0-8395-3066-4 |id=#33066}}&lt;/ref&gt;
