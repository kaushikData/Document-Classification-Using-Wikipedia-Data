The '''1943 [[Victorian Football Association]] season''' was not played owing to [[World War II]], which was at its peak at the time.

==Abandonment of the season==
[[World War II]] commenced in Europe in September 1939, and had spread to the [[Pacific War|Pacific]] in December 1941. The Association had continued with a full program of football in the [[1940 VFA season|1940]] and [[1941 VFA season|1941]] seasons – with the sole exception that [[Sandringham Football Club|Sandringham]] had competed as an amateur club in the latter season&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Argus|publication-place=Melbourne, VIC|title=Association teams – Preston's haul|date=12 April 1941|page=16|author=}}&lt;/ref&gt; – but had cancelled the [[1942 VFA season|1942]] season when it became clear that the competition would distract from the [[war effort]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Argus|publication-place=Melbourne, VIC|title=Association against football|date=21 April 1942|page=6|author=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1943, the state of war had not changed, and the Association decided on 22 February that it would not resume the premiership for the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Argus|publication-place=Melbourne, VIC|title=No Association football|date=23 February 1943|page=9|author=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Association premiership would not again be staged until [[1945 VFA season|1945]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21696">The '''2012 Paros beating and rape''' of a teenage girl by an [[Illegal immigration|illegal immigrant]] named Ahmed Waqas (alternate names reported including Ahmet Vaka, Ahmet Bakas, and Ahmet Vakash)&lt;ref name=Tsiliopoulos&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tsiliopoulos |first1=E. |title=Omogeneia Rushes to Aid Myrto |url=http://www.newgreektv.com/index.php/omogeneia/item/1710-omogeneia-rushes-to-aid-myrto |accessdate=14 September 2015 |publisher=[[New Greek TV]] |date=13 November 2013 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140813162959/http://www.newgreektv.com/index.php/omogeneia/item/1710-omogeneia-rushes-to-aid-myrto |archivedate=13 August 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; attracted widespread attention. Perpetrated on the island of [[Paros]], [[Greece]], the case became notorious at a time of rising concern about the increasing numbers of illegal immigrants arriving in the country. Injuries to the victim, usually referred to in the Greek press solely by her first name "Myrto" ({{lang-el|Μυρτώ}}), resulted in permanent [[disability]].&lt;ref name=InterviewWithMotherofVictim/&gt;

== The event ==
On 23 July 2012 a teenage girl, Myrto Papadomichelaki ({{lang-el|Μυρτώ Παπαδομιχελάκη}}), was found half naked, beaten and in a coma, on one of the most popular beaches in the Greek island, [[Paros]].&lt;ref name=LifeSentence/&gt;  Her head had been bashed in with a rock weighing 5 kilos.&lt;ref name=Labropoulos&gt;{{cite news|last1=Labropoulos|first1=Vasilis|title=Δράκος της Πάρου: "Της έλιωσα το κεφάλι με μια πέτρα πέντε κιλών"|url=http://www.tovima.gr/society/article/?aid=470059|accessdate=7 August 2015|publisher=Tovima|date=7 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The authorities ordered the girl to be transferred to a hospital in [[Athens]] so that she would have the best of care and started looking for evidence in the [[crime scene]] in order to find the assaulter.&lt;ref name="The incident"&gt;,Gr Reporter, (2012). 15-year-old tourist on Paros Island beaten and probably raped.

However, when the [[forensic]] specialist from Athens, Dr. Nikos Kalogrias announced that he had found semen over the girl’s body, the focus of the investigation changed to rape and near-fatal beating.&lt;ref name="The incident"/&gt;&lt;ref name=VergewaltigervonParos&gt;{{cite news|title=So wurde ein illegaler Einwanderer zum Vergewaltiger von Paros|url=http://www.unzensuriert.at/content/009883-So-wurde-ein-illegaler-Einwanderer-zum-Vergewaltiger-von-Paros|accessdate=26 July 2015|date=1 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Suspects ==
According to the police report, initially the suspects were 12 men, Greeks and foreigners, who either worked by the beach and the crime scene or had been seen by witnesses in the area.  As the investigation continued, the suspects were narrowed to four and police concluded, with the help of several eyewitnesses, that the suspect was a man who worked by the crime scene.&lt;ref name="The arrest"&gt;,Gr Reporter, (2012). 21-year-old Pakistani sought for the brutal rape in Paros. Retrieved from: http://www.grreporter.info/en/21-year-old_pakistani_sought_brutal_rape_paros/7424.&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically the mother of the teenage girl reported that she saw a man, wearing white trousers and a colorful shirt, walking away from the crime scene. Ahmed Waqas's co-workers said that he was wearing this kind of clothes at work the day of the incident. However, Ahmed had already left the island to go to Athens, ostensibly because of the serious illness of one of his relatives.&lt;ref name="The arrest" /&gt;  Ahmed was picked up during a random check in Athens and DNA was used to identify him as the likely culprit.&lt;ref name=RandomCheckFindsSuspect&gt;{{cite news|title=Man arrested in connection to brutal rape of teen|url=http://www.ekathimerini.com/143667/article/ekathimerini/news/man-arrested-in-connection-to-brutal-rape-of-teen|accessdate=7 August 2015|publisher=Kathimerini|date=4 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A gardener, Ahmed had told his Paros employers that he had to leave the island to visit an ailing family member.&lt;ref name=GardenerQuestioned&gt;{{cite news|title=Police question suspect over brutal attack on Paros|url=http://www.ekathimerini.com/143638/article/ekathimerini/news/police-question-suspect-over-brutal-attack-on-paros|accessdate=7 August 2015|publisher=Kathimerini|date=3 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Βασίλης"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Βασίλης|first1=Λαμπρόπουλος Βασίλης|title=Ποιος είναι ο "Δράκος της Χρυσής Ακτής"|url=http://www.tovima.gr/society/article/?aid=469740|accessdate=7 August 2015|publisher=To Vima|date=5 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Perpetrator ==
A few days later the police arrested Ahmed Waqas, in Nea Chalkidona, Athens, along with two other [[illegal immigrants]]. Police located suspect through his mobile phone and with the help of other immigrants.&lt;ref name="The procedure"&gt;, Keep Talking Greece, (2012). Paros: Police Arrests Assaulter of Teenager Girl; Illegal Immigrant from Pakistan Confesses the Crime. Retrieved from: http://www.keeptalkinggreece.com/2012/08/04/paros-police-arrests-assaulter-of-teenager-girl-illegal-immigrant-from-pakistan-confesses-the-crime/.&lt;/ref&gt; The police compared DNA obtained from Ahmed's saliva with DNA that found on the girl's clothes and body and confirmed a match, after which Ahmed confessed his crime.&lt;ref name="The procedure" /&gt; Ahmed Waqas was reportedly calm and emotionless while describing the events of the crime to the police officers. As he stated, his first intention was to steal the girl's mobile phone but she tried to repel his attack. Then, he started beating her with a rock until she fell unconscious. While the girl could not fight anymore he raped her and then beat her again against the stones.&lt;ref name="The procedure"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Κρίθηκεπροφυλακιστέος"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Διονύσης|first1=Βυθούλκας|title=Κρίθηκε προφυλακιστέος ο 19χρονος Πακιστανός για την κακοποίηση της 15χρονης|url=http://www.tovima.gr/society/article/?aid=469828|accessdate=7 August 2015|publisher=To Vima|date=6 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The perpetrator had been scheduled for voluntary repatriation to Pakistan at the time of the arrest.&lt;ref name=DeportationScheduled&gt;{{cite news|title=Paros rape suspect was due for deportation, says police|url=http://www.ekathimerini.com/143701/article/ekathimerini/news/paros-rape-suspect-was-due-for-deportation-says-police|accessdate=6 August 2015|publisher=[[Kathimerini]]|date=6 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Social reaction ==
After his confession, Ahmed Waqas was taken to the island of [[Syros]] where he testified again before the district prosecutor. While the police accompanied him from the ferry to the prosecutor's office, passersby shouted slogans against him. Supporters of the Greek nationalist party, [[Golden Dawn (party)|Golden Dawn]] were in the angry crowd shouting denunciations of the rapist.&lt;ref name="The prosecutor"&gt;, Gr Reporter, (2012). Rapist from Paros faces the prosecutor. Retrieved from: http://www.grreporter.info/en/rapist_paros_faces_prosecutor/7431.&lt;/ref&gt; The political demonstrations that surrounded the transportation and trial of the perpetrator had a significant impact. Police, in fear of any reprisal actions, started an operation of localization of any illegal immigrants in down town Athens having as a goal the "cleaning" of the capital's center and the deportation of all illegals. Minister of Citizen Protection, [[Nikos Dendias]], stated that "the detention and deportation will continue until the center of Athens is "clean"", did not please the nationalist party, Golden Dawn which published the following announcement:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Enough with illegal immigrants! The horrible crime against a minor Greek was committed again by an illegal immigrant. The need for multiple deterrence measures is immediate. Any crime committed by an illegal alien must be statutory. Whoever talks about [[racism]], should host the criminals at his home. The only racism that exists, is the racism against the Greeks.&lt;ref name="The procedure" /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As suspect was being transported from Syros to the port of [[Piraeus]], near Athens, members of Golden Dawn, angered not only by the rape and attempted murder, but by the fact that the culprit appeared to have lied about his age to secure trial in the juvenile justice system, attempted to pull him from the police car in which he was being transported, allegedly in order to [[lynching|lynch]] him.&lt;ref name=GRReporter&gt;{{cite news|title=The Pakistani raped calmly and consciously|url=http://www.grreporter.info/en/pakistani_raped_calmly_and_consciously/7440|accessdate=6 August 2015|publisher=Greek Reporter|date=8 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GoldenDawnAttack&gt;{{cite news|title=Greece: Police vehicle carrying Pakistani man attacked|url=http://www.euronews.com/2012/08/08/greece-police-vehicle-carrying-pakistani-man-attacked/|accessdate=7 August 2015|publisher=[[Euronews]]|date=8 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the initial trial, the perpetrator was discovered to have lied about his age in order to be tried and punished as a juvenile.&lt;ref name=Xryshayg&gt;{{cite news|title=Η Μυρτώ σε κρίσιμη κατάσταση - Ο πακιστανός συνεχίζει τις πολυτελείς διακοπές  Διαβάστε περισσότερα|url=http://www.xryshaygh.com/enimerosi/view/h-murtw-se-krisimh-katastash-o-pakistanos-sunechizei-tis-poluteleis-diakope#.UZNN06Kmgvk|accessdate=6 August 2015|publisher=Xryshayg|date=15 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Trial ==
The defendant, an illegal immigrant, initially convinced authorities that he was a minor so that he could be adjudicated by a [[juvenile court]]. He first reported that he was born in 1991, then in 1993 and finally he stated that he was born in 1995. His inconsistency made the investigator ask the prosecutor to add those false statements to the prosecution. However Ahmed did not change his attitude and continued lying, as a result, the court's initial judgement was for him to be held in prison for two years.&lt;ref name="The trial"&gt;iNews, (2012).

==Impact==

In the immediate aftermath of the rape, [[Nikos Dendias]], Minister for Civil Protection, announced a program to detain and deport illegal immigrants from central [[Athens]].&lt;ref name=GriechischePolizei&gt;{{cite news|title=Griechische Polizei greift nach Vergewaltigung einer 15-Jährigen durch|url=http://www.unzensuriert.at/content/009791-Griechische-Polizei-greift-nach-Vergewaltigung-einer-15-J-hrigen-durch|accessdate=6 August 2015|publisher=Unzensuriert|date=23 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Agression Xénophobe"&gt;{{cite news|title=Grèce: un jeune sans-papier tué dans une agression xénophobe|url=http://www.lexpress.fr/actualite/monde/europe/grece-un-jeune-sans-papier-tue-dans-une-agression-xenophobe_1148795.html#YQ7WB8IQJQXzbhXl.99|accessdate=6 August 2015|publisher=L'Express|date=12 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hundreds of illegal immigrants including dozens of Pakistanis were immediately rounded up and deported from Athens.&lt;ref name=GoldenDawnAttack/&gt;&lt;ref name=Deportations&gt;{{cite news|title=21-year-old Pakistani is the perpetrator of the brutal rape in Paros|url=http://www.grreporter.info/en/21yearold_pakistani_perpetrator_brutal_rape_paros/7429#sthash.LmHLj5Db.dpuf|accessdate=7 August 2015|publisher=Greek Reporter|date=4 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The attack and rape of a 15-year-old Greek girl by an [[Immigration to Greece|illegal immigrant]] is considered to have "played into" the ([[Golden Dawn (political party)|Golden Dawn]]) party’s hands.&lt;ref name=Reid&gt;{{cite news|last1=Reid|first1=Sue|title=A Fascist party in full cry.

Anger over this rape and "attempted murder" is said to have stoked a wave of assaults on foreigners, including the incident in which Iraq Aladin, an illegal immigrant from [[Iraq]] was stabbed and beaten to death by five masked hoodlums on Aug. 12, 2012.&lt;ref name="Agression Xénophobe"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Fotiadis&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fotiadis|first1=Apostolis|title=Xenophobes Find Police Protection in Greece|url=http://www.ipsnews.net/2012/09/xenophobes-find-police-protection-in-greece/|accessdate=6 August 2015|publisher=IPS News Agency|date=19 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Anti-immigration parties in other European countries publicized the incident as a rallying point, including the [[British National Party]].&lt;ref name=Xaameriki&gt;{{cite news|title=TREACHERY!

The '''2014 FIA Hill Climb Masters''' was the first edition of [[FIA Hill Climb Masters]], between the winners of hill climb national championships, and the winners of the FIA Hill Climb Competitions. The event was held between 11–12 October 2014 in [[Eschdorf]], [[Luxembourg]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fia.com/news/hill-climb-latest-decisions-and-2014-calendars&lt;/ref&gt;

The overall win was taken by Frenchman Nicolas Schatz, at the wheel of his Category III [[Norma Auto Concept|Norma]], as he recorded a time of 48.344 seconds for the {{convert|1.85|km|mi|abbr=on}} run. He finished almost a quarter of a second clear of [[Scott Moran]], in his [[Gould Racing|Gould]], while the best of the Category II cars finished in third place with Eric Berguerand driving his [[Formula 3000]] [[Lola Racing Cars|Lola]]. The top Category I driver was Yanick Bodson, recording a time of 60.834 seconds. In the Nations' Cup, countries were ranked in their consistency; three drivers per nation were considered, with the gaps between a driver's two runs counting towards the rankings. Italy's gap of 3.182 seconds was the smallest and therefore won the Cup, beating Switzerland's gap of 3.463 seconds, while third place went to Austria, with their gap of 4.952 seconds.

{{for|the band|Action Item}}
In [[management]], an '''action item''' is a documented event, task, activity, or [[action (philosophy)|action]] that needs to take place. Action items are discrete units that can be handled by a single person.

==Planning actions==
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2007}}
Action items are usually created during a discussion by a group of people who are [[meeting]] about one or more topics and during the discussion it is discovered that some kind of action is needed.  The act required is then documented as an action item and usually assigned to someone, usually a member of the group.  The person to whom the action is assigned is then obligated to perform the action and report back to the group on the results.

Action items are usually documented in the meeting [[minutes]] and are recorded in the [[task list]] of the group.  As people complete action items, the items are documented as being completed and the item is removed from the list of outstanding action items.

==Attributes==
There are many attributes that can be associated with an action item - e.g.:
* Identifier - Unique mark to reference event or item.
* Description - Short explanation of activity to be performed
* Work stream - Business requirements, technical design, user interface, commit checklist, commit gate materials, etc. (optional)
* Issue or Risk - Associated with a project issue or risk
* Status - Open, In Progress, Resolved, Canceled
* Urgency/Priority - What is the impact to your project's critical path?
* Comments - Description of what is now being done to solve the issue
* Owner - Who is responsible for actively working the issue?
* Created Date - Date issue was opened
* Planned completion date - When will this issue be solved?
* Actual completion date - Date issue was closed

==Tracking==
{{Refimprove section|date=September 2007}}
A usual format for an action item is to record an action item number, the date when the action item is identified or created, the name of the person to whom the action is assigned, a title description of the action, a more detailed description of the action and its outcomes, and its deliverables.

An action item can be considered a more general form of various types of action/issue/defect tracking methods.  For instance, a [[bug report]] is a form of action item as is a service report created by a service company to track a problem reported by a customer or an [[Return Merchandise Authorization|RMA]] number.

Follow up in a consistent and timely manner with the responsible individual(s) to track their progress and drive the action item to resolution.

It is important to understand the distinction here that we track to resolution and not to completion.  While it is the goal to have every action item completed, there are numerous scenarios in which the action item may no longer be relevant or completion may not be possible.

==Software==

There are a number of software applications for tracking action items or service reports.  These applications are used within software development organizations as well as in customer support functions.  Because these software applications facilitate group communication, they are often referred to as [[Collaborative software]] or groupware.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}. Various such software are available in the market. They are known to increase the productivity of Managers.

Many information technology support groups use some kind of service report software so that when a trouble report is called in, the person answering the telephone will create a trouble ticket to track the issue.  The trouble ticket is assigned to a member of the IT services organization who then visits the person who has reported a problem and resolves the problem.  The IT services person will then close out the trouble ticket indicating the issue has been resolved.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}

Recent research at the Computational Semantics Lab at [[Stanford University]] seeks to automatically identify action items and extract their properties (the ''what'', ''who'', and ''when'' of the action item) using [[automatic speech recognition]] transcripts from spontaneous, multi-party conversations during meetings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nlp.stanford.edu/pubs/sigdial06.pdf|title=Automatically Detecting Action Items in Audio Meeting Recordings|website=Stanford EDU|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10531">'''Bagrat II Bagratuni''' ({{lang-hy|Բագրատ Բ Բագրատունի}}, [[Arabic]]: ''Buqrāṭ ibn Ashūṭ''; died after 851) was an [[Armenians|Armenian]] noble of the [[Bagratuni dynasty|Bagratid (Bagratuni) family]] and the presiding prince ("prince of princes") of [[Arminiya|Arab-ruled Armenia]] between 830 and 851. He succeeded his father, [[Ashot IV Bagratuni]], as ruler of [[Taron (historic Armenia)|Taron]] in 826, and was named presiding prince by the [[Abbasid Caliph]] in 830. In 849 he began an open rebellion against Abbasid authority in Armenia. The rebellion provoked the dispatch of [[Bugha al-Kabir]] to the country, who crushed the revolt in a three-year campaign. Bagrat was treacherously captured during negotiations in 851 and brought captive to the Abbasid capital [[Samarra]]. He was succeeded in Taron by his sons, while the title of presiding prince passed to his nephew, the future King [[Ashot I of Armenia]].

Bagrat was the eldest son of [[Ashot IV Bagratuni]],{{sfn|Ter-Ghewondyan|1976|p=41}} who by the time of his death in 826 had come to control a large part of [[Armenian Highlands|Armenia]], and was recognized by the [[Abbasid]] caliphs as presiding prince (''[[Ishkhan (title)|ishkhan]]'') of Armenia.{{sfn|Laurent|1919|pp=103–104}} After his death, Bagrat and his brother [[Smbat VIII Bagratuni|Smbat]] divided their father's inheritance between them: Bagrat took the regions of [[Taron (historic Armenia)|Taron]], [[Khoith]] and [[Sassoun]], i.e. the family's domains on the Upper [[Euphrates]], while Smbat received the ancestral lands around [[Bagaran (ancient city)|Bagaran]] and the [[Araxes]] river. In a calculated effort to keep the two brothers divided, the Abbasid government divided Ashot's authority and conferred on Smbat the title of commander-in-chief (''[[sparapet]]''), while Bagrat was named presiding prince four years after his father's death.{{sfn|Ter-Ghewondyan|1976|p=41}}{{sfn|Laurent|1919|p=105}} Bagrat was also probably the first presiding prince to bear the title of "prince of princes" (''[[ishkhan ishkhanats]]'') instead of just "prince of Armenia".{{sfn|Jones|2007|pp=1–2}}{{sfn|Whittow|1996|p=216}}

Abbasid calculations proved correct, as the two brothers spent much time quarrelling with each other.{{sfn|Laurent|1919|p=105}} In 841, for instance, Bagrat had the Armenian bishops depose the [[Catholicos of Armenia]], [[John IV of Armenia|John IV]], but he was promptly re-installed in his see by Smbat with the assistance of the other princes.{{sfn|Laurent|1919|pp=149–150, esp. note 6}} Nevertheless, the Armenian princes were able to use the Caliphate's preoccupation with the [[Khurramite]] rebellion of [[Babak Khorramdin]] to achieve a significant degree of autonomy during this period. Smbat, who had spent time at the caliphal court as a hostage, was more circumspect about openly challenging Arab power than his brother, but both were ultimately too weak to seriously threaten Abbasid predominance for the time being.{{sfn|Laurent|1919|pp=105–107}} Thus Bagrat participated in the [[Sack of Amorium|great campaign]] of Caliph [[al-Mu'tasim]] against the [[Byzantine Empire]] in 838, and even fought in the [[Battle of Dazimon]] against Emperor [[Theophilos (emperor)|Theophilos]].{{sfn|PmbZ|loc=Bagrat Bagratuni (#730)}}{{sfn|Laurent|1919|p=212}} In 841, on the other hand, under the leadership of the ''sparapet'' Smbat, the Armenians revolted against the appointment as caliphal governor of [[Khalid ibn Yazid al-Shaybani]], who in his previous tenures had become enormously unpopular among both the Christian and the Arab princes of the country. The rebels achieved his recall by the Caliph and his replacement with the weaker and more pliant Ali ibn Husayn, to whom the Armenians not only refused to hand over the expected taxes, but whom they promptly blockaded in his capital, [[Bardaa]].{{sfn|Laurent|1919|pp=117, 163 note 4}}{{sfn|Ter-Ghewondyan|1976|p=28}}

In this way, throughout the reign of Caliph [[al-Wathiq]] (842–847), Armenia remained outside effective Abbasid control, but the accession of the energetic [[al-Mutawakkil]] in 847 brought to the throne a ruler determined to reimpose Abbasid authority.{{sfn|Laurent|1919|p=117}} In 849, the Caliph appointed a new governor of ''[[Arminiya]]'', [[Abu Sa'id Muhammad al-Marwazi]]. As he moved to enter Armenia with his army, however, he was met on the border by envoys from Bagrat with gifts and with the promised tribute, in a move calculated to prevent the Arab tax collectors from entering the country. This was an act of open revolt by Bagrat, but Abu Sa'id preferred for the moment to withdraw rather than enter the province. In the next year, Abu Sa'id sent two local Arab lords, al-Ala ibn Ahmad al-Azdi and Musa ibn Zurara, the lord of [[Arzn]], who was married to a sister of Bagrat, to subdue the two southern provinces of Taron and [[Vaspurakan]] on the pretext of raising taxes. This resulted in open conflict between the Arabs and Bagrat and the [[Artzruni]] ruler of Vaspurakan, [[Ashot I Artzruni|Ashot I]]. Ashot defeated al-Ala and evicted him from his territory, and then went to the assistance of Bagrat. The Armenian armies faced and defeated Musa near the capital of Taron, [[Muş|Mush]], and pursued him until [[Baghesh]], stopping only after the entreaties of Musa's wife, the sister of Bagrat. The Armenians then proceeded to massacre the Arab settlers in [[Aghdznik]], prompting the Caliph to intervene in force.{{sfn|Ter-Ghewondyan|1976|pp=41–42}} Abu Sa'id launched a new expedition in 851 but died on the way, and his son, [[Yusuf ibn Abi Sa'id al-Marwazi|Yusuf]], assumed leadership of the caliphal expedition. The arrival of the Abbasid army in his lands led Ashot Artzruni to prefer a separate peace with the Arabs, forcing Bagrat too to enter into negotiations with Yusuf. During the talks, however, with the connivance of his brother, he was seized and brought to the caliphal capital of [[Abbasid Samarra|Samarra]].{{sfn|Laurent|1919|pp=117–118, 122}}{{sfn|Ter-Ghewondyan|1976|pp=42–43}}

Bagrat's arrest provoked his subjects into killing Yusuf the next year. Al-Mutawakkil responded by sending a large army under the Turkic general [[Bugha al-Kabir]] into the country. Over the course of three years, Bugha methodically re-occupied and subdued the whole province of ''Arminiya'', from the southern regions of Taron and Vaspurakan up to the principalities of [[Caucasian Albania]] and most of [[Principality of Iberia|Iberia]] in the north. The princes of Armenia remained divided and focused on their own personal rivalries, facilitating the Abbasid re-conquest by fighting alongside the Caliph's troops and handing over their rivals into captivity. The re-imposition of Abbasid authority was also marked by tens of thousands of executions among the male fighting population, and did not spare the princely families, whether Christian or Muslim, either: by the time of Bugha's return to Samarra in 855, most of the princes of Armenia were captives in the Caliph's court along with their sons.{{sfn|Laurent|1919|pp=118–124}}{{sfn|Ter-Ghewondyan|1976|pp=43–44}} Nevertheless, gradually, the Armenian princes were released and their lands restored to them or their sons: Bagrat was succeeded by his sons [[Ashot II of Taron|Ashot]] and [[David of Taron|David]] as rulers of Taron, although a portion of the region seems to have passed to a member of the Artzruni family, [[Gurgen I Artzruni]] the son of Abu Belj.{{sfn|Laurent|1919|pp=124–127}} The title of ''sparapet'' was given to [[Ashot V Bagratuni]], son of Smbat, who in 862 also became "prince of princes", leading eventually to his establishment of the virtually independent [[Bagratid Kingdom of Armenia]] in 884.{{sfn|Laurent|1919|pp=128ff.}}{{sfn|Ter-Ghewondyan|1976|pp=53ff.}}

'''Beenz.com''' was a [[Website|web site]] that allowed consumers to earn beenz, a type of online [[currency]], for performing activities such as visiting a web site, [[e-commerce|shopping online]], or logging on through an [[Internet service provider]]. The beenz [[Electronic money|e-currency]] could then be spent with participating online merchants.

The marketing and brand concept positioned Beenz as ‘the web's currency,’ global money that would challenge the world’s major currencies.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} The Beenz management team raised almost $100 million from venture capitalists including Apax/Patrickof, [[Larry Ellison]] of Oracle, [[François Pinault|Francois Pinault]] of PPR, [[Vivendi|Vivendi Universal]], Italian financier Carlo de Benedetti and Hikari Tsushin of Japan.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}

Since launching a new currency is illegal in many countries, beenz management and its legal teams had to meet with finance ministers across Europe to assure them that Beenz would be categorized as virtual points. Within days of its launch in the UK, Beenz' offices in London were visited by the Financial Services Authority (FSA) on suspicion of operating an unlicensed bank (apparently the FSA misunderstood that the 'Bank of Beenz' on the website was, in fact, just a marketing name for the user account area. The company agreed to change this to 'My Beenz' and the FSA was satisfied).&lt;ref&gt;https://thehustle.co/beenz-pre-bitcoin-digital-currency&lt;/ref&gt; Beenz received several awards for its marketing campaign.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

Beenz operated in the United States, [[Sweden]], France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Singapore, Australia and China. At its peak, there were offices in 15 countries&lt;ref&gt;https://thehustle.co/beenz-pre-bitcoin-digital-currency&lt;/ref&gt;, and translations of the beenz website into several languages.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}

After the [[dot-com bubble]] burst, the company replaced its CEO, Philip Letts, with a team including the founder, Charles Cohen, and other Board directors Stephen Limpe, Don McGuire and Sean Lane. The company could not go public, further funding did not materialise, and the company was sold to US-based [[Carlson Marketing Group]] in 2001 for an undisclosed sum.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}

Carlson planned to integrate the beenz system into the [[customer relationship management]] tools they offered to clients. After the sale of the company to Carlson, beenz account holders were given a period of time to redeem their beenz before it became integrated. Competitors like Amazon who, along Visa, built systems allowing direct online payments via debit or credit cards, meant many of Beenz clients moved to these new platforms, and Beenz eventually lost most of its clients.&lt;ref&gt;https://thehustle.co/beenz-pre-bitcoin-digital-currency&lt;/ref&gt;

Carlson did not renew the domain name.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}
In June 2008, [[CNET]] counted Beenz among the greatest dotcom disasters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://crave.cnet.co.uk/0,39029477,49296926-7,00.htm |title=The greatest defunct Web sites and dotcom disasters |publisher=CNET |date=2008-06-05 |accessdate=2008-06-05 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080607211845/http://crave.cnet.co.uk/0%2C39029477%2C49296926-7%2C00.htm |archivedate=2008-06-07 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Partnerships==
Amongst the company's partnerships was one with [[MasterCard]] enabling holders of the 'rewardz card' to transfer earned beenz to their [[credit card]] account.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} This was one of the first relationships of its kind between a traditional [[Financial institution|finance company]] and a [[.com|dot-com]] enterprise.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

Beenz was also once aligned with the now-defunct [[Speedyclick.com]], which carried its own [[virtual economy|virtual currency]]. Beenz could be converted into SpeedyBucks, but not vice versa.

==Founders==
The inventor of Beenz was Charles Cohen, from the UK. He co-founded the [[Holding company|parent company]] and joined forces with former [[reality television]] star [[Neil Forrester]], whom Cohen had met whilst the pair were students at Oxford University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.computerworld.com/article/2596386/financial-it/what-it-s-like-to-work-at-beenz-com-inc-.html|title=What It's Like to Work at Beenz.com Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; After tossing around the idea of Beenz and trying to get it off the ground Charles joined forces with Dave King, John Hogg, and Philip Letts to take Beenz forward. They quickly divided roles - Charles would take on the tasks of website development becoming CTO, Dave was Head of Sales and Philip became CEO, John Hogg headed Marketing. Philip took on [[Nicolas De Santis]] to develop the much vaunted Beenz logo and brand vision. After an intensive period of fundraising Beenz launched with a guerilla marketing campaign designed by the crew and Nick Band of Band and Brown.  John Hogg moved over and De Santis became Chief Marketing Officer. Letts led Beenz to raise nearly 100 million dollars and spearheaded the expansion worldwide. He moved head office to New York from London and brought on Philippe Cothier as European president, Mitch Feigen as US president and opened an  Asian division.

Letts left Beenz after closing the last big round of over 30 million and went on to run Tradaq.com, a business-to-business exchange that allowed companies to buy and sell products and services without using cash.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uk.linkedin.com/in/philipletts Philip Letts: Linkedin Profile]&lt;/ref&gt;

De Santis left a few months after that and took on Chief Marketing Officer of Opodo.

Cohen used his experience with Beenz.com to write a book in 2002 called ''Corporate Vices: What's Gone Wrong With Business'' ({{ISBN|978-1-84112-435-3}}). He now runs [[Probability plc]] in the UK, a mobile gambling business that he co-founded in 2004. Before beenz Cohen worked with Thought Interactive (a web design business). Initially, the concept was heavily dependent on the English speaking world and to change that the company recruited such characters as the Swedish entrepreneur [[Mikael Karlmark]] to launch its first non-English subsidiary.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}

==Marketing Campaign==

The company used an innovative guerilla marketing campaign to get the word out in the early days. Instead of distributing a flyer in a conventional way, the company hired magicians and sleight-of-hand experts to slip the flyers surreptitiously into the pockets of members of the public. The flyers depicted "Billy Beenz", the fictional company mascot. Billy had a shock of red hair and a goofy expression.

There was some controversy when it transpired that the flyer distributors were specifically targeting drunk people, in an effort to make their task easier. There were many reports of people waking up after a night of drinking to find the Billy Beenz flyer mysteriously in their pocket.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}. Much of this marketing and was headed up by Beenz in-house marketing director Lyndon Ogden&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lyndonogden.co.uk/&lt;/ref&gt;, formerly of [[Unisys]].

==Business model==
The beenz business model was based upon [[arbitrage]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}} Companies purchased beenz from the company at a locally determined exchange rate. They could then award these to consumers for actions to which the issuer attached value, such as making on-line purchases. Beenz were collected by the user clicking on a [[Java Applet]] and entering their email address linked to a beenz account. Consumers were then able to use their beenz to purchase goods from online merchants. Each merchant was free to exchange beenz at any notional value they liked, the company assuming that the market would settle the exchange value of each beenz. Merchants were then able to sell beenz back to the company itself at a pre-defined exchange rate. The company made its margin on the spread between the sell and the buy price of beenz in the market. In the later stages, a professional economist was employed to model the behaviour of prices and flows of money in this micro-economy, and keep it healthy.

Cohen's stated long term aim was eventually to allow consumers to purchase beenz directly from the company and for the "beenz economy" to eventually resemble that of a real economy. However, at the time, this was fraught with difficulty as some countries (such as France) expressed a view that such alternative currency schemes were undesirable and that they would seek to prevent them from operating.

'''''Ben 10: Secret of the Omnitrix''''' is an animated [[science fiction film]] based on the American [[animated television series]] ''[[Ben 10 (2005 TV series)|Ben 10]]''. It aired on August 10, 2007, in the United States and on October 22, 2007, in the UK. During the week-long special "Ben 10 week" in April 2008, it was revealed that this movie serves as the official finale to the series even though it was aired months before the last eight episodes and the last one which was non-canon of the fourth season. It was released to DVD on May 20, 2008 exclusively at [[Walmart]] stores. However, neither of the alternate versions were on the disc, merely the original with Heatblast, but the fourth season DVD contains all four versions, plus the pop up trivia version. The film comprises the three episodes of the fourth season, and is a finale to the series canonically.

== Plot ==
{{plot|date=January 2018}}
During a battle with Dr. Animo, Ben Tennyson's destruction of the scientist's "DNA bomb" accidentally sets off a self-destruct protocol in the [[Ben 10 (TV series)#The Omnitrix|Omnitrix]]. Its activation alerts Tetrax Shard, a bounty hunter and ally, who travels with his alien slime -like pilot Gluto to Earth in order to retrieve Ben. He explains the situation to Ben, who hasn't figured out the meaning of the countdown. He leaves Gwen and Grandpa Max behind, not wanting the latter to be recognized during their trip, but Gwen sneaks on board anyway. Using the advanced medical equipment on board his ship, Tetrax finds the DNA signature of the Omnitrix's creator, Azmuth, and tracks him to a prison facility called Incarcecon. During the journey, Tetrax hopes Ben would stop being a hero when the Omnitrix stop the countdown and Azmuth would shut it up for good. Ben is upset that he'll never be a hero again. After staging a breakout, they free a female Chimera Sui Generis (Vilgax's species) named Myaxx, who is Azmuth's assistant; she had switched her [[DNA]] signature for Azmuth's when he refused to give her credit for helping to create the Omnitrix. Myaxx is also unable to disarm the self-destruct, which will not only kill Ben, but most of the universe's inhabitants, including Earth itself, but Myaxx knows how to find Azmuth, and leads them to Xenon, where he is currently hiding on. However, Ben's archenemy Vilgax, who has escaped the Null Void, also picks up on the Omnitrix's self-destruct signal, picks up Sixsix, one of Tetrax's rivals, and starts tracking Ben.

While attempting to reach Azmuth, they are attacked by Vilgax. Ben is ultimately successful in repelling the attack, though Gluto is supposedly killed in the conflict while protecting Gwen, who blames Ben. Tetrax's ship crashes on Azmuth's homeworld. As they enter his mountain fortress, they are attacked by a group of Florauna (Wildvine's species) which capture Gwen. Ben is depressed, and blames himself.

As Ben reluctantly proceeds with Tetrax and Myaxx down towards Azmuth's lair, Tetrax empathizes with Ben, revealing his origins of how working for Vilgax cost him his whole planet and everyone he's ever cared for. Tracking down Azmuth to a sealed secondary laboratory, Ben asks him to shut down the Omnitrix, but Azmuth, unconcerned about anything around him, refuses. Angry, Ben breaks down the wall with Cannonbolt and attacks him, revealing Azmuth to be an old, curmudgeonly Galvan (Grey Matter's species) hiding inside a large mechanical suit. As far as Azmuth is concerned, the whole universe deserves whatever it gets for misusing the Omnitrix. He tells them the Omnitrix was designed to be the ultimate device of peace and understanding. Everyone else made it a problem, only seeing it as the ultimate weapon.

Vilgax, having recovered from his earlier defeat, leads a massive attack on Azmuth's mountain fortress. During the fight, Gwen and Gluto reappear, Ben runs over to hug Gwen and Gluto having regenerated from some leftover material that splashed on Gwen's clothes and subsequently helping her to escape. Ben's actions during the battle renew Azmuth's faith in the universe, so he repairs the Omnitrix and he tells Ben that everyone thought Ben would never be hero if he stop the countdown, but Azmuth never said Ben would stop being a hero when the countdown stop. He gives Ben a brand-new form to use: [[List of Ben 10 aliens#Way Big|Way Big]], a skyscraper-sized alien modeled after [[Ultraman]], who easily repels Vilgax's army of drones and angrily tosses the villain into space.

With the threat over, Ben offers to return the Omnitrix to Azmuth, who is leaving Xenon with Myaxx. Azmuth, however, sees Ben as the best place for the Omnitrix to be, both because he is technically fulfilling its original intention and because the Omnitrix attracts trouble simply by virtue of its existence. Tetrax returns Ben and Gwen to Earth, leaving Ben with a new hoverboard to replace the one Ben destroyed during his battle with Animo. Tetrax is disappointed that Ben will continue being a hero and he begins to accept Ben. The Tennysons' hope of having a normal day of recreation, however, is dashed by a newsflash of '[[zombie]]s' attacking the [[shopping mall|mall]], leading them to rush to the rescue calling this a normal life for the Tennysons.

=== Alternate versions ===
''Ben 10: Secret of the Omnitrix'' was released three different times, each featuring a different alien destroying Animo's DNA bomb. Ben uses Heatblast in the first, a new form called Eye Guy in the second, and XLR8 in the third. A fourth version (actually a special version of the Ditto edition) released on the Ben 10 4th season and the movie's DVDs features trivia inserts inserted in the film.

A total of six '''bids''' were initially submitted '''for the [[2022 Winter Olympics]]'''. Four of the bids were subsequently withdrawn by 1 October 2014, citing either the high costs of hosting the Games or the lack of local support, leaving [[Almaty, Kazakhstan]] and [[Beijing, China]] as the only two remaining candidate cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://time.com/3462070/olympics-winter-2022/|title=Why Nobody Wants to Host the 2022 Winter Olympics|date=3 October 2014|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|accessdate=20 September 2015|first=Lisa|last=Abend}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Beijing]] was then elected as the host city at the [[128th IOC Session]] in [[Kuala Lumpur]], [[Malaysia]], on 31 July 2015.

==Candidate cities venues list==
Note that the selected candidate cities have slightly changed venues plan in the final proposal to the IOC. Almaty moved technical alpine skiing events from [[Shymbulak]] to Tau, and completely removed both Kok Zhaylau and Ak-Bulak ski resorts, previously proposed for snowboarding and freestyle skiing events. Beijing dropped both Taiwu and Wanlong ski resorts, and proposed hosting snowboarding and freestyle skiing events in the two venues (A and B) in Genting Snow Park.

==Candidate cities overview==
On 15 November 2013, the IOC announced the list of the six applicant cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.olympic.org/news/rising-interest-in-olympic-winter-games-as-six-cities-bid-to-host-2022-games/217175|title=Rising interest in Olympic Winter Games as six cities bid to host 2022 Games|work=olympic.org|publisher=International Olympic Committee|date=15 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 7 July 2014, the IOC announced that there were three remaining applicant cities that would move on to the candidate phase; these were Almaty, Beijing and Oslo.

On 1 October 2014, Oslo withdrew its application after one of the country's governing political parties [[Conservative Party (Norway)|Høyre]] decided not to support the application.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.si.com/more-sports/2014/10/01/norway-rejects-2022-winter-olympics "Norway government rejects 2022 Winter Olympics bid"], from ''Sports Illustrated'' 1 October 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The remaining two candidate cities were therefore Almaty and Beijing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.olympic.org/news/first-ioc-executive-board-meeting-under-president-bach/218358|title=First IOC Executive Board meeting under President Bach|publisher=International Olympic Committee|work=olympic.org|date=10 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Five bid cities submit application files to host 2022 Olympic Winter Games|url=http://www.olympic.org/news/five-bid-cities-submit-application-files-to-host-2022-olympic-winter-games/227355|work=olympic.org|publisher=International Olympic Committee|date=14 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both of the candidate cities suggested hosting the Games between February 4–20, 2022. The Paralympics will be held from March 4–13. While another city suggested hosting the Games between February 11–27, 2022. The Paralympics will be held from March 11–20.

{{main article|Almaty bid for the 2022 Winter Olympics}}
Since 2011, the [[National Olympic Committee of the Republic of Kazakhstan]] has been considering a bid for the 2022 games in [[Almaty]], the former longtime [[capital city]] and still the largest city and financial centre of the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesbids.com/eng/winter_olympic_bids/future_winter_bids/1216135536.html |title=Kazakhstan Considers 2022 Winter Games Bid |publisher=GamesBids.com |date=31 January 2011 |accessdate=14 November 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131114010311/http://www.gamesbids.com/eng/winter_olympic_bids/future_winter_bids/1216135536.html |archivedate=14 November 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aroundtherings.com/articles/view.aspx?id=42105|title=Oslo Talks Public Support; Toronto Searches for Mascot; FEI Ousts Guadalajara|work=aroundtherings.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.tengrinews.kz/kazakhstan_news/Kazakhstan-to-bid-for-2022-winter-Olympic-Games--445/|title=Kazakhstan to bid for 2022 winter Olympic Games|publisher=En.tengrinews.kz|date=28 March 2011|accessdate=14 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kazakhstan hosted the [[2011 Asian Winter Games]]. Almaty will host [[2017 Winter Universiade]]. The current Kazakh capital [[Astana]] considered to joint bid with Almaty but the idea was later declined. On 17 August 2013, Almaty announced they were bidding for the 2022 Games.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gamesbids.com/eng/winter_olympic_bids/future_winter_bids/1216136727.html Almaty Bids For 2022 Winter Olympic Games] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006122431/http://www.gamesbids.com/eng/winter_olympic_bids/future_winter_bids/1216136727.html |date=October 6, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the slogan "Keeping it Real", Almaty has emphasized her traditional winter setting with tall mountains and plenty of natural snow coverage as well as compactness — most venues are within half an hour's travel through Alpine scenery.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/almaty-offers-traditional-winter-setting-in-2022-olympic-bid/2015/07/28/d2de145a-3505-11e5-b835-61ddaa99c73e_story.html Almaty offers traditional winter setting in 2022 Olympic bid], [[Washington Post]], 2015/7/28&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jul/26/almaty-2022-winter-olympic-bid-at-a-glance/?page=all Almaty 2022 Winter Olympic bid at a glance], [[Washington Times]], 2015/7/26&lt;/ref&gt;

Presenting Kazakhstan's bid at the final event in Kuala Lumpur, Prime Minister of Kazakhstan [[Karim Massimov]] made a powerful speech with a key message that Almaty was "not a risk choice for 2022", but "a golden opportunity to prove that smaller advancing nations can successfully host the winter games". He called to the OCI core values saying that letting Almaty host the Games was "a golden opportunity to showcase the real long-term power of Olympic legacy for a region that has never hosted the Games".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6kx0YUXJGg Speech made by Karim Massimov before the final voting in Kuala Lumpur on July 31]&lt;/ref&gt;
In the final voting Almaty lost to Beijing by only 4 votes.

{{main article|Beijing bid for the 2022 Winter Olympics}}

On 5 November 2013, the [[Chinese Olympic Committee]] announced that it would submit a bid for [[Beijing]] to host the 2022 Winter Olympics. Beijing (where the indoor ice sports and the ceremonies would take place), was the host city of the [[2008 Summer Olympics]]. [[Zhangjiakou]] would host the outdoor snow events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insidethegames.biz/olympics/winter-olympics/2022/1016809-beijing-and-zhangjiakou-launch-a-joint-bid-to-host-the-2022-winter-olympic-games|title=Beijing and Zhangjiakou launch joint bid to host 2022 Winter Olympic Games|work=insidethegames.biz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the final voting in Kuala Lumpur Beijing's bid was presented by Yang Lan, a renowned former CCTV host, who said sports and fitness were becoming a new fashion trend in China. In her speech she focused on China's economy and its ability to support every commitment it made "protecting long time financial viability and the reputation of the Games".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uW5JT2_G2o Speech of Yang Lan before the final voting in Luala Lumpur on July 31]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 November 2013, the [[Norwegian Olympic and Paralympic Committee and Confederation of Sports]] announced that Oslo would be submitted as the Norwegian candidate for the 2022 Winter Olympic Games. Oslo last hosted the [[1952 Winter Olympics]], and Norway last hosted the [[1994 Winter Olympics]] in [[Lillehammer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mackay|first=Duncan|title=Exclusive: Oslo confirm they will bid for 2022 Winter Olympics and Paralympics|url=http://www.insidethegames.biz/olympics/winter-olympics/2022/1016831-exclusive-oslo-confirm-they-will-bid-for-2022-winter-olympics-and-paralympics|accessdate=6 November 2013|date=6 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 October 2014 the [[Conservative Party (Norway)|Conservative Party]] decided that they would not support a bid for the games citing costs and lack of public support.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Oslo Withdraws Bid to Host 2022 Winter Games, Citing Cost|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/02/sports/oslo-withdraws-bid-for-2022-olympics-citing-high-cost-of-games.html|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 2014-10-01|access-date = 2015-09-18|issn = 0362-4331|first = Lynn|last = Zinser}}&lt;/ref&gt; A vast number of polls were conducted, and since April 2014 support had varied between 24% and 37%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = OL-stemningen|url = http://www.minervanett.no/ol-stemningen/|website = Minerva|accessdate = 2015-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The days leading up to the deliberation in the Conservative Party had consisted of a series of negative developments for the bid. Those negative developments included the [[Centre Party (Norway)|Centre Party]] saying no through a grass root vote,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Senterpartiet sier nei til OL i Oslo 2022 - Senterpartiet|url = http://www.senterpartiet.no/meny-forside/senterpartiet-sier-nei-til-ol-i-oslo-2022-article84533-12919.html|website = www.senterpartiet.no|accessdate = 2015-09-18|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160204172514/http://www.senterpartiet.no/meny-forside/senterpartiet-sier-nei-til-ol-i-oslo-2022-article84533-12919.html|archivedate = 2016-02-04|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; a poll showing that even within the [[Norwegian Confederation of Sports]] the majority of members opposed the bid,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Idrettsmedlemmer splittet om OL|url = http://www.nrk.no/norge/idrettsmedlemmer-splittet-om-ol-1.11959889|accessdate = 2015-09-18|last = NRK}}&lt;/ref&gt; an external revision which clarified that the newly suggested cheaper budget was unrealistic&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Billig-OL dyrere enn antatt|url = http://www.nettavisen.no/na24/billig-ol-dyrere-enn-antatt/8492490.html|accessdate = 2015-09-18|last = NTB}}&lt;/ref&gt; and public scrutiny on [[IOC]]´s 7000 pages of demands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Olympics that no-one wants?|url = https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/winter-olympics/29455789|accessdate = 2015-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Norway rejected the olympic committee's application for government funding to hold the event in Norway after the private organisation IOC made a large number of demands which caused a scandal in Norway. The demands notably included "diva-like demands for luxury treatment" for the IOC members themselves, such as special lanes on all roads only to be used by IOC members and a cocktail reception at the Royal Palace with drinks paid for by the royal family. Several commentators pointed out that such demands were unheard of in a western democracy; ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' described the IOC as a "notoriously ridiculous organization run by grifters and hereditary aristocrats."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2014/10/02/ioc_demands_oslo_drops_bid_after_over_the_top_list_of_requirements.html The IOC Demands That Helped Push Norway Out of Winter Olympic Bidding Are Hilarious], Slate&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://nationalpost.com/sports/olympics/ioc-reportedly-made-some-ridiculous-demands-to-help-push-oslo-out-of-2022-winter-olympics-bidding IOC reportedly made some ridiculous demands to help push Oslo out of 2022 Winter Olympics bidding]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.vg.no/sport/ol-2022/ioc-krever-gratis-sprit-paa-stadion-og-cocktail-fest-med-kongen/a/23306598/ IOC krever gratis sprit på stadion og cocktail-fest med Kongen]&lt;/ref&gt;

Stockholm previously hosted the [[1912 Summer Olympics]] and hosted [[Equestrian at the 1956 Summer Olympics|equestrian events]] of the [[1956 Summer Olympics]], but this was the first time the Swedish capital was bidding for the Winter Olympics. Also, it would have been the first city to host both the Summer Olympics and the Winter Olympics, but that honour went to Beijing.

==Voting results for the 2022 Winter Olympics and Paralympics==
Beijing was selected as host city of the 2022 Winter Olympics and Winter Paralympics after beating Almaty by just four votes. Beijing received one more vote than the 43 needed for majority.

:St. Moritz/Davos presented a project that will host all events in the surrounding area of [[Davos]] and [[St. Moritz]]; generally speaking, "ice events" in Davos and "snow events" in St. Moritz. However, Davos has a hosting tradition in [[Cross-country skiing]] and [[Snowboarding]], and so one would expect Davos venues for those competitions. After the decision on 11 August 2011 a feasibility study for the Games was announced including the possibility to extend ice events to [[Zürich]]. The organizers decided during a session on 22 December 2011 to go forward with "St. Moritz 2022" as the official corporate name of the bid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.suedostschweiz.ch/politik/st-moritz-hat-die-besseren-chancen-sich-durchzusetzen|title=Politik: «St. Moritz hat die besseren Chancen, sich durchzusetzen|publisher=suedostschweiz.ch|date=23 December 2011|accessdate=5 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However at a plebiscite in [[Graubünden]] about the bid on 3 March 2013, the public voted with 41'758 to 37'540 votes (52.66% to 47.43%) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.gr.ch/DE/publikationen/abstimmungenwahlen/resultate/Seiten/2013_03_03_Resultat.aspx|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130306054148/http://www.gr.ch/DE/publikationen/abstimmungenwahlen/resultate/Seiten/2013_03_03_Resultat.aspx|dead-url=yes|archive-date=6 March 2013|title=Abstimmungsresultate Kanton Graubünden|accessdate=3 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; against a credit for the 2022 Olympic Games, meaning that the bid will have to be dropped.

'''''Blanton v. North Las Vegas''''', {{ussc|489|538|1989}}, is a [[United States Supreme Court]] case clarifying the limitations of the right to [[jury trial|trial by jury]].

==Background==
Melvin R. Blanton was charged with [[Driving under the influence]] of alcohol. His petition for a [[jury trial]] was denied and he was instead given a [[bench trial]]. Blanton appealed, arguing that his [[Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|sixth amendment]] right to trial by jury had been violated.

==Opinion of the Court==
The Court ruled that Blanton did not have the right to a jury trial because the crime he was charged with was "petty". The Court went on to elaborate: "offenses for which the maximum period of incarceration is six months, or less, are presumptively petty...a defendant can overcome this, and become entitled to a jury trial,..by showing that additional penalties [such as monetary fines]...are...so severe [as to indicate] that the legislature clearly determined that the offense is a serious one."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''Blanton v.

'''Celsa''' was an important pre-Roman and Roman city located near the modern town of [[Velilla de Ebro]].

Recent excavations have brought to light many rich private and public buildings which give a glimpse of its former grandeur.

==History==
Celsa was originally an Iberian settlement, called ''Kelse'', of the [[Ilergetes]] tribe. It was located in the middle reaches of the River Ebro at a privileged position on the natural route from the coast to the peninsular. It was sited on terraces rising from the river and dominating a strategic ford.

From the mid-second to the first half of the first century BC, Kelse coined its own currency with representations of winged victories, Hercules and Venus and this is the main documentation of the city.
[[File:Kelse sII-IaC.JPG|thumb|Bronze coin minted in Kelse in the 2nd century BC, showing its name in the Iberian language]]

It later had the only stone bridge over the upper Ebro &lt;ref&gt;Geography, Strabo, Volume 1, 10&lt;/ref&gt; located in Velilla de Ebro, where remains of a bridge were reported in the 19th c.

[[Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (triumvir)|Marcus Emilius Lepidus]], governor of [[Hispania Citerior]], founded a [[Colonia (Roman)|colony]] here in 44 BC with discharged veterans of the legions, who each received a plot of land to cultivate and the grant of Roman citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;Lepidus: The Tarnished Triumvir by Richard D. Weigel&lt;/ref&gt; It was known as ''Colonia Celsa Lepida'', the highest rank of Roman city and one of the only two colonies in [[Aragon]] with [[Caesaraugusta]]. The new town occupied an area of about 44 ha. and played a key role as communications centre via [[Tarraco]] (Tarragona). The population eventually numbered about 4,000.

The settlement was soon renamed ''Colonia Victrix Iulia Celsa'' because Lepidus was removed from political office and exiled in 36 BC by Augustus, Caesar's successor.&lt;ref&gt;The Oxford Classical Dictionary;  Simon Hornblower, Antony Spawforth, Esther Eidinow&lt;/ref&gt; Celsa experienced a period of great splendour, but it was brief and from the time of [[Nero]] it began to wane. The reason for its decline is likely to be due to economic and administrative changes resulting from the creation of a new and thriving colony in the area, Caesaraugusta, which monopolised the main trade flows.

==Site==
[[File:Lepida-Celsa - Mosaico en la Casa de los Delfines 03.jpg|thumb|Mosaic in the House of the Dolphins]]

Whole neighbourhoods have been brought to light with paved streets and blocks of houses of several floors arranged around courtyards, in Roman fashion, and rooms decorated with mosaics and paintings are numerous. Commercial establishments such as warehouses, shops, a market and a bakery can be seen.

Roman architects carefully designed the street plan around the terraced slopes so that the streets evacuated rainwater into the [[Ebro]] because, unlike other Roman cities, it had no drains. For this reason the main arteries of the city are parallel and perpendicular to the river.

Excavations have also unearthed remains of several residential buildings of great interest, among which are the Houses of the Dolphin and of [[Hercules]], both with beautiful and important wall paintings.

===House of Hercules===

[[File:Hércules con la clava y jabalí de Erimanto.jpg|thumb|Fresco from the House of Hercules: Hercules and the [[Erymanthian boar]]]]
This latter house, of enormous dimensions, inaugurated the use of the Tuscan [[atrium (architecture)|atrium]] in Celsa, one of the earliest types of italic-style house. Two stages can be seen in this house; the first (from the founding of the colony) centred around the Tuscan atrium and the second after the addition of the arcaded courtyard to the north, in the reign of [[Augustus]]. Rainwater collected in the [[impluvium]] of the atrium and was stored in a giant water tank located under room 29. The mosaic floors are of great beauty, especially in room 1 which also had walls adorned with paintings of the second [[Pompeian Styles|Pompeian style]], displaying several episodes of the labours of Hercules which gave its name to the house. The arcaded courtyard gave access to well-designed rooms for a peaceful and private life.

===House of the Dolphin===
The House of the Dolphin is so named after the beautiful dolphins that decorate the mosaic floors. It was altered several times after combining the two houses that the initially occupied the ''[[Insula (Roman city)|insula]]'', or block, up to the time of [[Claudius]] in 54 AD. This great mansion took shape in the first decade of the 1st c. AD built around two spaces. The first part (rooms 1-14) corresponds to
the public area and private rooms of the family; the second (15-22) is organised around an open courtyard with various rooms dedicated to services and slaves.

===Other Buildings===
The locations of possible temples, the theatre, the [[Forum (Roman)|forum]], major cisterns, springs, cemeteries and other public buildings have been identified. The theatre lies below the San José sanctuary where traces of the ''[[scaenae frons]]'' (stage) walls and tiers of seats (''[[cavea]]'') have been found.

Many small objects as lamps, Pompeian red slip dishes, Iberian ceramics, etc., as well as small bronzes, sculptural remains, coins and small pieces of jewellery are also preserved. A nearby museum displays many of the finds.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.museodezaragoza.es/exposiciones/exposicion-permanente-colonia-celsa-velilla-de-ebro-zaragoza/&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''cold wave''' (known in some regions as a '''cold snap''' or '''cold spell''') is a weather phenomenon that is distinguished by a cooling of the air. Specifically, as used by the U.S. [[National Weather Service]], a cold wave is a rapid fall in temperature within a 24-hour period requiring substantially increased protection to agriculture, industry, commerce, and social activities. The precise criterion for a cold wave is determined by the rate at which the temperature falls, and the minimum to which it falls. This minimum temperature is dependent on the geographical region and time of year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?id=cold-wave1|title=Cold Wave|publisher=[[American Meteorological Society|AMS]]: Glossary of Meteorology|accessdate=2008-09-25|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514110247/http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?id=cold-wave1|archivedate=2011-05-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, a ''cold spell'' is defined as the national average high temperature dropping below {{convert|20|F}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Seth |last=Borenstein |title=Winters aren't colder; we're just softer |url=http://www.bnd.com/2014/01/09/2996864/scientists-americans-are-becoming.html |work= |newspaper=Florida Today |location=Melbourne, Florida |pages=8A |date=January 10, 2014 |id= |accessdate=January 12, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140113033838/http://www.bnd.com/2014/01/09/2996864/scientists-americans-are-becoming.html |archivedate=January 13, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!---soft and hard copy sources differ.

==Effects==
A cold wave can cause death and injury to livestock and wildlife. Exposure to cold mandates greater [[food energy|caloric intake]] for all animals, including humans, and if a cold wave is accompanied by heavy and persistent snow, grazing animals may be unable to reach needed food and die of [[hypothermia]] or starvation. They often necessitate the purchase of foodstuffs to feed livestock at considerable cost to farmers.

Cold spells are associated with increased mortality rates in populations around the world.&lt;ref name="JaakkolaGuo2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jaakkola|first1=Jouni J.K.|last2=Guo|first2=Yuming|last3=Ryti|first3=Niilo R.I.|title=Global Association of Cold Spells and Adverse Health Effects: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis|journal=Environmental Health Perspectives|volume=124|issue=1|year=2015|issn=0091-6765|doi=10.1289/ehp.1408104|pmid=25978526|pmc=4710591}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both cold waves and heat waves cause deaths, though different groups of people may be susceptible to different weather events.&lt;ref name="JoacimBertil2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Joacim|first1=Rocklöv|last2=Bertil|first2=Forsberg|last3=Kristie|first3=Ebi|last4=Tom|first4=Bellander|title=Susceptibility to mortality related to temperature and heat and cold wave duration in the population of Stockholm County, Sweden|journal=Global Health Action|volume=7|issue=0|year=2014|issn=1654-9880|doi=10.3402/gha.v7.22737|pmid=24647126|pmc=3955771}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[developed countries]], more deaths occur during a heat wave than in a cold snap, though the mortality rate is higher in undeveloped regions of the world. Globally, more people die during cold weather than hot weather, due to the rise in diseases like cold, flu, and pneumonia.

Extreme winter cold often causes poorly [[Thermal insulation|insulated]] water [[Pipeline transport|pipelines]] and mains to freeze. Even some poorly protected indoor [[plumbing]] ruptures as water expands within them, causing much damage to property and costly insurance claims. Demand for electrical power and [[fuel]]s rises dramatically during such times, even though the generation of electrical power may fail due to the freezing of water necessary for the generation of [[hydroelectricity]]. Some metals may become brittle at low temperatures. Motor vehicles may fail when [[antifreeze]] fails or motor oil gels, producing a failure of the transportation system. To be sure, such is more likely in places like [[Siberia]] and much of Canada that customarily get very cold weather.

Fires become even more of a hazard during extreme cold. Water mains may break and water supplies may become unreliable, making [[firefighting]] more difficult. The air during a cold wave is typically denser and thus contains more oxygen, so when air that a fire draws in becomes unusually cold it is likely to cause a more intense fire.

Winter cold waves that aren't considered cold in some areas, but cause temperatures significantly below average for an area, are also destructive. Areas with subtropical climates may recognize unusual cold, perhaps barely freezing, temperatures, as a cold wave. In such places, plant and animal life is less tolerant of such cold as may appear rarely. The same winter temperatures that one associates with the norm for [[Colorado]], [[Ohio]], or [[Bavaria]] are catastrophic to winter crops in places like
[[Florida]], [[California]], or parts of [[South America]] that grow fruit and vegetables in winter.

Cold waves that bring unexpected freezes and frosts during the growing season in mid-latitude zones can kill plants during the early and most vulnerable stages of growth, resulting in crop failure as plants are killed before they can be [[harvest]]ed economically. Such cold waves have caused [[famine]]s. At times as deadly to plants as [[drought]], cold waves can leave a land in danger of later brush and [[forest fire]]s that consume dead biomass. One extreme was the so-called [[Year Without a Summer]] of 1816, one of several years during the 1810s in which numerous crops failed during freakish summer cold snaps after [[volcanic eruption]]s that reduced incoming sunlight.

==Countermeasures==
In some places, such as [[Siberia]], extreme cold requires that fuel-powered machinery to be used even part-time must be run continuously. Internal plumbing can be wrapped, and persons can often run water continuously through pipes. Energy conservation, difficult as it is in a cold wave, may require such measures as collecting people (especially the poor and elderly) in communal shelters. Even the [[homelessness|homeless]] may be [[arrest]]ed and taken to shelters, only to be released when the hazard abates.&lt;ref name="paducah_nws"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/ajantasa/1995/19950493|title=Police law of Finland 11§|language=Finnish|accessdate=2008-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hospitals can prepare for the admission of victims of frostbite and hypothermia; schools and other public buildings can be converted into shelters.

People can stock up on food, water, and other necessities before a cold wave. Some may even choose to migrate to places of milder climates, at least during the winter. Suitable stocks of forage can be secured before cold waves for livestock, and livestock in vulnerable areas might be shipped from affected areas or even slaughtered. [[Smudge pot]]s can bring smoke that prevents hard freezes on a farm or grove. Vulnerable crops may be sprayed with water that will paradoxically protect the plants by freezing and absorbing the cold from surrounding air.

Most people can dress appropriately and can even layer their clothing should they need to go outside or should their heating fail. They can also stock candles, matches, flashlights, and portable fuel for cooking and wood for fireplaces or wood stoves, as necessary. However caution should be taken as the use of charcoal fires for cooking or heating within an enclosed dwelling is extremely dangerous due to [[carbon monoxide poisoning]]. Adults must remain aware of the exposure that children and the elderly have to cold.

===21st-century cold waves (2000–present)===
'''2018
* [[2018 Great Britain and Ireland cold wave|Late February and Early March 2018 and Mid March 2018]], Europe. Easterly winds created bitter conditions twice during early spring 2018. Snow fell during both events however, Storm Emma which effected southern areas of Great Britain brought up to {{convert|50|cm|in}} of snow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-43236763|title=Storm Emma to bring up to 50cm of snow|date=2 March 2018|publisher=|accessdate=2 March 2018|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, 93 people across Europe died. With 27 in Poland and 17 in the UK.

'''2017-2018
* [[2018 North American cold wave|Cold wave starting late December 2017]] (December 24 respectively), [[North America]]. A persistent wave of temperature extremes, including a cold wave, took place in Canada and the northeastern and central areas of the United States from Northern Canada to Mississippi, with temperatures in much of Canada of around {{convert|-29|C|F}} and as low as {{convert|-39|C|F}} in New York state, and as high as {{convert|21|C|F}} and {{convert|31|C|F}} in Sandberg and Los Angeles, respectively, in California.&lt;ref name="Indep_NAmer20171230"&gt;{{cite news | last1=Sampathkumar | first1=Mythili | last2= | first2= | pages= | language= | title=North America weather: Canadian zoo moves penguins indoors because of cold temperatures | date=2017-12-30 | publisher=[[The Independent]] | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/calgary-zoo-penguins-cold-weather-canada-a8135121.html | accessdate=2017-12-31 | archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6w7gzKapF?url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/calgary-zoo-penguins-cold-weather-canada-a8135121.html | archivedate=2017-12-31 | deadurl=no | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''2017
* [[January 2017 European cold wave]] – A cold wave hit Central and East Europe on January 5. The lowest temperature was {{convert|-45.4|C|F}} degrees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.meteovesti.ru/news/63619645752-poteplenie-priblizhaetsya|title=Потепление приближается|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|language=Russian|trans-title=The warming is coming|accessdate=11 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cold caused at least 60 deaths. There was also massive snowfall.

'''2016
* [[January 2016 East Asia cold wave]] – Caused over 100 known deaths across [[East Asia]], [[South Asia]] and [[Southeast Asia]].

'''2014-2015
* [[2014–15 North American winter#Mid-February winter storm and cold wave|February 2015 North American cold wave]] – During the second half of February 2015, temperature records were broken in both sides of the spectrum. Extreme warm records were broken in the western half of the United States and extreme cold records were broken in the eastern half. In addition to the extreme cold wave at its most brutal in the Great Lakes, Mid-Atlantic, and New England, snowfall was reported as far south as [[Tupelo, Mississippi]]; [[Huntsville, Alabama]]; and [[Shreveport, Louisiana]]. The cold wave became widespread and all the remaining mild conditions from the west were pushed into northern Mexico. The cold wave even extended well into early March, with a part of every U.S. state except [[Florida]] reporting a snow cover by March 1, 2015.

* [[November 2014 North American cold wave]] – Between November 8 and November 23, a polar vortex similar to earlier in 2014 has a temporary comeback, delivering the 2014–15 winter season's first three named winter storms (Astro, Bozeman, and Cato). Snowfall records were confirmed all over the Midwest and the Northeast, especially around the Great Lakes. [[Buffalo, New York]], was among the hardest hit in the unseasonably wintry November. In addition to not being Thanksgiving yet, autumn colors were in the mix along with the deep winter snow.

'''2013-2014
* [[Early 2014 North American cold wave]] – On January 2–11, cold arctic air initially associated with a [[nor'easter]] invaded the central and eastern United States and Canada, east of the Rockies. Temperatures were even colder than the North Pole and the South Pole in many regions in the Upper Midwest and Canada. Temperatures reached as cold as −37&amp;nbsp;°F (−38&amp;nbsp;°C), and did not even get out of the negative double-digit temps in many places, including [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]]. The cold wave extended for a few more months, bringing a continuous pattern of record-low temperatures to most of the Central and upper eastern United States, before the pattern finally ended in early April.

* [[2013–14 North American winter#December cold wave|December 2013 North American cold wave]] – On December 1, the weakening of the polar vortex resulted in the jet stream shifting southward, which allowed abnormally cold temperatures to intrude the [[Central United States]]. On December 6, a daily record snowfall of 0.1 inches (2&amp;nbsp;mm) was set in the [[Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex]], breaking the old record of trace amounts of snow, set in 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wunderground.com/US/tx/dallas.html |title=Dallas, TX Weather Forecast from Weather Underground |publisher=Wunderground.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://weather.wfaa.com/cgi-bin/findweather/getForecast?brand=wfaa&amp;target=wfaa&amp;query=Dallas,TX |title=wfaa.com &amp;#124; Weather &amp;#124; Dallas, Texas (75201) Conditions &amp; Forecast |publisher=Weather.wfaa.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131211011500/http://weather.wfaa.com/cgi-bin/findweather/getForecast?brand=wfaa&amp;target=wfaa&amp;query=Dallas%2CTX |archivedate=2013-12-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The cold wave continued into December 10, before the temperatures returned to a more stable range.

'''2013
* [[2013_extreme_weather_events#United_Kingdom|United Kingdom March-April 2013]] - The UK Spring 2013 cold wave was a prolonged spell of cold weather which brought with it very heavy snowfalls, the worst in March for 30 years and since 1947 in some places. There was also some very cold temperatures with England (CET) having its coldest March since 1883 with a mean monthly temperature of 2.7°C. This meant that March was colder than all three winter months December 2012, January and February 2013. The cold weather in March came after what was a relatively cold winter however nothing like 2010-11, 2009-10 or 2008-09.
{{anchor |Spring 2013 North American cold wave}}
* Spring 2013 North American cold wave – Although the core winter of 2012–13 was fairly mild, both March and April were unusually cold across the Midwest, resulting in sharp temperature contrasts from March 2012 to March 2013 all over the United States and Canada. This late cold wave was unexpected because February and March 2013 were both forecasted to be even milder and more springlike than February and March 2012, but instead turned out with a near-average February and an unusually cold March. This same cold wave extended well into the month of April, as four named winter storms (Walda, Xerxes, Yogi, and Zeus) hammered through much of the northern United States, especially across Minnesota and the Dakotas. Minnesota's winter even extended well into early May with one more winter storm (Achilles). April is the month that usually symbolizes the majority of spring, but April 2013 was known to be snowy and wintry for the Upper Midwest, the Northern Plains, and the Prairie Provinces.

'''2012
* [[Early 2012 European cold wave]] – As of February 11, 2012 at least 590 people died during a cold snap with temperatures falling below {{convert|-35|C|F}} in some regions.&lt;ref name="Pidd, Helen &amp; Elder, Helen"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/feb/03/europe-cold-energy-death-toll|title=European cold snap threatens energy crisis as death toll rises|first1=Helen|last1=Pidd|first2=Miriam|last2=Elder|date=3 February 2012|website=the Guardian|accessdate=20 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ukraine]] is the worst hit, with over 100 deaths related to the cold.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/121772/ Kyiv Post: Ukraine Cold Spell Death Toll Rises 101] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204232211/http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/121772/ |date=February 4, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''2007
* 2007 Northern Hemisphere cold wave – All of Canada and most of the United States underwent a freeze after a two-week warming that took place in late March and early April. Crops froze, wind picked up, and snow drizzled much of the United States. Some parts of Europe also experienced unusual cold winter-like temperatures, during that time.
* [[July 2007 Argentine winter storm]] – An interaction with an area of low pressure systems across [[Argentina]] during the July 6, 7 and 8 of 2007, and the entry of a massive polar [[July 2007 Argentine winter storm|cold snap]] resulted in severe [[snowfall]]s and [[blizzard]]s, and recorded temperatures below {{convert|−32|°C}}. The cold snap advanced from the south towards the central zone of the country, continuing its displacement towards the north during Saturday, July 7. On Monday July 9, the simultaneous presence of very cold air, gave place to the occurrence of snowfalls. This phenomenon left at least 23&amp;nbsp;people dead.&lt;ref&gt;Cormier, Bill, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/07/09/AR2007070901559.html Buenos Aires Gets First Snow Since 1918], [[Associated Press]] (July 7, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/06/01/business/LA-FIN-Argentina-Energy-Woes.php Cold snap in Argentina leads to energy crunch that idles factories, triggers blackouts], AP via ''[[International Herald Tribune]]'', May 31, 2007{{Dead link|date=September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This area saw an [[ice storm]] which have a 1 in 1000 chance of happening.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} This cold front caused snow in [[Algeria]], which is extremely unusual. The south of Spain and Morocco also recorded freezing temperatures, and record freezing temperatures were observed in the north of Portugal and Spain.
* 2004 January cold outbreak, Northeast United States – New England was close to a record month when frequent Arctic fronts caused unusually cold weather. [[Boston]] had its coldest January since 1893 ({{convert|19.7|F|C|disp=or}}), when it averaged {{convert|20.7|F|C|disp=or}}, and its lowest mean maximum at {{convert|27.2|F|C|disp=or}}.

The French were severely injured by the winter, caused famine and 600,000 deaths by the end of 1710. William Derham recorded a low of −12 °C (10 °F) in Upminster, near London, on the night of 5 January 1709, the lowest he had ever measured since he started taking readings in 1697. It was revealed that the severe cold occurred during the time of low sunspot activity, known as the [[Maunder Minimum]]  Elsewhere in Europe the cold was much more intense, with temperatures reported as low as -17ºC in Venice (Italy), where most of the lagoon froze over, and -29ºC in Berlin (Germany), both significantly below modern records.

===17th century cold waves (1601–1699)===
* Europe winter of 1694-1695. See [[Maunder Minimum]]
* [[Great Frost of 1683–84]], the worst frost in England in its history. The cold caused the entire [[River Thames]] to freeze up to a depth of one foot. The frost enabled the first ever frost fair. See [[Maunder Minimum]]

A '''[[death]] by natural causes''', as recorded by [[coroner]]s and on [[death certificate]]s and associated documents, is the end result of an illness or an internal malfunction of the body not directly caused by external forces, typically due to [[old age]]. This is especially true when an elderly person has several different conditions or diseases, but where it appears that none of them alone or together may clearly lead to the death, and it is uncertain which condition was the final factor causing death. For example, a person dying from complications from [[influenza]] (an infection), a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]] (an internal body malfunction), or sudden [[heart failure]] would be listed as having died from natural causes. Health departments discourage listing [[old age]] as the [[cause of death]] because doing so does not benefit public health or medical research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Reporting Causes of Death for the Elderly|url=https://public.health.oregon.gov/BirthDeathCertificates/RegisterVitalRecords/Documents/Death/cdelderly.pdf|publisher=Oregon Health Authority|accessdate=15 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Old age is not a scientifically recognized cause of death; there is always a more direct cause, although it may be unknown in certain cases and could be one of a number of [[aging-associated diseases]].

==Terminology==
By contrast, death caused by active intervention is called [[unnatural death]]. The "unnatural" causes are usually given as [[accident]] (implying no unreasonable voluntary risk), [[Death by misadventure|misadventure]] (an accident following a willful and dangerous risk, which can include drug or alcohol overdose), [[suicide]], or [[homicide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bryant, Clifton D. | author-link= Clifton D. Bryant |title=Handbook of death &amp; dying |publisher=Sage Publications |location=Thousand Oaks |year=2003 |pages=968 |isbn=0-7619-2514-7 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some settings, other categories may be added. For example, a [[prison]] may track the deaths of [[Incarceration|inmate]]s caused by acute intoxication separately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Stark, Martha |title=A physician's guide to clinical forensic medicine |publisher=Humana Press |location=Totowa, NJ |year=2000 |pages=225 |isbn=0-89603-742-8 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, a cause of death can be recorded as "undetermined".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/2009/12/what_exactly_are_natural_causes.html |publisher=Slate.com |title=What, Exactly, Are "Natural Causes"? |author=Palmer, Brian |date= 21 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2978">Double billing refers to charging for the same product twice.

==Commerce==

In commerce, '''double billing''' is the error of charging a customer twice for the same unique product. This can occur due to a change in product name&lt;ref&gt;[http://listproc.ucdavis.edu/archives/law-lib/law-lib.log0302/0341.html Example of double billing when product name changed.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090905215309/http://listproc.ucdavis.edu/archives/law-lib/law-lib.log0302/0341.html |date=September 5, 2009 }} ucdavis.edu.&lt;/ref&gt; or due to a software error.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news-service.stanford.edu/news/1999/june2/bookstore-62.html Example of double billing due to software error] stanford.edu.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Law==

In [[law]], double billing refers to charging an hourly rate to two clients for the same time spent working. The [[American Bar Association]] prohibits double billing.&lt;ref&gt;Geraghty, Peter [http://www.abanet.org/cpr/about/billing_practices.html "When Two Plus Two Doesn't Equal Four"], abanet.org. Retrieved on 2007  June.&lt;/ref&gt; It is tantamount to overcharging, since the amount of time actually spent working on any one client's work is less than the amount billed to that client.

[[Associate attorney|Associates]] and [[Business partner|partners]] alike at large [[law firm]]s face significant pressure to double bill or to "pad" their hours in order to reduce overwork.&lt;ref&gt;Kuckes, Niki. [http://www.legalaffairs.org/issues/September-October-2002/review_kuckes_sepoct2002.msp "The Hours"], legalaffairs.org. Retrieved on 2009  May.&lt;/ref&gt; These attorneys are usually required to bill 1800 to 2000 hours per year. This can ideally work out to a 40-hour work week, but it is usually 60 or more, since most attorneys must spend around two hours in the office for every one that they can bill to a specific client. In 1998, [[Cameron Stracher]]'s book ''Double Billing''&lt;ref&gt;Stracher, Cameron ''Double Billing: A Young Lawyer's Tale Of Greed, Sex, Lies, And The Pursuit Of A Swivel Chair'' Harper Paperbacks, 1999. {{ISBN|978-0-688-17222-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggested that double billing is common in law firms, but that implication was misleading.&lt;ref&gt;Voorhees, John [http://www.denbar.org/docket/doc_articles.cfm?ArticleID=3513 "Double Billing Makes No Cents"], Denver Bar Association, 2001 April. Retrieved on 2007  June.&lt;/ref&gt; However, several recent studies suggest that at least 1/3 of lawyers admit that they double-bill clients on at least an occasional basis, and that more than half of lawyers do not believe that double billing constitutes an ethical violation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://litigationlimited.com/guide-to-law-firm-overbilling/ "Guide to Law Firm Overbilling"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120407022034/http://litigationlimited.com/guide-to-law-firm-overbilling/ |date=April 7, 2012 }}, litigation limited.com.

'''Edwin Bryant''' (August 21, 1805 – December 16, 1869) was a [[Kentucky]] newspaper editor whose popular 1848 book ''What I Saw in California'' describes his overland journey to California, his account of the infamous [[Donner Party]], and his term as second ''alcalde'', or pre-statehood mayor, of the city of San Francisco.

== Early life and newspaper career ==
Bryant was born in [[Pelham, Massachusetts]], the son of the first cousins Ichabod Bryant and Silence Bryant.  Bryant had an unhappy childhood and his father was frequently imprisoned for debt.  He lived with his uncle Bezabiel Bryant in [[Bedford (town), New York|Bedford, New York]].  He studied medicine under his uncle, Dr. Peter Bryant, father of the poet [[William Cullen Bryant]].&lt;ref name="Bryant1985"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Thomas D.

In December 1830, Bryant joined [[George D. Prentice]] as co-editor of the ''[[Louisville Journal]]'' in Kentucky.  Prentice, who had founded the newspaper only a month earlier, and Bryant penned blistering anti-[[Jacksonian democracy|Jacksonian]] editorials under the signatures "P" and "B".  Following a trip to [[Frankfort, Kentucky]] to report on the [[Kentucky General Assembly]], Bryant left the paper in May because it could not afford two editors.  Bryant partnered with N.L. Finnell to edit the newly founded ''[[Lexington Observer]]'', which a year later purchased and merged with the ''Kentucky Reporter'' (founded in 1807) to become the pro-[[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]] ''[[Lexington Observer and Reporter]]''.&lt;ref name="Daniels1971"/&gt;{{rp|29–30}}

Bryant was hired to edit the ''[[Lexington Intelligencer]]'' in 1834 and spent the next decade at the newspaper, eventually becoming its owner before selling it to John C. Noble.  Bryant penned frequent editorials, including editorials supporting the [[Nativist movement#Anti-Catholic nativism in the 19th century|anti-Catholic nativism movement]] and a series of racist attacks on [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Richard Mentor Johnson]] for his black [[common law wife]] and two mixed race daughters.  In 1844, at the urging of Whig politicians [[Henry Clay]] and [[John J. Crittenden]], Bryant and [[Walter Newman Haldeman]] founded another pro-Whig newspaper, the ''Louisville Daily Dime'', which was soon renamed the ''[[The Courier-Journal|Louisville Courier]]''.&lt;ref name="Daniels1971"/&gt;{{rp|30–31}}

== Expedition to California ==
Citing poor health and the desire to write a book about the experience, in 1846 Bryant left the fledgling ''Courier'' and embarked on an expedition to California.   Bryant and two others took a [[steamboat]] to [[Independence, Missouri]], where they joined a large party gathered by General [[William Henry Russell]] (1802-1873), Kentucky lawyer and grandson of General [[William Russell (Virginia)|William Russell]], which included former Missouri Governor [[Lilburn Boggs]] and future Oregon legislator [[Jesse Quinn Thornton]].  The party began the journey to California in May.  On the trail they were joined by a group of settlers who became the notorious [[Donner Party]] and attended the funeral of their first casualty, Sarah Keyes.&lt;ref name=Bryant1985 /&gt;{{rp|viii-x}}&lt;ref name="Daniels1971"/&gt;{{rp|31–35}}&lt;ref name="Rarick2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ethan Rarick|title=Desperate Passage:The Donner Party's Perilous Journey West|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R-iMMtwprxoC|accessdate=18 June 2013|date=4 January 2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-975670-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|23}}  Word of Bryant's limited medical experience had spread to other wagon trains and one enlisted him to help a ten-year-old boy with a crushed leg.  Bryant helped a [[droving|drover]] who had been a surgeon's assistant attempt an amputation with a handsaw, but the boy died during the primitive procedure.&lt;ref name="McLynn2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Frank McLynn|title=Wagons West: The Epic Story of America's Overland Trails|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J_3CdKUcXdgC&amp;pg=PA289|accessdate=18 June 2013|date=1 January 2004|publisher=GROVE/ATLANTIC Incorporated|isbn=978-0-8021-4063-0|page=289}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June, concerned about the slow pace of the wagon train, Bryant and a small group of others rode ahead on pack mules, leaving most of the other pioneers, including the Donner Party, behind.&lt;ref name=Bryant1985 /&gt;{{rp|x-xi}}  Bryant's group took the [[Hastings Cutoff]], a shorter but much rougher path that took them through the [[Great Salt Lake Desert]].  Bryant was concerned that the wagon train was unsuited for such a passage and wrote letters to James Reed and other members of the Donner Party to warn them away from the cutoff.  [[Jim Bridger]] had been heavily promoting the Cutoff to bring emigrants to [[Fort Bridger]], which the main route bypassed, and Bryant left his letters in the care of Bridger and [[Louis Vasquez]], founders of the trading post.  When the Donner Party arrived there, they did not receive Bryant's warning and proceeded down the Cutoff, a decision that led to their being stranded in the mountains that winter.&lt;ref name="Rarick2008"/&gt;{{rp|55–59}}&lt;ref name="McNeese2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Tim McNeese|title=The Donner Party: A Doomed Journey|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6vHo7ABurScC&amp;pg=PA58|accessdate=18 June 2013|date=1 February 2009|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-1-60413-025-6|pages=57–60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bryant arrived in San Francisco in September 1846 and soon involved himself in the affairs of [[Alta California]].  He volunteered to serve with Captain [[John C. Frémont]] and served as 1st Lieutenant of Company H under Robert T. Jacobs.  The next year, General [[Stephen W. Kearny]] appointed Bryant the second alcalde of San Francisco, a post in which he served from February to June 1847.  The post is a predecessor to that of [[Mayor of San Francisco]], but it also had judicial functions as well, and later in life Bryant was sometimes referred to as Judge Bryant.  One of Bryant's key acts was to arrange for the sale of 450 lots of publicly owned waterfront property to private buyers, and arranged to purchase fourteen lots for himself for $4000.   Originally intending to return home by sea, he accompanied General Kearny's overland party bringing Frémont east to stand trial for his actions in California.  Later in 1847 he testified at Frémont's [[court martial]].&lt;ref name=Daniels1971 /&gt;{{rp|36–39}}

In 1848, [[D. Appleton &amp; Company]] published ''What I Saw in California: Being the Journal of a Tour, by the Emigrant Route and South Pass of the Rocky Mountains, across the Continent of North America, the Great Desert Basin, and through California, in the Years 1846, 1847'', Bryant's account of his westward journey and his time in California.  Coinciding with westward expansion and the [[California Gold Rush]], Bryant's book became immensely popular and many emigrants and gold miners used Bryant's book as a guide. By 1850, there were seven editions printed in the United States, two in England, and one each in Sweden and France.  In 1849, with much ceremony he led a company of 48 on a brisk return trip to California, where he sold the lots he had purchased for $100,000.  He returned to Kentucky via [[Panama]] and [[New Orleans]].&lt;ref name=Bryant1985 /&gt;{{rp|xv-xviii}}&lt;ref name=Daniels1971 /&gt;{{rp|39–42}}

== Later life ==
Wealthy thanks to real estate profits, book royalties, and lecture tours, Bryant settled in the literary colony of [[Pewee Valley, Kentucky]].  He built a large two-story house called Oaklea, which later appeared in the Little Colonel stories of [[Annie Fellows Johnston]].  There he lived out the [[American Civil War]] in safety.&lt;ref name=Bryant1985 /&gt;{{rp|xviii-xix}}&lt;ref name=Daniels1971 /&gt;{{rp|42}}&lt;ref name="Marshall2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Anne Elizabeth Marshall|title=Creating a Confederate Kentucky: The Lost Cause and Civil War Memory in a Border State|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6NC-Yu-AHzgC&amp;pg=PA140|accessdate=18 June 2013|date=1 December 2010|publisher=Univ of North Carolina Press|isbn=978-0-8078-9936-6|page=140}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bryant made a final trip to California by railroad while in poor health in June 1869. In December, he was moved to the Willard Hotel in Louisville where he could be closer to medical assistance.  There, he died after jumping out of a window.&lt;ref name=Bryant1985 /&gt;{{rp|xix}}&lt;ref name=Daniels1971 /&gt;{{rp|42}}  Bryant's service was performed at [[Christ Church Cathedral (Louisville, Kentucky)|Christ Church Cathedral]] and his body spent the next twelve years in the public receiving vault of [[Cave Hill Cemetery]], until it was finally buried.  In 1888, a nephew and brother-in-law had the body exhumed and reburied in the Bryant family section of [[Spring Grove Cemetery]] in [[Cincinnati]].&lt;ref name=Bryant1985 /&gt;{{rp|xx}}

Bryant Street in San Francisco is named for him.&lt;ref name=SFMuseum&gt;[http://www.sfmuseum.org/street/stnames3.html Street Names, San Francisco Museum] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090314040129/http://www.sfmuseum.org/street/stnames3.html |date=March 14, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The {{nihongo|'''Fuji Long Distance Series'''|富士ロングディスタンスシリーズ|Fuji rongudisutansu shirīzu}} was a Japanese endurance championship which took place mainly at [[Fuji Speedway|Fuji International Speedway]].

The series began in 1977 and until 1984 was an independent championship with three rounds, all held at Fuji.&lt;ref name="WSPR"&gt;http://www.classicscars.com/wspr/results/fld/nf_fld_home.html&lt;/ref&gt; In the first two seasons the series was contested by [[Group 6 (racing)|Group 6]] two-seater racing cars, with some [[touring car racing|touring cars]] filling the grid. The Group 6 sportscars were soon replaced by [[Group 5 (racing)|Group 5]] silhouettes and 1983 saw the introduction of [[Group C]] and [[IMSA GTP]] [[sports prototype]]s cars.&lt;ref name="WSPR" /&gt; 
In 1985 the three Fuji races were incorporated into [[All Japan Sports Prototype Championship|All Japan Endurance Championship]]&lt;ref name="RSC"&gt;http://www.racingsportscars.com/championship/Fuji%20Long%20Distance%20Series.html&lt;/ref&gt; who already had a Fuji round known as ''WEC in Japan''. As a result, between 1985 and 1990 the Fuji Long Distance Series title was awarded counting the four Fuji rounds from the merged championship.&lt;ref name="WSPR" /&gt;

By 1991 the series was renamed '''Long Distance Series''' and counted all races from the All Japan championship,&lt;ref name="WSPR" /&gt; however the series ended after the 1992 season, when the JAF dissolved the [[All Japan Sports Prototype Championship]], ending Group C racing in Japan.&lt;ref name="RSC" /&gt;

The Fuji Long Distance Series was sanctioned by ''FISCO Club'' (currently known as ''Fuji Motorsports Club'') and, as a championship of entrants, the titles were awarded to teams.&lt;ref name="WSPR" /&gt;

'''Gerolamo Induno''' (13 December 1825 – 18 December 1890) was an Italian painter and soldier, best known for his military scenes. His older brother, [[Domenico Induno|Domenico]], was also a well-known artist and they often worked together.

==Biography==
He was born in Milan, where his father was a chef and butler at the Milanese court. He took his first formal art lessons at the [[Brera Academy]], where he studied with [[Luigi Sabatelli]] from 1839 to 1846.&lt;ref name="U"&gt;[http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/gerolamo-induno_(L'Unificazione)/ Biographical notes] from L'Unificazione (2011) @ [[Treccani]].&lt;/ref&gt; His first exhibit was in 1845; composed of portraits and a scene from ''[[The Betrothed (Manzoni novel)|The Betrothed]]'' by [[Alessandro Manzoni]] (now lost).&lt;ref name="D"&gt;[http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/gerolamo-induno_(Dizionario_Biografico)/ Biography and appreciation] form Dizionario Biorafico, (2004) @ Treccani.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1848, he and Domenico were participants in the [[Five Days of Milan]] and had to flee to avoid reprisals by the Austrian government. They spent two years in [[Ticino]], then returned and settled in Florence.&lt;ref name="D" /&gt; His brother went back to painting, but he enlisted in a volunteer regiment led by General [[Giacomo Medici (general)|Giacomo Medici]] and fought against the French during their [[Roman Republic (19th century)#French siege|siege of Rome]].&lt;ref name="U" /&gt; He also managed to produce numerous sketches of the war.

While engaged in the defense of the {{ill|Villa del Vascello|it}}, near [[Porta San Pancrazio]], he was stabbed with several bayonets and seriously wounded while leading a charge. After a long  recovery, he was able to return to Milan under the protection of Count [[Giulio Litta]], a composer and avid art collector. Because of his injuries, he was exempt from being inducted into the Austrian army and went to work in his brother's studio.&lt;ref name="D" /&gt; In the following years, he created many works based on the events of the [[Risorgimento]], as well as [[Genre art|genre]] works, influenced by his brother.

From 1854 to 1855, during the [[Crimean War]], he was back in uniform; this time with the [[Bersaglieri]] of [[Alessandro Ferrero La Marmora|Alessandro La Marmora]]. Once again, he made numerous sketches that were turned into paintings and lithographs. These included a depiction of the [[Battle of the Chernaya]] that was purchased by King [[Victor Emmanuel II of Italy|Victor Emmanuel II]].&lt;ref name="U" /&gt; Some of his works were exhibited at the [[Exposition Universelle (1855)|Exposition Universelle]] in Paris. In 1859, despite lingering health issues, he enlisted in the [[Hunters of the Alps]] and came to be recognized by [[Giuseppe Garibaldi|Garibaldi]] as the official painter of the Risorgimento, especially on matters of an official character.&lt;ref name="D" /&gt; His genre scenes became almost entirely devoted to military themes.

During the 1860s, in addition to his patriotic canvases, he created some large decorative works; including an allegory on Rome and Florence for the new [[Milano Centrale railway station]] (now demolished), and a curtain depicting the "{{ill|Plebisciti risorgimentali|it|lt=Plebiscite}} of Naples" for the theater in [[Gallarate]]. In 1861, he received a gold medal at an exhibition in Florence for his painting of the [[Battle of Magenta]], but gave it up in solidarity with the painters who had been overlooked.&lt;ref name="U" /&gt;

After unification had been achieved, his genre works tended to focus on scenes from the seventeenth century and he began to exhibit paintings on a wider variety of topics outside Italy, including Vienna (1873), Paris (1878), Antwerp (1885) and London (1888). His best-known work from this period is "A Game of Chess", a scene from a play of the same name by [[Giuseppe Giacosa]]. He died in Milan in 1890, after a long illness.

=== East Area Rapist (June 1976–July 1979) ===
[[File:EAR Sketches.jpg|thumb|alt=See caption|Three sketches on which the FBI focused when it reopened the case in June 2016]]
The Golden State Killer is believed to have moved to the [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]] area, progressing from burglary to rape in mid-1976. The crimes initially centered on the [[unincorporated area]]s of [[Carmichael, California|Carmichael]], [[Citrus Heights, California|Citrus Heights]] and [[Rancho Cordova, California|Rancho Cordova]], east of Sacramento.&lt;ref name=DNA /&gt; His initial ''modus operandi'' was to stalk middle-class neighborhoods at night in search of women who were alone in one-story homes, usually near a school, creek, trail or other open space that would provide a quick escape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2202&amp;dat=19770520&amp;id=npsyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=0OgFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1635,3262765 |title = Sacramento Is Up Tight Over Rapist and Threats |last =  |first =  |date = May 20, 1977 |work = [[The Gettysburg Times]] |page = 24 |access-date = March 22, 2017 |archive-url = https://archive.today/20171020223309/https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2202&amp;dat=19770520&amp;id=npsyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=0OgFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1635,3262765 |archive-date = October 20, 2017 |dead-url = yes |agency = [[Associated Press]] |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was seen a number of times, but always successfully fled; on one occasion, he shot and seriously wounded a young pursuer.&lt;ref name="sudden terror" /&gt;{{rp|187–188}}

Most victims had seen (or heard) a prowler on their property before the attacks, and many had experienced break-ins. Police believed that the offender had a pattern of conducting extensive [[reconnaissance]] on several homes in a targeted neighborhood before selecting one for attack. As part of his surveillance, he was known to look in the windows of future victims and prowl in the yards of homes for several nights before attacking. On a few occasions, it is believed that in the run-up to attacks the offender entered the homes of future victims to unlock windows, unload guns and plant ligatures for later use. He frequently called them before the attack, sometimes for months in advance, to learn their daily routines; he would sometimes hang up, pretend to have the wrong number, or (in calls after the attack) threaten to harm the victims again.&lt;ref name="Footsteps" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HearTheKiller"&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.lamag.com/thejump/hear-the-golden-state-killer/ |title = Hear the Golden State Killer |last1 = McNamara |first1 = Michelle |date = February 27, 2013 |work = Los Angeles |access-date = March 8, 2017 |archive-url = https://archive.today/20171020223446/http://www.lamag.com/thejump/hear-the-golden-state-killer/ |archive-date = October 20, 2017 |dead-url = no |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|East Area Rapist crimes – June 1976 to July 1979}}The rapist operated in [[Sacramento County, California|Sacramento County]] from the first attacks in June 1976 until May 1977. After a three-month gap, he struck in nearby [[San Joaquin County, California|San Joaquin County]] in September before returning to Sacramento for all but one of the next ten attacks. The rapist attacked five times during the summer of 1978 in [[Stanislaus County, California|Stanislaus]] and [[Yolo County, California|Yolo]] counties before disappearing again for three months. Attacks then moved primarily to [[Contra Costa County, California|Contra Costa County]] in October and lasted until July 1979.

=== {{anchor|Original Night Stalker|Original Night Stalker crimes – October 1979 to May 1986}}Original Night Stalker (October 1979–May 1986) ===

Shortly after a rape committed on July 5, the East Area Rapist moved to southern California and first struck in [[Santa Barbara County, California|Santa Barbara County]] in October. The attacks lasted until 1981 (with a lone 1986 attack), and took a darker turn as the rapist began to kill his victims. Only the couple in the first attack survived, alerting neighbors and forcing the intruder to flee; the other victims were murdered by gunshot or bludgeoning. Since the East Area Rapist was not linked to these crimes for decades, he was known as the Night Stalker in the area before being renamed the Original Night Stalker after [[Richard Ramirez]] received the former nickname.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

The southern California murders were not initially thought to be connected by investigators in their respective jurisdictions. A Sacramento detective strongly believed that the East Area Rapist was responsible for the Goleta attacks, but the Santa Barbara County Sheriff's Department attributed them to a local career criminal who was later murdered. Investigating the crimes not committed in Goleta caused local police to follow false leads related to men who were close to the female victims. One person, later cleared, was charged with two murders. The cases were linked almost entirely by DNA testing, many years later.&lt;ref name="sudden terror" /&gt;

== Suspect profile ==

=== Known physical characteristics ===

These physical characteristics are considered factual based on crime-scene evidence and nearly-universal agreement by victims and law enforcement:
* [[White people|White]] male
* About {{cvt|5|ft|10|in|m}} tall
* Slender, athletic build
* [[Shoe size#United States and Canada|Size 9]] to {{frac|9|1|2}} shoe
* [[ABO blood group system|Type A]] blood
* [[Forensic serology|Non-secretor]]: Sperm does not contain blood-group antigens.&lt;ref name="PsychologicalProfile"&gt;{{cite web |title = Criminal Investigative Analysis |url = http://www.aetv.com/cold_case_files/web_exclusives/ep46/nightstalkerprofile.pdf |publisher = A&amp;E |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121007011328/http://www.aetv.com/cold_case_files/web_exclusives/ep46/nightstalkerprofile.pdf |archivedate = October 7, 2012 |format = PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Physically agile and capable of sprinting, bicycling, and scaling fences

=== {{anchor|Probable physical characteristics}}Probable characteristics ===

These physical characteristics are considered probable; a small percentage of victims described the perpetrator differently:
* 18–25 years old when the rapes began in 1976; authorities believe him to be between 60 and 75 years old in 2018.&lt;ref name="crime q&amp;a" /&gt;
* Blond or brown hair
* Blue or light-colored eyes
* Penis size "small" or "smaller than average"

According to the Sacramento County Sheriff's Department, microscopic paint chips were found at three crime scenes (two homicides and a rape).&lt;ref name="Locke2013"&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.sacbee.com/news/local/article2578864.html |title = Investigators explore new leads in effort to identify East Area Rapist |last1 = Locke |first1 = Cathy |date = September 21, 2013 |work = The Sacramento Bee |access-date = October 30, 2017 |archive-url = https://archive.today/20171031003045/http://www.sacbee.com/news/local/article2578864.html |archive-date = October 31, 2017 |dead-url = yes |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that the Golden State Killer may have worked in construction, possibly using a paint spray gun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1 = Locke |first1 = Cathy |title = Could paint linked to East Area Rapist be traced to companies that sold or used it? |url = http://www.sacbee.com/news/local/crime/article199464804.html |access-date = February 10, 2018 |work = The Sacramento Bee |date = February 9, 2018 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20180210074518/http://www.sacbee.com/news/local/crime/article199464804.html |archivedate = February 10, 2018 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Construction work had been ongoing near the 1979 Goleta murder scene, and a cold-case investigator contacted the developer in 2013 to identify subcontractors working at the site and obtain employment records.&lt;ref name="Locke2013" /&gt;

=== {{anchor|Potential psychological profile}}Psychological profile ===

After criminologists matched [[serological]] evidence found at the southern California murder scenes, a speculative psychological profile of the Golden State Killer was compiled based on a probabilistic analysis. According to Leslie D'Ambrosia, primary author of the profile, the Golden State Killer probably had the following characteristics:&lt;ref name="PsychologicalProfile" /&gt;
* An emotional age equivalent to a 26- to 30-year-old at the time the murders began in 1979
* Engaged in [[Paraphilia|paraphilic]] behavior and brutal sex in his personal life
* Engaged in sex with prostitutes
* Had some knowledge of police investigative methods and evidence-gathering techniques
* Sexually functional, capable of ejaculation with consenting and non-consenting partners
* Dressed well and would not stand out in upscale neighborhoods
* Lived or worked near Ventura, California, in 1980
* Good physical condition
* Skilled, experienced [[cat burglar]], and may have begun as such
* Had a criminal record as a teenager which was [[Expungement|expunged]]
* Had some means of income, but did not work in the early-morning hours
* Hated women for actual (or perceived) wrongs
* If married, probably had a submissive spouse who tolerated his sexually-deviant behavior
* Intelligent and articulate
* Probably began as a [[voyeur]] in his late teens or early twenties
* Neat and well-organized in his personal life, and drove a well-maintained car
* Peeped in the windows of many people who were not attacked
* Possibly unmarried, and did not enter into long-term relationships
* Self-assured and confident
* Would continue committing violent crimes until incapacitated by prison, death, or other intervention
* Would have been described by those who knew him as arrogant, domineering, manipulative, and a chronic liar

In addition to outlining the Golden State Killer's characteristics, the profile speculates that he might have been incarcerated after Janelle Cruz's murder or killed in the commission of a similar crime; however, the latter is unlikely since he contacted victims as late as 2001. Regardless, the profile recommends that law-enforcement agencies investigate attempted late-1980s [[Hot prowl burglary|hot prowl burglaries]] which resulted in the death of a lone male offender. It indicates a slight chance that the Golden State Killer committed suicide; he is unlikely to be confined in a mental institution.&lt;ref name="PsychologicalProfile" /&gt;

According to the profile, [[teleprinter]] bulletins were broadcast to law-enforcement agencies throughout the United States after the original homicides. The bulletins requested information on similar home invasions involving sexual assault, murder, bludgeoning, multiple victims, and bondage. {{as of|2015}}, no similar crimes have been reported. The profile posits that the Golden State Killer could have continued committing his crimes in another country whose records were not linked.&lt;ref name="PsychologicalProfile" /&gt;

All those mortal's surviving birth / Upon facing maturity,
Take inventory of their worth / To prevailing society.
Choosing values becomes a task; / Oneself must seek satisfaction.
The selected route will unmask / Character when plans take action.
Accepting some work to perform / At fixed pay, but promise for more,
Is a recognized social norm, / As is decorum, seeking lore.
Achieving while others lifting / Should be cause for deserving fame.
Leisure tempts excitement seeking, / What's right and expected seems tame.
"Jessie James" has been seen by all, / And "Son of Sam" has an author.
Others now feel temptations call. / Sacramento should make an offer.
To make a movie of my life / That will pay for my planned exile.
Just now I' d like to add the wife / Of a Mafia lord to my file.
Your East Area Rapist
And deserving pest.
See you in the press or on T.V.&lt;ref name="sudden terror" /&gt;{{rp|p. 304}}&lt;/poem&gt;}}

==== "I'm the East Side Rapist" (March 18, 1977) ====
On March 18, 1977, the Sacramento County Sheriff's Office received three calls from a man claiming to be the East Area Rapist; none were recorded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1 = Winters |first1 = Kat |title = Attack #15 |url = https://www.coldcase-earons.com/15.php |website = coldcase-earons.com |access-date = January 13, 2018 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20180425103537/http://www.coldcase-earons.com/15.php |archivedate = April 25, 2018 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first two calls, received at 4:15 and 4:30&amp;nbsp;p.m., were identical and ended with the caller laughing and hanging up. The final call came in at 5:00&amp;nbsp;p.m., with the caller saying: "I'm the East Side Rapist and I have my next victim already stalked and you guys can't catch me."

==== "Never gonna catch me" (December 2, 1977) ====
A man claiming to be the rapist called the Sacramento Police, saying: "You're never gonna catch me, East Area Rapist, you dumb fuckers, I'm gonna fuck again tonight. Careful!" The call was recorded and later released.&lt;ref name="HearTheKiller" /&gt; Similarly to the previous call, the East Area Rapist attacked his next victim the same night.

==== "Merry Christmas" (December 9, 1977) ====
A previous victim received a phone call during the 1977 Christmas season which she attributed to her attacker. The caller said, "Merry Christmas, it's me again!"&lt;ref name="sudden terror" /&gt;{{rp|301}}

==== "Watt Avenue" (December 10, 1977) ====
Shortly before 10:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. on the night of December 10, 1977, dispatchers from the County of Sacramento's Sheriff's Department and the City of Sacramento's Police Department received identical calls saying: "I am going to hit tonight. Watt Avenue." Both were reportedly recorded, and the caller was identified as the same person who placed the December 2 call. Law-enforcement patrols were increased that night in response,&lt;ref name="sudden terror" /&gt; and at 2:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. sheriff's deputies spotted a masked man bicycling on the Watt Avenue bridge; he eluded them. He was located again at 4:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. by city police. He discarded the bike, which was determined to have been stolen in [[Redding, California]],&lt;ref name="Sacramento Bee no. 1" /&gt; and fled on foot.

==== "Gonna kill you" (January 2, 1978) ====
The first known rape victim received a wrong-number call asking for "Ray" on January 2, 1978.

In 1982, a previous victim who was working at a [[Denny's]] restaurant received a call at work from the rapist during which he said that he would rape her again.

Before officially connecting the Original Night Stalker to the East Area Rapist in 2001, some law-enforcement officials (particularly from the [[Sacramento County Sheriff's Department]]) sought to link the Goleta cases as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = https://coldcase-earons.com/1980-03-13.pdf |title = Police Debate Tie Between East Area Rapist, Killings |last1 = Wilson |first1 = Wayne |date = March 13, 1980 |work = The Sacramento Bee |access-date = October 7, 2017 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20171008030636/https://coldcase-earons.com/1980-03-13.pdf |archivedate = October 8, 2017 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = https://coldcase-earons.com/1980-02-16.pdf |title = Link to East Area Rapist Probed in Couples' Slaying |last1 = Wilson |first1 = Wayne |date = February 26, 1980 |work = The Sacramento Bee |access-date = October 7, 2017 |page = B1 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20171008030325/https://coldcase-earons.com/1980-02-16.pdf |archivedate = October 8, 2017 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The links were primarily due to similarities in ''modus operandi''. One of the already-linked Original Night Stalker double murders occurred in Ventura, {{convert|40|mi}} southeast of Goleta, and the remaining murders were committed in Orange County—an additional {{convert|90|mi}} southeast. In 2001, several rapes in Contra Costa County believed to have been committed by the East Area Rapist were linked by DNA to the Smith, Harrington, Whithuhn, and Cruz murders. A decade later, DNA evidence indicated that the Domingo–Sanchez murders were committed by the Golden State Killer.&lt;ref name="sudden terror" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2011/05/goleta-slayings-serial-killer.html |title = 30-year-old slayings of Goleta couple linked to serial killer |last1 = Chawkins |first1 = Steve |date = May 5, 2011 |work = Los Angeles Times |access-date = October 7, 2015 |archive-url = https://archive.today/20120710223106/http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2011/05/goleta-slayings-serial-killer.html |archive-date = July 10, 2012 |dead-url = yes |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Suspects ==

During the investigation, several people were considered and eliminated as suspects:
* Brett Glasby, from Goleta, was considered a suspect by Santa Barbara County investigators. He was murdered in Mexico in 1982 (before the murder of Janelle Cruz), eliminating him as a suspect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title = Hunting a Psychopath |last = Shelby |first = Richard |publisher =  |year = 2016 |isbn =  |edition = Second |location =  |pages = 392–393 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Paul "Cornfed" Schneider, a high-ranking member of the [[Aryan Brotherhood]]. Schneider was a career criminal, living in [[Orange County, California]], when the murders of the Harringtons, Manuela Witthuhn, and Janelle Cruz were committed. During the late 1990s, while being an inmate at [[Pelican Bay State Prison]] in [[Crescent City, California]], Schneider provided a DNA sample&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url = http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Court-says-inmate-must-give-DNA-Suspect-in-2845640.php |title = Court says inmate must give DNA / Suspect in 20-year-old murders |last = Goodyear |first = Charlie |date = April 25, 2002 |work = San Francisco Chronicle |access-date = December 8, 2017 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180105214004/http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Court-says-inmate-must-give-DNA-Suspect-in-2845640.php |archive-date = January 5, 2018 |dead-url =  |last2 = Hallissy |first2 = Erin }}&lt;/ref&gt; which cleared him.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news |url = https://www.coldcase-earons.com/2002-07-03.pdf |title = DNA Tests Clear Convict in Ventura Killings Paul Schneider Didn't Kill Attorney Lyman Smith, Wife |last = Cason |first = Colleen |date = July 3, 2002 |work = Ventura Star |access-date = August 29, 2017 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170830010353/https://www.coldcase-earons.com/2002-07-03.pdf |archivedate = August 30, 2017 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Joe Alsip, a friend and business partner of victim Lyman Smith. Alsip had visited the Smiths' home the day before Lyman and Charlene Smith were murdered, and Alsip's pastor said that he had confessed to him during a family-counseling session. Although the reported confession was considered dubious by the Ventura County District Attorney's Office, Alsip was arraigned for the Smith murders in 1982. After the [[preliminary hearing]] the charges against him were dropped,&lt;ref name="coldcase-earons2002"&gt;{{cite web |last1 = Cason |first1 = Colleen |title = The Silent Witness |url = http://www.coldcase-earons.com/2002-Cason-SilentWitness.pdf |publisher = Ventura County Star |accessdate = May 12, 2018 |date = November 28, 2002 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20180425103545/http://www.coldcase-earons.com/2002-Cason-SilentWitness.pdf |archivedate = April 25, 2018 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title = Hunting a Psychopath |last = Shelby |first = Richard |publisher =  |year = 2016 |isbn =  |edition = Second |location =  |page = 406 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and his innocence was confirmed by DNA testing in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work = Ventura County Star |date = October 8, 2000 |url = http://www.coldcase-earons.com/2000-10-08.pdf |title = DNA Findings Throw New Light on Old Case By |author = Miller, Aron |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20180308041636/http://www.coldcase-earons.com/2000-10-08.pdf |archivedate = March 8, 2018 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2002, journalist Colleen Cason wrote a newspaper series about the murders for the ''Ventura County Star''.&lt;ref name="coldcase-earons2002" /&gt; According to Cason, Detective Larry Pool of the [[Orange County Sheriff's Department (California)|Orange County Sheriff's Department]] visited California's Death Row at [[San Quentin State Prison|San Quentin]] in an attempt to locate the Golden State Killer; Pool suspected that the killer had been captured and sentenced to death for another violent crime. However, no genetic samples collected from Death Row inmates matched the DNA of the Golden State Killer.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

His employment history for the next decade is unknown.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; From 1990 until his retirement in 2017, DeAngelo was a truck mechanic at the Roseville distribution center for [[Save Mart Supermarkets]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.sacbee.com/latest-news/article209862599.html |title = Here's where East Area Rapist suspect worked for nearly three decades before retiring |last = Lillis |first = Ryan |work = The Sacramento Bee |date = April 25, 2018 |accessdate = April 26, 2018 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20180426061346/http://www.sacbee.com/latest-news/article209862599.html |archivedate = April 26, 2018 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; DeAngelo was living in Citrus Heights with a daughter and granddaughter at the time of his arrest.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; His [[in-law|brother-in-law]], James Huddle, said that DeAngelo casually brought up the East Area Rapist in conversation around the time of the original crimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.oxygen.com/joseph-james-deangelo-golden-state-killer-relative-rapes |title = Joseph James DeAngelo, Golden State Killer Suspect, Once Asked Relative About Serial Rapes |last = Silverstein |first = Jason |website = Oxygen.com |date = April 25, 2018 |access-date = April 26, 2018 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20180426023130/http://www.oxygen.com/joseph-james-deangelo-golden-state-killer-relative-rapes |archivedate = April 26, 2018 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Neighbors reported that DeAngelo frequently engaged in loud, [[profanity|profane]] outbursts.&lt;ref name="What We Know" /&gt;

=== Legal proceedings ===
DeAngelo cannot be charged with rapes due to the statue of limitations expiring for those offenses, but he has been charged with 13 counts of murder and also is being charged with 13 counts of kidnapping. DeAngelo returned to court on July 12, 2018. Appearing again before Judge Michael Sweet, DeAngelo was shackled inside the courtroom holding area throughout the duration of the proceedings. Later, on August 13, 2018, Tulare County Sheriff's Office held a press conference to announce that they will be charging DeAngelo for the September 11, 1975 murder of Claude Snelling in Visalia.

On August 21, 2018 at 11:00 AM, a coalition of district attorneys appeared together to issue statements to the press. Presenting together were Contra Costa County DA, Diana Becton, Orange County DA, Tony Rackauckas, Sacramento County DA, Anne Marie Schubert, Santa Barbara County DA, Joyce E. Dudley, Tulare County DA, Tim Ward, Ventura County DA, Gregory D. Totten, and Lisa Bartlett, Supervisor of the 5th District (where the Orange County murders took place). This group of officials is in charge of prosecuting the case against DeAngelo, the alleged Golden State Killer. He was arraigned in Sacramento on August 23, 2018. Several DAs involved in the case were present in the courtroom, and members of the public were allowed to attend. In the gallery were several survivors, family members, and witnesses who will be participating in the upcoming series of preliminary hearings, many of whom gave interviews to the media at the conclusion of court business.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://goldenstatekillertrial.com | title=Golden State Killer Trial – the Trial of Joseph DeAngelo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Great Forest Park Balloon Race''' is an annual [[hot air balloon festival]] held in [[Forest Park (St. Louis, Missouri)|Forest Park]] in [[St. Louis, Missouri]]. With more than 70 entrants and 130,000 spectators, it is the most well-attended single-day hot air balloon race in the United States.&lt;ref name="racehist"&gt;[http://www.greatforestparkballoonrace.com/history.htm Great Forest Park Balloon Race: History].&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The first race was launched by Nikki Caplan and John O'Toole in December 1973 at a gathering of six balloons and twenty spectators.&lt;ref name="loc"&gt;[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/diglib/legacies/MO/200003213.html Library of Congress: Balloon Race].&lt;/ref&gt; In 1977, organization of the race passed from Caplan and O'Toole to a group of four novice balloonists who continue to coordinate the event today. These men are John Marlow, John Schaumburg, Ted Staley, and Dan Schettler, who formed a ballooning group known as the Mississippi River Balloon Transit Company. This company now is the host of the largest and most well attended balloon race.&lt;ref name="racehist"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mississippi River Balloon Transit|title=Great Forest Park Balloon Race|url=http://www.greatforestparkballoonrace.com/|accessdate=2011-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 23, 2000, the race was honored by the American Folklife Center at the [[Library of Congress]] as a local legacy after a nomination by then-[[Minority leader of the United States House of Representatives]] [[Dick Gephardt]].&lt;ref name="racehist"/&gt;&lt;ref name="loc"/&gt; So now, the Great Forest Park Balloon Race is forever documented through photographs, advertisements, media, and pilot rewards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mississippi River Balloon Transit Company|title=History of the Race|url=http://www.greatforestparkballoonrace.com/history.htm|accessdate=2011-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current status==
[[File:St. Louis Forest Park Ballon Glow -Sep 05.jpg|thumb|Balloon Glow in September 2005]]
On the day before the race, the [[hot air balloons]] participate in the Balloon Glow, a [[night glow]] opportunity for spectators to walk among inflated balloons illuminated by their burners.&lt;ref name="racesched"&gt;[http://www.greatforestparkballoonrace.com/schedule.htm Great Forest Park Balloon Race: Schedule].{{verify credibility|date=August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the Balloon Glow and a [[fireworks]] show, during the week of the event, a free public orchestral concert by the [[Saint Louis Symphony Orchestra]] is held on nearby Art Hill, adjacent to the [[Saint Louis Art Museum]]. During the race, the balloonists attempt to "chase" a 166-foot balloon of a pink bunny after taking off from the Central Fields in Forest Park.&lt;ref name="slfp"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slfp.com/ETC-BalloonRace.htm|publisher=St. Louis Front Page|date=September 19, 2009|title=Great Forest Park Balloon Race - Energizer Bunny Birthday Celebration Takes the Cake|last=Moore|first=Betty|accessdate=July 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal is to follow the bunny until it lands, and then each pilot drops a sandbag or birdseed bag as close as possible to the bunny balloon. The winner is decided based on which pilots's sandbag, or birdseed bag, is the closest to the bunny.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mississippi RIver Balloon Transit Company|title=Race Schedule|url=http://www.greatforestparkballoonrace.com/schedule.htm|accessdate=2011-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Due to its urban location in the city of St. Louis, the race is considered "particularly prestigious and challenging", and participation is by invitation only. At times, landing sites have included backyards, baseball diamonds, golf courses, street intersections, and the convent grounds of the [[School Sisters of Notre Dame]].&lt;ref name="loc"/&gt; The balloon race is accompanied by a festival that includes food and drink, [[inflatable castle]]s, and a [[climbing wall]].&lt;ref name="slfp"/&gt;

The '''Great Storm of 1987''' was a violent [[extratropical cyclone]] that occurred on the night of 15–16 October, with hurricane-force winds causing casualties in [[England]], [[France]] and the [[Channel Islands]] as a severe depression in the [[Bay of Biscay]] moved northeast. Among the most damaged areas were [[Greater London]], the [[East Anglia]]n coast, the [[Home Counties]], the west of [[Brittany]] and the [[Cotentin Peninsula]] of [[Normandy]] which weathered gusts typically with a [[return period]] of 1 in 200 years.&lt;ref name="Vidal" &gt;{{cite news|last=Vidal|first=John|title=Sting jet technology means no more hurricane mishaps for Michael Fish|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/oct/16/sting-jets-hurricane-michael-fish|accessdate=8 December 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=16 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UKMOBlog" &gt;{{cite news|title=How did the ‘Great Storm’ of 1987 develop?|url=http://metofficenews.wordpress.com/tag/sting-jet/|accessdate=8 December 2012|newspaper=Met Office News Blog|date=10 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Forests, parks, roads and railways were strewn with fallen trees as well as schools being closed. The British [[National Grid (Great Britain)|National Grid]] suffered heavy damage, leaving thousands without power.

That day's weather reports had failed to indicate a storm of such severity, an earlier, correct forecast having been negated by later projections. The apparent suggestion by the BBC's [[Michael Fish]] of a false alarm is celebrated as a classic gaffe, though he claims he was misquoted.&lt;ref name="Fish" &gt;{{cite news|title=Great Storm of 1987: Michael Fish's 'white lie'|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-19923565|accessdate=8 December 2012|newspaper=BBC News|date=15 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The storm has been termed a [[weather bomb]] due to its rapid development.&lt;ref name=“veconomist” &gt;{{cite news|author=|title=Ophelia’s strange path|url=https://www.economist.com/news/science-and-technology/21730329-unusual-storm-eastern-atlantic-ophelias-strange-path|work=[[The Economist]]|date=16 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the Sunday before the storm struck, the farmers' forecast had predicted bad weather on the following Thursday or Friday, 15–16 October.&lt;ref name="Houghton" &gt;{{cite journal|last=Houghton|first=J. T.|title=The Storm, The Media and the Enquiry|journal=Weather|volume=43|pages=67–70|doi=10.1002/j.1477-8696.1988.tb03883.x|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/j.1477-8696.1988.tb03883.x/abstract|accessdate=9 February 2013|bibcode = 1988Wthr...43...67H }}&lt;/ref&gt; By midweek, however, guidance from [[numerical weather prediction|weather prediction models]] was somewhat equivocal. Instead of stormy weather over a considerable part of the UK, the models suggested that severe weather would reach no farther north than the [[English Channel]] and coastal parts of southern England.&lt;ref name="Houghton" /&gt;

During the afternoon of 15 October, winds were very light over most parts of the UK. The pressure gradient was slack. A depression was drifting slowly northwards over the North Sea off eastern Scotland. A [[Trough (meteorology)|trough]] lay over England, Wales and Ireland. Over the [[Bay of Biscay]], a depression was developing.&lt;ref name="BurtMansfield" &gt;{{cite journal|last=Burt|first=S. D.|author2=Mansfield, D.

=== First warnings ===
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2017}}
The first gale warnings for sea areas in the English Channel were issued at 0630 UTC on 15 October and were followed, four hours later, by warnings of severe gales.
At 1200 UTC on 15 October, the depression which originated in the Bay of Biscay was centred near 46° N, 9° W and its depth was 970 mb. By 1800 UTC, it had moved north-east to about 47° N, 6° W, and deepened to 964 mb.

At 2235 UTC, winds of [[Beaufort scale|Force 10]] were forecast. By midnight, the depression was over the western English Channel, and its central pressure was 953 mb. At 0140 on 16 October, warnings of Force 11 were issued. The depression now moved rapidly north-east, filling a little as it did, reaching the [[Humber Estuary]] at about 0530 UTC, by which time its central pressure was 959 mb. Dramatic increases in temperature were associated with the passage of the storm's warm front.

In the sea areas, warnings of severe weather were both timely and adequate, although forecasts for land areas left much to be desired.
During the evening of 15 October, radio and TV forecasts mentioned strong winds, but indicated that heavy rain would be the main feature, rather than wind. By the time most people went to bed, exceptionally strong winds had not been mentioned in national radio and TV weather broadcasts.

Warnings of severe weather had been issued, however, to various agencies and emergency authorities, including the [[London Fire Brigade]]. Perhaps the most important warning was issued by the [[Met Office]] to the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] (MoD) at 0135 UTC, 16 October. It warned that the anticipated consequences of the storm were such that civil authorities might need to call on assistance from the military.

===Winds===
[[File:Storm damaged building - Barton on Sea - October 1987.jpg|thumb|275px|right|Storm damaged building, [[Barton on Sea]] in Hampshire]]
A highest gust of {{convert|119|kn|km/h mph|abbr=on}} is estimated from satellite data at [[Quimper]], Brittany, with the highest measured gust at {{convert|117|kn|km/h mph|abbr=on}} at Pointe du Roc, [[Granville, Manche|Granville]] Normandy.&lt;ref name="MOstudent" &gt;{{cite web|title=The Great Storm of 1987|url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/education/secondary/students/1987.html|publisher=Met Office|accessdate=6 January 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907191422/http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/education/secondary/students/1987.html|archivedate=7 September 2008|location=Wayback Machine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In south-east England, where the greatest damage occurred, gusts of {{convert|70|kn|lk=in}} or more were recorded continually for three or four consecutive hours.
During this time, the wind veered from southerly to south-westerly. To the north-west of this region, there were two maxima in gust speeds, separated by a period of lower wind speeds. During the first period, the wind direction was southerly. During the latter, it was south-westerly. Damage patterns in south-east England suggested that tornadoes accompanied the storm.

In the UK, winds at [[Shoreham-by-Sea]], Sussex reached {{convert|100|kn|km/h mph|abbr=on}} before the [[anemometer]] failed.&lt;ref name="MOstudent" /&gt;&lt;ref name="stingflyer" &gt;{{cite web|title=The 1987 Great Storm – What is a Sting Jet?|url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/news/in-depth/1987-great-storm/sting-jet|publisher=Met Office|accessdate=27 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Sting Jet Forecasting the damaging winds in European Cyclones|url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/media/pdf/2/p/Sting_Jet_Flyer.PDF|publisher=Met Office|accessdate=27 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many anemometers were reliant on mains power, and ceased recording as the south east of the United Kingdom was blacked-out by power cuts, thus losing much valuable data.&lt;ref name="BurtMansfield" /&gt;
Winds with an estimated 200-year [[return period]] hit the counties of Kent, Sussex, Hampshire and along the coastal strip of Essex, Suffolk and South Eastern Norfolk.&lt;ref name="BurtMansfield" /&gt; North of a line from [[Portland Bill]], Dorset to [[Cromer]], Norfolk the return period of the respective gusts were under 10 years.&lt;ref name="BurtMansfield" /&gt;

Sustained winds speeds greater than 75&amp;nbsp;mph were recorded for over an hour in southern Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cornwall/content/articles/2007/10/12/great_storm_feature.shtml|title= The 1987 Great Storm|author=David Braine|work=BBC|date=12 December 2007|accessdate=25 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Beaufort scale]] of wind intensities, this [[European windstorm|storm]] had winds of hurricane force 12 (73&amp;nbsp;mph or greater); as the term ''[[hurricane]]'' refers to [[tropical cyclone]]s originating in the North Atlantic or North Pacific, the descriptor "great storm" has tended to be reserved for those storms in recent years reaching this velocity. Hurricanes have a very different wind profile and distribution from storms, and significantly higher precipitation levels.

==Impact==

===United Kingdom===
[[File:Aftermath of the Great Storm of 1987.jpg|thumb|275px|right|Storm damage in London]]
The storm made landfall in [[Cornwall]], and tracked north-east towards [[Devon]] and then over the [[English Midlands|Midlands]], going out to sea via [[The Wash]]. The strongest gusts, of up to {{convert|100|kn|lk=in}}, were recorded along the south-eastern edge of the storm, hitting mainly [[Hampshire]], Sussex, [[Essex]] and [[Kent]]. The [[Royal Sovereign lighthouse]] {{convert|6|mi}} off [[Eastbourne]] recorded wind speeds on its instruments at the highest velocity it could measure, {{convert|110|mph|abbr=on}}.

The storm caused substantial damage over much of England, felling an estimated 15&amp;nbsp;million trees&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/gardening/3344946/The-Great-Storm-of-1987-remembered.html|title=The Great Storm of 1987 remembered|last=Richardson|first=Tim|date=12 October 2007|publisher=Daily Telegraph|accessdate=6 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; (including six of the seven eponymous oaks in [[Sevenoaks]],&lt;ref&gt;

Fallen trees blocked roads and railways and left widespread structural damage primarily to windows and roofs. Several hundred thousand people were left without power, not fully restored until more than two weeks later. Local electric utility officials later said they lost more wires in the storm than in the preceding decade. At sea, as well as many [[RNLB Keith Anderson (ON 1106)#The Great Storm of 1987 and the rescue of the "La Francoise"|small boats]] being wrecked, a [[Sealink]] cross-channel ferry, the [[MV Agios Georgios|MV ''Hengist'']], was driven ashore at [[Folkestone]] and the bulk carrier MV ''Sumnea'' capsized at [[Dover]], Kent.&lt;ref name=Times171087&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Wasted warning of the storm |author=Tony Dawe, Robert Matthews and Nicholas Wood |day_of_week=Saturday |date=17 October 1987 |page_number=1 |issue=62902 |column=A-H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Grid sustained heavy damage during the event, as crashing cables short-circuited, which in some cases overheated the main system. Its headquarters faced the choice of keeping the Grid online to help London as the storm approached but risk an incremental system breakdown, failure and burnout, or to shut down most of South East England including London and avert that risk.  The headquarters made the decision, the first one like it since before [[World War II]]: to shut down the South East power systems to maintain the network as soon as signs of overheating began.{{verification needed|date=October 2013}}

In London, many of the [[avenue (landscape)|trees lining streets]], particularly [[plane trees]], were blown down overnight, blocking roads and crushing parked cars. Building construction scaffolding and billboards collapsed in many places, and many buildings were damaged. The following morning, the BBC's largest broadcasting site, [[Lime Grove Studios]] in [[White City, London|White City]], was unable to function due to a power failure &amp;mdash; [[ITV (TV channel)|ITV]]'s [[TV-am]] and [[BBC One|BBC1]]'s ''[[Breakfast Time]]'' programmes were broadcast from different emergency facilities in emergency formats. TV-am broadcast from [[Thames Television]]'s Euston Road studios, while BBC newsreader [[Nicholas Witchell]] had to broadcast from the BBC1 continuity studio at [[BBC Television Centre]], with the wall decorations used for [[CBBC|Children's BBC]] hastily taken down. Much of the [[public transport]] in the capital was not functioning, and people were advised against trying to go to work. TV-am host [[Anne Diamond]] did go back to the regular TV-am studio with reporter [[Kay Burley]], whilst [[Richard Keys]] remained in the Thames Television studio in case the power supply situation became even worse, and indeed, power did go back down at around 8:15am.

===France===
The [[Departments of France|départements]] of [[Finistère]], [[Morbihan]], [[Côtes-d'Armor]] and [[Ille-et-Vilaine]] in Brittany, and the [[Cotentin Peninsula]] ([[Manche]] and part of [[Calvados (department)|Calvados]]) in [[Normandy]] were the areas in France most affected by the storm, which followed a line from Morbihan and Rennes to Deauville.&lt;ref name="alertes-meteo.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alertes-meteo.com/tempete/tempete_1987.htm |title= L'Ouest balayé par un ouragan dévastateur (the West swept up by a devastating hurricane)|author= |work= |publisher= Météo France (government organisation)|accessdate=|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1.79 million homes were left without electricity supply and water, and a quarter of Brittany's forest was destroyed. The total damage was estimated at [[French Franc|₣]]23 billion.

[[Météo France]] announced "{{lang|fr|une petite tempête en provenance des Açores}}" (a little storm coming in from the Azores), which reached Brittany's coast at about 18:00, later than expected. This depression caused little damage, with only {{convert|50|to|60|km/h|mph kn|abbr=on}} winds. A much deeper depression hit [[Ushant]] on the extreme western tip of Brittany at midnight. It was measured at 948 hPa (or 948 mb) at the [[Brest, France|Brest]]-Guipavas weather station, the lowest reading in its records dating back to 1945.&lt;ref name="alertes-meteo.com"/&gt;

Weather stations on the coast at [[pointe du Raz]], [[pointe Saint-Mathieu]] and [[Penmarch]] gave no readings, as they were damaged by the high winds. The wind speed measured at Brest was {{convert|148|km/h|mph kn|abbr=on}}. The centre of the storm crossed Brittany from [[Penmarch]] to [[Saint-Brieuc]] at {{convert|110|km/h|mph kn|abbr=on}}, with gusts of wind up to {{convert|187|km/h|mph kn|abbr=on}} at [[Quimper, Finistère|Quimper]], {{convert|200|km/h|mph kn|abbr=on}} at Ouessant and {{convert|220|km/h|mph kn|abbr=on}} at la pointe de Penmarch and [[Granville, Manche|Granville]]. Waves were measured at {{convert|16|m|abbr=on}} off Ushant and [[Belle Île]].&lt;ref name="alertes-meteo.com"/&gt;

Similar strength storms in France since 1960: 
*Tempête Vivian in 1990 (generally milder)
*[[Cyclones Lothar and Martin]] in December 1999, which claimed 140 lives, equally severe in Germany, more southern neighbouring countries also saw multiple deaths.
*[[Cyclone Klaus]] which struck worse southern France and northern Spain in 2009 and claimed 26 lives.

The church at [[Concarneau]] was damaged but never rebuilt, and was finally demolished a few years later.

The [[MS Herald of Free Enterprise|MS ''Herald of Free Enterprise'']] was caught in the storm off [[Cape Finisterre]] as it was making its way for scrapping in Taiwan. The ship was cast adrift after its tow rope parted, finally resuming its journey on 19 October 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gripper|first1=Ann|title=UK weather: A look back at the devastating Great Storm of 1987 that nobody predicted|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/uk-weather-look-back-devastating-1380404|accessdate=30 May 2015|publisher=Daily Mirror|date=25 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
The storm cost the insurance industry £2 billion, making it the second most expensive UK weather event on record to insurers after the [[Burns' Day Storm]] of 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = UK storm payout 'may hit £350m' | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/6380123.stm | work = [[BBC News]] | publisher = [[bbc.co.uk]] | date = 20 February 2007 | accessdate = 20 February 2007 | quote = The 'great storm' of 1987, which cost the industry £2bn, was the second most expensive.
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peak wind velocities were in the early hours of the morning, which may have helped reduce the death toll. 
The storm hit the [[Isle of Wight]] at 02:00. [[Shanklin]] Pier on the south-east coast of the island was broken into three pieces as a result of mountainous waves. Plans to rebuild the pier were soon abandoned, and the rest of the pier was demolished by contractors shortly afterwards. A monument now stands in front of what used to be the pier entrance.

A great deal of effort and money was put into the post-storm clean-up of forests and wooded areas. The writer [[Oliver Rackham]] and the charity [[Common Ground (United Kingdom)|Common Ground]] were active in trying to prevent unnecessary destruction of trees which, although fallen, were still living.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/main.jhtml?xml=/earth/2007/10/13/eastorm113.xml&amp;page=1  |title=1987 Great Storm: Terrible blow, not a knockout | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | first=Jack | last=Watkins | date=13 October 2007 | accessdate=4 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oliver Rackham, ''Trees &amp; Woodland in the British Landscape'' p. 202–3 (Dent, 1990)&lt;/ref&gt; Some landowners, such as the [[National Trust]], did not attempt complete clearing and replanting, realising that there was a unique opportunity to study the patterns of natural regeneration after such an event.&lt;ref&gt;see e.g. https://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/3310333/1987-Great-Storm-Terrible-blow-not-a-knockout.html&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of [[wild boar]] may have escaped from captivity during the storm, after enclosures were damaged by falling trees. These boar have since bred and established populations in woods across southern England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Britten|first=Nick|title=Wild boar back from extinction|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/4793881/Wild-boar-back-from-extinction.html|accessdate=1 August 2012|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=17 Mar 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A more positive aspect could be found among some British gardeners; as Heather Angel wrote in the [[Royal Horticultural Society]]'s ''Journal'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;In some places this natural disaster has resulted in splendid vistas- views long since forgotten by some and never before seen by a whole new generation. Because of gaps left by fallen trees, visitors to [[Arundel Castle]], the ancestral home of the Dukes of Norfolk, can now look out over the picturesque town... At the renowned woodland rhododendron garden at [[Leonardslee]], Sussex, the gale... opened magnificent views by removing about a thousand trees which owner Robin Loder said he would never have had the courage to thin out himself.&lt;ref&gt;Angel, in ''The Garden: Journal of the Royal Horticulyural Society'', March–April 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Following the storm meteorologists at the [[University of Reading]] led by Professor [[Keith Browning]] developed the [[Sting jet]] concept. During reanalysis of the storm they identified a [[mesoscale meteorology|mesoscale]] flow where the most damaging winds were shown to be emanating from the evaporating tip of the hooked cloud head on the southern flank of the cyclone. This cloud, hooked like a scorpion's tail, gives the wind region its name the "Sting Jet".&lt;ref name="stingflyer" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Browning|first=Keith|title=Damaging winds from European cyclones|url=http://royalsociety.org/summer-science/2003/european-cyclones/|accessdate=27 March 2013|newspaper=The Royal Society|year=2003|author2=Peter Clark|author3=Tim Hewson|author4=Robert Muir-Wood}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism of the Met Office===
The [[Met Office]] was severely criticised by most of the national press for failing to forecast the storm correctly.&lt;ref name="Houghton" /&gt;

The Met Office conducted an internal inquiry, scrutinised by two independent assessors, and a number of recommendations were made. Chiefly, observational coverage of the atmosphere over the ocean to the south and west of the UK was improved by increasing the quality and quantity of observations from ships, aircraft, buoys and satellites. Continued refinements were made to the computer models used in forecasting, and changes were made in the training of forecasters. In addition, reforms in the way the [[Met Office]] reports warnings of severe weather were implemented, leading to substantially more warnings being issued in the future. Further deployment of improved tracking devices and improvements in the computer model simulations were supported by the purchase of an additional [[Cray]] [[supercomputer]]. Warnings for the [[Burns' Day Storm]] just over two years later were accurate and on time, although the model forecast hinged on observations from two ships in the Atlantic near the developing storm the day before it reached the UK.&lt;ref name="Heming" &gt;{{cite journal|last=Heming|first=J.T.|title=The impact of surface and radiosonde observations from two Atlantic ships on a numerical weather prediction model forecast for the storm of 25 January 1990.|journal=The Meteorological Magazine|year=1990|volume=119|pages=249–259}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Michael Fish 1987 storm forecast.jpg|thumb|275px|right|Michael Fish's 15 October 1987 forecast on the BBC]]
[[BBC]] [[meteorologist]] [[Michael Fish]] drew particular criticism for reporting several hours before the storm hit:  &lt;blockquote&gt;Earlier on today, apparently, a woman rang the BBC and said she heard there was a hurricane on the way; well, if you're watching, don't worry, there isn't, but having said that, actually, the weather will become very windy, but most of the strong winds, incidentally, will be down over Spain and across into France.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnxjZ-aFkjs YouTube footage of Michael Fish]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Fish has subsequently claimed that his comments about a hurricane had nothing to do with the UK; they referred to Florida, USA, and were linked to a news story immediately preceding the weather bulletin, but had been so widely repeated out of context that the British public remains convinced that he was referring to the approaching storm.  According to Fish, the woman in question was actually a colleague's mother who was about to go on holiday in the Caribbean, and had called regarding (the already long-dissipated) [[Hurricane Floyd (1987)|Hurricane Floyd]] to see if it would be safe to travel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/weather/bbcweather/forecasters/michael_fish_1987storm.shtml |title=Michael Fish and the 1987 Storm |accessdate=2007-02-20 |work=BBC Weather |publisher=www.bbc.co.uk |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041001050426/http://www.bbc.co.uk/weather/bbcweather/forecasters/michael_fish_1987storm.shtml |archivedate=1 October 2004 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fish has also claimed that "nobody phoned up" and that she was a "non-existing woman", apparently contradicting the previous declaration, when interviewed about Anita Hart's claims of being the woman who made the call.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=TVinsiderV |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtNAYrVS7-g |title=BBC weather Michael Fish mystery phone caller revealed 1987 |publisher=YouTube |accessdate=2012-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fish went on to warn viewers that it would be "very windy" across the south of England, but predicted that the storm would move further south along the [[English Channel]] and the British mainland would escape the worst effects.  The remainder of his warning is frequently left out of re-runs, which only [[Selective abstraction|adds to the public's misconception]] of that day's forecasting. His analysis has been defended by weather experts. In particular, the lack of a [[weather ship]] in the Southwest Approaches, due to [[Met Office]] cutbacks,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nCLWnFozM6EC&amp;pg=PA25&amp;dq=weather+ship+network+book&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=dQE2TeWwMIaKlwenytCaCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=weather%20ship%20network%20book&amp;f=false|title=Romeo Would Have Spied the Storm|journal=New Scientist|date=1987-10-22|accessdate=2011-01-18|page=22|volume=116|number=1583|publisher=IPC Magazines}}&lt;/ref&gt; meant the only manner of tracking the storm was by using [[Weather satellite|satellite]] data, as [[weather buoy|automatic buoy]]s had not been deployed at the time.

Ironically, earlier forecasts as far back as the preceding weekend had correctly identified that gale-force winds would affect Southern England. However, later runs of the model had indicated a more southerly track for the low pressure system, incorrectly indicating that the strongest winds would be confined to Northern and Central France. The French meteorological office used a different computer weather model to the British, and the French model proved more accurate in predicting the severity of the storm in the Channel.

===Black Monday===
Following the storm few dealers made it to their desks and [[London Stock Exchange|stock market]] trading was suspended twice and the market closed early at 12.30pm. The disruption meant [[The City of London|the City]] was unable to respond to the late dealings at the beginning of the [[Wall Street]] fall-out on Friday 16 October, when the [[Dow Jones Industrial Average]] recorded its biggest-ever one-day slide at the time, a fall of 108.36.

'''''Gustavo III''''' is an [[opera]] by [[Giuseppe Verdi]] to a [[libretto]] begun in early 1857 by the Italian playwright [[Antonio Somma]]. Never performed as written, the libretto was later revised (or proposed to be revised) several times under two additional names – ''Una vendetta in domino'' and ''Adelia degli Adimari'' – during which the setting was changed to vastly different locations.  Eventually, it was agreed that it could be called ''[[Un ballo in maschera]]'', the one by which it is known today, but Verdi was forced to accept that the location of the story would have to be Colonial Boston.  This setting became the "standard" one until the mid-20th Century. Most productions today locate the action in Sweden.

However, a "hypothetical reconstruction" &lt;ref name="Parker"&gt;Parker, p. 179&lt;/ref&gt; of ''Gustavo III'' under its original name was performed by the [[Gothenburg Opera]] in [[Sweden]] during the 2002/03 season.

==Composition history==
In early 1856 Vincenzo Torelli, secretary to the [[Teatro San Carlo]]'s management approached Verdi with a contract offer, the proposed opera being ''[[Re Lear]]'', an opera based on [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[King Lear]]''. It was known to be a subject dear to the composer,&lt;ref name="Budden"&gt;Budden, pp. 362–363&lt;/ref&gt; but this libretto, for which Somma and Verdi had worked for some time, raised concerns for Verdi, not the least of which was finding a suitable cast in Naples, given the practice of a company engaging a group of singers for an entire season and giving them the major roles to sing in all productions, thus forcing a  composer to take into account their strengths and weaknesses in the roles he was creating.&lt;ref&gt;Verdi to Torelli, 17 June 1857, in Phillips-Matz, p. 370: "Believe me, it is a great mistake to risk ''Re Lear'' with a company of singers who, as good as they are, are not – one might say – made to order for these roles"&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though it proved to be impracticable to continue with ''Re Lear'', Verdi signed a contract in February 1857 for performances during the 1857/58 carnival season, but, as the year progressed and with time running out, he had misgivings and failed to meet commitments regarding ''Lear''.  Finally, in a letter which he wrote to Torelli in September 1857, Verdi confessed that he had "looked through an infinite number of plays.....but not one of them will do for me..."&lt;ref name="Budden363"/&gt; but he then   described an existing libretto which interested him, one which was written by the French playwright and librettist [[Eugene Scribe]] for [[Daniel Auber]]'s very successful 1833 opera, ''[[Gustave III (opera)|Gustave III, ou Le bal masqué]]'': 
:"At present I'm scaling down a French drama, ''Gustavo III di Svezia'' (Note: Verdi's translation of the French title), libretto by Scribe, performed at the Opéra twenty years ago. It's vast and grandiose; it's beautiful....It is now too late to find other subjects."&lt;ref name="Budden363"&gt;Verdi to Torelli, 19 September 1857, in Budden p.363&lt;/ref&gt;

Verdi turned to the historical subject of King [[Gustav III of Sweden]], who was shot while attending a masked ball in Stockholm in 1792 and died thirteen days later. [[Jacob Johan Anckarström|Anckarström]], his assassin, was executed. Although noting it as "a French drama",
&lt;ref&gt;Baldini, p. 248: Roger Parker, as editor and translator of ''The Story of Giuseppe Verdi'' challenges Baldini's statement that ''Gustave'' was a play, and he asserts that it was only an opera libretto written for Auber's opera&lt;/ref&gt; Verdi was referring to Scribe's libretto, and this became the source of Somma's libretto.

In his version, Scribe had retained the names of some of the historical figures involved including Gustave, Anckarström (the king's secretary and his best friend), [[Ulrica Arfvidsson]] (the fortune teller), and conspirators [[Adolph Ribbing|Ribbing]] and Horn; the conspiracy itself; and the killing at the masked ball. As noted by Budden, Scribe invented much of the rest of the action, including Gustav's romance with the fictional Amélie&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Dillon, "Unlucky Lady: Who is Amelia?", ''Opera News'', December 2012, Vol. 77, #6, p. 20: Dillon notes that "it doesn't matter that there was, historically, no "real" Amelia" and further that, for Scribe, "convention demanded a leading lady" therefore "Amélie, comtesse d'Ankastrom" in Auber's opera.&lt;/ref&gt; (Anckarström's wife) and he added characters and situations such as the page boy, Oscar. "It was a simple case of 'cherchez la femme'"&lt;ref name="Budden364"&gt;Budden, p. 364&lt;/ref&gt; says Budden, who sees Scribe using the romance as the reason for the murder (rather than the purely political motive behind the actual event) and he describes the plot of Scribe's libretto as "cleverly constructed...in which irony follows irony. It abounds in striking situations and ''coups de théatre''; it offers opportunities for a display of the most intense and varied emotions; and it is full of suspense."&lt;ref name="Budden364"/&gt;

===Initial preparation of the ''Gustavo III'' libretto===
Throughout the autumn of 1857 correspondence between librettist and composer flowed regularly,&lt;ref&gt;Werfel and Stefan, pp.203–207&lt;/ref&gt; and on 19 October, Verdi sent a synopsis to Torelli. He immediately received a reply warning him that "a change of locale would be necessary at the very least and the poet had better be advised of this."&lt;ref&gt;Budden, pp.367/68&lt;/ref&gt;  While Verdi did not necessarily see a problem in changing location, he did lament the loss of other things: "what a pity to have to give up the pomp of a court like that of Gustavo III.  Then too it will be difficult to find another monarch on the lines of that Gustavo.  Poor poets, poor composers"&lt;ref&gt;Verdi to Torelli, 23 October 1857 in Budden, pp.367/68&lt;/ref&gt;

When Somma's verses (to which Verdi had contributed a significant amount, including an initial prose outline)&lt;ref&gt;Gossett, p. 497&lt;/ref&gt; were sent to the composer by late November 1857, the outline of the opera was complete, and Verdi began to create musical sketches of significant scenes. At the same time, word came of the seven requirements imposed by the Naples censorship.  These included that (i) "The King must become a Duke"; (ii) "the action must be transferred to a pre-Christian age"; (iii) the conspirators must not hate the Duke because they wanted to take power; and (iv) "no firearms".&lt;ref&gt;The seven requirements, in Budden, p. 368&lt;/ref&gt;

Somma had several suggestions, including a possible new title, ''Il duca Ermanno''&lt;ref&gt;Phillips-Matz, p. 370&lt;/ref&gt; with a 12th Century setting, which Verdi rejected; but he did accept the proposed change to [[Pomerania]]. The pair spent Christmas of 1857 together working on changes. However, Somma insisted that his name be changed on the libretto to "Tommaso Anoni".

===''Gustavo III'' becomes ''Una vendetta in domino''===
Discussions with the censors eventually resulted in the location being changed to [[Stettin]] in Pomerania in Northern Germany, the main character becoming a Duke, and the title becoming ''Una vendetta in domino''. A compromise seemed to have been reached.  However, as has been noted, "Verdi did not begin preparing the skeleton score&lt;ref&gt;Defined in Gossett's glossary, p. 617: "Composers would begin laying out their autograph manuscripts by writing the vocal lines and the bass, entering also an occasional instrumental solo.  In this form the skeleton score could be given to copyists to prepare vocal parts.  Afterwards the autograph manuscript was returned to the composer, who would fill in the flesh around the skeleton he had earlier notated"&lt;/ref&gt; for ''Una vendetta'' before composer and versifier decided on the Pomeranian setting"&lt;ref&gt;Gossett, p.498&lt;/ref&gt;

After an arduous journey, Verdi arrived in Naples in January 1858. He brought with him the skeleton score and this was handed over to Torelli. With the major issues seeming to have been resolved and rehearsals of ''Un vendetta'' about to begin, an attempt to assassinate Emperor [[Napoleon III]] in Paris by three Italians led by [[Felice Orsini]] occurred on 14 January 1858.

After attempting to obtain agreement on the singers during his first ten days in Naples, Verdi finally discovered that the company's management had withheld the news that the censors had refused to approve the libretto some three months before.&lt;ref&gt;Philips-Matz, p. 374&lt;/ref&gt; Now, with the latest news regarding the Emperor, the Naples Chief of Police had ruled the opera's text would have to be entirely re-written.&lt;ref&gt;Budden, p. 369&lt;/ref&gt; Verdi regarded this as outrageous and, in his letter to Somma, he laid out his objections to their list of demands:
:"1. Transform the hero into some great lord, so that all thought of a sovereign is eradicated.
:2. Transform the wife into a sister.
:3. Change the scene with the fortune-teller, and put it back into a time when people believed in such things.
:4. No ballet.
:5. The murder is to be behind the scenes.
:6. Leave out completely the scene with the drawing of the name."&lt;ref name="Somma Feb58"&gt;Verdi to Somma, 7 February 1858, in Werfel and Stefan, p.207&lt;/ref&gt;

In between this correspondence with his librettist, Verdi hit upon an important musical point with Torelli regarding his feelings about the impossibility of changing the character of Gustavo. The composer says that to do so would make everything:
:"false and uninteresting [so that] that quality of brilliance and chivalry, that aura of gaiety that pervaded the whole action and which made a fine contrast and was like a light in the darkness surrounding the tragic moments, has vanished."&lt;ref&gt;Verdi to Torelli, 14 February 1858, in Hudson, p. 258&lt;/ref&gt;

If these kind of changes were to be made, Somma replied later, then he would insist that the title be changed and "another author be credited with the words"  The opera would no longer be his.&lt;ref&gt;Somma to Verdi, 13 April 1858, in Budden, p. 369&lt;/ref&gt;

When the manuscript of ''Una Vendetta'' was returned to him, Verdi found that it been renamed ''Adelia degli Adimari'' and now set in 14th Century Florence.  Even worse, he noted that of ''Una Vendetta''{{'}}s 884 lines, 297 had been changed in ''Adelia''.&lt;ref&gt;Philips-Matz, pp. 376 – 377&lt;/ref&gt; Although Torelli attempted to get the composer to compromise and meet with the censor on 20 February, Verdi dug in his heels and, in his reply to Torelli, refused to accept any changes: "...I cannot commit the monstrosities that were inflicted here (Naples) on ''Rigoletto'' ", referring to how that opera had been butchered by the censors when it was presented in his absence a few years before.&lt;ref&gt;Verdi to Torelli, in Budden, p.370&lt;/ref&gt; Rejecting any involvement with ''Adelia'', a lawsuit was then set in place by the theatre for breach of contract. In his counter suit, Verdi claimed damages and, in the document which he prepared called "Defense of Maestro Cavalier Giuseppe Verdi" and in which he gave instructions to his lawyer, he laid what he regarded as the absurdity of some of the requirements.&lt;ref&gt;Philips-Matz, p. 376&lt;/ref&gt; These included the substitution of one word of the opening chorus' "Die!" for "He sleeps". In addition, it has been noted that he instructed a copyist to "place the two librettos (''Vendetta'' and ''Adelia'')in  parallel columns"&lt;ref&gt;Gossett and Narici, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

In summary, Verdi rhetorically asks:
:"What the management's drama has in common with mine:
:The title? – No
:The poet? – No
:The period? – No
:The place? – No
:The characters? – No
:The situations? – No!
:The drawing of lots? – No!
:The ball? – No!
:A composer who respects his art and himself could not or would not dishonor himself by accepting as a subject for his music, written on quite a different basis, these absurdities....."&lt;ref&gt;Verdi to his lawyer, Arpino, in Budden, p.371&lt;/ref&gt;

The counter suit was presented to the Commercial Court in Naples on 13 March, and Verdi's efforts were rewarded with the Court's ruling that there was merit to the case and its injunction for the parties to reach agreement.  This allowed Verdi to leave Naples with his score in hand, but promising to return to Naples later in the year to stage at least one of his other operas.

===''Gustavo III'' is revived===
However, while many of the negotiations noted above were proceeding, Verdi became determined to find another location for his opera. In March 1858, after contacting his friend, the sculptor Vincenzo Luccardi in Rome, and requesting information on the performances of a play ''Gustavo III'' currently being presented there, he proposed that Rome stage the work. Verdi sent the libretto of the opera under the name of ''Gustavo III'', which at that point was identical to ''Una vendetta'' but with the original setting and names restored.&lt;ref&gt;Gossett, p.499&lt;/ref&gt;

When Jacovacci, impresario of the [[Teatro Apollo]] (where ''[[Il trovatore]]'' had been presented successfully) received the libretto, his reaction was encouraging, but he warned the composer that there may be problems with the censor.  Verdi was surprised: "In Rome they allow ''Gustavo III'' as a spoken play but won't allow a libretto on the same subject. Very strange!"&lt;ref&gt;Verdi to Jaccovaci, April 1858, in Budden, p. 372&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Baldini, p. 248: Roger Parker, as editor and translator of ''The Story of Giuseppe Verdi'' also clarifies this statement since he asserts that the play presented by the Dondini company as ''Gustavo III'' was not one written by Scribe but was ''Gustavo III Re di Svezia'' by Tommaso Gherardi del Testa.&lt;/ref&gt;

At first, Verdi wanted the libretto returned, but Jacovacci's persistence prevailed, and it was found that the censors did not insist on such dramatic changes as originally had been thought possible.  However, the censors' prime demand was the requirement that ''Gustavo III'' be set elsewhere than in Europe.  Verdi proposed Boston in the 17th Century to Somma, alternatively "the Caucasus perhaps?"&lt;ref name="Budden373"&gt;Verdi to Somma, 6 August 1858, in Budden p. 373&lt;/ref&gt;  His letter began: "Arm yourself with courage and patience.  Particularly with patience.....Remember that under present conditions our best plan is to present the opera in Rome.....".&lt;ref name="Budden373"/&gt;

Eventually, when the censors refused to allow a Duke, Somma came up with "Riccardo Conte di Varvich (Warwick)" and then refused to make other changes; that was acceptable to all. Once again, Somma refused to have his name appear on the libretto.

===''Gustavo III'' becomes ''Un ballo in maschera''===
By 11 September 1858, Verdi wrote to Somma accepting the revised changes in ''Gustavo III'', but renamed it as ''[[Un ballo in maschera]]''.  Until his arrival in Rome in January 1859, Verdi was involved in completing and orchestrating the opera.  Basing it as he did on the skeleton score of ''Una vendetta'', Verdi transformed the setting and characters' names to fit the requirements.  The score's text required modification to agree with ''Ballo'' and not ''Una vendetta'', orchestration was completed, and musical changes and adjustments were made.&lt;ref&gt;Gossett outlines this procedure, p.500&lt;/ref&gt;  Significant changes in the music occurred after 11 September and are also detailed by Gossett.&lt;ref&gt;Gossett, pp.500–501&lt;/ref&gt;

The first performance of the new opera was presented on 17 February 1859.

By about 1870, after ''Ballo'' had become successful and when [[Italian unification]] removed much of regional censorship, Verdi could probably have returned the opera to its original Swedish setting,&lt;ref&gt;Gossett, p.494&lt;/ref&gt; but he never did so.  Until the mid-20th Century, the "standard" location of ''Ballo'' remained in the United States.

Today, ''Ballo'' has become part of the standard repertory and is often performed.

==Performance history of ''Gustavo III''==
''Gustavo III'' disappeared for close to one hundred and fifty years, but it again made an appearance with the publication of the critical edition of ''Un ballo in maschera'' and the subsequent "hypothetical reconstruction",&lt;ref name="Parker"/&gt; based on the unorchestrated original and much of ''Una vendetta'' "grafted" &lt;ref name="Parker"/&gt; onto ''Un ballo''{{'}}s score.

The complete history of ''Gustavo III'' has been outlined by musicologist [[Philip Gossett]] in his ''Divas and Scholars''&lt;ref&gt;Gossett, pp. 491 to 513&lt;/ref&gt; but, as noted by George Loomis, for the 25% of the score which is lost "Gossett and (Ilaria) Narici (who edited the critical edition) had to use an earlier sketched version at Sant'Agata that spans the entire opera (with some gaps) but consists largely of only the melodic line. Gossett says that the sketched draft nevertheless permits one conversant with Verdi's style to reconstruct the original with a reasonable degree of probability. And the opera's final version often supplies guidance in matters of harmony and orchestration."&lt;ref&gt;Loomis, in the ''[[New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

''Gustavo III'' was presented by the [[Gothenburg Opera]] in [[Gothenburg]], Sweden during the 2002/03 season,&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.opera.se/forestallningar/gustaf-iii-maskeradbalen-2002-2003/  Gothenburg Opera's website with performance cast list]&lt;/ref&gt; 146 years after Verdi took his libretto for ''Gustavo III'' away from the [[Teatro San Carlo]] in Naples. ''Gustavo III'' was given at the San Carlo in January/February 2004.

'''Harold Melvin Agnew''' (March 28, 1921 – September 29, 2013) was an American physicist, best known for having flown as a scientific observer on the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|Hiroshima bombing mission]] and, later, as the third director of the [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]].

Agnew joined the [[Metallurgical Laboratory]] at the [[University of Chicago]] in 1942, and helped build the [[Chicago Pile-1]], the world's first [[nuclear reactor]]. In 1943, he joined the [[Los Alamos Laboratory]], where he worked with the [[Cockcroft–Walton generator]]. After the war ended, he returned to the University of Chicago, where he completed his graduate work under [[Enrico Fermi]].

Agnew returned to Los Alamos in 1949, and worked on the [[Castle Bravo]] [[nuclear test]] at [[Bikini Atoll]] in 1954. He became head of the Weapon Nuclear Engineering Division in 1964. He also served as a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] [[New Mexico Senate|New Mexico State Senator]] from 1955 to 1961, and was the Scientific Adviser to the [[NATO]] [[Supreme Allied Commander Europe]] (SACEUR) from 1961 to 1964. He was director of the Los Alamos National Laboratory from 1970 to 1979, when he resigned to become President and Chief Executive Officer of [[General Atomics]]. He died at his home in [[Solana Beach, California]], on September 29, 2013.

==Early life and education ==
Harold Melvin Agnew was born in [[Denver, Colorado]] on March 28, 1921, the only child of a pair of [[stonemasonry|stonecutters]]. He attended [[South High School (Denver)|South Denver High School]] and entered the [[University of Denver]], where he majored in [[chemistry]]. He was a strong athlete who pitched for the university [[softball]] that won a championship. He left the University of Denver in January 1942, but had enough credits to graduate [[Phi Beta Kappa]] with his [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in June, and he received a scholarship to [[Yale University]].{{sfn|Palevsky|2005|pp=2–3}}&lt;ref name="New York Times"&gt;{{cite news |title=Harold M. Agnew, Physicist Present at Birth of the Nuclear Age, Dies at 92 |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |date=October 1, 2013 |last=Broad |first=William J. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/02/us/harold-m-agnew-physicist-present-at-birth-of-the-nuclear-age-dies-at-92.html|accessdate=October 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Japanese [[bombing of Pearl Harbor]] brought the United States into the [[Pacific War]], Agnew and his girlfriend Beverly, a fellow graduate of South Denver High School and the University of Denver, attempted to join the [[United States Army Air Corps]] together. They were persuaded not to sign the enlistment papers. Instead, [[Joyce C. Stearns]], the head of the physics department at the University of Denver, persuaded Agnew to come with him to the [[University of Chicago]], where Stearns became the deputy head of the [[Metallurgical Laboratory]]. Although Agnew had enough credits to graduate, Beverly did not and had to remain behind. They were married in Denver on May 2, 1942. They then went to Chicago, where Beverly became a secretary to Richard L. Doan, then head of the Metallurgical Laboratory. Agnew and Beverly had two children, a daughter Nancy, and a son, John.{{sfn|Palevsky|2005|pp=2–3}}&lt;ref name="Beverly"&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Los Alamos Historical Society Newsletter |volume=30 |issue=4 |date=December 2011 |page=3 |title=In Memoriam: Agnew and Ramsey |url=http://www.losalamoshistory.org/pdfs/december11newsletter.pdf |accessdate=December 30, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304095913/http://www.losalamoshistory.org/pdfs/december11newsletter.pdf |archivedate=March 4, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Agnew NagasakiPuCoreDetail.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Harold Agnew on Tinian in 1945, carrying the [[plutonium]] [[Pit (nuclear weapon)|core]] of the Nagasaki [[Fat Man]] bomb]]
At the Metallurgical Laboratory, Agnew worked with [[Enrico Fermi]], [[Walter Zinn]] and [[Herbert L. Anderson]].{{sfn|Palevsky|2005|pp=2–3}}  There, he was involved in the construction of [[Chicago Pile-1]]. Initially, Agnew worked with the instrumentation. The [[Geiger counter]]s were calibrated using a [[radon]]-[[beryllium]] source, and Agnew received too high a dose of radiation. He was then put to work stacking the [[graphite]] bricks that were the reactor's [[neutron moderator]]. He witnessed the first controlled [[nuclear chain reaction]] when the reactor went critical on December 2, 1942.{{sfn|Palevsky|2005|p=5}}&lt;ref name="New York Times"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NF"&gt;{{cite web |title=Harold Agnew |url=http://nuclearfiles.org/menu/library/biographies/bio_agnew-harold.htm |accessdate=December 21, 2011 |publisher=Nuclear Age Peace Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Agnew and Beverly moved to the [[Los Alamos Laboratory]] in March 1943.&lt;ref name="New York Times"/&gt; Agnew, Beverly and [[Bernard Waldman]] first went to the [[University of Illinois]], where the men disassembled the [[Cockcroft–Walton generator]] and [[particle accelerator]] while Beverly catalogued all the parts. The parts were shipped to New Mexico, where Agnew and Beverly met up with them, and rode the trucks hauling them to the Los Alamos Laboratory. There, Beverly worked a secretary, initially with [[Robert Oppenheimer]] and his secretary Priscilla Green. She then became secretary to [[Robert Bacher]], the head of Physics (P) Division, and later the Gadget (G) Division, for the rest of the war. Agnew's job was to reassemble the accelerator, which was then used for experiments by [[John Henry Manley|John Manley]]'s group.&lt;ref name="Beverly"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Voices"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.manhattanprojectvoices.org/oral-histories/harold-agnews-interview |title=Harold Agnew's Interview |publisher=Manhattan Project Voices |accessdate=October 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When experimental work wound down, Agnew was transferred to [[Project Alberta]], working as part of [[Luis W. Alvarez]]'s group, whose role was to monitor the yield of nuclear explosions. With Alvarez and [[Lawrence H. Johnston]], Agnew had devised a method for measuring the yield of the nuclear blast by dropping pressure gauges on parachutes and [[telemetry|telemetering]] the readings back to the plane.&lt;ref name="AE"/&gt; In June 1945, he was issued with an Army uniform and dog tags at Wendover Army Air Field, Utah, and was flown to [[Tinian]] in the Western Pacific in a [[C-54]] of the [[509th Composite Group]]. Agnew's first task was to install his yield measurement instrumentation in the [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress]] aircraft ''[[The Great Artiste]]''.{{sfn|Krauss|Krauss|2005|p=343}}

During the [[atomic bombing of Hiroshima]], on August 6, 1945, Agnew, along with Alvarez and Johnston, flew as a scientific observer in ''The Great Artiste'', piloted by [[Charles Sweeney]], which tailed the ''[[Enola Gay]]'' as the instrumentation aircraft.  Agnew later recalled, "After we dropped our gauges I remember we made a sharp turn to the right so that we would not get caught in the blast – but we still got badly shaken up by it."  He brought along a movie camera and took the only existing movies of the Hiroshima event as seen from the air.&lt;ref name="AE"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=PBS |title=American Experience .

After the war ended, Agnew entered the University of Chicago, where he completed his graduate work under Fermi. Agnew and Beverly stayed with Fermi and his family, due to the post-war housing shortage.&lt;ref name="Voices"/&gt; He received his [[Master of Science]] (MS) degree in 1948 and his [[Doctor of Philosophy]] (PhD) degree in 1949,{{sfn|Palevsky|2005|p=10}} writing his thesis on "The beta-spectra of Cs137, Y91, Pm147, Ru106, Sm151, P32, Tm170".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://libcat.uchicago.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?session=13810V85D21C2.32763&amp;profile=ucpublic&amp;uri=full=3100001~!4272351~!1&amp;ri=1&amp;aspect=subtab13&amp;menu=search&amp;source=~!horizon |publisher=[[University of Chicago]] |title=The beta spectra of Cs137, Y91, Chlorine147, Ru106, Sm151, P32, Tm170 |accessdate=October 6, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012041732/https://libcat.uchicago.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?session=13810V85D21C2.32763&amp;profile=ucpublic&amp;uri=full=3100001~!4272351~!1&amp;ri=1&amp;aspect=subtab13&amp;menu=search&amp;source=~!horizon |archivedate=October 12, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fellow postgraduate students at Chicago at the time included [[Tsung-Dao Lee]], [[Chen Ning Yang]], [[Owen Chamberlain]] and [[Jack Steinberger]].{{sfn|Palevsky|2005|p=10}}

==Los Alamos years==
[[File:Agnew Harold 30 years of service 1974 PUB74116008.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Harold Agnew receives his 30 years of service award in 1974]]
With his doctorate in hand, Agnew returned to Los Alamos as a [[National Research Foundation]] Fellow, and worked on weapons development in the Physics Division.&lt;ref name="ACAP"/&gt; In 1950, he was assigned to the [[thermonuclear weapon]]s project, and was project engineer for the [[Castle Bravo]] [[nuclear test]] at [[Bikini Atoll]] in 1954.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nuclearweaponarchive.org/Usa/Tests/Castle.html |title=Operation Castle |publisher=Nuclear Weapon Archive  |accessdate=October 6, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Palevsky|2005|p=16}} He became head of the Weapon Nuclear Engineering Division in 1964.&lt;ref name="ACAP"/&gt;

Agnew served as a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] [[New Mexico Senate|New Mexico State Senator]] from 1955 to 1961.&lt;ref name="New Mexican"&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=[[The Santa Fe New Mexican]] |url=http://www.santafenewmexican.com/news/local_news/article_b9612ad1-27f8-5d07-9db3-6c84da4ff678.html |first=Tom |last=Sharpe |title=Former Los Alamos lab director Harold Agnew dies at 92 |date=September 30, 2013 |accessdate=October 6, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the first state senator to be elected from [[Los Alamos County]].

He was unsuccessful in 1957, but the law was reformed in 1963.{{sfn|Roybal|2008|pp=186–189}}

From 1961 to 1964, he was Scientific Adviser to the [[NATO]] [[Supreme Allied Commander Europe]] (SACEUR). He also held a number of part-time advisory position with the military over the years. He was a member of the [[United States Air Force Scientific Advisory Board]] from 1957 to 1968, and was chairman of the Science Advisory Group of the [[United States Army]]'s Combat Development Command from 1966 to 1970. He was a member of the [[Defense Science Board]] from 1966 to 1970, the Army's Scientific Advisory Panel from 1966 to 1974, and the Army Science Board from 1978 to 1984.&lt;ref name="ACAP"/&gt;

Agnew became director of the Los Alamos National Laboratory in 1970, when it had 7,000 employees.&lt;ref name="The Washington Post" /&gt; He took over at a time of great change. His predecessor, [[Norris Bradbury]], had rebuilt the laboratory from scratch after the war, and many of the people he had brought in were approaching retirement.&lt;ref name="Agnew Years"/&gt; Under his directorship, Los Alamos developed an underground test containment program, completed its [[Los Alamos Neutron Science Center|Meson Physics Facility]], acquired the first [[Cray-1|Cray supercomputer]], and trained the first class of [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] inspectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] |url=http://www.lanl.gov/history/people/agnew.shtml |title=The Agnew Years (1970–1979) |accessdate=December 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agnew managed to get the Los Alamos Laboratory responsibility for the development of the [[W76]], used by the [[Trident I]] and [[Trident II]] [[Submarine Launched Ballistic Missile]]s, and the [[W78]] used by the [[LGM-30 Minuteman|Minuteman III]] [[intercontinental ballistic missile]]s. He was proud of the work with [[insensitive high explosive]] that made nuclear weapons safer to handle. Support from the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]] for reactor development dried up, but during the  [[1970s energy crisis]], the laboratory explored other types of alternative fuels.&lt;ref name="Agnew Years"&gt;{{cite journal |journal=[[Los Alamos Science]] |volume=4 |issue=7 |date=Winter–Spring 1983 |pages=73–79 |title=The Times They Were a Changin’ |format=PDF |url=http://gendocs.ru/docs/9/8057/conv_1/file1.pdf |accessdate=October 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
In 1979, Agnew resigned from Los Alamos and became President and Chief Executive Officer of [[General Atomics]], a position he held until 1985.&lt;ref name="ACAP" /&gt; In his letter of resignation to [[David S. Saxon]], the President of the University of California, Agnew wrote that his decision was influenced by "dissatisfaction with University administration policies and a lack of advocacy for the total LASL [Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory] program" and "frustration with what I consider to be a continuing inequitable distribution of defense program funding by the [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] between the LASL and LLL [Lawrence Livermore Laboratory]."&lt;ref name="Physics Today"&gt;{{cite journal |journal=[[Physics Today]] |volume=32 |issue=5 |title=Agnew quits Los Alamos, goes to General Atomic |date=May 1979 |page=116 |doi=10.1063/1.2995534 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Harold Agnew in 2006.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Harold Agnew at The Los Alamos Laboratory in 2006]]
Agnew chaired the General Advisory Committee of the [[Arms Control and Disarmament Agency]] from 1974 to 1978, and served as a White House science councillor from 1982 to 1989. He was a member of [[NASA]]'s Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel from 1968 to 1974, and from 1978 to 1987. He became an adjunct professor at the [[University of California, San Diego]] in 1988. He was the recipient of the [[Ernest Lawrence|E.O. Lawrence]] Award in 1966, and of the Department of Energy's [[Enrico Fermi Award]] in 1978. Along with [[Hans Bethe]], Agnew was the first to receive the Los Alamos National Laboratory Medal. He was a member of the [[National Academy of Sciences]] and the [[National Academy of Engineering]].&lt;ref name="NF" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ACAP" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://science.energy.gov/fermi/award-laureates/ |accessdate=December 21, 2011 |publisher=[[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] |title=Award Laureates}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nae.edu/MembersSection/Directory20412/29790.aspx |accessdate=April 10, 2013 |publisher=[[National Academy of Engineering]] |title=Members}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A proponent of [[tactical nuclear weapon]]s, Agnew pointed out in 1970 that the [[Thanh Hoa Bridge]] in Vietnam required hundreds of sorties to destroy with conventional weapons when a nuclear weapon could have done the job with just one.&lt;ref name="Vintage Agnew"&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Los Alamos Science |format=PDF |volume=4 |issue=7 |date=Winter–Spring 1983 |title=Vintage Agnew |url=http://gendocs.ru/docs/9/8057/conv_1/file1.pdf |pages=69–72 |accessdate=October 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1977 article for the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, Agnew argued that the fusion reactions of [[neutron bomb]]s could provide "tactical" advantages over conventional fission weapons, especially in countering the "massive armor component possessed by the [[Eastern bloc]]." Citing conclusions reached by the Rand Corporation, Agnew argued that without affecting the armor of a tank, the neutrons produced by a fusion blast would penetrate the vehicle and "in a matter of a few tens of minutes to hours kill or make the crew completely ineffective." Because the neutron bomb reduced collateral damage, it could be used in a much more selective fashion than a fission weapon, thereby providing a clear "advantage for the military defender as well as for the nearby non-combatant."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Institute for Policy Studies |url=http://rightweb.irc-online.org/profile/Agnew_Harold |title=Profile of Harold Agnew |accessdate=December 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Agnew maintained that no new U.S. nuclear weapon design could be certified without [[nuclear testing]], and that stockpile reliability stewardship without such testing may be problematic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Hugh E. |last=DeWitt |first2=Gerald E. |last2=Marsh |url=https://books.google.com/?id=prgDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA41&amp;lpg=PA41&amp;dq=Agnew+nuclear+testing#v=onepage&amp;q=Agnew%20nuclear%20testing&amp;f=false |title=Stockpile reliability and nuclear testing |journal=[[Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists]] |pages=40–41 |volume= 1 |issue= 8 |date=April 1984 |accessdate=December 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1999 letter to the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', he commented on the significance of allegations of Chinese nuclear espionage. "As long as any nation has a demonstrated nuclear capability and a means of delivering its bombs and warheads, it doesn't really matter whether the warheads are a little smaller or painted a color other than red, white, and blue," he wrote.

[[File:Stroke hemorrhagic.jpg|thumb|300px|Internal bleeding in the brain]]

'''Internal bleeding''' (also called '''internal [[hemorrhage]]''') is a loss of [[blood]] that occurs from the [[vascular system]] into a body cavity or space.&lt;ref name="isbn0-8036-1559-0"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Taber, Clarence Wilbur |author2=Venes, Donald |title=Taber's cyclopedic medical dictionary |publisher=F a Davis Co |location= |year=2009 |pages=1200 |isbn=0-8036-1559-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a serious [[medical emergency]] but the extent of severity depends on bleeding rate and location of the bleeding (e.g. heart, brain, stomach, lungs). It can cause [[death]] and [[cardiac arrest]] if proper medical treatment is not received quickly.

== Causes ==
A number of [[medical conditions]] may lead to internal bleeding. Common causes include [[Trauma (medicine)|trauma]], various [[Pathology|pathological]] conditions and [[Complication (medicine)|complications]] of medical therapy. Common locations include the [[gastrointestinal tract]], the [[aorta]] and [[intracranial hemorrhage]]. A [[bruise]] is a form of internal bleeding. Bruises occur most often when blunt force trauma breaks small blood vessels inside the body, causing blood to leak out into surrounding tissue. If the blood leaks into tissue that is near the surface of the skin, this bleeding is visible as a discoloration of the skin called a bruise or contusion. Bruises are among the most common injuries and they are often minor, but bruises can sometimes be very severe in the case of serious injuries.

=== Trauma ===
Internal bleeding can be caused by [[blunt trauma]] such as high speed [[acceleration|deceleration]] in an [[automobile accident]], or by [[penetrating trauma]] such as a [[Ballistic trauma|ballistic]] or [[stab wound]].&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas S. Duncan, Chris Moran, "[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S187713270900195X Initial resuscitation of the trauma victim]", ''Orthopaedics and Trauma'', Volume 24, Issue 1, February 2010, Pages 1–8&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pathological conditions and disease ===
A number of pathological conditions and diseases can lead to internal bleeding. These include [[blood vessel]] rupture as a result of high [[blood pressure]], [[aneurysms]], [[esophageal varices]] or [[peptic ulcers]].&lt;ref name="sciencedirect.com"&gt;Edward W. Lee,  Jeanne M. Laberge,  "[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1089251604000484 Differential Diagnosis of Gastrointestinal Bleeding]", ''Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology'', Volume 7, Issue 3, September 2004, Pages 112–122&lt;/ref&gt;
Another common cause of internal bleeding is [[carcinoma]] (cancer), either of the gastro-intestinal tract, of the lung, or more rarely of other organs such as the [[prostate]], [[pancreas]] or [[kidney]].&lt;ref name="sciencedirect.com"/&gt;
Other diseases linked to internal bleeding include [[scurvy]], [[hepatoma]], [[Hepatocellular carcinoma|liver cancer]], Autoimmune [[Thrombocytopenia]], [[ectopic pregnancy]], malignant [[hypothermia]], ovarian [[cysts]], [[Vitamin K]] Deficiency, and [[hemophilia]] and [[malaria]]. Some viruses may cause a type of internal bleeding called [[viral hemorrhagic fever]], such as the [[Ebola]], [[Dengue fever|Dengue]] or [[Marburg virus disease|Marburg]] viruses, but these are rare.&lt;ref&gt;M. Bray, "[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123739445003035 Hemorrhagic Fever Viruses]", ''Encyclopedia of Microbiology'' (Third Edition) 2009, Pages 339–353&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Health care caused ===
[[File:Linitis plastica 2.jpg|thumb|233x233px|This stomach with Linitis Plastica can cause internal bleeding]]
Internal bleeding could be an [[iatrogenic artifact]] as a result of complications after [[surgical operation]]s or medical treatment.
Some [[medication]] effects may also lead to internal bleeding, such as the use of  [[anticoagulant]] drugs or  [[antiplatelet drugs]] in the treatment of [[coronary artery disease]].&lt;ref&gt;Jan Pospisil, Milan Hromadka,  Ivo Bernat, Richard Rokyta, "[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010865013000271 STEMI—The importance of balance between antithrombotic treatment and bleeding risk]", ''Thrombosis'', Volume 55, Issue 2, April 2013, Pages e135–e146&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prognosis ==
Internal bleeding is serious for two reasons:
* the excess blood can compress organs and cause their dysfunction (as can occur in [[hematoma]])
* when the bleeding does not stop spontaneously, the loss of blood will cause hemorrhagic [[Shock (circulatory)|shock]], which can lead to [[brain damage]] and death.
If there is pressure, it may lead to death or a brain hemorrhage.

== Terminology ==
Cases of internal bleeding are usually termed as [[hemorrhage]], even though the term is general to all kinds of bleeding. A minor case of internal bleeding results in [[ecchymosis]], or a bruise: blood expands under the skin, causing discoloration.

The '''Lafayette Square Opera House''' was an [[Opera House]] built in 1895, at 717 Madison Place, NW in [[Washington D.C.]]. It was dedicated on 30 September 1895 by  [[Lillian Russell]], one of the most well known actress of the time, who was there to perform in ''[[Tzigane]]''. [[Reginald De Koven]], composer of the opera, led the orchestra at Russell's request.&lt;ref name=Star950928&gt;{{cite news|title=Amusements|url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83045462/1895-09-28/ed-1/seq-7/|accessdate=6 January 2015|publisher=Evening Star (Washington D.C)|date=28 September 1895}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1905 it was purchased by the Shuberts and David Belasco and was renamed the '''Belasco Theatre'''. The theatre was acquired by the US federal government and used as a warehouse until World War II, when it was operated by the [[American Theatre Wing]] as a [[Stage Door Canteen]]. During the Korean War, it was used by the United Services Organization to entertain troops. The theater was razed in 1964.

==History==
The Lafayette Square Opera House as built by [[John W. Albaugh]], on behalf of the Lafayette Square Opera House Company. It was completed in September 1895 at a cost of 250,000 dollars (${{formatprice|{{Inflation|US|250000|1895|r=1}}}} in present day terms). Located on Madison Place NW, just north of Pennsylvania Avenue, the theater faced [[Lafayette Square Historic District (Washington, D.C.)|Lafayette Square]] and the [[White House]]. The site, originally the home of [[Commodore (United States)|Commodore]] [[John Rodgers (1772–1838)|John Rodgers]],&lt;ref name=WHHistory/&gt; was noted for a history of tragic events and believed to be haunted.  It was there that [[Congressman]], later [[American Civil War|Civil War]] [[General]], [[Daniel Sickles]] killed the [[district attorney]] for the [[District of Columbia]], [[Philip Barton Key II]], son of [[Francis Scott Key]]. Following the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], [[John Wilkes Booth]]'s co-conspirator, [[Lewis Powell (conspirator)|Lewis Powell]], attempted to take the life of [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[William H. Seward]], who was living there at the time.  The property was later purchased by former Secretary of State [[James G. Blaine]], and it was there that he and two of his children, Walker and Alice, died.&lt;ref name=Times1894&gt;{{cite news|title=Blaine's Old Home to be a Theater|url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn87062244/1894-12-29/ed-1/seq-2/|accessdate=6 January 2015|publisher=The Washington Times|date=29 December 1894}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Globe&gt;{{cite news|title=New Lafayette Square Opera House opens in Washington Opens Tonight|url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn90059522/1895-09-30/ed-1/seq-2/|accessdate=6 January 2015|publisher=St. Paul Daily Globe|date=30 September 1895}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=StarMay95&gt;{{cite news|title=New Opera House|url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83045462/1895-05-18/ed-1/seq-18/|accessdate=6 January 2015|publisher=Evening Star (Washington D.C.)|date=15 September 1895}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The structure was built of polished gray granite in the classic Grecian order style. Its frontage was 76 feet wide and 176 feet deep. The steel frame building, equipped with the latest fireproof rigging of the time and using an [[asbestos]] stage curtain, was advertised is being absolutely [[fireproof]]. The main entrance was thirty-six feet wide, and opened directly to the sidewalk on Madison Place. The lobby was finished in mahogany with [[mosaic]] tile flooring.  Broad marble staircases on either side led to the upper floors. The main floor rose five tiers, constructed on the cantilever, with two Ionic columns on the main floor and three in the balconies. The mezzanine was divided into 31 stalls, one for each [[President of the United States]] at that time,&lt;ref name=Globe/&gt; each seating four to eight people.&lt;ref name=StarMay95/&gt; The theater had 1,800 seats, "not one from which actors can not be seen."&lt;ref name=Times1894/&gt;

The wrought steel front railings of the boxes and balconies were designed by [[Trost &amp; Trost]] Architects. The interior was finished in the Italian renaissance style. On the asbestos stage curtain was a copy of [[Fernand Cormon]]'s painting, ''Les Vainqueurs de Salamine''.&lt;ref name=Globe/&gt; The stage itself was 68 feet wide and 45 feet deep.&lt;ref name=Times950915&gt;{{cite news|title=New Home of the Drama|url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn84024442/1895-09-15/ed-1/seq-17/|accessdate=6 January 2015|publisher=The Morning Times (Washington D.C.)|date=15 September 1895}}&lt;/ref&gt; The roof was constructed for use as a theater&lt;ref name=Globe/&gt; in the summer months, with seating up to 1,500.&lt;ref name=Times950915/&gt; The basement was used primarily for a [[Turkish bath]], but did include a barber shop and restrooms.&lt;ref name=StarMay95/&gt;

In 1940 the Belasco Theatre and its neighboring properties were acquired by the federal government.

'''Maury Troy Travis''' (October 25, 1965 – June 10, 2002) was an American murderer and suspected [[serial killer]] who killed himself in a [[St. Louis County, Missouri|St. Louis county]] jail, after being arrested for murder. Travis was named in a Federal criminal complaint for the murders of two women. At the time of the murders, Travis was a waiter and on parole for a robbery in 1989. While in his letter Travis claimed to have murdered 17 women, some authorities were doubtful;&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt;&lt;ref name="suhr020611" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lat617" /&gt; others thought he may have murdered up to 20 women.&lt;ref name="abc" /&gt;

==Known victims==
At least one videotape of Travis murdering and/or persecuting some of his victims was found in the search of his home. He is believed to have killed two women, Alysia Greenwade, whose body was discovered 1 April 2001 in [[Illinois]] (after having been last seen in [[Missouri]]), and Betty James, whose body was discovered about two months later in Missouri (after having been last seen in Illinois).&lt;ref name="suhr020611" /&gt; Although Travis appears to acknowledge at least 17 murders, the police believe his victim count could be as high as 20.

==Investigation==
From May to October 2001 four other women were tortured and strangled: Teresa Wilson, Verona Thompson, Yvonne Crues and Brenda Beasley. ''[[The St. Louis Post-Dispatch]]'' ran a profile piece on Wilson, and Travis responded to it anonymously with a letter and a map. The letter had a return address of I THRALLDOM, a web bondage site, but no other identification.&lt;ref name="suhr020611" /&gt; However, the map was recognized to have come from [[Expedia.com]], and further investigation traced it back to Travis, who was arrested.&lt;ref name="suhr020611" /&gt;&lt;ref name="trutv" /&gt;

In the letter he said, "I'll tell you where many others are." And then: "To prove I'm real, here's directions to number seventeen."&lt;ref name="lat617" /&gt; Travis was arrested on a federal criminal complaint and, while in the custody of the [[U.S. Marshals Service]], was housed at a St. Louis County jail facility in [[Clayton, Missouri]].&lt;ref name="suhr020612" /&gt; Investigators discovered a torture chamber at Travis' residence, instruments of torture, a stun gun, newspaper clippings of some of his crimes, and videotapes of Travis committing some of his crimes.&lt;ref name="abc" /&gt;

==Death==
Before he could be put on trial or sentenced for the crimes, Travis hanged himself on June 10, 2002, in his [[jail cell]] in St. Louis County Jail after jailers trained in suicide watch failed to show up to check on him.&lt;ref name="suhr020612" /&gt;

''[[Forensic Files]]'' covered the story of his crime spree. The episode was titled "X Marks the Spot". ''[[Cold Case Files]]'' also covered the story, in an episode entitled "A Map to Murder". ''Evil, I''  also covered this story in an episode entitled "Hell's Basement".

After watching the ''Cold Case Files'' documentary on the [[A&amp;E (TV network)|A&amp;E]] network, the current tenant of Travis' house found out about the house's history. It was revealed that her landlord, who would not return the money or break the lease when confronted, was Travis' mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Nagus |first1=Chris |title=Catrina McGhaw: St. Louis woman finds out on TV she's renting serial killer Maury Travis' home |url=http://www.wptv.com/news/national/catrina-mcghaw-st-louis-woman-finds-out-on-tv-shes-renting-serial-killer-maury-travis-home |accessdate=26 October 2014 |publisher=[[KMOV]] |date=9 July 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141026024801/http://www.wptv.com/news/national/catrina-mcghaw-st-louis-woman-finds-out-on-tv-shes-renting-serial-killer-maury-travis-home |archivedate=26 October 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon being approached by the local housing authority the landlord subsequently agreed to rescind the lease.&lt;ref name ="abc2" /&gt;

'''Romona Moore''' (1982 – April 2003) was a 21-year-old [[Hunter College]] honors student who disappeared April 24, 2003 in [[Brooklyn, New York]]. Two months later, her body was discovered outside an abandoned house where an anonymous caller had directed her mother. Two male suspects were arrested; they were convicted in 2006 of having kidnapped, raped, tortured, and murdered Moore. While attending college, the young immigrant from [[Guyana]] was living at home with her parents and relatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| date =August 22, 2003| title =Remembering Romona Committee| publisher =Angelfire| url =http://www.angelfire.com/hero/romonamoore/|accessdate =2007-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two men were sentenced to life in prison without parole for the murder and other charges related to Moore, with an additional 22 years for their escape attempt in January 2006 during the trial. In a separate trial during this period, the two suspects were also convicted of having abducted and raped a 15-year-old girl in 2003 soon after Moore's murder. The girl had escaped from them and gone to police. Her report contributed to their apprehension in the Moore case.

In 2008, Moore's mother Ellie Carmichael filed a suit in federal district court against the [[New York Police Department]] (NYPD), charging its officials with racial bias in how they handled cases of missing persons; the suit was accepted for trial. Carmichael contrasted the NYPD's treatment of her daughter's case with that of a white rare book dealer from the Upper West Side who disappeared about the same time. In August 2014, the federal judge dismissed the case, saying there was no evidence of systemic racial bias within the department on this issue.

==Background ==
Born in [[Guyana]], Moore immigrated with her parents to New York City, where they settled in the [[East Flatbush, Brooklyn|East Flatbush]] section of Brooklyn. Relatives from Guyana also lived there. After attending local schools, Moore entered [[Hunter College]]. A responsible high achiever, in 2003 she was a third-year psychology honors student.&lt;ref name="nytverdict"/&gt;

==Disappearance and murder==
Moore was last seen by her family when she left home on April 24 at approximately 7:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. to meet a friend. She left the friend around 9:00&amp;nbsp;p.m., saying she was going to eat at a [[Burger King]] [[restaurant]] at Church and Remsen avenues. Moore apparently never reached the restaurant, and was not seen again by family or friends.&lt;ref name="Canarsie"&gt;{{cite web| date =May 15, 2003| author =Charles Rogers| title =Local College Student Slain| work =Canarsie Courier| url =http://www.canarsiecourier.com/News/2003/0515/Front_Page/| accessdate =2007-11-12| archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20070928110016/http://www.canarsiecourier.com/News/2003/0515/Front_Page/| archive-date =2007-09-28| dead-url =yes| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Moore's mother reported her missing the next day, the police said that perhaps the girl was with friends, declining to open the case despite the mother's protests about knowing her daughter's habits. The family posted their own photos and fliers in the neighborhood, hoping to gain information about Romona's disappearance. The police did not open a case on the missing young woman until April 28. In addition to their downplaying family concern when the student disappeared, the initial police reports about her murder mistakenly spelled Moore's first name as "Ramona."

About the same time as Moore's disappearance, police in Manhattan were publicizing their investigation of the disappearance of Svetlana Aronov, a rare book dealer reported missing by her husband. They held a press conference and displayed a large photo of the missing woman to make the public aware.&lt;ref name="bias"/&gt; Aronov's body was found drowned in the East River a few months later.&lt;ref name="nobias"/&gt;

Several days after Moore's disappearance, a 15-year-old girl in Brooklyn reported to police that she had been abducted by two men and taken to an empty house where she was raped by them. She escaped and contacted authorities.&lt;ref name="deathpenalty"&gt;{{cite web|date =January 15, 2004| author=Associated Press |title =Brooklyn DA to seek death penalty in killing of college student| publisher =Rick Halperin| url =http://venus.soci.niu.edu/~archives/ABOLISH/rick-halperin/mar04/1047.html | accessdate =2007-11-12 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060907090149/http://venus.soci.niu.edu/~archives/ABOLISH/rick-halperin/mar04/1047.html |archivedate = 2006-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About two months after Moore disappeared, her mother Ellie Carmichael received an anonymous phone call, telling her to go to an address on [[Kings Highway (Brooklyn)|King's Highway]].&lt;ref name="Canarsie" /&gt; The police have not identified the caller.&lt;ref name="Canarsie" /&gt; The mother contacted police, and officers from the 67th [[Precinct]] and [[Emergency Service Unit]]s searched the premises of an abandoned, burned house. They discovered Moore's nude body outside, wrapped in a blanket.&lt;ref name="Canarsie" /&gt; Police sources said that the young woman had been beaten severely about her head and chest.&lt;ref name="Canarsie" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nobias"/&gt; The basement had been flooded in an apparent attempt to destroy forensic evidence.

==Trial and details==
Two male suspects were arrested in the Moore case, in part aided by the report of the 15-year-old girl they had attacked. In 2004 the Brooklyn DA was reported to be seeking the [[death penalty]] against the two defendants, who were indicted on five counts of 1st-degree murder, among other charges, for allegedly kidnapping, raping and murdering Romona Moore, 21.  They faced separate charges for their attack on the 15-year-old.&lt;ref name="deathpenalty"/&gt;

The details of Moore's kidnapping, captivity, and murder were recounted in the prosecutor's opening statement at the trial, which started on January 18, 2006:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Prosecutor Anna-Sigga Nicolazzi said two thugs terrorized Romona Moore for days in a Brooklyn basement in April 2003, repeatedly raping her and attacking her with a knife, a saw, a hammer and a barbell. Defendants Troy Hendrix, 22, and Kayson Pearson, 23, are also charged with kidnapping and raping a 15-year-old girl days after they allegedly killed Moore. "Romona Moore's injuries are indescribable,' said Nicolazzi. "The horror she endured, the torture she endured will become clear."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=January 19, 2006 |title=Court Hears Brutal Telling Of Hunter Student's Death |publisher=The New York Daily News |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/2006/01/19/2006-01-19_court_hears_brutal_telling_of_hunter_stu.html |accessdate=2007-11-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080817011847/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/2006/01/19/2006-01-19_court_hears_brutal_telling_of_hunter_stu.html |archivedate=August 17, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Additional details were revealed in testimony about evidence.

=== Witness testimony ===
Romando Jack, a friend of Hendrix and Pearson, testified to seeing Moore chained and held as a captive by Pearson and Hendrix in the basement of a house but at the time did not report this to the police; he went to a baby shower and later returned home to Maryland.&lt;ref name="Romando_Jack"&gt;{{cite web| date =March 3, 2006| author =Jen Chung| title =Witness in 2003 Murder Testifies| publisher =Gothamist| url =http://gothamist.com/2006/03/03/witness_in_2003.php| accessdate =2007-11-12| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20081023062315/http://gothamist.com/2006/03/03/witness_in_2003.php| archivedate =October 23, 2008| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jack told his fiancée and her uncle about the young woman being abused and held captive. He said during the trial that he thought his uncle may have called the police.&lt;ref name="Romando_Jack" /&gt; A female witness testified in court, but changed her testimony three times. She said she had also suffered sexual abuse and beatings.&lt;ref name="Female_Witness"&gt;{{cite web|date=March 15, 2006 |title=Principal Witness Refuted in Hunter College Student Murder |publisher=The Epoch Times |url=http://en.epochtimes.com/news/6-3-15/39316.html |accessdate=2007-11-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926221711/http://en.epochtimes.com/news/6-3-15/39316.html |archivedate=September 26, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Escape attempt and mistrial===
The courtroom was thrown into chaos on January 19, 2006, when defendant Pearson stabbed his attorney on his way out of the courtroom. Defendant Hendrix jumped a barricade and tried to take a gun from one of the [[bailiff]]s, in order to make their escape.&lt;ref name="attacked"&gt;{{cite news|date =January 20, 2006|title =New York: Brooklyn: Lawyer Attacked In Courtroom| work =The New York Times| url =https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9906EEDB123FF933A15752C0A9609C8B63&amp;n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fSubjects%2fL%2fLegal%20Profession| accessdate =2007-11-12 | first=Michael | last=Brick}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both men were subdued by officers.&lt;ref name="Stab"&gt;{{cite news|date=January 20, 2006 |title=Stab Chaos in Court - Attorney knifed as suspects bring bloody mayhem to Brooklyn murder trial |publisher=The New York Daily News |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/2006/01/20/2006-01-20_stab_chaos_in_court_attorney_knifed_as_s.html |accessdate=2007-11-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081023052652/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/2006/01/20/2006-01-20_stab_chaos_in_court_attorney_knifed_as_s.html |archivedate=October 23, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Newspaper"&gt;{{cite news|date =January 20, 2006| title =Rape-Slay Trial Escape Attempt| publisher =New York Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two men were charged with "assault, resisting arrest and attempted escape."&lt;ref name="attacked"/&gt;

The judge declared a [[mistrial (law)|mistrial]] due to Pearson's attack on his lawyer in the courtroom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| date =January 23, 2006|title =Mistrial declared after lawyer stabbed| publisher =ABC Eyewitness News 7Online.com| url =http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=local&amp;id=3837778| accessdate =2007-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; New charges were brought against the two defendants for their attack, and a new trial was quickly scheduled.

==Main trial==
A second kidnapping and murder trial was begun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=January 24, 2006 |title=New Court Trauma - Mistrial for duo in melee |publisher=The New York Daily News |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/2006/01/24/2006-01-24_new_court_trauma_mistrial_for_duo_in_mel.html |accessdate=2007-11-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081023052657/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/2006/01/24/2006-01-24_new_court_trauma_mistrial_for_duo_in_mel.html |archivedate=October 23, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 23, 2006, the district attorney announced the jury conviction of Hendrix and Pearson on charges of  kidnapping, rape, torture and first-degree murder of Romona Moore, 21.&lt;ref name="nytverdict"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/24/nyregion/24murder.html Michael Brick, "2 Guilty in 2003 Killing of College Student"], ''New York Times,'' 24 March 2006, accessed 1 April 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| date =March 23, 2006| title =Kings County District Attorney Charles J.

After the verdict was announced, Moore's mother Ellie Carmichael spoke to the press in front of TV cameras; she said she had received justice inside the courtroom if not outside, and strongly criticized press and police for their conduct since her daughter's disappearance and murder. She said, "All I got was nothing but disrespect from the media and the police."&lt;ref name="nytverdict"/&gt;

===Sentencing===
On April 11, 2006, Pearson and Hendrix were both sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.&lt;ref name="life"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/12/nyregion/12sentence.html|title=College Student's Killers Are Sentenced to Life in Prison|date=12 April 2006|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=13 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://brooklyn.news12.com/news/two-brooklyn-men-get-life-in-prison-for-2003-murder-of-college-student-1.8251755|title=Two Brooklyn men get life in prison for 2003 murder of college student|date=11 April 2006|work=[[News 12 Brooklyn]]|accessdate=13 January 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160119170719/http://brooklyn.news12.com/news/two-brooklyn-men-get-life-in-prison-for-2003-murder-of-college-student-1.8251755|archive-date=2016-01-19|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They received an additional 22 years for their attacks in the court while seeking escape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| date =November 21, 2006|title =Killer's 'Fun' Day In Court | publisher =The New York Post| url =https://nypost.com/2006/11/21/killers-fun-day-in-court/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mother files bias lawsuit against NYPD==
As Moore's family awaited sentencing of the convicted defendants, their daughter's case was superseded by media attention related to the announcement of a grand jury indictment across the street in another courtroom in the abduction and murder of [[Imette St. Guillen]], a graduate student at [[John Jay College of Criminal Justice]] who had lived on the Upper West Side. She had also been tortured and raped before her death.&lt;ref name="Eclipsed"&gt;{{cite news|date =March 23, 2006|title = Awaiting Verdict, Victim's Family Feels '03 Killing Is Eclipsed Again| publisher =The New York Times| url =https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/23/nyregion/23murder.html?_r=1&amp;ex=1183089600&amp;en=be5ae4588ff11a55&amp;ei=5070&amp;oref=slogin|accessdate =2007-11-12 | first=Michael | last=Brick}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moore's family felt that in 2003, when their daughter disappeared, neither the police nor the press took her case seriously. They did not search as hard for her as for Svetlana Aronov, a white art rare book dealer who had disappeared in Manhattan at about the same time, nor did they have a press conference to call attention to the honor student's disappearance. The Moore relatives initially had posted fliers in their neighborhood when the police declined to open an investigation, saying that sometimes young people took off for a few days.&lt;ref name="Eclipsed" /&gt; It turned out that Moore was still alive and subject to torture when the police closed her case.&lt;ref name="bias"/&gt; The police have said that other circumstances in the Moore and Aronov cases were different.&lt;ref name="difference"&gt;{{cite web| date =May 14, 2003| title =Police Defend Differences in Searches for 2 Women| publisher =The New York Times| url =http://www.svetlanaaronov.com/articles/0514nyt.htm| accessdate =2007-11-12| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20070930095636/http://www.svetlanaaronov.com/articles/0514nyt.htm| archivedate =September 30, 2007| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the conclusion of the trial of the murderers of her daughter, on April 3, 2008, Moore's mother Elle Carmichael filed a federal lawsuit against the NYPD,&lt;ref name="bias"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FedLawsuit1"&gt;{{cite web| date=May 7, 2008| title=Federal Lawsuit to Challenge Law Enforcement on Ignoring Crimes Against Black Women and Girls: Romona Moore| publisher=What About Our Daughters| url=http://www.whataboutourdaughters.com/2008/05/federal-lawsuit-to-challenge-law-enforcement-on-ignoring-crimes-against-black-women-and-girlsromona-moore/| accessdate=2009-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FedLawsuit2"&gt;{{cite web| date=May 6, 2008| title=NYPD Inaction Over a Missing Black Woman Found Dead Sparks a Historic Racial-Bias Lawsuit| publisher=The Village Voice| url=http://www.villagevoice.com/2008-05-06/news/missing-in-action/1| accessdate=2009-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; alleging that they did not take sufficient action in cases of missing black women and girls. The historic racial-bias lawsuit was cleared for trial by Brooklyn Federal District Judge [[Nina Gershon]].&lt;ref name="bias"&gt;{{cite news| date=April 3, 2008|title=Mother of slain girl wins OK to sue police for bias in lack of investigation| publisher=New York Daily News| url =http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/brooklyn/2008/04/03/2008-04-03_mother_of_slain_girl_wins_ok_to_sue_poli-1.html| accessdate=2008-04-07 | first=Nancie L. | last=Katz}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Carmichael is claiming that NYPD "used a double standard" by not mounting a vigorous search for Moore while "aggressively pursuing the disappearance of white women."&lt;ref name="bias" /&gt; The police at the 67th Precinct had rejected Carmichael's initial request to search for her daughter by saying that "she was probably off with a boyfriend."&lt;ref name="bias" /&gt; Carmichael contrasted the NYPD's actions in failing to investigate the disappearance of her daughter with their pursuit of evidence in the case of Svetlana Aronov, a white woman.&lt;ref name="bias" /&gt; City Attorney Robyn Pullio indicated that she was looking forward to a hearing in this case so that all facts could be heard.&lt;ref name="bias" /&gt;

In August 2014, Federal District Judge Nina Gershon dismissed Carmichael's bias case, ruling that there was no evidence to show there was "a widespread, racially-motivated practice within the NYPD of delays in listing minorities missing or investigating the circumstances."

'''Katherine Mary Lyon''' (aged 10),  and '''Sheila Mary Lyon''' (aged 12) were sisters who [[Missing person|disappeared without a trace]] during a March 25, 1975 trip to a shopping mall in the [[Wheaton, Maryland]] suburb of [[Washington, D.C.]]. Known colloquially as '''The Lyon Sisters,''' their case resulted in one of the largest police investigations in [[Washington Metropolitan Area]] history.    

In 2013, a team of [[cold case]] investigators with the [[Montgomery County, Maryland]], police made a break in the case. They focused on Lloyd Lee Welch, Jr., then serving a lengthy prison sentence in [[Delaware]] for child sexual abuse, the culmination of a long criminal record that had begun a few years after the girls' disappearance with a burglary arrest in their jurisdiction. In September 2017, Welch pleaded guilty to two counts of [[first-degree murder]] for the abduction and murder of the two sisters.&lt;ref name="guilty plea" /&gt;  It had long been "one of the most high-profile unsolved cases in the D.C. area."&lt;ref name="WP-20140211"/&gt;  The girls' remains have never been found.

Police records show that during the original investigation, Welch came forward a week after the girls' disappearance and falsely told a security guard at the shopping center visited by the girls (immediately before they disappeared) that he had witnessed another man abduct them there.  The description Welch provided of the other man matched a description that newspapers and other media already had provided the public.  According to that description, a conservatively dressed man had demonstrated a new type of [[audiocassette]] player at the shopping mall as children and teens, including the Lyon sisters, gathered near him.  A short time after Welch told this story to the mall security guard trying to cast suspicion on the other man, he was questioned at a police station, failed a [[lie detector]] test, admitted he had lied, was released and was not questioned again until more than 38 years later.&lt;ref name="WP 2015 story"&gt;{{cite news|last=Morse|first=Dan|title=Imprisoned sex offender charged with murder in 1975 Lyon sisters case|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/crime/investigators-prepare-announcement-in-1975-missing-girls-case/2015/07/14/2ca2e68c-2a2f-11e5-a250-42bd812efc09_story.html|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|date=July 15, 2015|accessdate=July 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the reopening of the case, police discovered that a [[mug shot]] taken of Welch in 1977 bore a strong resemblance to a [[police sketch]] of a possible suspect who had been seen staring inappropriately at the Lyon sisters in the shopping mall. Detectives began interviewing Welch in prison; he made statements that further implicated him although he continued to protest his innocence. One of his relatives told them he had helped Welch burn two heavy, bloodied [[duffel bag]]s in [[Bedford County, Virginia]]. In July 2015, Welch was indicted and charged with the girls' murders there; he pleaded guilty to murder two years later.&lt;ref name="guilty plea"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://wset.com/news/local/man-pleads-guilty-to-murdering-lyon-sisters-in-1975|title=Man pleads guilty to murdering Lyon sisters in 1975, will serve 48 years in prison|last=Doss|first=Annie Andersen &amp; Catherine|work=WSET|access-date=November 23, 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; His uncle is a person of interest as well.&lt;ref name="WP 2015 story" /&gt;

==Background to the sisters' disappearance==
The two sisters were born to John and Mary Lyon in [[Kensington, Maryland]]. They had an older brother, Jay, who later became a policeman.  Their father, John Lyon, was a well-known radio personality at [[WMAL (AM)|WMAL]], a local radio station then held by the owner of the ABC Television affiliate in Washington and the now-defunct ''[[Washington Star]]''; he later worked as a victims' counselor. The sisters' disappearance continued to be featured in high-profile stories in the national media for months.

Located a half-mile away from their home was Wheaton Plaza shopping mall (now [[Westfield Wheaton]]). On March 25, 1975, Katherine and Sheila Lyon walked to the mall to see the Easter exhibits. It was their spring vacation and they planned to have lunch at the Orange Bowl, which was part of the mall. They left home between 11:00 AM and noon. Their mother had instructed them to return home by 4:00 PM; when they had not arrived by 7:00 PM, the police were called and an extensive search was conducted.&lt;ref name="WP-20140211"/&gt; Police felt comfortable enough with the accuracy of this timeline to release it to the public.

*'''11:00 AM''' to '''Noon''': The girls leave home.
*'''1:00 PM''': A neighborhood child sees both of the girls together outside the Orange Bowl speaking to an unidentified man, according to what he later tells investigators. 
*'''2:00 PM''': The girls' older brother sees them at the Orange Bowl eating pizza together.
*'''2:30''' to '''3:00 PM''': A friend sees the girls walking westward down a street near the mall which would have been one of the most direct routes from the mall to their home. This is the final sighting of the sisters that is absolutely confirmed by the police.
*'''4:00 PM''': This curfew set by their mother passes. The girls are expected home and do not arrive.
*'''7:00 PM''': Police are called. The investigation and an active search by professionals begin.

==Police investigation==
Police were told by witnesses that the sisters were in the [[Westfield Wheaton|Wheaton Plaza]] mall at approximately 1 PM. A neighborhood boy, who knew the sisters, reported that he saw them together outside the Orange Bowl speaking with an unidentified man, about 6 feet tall, 50 to 60 years old, and wearing a brown suit. The man was carrying a briefcase with a tape recorder inside; there were also other children around who were speaking into a microphone he was holding. The witness's description of the man led authorities to view the unknown person as a prime suspect in the Lyon sisters' case and two composite sketches of the man were created.

Police investigating the case followed up on reports from several people who said they recognized the sketch of the unknown man with the briefcase. Press reports indicated that a man matching the sketch was seen a few weeks earlier at the [[Marlow Heights Shopping Center]] and the [[Iverson Mall]], both in neighboring [[Prince George's County, Maryland]]. These people reported that he had approached several young girls and asked them to read an answering machine message typed on an index card into his hand-held microphone. The police never publicly acknowledged a direct link between these reports and the Lyon sisters' disappearance.

As the weeks wore on, numerous volunteer groups combed vacant lots and stream beds for the sisters. The search continued and press interest reached such a fever pitch that on May 23, 1975, Maryland Lt. Gov. [[Blair Lee III|Blair Lee]] ordered 122 [[Maryland Army National Guard|National Guardsmen]] to participate in a search of a Montgomery County forest for the missing girls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost_historical/access/143626632.html?dids=143626632:143626632&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;date=May+23%2C+1975&amp;author=By+Deborah+Sue+YaegerWashington+Post+Staff+Writer&amp;pub=The+Washington+Post++(1974-Current+file)&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=B1&amp;desc=Md.+Guardsmen+to+Join+Hunt+for+Lyon+Sisters |title=Md. Guardsmen to Join Hunt for Lyon Sisters |publisher=Pqasb.pqarchiver.com |date=May 23, 1975 |accessdate=July 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

No trace of the girls was ever found.

A new lead was discovered as of September 20, 2014. The police searched the woods of [[Thaxton, Virginia]], and entered a house in [[Hyattsville, Maryland]], seizing several items.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wjla.com/articles/2014/09/police-search-property-in-sw-virginia-in-40-year-old-md-lyon-sisters-disappearance-case-107200.html Police search property in SW Virginia in 40-year-old Md. Lyon sisters disappearance case] WJLA. September 16, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; These searches were relevant to the new suspect named Lloyd Welch and his relatives.

===False leads===
On April 7, 1975, about two weeks after their disappearance, a witness in [[Manassas, Virginia]], reported seeing two girls resembling Sheila and Katherine in the rear of a beige 1968 [[Ford]] station wagon. The witness stated that the girls were bound and gagged in the vehicle. The driver of the station wagon resembled the man in the publicly available sketch of the prime suspect. The witness further claimed that when the driver spotted the witness tailing him, he ran a red light and sped west on Route 234 towards [[Interstate 66]] in [[Virginia]]. The station wagon had Maryland license plates with the possible combination "DMT-6**." The last two numbers are unknown due to the bending of the car's plate. The known combination was issued in [[Cumberland, Maryland|Cumberland]], [[Hagerstown, Maryland|Hagerstown]], and [[Baltimore]], Maryland at the time. This supposed sighting inspired a small army of mobile [[Cb radio|citizen band (CB) radio]] users to scour the area throughout the evening and into the night with a running commentary and chatter but without any tangible results. A search for matching plate numbers failed to produce any information. Although this witness's report was at first treated as credible, and a media firestorm erupted because of it, it was later deemed "questionable" by police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.charleyproject.org/cases/l/lyon_sheila.html |title=Sheila Mary Lyon |publisher=The Charley Project |date= |accessdate=July 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite its questionable nature, media continue to mention this report as credible.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

Several phone calls from people claiming to have the girls and offering to exchange them for ransom money were made to the Lyon family in the immediate aftermath of the sisters' disappearances. The one that went the furthest and that had seemed most credible began with an anonymous male voice on April 4, 1975, and demanded that John Lyon leave a briefcase with $10,000 inside an [[Annapolis, Maryland]], courthouse restroom. The money was left just as the instructions from the caller required, but the money was never claimed. This same anonymous person called John Lyon later and maintained that police had surrounded the courthouse and he could not retrieve the ransom. The man was told that he would have to show some evidence of having the Lyon sisters in his custody before another attempt would be made to leave him a ransom. Although the caller then said he would be in touch with the family, he never contacted them again.

===Suspects===
Fred Howard Coffey was convicted in 1987 for the 1979 beating, strangulation murder, and molestation of a 10-year-old girl in North Carolina and ({{As of|2012|lc=on}}) is serving a life sentence (after an earlier death sentence was overturned) in a North Carolina prison. Authorities learned that he interviewed for a job (and was subsequently employed) in  [[Silver Spring, Maryland]], six days after the Lyon sisters vanished. Silver Spring is a short distance from Wheaton Plaza. Investigators have been unable to determine if Coffey is connected to the case, and he was never charged in the disappearances.

Raymond Rudolph Mileski Sr. was another possible suspect named in press reports. Mileski resided in [[Suitland, Maryland]], in 1975, not far from the malls in Prince George's County that had reported a man with a microphone approaching young girls. In a family disagreement, Mileski murdered his wife and teenage son and wounded another son inside their home in November 1977. He was convicted of the homicides and sentenced to 40 years in prison. Based on both prison informants' tips and Mileski's own claims to know something about the Lyon sisters case, which he offered to share more fully in exchange for more favorable prison conditions, authorities searched his former residence in April 1982, but no evidence was discovered. Mileski died in prison in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.websleuths.com/forums/archive/index.php/t-38914 |title=The Murder of Kathy Lynn Beatty [Archive&amp;#93; - Websleuths Crime Sleuthing Community |publisher=[[Websleuths]] |date= |accessdate=July 6, 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205134340/http://www.websleuths.com/forums/archive/index.php/t-38914|archivedate=February 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Brennan Crutchley]] had also been considered a suspect.

===Lloyd Welch===
After the disappearance, a friend of the Lyon sisters, a girl who was in their age bracket, described to detectives how a long-haired man at the mall had stared at the girls so long and so intently that she confronted him. A sketch artist made a drawing based on her description: white, late teens or early 20s, acne on his face, scars on his left cheek, shabbily dressed. That sketch, though, appears not to have been widely disseminated. The drawing shows similarities to a 1977 mug shot of Lloyd Welch.&lt;ref name="WP 2015 story" /&gt;

The description from the sisters' friend contrasted sharply with the only description of a possible suspect that was made public in 1975, that of the well-groomed, conservatively dressed person eventually labeled "tape recorder man."  Aside from the strong differences in facial features, hair and clothing, the long-haired man and "tape recorder man" were several decades apart in age.

The day that newspapers printed a description of the conservatively dressed man carrying a briefcase with audiocassette recorder and holding a microphone, Lloyd Welch returned to Wheaton Plaza mall and told a security guard that he had been there the week before. He said he had seen a man with a tape recorder talking to two girls and later, forcing the girls into a car, according to court records. Montgomery investigators were summoned to the mall and took Welch to a nearby police station to interview him. They gave him a polygraph test.  Told he had failed it, he admitted he had provided false information about witnessing the abduction and was released by police, according to documents in the case.&lt;ref name="WP 2015 story" /&gt;  For more than 38 years thereafter, information about Welch's possible involvement in the case was accessible only via a search of police records. The identity of the Lyon sisters' female friend who had told police about him was never published and remains confidential to this day.

Welch's cousin, Henry Parker, told detectives in December 2014 that in 1975 he met Welch at a property on Taylor's Mountain Road, in [[Thaxton, Virginia]]. Parker said he helped remove two army-style [[duffel bag]]s from Welch's vehicle. Each bag "weighed about 60 or 70 pounds and smelled like 'death,'" according to a search warrant affidavit, which was filed and sealed in January 2015. Moreover, Parker said the bags had been covered in red stains.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://wtop.com/local/2015/07/after-indictment-new-information-expected-in-lyon-sisters-disappearance/slide/1/|title=Police: Lyon sisters investigation enters new phase|date=July 16, 2015|work=WTOP|access-date=March 26, 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Without knowing their contents, Parker threw the bags into a fire.&lt;ref name="WP 2015 story" /&gt;

In February 2014, Welch was named as a [[person of interest]] in the case. Police said Welch, who was 18 years old in 1975, and has since been convicted of rapes in three other states, had been "seen 'paying attention' to the sisters." &lt;ref name="WP-20140211"&gt;{{cite news|title=Inmate Lloyd Welch named as 'person of interest' in 1975 Lyon sisters case|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/crime/inmate-named-as-person-of-interest-in-1975-missing-sisters-case/2014/02/11/38f4d856-9330-11e3-84e1-27626c5ef5fb_story.html|accessdate=February 11, 2014|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=February 11, 2014|author=Justin Jouvenal|author2=Dan Morse}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over a year later, in July 2015, Welch, then serving a lengthy sentence in [[Delaware]] on a child-molestation conviction, was indicted on first-degree felony murder for his alleged involvement in the deaths of Katherine and Sheila Lyon. He was also charged with abduction with intent to defile. The location of any remains of the girls' bodies is still unknown. Had Welch been brought to trial without the girls' bodies entered into evidence, it would have been the longest time to have elapsed between a murder and a trial in a [[Murder conviction without a body|bodiless murder]] conviction.&lt;ref name="WP 2015 story" /&gt;

Ultimately, in September 2017, Welch pleaded guilty to two counts of [[first-degree murder]] "for the abduction and killing of Katherine and Shelia Lyon in 1975."&lt;ref name="guilty plea" /&gt;

[[File:Rael Artel and Joanna Rajkowska's installation.jpg|thumb|Curator Rael Artel talking in front of the installation "Greeting from the Jerusalem Avenue" by Polish artist Joanna Rajkowska]]
'''''My Poland. On Recalling and Forgetting''''' is the first [[Holocaust]]-themed art exhibition in Estonia, taking place at [[Tartu Art Museum]] in early 2015,&lt;ref name="muuseum" /&gt;&lt;ref name="esimene"&gt;[http://www.muurileht.ee/eesti-esimene-holokaustiteemaline-kunstinaitus/ "SEL LAUPÄEVAL AVATAKSE EESTI ESIMENE HOLOKAUSTITEEMALINE KUNSTINÄITUS"] Müürileht, 3 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt; seventy years after the end of World War II and the liberation of the [[Nazi extermination camp]]s.{{r|kataloog}} The exhibition, curated by museum's director [[Rael Artel]], received a lot of attention from Estonian society and from both Estonian and international media. It brough out the differences of opinion and initiated a public debate about the reflection of Holocaust and [[freedom of speech]], [[censorship]] and [[self-censorship]] in art. Originally, eight contemporary artworks were exhibited, one of them by an Estonian artist and seven from Polish artists (incl. one Polish–Israeli and one American with Polish Jewish roots). Soon after the opening of the exhibition the museum limited access to two works of art because of public criticism. Later, both of them were removed from the exhibition.&lt;ref name="muuseum" /&gt;

The name of the exhibition ''My Poland'' emphasizes curators personal perspective to [[Polish art|Polish contemporary art]] where Holocaust and the [[Second World War]] is a distinctive theme. The name refers to a popular Estonian books series ("My Estonia", "My Mexico", "My St. Petersburg", etc.) which also focuses on authors' personal impressions of different countries.

The works selected for the exhibition in Tartu Art Museum are made by well-known Polish artists most of whom have participated in the [[Venice Biennale]].&lt;ref name="muuseum"&gt;[http://tartmus.ee/files/wordpress/?page_id=47 ''My Poland''] on the homepage of Tartu Art Museum&lt;/ref&gt; Curator Rael Artel has said that although she tried to find comparable works from Estonian art, the only Holocaust themed work was John Smith's painting ''Holocaust''.&lt;ref name="kataloog" /&gt;

The exhibition is accompanied by a publication put together by Rael Artel and designed by Mikk Heinsoo. The exhibition was supported by [[The Cultural Endowment of Estonia]] and [[Estonian Ministry of Culture]]. ''My Poland'' is curated by the director of Tartu Art Museum Rael Artel and exhibition's coordinator is Julia Polujanenkova, museums' keeper of the contemporary art.&lt;ref name="muuseum" /&gt;

==Removal of videos from the exhibition==
''My Poland'' was opened on Saturday, 7 February.&lt;ref name="muuseum" /&gt; On Tuesday, Tartu Art Museum announced that access to two most criticized videos was being limited. Visitors could only see those videos by stating a direct request and after being introduced to curator's written explanation. Museum's director Artel made a full apology to everyone the display offended.&lt;ref name="vabandust"&gt;[http://tartu.postimees.ee/3086437/tartu-kunstimuuseumi-direktor-palume-vabandust-koigilt-keda-valjapanek-on-riivanud "Tartu kunstimuuseumi direktor: palume vabandust kõigilt, keda väljapanek on riivanud"] Postimees, 10 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Estonian Ministry of Culture held a discussion which was attended by Minister of Culture [[Urve Tiidus]] and the representatives of [[Jews in Estonia|Jewish community in Estonia]]. After the discussion Tiidus called the videos offending and Tartu Art Museum removed them from the exhibition entirely.&lt;ref name="arutelul"&gt;[http://www.postimees.ee/3088427/ministeeriumis-toimunud-arutelul-leiti-et-holokaustiteemaline-naitus-on-solvav "Ministeeriumis toimunud arutelul leiti, et holokaustiteemaline näitus on solvav"] Postimees, 11 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

As the museum was closed on Monday and Tuesday and the videos were already removed by Wednesday afternoon, the videos in question were introduced only to a small part of exhibition visitors. Therefore, majority of people who have participated in the debate have not been familiar with the content of the videos or knew them only on the basis of clips shown in the news and on the basis of written summaries.&lt;ref name="terev"&gt;[http://etv.err.ee/v/meelelahutus/terevisioon/saated/905777f5-f141-47fc-93a2-10b4d1763852 "Terevisioon"] ERR, 19 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

The removal of videos has been evaluated differently. For example, journalist Kadri Veermäe from major Estonian daily [[Postimees]] interpreted it as a censorship or self-censorship.&lt;ref name="kultuuriinimesi" /&gt; On the other hand, [[Kaarel Tarand]], former editor-in-chief of Estonian main cultural newspaper [[Sirp]], did not consider this as a result of censorship.&lt;ref name="tarand"&gt;Siim Randla [http://www.ohtuleht.ee/662580/kaarel-tarand-ei-nae-holokausti-naituselt-teoste-eemaldamises-tsensuuri "Kaarel Tarand ei näe holokausti näituselt teoste eemaldamises tsensuuri", 16 February 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; Estonian artist Kiwa regarded it as the criminalization of art.&lt;ref name="kiwa" /&gt;

After videos were removed, the museum decided to use that room do present the documentation about the public discussion about the exhibition on both traditional and social media, considering the themes of censure and self-censorship.&lt;ref name="Artel"&gt;Raimu Hanson [http://tartu.postimees.ee/3096479/rael-artel-naitustel-voiks-kaia-kunsti-aga-mitte-skandaali-parast "Rael Artel: näitustel võiks käia kunsti, aga mitte skandaali pärast"] Postimees, 19 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works and artists==
* In [[Yael Bartana]]'s video ''Dreams and Nightmares'' (''Mary Koszmary'', 2007), a politician is talking to a deserted overgrown stadium where only a handful of scouts are listening, about reconciliation on Jews and Poles, the need for Jews to return to restore Poland's cultural diversity and create a shared future.&lt;ref name="kataloog"&gt;[http://tartmus.ee/files/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Minu_Poola_A5_32lk_preview_final.pdf Näituse kataloog] (PDF)&lt;/ref&gt; Estonian art theorist Indrek Grigor considers it to be the central work of the exhibition: ˮFor a person like me, for whom Jews have largely been just literary characters from [[Isaac Babel]]'s ''[[Odessa Tales]]'', this video gave a glimpse of the actual cultural shock Poland went through after the genocide. If we were to translate that experience into the context of Estonian culture we could try to reappraise the influence of Russian culture on Estonia's cultural diversity and its very viability!"&lt;ref name="Grigor"&gt;Indrek Grigor [http://kultuur.postimees.ee/3094745/veel-kord-holokaustinaitusest-neil-seal-poolas "Veel kord holokaustinäitusest: Neil seal Poolas"] Postimees, 17 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Zbigniew Libera]]'s photograph from the series ''Residents'' (2003) shows smiling people in analogous positions to people in a famous photograph depicting [[Auschwitz]] prisoners being released.&lt;ref name="kataloog" /&gt; 
* Documentation of ''Greetings from Jerusalem Avenue'' (2002) by [[Joanna Rajkowska]] introduces one of the most striking monuments of [[Warsaw]], the capital of Poland: an artificial palm tree, that artist conceived while visiting Jerusalem. This work reminds the cultural diversity of pre-war Poland. It is set up on the Jerusalem Avenue in Warsaw.&lt;ref name="kataloog" /&gt; ˮTo me the highlight of the documentation of Rajkowska's work presented on the exhibition is not actually connected with the author but with the human rights activist campaign where a traditional Palestinian headscarf was tied around the palm tree,ˮ says Indrek Grigor.&lt;ref name="Grigor" /&gt;
* John Smith's (a pseudonym used by [[Marko Mäetamm]] and [[Kaido Ole]]) painting ''Holocaust'' portrays two men driving through a landscape, seeing writing "Holocaust" on a hilltop in resemblance to the famous landmark "Hollywood". According to Artel, that painting draws attention to the commercialization of Holocaust by the movie industry led by Hollywood, as it has transformed the pain of millions of people into money.&lt;ref name="kataloog" /&gt;
* Installation ''Warsaw'' (2005) by [[Wilhelm Sasnal]] consists of the word ''Warsaw'' which is written on a white wall using a gunpowder-coated wire, cut in half into words WAR and SAW - "SAW WAR".&lt;ref name="kataloog" /&gt;
* Short comic by American artist [[Art Spiegelman]] ''Breakdowns: Portrait of the Artist as a Young %@?*!'' (2008) is describing Jewish family heirloom as a monster locked in a chest, creating a perpetual sense of guilt. It can be understood as the guilt of surviving Holocaust. [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning two-volume novel ''[[Maus]]'' (1991) by Spiegelman is also available on the exhibition.&lt;ref name="kataloog" /&gt; In the review of the exhibition, Indrek Grigor sees a parallel between Spiegelman's comic and the historical experience of Estonians: ˮ...just like the Jewish community is haunted by the Holocaust trauma from generation to generation as it has been shown on the exhibition by the autobiographical comics of American cartoonist Art Spiegelman; so, too, the present writer has a box of letters sent from Siberia to Estonia describing how people dug a pentagon shaped campfire, danced and played around it and thanked their dear leader Stalin for their daily bread."&lt;ref name="Grigor" /&gt;
* ''The Game of Tag'' (1999) by [[Artur Żmijewski (filmmaker)|Artur Żmijewski]] was exhibited on the 7th [[Berlin Biennale]] in 2012.&lt;ref name="kataloog" /&gt;&lt;ref name="saksa"&gt;[http://maailm.postimees.ee/3086441/saksa-meedia-kirjutas-kullimangu-keelamise-puhul-tsensuurist-mitte-sokist "Saksa meedia kirjutas «Kullimängu» keelamise puhul tsensuurist, mitte šokist"] Postimees, 10 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The author commented his work on the Estonian news program ''[[Aktuaalne kaamera]]'' as follows: ˮIt is a very serious situation. There are the bodies of living people, the situation is alive – instead of a tragedy we just have life."&lt;ref name="autor" /&gt; In the publication which accompanies the exhibition, curator Rael Artel connected ''The Game of Tag'' with the notion of 'bare life' by philosopher [[Giorgio Agamben]] referring to a human being who has lost all legal rights and is not protected by any cultural conventions.&lt;ref name="kataloog" /&gt; In ''Postimees'', Kadri Veermäe wrote about the background of the video: "Certainly, there are many of those who have watched Żmijewski's ''The Game of Tag'' on the Internet and have been surprised that they are actually not that shocked. The one who was shocked was Żmijewski himself when he was an assistant teacher and went on an excursion to the camps with school children who started cheerfully playing tag in the concentration camp's gas chambers."&lt;ref name="Veermäe"&gt;Kadri Veermäe [http://arvamus.postimees.ee/3087869/kadri-veermae-kullimang-gaasikambris "Kullimäng gaasikambris"] Postimees, 12 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Estonian Jewish semiotician and culture theorist [[Mihhail Lotman]] interpretes the situation as follows: "A prospective viewer's cognitive dissonance between the game and Holocaust is the aspect that should be shocking. But this arises in the mind of the viewer, not on screen or at shooting. We can start by recognizing that none of the participants are Jewish /---/. Further, anyone who knows something about history knows that men and women were separated in the camps /---/. Maybe the best justification for this work (in terms of its quality I have big doubts) is that it can create a lot of grief. We need so little to bring back the memory of Holocaust."&lt;ref name="Lotman"&gt;Mihhail Lotman [http://www.lotman.ee/blogi/meie-vaike-holokaustiskandaal "Meie väike holokaustiskandaal"] Mihhail Lotman's blog, 11 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;
* The video ''80064'' (2004) by Artur Żmijewski features a conversation with former prisoner of Auschwitz Józef Tarnawa who, after a negotiation, lets the artist to renew his concentration camp tattoo.&lt;ref name="kataloog" /&gt; According to Żmijewski, it symbolizes renewing the man's honour: ˮIn the video he is handled like a monument from the past which must be kept in good condition. The other meaning is to repeat the violent act from the past. In both films I tried to reopen up the past, truly reopen, not just recall, but really jump into that past moment when the tattoo was made and people were in the gas chambers."&lt;ref name="autor" /&gt; Semiotician Mihhail Lotman regards the video as shocking but also multidimensional: ˮ92-year-old Auschwitz survivor Józef Tarnawa eventually agrees and lets to renew his tattoo 80064. The man asks not to do so, saying that it is visible enough and after, it would not be authentic etc. But director Artur Żmijewski is ruthless and soon the old man surrenders and lets them to renew his tattoo. In the end he is not happy with the result, he feels like a piece of furniture. In another interview the director says that of course he agreed in the end because he got 500 euros for it and they had a contract. The message here is vague and might be multidimensional /---/. I draw the attention of watchful jewish community to the aspect that no one said it is a Jew in the video. There is nothing distinctive about his appearances, even the artist says that he does not know what the old man's nationality is and that it doesn't even really matter. Maybe it is the Polish community who should protest?"&lt;ref name="Lotman" /&gt;

==Public response==
On the opening day, [[Eesti Televisioon]]'s news program ''Aktuaalne kaamera'' asked the chairwoman of Tartu Jewish Community Ilona Smuškina to visit the exhibition My Poland. She found it to be emotionally uncomfortable: ˮI couldn't watch the video of the gas chamber for more than three seconds. But the old man who was tortured in Auschwitz, now he is tortured by the young man who did this artwork."&lt;ref name="keelatud"&gt;[http://kultuur.err.ee/v/kunst/naitus/917d7a19-0d8a-4652-b3f5-2ddcaedec9b8 Tartus avatud holokaustinäitusel "Minu Poola" näidatakse ka Saksamaal keelatud töid] ERR, 6 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards, the chairwoman of Estonian Jewish Community, Alla Jakobson, spoke out in the media. She announced that she feels insulted, she does not consider Artur Żmijewski's videos to be art at all and insists they should be removed from the exhibition: ˮIt is unacceptable and inappropriate to exhibit videos like this in a Holocaust art exhibition."&lt;ref name="solvab"&gt;Kaarel Kressa [http://epl.delfi.ee/news/kultuur/tartu-naitus-solvab-juute?id=70761615 "Tartu näitus solvab juute"] EPL, 11 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 February, a public statement to Estonian state leaders by Estonian Jewish Community was made, saying: "It would be unthinkable to show nudity in an exhibition dedicated to [[Soviet deportations from Estonia]].

Among others, the [[Wiesenthal Center]]'s director [[Efraim Zuroff]] criticized the exhibition,&lt;ref name="zuroff"&gt;[http://kultuur.err.ee/v/kunst/uudis/b0c88f71-10ba-44ef-9477-ac3870b6dce4 "Zuroff: Tartus avatud näitus on haiglane irvitamine juutide massimõrva üle"] ERR, 9 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt; stating that it is not enough to remove two videos as the whole exhibition should be shut down.&lt;ref name="Sokol"&gt;Sam Sokol [http://www.jpost.com/Diaspora/Estonian-museum-apologizes-for-exhibit-making-light-of-Holocaust-391191 Estonian museum apologizes for exhibit making light of Holocaust] The Jerusalem Post, 16 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Main critical arguments include joking about Holocaust, mocking,&lt;ref name="Mikser" /&gt; lack of empathy amongst the artists and the authors of the exhibition,&lt;ref name="empaatiavõimes" /&gt; and the need to identify the boundaries of art. "I think that there should be ethical boundaries of freedom of speech and freedom of expression of art that should not be prescribed by law but should be in the hearts of people," said Laine Randjärv. "Organizers of the exhibition have been ignoring the principles of good practices and the principles of respecting other people and nations," found Jüri Ratas.&lt;ref name="Nestor" /&gt; "The reaction and the triggered debate in the society leads us to ask again where are the boundaries of art," said Urve Tiidus.&lt;ref name="Tiidus juute"&gt;[http://www.postimees.ee/3087253/tiidus-juute-solvanud-naitusest-minu-jaoks-on-kusimus-empaatiavoimes "Tiidus juute solvanud näitusest: minu jaoks on küsimus empaatiavõimes"] Postimees, 10 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

A couple of days later, first statements supporting the curator and Tartu Art Museum started to appear, mostly made by people of art and culture. The criticism was also disputed by the interview to Eesti Televisioon by the author of the most criticized videos, Artur Żmijewski, who said: "We recall the past events and it is not a passive recalling but an active one. My purpose is not to provoke anyone. There are always those who feel provoked but it wasn't my intention."&lt;ref name="autor"&gt;[http://kultuur.err.ee/v/964e50c1-80f5-4808-ab1d-a4c3cf2f7fa9 "Holokaustivideote autor AK intervjuus: minu tööd on valesti mõistetud"] ERR, 11.02.2015&lt;/ref&gt; Among the supporters of the exhibition have been a board member of the [[Contemporary Art Museum of Estonia]] [[Anders Härm]], artist Kiwa, artist [[Jaan Elken]], semiotician [[Mihhail Lotman]], artist [[Marko Mäetamm]] (the single Estonian artist represented on the exhibition), former Minister of Culture [[Rein Lang]], journalist Kadri Veermäe, artist [[Marge Monko]], etc.&lt;ref name="kultuuriinimesi"&gt;[http://kultuur.err.ee/v/kunst/a0a9c12c-cc0e-46b1-ba63-a63f32239ff1 "Holokausti näitusele päitsete pähe panemine kurvastas Eesti kultuuriinimesi"] ERR, 15. veebruar&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kiwa"&gt;[http://kultuur.err.ee/v/kirjandus/489502c9-0482-4181-aad2-cbcb3cf178dc "Kiwa manifest: tagasi keskaega"] ERR, 12 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="härm"&gt;[http://kultuur.err.ee/v/kunst/69bb9349-f202-4dc9-bc63-82f3126b5225 Anders Härm: tõlgendada ilusaid poeetilisi kujundeid antisemiitlikena on absoluutne liialdus] ERR, 12 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lubatavaks"&gt;[http://kultuur.err.ee/v/kunst/92455000-3bde-4112-853b-0bb653e7d3be "Kultuuritegelased hindavad holokausti teema kunstis lubatavaks erinevalt pornograafiast"] ERR, 10 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Monko"&gt;Marge Monko [http://epl.delfi.ee/news/arvamus/marge-monko-kunstniku-lavastatud-kullimang-trauma-ja-maletamine?id=70833721 "Kunstniku lavastatud kullimäng, trauma ja mäletamine"] EPL, 20 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

On ETV morning show ''Terevisioon'', Sirje Helme, the director of Estonian Art Museum Kumu, commented the situation as follows: ˮThis debate can't be about whether it is art or not. The question is, how far can an artwork go in its freedom to sharply touch this or that subject. /.../ I think that there are almost no limits in democratic freedom but some things are agreed upon not to be touched, and Holocaust is certainly one of those things. So the question is not whether it is a good or bad work of art, the problem is that it has touched a subject which is declared to be taboo in Europe and America. /.../ This is a political world, not a world of art. I think this subject does not belong to the art world." Anders Härm responded: ˮI think that there is no such rule. There is no theme more mediated than Holocaust if we talk about the horrors during the Second World War. The work by John Smith referred to this – commercialization of Holocaust. [[Jean Baudrillard]] and [[Umberto Eco]] have also talked about how Hollywood wouldn't let Jews to forgive and Germans to be forgiven." Sirje Helme said: ˮFor me, this question is in black and white. I will stick to my opinion that it is not about art with its aesthetical criteria and sensitivities. The question here is that the topic is sacred and only certain people can engage in it."&lt;ref name="härm" /&gt;

{{Albanian Civil War}}
'''Operation Libelle''' ("Dragonfly" in [[German language|German]]) was an evacuation operation of the [[Bundeswehr|German Armed Forces]] that took place on March 14, 1997 in the [[Albania]]n capital of [[Tirana]]. In the same week, [[United States|American]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hri.org/news/usa/usia/1997/97-03-14_3.usia.html|title=USIA - Transcript: DOD Briefing on Evacuations from Albania, 97-03-14|website=www.hri.org|access-date=2017-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[United Kingdom|British]],&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, John (2009). ''Safeguarding the Nation: The Story of the Modern Royal Navy'', 352pp, Seaforth Publishing, {{ISBN|978 1 84832 043 7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Italy|Italian]] military forces evacuated their citizens from Albania. Operation  Libelle was the first time since [[World War II]] that German infantry soldiers fired shots in combat.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rp-online.de/public/article/politik/deutschland/417415/Tirana-97-Das-erste-Gefecht-der-Bundeswehr.html  RP Online]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Situation in Albania==
In early 1997, riots spread across Albania after the collapse of major pyramid schemes drove the country into a serious economic and social crisis, culminating in the [[Albanian Civil War]]. After [[Military of Albania|army]] and police armories were looted by insurgents, criminals, and civilians, large parts of the country descended into chaos and violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/amp/show/europe-jan-june97-albania_3-10|title=Political Unrest in Albania|work=PBS NewsHour|access-date=2017-12-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 11 all foreign nationals were instructed to leave Albania; Italian and U.S. forces conducted initial evacuation operations. By midday of March 13 the widespread disorder made leaving the country by conventional means nearly impossible. With nowhere to go dozens of people fled to the German embassy, which had not yet evacuated.

==Timeline==
March 13
* On the eve of the operation, the German [[Federal Minister of Defence (Germany)|Minister of Defence]], [[Volker Rühe]], decided to reduce the reaction time of German Forces in case of emergency in Albania and ordered the [[frigate]] [[German frigate Niedersachsen (F208)|''Niedersachsen'']] to enter Albanian waters.
March 14
*Five [[CH-53 Sea Stallion|CH-53G heavy transport helicopters]] with 89 soldiers from the German [[SFOR]] contingent headed from Bosnia to [[Dubrovnik]], [[Croatia]]. At the same time in Germany, three [[C-160]] transport planes had been held in readiness to fly to the [[Balkans]]. The ''Niedersachsen'' waited in readiness in the port of [[Durrës]], Albania.
* 11.30 am - The German Government under [[Chancellor]] [[Helmut Kohl]] decided to deploy German Forces to evacuate the embassy. Because the German military cannot operate abroad without a permission of the [[Bundestag|German Parliament]], the Government employed emergency rules and only informed the leaders of the parliament and the Defence Committee about the planned operation. The C-160s flew to [[Podgorica]], [[Montenegro]]. The task force, consisting of CH-53s and soldiers from combat, supporting, and medical units, lifted off to Tirana.
* 3.39 pm - Although American Forces had cancelled a separate evacuation operation in Tirana after a [[UH-60 Black Hawk|Blackhawk]] helicopter was hit by small arms fire, Colonel Glawatz decided to continue the approach. The first CH-53 landed on an abandoned airfield near the outskirts of Tirana. Perimeter security was established and the civilians started to board the helicopters. Insurgents in [[Armoured personnel carrier|armoured vehicles]] approached the area and attacked the escaping civilians. As the German units returned fire, additional gunmen opened fire from the edge of the air strip. At least 188 rounds were fired at the evacuation force, and one CH-53 helicopter was hit and lightly damaged.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rp-online.de/public/article/aktuelles/politik/deutschland/hintergrund/417415 &lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;Operation "Libelle" Tirana '97: Das erste Gefecht der Bundeswehr&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;] RP Online, 14 March 2007 {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; At least one Albanian was wounded.&lt;ref&gt;Laurin, Carin (2005).

* 4.09 pm - the last helicopter left Tirana.
* The helicopters returned to [[Montenegro]] with the refugees after the successful end of the operation; they were then transported to Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/9703/14/albania.evac/ |title=Evacuations from Albania proceed amid a hail of bullets  |date=14 March 1997|website=[[CNN]] |access-date=2017-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7592">The Prague Quadrennial of Performance Design and Space was established in 1967 to bring the best of design for performance, scenography, and theatre architecture to the front line of cultural activities to be experienced by professional and emerging artists as well as the general public. The quadrennial exhibitions, festivals, and educational programs act as a global catalyst of creative progress by encouraging experimentation, networking, innovation, and future collaborations. PQ aims to honor, empower and celebrate the work of designers, artists and architects while inspiring and educating audiences, who are the most essential element of any live performance.
The Prague Quadrennial strives to present performance design as an art form concerned with creation of active performance environments, that are far beyond merely decorative or beautiful, but emotionally charged, where design can become a quest, a question, an argument, a threat, a resolution, an agent of change, or a provocation. Performance design is a collaborative field where designers mix, fuse and blur the lines between multiple artistic disciplines to search for new approaches and new visions.

The Prague Quadrennial organizes an expansive program of international projects and activities between the main quadrennial events – performances, exhibitions, symposia, workshops, residencies, and educational initiatives serve as an international platform for exploring the practice, theory and education of contemporary performance design in the most encompassing terms.

== History ==

During the [[São Paulo Art Biennial]] in 1959, a special exhibit, designed by František Tröster, illustrated the development of Czech and Slovak stage design and theatre architecture during the period from 1914-1959. The result of the exhibition was a gold medal for Czechoslovakia. Continued Czech success during the next three Biennales led to an offer for Prague to host an international exhibition of stage design in Europe. Since its premiere in 1967, the international exhibition has been held regularly every four years, and has come to be known as the Prague Quadrennial.

Important artists who marked the history of the theater and the scenography participated and exposed at the Prague Quadrennial, such as [[Salvador Dalí]], [[Josef Svoboda]], [[Oscar Niemeyer]], [[Tadeusz Kantor]], [[Guy-Claude François]] and [[Ralph Koltai]], as well as figures of the contemporary theater, such as [[Robert Wilson (director)|Robert Wilson]], [[Heiner Goebbels]] and [[Renzo Piano]].

== Awards ==

The exhibitions are judged and estimated by an International Jury, attributing the following awards:
*Golden Triga for the Best Exposition 
*Gold Medal for the Best Stage Design
*Gold Medal for the Best Theatre Costume
*Gold Medal for the Best Realization of a Production
*Gold Medal for the Best Work in Theatre Architecture and Performance Space

== The 14th edition of the Prague Quadrennial - 6 - 16 June 2019 ==

After long 12 years PQ 2019 will take place at Prague Exhibition Grounds. The left wing of Industrial Palace, where 4 editions of PQ - 1995, 1999, 2003 and 2007 - had been traditionally held, burnt down in 2008 and the next editions removed to other Prague locations. This edition of Prague Quadrennial is inspired by the Golden Triga, the statue and the main award traditionally given as the highest prize to the best exhibition. The three different forces coming together to pull the chariot driven by Nike, the goddess of victory, stand proudly on the roof of the National Theatre to remind us that everything we do in creating a performance is an act of collaboration where all talents combine their strengths to achieve much more than any individual could ever accomplish alone. The three horses pulling the chariot symbolize three stages of human life, youth's wild instinct and intuition, the experience of adulthood and the age of wisdom. We will use the metaphor of the Triga to explore three points of view, three areas connected with cyclical phases of creative process:
Imagination,Transformation and Memory.

'''Imagination'''
The first area of interest will be dedicated to the beginnings of the creative process; searches for an artistic identity, strengths of formative energy and imagination. This is the phase where the work is raw, visceral, and untamed. Together we will explore the fragile moments of nding balance between the isolated individuality and ability to share even the most extreme ideas with others. We would like to focus on projects where the leading force is intuition and instinct unlimited and unaffected by routine. We will be interested in new concepts, experiments, discoveries, utopias and records of the invisible and fantastic interior world of human imagination.

'''Transformation'''
Transformation is concerned with the core of the creative process, where artists develop strength, con dence, and the ability to discover anew within the limitations of the professional task. It is about the exciting process of surpassing the individual personality and the realization of the power of shared awareness and the collective vision of a group. In this section we will strive to inspire by looking for the best samples of outstanding collaborative performance design and architecture, where experience and deep understanding played a major role in its successful realization. The focus will be on in-depth explorations of the possibilities within the limitations of each task, where the limits determine new styles, engender new forms, and give impulse to new creation.

'''Memory'''
In this section we will celebrate the phase in life and the creative process where all learning, gained experiences and memories merge and crystallize into a strong life philosophy and individual art form. Each era and each generation is affected by a different set of circumstances, socio-economic and political environments and moments of important changes that propel new ideas. Those moments are written into the memories of generations and become connective markers on the map of shared emotions. The best works of performance design, which only are complete during the performance, are saturated with the emotions of the era and often play an important role in the awakening of public consciousness. 
After the performance is over there are only fragments of design work left such as models, drawings, costumes and objects. Those fragments become capsules filled with the essence of their time, are part of important memories and help us understand the complex currents of here and now.

{{Violence against women}}

During the [[Armenian Genocide]] which occurred in the [[Ottoman Empire]], led at the time by the [[Young Turks]], the Turkish armed forces, militias, and members of the public engaged in a systematic campaign of [[genocidal rape]] against [[Women in Armenia|female]] Armenians and children of both sexes. Before the genocide had begun one method used to intimidate the Armenian population was sexual humiliation.{{efn|"Violence against women was a central feature of the Armenian Genocide. Even before the mass killings, sexual humiliation was used to intimidate the Armenian community. After the murder of the Armenian leadership and men of military age, Ottoman authorities and Ittihadist supporters deported surviving Armenians from Anatolia into the Syrian desert. During this ethnic cleansing, rape, kidnapping, sex slavery, and forced re-marriage became de facto instruments of genocide. Eyewitness accounts and diplomatic reports shed light on the place of gender during genocidal persecution."{{sfn|Derderian|2005|pp=1–25}} }} Women and young girls were not only subjected to rape, but also [[forced marriage]], torture, [[forced prostitution]], being sold into slavery and sexual mutilation.{{sfn|Herzog|2011|p=47}}{{sfn|Miller|Miller|1999|p=24}}

[[Heinrich Bergfeld]], the German Consul to [[Trabzon during the Armenian Genocide|Trabzon]] reported "the numerous rapes of women and girls," which crime he regarded as being part of a plan for "the virtually complete extermination of the Armenians." The systematic use of rape during the genocide was testified to by Turkish, American, Austrian, and German witnesses and officials.{{sfn|Dadrian|2008|p=83}}

== Background ==

In the years between 1850 and 1870 the [[List of Catholicoi of Armenia|Patriarch of Armenia]] submitted 537 letters to the [[Sublime Porte]] asking for help to protect the Armenians from the violent abuse and social and political injustice they were subjected to. He requested the people be protected from "brigandage, murder, abduction and rape of women and children, confiscatory taxes, and fraud and extortion by local officials."{{sfn|Balakian|2004|p=37}}

Within the [[Ottoman law|legal]] system the Armenian communities had their own prisons and court systems, and were able to hold civil cases for issues between Christians and Muslims. Within the Islamic judicial system the Armenians had no recourse, a Muslim was allowed to request a hearing before a religious court, in which testimony from non-Muslims would be disallowed or given little value. All a Muslim needed to do to get a case settled was swear on the Koran. Because of this the Armenians, as well as other [[dhimmi]], had little hope within the judicial system.  According to [[Peter Balakian]], "a well-armed Kurd or Turk could not only steal his [Armenian] host's possessions but could rape or kidnap the women and girls of the household with impunity."{{sfn|Balakian|2004|p=42}} "The amount of theft and extortion, as well as rape and abduction of Armenian women, that was allowed under this Ottoman legal system placed the Armenians in perpetual jeopardy."{{sfn|Balakian|2004|p=41}}

In 1895, [[Frederick Davis Greene]], published ''The Armenian Crisis in Turkey: The Massacre of 1894, Its Antecedents and Significance''. The book made note of the fact that men were murdered out of hand, while the women and children suffered appalling sexual attacks.{{sfn|Balakian|2004|p=64}}  In one incident he described, 

&lt;blockquote&gt;A lot of women, variously estimated from 60 to 160 in number, were shut up in a church, and the soldiers were "let loose" among them. Many were outraged{{efn|The word "outrage" was, in this context, a Victorian euphemism for rape.{{sfn|Balakian|2004|p=64}} }} to death, and the remainder dispatched with sword and bayonet. Children were placed in a row, one behind another, and a bullet fired down the line, apparently to see how many could be dispatched with one bullet. Infants and small children were piled one on the other and their heads struck off.{{sfn|Balakian|2004|p=64}}{{sfn|Jacobs|2003|pp=129–130}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The genocide of 1915 was planned well in advance. A document obtained by Commander C. H. Heathcote Smith of the British Naval Volunteer Service, which was dubbed "The Ten Commandments" gave a detailed account of how the genocide was to be carried out.{{efn|
(1). Profiting by Arts: 3 and 4 of Comité Union and Progres, close all Armenian Societies, and arrest all who worked against Government at any time among them and send them into the provinces such as Bagdad or Mosul, and wipe them out either on the road or there. 
(2). Collect arms. 
(3). Excite Moslem opinion by suitable and special means, in places as 
Van, Erzeroum, Adana, where as a point of fact the Armenians have 
already won the hatred of the Moslems, provoke organised massacres as 
the Russians did at Baku. 
(4). Leave all executive to the people in the provinces such as Erzeroum, 
Van, Mumuret ul Aziz, and Bitlis, and use Military disciplinary forces (i.e. 
Gendarmerie) ostensibly to stop massacres, while on the contrary in 
places as Adana, Sivas, Broussa, Ismidt and Smyrna actively help the 
Moslems with military force. 
(5). Apply measures to exterminate all males under 50, priests and 
teachers, leave girls and children to be Islamized. 
(6). Carry away the families of all who succeed in escaping and apply measures to cut them off from all connection with their native place. 
(7). On the ground that Armenian officials may be spies, expel and drive 
them out absolutely from every Government department or post. 
(8). Kill off in an appropriate manner all Armenians in the Army - this to be 
left to the military to do. 
(9) All action to begin everywhere simultaneously, and thus leave no time 
for preparation of defensive measures. 
(10). Pay attention to the strictly confidential nature of these instructions, 
which may not go beyond two or three persons.{{sfn|Dadrian|1993|pp=174–175}} }}

The genocide began following the outbreak of World War I. Armenians serving in the Turkish armed forces were removed and killed. The Armenian civilian population were sent on forced marches and denied food and water. In a strategy similar to the [[Herero and Namaqua Genocide|tactics]] used by the [[German Empire]] in [[German South-West Africa]], the Armenians were forced into the desert. On the line of march the women, young girls and boys were systematically raped, mutilated and tortured. Hundreds of thousands died on these forced marches.{{sfn|Ball|2011|p=18}}

== Rape as genocide ==

[[File:Armenians marched by Ottoman soldiers, 1915.png|thumb|Armenians on a forced march. Women were regularly attacked on these.]]

One objective of genocidal rape is forced pregnancy; however, those unable to bear children are also subject to sexual assault. Victims ages can range from children to women in their eighties. During the Armenian Genocide the rape of young girls was well documented; they would be assaulted in their homes before forced relocation, or on the forced marches into the Syrian desert. An eyewitness testified, "It was a very common thing for them to rape our girls in our presence. Very often they violated eight or ten year old girls, and as a consequence many would be unable to walk, and were shot." Another testified that every girl in her village aged over twelve, and some who were younger, had been raped.{{sfn|Smith|2013|p=94}}

Women were gang raped and often committed suicide afterwards. Once the men had been separated from the women, the women were systematically raped and then killed, along with any children.{{sfn|Joyce Frey|2009|p=80}}{{sfn|Monroe|2011|p=14}} According to eyewitness accounts, the practice of rape was "more or less universal".{{sfn|Theriault|2007|p=30}} Armenians "were often killed in festivals of cruelty which involved rape and other forms of torture."{{sfn|Theriault|2007|p=29}} The women were raped on a daily basis and were forced to work as prostitutes. Many were killed by bayoneting, or died from exposure or from prolonged sexual abuse.{{sfn|Khosroeva|2007|p=280}}

In 2008, A. Dirk Moses described genocide as a "total social practice."{{sfn|Moses|2008|p=13}} Within this context, rape can be viewed as an integral part of genocide. Genocides usually involve attacking the familial roles of the victims, which are the ways they contribute to the reproduction of the targeted group as perceived by the perpetrators. Commonalities across all genocides are the murder of infants in front of parents, forced rape of women by family members, and the violation and mutilation of the reproductive systems.{{sfn|Von Joeden-Forgey|2010|p=72}} The Armenian genocide is a prime example of these behaviors. The attackers follow a pattern of family based destruction. In attacks on villages men were killed, and the surviving population were raped, forcibly dislocated or killed. Another purpose of the rapes was [[eliticide]], the destruction of a group's leadership, which was then used to create confusion. This gave a public demonstration of the mastery the attackers had over the Armenian populace, and caused `total suffering` on both sexes, as they bore witness to sexual assault and the torture of those they loved.{{sfn|Von Joeden-Forgey|2010|pp=72–73}}

=== Instances and accounts ===
According to Taner Akçam, forced prostitution, rape and sexual abuse were widespread, and military commanders told their men to "Do to them whatever you wish". Members of the German armed forces in [[Der Zor]] helped to open a brothel. Throughout the genocide the men were given free licence to do as they pleased with Armenian women.{{sfn|Akçam|2012|p=312}} Armenian women and children were displayed naked in auctions in [[Damascus]], where they were sold as sex slaves. The trafficking of Armenian women as sex slaves was an important source of income for accompanying soldiers, while in Arab areas, they were sold at low prices. The German consul at [[Mosul]] reported that the maximum price for Armenian women was "5 piastres".{{sfn|Akçam|2012|p=314-5}}

[[Karen Jeppe]], who was working for the [[League of Nations]] in Aleppo and was attempting to have released the tens of thousands of women and children who had been abducted, said in 1926 that out of the thousands of women she had spoken to, only one had not been sexually abused.{{sfn|Bjørnlund|2011|p=24}}

Rössler, the German consul in Aleppo during the genocide, heard from an "objective" Armenian that around a quarter of young women, whose appearance was "more or less pleasing", were regularly raped by the gendarmes, and that "even more beautiful ones" were violated by 10-15 men. This resulted in girls and women being left behind dying, naked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gust|first1=Wolfgang|title=The Armenian Genocide: Evidence from the German Foreign Office Archives, 1915-1916|date=2013|publisher=Berghahn Books|isbn=9781782381433|pages=26–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== War crimes trials ==

{{main|Effort to prosecute Ottoman war criminals}}

Following the end of World War I, the British exerted pressure on the Sultan to bring to trial the leadership of the [[Committee of Union and Progress]] (CUP) for crimes against humanity. By April 1919 over 100 Turkish officials had been arrested.

Testimony given by Nuri, the police chief of [[Trabzon]], claimed that he had given young girls, as a gift from the governor-general to the CUP central committee. A merchant by name of Mehmed Ali testified that not only were children being killed at the Red Crescent Hospital, but that young girls were also being raped and that the governor-general held there fifteen girls for his sexual gratification. Hasan Maruf, a military officer, testified to the British that "Government officials at Trebizond picked out some of the prettiest Armenian women of the best families. After committing the worst outrages on them, they had them killed."{{sfn|Dadrian|2008|pp=83–84}}

The court found the Lieutenant governor Kemal Bey, of the district of [[Yozgat]], guilty of murder and forced relocation; he was given the death penalty. Major Tevfik Bey, a commander of police was also found guilty and was given a 16-year prison sentence."{{sfn|DeLaet|2005|pp=162–163}}

The '''reliability theory of aging''' is an attempt to apply the principles of [[reliability theory]] to create a [[mathematical model]] of [[senescence]]. The theory was published in Russian by [[Leonid A. Gavrilov]] and Natalia S. Gavrilova as ''Biologiia prodolzhitelʹnosti zhizni'' in 1986, and in English translation as ''The Biology of Life Span: A Quantitative Approach'' in 1991.{{r|gav|rayl}}

One of the models suggested in the book is based on an analogy with the reliability theory. The underlying [[hypothesis]] is based on the (previously suggested) premise that humans are born in a highly defective state. This is then made worse by environmental and mutational damage; exceptionally high [[Redundancy (engineering)|redundancy]] due to the extremely high number of low-reliable components (e.., [[cell (biology)|cell]]s) allows the organism to survive for a while.{{r|ieee}}&lt;ref name=gg2001/&gt;

The theory suggests an explanation of two aging phenomena for higher organisms: the [[Gompertz law]] of exponential increase in mortality rates with age and the "late-life mortality plateau" (mortality deceleration compared to the Gompertz law at higher ages).&lt;ref name=gg2001&gt;Gavrilov, Gavrilova (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

The book criticizes a number of hypotheses known at the time, discusses drawbacks of the hypotheses put forth by the authors themselves, and concludes that regardless the suggested mathematical models, the underlying biological mechanisms remain unknown.&lt;ref&gt;"Conclusion" section of the book&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Richard James Cushing''' (August 24, 1895 – November 2, 1970) was an [[United States|American]] [[prelate]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. He served as [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Boston|Archbishop of Boston]] from 1944 to 1970 and was made a [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]] in 1958.  Cushing's main role was as fundraiser and builder of new churches, schools, and institutions.  He was on good terms with practically the entire Boston elite, as he softened the traditional confrontation between the Catholic Irish and the Protestant upper-class.  Cushing built useful relationships with Jews, Protestants, and institutions outside the usual Catholic community.  He helped presidential candidate John F. Kennedy deflect fears of papal interference in American government if a Catholic became  president.  Cushing's high energy level allowed him to meet with many people all day, often giving lengthy speeches at night.  Cushing was not efficient at business affairs, and when expenses built up he counted on his fund-raising skills instead of cost-cutting.  Cushing, says Nasaw, was "fun-loving, informal, and outgoing.  He looked rather like a tough, handsome, Irish cop and behaved more like a ward politician than a high church cleric."&lt;ref&gt;David Nasaw, The Patriarch: The Remarkable Life and Turbulent Times of Joseph P.  Kennedy'' (2012) pp 625-27&lt;/ref&gt;  His major weakness in retrospect was overexpansion, adding new institutions that could not be sustained in the long run and had to be cut back by his successors.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Muccigrosso, ed., ''Research Guide to American Historical Biography'' (1988) 5:2466-9&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Cushing was born in [[South Boston]] on August 24, 1895.&lt;ref name=miranda&gt;{{cite news|work=The Cardinals of the Holy Roman Church|title=CUSHING, Richard James (1895-1970)|url=http://www2.fiu.edu/~mirandas/bios-c.htm#Cushing|last=Miranda|first=Salvador}}&lt;/ref&gt; The third of five children, he was the son of Patrick and Mary (née Dahill) Cushing.&lt;ref name=nytimes&gt;{{cite news|date=November 3, 1970|work=[[The New York Times]]|title=Cardinal Cushing Dies in Boston at 75}}&lt;/ref&gt; His parents were both [[Ireland|Irish]] immigrants; his father was originally from [[Glanworth]], [[County Cork]], and his mother from [[Touraneena]], [[County Waterford]].&lt;ref name=oblatvs&gt;{{cite news|work=OBLATVS|title=The Catholic Church in Massachusetts (XXI.2)|url=http://oblatvs.blogspot.com/2009/09/catholic-church-in-massachusetts-xxi2.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father, who came to the United States in 1880,&lt;ref name=time&gt;{{cite news|date=August 21, 1964|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time Magazine]]|title=The Unlikely Cardinal|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,876036-5,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; worked as a [[blacksmith]] and earned $18 per week in the trolley repair pits of the [[Boston Elevated Railway]].&lt;ref name=leader&gt;{{cite news|date=September 9, 1970|work=[[The New York Times]]|title=Cushing: Ecumenical Leader, Kennedys' Friend, Communists' Foe}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cushing received his early education at Perry Public Grammar School in the [[City Point, Boston|City Point]] section of South Boston, since there was then no [[parochial school]] for boys in Gate of Heaven Parish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gateofheavenparish.com/history3.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-04-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110324183454/http://www.gateofheavenparish.com/history3.html |archivedate=March 24, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dever&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dever|first1=Joseph|title=Cushing of Boston: A Candid Portrait|year=1965|publisher=Bruce Humphries|location=Boston}} {{dead link|date=February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cushing dropped out of high school in his freshman year because of his compulsive truancy.&lt;ref name=leader/&gt; He subsequently entered [[Boston College High School]], a [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] college preparatory school.&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt; His tuition there was paid by his cousin, who was a priest of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York|Archdiocese of New York]].&lt;ref name=dever/&gt;  He graduated from high school in 1913, receiving honors for Latin and Greek.&lt;ref name=mcmahon&gt;{{cite news|date=January 16, 2001|work=South Boston 2004|title=Boston Irish Reporter Names BC Alumnus Cardinal Cushing "Boston Irish Person of the Century"|url=http://www.mcgoffonline.com/SB_200/cardinal_cushing.htm|last=McMahon|first=Kelly}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cushing was torn for a time between religion and politics.&lt;ref name=leader/&gt; He originally wanted to be a politician, even earning money by speaking for politicians from the back of wagons.&lt;ref name=time/&gt;  He twice considered joining the Jesuits,&lt;ref name=time/&gt; but came to the conclusion he "was cut out more for the active life and not the teaching apostolate."&lt;ref name=dever/&gt;

He entered [[Boston College]] in 1913, becoming a member of the first freshman class following the college's move to [[Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts|Chestnut Hill]].&lt;ref name=miranda/&gt; At Boston College, he was active in the Marquette Debating Society and elected vice-president of his sophomore class.&lt;ref name=dever/&gt; Following the sinking of the [[RMS Lusitania|RMS ''Lusitania'']] in 1915, Cushing enlisted in the United States Army but was medically discharged for his asthma after a few weeks.&lt;ref name=mcmahon/&gt; After attending Boston College for two years, he began his studies for the [[Priesthood (Catholic Church)|priesthood]] at [[Saint John's Seminary (Massachusetts)|St. John's Seminary]] in [[Brighton, Boston, Massachusetts|Brighton]] in September 1915.&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt; He was assigned to continue his studies at the [[Pontifical North American College]] in Rome, but the escalation of [[U-boat Campaign (World War I)|U-boat activity]] prevented him from sailing across the Atlantic.&lt;ref name=dever/&gt;

==Priesthood==
On May 26, 1921, Cushing was [[Holy Orders|ordained]] a priest by Cardinal [[William Henry O'Connell]] at the [[Cathedral of the Holy Cross (Boston)|Cathedral of the Holy Cross]].&lt;ref name=hierarchy&gt;{{cite news|work=Catholic-Hierarchy.org|title=Richard James Cardinal Cushing|url=http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/bishop/bcushing.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; His first assignment was as a [[curate]] at St. Patrick's Church in [[Roxbury, Boston|Roxbury]], where he remained for two months.&lt;ref name=dever/&gt; He was afterwards transferred to St. Benedict's Church in [[Somerville, Massachusetts|Somerville]].&lt;ref name=dever/&gt;  In 1922, Cushing appeared unannounced at the residence of Cardinal O'Connell to request an assignment as a [[missionary]].&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt; The young priest declared he wanted to "take heaven by storm."&lt;ref name=time/&gt; O'Connell denied his request, and instead appointed him assistant director of the Boston office of the [[Society for the Propagation of the Faith]], an organization dedicated to raising funds for missions.&lt;ref name=miranda/&gt; He later served as director of the Society from 1929 to 1944.&lt;ref name=miranda/&gt; He was raised to the rank of [[Monsignor]] on May 14, 1939.&lt;ref name=miranda/&gt;

==Episcopal career==
On June 10, 1939, after Bishop [[Francis Spellman]] was named [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York|Archbishop of New York]], Cushing was appointed [[auxiliary bishop]] of Boston and [[titular bishop]] of ''Mela'' by [[Pope Pius XII]].&lt;ref name=hierarchy/&gt; He received his [[Bishop (Catholic Church)|episcopal]] [[consecration]] on the following June 29 from Cardinal O'Connell, with Bishops [[John Bertram Peterson]] and [[Thomas Addis Emmet (bishop)|Thomas Addis Emmet]], [[Society of Jesus|SJ]], serving as [[Consecrator|co-consecrators]], at the Cathedral of the Holy Cross.&lt;ref name=hierarchy/&gt; He took as his episcopal [[motto]]: ''Ut Cognoscant Te'' ([[Latin]]: "That they may know thee").

As an auxiliary bishop, Cushing continued to serve as director of the Society for the Propagation of Faith, and was also named [[pastor]] of Sacred Heart Church&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacredheart.ws/index.php|title=WEBSITE.WS - Your Internet Address For Life™|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Newton Centre, Massachusetts|Newton Centre]].&lt;ref name=dever/&gt; Following the death of Cardinal O'Connell in April 1944, he served as [[apostolic administrator]] of the archdiocese.&lt;ref name=miranda/&gt;

===Archbishop of Boston===
Cushing was named the third [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Boston|Archbishop of Boston]] on September 25, 1944, following Cardinal O'Connell's death. During his tenure, Boston would see the [[excommunication]] of Fr. [[Leonard Feeney]] for his stringent interpretation of the Catholic doctrine that [[Extra Ecclesiam nulla salus|there is no salvation outside the Church]]. Feeney refused to back down from his position, although it has been reported that he was ultimately reconciled with the church before his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,908875,00.html|title=Religion: Feeney Forgiven|date=October 14, 1974|publisher=|via=www.time.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the death of Pius XII, Cushing published a moving tribute to him.&lt;ref&gt;Pope Pius XII by Richard Cushing, St. Paul Editions, Boston, 1959&lt;/ref&gt; In 1959, Cushing published a biography of the late [[Pope Pius XII]] (1939–1958), depicting the late pope as "Pope of Peace".

His work contributed to making the [[Roman Catholic Church]] acceptable to the general American population at the time of then-Senator [[John F. Kennedy]]'s run for the [[White House]]. Part of this work included reaching out to the non-Catholics of Boston after "the muscular style of involved Catholicism that Cardinal O'Connell brought to bear on issues of his day religious, social, and political in Boston and Massachusetts".&lt;ref&gt;Boston Globe [http://www.boston.com/globe/spotlight/abuse/stories5/121403_mulvoy.htm "'What Will Lake Street Think?' No Longer"] December 14, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Cushing was created [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal-Priest]] of [[Santa Susanna]] by [[Pope John XXIII]] in the [[Papal consistory|consistory]] of December 15, 1958. He was one of the [[Cardinal electors in Papal conclave, 1963|cardinal electors]] in the [[Papal conclave, 1963|1963 papal conclave]], which elected [[Pope Paul VI]].

The Cardinal was a close friend of the [[Kennedy family]]. He officiated at the [[Catholic marriage|marriage]] of John F. Kennedy and [[Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis|Jacqueline Lee Bouvier]] in 1953, at which he also read a special prayer from [[Pope Pius XII]], and baptized many of the Kennedy children. Cushing gave the prayer invocation at Kennedy's inauguration in 1961. The Cardinal also celebrated [[Funeral of John F. Kennedy|President Kennedy's]] [[Requiem|funeral Mass]] in 1963 at [[Cathedral of St. Matthew the Apostle|St. Matthew's Cathedral]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]

The day before the funeral, he gave a [[Television|televised]] [[eulogy]] for the President. Cushing later defended Jacqueline Kennedy after her marriage to [[Aristotle Onassis]] in 1968. He received a large amount of [[hate mail]] and was contradicted by the [[Holy See|Vatican]].&lt;ref&gt;Time magazine [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,839610,00.html "The Cardinal and Jackie"], November 1, 1968&lt;/ref&gt;

====Biography of Pope Pius XII====
In 1959, Cardinal Cushing published his only book,  a biography of the late [[Pope Pius XII (Cardinal Cushing)|Pope Pius XII]] (1939–1958). It is an almost [[hagiographic]] biography, written shortly after the death of the Pontiff. Cushing depicted him as the "''Pope of Peace''", who, armed only with the spiritual weapons of his office, triumphed over insidious attacks that seemed about to destroy the center of Christendom.

===Second Vatican Council===
At the [[Second Vatican Council]] (1962–1965) Cushing played a vital role in drafting ''[[Nostra aetate]]'', the document that officially absolved the Jews of [[deicide charge]]. His emotional comments during debates over the drafts were echoed in the final version:

{{Quote|We must cast the Declaration on the Jews in a much more positive form, one not so timid, but much more loving ... For the sake of our common heritage we, the children of Abraham according to the spirit, must foster a special reverence and love for the children of Abraham according to the flesh. As children of Adam, they are our kin, as children of Abraham they are Christ's blood relatives. 2. So far as the guilt of Jews in the death of our Saviour is concerned, the rejection of the Messiah by His own, is according to Scripture, a mystery&amp;mdash;a mystery given us for our instruction, not for our self-exaltation ... We cannot sit in judgement on the onetime leaders of Israel&amp;mdash;God alone is their judge. Much less can we burden later generations of Jews with any burden of guilt for the crucifixion of the Lord Jesus, for the death of the Saviour of the world, except that universal guilt in which we all have a part ... In clear and unmistakable language, we must deny, therefore, that the Jews are guilty of our Saviour's death. We must condemn especially those who seek to justify, as Christian deeds, discrimination, hatred and even persecution of Jews ... 3. I ask myself, Venerable Brothers, whether we should not humbly acknowledge before the whole world that, toward their Jewish brethren, Christians have all too often not shown themselves as true Christians, as faithful followers of Christ. How many [Jews] have suffered in our own time? How many died because Christians were indifferent and kept silent? ... If in recent years, not many Christian voices were raised against those injustices, at least let ours now be heard in humility.&lt;ref&gt;Oesterreicher, pp. 197-98&lt;/ref&gt;}}

He was deeply committed to implementing the Council's reforms and promoting [[Aggiornamento|renewal in the Church]].&lt;ref&gt;TIME Magazine. [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,876036-3,00.html The Unlikely Cardinal] August 21, 1964&lt;/ref&gt; In an unprecedented gesture of [[Catholic Church and ecumenism|ecumenism]], he encouraged Catholics to attend [[Billy Graham]]'s crusades.&lt;ref name="Big Man in a Long Red Robe"&gt;Time magazine. [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,904482-2,00.html Big Man in a Long Red Robe] November 16, 1970]&lt;/ref&gt; Cushing strongly condemned [[Communism]], particularly the regime of [[Josip Broz Tito]] in Yugoslavia.&lt;ref&gt;Time magazine [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,887631,00.html How Are Things in Yugoslavia?] September 1, 1947&lt;/ref&gt;

Cushing's resignation as Boston's archbishop was accepted on September 8, 1970. Upon his resignation, Senator [[Ted Kennedy]] stated: "For three-quarters of a century [Cushing's] life has been a light in a world that cries out for illumination. He will never have to account for his stewardship, for if his goodness is not known to God, no one's ever will be."&lt;ref name=change&gt;{{cite news|date=November 21, 1970|work=[[TIME Magazine|''Time'' magazine]]|title=Change of the Guard|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,942283,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Less than two months later, he died from [[cancer]] in Boston at the age of 75 on the feast of [[All Souls Day]], and was buried in [[Hanover, Massachusetts]] at the Portiuncula Chapel on the grounds of the [[Cardinal Cushing Centers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cardinalcushingcenters.org/|title=Cardinal Cushing Centers|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Procession de la Sanch''' ('''Processó de la Sanch''' in [[Catalan language|Catalan]]) is an annual ceremony in several towns in the [[Northern Catalonia|French Catalonia]]. It is held during [[Holy Week]] on [[Good Friday]] ('Vendredi Saint'/'Divendres Sant'). Historically, a distinctive peaked, masked robe (the [[Capirote|capirote]]) was used to protect the identity of prisoners (from revenge by those wronged) being led to their town's annual execution. This practical ceremony intermingled with Christian traditions of Good Friday, and today a long procession of black-robed people are led in silence by the red-robed ''regidor'' to the solemn tapping of a tambourine, as part of the Good Friday celebrations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anglophone-direct.com/La-procession-de-la-Sanch Description of the ceremony]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Serapis Met 1989.281.80.jpg|thumb|upright|Roman Imperial bust of Serapis in silver and gold (mid-2nd century AD, [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]]]
The '''Serapia''' or '''Sarapia''' was a [[Roman Empire|Roman Imperial]] [[Roman festival|religious festival]] devoted to the Greco-Egyptian god [[Serapis]]. It is found as an official holiday on 25 April as late as the [[Calendar of Filocalus]] in 354 AD. In farmers' almanacs ''([[menologia rustica]])'' dating to the first half of the 1st century, the day was a ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#sacra|sacrum]]'' or rite for Serapis along with Isis Pharia,&lt;ref&gt;Michele Renee Salzman, ''On Roman Time: The Codex Calendar of 354 and the Rhythms of Urban Life in Late Antiquity'' (University of California Press, 1990), pp. 124, 170–171.&lt;/ref&gt; "Isis of the [[Lighthouse of Alexandria|Lighthouse ''(Pharos)'' of Alexandria]]".&lt;ref&gt;[[Mary Beard (classicist)|Mary Beard]], J.A. North, and S.R.F. Price, ''Religions of Rome: A Sourcebook'' (Cambridge University Press, 1998), vol. 2, p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

Serapis was incorporated into the [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|Imperial cult of Rome]] because of his importance as a city god of [[Alexandria]]. Under the [[epithet]]s ''Dominus'' ("Master, Lord"), ''Magnus'' ("the Great") and ''[[List of Roman deities#Invictus|Invictus]]'' ("Invincible"), he was [[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#cultus|cultivated]] as a deity of success and victory in conjunction with [[Sol (mythology)|Sol]]/[[Helios]], [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]]/[[Zeus]], and [[Neptunus|Neptune]].&lt;ref&gt;Salzman, ''On Roman Time,'' p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Papyri]] document the celebration of the Egyptian Serapia along the [[Nile]] as late as 315. One records payments to those performing in the ceremonies at [[Oxyrhynchus]] during the late 3rd century,&lt;ref&gt;David Frankfurter, ''Religion in Roman Egypt: Assimilation and Resistance'' (Princeton University Press, 1998), pp. 56–57, with citations of the papyri in note 56.&lt;/ref&gt; including a comedian, two "[[Homeric epics|Homerists]]", dancers, and athletes.&lt;ref&gt;Frankfurter, ''Religion in Roman Egypt,'' p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt; A "dog-headed one" ''(kynopou)'' may be a priest wearing a mask of [[Anubis]]. Processions for Egyptian deities at Rome seem to have included masked participants.&lt;ref&gt;Frankfurter, ''Religion in Roman Egypt,'' p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the Greeks and Romans, Serapis was sometimes identified with the underworld ruler [[Pluto (mythology)|Pluto]], and Anubis with [[Cerberus]].&lt;ref&gt;Eleni Manolaraki, ''Noscendi Nilum Cupido: Imagining Egypt from Lucan to Philostratus'' (Walter de Gruyter, 2013), pp. 200–201.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to his payment from the festival organizers, the ''kynopou'' was to receive welcome gifts ''([[Xenia (Greek)|xenia]])'' from people along the processional route, perhaps to obtain reciprocal hospitality in the afterlife. For Egyptian observers, the presence of Anubis would have affirmed the connection of the [[Hellenistic religion|Hellenistic]] Serapis to the [[ancient Egyptian religion|traditional Egyptian]] god [[Osiris]].&lt;ref&gt;Frankfurter, ''Religion in Roman Egypt'', pp. 58–59.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Sounds of the Underground''' tour was a festival-like tour that rivaled [[Ozzfest]] in its first year of existence. It was held annually for three years (2005, 2006, and 2007).

The tour features [[extreme metal]] and [[metalcore]], and [[Hardcore punk|hardcore]] bands.  The existence of this tour, which was held in national arenas, was to attract the rising interest of metal, hardcore, and metalcore bands in the mainstream. In December 2007, it was announced that the tour would no longer be held as it could not compete with [[Ozzfest]] and [[Mayhem festival]] scheduled to start sometime in the summer of 2008. Sounds of the Underground was initially a radio show in Kitchener, Canada on 88.3 CJIQ that got taken off the air for indecent remarks,but is now back on air on a different channel 93.3 CFRU, hosted by James Hammond.&lt;ref&gt;http://metalnews.typepad.com/themetalreport/2008/01/sounds-of-the-u.html&lt;/ref&gt; Sounds of the Underground was later taken off air from 93.3 CFRU as well for indecent remarks.

The '''St. Louis Light''', '''St. Louis Ghost Light''', or '''St. Louis Ghost Train''' is a supposed [[paranormal phenomenon]] seen near [[St. Louis, Saskatchewan]], [[Canada]].

The phenomenon has been featured on the television series ''[[Unsolved Mysteries]]''&lt;ref name=mysterysolved&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.virtualsk.com/current_issue/mystery.html|title=Mystery Solved?|publisher=Virtual Saskatchewan - Online Magazine|accessdate=2009-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; and entails a strange light moving up and down along an old abandoned rail line at night, changing colours and varying in brightness. The line, located south of [[Prince Albert, Saskatchewan|Prince Albert]] and north of [[St. Louis, Saskatchewan|St. Louis]], has had its tracks removed, but the phenomenon still occurs on a regular basis.

Several stories attempt to explain the lights, including that it is a [[Ghost train (folklore)|ghost train]], or the [[ghost]] of a drunk [[brakeman]] who lost his head to a passing train and now wanders up and down the tracks with a lantern attempting to find it. In 2014 [[Canada Post]] issued a stamp depicting the St. Louis ghost train, one of a series of five depicting Canadian ghost tales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.canadapost.ca/cpo/mc/aboutus/news/pr/2014/2014_haunted_canada.jsf | title=Canada Post revives Canadian-made ghost tales with collection of five spine-tingling stamps | date=13 June 2014 | publisher=[[Canada Post]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two [[twelfth grade]] students from [[La Ronge, Saskatchewan|La Ronge]], Northern Saskatchewan won science fair gold medals for investigating and eventually duplicating the phenomenon, which they determined to be caused by the [[diffraction]] of distant vehicle lights.&lt;ref name=mysterysolved /&gt; However, the light has been reported before the advent of cars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.producer.com/2014/10/ghost-train-story-haunts-small-saskatchewan-community/|title=Ghost train story haunts small Saskatchewan community|last=Riemer|first=Taryn|date=October 31, 2014|publisher=[[The Western Producer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Sushi memo''' is a 3-page legal [[memorandum]] on the topic of [[sushi]] allegedly written by a [[paralegal]] for the midtown [[Manhattan]] [[law firm]] of [[Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton &amp; Garrison LLP]], on July 9, 2003.  The memo is complete with exhibits and footnotes, and discusses suitable choices for takeout sushi [[restaurant]]s in the area.  The memo became an [[urban legend]] after an article about it was published in [[The New York Times]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/22/nyregion/legal-research-get-me-sushi-with-footnotes.html |title=Legal Research? Get Me Sushi, With Footnotes |last=Glater |first=Jonathan |date=October 22, 2003 |website= |publisher=The New York Times |access-date=May 10, 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This memo can be seen as an example of harsh conditions paralegals face in large law firms, where they are often asked to perform demanding, demeaning and often useless tasks assigned by their employers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7256">'''The Chickens and the Bulls''' (called 'Operation Homex' by the FBI) refers to an [[extortion]] ring that preyed on prominent, closeted, gay men in the 1960s. Corrupt police officers and police impersonators known as 'Bulls' , used young often underage men called '[[chickens]]' to blackmail wealthy or important closeted men across the country. Over nearly a decade the ring victimized thousands, including " a navy admiral, two generals, a U.S. congressman, a prominent surgeon, an Ivy League professor, a prep school headmaster, and several well-known actors, singers, and television personalities"&lt;ref name=slatemcgowan&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/life/history/2012/07/the_chickens_and_the_bulls_the_rise_and_incredible_fall_of_a_vicious_extortion_ring_that_preyed_on_prominent_gay_men_in_the_1960s_.single.html|title=The Chickens and the Bulls|author=William McGowan|date=July 11, 2012|publisher=Slate|accessdate=2015-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; This went on until 1966 when Manhattan DA [[Frank Hogan]] announced that the ring had been broken up, after "at least 2 million dollars had been taken."

== Methods of Operation ==

The ring consisted of small groups of chickens and bulls. The chickens were young male prostitutes who waited outside bars to be approached, or in some cases identified potential marks and seduced them. After making contact, they would accompany the mark to a hotel room and get him into a compromising position while waiting for their partners to arrive.

The bulls would then burst into the room wearing full police gear, sometimes even with authentic badges, and explain the penalties for violating [[sodomy laws]] or corrupting a minor. The extortionists would then demand payment, either as a bribe or as "bail" to avoid making the arrest public.

Alternatively, the chickens could merely rob their marks, keeping any money and passing the mark's personal information on to the extortionists who would then determine whether or not that person was worth further attention. Those who were would then be approached by a police impersonator, using the mark's ID as proof that he had been involved in homosexual activities, and told that they would have to pay to keep their homosexuality secret.

Sometimes, rather than threatening marks, the extortionists would tell them that they had to testify in court about a prostitution ring, but that if they paid "bail money," someone else could be released to testify instead. When dealing with high profile targets, this method was often more effective than attempting to bully them.

== Police Investigation ==

The official investigation of the extortion ring began with a few scattered reports of [[police impersonation]] and a handful of anonymous letters regarding homosexual extortion. As the NYPD division devoted to organized crime activity was connecting these incidents, one specific arrest revealed the true scope of the ring. Detailed in William McGowan's article on the subject:

"July 1965, Detective 3rd Grade James McDonnell received a call in the upstairs squad room of midtown Manhattan's 17th Precinct. There was a man at the Western Union office in Grand Central Station who might be impersonating a 	police detective, he was told. The man was in the company of a 14-year-old runaway and had contacted the boy's father in Texas to wire plane fare so the son could fly home.The father had grown suspicious when the man had asked for 	$150—twice the needed amount."&lt;ref name=slatemcgowan/&gt;

The man McDonnell met in that Western Union office appeared to be a NYPD member, but a quick conversation with him revealed that the man, John Aitken, had an arrest record and had been trying to use the boy in a robbery scheme. Aitken's subsequent interrogation revealed that "he had knowledge of an extortion ring that had shaken down dozens of prominent closeted homosexual men across the country—most of them married and with families."&lt;ref name=slatemcgowan/&gt;

The amount of effort that the police put into this investigation was rare for any crimes involving homosexuals as the police force as a whole was rather homophobic in the 1960s. Homosexuality was still illegal in most states, but in this case the police set aside their own prejudices, most likely because of the involvement of police impersonators.

== Ringleaders ==

There were three main ringleaders financing and overseeing operations across the country:
John Pyne, a Chicago police department member who learned about blackmail from those he arrested. Sherman Chadwick Kaminsky and Elwood Lee Hammock were the final ringleaders and were the primary extortionists, responsible for the legwork and day-to-day operations.

In his 50's at the time of the extortion ring, John J. Pyne worked for the Chicago Police Department as a member of their Confidential Squad, responsible for dealing with cases of blackmail and other racketeering.1 In the mid 1960s, Pyne was on sick leave on and off over a period of 2–3 years. During this time he was responsible for furnishing the extortionists with fake police badges, warrants, travel money, and attorneys among other things. Additionally he was responsible for finding potential high profile targets. In short, He was the primary overseer of the operation and masterminded the extortion ring.&lt;ref&gt;Inserra, Vincent L.

Sherman Chadwick Kaminsky and Elwood Lee Hammock were Pyne's chief extortionists. Once caught,  they revealed the full scope of the operation and helped the FBI take down Pyne. In an interview, Paul Brana, an FBI agent who worked on the case, spoke about the arrests. "Once that Kaminsky was arrested by me the second time, he became extensively cooperative. He was telling me about all of the extortions that he had committed in the United States."&lt;ref&gt;Robinette, Sandra, ed. "Interview of Former Special Agent of the FBI Paul J. Brana." (n.d.): n. pag. National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund. 30 Mar. 2005. Web. 13 Mar. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; This led to Pyne receiving multiple prison sentences totaling ten years.

== Victims ==

There were thousands of victims, but a large number of these were merely targets of opportunity. Additionally, very few victims came forward on their own, and only a small number of these people were willing to sign formal complaints. Names of victims came primarily from extortionists arrested by police, and many of these victims denied it due to the fear that the extortionists would make good on their threats, either to out the victims, or to go after their families. In many cases, the victims believed that they had been targeted by actual police officers, further discouraging them from coming forward.

Among those confirmed, high-profile, victims were New Jersey congressman [[Peter Frelinghuysen Jr.]], and Admiral [[William Church (admiral)|William Church]], among several other government officials, a prominent surgeon, and a famous British producer.

The present-day location is known as [[Hisarlik]]. It was the setting of the [[Trojan War]] described in the Greek [[Epic Cycle]], in particular in the ''[[Iliad]]'', one of the two epic poems attributed to [[Homer]]. [[metre (poetry)|Metrical]] evidence from the ''Iliad'' and the ''[[Odyssey]]'' suggests that the name {{lang|grc|Ἴλιον}} (''Ilion'') formerly began with a [[digamma]]: {{lang|grc|Ϝίλιον}} (''Wilion''); this is also supported by the [[Hittite language|Hittite]] name for what is thought to be the same city, [[Wilusa]].

A new capital called '''Ilium''' (from Greek: Ἴλιον, ''Ilion'') was founded on the site in the reign of the [[Roman Emperor]] [[Augustus]]. It flourished until the establishment of [[Constantinople]], became a bishopric and declined gradually in the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine era]], but is now a Latin Catholic [[titular see]].

In 1865, English archaeologist [[Frank Calvert]] excavated trial trenches in a field he had bought from a local farmer at Hisarlik, and in 1868, [[Heinrich Schliemann]], a wealthy German businessman and archaeologist, also began excavating in the area after a chance meeting with Calvert in [[Çanakkale]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wood|1985|pp=54–55}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Aşkin |first=Mustafa |title=Troy |year=1981 |publisher=Keskin |location=Istanbul |edition=2005 rev |page=34 |isbn=975-7559-37-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; These excavations revealed several cities built in succession. Schliemann was at first skeptical about the identification of Hisarlik with Troy, but was persuaded by Calvert&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bryce |first=Trevor |title=The Trojans and their neighbours |year=2005 |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |isbn=978-0-415-34959-8 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XZelJgdu9mkC&amp;pg=PA37&amp;dq=Schliemann+credit+Calvert&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=M9I8Trv8HMORswamzrED&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=Schliemann%20credit%20Calvert&amp;f=false |page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; and took over Calvert's excavations on the eastern half of the Hisarlik site, which was on Calvert's property. [[Troy VII]] has been identified with the city called Wilusa by the Hittites (the probable origin of the Greek Ἴλιον) and is generally (but not conclusively) identified with Homeric Troy.

Today, the hill at Hisarlik has given its name to a small village near the ruins, which supports the tourist trade visiting the Troia archaeological site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Aşkin |first=Mustafa |title=Troy: With Legends, Facts, and New Developments |year=2005 |publisher=Keskin Color |location=Istanbul |isbn=975-7559-37-7 |page=72 |quote=Hisarlik, a village near the ruins of Troy.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It lies within the [[Çanakkale Province|province of Çanakkale]], some 30&amp;nbsp;km south-west of the provincial capital, also called Çanakkale. The nearest village is Tevfikiye. The map here shows the adapted Scamander estuary with Ilium a little way inland across the Homeric plain. Due to Troy's location near the Aegean Sea, the Sea of Marmara, and the Black Sea, it was a central hub for the military and trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kraft |first=John C |date=15 August 1980 |title=Geomorphic Reconstructions in the Environs of Ancient Troy |jstor=1684627 |format=PDF |journal=Science |volume=209 |pages=776–782 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Troy was added to the [[World Heritage Site|UNESCO World Heritage]] list in 1998.

[[File:Walls of Troy (1).jpg|thumb|Portion of the walls of Troy (VII)]]
[[File:Troas.png|thumb|Map of the Troad, including the site of Troy]]
Ancient Greek historians variously placed the Trojan War in the 12th, 13th, or 14th centuries BC: [[Eratosthenes]] to 1184&amp;nbsp;BC, [[Herodotus]] to 1250&amp;nbsp;BC, and [[Duris of Samos]] to 1334&amp;nbsp;BC. Modern archaeologists associate Homeric Troy with archaeological [[Troy VII]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wood|1985|p=16}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''Iliad'', the [[Achaeans (Homer)|Achaeans]] set up their camp near the mouth of the River [[Scamander]] (presumably modern [[Karamenderes]]),&lt;ref name="ShopesHamilton2008"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cenker|first1=Işil Cerem|last2=Thys-Şenocak|first2=Lucienne|editor=Shopes, Linda |editor2=Hamilton, Paula|title=Oral History and Public Memories|year=2008|publisher=Temple University Press|location=Philadelphia, PA|isbn=1-59213-141-7|page=76}}&lt;/ref&gt; where they had beached their ships. The city of Troy itself stood on a hill, across the plain of Scamander, where the battles of the Trojan War took place. The site of the ancient city is some 5&amp;nbsp;km from the coast today, but 3,000 years ago the mouths of Scamander were much closer to the city,&lt;ref&gt;[[Strabo]], ''[[Geographia|Geography]]'' XIII, I, 36, tr. H. L. Jones, Loeb Classical Library; [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]], ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'', V.33, tr. H. Rackham, W. S. Jones and D. E. Eichholz, Loeb Classical Library.&lt;/ref&gt; discharging into a large bay that formed a natural harbor, which has since been filled with [[alluvial]] material. Recent geological findings have permitted the identification of the ancient Trojan coastline, and the results largely confirm the accuracy of the Homeric geography of Troy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/2736059.stm |title=Geologists investigate Trojan battlefield |date=7 February 2003 |publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2001, the geologist John C. Kraft from the [[University of Delaware]] and the classicist [[John V. Luce]] from [[Trinity College, Dublin]], presented the results of investigations, begun in 1977, into the geology of the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://gsa.confex.com/gsa/2001AM/finalprogram/abstract_25431.htm |title=Bronze Age Paleogeographies at Ancient Troy |last=Kraft |first=John C. |year=2001 |publisher=[[Geological Society of America]] |access-date=6 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; They compared the present geology with the landscapes and coastal features described in the ''Iliad'' and other classical sources, notably [[Strabo]]'s ''[[Geographica|Geographia]]'', and concluded that there is a regular consistency between the location of Schliemann's Troy and other locations such as the Greek camp, the geological evidence, descriptions of the [[topography]] and accounts of the battle in the ''Iliad''.&lt;ref name="ball"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nature.com/news/2003/030129/full/news030127-4.html |title=Geologists show Homer got it right |last=Ball |first=Philip |date=29 January 2003 |work=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |access-date=6 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://geology.geoscienceworld.org/cgi/content/abstract/31/2/163 Harbor areas at ancient Troy: Sedimentology and geomorphology complement Homer's Iliad], Geoscience World (abstract)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.udel.edu/PR/UDaily/2003/troy030303.html |title=Press Release: Geology corresponds with Homer’s description of ancient Troy|publisher=University of Delaware}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides the ''Iliad'', there are references to Troy in the other major work attributed to Homer, the ''[[Odyssey]]'', as well as in other ancient Greek literature (such as [[Aeschylus]]'s [[The Oresteia|Oresteia]]). The Homeric legend of Troy was elaborated by the Roman poet [[Virgil]] in his ''[[Aeneid]]''. The Greeks and Romans took for a fact the [[Historicity of the Iliad|historicity of the Trojan War]] and the identity of Homeric Troy with the site in Anatolia. [[Alexander the Great]], for example, visited the site in 334&amp;nbsp;BC and there made sacrifices at tombs associated with the Homeric heroes [[Achilles]] and [[Patroclus]].

After the 1995 find of a [[Luwian]] biconvex seal at Troy VII, there has been a heated discussion over the [[Trojan language|language that was spoken in Homeric Troy]]. Frank Starke of the [[University of Tübingen]] recently demonstrated that the name of [[Priam]], king of Troy at the time of the [[Trojan War]], is connected to the Luwian compound ''Priimuua'', which means "exceptionally courageous".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Starke |first=Frank |title=Troia im Kontext des historisch-politischen und sprachlichen Umfeldes Kleinasiens im 2. Jahrtausend |journal=Studia Troica |year=1997 |volume=7 |pages=447–87}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The certainty is growing that Wilusa/Troy belonged to the greater Luwian-speaking community," although it is not entirely clear whether Luwian was primarily the official language or in daily colloquial use.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Latacz|2004|p=116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Search for Troy ==
[[File:Priam's treasure.jpg|right|220px|thumb|[[Priam's Treasure]], which [[Heinrich Schliemann]] claimed to have found at Troy]]
With the rise of critical history, Troy and the Trojan War were, for a long time, consigned to the realms of legend. However, the true location of ancient Troy had from [[Classical antiquity|classical]] times remained the subject of interest and speculation.

The [[Troad]] peninsula was anticipated to be the location. Early modern travellers in the 16th and 17th centuries, including [[Pierre Belon]] and [[Pietro Della Valle]], had identified Troy with [[Alexandria Troas]], a ruined town approximately 20&amp;nbsp;km south of the currently accepted location.{{sfn|Schliemann|1881|p=184}} In the late 18th century, [[Jean Baptiste LeChevalier]] had identified a location near the village of [[:tr:Pınarbaşı, Ezine|Pınarbaşı, Ezine]] as the site of Troy, a mound approximately 5&amp;nbsp;km south of the currently accepted location. LeChavalier's location, published in his ''Voyage de la Troade'', was the most commonly accepted theory for almost a century.{{sfn|Schliemann|1881|pp=184–191}}

In 1822, the Scottish journalist [[Charles Maclaren]] was the first to identify with confidence the position of the city as it is now known.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Maclaren|first1=Charles|title=A Dissertation On the Topography of the Plain of Troy: Including an Examination of the Opinions of Demetrius, Chevalier, Dr. Clarke, and Major Rennell|year=2010|publisher=Bibliobazaar|isbn=1-146-73161-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UkkMAAAAYAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y|access-date=28 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Schliemann|1881|p=189}}

In 1866, [[Frank Calvert]], the brother of the United States' [[Consul|consular agent]] in the region, made extensive surveys and published in scholarly journals his identification of the hill of New Ilium (which was on farmland owned by his family) on the same site. The hill, near the city of [[Çanakkale]], was known as Hisarlik.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wood|1985|pp=42–44}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Schliemann ===
In 1868, German archaeologist [[Heinrich Schliemann]] visited Calvert and secured permission to excavate [[Hisarlik]]. In 1871–73 and 1878–79, he excavated the hill and discovered the ruins of a series of ancient cities dating from the [[Bronze Age]] to the Roman period. Schliemann declared one of these cities—at first Troy I, later Troy II—to be the city of Troy, and this identification was widely accepted at that time. Schliemann's finds at Hisarlik have become known as [[Priam's Treasure]]. They were acquired from him by the [[Museum Island|Berlin]] museums, but significant doubts about their authenticity persist.

[[File:Troja-Blick-Schliemanngraben.jpg|thumb|The view from Hisarlık across the plain of Ilium to the [[Aegean Sea]]]]
Schliemann became interested in digging at the mound of Hisarlik at the persuasion of [[Frank Calvert]]. The [[United Kingdom|British]] diplomat, considered a pioneer for the contributions he made to the archaeology of Troy, spent more than 60 years in the Troad (modern day [[Biga, Çanakkale|Biga]] peninsula, Turkey) conducting field work.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Allen|1995|p=379}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As Calvert was a principal authority on field archaeology in the region, his findings supplied evidence that Homeric Troy might exist in the hill, and played a major role in directing Heinrich Schliemann to dig at the Hisarlik.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Allen|1995|p=380}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Schliemann downplayed his collaboration with Calvert when taking credit for the findings, such that Susan Heuek Allen recently described Schliemann as a "relentlessly self-promoting amateur archaeologist".{{sfn|Allen|1999|p=From introductory [[blurb]]&amp;nbsp;–not in book itself}}

Schliemann's excavations were condemned by later archaeologists as having destroyed the main layers of the real Troy. [[Kenneth W. Harl]] in the Teaching Company's ''Great Ancient Civilizations of Asia Minor'' lecture series sarcastically claims that Schliemann's excavations were carried out with such rough methods that he did to Troy what the Greeks couldn't do in their times, destroying and levelling down the entire city walls to the ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.thegreatcourses.com/tgc/courses/course_detail.aspx?cid=363| title=Great Ancient Civilizations of Asia Minor| author=Kenneth W. Harl | accessdate=March 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars agree that the damage caused to the site is irreparable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2004/05/0514_040514_troy.html| title=Is Troy True| author=Stefan Lovgren| accessdate=March 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although his work is largely rejected, his recorded findings and artifacts added knowledge regarding ancient Western history.

=== Dörpfeld and Blegen ===
After Schliemann, the site was further excavated under the direction of [[Wilhelm Dörpfeld]] {{nowrap|(1893–94)}} and later [[Carl Blegen]] (1932–38).
&lt;ref&gt;Wilhelm Dörpfeld, Troja und Ilion, Beck &amp; Barth, 1902&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carl W. Blegen, Troy; excavations conducted by the University of Cincinnati, 1932–1938, Princeton University Press, 1950&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=April 2013}}
These excavations have shown that there were at least nine cities built, one on top of the other, at this site. In his research, Blegen came to a conclusion that Troy's nine levels could be further divided into forty-six sublevels .&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Allen|1995|p=259}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Korfmann ===
In 1988, excavations were resumed by a team from the [[Eberhard Karls University of Tübingen|University of Tübingen]] and the [[University of Cincinnati]] under the direction of Professor [[Manfred Korfmann]], with Professor [[C. Brian Rose|Brian Rose]] overseeing Post-Bronze Age (Greek, Roman, Byzantine) excavation along the coast of the Aegean Sea at the Bay of Troy. Possible evidence of a battle was found in the form of bronze arrowheads and fire-damaged human remains buried in layers dated to the early 12th century BC. The question of Troy's status in the Bronze-Age world has been the subject of a sometimes acerbic debate between Korfmann and the Tübingen historian [[Frank Kolb]] in 2001–2002.

In August 1993, following a magnetic imaging survey of the fields below the fort, a deep ditch was located and excavated among the ruins of a later Greek and Roman city. Remains found in the ditch were dated to the late Bronze Age, the alleged time of Homeric Troy. It is claimed by Korfmann that the ditch may have once marked the outer defences of a much larger city than had previously been suspected. The latter city has been dated by his team to about 1250&amp;nbsp;BC, and it has been also suggested — based on recent archeological evidence uncovered by Professor Manfred Korfmann's team — that this was indeed the Homeric city of Troy.

=== Recent developments ===
The archaeological site of Troy was added to the [[UNESCO World Heritage]] list in 1998.

In summer 2006, the excavations continued under the direction of Korfmann's colleague Ernst Pernicka, with a new digging permit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uni-tuebingen.de//uni/aft/|title=Project Troia|publisher=[[University of Tübingen]], [[University of Cincinnati]]|access-date=6 March 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140526125407/http://www.uni-tuebingen.de/uni/aft/|archivedate=26 May 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, an international team made up of cross-disciplinary experts led by William Aylward, an archaeologist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, was to carry out new excavations. This activity was to be conducted under the auspices of [[Çanakkale Onsekiz Mart University]] and was to use the new technique of "molecular archaeology".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.news.wisc.edu/21160 |title=UW-Madison archaeologists to mount new expedition to Troy}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few days before the Wisconsin team was to leave, Turkey cancelled about 100 excavation permits, including Wisconsin's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Simmons |first=Dan |title=UW-Madison archaeology trip to Troy postponed until next summer |url=http://host.madison.com/news/local/education/university/uw-madison-archaeology-trip-to-troy-postponed-until-next-summer/article_2bf073da-cee6-53c9-9bc1-15fdc2905712.html |access-date=6 May 2014 |newspaper=Wisconsin State Journal |date=July 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2014, it was announced that a new excavation would take place to be sponsored by a private company and carried out by Çanakkale Onsekiz Mart University. This will be the first Turkish team to excavate and is planned as a 12-month excavation led by associate professor Rüstem Aslan. The University's rector stated that "Pieces unearthed in Troy will contribute to Çanakkale’s culture and tourism. Maybe it will become one of Turkey’s most important frequented historical places.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Çanakkale&amp;nbsp;– Dogan News Agency|title=New term excavations start at city of Troy with Turkish team|url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/new-term-excavations-start-at-city-of-troy-with-turkish-team.aspx?pageID=238&amp;nID=63540&amp;NewsCatID=375|website=hurriyetdailynews.com|publisher=Hurriyet daily News|accessdate=28 December 2014|date=13 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fortifications of the city ==
The walls of Troy, first erected in the Bronze Age between 3000 and 2600 BC, are its main defense. The remains of the walls have been studied through the aforementioned excavations that shed light onto the historical city itself and the mythological implications as the walls protected the citadel during the [[Trojan War]]. The fortifications display the importance of defense to the Trojans and how warfare is a prominent issue for ancient cities.

The walls surround the city, extending for several hundred meters, and at the time they were built they were over 17 feet tall.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Troy-ancient-city-Turkey|title=Troy|last=the Editors of Encyclopædia Britannica|first=|date=November 22, 2016|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were made of limestone, with watchtowers and brick ramparts, or elevated mounds that served as protective barriers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Throughout all of the phases, the walls served as the largest fortification to protect the Trojans against their enemies. Defense mechanisms like the walls of Troy shed light on the larger topic of warfare in ancient times, which was a significant issue in Ancient Greece and in nearby locations such as Asia Minor.

=== Troy I–V ===
The first city on the site was founded in the 3rd millennium BC. During the [[Bronze Age]], the site seems to have been a flourishing mercantile city, since its location allowed for complete control of the [[Dardanelles]], through which every merchant ship from the [[Aegean Sea]] heading for the [[Black Sea]] had to pass. Around 1900&amp;nbsp;BC a [[1900 BCE Near East mass migration|mass migration was set off by the Hittites]] to the east. Cities to the east of Troy were destroyed, and although Troy was not burned, the next period shows a change of culture indicating a new people had taken over Troy.&lt;ref name="Mellaart"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/500459 |last=Mellaart |first=James |date=January 1958 |title=The end of the early Bronze Age in Anatolia and the Aegean |journal=[[American Journal of Archaeology]] |volume=62 |issue=1 |pages=9–33 |jstor=500459 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first phase of the city is characterized by a smaller citadel, around 300&amp;nbsp;ft in diameter, with 20 rectangular houses surrounded by massive walls, towers, and gateways.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Troy II doubled in size and had a lower town and the upper citadel, with the walls protecting the upper acropolis which housed the [[megaron]]-style palace for the king.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Greek Art and Archaeology|last=Neer|first=Richard T.|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson|year=2012|isbn=9780500288771|location=New York|pages=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second phase was destroyed by a large fire, but the Trojans rebuilt, creating a fortified citadel larger than Troy II, but which had smaller and more condensed houses, suggesting an economic decline.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This trend of making a larger circuit, or extent of the walls, continued with each rebuild, for Troy III, IV, and V. Therefore, even in the face of economic troubles, the walls remained as elaborate as before, indicating their focus on defense and protection.

==== Schliemann's Troy II ====
When Schliemann came across Troy II, in 1871, he believed he had found Homer's city. Schliemann and his team unearthed a large feature he dubbed the Scaean Gate, a western gate unlike the three previously found leading to the Pergamos.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schliemann|1881|p=75}}&lt;/ref&gt; This gate, as he describes, was the gate that Homer had featured. As Schliemann states in his publication ''Troja'':
"I have proved that in a remote antiquity there was in the plain of Troy a large city, destroyed of old by a fearful catastrophe, which had on the hill of Hisarlık only its Acropolis with its temples and a few other large edifices, southerly, and westerly direction on the site of the later Ilium; and that, consequently, this city answers perfectly to the Homeric description of the sacred site of Ilios."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schliemann|1881|p=277}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Troy VI and VII ===
{{Main|Troy VII}}
Troy VI was destroyed around 1250 BC, probably by an [[earthquake]]. Only a single arrowhead was found in this layer, and no remains of bodies. However, the town quickly recovered and was rebuilt in a layout that was more orderly. This rebuild continued the trend of having a heavily fortified citadel to preserve the outer rim of the city in the face of earthquakes and sieges of the central city.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Troy VIIa, which has been dated to the mid-to-late-13th century BC, is the most often cited candidate for the Troy of Homer. Troy VIIa appears to have been destroyed by war.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bauer|2007|pp=253–58}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The evidence of fire and slaughter around 1184 BC, which brought Troy VIIa to a close, led to this phase being identified with the city besieged by the Greeks during the Trojan War. This was immortalized in the ''[[Iliad]]'' written by Homer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/849 |title=Archaeological Site of Troy&amp;nbsp;–  UNESCO World Heritage Centre |publisher=Whc.unesco.org |date=1998-12-02 |accessdate=2012-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Calvert's Thousand-Year Gap ====
Initially, the layers of Troy VI and VII were overlooked entirely, because Schliemann favoured the burnt city of Troy II. It was not until the need to close "Calvert's Thousand Year Gap" arose—from Dörpfeld's discovery of Troy VI—that archaeology turned away from Schliemann's Troy and began working towards finding Homeric Troy once more.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Allen|1995|p=142}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Calvert's Thousand Year Gap" (1800–800 BC) was a period not accounted for by Schliemann's archaeology and thus constituted a hole in the Trojan timeline. In Homer's description of the city, a section of one side of the wall is said to be weaker than the rest.&lt;ref&gt;Homer. "Iliad". XVI,&lt;/ref&gt; During his excavation of more than three hundred yards of the wall, Dörpfeld came across a section very closely resembling the Homeric description of the weaker section.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wood|1985|p=89}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Dörpfeld was convinced he had found the walls of Homer's city, and now he would excavate the city itself. Within the walls of this stratum (Troy VI), much [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]] pottery dating from [[Late Helladic]] (LH) periods III A and III B ({{circa}}1400–{{circa}}1200 BC) was uncovered, suggesting a relation between the Trojans and Mycenaeans. The great tower along the walls seemed likely to be the "Great Tower of Ilios".&lt;ref&gt;Homer. "Iliad". VI, 386&lt;/ref&gt;

The evidence seemed to indicate that Dörpfeld had stumbled upon Ilios, the city of Homer's epics. Schliemann himself had conceded that Troy VI was more likely to be the Homeric city, but he never published anything stating so.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Allen|1995|p=143}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The only counter-argument, confirmed initially by Dörpfeld (who was as passionate as Schliemann about finding Troy), was that the city appeared to have been destroyed by an earthquake, not by men.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wood|1985|p=228}}.&lt;/ref&gt; There was little doubt that this was the Troy of which the Mycenaeans would have known.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wood|1985|p=223}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Troy VIII ===
In 480 BC, the Persian king [[Xerxes I of Persia|Xerxes]] sacrificed 1,000 cattle at the sanctuary of Athena Ilias while marching through the Hellespontine region towards Greece.&lt;ref&gt;[[Herodotus]] 7.43.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the Persian defeat in 480–479, Ilion and its territory became part of the continental possessions of [[Mytilene]] and remained under Mytilenaean control until the unsuccessful [[Mytilenean revolt]] in 428–427. Athens liberated the so-called Actaean cities including Ilion and enrolled these communities in the [[Delian League]]. Athenian influence in the Hellespont waned following the oligarchic coup of 411, and in that year the Spartan general Mindaros emulated Xerxes by likewise sacrificing to Athena Ilias.&lt;ref name="ilium" group=note /&gt; From c. 410–399, Ilion was within the sphere of influence of the local dynasts at [[Lampsacus]] (Zenis, his wife Mania, and the usurper Meidias) who administered the region on behalf of the Persian satrap [[Pharnabazos II, Satrap of Phrygia|Pharnabazus]].&lt;ref name="ilium" group=note /&gt;

In 399, the Spartan general [[Dercylidas]] expelled the Greek garrison at Ilion who were controlling the city on behalf of the Lampsacene dynasts during a campaign which rolled back Persian influence throughout the Troad. Ilion remained outside the control of the Persian satrapal administration at [[Dascylium]] until the [[Peace of Antalcidas]] in 387–386. In this period of renewed Persian control c. 387–367, a statue of [[Ariobarzanes of Phrygia|Ariobarzanes]], the satrap of [[Hellespontine Phrygia]], was erected in front of the temple of Athena Ilias.&lt;ref&gt;Diodorus 17.17.6.&lt;/ref&gt; In 360–359 the city was briefly controlled by [[Charidemus]] of [[Oreus]], a Euboean mercenary leader who occasionally worked for the Athenians.&lt;ref&gt;Demosthenes 23.154–157; Aeneas Tacticus 24.3–14.&lt;/ref&gt; In 359, he was expelled by the Athenian Menelaos son of Arrabaios, whom the Ilians honoured with a grant of [[proxeny]]—this is recorded in the earliest civic decree to survive from Ilion.&lt;ref&gt;Inschriften von Ilion 23.&lt;/ref&gt; In May 334 [[Alexander the Great]] crossed the Hellespont and came to the city, where he visited the temple of Athena Ilias, made sacrifices at the tombs of the Homeric heroes, and made the city free and exempt from taxes.&lt;ref&gt;Arrian, ''Anabasis'' 1.11–12, Diodorus Siculus 17.17–18, Plutarch, ''Life of Alexander'' 15, Justin 9.5.12, Strabo 13.1.26, 32.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the so-called 'Last Plans' of Alexander which became known after his death in June 323, he had planned to rebuild the temple of Athena Ilias on a scale that would have surpassed every other temple in the known world.&lt;ref&gt;Diodorus 18.4.5.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Antigonus Monophthalmus]] took control of the Troad in 311 and created the new city of [[Alexandria Troas|Antigoneia Troas]] which was a [[synoikism]] of the cities of [[Skepsis]], [[Cebren|Kebren]], [[Neandreia]], [[Hamaxitus|Hamaxitos]], [[Larisa (Troad)|Larisa]], and [[Kolonai]]. In c. 311–306 the ''[[koinon]] ''of Athena Ilias was founded from the remaining cities in the Troad and along the Asian coast of the [[Dardanelles]] and soon after succeeded in securing a guarantee from Antigonus that he would respect their autonomy and freedom (he had not respected the autonomy of the cities which were synoikized to create Antigoneia).&lt;ref&gt;Inschriften von Ilion 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''koinon ''continued to function until at least the 1st century AD and primarily consisted of cities from the Troad, although for a time in the second half of the 3rd century it also included [[Myrlea]] and [[Chalcedon]] from the eastern [[Propontis]].&lt;ref&gt;Myrlea and Calchedon: Inschriften von Ilion 5–6.&lt;/ref&gt; The governing body of the ''koinon ''was the ''synedrion'' on which each city was represented by two delegates. The day-to-day running of the ''synedrion'', especially in relation to its finances, was left to a college of five ''agonothetai'', on which no city ever had more than one representative. This system of equal (rather than proportional) representation ensured that no one city could politically dominate the ''koinon''.&lt;ref&gt;D. Knoepfler, ‘Les agonothètes de la Confédération d’Athéna Ilias: une interpretation nouvelle des données épigraphiques et ses conséquences pour la chronologie des émissions monétaires du Koinon’ ''Studi Ellenistici'' 24 (2010) 33–62.&lt;/ref&gt; The primary purpose of the ''koinon ''was to organize the annual Panathenaia festival which was held at the sanctuary of Athena Ilias. The festival brought huge numbers of pilgrims to Ilion for the duration of the festival as well as creating an enormous market (the ''panegyris'') which attracted traders from across the region.&lt;ref&gt;''Panegyris'': L. Robert, Monnaies antiques en Troade (Paris 1966) 18–46.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the ''koinon ''financed new building projects at Ilion, for example a new theatre c. 306 and the expansion of the sanctuary and temple of Athena Ilias in the 3rd century, in order to make the city a suitable venue for such a large festival.&lt;ref&gt;Theatre: Inschriften von Ilion 1. Temple: C. B. Rose, ‘The Temple of Athena at Ilion’ ''Studia Troica'' 13 (2003) 27–88 and contra D. Hertel, ‘Zum Heiligtum der Athena Ilias von Troia IX und zur frühhellenistischen Stadtanlage von Ilion’ ''ArchAnz ''(2004) 177–205.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the period 302–281, Ilion and the Troad were part of the kingdom of [[Lysimachus]], who during this time helped Ilion synoikize several nearby communities, thus expanding the city's population and territory.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Strabo 13.1.26: [Λυσίμαχος] συνῴκισέ τε εἰς αὐτὴν τὰς κύκλῳ πόλεις ἀρχαίας ἤδη κεκακωμένας. These probably included Birytis, Gentinos, and Sigeion: J. M. Cook, ''The Troad ''(Oxford 1973) 364. Birytis and Gentinos are not securely located, but recent excavations at Sigeion appear to independently confirm Strabo’s account by indicating an abandonment date soon after c. 300: Th. Schäfer, ''Kazı Sonuçları Toplantısı'' 32.2 (2009) 410–412, 33.2 (2012) 248–249. This may have been punishment for Sigeion resisting Lysimachus in 302: Diodorus 20.107.4.&lt;/ref&gt; Lysimachus was defeated at the [[Battle of Corupedium]] in February 281 by [[Seleucus I Nikator]], thus handing the Seleucid kingdom control of [[Asia Minor]], and in August or September of 281 when Seleucus passed through the Troad on his way to [[Lysimachia (Thrace)|Lysimachia]] in the nearby Thracian Chersonese Ilion passed a decree in honour of him, indicating the city's new loyalties.&lt;ref&gt;Inschriften von Ilion 31.&lt;/ref&gt; In September Seleucus was assassinated at Lysimachia by [[Ptolemy Keraunos]], making his successor, [[Antiochus I Soter]], the new king. In 280 or soon after Ilion passed a long decree lavishly honouring Antiochus in order to cement their relationship with him.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Inschriften von Ilion 32. A minority of scholars instead attempt to date this inscription to the reign of Antiochus III (222–187 BC).&lt;/ref&gt; During this period Ilion still lacked proper city walls except for the crumbling Troy VI fortifications around the citadel, and in 278 during the [[Gallic invasion of the Balkans|Gallic invasion]] the city was easily sacked.&lt;ref&gt;Strabo 13.1.27.&lt;/ref&gt; Ilion enjoyed a close relationship with Antiochus for the rest of his reign: for example, in 274 Antiochus granted land to his friend Aristodikides of Assos which for tax purposes was to be attached to the territory of Ilion, and c. 275–269 Ilion passed a decree in honour of Metrodoros of Amphipolis who had successfully treated the king for a wound he received in battle.&lt;ref&gt;Inschriften von Ilion 33 (Aristodikides), 34 (Metrodoros).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Troy IX ===
[[File:Tetradrachm from Troy.jpg|thumb|Silver [[tetradrachm]] from Troy with head of [[Athena]], c. 165–150&amp;nbsp;BC]]
[[File:Hadrianic Odeon in Troy IX (Ilion).Turkey (3).jpg|thumb|The [[Odeon (building)|odeon]] dates to the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] Troy IX and was renovated by [[Hadrian]] in 124 AD.]]
The city was destroyed by [[Sulla]]'s rival, the Roman general [[Gaius Flavius Fimbria|Fimbria]], in 85 BC following an eleven-day siege.&lt;ref&gt;Strabo 13.1.27, Livy, ''Periochae'' 83.&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year when Sulla had defeated Fimbria he bestowed benefactions on Ilion for its loyalty which helped with the city's rebuilding. Ilion reciprocated this act of generosity by instituting a new civic calendar which took 85 BC as its first year.&lt;ref&gt;''Inschriften von Ilion'' 10.2–3.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the city remained in financial distress for several decades, despite its favoured status with Rome. In the 80s BC, Roman ''publicani'' illegally levied taxes on the sacred estates of Athena Ilias and the city was required to call on [[Lucius Julius Caesar (consul 64 BC)|L. Julius Caesar]] for restitution; while in 80 BC, the city suffered an attack by pirates.&lt;ref&gt;''Inchriften von Ilion'' 71 (''publicani''), 73 (pirates).&lt;/ref&gt; In 77 BC the costs of running the annual festival of the ''koinon'' of Athena Ilias became too pressing for both Ilion and the other members of the ''koinon'' and L. Julius Caesar was once again required to arbitrate, this time reforming the festival so that it would be less of a financial burden.&lt;ref&gt;''Inschriften von Ilion'' 10.&lt;/ref&gt; In 74 BC the Ilians once again demonstrated their loyalty to Rome by siding with the Roman general [[Lucullus]] against Mithridates VI.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Lucullus'' 10.3, 12.2.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the final defeat of Mithridates in 63–62, [[Pompey]] rewarded the city's loyalty by becoming the benefactor of Ilion and patron of Athena Ilias.&lt;ref&gt;''Supplementum Epigraphicum Graecum'' 46.1565.&lt;/ref&gt; In 48 BC, [[Julius Caesar]] likewise bestowed benefactions on the city, recalling the city's loyalty during the Mithridatic Wars, the city's connection with his cousin L. Julius Caesar, and the family's claim that they were ultimately descended from Venus through the Trojan prince [[Aeneas]] and therefore shared kinship with the Ilians.&lt;ref&gt;Lucan, ''Pharsalia'' 9.964–999, Suetonius, ''Divus Julius'' 79.3.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 20 BC, the Emperor [[Augustus]] visited Ilion and stayed in the house of a leading citizen, Melanippides son of Euthydikos.&lt;ref&gt;Dio Cassius 54.7, ''Inschriften von Ilion'' 83.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of his visit, he also financed the restoration and rebuilding of the sanctuary of Athena Ilias, the [[bouleuterion]] (council house) and the theatre. Soon after work on the theatre was completed in 12–11 BC, Melanippides dedicated a statue of Augustus in the theatre to record this benefaction.&lt;ref&gt;''Inschriften von Ilion'' 83.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Classical Ilium (Ilion) ==
A new city called '''Ilium''' (from Greek Ilion) was founded on the site in the reign of the [[Roman Emperor]] [[Augustus]]. It flourished until the establishment of [[Constantinople]], became a bishopric in the [[Roman province]] [[Hellespontus (province)|Hellespontus]] (civil [[Diocese of Asia]]), but declined gradually in the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine era]]

=== Ecclesiastical history ===
No later than the 4th century, it was a [[suffragan]] of the provincial capital's Metropolitan [[Archdiocese of Cyzicus]], in the sway of the [[Patriarchate of Constantinople]].
Several bishops are historically documented:
* Orion attended the [[First Ecumenical Council]] at [[Nicaea]] in 325
* Leucadius was among the schismatic group of [[Arian]] heretical bishops abandoning the [[Council of Sardica]] and [[Council of Philippopolis]] in 344 to convene their alternative 'synod'.
* Theosebius partook in the [[Council of Chalcedon]] in 451.
* Johannes participated in the second [[Second Council of Constantinople|Council of Constantinople]] in 553.
* Nicetas attended the [[Second Council of Nicaea]] in 787.
* Georgius participated in the [[Council of Constantinople (869-870)|Council of Constantinople]] of 869–870 which condemned Patriarch [[Photios I of Constantinople|Photios of Constantinople]].

=== Titular see ===
The diocese was nominally restored no later than 1926 as Latin [[Titular bishopric]] of Ilium (Latin) / Ilio (Curiate Italian) / Ilien(sis) (Latin adjective).

It is vacant for decades, having had the following incumbents, so far of the fitting Episcopal (lowest) rank :
* Michel-Joseph Bourguignon d’Herbigny, [[Jesuit Order]] (S.J.) (1926.02.11 – 1937.07)
* James Maguire (1939.10.05 – 1944.10.10)
* Eugene Joseph McGuinness (1944.11.11 – 1948.02.01)
* Leo John Steck (1948.03.13 – 1950.06.19)
* Francesco Maria Franco (1950.07.10 – 1968.02.07)

== Other views and voices on Troy ==

=== Alternative views on Troy's location ===
A small minority of contemporary writers argue that Homeric Troy was not at the Hisarlik site, but elsewhere in Anatolia or outside it—e.g. in England,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Iman Jacobs | last=Wilkens | title=[[Where Troy Once Stood]]: The Mystery of Homer's ''Iliad'' and ''Odyssey'' revealed | location=[[Groningen]] | publisher= Rider &amp; Co | year=1990 | page=68 | isbn=0-7126-2463-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pergamum]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lascelles|first1=John|title=Troy: The World Deceived.

=== Hittite and Egyptian records===
In the 1920s, the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] scholar [[Emil Forrer]] claimed that the placenames Wilusa and Taruisa found in [[Hittite language|Hittite]] texts should be identified with Ilion and Troia, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Carter|Morris|1995|pp=34–35}}&lt;/ref&gt; He further noted that the name of [[Alaksandu]], a king of Wilusa mentioned in a Hittite treaty, is quite similar to Homer's [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]], whose birthname was Alexandros. Subsequent to this, the [[Tawagalawa letter]] ([[Catalogue des Textes Hittites|CTH]] 181) was found to document an unnamed Hittite king's correspondence to the king of the [[Ahhiyawa]], referring to an earlier "Wilusa episode" involving hostility on the part of the Ahhiyawa. The Hittite king was long held to be [[Mursili II]] (c.&amp;nbsp;1321–1296), but, since the 1980s, his son [[Hattusili III]] (1265–1240) is commonly preferred, although his other son [[Muwatalli II|Muwatalli]] (c.&amp;nbsp;1296–1272) remains a possibility.

Inscriptions of the [[New Kingdom of Egypt]] also record a nation T-R-S as one of the [[Sea Peoples]] who attacked [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]] during the [[Nineteenth dynasty of Egypt|XIX]] and [[Twentieth dynasty of Egypt|XX Dynasties]]. An inscription at [[Deir el-Medina]] records a victory of [[Ramesses III]] over the Sea Peoples, including one named "Tursha" (Egyptian: [''twrš3'']). It is probably the same as the earlier "Teresh" (Egyptian: [''trš.w'']) on the [[Merneptah Stele|stele]] commemorating [[Merneptah]]'s victory in a [[Ancient Libya|Libyan]] campaign around 1220&amp;nbsp;BC.

These identifications were rejected by many scholars as being improbable or at least unprovable. However, [[Trevor Bryce]] championed them in his 1998 book ''The Kingdom of the Hittites'', citing a piece of the [[Manapa-Tarhunda letter]] referring to the kingdom of Wilusa as beyond the land of the Seha River (the classical [[Caicus]] and modern [[Bakırçay]]) and near the land of "Lazpa" ([[Lesbos]]). Recent evidence also adds weight to the theory that Wilusa is identical to archaeological Troy. Hittite texts mention a [[water tunnel (physical infrastructure)|water tunnel]] at Wilusa, and a water tunnel excavated by Korfmann, previously thought to be Roman, has been dated to around 2600&amp;nbsp;BC. The identifications of Wilusa with Troy and of the Ahhiyawa with Homer's [[Achaeans (Homer)|Achaeans]] remain somewhat controversial but gained enough popularity during the 1990s to be considered majority opinion. That agrees with [[Metrical foot|metrical]] evidence in the [[Iliad]] that the name ᾽Ιλιον (Ilion) for Troy was formerly Ϝιλιον (Wilion) with a [[digamma]].

=== In later legend ===
Such was the fame of the [[Epic Cycle]] in Roman and Medieval times that it was built upon to provide a starting point for various [[founding myth]]s of national origins. The most influential, [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Aeneid]]'', traces the journeys of the Trojan prince [[Aeneas]], supposed ancestor of the [[Romulus and Remus|founders of Rome]] and the [[Julio-Claudian dynasty]]. In a later era, the heroes of Troy, both those noted in Homer and those invented for the purpose, often continued to appear in the origin stories of the nations of Early Medieval Europe.&lt;ref name=huppert&gt;{{cite journal | last=Huppert | first=George | title=The Trojan Franks and their Critics | journal=Studies in the Renaissance | volume=12 | year=1965 | pages=227–41 | doi=10.2307/2857076}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Hay | first=Denys | title=Europe: The Emergence of an Idea | year=1968 | location=Edinburgh | publisher=Edinburgh U.P. | pages=49–50}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Roman de Troie]]'' was common cultural ground for European dynasties,&lt;ref&gt;A. Joly first traced the career of the ''Roman de Troie'' in ''Benoit de Sainte-More et le Roman de Troie'' (Paris 1871).&lt;/ref&gt; as a Trojan pedigree was both gloriously ancient and established an equality with the ruling class of Rome. A Trojan pedigree could justify the occupation of parts of Rome's former territories.&lt;ref name=huppert/&gt;

On that basis, the Franks filled the lacunae of their legendary origins with Trojan and pseudo-Trojan names: in [[Fredegar]]'s 7th-century chronicle of Frankish history, Priam appears as the first king of the Franks.&lt;ref&gt;''Exinde origo Francorum fuit. Priamo primo rege habuerant.''&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=April 2013}} The Trojan origin of France was such an established article of faith that in 1714, the learned [[Nicolas Fréret]] was [[Bastille]]d for showing through historical criticism that the Franks had been Germanic, a sore point counter to [[Valois dynasty|Valois]] and [[Bourbon dynasty|Bourbon]] propaganda.&lt;ref&gt;''Larousse du XIXe siècle'' sub "Fréret", noted by Huppert 1965.&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=April 2013}}

In similar manner, [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]] reworked earlier material such as the ''[[Historia Brittonum]]'' to trace the [[List of legendary kings of Britain|legendary kings of the Britons]] from a supposed descendant of [[Aeneas]] called [[Brutus of Troy|Brutus]].

Likewise, [[Snorri Sturluson]], in the prologue to his Icelandic ''[[Prose Edda]]'', traced the genealogy of the ancestral figures in [[Norse mythology]] to characters appearing at Troy in Homer's epic, notably making [[Thor]] to be the son of [[Memnon (mythology)|Memnon]]. Sturluson referred to these figures as having made a journey across Europe towards [[Scandinavia]], setting up kingdoms as they went.

"'''Veronica'''" is a single from [[Elvis Costello]]'s 1989 album ''[[Spike (Elvis Costello album)|Spike]]'', co-written by Costello with [[Paul McCartney]]. The song "Veronica" was co-produced by [[T-Bone Burnett]] and [[Kevin Killen]], and features Paul McCartney on his iconic [[Höfner]] bass. In 2004, ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' voted it one of Costello's top ten greatest tunes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://ew.com/article/2004/09/23/elvis-costellos-10-greatest-tunes/ | title=Veronica | work=Pump It Up: Elvis Costello's 10 Greatest Tunes | publisher=Entertainment Weekly | date=9 October 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The song focuses on an older woman who has experienced severe memory loss. Costello's inspiration for this song was his grandmother, who suffered from [[Alzheimer's]]. When talking about the song on a [[VH1]] interview, Costello reminisced about his grandmother having "terrifying moments of lucidity" and how this was the inspiration for "Veronica". In his 2015 autobiography, ''Unfaithful Music &amp; Disappearing Ink'', Costello wrote of his collaboration with McCartney, "I'd brought an early version of "Veronica" that you would have recognized […] All the words I'd already written were about my paternal grandmother, Molly, or more formally, Mabel Josephine Jackson. In fact, her Catholic confirmation name, Veronica, provided the very title of the song".&lt;ref name="Unfaithful Music &amp; Disappearing Ink page 484"&gt;{{cite book| author= Elvis Costello | title= Unfaithful Music &amp; Disappearing Ink | date= 13 October 2015 | publisher= [[Viking Press|Viking]] | isbn= 978-0241003466 | page= 484}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Veronica" was also Costello's highest-charting [[Top 40]] hit in the United States, peaking at No. 19 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] singles chart, No. 1 on its [[Hot Modern Rock Tracks]] chart, and No. 10 on its [[Mainstream Rock Tracks]] chart.

==Music video==
"Veronica" and its accompanying video depicts an aged woman, probably nearing the end of her life in a retirement home, engaging in detached reminiscences from her life from young girl to young womanhood (played by [[Zoe Carides]]). The video for "Veronica" featured Costello delivering a spoken-word monologue to the camera, and occasionally singing the song softly over the original vocal track from the recording. The video, co-directed by [[John Hillcoat]] and Evan English, earned an [[MTV Video Music Award]] for [[Best Male Video]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|work=''mvdbase.com''|title=Elvis Costello Veronica|url=http://www.mvdbase.com/video.php?id=6608 |accessdate=17 February 2016|date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
