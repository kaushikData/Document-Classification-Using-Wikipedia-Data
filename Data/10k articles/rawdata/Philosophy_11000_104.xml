      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9051">The '''AI effect''' occurs when onlookers discount the behavior of an [[artificial intelligence]] program by arguing that it is not ''real'' intelligence.

Author [[Pamela McCorduck]] writes: "It's part of the history of the field of artificial intelligence that every time somebody figured out how to make a computer do something—play good checkers, solve simple but relatively informal problems—there was chorus of critics to say, 'that's not thinking'."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McCorduck|2004|p=204}}&lt;/ref&gt; AIS researcher [[Rodney Brooks]] complains "Every time we figure out a piece of it, it stops being magical; we say, 'Oh, that's just a computation.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| first=Jennifer | last =Kahn | title=It's Alive | url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/10.03/everywhere.html | magazine=Wired | issue=10.30 | accessdate=24 Aug 2008 |date=March 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=="The AI effect" tries to redefine AI to mean: AI is anything that has not been done yet==
A view taken by some people trying to promulgate the AI effect is: As soon as AI successfully solves a problem, the problem is no longer a part of AI.

[[Pamela McCorduck]] calls it an "odd [[paradox]]" that "practical AI successes, computational programs that actually achieved intelligent behavior, were soon assimilated into whatever application domain they were found to be useful in, and became silent partners alongside other problem-solving approaches, which left AI researchers to deal only with the "failures", the tough nuts that couldn't yet be cracked."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McCorduck|2004|p=423}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[IBM]]'s [[chess]] playing computer [[Deep Blue (chess computer)|Deep Blue]] succeeded in defeating [[Garry Kasparov]] in 1997, people complained that it had only used "brute force methods" and it wasn't real intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McCorduck|p=433}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fred Reed writes: &lt;blockquote&gt;"A problem that proponents of AI regularly face is this: When we know how a machine does something 'intelligent,' it ceases to be regarded as intelligent. If I beat the world's chess champion, I'd be regarded as highly bright."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news
 | author=Fred Reed
 | title =Promise of AI not so bright

 | date=2006-04-14
 | url =http://washingtontimes.com/news/2006/apr/13/20060413-105217-7645r/ 
}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Douglas Hofstadter]] expresses the AI effect concisely by quoting '''[[Larry Tesler|Tesler]]'s Theorem''': &lt;blockquote&gt;"AI is whatever hasn't been done yet."&lt;ref&gt;As quoted by {{Harvtxt|Hofstadter|1980|p=601}}. [[Larry Tesler]] actually feels he was misquoted: see his note in the "Adages" section of [http://www.nomodes.com/Larry_Tesler_Consulting/CV.html Larry Tesler's CV].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

When problems have not yet been formalised, they can still be characterised by a [[model of computation]] that includes [[human computation]]. The computational burden of a problem is split between a computer and a human: one part is solved by computer and the other part solved by human.  This formalisation is referred to as [[AI complete#Formalisation|human-assisted Turing machine]].&lt;ref&gt;Dafna Shahaf and Eyal Amir (2007) [http://www.cs.uiuc.edu/~eyal/papers/ai-complete-commonsense07.pdf Towards a theory of AI completeness]{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. [http://www.ucl.ac.uk/commonsense07 Commonsense 2007,  8th International Symposium on Logical Formalizations of Commonsense Reasoning].&lt;/ref&gt;

== AI applications become mainstream ==
Software and algorithms developed by AI researchers are now integrated into many applications throughout the world, without really being called AI.

[[Michael Swaine (technical author)|Michael Swaine]] reports "AI advances are not trumpeted as artificial intelligence so much these days, but are often seen as advances in some other field. 'AI has become more important as it has become less conspicuous,' [[Patrick Winston]] says. 'These days, it is hard to find a big system that does not work, in part, because of ideas developed or matured in the AI world.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.ddj.com/cpp/201804174

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Stottler Henke, "The great practical benefits of AI applications and even the existence of AI in many software products go largely unnoticed by many despite the already widespread use of AI techniques in software. This is the AI effect. Many marketing people don't use the term 'artificial intelligence' even when their company's products rely on some AI techniques. Why not?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url = http://www.stottlerhenke.com/ai_general/glossary.htm
| title = AI Glossary
| author=Stottler Henke
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marvin Minsky]] writes "This paradox resulted from the fact that whenever an AI research project made a useful new discovery, that product usually quickly spun off to form a new scientific or commercial specialty with its own distinctive name. These changes in name led outsiders to ask, Why do we see so little progress in the central field of artificial intelligence?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Marvin Minsky |title=The Age of Intelligent Machines: Thoughts About Artificial Intelligence |url=http://www.kurzweilai.net/articles/art0100.html?printable=1 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090628081048/http://www.kurzweilai.net/articles/art0100.html?printable=1 |archivedate=2009-06-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nick Bostrom]] observes that  'A lot of cutting edge AI has filtered into general applications, often without being called AI because once something becomes useful enough and common enough it's not labelled AI anymore.'"&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in {{Cite web| url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/TECH/science/07/24/ai.bostrom/
 | title=AI set to exceed human brain power
 | publisher= CNN.com
 | date=July 26, 2006 
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy of the AI winter ==
{{Main|AI winter}}
Many AI researchers find that they can procure more funding and sell more software if they avoid the tarnished name of "artificial intelligence" and instead pretend their work has nothing to do with intelligence at all. This was especially true in the early 1990s, during the "[[AI winter]]".

Patty Tascarella writes "Some believe the word 'robotics' actually carries a stigma that hurts a company's chances at funding"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news
 | url=http://www.bizjournals.com/pittsburgh/stories/2006/08/14/focus3.html?b=1155528000%5E1329573 
 | title=Robotics firms find fundraising struggle, with venture capital shy
 | author=Patty Tascarella 
 | newspaper=Pittsburgh Business Times
 | date=August 11, 2006
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Saving a place for humanity at the top of the chain of being ==
[[Michael_Kearns_(computer_scientist)|Michael Kearns]] suggests that "people subconsciously are trying to preserve for themselves some special role in the universe".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news
 | title=A new robot makes a leap in brainpower
 | author= Faye Flam
 | authorlink=Faye Flam
 | newspaper=Philadelphia Inquirer 
 | date=January 15, 2004
}} available from Philly.com
&lt;/ref&gt;
By discounting artificial intelligence people can continue to feel unique and special. Kearns argues that the change in perception known as the AI effect can be traced to the ''mystery'' being removed from the system: that being able to trace the cause of events implies that it's a form of automation rather than intelligence.

A related effect has been noted in the history of [[animal cognition]] and in  [[consciousness]] studies, where every time a capacity formerly thought as uniquely human is discovered in animals (e.g. the [[tool use|ability to make tools]], or passing the [[mirror test]]), the overall importance of that capacity is deprecated.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

[[Herbert A. Simon]], when asked about the lack of AI's press coverage at the time, said, "What made AI different was that the very idea of it arouses a real fear and hostility in some human breasts. So you are getting very strong emotional reactions. But that's okay. We'll live with that."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

{{Discrimination sidebar}}

'''Anti-intellectualism''' is hostility to and mistrust of [[intellect]], [[intellectual]]s, and [[intellectualism]] commonly expressed as deprecation of [[education]] and [[philosophy]], and the dismissal of [[art]], [[literature]], and [[science]] as impractical and even contemptible human pursuits.&lt;ref name="Literature 1980 p. 27"&gt;''A Handbook to Literature'' (1980), Fourth Edition, C. Hugh Holman, Ed. p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; Anti-intellectuals present themselves and are perceived as champions of common folk—[[populists]] against political and [[academic elitism]]—and tend to see educated people as a [[status class]] detached from the concerns of most people, and feel that intellectuals dominate political discourse and control [[higher education]].&lt;ref name="Literature 1980 p. 27"/&gt;

[[Totalitarian]] governments manipulate and apply anti-intellectualism to repress [[political dissent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Black Book of Communism|last=Courtois|first=Stephanie|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|page=601}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Spanish Civil War]] (1936–1939) and the following right-wing dictatorship (1939–1975) of General [[Francisco Franco]], the [[reactionary]] repression of the [[White Terror (Spain)|White Terror]] (1936–1945) was notably anti-intellectual, with most of the 200,000 civilians killed being the Spanish [[intelligentsia]], the politically active teachers and academics, artists and writers of the deposed [[Second Spanish Republic]] (1931–1939).&lt;ref&gt;''Dictionary of Wars'' (2007), Third Edition, pp. 517–18.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Communist]] state of [[Democratic Kampuchea]] (1975–1979), the [[Khmer Rouge]] régime of [[Pol Pot]] condemned most of the non-Communist intelligentsia to death in the [[Khmer Rouge Killing Fields|Killing Fields]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.woroni.com.au/articles/features/trial-khmer-rogue |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120422004018/http://www.woroni.com.au/articles/features/trial-khmer-rogue |archivedate=2012-04-22 |title=Trial of the Khmer Rogue}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ideological anti-intellectualism==
[[File:Blargos1.jpg|400px|thumb|In the "Night of the Long Batons" (29 July 1966), the federal police physically purged politically-incorrect academics, who opposed the right-wing military dictatorship of [[Juan Carlos Onganía]] (1966–70) in [[Argentina]], from five faculties of the University of Buenos Aires.]]
[[File:Flag of Democratic Kampuchea.svg|thumb|right|The cultural re-organization of Cambodian society, by the dictator [[Pol Pot]], created a government which tried to re-make its society anti-intellectual in what became known as [[Democratic Kampuchea]] (1975–1979), a de-industrialized, agricultural country.]]

In the 20th century, some societies have systematically removed intellectuals from power, sometimes assassinating them, to expediently end public political dissent. During the [[Cold War]] (1945–1991), the [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic]] (1948–1990) ostracized the philosopher [[Václav Havel]] as a politically-unreliable man unworthy of ordinary Czechs' trust; the post-communist [[Velvet Revolution]] (17 Nov.–29 Dec. 1989) elected Havel president for ten years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blisty.cz/video/Slavonic/havel.html|title=Václav Havel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966, the anti-communist Argentine [[military dictatorship]] of Gen. [[Juan Carlos Onganía]] (1966–70) intervened at the University of Buenos Aires with the [[La Noche de los Bastones Largos|Night of the Long Batons]] to physically dislodge politically-dangerous academics from five [[faculty (university)|university faculties]]. That expulsion to exile of the academic ''intelligentsia'' became a national [[brain drain]] upon the society and economy of Argentina.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fcis.oise.utoronto.ca/~dschugurensky/assignment1/1966uba.html Police repression at the Universidad de Buenos Aires] - [[University of Toronto]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} [http://www.elortiba.org/blargos.html La noche de los bastones largos] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100514124954/http://www.elortiba.org/blargos.html |date=May 14, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In support of the military repression of free speech, biochemist [[César Milstein]] said, "Our country would be put in order, as soon as all the intellectuals who were meddling in the region were expelled." In Brazil, the government banished the educator [[Paulo Freire]] for being an ignorant man, said the organizers of the current ''coup d'état.''&lt;ref name="politicalaffairs1"&gt;[http://www.politicalaffairs.net/article/articleview/4771/1/238 Political Affairs Magazine - Power and the Intellectuals&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927003056/http://www.politicalaffairs.net/article/articleview/4771/1/238 |date=September 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[ideology|Ideologically]]-extreme dictatorships who mean to recreate a society, such as the [[Khmer Rouge rule of Cambodia]] (1975–79), pre-emptively killed potential political opponents, especially the educated middle-class and the ''intelligentsia''. To realize the [[Year Zero (political notion)|Year Zero]] of Cambodian history, Khmer Rouge [[social engineering (political science)|social engineering]] restructured the economy by de-industrialization, and assassinated non-communist Cambodians suspected of "involvement in free-market activities", such as the urban professionals of society (physicians, attorneys, engineers, ''et al.'') and people with political connections to foreign governments. The [[Maoism|Maoist]] doctrine of [[Pol Pot]] identified the farmers as the true [[proletariat]] of Cambodia and the true representatives of the [[working class]] entitled to hold government power, hence the anti-intellectual purges.

Anti-intellectualism is not always violent, because any social group can act anti-intellectually and discount the [[Humanism|humanist]] value to their society of [[intellect]], [[intellectualism]], and [[higher education]]. In Uruguay, the writer [[Jorge Majfud]] said that "this contempt, that arises from a power installed in the social institutions, and from the inferiority complex of its actors, is not a property of 'underdeveloped' countries. In fact, it is always the critical intellectuals, writers, or artists who head the top-ten lists of 'The Most Stupid of the Stupid' in the country."&lt;ref name="politicalaffairs1"/&gt;

==Academic anti-intellectualism==
===United States===
In ''The Campus Wars'' (1971), the philosopher [[John Searle]] said that "the two most salient traits of the radical movement are its anti-intellectualism and its hostility to the university as an institution. ... Intellectuals, by definition, are people who take ideas seriously for their own sake. Whether or not a theory is true or false is important to them, independently of any practical applications it may have. [Intellectuals] have, as Richard Hofstadter has pointed out, an attitude to ideas that is at once playful and pious. But, in the radical movement, the intellectual ideal of knowledge for its own sake is rejected. Knowledge is seen as valuable only as a basis for action, and it is not even very valuable there. Far more important than what one knows is how one feels."&lt;ref&gt;Searle, John R. (1971). [http://www.ditext.com/searle/campus/2.html The Campus Wars, Chapter 2: The Students], URL retrieved 14 June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Social Sciences as Sorcery'' (1972), the sociologist [[Stanislav Andreski]] advised laymen to distrust the intellectuals' [[appeals to authority]] when they make questionable claims about resolving the problems of their society: "Do not be impressed by the imprint of a famous publishing house, or the volume of an author's publications. ... Remember that the publishers want to keep the printing presses busy, and do not object to nonsense if it can be sold."&lt;ref&gt;Stanislav Andreski, ''The Social Sciences as Sorcery''. 1972, The University of California Press&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Science and Relativism: Some Key Controversies in the Philosophy of Science'' (1990), the epistemologist [[Larry Laudan]] said that the prevailing type of philosophy taught at university in the U.S. ([[Postmodernism]] and [[Poststructuralism]]) is anti-intellectual, because "the displacement of the idea that facts and evidence matter, by the idea that everything boils down to subjective interests and perspectives is — second only to American political campaigns  — the most prominent and pernicious manifestation of anti-intellectualism in our time."&lt;ref&gt;Larry Laudan, ''Science and Relativism: Some Key Controversies in the Philosophy of Science'' (1990), University of Chicago Press&lt;/ref&gt;

===Distrust of intellectuals===
In the U.S., the American conservative&lt;ref&gt;https://www.beliefnet.com/columnists/attheintersectionoffaithandculture/2011/08/black-and-conservative-a-look-at-thomas-sowell.html&lt;/ref&gt; economist [[Thomas Sowell]] argued for distinctions between unreasonable and reasonable wariness of intellectuals in their influence upon the institutions of a society. In defining intellectuals as "people whose occupations deal primarily with ideas", they are different from people whose work is the practical application of ideas. That cause for layman mistrust lies in the intellectuals' incompetence outside their fields of expertise. Although possessed of great working knowledge in their specialist fields, when compared to other professions and occupations, the intellectuals of a society face little discouragement against speaking authoritatively beyond their field of formal expertise, and thus are unlikely to face responsibility for the social and practical consequences of their errors. Hence, a physician is judged competent by the effective treatment of the sickness of a patient, yet might face a medical [[malpractice]] lawsuit should the treatment harm the patient. In contrast, a [[tenure]]d university professor is unlikely to be judged competent or incompetent by the effectiveness of his or her intellectualism (ideas), and thus not face responsibility for the social and practical consequences of the implementation of the ideas, e.g. the [[Chicago Boys]] and the [[Military dictatorship of Chile (1973–90)]].

In the book ''[[Intellectuals and Society]]'' (2009), Sowell said that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;By encouraging, or even requiring, students to take stands where they have neither the knowledge nor the intellectual training to seriously examine complex issues, teachers promote the expression of unsubstantiated opinions, the venting of uninformed emotions, and the habit of acting on those opinions and emotions, while ignoring or dismissing opposing views, without having either the intellectual equipment or the personal experience to weigh one view against another in any serious way.&lt;ref name="Sowell2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sowell|first=Thomas|title=Intellectuals and Society|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r601nMi73RQC|accessdate=16 November 2013|year=2009|publisher=Basic Books|isbn=9780465019489}}{{pages needed|date=November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hence,  school teachers are part of the ''intelligentsia'' who recruit children in elementary school and teach them politics—to advocate for or to advocate against a public policy—as part of community-service projects; which political experience later assists them in earning admission to university. In that manner, the intellectuals of a society intervene and participate in social arenas of which they might not possess expert knowledge, and so unduly influence the formulation and realization of [[public policy]]. In the event, teaching political advocacy in elementary school encourages students to formulate opinions "without any intellectual training or prior knowledge of those issues, making constraints against falsity few or non-existent."&lt;ref&gt;Sowell (2009), p. 296.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Britain, the anti-intellectualism of the writer [[Paul Johnson (writer)|Paul Johnson]] derived from his close examination of twentieth-century history, which revealed to him that intellectuals have continually championed disastrous public policies for [[social welfare]] and [[public education]], and warned the layman public to "beware [the] intellectuals. Not merely should they be kept well away from the levers of power, they should also be objects of suspicion when they seek to offer collective advice."&lt;ref name="Johnson2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Johnson|first=Paul|title=Intellectuals|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GTqHpZech0YC&amp;pg=PT1|accessdate=16 November 2013|date=2009-10-13|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=9780061871474}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that vein, "In the Land of the Rococo Marxists" (2000), the American writer [[Tom Wolfe]] characterized the intellectual as "a person knowledgeable in one field, who speaks out only in others."&lt;ref&gt;Wolfe, Tom. (2000). "In the Land of the Rococo Marxists", ''Harper's Monthly'', June 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

===17th century===
[[File:JohnCotton.jpg|right|thumb|300px|In the book ''The Powring Out of the Seven Vials'' (1642), the Protestant minister [[John Cotton (minister)|John Cotton]] equated education and intellectualism with atheist service to the supernatural.]]
In ''The Powring Out of the Seven Vials'' (1642), the Puritan [[John Cotton (puritan)|John Cotton]] demonized intellectual men and women by noting that "the more learned and witty you bee, the more fit to act for [[Satan]] will you bee. ... Take off the fond doting ... upon the learning of the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]], and the glorie of the Episcopacy, and the brave estates of the Prelates. I say bee not deceived by these pompes, empty shewes, and faire representations of goodly condition before the eyes of flesh and blood, bee not taken with the applause of these persons."&lt;ref name="Hofstadter, Richard 1962 p.46"&gt;Hofstadter, Richard ''Anti-intellectualism in American Life'' (1962), p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, not every [[Puritan]] concurred with Cotton's religious contempt for [[Secularism|secular]] education, some, such as [[John Harvard (clergyman)|John Harvard]], founded a university.

In ''The Quest for Cosmic Justice'' (2001), the economist Thomas Sowell said that anti-intellectualism in the U.S. began in the early Colonial era, as an understandable wariness of the educated upper-classes, because the country mostly was built by people who had fled political and religious persecution by the social system of the educated upper classes. Moreover, there were few intellectuals who possessed the practical hands-on skills required to survive in the New World of North America, which absence from society lead to a deep-rooted, [[Populism|populist]] suspicion of men and women who specialize in "verbal virtuosity", rather than tangible, measurable products and services:

&lt;blockquote&gt;From its colonial beginnings, American society was a "decapitated" society—largely lacking the top-most social layers of European society. The highest elites and the titled aristocracies had little reason to risk their lives crossing the Atlantic, and then face the perils of pioneering. Most of the white population of colonial America arrived as [[indentured servant]]s and the black population as [[Slavery in the United States|slaves]]. Later waves of immigrants were disproportionately [[peasant]]s and [[proletarian]]s, even when they came from Western Europe ... The rise of American society to pre-eminence, as an economic, political, and military power, was thus the triumph of the common man, and a slap across the face to the presumptions of the arrogant, whether an elite of blood or books.&lt;ref&gt;Sowell, Thomas. (2001) ''The Quest for Cosmic Justice''. Simon and Schuster, 2001, {{ISBN|978-0-7432-1507-7}}, p. 187.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===19th century===
In U.S. history, the advocacy and acceptability of anti-intellectualism varied, because in the 19th century most people lived a [[rural]] life of [[manual labour]] and agricultural work, therefore, an academic education in the Græco–Roman classics, was perceived as of impractical value; the bookish man is unprofitable. Yet, in general, Americans were a [[literacy|literate]] people who read [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] for intellectual pleasure and the Christian Bible for emotional succor; thus, the ideal American Man was a literate and technically-skilled man who was successful in his [[trade]], ergo a productive member of society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vinovskis|first=Maris|year=1992|title=Schooling and Poor Children in 19th-Century America|url=|journal=American Behavioral Scientist|volume=35|pages=313–331|via=|doi=10.1177/0002764292035003008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Culturally, the ideal American was the self-made man whose knowledge derived from life-experience, not an intellectual man whose knowledge of the real world derived from books, formal education, and academic study; thus, the justified anti-intellectualism reported in ''The New Purchase, or Seven and a Half Years in the Far West'' (1843), the Rev. Bayard R. Hall, A.M., said about frontier Indiana:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
We always preferred an ignorant, bad man to a talented one, and, hence, attempts were usually made to ruin the [[morality|moral]] character of a smart candidate; since, unhappily, [[Intellectual giftedness|smartness]] and wickedness were supposed to be generally coupled, and [like-wise] incompetence and goodness.&lt;ref name="Hofstadter, Richard 1962 p.46"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Yet, in the society of the U.S., the "real-life" redemption of the [[egghead]] intellectual was possible if he embraced the [[mores]] of mainstream society; thus, in the fiction of [[O. Henry]], a character noted that once an East Coast university graduate "gets over" his intellectual vanity—he no longer thinks himself better than other men—he makes just as good a [[cowboy]] as any other young man, despite his common-man counterpart being the slow-witted naïf of good heart, a pop culture [[stereotype]] from stage shows.

=== 20th/21st centuries ===
Political polarization in the U.S. favoured the use of anti-intellectualism by each political party (Republican and Democratic) to undermine the credibility of the other party with the [[middle class]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/06/12/7-things-to-know-about-polarization-in-america/|title=7 Things to Know about Polarization in America|date=2014-06-12|work=Pew Research Center|access-date=2017-03-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Anti-Intellectualism in American Life]]'' (1963) the historian [[Richard Hofstadter]] said that anti-intellectualism is a social-class response, by the middle-class "mob", against the privileges of the political élites.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Anti-Intellectualism in American Life|last=Hofstadter|first=Richard|publisher=Alfred A. Knopf|year=1963|isbn=0394415353|location=United States of America}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the middle class developed political power, they exercised their belief that the ideal candidate to office was the "self-made man", not the well-educated man born to wealth. The self-made man, from the middle class,  could be trusted to act in the best interest of his fellow citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Empire of Liberty: A History of the Early Republic, 1789-1815|last=Wood|first=Gordon|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2011|isbn=0199832463}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Americans and Chinese: Passages to Differences'' (1980), Francis Hsu said that American [[egalitarianism]] is stronger in the U.S. than in Europe, e.g. in England,

&lt;blockquote&gt;English individualism developed hand in hand with legal equality. American self-reliance, on the other hand, has been inseparable from an insistence upon economic and social as well as political equality. The result is that a qualified individualism, with a qualified equality, has prevailed in England, but what has been considered the unalienable right of every American is unrestricted self-reliance and, at least ideally, unrestricted equality. The English, therefore, tend to respect class-based distinctions in birth, wealth, status, manners, and speech, while Americans resent them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Americans and Chinese: Passages to Differences|last=Hsu|first=Francis|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|year=1980|isbn=082480757X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Such social resentment characterises contemporary political discussions about the socio-political functions of mass-communication media and science; that is, scientific facts, generally accepted by educated people throughout the world, are misrepresented as opinions in the U.S., specifically about [[climate science]] and [[global warming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewglobal.org/2015/11/05/global-concern-about-climate-change-broad-support-for-limiting-emissions/|title=Global Concern about Climate Change, Broad Support for Limiting Emissions|last=Stokes|first=Bruce|last2=Wike|first2=Richard|date=2015-11-05|website=Pew Research Center's Global Attitudes Project|access-date=2017-03-01|last3=Carle|first3=Jill}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1912, the New Jersey governor, Woodrow Wilson, described the battles of anti-intellectualism:

&lt;blockquote&gt;What I fear is a government of experts. God forbid that, in a democratic country, we should resign the task and give the government over to experts. What are we for if we are to be scientifically taken care of by a small number of gentlemen who are the only men who understand the job?&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Introduction: The Tension between Science and Politics|last=Dreger|first=Jonas|publisher=Palgrave Macmillian UK|year=2014|isbn=978-1-349-47918-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Miami University anthropology professor H. Sidky has argued that 21st-century anti-scientific and pseudoscientific approaches to knowledge, particularly in the United States, are rooted in a postmodernist "decades-long academic assault on science:" "Many of those indoctrinated in postmodern anti-science went on to become conservative political and religious leaders, policymakers, journalists, journal editors, judges, lawyers, and members of city councils and school boards. Sadly, they forgot the lofty ideals of their teachers, except that science is bogus."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sidky |first1=H. |title=The War on Science, Anti-Intellectualism, and ‘Alternative Ways of Knowing’ in 21st-Century America |journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |date=2018 |volume=42 |issue=2 |pages=38-43 |url=https://www.csicop.org/si/show/e_war_on_science_anti-intellectualism_and_alternative_ways_of_knowing_in_21 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180606170145/https://www.csicop.org/si/show/e_war_on_science_anti-intellectualism_and_alternative_ways_of_knowing_in_21 |archivedate=2018-06-06 |accessdate=6 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, 53% of Republican U.S. Representatives and 74% of Republican Senators deny the scientific facts of the causes of climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/wired-success/201407/anti-intellectualism-and-the-dumbing-down-america|title=Anti-Intellectualism and the "Dumbing Down" of America|website=Psychology Today|language=en|access-date=2017-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Corporate mass media ====
The reportage of corporate mass-communications media appealed to societal anti-intellectualism by misrepresenting university life in the U.S., where the students' pursuit of book learning (intellectualism) was secondary to the after-school social life. That the [[reactionary]] ideology communicated in mass-media reportage misrepresented the liberal political activism and social protest of students as frivolous, social activities thematically unrelated to the academic curriculum, which is the purpose of attending university.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Anti-Intellectualism in American Media|last=Dane|first=Claussen|publisher=Peter Lang Publishing|year=2004|isbn=0-8204-5721-3|location=New York|pages=197–198}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Anti-intellectualism in American Media'' (2004), Dane Clausen identified the contemporary anti-intellectualist bent of [[Manufacturing Consent|manufactured consent]] that is inherent to commodified information:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The effects of mass media on attitudes toward intellect are certainly multiple and ambiguous. On the one hand, mass communications greatly expand the sheer volume of information available for public consumption. On the other hand, much of this information comes pre-interpreted for easy digestion and laden with hidden assumption, saving consumers the work of having to [[Critical thinking|interpret it]] for themselves. Commodified information naturally tends to reflect the assumptions and interests of those who produce it, and its producers are not driven entirely by a passion to promote critical reflection.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Anti-Intellectualism in American Media|last=Dane|first=Claussen|publisher=Peter Lang Publishing|year=2004|isbn=0-8204-5721-3|location=New York|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rigney|first=Daniel|year=1991|title=Three kinds of Anti-intellectualism: Rethinking Hofstadter|url=|journal=Sociological Inquiry|volume=61|pages=431–451|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The editorial perspective of the corporate mass-media misrepresented intellectualism as a profession that is separate and apart from the jobs and occupations of regular folk. In presenting academically successful students as social failures, an undesirable social status for the average young man and young woman, corporate media established to the U.S. mainstream their opinion that the intellectualism of book-learning is a form of mental deviancy, thus, most people would shun intellectuals as friends, lest they risk social ridicule and ostracism.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Anti-Intellectualism in American Media|last=Dane|first=Claussen|publisher=Peter Lang Publishing|year=2004|isbn=0-8204-5721-3|location=New York|page=198}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, the popular acceptance of anti-intellectualism lead to populist rejection of the ''intelligentsia'' for resolving the problems of society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Claussen|first=Danes|year=|title=A Brief History of Anti-Intellectualism in American Media|url=|journal=Academe|volume=97|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, in the book ''Inventing the Egghead: The Battle over Brainpower in American Culture'' (2013), Aaron Lecklider indicated that the contemporary ideological dismissal of the ''intelligentsia'' derived from the corporate media's reactionary misrepresentations of intellectual men and women as lacking the common-sense of regular folk.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Inventing the Egghead: The Battle over Brainpower in American Culture|last=Lecklider|first=Aaron|publisher=|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Confirmation bias====
In the field of psychology, [[confirmation bias]] is the mental phenomenon that confirms the validity of a person's self-accepted beliefs, [[ideal (ethics)|ideal]]s, and [[Value system|values]], to create emotional hostility (anti-intellectualism) towards and mistrust of other beliefs, ideals, and value systems to which the anti-intellectual person has not been exposed; thus, confirmation bias is a symptom of anti-intellectualism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/science-choice/201504/what-is-confirmation-bias|title=What Is Confirmation Bias?|website=Psychology Today|language=en|access-date=2017-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The writer [[Isaac Asimov]], speaking of this, said that "There is a cult of ignorance in the United States, and there has always been. The strain of anti-intellectualism has been a constant thread winding its way through our political and cultural life, nurtured by the false notion that democracy means that 'my ignorance is just as good as your knowledge.' "&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://progresoweekly.us/cult-ignorance-u-s-anti-intellectualism-dumbing-america/|title=The cult of ignorance in the U.S.: Anti intellectualism and the 'dumbing down' of America - Progreso Weekly|date=2016-05-29|work=Progreso Weekly|access-date=2017-03-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Europe==

===Communism===
In the first decade after the [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917, the [[Bolshevik]]s suspected the [[Tsarism|Tsarist]] [[intelligentsia]] as potentially traitorous of the [[proletariat]], thus, the initial [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] government comprised men and women without much formal education.  Moreover, the deposed propertied classes were termed ''[[Lishentsy]]'' ("the disenfranchised"), whose children were excluded from education; eventually, some 200 Tsarist intellectuals such as writers, philosophers, scientists, and engineers were deported to Germany on [[Philosophers' ships]] in 1922; others were deported to [[Latvia]] and to [[Turkey]] in 1923.

During the [[revolution]]ary period, the pragmatic Bolsheviks employed "bourgeois experts" to manage the economy, industry, and agriculture, and so learn from them. After the [[Russian Civil War]] (1917–22), to achieve socialism, the [[Soviet Union|USSR]] (1922–91) emphasised literacy and education in service to modernising the country via an educated [[working class]] [[intelligentsia]], rather than an [[Ivory Tower]] intelligentsia. During the 1930s and the 1950s, [[Joseph Stalin]] replaced Lenin's intelligentsia with a "communist" intelligentsia, loyal to him and with a specifically Soviet world view, thereby producing the [[Pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] theories of [[Lysenkoism]] and [[Japhetic theory]].

===Fascism===
[[File:Giovanni Gentile.png|thumb|right|Active philosopher: [[Giovanni Gentile]], intellectual father of [[Italian Fascism]].]]

The [[Actual Idealism|idealist]] philosopher [[Giovanni Gentile]] established the intellectual basis of [[Fascism|Fascist]] ideology with the ''autoctisi'' (self-realisation) via concrete thinking that distinguished between the good (active) intellectual and the bad (passive) intellectual:

{{quote|Fascism combats ... not intelligence, but intellectualism... which is... a sickness of the intellect... not a consequence of its abuse, because the intellect cannot be used too much... it derives from the false belief that one can segregate oneself from life.|Giovanni Gentile|addressing a Congress of Fascist Culture, Bologna, 30 March 1925}}

To counter the "passive intellectual" who used his or her intellect abstractly, and therefore was "decadent", he proposed the "concrete thinking" of the active intellectual who applied intellect as [[Praxis (process)|praxis]]—a "man of action", like Fascist [[Benito Mussolini]], versus the decadent [[Communism|Communist]] [[intellectual]] [[Antonio Gramsci]]. The passive intellectual stagnates intellect by objectifying ideas, thus establishing them as objects. Hence the [[Fascism|Fascist]] rejection of materialist [[logic]], because it relies upon ''[[a priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' principles improperly counter-changed with ''a posteriori'' ones that are irrelevant to the matter-in-hand in deciding whether or not to act.

In the praxis of Gentile's concrete thinking criteria, such consideration of the ''a priori'' toward the properly ''a posteriori'' constitutes ''impractical'', decadent intellectualism. Moreover, this fascist philosophy occurred parallel to [[Actual Idealism]], his philosophic system; he opposed [[intellectualism]] for its being disconnected from the active intelligence that gets things done, i.e. thought is killed when its constituent parts are labelled, and thus rendered as discrete entities.&lt;ref&gt;Gentile, Giovanni, ''Origins and Doctrine of Fascism (with selections from other works)'', A. James Gregor, ed., pp. 22–23, 33, 65–66&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Oxford Guide to Philosophy'' (2005), Ted Honderich, ed., p. 332.&lt;/ref&gt;

Related to this, is the confrontation between the Spanish [[Franquism|franquist]] General, [[José Millán Astray#Confrontation with Unamuno|Millán Astray]], and the writer [[Miguel de Unamuno]] during the ''[[Dia de la Raza]]'' celebration at the [[University of Salamanca]], in 1936, during the [[Spanish Civil War]]. The General exclaimed: ''¡Muera la inteligencia! ¡Viva la Muerte!'' ("Death to intelligence! Long live death!"); the Falangists applauded.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

==In Asia==

===China===
====Imperial China====
[[Qin Shi Huang]] (246–210 BC), the first Emperor of unified China, consolidated political thought, and power, by suppressing [[freedom of speech]] at the suggestion of Chancellor [[Li Si]], who justified such anti-intellectualism by accusing the [[intelligentsia]] of falsely praising the emperor, and of dissenting through libel. From 213 to 206 BC, it was generally thought that the works of the [[Hundred Schools of Thought]] were incinerated, especially the ''Shi Jing'' ([[Classic of Poetry]], c. 1000 BC) and the ''Shujing'' ([[Classic of History]], c. 6th century BC). The exceptions were books by Qin historians, and books of [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalism]], an early type of [[totalitarianism]]—and the Chancellor's philosophic school (see the [[Burning of books and burying of scholars]]).
However, upon further inspection of Chinese historical annals such as the Shi Ji and the Han Shu, this was found not to be the case. The Qin Empire privately kept one copy of each of these books in the Imperial Library but it publicly ordered that the books should be banned. Those who owned copies were ordered to surrender the books to be burned; those who refused were executed.  This eventually led to the loss of most ancient works of literature and philosophy when [[Xiang Yu]] burned down the Qin palace in 208BC.

====People's Republic of China====

The [[Cultural Revolution]] was a politically violent decade (1966–76) of wide-ranging [[social engineering (political science)|social engineering]] of the [[People's Republic of China]] by its leader Chairman [[Mao Zedong|Mao]]. After several national policy crises, Mao, to regain public prestige and control of the [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC), on 16 May 1966, announced that the Party and Chinese society were permeated with liberal bourgeois elements who meant to restore [[capitalism]] to China, and that said people could only be removed with [[Aggravation of class struggle under socialism|post–revolutionary class struggle]]. To that effect, China's youth nationally organised into [[Red Guards (China)|Red Guards]], hunting the liberal bourgeois elements subverting the CCP and Chinese society. The Red Guards acted nationally, purging the country, the military, urban workers, and the leaders of the CCP. The Red Guards were particularly aggressive in attacking their teachers and professors, causing most schools and universities to be shut down once the Cultural Revolution began.  Three years later, in 1969, Mao declared the Cultural Revolution ended; yet the political intrigues continued until 1976, concluding with the arrest of the [[Gang of Four]], the ''de facto'' end of the Cultural Revolution.

===Democratic Kampuchea===
When the Communist Party of Cambodia, the [[Khmer Rouge]] (1951–81), established their regime as [[Democratic Kampuchea]] (1975–1979) in [[Cambodia]], their anti-intellectualism which idealised the country and demonised the cities was immediately imposed on the country in order to establish [[agrarian socialism]], thus, they emptied cities in order to purge the [[Khmer people|Khmer]] nation of every [[treason|traitor]], [[enemy of the state]], and [[intellectual]], often symbolised by eyeglasses (see the [[Killing Fields]]).

===Ottoman Empire===
[[File:April24Victims.jpg|thumbnail|Some of the Armenian intellectuals who were detained, deported, and killed in the Armenian Genocide of 1915]]
In the early stages of the [[Armenian Genocide]] of 1915, around 2,300 Armenian intellectuals were [[Deportation of Armenian intellectuals on 24 April 1915|deported]] from Constantinople (Istanbul) and subsequently mostly murdered by the Ottoman government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dadrian|first=Vahakn N.|authorlink=Vahakn Dadrian|title=The history of the Armenian genocide: ethnic conflict from the Balkans to Anatolia to the Caucasus|year=2004|publisher=Berghahn Books|location=New York|isbn=1-57181-666-6|page=221|edition=6th rev.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event has been described by historians as a [[decapitation strike]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Blinka|first=David S.|title=Re-creating Armenia: America and the memory of the Armenian genocide|date=2008|publisher=University of Wisconsin Press|location=Madison|page=31|quote=In what scholars commonly refer to as the decapitation strike on April 24, 1915...}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bloxham|first1=Donald|authorlink1=Donald Bloxham|title=The Great Game of Genocide: Imperialism, Nationalism, and the Destruction of the Ottoman Armenians|date=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=70|quote=...the decapitation of the Armenian nation with the series of mass arrests that began on 24 April...}}&lt;/ref&gt; which intended to deprive the Armenian population of an intellectual leadership and a chance of resistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sahаkian|first=T.

'''Bamarni'''  ([[Kurdish languages|Kurdish]]: بامه‌رنێ, Bamernê) is a Kurdish [[village]] located in [[Amedi District]] of [[Duhok Governorate]], [[Iraqi Kurdistan]].

==History==
Bamarni, Bamêrnî or Bamernê was once home to prominent [[Naqshbandi]] [[Sufi]] [[Sheikhs]], most notably [[Sheikh Ghiathadeen Naqshabandi]]. They were known for their piety and humbleness and had followers all around [[Iraq]], [[Turkey]], [[Iran]], and in general across the [[Middle East]].

Although it was a small village, Bamarni was a center for the [[Bahdinan]] region and the Takkiyah ([[khanqah]]) was visited by many followers.
{{coord|37|07|N|43|016|E|source:nlwiki_region:IQ_scale:50000|display=title}}

Bamarni Base is a Turkish Armed Forces base located at Bamerni near Dohuk, a city in Iraqi Kurdistan. It is a former Iraqi military airfield, approximately 15 miles (24 kilometers) south of the Turkish-Iraqi border. It houses 1200-2000 soldiers; 40-60 M60 tanks; other armored combat vehicles; and artillery pieces. The base also has a runway but there are no aircraft deployed there. The base is used to fight organisations such as the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) and the terrorist ISIS. In 2016, 700 ISIS terrorists were killed by Turkish soldiers operating from the base. The base is also used to train Peshmerga troops to help them fight ISIS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Unwelcome Guests |title=The Turkish Military Bases in Northern Iraq - Jamestown |url=https://jamestown.org/program/unwelcome-guests-the-turkish-military-bases-in-northern-iraq/ |website=Jamestown}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Conflict Intelligence Team |title=Turkish bases in northern Iraq |url=https://citeam.org/turkish-bases-in-northern-iraq/ |website=citeam.org |language=ru-RU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Barons' Letter of 1301''' was written by seven English earls and 96 English barons to [[Pope Boniface VIII]] as a repudiation of his claim of feudal overlordship of Scotland (expressed in the Bull [[Scimus Fili]]), and as a defence of the rights of [[Edward I of England|King Edward I]] of England as overlord of Scotland. It was, however, never sent. The letter survives in two copies, known as A and B, both held in the [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|National Archives]] at [[Kew]] under the reference E 26. Historically they were held amongst the documents in the [[Exchequer]], Treasury of the Receipt department.

The seals of the signatories to the letter survive in excellent condition. Although they are now detached from the document, they form the earliest contemporary group of true coats of arms, the rules of [[heraldry]] having only been established at around the start of the 13th century, and were stated for that reason by [[Thomas Scott-Ellis, 8th Baron Howard de Walden|Lord Howard de Walden]] to be of very great value to students of heraldry.&lt;ref&gt;Howard de Walden, p.xi: "The Barons seals, forming as they do the earliest contemporary series of veritable coats of arms, are of the greatest importance from the heraldic standpoint, and as such are worthy of careful reproduction"&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the armorials also appear in the near contemporary Falkirk [[Roll of Arms]] made before the [[Battle of Falkirk]] in 1298 and in the near contemporaneous stained glass shields in [[Dorchester Abbey]], Oxfordshire.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last1=Lamborn|first1=E. A. Greening|title=The Armorial Glass of the Oxford Diocese|url=http://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/archiveDS/archiveDownload?t=arch-787-1/dissemination/pdf/BAJ046_PDFs/BAJ046_A13_lamborn.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
The letter was written by English barons (mainly [[English feudal barony|feudal barons]] and a few barons by writ) as a repudiation to the [[pope]] of his claim to feudal overlordship of Scotland, which he had expressed in a [[papal bull]] dated 27 June 1299 at [[Agnani]]. The bull was addressed to [[Edward I of England|King Edward I]] of England and it was delivered by [[Robert Winchelsey]], [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] at [[Sweetheart Abbey]] in [[Galloway]], Scotland, on 26th or 27 August 1300. The bull is preserved in the National Archives at Kew under reference SC 7/6/10.

The king sought the advice of [[William of Sardinia]], a former [[Dean of Arches]] to the Archbishop, as to what his response should be, and was presented with various options set out in a letter preserved in the National Archives (C/47/31/15). The Papal bull had been delivered to the king at a sensitive moment, just after the hard-won English victory at the [[Caerlaverock Castle|Siege of Caerlaverock Castle]] over the Scots. Following their defeat at the [[Battle of Falkirk]] in 1298 the Scots had appealed to the pope for his protection, yet the English had fought to subject their northern neighbour and were not about to release it from under their control, perhaps only to rise up again against them.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}{{clarify|date=August 2012}}

The French were the real movers of the pope's claim, having suggested the move to him as a means to effect protection of the Scots, then their allies under the [[Auld Alliance]],&lt;ref&gt;Howard de Walden, Introduction, p.ix: "...claiming, on the suggestion of France, the feudal superiority, not for the Scottish but for Pope Boniface himself"&lt;/ref&gt; and were themselves allied with the Scots against the English. An English attack on a kingdom the feudal overlord of which was the pope would be virtually unthinkable in political and religious terms.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} There was thus no question of the English even considering the pope's claim, and the tone of the barons' reply to him is one of anger and open defiance, devoid of almost any of the diplomatic niceties with which the papal bull was replete.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

In the event, the Barons' Letter was never sent to the pope, as events changed rapidly to such an extent that it appeared superfluous.&lt;ref&gt;Howard de Walden, Introduction, p.x: "...Owing to the offence given by the French king at this juncture, the Pope's attention was diverted from Scotland, the position ceased to be acute and the bull together with the BL were conveniently shelved by the king"&lt;/ref&gt; A letter to the same effect from the king had however been sent to the pope; it is now held in the Vatican Archives with a copy in the National Archives at Kew under reference C 54/118. It was stored away within the archives of the Exchequer, where the two copies of it remained for several centuries until transferred to Public Record Office under the custody of the [[Master of the Rolls]] before 1903&lt;ref&gt;H de W, p.xi, writing in 1903/4 stated that they were at that time in the custody of the Master of the Rolls, the precursor in function of the Public Record Office which later became the present National Archives at Kew, where the letters are now kept under ref E26, see sources&lt;/ref&gt; and more recently transferred to the National Archives at Kew.

(Latin)

==Seals==
The letter was composed and sealed at the parliament specially convened for the purpose of replying to the Pope's letter held at Lincoln between 13–20 January 1301.&lt;ref&gt;H de W, Intro., p.ix&lt;/ref&gt; To it were summoned 9 earls and 80 barons, yet 7 earls and 96 barons are recorded in the letter itself as co-authors. Those barons who did not answer the summons sealed the letter later.

The seals appended by hempen cords to Exemplar B were "tricked" (i.e. reproduced by drawing) by [[Lancaster Herald]]  Nicholas Charles in 1611.&lt;ref&gt;Lord Howard de Walden, Some Feudal Lords and their Seals 1301, published 1903, reprinted 1984&lt;/ref&gt; He also made a transcript of Exemplar B., which clearly was then in a better state of preservation than today.&lt;ref&gt;Cotton MS Julius C, VII, f.228b, facsimile published in Lord Howard de Walden, Some Feudal Lords and their Seals 1301, 1903, pp.xxii-xxv&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst his drawings provide much detail which is otherwise difficult to see in photographs of the seals themselves, some of his transcripts of the legends are inaccurate.&lt;ref&gt;Howard de Walden, p.xi &amp; note 1, who notes especially inaccuracies in the transcribed legends from the seals of de Tregoz, de Tony, Kyme, Le Breton and FitzMarmaduke&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1903 [[Thomas Scott-Ellis, 8th Baron Howard de Walden|Lord Howard de Walden]] published Charles' drawings and a facsimile of his transcript, and also two sets of photographic images of the seals from Exemplar A; firstly of all the surviving individual cords of seals in colour (showing one face only of each seal), and secondly black and white images of each constituent seal on the cord, obverse and reverse (where existing). The number of surviving seals (series unspecified) is given as 95 by the National Archives catalogue entry, and as 72 (7 earls and 65 barons) by Brian Timms. Photographic images were published by Brian Timms on his heraldry website.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.briantimms.net/seals/baronsletter/background.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Benjamin Smith Barton''' (February 10, 1766 – December 19, 1815) was an [[United States|American]] [[botanist]], [[naturalist]], and [[physician]].

==Early life==
Barton's father, [[Thomas Barton (divine)|Rev. Thomas Barton]], was an Irish immigrant from Carrickmacross who opened a school near Norristown, Pennsylvania in 1751. His mother was Esther Rittenhouse, sister of astronomer [[David Rittenhouse]].

Between 1780 and 1782, Barton studied at [[York Academy]] in [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania]]. Two years later, he attended the [[Perelman School of Medicine|College of Philadelphia School of Medicine]], studied medicine under Dr. [[Thomas Shippen]], and attended Dr. [[Benjamin Rush]]'s lectures in 1785. Young Barton also accompanied his uncle, [[David Rittenhouse]], who had been commissioned to survey the western boundary of Pennsylvania in 1785. His travels aroused a lifelong interest in [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]]. In 1786, Barton transferred to the [[University of Edinburgh]], where he studied for two years before leaving without a degree because of financial difficulties and disagreements with two professors. Historians have erroneously claimed that Barton then studied at the [[University of Göttingen]], but that has yet to be verified.

==Medical career==
Returning to Philadelphia in 1789, Barton practiced medicine. In 1790, he was elected to a fellowship at Philadelphia's College of Physicians. The same year, he succeeded [[Adam Kuhn]] as professor of Natural History and Botany at the [[College of Philadelphia]]. The College and its medical school merged with the [[University of Pennsylvania]] the following year. Two years later, Barton was also elected as a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]].&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780-2010: Chapter B|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterB.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=May 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early 1796, Barton succeeded [[Samuel Powel Griffitts]], and became Professor of [[Materia Medica]]. Embarrassed by his lack of credentials, Barton purchased a degree of Doctor of Medicine from the [[Christian-Albrechts University]] at Kiel in August 1796.&lt;ref&gt;Ewan and Ewan, B. S. Barton, 2007, p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1813, Barton succeeded to the professorship of the Theory and Practice of Medicine after the death of  Rush but continued to lecture in natural history and botany. Concurrently with his academic position, he served as a physician at [[Pennsylvania Hospital]] from 1798 to his death, in 1815.

==Works==
[[File:Benjamin_Smith_Barton_1905.jpg|thumb|left|Profile]]
Barton corresponded with naturalists throughout the United States and Europe, and he made significant contributions to the scientific literature of his day. In 1803, Barton published ''Elements of botany, or Outlines of the natural history of vegetables'', the first American textbook on botany. Barton's work in natural history and botany was often assisted by [[William Bartram]], the traveler, botanist, and artist. Bartram provided the illustrations of North American plants for Barton's 1803 ''Elements of Botany''. From 1798 to 1804, Barton published a work on medicinal plants, ''Collections for An Essay Towards a Materia Medica of the United-States''. From 1802 to 1805 Barton edited the ''Philadelphia Medical and Physical Journal,'' and in 1803, Barton founded the short-lived American Linnaean Society of Philadelphia.

Barton was also interested in [[anatomy]] and [[zoology]], and in 1796, he published his ''Memoir Concerning the Fascinating Faculty Which Has been Ascribed to the Rattle-Snake''. In 1803, he published a comparative study of linguistics, ''Etymology of Certain English Words and on Their Affinity to Words in the Languages of Different European, Asiatic and American (Indian) Nations'', and a text on the origin of the first American people, ''New Views of the Origin of the Tribes and Nations of America'' (1797).

He was the editor of the ''Philadelphia Medical and Physical Journal'' (1805–1808), one of the oldest scientific publications in the United States.

Barton was elected a member of the [[American Antiquarian Society]] in 1814.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanantiquarian.org/memberlistb American Antiquarian Society Members Directory]&lt;/ref&gt; The Society holds among its collections a number of Barton's publications as well as a complete run of the ''Philadelphia Medical and Physical Journal''&lt;ref&gt;http://catalog.mwa.org/vwebv/holdingsInfo?bibId=22450&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archeology==
Barton also made a significant contribution to [[archeology]]. Although his early publication in 1787, ''Observations on Some Parts of Natural History,'' incorrectly attributed the prehistoric [[mound]]s of [[Ohio]] to the [[Danish people|Danes]], by his 1797 work (mentioned above), he had reconsidered his earlier claim and identified the [[Mound builder (people)|Mound builders]] correctly as Native Americans. While he was not the first to make such a claim, he may have been the first to suggest a significant age to the mounds, as he posited that they were older than [[James Ussher]]'s Biblical chronology. Lacking evidence, Barton still speculated that Native Americans originated in Asia.

==Appointments==
Barton served as vice president of the [[American Philosophical Society]] from 1802 to 1815, the year of his death, and president of the [[Philadelphia Medical Society]] from 1808 to 1815. In 1812, he was elected as a member to the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]].

==Death==
In 1815, Barton died of [[tuberculosis]] in [[New York City]].

==Legacy==
In [[botany]], his [[Binomial nomenclature#Authorship in scientific names|author abbreviation]] is '''Barton'''.

His older brother, [[William Barton (heraldist)|William Barton]], was also a member of the American Philosophical Society. His maternal uncle, [[David Rittenhouse]], served as the Society's second president after the death of founder [[Benjamin Franklin]] in 1790.

His son Thomas Pennant Barton (born in Philadelphia in 1803; died there 5 April 1869) gathered together a notable Shakespearean library. It comprised 2,000 of the rarest editions of Shakespeare's works, and formed, with about 10,000 miscellaneous books, one of the most important private collections in America. He provided by will that this should be sold after his death to some institution that could prevent its dispersion. His widow carried out his wishes, and the collection was acquired by the [[Boston Public Library]], which set apart a special room for its accommodation. A catalogue was issued, prefaced by a memoir.&lt;ref&gt;{{Appletons'|wstitle=Barton, Thomas|year=1900|inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17402">The '''Claremont Profile Method''' is a method for classifying ancient manuscripts of the [[Bible]]. It was elaborated by [[Ernest Cadman Colwell]] and his students. Professor Frederik Wisse attempted to establish an accurate and rapid procedure for the classification of the manuscript evidence of any ancient text with large manuscript attestation, and to present an adequate basis for the selection of balanced representatives of the whole tradition. The work of Wisse is limited only to three chapters in [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]]: 1, 10, and 20.

== Wisse's profiles ==

The word before the bracket is the reading of the [[United Bible Societies|UBS]] edition. The profile of a manuscript is formed by noting the numbers of those test readings where the manuscript agrees with the bold reading. The readings which are not bold are those of the [[Textus Receptus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

{{refimprove|date=August 2013}}

'''''Computer Power and Human Reason: From Judgment To Calculation''''' (San Francisco: W. H. Freeman, 1976; {{ISBN|0-7167-0463-3}}) by [[Joseph Weizenbaum]] displays his ambivalence towards computer technology and lays out the case that while [[artificial intelligence]] may be possible, we should never allow computers to make important decisions because computers will always lack human qualities such as [[compassion]] and [[wisdom]]. Weizenbaum makes the crucial distinction between deciding and choosing. Deciding is a computational activity, something that can ultimately be programmed. It is the capacity to choose that ultimately makes us human. [[Choice]], however, is the product of judgment, not calculation. Comprehensive human judgment is able to include non-mathematical factors such as emotions. Judgment can compare apples and oranges, and can do so without quantifying each fruit type and then reductively quantifying each to factors necessary for mathematical comparison.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2996">In [[ecology]], '''contest competition''' refers to a situation where available resources, such as food and mates, are utilized only by one or a few individuals, thus preventing development or reproduction of other individuals. It refers to a hypothetical situation in which several individuals stage a contest for which one eventually emerges victorious. Contest competition has been demonstrated in controlled laboratory experiments among parasitic wasps.&lt;ref name="Wai"&gt;Wai, K. M., &amp; Fujii, K. (1990). “Intraspecific larval competition among wasps parasitic of bean weevil larvae”. http://meme.biology.tohoku.ac.jp/popecol/RP%20PDF/32(1)/pp.85.pdf. Researches on population ecology, 32: 85-98.&lt;/ref&gt; Contest competition is the opposite of [[scramble competition]], a situation in which available resources are shared equally among individuals.

As contest competition allows the monopolization of resources, offspring will typically always be produced and survive until adulthood independent of the population size. This results in stable [[population dynamics]], in stark contrast to scramble competition which can result in periodic or chaotic population dynamics. The [[Beverton-Holt model]] is often used to represent population dynamics arising from contest competition. This model, and a few other well-known population models, can be explicitly derived from individual-level processes assuming contest competition and a [[random distribution]] of individuals among resources.&lt;ref name="Brannstrom"&gt;Brännström, A., and Sumpter DJT (2005). “The role of competition and clustering in population dynamics”. http://www.math.uu.se/~david/web/BrannstromSumpter05a.pdf. Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B: Biological Sciences, 275:2065-2072.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Department of History and Philosophy of Science''' ('''HPS'''), of the [[University of Cambridge]] is the largest department of [[History and Philosophy of Science]] in the United Kingdom.{{citation needed|date=September 2010}} It received a maximum rating of 4* for the majority of its submissions to the RAE 2008 [[Research Assessment Exercise]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rae.ac.uk/submissions/submission.aspx?id=60&amp;type=uoa&amp;subid=2533 RAE 2008] University of Cambridge: Philosophy: History and Philosophy of Science. Retrieved 6 September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  Located in the historic buildings of the Old Physical Chemistry Laboratories on [[Free School Lane]], [[Cambridge]], the Department teaches undergraduate courses towards the Cambridge [[Tripos]] and graduate courses including a taught Masters and PhD supervision in the field of HPS.  The Department shares its premises with the [[Whipple Museum]] and Whipple Library which provide important teaching resources for its teaching and research.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hps.cam.ac.uk/dept/ 'About the Department'] HPS Cambridge. Retrieved 5 September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic staff==
The Department of HPS at Cambridge employs twelve full-time teaching staff, approximately thirty research staff, numerous supervisors and research associates from departments and colleges across the [[University of Cambridge]], in addition to external supervisors and examiners. Until 2013 the head of department was Professor [[John Forrester (historian)|John Forrester]], an international authority in the [[History of Mind]], and a leading figure on [[Sigmund Freud]] and the history of [[psychoanalysis]]. The current head of department is Professor Jim Secord. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.people.hps.cam.ac.uk/index/teaching-officers/secord&lt;/ref&gt;Other teaching staff include, Professor [[Hasok Chang]], Dr [[Eleanor Robson]], Professor [[Simon Schaffer]], Dr [[Tim Lewens]] and Dr [[Patricia Fara]].  [[Emeritus Professor]] [[Nicholas Jardine]] retired from full-time teaching duties in the summer of 2010.

==Degree courses==
The Department offers a nine-month MPhil course in History, Philosophy and Sociology of Science, Medicine and Technology (formerly History and Philosophy of Science and Medicine).  It also supervises graduate students for the Cambridge PhD in HPS and provides  advisors in the related fields of research in History, Philosophy and Social Science.  The Department provides undergraduate teaching and supervision for students who have completed their first year at Cambridge.  Due to the interdisciplinary nature of the Cambridge Tripos system, undergraduates from a wide range of fields may study HPS.  The resources of the [[Whipple Museum]] provide for first-hand study of scientific instruments which often provide topics for student dissertations.

==History of medicine==
In recent years, the Department has regained its position as a major{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} centre for the study of the [[History of Medicine]] having formerly been a [[Wellcome]] Unit in this field.  It has played a major{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} role in the [[Wellcome Trust]] funded ''Generation to Reproduction'' project at Cambridge, led by Dr Nick Hopwood, and hosted seminars and day conferences in this field.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hps.cam.ac.uk/medicine/ HPS: History of Medicine'].

'''Didacticism''' is a philosophy that emphasizes instructional and informative qualities in [[literature]] and other types of [[art]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/2940819/Whats_Wrong_with_Didacticism What’s Wrong with Didacticism?] Academia.edu, Retrieved 30 Oct 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://coursesite.uhcl.edu/HSH/Whitec/terms/D/didactic.htm Didactic Literature or Didacticism], [[University of Houston–Clear Lake]], Retrieved 30 Oct 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The term has its origin in the [[Ancient Greek]] word διδακτικός (''didaktikos''), "related to [[education]] and teaching", and signified learning in a fascinating and intriguing manner.&lt;ref&gt;[http://repository.upenn.edu/dissertations/AAI8315998/ RELIGIOUS AWAKENING STORIES IN LATE MEDIEVAL JAPAN: THE DYNAMICS OF DIDACTICISM], Retrieved 30 Oct 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Didactic art was meant both to entertain and to instruct. Didactic plays, for instance, were intended to convey a moral theme or other rich truth to the audience.&lt;ref&gt;[http://literarydevices.net/didacticism/ Didacticism in Morality Plays], Retrieved 30 Oct 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uncp.edu/home/canada/work/allam/general/glossary.htm#d Glossary of Literary Terms] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103044158/http://www.uncp.edu/home/canada/work/allam/general/glossary.htm |date=2013-11-03 }}, The University of North Carolina at Pembroke, Retrieved 30 Oct 2013&lt;/ref&gt; An example of didactic writing is [[Alexander Pope]]'s ''[[An Essay on Criticism]]'' (1711), which offers a range of advice about critics and criticism. An example of didactism in music is the chant ''[[Ut queant laxis]]'', which was used by [[Guido of Arezzo]] to teach [[Solfège|solfege]] syllables.

Around the 19th century the term ''didactic'' came to also be used as a criticism for work that appears to be overburdened with instructive, factual, or otherwise educational information, to the detriment of the enjoyment of the reader (a meaning that was quite foreign to Greek thought). [[Edgar Allan Poe]] called didacticism the worst of "heresies" in his essay ''[[The Poetic Principle]]''.

'''{{lang|fr|Différance}}''' is a [[French language|French]] term coined by [[Jacques Derrida]]. It is a central concept in Derrida's [[deconstruction]], a [[Literary critical theory|critical]] outlook concerned with the relationship between text and meaning. The term {{lang|fr|différance}} means "difference and deferral of meaning."

==Overview==
Derrida first uses the term {{lang|fr|différance}} in his 1963 paper "{{lang|fr|Cogito et histoire de la folie|italic=no}}".&lt;ref&gt;"The economy of this writing is a regulated relationship between that which exceeds and the exceeded totality: the {{lang|fr|différance|italic=no}} of the absolute excess." (Derrida, J., 1978. Cogito and the History of Madness. From ''[[Writing and Difference]]''. Trans. A. Bass. London &amp; New York: Routledge. p. 75.) Schultz and Fried in their vast bibliography of Derrida's work cite this sentence as where "JD introduces {{lang|fr|différance|italic=no}}" for the first time. (Schultz, W.R. &amp; Fried, L.B., 1992. ''Jacques Derrida Bibliography''. London &amp; New York: Garland. p. 12.)&lt;/ref&gt; The term {{lang|fr|différance}} then played a key role in Derrida's engagement with the philosophy of [[Edmund Husserl]] in ''[[Speech and Phenomena]]''. The term was then elaborated in various other works, notably in his essay "{{lang|fr|Différance|italic=no}}" and in various interviews collected in ''Positions''.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Speech and Phenomena and other essays on Husserl's Theory of Signs'', trans. David B. Allison (Evanston: Northwestern University Press, 1973),  "{{lang|fr|Différance|italic=no}}". ''Margins of Philosophy'', trans. Alan Bass (Chicago &amp; London: Chicago University Press, 1982) and ''Positions'', trans. Alan Bass (Chicago, University of Chicago Press, 1971).&lt;/ref&gt;

The {{angbr|a}} of {{lang|fr|différance}} is a deliberate misspelling of {{lang|fr|différence}}, though the two are pronounced identically, {{IPA-fr|difeʁɑ̃s|IPA}} ({{lang|fr|différance}} plays on the fact that the French word {{lang|fr|[[wikt:différer|différer]]}} means both "to defer" and "to differ"). This misspelling highlights the fact that its written form is not heard, and serves to further subvert the traditional privileging of speech over writing (see [[archi-writing]] and [[logocentrism]]), as well as the distinction between the sensible and the intelligible.  The difference articulated by the {{angbr|a}} in {{lang|fr|différance}} is not apparent to the senses via sound, "but neither cannot it belong to intelligibility, to the ideality which is not fortuitously associated with the objectivity of ''theorein'' or understanding."&lt;ref&gt;"{{lang|fr|Différance|italic=no}}", ''Margins of Philosophy'', p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is because the language of understanding is already caught up in sensible metaphors—for example, {{lang|grc|θεωρεῖν}} ({{transl|grc|theōrein}}) means "to see" in [[Ancient Greek]].

In the essay "{{lang|fr|Différance|italic=no}}" Derrida indicates that {{lang|fr|différance}} gestures at a number of heterogeneous features that govern the production of textual meaning. The first (relating to deferral) is the notion that words and signs can never fully summon forth what they mean, but can only be defined through appeal to additional words, from which they differ. Thus, meaning is forever "deferred" or postponed through an endless chain of signifiers. The second (relating to [[Difference (poststructuralism)|difference]], sometimes referred to as ''espacement'' or "spacing") concerns the force that differentiates elements from one another, and in so doing engenders binary oppositions and hierarchies that underpin meaning itself.

Derrida developed the concept of {{lang|fr|différance}} deeper in the course of an argument against the [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] of [[Edmund Husserl|Husserl]], who sought a rigorous analysis of the role of [[memory]] and [[perception]] in our understanding of sequential items such as [[music]] or [[language]].  Derrida's approach argues that because the perceiver's mental state is constantly in [[flux]] and differs from one [[Reading (process)|re-reading]] to the next, a general theory describing this phenomenon is unachievable.

A term related to the idea of {{lang|fr|différance}} in Derrida's thought is the ''supplement'', "itself bound up in a supplementary play of meaning which defies semantic reduction."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Norris|first1=Christopher|title=Deconstruction : theory and practice|date=2002|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=9780415280105|page=32|edition=3.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Between structure and genesis ==

Derrida approaches texts as constructed around elemental oppositions which all speech has to articulate if it intends to make any sense whatsoever. This is so because identity is viewed in [[Non-essentialism|non-essentialist]] terms as a construct, and because constructs only produce meaning through the interplay of [[Difference (poststructuralism)|differences]] inside a "system of distinct signs". This approach to text, in a broad sense,&lt;ref name="Royle04p62"&gt;[[Nicholas Royle|Royle, Nicholas]] (2004) [https://books.google.com/books?id=nNaSdb9VMTwC ''Jacques Derrida''], pp. 62–63&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ferraris97p76"&gt;Derrida and Ferraris (1997) p.76
{{quote|I take great interest in questions of language and rhetoric, and I think they deserve enormous consideration; but there is a point where the authority of final jurisdiction is neither rhetorical nor linguistic, nor even discursive. The notion of trace or of text is introduced to mark the limits of the linguistic turn. This is one more reason why I prefer to speak of 'mark' rather than of language. In the first place the mark is not anthropological; it is prelinguistic; it is the possibility of language, and it is every where there is a relation to another thing or relation to an other. For such relations, the mark has no need of language.}}&lt;/ref&gt; emerges from [[semiology]] advanced by [[Ferdinand de Saussure]].

Saussure is considered one of the fathers of [[structuralism]] when he explained that terms get their meaning in reciprocal determination with other terms inside language:
{{quote|In language there are only differences. Even more important: a difference generally implies positive terms between which the difference is set up; but in language there are only differences without positive terms. Whether we take the signified or the signifier, language has neither ideas nor sounds that existed before the linguistic system, but only conceptual and phonic differences that have issued from the system. The idea or phonic substance that a sign contains is of less importance than the other signs that surround it. ... A linguistic system is a series of differences of sound combined with a series of differences of ideas; but the pairing of a certain number of acoustical signs with as many cuts made from the mass thought engenders a system of values.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Saussure|first=Ferdinand de|title=Course in General Linguistics|year=1916 [trans. 1959]|publisher=New York Philosophical Library|location=New York|pages=121–22|url=http://faculty.smu.edu/dfoster/cf3324/saussure.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Saussure explicitly suggested linguistics was only a branch of a more general semiology, of a science of signs in general, being human codes only one among others. Nevertheless, in the end, as Derrida pointed out, he made of linguistics "the regulatory model", and "for essential, and essentially metaphysical, reasons had to privilege speech, and everything that links the sign to phone":&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Jacques Derrida, "Interview with Julia Kristeva" in "Positions" (The University of Chicago Press, 1981), pp. 21
{{quote|Although Saussure recognized the necessity of putting the phonic substance between brackets ("What is essential in language, we shall see, is foreign to the phonic character of the linguistic sign" [p. 21]. "In its essence it [the linguistic signifier] is not at all phonic" [p. 164]), Saussure, for essential, and essentially metaphysical, reasons had to privilege speech, everything that links the sign to phone. He also speaks of the "natural link" between thought and voice, meaning and sound (p. 46). He even speaks of "thought-sound" (p. 156). I have attempted elsewhere to show what is traditional in such a gesture, and to what necessities it submits. In any event, it winds up contradicting the most interesting critical motive of the Course, making of linguistics the regulatory model, the "pattern" for a general semiology of which it was to be, by all rights and theoretically, only a part. The theme of the arbitrary, thus, is turned away from its most fruitful paths (formalization) toward a hierarchizing teleology: "Thus it can be said that entirely arbitrary signs realize better than any others the ideal of the semiological process; this is why language, the most complex and most widespread of the systems of expression, is also the most characteristic one of them all; in this sense linguistics can become the general pattern for all semiology, even though language is only a particular system" (p. 101). One finds exactly the same gesture and the same concepts in Hegel. The contradiction between these two moments of the Course is also marked by Saussure's recognizing elsewhere that "it is not spoken language that is natural to man, but the faculty of constituting a language, that is, a system of distinct signs ... ," that is, the possibility of the code and of articulation, independent of any substance, for example, phonic substance.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Derrida will prefer to follow the more "fruitful paths (formalization)" of a general semiotics without falling in what he considered "a hierarchizing teleology" privileging linguistics, and speak of 'mark' rather than of language, not as something restricted to mankind, but as prelinguistic, as the pure possibility of language, working every where there is a relation to something else.

Derrida sees these differences as elemental oppositions working in all languages, systems of distinct signs, and codes, where terms don't have absolute meanings but instead draw meaning from reciprocal determination with other terms. This structural difference is the first component that Derrida will take into account when articulating the meaning of {{lang|fr|différance}}, a mark he felt the need to create and will become a fundamental tool in his lifelong work: [[deconstruction]]:&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Jacques Derrida, "Interview with Julia Kristeva" in "Positions" (The University of Chicago Press, 1981), pp. 21&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|1) {{lang|fr|Différance}} is the systematic play of differences, of the traces of differences, of the spacing by means of which elements are related to each other. This spacing is the simultaneously active and passive (the ''a'' of {{lang|fr|différance}} indicates this indecision as concerns activity and passivity, that which cannot be governed by or distributed between the terms of this opposition) production of the intervals without which the "full" terms would not signify, would not function. }}

But structural difference will not be considered without him already destabilizing from the start its static, [[Synchronic analysis|synchronic]], [[Systematics – study of multi-term systems|taxonomic]], ahistoric motifs, remembering that all [[structure]] already refers to the [[Generative systems|generative]] movement in the play of differences:&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Jacques Derrida, "Interview with Julia Kristeva" in "Positions" (The University of Chicago Press, 1981), pp. 28–30
{{quote|multiline=y|It is also the becoming-space of the spoken chain—which has been called temporal or linear; a becoming-space which makes possible both writing and every correspondence between speech and writing, every passage from one to the other.

The activity or productivity connoted by the ''a'' of {{lang|fr|différance}} refers to the generative movement in the play of differences. The latter are neither fallen from the sky nor inscribed once and for all in a closed system, a static structure that a synchronic and taxonomic operation could exhaust. Differences are the effects of transformations, and from this vantage the theme of {{lang|fr|différance}} is incompatible with the static, synchronic, taxonomic, ahistoric motifs in the concept of structure.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The other main component of {{lang|fr|différance}} is [[Deferral|deferring]], which takes into account the fact that meaning is not only synchrony with all the other terms inside a structure, but also [[Synchronic analysis|diachrony]], with everything that ''was'' and ''will be'' said, in History, difference as structure and deferring as genesis:&lt;ref name="Jacques Derrida 1981 pp. 28–30"&gt;Cf. Jacques Derrida, "Interview with Julia Kristeva" in "Positions" (The University of Chicago Press, 1981), pp. 28–30&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Burke |first=Patrick |editor-last=Dillon |editor-first=M.

|quote=Derrida says that {{lang|fr|différance}} is removed from every possible mode of presence, like the unconscious of Freud, the force in Nietzsche, the Other in Levinas. So the question of {{lang|fr|différance}} must yield to the {{lang|fr|différance}} of the question and thus can never be asked, is forever absent. }}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|2) "the ''a'' of {{lang|fr|différance}} also recalls that spacing is temporization, the detour and postponement by means of which intuition, perception, consummation—in a word, the relationship to the present, the reference to a present reality, to a being—are always deferred. Deferred by virtue of the very principle of difference which holds that an element functions and signifies, takes on or conveys meaning, only by referring to another past or future element in an economy of traces. This economic aspect of {{lang|fr|différance}}, which brings into play a certain not conscious calculation in a field of forces, is inseparable from the more narrowly semiotic aspect of différance.}}

This confirms the subject as not present to itself and constituted on becoming space, in temporizing and also, as Saussure said, that "language [which consists only of differences] is not a function of the speaking subject":&lt;ref name="Jacques Derrida 1981 pp. 28–30"/&gt;
{{quote|It confirms that the subject, and first of all the conscious and speaking subject, depends upon the system of differences and the movement of différance, that the subject is not present, nor above all present to itself before différance, that the subject is constituted only in being divided from itself, in becoming space, in temporizing, in deferral; and it confirms that, as Saussure said, "language [which consists only of differences] is not a function of the speaking subject." }}

Questioned this myth of the presence of meaning in itself ("objective") and/or for itself ("subjective") Derrida will start a long deconstruction of all texts where conceptual oppositions are put to work in the actual construction of meaning and values based on the subordination of the movement of "{{lang|fr|différance}}":&lt;ref name="Jacques Derrida 1981 pp. 28–30"/&gt;
{{quote|At the point at which the concept of {{lang|fr|différance}}, and the chain attached to it, intervenes, all the conceptual oppositions of metaphysics (signifier/signified; sensible/intelligible; writing/speech; passivity/activity; etc.)—to the extent that they ultimately refer to the presence of something present (for example, in the form of the identity of the subject who is present for all his operations, present beneath every accident or event, self-present in its "living speech," in its enunciations, in the present objects and acts of its language, etc.)- become non pertinent. They all amount, at one moment or another, to a subordination of the movement of {{lang|fr|différance}} in favor of the presence of a value or a meaning supposedly antecedent to {{lang|fr|différance}}, more original than it, exceeding and governing it in the last analysis. This is still the presence of what we called above the "transcendental signified."}}

But, as Derrida also points out, these relations with other terms express not only meaning but also values. The way elemental oppositions are put to work in all texts it is not only a theoretical operation but also a practical option.
The first task of deconstruction, starting with philosophy and  afterwards revealing it operating in literary texts, juridical texts, etc., would be to overturn these oppositions:&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Jacques Derrida, "Interview with Jean-Louis Houdebine and Guy Scarpetta," in "Positions" (The University of Chicago Press, 1981), pp. 42–44&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|multiline=y|On the one hand, we must traverse a phase of overturning. To do justice to this necessity is to recognize that in a classical philosophical opposition we are not dealing with the peaceful coexistence of a vis-a-vis, but rather with a violent hierarchy. One of the two terms governs the other (axiologically, logically, etc.), or has the upper hand. 

To deconstruct the opposition, first of all, is to overturn the hierarchy at a given moment. To overlook this phase of overturning is to forget the conflictual and subordinating structure of opposition.}}

It is not that the final task of deconstruction is to surpass all oppositions, because they are structurally necessary to produce sense. They simply cannot be suspended once and for all. But this does not obviate their need to be analyzed and criticized in all its manifestations, showing the way these oppositions, logical and axiological, are at work in all discourse for it to be able to produce meaning and values.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Jacques Derrida, "Interview with Jean-Louis Houdebine and Guy Scarpetta," in "Positions" (The University of Chicago Press, 1981), p. 42

{{quote|When I say that this phase is necessary, the word phase is perhaps not the most rigorous one. It is not a question of a chronological phase, a given moment, or a page that one day simply will be turned, in order to go on to other things. The necessity of this phase is structural; it is the necessity of an interminable analysis: the hierarchy of dual oppositions always reestablishes itself. Unlike those authors whose death does not await their demise, the time for overturning is never a dead letter.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Illustration ===
For example, the word "house" derives its meaning more as a function of how it differs from "shed", "mansion", "hotel", "building", etc. (Form of Content, which [[Louis Hjelmslev]] distinguished from Form of Expression) than how the word "house" may be tied to a certain image of a traditional house (i.e. the relationship between signifier and signified) with each term being established in reciprocal determination with the other terms than by an ostensive description or definition.

When can we talk about a "house" or a "mansion" or a "shed"? The same can be said about verbs, in all the world languages: when should we stop saying "walk" and start saying "run"? The same happens, of course, with adjectives: when must we stop saying "yellow" and start saying "orange", or stop defining as "black" and start saying "white", or "rich" and "poor", "entrepreneur" and "worker", "civilized" and "primitive", "man" and "animal", "beast" and "sovereign", "christian" and "pagan", or "beautiful" and start saying "ugly", or "bad" and start saying "good", or "truth" and start saying "false", "determined" and "free"? Or "in" and "out", "here" and "there", "now" and "then", "past" and "present" and "future" and "eternal"? Not only are the topological differences between the words relevant here, but the differentials between what is signified is also covered by différance. Deferral also comes into play, as the words that occur following "house" or "white" in any expression will revise the meaning of that word, sometimes dramatically so. This is true not only with syntagmatic succession in relation with paradigmatic simultaneity, but also, in a broader sense, between diachronic succession in History related with synchronic simultaneity inside a "system of distinct signs".

Thus, complete meaning is always "differential" and postponed in language; there is never a moment when meaning is complete and total. A simple example would consist of looking up a given word in a dictionary, then proceeding to look up the words found in that word's definition, etc., also comparing with older dictionaries from different periods in time, and such a process would never end.

This is also true with all ontological oppositions and its many [[declension]]s, not only in philosophy as in human sciences in general, cultural studies, theory of Law, et cetera. For example: the intelligible and the sensible, the spontaneous and the receptive, autonomy and heteronomy, the empirical and the transcendental, immanent and transcendent, as the interior and exterior, or the founded and the founder, normal and abnormal, phonetic and writing, analysis and synthesis, the literal sense and figurative meaning in language, reason and madness in psychoanalysis, the masculine and feminine in gender theory, man and animal in ecology, the beast and the sovereign in the political field, theory and practice as distinct dominions of thought itself. In all speeches in fact (and by right) we can make clear how they were dramatized, how the cleavages were made during the centuries, each author giving it different centers and establishing different hierarchies between the terms in the opposition.

=== Paradox ===
It may seem contradictory to suggest that {{lang|fr|différance}} is neither a word nor a concept.  The difference itself between words cannot only be another word. If that is the case then {{lang|fr|différance}} appeals to ontology, creating an even bigger problem. So {{lang|fr|différance}} is either an appeal to an infinite mystery (similar to God in theology) or becomes empty of any and all meaning and is thus rendered superfluous.

== The web of language ==
We reside, according to this philosophy, in a web of language, or at least one of interpretation, that has been laid down by tradition and which shifts each time we hear or read an utterance—even if it is the same utterance.  {{lang|fr|Différance}} and [[deconstruction]] are attempts to understand this web of language, to search, in Derrida's words, for the "other of language".&lt;ref&gt;Richard Kearney, Dialogues with Contemporary Thinkers, Manchester: MUP, 1984&lt;/ref&gt;  This "other of language" is close to what [[Anglophone Philosophy]] calls the [[Sense and reference|Reference]] of a word.  There is a ''deferment'' of meaning with each act of re-reading. There is a ''difference'' of readings with each re-reading.  In Derrida's words,  "there is nothing outside the [con]text" of a word's use and its place in the lexicon.  Text, in Derrida's parlance, refers to context and includes all about the "real-life" situation of the speech/text (cf. [[speech act]] theory).

=== Temporal delay ===
For Derrida, the relationship between the Signifier and the Signified is not understood to be exactly like Saussure's. For Derrida, there was a deferral, a continual and indefinite postponement as the Signified can never be achieved. The formation of the linguistic sign is marked by movement, and is not static. The easiest way to understand this is to imagine Saussure's model as a two dimensional plane, where each signified is separated due to the difference in its sound image. (If two sound-images are exactly alike, one could not distinguish between the two.) Each signifier then would be a particular point. Derrida adds a third dimension, time. Now, the act of formation is accounted for. This is not to say that there is no relationship between the two. However, Derrida felt that the old model focused too heavily on the signifier, rather than on utterance and occurrence. The Signifier and the Signified are severed completely and irrevocably.

=== Example of word introduction ===
An example of this effect occurred in England during the Renaissance, when oranges began to be imported from the Mediterranean.  Yellow and red came to be differentiated from a new colour term, "orange".  What was the meaning of these words before 1600? – What is their meaning afterwards?  Such effects go on often in the use of language and frequently this effect forms the basis of language/meaning.  Such changes of meaning are also often centres of political violence, as is apparent in the differences invested in male/female, master/slave, citizen/foreigner etc.  Derrida seeks to modulate and question these "violent hierarchies" through [[deconstruction]].

Perhaps it is a misconception that {{lang|fr|différance}} seeks contradictory meanings. It does not necessarily do so. It can, but what it usually describes is the re-experience, the re-arrival of the moment of reading. [[Roland Barthes]] remarked that "those who fail to reread are obliged to read the same story everywhere".&lt;ref&gt;Barthes, Roland. ''S/Z''. Trans. by Richard Miller. New York: Hill and Wang, 1974, pp. 15–6.&lt;/ref&gt; This wry comment summarizes the phenomenon of different experience for each iteration.

We are discussing just one text—every text. No distinction is necessarily made between texts in this "basic" level.  The difference/deferral can be between one text and itself, or between two texts; this is the crucial distinction between traditional perspectives and [[deconstruction]].

==Deconstruction and the history of philosophy==
Derrida's neographism (rather than [[neologism]] because "neologism" would propose a ''logos'', a metaphysical category; and (more simply) because, when uttered in French, "{{lang|fr|différance|italic=no}}" is indistinguishable from "difference"—it is thus only a graphical modification, having nothing to do with a spoken ''logos'') is, of course, not just an attempt at linguistics or to discuss written texts and how they are read.  It is, most importantly, an attempt to escape the history of [[metaphysics of presence|metaphysics]]; a history that has always prioritised certain concepts, e.g., those of substance, essence, soul, spirit (idealism), matter (realism), becoming, freedom, [[Empirical evidence|sense-experience]], language, science etc.  All such ideas imply self-presence and totality.  Différance, instead, focuses on the play of presence and absence, and, in effecting a concentration of certain thinking, Derrida takes on board the thought of [[Freud]]'s unconscious (the trace), [[Heidegger]]'s destruction of [[ontotheology]], [[Nietzsche]]'s play of forces, and [[Georges Bataille|Bataille]]'s notion of [[sacrifice]] in contrast to Hegel's {{lang|de|[[Aufheben]]}}.

{{quote|{{lang|fr|Différance|italic=no}} is not only irreducible to any ontological or theological—ontotheological—reappropriation, but as the very opening of the space in which [[ontotheology]]—philosophy—produces its system and its history, it includes ontotheology, inscribing it and exceeding it without return.&lt;ref&gt;"{{lang|fr|Différance|italic=no}}", ''Margins of Philosophy'', p.6.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Yet he does not approach this absence and loss with the nostalgia that marks Heidegger's attempt to uncover some original truths beneath the accretions of a false metaphysics that have accumulated since Socrates.  Rather it is with the moods of play and affirmation that Derrida approaches the issue.

However, Derrida himself never claimed to have escaped from the metaphysics with what he has done. To the contrary, he criticises others for claiming to have demolished metaphysics thoroughly.

=== Negative theology ===
{{see also|Deconstruction and religion}}
Derrida's non-concept of différance, resembles, but is not, [[negative theology]], an attempt to present a tacit metaphysics without pointing to any existent essence as the [[first cause]] or transcendental signified.  Following his presentation of his paper "{{lang|fr|Différance|italic=no}}" in 1968, Derrida was faced with an annoyed participant who said, "It [différance] is the source of everything and one cannot know it: it is the God of negative theology." Derrida's answer was, "It is and it is not."&lt;ref name=Caputo&gt;Caputo, John. The Prayers and Tears of Jacques Derrida. Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1997, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to negative theology, which posits something supereminent and yet concealed and ineffable, {{lang|fr|différance}} is not quite transcendental, never quite "real", as it is always and already deferred from being made present.  As [[John Caputo]] writes, "{{lang|fr|Différance|italic=no}} is but a quasi-transcendental anteriority, not a supereminent, transcendental ulteriority."&lt;ref&gt;Caputo, ''Prayers and Tears'', p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; The differences and deferrings of différance, Derrida points out, are not merely ideal, they are not inscribed in the contours of the brain nor do they fall from the sky, the closest approximation would be to consider them as historical, that is, if the word history itself did not mean what it does, the airbrushing speech of the victor/vanquished.

Derrida has shown an interest in negative or [[apophasis|apophatic]] theology, one of his most important works on the topic being his essay "Sauf le nom".&lt;ref name=Sauf&gt;Derrida, Jacques. "{{lang|fr|Sauf le nom|italic=no}}". On the Name. Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life and technics ==
In ''[[Of Grammatology]]'', Derrida states that grammatology is not a "science of man" because it is concerned with the question of "the name of man." This leads Derrida into a consideration of the work of [[André Leroi-Gourhan]], and in particular his concepts of "program," "exteriorisation," and "liberation of memory." Derrida writes: "Leroi-Gourhan no longer describes the unity of man and the human adventure thus by the simple possibility of the {{lang|fr|graphie}} in general; rather as a stage or an articulation in the history of life—of what I have called différance—as the history of the {{lang|fr|grammè}}."&lt;ref name=Grammatology&gt;Derrida, Jacques. ''Of Grammatology'', Baltimore &amp; London: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1998, p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; Derrida thus explicitly refers the term {{lang|fr|différance}} to life, and in particular to life as the history of inscription and retention, whether this is genetic or technological (from writing to "electronic card indexes"). And thus grammatology is not a science of man because it deconstructs any anthropocentrism, in the sense that the inscription in question falls on both sides of the divide human/non-human.

Yet, in the article "{{lang|fr|Différance|italic=no}}", Derrida refers {{lang|fr|différance}} not to ''physis'', that is, ''life'', but to "all the others of ''physis''—''tekhnè'', ''nomos'', ''thesis'', society, freedom, history, mind, etc.—as ''physis'' differed and deferred, or as ''physis'' differing and deferring."&lt;ref name=Margins&gt;Derrida, Jacques. "{{lang|fr|Différance|italic=no}}", ''Margins of Philosophy'', Chicago &amp; London: University of Chicago Press, 1982, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bernard Stiegler]] argues in his book, ''[[Technics and Time, 1]]'', that this represents a hesitation in Derrida: "Now phusis as life was already différance. There is an indecision, a passage remaining to be thought. At issue is the specificity of the temporality of life in which life is inscription in the nonliving, spacing, temporalisation, differentiation, and deferral by, of and in the nonliving, in the dead."&lt;ref name=Technics&gt;Stiegler, Bernard. ''[[Technics and Time, 1: The Fault of Epimetheus]]'', Stanford: Stanford University Press, pp. 139–40.&lt;/ref&gt; What this suggests to Stiegler is that grammatology—a logic of the {{lang|fr|grammè}}—must be supplemented with a history of grammatisation, a history of all the forms and techniques of inscription, from genetics to technics, each stage of which will be found to possess its own logic. Only in this way can {{lang|fr|différance}} be thought as the differing and deferral ''of'' life (life as the emergence of a difference from non-life, specifically as the deferral of [[entropy]]), ''and'' as the difference ''from'' ''physis'' through which the human must inevitably be defined (the human as the inauguration of ''another'' memory, neither the memory of genetics nor that of the individual, but rather a memory consisting in "inscription in the nonliving," that is, ''technical'' memory).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16115">'''Eternalism''' is a [[philosophy|philosophical]] approach to the [[ontology|ontological]] nature of [[philosophy of space and time|time]], which takes the view that all existence in time is equally ''real'', as opposed to [[Presentism (philosophy of time)|presentism]] or the [[growing block universe]] theory of time, in which at least the future is not the same as any other time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=General Philosophy of Science: Focal Issues |first=Theo A.F.|last=Kuipers|publisher=North Holland|year=2007|isbn=978-0-444-51548-3|page=326|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qUMuFaXjNjEC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA326#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some forms of eternalism give time a similar [[ontology]] to that of [[space]], as a [[dimension]], with different times being as real as different places, and [[future]] events are "already there" in the same sense other places are already there, and that there is no [[objectivity (science)|objective]] flow of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=[[Tim Maudlin]]|title=The Metaphysics Within Physics|isbn=9780199575374|year=2010|chapter=On the Passing of Time}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is sometimes referred to as the "'''block time'''" or "'''block universe'''" theory due to its description of [[space-time]] as an unchanging four-dimensional "block",&lt;ref&gt;"Block" here refers to the idea of spacetime as something fixed and unchanging, like a solid block, and not to the actual geometric shape of space or spacetime.&lt;/ref&gt; as opposed to the view of the world as a three-dimensional space modulated by the passage of time.

==The present==

Conventionally, time is divided into three distinct regions; the "[[past]]", the "[[present]]", and the "[[future]]". Using that representational model, the past is generally seen as being immutably fixed, and the future as at least partly undefined. As time passes, the moment that was once the present becomes part of the past; and part of the future, in turn, becomes the new present. In this way time is said to pass, with a distinct present moment "moving" forward into the future and leaving the past behind. Within this intuitive understanding of time is the philosophy of [[Presentism (philosophy of time)|presentism]], which argues that only the present exists. It does not travel forward through an environment of time, moving from a real point in the past and toward a real point in the future. Instead, the present simply changes. The past and future do not exist and are only concepts used to describe the real, isolated, and changing present. This conventional model presents a number of difficult philosophical problems, and seems difficult to reconcile with currently accepted scientific theories such as the [[theory of relativity]].&lt;ref name="SEP-time"&gt;{{cite|last1=Markosian |first1=Ned |title=Time |year=2014 |work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |edition=Fall 2016 |editor=Edward N. Zalta |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2016/entries/time/ |accessdate=November 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:BarAndRing.svg|thumb|right|180px|The [[Ladder paradox#Bar and ring paradox|bar and ring paradox]] is an example of the [[relativity of simultaneity]]. Both ends of the bar pass through the ring simultaneously in the rest frame of the ring (left), but the ends of the bar pass one after the other in the rest frame of the bar (right).]]
[[Special relativity]] eliminates the concept of absolute [[simultaneity]] and a universal present: according to the [[relativity of simultaneity]], observers in different [[Frame of reference|frames of reference]] can have different measurements of whether a given pair of events happened at the same time or at different times, with there being no physical basis for preferring one frame's judgments over another's. However, there are events that may be non-simultaneous in all frames of reference: when one event is within the [[light cone]] of another—its causal past or causal future—then observers in all frames of reference show that one event preceded the other. The causal past and causal future are consistent within all frames of reference, but any other time is "elsewhere", and within it there is no present, past, or future. There is no physical basis for a set of events that represents the present.&lt;ref name="Savitt"&gt;{{citation|last1=Savitt|first1=Steven F.|title=There's No Time Like the Present (in Minkowski Spacetime)|doi=10.1086/392846|journal=Philosophy of Science|volume=67|issue=S1|date=September 2000|pages=S563–S574|citeseerx=10.1.1.14.6140}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many philosophers have argued that relativity implies eternalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|author=Thomas M. Crisp|url=http://people.biola.edu/thomasc/thomasmcrisp/Vita_files/Presentism,%20Eternalism%20and%20Relativity%20Physics.pdf|title=Presentism, Eternalism, and Relativity Physics|work=Einstein, Relativity and Absolute Simultaneity|year=2007|editor1=William Lane Craig|editor2=Quentin Smith|at=footnote 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philosopher of science Dean Rickles disagrees in some sense, but notes that "the consensus among philosophers seems to be that special and general relativity are incompatible with presentism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|author=Dean Rickles|year=2008|title=Symmetry, Structure, and Spacetime|p=158|isbn=9780444531162|publisher=[[Elsevier]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christian Wüthrich argues that supporters of presentism can only salvage absolute simultaneity if they reject either [[empiricism]] or relativity.&lt;ref name="Wuthrich2010"&gt;{{cite book |first=Christian |last=Wüthrich |year=2010 |chapter=No Presentism in Quantum Gravity |title=Space, Time, and Spacetime: Physical and Philosophical Implications of Minkowski's Unification of Space and Time |editor= Vesselin Petkov|series=Fundamental Theories of Physics |publisher=Springer |isbn=9783642135378 |lccn=2010935080 |url= http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/5363/|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=t35AR6–F5QQC&amp;pg=PA262 262–264]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such arguments are raised by [[Dean Zimmerman]] and others,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|author=Yuri Balashov|title=Persistence and Spacetime|year=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|p=222}}&lt;/ref&gt; in favor of [[Absolute space and time|a single privileged frame]] whose judgments about length, time and simultaneity are the ''true'' ones, even if there is no empirical way to distinguish this frame.&lt;ref name="Zimmerman2011"&gt;{{cite book |first=Dean |last=Zimmerman |editor= C.

== The flow of time ==
=== Antiquity ===
Arguments for and against an independent flow of time have been raised since antiquity, represented by [[fatalism]], [[reductionism]], and [[Platonism]]: Classical fatalism argues that every [[proposition]] about the future exists, and it is either true or false, hence there is a set of every true proposition about the future, which means these propositions describe the future exactly as it is, and this future is true and unavoidable. Fatalism is challenged by positing that there are propositions that are neither true nor false, for example they may be indeterminate. Reductionism questions whether time can exist independently of the relation between events, and Platonism argues that time is absolute, and it exists independently of the events that occupy it.&lt;ref name="SEP-time" /&gt;

=== Middle ages ===
The philosopher Katherin A. Rogers argued that [[Anselm of Canterbury]] took an eternalist view of time,&lt;ref&gt;Katherin A. Rogers (2007). [http://philpapers.org/rec/ROGAEA "Anselmian Eternalism"]. Faith and Philosophy 24 (1):3-27.&lt;/ref&gt; although the philosopher [[Brian Leftow]] argued against this interpretation,&lt;ref&gt;Brian Leftow (2009). [http://philpapers.org/rec/LEFAP-2 "Anselmian Presentism. Faith and Philosophy"] 26 (3):297-319.&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting that Anselm instead advocated a type of presentism. Rogers responded to this paper, defending her original interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;Katherin Rogers (2009). [http://philpapers.org/rec/ROGBTE "Back to Eternalism"]. Faith and Philosophy 26 (3):320-338.&lt;/ref&gt; Rogers also discusses this issue in her book "Anselm on Freedom", using the term "four-dimensionalism" rather than "eternalism" for the view that "the present moment is not ontologically privileged", and commenting that "[[Boethius]] and Augustine do sometimes sound rather four-dimensionalist, but Anselm is apparently the first consistently and explicitly to embrace the position."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Katherin |last=Rogers |year=2008 |title=Anselm on Freedom |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780199231676 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lg-swy7JcEAC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA159#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |page=159}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taneli Kukkonen argues in the ''Oxford Handbook of Medieval Philosophy'' that "what Augustine's and Anselm's mix of eternalist and presentist, tenseless and tensed language tells is that medieval philosophers saw no need to choose sides" the way modern philosophers do.&lt;ref&gt;From Kukkonen's chapter on "Eternity" in ''The Oxford Handbook of Medieval Philosophy'' edited by John Marenbon (2012), [https://books.google.com/books?id=2TbPp5I6nL8C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA529#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 529].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Augustine of Hippo]] wrote that [[God]] is [[eternity|outside of time]]&amp;mdash;that time exists only within the created universe.  [[Thomas Aquinas]] took the same view, and many theologians agree.  On this view, God would perceive something like a block universe, while time might appear differently to the finite beings contained within it.&lt;ref&gt;John Polkinghorne (2011). ''Science and Religion in Quest of Truth'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=pdeUz0_WXP8C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA64#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 64].&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Modern period ===
One of the most famous arguments about the nature of time in modern philosophy is presented in "[[The Unreality of Time]]" by [[J. M. E. McTaggart]].&lt;ref name=McT&gt;J. M. E. McTaggart, "The Unreality of Time", ''[[Mind (journal)|Mind]]'' 17: 457–73; reprinted in J. M. E. McTaggart, ''The Nature of Existence'', Vol. 2, 1927, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press: Book 5, Chapter 33.&lt;/ref&gt; It argues that time is an illusion. McTaggart argued that the description of events as existing in absolute time is self-contradictory, because the events have to have properties about being in the past and in the future, which are incompatible with each other. McTaggart viewed this as a contradiction in the concept of time itself, and concluded that reality is non-temporal. He called this concept the [[B-theory of time]].&lt;ref name="SEP-time" /&gt;

Dirck Vorenkamp, a professor of religious studies, argued in his paper "B-Series Temporal Order in Dogen's Theory of Time"&lt;ref&gt;Vorenkamp, Dirck (1995). [https://web.archive.org/web/20101206055549/http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-PHIL/dirck.htm "B-Series Temporal Order in Dogen's Theory of Time"]. ''Philosophy East and West'', Volume 45, Number 3, 1995 July, P.387-408.&lt;/ref&gt; that the [[Zen]] Buddhist teacher [[Dōgen]] presented views on time that contained all the main elements of McTaggart's B-series view of time (which denies any objective present), although he noted that some of Dōgen reasoning also contained A-Series notions, which Vorenkamp argued may indicate some inconsistency in Dōgen's thinking.

=== Quantum physics ===
Some philosophers appeal to a specific theory that is "timeless" in a more radical sense than the rest of physics, the theory of [[quantum gravity]]. This theory is used, for instance, in [[Julian Barbour]]'s theory of timelessness.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.platonia.com "Platonia", Julian Barbour's time-skeptical website]&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, George Ellis argues that time is absent in cosmological theories because of the details they leave out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Ellis |doi=10.1007/s10714-006-0332-z |journal=Gen. Rel. Grav. |volume=38 |title=Physics in the Real Universe: Time and Spacetime |issue=12 |pages=1797–1824 |year=2006 |arxiv=gr-qc/0605049|bibcode=2006GReGr..38.1797E }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently Hrvoje Nikolić has argued that a block time model solves the [[black hole information paradox]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Nikolic H. |doi=10.1016/j.physletb.2009.06.029 |journal=Phys. Lett. B |volume=678 |title=Resolving the black-hole information paradox by treating time on an equal footing with space |issue= 2|pages= 218|year=2009 |arxiv=0905.0538|bibcode=2009PhLB..678..218N }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Objections ==

Philosophers such as [[John Lucas (philosopher)|John Lucas]] argue that "The Block universe gives a deeply inadequate view of time. It fails to account for the passage of time, the pre-eminence of the present, the directedness of time and the difference between the future and the past."&lt;ref&gt;[[John Lucas (philosopher)|John Lucas]]''The Future'' p8&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Karl Popper]] argued in his discussion with [[Albert Einstein]] against determinism and eternalism from a common-sense standpoint.&lt;ref name="Popper2002"&gt;{{cite book |first=K.R. |last=Popper |year=2002 |title=Unended Quest: An Intellectual Autobiography |series=Routledge Classics |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9780415285896 |lccn=2002067996 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CxND59gFftMC&amp;pg=PA148 |pages=148–150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A flow-of-time theory with a strictly [[determinism|deterministic]] future, which nonetheless does not exist in the same sense as the present, would not satisfy common-sense intuitions about time. Some have argued that common-sense flow-of-time theories can be compatible with eternalism, for example [[John G. Cramer]]’s [[transactional interpretation]]. Kastner (2010) "proposed that in order to preserve the elegance and economy of the interpretation, it may be necessary to consider offer and confirmation waves as propagating in a “higher space” of possibilities.&lt;ref name="Kastner2010"&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Quantum Liar Experiment Kastner|journal=Studies in History and Philosophy of Modern Physics |volume=41| issue = =2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Francesc Pujols i Morgades''' ([[Barcelona]], 1882 - [[Martorell]], 1962) was a [[Spain|Spanish]] writer and philosopher from [[Catalonia]] .

Pujols began to write poetry during his studies in secondary school, influenced by the work of [[Jacint Verdaguer]] and [[Joan Maragall]]. He took part in the literary competition [[Jocs Florals]] of Barcelona in 1902, and won the Natural Flower with the poem “Idil·li”. In 1904  he published ''El llibre que conté les poesies de Francesc Pujols'', with a prologue by Maragall, who saw in Pujols a representative of the “living word”.

In that same year, he gave his first lecture at the [[Ateneu Barcelonès]] on the subject of the painter  [[Marian Pidelaserra]], and thus began his career as an art critic which he continued later in the book ''Recull de crítica artística'' (1921). He made a name for himself as one of the first defenders of the then controversial architect [[Antoni Gaudí]], to whom he dedicated his book ''La visió artística i religiosa d’en Gaudí'' (1927), translated into [[French language|French]] by the painter [[Salvador Dalí]] and published in [[Lausanne]] in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;Dalí, Salvador, ‘Preface’, in Robert Descharnes, Clovis Prevost and Francesc Pujols, ''La visió artística i religiosa de Gaudí'' (Barcelona: Ayma S.A., 1969)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1906, under the pen name of Augusto de Altozanos, he published his only novel, ''El Nuevo Pascual o la Prostitución'', a humorous work written in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] directly translated from Catalan. He moved to [[Madrid]], where he went more deeply into his painting and philosophical studies and met the politician [[Francesc Cambó]]. In  1908, back in  Barcelona, he frequented the group of the Ateneu Barcelonès, of which he became the secretary in 1924, when Pompeu Fabra was the president. He took part in the foundation of the group Les Arts i els Artistes and the weekly ''Papitu'', which he later edited. On the theatre side, he published ''El llibre de Job'' (1922), written in Pitarresque verse, and the tragedy ''Medeia'' (1923).

In 1918, Francesc Pujols published the work ''Concepte General de la Ciència Catalana'', in which he established the existence of a Catalan philosophical tendency, started by [[Ramon Llull]] and continued by  [[Raymond of Sabunde]] (Ramon Sibiuda); this work contains his famous prophecy according to which the Catalans are exceptional beings because they are children of the land of truth such that the day will come when Catalans, for the sole fact of being so, will go around the world and we will have everything paid for ("Arribarà un dia que els catalans, pel sol fet de ser catalans, anirem pel món i ho tindrem tot pagat"). He wrote other philosophical works in successive years, such as ''L’evolució i els principis immutables'' (1921) or ''Hiparxiologi o Ritual de la Religió Catalana'' (1937).
Francesc Pujols builds a philosophical system first called Sumpèctica or Science of the Concrete, later Hiparxiologia or Science of the Existence, and finally Pantologia or Science of the Whole. In year  1931, the writer [[Josep Pla]] dedicated a book to his thought entitled ''El sistema de Francesc Pujols. Manual d’Hiparxiologia''.

In 1926, Pujols published in two volumes ''Història de l’hegemonia catalana en la política espanyola''. Settled in Martorell, he wrote several works of a political nature such as ''La solució Cambó'' (1931) or ''El problema peninsular'' (1935).

[[Image:Pujolsmonument.JPG|thumb|right|''Monument to Francesc Pujols'', Teatre-Museu Dalí, Figueres, Spain]]
At the end of the  [[Spanish Civil War]] he went into exile in [[Prada de Conflent]] under the hospitality of  [[Pablo Casals]] (1939), known as Pablo Casals in English, and moved later to the Résidence des Intellectuels Catalans in [[Montpellier]], where he met the writer and scientist [[Alexandre Deulofeu]], and discoursed before young intellectuals such as the critic art [[Alexandre Cirici Pellicer]], the politician [[Heribert Barrera]] and [[Salvador Dalí]].  [[Dalí]] was especially enthralled with Pujols' philosophy: in 1960, he executed an oil painting titled ''Hyparxiological Sky'', and in 1974 published a book, ''Pujols per Dalí'', dedicated to his many conversations with Pujols.&lt;ref&gt;King, Elliott, ‘Winged Fantasy with Lead Feet: The Influence of Llullism and Hiparxiologi on Dalí’s Mysticism’, in Hank Hine, William Jeffett and Kelly Reynolds (eds.), ''Persistence &amp; Memory: New Critical Perspectives on Dalí at the Centennial'' (Milan: Bompiani Arte, 2004), 189-193.&lt;/ref&gt;  Finally, [[Dalí]] erected a monument to Francesc Pujols outside the entrance to the [[Dalí Theatre and Museum]] in Figueres, Spain.

Pujols returned to [[Catalonia]] in 1942, and spent a month in  prison Model in Barcelona. From 1949 and until his death, he wrote in publications such as ''Destino''.

'''Gratification''' is the pleasurable [[Emotion | emotional]] reaction of [[happiness]] in response to a fulfillment of a [[desire (emotion)|desire]] or goal.

Gratification, like all emotions, is a motivator of behavior and thus plays a role in the entire range of [[Social sciences|human social systems]].

== Instant and delayed gratification ==
The term '''instant gratification''' is often used to label the satisfactions gained by more impulsive behaviors: choosing now over tomorrow.&lt;ref&gt;R. F. Baumeister/B. J. Bushman, ''Social Psychology and Human Nature'' (2010) p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;  The skill of giving preference to long-term goals over more immediate ones is known as [[deferred gratification]] or [[patience]], and it is usually considered a [[virtue]], producing rewards in the long term.&lt;ref&gt;Baumeister, p. 120&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Walter Mischel]] developed the well-known [[marshmallow experiment]] to test gratification patterns in four-year-olds, offering one marshmallow now or two after a delay.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Goleman, ''Emotional Intelligence'' (1996) p. 79-80&lt;/ref&gt; He discovered in long-term follow-up that the ability to resist eating the marshmallow immediately was a good predictor of success in later life.  However, [[Tyler W. Watts]], [[Greg J. Duncan]], and [[Haonan Quan]], published ''Revisiting the Marshmallow Test: A Conceptual Replication Investigating Links Between Early Delay of Gratification and Later Outcomes''&lt;ref&gt;Tyler W. Watts, Greg J. Duncan, Haunan Quan, ''Sage Journals'' (2018) https://doi.org/10.1177/0956797618761661&lt;/ref&gt; debunking the original [[marshmallow experiment]]. Concluding that "This bivariate correlation was only half the size of those reported in the original studies and was reduced by two thirds in the presence of controls for family background, early cognitive ability, and the home environment. Most of the variation in adolescent achievement came from being able to wait at least 20 s. Associations between delay time and measures of behavioral outcomes at age 15 were much smaller and rarely statistically significant."

===Criticism===
While one might say that those who lack the skill to delay are [[maturity (psychological)|immature]], an excess of this skill can create problems as well; i.e. an individual becomes inflexible, or unable to take pleasure in life ([[anhedonia]]) and seize opportunities for fear of adverse consequences.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Berne, ''Sex in Human Loving'' (1970) p. 151&lt;/ref&gt; 

There are also circumstances, in an uncertain/negative environment, when seizing gratification is the rational approach,&lt;ref&gt;Frank Munger, ''Labouring Below the Line'' (2007) p. 274&lt;/ref&gt; as in wartime.&lt;ref&gt;James Holland, ''The Battle of Britain'' (2010) p. 735-9&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bipolar disorder==

Gratification is a major issue in [[bipolar disorder]]. One sign of the onset of depression is a spreading loss of the sense of gratification in such immediate things as friendship, jokes, conversation, food and sex.&lt;ref&gt;[[Aaron T. Beck]]/Brad A. Alford, ''Depression'' (2009) p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; Long-term gratification seems even more meaningless.&lt;ref&gt;Beck, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt;

By contrast, the [[Mania|manic]] can find gratification in almost anything, even a leaf falling, or seeing his crush, for example.&lt;ref&gt;Beck, p. 96&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3591">The '''Grote Chair of the Philosophy of Mind and Logic''' is an [[Financial endowment#Endowed professorships|endowed chair]] at [[University College London]].

==Origin==

Along with [[Ethics|Moral Philosophy]], Philosophy of Mind and Logic (originally called Logic and the Philosophy of the Human Mind) was one of two [[Philosophy]] chairs established at the founding of [[University College London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = A Century of Philosophy at University College, London | journal = Journal of Philosophical Studies | year = 1927 | first = G. Dawes | last = Hicks | volume = 3 | issue = 12 | pages = 468–482 | quote = [T]he one Chair would have for its province "that department of mental phenomena in which all that relates to knowledge or the acquisition and formation of ideas is concerned"}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp | 469}} The first Mind and Logic professorship was awarded to [[John Hoppus]], a Congregational minister, who held the position from 1830 to 1866. [[George Grote]], one of the college's founders and a member of its governing council, objected to the appointment on the grounds that the college was intended to be non-sectarian and that therefore a philosophy chair should not be held by a minister of religion. Because of this incident, Grote resigned from the council in 1830. In 1866 Grote, who had returned to the council in 1849, was instrumental in preventing the awarding of the chair to [[James Martineau]], a Unitarian minister, for the same reasons. Grote's preferred candidate, [[George Croom Robertson]], was appointed to the chair in 1867.

Grote's will provided an [[Financial endowment|endowment]] of £6000 for the Chair of Philosophy of Mind and Logic, with the stipulation that the income could not be awarded to a holder of the chair who was a minister of any religion. Instead, the income was to be held back and reinvested until a lay person was again appointed. Grote died in 1871 and in 1876, two years before her own death, his widow [[Harriet Grote]] passed on the £6000 to the college.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://en.wikisource.org/w/index.php?title=Grote,_George_(DNB00)&amp;oldid=2338811 | title = Grote, George (DNB00) | accessdate = 2011-03-07 | last = Croom Robertson | first = George | work = Dictionary of National Biography, 1885-1900, Volume 23 | publisher = [[Wikisource]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''HeLa''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|iː|l|ɑː}}; also '''Hela''' or '''hela''') is an [[Immortalised cell line|immortal cell line]] used in scientific research.

(Before this, cells cultured from other human cells would only survive for a few days; scientists spent more time trying to keep the cells alive than performing actual research on them. Cells from Lacks's tumor behaved differently.) As was custom for Gey's lab assistant, she labeled the culture 'HeLa', the first two letters of the patient's first and last name; this became the name of the cell line.

These were the first human cells grown in a lab that were naturally "immortal", meaning that they do not die after a set number of cell divisions (i.e. [[cellular senescence]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.tebu-bio.com/blog/2017/11/28/hela-cells-the-first-cell-line/ | title=HeLa cells: Origin of this important cell line in life science research| date=2017-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; These cells could be used for conducting a multitude of medical experiments—if the cells died, they could simply be discarded and the experiment attempted again on fresh cells from the culture. This represented an enormous boon&lt;!--boon is the correct term--&gt; to medical and biological research, as previously stocks of living cells were limited and took significant effort to culture.&lt;ref name="vpbio"/&gt;

Since the cells' first mass replications, they have been used by scientists in various types of investigations including disease research, [[gene mapping]], effects of toxic substances on organisms, and radiation on humans.&lt;ref name = "Smith_2002" /&gt; Additionally, HeLa cells have been used to test human sensitivity to tape, glue, cosmetics, and many other products.&lt;ref name="vpbio"/&gt;

==History==
===Origin===
The cells were propagated by [[George Otto Gey]] shortly before Lacks died of her cancer in 1951. This was the first human cell line to prove successful [[in vitro]], which was a scientific achievement with profound future benefit to medical research. Gey freely donated these cells along with the tools and processes that his lab developed to any scientist requesting them simply for the benefit of science. Neither Lacks nor her family gave permission to harvest the cells but, at that time, permission was neither required nor customarily sought.&lt;ref&gt;Washington, Harriet "Henrietta Lacks: An Unsung Hero", Emerge Magazine, October 1994&lt;/ref&gt; The cells were later commercialized, although never patented in their original form. There was no requirement at that time (or at present) to inform patients or their relatives about such matters because discarded material or material obtained during surgery, diagnosis, or therapy was the property of the physician or the medical institution. This issue and Lacks' situation were brought up in the [[Supreme Court of California]] case of ''[[Moore v. Regents of the University of California]]''. The court ruled that a person's discarded tissue and cells are not his or her property and can be commercialized.&lt;ref name="Immortal Life"&gt;{{cite book | last = Skloot | first = Rebecca | authorlink = Rebecca Skloot | title = The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks | publisher = Crown/Random House | location = New York | year = 2010 | isbn = 978-1-4000-5217-2|ref=harv| title-link = The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At first, the HeLa cell line was said to be named after a "Helen Lane" or "Helen Larson.”&lt;ref name="vpbio"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "smithsonian"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Zielinski |first1=Sarah |title=Cracking the code of the human genome – Henrietta Lacks' 'immortal' cells |url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/henrietta-lacks-immortal-cells-6421299/ |publisher=Smithsonian |accessdate=2017-05-27 |date=2010-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in the 1970s the Lacks family was contacted by researchers trying to find out why the HeLa cells had contaminated other cell lines in laboratories.&lt;ref name=RitterSeattleTimes&gt;{{cite news |last=Ritter |first=Malcolm |title=Feds, family reach deal on use of DNA information |url=http://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/feds-family-reach-deal-on-use-of-dna-information/ |accessdate=2017-05-27 |newspaper=[[Seattle Times]] |date=August 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; These cells are treated as cancer cells, as they are descended from a biopsy taken from a visible lesion on the cervix as part of Lacks' diagnosis of cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=del Carpio|first1=Alexandra |title=The Good, the Bad, and the HeLa |url=http://berkeleysciencereview.com/article/good-bad-hela/ |publisher=Berkeley Science Review |accessdate=2017-05-27 |date=April 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

HeLa cells, like other cell lines, are termed [[Cell culture#Concepts in mammalian cell culture|"immortal"]] in that they can divide an unlimited number of times in a laboratory cell culture plate as long as fundamental cell survival conditions are met (''i.e.,'' being maintained and sustained in a suitable environment). There are many [[Strain (biology)|strain]]s of HeLa cells as they continue to mutate in [[cell culture]]s, but all HeLa cells are descended from the same tumor cells removed from Lacks. The total number of HeLa cells that have been propagated in cell culture far exceeds the total number of cells that were in Henrietta Lacks' body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Sharrer T | title = "HeLa" Herself | journal = [[The Scientist (magazine)|The Scientist]] | volume = 20 | issue = 7 | page = 22 | year = 2006 | url = http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/24114/title/-HeLa--Herself/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Use in research===
HeLa cells were used by [[Jonas Salk]] to test the first [[polio vaccine]] in the 1950s. They were observed to be easily infected by [[poliomyelitis]], causing infected cells to die.&lt;ref name="Scherer1953"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Studies on the Propagation in Vitro of Poliomyelitis Viruses: Iv. Viral Multiplication in a Stable Strain of Human Malignant Epithelial Cells (Strain HeLa) Derived from an Epidermoid Carcinoma of the Cervix |journal=Journal of Experimental Medicine |volume=97 |issue=5 |year=1953 |pages=695–710 |doi=10.1084/jem.97.5.695 |pmid=13052828 |last1=Scherer |first1=W.F. |last2=Syverton |first2=J.T. |last3=Gey |first3=G.O. |pmc=2136303}}&lt;/ref&gt; This made HeLa cells highly desirable for polio vaccine testing since results could be easily obtained. A large volume of HeLa cells were needed for the testing of Salk's polio vaccine, prompting the [[National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis]] (NFIP) to find a facility capable of mass-producing HeLa cells.&lt;ref name="pmid12001993"&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Masters |first1=John R. |title=HeLa cells 50&amp;nbsp;years on: The good, the bad and the ugly |journal=Nature Reviews Cancer |volume=2 |issue=4 |year=2002 |pages=315–319 |doi=10.1038/nrc775 |pmid=12001993}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the spring of 1953, a cell culture factory was established at [[Tuskegee University]] to supply Salk and other labs with HeLa cells.&lt;ref name="Turner2012"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Turner |first1=Timothy |title=Development of the Polio Vaccine: A Historical Perspective of Tuskegee University's Role in Mass Production and Distribution of HeLa Cells |journal=Journal of Health Care for the Poor and Underserved |volume=23 |issue=4a |year=2012 |pages=5–10 |doi=10.1353/hpu.2012.0151|pmid=23124495 |pmc=4458465 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Less than a year later, Salk's vaccine was ready for human trials.&lt;ref name="Brownlee1955"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Brownlee |first1=K. A. |title=Statistics of the 1954 Polio Vaccine Trials* |journal=Journal of the American Statistical Association |volume=50 |issue=272 |year=1955|pages=1005–1013 |doi=10.1080/01621459.1955.10501286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

HeLa cells were also the first human cells to be successfully cloned in 1953 by [[Theodore Puck]] and [[Philip I Marcus]] at the University of Colorado, Denver.&lt;ref name=Puck_Marcus_1955_07/&gt; Since that time, HeLa cells have "continually been used for research into cancer, AIDS, the effects of radiation and toxic substances, gene mapping, and countless other scientific pursuits."&lt;ref name = "Smith_2002" /&gt; According to author [[Rebecca Skloot]], by 2009, "more than 60,000&amp;nbsp;scientific articles had been published about research done on HeLa, and that number was increasing steadily at a rate of more than 300&amp;nbsp;papers each month."&lt;ref name="Immortal Life"/&gt;

HeLa cells have been used in testing how [[Parvovirus|parvo virus]] infects cells of humans, HeLa, dogs, and cats.&lt;ref name=Parker&gt;{{cite journal |last=Parker |first=J |author2=Murphy W |author3=Wang D |author4=O'Brien S |author5=Parrish C |title=Canine and feline parvoviruses can use human or feline transferrin receptors to bind, enter, and infect cells |journal=Journal of Virology |year=2001 |volume=75 |issue=8 |pages=3896–3902 |doi=10.1128/JVI.75.8.3896-3902.2001 |pmid=11264378 |pmc=114880}}&lt;/ref&gt; These cells have also been used to study viruses such as the [[oropouche virus]] (OROV). OROV causes the disruption of cells in culture, where cells begin to degenerate shortly after they are infected, causing [[viral induction of apoptosis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Acrani, G.O. |author2=Gomes, R. |author3=Proença-Módena, J.L. |author4=da&amp;nbsp;Silva, A.F. |author5=Carminati, P.O. |author6=Silva, M.L. |author7=Santos, R.I. |author8=Arruda, E. |year=2010 |title=Apoptosis induced by Oropouche virus infection in HeLa cells is dependent on virus protein expression |journal=Virus Research |volume=149 |issue=1 |pages=56–63 |doi=10.1016/j.virusres.2009.12.013 |pmid=20080135 }}&lt;/ref&gt; HeLa cells have been used to study the expression of the [[Human papillomavirus|papillomavirus]] E2 and apoptosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Hou, S.Y. |author2=Wu, S. |author3=Chiang, C. |pmid=12239214 |year=2002 |title=Transcriptional activity among high and low risk human papillomavirus E2 proteins correlates with E2 DNA binding |volume=277 |issue=47 |pages=45619–45629 |doi=10.1074/jbc.M206829200 |journal=The Journal of Biological Chemistry }}&lt;/ref&gt; HeLa cells have also been used to study [[canine distemper]] virus' ability to induce [[apoptosis]] in cancer cell lines,&lt;ref name=DelPuerto/&gt; which could play an important role in developing treatments for tumor cells resistant to radiation and chemotherapy.&lt;ref name=DelPuerto&gt;{{cite journal |author1=del&amp;nbsp;Puerto, H.L. |author2=Martins, A.S. |author3=Milsted, A. |author4=Souza-Fagundes, E.M. |author5=Braz, G.F. |author6=Hissa, B. |author7=Andrade, L.O. |author8=Alves, F. |author9=Rajão, D.S. |author10=Leite, R.C. |author11=Vasconcelos, A.C. |title=Canine distemper virus induces apoptosis in cervical tumor derived cell lines |journal=Virol.

HeLa cells were used to investigate the [[phytochemical]] compounds and the fundamental mechanism of the anticancer activity of the ethanolic extract of mango peel (EEMP). EEMP was found to contain various phenolic compounds and to activate death of human cervical malignant HeLa cells through [[apoptosis]], which suggests that EEMP may help to prevent cervical cancer as well as other types of cancers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Hyeonji Kim |author2=Hana Kim |author3=Ashik Mosaddik |author4=Rajendra Gyawali |author5=Kwang Seok Ahn |author6=Somi Kim Cho |year=2012 |title=Induction of apoptosis by ethanolic extract of mango peel and comparative analysis of the chemical consists of mango peel and flesh |journal=Food Chemistry |volume=133 |issue=2 |pages=416–422 |doi=10.1016/j.foodchem.2012.01.053 |pmid=25683414 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, HeLa cells were used in tests of novel [[heptamethine dyes]] IR-808 and other analogs which are currently being explored for their unique uses in medical diagnostics, the development of [[theranostics]], the individualized treatment of cancer patients with the aid of [[Photodynamic therapy|PDT]], co-administration with other drugs, and [[irradiation]].&lt;ref name=Tan&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tan X, Luo S, Wang D, Su Y, Cheng T, Shi C| year = 2011 | title = A NIR heptamethine Dye with intrinsic cancer targeting, imaging and photosynthesizing properties | journal = Journal of Biomaterials China | volume = 33 | issue = 7| pages = 2230–2239 | doi = 10.1016/j.biomaterials.2011.11.081 | pmid=22182749 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Fpene&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Pene, F. |author2=Courtine, E. |author3=Cariou, A. |author4=Mira, J.P. |year=2009 |title=Toward theranostics |journal=Crit Care Med |volume=37 |issue=1 Suppl |pages=S50–S58 |doi=10.1097/CCM.0b013e3181921349|pmid=19104225 }}&lt;/ref&gt; HeLa cells have been used in research involving [[fullerenes]] to induce [[apoptosis]] as a part of [[photodynamic therapy]], as well as in ''in vitro'' cancer research using cell lines.&lt;ref name=foo&gt;{{cite journal |last=Briiuner. |first=Thomas |author2=Dieter F.

==Analysis==
===Telomerase===
The HeLa [[cell line]] was derived for use in [[cancer research]]. These cells proliferate abnormally rapidly, even compared to other cancer cells. Like many other cancer cells,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/2009/press.html The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 2009] on nobelprize.org&lt;/ref&gt; HeLa cells have an active version of [[telomerase]] during cell division,&lt;ref name="pmid16955216"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ivanković M, Cukusić A, Gotić I, Skrobot N, Matijasić M, Polancec D, Rubelj I | title = Telomerase activity in HeLa cervical carcinoma cell line proliferation | journal = Biogerontology | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | pages = 163–72 | year = 2007 | pmid = 16955216 | doi = 10.1007/s10522-006-9043-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which prevents the incremental shortening of [[telomere]]s that is implicated in aging and eventual cell death. In this way, the cells circumvent the [[Hayflick limit]], which is the limited number of cell divisions that most normal cells can undergo before becoming [[Senescence|senescent]].

===Chromosome number===
[[Horizontal gene transfer]] from [[human papillomavirus]]&amp;nbsp;18 (HPV18) to [[human]] cervical cells created the HeLa genome, which is different from Henrietta Lacks' genome in various ways, including its number of chromosomes. HeLa cells are rapidly dividing cancer cells, and the number of chromosomes varied during cancer formation and cell culture. The current estimate (excluding very tiny fragments) is a "hypertriploid chromosome number (3n+)" which means 76 to 80&amp;nbsp;total chromosomes (rather than the normal diploid number of 46) with 22–25 clonally abnormal chromosomes, known as HeLa signature chromosomes."&lt;ref name="pmid9892199" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Landry /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Bottomley, R.H. |author2=Trainer, A.L. |author3=Griffin, M.J. |title=Enzymatic and chromosomal characterization of HeLa variants |journal=J.

Researchers have also noted how stable these aberrant [[karyotype]]s can be:&lt;ref name="pmid9892199" /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are frequently integrated into the cellular DNA in cervical cancers. We mapped by [[Fluorescent in situ hybridization|FISH]] five HPV18 integration sites: three on normal chromosomes 8 at 8q24 and two on derivative chromosomes, der(5)t(5;22;8)(q11;q11q13;q24) and der(22)t(8;22)(q24;q13), which have chromosome 8q24 material. An 8q24 copy number increase was detected by [[comparative genomic hybridization|CGH]]. Dual-color FISH with a c-MYC probe mapping to 8q24 revealed colocalization with HPV18 at all integration sites, indicating that dispersion and amplification of the c-MYC gene sequences occurred after and was most likely triggered by the viral insertion at a single integration site. Numerical and structural chromosomal aberrations identified by SKY, genomic imbalances detected by CGH, as well as FISH localization of HPV18 integration at the c-MYC locus in HeLa cells are common and representative for advanced stage cervical cell carcinomas. The HeLa genome has been remarkably stable after years of continuous cultivation; therefore, the genetic alterations detected may have been present in the primary tumor and reflect events that are relevant to the development of cervical cancer.&lt;ref name="pmid9892199"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Macville M, Schröck E, Padilla-Nash H, Keck C, Ghadimi BM, Zimonjic D, Popescu N, Ried T | title = Comprehensive and definitive molecular cytogenetic characterization of HeLa cells by spectral karyotyping | journal = Cancer Res. | volume = 59 | issue = 1 | pages = 141–50 | year = 1999 | pmid = 9892199 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He described the whole experience with them as "powerful", saying that it brought together "''science, scientific history and ethical concerns''" in a unique way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/nature.2013.13521 |date=August 7, 2013 |title=NIH director explains HeLa agreement |last1=Callaway |first1=Ewen |journal=Nature}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contamination==
HeLa cells are sometimes difficult to control because of their adaptation to growth in tissue culture plates. Through improper maintenance, they have been known to contaminate other cell cultures in the same laboratory, interfering with biological research and forcing researchers to declare many results invalid. The degree of HeLa cell contamination among other cell types is unknown because few researchers test the identity or purity of already established cell lines. It has been demonstrated that a substantial fraction of ''[[in vitro]]'' cell lines are contaminated with HeLa cells; estimates range from 10% to 20%. [[Stanley Gartler]] (1967) and [[Walter Nelson-Rees]] (1975) were the first to publish on the contamination of various cell lines by HeLa.&lt;ref name="pmid12001993"/&gt;

Science writer Michael Gold wrote about the HeLa cell contamination problem in his book ''A Conspiracy of Cells''. He describes Nelson-Rees's identification of this pervasive worldwide problem — affecting even the laboratories of the best physicians, scientists, and researchers, including [[Jonas Salk]] — and many possibly career-ending efforts to address it. According to Gold, the HeLa contamination problem almost led to a [[Cold War]] incident. The USSR and the USA had begun to cooperate in the [[war on cancer]] launched by President [[Richard Nixon]], only to find that the exchanged cells were contaminated by HeLa. Gold contends that the HeLa problem was amplified by emotions, egos, and a reluctance to admit mistakes. Nelson-Rees explains:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
It's all human — an unwillingness to throw away hours and hours of what was thought to be good research ... worries about jeopardizing another grant that's being applied for, the hurrying to come out with a paper first. And it isn't limited to biology and cancer research. Scientists in many endeavors all make mistakes, and they all have the same problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = http://www.sunypress.edu/p-133-a-conspiracy-of-cells.aspx | title = A Conspiracy of Cells: One Woman's Immortal Legacy and the Medical Scandal It Caused | last = Gold | first = Michael | isbn = 978-0-88706-099-1| year = 1986 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Rather than focus on how to resolve the problem of HeLa cell contamination, many scientists and science writers continue to document this problem as simply a contamination issue — caused not by human error or shortcomings but by the hardiness, proliferating, or overpowering nature of HeLa.&lt;ref name="pmid16817967"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Wang H, Huang S, Shou J, Su EW, Onyia JE, Liao B, Li S |title=Comparative analysis and integrative classification of NCI60 cell lines and primary tumors using gene expression profiling data |journal=BMC Genomics |volume=7 |issue=1 |page=166 |year=2006 |pmid=16817967 |pmc=1525183 |doi=10.1186/1471-2164-7-166 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent data suggest that cross-contaminations are still a major ongoing problem with modern cell cultures.&lt;ref name="pmid20143388"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Nardone&gt;{{cite journal |author=Nardone, R.M. |title=Eradication of cross-contaminated cell lines: A call for action |journal=Cell Biology and Toxicology |volume=23 |issue=6 |pages=367–372 |year=2007 |pmid=17522957 |doi = 10.1007/s10565-007-9019-9 |url=http://www.sivb.org/publicPolicy_Eradication.pdf |archive-url= http://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20081217011516/http://www.sivb.org/publicPolicy_Eradication.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2008-12-17 |citeseerx=10.1.1.432.8581 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Taken directly from the International Cell Line Authentication Committee (ICLAC) webpage:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Regrettably, cross-contamination and misidentification are still common within the research community. Many cell lines were cross-contaminated during establishment; this means that all work using those cell lines has incorrectly used the contaminant – which may come from a different species or a different tissue. ... A cell line is considered to be misidentified if it no longer corresponds to the individual from whom it was first established. Many cases of misidentification are caused by cross-contamination, where another, faster growing, cell line is introduced into that culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://standards.atcc.org/kwspub/home/the_international_cell_line_authentication_committee-iclac_/  |title=ATCC® Standards Development Organization: The International Cell Line Authentication Committee (ICLAC) |publisher=Standards.atcc.org |accessdate=2013-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

| binomial_authority = [[Leigh Van Valen]]
}}

HeLa was described by [[Leigh Van Valen]] as an example of the contemporary creation of a new species, dubbed ''Helacyton gartleri'', due to their ability to replicate indefinitely, and their non-human number of [[chromosomes]]. The species was named after [[Stanley M. Gartler]], whom van&amp;nbsp;Valen credits with discovering "the remarkable success of this species."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mn.uio.no/cees/english/services/evolutionary-theory/volume-10/vol-10-no-2-pages-71-74-l-van-valen-and-v-c-mairorana-hela-a-new-microbial-species.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; His argument for speciation depends on these points:
*The chromosomal incompatibility of HeLa cells with humans.
*The ecological niche of HeLa cells.
*Their ability to persist and expand well beyond the desires of human cultivators.
*HeLa can be defined as a species as it has its own clonal [[karyotype]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=21666415 |year=2011 |last1=Duesberg |first1=P |last2=Mandrioli |first2=D |last3=McCormack |first3=A |last4=Nicholson |first4=JM |title=Is carcinogenesis a form of speciation? |volume=10 |issue=13 |pages=2100–2114 |journal=Cell Cycle |place=Georgetown, Texas |doi=10.4161/cc.10.13.16352}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Van&amp;nbsp;Valen proposed the new family Helacytidae and the genus Helacyton, as well as proposing a new species for HeLa cells in the same paper.&lt;ref name="ValenMaiorana"&gt;{{cite journal |title=HeLa, a new microbial species |journal=Evolutionary Theory &amp; Review |volume=10 |issn=1528-2619 |pages=71–74 |year=1991 |last1=van&amp;nbsp;Valen |first1=L.M. |last2=Maiorana |first2=V.C. |authorlink1=Leigh Van Valen }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, this proposal has not been taken seriously by other prominent evolutionary biologists, nor by scientists in other disciplines. Van Valen's argument of HeLa being a new species does not fulfill the criteria for an independent unicellular asexually reproducing species because of the notorious instability of HeLa's karyotype and their lack of a strict ancestral-descendant lineage.&lt;ref name="Cohan"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Cohan, FM |title= What are bacterial species? |journal= Annu.

In [[Sri Aurobindo]]'s philosophy the '''Intermediate zone''' refers to a dangerous and misleading transitional [[spirituality|spiritual]] state between the ordinary consciousness and true spiritual realisation.&lt;ref name="intyoga.online.fr"&gt;[http://intyoga.online.fr/intzone.htm Sri Aurobindo's Letters on Yoga - The Intermediate Zone&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Similar notions can be found in mystical literature, such as "the astral plane" and "the hall of illusion."&lt;ref&gt;http://singingmountain.org/y2004jul15.html Paul Brunton on the Intermediate Zone - The Source of Psychic Delusion and the Subtle Ego&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Theosophist]] [[William Quan Judge|W. Q. Judge]] used the similar notion of "astral intoxication".&lt;ref name="Vernal Blooms by W.Q.Judge"&gt;[http://www.theosophical.ca/VernalBlooms.htm#astral Vernal Blooms by W.Q.Judge&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aurobindo==

===Original use===
The Intermediate Zone is first described in a letter to a disciple in the early 1930s. It was then published in 1933 in ''[[The Riddle of this World]]'', a small booklet that includes several essays. The letter later appeared in ''[[Letters on Yoga]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Sri Aurobindo, ''Letters on Yoga'', Part 3, Section 3 "Experiences of the Inner and the Cosmic Consciousness", Subsection 5, Pondicherry: Sri Aurobindo Ashram&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, a number of copies have been posted on the [[Internet]].&lt;ref name="intyoga.online.fr"/&gt;&lt;ref name="greylodge.org"&gt;[http://www.greylodge.org/occultreview/glor_009/intermediate.htm Grey Lodge Occult Review :: Issue #9 :: The Intermediate Zone ::&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012141007/http://greylodge.org/occultreview/glor_009/intermediate.htm |date=2007-10-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A shorter but similar reference to a misleading intermediate consciousness, but without the distinguishing qualifier "zone", is also found in some of the later strata of ''[[The Synthesis of Yoga]]'' which dates to the early 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;Sri Aurobindo, ''The Synthesis of Yoga'', fifth edition, Pondicherry: Sri Aurobindo Ashram, {{ISBN|81-7058-615-1}} p.283 - "Another error that has to be guarded against is...to take some higher intermediate consciousness or even any kind of supernormal consciousness for the [[Supermind (Integral thought)|supermind]]. To reach supermind it is not enough to go above the ordinary movements of the human mind; it is not enough to receive a greater light, a greater power, a greater joy or to develop capacities of knowledge, sight, effective will that surpass the normal range of the [[human|human being]]. All light is not the light of the spirit, still less is all light the light of the supermind; the mind, the vital, the physical itself have lights of their own, as yet hidden, which can be very inspiring, exalting, informative, powerfully executive..." - for the date see "note on the text",  pp.915-6&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Characteristics ===
Aurobindo asserted that spiritual aspirants may pass through an intermediate zone where experiences of force, inspiration, illumination, light, joy, expansion, power, and freedom from normal limits are possible. These can become associated with personal aspirations, ambitions, notions of spiritual fulfilment and yogic siddhi, and even be falsely interpreted as full spiritual realisation. One can pass through this zone, and the associated spiritual dangers, without harm by perceiving its real nature, and seeing through the misleading experiences. Those who go astray in it may end in a spiritual disaster, or may remain stuck there and adopt some half-truth as the whole truth, or become an instrument of lesser powers of these transitional planes. According to Aurobindo, this happens to many sadhaks and yogis.&lt;ref name="intyoga.online.fr"/&gt;&lt;ref name="greylodge.org"/&gt;

==William Q. Judge - Astral intoxication==
In his posthumously published book, ''Vernal Blooms'', Theosophist [[William Quan Judge]] (1851-1896) describes the dangers of "astral intoxication". He asserts that the [[astral plane]], which is the same as that of our psychic senses, has endless powers of delusion. It has to be well understood before the student can stay there long without danger. He states that phenomena, such as astral lights, moments of peace and revelation, do not indicate spiritual advancement. To regard every picture seen in the [[astral light]] as a spiritual experience is like becoming drunk. Such indulgence only results in becoming satiated with a store of illusory appearances. True progress is dependent upon purity of motive, and conquest of known or ascertainable defects.&lt;ref name="Vernal Blooms by W.Q.Judge"/&gt;

==Paul Brunton==
[[Paul Brunton]] included Sri Aurobindo's term of the "Intermediate Zone" as a name for a psychological and immature mystical level of delusion and subtle ego.&lt;ref&gt;''The Notebooks of Paul Brunton'' (Published in 1989; 16 volumes) - Volume 11: THE SENSITIVES - ch.12. THE INTERMEDIATE ZONE - online text at {{cite web |url=http://wisdomsgoldenrod.org/notebooks/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-04-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080317054907/http://wisdomsgoldenrod.org/notebooks/ |archivedate=2008-03-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brunton uses several terms, such as astral plane, the intermediate zone, the hall of illusion. Once there, egoism becomes stimulated by the subtle forces they have evoked, the emotional nature becomes more sensitive and more fluid, the imaginative power becomes more active and is less restrained. If a person then falls victim to spiritual error regarding this state, the result is swollen vanity, superstitious credulity, emotions run riot, and wild imagination. Brunton considered this a major factor in explaining the human wreckage found on the spiritual path.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wisdomsgoldenrod.org/notebooks/16/12 The Intermediate Zone - Notebooks of Paul Brunton&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720012809/http://wisdomsgoldenrod.org/notebooks/16/12 |date=2008-07-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Isha Judd''' (born 1 May 1962 in [[Melbourne]], Australia) is a writer and [[spiritual teacher]] who has gained popularity in [[Latin America]].

==Educational Meditation==
Judd is the creator of a system for [[Self-knowledge (psychology)|self knowledge]] and expansion of consciousness called ''Educational Meditation''. It is a program based on a [[meditation]] technique integrated with other complementary practices. It includes a set of self-knowledge educational principles to encourage [[self development]] and nurture coexistence. Judd's Educational Foundation brought together a multidisciplinary team of professionals to design a comprehensive program covering all levels of education: [[preschool]], [[primary school|school]], [[university]], and other educational areas such as [[health]], [[psychology]], [[psychopedagogy]], [[arts]], [[communication]], [[human relations]], [[peace culture]], [[intercultural dialogue]] and [[social cohesion]]. This educational meditation technique develops universal values such as appreciation, gratitude, love and unity.

The complementary practices to promote comprehensive health include: experiencing full consciousness or being in the doing, exercise, nutrition and hydration, and the honest and open expression of thoughts and feelings.

The educational principles of self-knowledge are: happiness, peace and love are an internal experience (introspection development). Emotions are natural so one must feel and manage them properly (emotional learning development). What you focus on grows (value-based education development). The relationship with self is reflected in the relationship with others (development of responsibility).

This is how the meditation integrated with complementary practices develops the self and coexistence: by leading us to a state of inner peace and incorporating values that generate the experience of a positive behavioral change. From a theoretical and practical point of view, self-knowledge educational principles have the same effect and all the components of Educational Meditation work synergistically.

Judd works with prisoners and victims of natural disasters through her foundation.&lt;ref&gt;Kohn, R [http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/spiritofthings/climbing-everest-and-learning-to-love/3149158 "Learning To Love"], [[ABC Radio National]], 5 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, following her work in the prisons of Buenos Aires, Judd was named ''Ambassador For Peace'' in a ceremony at the Argentinean Senate.&lt;ref&gt;Cantero, N [http://smoda.elpais.com/articulos/isha-de-domadora-de-caballos-a-estrella-espiritual/388 "Isha: de domadora de caballos a estrella espiritual"], ''[[El País]]'', 14 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, she received an Honorary Degree from the ''Universidad Internacional,'' Cuernavaca, Mexico for her "humanitarian efforts and contributing to the betterment of the human condition through personal growth." &lt;ref&gt;Morales, P [http://www.diariodemorelos.com/article/recibe-isha-el-honoris-causa "Isha Receives Honorary Degree"], ''[[Diario de Morelos]]'', 29 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Japanese philosophy''' has historically been a fusion of both indigenous [[Shinto]] and continental religions, such as [[Buddhism]] and [[Confucianism]].  Formerly heavily influenced by both [[Chinese philosophy]] and [[Indian philosophy]], as with [[Mitogaku]] and [[Zen]], much modern Japanese philosophy is now also influenced by [[Western philosophy]].

==Ancient and medieval thought==
{{main|Buddhism in Japan}}

Before [[feudalism]] was firmly established in [[Japan]], [[Buddhism]] occupied the mainstream of Japanese thought. The Buddhist culture introduced politically by [[Prince Shōtoku]] is completed as the "making a country safe" thought in the [[Nara period]]. When the [[Heian period]] (794–1185) began, in substitution for the "making a country safe thought", form of esoteric Buddhism collectively known as ''[[mikkyō]]'' became widespread. However, in the late noble era when pessimism was popular due to the "belief that Buddhism will decline during the [[Three Ages of Buddhism|latter days]] of this world", the [[Pure Land]] movements spread out encouraging anticipation of a "future life" as a means to cope with desperation over "life in this world". During the [[Kamakura period]] (1185–1333) when government dominated by the [[samurai]] class began, a “new” Buddhism for the newly-risen [[Social class|class]] (samurai) appears.

===Arrival of Buddhism and early influence in Japan===
{{see also|Nanto Rikushū}}

In ancient Japan, the arrival of [[Buddhism]] closely relates the national construction and the national centralization of [[Political power|power]]. [[Prince Shōtoku]] and the Soga family fought and overcame the Mononobe family, who had handled the ancient Japanese [[religion]], and elaborated a plan for national [[governance]] based on the unification of the [[legal codes]] system and Buddhism. While cooperating with the Soga family, Prince Shōtoku, who was the regent of the [[Empress Suiko]], showed a deep understanding in "foreign" Buddhism,&lt;ref&gt;See [[Sangyo Gisho]] and [[Seventeen-article constitution]].&lt;/ref&gt; and planned to stabilize national [[politics]] through the use of Buddhism. The thought that national peace and security came through the power of Buddhism is called the "making a country safe" thought. In the [[Nara period]], in particular the times of [[Emperor Shōmu]], the Kokubun-ji temples and Kokubun-ni-ji temples were erected throughout the whole country and [[Tōdai-ji|Tōdai-ji Temple]] and the [[Daibutsu]] were erected in [[Nara, Nara|Nara]]. The Buddhist policy of the state reached its apex during the Nara period, as evidenced by [[Jianzhen]] of the [[Tang dynasty]] bringing an imperial ordination platform to Todai-ji Temple,

While Nara Buddhism followed only the "making a country safe" thought, Heian Buddhism brought not only national [[peace]] and [[security]] but also the personal worldly [[profit (economics)|profit]]. Because practitioners of Heian Buddhism frequently performed severe [[ascetic]] practices, [[incantation]]s and [[prayer]]s in the mountains, this Buddhism came to be called [[mikkyō]]. [[Kūkai]], a Buddhist monk, learned Chinese [[esoteric Buddhism]] while on a diplomatic mission to the Chinese court, and combined Japanese Buddhism with Chinese esoteric Buddhist practices to form Japanese [[Shingon Buddhism]]. [[Saichō]], a Buddhist monk who also journeyed to China, learned the practices of the Chinese [[Tendai]] sect and argued that the teachings of the [[Lotus Sutra]] should be the core of Japanese Buddhism.

By the late Heian era, the earthly focus of Heian Buddhism led Buddhist monks to declare a "sinful age" wherein the possibility of relief in this world was denied and therefore a trend of looking for reincarnation to the Buddhists' [[paradise]] after death arose. Additionally, the new thought that "Buddhism will decline during the latter days of this world" led to the rise of the [[Pure Land]] movement. This movement, spearheaded by [[Kūya]], a follower of Pure Land Buddhism, preached faith to the [[Amitābha]] and taught that all people could reach the Buddhist paradise, not just Buddhist monks.
[[File:Dharmacakra (Buddhist Wheel), Sun temple, Orissa.jpg|thumb|Dharmacakra (Buddhist Wheel) [[:Category:Buddhist symbols]]]]

===Kamakura Buddhism===
The [[Jōdo-shū|Jōdo]] faith, which affected by the Jodo sect of the late Heian period, relies on salvation through the benevolence of [[Amitābha]], and is going to be relieved by its power. [[Hōnen]], who initiated the Jodo sect of Buddhism, abandoned other ascetic practices entirely. He preached his pupils to believe in Amitabha and to earnestly pray "[[nianfo|namu-amida-butsu]]", and so they would go to the paradise. His pupil, [[Shinran]] who initiated [[Pure Land Buddhism]], thoroughly carried out Honen's teaching and preached the absolute dependence. In addition, Shinran advocated that an object of the relief of the Amitabha was a criminal who was aware of a worldly and desirous criminal oneself. [[Ippen]], who initiated the [[Jishu]] sect, began "the chanting religious dance".

As contrast with dependent [[Jōdō]] faith, [[Zen]] Buddhism attempts to be spiritually self-awakened by [[Zazen|Zen meditation]]. [[Eisai]] learned [[Rinzai]] sect in China. He gave pupils a difficult problem and he made them solving the problem, and so his pupils would be enlightened by themselves. Rinzai Zen was supported widely by the upper samurai class in the [[Kamakura period]]. [[Dōgen]] learned [[Sōtō]] sect in China.&lt;ref&gt;For a philosophical study of Dōgen's concept of language cf. Ralf Müller: [http://www.verlag-alber.de/suche/details_html?k_tnr=48610 Dōgens Sprachdenken: Historische und symboltheoretische Perspektiven] [Dōgen’s language thinking: Systematic perspectives from history and the theory of symbols], Welten der Philosophie, vol. 13. Freiburg/München: Verlag Karl Alber, 2013; reviewed by Steffen Döll in Philosophy East &amp; West Volume 65, Number 2 April 2015 636–639.&lt;/ref&gt; Oppose to Eisai, he preached enlightenment by earnest sitting meditation ([[zazen]]). Soto Zen was supported by the local samurais.

Most schools of [[Nichiren Buddhism]] (Japanese: {{lang|ja|法華系仏教}} {{transl|ja|Hokke-kei Bukkyō}}) refer to the priest and teacher [[Nichiren]] as their founding father. In his teachings he underlined the, to his mind, supremacy of the [[Lotus Sutra]]. He advocated the attainment of Buddhahood during one's lifetime and regarded his interpretation of the Buddhist teachings the correct form of practice for the Latter Day of the Law [[mappō]]. One of his major treatises is the "Rissho Ankoku Ron" (On Establishing the Correct teaching for the Peace of the Land). The chanting of the [[Mantra]] "[[Namu Myōhō Renge Kyō]]" is to this day the central practice to almost all Nichiren Buddhist schools and organisations.

==Early modern thought==
{{further|Edo period}}

Whereas the ancient and medieval thought of Japan was tied closely to [[Buddhism]], the early modern thought of Japan was mainly [[Confucianism]] or [[Neo-Confucianism]], which was designated for official study of the [[Tokugawa shogunate]]. In addition, [[rationality|rational]] Confucianism stimulated [[Kokugaku]], [[Rangaku]] and the non-official popular thought after the middle [[Edo period]].

===Confucianism===
{{main|Neo-Confucianism in Japan}}

In the [[Edo period]], [[Confucianism]] was the authorised study. Various schools of [[neo-Confucianism]] were popular.

The [[Zhu Xi]] school of neo-Confucianism respected [[family]]-like [[feudal]] social position order. [[Hayashi Razan]] assumed the Zhu Xi school of neo-Confucianism to be the theoretical basics of the [[Tokugawa shogunate]]. Through the principle of [[civilian]] [[government]], [[Yushima Seidō]] dedicating to [[Confucius]] was established. By the [[Kansei Reforms]], the Zhu Xi school of neo-Confucianism were still more strengthened and authorized by the Tokugawa shogunate. In addition, the thought of a school of the Zhu Xi school of neo-Confucianism gave big influence to the political movement advocating reverence for the [[Emperor]] and the expulsion of [[Alien (law)|foreigners]] of the late Tokugawa era.

In contrast with the Zhu Xi school of neo-Confucianism, the [[Wang Yangming]] school of neo-Confucianism respecting practical [[ethics]] consistently monitored and oppressed by the Tokugawa shogunate because of criticisms for the socio-political conditions under the Tokugawa shogunate.

The third schools of neo-Confucianism took consideration into the real intentions of original texts by [[Confucius]] and [[Mencius]]. [[Yamaga Sokō]] established his philosophy on Confucian ethics, and assumed the [[samurai]] to be the highest class. [[Itō Jinsai]] paid attention to "[[ren (Confucianism)|ren]]" of Confucius and he respected "ren" as the [[love]] for another person and "truth" as pure consideration. In addition, deriving from his substantial studies of ancient Chinese classics, [[Ogyū Sorai]] insisted that original Confucian spirit is to rule the [[world]] and to save a [[citizen]].

===Kokugaku and Rangaku===
{{main|Kokugaku|Rangaku}}

In the middle of the [[Edo period]], [[Kokugaku]], the study of ancient Japanese thought and culture, became popular against foreign ideas such as [[Buddhism]] or [[Confucianism]]. By [[Sakoku]] policy of the Tokugawa shogunate, Edo intellectuals could not have any positive contact with Western civilization, and so [[Rangaku]], Dutch learning, was the only window to the [[West]].

In the middle days of the Edo period, [[Kokugaku]] became popular while being influenced by positivist [[Confucianism]] with [[nationalism]] as a background. Kokugaku positively studied ancient Japanese thought and culture, including "[[Kojiki]]", "[[Nihon Shoki]]" and "[[Man'yōshū]]", and they aimed at excavating original moral [[culture]] of Japan which was different from Confucianism and [[Buddhism]]. [[Kamo no Mabuchi]] wrestled with the study of "Manyoshu" and called "[[masurao-buri]]" for [[masculine]] and tolerant style, and he evaluated the collection as pure and simple. Through his study of the ''Kojiki'', [[Motoori Norinaga]] argued that the essence of the [[Japanese literature]] came from "[[mono no aware]]" which was natural feelings to occur when you contacted with an object. He respected Japanese "Yamato spirit" instead of Chinese (Confucianism / Buddhism) "Kara spirit". According to him, Kokugaku should pursue Japanese old way of "[[Shinto]]". Through his study of Kokugaku, [[Hirata Atsutane]] advocated nationalistic [[State Shinto]], the obedience to the [[Emperor]] and abolition of Confucianism and Buddhism. It was a driving force to the end of the Tokugawa shogunate and the [[Meiji Restoration]].

In [[Sakoku]] period of the Edo period, there was no direct contact with the West, but, [[Rangaku]] became popular by encouraging importation of Western books translated in Chinese from China during the [[Kyōhō Reforms]]. [[Maeno Ryotaku]] and [[Sugita Genpaku]] translated Dutch "[[Kaitai Shinsho|Tafel Anatomie]]" into Japanese. Dutch learning unfolded to other Western studies such as British, French and American studies by the late Tokugawa era. The manner of "Japanese [[spirit]], Western [[civilisation]]" was completed by [[Sakuma Shōzan]]’s straightforward expression, "Eastern [[ethics]] and Western [[technology]]". Because [[Takano Chōei]] and [[Watanabe Kazan]] of the person of Dutch learning criticized Sakoku strictly, they were oppressed by the Tokugawa shogunate.

===Popular thought===
In the [[Edo period]], private schools were opened by [[samurai]]s, [[merchant]]s and scholars who played an active part. Their thoughts were criticisms for the dominant [[feudal]] order.

[[Ishida Baigan]] synthesized [[Confucianism]], [[Buddhism]] and [[Shinto]], and established practical philosophy for the masses. He recommended working hard at [[commerce]] as the effect by honesty and thrift. [[Ando Shoeki]] called nature's world the ideal society where all human beings engaged in [[farming]] and they lived self-sufficiently without artificiality. He criticized a [[lawful]] society where there were feudal [[Social class|class]] discrimination and the difference between the rich and poor. [[Ninomiya Sontoku]] insisted that people must repay the [[virtue]]s, which supported their existence, with own virtue.

==Late Modern thought==
{{further|Empire of Japan}}

While the early modern Japanese thought developed in [[Confucianism]] and [[Buddhism]], English [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and French [[human rights]] were prevalent after the [[Meiji Restoration]] rapidly affected by Western thought. From the time of [[First Sino-Japanese War|Sino-]] and [[Russo-Japanese War]]s, Japanese [[capitalism]] highly developed. [[Christianity]] and [[socialism]] developed and they tied to various social movements. In addition, [[nationalistic]] thought and study were formed while being opposed to foreign study.

===The Enlightenment and people's rights===
In the [[Meiji Restoration]], English and French [[civil society]] was introduced, in particular, [[utilitarianism]] and [[social Darwinism]] from England, and [[popular sovereignty]] of [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] from France.

The thinkers of the early Meiji period advocated British Enlightenment derived from Western civil society. They attempted to criticise Japanese traditional [[authority]] and [[feudalism]]. However they were finally in harmony with the government and accepted the [[modernization]] from the above without the radicalness&lt;!--originally: 'due to missing in radicalness'--&gt;. In 1873, [[Mori Arinori]] formed [[Meirokusha]]. The people who gathered in this cultural association had much in common with points such as regarding practical learning as important, catching human characteristics practically and assuming the form of government that accepted the conditions of a country an ideal. Mori Arinori promoted national [[education]] as Minister of Education. [[Nishi Amane]] affirmed a human behaviour based on interest. [[Katō Hiroyuki]] threw away [[natural rights]] under influence of [[social Darwinism]], and instead advocated the survival of the fittest.

[[Fukuzawa Yukichi]] who introduced British [[utilitarianism]] to Japan advocated the [[natural rights]] assumed that the [[human rights]] were given from the heaven. He considered the development of the [[civilization]] to be the development of the human spirit, and it was assumed that one's [[independence]] led to independence of one country.&lt;ref&gt;''Encouragement of learning'' (1872–76) and ''An outline of a theory of civilization (1875)''&lt;/ref&gt; Fukuzawa thought that there was the [[government]] in "sake of the convenience", and its appearance should be suitable to the culture. He said that there is no single ideal form of government. In addition, he insisted that Japan should have gone into the continent externally against the [[Great Powers]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Datsu-A Ron]]&lt;/ref&gt;

While members of [[Meirokusha]] finally advocated harmonization of the government and people, [[democracy|democratic]] thinkers absorbed radical people's [[rights]] from France and they supported national resistance and revolution verbally against the [[Meiji oligarchy]] after the [[Satsuma Rebellion]]. In 1874, [[Itagaki Taisuke]] introduced the establishment of the elected [[legislature]]. It spread nationwide as the [[Freedom and People's Rights Movement]]. [[Ueki Emori]] helped Itagaki and he drew up a radical draft. Strongly influenced from [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]], [[Nakae Chōmin]] argued for people's [[sovereignty]] and individual [[Political freedom|freedom]]. However, concerning with Japanese situation, he pointed out the importance of [[parliamentary monarchy]]. According to him, the [[Meiji Constitution|Imperial Constitution]] should be gradually revised by the [[Diet of Japan|Diet]].

From the late period of Meiji to the [[Taishō era]], a [[democracy|democratic]] trend spread as a background of bourgeois [[political consciousness]]. Its current led to political movements for safeguarding the [[Constitution]] and for the [[Direct election|popular election]]. [[Yoshino Sakuzō]] argued for party cabinet politics and popular election. He did not deeply pursue who was the sovereign but he insisted political goal aim for people's happiness and political decision aim for people's intention. [[Minobe Tatsukichi]] interpreted a sovereign as not an [[emperor]] but the [[State (polity)|state]]. According to him, an emperor just only excises his [[Political power|power]] as the highest organ under the [[Meiji Constitution]]. Although his theory was widely acknowledged at first, he was politically suppressed by the military and the rightists afterwards.

In 1911, [[Hiratsuka Raichō]] formed [[Bluestockings Journal|Seitosha]]. She asked for awakening of women's own and development of [[feminist movement]]. While [[Yosano Akiko]] denied [[gender]] difference, Raicho emphasised motherhood raising a child and she acknowledged the official aids for women to demonstrate their feminine ability. In 1920, Raicho formed a new association for women with [[Ichikawa Fusae]] and [[Oku Mumeo]]. Soon after their activities were successful in women's participating at political address, the association were broken up by an internal split. Later, Ichikawa formed a new one and continued a movement for [[female suffrage]].

===Christianity and socialism===
{{main|Christianity in Japan|Socialist thought in Imperial Japan}}

It was [[Christian]]s and [[socialist]]s who struggled with social contradictions derived from Japanese [[modernity]]. Christian social movements were active after the [[First Sino-Japanese War|Sino-]] and [[Russo-Japanese War]]s which brought [[capitalism]] and its contradiction to Japanese society. Many Japanese socialists were influenced by [[Christian humanism]], and in that point they were deeply associated with [[Christianity]].

Christianity, banned by the [[Tokugawa shogunate]], influenced many Meiji intellectuals. [[Uchimura Kanzō]] developed "two Js" to unite [[Bushido]] and Christian spirit. He believed that his calling was to serve "Japan" and "Jesus". He argued for the [[nonchurch movement]]. He challenged the [[Imperial Rescript on Education]] and spoke against the [[Russo-Japanese War]].&lt;ref&gt;''How I became a Christian'' (1895)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nitobe Inazō]] was a [[Quaker]] and attempted to unite [[Japanese culture]] and Christianity. He introduced Japanese culture abroad and he became secretary-general of the [[League of Nations]]. [[Joseph Hardy Neesima]] studied [[theology]] abroad in the United States. He established [[Doshisha University]] at Kyoto and he was engaged in Christian [[Moral character|character building]].

About the time of Sino- and Russo-Japanese wars, Japan succeeded in capitalization through the [[industrial revolution]] as soon as [[socialism]] spread against [[capitalism]]. However, the social movements were suppressed by the [[security police]] law of 1900, and finally in the [[High Treason Incident]] of 1910 socialists were pressed by the military and the [[fascist]] government&amp;nbsp; ... [[Kawakami Hajime]] wrote articles about [[poverty]] in a newspaper. He emphasized personal remodelling to solve poverty at first, however, later he became [[Marxist]] and he argued for social remodelling by social compulsion. [[Kōtoku Shūsui]] originally attempted to realize socialism through the [[Diet of Japan|Diet]], however, he became a [[trade union|unionist]] and he argued for a direct action by a [[general strike]]. He was executed as the mastermind of the high treason incident of 1910. [[Osugi Sakae]] argued for individual [[Political freedom|freedom]] using the principles of [[anarchism]] and [[Trade union|unionism]]. He was seen as a threat by the government and was assassinated by [[military police]] in the disorder following the [[1923 Great Kantō earthquake]].

===The development of Japanism===
{{main|Statism in Shōwa Japan|Kyoto School}}

The [[Age of Enlightenment]], [[Christianity]] and [[socialism]] have influenced Japanese thought since the [[Meiji Restoration]].
The emphasis on Japanese political [[culture]] and national [[tradition]] rose as a reaction against [[westernization]]. This trend has had an [[ideological]] side of legitimizing [[imperialism]] and [[militarism]]/[[fascism]].&lt;ref&gt;See also [[Total war]] and [[Pan-Asianism]].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tokutomi Sohō]] published a magazine in which he argued for [[liberal democracy]] and [[populism]] against Japanese [[westernization]]. However, he was disillusioned with the [[bourgeois]] who should play a political part in ... [[Kuga Katsunan]] regarded Japanese [[political culture]] and national [[tradition]] very highly. He aimed for restoration and enhancement of national emotion; however, he was not a narrow-minded [[nationalist]]. He criticized the military and argued for a [[parliamentary system]] of government and expansion of [[suffrage]].

After the [[Meiji Restoration]], Japanese government protected [[Shinto]] and treated it well not as a special religion but as [[State Shinto]]. The government closely related Shinto with the holy [[emperor]], and they used Shinto as a tool for their state [[governance]]. State Shinto was clearly distinguished from private sects of Shinto [[religion]]. It was a model of [[ideological]] state governance to form State Shinto and to promulgate the [[Imperial Rescript on Education]]. Meiji [[statism]] attempted to restore national sovereignty and pursued [[imperialism]] and [[colonialism]] through [[First Sino-Japanese War|Sino-]] and [[Russo-Japanese War]]s. However, its [[militaristic]] trend developed to [[ultra-nationalism]]. [[Kita Ikki]] advocated the exclusion of the [[zaibatsu]], senior statesmen and [[political parties]] and the establishment of government for direct connection with the emperor and the people.&lt;ref&gt;See [[February 26 Incident]].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Yanagita Kunio]] was at the forefront of study of Japanese [[folklore]]. He named general public who are not political leaders and [[intellectual]]s as “jomin”. Other folklorists are [[Minakata Kumagusu]], [[Yanagi Soetsu|Yanagi Muneyoshi]] and [[Orikuchi Shinobu]].

In pre-war Japan, [[German philosophy]] was eagerly studied and introduced. However, from the late [[Meiji period|Meiji]] to [[Taishō period]], [[Kyoto School]] attempted to harmonize Western thought with Eastern thought such as [[Zen Buddhism]]. [[Nishida Kitaro]] established an original thought by fusion of Zen and Western thought. His thought is called as Nishida philosophy. He insisted on pure [[experience]] in which there is no opposition between subjectivity and objectivity.&lt;ref&gt;''An inquiry into the good''&lt;/ref&gt; His [[ontology]] derived from absolute nothingness. [[Watsuji Tetsuro]] criticized Western selfish [[individualism]].&lt;ref&gt;''The significance of ethics as the study as man''&lt;/ref&gt; His [[ethics]] says human beings are not isolated [[existence]] but related existence. He insisted that individual and social beings should be aware of their own individuality and social membership. He is also well known as his ''Climate and Culture'' in which he studied the relationship between natural environment and local lifestyle.

===Contemporary Japanese philosophy===

After World War II, many academic philosophers have published books on Continental philosophy and American philosophy. Among those [[Shozo Omori]], [[Wataru Hiromatsu]], [[Yasuo Yuasa]], and [[Takaaki Yoshimoto]] created original works under the influence of [[Marxism]], [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] and [[analytic philosophy]]. Shozo Omori created a unique monist epistemology based on his concepts of "representation monism", "double depiction", and "language animism". Wataru Hiromatsu developed his theory of "multi-subjective ontological structure of the world". Yasuo Yuasa advanced a new theory of the body influenced by [[Merleau-Ponty]] and the body image found in [[Chinese medicine]]. Takaaki Yoshimoto is famous for his "shared illusion theory" and various philosophical essays on Japanese culture. Today, such scholars as [[Kojin Karatani]] ([[literary theory]]), [[Hitoshi Nagai]] ([[solipsism]]), [[Shigeki Noya]] ([[analytic philosophy]]), [[Masahiro Morioka]] ([[philosophy of life]]), and [[Motoyoshi Irifuji]] ([[analytic philosophy]]) are considered to be characteristic philosophers in the Japanese academy.&lt;ref&gt;See for example, [http://www.iwanami.co.jp/.BOOKS/09/4/092161+.html Collected works of Shozo Omori], [http://enojp.org/2015/03/26/omori-shozo-bibliography/ Shozo Omori bibliography],[https://www.iwanami.co.jp/.BOOKS/09/9/092021+.html Collected works of Wataru Hiromatsu], [http://ci.nii.ac.jp/ncid/BA44187842 Collected works of Yasuo Yuasa], [http://www.yoshimototakaaki.com/ Collected works of Takaaki Yoshimoto], [https://www.iwanami.co.jp/.BOOKS/02/9/026486+.html Collected works of Kojin Karatani]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5994">'''Johan Peter Albertus Mekkes''' (23 April 1898, [[Harderwijk]] – 26 July 1987, [[The Hague]]) was a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[philosopher]]. Having started his career as an officer in the Dutch army, he later studied law and philosophy. His active life as a publishing philosopher started around 1947. In 1949 he became a professor of philosophy at the [[University of Leiden]]. Due to a scarcity of translated works he is little known in the English-speaking world but he was influential for a number of other Dutch philosophers. He was one of the second generation of [[reformational philosophy|reformational philosophers]] arising from the [[Vrije Universiteit|Free University (VU) in Amsterdam]], after the first generation of [[Herman Dooyeweerd]] and [[D. H. Th. Vollenhoven]].  Other second generationers were:  [[Hendrik van Riessen]],  [[S. U. Zuidema]] and  [[K. J. Popma]].

==Brief outline of his thinking==

Mekkes´s philosophy is first of all characterized by his passionate attention to the individual subjective concreteness of human life even in its societal and historical relatedness. Being dissatisfied with Kant´s formalism, just as much as with the scholastic tradition seeking to hold on to the reality of some supernatural form of being, he developed an integral way of thinking in which the natural and the typically human modes of experience are equally important.

According to Mekkes, the basic shortcoming of most Western philosophical traditions is their abstractness. This has its root in the absolutization of abstractive analytical thought, as opposed to the concreteness of living persons. In response to the basic problem of human existence, philosophy has tried to find a solution via its theoretical insights. However, theory can only deal with abstractions. But the problem of human existence is not at all abstract. It is a problem of concrete, finite existence. In his concrete finiteness man lacks existential meaning. Therefore, if there is something of a solution, it is only to be found in personal concreteness. The way of supernatural religion just as much as the way of theoretical absolutization are dead-ends. So, man has to concentrate on his individual concrete subjectivity. It is there that the decision about meaning is made. But meaning appears to be a difficult something, not in the last place because man´s natural existence is finite. It being the only existence he has, the problem becomes one of love. How are we to love our reality? It is along this idea of meaning that Mekkes reads [[the Bible|Scripture]]. The Biblical way of life and experience is a finite one, full of misfortune. But it is a way of basic love. Mekkes finds these two characteristics of existence, finiteness and life-by-love, in the oldest Hebraic traditions. His hermeneutics of meaning takes us back before the beginning of all later scholasticism, without turning to what are understood today as typical Jewish traditions. Since he differs in principle from the Greek tradition of the absolutization of theory, as well as from the attempt to synthesize Greek ways of thought with Hebraic thought (scholasticism), as well as from Jewish traditions, Mekkes would seem to be tapping an original source of meaning. In fact, central in his thinking is the idea of Origin, to which we are “related” in the very core of our being. This central “relation” is beyond the grasp of our theoretical insight, for it is in fact presupposed by all theoretical activity. Our being is as such originating, and its core must be of an affective nature.

Working consistently from these basic insights, he continued to follow and discuss the developments in phenomenology and existentialism. Throughout his publications he remained in discussion, at increasingly penetrating levels, with the philosophies of Scheler, Heidegger, Jaspers, Sartre. By keeping time, subjective individuality, and the problem of meaning in the forefront of his attention, he intended to contribute to a fundamental reformation of philosophy itself.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6964">'''Julije Makanec''' (19 September 1904 – 7 June 1945{{sfn|Karaula|Miškulin|2014|p=81}}) was an ethnic [[Croats|Croatian]] politician, teacher, philosopher and writer. During World War II, he was the Minister of Education of the [[Independent State of Croatia]] and a high-ranking member of the [[Ustaše]].{{sfn|Macut|2013|p=147}} [[File:Prof. Julije pl. Makanec.jpg|thumb|Minister of Education in the Independent State of Croatia (NDH)]]

Makanec was born in [[Sarajevo]].{{sfn|Karaula|Miškulin|2014|p=81}} He was educated in [[Osijek]] and [[Bihać]], and studied philosophy at the [[University of Zagreb]], where he obtained a Ph.D. in 1927.{{sfn|Karaula|Miškulin|2014|p=81}} Between 1929 and 1940 he served as a gymnasium professor in [[Koprivnica]], [[Bjelovar]] and several other places in Croatia, as well as in [[Leskovac]], [[Serbia]].{{sfn|Karaula|Miškulin|2014|p=81}}  In November 1940, as a member of the [[Croatian Peasant Party]], he became the mayor of [[Bjelovar]].{{sfn|Macut|2013|p=149}} Here he played an important role in the [[Bjelovar rebellion]] of 8 April that year when, after the revolt by Croats in the [[Royal Yugoslav Army]] during the early days of [[invasion of Yugoslavia]], he declared the "resurrection of the Croatian state".{{sfn|Karaula|Miškulin|2014|p=81}}{{sfn|Macut|2013|p=148}}{{sfn|Yeomans|2013|p=92}} 

By his own account, Makanec swore the [[Ustaše]] oath in April 1941, days after the establishment of the [[Independent State of Croatia]], but historians believe Makanec may have joined the Ustaše much earlier, in late 1939 or early 1940.{{sfn|Macut|2013|p=149}}{{sfn|Karaula|Miškulin|2014|p=82}} Shortly after the formation of the Ustaše government he served as [[adjutant]] in the Croatian army's Bilogora headquarters, in Bjelovar.{{sfn|Macut|2013|p=152}} From 1942 he was the chief of spiritual upbringing in the Ustaša Youth. In March 1943 he was named extraordinary professor of philosophy at the [[Faculty of Philosophy in Zagreb]].{{sfn|Karaula|Miškulin|2014|p=81}} In October 1943 he became the Independent State of Croatia's Minister of National Education.{{sfn|Karaula|Miškulin|2014|p=81}} He also wrote books in his field as well as contributing to various periodicals and newspapers.{{cn|date=January 2016}}

In a 1942 brochure titled ''Ustaše Virtues'' (''Ustaške vrline''), Makanec wrote: "[...] every community has the right to exterminate, destroy, or at least render harmless those individuals who weaken it and bring it to ruin due to their utter lack of virtue."{{sfn|Jakovina|2016}}{{sfn|Macut|2013|p=156}}{{sfn|Milekic|2016}}

On 6 April 1945, shortly before [[Yugoslav Partisans]] entered Zagreb, Makanec fled the city in a group of sixteen government ministers. On 17 May, they surrendered to the British in [[Tamsweg]], Austria, and were extradited to Yugoslav authorities. After a one-day trial before a military tribunal in Zagreb on 6 June he was sentenced to death for high treason and war crimes and executed by firing squad in the morning of the following day.{{sfn|Macut|2013|p=147}}{{sfn|Karaula|Miškulin|2014|p=80}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5057">'''Knowledge neglect''' refers to cases when people fail to retrieve and apply previously stored knowledge appropriately into a current situation (Marsh, Umanath, 2014).
Perhaps the most famous example of knowledge neglect is the [[Moses]] Illusion, discovered in 1981 by Erickson and Mattson.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bredart|first=Serge|last2=Modolo|first2=Karin|date=1988-05-01|title=Moses strikes again: Focalization effect on a semantic illusion|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0001691888900091|journal=Acta Psychologica|volume=67|issue=2|pages=135–144|doi=10.1016/0001-6918(88)90009-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the illusion, participants are asked to answer the question, “How many pairs of each animal did Moses bring on his ark?” If a participant answers the question by simply saying, “2,” then this is an example of knowledge neglect because the person has failed to apply their previously learned knowledge that [[Noah]] was the individual who constructed the ark and herded the animals, not Moses. Another example would be a teacher asking the class, "Who was the main villain in [[Stephen King]]'s ''[[Harry Potter]]'' series?" Any fan of the ''Harry Potter'' series knows that [[J. K. Rowling]] authored the books, however someone might still answer this question without applying their previous knowledge about the correct author, demonstrating knowledge neglect.

A more general example of knowledge neglect can also occur, for instance, when someone is rehearsing lines for a play and then forgets some of the lines while they are performing. The lines were available to the person in their memory but that person failed to access or retrieve them from their memory and use them for the situation, also demonstrating knowledge neglect.

==Hypothesis for cause==

One possible reason that people fall victim to knowledge neglect is because people tend to have a truth bias, meaning that people tend to believe that the information they hear is true. With the truth bias, people are inclined to believe that plausible information is true, regardless of the source of such information or their own prior knowledge. For this reason, individuals may fall victim to knowledge neglect simply because they aren't expecting that what they are being told or reading about will be incorrect.

Knowledge neglect could also be explained by the idea that people's attention is often fragmented, and that their cognitive ability is being used to examine the meaning of what they are reading or hearing about, rather than detecting errors in validity. For example, while reading stories or detecting/answering distorted questions, the participant is doing a lot and may not have the processing resources available to assess whether or not the information is true (Marsh, Umanath 2014). The reader of a story is processing a plot line, keeping track of characters, and more generally, building a mental model of the text (e.g., Bower &amp; Morrow, 1990; Johnson‐ Laird, 1983); catching contradictions with stored knowledge is thus, not the main focus of the reader (Marsh, Umanath 2014).

The simple fact of believing something when it is presented to you is common. This can be a significant cause for knowledge neglect. When something is believed, the meaning is represented, coded, or presented in a mental system and usually is treated as if it is true (Gilbert 1991). If you have no prior knowledge about a subject when you encode it and you believe such information to be true, you are more likely to retrieve this information at a later time believing it is true, putting you at risk for knowledge neglect.

'''Kurt Spellmeyer''' is a [[Zen teacher]] and professor in the English Department  at Rutgers University.

== Zen lineage ==
Kurt Spellmeyer, Kankan Roshi, trained with Takabayashi Genki and Kangan Glenn Webb, founders of the Seattle Zen Center. In 1985, Spellmeyer completed his training under Webb Roshi and was authorized to teach. He received the [[dharma name]] Kankan (Ch. Guan Han, “Sees the Cold”), at a private ceremony with Webb in 1991.

Kankan Roshi has practiced [[Zazen|Zen meditation]] for 40 years. He has directed the Cold Mountain [[Sangha]]  since 1994, and supports himself by working as a professor in the English Department at [[Rutgers University]] in New Brunswick, New Jersey. The Cold Mountain (Kanzan) lineage of '''''Rinzai Zen''''' can be traced back to the [[Hanshan Temple|Han Shan Temple]] in [[Suzhou]], China.

==Scholar, author and teacher==
Professor Spellmeyer is the author of ''Arts of Living: Reinventing the Humanities for the Twenty-first Century'' (SUNY Press, 2003), ''The New Humanities Reader'' (Houghton-Mifflin, 2002), and ''Common Ground: Dialogue, Understanding, and the Teaching of Composition'' (Prentice Hall, 1992), which won the Ross Winterowd Award in 1993.  In ''Arts of Living'', Spellmeyer asks readers to separate the explicit content of academic knowledge from the way that this knowledge helps perpetuate enduring forms of structural inequality.  While he is quite critical of conservative elitists like Allan Bloom, he also takes aim at some self-professed "leftists" whose exclusionary discourses claim an oppositional status but also function as cultural capital reinforcing class distinctions of the kind described by Pierre Bourdieu.  The spectacle of Yale-educated Marxists lecturing the mystified children of truckers and secretaries about their interpellation can be seen, Spellmeyer argues, as an example of the academy's own unacknowledged imbrication in ideology. Although Spellmeyer's research has been influenced by sociologists like Bourdieu, Charles Derber and others, he is particularly indebted to Barbara and John Ehrenreich's work on the rise of "new class"—the professional-managerial elite, including academics, who have become the core of the Democratic Party, displacing a working class constituency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.alternet.org/economy/barbara-and-john-ehrenreich-real-story-behind-crash-and-burn-americas-managerial-class?page=0,0|title=Barbara and John Ehrenreich: The Real Story Behind the Crash and Burn of America's Managerial Class|first1=Barbara|last1=Ehrenreich|first2=John|last2=Ehrenreich|date=19 February 2013|website=Alternet.org|accessdate=18 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Ehrenreichs' thesis has been given new life more recently by Thomas Piketty in the essay "Brahmin Left Versus Merchant Right: Rising Inequality and the Changing Structure of Political Conflict."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://piketty.pse.ens.fr/files/Piketty2018.pdf|format=PDF|title=Brahmin Left vs Merchant Right : Rising Inequality &amp; the Changing Structure of Political Conflict (Evidence from France, Britain and the US, 1948-2017)|author=John Piketty|website=Piketty.pse.ens.fr|accessdate=18 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a review of ''Arts of Living'', one critic had this to say:

Not everyone who reads Spellmeyer's text will agree wholeheartedly; as
John Brereton states in his blurb, it's “guaranteed to be controversial.” And, rightly
so. Spellmeyer has few kind words for critical theorists, contending that critique is
an illusion by which we only change our ideas when we should be seeking to change
actual lives. Even if one does not agree with parts or most of his arguments, Arts of
Living, I believe, is an important read for every humanities scholar and teacher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.uc.edu/content/dam/uc/journals/composition-studies/docs/bookreviews/33-1/brunk_chavez.pdf|format=PDF|title=Arts of Living: Reinventing the Humanities for the Twenty-first Century, by Kurt Spellmeyer. Albany: State University of New York Press, 2003. 312 pages : Reviewed by Beth Brunk-Chavez, The University of Texas at El Paso|website=Uc.edu|accessdate=18 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spellmeyer has also published articles on theories of composition/rhetoric, critical theory, and the sociology of knowledge and of academic institutions, in journals that include ''College English'', ''College Composition and Communication'', ''The Journal of Advanced Composition'', ''Pedagogy'', ''Transformations'', and ''Religion and the Arts''. In 2004, he received Rutgers' Teacher-Scholar Award for outstanding contributions to the scholarship on teaching.

Since 1985, Spellmeyer has served as Director of the School of Arts and Sciences Writing Program, a recipient of Rutgers' President's Award for Programmatic Excellence in 2000. The Writing Program at Rutgers, which offers courses at all levels from developmental writing to advanced writing for the sciences and the professions, currently serves 17,000 each year and employs roughly 250 faculty.

His latest book is ''Buddha at the Apocalypse: Awakening from a Culture of Destruction'' (Wisdom Publications, 2010).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/0861715829|title=Buddha at the Apocalypse: Awakening from a Culture of Destruction|author=Robert Thurman|date=20 April 2010|publisher=Wisdom Publications|accessdate=18 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This article lists people who are known to have parented the most number of children.

==Female and monogamous couples==
This section lists females who gave birth to at least 20 children. Numbers in '''bold''' and ''italics'' are likely to be inexact, some of them having been recorded before the 19th century. Due to the fact that females bear the children and therefore cannot reproduce as often as males, their records are often shared with or exceeded by their partners.

|Vassilyev and his first wife are alleged to hold the record for the most children a couple has parented. She gave birth to a total of 69 children – sixteen pairs of twins, seven sets of triplets and four sets of quadruplets – between 1725 and 1765, in a total of 27 [[childbirth|births]]. 67 of the 69 children were said to have survived infancy. Allegedly Vassilyev also had six sets of twins and two sets of triplets with a second wife, for another 18 children in eight births; he fathered a total of 87 children. The claim is disputed.

|Mrs. and Mr. Yakov Kirillov
|The first wife of peasant Yakov Kirillov from the village of Vvedensky, Russia, gave birth to 57 children in a total of 21 [[childbirth|births]]. She had four sets of quadruplets, seven sets of triplets and ten sets of twins. All of the children were alive in 1755, when Kirillov, aged 60, was presented at court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Oleksandr Oleksandrovych Bohomolet︠s︡ʹ| title = The Prolongation of Life| url = https://books.google.com/?id=N5c_AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA6| year = 1946| publisher = Duell, Sloan &amp; Pearce| accessdate = 2016-08-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|6}} As with the Vassilyev case, the truth of these claims has not been established, and is highly improbable.

|Barbara and Adam Stratzmann
|It is claimed that Barbara Stratzmann (c. 1448 – 1503) of [[Bönnigheim]], Germany, gave birth to 53 children (38 sons and 15 daughters) in a total of 29 [[childbirth|births]] by 1498. She had one set of septuplets, one set of sextuplets, four sets of triplets and five sets of twins. Nineteen of the children were stillborn, the eldest surviving was eight&amp;nbsp;years old in 1498.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Probst| first = Ernst| title = Superfrauen. 11. Feminismus und Familie| year = 2001| isbn = 978-3-935718-03-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As with the Vassilyev and Kirillov cases above, the survival of any one of the offspring of the alleged multiple births is questionable, as is the likelihood of so many multiple births in an era before fertility drugs.

{{Buddhism}}

'''Maha Kasyapa''' or '''Mahākāśyapa''' ([[Pali language|Pali]]: ''Mahākassapa'') or Kāśyapa was one of [[The ten principal disciples|the principal disciples]] of [[Gautama Buddha]]. He came from the kingdom of [[Magadha]]. He became an [[arahant]] and was the disciple of the Buddha who was foremost in ascetic practice.

Mahākāśyapa assumed the leadership of the Sangha following the death of the Buddha, presiding over the [[First Buddhist council|First Buddhist Council]]. He is considered to be the first patriarch in a number of Mahayana School [[Lineage (Buddhism)|dharma lineages]]. In the [[Theravada]] tradition, he is considered to be the Buddha's third foremost disciple, surpassed only by the chief disciples [[Sariputta]] and [[Maudgalyayana|Maha Moggallana]].

==In early Buddhism==
Mahākāśyapa is one of the most revered of the Buddha's entire disciples, foremost in ascetic practices. He is often depicted in statuary together with [[Ananda]], each standing to one side of the Buddha.

==In the ''Lotus Sutra''==
In ''[[Lotus Sutra]]'' Chapter 6 (Bestowal of Prophecy), the Buddha bestows prophecies of enlightenment on the disciples Mahākāśyapa, [[Subhuti]], [[Katyayana (Buddhist)|Maha Katyayana]], and [[Maudgalyayana|Maudgalyāyana]].

==In Zen Buddhism==
[[File:Mahakashyapa.JPG|thumb|Traditional Chinese illustration of Mahākāśyapa from a woodblock print]]
[[File:Pipphali.jpg|thumb|Pipphali Cave in [[Rajgir]], where Maha Kassappa is recorded to have stayed.]]
According to [[Zen]] tradition,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Suzuki|first=Daisetz|title=Essays in Zen Buddhism|year=1961|publisher=Grove Press|isbn=0802151183|page=60}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mahākāśyapa was the first to receive [[Dharma transmission]] from Gautama.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sweepingzen.com/dharma-transmission |title=Dharma Transmission |accessdate=June 7, 2012 |publisher=Sweeping Zen }}&lt;/ref&gt; Zen purports to lead its adherents to insights akin to that mentioned by the Buddha in the ''[[Flower Sermon]]'', in which he held up a white flower and just admired it in his hand. All the other disciples just looked on without knowing how to react, but Mahākāśyapa smiled faintly, and Śākyamuni Buddha picked him as one who truly understood him and was worthy to be his successor.&lt;ref name="dl-gamma.tccd.edu"&gt;[http://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20070614122021/http://dl-gamma.tccd.edu/academic/booklets/sp07/PHIL_1304.pdf Great religions of the world. Center for Distance Learning. Tarrant County College District]&lt;/ref&gt; (This can be explained thus: Mahākāśyapa's spiritual attainment had reached the point where he could understand the hidden meanings conveyed by the Buddha's act, as two people who have gone through the same experiences understand each other completely.) He then said, "I possess the true Dharma eye, the marvelous mind of Nirvana, the true form of the formless, the subtle dharma gate that does not rest on words or letters but is a special transmission outside the scriptures. This I entrust to Mahākāśyapa."&lt;ref name="Zen Buddhism 2005. page 9"&gt;Zen Buddhism: A History (India &amp; China) By [[Heinrich Dumoulin]]. Translated by James W. Heisig, Paul F. Knitter. Contributor John McRae. Published 2005. [[World Wisdom]], Inc. Religion / World. Religions. 387 pages. {{ISBN|0-941532-89-5}}. page 9&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, a way within Buddhism developed which concentrated on direct experience rather than on rational creeds or revealed scriptures. Zen is a method of meditative religion which seeks to enlighten people in the manner that Mahākāśyapa experienced.&lt;ref name="dl-gamma.tccd.edu"/&gt;

In the ''[[Song of Enlightenment]]'' (證道歌 ''Zhèngdào gē'') of [[Yongjia Xuanjue]] (665-713)&lt;ref&gt;Chang, Chung-Yuan (1967). [http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-PHIL/ew27057.htm "Ch'an Buddhism: Logical and Illogical".]&lt;/ref&gt;—one of the chief disciples of [[Huineng|Huìnéng]], the 6th patriarch of Chan Buddhism—it is written that Bodhidharma was the 28th patriarch in a line of descent from Mahākāśyapa, a disciple of [[Gautama Buddha|Śākyamuni Buddha]], and the first patriarch of Chan Buddhism:

:Mahākāśyapa was the first, leading the line of transmission;
:Twenty-eight Fathers followed him in the West;
:The Lamp was then brought over the sea to this country;
:And Bodhidharma became the First Father here:
:His mantle, as we all know, passed over six Fathers,
:And by them many minds came to see the Light.&lt;ref&gt;[[D. T. Suzuki]] (1948). ''[http://consciouslivingfoundation.org/ebooks/new2/ManualOfZenBuddhism-manzen.pdf Manual Of Zen Buddhism]'', 50.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Chinese culture==
Mahākāśyapa is called 大迦葉(da jia she) or 摩诃迦葉(mo he jia she) in Chinese，摩诃 is a transliteration of Mahā, means big, great, mega, also is written as 大(da，means big, great). According to Chinese legend, the monk [[Ji Gong]](Chinese：濟公) is a reincarnation of Mahākāśyapa (known as the Taming Dragon [[arhat]]).

==In Pali==

In one prophecy, his disciples are contemptuous of Mahākāśyapa, whose head is no larger than an insect to them. Gautama Buddha's robe would barely cover two of their fingers, making them wonder how tiny Gautama Buddha was. Mahākāśyapa is said to be small enough in comparison to cremate in the palm of [[Maitreya]]'s hand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Relics of the Buddha|author=John S.

'''Mathurin Jacques Brisson''' (30 April 1723 &amp;ndash; 23 June 1806) was a [[France|French]] [[zoologist]] and [[natural philosophy|natural philosopher]].

Brisson was born at [[Fontenay-le-Comte]]. The earlier part of his life was spent in the pursuit of [[natural history]], his published works in this field included ''Le Règne animal'' (1756) &lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books/about/Le_Regne_Animal_Divise_En_IX_Classes.html?id=fVlESwAACAAJ Google Books] La Regne Animal.&lt;/ref&gt; and the highly regarded ''Ornithologie'' (1760).&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | last=Brisson | first=Mathurin Jacques | author-link=Mathurin Jacques Brisson | year=1760 | title=Ornithologie, ou, Méthode contenant la division des oiseaux en ordres, sections, genres, especes &amp; leurs variétés | volume= (Volumes 1-6 and Supplement) | language=French, Latin | place=Paris | publisher=Jean-Baptiste Bauche | doi=10.5962/bhl.title.51902 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mezri Haddad''' (born 2 July 1961 in [[Le Kram]]) is a Tunisian journalist, writer, philosopher and diplomat.
Haddad was a doctor of moral and political philosophy at the [[Paris-Sorbonne University]], and the first Muslim candidate to be qualified by the National Council of French universities as a lecturer in Catholic theology.{{sfn|Mezri Haddad ... Réalités 2009|p=14}}
He is the author of several essays that focus on politics and religion (Islam and Christianity).

He regularly contributes to the press in France (''[[Le Figaro]]'', ''[[Libération]]'' and ''[[Le Monde]]''), Belgium (''[[Le Soir]]'') and Switzerland (''[[Tribune de Genève]]'') and has made several appearances on [[France 24]], [[La Chaîne Info|LCI]], [[Public Sénat]], [[France Ô]] and [[France 2]]. He was also, from 2007 to 2009, co-director of the Daedalos Institute of Geopolitics, a think tank based in [[Nicosia]] created at the initiative of the Cypriot Ministry of Foreign Affairs.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}
In late 2009 he was appointed ambassador to [[UNESCO]], a post he resigned in January 2011 before the fall of [[Zine El Abidine Ben Ali]].

==Youth==

===Birth and early years===

Mezri Haddad was born in [[Le Kram]], in the northern suburbs of [[Tunis]].
His father came from [[Monastir, Tunisia|Monastir]].
He spent his childhood and early adolescence in Le Kram in a middle-class family. 
His father Mohamed, a trade unionist and first-generation activist of the [[Neo Destour]] party,  belonged to the resistance network in the [[Menzel Bourguiba]] region.
He was a turner-fitter at the thermal power plant [[La Goulette]]. His mother, a native of [[Mateur]], was a seamstress.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

After secondary studies in high school in La Goulette, in 1979 Mezri Haddad became a journalist.
He signed his first article as "A very angry young Tunisian" in ''[[La Presse de Tunisie]]''.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}
It was three years before he signed his second article, "The Wassila effect" in ''[[Jeune Afrique]]''.
He violently criticized the first lady of Tunisia, at the time an untouchable person.{{sfn|Mezri Haddad|1982}}
Arrested and then pardoned, he began a career in journalism in the official press with a brief passage in the journal ''Dialogue'' and then the daily ''[[L'Action tunisienne]]'', from which he was dismissed due to incompatibility with the spirit of this newspaper, the official organ of the ruling [[Socialist Destourian Party]].{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

Haddad obtained a position with the cultural and artistic magazine of ''[[Établissement de la Radiodiffusion-Télévision Tunisienne]]'' but resigned in January 1984 during the [[Tunisian bread riots]] and left Tunisia for France. He wrote three years later in ''Le Temps'' that he felt he had no future in the country.&lt;ref&gt;''Le Temps'', 28 November 1987&lt;/ref&gt;
He enrolled at the Sorbonne to study philosophy. In 1987, the year when President [[Zine El Abidine Ben Ali]] came to power, Mezri Haddad, long opposed to the Bourguiba regime, had reservations about the nature of the new regime and warned the against general unanimous support and personality cult.&lt;ref&gt;''Réalités'', 14 November 1987&lt;/ref&gt;

===Higher education===

In 1987 Haddad obtained his ''[[Diplôme d'études universitaires générales]]'' in Philosophy, and a [[Licentiate (degree)|Licentiate]] in 1988. 
He then enrolled in sociology and studied under professors [[Raymond Boudon]], [[François Bourricaud]] and Bernard Valade. 
In parallel, he participated for three years in [[Dominique Chevallier]]'s seminar on the history of the Arab world.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}
In 1989, the year of the fall of the Berlin Wall, he defended his moral and political philosophy masters thesis, entitled "The communist ideology and Islamism: analysis and perspectives", in which he demonstrated the points of convergence between red  (communism) and green (Islamist theocracy) totalitarianism.
In an article published in Le Monde on 25 April 2009 Mezri Haddad denounced "green fascism".{{sfn|Mezri Haddad|2009}}

In 1990 Haddad obtained his [[Master of Advanced Studies]] degree on the theme of "Historical materialism and class struggles in Karl Marx."{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}
The same year he started his thesis for a doctorate in moral and political philosophy under the direction of [[Claude Polin]]. 
"The issue of the relationship between spiritual authority and temporal power in Islam and in Christianity" was the topic of his 982-page theses which he defended in 1997.{{sfn|Mezri Haddad|1997}}
According to the jury, by its comparative and multidisciplinary approach Haddad shows that political theology is the biggest problem of all religions and all cultures.
The "theocratic disease" is therefore not specifically Islamic.{{sfn|Mezri Haddad|1997}}
According to [[Mohammed Arkoun]], "by its resolutely comparative and heuristic approach" Mezri Haddad's thesis "is a first in the field of comparative studies of Islam studies and theology that revives the high tradition of philosophical orientalism".{{sfn|Arkoun|1992}}

==Professional career==

===Journalist===

After his first efforts in the press of the Destour Socialist Party, and once installed in France, for a long time he was permanent correspondent of the Tunisian magazine ''Realities''. 
He became editor and columnist until his resignation in 1992 for restrictions on his freedom of expression. 
He nevertheless continued his fight in the French press and in 1992 signed his first article in ''[[Libération]]'' about the "[[Couscous connection]]".{{sfn|Mezri Haddad|1992}}
According to the Canadian writer Lise Garon, "Haddad is probably the only Tunisian to have signed an article about the involvement of the president's brother in international drug trafficking."{{sfn|Garon|1998|p=72}}
Also according to Lise Garon, "Haddad, who signs his articles in European newspapers with his real name, remains an exceptional case. In general Tunisian newspapers have sided with the general-president."{{sfn|Garon|1998|p=73}}

In 1994 Mezri Haddad was the only Tunisian to support the presidential candidacy of his friend [[Moncef Marzouki]] in the [[Tunisian general election, 1994|Tunisian general election]] through an article in the French daily ''Libération'' of 23 March 1994.{{sfn|Mezri Haddad|1994}}
According to [[Reporters Without Borders]] this edition of the newspaper was banned in Tunisia due to Haddad's article, which condemned the lack of democratic process in his country.{{sfn|Reporters sans frontières|1995|p=395}}
The 29 March 1995 edition of ''Libération'' was also suppressed in Tunisia due to an article by Haddad that attacked the dictators who collaborated in suppressing the freedom of the people.{{sfn|Reporters sans frontières|1996|p=443}}

=== University===
Between 1989 and 1993 Haddad served as assistant to Professor Jacqueline Brisset at [[Panthéon-Assas University]] – Paris II in philosophy of law and the history of political ideas. 
From 1991 to 1992 [[Pierre Aubenque]], a specialist in Aristotle, employed him as a researcher at the Center for Research on Ancient Thought, a laboratory associated with the ''[[Centre national de la recherche scientifique]]'' (CNRS).{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

From 1999 to 2001 Haddad was a researcher at the Center for the History of Arab and Medieval Sciences and Philosophies, a laboratory directed by Roschdi Rasched and associated with CNRS. 
At the same time he taught history as an ''[[Attaché Temporaire d'Enseignement et de Recherche]]'' (Temporary assistant for teaching and research) at [[Paris Diderot University]] – Paris VII, assigned to the training and research unit for "Geography and Social Sciences." From 2003 to 2005 he was a temporary teacher at [[HEC Paris]] with a seminar called "Religions and Cultures".{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

==Political activities==

Early on, Mezri Haddad distanced himself from the regime of President [[Zine El Abidine Ben Ali]]. 
In 1989 he reiterated his criticism of the unanimity and the personality cult that the regime of [[Habib Bourguiba]] had already introduced.&lt;ref&gt;''Réalités'', 11 April 1989&lt;/ref&gt;
Between 1989 and 1991 he was one of the few intellectuals to openly challenge the authoritarian drift of the regime in the Tunisian press.&lt;ref&gt;''Réalités'', 5 July 1991&lt;/ref&gt;
He called for dialogue with the opposition, respect for human rights and the opening of democracy.{{sfn|Mezri Haddad|1995b}}
Forbidden to speak in Tunisia, he continued his fight in the daily ''Libération''.{{sfn|Mezri Haddad|1995}}
This was the only newspaper to carry his articles at the time.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

After a three-year delay, France granted Haddad the status of political exile in 1995.{{sfn|Loos|1997}}
Respected by all the opposition movements but not a member of any of them, Lise Garon says that Mezri Haddad became a central figure in the Tunisian political scene.{{sfn|Garon|1998|p=73}}
Each article that appeared in ''Libération'' triggered a diplomatic crisis between France and Tunisia.{{sfn|Reporters sans frontières|1995|p=395}}
[[Mohammed Mzali]] said he was the real brains of the Tunisian opposition in exile as well as the bridge between it and the left opposition inside the country.{{sfn|Mzali|2004|pp=73–74}}
He adds that "Mezri Haddad was one of the few Tunisian intellectuals to take up his pen to defend me publicly, as he did not know me personally. He had left Tunisia in January 1984 after resigning from RTT (Tunisian Radio and Television) where he made his first steps as a journalist. He was not ''destourien'', or a small apparatchik who had just lost his privileges, or an ambitious calculator."{{sfn|Mzali|2004|pp=73–74}}

In an interview with the Belgian daily ''[[Le Soir]]'' in 1997 Haddad denounced the paranoia and "almost pathological susceptibility" of the regime, as well as the fundamentalist threat, while emphasizing the peaceful and democratic means to fight it.{{sfn|Loos|1997}}
Has also called for a return to the spirit and the letter of the Declaration of 7 November 1987 "provided that the evil counselors of the prince finally leave the palace of Carthage".{{sfn|Loos|1997}}
Two influential men seem to have played a decisive role in the rapprochement between President Ben Ali and Mezri Haddad: [[Mohamed Masmoudi]], former Foreign Minister in the Bourguiba era and [[Béchir Ben Yahmed]], head of ''[[Jeune Afrique]]''. 
From 1998 the latter tried to persuade Haddad to break exile and return to Tunisia, but Haddad did not return home until April 2000, a few days before the death of Bourguiba.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}
He then met the president and called for a general amnesty and the return of political exiles in Tunisia&lt;ref&gt;''Libération'', 13 April 2000&lt;/ref&gt; including [[Ahmed Ben Salah]] and Mzali.

With Haddad's new book, ''Non Delenda Carthago. Carthage ne sera pas détruite'' published by Editions du Rocher in 2002 he violently attacked the opposition but did not spare some figures in power, in particular hardliners whom he accused of having radicalized the regime and considerably limited the freedom of expression.{{sfn|Mezri Haddad|2002|pp=370–376}}
Nevertheless, he continued to defend the Tunisian regime, justifying this support by his choice of liberal reformism and democratic gradualism and his rejection of revolutionary alternatives that he said would benefit only the most reactionary elements, including fundamentalists.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

In November 2004, following the presidential election, Haddad felt the wrath of the regime because of an article in ''Jeune Afrique'' in which he compared Ben Ali to General Franco, called for dialogue with the patriotic opposition and calls for a general amnesty and the return of political exiles.{{sfn|Mezri Haddad|2004}}
The caciques of the Constitutional Democratic Rally (RCD) party reacted with a violent article against him, published in the same magazine under the title "With Ben Ali, Tunisia knows where it is going. But where is the rudderless ship of Mezri Haddad going?"{{sfn|Chagraoui|2004}}

In November 2009, after four years in the desert, Haddad was appointed by President Ben Ali as Ambassador of Tunisia to [[UNESCO]], filling a vacancy open since 1996.{{sfn|Mezri Haddad ... Réalités 2009|p=14}}
The RCD reacted very badly to this appointment and, according to ''Maghreb Confidential'', Ben Ali made the decision "against the advice of his senior political adviser, [[Abdelwahab Abdallah]]".{{sfn|Mezri Haddad, Maghreb Confidentiel}}

==Tunisian revolution==

Hadadd was responsible for the academic mission of the [[President of Tunisia]], and defended the progressive and reformist line within the regime, along with Mohamed Charfi, [[Dali Jazi]] and Slaheddine Maaoui.{{sfn|Charfi|2009}}
During the [[Tunisian Revolution]] which began on began on 18 December 2010 he supported the regime until 13 January 2011, when he said:
{{blockquote|If this situation continues in Tunisia, the mob will go to work. The people are worried. The people in their business, in their home, worry about the surging mobs. And all the mobs in the world are similar [...] This mob then, this flood, this fanatical horde is burning, breaking, attacking public and private property, and soon, if we let them continue, and if we continue to apologize for this anarchy in Tunisia, of course we will have soon these mobs attack people at home, violate them, steal and kill, absolutely.{{sfn|La colère de l'ambassadeur de Tunisie ... 2011}} }}

To everyone's surprise, the next morning Hadadd submitted his resignation from his post as ambassador to Unesco.{{sfn|L'ambassadeur de Tunisie annonce sa démission}}
He did this a few hours before the announcement of the departure of President Ben Ali, to whom he wrote: "If you refuse [the resignation], that would mean for me that I will now serve a democratic state. If you accept it, that will be a deliverance for me and a loss for you."{{sfn|Mezri Haddad|2011}}
Mezri Haddad was the only ambassador to have resigned after having served fourteen months.{{sfn|Profil de Mezri Haddad, Le Huffington Post}}
Raphael Haddad, a disciple of Bernard-Henri Lévy, paid tribute by writing, "Mezri Haddad offered by his resignation today a shining example of dignity and individual courage. But beyond the remarkable human qualities the decision shows, the resignation is also an extremely powerful political indicator.{{sfn|Raphaël Haddad|2011}}
On 16 February Mezri Haddad declared the birth of the Neo-Bourguibiste movement.{{sfn|Naissance d'un Mouvement Néo-Bourguibiste}}
He announced the dissolution of this movement in early March in the Tunisian newspaper ''Le Temps''.{{sfn|Déclaration de Mezri Haddad ... 2011}}
On 19 August 2011 the party of the Neo-Bourguibian Union was legalized{{sfn|Arrêté du ministre de l'Intérieur du 19 août 2011|p=1602}} on the initiative of Mohsen Feki.

After the revolution, Mezri Hadadd again chose exile in France, where he continued to lead his fight "for a sovereign, democratic and secular Tunisia" and to fight against the ideology of the Muslim Brotherhood and against [[Wahhabism]], both in Arab countries and in France.{{sfn|Le Qatar investit dans les banlieues}}
He was sued and won a lawsuit against [[Al Jazeera]].{{sfn|Mezri Haddad gagne son procès contre Al-Jazeera}}
The most objective article on the thinking and path of Mezri Haddad remains that the Algerian intellectual Noureddine Dziri published in ''Jeune Afrique'' on 5 January 2004 under the title "Mezri Haddad or the dilemma of the scientist and politics".{{sfn|Noureddine Dziri|2014}}

'''''Mimesis: The Representation of Reality in Western Literature''''' ({{lang-de|Mimesis: Dargestellte Wirklichkeit in der abendländischen Literatur}}) is a book of [[literary criticism]] by [[Erich Auerbach]], and his most well known work. Written while Auerbach was teaching in [[Istanbul]], [[Turkey]], where he fled after being ousted from his professorship in Romance [[Philology]] at the [[University of Marburg]] by the [[Nazis]] in 1935,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

''Mimesis'' famously opens with a comparison between the way the world is represented in [[Homer]]’s ''[[Odyssey]]'' and the way it appears in the [[Bible]]. From these two seminal [[Western culture|Western]] texts, Auerbach builds the foundation for a unified theory of [[representation (arts)|representation]] that spans the entire history of Western literature, including even the [[Modernist]] novelists writing at the time Auerbach began his study.

==Overview==
''Mimesis'' gives an account of the way in which [[everyday life]] in its seriousness has been represented by many Western writers, from ancient [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] writers such as [[Petronius]] and [[Tacitus]], early [[Christian]] writers such as [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]], [[Medieval]] writers such as [[Chretien de Troyes]], [[Dante]], and  [[Giovanni Boccaccio|Boccaccio]], [[Renaissance]] writers such as [[Montaigne]], [[Rabelais]], [[Shakespeare]] and [[Cervantes]], seventeenth-century writers such as [[Molière]] and [[Jean Racine|Racine]], [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] writers such as [[Voltaire]], nineteenth-century writers such as [[Stendhal]], [[Balzac]], [[Flaubert]], and [[Émile Zola|Zola]], all the way up to twentieth-century writers such as [[Proust]], and [[Virginia Woolf|Woolf]]. Despite his treatment of the many major works, Auerbach apparently did not think he was comprehensive enough, and apologized in the original publication in 1946 explaining that he had access only to the 'insufficient' resources available in the library at [[Istanbul University]] where he worked;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The mode of literary criticism in which ''Mimesis'' operates is often referred to among contemporary critics as [[historicism]], since Auerbach largely regarded the way reality was represented in the literature of various periods to be intimately bound up with social and intellectual conventions of the time in which they were written. Auerbach considered himself a historical [[Perspectivism|perspectivist]] in the German tradition (he mentioned [[Hegel]] in this respect) exploring specific features of [[literary genre|style]], [[grammar]], [[syntax]], and [[diction]] claims about much broader cultural and historical questions. Of ''Mimesis'', Auerbach wrote that his "purpose is always to write history."

He is in the same German tradition of [[philology]] as [[Ernst Robert Curtius|Ernst Curtius]], [[Leo Spitzer]], and [[Karl Vossler]], having a mastery of many languages and epochs and all-inclusive in its approach, incorporating just about any intellectual endeavor into the discipline of literary criticism.

Auerbach was a [[Romance language]] specialist, which explains his admitted bias towards treating texts from French compared to other languages. [[Chaucer]] and [[Wordsworth]] are not mentioned even in passing, though [[Shakespeare]] and [[Virginia Woolf]] are given full chapters and [[Dickens]] and [[Henry Fielding]] make appearances.

==Position and evaluation of rhetoric==
To the consternation of his colleague, Ernst Curtius, Auerbach's work is marked by an openly anti-rhetorical position. Classical writers such as [[Homer]], [[Tacitus]] and [[Petronius]], as well as Medieval theologians (except St. [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]]), and writers of the seventeenth century, like [[Jean Racine|Racine]], are criticized for adherence to the rhetorical doctrine of "styles" with their corresponding subject matters: the low style's association with the comedic and the popular classes, and the elevated style's association with the tragic, the historic and the heroic. Auerbach sees the Bible as opposing this rhetorical doctrine in its serious and poignant portrayals of common folk and their encounter with the divine. As Auerbach notes in chapter two when discussing the New Testament:

&lt;blockquote&gt;But the spirit of rhetoric&amp;mdash;a spirit which classified subjects in ''genera'' and invested every subject with a specific form of style as one garment becoming it in virtue of its nature [i.e. lower classes with the farcical low-style, upper classes with the tragic, the historic and the sublime elevated-style]&amp;mdash;could not extend its dominion to them [the Bible writers] for the simple reason that their subject would not fit into any of the known genres. A scene like Peter's denial fits into no antique genre. It is too serious for comedy, too contemporary and everyday for tragedy, politically too insignificant for history&amp;mdash;and the form which was given it is one of such immediacy that its like does not exist in the literature of antiquity.&lt;ref name="mimesis"&gt;{{cite book

The Bible will ultimately be responsible for the "[[mixed style]]" of Christian rhetoric, a style that is described by Auerbach in chapter seven as the "antithetical fusion" or "merging" of the high and low style.  The model is Christ's [[Incarnation]] as both ''sublimitas'' and ''humilitas''.  This mixture ultimately leads to a "popular realism" seen in the religious plays and sermons of the 12th Century.  Auerbach also discusses the development of an intermediate or middle style due to Medieval influences from the Bible and [[Courtly Love]] (see chapters nine and fifteen on [[Boccaccio]] and [[Molière]]). This development of an intermediate and then ultimately another "mixed style" (Shakespeare, Hugo) leads to what Auerbach calls the "modern realism" of the nineteenth-century (see chapter nineteen on [[Flaubert]]).      
  
Auerbach champions writers during periods under the sway of rhetorical forms of writing like [[Gregory of Tours]] and St. [[Francis of Assisi]], whose Latin was poor and whose rhetorical education was minimal, but who were still able to convey vivid expression and feeling. He also champions the diarist [[Louis de Rouvroy, duc de Saint-Simon|Saint-Simon]] who wrote about the late seventeenth and early eighteenth century French court. Completely free of the absolute constraints of style found in Racine or the superficial use of reality found in [[Antoine François Prévost|Prévost]] or [[Voltaire]], Saint-Simon's portraits of court life are considered by Auerbach, somewhat surprisingly, to be the precursor of [[Proust]] (an admirer of Saint-Simon) and [[Émile Zola|Zola]].

==Critical reception==
''Mimesis'' is almost universally respected for its penetrating insights on the particular works it addresses but is frequently criticized for what is sometimes regarded as its lack of a single overarching claim. For this reason, individual chapters of the book are often read independently. Most critics praise his sprawling approach for its reveling in the complexities of each work and [[Epoch (reference date)|epoch]] without resorting to generalities and [[reductionism]]. 

By far the most frequently reprinted chapter is chapter one, "[[Odysseus' scar (Auerbach)|Odysseus' Scar]]" in which Auerbach compares the scene in book 19 of [[Homer]]’s ''[[Odyssey]]'', when [[Odysseus]] finally returns home from his two decades of warring and journeying, to [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 22, the story of [[Binding of Isaac|The Binding of Isaac]]. Highlighting the rhetorically determined simplicity of characters in the ''Odyssey'' (what he calls the "external") against what he regards as the psychological depth of the figures in the [[Old Testament]], Auerbach suggests that the Old Testament gives a more powerful and historical impression than the ''Odyssey'', which he classifies as closer to "legend" in which all details are leisurely fleshed out and all actions occur in a simple present – indeed even flashbacks are narrated in the present tense.

Auerbach summarizes his comparison of the texts as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The two styles, in their opposition, represent basic types: on the one hand [''The Odyssey'' 's] fully externalized description, uniform illustration, uninterrupted connection, free expression, all events in the foreground, displaying unmistakable meanings, few elements of historical development and of psychological perspective; on the other hand [in the Old Testament], certain parts brought into high relief, others left obscure, abruptness, suggestive influence of the unexpressed, "background" quality, multiplicity of meanings and the need for interpretation, universal-historical claims, development of the concept of the historically becoming, and preoccupation with the problematic.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Auerbach concludes by arguing that the "full development" of these two styles, the rhetorical tradition with its constraints on representing reality and the Biblical or "realist" tradition with its engagement of everyday experience, exercised a "determining influence upon the representation of reality in European literature."

It is in the context of this comparison between the Biblical and the Homeric that Auerbach draws his famous conclusion that the Bible’s claim to truth is "tyrannical," since &lt;blockquote&gt;  
What he [the writer of the Old Testament] produced then, was not primarily oriented towards "realism" (if he succeeded in being realistic, it was merely a means, not an end): it was oriented to truth.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, by the time Auerbach treats the work of [[Flaubert]] we have come full circle. Like the Biblical writers whose faith in the so-called "tyrannical" truth of God produces an authentic expression of reality, Flaubert's "faith in the truth of language" (ch. 18) likewise represents "an entire human experience."

[[File:Molina - De Justitia et jure, 1759 - 272.tif|right|thumb|[[Luis de Molina]], the namesake of Molinism]]
{{Catholic philosophy}}
'''Molinism''', named after 16th-century Spanish [[Jesuit]] theologian [[Luis de Molina]], is a philosophical doctrine which attempts to reconcile the [[Divine Providence|providence]] of [[God]] with human [[free will]]. [[William Lane Craig]] and [[Alvin Plantinga]] are prominent contemporary advocates of Molinism. Other Molinists include [[Alfred Freddoso]], [[Thomas Flint]], and [[Kenneth Keathley]]. Molinism holds that God does initiate salvation and in his providence foreknows what and when his creatures would choose, in their free choice, to accept or reject his salvation made available to them in Jesus Christ.

== God's types of knowledge ==

Kenneth Keathley, author of ''Salvation and Sovereignty: A Molinist Approach,'' writes that Molinists argue that God perfectly accomplishes his will in the lives of genuinely free creatures through the use of his omniscience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Keathley|first=Kenneth|title=Salvation and Sovereignty: A Molinist Approach|year=2010|publisher=B&amp;H Publishing Group|location=Nashville|isbn=978-0-8054-3198-8|pages=16–41 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After Luis de Molina, Molinists present God’s knowledge in a sequence of three logical moments. The first is God's knowledge of necessary truths or natural knowledge. These truths are independent of God's will and are non-contingent. This knowledge includes the full range of logical possibilities. Examples include such statements as "All bachelors are unmarried" or "X cannot be A and non-A at the same time, in the same way, at the same place" or "It is possible that X obtain." The second is called “middle knowledge” and it contains the range of possible things that would happen given certain circumstances. The third kind of knowledge is God's free knowledge. This type of knowledge consists of contingent truths that are dependent upon God's will, or truths that God brings about, that he does not have to bring about. Examples might include statements such as "God created the earth" or something particular about this world which God has actualized. This is called God’s “free knowledge” and it contains the future or what will happen. In between God’s natural and free knowledge is his middle knowledge (or ''scientia media'') by which God knows what his free creatures would do under any circumstance. These are "truths" that do not have to be true, but are true without God being the primary cause of them. In ''[[The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'', John D. Laing has provided an example of middle knowledge:  "If John Laing were given the opportunity to write an article on middle knowledge for the Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, he would freely do so."&lt;ref name="The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy (IEP)"&gt;{{cite web|last1=:Laing|first1=John D.|title=Middle Knowledge|url=https://www.iep.utm.edu/middlekn/|website=The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy (IEP)|accessdate=17 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This viewpoint is difficult for some to grasp but is the basis of Molinist opinion.

Molinists have supported their case scripturally with Christ's statement in {{bibleref|Matthew|11:23}}:&lt;ref name="Can We Believe It?: Evidence for Christianity"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Seber|first1=George A. F.|title=Can We Believe It?: Evidence for Christianity|date=2016|publisher=Wipf and Stock|location=Eugene OR|isbn=978-1498289191|pages=128–130|url=https://books.google.com/?id=AYThCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA128&amp;lpg=PA128&amp;dq=Molinism+Matthew+11:23#v=onepage&amp;q=Molinism%20Matthew%2011%3A23&amp;f=false|accessdate=17 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:And you, Capernaum, will you be exalted to heaven? You will be brought down to Hades. For if the mighty works done in you had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until this day.

The Molinist claims that in this example, God knows what his free creatures would choose under hypothetical circumstances, namely that the Sodomites would have responded in a way that Sodom would still have been in existence in Jesus' day, given that hypothetical situation.

[[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 11:23 contains what is commonly called a [[counterfactual conditional|counterfactual]] of creaturely freedom. But counterfactuals are to be distinguished from [[predestination|foreknowledge]]. The Bible contains many examples of foreknowledge such as {{bibleref|Deut|31:16-17}}, where God tells Moses that the Israelites will forsake God after they are delivered from Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;The Bible also contains several examples of counterfactuals, such as {{bibleref|1Samuel|23:1-14}} and [[Wisdom of Solomon]] 4:11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some opponents of Molinism claim that God's foreknowledge and knowledge of counterfactuals are examples of what God is going to actively bring about. That is, when Christ describes the response of the Sodomites in the aforementioned example, God was going to actively bring it about that they would remain until today.&lt;ref&gt;This is the stance that [[Gregory A. Boyd|Gregory Boyd]] takes, among other places, in his book ''God of the possible.''&lt;/ref&gt;  Molinists have responded to this objection by noting that scripture contains examples of God's foreknowledge of evil acts. For example, the Israelites forsaking God, or Peter's denial of Christ, are both examples of what one would call overt acts of sin. Yet, according to opponents of Molinism, God is actively bringing about these overt acts of sin. This is fallacious according to the Molinist. In order for this account of prophecy to be valid all prophecies must be wholly good, and never contain evil acts; but this is not what opponents believe to be the case.

== Knowledge of counterfactuals ==

Molinists believe that God has knowledge not only of [[necessary truth]]s and contingent truths, but also of [[counterfactuals]].  (God's knowledge of counterfactuals is often referred to as his ''middle knowledge'', although technically that term is more broad than simply the knowledge of counterfactuals.)  A counterfactual is a statement of the form "if it were the case that P, it would be the case that Q". An example would be, "If Bob were in Tahiti he would freely choose to go swimming instead of sunbathing." The Molinist claims that even if Bob is never in Tahiti, God can still know whether Bob would go swimming or sunbathing. The Molinist believes that God, using his middle knowledge and foreknowledge, surveyed all [[possible world]]s and then actualized a particular one. God's middle knowledge of counterfactuals would play an integral part in this "choosing" of a particular world.

Molinists say the logical ordering of events for creation would be as follows:

1. God's natural knowledge of [[necessary truth]]s.

2. God's middle knowledge, (including [[counterfactual conditional|counterfactuals]]).

---Creation of the World---

3. God's free knowledge (the actual [[ontology]] of the world).

Hence, God's middle knowledge plays an important role in the actualization of the world. In fact, it seems as if God's middle knowledge of counterfactuals plays a more immediate role in perception than God's foreknowledge. [[William Lane Craig]] points out that “without middle knowledge, God would find himself, so to speak, with knowledge of the future but without any logical prior planning of the future.”&lt;ref&gt;Craig.  ''The Only Wise God''. 1999 p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt; The placing of God's middle knowledge between God's knowledge of [[necessary truth]]s and God's creative decree is crucial. For if God's middle knowledge was ''after'' his decree of creation, then God would be actively causing what various creatures would do in various circumstances and thereby destroying libertarian freedom. But by placing middle knowledge (and thereby [[counterfactual conditional|counterfactuals]]) ''before'' the creation decree God allows for freedom in the libertarian sense. The placing of middle knowledge logically after  [[necessary truth]]s, but before the creation decree also gives God the possibility to survey [[possible world]]s and decide which world to actualize.&lt;ref&gt;James Beilby and Paul Eddy, ''Divine Foreknowledge, Four views''. Downers Grove, Illinois: InterVarsity Press, 2001. pg 120-123.&lt;/ref&gt;

Craig gives three reasons for holding that counterfactuals statements are true.  “First, we ourselves often appear to know such true counterfactuals. Second, it is plausible that the Law of Conditional Excluded Middle (LCEM) holds for counterfactuals of a certain special form, usually called "counterfactuals of creaturely freedom."  Third, the Scriptures are replete with counterfactual statements, so that the Christian theist, at least, should be committed to the truth of certain counterfactuals about free, creaturely actions.”&lt;ref name=craig2001&gt;{{cite journal |first1=William Lane |last1=Craig |year=2001 |title=Middle Knowledge, Truth-Makers, and the Grounding Objection |url=http://www.leaderu.com/offices/billcraig/docs/grounding.html |journal=Faith and Philosophy |volume=18 |pages=337–52 |doi=10.5840/faithphil200118329 |editor1-last=l. Peterson |editor1-first=Michael |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theological implications ==

William Lane Craig calls Molinism “one of the most fruitful theological ideas ever conceived. For it would serve to explain not only God’s knowledge of the future, but divine providence and predestination as well”.&lt;ref&gt;Craig.  ''The Only Wise God''. 1999 p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt;  Under it, God retains a measure of divine providence without hindering humanity's freedom. Because God has middle knowledge, he knows what an agent would freely do in a particular situation. So, agent A, if placed in circumstance C, would freely choose option X over option Y. Thus, if God wanted to accomplish X, all God would do is, using his middle knowledge, actualize the world in which A was placed in C, and A would freely choose X. God retains an element of providence without nullifying A's choice and God's purpose (the actualization of X) is fulfilled.

Molinists also believe it can aid one's understanding of salvation. Ever since [[Augustine]] and [[Pelagius (British monk)|Pelagius]] there has been debate over the issue of salvation; more specifically how can God elect believers and believers still come to God freely? Protestants who lean more towards God's election and sovereignty are usually Calvinists while those who lean more towards humanity's free choice follow [[Arminianism]]. However, the Molinist can embrace both God's sovereignty and human free choice.

Take the salvation of Agent A. God knows that if he were to place A in circumstances C, then A would freely choose to believe in Christ. So God actualizes the world where C occurs, and then A freely believes. God still retains a measure of his divine providence because he actualizes the world in which A freely chooses. But, A still retains freedom in the sense of being able to choose either option. Molinism does not affirm two contradictory propositions when it affirms both God's providence and humanity's freedom. God's providence extends to the actualization of the world in which an agent may believe upon Christ.

===Difference from Calvinism and from Arminianism===
Molinism differs from [[Calvinism]] by affirming that God grants salvation, but humanity has the choice to freely accept it or reject it (but God knows that if the person were put in a particular situation he or she would not reject it). This differs from Calvinistic [[predestination]], which states that a person's salvation is already determined by God such that he or she cannot choose otherwise or resist God’s grace.

It also differs from [[Arminianism]] because it claims that God definitively knows how a person would react to the Gospel message if they were put in a particular situation. Molinists have internal disagreements about the extent to which they agree with Calvinism, some holding to unconditional election, others holding to conditional election and others still holding to an election that is partly both.  Alfred Freddoso explains: “Some Molinists, including Bellarmine and Suárez, agree with the Bañezians that God antecedently elects certain people to eternal glory and only then consults his middle knowledge to discover which graces will guarantee their salvation. Thus, in Peter's case, God would have chosen different graces if those he actually chose had been foreknown to be merely sufficient and not efficacious for Peter's salvation. Other Molinists, including Molina himself, vigorously reject any such antecedent absolute election of Peter to salvation. They insist instead that God simply chooses to create a world in which he infallibly foresees Peter's good use of the supernatural graces afforded him, and only then does he accept Peter among the elect in light of his free consent to those graces.”  &lt;ref&gt;Feddoso.  "Molinism," in Edward Craig, ed., Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy (London: Routledge, 1998).&lt;/ref&gt; Other Molinists avoid the issue altogether by holding to the highly controversial view of trans-world damnation, the idea that the unsaved in this world would have rejected Christ in any world.

===Debate between Jesuit Molinists and Dominicans===
{{main|Congregatio de Auxiliis}}
In 1581, a heated argument erupted between the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]], who advocated Molinism, and the [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]], who had a different understanding of God's foreknowledge and the nature of predestination.  In 1597, [[Pope Clement VIII]] established the [[Congregatio de Auxiliis]], a committee whose purpose was to settle this controversy.  In 1607, [[Pope Paul V]] ended the quarrel by forbidding each side to accuse the other of heresy, allowing both views to exist side-by-side in the Catholic Church.

===Other implications===
[[Thomas Flint]] has developed what he considers other implications of Molinism, including [[papal infallibility]], [[prophecy]], and [[prayer]].&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Flint, ''Divine Providence: The Molinist Account'', pages 179-250.&lt;/ref&gt;  William Lane Craig uses Molinism to reconcile scriptural passages warning of apostasy with passages teaching the security of believers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF00133805 |title=?Lest anyone should fall?: A middle knowledge perspective on perseverance and apostolic warnings |year=1991 |last1=Craig |first1=William Lane |journal=International Journal for Philosophy of Religion |volume=29 |issue=2 |pages=65–74}}&lt;/ref&gt; Craig has also used middle knowledge to explain a wide range of theological issues, such as [[divine providence]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Molinism vs. Calvinism|url=http://www.reasonablefaith.org/molinism-vs-calvinism|publisher=Reasonable Faith|accessdate=10 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[predestination]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Molinism and Divine Election|url=http://www.reasonablefaith.org/molinism-and-divine-election|publisher=Reasonable Faith|accessdate=10 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[biblical inspiration]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Molinist Perspective on Biblical Inspiration|url=http://www.reasonablefaith.org/a-molinist-perspective-on-biblical-inspiration|publisher=Reasonable Faith|accessdate=10 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[perseverance of the saints]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title='Lest Anyone Should Fall': A Middle Knowledge Perspective on Perseverance and Apostolic Warnings|journal=International Journal for Philosophy of Religion|date=1991|issue=29|pages=65–74}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and Christian particularism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Middle Knowledge and Christian Particularism|url=http://www.reasonablefaith.org/middle-knowledge-and-christian-particularism|accessdate=10 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biblical texts for Molinism ==

Molinists have often argued that their position is the Biblical one by indicating passages they understand to teach God's middle knowledge. Molina advanced the following three texts: {{bibleverse|1|Samuel|23:8-14|NIV}}, {{bibleverse||Proverbs|4:11|NIV}}, and {{bibleverse||Matthew|11:23|NIV}}. Other passages which Molinists use are {{bibleverse|Ezekiel|3:6-7|NIV}}, {{bibleverse||Jeremiah|38:17-18|NIV}}, {{bibleverse|1|Corinthians|2:8|NIV}}, {{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|28:51-57|NIV}}, {{bibleverse||Matthew|23:27-32|NIV}}, {{bibleverse||Matthew|12:7|NIV}}, {{bibleverse||Matthew|24:43|NIV}}, {{bibleverse||Luke|16:30-31|NIV}}, and {{bibleverse||Luke|22:67-68|NIV}}. [[William Lane Craig]] has argued at length that many of Christ's statements seem to indicate middle knowledge. [[William Lane Craig|Craig]] cites the following passages: {{bibleverse||Matthew|17:27|NIV}}, {{bibleverse||John|21:6|NIV}}, {{bibleverse||John|15:22-24|NIV}}, {{bibleverse||John|18:36|NIV}}, {{bibleverse||Luke|4:24-44|NIV}} and {{bibleverse||Matthew|26:24|NIV}}.&lt;ref&gt;William Lane Craig. "The Middle Knowledge View." ''Divine Foreknowledge, Four Views.'' Downers Grove: InterVarsity Press, 2001. 124.&lt;/ref&gt; Craig accepts that the most these texts indicate is that God has counterfactual knowledge. In order for this knowledge to be middle knowledge, it must be logically prior to God's free knowledge, something the Biblical texts mentioned do not seem to affirm or deny. However, Craig argues that if God’s decree were logically prior to his middle knowledge, that would “make God the author of sin and to obliterate human freedom, since in that case it is God who decrees which counterfactuals about creaturely free acts are true, including counterfactuals concerning sinful human decisions. Thus, we have good reason for thinking that if such counterfactuals are now true or false, they must have been so logically prior to God's decree.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Middle Knowledge, Truth-Makers, and the 'Grounding Objection' |journal=Faith and Philosophy |volume=18 |year=2001 |pages=337–52 |issue=3 |first1=William Lane |last1=Craig |doi=10.5840/faithphil200118329 |editor1-last=l. Peterson |editor1-first=Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomas Flint claims the twin foundations of Molinism are God’s providence and man’s freedom.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Flint, ''Divine Providence: The Molinist Account'', page 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Molinism harmonizes texts teaching God’s providence (such as {{bibleref|Acts|4:28}} or {{bibleref|Ephesians|1:11}}) with texts emphasizing man’s choice (such as {{bibleref|Deuteronomy|30:19}} or {{bibleref|Luke|13:34}}).

==Criticism==
Molinism has been controversial and criticized since its inception in Molina’s concordia. The Dominican Order which espoused strict Thomism criticized that novel doctrine and found fault with the ''scientia media'', which they think implies passivity, which is repugnant to Pure Act. The Thomists disputed it before the Popes, as bordering on Semi-Pelagianism, and afterwards there were ten years of debate in the famous Congregation ''de Auxiliis''.

The grounding objection is at present the most debated objection to Molinism, and often considered the strongest. The argument claims that there are no [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] grounds for the truthfulness of [[counterfactual conditional|counterfactuals]] of creaturely freedom. As Hugh J. McCann puts it, “Perhaps the most serious objection against it is that there does not appear to be any way God could come by such knowledge. Knowledge, as we have seen, is not merely a matter of conceiving a proposition and correctly believing it to be true. It requires justification: one must have good reasons for believing. But what justification could God have for believing the propositions that are supposed to constitute middle knowledge? The truth of subjunctives of freedom cannot be discerned a priori, for they are contingent. It is not a necessary truth that if placed in circumstances C, I will decide to attend the concert tonight. Nor can we allow that God might learn the truth of C  from my actual behavior — that is, by observing that I actually do, in circumstances C, decide to attend the concert. For God could not make observations like this without also finding out what creative decisions he is actually going to make, which would destroy the whole purpose of middle knowledge.”&lt;ref&gt;McCann. Divine Providence.  2006 http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/providence-divine/&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, there are no "truth makers" that ground [[counterfactual conditional|counterfactuals]]. Opponents to middle knowledge claim that the historical [[Antecedent (logic)|antecedent]] of any [[possible world]] does not determine the truthfulness of a counterfactual for a creature, if that creature is free in the [[Libertarianism (metaphysics)|libertarian]] sense. (Molinists naturally accept this, but deny that this entails that counterfactuals of creaturely freedom lack [[truth value]]s.)

Many philosophers and theologians who embrace the grounding objection prefer to claim that instead of [[counterfactual conditional|counterfactuals]] of freedom being true, probable counterfactuals are true instead.&lt;ref&gt;For example, consider Gregory Boyd's article "Neo-Molinism and the Infinite Intelligence of God," ''Philosophia Christi'',vol. 5, nu 2; 2003. Boyd claims that divine omniscience entails 'might' counterfactuals--counterfactuals of what a creature might or might not do (190-192). See also {{cite journal |first1=Robert Merrihew |last1=Adams |year=1977 |title=Middle Knowledge and the Problem of Evil |journal=American Philosophical Quarterly |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=109–17 |jstor=20009657 |url=http://commonsenseatheism.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/Adams-Middle-Knowledge-and-the-Problem-of-Evil.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; So instead of truths of the following sort: "God knows that in circumstance C creature X will freely do A" God knows truths of this sort: "God knows that in circumstances C creature X would probably  do A." Yet, as Edward Wierenga has pointed out, probable counterfactuals are also contingent truths and fall victim to the same grounding objection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Edward |last1=Wierenga |title=Providence, Middle Knowledge, and the Grounding Objection |journal=Philosophia Christi |volume=3 |issue=2 |year=2001 |pages=447–56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Molinists have responded to the aforementioned argument two ways. First, as Alfred Freddoso states, "it seems reasonable to claim that there are now adequate metaphysical grounds for the truth of conditional future contingent Ft(P) on H just in case there would be adequate metaphysical grounds at t for the truth of the present-tense  proposition p on the conditions that H should obtain at t."&lt;ref&gt;Freddoso.  1988.  Introduction to Luis De Molina’s On Divine Foreknowledge.  p. 72&lt;/ref&gt;  [[William Lane Craig]] agrees "[I]n order for a counterfactual of freedom to be true, it is not required that the events to which they refer actually exist; all that is required is that they ''would'' exist under the specified conditions."&lt;ref&gt;William Lane Craig, ''Divine Foreknowledge and Human Freedom''. New York, E.J. Brill; 1991, 260.&lt;/ref&gt; The idea here is that if we imagine God creating multiple universes in multiple dimensions and giving people libertarian free will in the various universes and letting events all play out, we would have no problem grounding counterfactuals of freedom based on the events in the various universes. But why should God need to create such universes to know how events would unfold, and couldn’t how they would turn out ground statements about how they would turn out?

Further objections at this point lead to a second line of response.  Alvin Plantinga responds to the grounding objection by saying "It seems to me much clearer that some counterfactuals of freedom are at least possibly true than that the truth of propositions must, in general, be grounded in this way."&lt;ref&gt;Alvin Plantinga, "Reply to Robert Adams," in Alvin Plantinga, ed. James E. Tomberlin and Peter Van Inwagen, Profiles 5 (Dordrecht: D. Reidel, 1985), p. 378.&lt;/ref&gt; William Lane Craig follows up on this by pointing out the burden of proof the grounding objector bears.  The grounding objection “asserts that there are no true counterfactuals about how creatures would freely act under any given set of circumstances. This assertion is no mere ostensibly undercutting defeater of Molinism, but a putatively rebutting defeater. It makes a bold and positive assertion and therefore requires warrant in excess of that which attends the Molinist assumption that there are true counterfactuals about creaturely free actions.”  Latter, Craig points out “Anti–Molinists have not even begun the task of showing that counterfactuals of creaturely freedom are members of the set of propositions or statements which require truth–makers if they are to be true.”&lt;ref name=craig2001/&gt;  Thus the grounding objector must prove a universal negative regarding the falsity of counterfactuals of freedom or he must explain his theory of the basis for truth and prove that theory true.

The difference in perspectives here may be briefly described in the following way. According to critics, the way in which an agent will make a free choice inherently cannot be known apart from observation of the choice being actualized. God may be able to observe these choices via prescience, but even he must still observe them to know them. Therefore, God cannot know what we will do, unless he sees the future. The Molinist position, exemplified by Craig in the preceding paragraph, is 1) to argue this requires potentially heretical arguments relating to a limitation of divine omniscience, and 2) that a choice can be free, and yet the way in which an agent will make that choice can be known apart from observation of the actualized choice itself (and even apart from the actualization of the choice entirely). Critics maintain that this is no longer really a free choice: if it is known that "If she were offered a dollar, she would take it," apart from actually offering that person a dollar, then she is not free to take or not take that dollar. It will be noted that the question hinges upon whether, by the definition of a free choice, it is possible to know which choice will be made independently from the actualization of that choice.

'''Mou Zongsan''' ({{zh|c=牟宗三|p=Móu Zōngsān|w='''Mou Tsungsan'''}}, 1909–1995) was a [[China|Chinese]] [[New Confucian]] philosopher. He was born in [[Shandong]] province and graduated from [[Peking University]]. In 1949 he moved to [[Taiwan]] and later to Hong Kong, and he remained outside of [[mainland China]] for the rest of his life.  His thought was heavily influenced by [[Immanuel Kant]], whose three [[Critiques]] he translated, possibly first,&lt;ref name=Chan&gt;•	Chan, Wing-Cheuk. "Mou Zongsan'S Transformation Of Kant'S Philosophy." Journal of Chinese Philosophy 33.1 (2006): 125-39. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; into Chinese, and above all by [[Tiantai]] Buddhist philosophy.

Over the last 40 years of his life, Mou wrote histories of "[[Neo-Daoist]]," [[Confucianism|Confucian]], and [[Buddhist philosophy|Buddhist]] philosophy (totaling six volumes) a group of constructive philosophic treatises, culminating in his 1985 work, ''On the Summum Bonum'' ({{zh|c=圓善論|p=yuanshan lun}}), in which he attempts to rectify the problems in Kant's system through a Confucian-based philosophy reworked with a set of concepts appropriated from Tiantai Buddhism.

In the People's Republic of China, Mou is especially famous for his cultural traditionalism and his defense of democracy as a traditional Chinese value.

==Biography==
Mou Zongsan was born into the family of an innkeeper in [[Qixia, Shandong|Qixia]], [[Shandong]]. He went to Peking University for college prep (1927) and undergraduate courses (1929). During that time he became a follower of [[Xiong Shili]], author of the ''New Treatise on Consciousness-only'' and soon to be the most eminent philosopher in China until supplanted by Mou himself. After graduating in 1933, Mou moved around the country working as a secondary school teacher and a faculty member at different universities. In 1949 he followed the [[Guomindang|Nationalist]] government to Taiwan. His student at [[Tunghai University]] was [[Tu Weiming]]. In 1960 he moved to Hong Kong and eventually took up a post at [[New Asia College]] in Hong Kong (now part of the [[Chinese University of Hong Kong]]). During the last two decades of his life Mou was something of an intellectual celebrity. He lectured frequently on Confucian, Buddhist, Daoist, and Kantian philosophy at [[Hong Kong University]], [[National Taiwan Normal University]], and [[National Taiwan University]]. He died in [[Taipei]] in 1995, leaving dozens of disciples in top academic jobs in Taiwan and Hong Kong.&lt;ref&gt;Jason Clower, "[http://www.iep.utm.edu/zongsan/ Mou Zongsan (Mou Tsung-san)] ," [http://www.iep.utm.edu/home/about/ Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
Mou's complete works contains more than 30 volumes written over about 60 years. In religious studies and philosophy programs, attention is paid mostly to his production in his last 30 years. These can be divided into histories of Chinese philosophy and philosophic treatises.

===Histories of philosophy===
''Physical Nature and Speculative Reason'' 才性與玄理 (1963). This is Mou's main treatise on "Neo-Daoism" or ''xuanxue'' 玄學. It is an analysis of intellectual developments of the Wei-Jin dynasties (220-420 AD), said to set the agenda for much of later Chinese philosophy and anticipate the developments in Buddhist philosophy later understood by Mou as a pattern underlying the main line of Song-Ming Confucianism.

''Substance of Mind and Substance of Human Nature'' 心體與性體 (1968–1969). This is probably the most studied of Mou's books, and by far the most famous in the West. It is a three volume history of Confucianism in the Song (960-1279) and Ming (1368-1644) dynasties, often called "[[Neo-Confucianism]]" in the West. It challenges usual two-part division of Neo-Confucian thought into a "school of principle" (''lixue'' 理學), the [[Cheng-Zhu school]] represented by [[Cheng Yi (philosopher)|Cheng Yi]], [[Cheng Hao]], and [[Zhu Xi]], and a "school of mind" (''xinxue'' 心學) or [[Yangmingism|Lu-Wang school]] represented by [[Lu Xiangshan]] and [[Wang Yangming]]. Mou identifies a third lineage, whose main figures are [[Hu Hong]] (Hu Wufeng) and [[Liu Zongzhou]] (Liu Jishan), which best conveys the basic message of the classical sage [[Mencius]]. Mou's later book ''From Lu Xiangshan to Liu Jishan'' (從陸象山到劉蕺山) (1979) is treated as the fourth volume of this book.

''Buddha-Nature and Prajna'' 佛性與般若 (1977). This is Mou's main examination of [[Buddhist philosophy]], written in two volumes. It upends usual Chinese recognition of [[Huayan school]] as most well-developed form of Buddhism and puts the [[Tiantai]] school in first place. Mou credits Tiantai with having the best concepts for understanding the authoritative Hong-Liu line of Confucianism.

===Philosophical treatises===
''Intellectual Intuition and Chinese Philosophy'' 智的直覺與中國哲學 (1971). In this treatise, Mou applies the Kantian idea of 'intellectual intuition' to Chinese philosophy, which he believes affirms the idea that human beings can have such awareness. He expresses strong interest in the utility of Buddhist philosophy for Confucian purposes. This book is often thought of as an early version of ''Phenomenon and Thing-in-Itself''.

''Phenomenon and Thing-in-Itself'' 現象與物自身 (1975). This develops Mou's famous doctrine of "two-level ontology," patterned off of Kantian and Buddhist metaphysics.

''Treatise on Summum Bonum'' (圓善論) (1985). This is Mou's last major work. Mou did not intend it as his final book, but scholars generally treat it as the definitive summary of his thinking.  It attempts to use Tiantai ontological concepts as inspiration to find Confucian solution to Kant's problem of the highest good or ''summum bonum.'' It includes a chapter with Mou's commentary on Mencius and a more complete evaluation of the place of Daoist and Buddhist philosophy for the modern Confucian.

==Mou's philosophy==

===Mou and Kant===
Following his teacher [[Xiong Shili]], Mou Zongsan sought to articulate and justify a moral metaphysics.&lt;ref name=Bunnin&gt;•	Bunnin, Nicholas. "God's Knowledge And Ours: Kant And Mou Zongsan On Intellectual Intuition." Journal of Chinese Philosophy 35.4 (2008): 613-24. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; A moral metaphysics asserts the interconnectedness of ontology and morality, implying the moral value of all objects including the self. Mou's philosophy attempts to demonstrate the limits of Kant, suggesting instead the ways in which Chinese thought may surpass Kantian morality. Several of Mou's titles directly reveal his engagement with Kant – ''Intellectual Intuition and Chinese Philosophy'', ''Phenomenon and Thing-in-Itself'', and ''Treatise of the Perfect Good'' – a commitment that is reflected in Mou's decision to express his philosophy in Kantian terms. For example, Mou's philosophy inherits the Kantian concepts of autonomy, intellectual intuition, and Thing-in-Itself, although Confucianism inspires Mou to transform these concepts.&lt;ref name=Billioud&gt;• Billioud, Sebastien. "Mou Zongsan's Problem With The Heideggerian Interpretation Of Kant." Journal of Chinese Philosophy 33.2 (2006): 225-47. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The reason behind this decision to use Kantian terms remains unknown, but some scholars argue that Mou's use of certain terminologies aims to facilitate a dialogue between the East and West, pointing to Mou's comparison of Mencius and Kant, whereby he demonstrates the compatibility of Chinese and Western philosophies.&lt;ref name=Guo&gt;• Guo, Qiyong. "Mou Zongsan’s View of Interpreting Confucianism by “moral Autonomy”." Frontiers of Philosophy in China 2.3 (2007): 345-62. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mou's philosophy develops as a critique and transformation of Kant's critical philosophy.&lt;ref name=Schmidt&gt;•	Schmidt, Stephan. "Mou Zongsan, Hegel, and Kant: The Quest for Confucian Modernity." Philosophy East and West 61.2 (2011): 260-302. Philosopher's Index [ProQuest]. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; Mou believes in the compatibility of Chinese thought and Kantian philosophy because both are backed by the Way, where the Way is essentially truth and different philosophies manifest different aspects it.&lt;ref&gt;• Jiadong, Zheng. "The Issue of the "Legitimacy" of Chinese Philosophy." Contemporary Chinese Thought 37.1 (2005): 11-23. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  Mou's analysis of Kant centers on Kant's ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]''.&lt;ref name=Chan /&gt; One of Mou's major criticisms of Kant involves Kant's regard for [[free will]] as theoretical. Herein lies one of Mou's fundamental beliefs, that morality and the moral life are, contrary to what Kant posits, really real.&lt;ref name=Guo /&gt; This presumption stems from Mou's belief in the metaphysical necessity of the capability of improving one's moral praxis, and thus Mou develops a moral metaphysics within the tenet of [[subjectivism]].&lt;ref name=Chan /&gt; While Kant believes that [[intellectual intuition]] is only possible for God, Mou ascribes human beings equal capability of this intuition, which Mou finds superior to [[Heidegger]]’s [[fundamental ontology]].&lt;ref name=Chan /&gt; Mou rejects Heidegger because according to Kant, true metaphysics is transcendent.&lt;ref name=Billioud /&gt; Mou further departs from Kant’s philosophy, eventually transforming it into what is commonly referred to as New Confucianism or Mind Confucianism.

===Mou's moral metaphysics===
Moral metaphysical systems have been proposed prior to Mou, most notably in the Platonic [[Form of the Good]] and the Confucian concept of ''[[Tao|dao]]''. In one sense, Mou’s philosophy attempts to reconcile these systems. Concurrently, Mou’s philosophy was influenced by Yogacara Buddhism, which believes that no objectivity is possible aside from subjectivity.&lt;ref name=Chan /&gt; Mou’s beliefs regarding the relationship between philosophy and culture and his view of the future of humanity dictate his construction of a philosophy that argues for the necessity to develop “Confucian Modernity”.&lt;ref name=Schmidt /&gt; Akin to his view of intellectual intuition, Mou constructs a vertical philosophical system that emphasizes the relation between the subject and an ontological objective, as opposed to a horizontal system where one's relationship to the world functions through the subject-object dichotomy.&lt;ref&gt;•	Billioud, Sébastien. Thinking through Confucian Modernity: A Study of Mou Zongsan's Moral Metaphysics. Leiden [The Netherlands: Brill, 2012. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Mou's ontological ultimate is ''benti'', or ultimate reality.&lt;ref name=Billioud /&gt; Mou's moral metaphysics, which includes the natural and ethical universe, attempts to validate morality through the notion of ''tiandao'', the principle of the natural universe, which, for Mou, equates to the moral principle. Further, Mou believes that one's uncomfortable reaction to crime and degeneracy indicates the presence of moral consciousness, which Mou signifies as the inner essence of human beings. This belief, that the infinite within ''benti'' similarly exists within human beings, known as the doctrine of infinite mind, can be compared with Heidegger's acceptance of being-with-others as a feature of Dasein, [[Wittgenstein]]’s rejection of a private language, and [[Husserl]]’s discussion of the immediacy of our recognition of others and their mental states within the lived world.&lt;ref name=Bunnin /&gt;

Subsequently, Mou uses 良知 (''liangzhi'', or good consciousness) and 智的直觉 (''zhi de zhijue'', or intellectual intuition) to identify the substance in his system. Again, Mou chooses to translate his philosophy in Kantian terminology. Here, ''liangzhi'' refers to the foundation or essence of morality. Within Confucianism ''liangzhi'' also means the essence of human beings, explaining why Mou writes that, “the substance of human being is one and the same as that of the world, the world of value, but not the world of reality.” For Mou, this substance is independent of social background. This idea reflects the human nature proposed by [[Mencius]] through the [[Mencius#The Four Beginnings .28or Sprouts.29|example]] of the apparent, innate reaction of an individual to seeing a child sitting precariously on a well (The Four Beginnings). Here, Mou departs from traditional Confucianism by defining the essence of an individual in terms of modern [[individualism]]. Thus with regards to Mencius’ example, it is the very life of the child that evokes a reaction, and not the individual's relation to the child. Mou notes that the basic implications of this example – an individual's inherent benevolence – are consistent with the autonomy of a moral subject.&lt;ref name=Guo /&gt; This autonomy, the motivating force for morality according to Mou, exists within the transcendental and philosophical mind of the individual.&lt;ref name=Guo /&gt;

In accord with his notions of intellectual intuition, Mou is committed to the idea of moral transformation, whereby all individuals can transcend themselves to ultimately become sages.&lt;ref name=Bunnin /&gt; Mou borrows this conception of moral transformation from Confucianism, as well as the concept of ''[[summum bonum]]'', in which there exists a connection between one's worthiness of happiness and the actual attainment of happiness.&lt;ref name=Bunnin /&gt;

===Discussion and criticism of Mou’s philosophy===
Several consequences arise from Mou's moral metaphysics. Some scholars view Mou as a defender of [[Zen Buddhism]] over other critical Buddhisms, pointing to Mou's morality, which, similar to Zen Buddhism, maintains that the possibility of enlightenment is more important than actually attaining it.&lt;ref&gt;• Chan, Wing-cheuk. "Mou Zongsan on Zen Buddhism." Dao 5.1 (2005): 73-88. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, ascribing human beings intellectual intuition ultimately assigns humans moral responsibility. However, this allows individuals access to Kant's [[noumenon]]. According to Mou, intellectual intuition for human beings is the foundation of all of Chinese thought. In ''Phenomena and Noumena'' Mou Zongsan writes that, “if it is true that human beings cannot have intellectual intuition, then the whole of Chinese philosophy must collapse completely”.&lt;ref name = Bunnin /&gt; Despite the fact that this is Mou's claim, many scholars debate its validity, maintaining the legitimacy of Chinese philosophy and New Confucianism independent of intellectual intuition.

Some traditional Confucians reject Mou, citing his wholesale acceptance of Western liberty and democracy as problematic.&lt;ref name=Jiang&gt;• Jiang, Qing. "Chapter 2: From Mind Confucianism to Political Confucianism." The Renaissance of Confucianism in Contemporary China. By Ruiping Fan and Erika Yu.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite Mou's attempt at Confucian Modernity, critics claim that New Confucianism cannot handle modernity's interconnectedness and its inevitable negative consequences.&lt;ref name=Jiang /&gt; Others argue that because Mou is not political, he should not even be considered a Confucian because much of Confucian doctrine advocates for the active pursuit of change.&lt;ref name=Jiang /&gt; However, the [[Censorship in the People's Republic of China|limitations of speech]] in China during the time period when Mou philosophized may address this criticism.

The '''National Organization for Non-Parents''' (N.O.N.) was begun in [[Palo Alto, California]], by [[Ellen Peck]] and Shirley Radl in 1972. N.O.N was formed to advance the notion that people could choose not to have [[children]]--to be [[childfree]]. Changing its name to The '''National Alliance for Optional Parenthood''', it continued into the early 1980s both as a [[support group]] for those making the decision to be childfree and an [[advocacy]] group fighting [[pronatalism]] (attitudes/advertising/etc. promoting or glorifying parenthood). According to its [[bylaw]]s, the purpose of the National Alliance for Optional Parenthood was to educate the [[general public|public]] on non-parenthood as a valid [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]] option, support those who choose not to have children, promote awareness of the [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]] problem, and assist other groups that advanced the goals of the organization.

N.O.N.'s offices were located in [[Reisterstown, Maryland]]; then [[Baltimore, Maryland]]; and, ultimately, in [[Washington, D.C.]]

The organization's most widely distributed publication was "Am I Parent Material?" This publication is still in print and distributed by ETR Associates in [[Scotts Valley, California]].

The '''National Spiritualist Association of Churches''' (NSAC)  is one of the oldest and largest of the [[Spiritualist Church|national Spiritualist church organizations]] in the United States.  The NSAC was formed as the National Spiritualist Association of the United States of America (NSA) in September 1893, during a three-day convention in Chicago, Illinois.  Although American Spiritualists had previously tended to resist institutional or denominational organization, early NSA leaders hoped organization would help promote the truths of the religion both spiritually and practically.&lt;ref&gt;Cora L. V. Richmond in ''Proceedings of the National Delegate Convention of Spiritualists of the United States: Held in Chicago, Illinois, September 27, 28, and 29, 1893'' (Washington, D.

To these reasons, early leaders added the material support of spirit mediums and healers, just as other religious groups provided for the support of their clergy.

Among the NSA's first leaders were W. H. Bach, Harrison D. Barrett (former [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] [[clergymen]]), Luther V. Moulton, [[James Martin Peebles]], and [[Cora L. V. Scott]] ([[spiritualism|spiritualist]] [[mediumship|medium]]).&lt;ref&gt;Association, National Spiritualist. Spiritualist Manual. 7th ed.

''Spiritualist Manual''. 9th ed. (Chicago: Printing Products Corporation, 1955) 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Declaration of Principles==
In 1899, a six-article "Declaration of Principles" was adopted by many Spiritualist groups. Three other articles were added at a later date. By no means do all Spiritualist denominations or individual churches affirm these principles, but because of their historical significance in setting the beliefs of modern Spiritualism, all nine articles are quoted in full below. The influence of [[Unitarianism]] is obvious in the definition of God in principle one.

# We believe in Infinite Intelligence;
# We believe that the phenomena of Nature, both physical and spiritual, are the expression of Infinite Intelligence;
# We affirm that a correct understanding of such expression and living in accordance therewith constitute true religion;
# We affirm that the existence and personal identity of the individual continue after the change called death;
# We affirm that communication with the so-called dead is a fact, scientifically proven by the phenomena of Spiritualism;
# We believe that the highest morality is contained in the Golden Rule: "Do unto others as you would have them do unto you." (''Principles 1-6 adopted in Chicago, Illinois, 1899. Principle 6 revised in Ronkonkorma, New York, 2004.''{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}})
# We affirm the moral responsibility of the individual, and that we make our own happiness or unhappiness as we obey or disobey Nature's physical and spiritual laws;
# We affirm that the doorway to reformation is never closed against any soul here or hereafter; (''Principles 7-8 adopted in Rochester, New York, 1909 and revised in Rochester, New York, 2001.''{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}})
# We affirm that the precept of [[Prophecy]] and [[Healing]] are [[Divinity|Divine]] attributes proven through [[Mediumship]]. (''Principle 9 adopted in St. Louis, Missouri, 1944, revised in Oklahoma City, 1983 and in Westfield, New Jersey, 1998.''{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}})

===Definitions===
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2011}}
Over the years, other statements have been adopted on "What Spiritualism Is and Does" and "Spiritual Healing." A set of "Definitions" has also been approved. The two issues of "reincarnation" and the relation of [[Spiritualism]] to [[Christianity]] have been the major questions dividing Spiritualists. Differing answers to these two questions have split the NSAC on several occasions, and dissent led independent Spiritualists to form their own organizations instead of joining the NSAC. These were adopted in October 1914, 1919, 1930, 1950 during the organization's annual convention.  
* Spiritualism is the Science, Philosophy and Religion of continuous life, based upon the demonstrated fact of communication, by means of mediumship, with those who live in the Spirit World. (1919)
* Spiritualism Is a Science Because it investigates, analyzes and classifies facts and manifestations demonstrated from the spirit side of life.
* Spiritualism Is a Philosophy because it studies the Laws of Nature both on the seen and unseen sides of life and bases its conclusions upon present observed facts. It accepts statements of observed facts of past ages and conclusions drawn therefrom, when sustained by reason and by results of observed facts of the present day.
* Spiritualism Is a Religion because it strives to understand and to comply with the Physical, Mental and Spiritual Laws of Nature, which are the laws of God.
* A Spiritualist is one who believes, as the basis of his or her religion, in the communication between this and the Spirit World by means of mediumship and who endeavors to mould his or her character and conduct in accordance with the highest teachings derived from such communication. (1914, Rev. 1938)
* A Medium is one whose organism is sensitive to vibrations from the spirit world and through whose instrumentality, intelligences in that world are able to convey messages and produce the phenomena of Spiritualism. (1914)
* A Spiritualist Healer is one who, either through one's own inherent powers or through mediumship, is able to impart vital, curative force to pathologic conditions. (1930, 1993)
* The Phenomena of Spiritualism consists of Prophecy, Clairvoyance, Clairaudience, Gift of Tongues, Laying on of Hands, Healing, Visions, Trance, Apports, Levitation, Raps, Automatic and Independent Writings and Paintings, Voice, Materialization, Photography, Psychometry and any other manifestation proving the continuity of life as demonstrated through the Physical and Spiritual senses and faculties of man. (1950)

====Reincarnation====
Reincarnation, gaining popularity through [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophy]], began to find favor among some mediums in the early twentieth century, but was specifically condemned by the NSAC in 1930. The concept of reincarnation has been more recently revisited, and the current policy (2008) is that it is not sufficiently established to include it as a position of the NSAC but further investigation is warranted. In practical terms, this means that reincarnation is not maintained as fact from the podium, but it can be addressed in unofficial gatherings.

====Christianity====
"Are Spiritualists also Christians?" was debated by the NSAC and generally decided in the negative. While the NSAC has drawn heavily on the Christian faith, from which most members came, it identifies its members as Spiritualists. The specifically "[[Spiritualism (beliefs)#Christian_Spiritualism|Christian Spiritualists]]" were found in other bodies such as the Progressive Spiritualist Church&lt;ref name="progressive"&gt;{{cite web|title=Progressive Spiritual Church|url=http://progressivespiritualist.org/AboutSpiritualism.aspx|quote=We consider Jesus the Christ to be our Wayshower and Elder Brother, and embrace the teachings of other Masters, such as the Buddha, Master Lao, and Zoroaster.  We believe that all sacred texts are valid and important.|accessdate=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110825042202/http://progressivespiritualist.org/AboutSpiritualism.aspx|archivedate=2011-08-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Spiritual Church Movement]]. Some Spiritualists differentiate between primitive Christianity, which they believe themselves to be following and practicing, and contemporary [[Orthodoxy|orthodox]] Christianity, which they strictly differentiate from both primitive Christianity and Spiritualism.

==Structure==
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2011}}
The polity of the association is hierarchical. There are loosely organized state associations and an annual national convention. Among Spiritualists, the association has the highest standards for [[ordination]]. The NSAC is noteworthy as the only Spiritualist body to attempt to develop work among youth. The lyceum was originally promoted and shaped by [[Andrew Jackson Davis]] in 1863. Children's materials have been developed and many churches have an active lyceum (Sunday school) program. Such efforts have given the NSAC a stability lacking in most Spiritualist bodies.

==Membership==
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2011}}
Membership: In 2002 the association reported 144 member congregations. There are ten state associations and 11 camps. There were also four affiliated congregations of the National Spiritualist Churches of Canada in Ontario and Quebec.

==Facilities==
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2011}}
The NSAC has two educational auxiliaries, the Morris Pratt Institute in Milwaukee, Wisconsin and The Center for Spiritualist Studies (CSS)in Lily Dale, New York.

[[Morris Pratt]] Institute was built in 1888 of a value assessed at $30,000 at that time. It was 48' wide and 85' long and contained two large auditorium halls, one of which seated nearly 400 people. It was designed by the founder Pratt as a temple and a school for Spiritualism.

At the Ninth Annual convention of the National Spiritualist Association of Churches (NSAC)held in Washington, D.C., Morris and Zulema Pratt presented a letter to the NSAC offering them the property to be utilized "for educational purposes." On November 2, 1901, he filed a petition for incorporation which resulted in the Morris Pratt Institute becoming a corporation managed by nine trustees, two of which were to be members of the National Spiritualist Association and one was to be the President of the Wisconsin State Spiritualist Association. [[Moses Hull]] was the President.

According to legend, it is said that a "Native American spirit guide" had told him of unknown mineral deposits the mining of which Morris Pratt made an investment in. It later became the profitable Ashland Mine of Ironwood, Michigan. Pratt made over $200,000 from his investment and used part of the monies for the benefit of the cause of Spiritualism. In 1889, the Temple was dedicated.

The Center for Spiritualist Studies (CSS) in Lily Dale, New York is located on the grounds of the NSAC-chartered Lily Dale Assembly, the world's largest Spiritualist camp. The CSS is incorporated as a religious [[seminary]] by the [[New York State Board of Regents]]. The goal of the curriculum is the training of Spiritualist [[Clergy]], Teachers, Mediums and [[Healers]].

==The Hydesville Project==
The Fox Property Project started in 1998 when the property was acquired by the NSAC and a memorial park was designed. This was home of the Fox family  and the property in which [[Modern Spiritualism]] began. The site of the Fox cottage in Hydesville, New York is thought to be a treasure for all [[Spiritualists]] and its restoration is supported by the descendants  of the [[Fox sisters]], pioneers at the beginning of [[Modern American Spiritualism]]. The NSAC is involved in fund raising to restore the property and grounds in time for the 160th anniversary of the advent of [[Modern Spiritualism]] (in 2008).

==Publications==
The National Spiritualist Summit (TNS) is the official publication of the National Spiritualist Association of Churches.  It has been continuously published each month since 1919.
The Spotlight is a magazine, published 10 times a year, for Children of all ages produced by the National Spiritualist Association of Churches and maintains a continued emphasis on the progression of Spiritualism through teaching children.

{{Spirituality sidebar}}
'''Neo-Advaita''', also called '''the Satsang-movement'''{{sfn|Caplan|2009|p=17}} and '''[[Nondualism]]''', is a [[New religious movement|New Religious Movement]], emphasizing the direct recognition of the non-existence of the "I" or "ego," without the need of preparatory practice. Its teachings are derived from, but not authorised by, the teachings of the 20th century sage [[Ramana Maharshi]],&lt;ref group=web name="Frawley"&gt;[http://www.vedanet.com/2012/06/misconceptions-about-advaita/ David Frawley, ''Misconceptions about Advaita''. The Mountain Path, Sri Ramanashram]&lt;/ref&gt; as interpreted and popularized by [[H. W. L. Poonja]] and several of his western students.{{sfn|Swartz|2008|p=306-307}}

It is part of a larger religious current called ''[[Immediatism (spirituality)|immediatism]]'' by [[Arthur Versluis]],{{sfn|Versluis|2014}}&lt;ref group=web name="AV-7Q"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scholarblogs.emory.edu/sacredmatters/2015/01/12/seven-questions-for-arthur-versluis/|title=''American Gurus: Seven Questions for Arthur Versluis''|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160417164207/https://scholarblogs.emory.edu/sacredmatters/2015/01/12/seven-questions-for-arthur-versluis/|archivedate=2016-04-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which has its roots in both western and eastern spirituality.{{sfn|Versluis|2014}} Western influences are western esoteric traditions like Transcendentalism, and "[[New Age|New Age millennialism]], self-empowerment and self-therapy".{{sfn|Lucas|2011|p=108-109}}{{sfn|Versluis|2014}}

Neo-Advaita makes little use of the "traditional language or cultural frames of [[Advaita Vedanta]]",{{sfn|Lucas|2011|p=109}} and some have criticised it{{sfn|Lucas|2011|p=110}}{{sfn|Lucas|2014}}{{sfn|Versluis|2014|p=233}} for its lack of preparatory training,{{sfn|Davis|2010|p=48}}{{sfn|Yogani|2011|p=805}}{{refn|group=note|Alan Jacobs: "What Neo-Advaita presents is the seductive formula that 'there is nothing you can do or need to do, all you have to know is that there is no one there.'",{{sfn|Jacobs|2004|p=81}}}} and regard enlightenment-experiences induced by Neo-Advaita as superficial.{{sfn|Marek|2008|p=10, note 6}}{{sfn|Jacobs|2004|p=82}}{{refn|group=note|Frawley: "[I]nstead of looking into the background and full scope of Ramana’s teachings, there is often only a focus only on those of his teachings that seem to promise quick realization for all."&lt;ref group=web name="Frawley"/&gt;}}

==Teachings==
The basic practice of neo-Advaita is [[self-inquiry]], via the question "Who am I?",{{sfn|Lucas|2011|p=96}} or simply the direct recognition of the non-existence of the "I" or "ego." This recognition is taken to be equal to the Advaita Vedanta recognition of the identity of [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]] and [[Brahman]], or the recognition of the "Formless Self." According to neo-Advaitins, no preparatory practice is necessary, nor prolonged study of religious scriptures or tradition: insight alone suffices.&lt;ref group=web name="JF"&gt;[http://www.lifewithoutacentre.com/writings/the-birth-and-death-of-fundamentalism-in-nonduality-and-advaita-teachings/ Jeff Foster, ''The birth and death of fundamentalism in non-duality and Advaita teachings.'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=web name="trap" /&gt;&lt;ref group=web name="Frawley"/&gt;&lt;ref group=web name=Conway/&gt;

Poonja, who is credited as one of the main instigators of the neo-Advaita movement, saw this realization as in itself liberating from karmic consequences and further rebirth. According to Poonja "karmic tendencies remained after enlightenment, [but] the enlightened person was no longer identified with them and, therefor, did not accrue further karmic consequences."{{sfn|Gleig|2013|p=194}} According to Cohen, Poonja "insisted that the realization of the Self had nothing to do with worldly behavior, and he did not believe fully transcending the ego was possible."{{sfn|Gleig|2013|p=194}} For Poonja, ethical standards were based on a dualistic understanding of duality and the notion of an individual agent, and therefore were not indicative of "non-dual enlightenment:{{sfn|Gleig|2013|p=194}} "For Poonja, the goal was the realization of the self; the illusory realm of relative reality was ultimately irrelevant."{{sfn|Gleig|2013|p=194}}

==History==
{{See also|Ramana Maharshi|Self-enquiry}}

According to Lucas{{sfn|Lucas|2011}} and [[David Frawley|Frawley]],&lt;ref group=web name="Frawley"/&gt; the spiritual root of neo-Advaita is Ramana Maharshi, whose teachings, and method of self-inquiry,could easily be transposed to North America’s liberal spiritual subculture.{{sfn|Lucas|2011|p=93}}} Popular interest in Indian religions goes as far back as the early 19th century, and was stimulated by the American [[Transcendentalism|Transcendentalists]]{{sfn|Versluis|2014}} and the [[Theosophical Society]].{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=185-188}}{{sfn|Sinari|2000}} In the 1930s Ramana Maharshi's teachings were brought to the west by [[Paul Brunton]], a Theosophist, in his ''A Search in Secret India''.{{sfn|Lucas|2011|p=99}} Stimulated by [[Arthur Osborne (writer)|Arthur Osborne]], in the 1960s Bhagawat Singh actively started to spread Ramana Maharshi's teachings in the USA.{{sfn|Lucas|2011|p=99}}

Since the 1970s western interest in Asian religions has seen a rapid growth. Ramana Maharshi's teachings have been further popularized in the west via [[H. W. L. Poonja]] and his students.{{sfn|Swartz|2008|p=306-307}}{{sfn|Lucas|2011|p=94}} Poonja, better known as Papaji, "told, inferred, or allowed hundreds of individuals to believe they were fully enlightened simply because they'd had one, or many, powerful experiences of awakening."{{sfn|Caplan|2009|p=16-17}} It were those students who initiated the "neo-Advaita", or "satsang" movement,{{sfn|Caplan|2009|p=16-17}} which has become an important constituent of popular western [[spirituality]].{{sfn|Lucas|2011|p=109}}{{sfn|Versluis|2014}} It is being spread by websites and publishing enterprises, which give an easy access to its teachings.{{sfn|Lucas|2011|p=109}}

==The "Ramana effect"==
{{Main article|Ramana Maharshi|Advaita Vedanta|Nondualism}}
{{See also|Charismatic authority}}

Lucas has called the popularisation of Ramana Maharshi's teachings in the west "the Ramana effect".{{sfn|Lucas|2011|p=96}} According to Lucas, [[Ramana Maharshi]] was the greatest modern proponent of Advaita Vedanta, well known for emphasizing the enquiry of the question "Who am I?" as a means to attain awakening.{{sfn|Lucas|2011|p=96}} According to Lucas, following Thomas Csordas, the success of this movement is due to a "portable practice" and a "transposable message".{{sfn|Lucas|2011|p=96}} Ramana Maharshi's main practice, self-inquiry via the question "Who am I?", is easily practiceable in a non-institutionalized context.{{sfn|Lucas|2011|p=96}} His visitors and devotees did not have to adopt the Vedantic culture, nor to commit themselves to an institution or ideology, to be able to practice self-inquiry.{{sfn|Lucas|2011|p=96}} Ramana's teachings are transposable into a western context. Ramana Maharshi himself did not demand a shift in religious affiliation, and was himself acquainted with western religions, using quotes from the Bible.{{sfn|Lucas|2011|p=96}} Neo-Advaita teachers have further deemphasized the traditional language and worldframe of Advaita, using a modern, psychologized worldframe to present their teachings as a form of self-help, which is easily accessible to a larger audience.{{sfn|Lucas|2011|p=97}}

==Western discourses==
{{See also|New Age|Perennial philosophy|Orientalism|Nonduality}}

The western approach to "Asian enlightenment traditions"{{sfn|Gleig|2011|p=9}} is highly eclectic, drawing on various Asian traditions, as well as "numerous Western discourses such as psychology, science, and politics."{{sfn|Gleig|2011|p=9}} Neo-Advaita uses western discourses, such as "[[New Age|New Age millennialism]], [[Zen]], self-empowerment and self-therapy"{{sfn|Lucas|2011|p=108-109}} to transmit its teachings. It makes little use of the "traditional language or cultural frames of Advaita Vedanta,"{{sfn|Lucas|2011|p=109}} and is framed in a western construction of experiential and perennial mysticism,{{sfn|Gleig|2011|p=5}} "to the disregard of its social, ethical and political aspects."{{sfn|Gleig|2011|p=5}} This "modern experiential and perennialist mystical framework" emphasizes  [[Perennial philosophy|Perennialism]], the idea that there is a common, mystical core to all religions, which can be empirically validated by [[Religious experience|personal experience]]. It has pervaded the western understanding of Asian religions, and can be found in [[Swami Vivekananda]] and [[Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan]]'s [[Neo-Vedanta]], but also in the works of [[D.T. Suzuki]] and his "decontextualized and experiential account" of [[Zen Buddhism]].{{sfn|Gleig|2011|p=5}} It can also be found in the [[Theosophical Society]], and the contemporary [[New Age]] culture, with influences like [[Aldous Huxley|Aldous Huxley's]] ''[[The Perennial Philosophy]]'' and ''[[The Doors of Perception]]'', and writers like [[Ken Wilber]].{{sfn|Gleig|2011|p=5-6}}{{refn|group=note|See also Sharf's "Buddhist Modernism and the Rhetoric of Meditative Experience".{{sfn|Sharf|1995}}}}

Gregg Lahood also mentions Neo-Advaita as an ingredient of "cosmological hybridization, a process in which spiritual paradises are bound together",{{sfn|Lahood|2010|p=31}} as exemplified in American Transcendentalism, [[New Age]], [[transpersonal psychology]] and the works of [[Ken Wilber]] are examples:{{sfn|Lahood|2010|p=33}} Brown and Leledaki place this "hybridization" in a [[Structuralism|"structurationist"]] approach,{{sfn|Brown|Leledaki|2010|p=127}} pointing out that this is an "invented tradition", which is a response to a novel situation, although it claims a continuity with a "historic past", which is "largely facticious."{{sfn|Brown|Leledaki|2010|p=127}} Brown and Leledaki see these newly emerging traditions as part of western [[Orientalism]], the fascination of western cultures with eastern cultures, but also the reduction of "Asian societies, its people, practices and cultures to essentialist images of the 'other'".{{sfn|Brown|Leledaki|2010|p=129}} Brown and Leledaki also note that this Orientalism is not a one-way affair, but that "there has been a dynamic interaction between Asian and Western representatives of various religious traditions over the last 150 years," and that this "blending of thought and practice" is a co-creation from modernist religious movements in both East and West.{{sfn|Brown|Leledaki|2010|p=131}}{{refn|group=note|See also the influence of the [[Theosophical Society]] on Theravada Buddhism and the [[Vipassana movement]],{{sfn|Gombrich|1996}} and the influence of the Theosophical Society and western modernism on [[Buddhist modernism]],{{sfn|McMahan|2008}} especially [[D. T. Suzuki]].}}

According to [[Arthur Versluis]], neo-Advaita is part of a larger religious current which he calls ''immediatism'',{{sfn|Versluis|2014}}&lt;ref group=web name="AV-7Q"/&gt; "the assertion of immediate spiritual illumination without much if any preparatory practice within a particular religious tradition."&lt;ref group=web name="AV-7Q"/&gt; Its origins predate American [[Transcendentalism]].&lt;ref group=web name="AV-7Q"/&gt; In ''American Gurus: From Transcendentalism to New Age Religion'', Versluis describes the emergence of immediatist gurus: gurus who are not connected to any of the traditional religions, and promise instant enlightenment and liberation.{{sfn|Versluis|2014|p=1,2}} These include [[Eckhart Tolle]], [[Ram Dass]], and [[Andrew Cohen (spiritual teacher)|Andrew Cohen]].{{sfn|Versluis|2014|p=1}} "Immediatism" refers to "a religious assertion of spontaneous, direct, unmediated spiritual insight into reality (typically with little or no prior training), which some term [[Enlightenment (spirituality)|"enlightenment"]]."{{sfn|Versluis|2014|p=2}} According to Versluis, immediatism is typical for Americans, who want "the fruit of religion, but not its obligations."&lt;ref group=web name="AV-7Q" /&gt; Although immediatism has its roots in European culture and history{{sfn|Versluis|2014|p=2}} as far back as [[Platonism]],{{sfn|Versluis|2014|p=3}} and also includes [[Perennial philosophy|Pernnialism]],{{sfn|Versluis|2014|p=4}} Versluis points to [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] as its key ancestor,{{sfn|Versluis|2014|p=2}} who "emphasized the possibility of immediate, direct spiritual knowledge and power."{{sfn|Versluis|2014|p=3}}

==Criticism==
Neo-Advaita has been called a "controversial movement,"&lt;ref group=web name="ConwayNondualSpirituality"&gt;[http://www.enlightened-spirituality.org/nondual-spirituality.html Timothy Conway, ''Nondual Spirituality or Mystical Advaita'']&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Michaelson|2009|p=79}} and has been criticized,{{sfn|Lucas|2011|p=110}}{{sfn|Lucas|2014}}{{refn|group=note|Lucas: ... serious critiques leveled at Neo-Advaitins by more traditional Advaitins in India and North America. Disputes over the authenticity of a transposed tradition are a commonplace in the history of missionization and the spread of traditions across cultures.{{sfn|Lucas|2011|p=110}}}}{{sfn|Versluis|2014|p=233}} for its emphasis on insight alone, omitting the preparatory practices.&lt;ref group=web name=Conway&gt;[http://www.enlightened-spirituality.org/neo-advaita.html Timothy Conway, ''Neo-Advaita or Pseudo-Advaita and Real Advaita-Nonduality'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=web name=Swartz&gt;[http://www.advaita.org.uk/discourses/trad_neo/neo_vedanta_swartz.htm James Swartz, ''What is Neo-Advaita?'']&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|David Frawley: "The teachings of Ramana Maharshi are often the starting point for neo-Advaitic teachers, though other influences also exist in the movement. However, instead of looking into the background and full scope of Ramana’s teachings, there is often only a focus only on those of his teachings that seem to promise quick realization for all."&lt;ref group=web name="Frawley"/&gt;}} It has also been criticised for its references to a "lineage" of Ramana Maharshi, whereas Ramana never claimed to have disciples{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} and never appointed any successors.&lt;ref group=web name="jd6" /&gt;&lt;ref group=web name="MilchCow" /&gt;

===Insight and practice===

====Insight alone is not enough====

Some critics say that seeing through the [[Ahamkara|'illusion of ego']] is the main point of neo-Advaita, and that this does not suffice.&lt;ref group=web name="trap"&gt;[http://www.spiritualteachers.org/neo_advaita_article.htm Spiritualteachers.org (Author unknown), ''"Neo-Advaita Demystified"'']&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|"Traditional Advaita says that the ego is an illusion. The ‘Satsang Prophets’ emphasize this as THE starting point, completely omitting that this realization may only occur at the end of years of self-inquiry and work on oneself (and not necessarily with any certainty). Once this premise is understood and the self-cheating is engaged, one obtains a constant very pleasant feeling of superiority and invulnerability. This is what they regard as being the ultimate accomplishment."&lt;ref group=web name="trap" /&gt;}} According to Caplan, the enlightenment-experiences induced by these teachers and their satsangs are considered to be superficial.{{sfn|Caplan|2009|p=17}}

Some teachers, like Jeff Foster and Andrew Cohen, have admitted that their own insight or "awakening" did not put an end to being a human being with personal, and even egoistical, feelings, aspirations and fears.&lt;ref group=web name="AC"&gt;[http://www.andrewcohen.org/blog/open-letter-all-my-former-students-upon-return-my-sabbatical Andrew Cohen, ''An open letter to all my students upon return from my sabbatical''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150515000000/http://www.andrewcohen.org/blog/open-letter-all-my-former-students-upon-return-my-sabbatical |date=2015-05-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.lifewithoutacentre.com/writings/the-birth-and-death-of-fundamentalism-in-nonduality-and-advaita-teachings/ Jeff Foster, ''The birth and death of fundamentalism in nonduality and Advaita teachings.'']&lt;/ref&gt; Cohen admitted that this [[spiritual bypass]] even resulted in the mental abuse of some of his students.&lt;ref group=web name="AC" /&gt;

====Practice is necessary====

According to Dennis Waite, neo-Advaita claims to remove ignorance, but does not offer help to remove ignorance.&lt;ref group=web name=Waite&gt;[http://www.nondualitymagazine.org/nonduality_magazine.denniswaite.interview.htm Non-Duality Magazine, ''Dennis Waite. Interview with Non-Duality Magazine'']&lt;/ref&gt; According to Caplan, traditional Advaita Vedanta takes years of practice, which is quite different from the neo-Advaita claims.{{sfn|Caplan|2009|p=17}} Classical Advaita Vedanta uses the [[Jnana Yoga|"fourfold discipline"]] (''sādhana-catustaya''){{sfn|Puligandla|1997|p=253}} to train students and attain [[moksha]]. Years of committed practice is needed to sever or destroy the "occlusion"{{sfn|Jacobs|2004|p=84}} the so-called "[[Vāsanā|vasanas]],&lt;ref group=web name=Swartz/&gt; [[Sanskara (Hinduism)|samskaras]], [[Kosha|bodily sheaths]] and [[vritti]]s", and the "granthi{{refn|group=note|See [http://www.advaita.org.uk/discourses/durga/heartknot_durga.htm The Knot of the Heart]}} or knot forming identification between [[Brahman|Self]] and mind,"{{sfn|Jacobs|2004|p=85}} and prepare the mind for the insight into non-duality.&lt;ref group=web name=Swartz/&gt;{{refn|group=note|Swartz: "Traditional Vedanta completely [...] insists that a person be discriminating, dispassionate, calm of mind, and endowed with a ‘burning’ desire for liberation along with other secondary qualifications like devotion, faith, perseverance and so on. In other words it requires a mature adult with a one-pointed desire to know the Self."&lt;ref group=web name=Swartz/&gt;}}{{refn|group=note|Jacobs: "The main Neo-Advaita fallacy ignores the fact that there is an occlusion or veiling formed by vasanas, samskaras, bodily sheaths and vrittis, and there is a granthi or knot forming identification between Self and mind, which has to be severed [...] The Maharshi's remedy to this whole trap is persistent effective [[Self-enquiry]], and/or complete [[Bhakti|unconditional surrender]] of the 'phantom ego' to Self or God, until the granthi is severed, the vasanas are rendered harmless like a burned out rope.{{sfn|Jacobs|2004|p=84-85}}&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ramana Maharshi:"Therefore, leaving the corpse-like body as an actual corpse and remaining without even uttering the word 'I' by mouth, if one now keenly enquires, 'What is it that rises as "I"?’ then in the Heart a certain soundless sphurana, 'I-I', will shine forth of its own accord. It is an awareness that is single and undivided, the thoughts which are many and divided having disappeared. If one remains still without leaving it, even the sphurana – having completely annihilated the sense of the individuality, the form of the ego, 'I am the body' – will itself in the end subside, just like the flame that catches the camphor. This alone is said to be liberation by great ones and scriptures.

===Lineage===
{{See also|Sampradaya|Guru-shishya tradition}}

Western critics object to the perceived relation between Ramana Maharshi and Neo-Advaita,{{refn|group=note|James Swartz: "Then in the Eighties the Western spiritual world became reacquainted with Ramana Maharshi [...] The rediscovery of Ramana roughly coincided with the rise of ‘Neo-Advaita.’ Neo-Advaita is basically a ‘satsang’ based ‘movement’ that has very little in common with either traditional Vedanta or modern Vedanta or even its inspiration, Ramana [...] except the doctrine of non-duality."&lt;ref group=web name=Swartz/&gt;}} noting that Ramana never promoted any lineage,{{refn|group=note|"There have been many senior devotees of Bhagavan who, in their own right, had both the ability and authority to teach in his name. Muruganar, Sadhu Natanananda and Kunju Swami are some of those who immediately spring to mind. None of them to my knowledge ever claimed pre-eminence and the prerogative to teach. They knew two things. One, there would be many who would bow to their superior knowledge and set them up as an independent source, but secondly, they also knew that to abrogate for themselves the privilege would run contrary to Bhagavan’s mission or purpose."}} did not publicize himself as a guru,{{sfn|Forsthoefel|2005|p=37}} never claimed to have disciples,{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} and never appointed any successors.&lt;ref group=web name="jd6"&gt;[http://davidgodman.org/rteach/jd6.shtml John David, ''An Introduction to Sri Ramana's Life and Teachings.

Each of us legitimately can claim lineage from Bhagavan although he himself was not part of any succession but stood alone, and in that sense of linear continuity he neither received nor gave initiation. But that is not the point, because though we each have the right to receive his grace, it is entirely different when it comes to assuming authority to disseminate the teachings. It is here we need to be very clear and separate the claims of wannabe gurus from the genuine devotees who are grateful recipients of grace."}} Despite this, there are numerous contemporary teachers who assert, suggest, or are said by others, to be in his lineage.{{sfn|Lucas|2011}}&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.advaita.org.uk/teachers/ramana_parampara.htm Advaita Vision, ''Disciples of Ramana Maharshi'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=web name="rs2"&gt;[http://davidgodman.org/interviews/rs2.shtml Rob Sacks, ''An Interview with David Godman.

===Response===
In response to those criticisms, Tony Parsons has written that classical Advaita Vedanta "is just another established religion with a proliferation of teachings and literature, all of which very successfully and consistently miss the mark," qualifying it as "one of the many systems of personal indoctrination promising the eventual spiritual fulfilment."&lt;ref group=web name="TP"&gt;[http://www.advaita.org.uk/discourses/trad_neo/neo_parsons.htm Tony Parsons, ''The Divine Misconception: Traditional Advaita (Oneness) versus Neo-Advaita'']&lt;/ref&gt; According to Parsons, classical Advaita Vedanta "has no relevance to liberation because it is born out of a fundamental misconception," namely that there is something like a separate individual who can become enlightened.&lt;ref group=web name="TP" /&gt; According to Parsons, this is "a direct denial of abiding oneness (Advaita)."&lt;ref group=web name="TP" /&gt;{{refn|group=note|See [http://www.advaita.org.uk/discourses/trad_neo/truth_spoon.htm Nathan Spoon, ''Truth is Tenable.

==Biography==
Ke was born in the village of [[Trao Nha]] in [[Can Lộc District]] in [[Hà Tĩnh Province]]. His family had a rich tradition of leadership in the imperial service, and his father was the high level [[mandarin (bureaucrat)|mandarin]] of the [[Nguyễn dynasty]]. Ke made a promising start towards emulating his forefathers, and passed the metropolitan exams in 1901. However, he did not head for the final tier of examinations, the palace examinations, and instead returned directly to his home province to teach. During his spare time, he also studied some contemporary Chinese modern learning (tan hoc) books that he had obtained in Huế. Scholars believe that early in his career, he had contact with [[Phan Bội Châu]], the leading Vietnamese nationalist anti-colonial figure of the time, which was believed to have occurred through their mutual friend [[Dang Nguyen Can]]. However, Ke was most influenced by the ideas of the Chinese reformists [[K'ang Yu-wei]] and [[Lian Chi'chao]], particular in the advocacy of the modernisation of the education system. He also was one of the main figures who advocated scholar gentry initiative in the opening of Vietnamese commercial businesses as a means of raising funds and awareness of their cause.&lt;ref&gt;Marr, p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1908, the French launched a general crackdown on the scholar gentry anti-colonial movement, and Ke was one of the ones rounded up. He was sent to [[Côn Sơn Island]], where there was jail specifically for detaining independence activists.&lt;ref&gt;Marr, p. 195.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ke was released from prison in 1921 after thirteen years in prison. He took up residence in [[Hanoi]], where he edited a low scale periodical, the ''Huu Thanh''. Ke earned a reputation for standing outside his office, observantly watching the vehicles roll past, the students in European dress and the women in high heels. Despite this, he declared that he was in favor of meaningful modern civilisation.&lt;ref&gt;Marr, p. 251.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ke also derided the way that Vietnamese employees of the French colonial system squabbled among themselves over their personal status and standing. He felt that the attention to hierarchical decorum was excessive and regressive.&lt;ref name="m252"&gt;Marr, p. 252.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ke advocated the adoption of the Romanised [[quốc ngữ]] to replace the [[chữ nôm]] script used in Vietnam for writing. He was unlike many of his contemporaries in feeling that eh educational emphasis was not in translating old Vietnamese literature into quốc ngữ but for the introduction of European scientific, political, economic and legal knowledge to be put into quốc ngữ. He called for quốc ngữ to appeal to the needs of the wider populace, rather than only classical traditional scholars who were focused on literature. In one case, he strongly criticised the view of the mandarin [[Phạm Quỳnh]], who strongly praised [[Nguyễn Du]]'s epic romantic poem, ''[[The Tale of Kiều]]'', which is widely considered as Vietnam's national poem. Quỳnh saw the ''Kieu'' as the soul and essence of Vietnam. Quynh felt that if the literature of Vietnam survived, then so would the language and thus the country. Ke felt the opposites, reasoning that the survival of the people was the only way to safeguard the language and thus the literary heritage.&lt;ref name="m252"/&gt;

Most cities in Vietnam, regardless of the political orientation of the government, have named major streets after him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Vietnam Country Map |publisher=Periplus Travel Maps |year=2002&amp;ndash;03 |isbn=0-7946-0070-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3221">The '''philosophy of film''' is a branch of [[aesthetics]] within the discipline of [[philosophy]] that seeks to understand the most basic questions regarding [[film]]. Philosophy of film has significant overlap with [[film theory]], a branch of [[film studies]].

== History ==
The earliest person to explore philosophical questions regarding film was [[Hugo Münsterberg]]. During the [[silent film]] era, he sought to understand what it was about film that made it conceptually distinct from theater. He concluded that the use of close-ups, flash-backs, and edits were unique to film and constituted its nature.

[[Rudolf Arnheim]], with the beginning of the era of sound for film, argued that the silent film era was aesthetically superior to the "talkies". He held that by adding sound to previously silent moving images, the unique status of film had been removed. Instead of being a unique art form that could carefully study bodies in motion, film had become merely a combination of two other art forms.

[[André Bazin]], contrary to Arnheim, held that whether or not a film has sound is largely irrelevant. He believed that film, due mainly to its foundation in and relationship with photography, had a realist aspect to it. He argued that film has the ability to capture the real world. The film ''[[Waking Life]]'' also features a discussion of the philosophy of film where the theories of Bazin are emphasized. In it, the character waxes philosophic that every moment of film is capturing an aspect of [[God]].

[[American philosopher]] [[Noël Carroll]] has argued that the earlier characterizations of film made by philosophers too narrowly defined the nature of film and that they incorrectly conflated aspects of genres of films with film in general.

Aspects of Bazin's realist theories have been accepted by philosophers in spite of Carroll's critique. The ''transparency thesis'', which says that film is a medium transparent to true reality, has been accepted by [[Kendall Walton]].

'''Renato Corti''' (born 1 March 1936) is an Italian [[Cardinal (Catholic Church)|cardinal]] and [[prelate]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. He was Bishop of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Novara|Novara]] from 1990 to 2011. Pope Francis raised Corti to the rank of cardinal at a [[Papal consistory|consistory]] on 19 November 2016.

==Early years==
Renato Corti was born in [[Galbiate]] in the [[province of Lecco]], part of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Milan|Archdiocese of Milan]] on 1 March 1936. He studied at the seminary in Milan and was ordained on 28 July 1959 by Cardinal Giovanni Battista Montini (later [[Pope Paul VI]]). His assignments included serving as parrochial vicar of the Oratory of [[Caronno Pertusella]] from 19959 to 1967, spiritual director at the College of [[Gorla Minore]] from 1967 to 1969, spiritual director of the archdiocesan seminary of [[Saronno]] from 1969 to 1977. He then became rector for theology at that seminary. He became vicar general of the Milan Archdiocese in November 1980.

==Episcopacy==
Pope John Paul II named him auxiliary bishop of the Archdiocese of Milan on 30 April 1981 and titular bishop of [[Mauretania#Episcopal sees|Zallata]]. He received his episcopal ordination on 6 June 1981 from Archbishop [[Carlo Maria Martini]], with Bishops [[Libero Tresoldi]] and [[Bernardo Citterio]] as co-consecrators. The same pope named him Bishop of Novara on 19 December 1990 to succeed [[Aldo Del Monte]], and he was installed on 3 March 1991.

In November 2007, a few months after Pope Benedict XVI issued rules about the use of the [[Extraordinary form of the Roman Rite|Tridentine Mass]], three priests in the Novara diocese refused to celebrate Sunday Mass if they were not allowed to use the traditional Tridentine form exclusively. Corti suspended them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Owen|first=Richard|title=First parish to offer Mass in the Tridentine rite opens in Rome|url= http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/faith/article4098089.ece|accessdate=21 December 2010|newspaper=[[The Times]]|date=9 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Italian bishop suspends priests for insisting on Latin Mass|url=http://www.catholicculture.org/news/features/index.cfm?recnum=54959|publisher=CatholicCulture|accessdate=21 December 2010|date=26 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Bishop of Novara he served terms as vice president of the Italian Bishops Conference (2000 to 2005) and vice president of the Regional Bishops Conference of Piedmont. He also held assignments in the [[Roman Curia]] as a member of the [[Congregation for the Oriental Churches]] and the [[Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples]].

[[Pope Benedict XVI]] accept his resignation as bishop of Novara on 24 November 2011. In retirement he has continued to lead spiritual exercises for both religious and lay groups. He lives at [[Rho, Lombardy|Rho]], near the college of the [[Ambrosians#Oblates of St. Ambrose and of St. Charles|Oblates of St. Ambrose and St. Charles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Diventa cardinale l'ex vescovo di Novara Renato Corti|url=http://www.lastampa.it/2016/10/09/edizioni/verbania/diventa-cardinale-lex-vescovo-di-novara-renato-corti-cdjLpBdUEDP8csQcNJPHkJ/pagina.html|accessdate=18 November 2016|work=La Stampa|date=10 October 2016| language=it}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Corti is known for his work as a spiritual director. Pope John Paul II asked him to lead his Lenten retreat in 2005 and at the invitation of Pope Francis he wrote the meditations used at the [[Stations of the Cross]] at Rome's [[Colosseum]] in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last1=Glatz|first1=Carol|title=Way of Cross takes Jesus' point of view to help others carry crosses|url=http://www.catholicnews.com/services/englishnews/2015/way-of-cross-takes-jesus-point-of-view-to-help-others-carry-crosses.cfm|accessdate=18 November 2016|agency =Catholic News Service|date=20 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite document| url=http://www.vatican.va/news_services/liturgy/2015/documents/ns_lit_doc_20150403_via-crucis-meditazioni_en.html | date=3 April 2015| title= Way of the Cross Led by His Holiness Pope Francis| publisher= Office for the Liturgical Celebrations of the Supreme Pontiff |accessdate = 18 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pope Francis raised Corti to the rank of cardinal at a consistory held on 19 November 2016. Having passed the age of 80, Corti is not eligible to participate in a papal conclave. He was given the rank of Cardinal-Priest and assigned the titular church of [[San Giovanni a Porta Latina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Il vescovo di Novara Renato Corti è diventato cardinale|url=http://www.lastampa.it/2016/11/19/edizioni/verbania/cronaca/il-vescovo-renato-corti-stato-creato-cardinale-xRrCRiRVbCtJDmTn6rsJaO/pagina.html|accessdate=19 November 2016| language=it |work=La Stampa|date=19 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sebastian Petrycy''' of [[Pilzno]] (1554–1626) was a [[Poland|Polish]] [[philosopher]] and [[physician]]. He lectured and published notable works in the field of medicine but is principally remembered for his masterly Polish translations of philosophical works by [[Aristotle]] and for his commentaries to them. Petrycy made major contributions to nascent Polish philosophical terminology.&lt;ref&gt;"Petrycy Sebastian, ''Encyklopedia Polski'' (Encyclopedia of Poland), p. 496.&lt;/ref&gt;
  
==Life==
Sebastian Petrycy received his [[Master of Arts]] degree at [[Jagiellonian University|Kraków]] in 1573 and his [[doctor of medicine]] degree at [[University of Padua|Padua]] in 1590.&lt;ref&gt;"Petrycy Sebastian, ''Encyklopedia Polski'' (Encyclopedia of Poland), p. 496.&lt;/ref&gt;

Petrycy published his Polish [[translation]]s of [[Aristotle]]'s practical works, the ''Ethics'', ''Politics'' and ''Economics'', together with his own extensive commentaries. In these, he laid stress, in the [[theory of knowledge]], on [[experiment]] and [[inductive reasoning|induction]]; in [[psychology]], on [[feeling]] and [[Will (philosophy)|will]]; and in [[politics]], he preached [[democracy|democratic]] ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, ''Zarys...'', pp. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; The focus of his thought was practical philosophy, [[ethics]] and [[politics]]. His interest in practical questions and his linking of philosophical theory with the needs of national life was a feature  common to Petrycy and to leading Polish thinkers of periods that were to follow.&lt;ref&gt;[[Władysław Tatarkiewicz]], ''Historia filozofii'' (History of Philosophy), volume two, p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1601-18, a period when [[translation]]s into [[modern language]]s were still rarities, he accomplished masterful translations of [[Aristotle]]'s practical works into [[Polish language|Polish]].  With Petrycy, [[vernacular]] Polish philosophical [[terminology]] began to develop not much later than did the French and German.&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, ''Zarys...'', pp. 9–10.&lt;/ref&gt; This was an auspicious beginning, but would be neglected in the 17th and 18th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;[[Władysław Tatarkiewicz]], ''Historia filozofii'' (History of Philosophy), volume two, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

Petrycy practiced medicine in [[Lviv|Lwów]] and at the side of ''[[Voivode|Wojewoda]]'' [[Jerzy Mniszech]], whom he accompanied to [[Moscow]] in 1606.&lt;ref&gt;"Petrycy Sebastian, ''Encyklopedia Polski'' (Encyclopedia of Poland), p. 496.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1608–17 Petrycy lectured in medicine at the [[Kraków Academy]].&lt;ref&gt;"Petrycy Sebastian, ''Encyklopedia Polski'' (Encyclopedia of Poland), p. 496.&lt;/ref&gt; His medical writings, which included ''De natura, causis, symptomatis morbi gallici eiusque curatione...,''&lt;ref&gt;''On the Nature, Cause, Symptoms of Gall-Bladder Disease and Its Treatment...''&lt;/ref&gt; combined deductive reasoning with observation and experiment. An educator and practicing physician, he worked especially among the poor populace.&lt;ref&gt;"Petrycy Sebastian z Pilzna," ''Encyklopedia Powszechna PWN'' (PWN Universal Encyclopedia), vol. 3, p. 501.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
''Suhraward'' is a village located between the present-day towns of [[Zanjan (city)|Zanjan]] and [[Bijar (city)|Bijar Garrus]] in [[Iran]], where Suhrawardi was born in 1154.&lt;ref name="Edward Craig, Routledge"/&gt; He learned wisdom and jurisprudence in [[Maragheh]] (located today in the [[East Azarbaijan Province]] of [[Iran]]). His teacher was [[Majd al-Dīn Jīlī]] who was also Imam [[Fakhr Razi]]’s teacher. He then went to [[Iraq]] and [[Syria]] for several years and developed his knowledge while he was there.

His life spanned a period of less than forty years during which he produced a series of works that established him as the founder of a new school of philosophy, called "Illuminism" (''hikmat al-Ishraq''). According to [[Henry Corbin]], Suhrawardi "came later to be called the Master of Illumination (''Shaikh-i-Ishraq'') because his great aim was the renaissance of ancient [[Iranian people|Iranian]] wisdom".&lt;ref&gt;H.Corbin, ''Spiritual Body and Celestial Earth (From Mazdean Iran to Shi'ite Iran), translated from French by Nancy Pearson, Princeton, 1977. (1:Paris, 1960), pg. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; which Corbin specifies in various ways as the "project of reviving the [[Ancient philosophy#Ancient Iranian philosophy|philosophy of ancient Persia]]".&lt;ref&gt;Henry Corbin. The Voyage and the Messenger. Iran and Philosophy. Containing previous unpublished articles and lectures from 1948 to 1976. North Atlantic Books. Berkeley, California. 1998. {{ISBN|1-55643-269-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1186, at the age of thirty-two, he completed his magnum opus, ''The Philosophy of Illumination.''

There are several contradictory reports of his death. The most commonly held view is that he was executed sometime between 1191 and 1208 in [[Aleppo]] on charges of cultivating [[Batiniyya|Batini]] teachings and philosophy, by the order of al-Malik al-Zahir, son of [[Saladin]].&lt;ref name="Dabashi115" /&gt; Other traditions hold that he starved himself to death, others tell that he was suffocated or thrown from the wall of the fortress, then burned.&lt;ref&gt;Muḥammad Kamāl, ''Mulla Sadra's transcendent philosophy'', Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2006 (p.13)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Teachings==

{{unref-sect|date=January 2016}}

Arising out of [[peripatetic philosophy]] as developed by [[Ibn Sina]] (Avicenna), Suhrawardi's illuminationist philosophy is critical of several of Ibn Sina's positions and radically departs from him in creating a symbolic language (mainly derived from ancient Iranian culture or ''Farhang-e Khosravani'') to give expression to his wisdom (''hikma'').

Suhrawardi taught a complex and profound [[emanationist]] [[esoteric cosmology|cosmology]], in which all creation is a successive outflow from the original Supreme Light of Lights (''Nur al-Anwar''). The fundamental of his philosophy is pure immaterial light, where nothing is manifest, and which unfolds from the Light of Lights in a descending order of ever-diminishing intensity and, through complex interaction, gives rise to a "horizontal" array of lights, similar in conception to [[Platonic forms]], that governs mundane reality. In other words, the universe and all levels of existence are but varying degrees of Light—light and darkness. In his division of bodies, he categorizes objects in terms of their reception or non-reception of light.

Suhrawardi considers a previous existence for every soul in the angelic realm before its descent to the realm of the body. The soul is divided into two parts, one remains in heaven and the other descends into the dungeon of the body. The human soul is always sad because it has been divorced from its other half. Therefore, it aspires to become reunited with it. The soul can only reach felicity again when it is united with its celestial part, which has remained in heaven. He holds that the soul should seek felicity by detaching itself from its tenebrous body and worldly matters and access the world of immaterial lights. The souls of the gnostics and saints, after leaving the body, ascend even above the angelic world to enjoy proximity to the Supreme Light, which is the only absolute Reality.

Suhrawardi elaborated the neo-Platonic idea of an independent intermediary world, the imaginal world (''ʿalam-i mithal''  عالم مثال). His views have exerted a powerful influence down to this day, particularly through [[Mulla Sadra]]’s combined peripatetic and illuminationist description of reality.

==Influence==
Suhrawardi's Illuminationist project was to have far-reaching consequences for Islamic philosophy in Shi'ite Iran. His teachings had a strong influence on subsequent [[esoteric]] Iranian thought and the idea of “Decisive Necessity” is believed to be one of the most important innovations in the history of logical philosophical speculation, stressed by the majority of [[Muslim]] logicians and philosophers. In the 17th century, it was to initiate an Illuminationist [[Zoroastrian]] revival in the figure of the 16th century sage [[Azar Kayvan]].

==Suhrawardi and pre-Islamic Iranian thought==
Suhrawardi thought of himself as a reviver or resuscitator of the ancient Persian wisdom.&lt;ref name="Henry Corbin 1998"/&gt;  He states in ''Hikmat al-'Ishraq'' that:{{cquote|There was among the ancient Persians a community of people guided by God who thus walked the true way, worthy Sage-Philosophers, with no resemblance to the Magi (Dualists).  It is their precious philosophy of Light, the same as that to which the mystical experience of Plato and his predecessors bear witness, that we have revived in our book called ''Illuminationist Philosophy (Hikmat al-'Ishraq)'', and I have had no precursor in the way of such project.}}

Suhrawardi uses pre-Islamic Iranian gnosis, synthesizing it with Greek and Islamic wisdom.  The main influence from pre-Islamic Iranian thought on Suhrawardi is in the realm of angelology and cosmology.  He believed that the ancient Persians' wisdom was shared by Greek philosophers such as Plato as well as by the Egyptian Hermes and considered his philosophy of illumination a rediscovery of this ancient wisdom.  According to Nasr, Suhrawardi provides an important link between the thought of pre-Islamic and post-Islamic Iran and a harmonious synthesis between the two. And [[Henry Corbin]] states: "In northwestern Iran, Sohravardi (d. 1191) carried out the great project of reviving the wisdom or theosophy of ancient pre-Islamic Zoroastrian Iran."&lt;ref&gt;Henry Corbin. The Man of Light in Iranian Sufism. Omega Publications, New York. 1994. {{ISBN|0-930872-48-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his work ''Alwah Imadi'', Suhrawardi offers an esoteric interpretation of [[Ferdowsi]]'s ''Epic of Kings'' (''Shah Nama'')&lt;ref name="Razavi"&gt;Amin Razavi, M. (1997) Suhrawardi and the School of Illumination, Richmond: Curzon Press.&lt;/ref&gt; in which figures such as [[Fereydun]], Zahak, Kay Khusraw&lt;ref name="Razavi"/&gt; and Jamshid are seen as manifestations of the divine light. [[Seyyed Hossein Nasr]] states: "Alwah 'Imadi is one of the most brilliant works of Suhrawardi in which the tales of ancient Persia and the wisdom of gnosis of antiquity in the context of the esoteric meaning of the Quran have been synthesized".&lt;ref name="Razavi"/&gt;

In this Persian work ''Partaw Nama'' and his main Arabic work ''Hikmat al-Ishraq'', Suhrawardi makes extensive use of [[Zoroastrian]] symbolism&lt;ref name="Razavi"/&gt; and his elaborate angelology is also based on Zoroastrian models.&lt;ref name="Razavi"/&gt;  The supreme light he calls both by its Quranic and Mazdean names, ''al-nur al-a'zam'' (the Supreme Light) and ''Vohuman'' (''Bahman'').  Suhrawardi refers to the ''hukamayya-fars'' (Persian philosophers) as major practitioners of his ''Ishraqi'' wisdom and considers [[Zoroaster]], [[Jamasp]], Goshtasp, [[Kay Khusraw]], Frashostar and [[Bozorgmehr]] as possessors of this ancient wisdom.

Among pre-Islamic Iranian symbols and concepts used by Suhrawardi are: ''minu'' (incorporeal world), ''giti'' (corporeal world), ''Surush'' (messenger, Gabriel), ''[[Farvardin]]'' (the lower world), ''gawhar'' (pure essence), ''Bahram'', ''Hurakhsh'' (the Sun), ''shahriyar'' (archetype of species), ''isfahbad'' (light in the body), ''Amordad'' (Zoroastrian angel), ''Shahrivar'' (Zoroastrian angel), and the ''Kiyani [[Khvarenah]]''.

With regards to the pre-Islamic Iranian concept of [[Khvarenah]] (glory), Suhrawardi mentions:&lt;ref&gt;Hossein Ziai, "The book of radiance", Mazda Publisher, 1998.  pg 84-85.  Note that Ziai, whose extensive studies establish Suhrawardi as a rationalist thinker rather than an "Oriental mystic" translates the word Hikmat (wisdom) as "philosophy" rather than "wisdom," as is more common.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"Whoever knows philosophy (''hikmat'') and perseveres in thanking and sanctifying the Light of the Lights, will be endowed with royal glory (''kharreh'') and with luminous splendor (''farreh''), and—as we have said elsewhere—divine light will further bestow upon him the cloak of royal power and value.  Such a person shall then become the natural ruler of the universe.  He shall be given aid from the high heavens, and whatever he commands shall be obeyed; and his dreams and inspirations will reach their uppermost, perfect pinnacle."

و هر که حکمت بداند و بر سپاس و تقدیس نور الانوار مداومت نماید، او را خرّه کیانی بدهند و فرّ نورانی ببخشند، و بارقی الاهی او را کسوت هیبت و بهاء بپوشاند و رئیس طبیعی شود عالم را، و او را از عالم اعلا نصرت رسد و سخن او در عالم علوی مسموع باشد، و خواب و الهام او به کمال رسد.»

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Suhrawardi and Illumination school==
According to [[Hossein Nasr]] since Sheykh Ishraq was not translated into Western languages in the medieval period, Europeans had little knowledge about Suhrawardi and his philosophy. His school is ignored even now by later scholars.&lt;ref&gt;Hosein Nasr, Three Muslim Sages, 1997, p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; Sheykh Ishraq tried to pose a new perspective on questions like the question of Existence. He not only caused peripatetic philosophers to confront new questions but also gave new life to the body of philosophy after Avicenna.&lt;ref&gt;Hosein Nasr, Islamic philosophy from its origin to the present, 2006, p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to John Walbridge, Suhrawardi's critique on peripatetic philosophy can be counted as an important turning point for his successors. Suhrawardi tried to criticize Avicennism in a new approach. Although Suhrawardi first was a pioneer of peripatetic philosophy, he later became a Platonist following a mystical experience. He is also considered as the one who revived the ancient wisdom of Persia by his philosophy of Illumination.  His followers include other Persian philosophers such as [[Shahrazuri]] and [[Qutb al-Din al-Shirazi]] who tried to continue the way of their teacher. Suhrawardi made a distinction between two approaches in his [[Illuminationism]]: one approach is discursive and the other is intuitive.&lt;ref&gt;Walbridge, J., 'Suhrawardi and Illuminationism' in Adamson and Taylor, 2005, p. 201–223.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scholarly views on Suhrawardi==
There are different and contradictory views regarding the character of Suhrawardi's school. Some scholars such as Hossein Ziai believe that the most important aspects of his thought are his logic and critique of the peripatetic conception of definitions.&lt;ref name="Razavi"/&gt;{{pn|date=December 2016}} On the other hand, scholars like Mehdi Hairi and Sayyid Jalal Addin Ashtiyyani, believe that Suhrawardi remained within the framework of peripatetic and neo-Avicennian philosophy. Mehdi Amin Razavi criticizes both these groups for ignoring the mystical dimension of Suhrawardi's writings.&lt;ref name="Razavi"/&gt;{{pn|date=December 2016}} In turn, scholars such as [[Henry Corbin]] and [[Hossein Nasr]] view Surawardi as a theosophist and focus on the mystical dimension of his work.{{cn|date=December 2016}} Viewing in another way, [[Nadia Maftouni]] has analyzed Suhrawardi's works to figure out the elements of philosophy as a way of life. As she holds, the priority of practical reason to theoretical one, preferring intuitive knowledge over theoretical one, taking philosophy as a practice of attaining optional death, and proposing ways to heal mental diseases may well be considered the main elements of philosophy as a way of life in Suhrawardi's allegorical treatises. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Maftouni|first= Nadia|date= 2017|title= فلسفه به مثابه مشی زندگی نزد شیخ اشراق|trans-title= Philosophy Taken as the Manner of Life by Shaikh al-ʿIshraq|url= http://akhlagh.maaref.ac.ir/article-1-603-en.html|language= Persian|journal= Research Quarterly in Islamic Ethics|volume= 10|issue= 37|pages= 17|doi= |access-date= 16 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Published after Corbin's death, this copiously annotated translation gives to the reader without Arabic immediate access to al-Suhrawardi's illuminationist method and language)

Red Mind documentary which was produced, directed, and wrote by [[Ali Zare Ghanat Nowi]], is based on Shahab al-Din Yahya ibn Habash Suhrawardi notes. The film tells the story of creating human, the eternal love between human and God, human descent, and love reincarnation in human.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |title=فیلم مستند-داستانی عقل سرخ ساخته شد |newspaper= |location= |pages= |language= |publisher=خبرگزاری ایرنا |date=9 June 2011 |url=http://www.irna.ir/fa/News/2000280474 | access-date = 2 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Signs Gospel''' or the '''''semeia'' source''' is a hypothetical gospel account of the life of [[Jesus Christ]] which some scholars have suggested could have been a primary source document for the [[Gospel of John]]. This theory has its basis in [[source criticism]]. Since the commentary of [[Rudolf Bultmann]] was published in 1941,&lt;ref&gt;''Das Evangelium des Johannes'' (1941), translated as ''The Gospel of John: A Commentary'', Westminster ,John Knox Press, 1971, {{ISBN|0-664-20893-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; the hypothesis of a ''semeia'' (sign or miracle) source has gained some acceptance.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/3265238.pdf D. Moody Smith (1976), "The Setting and Shape of a Johannine Narrative Source", in ''Journal of Bibilical Literature'', Vol. 95, No. 2 (June 1976), pp. 231-241]: "Once it is granted that John's miracle tradition is not based upon the Synoptics, a miracle source (or a source that included miracles) becomes a reasonable hypothesis", accessed 6 February 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

== Internal evidence ==
One possible construction of the "internal evidence" states that the Beloved Disciple wrote an account of the life of Jesus.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} However, this disciple died unexpectedly, necessitating that a revised gospel be written.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} In other words, it may be that John “is the source" of the Johannine tradition but "not the final writer of the tradition."
&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ryybidJYMAQC&amp;pg=PA78&amp;dq=%22is+the+source%22++%22not+the+final+writer%22&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=%22is%20the%20source%22%20%20%22not%20the%20final%20writer%22&amp;f=false Paul N. Anderson, ''John, Jesus, and History: Critical Appraisals of Critical Views'', Volume 1, Symposium series, no. 44, Society of Biblical Literature Pub, 2007 p.78]&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, scholars are no longer looking for the identity of a single writer but for numerous authors whose authorship has been absorbed into the gospel's development over a period of time and in several stages.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=oRCdxOJWvcQC&amp;pg=PA31&amp;dq=%22the+role+of+the+beloved+Disciple%22+gospel+John&amp;lr=&amp;num=100&amp;cd=3#v=onepage&amp;q=%22the%20role%20of%20the%20beloved%20Disciple%22%20gospel%20John&amp;f=false Raymond Edward Brown, ''The Community of the Beloved Disciple'', Paulist Press, 1979] pp.31 - 34&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The [[Muratorian fragment]] dates from around 180 It states that while John was the primary author, several people were involved, that mutual revision was part of the original intent of the authors, and that the editors included the apostle Andrew. (Geza Vermes, ''The authentic gospel of Jesus'', London, Penguin Books. 2004. A note on sources, p. x-xvii.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ryybidJYMAQC&amp;pg=PA77&amp;dq=%221+The+authorship+of+John%22++stages+periods+arguments+%22not+as+frequent%22&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=%221%20The%20authorship%20of%20John%22%20%20stages%20periods%20arguments%20%22not%20as%20frequent%22&amp;f=false Paul N. Anderson, ''John, Jesus, and History: Critical Appraisals of Critical Views'', Volume 1, Symposium series, no. 44, Society of Biblical Literature Pub, 2007 p.77]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bultmann ==
The hypothesis of the ''Gospel of John'' being composed in layers over a period of time originated in the work of [[Rudolf Bultmann]] in 1941. Bultmann suggested that the author(s) of John depended in part on an author who wrote an earlier account.&lt;ref&gt;Frank E. Peters "How to Proceed" The Quest: The Historians' Quest for the Historical Jesus and Muhammad, Modern Scholar 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; This hypothetical "Signs Gospel" listing Christ's miracles was independent of, and not used by, the synoptic gospels. It was believed to have been circulating before the year 70 AD. Bultmann's conclusion was so controversial that [[Christian heresy|heresy]] proceedings were instituted against him and his writings.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

==Later scholarship ==
Nevertheless, this hypothesis has not disappeared. Scholars such as [[Raymond E. Brown]] believe the original author of the ''Signs Gospel'' to be the Beloved Disciple. They argue that the disciple who formed this community was both a historical person and a companion of Jesus Christ. Brown also suggests that the Beloved Disciple had been a follower of [[John the Baptist]] before joining Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=oRCdxOJWvcQC&amp;pg=PA31&amp;dq=witness+%22the+role+of+the+beloved+Disciple%22+%22beloved+disciple%22+%22historical+person%22+%22companion+of+Jesus%22&amp;lr=&amp;num=100&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=witness%20%22the%20role%20of%20the%20beloved%20Disciple%22%20%22beloved%20disciple%22%20%22historical%20person%22%20%22companion%20of%20Jesus%22&amp;f=false Raymond Edward Brown, ''The Community of the Beloved Disciple'', Paulist Press, 1979] pp.31 - 34&lt;/ref&gt;

It is now widely agreed that the Gospel of John draws upon a tradition of [[Miracles of Jesus]] which is substantially independent of the three [[synoptic gospels]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/3265238.pdf D. Moody Smith (1976), "The Setting and Shape of a Johannine Narrative Source", in ''Journal of Bibilical Literature'', Vol. 95, No. 2 (June 1976), pp. 231-241]: "Although the evidence is not entirely unambiguous and scholarly opinion is not unanimous, the trend of much recent work is against John's dependence upon the Synoptics", accessed 6 February 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

== Robert T. Fortna ==
Robert Fortna, a member of the [[Jesus Seminar]], argued that there are at least two distinct writing styles contained in the ''Gospel of John''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Fortna |first=Robert Tomson |date=1988 |title=The Fourth Gospel and its Predecessor |publisher=Fortress Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The later style contains highly developed and sophisticated [[midrash]] and [[theology|theological]] essays attached superficially - even "mechanically" at some points - to the former source. The other - earlier - style is the original 2-part Signs Gospel, consisting of a ''Signs Source'' (SQ) and a ''Passion Source'' (PQ).It is simple, direct and historical in style and can be roughly reconstructed as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/signs.html |title=The Signs Gospel |publisher=Early Christian Writings |access-date=November 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Soteriology''' ({{IPAc-en|s|ə|ˌ|t|ɪər|i|ˈ|ɒ|l|ə|dʒ|i}}; {{lang-el|[[wikt:σωτηρία|σωτηρία]]}} ''{{transl|el|sōtēria}}'' "[[salvation]]" from [[wikt:σωτήρ|σωτήρ]] ''{{transl|el|sōtēr}}'' "savior, preserver" and [[wikt:λόγος|λόγος]] ''{{transl|el|[[logos]]}}'' "study" or "word"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/soteriology "soteriology"], definition from the [[Webster's Dictionary|Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary]] which erroneously gives neuter nominative of the corresponding adjective, σωτήριον, as the base.&lt;/ref&gt;) is the study of [[religious doctrine]]s of [[salvation]]. Salvation theory occupies a place of special significance in many religions.

In the academic field of [[religious studies]], soteriology is understood by scholars as representing a key theme in a number of different religions and is often studied in a comparative context; that is, comparing various ideas about what salvation is and how it is obtained.

==Buddhism==
{{Main|Nirvana}}
{{expand section|date=April 2017}}
[[Buddhism]] is devoted primarily to liberation from [[dukkha|suffering]], ignorance, and contaminated rebirth. The purpose of one's life is to break free from ''[[Saṃsāra (Buddhism)|samsara]]'', the cycle of compulsory rebirth, by attaining ''[[moksha]]'' and ''[[nirvana]]''. Many types of Buddhism, [[Theravada]], [[Mahayana]] and [[Vajrayana]] (or Tantric), emphasize an individual's meditation and subsequent liberation from samsara, which is to become [[Enlightenment in Buddhism|enlightened]].

{{Quote|Thus, the fundamental reason that the precise identification of these two kinds of clinging to an identity&amp;nbsp;– personal and phenomenal&amp;nbsp;– is considered so important is again soteriological. Through first uncovering our clinging and then working on it, we become able to finally let go of this sole cause for all our afflictions and suffering.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Brunnholzl page 131 of his book "The Center of the Sunlet Sky, Madhyamaka in the Kagyu Tradition"&lt;/ref&gt;}}

However, the [[Pure Land]] traditions of Mahayana Buddhism generally focus on the saving nature of the Celestial Buddha [[Amitābha]]. In Mahayana [[eschatology]], it is believed that we are currently living through the Age of Dharma Decline, a period of 10,000 years where the corrupt nature of the people means the teachings of the Buddha are not listened to. Before this era occurred, the Bodhisattva Amitābha made 48 vows, including the vow to accept all sentient beings that called to him, to allow them to take refuge in his Pureland and to teach them the pure Dharma. It is therefore considered ineffective to trust in personal meditational and even monastic practices, but to only trust in the Primal Vow of Amitābha.&lt;ref&gt;Shinran, "HYMNS ON THE OFFENSE OF DOUBTING THE PRIMAL VOW", http://shinranworks.com/hymns-in-japanese/hymns-of-the-dharma-ages/hymns-on-the-offense-of-doubting-the-primal-vow/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Christianity==
{{Main|Salvation in Christianity}}
In Christianity salvation is the saving of the [[soul]] from [[Christian views on sin|sin]] and its consequences.&lt;ref&gt;"The saving of the soul; the deliverance from sin and its consequences" [[OED]] 2nd ed. 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; It may also be called "deliverance" or "[[Redemption (theology)|redemption]]" from sin and its effects.&lt;ref&gt;Wilfred Graves, Jr., ''In Pursuit of Wholeness: Experiencing God's Salvation for the Total Person'' (Shippensburg, PA: Destiny Image, 2011), 9, 22, 74-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Variant views on [[salvation]] are among the main lines dividing the various [[Christian denominations]], being a point of disagreement between [[Eastern Orthodoxy]], [[Roman Catholicism]] and [[Protestantism]], as well as within Protestantism, notably in the [[History of Calvinist–Arminian debate|Calvinist–Arminian debate]]. These lines include conflicting definitions of [[Total depravity|depravity]], [[Predestination#Christianity|predestination]], [[Atonement in Christianity|atonement]], and most pointedly, [[Justification (theology)|justification]].

According to Christian belief, salvation is made possible by the life, death, and [[resurrection of Jesus]], which in the context of salvation is referred to as the "[[Atonement in Christianity|atonement]]".&lt;ref name=CDOS&gt;"Christian Doctrines of Salvation." Religion facts. June 20, 2009. http://www.religionfacts.com/christianity/beliefs/salvation.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Christian soteriology ranges from [[exclusive salvation]]&lt;ref&gt;Newman, Jay. ''Foundations of religious tolerance.'' University of Toronto Press, 1982. {{ISBN|0-8020-5591-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p.123}} to [[universal reconciliation]]&lt;ref&gt;Parry, Robin A. ''Universal salvation? The Current Debate.'' Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 2004. {{ISBN|0-8028-2764-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; concepts. While some of the differences are as widespread as Christianity itself, the overwhelming majority agrees that salvation is made possible only by the work of Jesus Christ, the [[Son of God]], dying on the cross and being resurrected from death.

==Hinduism==
{{main|Moksha}}

Soteriology is discussed in Hinduism through its concept of ''[[moksha]]''. In the Vishnu Saharsanamam, it is said that one can get moksha through the many different ways, with the highest being “Sharana-Gati” roughly translating to “complete surrender under the lotus feet of the lord. However, different texts have different interpretations of this concept. In the ‘Advaitha’ philosophy, the soul, while not separated from the ‘Paramatma’ needs to attain moksha or enlightenment, in order for it to get re-united with the ‘Paramatma’.

==Islam==
{{Main|Salvation#Islam}}
[[Islam]]ic soteriology focuses on how humans can repent of and atone for their sins so as not to occupy a state of loss. Muslims believe that everyone is responsible for his action. So even though Muslims believe that [[Adam in Islam|Adam]] and [[Eve#Islam|Hawwa]] (Eve), the parents of humanity, committed a sin by eating from the forbidden tree and thus disobeying God, they believe that humankind is not responsible for such an action. They believe that God is fair and just and one should request forgiveness from him to avoid being punished for not doing what God asked of them and for listening to Satan.&lt;ref&gt;In [http://www.dar-us-salam.com/TheNobleQuran/index.html Az-Zumar] (The Groups) chapter, in verse 7, in the Qur'an, "No bearer of Burdens shall bear the burden of another" [39:7]. So repentance in Islam is to be forgiven from the poor decisions sent forth by one's hand. In Islam, for one to repent, s/he has to admit to their Lord that they were disobedient, feel regret for their behavior, be willing not to do the same again and finally to ask for repentance through prayer. S/he does not need to go to speak to someone to deserve the repentance, simply during the prayer, s/he speaks to her/his God (prays) asking His forgiveness. God said in the Qur'an "O you who believe! Turn to Allah with sincere repentance! It may be that your Lord will expiate from you your misdeeds, and admit you into Gardens under which rivers flow (Paradise)". [http://www.dar-us-salam.com/TheNobleQuran/index.html al-Tahreem 66:8] Muslims believe that Allah is merciful and thus believers are expected to continuously seek forgiveness so that their misdeeds may be forgiven. "Say: O my servants who have transgressed against themselves (by committing evil deeds) Despair not of the Mercy of Allah,  verily, Allah forgives all. Truly, He is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful” [http://www.dar-us-salam.com/TheNobleQuran/index.html al-Zumar 39:53] and also "And whoever does evil or wrongs himself but afterwards seeks Allaah’s forgiveness, he will find Allaah Oft Forgiving, Most Merciful" [http://www.dar-us-salam.com/TheNobleQuran/index.html al-Nisaa 4:110].&lt;/ref&gt;

Muslims believe that they, as well as everyone else, are vulnerable to making mistakes and thus they need to seek repentance repeatedly at all times. Muhammad said "By Allah, I seek the forgiveness of Allah and I turn to Him in repentance more than seventy times each day." (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, no. 6307)

God wants his servants to repent and forgives them, he rejoices over it, as  Muhammad said: "When a person repents, Allaah rejoices more than one of you who found his camel after he lost it in the desert." (Agreed upon. Narrated by al-Bukhaari, no. 6309)

Islamic tradition has generally held that it is relatively straightforward to enter Paradise. God says in the Quran:

“If you avoid the great sins you have been forbidden, We shall wipe out your minor misdeeds and let you through the entrance of honor [Paradise].”
&lt;ref&gt;An’Nisa 4:31&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jainism==
{{Main|Moksha (Jainism)}}

In [[Jainism]], the soteriological concept is ''[[Moksha (Jainism)|moksha]]'', but it is explained differently than similar term found in Hinduism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Christopher Key Chapple|title=Jainism and Ecology: Nonviolence in the Web of Life|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=abLZNdYxay8C&amp;pg=PA90|year=2006|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-2045-6|pages=90–92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moksha is a blissful state of existence of a soul, completely free from the karmic bondage, free from saṃsāra, the cycle of birth and death.

==Judaism==
{{Main|Salvation#Judaism}}
In contemporary [[Judaism]], redemption ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] ''ge'ulah''), refers to [[God in Judaism|God]]'s redeeming the people of [[Israelites|Israel]] from their various exiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.kolel.org/pages/reb_on_the_web/redemption.html |title=Reb on the Web |publisher=Kolel: The Adult Centre for Liberal Jewish Learning |accessdate=November 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This includes the [[Jewish eschatology|final redemption]] from the present exile.&lt;ref name=EBJ&gt;Salvation, Judaism. [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/520007/salvation/33996/Judaism] Accessed 4 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Judaism holds that adherents do not need personal salvation as Christians believe. Jews do not subscribe to the doctrine of [[Original sin]].&lt;ref&gt;"How Does a Jew Attain Salvation?" [http://www.beingjewish.com/toshuv/salvation.html] Accessed: 4 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, they place a high value on individual morality as defined in the law of God — embodied in what Jews know as the [[Torah]] or The Law, given to [[Moses]] by God on [[Mount Sinai]], the summary of which is comprised in the [[Ten Commandments]]. The Jewish sage [[Hillel the Elder]] states that The Law can be further compressed in just one line, popularly known as the [[Golden Rule]]: "That which is hateful to you, do not do unto your fellow".&lt;ref name=Malekar&gt;Malekar, Ezekiel Isaac. "THE SPEAKING TREE: Concept of Salvation In Judaism". ''The Times of India''. [http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2004-11-20/edit-page/27150861_1_redemption-salvation-jews] Accessed: 4 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

In Judaism, salvation is closely related to the idea of [[redemption (theology)|redemption]], saving from the states or circumstances that destroy the value of human existence. God as the universal spirit and Creator of the World, is the source of all salvation for humanity, provided an individual honours God by observing his precepts. So redemption or salvation depends on the individual. Judaism stresses that salvation cannot be obtained through anyone else or by just invoking a deity or believing in any outside power or influence.&lt;ref name="Malekar"/&gt;

Some sections of Jewish religious texts appear to argue that no [[afterlife]] exists even for the good and just, with the [[Book of Ecclesiastes]] telling the faithful: "The dead know nothing. They have no reward and even the memory of them are lost."&lt;ref&gt;Ecclesiastes 9:5&lt;/ref&gt; For many centuries, rabbis and Jewish laypeople have often wrestled with such passages.

==Mystery religions==
In the [[mystery religions]], salvation was less worldly and communal, and more a mystical belief concerned with the continued survival of the individual soul after death.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pagantheologies.pbworks.com/Soteriology Pagan Theologies: Soteriology]&lt;/ref&gt; Some savior gods associated with this theme are [[dying-and-rising god]]s, often associated with the seasonal cycle, such as [[Osiris]], [[Tammuz (deity)|Tammus]], [[Adonis]], and [[Dionysus]]. A complex of soteriological beliefs was also a feature of the cult of [[Cybele]] and [[Attis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Soteriology and mystic aspects in the cult of Cybele and Attis|author=Giulia Sfameni Gasparro}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The similarity of themes and archetypes to religions found in antiquity to later Christianity has been pointed out by many authors, including the [[Church Fathers|Fathers]] of the early Christian church. One view is that early Christianity borrowed these myths and motifs from contemporary Hellenistic mystery religions, which possessed ideas such as [[dying god|life-death-rebirth deities]] and sexual relations between gods and human beings. While [[Christ myth theory]] is not accepted by mainstream historians, proponents attempt to establish causal connections to the cults of [[Mithras]], Dionysus, and Osiris among others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pocm.info/ Pagan Origins of the Christ Myth]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sikhism==
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2010}}
{{Expand section|date=August 2010|small=no}}
[[Sikhism]] advocates the pursuit of salvation through disciplined, personal meditation on the name and message of God, meant to bring one into union with God. But a person's state of mind has to be detached from this world, with the understanding that this world is a temporary abode and their soul has to remain untouched by pain, pleasure, greed, emotional attachment, praise, slander and above all, egotistical pride. Thus their thoughts and deeds become "''Nirmal''" or pure, and they merge with God or attain "Union with God", just as a drop of water falling from the skies merges with the ocean.

==Other religions==
[[Shinto]] and [[Tenrikyo]] similarly emphasize working for a good life by cultivating virtue or virtuous behavior.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23233">[[Image:Levels of existence.svg|thumb|right|The upper levels on this chart can be considered to supervene on the lower levels.]]

In [[philosophy]], '''supervenience''' refers to a relation between sets of properties or sets of facts. X is said to supervene on Y if and only if some difference in Y is necessary for any difference in X to be possible. Equivalently, X is said to supervene on Y if and only if X cannot vary unless Y varies. Here are some examples. 

* Whether there is a table in the living room supervenes on the positions of molecules in the living room.
* The truth value of (A) supervenes on the truth value of (¬A). 
* Molecular properties supervene on atomic properties. 
* The quality of Nixon’s moral character supervenes on how he is disposed to act.

A table could not be removed from a room without the positions of molecules in that room changing. In a logic with double negation elimination, the truth value of (A) could not change without the truth value of (¬A) changing. Facts about the properties of a molecule could not change without facts about its atomic constituents changing. And facts about the quality of Nixon's moral character could not change without facts about how he has acted, or about how he would be disposed to act, changing. 

Supervenience is of interest to philosophers because it differs from other nearby relations, for example [[Logical_consequence|entailment]]. It may be possible for some A to supervene on some B without being entailed by B. In such cases it may seem puzzling why A should supervene on B and equivalently why changes in A should require changes in B. Two important applications of supervenience involve cases like this. One of these is the supervenience of mental properties (like the sensation of pain) on physical properties (like the firing of ‘pain neurons’). A second is the supervenience of normative facts (facts about how things ought to be) on natural facts (facts about how things are).

These applications are elaborated below. But an illustrative note bears adding here. It is sometimes claimed (and has been claimed in earlier versions of this entry) that what is at issue in these problems is the supervenience claim itself. For example, it has been claimed that what is at issue with respect to the mind-body problem is whether mental phenomena do in fact supervene on physical phenomena. This is incorrect. It is by and large agreed that some form of supervenience holds in these cases: Pain happens when the appropriate neurons fire. The disagreement is over why this is so. Materialists claim that we observe supervenience because the neural phenomena entail the mental phenomena, while dualists deny this. The dualist’s challenge is to explain supervenience without entailment. 

The problem is similar with respect to the supervenience of normative facts on natural facts. It is agreed that facts about how persons ought to act are not entailed by natural facts but cannot vary unless natural facts vary, and this rigid binding without entailment might seem puzzling. The possibility of "supervenience without entailment" or "supervenience without reduction" is contested territory among philosophers.

== History ==

&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:DavidsonDonald.jpg|thumb|right|[[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]] popularized the use of supervenience in the philosophy of mind.]] --&gt;

Supervenience, which means literally "coming or occurring as something novel, additional, or unexpected",&lt;ref name="Horgan"&gt;Horgan, Terry (1993) "From supervenience to superdupervenience: meeting the demands of a material world."  ''Mind.''  '''102''': 555-86.&lt;/ref&gt; from "super," meaning on, above, or additional, and "venire," meaning to come, shows occurrences in the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] dating back to 1844.

Its systematic use in philosophy is considered to have begun in early 20th-century [[meta-ethics]] and [[emergentism]]. As [[G.E. Moore]] wrote in 1922, "if a given thing possesses any kind of intrinsic value in a certain degree, then... anything ''exactly like it'', must, under all circumstances, possess it in exactly the same degree".&lt;ref name="Horgan"/&gt; This usage also carried over into the work of [[R. M. Hare]]. For discussion of the emergentist roots of supervenience see [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/supervenience/#2.2 Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy: Supervenience].

In the 1970s, [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]] was the first to use the term to describe a broadly physicalist (and non-reductive) approach to the philosophy of mind.  As he said in 1970, "supervenience might be taken to mean that there cannot be two events alike in all physical respects but differing in some mental respects, or that an object cannot alter in some mental respects without altering in some physical respects." &lt;ref name = "Davidson"&gt;Davidson, Donald (1970) "Mental Events." Reprinted in ''Essays on Actions and Events''. Oxford: Clarendon Press&lt;/ref&gt;

In subsequent years Terry Horgan, [[David Kellogg Lewis|David Lewis]], and especially [[Jaegwon Kim]] formalized the concept and began applying it to many issues in the philosophy of mind. This raised numerous questions about how various formulations relate to one another, how adequate the formulation is to various philosophical tasks (in particular, the task of formulating [[physicalism]]), and whether it avoids or entails [[reductionism]].

== Definitions ==

In the contemporary literature, there are two primary (and non-equivalent) formulations of supervenience (for both definitions let A and B be sets of properties).{{Citation needed|reason=It refers to the literature but there is no single reference in this section |date=January 2018}}

(1) A-properties supervene on B-properties if and only if all things that are B-indiscernible are A-indiscernible.  Formally:
*&lt;math&gt;\forall x \forall y (\forall X_{\in B} (Xx \leftrightarrow Xy) \rightarrow \forall Y_{\in A} (Yx \leftrightarrow Yy))&lt;/math&gt;
(2) A-properties supervene on B-properties if and only if anything that has an A-property has some B-property such that anything that has that B-property also has that A-property. Formally:
*&lt;math&gt;\forall x \forall X_{\in A} (Xx \rightarrow \exists Y_{\in B} (Yx \and \forall y (Yy \rightarrow Xy)))&lt;/math&gt;

For example, if one lets A be a set of mental properties, lets B be a set of physical properties, and chooses a [[domain of discourse]] consisting of persons, then (1) says that any two persons who are physically indiscernible are mentally indiscernible, and (2) says that any person who has a mental property has some physical property such that any person with that physical property has that mental property.

Some points of clarification: first, the definitions above involve quantification over properties and hence [[higher order logic]].  Second, in (1), expressions of the form &lt;math&gt;(\forall X (Xx \leftrightarrow Xy))&lt;/math&gt; capture the concept of sharing all properties, or being [[indiscernible]] with respect to a set of properties.  Thus, (1) can be understood more intuitively as the claim that all objects that are indiscernible with respect to a base set of properties are indiscernible with respect to a supervenient set of properties, or, as it is also sometimes said, that B-twins are A-twins.  Finally, supervenience claims typically involve some modal force, however, the way that  [[Modal logic|modal]] force is specified depends on which more specific variety of supervenience one decides upon (see below).

(1) and (2) are sometimes called "schemata", because they do not correspond to actual supervenience relations until the sets of properties A and B, the [[domain of discourse|domain]] of entities to which those properties apply, and a modal force have been specified. For modal forms of supervenience, the modal strength of the relation is usually taken to be a parameter (that is, the possible worlds appealed to may be physically possible, logically possible, etc.). Also, note that in the early literature properties were not always central, and there remain some who prefer to frame the relation in terms of [[Predicate (logic)|predicates]], [[fact]]s, or [[entities]] instead, for example.

== Varieties of supervenience ==
Beginning in the 1980s, inspired largely by [[Jaegwon Kim]]'s work, philosophers proposed many varieties of supervenience, which [[David Kellogg Lewis|David Lewis]] called the "unlovely proliferation".&lt;ref name = "Lewis"&gt;Lewis, David (1986) ''[[On the Plurality of Worlds]]''. Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; These varieties are based both on (1) and (2) above, but because (1) is more common we shall focus on varieties of supervenience based on it.

We can begin by distinguishing between local and global supervenience:

* Local: For any two objects x and y, if x and y are base-indiscernible, they are supervenient-indiscernible.

For example, if mental states locally supervene on brain states, then being in the same brain state entails being in the same mental state.

* Global: For any two worlds w1 and w2, if w1 and w2 are base-indiscernible, they are supervenient-indiscernible.

For example, if psychological properties globally supervene on physical properties, then any two worlds physically the same will be psychologically the same.  The value of global supervenience is that it allows for supervenient properties to be determined not by local properties of an individual thing alone, but by some wider spatiotemporal distribution of things and properties. For example, something's being a dollar bill depends not only on the paper and the inks it is made out of, but also on a widely dispersed variety of features of the world it occupies.

Both local and global supervenience come in many forms. Local supervenience comes in strong and weak varieties:

* Weak: For any world w, and for any two objects x in w and y in w, if x and y are base-indiscernible, they are supervenient-indiscernible.
* Strong: For any worlds w1 and w2, and for any two objects x in w1 and y in w2, if x and y are base-indiscernible, they are supervenient-indiscernible.

The difference is essentially whether correlations between base and supervenient properties hold within actual worlds only, or across possible worlds. For example, if psychological properties strongly locally supervene on physical properties, then any two people physically the same, in any two worlds, will also be psychologically the same. On the other hand, if psychological properties only weakly locally supervene on physical properties, then those correlations between base and supervenient properties that hold in virtue of the supervenience relation are maintained within each world, but can be different in different worlds. For example, my physical duplicates in the actual world will have the same thoughts as I have; but my physical duplicates in other possible worlds may have different thoughts than I have in the actual world.

There are also several kinds of global supervenience relations, which were introduced to handle cases in which worlds are the same at the base level and also at the supervenient level, but where the ways the properties are connected and distributed in the worlds differ.  For example, it is consistent with global mental–physical supervenience on the simple formulation described above for two worlds to have the same number of people in the same physical states, but for the mental states to be distributed over those people in different ways (e.g. I have my father's thoughts in the other world, and he has my thoughts).  To handle this, property-preserving isomorphisms (1-1 and onto functions between the objects of two worlds, whereby an object in one world has a property if and only if the object which that function takes you to in the other world does) are used, and once this is done, several varieties of global supervenience can be defined.

Other varieties of supervenience include multiple-domains supervenience and similarity-based supervenience.

==Examples of supervenient properties==

===Value properties===
The [[Value theory|value]] of a physical object to an [[wiktionary:agent|agent]] is sometimes held to be supervenient upon the physical properties of the object.  In [[aesthetics]], the [[beauty]] of [[A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte|La Grande Jatte]] might supervene on the physical composition of the painting (the specific [[molecules]] that make up the painting), the artistic composition of the painting (in this case, [[Pointillism|dots]]), the figures and forms of the painted image, or the painted canvas as a whole.  In [[ethics]], the [[good and evil|goodness]] of an act of [[charity (virtue)|charity]] might supervene on the physical properties of the agent, the mental state of the agent (his or her intention), or the external [[State of affairs (philosophy)|state of affairs]] itself.  Similarly, the overall suffering caused by an earthquake might supervene on the spatio-temporal entities that constituted it, the deaths it caused, or the natural disaster itself. The claim that moral properties are supervenient upon non-moral properties is called [[moral supervenience]].

===Mental properties===
In [[philosophy of mind]], many philosophers make the general claim that the mental supervenes on the physical. In its most recent form this position derives from the work of [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]], although in more rudimentary forms it had been advanced earlier by others. The claim can be taken in several senses, perhaps most simply in the sense that the mental ''properties'' of a person are supervenient on their physical ''properties''. Then:

* If two persons are indistinguishable in all of their physical properties, they must also be indistinguishable in all of their mental properties.

An alternative claim, advanced especially by [[John Haugeland]], is a kind of ''weak local'' supervenience claim; or, weaker still, mere ''global'' supervenience. The claim that mental properties supervene globally on physical properties requires only a quite modest commitment: any difference between two possible worlds with respect to their instantiated mental properties entails at least ''some'' difference in the physical properties instantiated in those two worlds.  Importantly, it does ''not'' require that the mental properties of an individual person supervene ''only'' on that person's physical state.

This weak global thesis is particularly important in the light of [[direct reference]] theories, and [[semantic externalism]] with regard to the content both of words and (more relevant to our concerns here) of ''thoughts''.  Imagine two persons who are indistinguishable in their local physical properties. One has a dog in front of his eyes and the other has a dog-image artificially projected onto his retinae. It might be reasonable to say that the former is in the ''mental state'' of seeing a dog (and of knowing that he does so), whereas the latter is not in such a state of seeing a dog (but falsely believes that he sees one).

There is also discussion among philosophers about mental supervenience and our experience of duration. If all mental properties supervene only upon some physical properties at durationless moments, then it may be difficult to explain our experience of duration. The philosophical belief that mental and physical events exist as a series of durationless moments that lie between the physical past and the physical future is known as [[Presentism (philosophy of time)|presentism]], and is a form of belief in [[Galilean relativity]].

===Computational properties===
There are several examples of supervenience to be found in [[computer network]]ing. For example, in a dial-up internet connection, the audio signal on a phone line transports [[Internet Protocol|IP packets]] between the user's computer and the [[Internet service provider]]'s computer. In this case, the arrangement of bytes in that packet supervenes on the physical properties of the phone signal. More generally, each layer of the [[OSI Model]] of computer networking supervenes on the layers below it.

We can find supervenience wherever a message is conveyed by a representational medium. When we see a letter "a" in a page of print, for example, the meaning ''Latin lowercase "a"'' supervenes on the geometry of the boundary of the printed [[glyph]], which in turn supervenes on the ink deposition on the paper.

===Biological properties===
In biological systems [[phenotype]] can be said to supervene on [[genotype]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Mitchell, Valone| first=W.A., T.J. | year=1990 | title=The Optimization Research Program: Studying Adaptations by Their Function | journal=The Quarterly Review of Biology | volume=65 | pages=43–52| doi=10.1086/416584 | issue=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is because any genotype encodes a finite set of unique phenotypes, but any given phenotype is not produced by a finite set of genotypes. Innumerable examples of [[convergent evolution]] can be used to support this claim. Throughout nature, convergent evolution produces incredibly similar phenotypes from a diverse set of taxa with fundamentally different genotypes underpinning the phenotypes. One example is [[Foster's rule|evolution on islands]] which is a remarkably predictable example of convergent evolution where the same phenotypes consistently evolve for the same reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Foster | first=J.B. | year=1964 | title=The evolution of mammals on islands | journal=Nature | volume=202 | pages=234–235| doi=10.1038/202234a0 | bibcode=1964Natur.202..234F | issue=4929 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Organisms released from predation tend to become larger, while organisms limited by food tend to become smaller. Yet there are almost infinite numbers of genetic changes that might lead to changes in body size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Fisher | first=R.A. | year=1918 | title=The correlation between relatives on the supposition of Mendelian inheritance | journal=Soc Edinb. | volume=52 | pages=399–433}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Kemper | first=K.E. | last2=Visscher | first2=P.M. | last3=Gooddard | first3=M.E. | year=2012 | title=Genetic architecture of body size in mammals | journal=Genome Biol. | volume=13 | pages=244| doi=10.1186/gb-2012-13-4-244 | issue=4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example of convergent evolution is the loss of sight that almost universally occurs in [[cave fish]] living in lightless pools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Gatenby R.A., Gillies R.J  |author2=Brown J.S.  |lastauthoramp=yes | year=2011 | title= Of cancer and cave fish  | journal= Nature Reviews Cancer | volume=11 | pages=237| doi=10.1038/nrc3036 | issue=4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Eyes are expensive, and in lightless cave pools there is little reason for fish to have eyes. Yet, despite the remarkably consistent convergent evolution producing sightless cave fish, the genetics that produce the loss of type phenotype is different nearly every time. This is because phenotype supervenes on genotype.

==Arguments against supervenience-based formulations of physicalism==
Although supervenience seems to be perfectly suited to explain the predictions of physicalism (i.e. the mental is dependent on the physical), there are four main problems with it. They are ''Epiphenomenal ectoplasm'', the ''lone ammonium molecule problem'', ''modal status problem'' and the ''problem of necessary beings.''

=== Epiphenomenal ectoplasm ===

''Epiphenomenal ectoplasm'' was proposed by Horgan and Lewis in 1983, in which they stated, a possible world (a world that could possibly exist) ''W'' is identical to our world in the distribution of all mental and physical characteristics (i.e. they are identical), except world ''W'' contains an experience called ''epiphenomenal ectoplasm'' that does not causally interact with that world. If supervenience physicalism is true, then such a world could not exist because a physical duplicate of the actual world (the world that is known to exist) could not possess an ''epiphenomenal ectoplasm''. This was rectified by [[Frank Cameron Jackson|Frank Jackson]], by adjusting the application of supervenience within physicalism to state "Physicalism is true at a possible world ''W'' if and only if any world which is a minimal physical duplicate (i.e. identical) of ''W'' is a duplicate of ''W simpliciter.''"{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

=== The lone ammonium molecule problem ===

The ''lone ammonium molecule problem'' provides a problem for Jackson's solution to ''epiphenomenal ectoplasm''. It was proposed by [[Jaegwon Kim]] in 1993 when he stated that according to Jackson's idea of supervenience, a possible world ''W'' was identical to the actual world, except it possessed an extra ammonium molecule on one of Saturn's rings. This may not seem to provide much of a problem, but because Jackson's solution refers only to minimal physical duplicates, this allows for the mental properties of ''W'' to be vastly different from those in the actual world. If such a difference would cause mental differences on Earth, it would not be consistent with our understanding of physicalism.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

=== Modal status problem ===

The ''modal status problem'' is only problematic if one thinks of physicalism as a [[Contingency (philosophy)|contingent]] truth (i.e. not [[logical truth|necessary truth]]), because it is described in terms of modal notions (i.e. through modal realism). The problem is presented when, from the statement "Minimal physical truths entail all truths," one derives the statement "''S'' (a statement that describes all minimal physical truths) entails ''S''* (a statement that describes the world)". This statement is a necessary truth, and therefore supervenience physicalism could not be contingent. The solution to this is to accept the above statement not as the equivalent of physicalism, but as an entailment of it.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

=== Problem of necessary beings ===

The ''problem of necessary beings'' was proposed by Jackson in 1998, in which he stated that a necessary being exists in all possible worlds as a [[non-physical entity]], and therefore proves physicalism false. However, physicalism allows for the existence of necessary beings, because any minimal physical duplicate would have the same mental properties as the actual world. This however is [[paradox]]ical, based on the fact that physicalism both permits and prevents the existence of such beings. This violates [[Hume's fork]] which states, "there are no necessary connections between distinct existences".{{cn|date=January 2018}}

'''''The Story of God''''' is a three-part video series produced by [[Dangerous Films]] featuring the physician Professor [[Robert Winston|Lord Winston]]. It first aired on 4, 11 and 18 December 2005 on [[BBC One]]. It was rebroadcast by the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] in May and June 2006 and by the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] in April 2007. 

''The Story of God'' series explores the origins of religion. The documentary focuses on the three [[Abrahamic faith]]s, and discusses belief in God in a scientific age.  The series included a number of interviews with scientists including [[Dean Hamer]], [[Richard Dawkins]], and members of the [[CERN]] programme. 

During the documentary Winston debates notable creationist [[Ken Ham]], visiting the creation museum where, he claims, "scientific facts are ignored in favour of religious certainty." He presents his view that science and religion have an important role in human development, but absolute certainty in either, 'can lead to serious problems'.

Winston also wrote a book titled ''The Story of God'' which was published in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;''The Story of God'', Robert M.L. Winston, Bantam Press (17 October 2005), {{ISBN|0-593-05493-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ugo Perone''' (born April 16, 1945 in Turin) is an Italian [[philosopher]] and [[Professor Emeritus]] of Philosophy.

==Biography==

After studying with [[Luigi Pareyson]], Ugo Perone graduated in philosophy at the [[University of Turin]] with a thesis on "Charles Secrétan’s Philosophy of Freedom." The thesis received the Luisa Guzzo Award for the best philosophy dissertation discussed during that academic year.

Perone has been Professor of Theoretical Philosophy and of Moral Philosophy at the University of Turin, the [[University of Rome "Tor Vergata"]], and the [[University of Eastern Piedmont]] in Vercelli, where he has also been Chair of the Department of Humanistic Studies and Associate Provost for International Relations.

Since 2012, Perone has been [https://www.theologie.hu-berlin.de/de/guardini Guardini Professur für Religionsphilosophie und Katholische Weltanschauung] at the [[Humboldt-Universität]] in Berlin.

From 1993 to 2001 Ugo Perone was Councillor for Culture for the town of Turin, and from 2009 to 2013 Councillor for Culture for the Province of Turin. In 2001 he was appointed Director of the [http://www.iic-berlino.de/ Italian Cultural Institute in Berlin], position which he held until 2003.

He is Senior Fellow of the [http://www.colbud.hu/index2.html Collegium Budapest]. He is also the President of the Italian Society for Philosophical and Theological Studies and a member of the Executive Committee of the journal [http://www.filosofiaeteologia.it/rivista/ Filosofia e Teologia]. He is a member of the editorial boards for Giornale di Metafisica, [http://www.spaziofilosofico.it/en/ Spazio Filosofico], and the [http://www.pareyson.unito.it/ Luigi Pareyson Center for Philosophical-Religious Studies].

He is the founder and Director of the [http://sdaff.it/ Scuola di Alta Formazione Filosofica (School for Higher Philosophical Education)], which was established through collaboration with the [http://www.compagniadisanpaolo.it/eng Compagnia di San Paolo foundation] and the Luigi Pareyson Center for Philosophical Religious Studies.

Ugo Perone has delivered lectures at major Italian universities and also in Chicago, Washington, Albany (NY), Frankfurt, Berlin, Munich, Erlangen, Essen, Cologne, Freiburg, Budapest, Strasbourg, Paris, Brussels, Mexico, and Senegal.

His ability to teach and orient his students on the path of philosophical research cannot be disjointed from his way of practicing philosophy.

==Philosophy==

Ugo Perone's entire philosophical path is inspired by a metaphor, namely, [[Jacob]]'s struggle with the angel as it is narrated in the book of [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]].&lt;ref&gt;Ugo Perone, ''Modernità e memoria'', pp. IX-XI.&lt;/ref&gt; In the desert night, a stranger interrupts Jacob’s solitude and struggles with him in a fight that will see neither winners nor losers. Only, at dawn, Jacob discovers that he has been wound by the angel. The wound also signifies the blessing of a new name: Jacob, the one who has struggled with God and has not been killed, from now on will be named Israel.&lt;ref&gt;''Genesis'' 32:28-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

The tale is the cypher of the extreme tension that, according to Perone, is in place between finite and infinite, penultimate and ultimate,&lt;ref&gt;Ugo Perone, ''Storia e ontologia'', p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt;  individual meanings and overall sense.&lt;ref&gt;Perone, ''Modernità e memoria'', p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt; Philosophy has a moral obligation to remain faithful to the finite. This faithfulness leads philosophy never to dismiss the historical conditions of thinking but also never to give up its own vocation to transcend such conditions by listening to the non-immediate, work, and labor. Once it has recognized modernity as its own condition, thinking cannot delude itself into believing that it can find its own position within being or sense, as if no break had occurred between finite and infinite. A flattening of thinking onto merely historical meanings, as if thinking were oblivious to the call of being, would be equally inopportune though. The necessary protection of the finite (a protection of the finite that must be exercised when necessary also against being, which must be challenged because toward that which is strong one can only be strong in turn) cannot amount to the elimination of either of the two opponents. On the threshold between finite and infinite, between history and ontology, a mediation occurs—this does not imply the reduction but rather the preservation of the distance between the two dimensions. In order to preserve the double excess of the finite over the infinite and of the infinite over the finite, one is not allowed to erase the distance between the two by either transforming it into unity or weakening it to the point of indifference.

It is true, for example, that memory can only preserve fragments and cannot claim direct remembrance of the whole. Yet it is also true that fragments should not be abandoned to a nihilistic drift because what is contained within each fragment (which memory remembers) is not a mere instant but precisely the essential (of a life, of a story, …) that must therefore be remembered.&lt;ref&gt;''Modernità e memoria'', p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosophy is obsessed with the whole, yet such a whole “extends not to totality but rather to the intensity of the fragment in which the whole is at stake.”&lt;ref&gt;Ugo Perone, ''La verità del sentimento'', p.&amp;nbsp;174.&lt;/ref&gt;

It becomes thus clear why Perone’s first books have double words in their titles: ''Modernità e memoria'' [''Modernity and Memory''], ''Storia e ontologia'' [''History and Ontology'']. The issue is that of saying two things at the same time according to the dialectics of the et-et, a dialectics of lingering and anticipation. The later books on the contrary identify a single theme ever since the title: ''Le passioni del finito'' [''The Passions of the Finite''], ''Nonostante il soggetto'' [''Despite the Subject''], ''Il presente possible'' [http://www.sunypress.edu/p-5237-the-possible-present.aspx The Possible Present], ''La verità del sentimento'' [''The Truth of the Sentiment'']. This unicity indicates that the finite, the subject, the present, the sentiment are investigated as thresholds, as places that cannot be conceived, let alone lived, without memory of the other. As it is the case for Jacob, these places carry upon themselves as a blessing the wound inflicted by the other.

==Method of work==

Perone develops his philosophy hermeneutically, on the ground of a deep investigation—which often goes against what is trendy at the time—into the history of philosophy and specific classic and contemporary authors such as [[René Descartes|Descartes]], [[Friedrich Schiller|Schiller]], [[Ludwig Feuerbach|Feuerbach]], Secrétan, [[Walter Benjamin|Benjamin]] in addition to various other philosophers (specifically, [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]], [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]], [[Søren Kierkegaard|Kierkegaard]], [[Edmund Husserl|Husserl]], [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]], [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty|Merleau-Ponty]], and [[Emmanuel Levinas|Levinas]]) whose names constellate Perone's numerous works. An integral part of Perone's philosophical research is the continuous confrontation with theology, especially the theological thinking of [[Karl Barth|Barth]], [[Dietrich Bonhoeffer|Bonhoeffer]], [[Rudolf Bultmann|Bultmann]], and [[Romano Guardini|Guardini]]. In recent years, Perone's attention has extended to a consideration of poetry (especially [[Paul Celan]]'s), narration, and theater, understood as areas capable of offering crucial philosophical contributions.

The '''Weather Underground Organization''' ('''WUO'''), commonly known as the '''Weather Underground''', was a [[Far-left politics|radical left-wing]] domestic terror group&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Weather Underground Bombings |url=https://www.fbi.gov/history/famous-cases/weather-underground-bombings |website=fbi.gov |publisher=Federal Beureau Of Investigation |accessdate=30 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; active in the late 1960s and 1970s, founded on the [[Ann Arbor, Michigan|Ann Arbor]] campus of the [[University of Michigan]]. Originally called '''Weatherman''', the group became known colloquially as '''the Weathermen'''. Weatherman organized in 1969 as a [[political faction|faction]] of [[Students for a Democratic Society]] (SDS)&lt;ref name=djwnyt82403&gt;Wakin, Daniel J., [https://www.nytimes.com/2003/08/24/nyregion/quieter-lives-for-60-s-militants-but-intensity-of-beliefs-hasn-t-faded.html "Quieter Lives for 60's Militants, but Intensity of Beliefs Hasn't Faded"], article ''[[The New York Times]]'', August 24, 2003. Retrieved June 7, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; composed for the most part of the national office leadership of SDS and their supporters.&lt;!--A specific source might be found for this, but it is a matter of general knowledge--&gt; Their political goal, stated in print after 1974, was to create a revolutionary party to overthrow U.S. imperialism.&lt;!--Not entirely true they wanted change in the government as the ultimate goal, not necessarily the overthrow of the government--&gt;

With revolutionary positions characterized by [[Black Power|black power]] and opposition to the [[Vietnam War]],&lt;ref name=djwnyt82403 /&gt; the group conducted a campaign of bombings through the mid-1970s and took part in actions such as the [[prison escape|jailbreak]] of [[Timothy Leary]] in 1970. The "[[Days of Rage]]", their first public demonstration on October 8, 1969, was a riot in Chicago timed to coincide with the trial of the [[Chicago Seven]]. In 1970 the group issued a "Declaration of a State of War" against the United States government, under the name "Weather Underground Organization".&lt;ref name="The Weather Underground"&gt;''[[The Weather Underground (film)|The Weather Underground]]'', produced by Carrie Lozano, directed by Bill Siegel and Sam Green, New Video Group, 2003, DVD.&lt;/ref&gt;

The bombing campaign indiscriminately targeted government buildings, along with several banks. The group stated that the United States government had been exploiting other nations by waging war as a means of solidifying America as a greater nation. Some attacks were preceded by evacuation warnings, along with threats identifying the particular matter that the attack was intended to protest. Three members of the group were killed in the accidental [[Greenwich Village townhouse explosion]] but no civilians were killed in any of the terrorist attacks.

For the bombing of the [[United States Capitol]] on March 1, 1971, they issued a communiqué saying that it was "in protest of the U.S. invasion of [[Laos]]". For the bombing of [[the Pentagon]] on May 19, 1972, they stated that it was "in retaliation for the U.S. bombing raid in [[Hanoi]]". For the January 29, 1975 bombing of the [[United States Department of State]] building, they stated that it was "in response to the escalation in [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]]".&lt;ref name="The Weather Underground" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = The Weather Underground. |authorlink= United States.

The Weathermen grew out of the [[Revolutionary Youth Movement]] (RYM) faction of SDS. It took its name from [[Bob Dylan]]'s lyric, "You don't need a weatherman to know which way the wind blows", from the song "[[Subterranean Homesick Blues]]" (1965). "You Don't Need a Weatherman to Know Which Way the Wind Blows" was the title of a [[position paper]] that they distributed at an SDS convention in Chicago on June 18, 1969. This founding document called for a "white fighting force" to be allied with the "Black Liberation Movement" and other radical movements&lt;ref name="Berger"&gt;{{cite book|title=Outlaws of America: The Weather Underground and the Politics of Solidarity|author=Berger, Dan|page=95|publisher=[[AK Press]]|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; to achieve "the destruction of U.S. [[imperialism]] and achieve a [[Classless society|classless]] world: world [[communism]]".&lt;ref name="Weatherman"&gt;See document 5, {{cite web |url=http://martinrealm.org/documents/radical/sixties1.html|title=You Don't Need a Weatherman to Know Which Way the Wind Blows |author=Revolutionary Youth Movement|year=1969 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060328145901/http://martinrealm.org/documents/radical/sixties1.html |archivedate=2006-03-28 |access-date=March 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Weathermen began to disintegrate after the United States reached a peace accord in Vietnam in 1973,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jacobs|first1=Ron|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=SD2TvqDh8EkC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR4&amp;dq=weather+underground+beginnings&amp;ots=aRKZobOcEw&amp;sig=LbgXB_o0Mq4peNk4JPKBqVzcXLM#v=onepage&amp;q=weather%20underground%20beginnings&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; after which the [[New Left]] declined in influence. By 1977, the organization was defunct.

== Background and formation ==
The Weathermen emerged from the campus-based [[opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War]] and from the [[civil rights movement]] of the 1960s. One of the factors that contributed to the radicalization of SDS members was the Economic Research and Action Project that the SDS undertook in Northern urban neighborhoods from 1963 to 1968. This project was aimed at creating an interracial movement of the poor that would mobilize for full and fair employment or guaranteed annual income and political rights for poverty class Americans.  Their goal was to create a more democratic society "which guarantees political freedom, economic and physical security, abundant education, and incentives for wide cultural variety". While the initial phase of the SDS involved campus organizing, phase two involved community organizing. These experiences led some SDS members to conclude that deep social change would not happen through community organizing and electoral politics, and that more radical and disruptive tactics were needed.&lt;ref&gt;Frost, Jennifer (2001). An Interracial Movement of the Poor: Community Organizing and the New Left in the 1960s. New York: New York University Press; Pg. 28&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1960s, [[United States Armed Forces|United States military]] action in [[Southeast Asia]] escalated, especially in Vietnam. In the U.S., the anti-war sentiment was particularly pronounced during the [[1968 U.S. presidential election]]

The origins of the Weathermen can be traced to the collapse and fragmentation of the [[Students for a Democratic Society]] following a split between office holders of SDS, or "National Office", and their supporters and the [[Progressive Labor Party (United States)|Progressive Labor Party]] (PLP). During the factional struggle National Office leaders such as [[Bernardine Dohrn]] and [[Michael Klonsky|Mike Klonsky]] began announcing their emerging perspectives, and Klonsky published a document titled "Toward a [[Revolutionary Youth Movement]]" (RYM).&lt;ref name="The Weather Underground" /&gt;

RYM promoted the philosophy that young workers possessed the potential to be a revolutionary force to overthrow capitalism, if not by themselves then by transmitting radical ideas to the working class. Klonsky's document reflected the philosophy of the National Office and was eventually adopted as official SDS doctrine. During the summer of 1969, the National Office began to split. A group led by Klonsky became known as RYM II, and the other side, RYM I, was led by Dohrn and endorsed more aggressive tactics such as [[direct action]], as some members felt that years of [[nonviolent resistance]] had done little or nothing to stop the Vietnam War.&lt;ref name="The Weather Underground" /&gt; The Weathermen strongly sympathized with the radical [[Black Panther Party]]. The police killing of Panther [[Fred Hampton]] prompted the Weatherman to issue a declaration of war upon the United States government.

{{Quote|We petitioned, we demonstrated, we [[sit-in|sat in]]. I was willing to get hit over the head, I did; I was willing to go to prison, I did. To me, it was a question of what had to be done to stop the much greater violence that was going on.|[[David Gilbert (activist)|David Gilbert]]&lt;ref name="The Weather Underground" /&gt;}}

===SDS Convention, June 1969===
At an SDS convention in Chicago on June 18, 1969, the National Office attempted to persuade unaffiliated delegates not to endorse a takeover of SDS by Progressive Labor who had packed the convention with their supporters.&lt;ref&gt;It was at the 1966 convention of SDS that members of PLP began to make their presence known for the first time. PLP was a [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] group that had turned to SDS as fertile ground for recruiting new members after meeting with little success in organizing industrial workers, their preferred base.Page 320, ''SDS'' by Kirkpatrick Sale, Random House (1973), Hardcover, 495 pages, {{ISBN|0-394-47889-4}} {{ISBN|978-0-394-47889-0}} trade paperback, Vintage Books (January 1, 1974), 752 pages, {{ISBN|0-394-71965-4}} {{ISBN|978-0-394-71965-8}} SDSers of that time were nearly all anti-communist, but they also refused to be drawn into actions that smacked of [[red-baiting]], which they viewed as mostly irrelevant and old hat. PLP soon began to organize a [[Worker Student Alliance]]. By 1968 and 1969 they would profoundly affect SDS, particularly at national gatherings of the membership, forming a well-groomed, disciplined faction which followed the Progressive Labor Party line.&lt;/ref&gt; At the beginning of the convention, two position papers were passed out by the National Office leadership, one a revised statement of Klonksy's RYM manifesto, the other called "You Don't Need a Weatherman to Know Which Way the Wind Blows".
The latter document outlined the position of the group that would become the Weathermen.

The document called for creating a clandestine revolutionary party.

&lt;blockquote&gt;The most important task for us toward making the revolution, and the work our collectives should engage in, is the creation of a mass revolutionary movement, without which a clandestine revolutionary party will be impossible. A revolutionary mass movement is different from the traditional revisionist mass base of "sympathizers". Rather it is akin to the [[Red Guards|Red Guard]] in China, based on the full participation and involvement of masses of people in the practice of making revolution; a movement with a full willingness to participate in the violent and illegal struggle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=You Don't Need a Weatherman to Know Which Way the Wind Blows |author=Karin Asbley, Bill Ayers, Bernardine Dohrn, John Jacobs, Jeff Jones, Gerry Long, Home Machtinger, Jim Mellen, Terry Robbins, Mark Rudd, and Steve Tappis |publisher=Weatherman |page=28 |url=https://archive.org/details/YouDontNeedAWeathermanToKnowWhichWayTheWindBlows_925 |accessdate=November 19, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At this convention the Weatherman faction of the Students for a Democratic Society, planned for October 8–11, as a "National Action" built around [[John Jacobs (student leader)|John Jacobs']] slogan, "bring the war home".&lt;ref name="KSale"&gt;Sale, Kirkpatrick, ''SDS'', Vintage Books, 1974, {{ISBN|0-394-71965-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The National Action grew out of a resolution drafted by Jacobs and introduced at the October 1968 SDS National Council meeting in [[Boulder, Colorado]]. The resolution, titled "The Elections Don't Mean Shit—Vote Where the Power Is—Our Power Is In The Street" and adopted by the council, was prompted by the success of the [[1968 Democratic National Convention protest activity|Democratic National Convention protests]] in August 1968 and reflected Jacobs' strong advocacy of [[direct action]].&lt;ref name="Wilkerson"&gt;{{Cite book| last=Wilkerson | first=C. | year=2007 | title=Flying Close to the Sun: My Life and Times As a Weatherman | publisher=Seven Stories Press | isbn=1-58322-771-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the "National Action Staff", Jacobs was an integral part of the planning for what quickly came to be called "Four Days of Rage".&lt;ref name="KSale" /&gt; For Jacobs, the goal of the "[[Days of Rage]]" was clear:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Weatherman would shove the war down their dumb, fascist throats and show them, while we were at it, how much better we were than them, both tactically and strategically, as a people. In an all-out civil war over Vietnam and other fascist U.S. imperialism, we were going to bring the war home. 'Turn the imperialists' war into a civil war', in Lenin's words. And we were going to kick ass.&lt;ref name="Gillies"&gt;Gillies, quoted in ''The Last Radical'', Vancouver Magazine, November 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In July 1969, 30 members of Weatherman leadership traveled to [[Cuba]] and met with North Vietnamese representatives to gain from their revolutionary experience. The [[North Vietnam]]ese requested armed political action in order to stop the U.S. government's war in Vietnam. Subsequently, they accepted funding, training, recommendations on tactics and slogans from Cuba, and perhaps explosives as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last= Senate Judiciary Committee | year = 1975 | title= Report of the Subcommittee to Investigate the Administration of the Security Act and Other Internal Security Laws of the Committee of the Judiciary | publisher= Government Printing Office | pages = 5, 8–9, 13, 18, 137–147}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===SDS Convention, December 1969===
After the Days of Rage riots the Weatherman held the last of its National Council meetings from December 26 to December 31, 1969 in [[Flint, Michigan]]. The meeting, dubbed the [[Flint War Council|"War Council"]] by the 300 people who attended, adopted Jacobs' call for violent revolution.&lt;ref name= Berger /&gt; Dohrn opened the conference by telling the delegates they needed to stop being afraid and begin the "armed struggle." Over the next five days, the participants met in informal groups to discuss what "going underground" meant, how best to organize collectives, and justifications for violence. In the evening, the groups reconvened for a mass "wargasm"—practicing [[karate]], engaging in physical exercise, singing songs, and listening to speeches.&lt;ref name="Berger" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Varon" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jacobs" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ThaiJones"&gt;Jones, ''A Radical Line: From the Labor Movement to the Weather Underground, One Family's Century of Conscience,'' 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Elbaum"&gt;Elbaum, ''Revolution in the Air: Sixties Radicals Turn to Lenin, Mao and Che,'' 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

The War Council ended with a major speech by John Jacobs. Jacobs condemned the "pacifism" of white middle-class American youth, a belief which he claimed they held because they were insulated from the violence which afflicted blacks and the poor. He predicted a successful revolution, and declared that youth were moving away from passivity and apathy and toward a new high-energy culture of "repersonalization" brought about by drugs, sex, and armed revolution.&lt;ref name="Berger" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Varon" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jacobs" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ThaiJones" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Elbaum" /&gt; "We're against everything that's 'good and decent' in honky America," Jacobs said in his most commonly quoted statement. "We will burn and loot and destroy. We are the incubation of your mother's nightmare."&lt;ref name="Varon"&gt;Quoted in Varon, ''Bringing the War Home: The Weather Underground, the Red Army Faction, and Revolutionary Violence in the Sixties and Seventies,'' 2004, p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two major decisions came out of the War Council. The first was to go underground, and to begin a violent, armed struggle against the state without attempting to organize or mobilize a broad swath of the public. The Weather Underground hoped to create underground collectives in major cities throughout the country.&lt;ref name="Sale" /&gt; In fact, the Weathermen eventually created only three significant, active collectives; one in California, one in the Midwest, and one in New York City. The New York City collective was led by Jacobs and Terry Robbins, and included [[Ted Gold]], [[Kathy Boudin]], [[Cathlyn Platt Wilkerson|Cathy Wilkerson]] (Robbins' girlfriend), and [[Diana Oughton]].&lt;ref name="Wilkerson" /&gt; Jacobs was one of Robbins' biggest supporters, and pushed Weatherman to let Robbins be as violent as he wanted to be. The Weatherman national leadership agreed, as did the New York City collective.&lt;ref&gt;Good, "Brian Flanagan Speaks," ''Next Left Notes,'' 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The collective's first target was Judge John Murtagh, who was overseeing the trial of the "Panther 21".&lt;ref name="Bingham2016"&gt;{{cite book|author=Clara Bingham|title=Witness to the Revolution: Radicals, Resisters, Vets, Hippies, and the Year America Lost Its Mind and Found Its Soul|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3ZhVCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR17|date=31 May 2016|publisher=Random House Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-679-64474-3|pages=17–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second major decision was the dissolution of SDS. After the summer of 1969 fragmentation of SDS, Weatherman's adherents explicitly claimed themselves the ''real leaders'' of SDS and retained control of the SDS National Office. Thereafter, any leaflet, label, or logo bearing the name "Students for a Democratic Society" (SDS) was in fact the views and politics of Weatherman, not of the slate elected by Progressive Labor. Weatherman contained the vast majority of former SDS National Committee members, including [[Mark Rudd]], [[David Gilbert (activist)|David Gilbert]] and Bernardine Dohrn. The group, while small, was able to commandeer the mantle of SDS and all of its membership lists, but with Weatherman in charge there was little or no support from local branches or members of the organization,&lt;ref&gt;Pages 184 and 190, Rudd, Mark, ''My Life with SDS and the Weathermen Underground'', William Morrow (2009), hardcover, 326 pages, {{ISBN|978-0-06-147275-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pages 127 and 136 in the essay "1969" by Carl Oglesby in ''Weatherman'', edited by Harold Jacobs, Ramparts Press (1970), trade paperback, 520 pages, {{ISBN|0-671-20725-3}} {{ISBN|978-0-671-20725-0}} Hardcover: {{ISBN|0-87867-001-7}} {{ISBN|978-0-87867-001-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and local chapters soon disbanded. At the War Council, the Weathermen had decided to close the SDS National Office, ending the major campus-based organization of the 1960s which at its peak was a mass organization with 100,000 members.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2004"&gt;Varon, J. (2004). Bringing the war home. Los Angeles, CA: University of California Press. pgs. 158-171.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ideology===
The thesis of Weatherman theory, as expounded in its founding document, ''You Don't Need a Weatherman to Know Which Way the Wind Blows'', was that "the main struggle going on in the world today is between U.S. imperialism and the national liberation struggles against it",&lt;ref&gt;Page 40 [http://foia.fbi.gov/weather/weath1a.pdf ''You Don't Need a Weatherman to Know Which Way the Wind Blows''] This unabridged copy of ''You Don't Need a Weatherman to Know Which Way the Wind Blows'' is part of an extensive [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] production made by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI).&lt;/ref&gt; based on [[Leninism#Imperialism|Lenin's theory of imperialism]], first expounded in 1916 in ''[[Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism]]''. In Weatherman theory "oppressed peoples" are the creators of the wealth of empire, "and it is to them that it belongs." "The goal of revolutionary struggle must be the control and use of this wealth in the interest of the oppressed peoples of the world." "The goal is the destruction of US imperialism and the achievement of a classless world: world communism"&lt;ref&gt;Page 41 [http://foia.fbi.gov/weather/weath1a.pdf ''You Don't Need a Weatherman to Know Which Way the Wind Blows'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The Vietnamese and other third world countries, as well as third world people within the United States play a vanguard role. They "set the terms for class struggle in America&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;ref&gt;Pages 42 and 43 [http://foia.fbi.gov/weather/weath1a.pdf ''You Don't Need a Weatherman to Know Which Way the Wind Blows'']&lt;/ref&gt; The role of the "Revolutionary Youth Movement" is to build a centralized organization of revolutionaries, a "Marxist-Leninist Party" supported by a mass revolutionary movement to support international liberation movements and "open another battlefield of the revolution."&lt;ref&gt;Page 46 [http://foia.fbi.gov/weather/weath1a.pdf ''You Don't Need a Weatherman to Know Which Way the Wind Blows'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://martinrealm.org/documents/radical/sixties1.html]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091104100749/http://martinrealm.org/documents/radical/sixties1.html |date=November 4, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theoretical basis of the Revolutionary Youth Movement was an insight that most of the American population, including both students and the supposed "middle class," comprised, due to their relationship to the instruments of production, the [[working class]],&lt;ref&gt;Pages 113 and 114, ''Flying Close to the Sun'', Cathy Wilkerson, Seven Stories Press (2007), hardcover, 422 pages, {{ISBN|978-1-58322-771-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus the organizational basis of the SDS, which had begun in the elite colleges and had been extended to public institutions as the organization grew could be extended to youth as a whole including students, those serving in the military, and the unemployed. Students could be viewed as workers gaining skills prior to employment. This contrasted to the Progressive Labor view which viewed students and workers as being in separate categories which could ally, but should not jointly organize.&lt;ref&gt;Pages 39-49 in the essay "More on the Youth Movement" by Jim Mellen in ''Weatherman'', edited by Harold Jacobs, Ramparts Press (1970), trade paperback, 520 pages, {{ISBN|0-671-20725-3}} {{ISBN|978-0-671-20725-0}} Hardcover: {{ISBN|0-87867-001-7}} {{ISBN|978-0-87867-001-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

FBI analysis of the travel history of the founders and initial followers of the organization emphasized contacts with foreign governments, particularly the Cuban and North Vietnamese and their influence on the ideology of the organization. Participation in the [[Venceremos Brigade]], a program which involved US students volunteering to work in the sugar harvest in Cuba, is highlighted as a common factor in the background of the founders of the Weather Underground, with China a secondary influence.&lt;ref&gt;Pages 13 to 33, [http://foia.fbi.gov/weather/weath1c.pdf "Initiation of the Brigages" to "Influence of China"]&lt;/ref&gt; This experience was cited by both Kathy Boudin and Bernardine Dohrn as a major influence on their political development.&lt;ref&gt;Statements in ''Underground'', a film by Emile de Antonio, Turin Film (1976) DVD Image Entertainment&lt;/ref&gt;

Terry Robbins took the organization's name from the lyrics of the [[Bob Dylan]] song "[[Subterranean Homesick Blues]],"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Sixties Chronicle|author=Peter Braunstein |publisher=Legacy Publishing|page=435|year=2004|isbn=141271009X}}&lt;/ref&gt; which featured the lyrics "You don't need a weatherman to know which way the wind blows."  The lyrics had been quoted at the bottom of an influential essay in the SDS newspaper, ''New Left Notes''. By using this title the Weathermen meant, partially, to appeal to the segment of US youth inspired to action for [[social justice]] by Dylan's songs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Isserman|first1=Maurice|title=Weather Reports|url=http://www.thenation.com/article/weather-reports#|website=TheNation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Weatherman group had long held that [[Militant|militancy]] was becoming more important than [[nonviolence|nonviolent]] forms of [[Anti-war movement|anti-war]] action, and that university-campus-based demonstrations needed to be punctuated with more dramatic actions, which had the potential to interfere with the US military and [[List of intelligence agencies#United States|internal security apparatus]]. The belief was that these types of [[Urban guerrilla warfare|urban guerrilla]] actions would act as a catalyst for the coming revolution. Many international events indeed seemed to support the Weathermen's overall assertion that [[world revolution|worldwide revolution]] was imminent, such as the tumultuous [[Cultural Revolution]] in China; the [[May 1968 events in France|1968 student revolts in France]], [[Tlatelolco massacre|Mexico City]] and elsewhere; the [[Prague Spring]]; the [[Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association]]; the emergence of the [[Tupamaros]] organization in [[Uruguay]]; the emergence of the [[Guinea-Bissauan Revolution]] and similar [[Marxism|Marxist]]-led independence movements throughout Africa; and within the United States, the prominence of the Black Panther Party, together with a series of "ghetto rebellions" throughout poor [[African Americans|black]] neighborhoods across the country.&lt;ref&gt;Lader, Lawrence. Power on the Left. (New York City: W W Norton, 1979.) 192&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|We felt that doing nothing in a period of repressive violence is itself a form of violence. That's really the part that I think is the hardest for people to understand. If you sit in your house, live your white life and go to your white job, and allow the country that you live in to murder people and to commit [[genocide]], and you sit there and you don't do anything about it, that's violence.|[[Naomi Jaffe]]&lt;ref name="The Weather Underground" /&gt;}}

The Weathermen were outspoken critics of the concepts that later came to be known as "[[white privilege]]" (described as white-skin privilege) and [[identity politics]].&lt;ref&gt;Page 249, Bernardine Dorn, Bill Ayers, and Jeff Jones, editors, ''Sing a Battle Song: The Revolutionary Poetry, Statements, and Communiqués of the Weather Underground'', Seven Stories Press (September, 2006), trade paperback, 390 pages, {{ISBN|1-58322-726-1}} {{ISBN|978-1-58322-726-8}} Reprinted from ''Prairie Fire: The Politics of Revolutionary Anti-Imperialism: Political Statement of the Weather Underground''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Page 42 in the essay "More on the Youth Movement" by Jim Mellen in ''Weatherman'', edited by Harold Jacobs, Ramparts Press (1970), trade paperback, 520 pages, {{ISBN|0-671-20725-3}} {{ISBN|978-0-671-20725-0}} Hardcover: {{ISBN|0-87867-001-7}} {{ISBN|978-0-87867-001-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As the [[civil disorder]] in poor black neighborhoods intensified in the early 1970s, Bernardine Dohrn said, "White youth must choose sides ''now.'' They must either fight on the side of the oppressed, or be on the side of the oppressor."&lt;ref name="The Weather Underground" /&gt;

===Anti-imperialism, anti-racism, and white privilege===
Weather maintained that their stance differed from the rest of the movement at the time in the sense that they predicated their critiques on the notion that they were engaged in "an anti-imperialist, anti-racist struggle".&lt;ref name="Jacobs 1970 135"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jacobs|first=Harold|title=Weatherman|year=1970|publisher=Ramparts Press|isbn=0671207253|page=135|url=http://www.sds-1960s.org/books/weatherman.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weather put the ''international'' proletariat at the center of their political theory. Weather warned that other political theories, including those organizing around class interests or youth interests, were "bound to lead in a racist and chauvinist direction".&lt;ref name="Jacobs 1970 135" /&gt; Weather denounced other political theories of the time as "objectively racist" if they did not side with the international proletariat; such political theories, they argued, needed to be "smashed".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Harolds|first=Jacob|title=Weatherman|year=1970|publisher=Ramparts Press|isbn=0671207253|page=113|url=http://www.sds-1960s.org/books/weatherman.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Page 7 [http://foia.fbi.gov/weather/weath1a.pdf ''You Don't Need a Weatherman to Know Which Way the Wind Blows'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of Weather further contended that efforts at "organizing whites against their own perceived oppression" were "attempts by whites to carve out even more privilege than they already derive from the imperialist nexus".&lt;ref name="Jacobs 1970 135" /&gt; Weather's political theory sought to make every struggle an anti-imperialist, anti-racist struggle; out of this premise came their interrogation of critical concepts that would later be known as "white privilege". As historian Dan Berger writes, Weather raised the question "what does it means to be a white person opposing racism and imperialism?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Berger|first=Dan|title=Outlaws of America|year=2006|publisher=AK Rress|isbn=1904859410|page=272}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Practice===
Shortly after its formation as an independent group, Weatherman created a central committee, the Weather Bureau, which assigned its [[Cadre (politics)|cadres]] to a series of [[List of Weather Collectives|collectives]] in major cities. These cities included New York, Boston, [[Seattle Weather Collective|Seattle]], Philadelphia, Cincinnati, Buffalo, and Chicago, the home of the SDS' head office. The collectives set up under the Weather Bureau drew their design from [[Che Guevara]]'s ''[[foco]]'' theory, which focused on the building of small, semi-autonomous cells guided by a central leadership.&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Varon, ''Bringing The War Home: The Weather Underground, The Red Army Faction, and The Revolutionary Violence in the Sixties and Seventies'' (Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 2004), 57&lt;/ref&gt;

To try to turn their members into hardened revolutionaries and to promote solidarity and cohesion, members of collectives engaged in intensive criticism sessions which attempted to reconcile their prior and current activities to Weathermen doctrine. These "criticism self-criticism" sessions (also called "CSC" or "Weatherfries") were the most distressing part of life in the collective. Derived from Maoist techniques, it was intended to root out racist, individualist and chauvinist tendencies within group members. At its most intense, members would be berated for up to a dozen or more hours non-stop about their flaws. It was intended to make group members believe that they were, deep down, white supremacists by subjecting them to constant criticism to break them down. The sessions were used to ridicule and bully those who didn't agree with the party line and force them into acceptance. However, the sessions were also successful at purging potential informants from the Weathermen's ranks, making them crucial to the Weathermen's survival as an underground organization. The Weathermen were also determined to destroy "bourgeois individualism" amongst members that would potentially interfere with their commitment to both the Weathermen and the goal of revolution. Personal property was either renounced or given to the collective, with income being used to purchase the needs of the group and members enduring Spartan living conditions. Conventional comforts were forbidden and the leadership was exalted, giving them immense power over their subordinates (in some collectives the leadership could even dictate personal decisions such as where one went). Martial arts were practiced and occasional [[direct action]]s were engaged in. Critical of monogamy, they launched a "smash monogamy" campaign, in which couples (whose affection was deemed unacceptably possessive, counterrevolutionary or even selfish) were to be split apart; collectives underwent forced rotation of sex partners (including allegations that some male leaders rotated women between collectives in order to sleep with them) and in some cases engaged in sexual orgies.&lt;ref&gt;Pages 266 to 282, [[Cathlyn Platt Wilkerson|Cathy Wilkerson]], ''Flying Close to the Sun: My Life and Times as a Weatherman'', Seven Stories Press (2007), hardcover, 422 pages, {{ISBN|978-1-58322-771-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Page 110, Staughton Lynd, "From Here to There: The Staughton Lynd Reader", PM Press (2010), paperback, 305 pages&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pages 57 to 60, Jeremy Varon, ''Bringing The War Home: The Weather Underground, The Red Army Faction, and The Revolutionary Violence in the Sixties and Seventies'' (Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pages 76 to 77, Arthur M. Eckstein, "Bad Moon Rising: How the Weather Underground Beat the FBI and Lost the Revolution", New Haven: Yale University Press (2016), 352 pages&lt;/ref&gt; This formation continued during 1969 and 1970 until the group went underground and a more relaxed lifestyle was adopted as the group blended into the [[counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]].&lt;ref&gt;Pages 352 and 353, [[Cathlyn Platt Wilkerson|Cathy Wilkerson]], ''Flying Close to the Sun: My Life and Times as a Weatherman'', Seven Stories Press (2007), hardcover, 422 pages, {{ISBN|978-1-58322-771-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Life in the collectives could be particularly hard for women, who made up about half the members. Their political awakening had included a growing awareness of sexism, yet they often found that men took the lead in political activities and discussion, with women often engaging in domestic work, as well as finding themselves confined to second-tier leadership roles. Certain feminist political beliefs had to be disavowed or muted and the women had to prove, regardless of prior activist credentials, that they were as capable as men in engaging in political action as part of "women's cadres", which were felt to be driven by coerced machismo and failed to promote genuine solidarity amongst the women. While the Weathermen's sexual politics did allow women to assert desire and explore relationships with each other, it also made them vulnerable to sexual exploitation.&lt;ref&gt;Pages 59 to 60, Jeremy Varon, ''Bringing The War Home: The Weather Underground, The Red Army Faction, and The Revolutionary Violence in the Sixties and Seventies'' (Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recruitment===
Weather used various means by which to recruit new members and set into motion a nationwide revolt against the government. Weather members aimed to mobilize people into action against the established leaders of the nation and the patterns of injustice which existed in America and abroad due to America's presence overseas. They also aimed to convince people to resist reliance upon their given privilege and to rebel and take arms if necessary. According to Weatherman, if people tolerated the unjust actions of the state, they became complicit in those actions. In the manifesto compiled by [[Bill Ayers]], [[Bernardine Dohrn]], [[Jeff Jones (activist)|Jeff Jones]], and Celia Sojourn, entitled "Prairie Fire: The Politics of Revolutionary Anti-Imperialism," Weatherman explained that their intention was to encourage the people and provoke leaps in confidence and consciousness in an attempt to stir the imagination, organize the masses, and join in the people's day-to-day struggles in every way possible.&lt;ref name=Ayers&gt;Bernardine Dohrn, Bill Ayers. and Jeff Jones, editors (2006). Sing a Battle Song: The Revolutionary Poetry, Statements, and Communiqués of the Weather Underground, 1970-1974. New York: Seven Stories Press. {{ISBN|1-58322-726-1}}. p. 239.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the year 1960, over a third of America's population was under 18 years of age. The number of young citizens set the stage for a widespread revolt against perceived structures of racism, sexism, and classism, the violence of the Vietnam War and America's interventions abroad. At college campuses throughout the country, anger against "the Establishment's" practices prompted both peaceful and violent protest.&lt;ref name=PBS&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/independentlens/weatherunderground|title=Independent Lens . THE WEATHER UNDERGROUND - PBS|publisher=Pbs.org|access-date=February 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The members of Weatherman targeted high school and college students, assuming they would be willing to rebel against the authoritative figures who had oppressed them, including cops, principals, and bosses.&lt;ref&gt;Berger, Dan, "Outlaws of America: The Weather Underground and the Politics of Solidarity," AK Press: Oakland, California, 2006, {{ISBN|1-904859-41-0}} p 99.&lt;/ref&gt; Weather aimed to develop roots within the class struggle, targeting white working-class youths. The younger members of the working class became the focus of the organizing effort because they felt the oppression strongly in regards to the military draft, low-wage jobs, and schooling.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, Ron The Way the Wind Blew: A History of the Weather Underground, 1997, p 19&lt;/ref&gt;

Schools became a common place of recruitment for the movement. In direct actions, dubbed [[Weather High School Jailbreaks|Jailbreaks]], Weather members invaded educational institutions as a means by which to recruit high school and college students. The motivation of these jailbreaks was the organization's belief that school was where the youth were oppressed by the system and where they learned to tolerate society's faults instead of rise against them. According to "Prairie Fire", young people are channeled, coerced, misled, miseducated, misused in the school setting. It is in schools that the youth of the nation become alienated from the authentic processes of learning about the world.&lt;ref name=Dohrn&gt;Dohrn, Bernardine. Sing a Battle Song: The Revolutionary Poetry, Statements, and Communiques of the Weather Underground 1970–1974. Seven Stories Press. 2006. p. 370.&lt;/ref&gt;

Factions of the Weatherman organization began recruiting members by applying their own strategies. Women's groups such as The Motor City Nine and [[Cell 16]] took the lead in various recruitment efforts. [[Roxanne Dunbar-Ortiz]], a member of the radical women's liberation group Cell 16 spoke about her personal recruitment agenda saying that she wanted their group to go out in every corner of the country and tell women the truth, recruit the local people, poor and working-class people, in order to build a new society &lt;ref&gt;Ortiz, Roxanne Dunbar. Outlaw woman: a memoir of the war years, 1960-1975. San Francisco, CA. City Lights: 2001. p. 154&lt;/ref&gt;

Berger explains the controversy surrounding recruitment strategies saying, "As an organizing strategy it was less than successful: white working class youths were more alienated than organized by Weather's spectacles, and even some of those interested in the group were turned off by its early hi-jinks"&lt;ref&gt;Berger, Dan, "Outlaws of America: The Weather Underground and the Politics of Solidarity," AK Press: Oakland, California, 2006, {{ISBN|1-904859-41-0}}. p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; The methods of recruitment applied by the Weathermen met controversy as their call to arms became intensely radical and their organization's leadership increasingly exclusive.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}

According to Dan Berger a relatively sophisticated program of [[armed propaganda]] was adopted. This consisted of a series of bombings of government and corporate targets in retaliation for specific imperialist and oppressive acts. Small, well-constructed [[time bomb]]s were used, generally in vents in restrooms, which exploded at times the spaces were empty. Timely warnings were made and communiqués issued explaining the reason for the actions.&lt;ref&gt;Pages 148 to 151, 154, Dan Berger, ''Outlaws of America: The Weather Underground and the Politics of Solidarity'', Ak Press (2006), trade paperback, 432 pages, {{ISBN|1-904859-41-0}} {{ISBN|978-1-904859-41-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Days of Rage"===
{{Main|Days of Rage}}
One of the first acts of the Weathermen after splitting from SDS was to announce they would hold the "Days of Rage" that autumn. This was advertised to "Bring the war home!" Hoping to cause sufficient chaos to "wake" the American public out of what they saw as complacency toward the [[role of United States in the Vietnam War|role of the US in the Vietnam War]], the Weathermen meant it to be the largest protest of the decade. They had been told by their regional cadre to expect thousands to attend; however, when they arrived they found only a few hundred people.&lt;ref name="The Weather Underground" /&gt;

According to [[Bill Ayers]] in 2003, "The Days of Rage was an attempt to break from the norms of kind of acceptable theatre of 'here are the anti-war people: containable, marginal, predictable, and here's the little path they're going to march down, and here's where they can make their little statement.' We wanted to say, "No, what we're going to do is whatever we had to do to stop the violence in Vietnam.'"&lt;ref name="The Weather Underground" /&gt; The protests did not meet Ayers' stated expectations.

Though the October 8, 1969, rally in Chicago had failed to draw as many as the Weathermen had anticipated, the two or three hundred who did attend shocked police by rioting through the affluent [[Gold Coast Historic District (Chicago)#Gold Coast|Gold Coast neighborhood]]. They smashed the windows of a bank and those of many cars. The crowd ran four blocks before encountering police barricades. They charged the police but broke into small groups; more than 1,000 police counter-attacked. Many protesters were wearing motorcycle or football helmets, but the police were well-trained and armed. Large amounts of [[tear gas]] were used, and at least twice police ran squad cars into the mob. The rioting lasted about half an hour, during which 28 policemen were injured. Six Weathermen were shot by the police and an unknown number injured; 68 rioters were arrested.&lt;ref name="Berger" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jacobs"&gt;Jacobs, ''The Way the Wind Blew: A History of the Weather Underground,'' 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sale"&gt;Sale, SDS, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jones"&gt;Jones, A Radical Line: From the Labor Movement to the Weather Underground, One Family's Century of Conscience, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

For the next two days, the Weathermen held no rallies or protests. Supporters of the RYM II movement, led by Klonsky and Noel Ignatin, held peaceful rallies in front of the federal courthouse, an International Harvester factory, and Cook County Hospital. The largest event of the Days of Rage took place on Friday, October 9, when RYM II led an interracial march of 2,000 people through a Spanish-speaking part of Chicago.&lt;ref name="Berger" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jones" /&gt;

On October 10, the Weatherman attempted to regroup and resume their demonstrations. About 300 protesters marched through [[Chicago Loop|The Loop]], Chicago's main business district, watched by a double-line of heavily armed police. The protesters suddenly broke through the police lines and rampaged through the Loop, smashing the windows of cars and stores. The police were prepared, and quickly isolated the rioters. Within 15 minutes, more than half the crowd had been arrested.&lt;ref name="Berger" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jones" /&gt;

The Days of Rage cost Chicago and the state of Illinois about $183,000 ($100,000 for National Guard expenses, $35,000 in damages, and $20,000 for one injured citizen's medical expenses). Most of the Weathermen and SDS leaders were now in jail, and the Weathermen would have to pay over $243,000 for their [[bail]].&lt;ref name="Sale" /&gt;

===Flint War Council===
{{Main|Flint War Council}}
The Flint War Council was a series of meetings of the Weather Underground Organization and associates in Flint, Michigan, that took place from 27–31 December 1969.&lt;ref&gt;Federal Bureau of Investigation. (1976) Weather underground organization. Retrieved [from http://foia.fbi.gov/foiaindex/weather.htm Foia.fbi.gov], pgs. 382-383&lt;/ref&gt; During these meetings, the decisions were made for the Weather Underground Organization to go underground&lt;ref name="autogenerated2004" /&gt; and to "engage in guerilla warfare against the U.S. government."&lt;ref name="foia.fbi.gov"&gt;Federal Bureau of Investigation. (1976). Weather underground organization.

During a closed-door meeting of the Weather Underground's leadership, the decision was also taken to abolish Students for a Democratic Society.&lt;ref name="Rudd, M. 2009"&gt;Rudd, M. (2009).

===New York City arson attacks===
On February 21, 1970, at around 4:30&amp;nbsp;a.m., three gasoline-filled [[Molotov cocktail]]s exploded in front of the home of [[New York Supreme Court]] Justice John M. Murtagh, who was presiding over the pretrial hearings of the so-called "Panther 21" members of the [[Black Panther Party]] over a plot to bomb New York landmarks and department stores.&lt;ref name="Murtagh"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cotter|first1=Joseph P.|last2=Dembart|first2=Lee|date=February 21, 1970|title=Four bombs at Murtagh home; Panther hearing judge|newspaper=New York Post|page=1|url=http://jfk.hood.edu/Collection/Weisberg%20Subject%20Index%20Files/B%20Disk/Blacks%20Miscellaneous/056.pdf|access-date=January 6, 2014}}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite news|last=Perlmutter|first=Emanuel|date=February 22, 1970|title=Justice Murtagh's home target of 3 fire bombs|newspaper=The New York Times|page=1|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1970/02/22/archives/justice-murtaghs-home-target-of-3-fire-bombs-judges-home-target-of.html|access-date=October 12, 2008}}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite news|author=.|date=February 24, 1970|title=Police investigate Law firebombing|newspaper=Columbia Daily Spectator|page=1|url=http://spectatorarchive.library.columbia.edu/cgi-bin/columbia?a=d&amp;d=cs19700224-01.2.3&amp;srpos=&amp;dliv=none&amp;e=-------en-20--1--txt-IN-----|access-date=January 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Justice Murtagh and his family were unharmed, but two panes of a front window were shattered, an overhanging wooden eave was scorched, and the paint on a car in the garage was charred.&lt;ref name="Murtagh" /&gt; "Free the Panther 21" and "[[Viet Cong]] have won" were written in large red letters on the sidewalk in front of the judge's house at 529 W. 217th Street in the [[Inwood, Manhattan|Inwood]] neighborhood of Manhattan.&lt;ref name="Murtagh" /&gt; The judge's house had been under hourly police surveillance and an unidentified woman called the police a few minutes before the explosions to report several prowlers there, which resulted in a police car being sent immediately to the scene.&lt;ref name="Murtagh" /&gt;

In the preceding hours, Molotov cocktails had been thrown at the second floor of [[Columbia University]]'s International Law Library at 434 W. 116th Street and at a police car parked across the street from the Charles Street police station in the [[West Village]] in Manhattan, and at Army and Navy recruiting booths on Nostrand Avenue on the eastern fringe of the [[Brooklyn College]] campus in Brooklyn, causing no or minimal damage in incidents of unknown relation to that at Judge Murtagh's home.&lt;ref name="Murtagh" /&gt;

===Greenwich Village townhouse explosion===
{{Main|Greenwich Village townhouse explosion}}
On March 6, 1970, during preparations for the bombing of a Non-Commissioned Officers' (NCO) dance at the [[Fort Dix]] U.S. Army base and for Butler Library at Columbia University,&lt;ref name=djwnyt82403 /&gt; there was an explosion in a [[Greenwich Village]] [[safe house]] when the [[dynamite]] used in bomb construction prematurely detonated for unknown reasons. WUO members [[Diana Oughton]], [[Ted Gold]], and [[Terry Robbins]] died in the explosion. [[Cathlyn Platt Wilkerson|Cathy Wilkerson]] and [[Kathy Boudin]] escaped unharmed. The site of the Village explosion was the former residence of [[Merrill Lynch]] brokerage firm co-founder [[Charles E. Merrill|Charles Merrill]] and the childhood home of his son, poet [[James Merrill]]; the younger Merrill subsequently memorialized the event in his poem ''18 West 11th Street'', the title being the address of the brownstone townhouse.&lt;ref name="GussowHouse"&gt;{{cite news|author=Mel Gussow|url= https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C02E4DB1638F936A35750C0A9669C8B63&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all|title= The House On West 11th Street|publisher=The New York Times|date=March 5, 2005|access-date=April 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An FBI report later stated that the group had possessed enough explosives to "level&amp;nbsp;... both sides of the street".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/05/10/arts/my-manhattan-this-side-of-heaven-please-in-the-village.html|title=MY MANHATTAN; This Side of Heaven, Please, in the Village|author=Michael Frank|publisher=New York Times|access-date=July 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Underground strategy change====
After the Greenwich Village townhouse explosion, per the December 1969 [[Flint War Council]] decisions the group was now well underground, and began to refer to themselves as the Weather Underground Organization. At this juncture, WUO shrank considerably, becoming even fewer than they had been when first formed. The group was devastated by the loss of their friends, and in late April 1970, members of the Weathermen met in California to discuss what had happened in New York and the future of the organization. The group decided to reevaluate their strategy, particularly regarding their initial belief in the acceptability of human casualties, and rejected such tactics as kidnapping and assassinations.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

In 2003, Weather Underground members stated in interviews that they wanted to convince the American public that the United States was truly responsible for the calamity in [[Vietnam]].&lt;ref name="The Weather Underground" /&gt; The group began striking at night, bombing empty offices, with warnings always issued in advance to ensure a safe evacuation. According to [[David Gilbert (activist)|David Gilbert]], who took part in the [[Brink's robbery (1981)|1981 Brink's robbery]] that killed two police officers and a Brinks' guard, and was jailed for murder, "[their] goal was to not hurt any people, and a lot of work went into that. But we wanted to pick targets that showed to the public who was responsible for what was really going on."&lt;ref name="The Weather Underground" /&gt; After the Greenwich Village explosion, in a review of the documentary film ''[[The Weather Underground (film)|The Weather Underground]]'' (2002), a ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'' journalist restated the film's contention that no one was killed by WUO bombs.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://film.guardian.co.uk/features/featurepages/0,,990399,00.html|title=All the rage|author=John Patterson|work=the Guardian|access-date=February 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|We were very careful from the moment of the townhouse on to be sure we weren't going to hurt anybody, and we never did hurt anybody.

===Declaration of war===
In response to the death of Black Panther members [[Fred Hampton]] and [[Mark Clark (Black Panther)|Mark Clark]] in December 1969 during a police raid, on May 21, 1970, the Weather Underground issued a "[[s:Weather Underground Declaration of a State of War|Declaration of War]]" against the United States government, using for the first time its new name, the "Weather Underground Organization" (WUO), adopting fake identities, and pursuing [[covert]] activities only. These initially included preparations for a bombing of a U.S. military non-commissioned officers' dance at [[Fort Dix]], New Jersey, in what [[Brian Flanagan]] said had been intended to be "the most horrific hit the United States government had ever suffered on its territory".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.democracynow.org/article.pl?sid=03/08/21/1441247|title=Ex-Weather Underground Member Kathy Boudin Granted Parole|work=Democracy Now!|access-date=February 15, 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071114020010/http://www.democracynow.org/article.pl?sid=03%2F08%2F21%2F1441247|archivedate=November 14, 2007|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Revolutionary violence is the only way.|[[Bernardine Dohrn]]&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Weather Underground Declaration of a State of War|Weather Underground Declaration of a State of War]]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Bernardine Dohrn subsequently stated that it was [[Fred Hampton|Fred Hampton's]] death that prompted the Weather Underground to declare war on the US government.

In December 1969, the Chicago Police Department, in conjunction with the FBI, conducted a raid on the home of [[Black Panther Party|Black Panther]] Fred Hampton, in which he and [[Mark Clark (Black Panther)|Mark Clark]] were killed, with four of the seven other people in the apartment wounded. The survivors of the raid were all charged with assault and attempted murder. The police claimed they shot in self-defense, although a controversy arose when the Panthers, other activists and a Chicago newspaper reporter presented visual evidence, as well as the testimony of an FBI ballistics expert, showing that the sleeping Panthers were not [[resisting arrest]] and fired only one shot, as opposed to the more than one hundred the police fired into the apartment. The charges were later dropped, and the families of the dead won a $1.8 million settlement from the government. It was discovered in 1971 that Hampton had been targeted by the FBI's [[COINTELPRO]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/hueypnewton/people/people_other.html|title=A Huey P.

On May 21, 1970, a communiqué from the Weather Underground was issued promising to attack a "symbol or institution of American injustice" within two weeks.&lt;ref&gt;Kirkpatrick Sale, SDS, (New York: Random House, 1973), 611.&lt;/ref&gt; The communiqué included taunts towards the FBI, daring them to try to find the group, whose members were spread throughout the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Harold Jacobs ed., Weatherman, (Ramparts Press, 1970), 508-511.&lt;/ref&gt; Many leftist organizations showed curiosity in the communiqué, and waited to see if the act would in fact occur. However, two weeks would pass without any occurrence.&lt;ref&gt;Harold Jacobs ed., Weatherman, (Ramparts Press, 1970), 374.&lt;/ref&gt; Then on June 9, 1970, their first publicly acknowledged bombing occurred at a [[New York City]] police station,&lt;ref&gt;Kirkpatrick Sale, SDS, (New York: Random House, 1973), 648.&lt;/ref&gt; saying it was "in outraged response to the assassination of the [[Soledad Brothers|Soledad Brother]] [[George Jackson (Black Panther)|George Jackson]],"&lt;ref name="The Weather Underground" /&gt; who had recently been killed by prison guards in an escape attempt. The FBI placed the Weather Underground organization on the ten most-wanted list by the end of 1970.&lt;ref name="Jacobs" /&gt;

===Activity in 1970===
On June 9, 1970, a bomb made with ten sticks of dynamite exploded in the [[240 Centre Street]], the headquarters of the New York City Police Department. The explosion was preceded by a warning about six minutes prior to the detonation and was followed by a WUO claim of responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = The Weather Underground. |authorlink= United States.

In September 1970, the group accepted a $20,000 payment from the largest international [[Psychedelic drugs|psychedelic drug]] distribution organization, called [[The Brotherhood of Eternal Love]], to break [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]] advocate [[Timothy Leary]] out of a California prison in [[San Luis Obispo, California|San Luis Obispo]], north of [[Santa Barbara, California]],&lt;ref name="The Weather Underground" /&gt; and transport him and his wife to [[Algeria]], where Leary joined [[Eldridge Cleaver]]. Rumors also circulated that the funds were donated by an internationally known female folk singer in [[Los Angeles]] or by [[Elephant's Memory]], which was [[John Lennon]]'s backup band in New York City and was a factor with the attempted deportation of Lennon, who had donated bail money for radical groups.&lt;ref&gt;fbi.gov/declassified files/John Lennon&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pentagon bombing===
[[File:Searching for Clues After Blast in Pentagon.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Investigators search for clues after the May 19, 1972 Weatherman bombing of [[the Pentagon]].]]
On May 19, 1972, [[Ho Chi Minh]]'s birthday, the Weather Underground placed a bomb in the women's bathroom in the Air Force wing of [[the Pentagon]]. The damage caused flooding that destroyed computer tapes holding classified information. Other radical groups worldwide applauded the bombing, illustrated by German youths protesting against American military systems in [[Frankfurt]].&lt;ref name="Jacobs" /&gt; This was "in retaliation for the U.S. bombing raid in [[Hanoi]]."&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'', May 19, 1972, Berger 330&lt;/ref&gt;

===Withdrawal of charges===
In 1973, the government requested dropping charges against most of the WUO members. The requests cited a recent decision by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] that barred electronic surveillance without a court order. This Supreme Court decision would hamper any prosecution of the WUO cases. In addition, the government did not want to reveal foreign intelligence secrets that a trial would require.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = The Weather Underground. |authorlink= United States.

These grand juries caused Sylvia Jane Brown, Robert Gelbhard, and future members of the [[Seattle Weather Collective]] to be subpoenaed in Seattle and Portland for the investigation of one of the first (and last) captured WUO members. Four months afterwards the cases were dismissed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/465/371/290087/ Sylvia Jane Brown vs United States 465 F.2d 361 (1972)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gelbard vs. United States, 408 U.S. 41, 92 S.Ct. 2357 (1972)], reversing [https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/108596/gelbard-v-united-states/ United States vs. Gelbard, 443 F.2d 837 (1971)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"New York Times.com/archives/1972/"Barnard Coed Subpoenaed to Seattle"&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|reason=The citation does not contain a valid NYT story of "Barnard Coed Subpoenaed to Seattle".

===''Prairie Fire''===
With the help from [[Clayton Van Lydegraf]], the Weather Underground sought a more [[Marxism–Leninism|Marxist–Leninist]] ideological approach to the post-Vietnam reality.&lt;ref name=JacobsVerso&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The leading members of the Weather Underground (Bill Ayers, Bernardine Dohrn, Jeff Jones, and Celia Sojourn) collaborated on ideas and published a manifesto: ''Prairie Fire: The Politics of Revolutionary Anti-Imperialism.''&lt;ref name="Jacobs" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/PrairieFireThePoliticsOfRevolutionaryAnti-imperialismThePolitical |title=Prairie fire : the politics of revolutionary anti-imperialism : the political statement of the Weather Underground. : Weather Underground Organization. : Free Download &amp; Streaming : Internet Archive |publisher=Archive.org |date=2014-12-31 |access-date=2015-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name came from a quote by [[Mao Zedong]], "a single spark can set a prairie fire." By the summer of 1974, 5,000 copies had surfaced in coffee houses, bookstores and public libraries across the U.S. Leftist newspapers praised the manifesto.&lt;ref name=Varon3&gt;Jeremy Varon, ''Bringing the War Home: the Weather Underground, the Red Army Faction and Revolutionary Violence in the Sixties and Seventies'', (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2004), pgs. 292-298&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Abbie Hoffman]] publicly praised ''Prairie Fire'' and believed every American should be given a copy.&lt;ref&gt;Marty Jezer, ''Abbie Hoffman: American Rebel'', (New Brunswick, NJ: Rutgers University Press, 1992), pp. 258–259.&lt;/ref&gt; The manifesto's influence initiated the formation of the [[Prairie Fire Organizing Committee]] in several American cities. Hundreds of above-ground activists helped further the new political vision of the Weather Underground.&lt;ref name=Varon3 /&gt; Essentially, after the 1969 failure of the Days of Rage to involve thousands of youth in massive street fighting, Weather renounced most of the Left and decided to operate as an isolated underground group. Prairie Fire urged people to never "dissociate mass struggle from revolutionary violence". To do so, asserted Weather, was to do the state's work. Just as in 1969–1970, Weather still refused to renounce revolutionary violence for "to leave people unprepared to fight the state is to seriously mislead them about the inevitable nature of what lies ahead". However, the decision to build only an underground group caused the Weather Underground to lose sight of its commitment to mass struggle and made future alliances with the mass movement difficult and tenuous.&lt;ref name=JacobsVerso /&gt;{{Rp|76–77}}

By 1974, Weather had recognized this shortcoming and in ''Prairie Fire'' detailed a different strategy for the 1970s which demanded both mass and clandestine organizations. The role of the clandestine organization would be to build the "consciousness of action" and prepare the way for the development of a people's militia. Concurrently, the role of the mass movement (i.e., above ground Prairie Fire collective) would include support for, and encouragement of, armed action. Such an alliance would, according to Weather, "help create the 'sea' for the guerrillas to swim in".&lt;ref name=JacobsVerso /&gt;{{Rp|76–77}}

According to Bill Ayers in the late 1970s, the Weatherman group further split into two factions&amp;nbsp;— the [[May 19th Communist Organization]] and the Prairie Fire Collective&amp;nbsp;— with Bernardine Dohrn and Bill Ayers in the latter. The Prairie Fire Collective favored coming out of hiding and establishing an above-ground revolutionary mass movement. With most WUO members facing the limited criminal charges (most charges had been dropped by the government in 1973) against them creating an above ground organization was more feasible. The May 19 Communist Organization continued in hiding as the clandestine organization. A decisive factor in Dohrn's coming out of hiding were her concerns about her children.&lt;ref&gt;Bill Ayers, ''Fugitive Days: Memoirs of an Antiwar Activist'', Beacon Press, 2001, 978-0-8070-3277-0&lt;/ref&gt; The Prairie Fire Collective faction started to surrender to the authorities from the late 1970s to the early 1980s. The remaining Weather Underground members continued to attack U.S. institutions.

==COINTELPRO==
{{Main|COINTELPRO}}

===Event===
In April 1971, the "[[Citizens' Commission to Investigate the FBI]]" broke into an FBI office in [[Media, Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;David Cunningham, ''There's Something Happening Here: the New Left, the Klan, and FBI Counterintelligence'', (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2004), 33.&lt;/ref&gt; The group stole files with several hundred pages. The files detailed the targeting of civil rights leaders, labor rights organizations, and left wing groups in general, and included documentation of acts of intimidation and disinformation by the FBI, and attempts to erode public support for those popular movements. By the end of April, the FBI offices were to terminate all files dealing with leftist groups.&lt;ref&gt;David Cunningham, ''There's Something Happening Here: the New Left, the Klan, and FBI Counterintelligence'', (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2004), 35.&lt;/ref&gt; The files were a part of an FBI program called COINTELPRO.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icdc.com/~paulwolf/cointelpro/cointel.htm]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130113101622/http://www.icdc.com/~paulwolf/cointelpro/cointel.htm |date=January 13, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After COINTELPRO was dissolved in 1971 by J. Edgar Hoover,&lt;ref&gt;Nelson Blackstock, Cointelpro: The FBI's Secret War on Political Freedom, (New York: Anchor Foundation, 1990), 185.&lt;/ref&gt; the FBI continued its counterintelligence on groups like the Weather Underground. In 1973, the FBI established the "Special Target Information Development" program, where agents were sent undercover to penetrate the Weather Underground. Due to the illegal tactics of FBI agents involved with the program, government attorneys requested all weapons- and bomb-related charges be dropped against the Weather Underground. The most well-publicized of these tactics were the "[[Black bag operation|black-bag jobs]]," referring to searches conducted in the homes of relatives and acquaintances of Weatherman.&lt;ref name=Varon3 /&gt; The Weather Underground was no longer a fugitive organization and could turn themselves in with minimal charges against them.&lt;ref name=Varon3 /&gt; Additionally, the illegal domestic spying conducted by the CIA in collaboration with the FBI also lessened the legal repercussions for Weatherman turning themselves in.&lt;ref name=Varon3 /&gt;

===Investigation and trial===
After the [[Church Committee]] revealed the FBI's illegal activities, many agents were investigated. In 1976, former FBI Associate Director [[W. Mark Felt]] publicly stated he had ordered break-ins and that individual agents were merely obeying orders and should not be punished for it. Felt also stated that acting Director [[L. Patrick Gray]] had also authorized the break-ins, but Gray denied this. Felt said on the CBS television program ''Face the Nation'' that he would probably be a "[[scapegoat]]" for the Bureau's work.&lt;ref&gt;John Crewdson (August 30, 1976), "Ex-F.B.I. Aide Sees 'Scapegoat' Role", ''The New York Times'', p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; "I think this is justified and I'd do it again tomorrow," he said on the program. While admitting the break-ins were "extralegal," he justified it as protecting the "greater good." Felt said, "To not take action against these people and know of a bombing in advance would simply be to stick your fingers in your ears and protect your eardrums when the explosion went off and then start the investigation."

The Attorney General in the new [[Carter administration]], [[Griffin B. Bell]], investigated, and on April 10, 1978, a federal grand jury charged Felt, [[Edward S. Miller]], and Gray with conspiracy to violate the constitutional rights of American citizens by searching their homes without warrants. The case did not go to trial and was dropped by the government for lack of evidence on December 11, 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jacobs|first1=Ron|title=The Way the Wind Blew: A History of the Weather Underground|date=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The indictment charged violations of Title 18, Section 241 of the [[United States Code]]. The indictment charged Felt and the others "did unlawfully, willfully, and knowingly combine, conspire, confederate, and agree together and with each other to injure and oppress citizens of the United States who were relatives and acquaintances of the Weatherman fugitives, in the free exercise and enjoyments of certain rights and privileges secured to them by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America.?&lt;ref&gt;Felt, FBI Pyramid, p. 333.&lt;/ref&gt;

Felt and Miller attempted to plea bargain with the government, willing to agree to a misdemeanor guilty plea to conducting searches without warrants—a violation of 18 U.S.C. sec. 2236—but the government rejected the offer in 1979. After eight postponements, the case against Felt and Miller went to trial in the [[United States District Court for the District of Columbia]] on September 18, 1980.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Pear: "Conspiracy Trial for 2 Ex-F.B.I. Officials Accused in Break-ins", ''The New York Times'', September 19, 1980; &amp; "Long Delayed Trial Over F.B.I. Break-ins to Start in Capital Tomorrow", ''The New York Times'', September 14, 1980, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; On October 29, former President [[Richard Nixon]] appeared as a rebuttal witness for the defense, and testified that presidents since [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] had authorized the bureau to engage in break-ins while conducting foreign intelligence and counterespionage investigations.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Pear, "Testimony by Nixon Heard in F.B.I. Trial", ''The New York Times'', October 30, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was Nixon's first courtroom appearance since his resignation in 1974. Nixon also contributed money to Felt's legal defense fund, with Felt's legal expenses running over $600,000. Also testifying were former Attorneys General [[Herbert Brownell Jr.]], [[Nicholas Katzenbach]], [[Ramsey Clark]], [[John N. Mitchell]], and [[Richard G. Kleindienst]], all of whom said warrantless searches in [[national security]] matters were commonplace and not understood to be illegal, but Mitchell and Kleindienst denied they had authorized any of the break-ins at issue in the trial.

The jury returned guilty verdicts on November 6, 1980. Although the charge carried a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison, Felt was fined $5,000. (Miller was fined $3,500).&lt;ref&gt;Kessler, F.B.I.: Inside the Agency, p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in ''[[The New York Times]]'' a week after the conviction, [[Roy Cohn]] claimed that Felt and Miller were being used as scapegoats by the Carter administration and that it was an unfair prosecution. Cohn wrote it was the "final dirty trick" and that there had been no "personal motive" to their actions.&lt;ref&gt;Roy Cohn, "Stabbing the F.B.I.", ''The New York Times'', November 15, 1980, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Times'' saluted the convictions, saying that it showed "the case has established that zeal is no excuse for violating the Constitution".&lt;ref&gt;"The Right Punishment for F.B.I. Crimes." (Editorial), ''The New York Times'', December 18, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; Felt and Miller appealed the verdict, and they were later pardoned by [[Ronald Reagan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reagan.utexas.edu/archives/speeches/1981/41581d.htm |title=Statement on Granting Pardons to W.

==Dissolution==
Despite the change in their legal status, the Weather Underground remained underground for a few more years. However, by 1976 the organization was disintegrating. The Weather Underground held a conference in Chicago called Hard Times. The idea was to create an umbrella organization for all radical groups. However, the event turned sour when Hispanic and Black groups accused the Weather Underground and the Prairie Fire Committee of limiting their roles in racial issues.&lt;ref name=Varon3 /&gt; The Weather Underground faced accusations of abandonment of the revolution by reversing their original ideology.

The conference increased divisions within the Weather Underground. East coast members favored a commitment to violence and challenged commitments of old leaders, [[Bernardine Dohrn]], [[Bill Ayers]], and [[Jeff Jones (activist)|Jeff Jones]]. These older members found they were no longer liable for federal prosecution because of illegal wire taps and the government's unwillingness to reveal sources and methods favored a strategy of inversion where they would be above ground "revolutionary leaders". Jeremy Varon argues that by 1977 the WUO had disbanded.&lt;ref name = Varon3 /&gt;

The federal government estimated that only 38 Weathermen had gone underground in 1970, though the estimates varied widely, according to a variety of official and unofficial sources, as between 50 and 600 members.

===Plot to bomb office of California Senator===
In November 1977 five WUO members were arrested on conspiracy to bomb the office of California State Senator [[John Briggs (politician)|John Briggs]]. It was later revealed that the Revolutionary Committee and PFOC had been infiltrated by the FBI for almost six years. FBI agents Richard J. Gianotti and William D. Reagan lost their cover in November when federal judges needed their testimony to issue warrants for the arrest of [[Clayton Van Lydegraf]] and four Weather people. The arrests were the results of the infiltration.&lt;ref name=g38&gt;Gilbert 38&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Nation: Infiltrating the Underground

Within two years, many members turned themselves in after taking advantage of President [[Jimmy Carter]]'s amnesty for draft dodgers.&lt;ref name="Jacobs" /&gt; Mark Rudd turned himself in to authorities on January 20, 1978. Rudd was fined $4,000 and received two years probation.&lt;ref name="Jacobs" /&gt; Bernardine Dohrn and Bill Ayers turned themselves in on December 3, 1980, in New York, with substantial media coverage. Charges were dropped for Ayers. Dohrn received three years probation and a $15,000 fine.&lt;ref name="Jacobs" /&gt;

===Brinks robbery===
{{Main|Brink's robbery (1981)}}
Some members remained underground and joined splinter radical groups. The US government states that years after the dissolution of the Weather Underground, three former members, [[Kathy Boudin]], [[Judith Alice Clark]], and [[David Gilbert (activist)|David Gilbert]], joined the May 19 Communist Organization, and on October 20, 1981 in [[Nanuet]], New York, the group helped the [[Black Liberation Army]] [[Brinks robbery (1981)|rob a Brinks armored truck]] containing $1.6 million. The robbery was violent, resulting in the deaths of three people including Waverly Brown, the first black police officer on the [[Nyack, New York|Nyack]] police force.&lt;ref name="Jacobs" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Batson|first1=Bill|title=Nyack Sketch Log: The Brink's Robbery|url=http://www.nyacknewsandviews.com/2011/10/bb_brinksrobbery20111018/|website=NyackNewsandViews}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Boudin, Clark, and Gilbert were found guilty and sentenced to lengthy terms in prison.

===May 19th Communist Organization===
{{Main|May 19th Communist Organization}}
The Weather Underground members involved in the [[May 19th Communist Organization]] alliance with the Black Liberation Army continued in a series of jail breaks, armed robberies and bombings until most members were finally arrested in 1985 and sentenced as part of the Brinks robbery and the [[Resistance Conspiracy case]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=May 19 Communist Order|url=http://www.trackingterrorism.org/group/may-19-communist-order-m19co?ip_login_no_cache=601a108ae35afef68dde7a0db31c0683|website=trackingterrorism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Coalitions with non-WUO members==
{{Main|Mother Right and the WUO|Jane Alpert}}
Throughout the underground years, the Weather Underground members worked closely with their counterparts in other organizations, including Jane Alpert, to bring attention their further actions to the press. She helped Weatherman pursue their main goal of overthrowing the U.S. government through her writings.&lt;ref name="alpert 1981"&gt;Alpert, Jane (1981). Growing up Underground. New York: Morrow &amp; Co, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there were tensions within the organization, brought about by her famous manifesto, "Mother Right", that specifically called on the female members of the organization to focus on their own cause rather than anti-imperialist causes.&lt;ref name=alpert&gt;Alpert, Jane (1974). ''Mother Right: A New Feminist Theory''. Pittsburgh: Know, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;  Weather members then wrote in response to her manifesto.

==Legacy==
Widely known members of the Weather Underground include [[Kathy Boudin]], [[Linda Sue Evans]], [[Brian Flanagan]], [[David Gilbert (activist)|David Gilbert]], [[Ted Gold]], [[Naomi Jaffe]], [[Jeff Jones (activist)|Jeff Jones]], Joe Kelly, [[Diana Oughton]], [[Eleanor Raskin]], [[Terry Robbins]], [[Mark Rudd]], [[Matthew Steen]], [[Susan Stern]], [[Laura Whitehorn]], [[Cathlyn Platt Wilkerson|Cathy Wilkerson]], and the still-married couple [[Bernardine Dohrn]] and [[Bill Ayers]]. Most former Weathermen have successfully re-integrated into mainstream society, without necessarily repudiating their original intent.

In his 2001 book about his Weatherman experiences, Bill Ayers stated his objection to describing the WUO as terrorist. Ayers wrote: "Terrorists terrorize, they kill innocent civilians, while we organized and agitated. Terrorists destroy randomly, while our actions bore, we hoped, the precise stamp of a cut diamond. Terrorists intimidate, while we aimed only to educate. No, we're not terrorists."&lt;ref&gt;Ayers, Bill, ''Fugitive Days'', Beacon Press, {{ISBN|0-8070-7124-2}}, p 263&lt;/ref&gt; Dan Berger, in his book about the Weatherman, ''Outlaws in America'', asserts that the group "purposefully and successfully avoided injuring anyone&amp;nbsp;... Its war against property by definition means that the WUO was not a terrorist organization."&lt;ref name=db&gt;Berger, Dan, ''Outlaws of America: The Weather Underground and the Politics of Solidarity'', AK Press: Oakland, California, 2006, {{ISBN|1-904859-41-0}} pp 286-287; the book describes Berger as "a writer, activist, and PhD candidate", and the book is dedicated to his grandmother and to Weatherman member [[David Gilbert (activist)|David Gilbert]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The late 1960s and early 1970s were tumultuous times, with the FBI attributing 1500 bombings in just 1972 to "civil unrest" by radical groups.&lt;ref name="Jamison"&gt;{{cite web|author=Peter Jamison |url=http://www.riverfronttimes.com/2009-09-16/news/blown-to-peaces-weather-underground-leaders-claimed-bombings-devised-to-avoid-bloodshed-fbi-agents-suspect-radical-70s-group-killed-cop-in-name-of-revolution/1/ |title=Blown to Peaces: Weather Underground leaders claimed their bombings were devised to avoid bloodshed.

{{Quote|On the morning of March 6, 1970, three of my comrades were building pipe bombs packed with dynamite and nails, destined for a dance of non-commissioned officers and their dates at Fort Dix, N.J., that night. Still trying to "bring the war home", their bombs were crude mirrors of the anti-personnel weapons the U.S. was raining down on Indochina. [...]  We talk about non-violence as the only possible winning strategy. But our goal is a majority movement to end war and global injustice. I believe such a thing is possible in this country. From my own experience I know that the American people see no distinction between violence against property and violence against human beings. Political violence is a category which does not exist: it is just violence, defined as either criminal or insane or both. That's a very bad position to put yourself into. It's guaranteed failure. After the Townhouse, when the Weather Underground turned to bombing symbolic targets like empty corporate offices, it made us no less isolated. As self-expression violence can make perfect sense; as political activity to build a movement, none at all. Besides, the U.S. government will always win a test of who can do the most violence.&lt;ref name="name"&gt;{{cite web

Prompted in part by claims made by informants working for the FBI within the Weather Underground, grand juries were convened in 2001 and 2009 to investigate if Weather Underground was responsible for the [[San Francisco Police Department Park Station bombing]], in which one officer was fatally wounded, one maimed and eight more wounded by shrapnel from a pipe bomb. Ultimately, it was concluded that members of the Black Liberation Army, whom WUO members affiliated with while underground, were responsible for not only this action, but also the bombing of another police precinct in San Francisco, as well as bombing the Catholic Church funeral services of the police officer killed in the Park Precinct bombing in the early summer of 1970.&lt;ref name="Jamison" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Allegiance to Liberty: The Changing Face of Patriots, Militias, and Political Violence in America''; Barry J.

Mark Rudd, now a teacher of mathematics at [[Central New Mexico Community College]], has said he doesn't speak publicly about his experiences because he has "mixed feelings, guilt and shame ...".

{{quote|These are things I am not proud of, and I find it hard to speak publicly about them and to tease out what was right from what was wrong. I think that part of the Weatherman phenomenon that was right was our understanding of what the position of the United States is in the world. It was this knowledge that we just couldn't handle; it was too big. We didn't know what to do. In a way I still don't know what to do with this knowledge. I don't know what needs to be done now, and it's still eating away at me just as it did 30 years ago.|[[Mark Rudd]]&lt;ref name="The Weather Underground" /&gt;}}

A faction of the Weather Underground continues today as the [[Prairie Fire Organizing Committee]]. Their official site reads:

{{quote|We oppose oppression in all its forms including [[racism]], [[sexism]], [[homophobia]], [[Class discrimination|classism]] and [[imperialism]]. We demand liberation and justice for all peoples. We recognize that we live in a capitalist system that favors a select few and oppresses the majority.

The site further supports non-violent civil disobedience and direct action:

{{quote|We also respect the right of people to take up armed struggle against colonialism for the liberation of oppressed peoples.

'''''Wild Strawberries''''' is a 1957 Swedish [[drama (film and television)|drama film]] written and directed by [[Ingmar Bergman]]. The original [[Swedish language|Swedish]] title is '''''Smultronstället''''', which literally means "The [[Fragaria|wild strawberry]] patch" but idiomatically signifies an underrated gem of a place, often with personal or sentimental value. The cast includes [[Victor Sjöström]] in his final screen performance as an old man recalling his past, as well as Bergman regulars [[Bibi Andersson]], [[Ingrid Thulin]] and [[Gunnar Björnstrand]]. [[Max von Sydow]] also appears in a small role. Bergman wrote the screenplay while hospitalized.&lt;ref name=ingbergf2f&gt;{{cite web | url = http://ingmarbergman.se/en/node/11078 | title = Wild Strawberries | accessdate = 15 April 2007 | publisher=The Ingmar Bergman Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exploring philosophical themes such as [[introspection]] and [[human existence]], ''Wild Strawberries'' is often considered to be one of Bergman's greatest and most moving films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Ten Film Classics: A Re-viewing |last=Murray |first=Edward |publisher=F. Ungar Publishing Co. |year=1978 |isbn=978-0-8044-2650-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Grouchy, stubborn, and egotistical Professor Isak Borg is a widowed 78-year-old physician who specialized in bacteriology. Before specializing he served as general practitioner in rural Sweden. He sets out on a long car ride from [[Stockholm]] to [[Lund]] to be awarded the degree of [[Jubilee doctor|Doctor Jubilaris]] 50 years after he received his doctorate from [[Lund University]].  He is accompanied by his pregnant daughter-in-law Marianne who does not much like her father-in-law and is planning to separate from her husband, Evald, Isak's only son, who does not want her to have the baby, their first.

During the trip, Isak is forced by [[nightmare]]s, [[daydream]]s, [[old age]] and impending death to reevaluate his life. He meets a series of hitchhikers, each of whom sets off dreams or reveries into Borg's troubled past. The first group consists of two young men and their companion, a woman named Sara who is adored by both men. Sara is a double for the love of Isak's youth. The first group remains with him throughout his journey. Next Isak and Marianne pick up an embittered middle-aged couple, the Almans, whose vehicle has nearly collided with theirs. The pair exchanges such terrible vitriol and venom that Marianne stops the car and demands that they leave. The couple reminds Isak of his own unhappy marriage. In a dream sequence, Isak is asked by Sten Alman, now the examiner, to read “foreign” letters on the blackboard.  He cannot.  So, Alman reads it for him: "A doctor's first duty is to ask forgiveness," from which he concludes, "You are guilty of guilt."&lt;ref&gt;[[Erik Erikson]] [http://www.haverford.edu/psych/ddavis/p109g/erikson.strawberries.html “Wild Strawberries”].&lt;/ref&gt;

He reminisces about his childhood at the seaside and his sweetheart Sara, with whom he remembered gathering strawberries, but who instead married his brother. He is confronted by his loneliness and aloofness, recognizing these traits in both his ancient mother (whom they stop to visit) and in his middle-aged physician son, and he gradually begins to accept himself, his past, his present and his approaching death.&lt;ref name="gu"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/1999/jun/10/1|title=Ingmar Bergman: Wild Strawberries|date=10 June 1999|work=The Guardian | location=London | first=Derek | last=Malcolm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9D06E0DE173BEF3BBC4B51DFB0668382649EDE |title=Wild Strawberries (1957) NYT Critics' Pick |date=23 June 1959 |work=New York Times |accessdate=16 May 2010 |first=Bosley |last=Crowther}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/Films-Se-Sno/Smultronst-llet.html|title=Plot and review: SMULTRONSTÄLLET (Wild Stawberries)|last=Manvell|first=Roger|publisher=filmreference.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one dream, he is quizzed by a very judgmental medical professor; he is also praised by a small-town merchant who remembers him.

Borg finally arrives at his destination and is promoted to Doctor Jubilaris, but this proves to be an empty ritual. That night, he bids a loving goodbye to his young friends, to whom the once bitter old man whispers in response to a playful declaration of the young girl's love, "I'll remember."  As he goes to his bed in his son's home, he is overcome by a sense of peace, and dreams of a family picnic by a lake. Closure and affirmation of life have finally come, and Borg's face radiates joy.

==Production==

===Origins===
[[Image:Bergman Sjostrom 1957.jpg|thumb|right|Ingmar Bergman (L) and [[Victor Sjöström]] (R) in 1957, during production of ''Wild Strawberries'' in the studios in [[Solna Municipality|Solna]].]]
Bergman's idea for the film originated on a drive from [[Stockholm]] to [[Dalarna]] during which he stopped in [[Uppsala]], his hometown. Driving by his grandmother's house, he suddenly imagined how it would be if he could open the door and inside find everything just as it was during his childhood. "So it struck me — what if you could make a film about this; that you just walk up in a realistic way and open a door, and then you walk into your childhood, and then you open another door and come back to reality, and then you make a turn around a street corner and arrive in some other period of your existence, and everything goes on, lives. That was actually the idea behind ''Wild Strawberries''".&lt;ref&gt;Björkman&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=September 2015}} Later, he would revise the story of the film's genesis. In ''Images: My Life in Film,'' he comments on his own earlier statement: "That's a lie. The truth is that I am forever living in my childhood."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bergman|first1=Ingmar|title=Images: my life in film|date=1990|publisher=Arcade Publishing|isbn=9781559701860|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Development===
Bergman wrote the screenplay of ''Wild Strawberries'' in Stockholm's [[Karolinska University Hospital|Karolinska Hospital]] (the workplace of Isak Borg) in the late spring of 1957; he'd recently been given permission to proceed by producer Carl Anders Dymling on the basis of a short synopsis. He was in the hospital for two months, being treated for recurrent gastric problems and general stress. Bergman's doctor at Karolinska was his good friend Sture Helander who invited him to attend his lectures on psychosomatics. Helander was married to [[Gunnel Lindblom]] who was to play Isak's sister Charlotta in the film. Bergman was at a high point of his professional career after a triumphant season at the Malmö City Theatre (where he had been artistic director since 1952), in addition to the success of both ''[[Smiles of a Summer Night]]'' (1955) and ''[[The Seventh Seal]]'' (1957). His private life, however, was in disarray. His third marriage was on the rocks; his affair with [[Bibi Andersson]], which had begun in 1954, was coming to an end; and his relationship with his parents was, after an attempted reconciliation with his mother, at a desperately low ebb.{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}}

Casting and [[pre-production]] progressed rapidly. The completed screenplay is dated May 31. Shooting took place between July 2, 1957 and August 27, 1957.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Smultronstället (1957) - Filming Locations|url=http://www.sfi.se/en-GB/Swedish-film-database/Item/?itemid=4549&amp;type=MOVIE&amp;iv=RecordingPlace|website=Swedish Film Institute|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scenes at the summer house were filmed in [[Saltsjöbaden]], a fashionable resort in the Stockholm archipelago. Part of the nightmare sequence was shot with predawn summer light in [[Gamla stan]], the old part of central Stockholm. Most of the movie was made at SF's studio and on its back lot at Råsunda in northern Stockholm.&lt;ref name=ingbergf2f/&gt;

===Casting===
The director's immediate choice for the leading role of the old professor was [[Victor Sjöström]], Bergman's [[silent film]] idol and early counselor at [[AB Svensk Filmindustri|Svensk Filmindustri]], whom he had directed in ''[[To Joy (film)|To Joy]]'' eight years earlier. "Victor," Bergman remarked, "was feeling wretched and didn’t want to [do it];... he must have been seventy eight. He was misanthropic and tired and felt old. I had to use all my powers of persuasion to get him to play the part."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Björkman|first1=Stig|title=Bergman on Bergman|date=1973|publisher=Simon and Schuster|page=133}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Bergman on Bergman,'' he has stated that he only thought of Sjöström when the screenplay was complete, and that he asked Dymling to contact the famous actor and film director.&lt;ref&gt;Björkman, pg. 131&lt;/ref&gt; Yet in ''Images: My Life in Film,'' he claims, "It is probably worth noting that I never for a moment thought of Sjöström when I was writing the screenplay. The suggestion came from the film's producer, Carl Anders Dymling. As I recall, I thought long and hard before I agreed to let him have the part."&lt;ref&gt;Bergman, pg. 24&lt;/ref&gt;

During the shooting, the health of the 79-year-old Sjöström gave cause for concern. Dymling had persuaded him to take on the role with the words: "All you have to do is lie under a tree, eat wild strawberries and think about your past, so it's nothing too arduous." This was inaccurate and the burden of the film was completely on Sjöström who is in all but one scene of the film. Initially, Sjöström had problems with his lines which made him frustrated and angry. He would go off into a corner and beat his head against the wall in frustration, even to the point of drawing blood and producing bruises. He sometimes quibbled over details in the script. To unburden his revered mentor, Bergman made a pact with [[Ingrid Thulin]] that if anything went wrong during a scene, she would take the blame on herself. Things improved when they changed filming times so that Sjöström could get home in time for his customary late afternoon whisky at 5:00. Sjöström got along particularly well with [[Bibi Andersson]].&lt;ref name=ingbergf2f/&gt;

As usual, Bergman chose his collaborators from a team of actors and technicians with whom he had worked before in the cinema and the theater. As Sara, Bibi Andersson plays both Borg's childhood sweetheart who left him to marry his brother and a charming, energetic young woman who reminds him of that lost love. Andersson, then twenty one years old, was a member in Bergman's famed repertory company. He gave her a small part in his films ''Smiles of a Summer Night'' (1955) and as the jester's wife in ''[[The Seventh Seal]]'' (1957). She would continue to work for him in many more films, most notably in ''[[Persona (film)|Persona]]'' (1966). [[Ingrid Thulin]] plays Marianne, the sad, gentle and warm daughter-in-law of Borg. She appeared in other Bergman films as the mistress in ''[[Winter Light]]'' (1963) and as one of three sisters in ''[[Cries and Whispers]]'' (1972). Bergman's first wife, Else Fisher, made a brief uncredited appearance as Borg's mother in the final flashback; their daughter, Lena, played one of Isak's twin sisters.{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}}

==Reception==
''Wild Strawberries'' received strongly positive reviews in Sweden; its acting, script, and photography were common areas of praise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eJCGNAlqB0gC&amp;pg=PA231|title=Ingmar Bergman: A Reference Guide|page=231|last=Steene|first=Birgitta|publisher=Amsterdam University Press|date=2005|isbn=9053564063}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was among the films that cemented Bergman's international reputation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/141987%7C0/Wild-Strawberries.html|title=Wild Strawberries|last=Nixon|first=Rob|publisher=Turner Classic Movies, Inc.|accessdate=February 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; but American critics were not unanimous in their praise. A number of reviewers found its story puzzling. In ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[Bosley Crowther]] lauded the performances of Sjöström and Andersson but wrote, "This one is so thoroughly mystifying that we wonder whether Mr. Bergman himself knew what he was trying to say."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9D06E0DE173BEF3BBC4B51DFB0668382649EDE|title=Screen: Elusive Message; Wild Strawberries' Is a Swedish Import|last=Crowther|first=Bosley|newspaper=The New York Times|date=June 23, 1959|accessdate=February 12, 2017}} Crowther also notes “the Engish subtitles are not much help”, so some confusion was created by poor subtitles in the 1959 screening. To take just one example, in the review he states that it’s unclear if the main character was a physician or a doctor, whereas in the script this is eminently clear, in fact an important scene is when the traveling party stops to refuel and the gas attendant refuses to take payment for the gasoline and extols all the good that the “good doctor” has done for the community, to which the old man replies mostly to himself “maybe I should have stayed”.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1963 interview with ''Cinema'' magazine, director [[Stanley Kubrick]] listed the film as his second favourite of all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Ciment |first=Michel |title=Kubrick: Biographical Notes |year=1982 |publisher=The Kubrick Site |url=http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/amk/doc/milestones.html |accessdate=11 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is now considered one of Bergman's major works. In 2009, [[Roger Scruton]] wrote, "The camera stalks the unfolding story like a hunter, pausing to take aim at the present only to bring it into chafing proximity with the past. And the images, often grainy, with sharply foregrounded details, leave many objects lingering like ghosts in the out-of-focus hinterland. In ''Wild Strawberries'', things, like people, are saturated with the psychic states of their observers, drawn into the drama by a camera which endows each detail with a consciousness of its own. The result is not whimsical or arbitrary, but on the contrary, entirely objective, turning to realities at every point where the camera might otherwise be tempted to escape from them. ''Wild Strawberries'' is one of many examples of true cinematic art".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last = Scruton |first = Roger |title = Beauty| publisher= Oxford University Press |year = 2009 |isbn = |ref =|page=104 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the work was ranked 63rd in the ''[[Sight &amp; Sound]]'' critics' poll of the greatest films ever made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://explore.bfi.org.uk/sightandsoundpolls/2012/film/4ce2b6b6466ce |title='Wild Strawberries' (1957) |publisher=British Film Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its screenplay was listed in ''[[Total Film]]'' as one of the 50 best ever written.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/50-best-movie-screenplays/2/|title=50 Best Movie Screenplays|last=Kinnear|first=Simon|magazine=Total Film|date=September 30, 2013|accessdate=April 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and honors==
The film won the [[Golden Bear]] for Best Film at the [[8th Berlin International Film Festival]],&lt;ref name="Berlinale 1958"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/1958/03_preistr_ger_1958/03_Preistraeger_1958.html |title=Berlinale: Prize Winners |accessdate=3 January 2010 |work=berlinale.de}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Best Film" and "Best Actor" at the [[Mar del Plata Film Festival]] and won the [[Golden Globe]] for Best Foreign Film in 1960. It was also nominated for an [[Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Writing (Original Screenplay)|Original Screenplay]], but the nomination was refused by Bergman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Soares|first1=Andre|title=Ingmar Bergman vs. the Oscar|url=http://www.altfg.com/film/ingmar-bergman-oscar-wild-strawberries/|website=Alt Film Guide|accessdate=20 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film is included on the [[Vatican's list 45 films|Vatican Best Films List]], recommended for its portrayal of a man's "interior journey from pangs of regret and anxiety to a refreshing sense of peace and reconciliation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vatican Best Films List|url=http://www.usccb.org/fb/vaticanfilms.htm|website=U.S. Catholic Bishops — Office of Film and Broadcasting|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20011123195057/http://www.usccb.org/fb/vaticanfilms.htm|archivedate=23 November 2001|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
''Wild Strawberries'' influenced the [[Woody Allen]] films ''[[Stardust Memories]]'' (1980), ''[[Another Woman]]'' (1988), ''[[Crimes and Misdemeanors]]'' (1989), and ''[[Deconstructing Harry]]'' (1997). In ''Stardust Memories'', the film's plot is similar in that the protagonist, filmmaker Sandy Bates (Woody Allen), is attending a viewing of his films, while reminiscing about and reflecting on his life and past relationships and trying to fix and stabilize his current ones, which are infused with flashbacks and dream sequences.  In ''Another Woman'', the film's main character, Marion Post ([[Gena Rowlands]]), is also accused by friends and relatives of being cold and unfeeling, which forces her to reexamine her life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/another-woman-1988 | work=Chicago Sun-Times | title=Another Woman}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Allen also borrows several tropes from Bergman's film, such as having Lynn ([[Frances Conroy]]), Post's sister-in-law, tell her that her brother Paul ([[Harris Yulin]]) hates her and having a former student tell Post that her class changed her life. Allen has Post confront the demons of her past via several dream sequences and flashbacks that reveal important information to a viewer, as in ''Wild Strawberries''.  In ''Crimes and Misdemeanors'', Allen made reference to the scene in which Isak watches his family have dinner.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thefilmspectrum.com/?p=18576]&lt;/ref&gt;  In ''Deconstructing Harry'', the plot (that of an academic on a long drive to receive an honorary award from his old university, as well as the people whom he picks up, while reflecting upon his life's experiences, with dream sequences) essentially mirrors that of ''Wild Strawberries''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ebert|first1=Roger|title=Deconstructing Harry|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/deconstructing-harry-1997|website=RogerEbert.com|accessdate=20 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
