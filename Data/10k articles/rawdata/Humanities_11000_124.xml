      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="899">'''''Acta Curiae''''' (Latin meaning "acts of court"), are records of the proceedings in [[ecclesiastical courts]] and in quasi-ecclesiastical courts, particularly of universities. They are sometimes also known as Registers of the Chancellor's (or Vice-Chancellor's) Court. This type of court was often used by local people who were college servants, to settle minor legal disputes. Records of a Vice-Chancellor's Court at the [[University of Cambridge]], exist from 1549 to 1883.&lt;ref&gt;Beal, Peter.

{{Grammatical categories}}
In [[linguistics]], '''affect''' is an attitude or emotion that a speaker brings to an utterance. Affects such as sarcasm, contempt, dismissal, distaste, disgust, disbelief, exasperation, boredom, anger, joy, respect or disrespect, sympathy, pity, gratitude, wonder, admiration, humility, and awe are frequently conveyed through [[paralinguistic]] mechanisms such as [[intonation (linguistics)|intonation]], facial expression, and [[gesture]], and thus require recourse to punctuation or [[emoticon]]s when reduced to writing, but there are grammatical and lexical expressions of affect as well, such as [[pejorative]] and [[approbative]] or [[laudative]] expressions or inflections, [[adversative]] forms, [[honorifics (linguistics)|honorific and deferential language]], [[interrogative]]s and [[tag question]]s, and some types of [[evidentiality]].

==Lexical affect==
Lexical choices may [[Framing (social sciences)|frame]] speaker affect. Examples are ''slender'' (positive affect) vs. ''scrawny'' (negative affect), ''thrifty'' (positive) vs. ''stingy'' (negative), ''freedom fighter'' (positive) vs. ''terrorist'' (negative), etc.&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, M. L. 2003. ''Semantic relations and the lexicon.'' Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Grammatical affect==
In many languages of Europe, [[augmentative]] derivations are used to express contempt or other negative attitudes toward the noun being so modified, whereas [[diminutive]]s may express affection; on the other hand, diminutives are frequently used to belittle or be dismissive. For instance, in [[Spanish language|Spanish]], a name ending in diminutive ''-ito'' (masculine) or ''-ita'' (feminine) may be a [[term of endearment]], but ''señorito'' "little mister" for ''señor'' "mister" may be mocking. [[Polish language|Polish]] has a range of [[augmentative]] and [[diminutive]] forms, which express differences in affect. So, from ''żaba'' "a frog", besides ''żabucha'' for simply a big frog, there is augmentative ''żabsko'' to express distaste, ''żabisko'' if the frog is ugly, ''żabula'' if it is likeably awkward, etc.

Affect can also be conveyed by more subtle means. Duranti, for example, shows that the use of pronouns in Italian narration indicates that the character referred to is important to the narration, but is generally also a mark of positive speaker attitude toward the character.&lt;ref&gt;Duranti, A. 1984. "The social meaning of subject pronouns in Italian conversation." ''Text'' 4(4): 271–311.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Japanese language|Japanese]] and [[Korean language|Korean]], grammatical affect is conveyed both through [[honorific]], polite, and humble language, which affects both nouns and verbal inflection, but also with clause-final [[grammatical particle|particles]] that express a range of speaker emotions and attitudes toward what is being said. For instance, when asked in Japanese if what one is eating is good, one might say ''oishii'' "it's delicious" or ''mazui'' "it's bad" with various particles for nuance:

:''Oishii yo'' (making an assertion; explicitly informing that it is good)
:''Oishii wa!'' (expressing joy; feminine)
:''Oishii kedo'' ("it's good but ...")
:''Mazui ne'' ("it's bad, isn't it?" -- eliciting agreement)
:''Mazui mon'' (exasperated)

The same can be done in [[Korean language|Korean]]:

:맛있어요 ''Masi-issoyo'' (Neutral, polite)
:맛있군요 ''Masi-ittgunyo!'' (Surprised, elated)
:맛있잖아 ''Masi-ittjianha'' (lit. "It's not delicious," but connotes "It's delicious, no?")
:맛이 없다 ''Masi-eopda'' (the base verb form for 'bad tasting," used as a blunt, impolite statement)

In English and Japanese, the [[passive voice|passive]] of intransitive verbs may be used to express an adversative situation:

:{| class=wikitable
! !! English !! colspan=3|Japanese
|-
! rowspan=2|Active voice&lt;br&gt;(neutral affect)
| rowspan=2|It rained. || ''ame-ga''|| ''fut-ta''|| rowspan=2|雨が降った。
|-
| rain-[[nominative|{{sc|nom}}]]||fall-[[perfective|{{sc|pfv}}]]
|-
! rowspan=2|Passive voice&lt;br&gt;(negative affect)
| rowspan=2|I was rained on. || ''ame-ni'' ||''fu-rare-ta'' ||rowspan=2|雨に降られた。 
|-
| rain-[[dative case|{{sc|dat}}]]||fall-[[passive voice|{{sc|pass}}]]-{{sc|pfv}}
|}

In some languages with [[split intransitive]] grammars, such as the [[Central Pomo language]] of California, the choice of encoding an affected [[verb argument]] as an "object" ([[patientive case]]) reflects empathy or emotional involvement on the part of the speaker:&lt;ref&gt;Mithun, M. 1991. "Active/agentive case marking and its motivations." ''Language'' 67(3):510–546.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
:''For the ecclesiastical history, see [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Alba Pompeia]]
Alba's origins date from before the Roman civilization, connected probably to the presence of [[Celts|Celtic]] and [[Ligures|Ligurian]] tribes in the area.

The modern town occupies the site of ancient '''Alba Pompeia''', the name given after being officially recognized as a town by the [[Consul|Roman consul]] [[Pompeius Strabo|Gnaeus Pompeius Strabo]] while constructing a road from [[Acqui Terme|Aquae Statiellae]] ([[Acqui Terme|Acqui]]) to [[Turin|Augusta Taurinorum]] ([[Turin]]). Alba was the birthplace of [[Pertinax|Publius Helvius Pertinax]], briefly Roman emperor in 193.

After the fall of the [[Western Roman Empire|Western Empire]], the city was repeatedly sacked by [[Ostrogoths]], [[Burgundians]], [[Byzantine Greeks|Byzantines]], [[Lombards]], [[Franks]], [[Hungarians]] and [[Saracens]]. In the 11th century it became a free [[Medieval commune|commune]] (or [[Italian city-states|city-state]]) and was a member of the [[Lombard League]]. [[Montferrat]] and the [[House of Visconti|Visconti]] fought over the town; later it became a possession of the [[House of Gonzaga|Gonzaga]]. [[Charles Emmanuel I, Duke of Savoy|Charles Emmanuel I of Savoy]] conquered it twice, while later [[France]] and [[Spain]] battled for its possession. The [[War of the Mantuan Succession|Treaty of Cherasco]] (1631) assigned Alba definitively to [[Savoy]]. During [[Napoleonic Wars]], it was part of the [[Republic of Alba]] (1796) and of the [[Subalpine Republic]], both French clients, before being annexed to the [[First French Empire|French Empire]] in 1802. It was an [[arrondissement]] center in firstly [[Tanaro (department)|Tanaro department]] between 1802-1805, later in [[Stura]] one between 1805-1814 before liberation by Austrian troops. It was returned to Kingdom of Sardinia (Duchy of Savoy's name after gaining Sardinia in 1720) in 1814.

Alba won a Gold Medal for Military Valour for the heroic activity of its citizens in the [[Italian resistance movement]] during the course of [[World War II]]. On 10 October 1944, the town was liberated by partisans who established a [[Republic of Alba (1944)|Republic of Alba]] which for a few weeks was able to maintain its independence from the Fascist [[Italian Social Republic|Republic of Salò]]. The republic lasted to 2 November 1944, when Republic of Salo retook it. It was finally liberated by French troops on 2 May 1945.

==Geography==
Approximately located at about 50 km from the cities of [[Turin]] and Cuneo, Alba is placed on the right side of the river Tanaro. The climate is typically  more drought than in other lands at the north of the Po river. 

== Main sights ==
Of the Roman city, which had a polygonal form, parts of the [[City gate|fortified gate]] and remains of some edifices with marble and mosaics can still be seen.

Other attractions include:
*The ''Palazzo Comunale'' (13th century, housing a ''Nativity'' by [[Macrino d'Alba]] of 1501) and the Bishop's Palace.
*Some towers of the 14th and 15th centuries: Alba was once known as the "City with hundred towers".
*the Romanesque [[Alba Cathedral]] of ''San Lorenzo'' (''Duomo''), built in the 12th century, probably over holy edifices of Roman age. It was restructured in the 15th century, by bishop Andrea Novelli, and again in the following centuries. The current appearance is from the controversial restoration of the 19th century, of which the three portals and the crypt are from the original edifice. The church is well known for its wood-carved chorus made in 1512 by Bernardino Fossati. The current belfry, from the 12th century, includes entirely the original bell tower.
*The Gothic church of ''San Domenico'' (13th through 14th centuries), the most artistically relevant church in town. It has a noteworthy portal with a triple arch within a pointed arch, a polygonal apse and traces of Renaissance frescoes. During the [[Napoleonic Wars]] it was used a stable, and was reconsecrated on 22 June 1827.
*The Baroque church of St. John the Baptist, housing a ''Madonna of the Graces'' (1377) by Barnaba da Modena and a ''Madonna with Saints'' (1508) by Macrino d'Alba.

The city museums include the F. Eusebio Municipal Museum of Archaeology and [[Natural science|Natural Science]].

== Economy ==
In addition to traditional agriculture, Alba is a very important center of wine. In the area of Alba, in fact, there are 290 wineries that cultivate an area of {{convert|700|ha|acre}} of land, producing an average of 61,200 hL of wine annually.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vinostore.it/cittadelvino/cittaalba.php VinoStore.it]&lt;/ref&gt;

The wines of Alba are among the most renowned in Italy and are divided into:
* [[Denominazione di origine controllata|DOC]]: [[Barbera d'Alba|Barbera]], [[Dolcetto]], [[Nebbiolo]].
* [[Denominazione di origine controllata e garantita|DOCG]]: [[Barbaresco]], [[Barolo]], [[Moscato d'Asti|Moscato]].

The city has a thriving economy, boasting the confectionery industry's world-renowned [[Ferrero SpA|Ferrero]], the publishing house Società San Paolo and the textile firm [[Miroglio]].

The town also houses the largest cooperative credit bank of Italy, by number of partners,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://torino.repubblica.it/cronaca/2017/05/21/news/alba_oggi_14mila_soci_in_piazza_per_l_assemblea_della_banca_cooperativa-165978786/|title=Alba, oggi 14mila soci in piazza per l'assemblea della banca cooperativa più grande d'Italia |publisher = La Repubblica  |accessdate=2017-10-20 |  deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Banca d'Alba]], and the international food chain [[Eataly]]. UniEuro, the Italian chain of stores specializing in household electrical appliances and acquired by [[Dixons Retail]] in 2002, was also established in Alba.

Alba is also famous worldwide for its white [[truffle]]s, and its annual Truffle Festival.

'''Alberto Moreiras''' is a [[Spain|Spanish]]-born academic and cultural theorist who currently works at [[Texas A&amp;M University]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://hisp.tamu.edu/biopages/moreiras/ "Dr. Alberto Moreiras"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720053947/http://hisp.tamu.edu/biopages/moreiras/ |date=2011-07-20 }}. Department of Hispanic Studies Website, Texas A&amp;M University, accessed December 7, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Previously he taught at [[Duke University]] and at the Centre for Modern Thought at the [[University of Aberdeen]].

His publications include ''Tercer espacio'', ''The Exhaustion of Difference'', and ''Línea de sombra''.

In critic Juan Poblete's words, Moreiras's work "has been characterized thus far by a strong metacritical component whereby theoretical texts are continuously de/constructed in an investigation of both their epistemological status and their general political potential as interventions in a concrete field of forces."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Poblete|2004|p= 301}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="34647">'''Aniconism''' is the absence of material representations of the natural and [[supernatural]] world in various [[culture]]s, particularly in the [[monotheistic]] [[Abrahamic religions]]. This ban may extend from only [[God]] and deities to [[saint]] characters, all living beings, and everything that exists. The phenomenon is generally codified by the religious traditions and as such becomes a [[taboo]]. When enforced by the physical destruction of images, aniconism becomes [[iconoclasm]]. The word itself derives from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] εικων 'image' with the negative prefix ''an-'' (Greek [[privative alpha]]) and the suffix ''-[[-ism|ism]]'' (Greek -ισμος).

==General aspects==
'''Monotheist religions''' – Aniconism was shaped in monotheist religions by theological considerations and historical contexts. It emerged as a corollary of seeing God's position as the ultimate power holder, and the need to defend this unique status against competing external and internal forces, such as pagan idols and critical humans. Idolatry was seen as a threat to uniqueness, and one way that prophets and missionaries chose to fight it was through the prohibition of physical representations.  The same solution worked against the pretension of humans to have the same power of creation as God (hence their banishment from the Heavens, the destruction of [[Tower of Babel|Babel]], and the Second Commandment in the biblical texts).

'''Aniconism as a construction''' – Some modern scholars, working on various cultures, have gathered material showing that the idea of aniconism is in many cases an intellectual construction, suiting specific intents and historical contexts, rather than a fact of the tangible reality (Huntington for Buddhism, Clément for Islam and Bland for Judaism – see below in notes and references).

==In Buddhism==
{{Main article|Aniconism in Buddhism}}
[[File:MaraAssault.jpg|thumb|An aniconic representation of [[Mara (demon)|Mara]]'s assault on the [[Buddha]], 2nd century CE, [[Amravati|Amaravati]],  [[India]].]]
[[Buddhist art]] used to be aniconic: the [[Buddha]] was represented only through his symbols (an empty [[throne]], the [[Bodhi]] tree, the [[Buddha footprint|Buddha's footprints]], the [[prayer wheel]]). This reluctance toward anthropomorphic representations of the Buddha, and the sophisticated development of aniconic symbols to avoid it (even in narrative scenes where other human figures would appear), seem to be connected to one of the Buddha's sayings, reported in the [[Dighanikaya|Digha Nikaya]], that discouraged representations of himself after the extinction of his body.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} Although there is still some debate, the first [[anthropomorphic]] representations of the [[Buddha]] himself are often considered a result of the [[Greco-Buddhist]] interaction. {{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

In the late 20th century, the well-established theory of aniconism in Buddhist art had been criticized by one art historian,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-ADM/huntin.htm|title=Early Buddhist art and the theory of aniconism|publisher=|accessdate=24 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the question has been the subject of continuing debate.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/4629413 "Aniconism and the Multivalence of Emblems"], Vidya Dehejia, ''Ars Orientalis'', Vol. 21 (1991), pp. 45-66 (Dehejia 1991); [https://www.academia.edu/4194715/In_the_Absence_of_the_Buddha_Aniconism_and_the_Contentions_of_Buddhist_Art_History(Thompson 2011)]; DeCaroli, Robert 2014: Image Problems: Art, Text, and the Development of the Buddha Image in Early South Asia.(DeCaroli 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Hinduism==
[[Image:Aikya Linga in Varanasi.jpg|thumb|Traditional flower offering to the aniconic [[Shiva linga]] in [[Varanasi]]]]
Although aniconism is better known in connection to [[Abrahamic religions]], basic patterns are shared between various religious beliefs including Hinduism, which also has aniconistic beliefs. For example, although Hinduism is commonly represented by such [[anthropomorphic]] religious [[murti]]s, aniconism is equally represented with such abstract symbols of God such as the [[Shiva linga]] and the [[saligrama]].&lt;ref&gt;Hinduism: Beliefs and Practices, by Jeanne Fowler, pgs. 42-43, at [https://books.google.com/books?id=RmGKHu20hA0C&amp;pg=PA42&amp;dq=Hinduism+murtis+shiva+linga&amp;lr=&amp;cd=18#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Books.Google.com] and Flipside of Hindu symbolism, by M. K. V. Narayan at pgs. 84-85 at [https://books.google.com/books?id=ewRfp4qpvt4C&amp;pg=PA84&amp;dq=Hinduism+murtis+saligrama&amp;lr=&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Books.Google.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Hindus have found it easier to focus on anthropomorphic icons, because god [[Krishna]] said in the [[Bhagavad Gita]], chapter 12, verse 5, that it is much more difficult to focus on God as the unmanifested than God with form, because human beings have a need to perceive via the senses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bhagavad-gita.org/Gita/verse-12-04.html|title=Bhagavad-Gita: Chapter 12, Verse 5|publisher=|accessdate=24 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Christianity==
{{main article|Aniconism in Christianity}}

===Byzantine iconoclasm===
{{main article|Byzantine iconoclasm}}
There were two periods of iconoclasm, or icon-destruction, in the [[Byzantine Empire]], in the mid eighth and early ninth centuries. The political aspects of the conflicts are complex, dealing with the relationship between the Byzantine Emperors, the [[Catholic Church]] and [[Orthodox Christianity|Orthodox Church]] councils, and the [[Pope]]. Theologically, the debate, as with most in Orthodox theology at the time, revolved around the two natures of [[Jesus]]. Iconoclasts believed that icons could not represent both the divine and the human natures of the Messiah at the same time, but separately. Because an icon which depicted Jesus as purely physical would be [[Nestorianism]], and one which showed Him as both human and divine would not be able to do so without confusing the two natures into one mixed nature, which was [[Monophysitism]], all icons were thus heretical. Reference was also made to the prohibitions on the worship of graven images in the [[Mosaic Law]].

===During the Protestant Reformation===
{{main article|The Reformation and art}}
Aniconism was also prevalent during the [[Protestant Reformation]], when some Protestants began to preach rejection of what they perceived as idolatrous Catholic practices which filled its churches with pictures, statues, or relics of saints. The Reformed (Calvinist) churches and certain sects (most notably the Puritans and some of the Baptist churches) began to prohibit the display of religious images.  A famous example of this comes from [[Oliver Cromwell]], who expelled [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]], and who once destroyed a golden relic placed in his church.

===Among Christians today===
In the [[Church of the East]], also known as the Nestorian church, opposition to religious images eventually became the norm due to the [[rise of Islam]] in the region, where it forbade any type of depictions of Saints and [[biblical prophets]]. As such, the Church was forced to get rid of their icons. This tradition is still in practice today, with many [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] churches lacking artistic depictions of biblical figures, including those of Jesus and Mary.&lt;ref name="Nestorian"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.touchstonemag.com/archives/article.php?id=21-05-027-f|title=The Shadow of Nestorius}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Amish]] continue to avoid photographs or any depictions of people; their children's dolls usually have blank faces.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amishnews.com/amisharticles/amishand%20photos.htm "The Amish &amp; Photographs" ''Amish Country'' News Article by Brad Igou, (1991, 2001)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Among [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], followers are prohibited from wearing religious themed jewelry displaying icons such as the cross, as idol worship is prohibited. Having images or sculptures of Jesus, Jehovah (God), and angels are also considered a taboo according to their interpretation of Exodus 20:4,5 and 1 Corinthians 10:14.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/2009094|title=Why Do Jehovah's Witnesses Not Use Images in Their Worship? — Watchtower ONLINE LIBRARY|website=wol.jw.org|language=en|access-date=2018-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Followers are also admonished to avoid any objects portraying depictions of the supernatural. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/101974120?q=images+of+supernatural&amp;p=par#h=20|title=You, Too, Can Become Free — Watchtower ONLINE LIBRARY|website=wol.jw.org|language=en|access-date=2018-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Islam==
{{main article|Aniconism in Islam}}

===Theological views===
The [[Qur'an]], the Islamic holy book, does not explicitly prohibit the depiction of human figures; it merely condemns idolatry (ex.: [[wikisource:Quran 5:87|5:92]], [[wikisource:Quran 21:51|21:52]]). Interdictions of figurative representation are present in the [[Hadith]], among a dozen of the hadith recorded during  the latter part of the period when they were being written down.  Because these hadith are tied to particular events in the life of the Prophet [[Muhammad]], they need to be interpreted in order to be applied in any general manner. [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] exegetes, from the 9th century onward, increasingly saw in them categorical prohibitions against producing and using any representation of living beings. There are variations between religious [[Madhhab|schools]] and marked differences between different [[Divisions of Islam|branches]] of Islam. Aniconism is common among [[Islamic fundamentalism|fundamentalist]] Sunni sects such as [[Salafis]] and [[Wahhabis]] (which are also often [[iconoclastic]]), and less prevalent among [[liberal movements in Islam]]. [[Shia|Shi'a]] and [[Sufi|mystical orders]] also have less stringent views on aniconism.  On the individual level, whether or not specific Muslims believe in aniconism may depend on how much credence is given to hadith (e.g. [[Submitters]] do not believe in any hadith), and how liberal or strict they are in personal practice.

Aniconism in Islam not only deals with the material image, but touches upon mental representations as well. It is a thorny question, discussed by early theologians, as to how to describe God, Muhammad and other prophets, and, indeed, if it is permissible at all to do so. [[Allah|God]] is usually represented by immaterial attributes, such as "holy" or "merciful", commonly known from His "[[99 Names of God|Ninety-nine beautiful names]]". Muhammad's physical appearance, however, is amply described, particularly in the traditions on his life and deeds ''[[Sira al-Nabi]]''. Of no less interest is the validity of sightings of holy personages made during dreams.

===Aniconism in practice===
[[File:Miraj by Sultan Muhammad.jpg|thumb|[[Persian miniature]] painting from the 16th century CE, depicting Muhammad, his face veiled, ascending on the [[Buraq]] into the Heavens, a journey known as the [[Isra and Mi'raj|Mi'raj]].]]
'''Religious core''' – In practice, the core of normative religion in [[Islam]] is consistently aniconic. Its embodiment are spaces such as the [[mosque]] and objects like the [[Qur'an]] or the white dress of pilgrims entering [[Mecca]], deprived of figurative images. Other spheres of religion – schisms, mysticism, popular piety, private level – exhibit in this regard significant variability. Profane aniconism is even more fluctuating. Generally speaking aniconsim in Islamic societies is restricted in modern times to specific religious contexts, while its prevalence in the past wasn't enforced in numerous areas and during extended periods.

'''Present''' – Depending on which segment of Islamic societies are referred to, the application of aniconism is characterized with noteworthy differences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brill.nl/m_catalogue_sub6_id7561.htm |title=See 'Sura' and 'Taswir' in ''Encyclopaedia of Islam''|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929230552/http://www.brill.nl/m_catalogue_sub6_id7561.htm |archive-date=2007-09-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Factors are the epoch considered, the country, the religious orientation, the political intent, the popular beliefs, the private benefit or the dichotomy between reality and discourse.  Today, the concept of an aniconic Islam coexists with a daily life for Muslims awash with images.  TV stations and newspapers (which do present still and moving representations of living beings) have an exceptional impact on public opinion, sometimes, as in the case of [[Al Jazeera|Al-Jazira]], with a global reach, beyond the Arabic speaking and Muslim audience. Portraits of secular and religious leaders are omnipresent on banknotes &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://geoinfo.nmt.edu/staff/scholle/graphics/banknotes/SaudiNote22a.html |title=Petroleum-related banknotes: Saudi Arabia: Oil Refinery|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720014731/http://geoinfo.nmt.edu/staff/scholle/graphics/banknotes/SaudiNote22a.html |archive-date=July 20, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://geoinfo.nmt.edu/staff/scholle/graphics/banknotes/IranNote91c.html |title=Petroleum-related banknotes: Iran: Abadan Refinery, Iahanshahi-Amouzegar|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720015444/http://geoinfo.nmt.edu/staff/scholle/graphics/banknotes/IranNote91c.html |archive-date=July 20, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and coins,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://njmark0.tripod.com/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/.pond/bahrain500fills00000.jpg.w300h295.jpg}}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; in streets and offices (e.g.: presidents like [[Nasser]] and [[Mubarak]], [[Yasser Arafat|Arafat]], [[Hafiz Al-Asad|Al-Asad]] or [[Hezbollah]]'s [[Hasan Nasrallah|Nasrallah]] and ayatollah [[Khomeini]]). Anthropomorphic statues in public places are to be found in most Muslim countries  ([[Saddam|Saddam Hussain]]'s are infamous &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/2004/Jul/05/mn/mn03a.html |author=David Zucchino |title=U.S. military, not Iraqis, behind toppling of statue|newspaper=Honolulu Advertiser|date=July 5, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;), as well as Arts schools training sculptors and painters.  In the Egyptian countryside, it is fashionable to celebrate and advertise the returning of pilgrims from Mekka on the walls of their houses. Sometimes those who profess aniconism will practice figurative representation (cf. portraits of [[Taliban]]s from the [[Kandahar]] photographic studios during their imposed ban on photography&lt;ref&gt;J. L. Anderson, Thomas Dworzak, ''Taliban'', London (UK), Trolley, 2003, {{ISBN|0954264851}}.&lt;/ref&gt;). For [[Shia|Shi'a]] communities, portraits of the major figures of Shi'ite history are important elements of religious devotion. Portraits of '[[Ali]] – with veiled and unveiled face alike – can be bought in [[Iran]] around shrines and in the streets, to be hung in homes or carried with oneself, while in [[Pakistan]], [[India]] and [[Bangladesh]] they notoriously ornate trucks,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/200502/masterpieces.to.go.the.trucks.of.pakistan.htm|title=Saudi Aramco World : Masterpieces to Go: The Trucks of Pakistan|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|accessdate=24 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141008035126/http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/200502/masterpieces.to.go.the.trucks.of.pakistan.htm|archive-date=2014-10-08|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; buses and rickshas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webpak.net/~ricksha/|title=www.webpak.net|publisher=|accessdate=24 December 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091021211125/http://www.webpak.net/~ricksha/|archivedate=21 October 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contrary to the [[Sunni]] tradition, a photographic picture of the deceased can be placed on the [[Shia|Shi'ite]] tombs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.traveladventures.org/continents/asia/golestaneshohada2.shtml |title=Picture of Golestan e Shohoda cemetery Esfahan -Esfahan, Iran|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018075410/http://www.traveladventures.org/continents/asia/golestaneshohada2.shtml |archive-date=October 18, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bestirantravel.com/sights/mashad/martyrscemetry.html|title=Mashad MARTYRS CEMETERY at Best Iran Travel.com|publisher=|accessdate=24 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A curiosity in Iran is a [[Orientalism|Orientalist]] photography supposed to represent Prophet Muhammad as a young boy. The [[Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani|Grand Ayatollah Sistani]] of [[Najaf]] in [[Iraq]] has given a fatwa declaring the [[depiction of Muhammad]], the Prophets and other holy characters, permissible if it is made with the utmost respect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Grand Ayatollah Uzma Sistani |title=Fiqh &amp; Beliefs: Istifa answers |type=personal website |url=http://www.sistani.org/html/eng/menu/4/?lang=eng&amp;view=d&amp;code=234&amp;page=1  |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061017223013/http://www.sistani.org/html/eng/menu/4/?lang=eng&amp;view=d&amp;code=234&amp;page=1 |archivedate=2006-10-17 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Past''' – Neither is the representation of living beings in Islamic countries a modern phenomenon or due to current technology, westernization or the cult of the personality.

'''Circumvention methods''' – Medieval Muslim artists found various ways not to infringe any prohibition of the image, while still representing living beings. It can be argued that since God is absolute, the act of depiction  is his own and not that of a human; and miniatures are obviously very crude representations of the reality, so the two can't be mistaken.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/livres/article/2011/07/07/les-choses-comme-elles-sont-une-initiation-au-bouddhisme-ordinaire-d-herve-clerc-et-bouddha-mode-d-emploi-de-jack-kornfield_1545789_3260.html|title=Hervé Clerc et Jack Kornfield : championnats de Bouddha libre|first=Roger-Pol|last=Droit|date=7 July 2011|publisher=|accessdate=24 December 2016|via=Le Monde|newspaper=Le Monde.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the material level, prophets in manuscripts can have their face covered by a veil&lt;ref name="expositions1"/&gt; or all humans have a stroke drawn over their neck, a symbolical cut defending them to be alive.

==In Judaism==
{{main article|Aniconism in Judaism}}

===The Tanakh===
A number of verses in the [[Hebrew Bible]] ([[Tanakh]]) refer to prohibitions against the creation of various forms of images, invariably linked directly with [[idolatry]]. The strongest over-all source is based on what [[Judaism]] counts as the second of the [[Ten Commandments]]:

:Do not have any other gods before Me. ''Do not represent [such] gods by any carved statue or picture of anything in the heaven above, on the earth below, or in the water below the land''. Do not bow down to [such gods] or worship them. I am God your Lord, a God who demands exclusive worship.  Where My enemies are concerned, I keep in mind the sin of the fathers for [their] descendants, to the third and fourth [generation]. But for those who love Me and keep My commandments, I show love for thousands [of generations]. ([[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 20:3-6)

This prohibition is widespread. For instance, [[Leviticus]] 26:1 reads:

:[Therefore,] do not make yourselves false gods. ''Do not raise up a stone idol or a sacred pillar for yourselves.'' Do not place a kneeling stone in your land so that you can prostrate yourselves on it. I am God your Lord.

Similar injunctions appear in [[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] 33:52, [[Deuteronomy]] 4:16, and 27:15; in all cases, the creation of the image is associated with idolatry, and indeed, the words commonly translated as "image" or some variant thereof (פסל ''pesel'', שקוץ ''shikuts'') are generally used interchangeably with words typically translated as "idol" (e.g., אליל ''elil'').&lt;ref&gt;See http://search.  freefind.com/find.html?id=6433772&amp;pageid=r&amp;mode=ALL&amp;query=image&amp;n=0&amp;s=et for a list of all verses containing the word ''image'' as translated by the [[Jewish Publication Society of America Version|JPS edition]].&lt;/ref&gt; (An important exception is צלם ''tselem'', used in such verses as Genesis 1:26: "let us make man in our image". This word was not associated with idols.)

Based on these prohibitions, the Hebrew prophets, such as [[Isaiah]], [[Jeremiah]], [[Amos (prophet)|Amos]] and others, preached very strongly against idolatry.  In many of their sermons, as recorded in the biblical books bearing their names, the prophets regarded the use of religious images as a negative sign of assimilation into the surrounding [[pagan]] cultures of the time.

===The Halakha===
Despite the semantic association with idols, [[Halakha]] ("Jewish law") as taught by the [[Shulkhan Arukh]] ("Code of Jewish Law") and still practiced and applied by [[Orthodox Judaism]] today, interprets the verses as prohibiting the creation of certain types of graven images of people, angels, or astronomical bodies, whether or not they are actually used as idols. The Shulkhan Arukh states: "It is forbidden to make complete solid or raised images of people or angels, or any images of heavenly bodies except for purposes of study".&lt;ref name="Torah.org 2016"&gt;{{cite web|title=Shulchan-Aruch - Chapter 11 |website=Torah.org |url=http://torah.org/advanced/shulchan-aruch/classes/chapter11.html# |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160401043629/http://torah.org/advanced/shulchan-aruch/classes/chapter11.html%23 |archive-date=2016-04-01 |dead-url=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; ("Heavenly bodies" are included here because the stars and planets were worshipped by some religions in human forms.  Astronomical models for scientific purposes are permitted under the category of "study.") 
[[File:BH Exodus.jpg|thumb|450px|An illustration from the ''Birds' Head Haggadah'', c. 1300, illustration of the [[Book of Exodus]]. The fleeing Jews are depicted with birds' heads, while Pharaoh and most of the pursuing Egyptians have blank circles with or without eyes as heads; two of them, however, have bird's heads.  The [[Judenhut]] hats are typical of 14th-century Germany.]]

===Differences across media===
Although the prohibition applies mainly to sculpture, there are some authorities who prohibit two-dimensional full-face depictions.  Some base this upon their understanding of the [[Talmud]], and others based it upon [[Kabbalah]].  Of note is the portrait of Rabbi Tzvi Ashkenazi (known as "the Hakham Tzvi"),  which is housed in the  [http://www.jewishmuseum.org.uk/ Jewish Museum in London].  Based on his interpretation of this prohibition, the Hakham Tzvi refused to sit for his portrait.  However, the London Jewish Community wanted a portrait, so they commissioned the portrait to be done without the Hakham Tzvi's knowledge.  The Hakham Tzvi's son, Rabbi [[Jacob Emden]], says it was a perfect likeness.

Additionally, there is one type of representation, namely, [[bas-relief]] or raised representation on a flat surface, that is particularly problematic.  Rabbi [[Jacob Emden]] discusses a medal struck in honor of Rabbi [[Eliezer Horowitz]] that features Horowitz's portrait.  Emden ruled this violated the injunction against depictions.  Furthermore, many hold that such representations in the synagogue either violate this injunction or are not permitted, as they give the appearance of violating this injunction.  Most notably, Rabbi David ibn Zimra and Rabbi [[Joseph Karo]] hold that carvings of lions (e.g., representing the [[Lion of Judah]]) are inappropriate in synagogues.
[[File:Dura Europos fresco Jews cross Red Sea.jpg|thumb|''Crossing the Red Sea'', from [[Dura Europos synagogue]], with two [[Hand of God (art)|Hands of God]], 3rd century]]

On the other hand, some authorities hold that Judaism has no objection to photography or other forms of two-dimensional art, and depictions of humans can be seen in religious books such as the [[Passover]] [[Haggadah]], as well as children's books about biblical and historical personages.  Although most [[Hasidic]] Jews object to having televisions in their homes, this is not related to prohibitions against idolatry, but, rather, to the content of network and cable programming.  Hasidim of all groups regularly display portraits of their [[Rebbe]]s, and, in some communities, the children trade "rabbi cards" that are similar to [[baseball cards]].  In both [[Hasidic]] and [[Orthodox Judaism]], taking photographs or filming are forbidden on the [[Shabbat|Sabbath]] and [[Jewish holiday|Jewish holy days]], but this prohibition has nothing to do with idolatry.  Rather, it is related to the prohibition against [[39 categories of activity prohibited on Shabbat|working or creating]] on these days.

===In modern times===
Although, in biblical times, Jews were actively [[iconoclasm|iconoclasts]], physically tearing down and destroying idols of other religions located within their political jurisdiction, today there is more tolerance for other cultures.  In the state of [[Israel]], all religious sites, Jewish and non-Jewish alike, are protected by law.  Even though Jewish Law teaches that idolatry is forbidden to all of humanity as one of the seven [[Noahide Laws]], Jews today combat it through discussion, debate, and education, rather than the physical destruction of statues and shrines.  However, many traditional Jews still follow the prohibitions against entering places of idolatry, and will not attend functions held in buildings where there are religious statues.

In a refutation of the belief in an aniconic Judaism, and more generally in an underestimation of Jewish visual arts, the historian of ideas Kalman Bland recently proposed that the phenomenon is a modern construction, and that "Jewish aniconism crystallized simultaneously with the construction of modern Jewish identities".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pupress.princeton.edu/chapters/i6833.pdf|title=(Bland 2001:8)|website=princeton.edu|accessdate=2 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the Bahá'í Faith==
{{Main article|Aniconism in the Bahá'í Faith}}
For the followers of the [[Bahá'í Faith]], the photographs and depictions of the [[Báb]] and [[Bahá'u'lláh]], who are considered [[Manifestation of God|Manifestations of God]], are considered very precious.  They are viewed and handled with reverence and respect, and their existence itself is not considered offensive.  However, [[Shoghi Effendi]], the Guardian of the Bahá'í Faith, stated that believers should only view the images when they can be treated with the utmost respect, and not let them be exposed to the public or displayed in their private homes:
:"There is no objection that the believers look at the picture of Bahá'u'lláh, but they should do so with the utmost reverence, and should also not allow that it be exposed openly to the public, even in their private homes."
::(From a letter written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer, December 6, 1939, republished in ''Lights of Guidance'', p. 540)

Shoghi Effendi has also written in the ''Directives from the Guardian'' regarding the portrait of the [[Báb]]:
:"The portrait of the Báb should be regarded as an inestimable privilege and blessing to behold, as past generations were denied a glimpse of the Face of the Manifestation, once He had passed on."&lt;ref&gt;Shoghi Effendi: ''Directives from the Guardian'' Published in 1973.  Accessed on February 2, 2006 from http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/se/DG/dg-115.html.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;De Vries, Jelle:  ''The Babi Question You Mentioned?The Origins of the Bahá'í Community of the Netherlands'', pg. 243.  Peeters Publishers, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;
::(Shoghi Effendi, Directives from the Guardian, p. 43)

Two pictures of Bahá'u'lláh and a portrait of the Báb are on display at the [[Bahá'í World Centre]] in the [[International Archives]] building, where the Bahá'ís view it as part of an organized [[Bahá'í pilgrimage|pilgrimage]].

==Other religions==
In [[African art|Africa]] aniconism varies from culture to culture from elaborate masks and statues of humans and animals to their total absence. A common feature, however, across the continent is that the "High God" is not given material shape. On the [[Germanic peoples|Germanic tribes]], the Roman historian [[Tacitus]] writes the following: "They don't consider it mighty enough for the Heavens to depict Gods on walls or to display them in some human shape."&lt;ref&gt;{{de icon}}/{{la icon}} [[Publius Cornelius Tacitus]], "9. Götterverehrung", ''Germania (De origine et situ Germanorum liber)'', Reclam, Stuttgart, 2000, {{ISBN|3-15-009391-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; His observation is not general to all German people as documentary evidence suggests (see [[Ardre image stone]]s).

In [[Australian Aboriginal culture]] there is a prohibition and tribal lore and custom contravening the depiction of the newly or recently dead, including photographs, because it is believed that depicting them will inhibit their passage to the [[Dreamtime|Great Dreaming]] of the Ancestors. This has led some Australian newspapers to publish apologies alongside [[obituaries]].

[[File:Ashanti English Medieval Ewer.jpg|thumb|Asante Ewer, British Museum, 62.3 cm high (including lid)]]

The '''Asante Ewer''' or '''Asante Jug''' is a leaded [[bronze]] lidded jug dated to the 1390s.  It is a rare surviving example of an English bronze jug from the 14th century, with great significance for the study of bronze working in medieval England.  It was taken from [[Kumasi]] in [[Ashanti Empire|Asante]] (now [[Ghana]]) during the [[Fourth Anglo-Ashanti War]] in 1895, and since 1896 has been held by the [[British Museum]] in London.

The front of the Asante Jug is decorated with the [[Royal Arms of England]] from the late 14th century, surmounted by a crown, with two lion [[supporters]].  Above three lines of lettering in a [[Lombardic capitals|Lombardic script]], within a moulded band, read from the bottom: 
: "+ HE THAT WYL NOT SPARE WHEN HE MAY HE SHALL NOT / SPEND WHEN HE WOULD DEME THE BEST IN EVERY / DOWT TIL THE TROWTHE BE TRYID OWTE"
The inscription appears to be two English sentences, run together:
: "He that will not spare when he may he shall not spend when he would" and "Deem the best in every doubt until the truth be tried out".

The neck of the Asante Jug bears six [[roundel]]s, three on either side, each with a falcon spreading its wings, with one to each side of the spout and two either side of the handle.  On the lip are three lions facing left, and a stag in a circle facing right.  The seven-sided lid of the jug is original, decorated with a lion above a stag [[couchant]] in each segment.  The handle ends with a scrolled [[quatrefoil]].

Without the lid, the jug is {{convert|43.3|cm}} high, and the lid (including the overlapping underlip) is {{convert|19.6|cm}}.  When assembled with its lid, the jug is {{convert|62.3|cm}} high.  It weighs {{convert|18.6|kg}}, and has a capacity of {{convert|15.8|l}}.  When filled, it would be inconveniently heavy to use.

Only two similar jugs are known in the UK.  All have similar shapes, bear inscriptions in English with similar lettering, and were made from leaded bronze, an alloy of copper, tin and lead, cast in a two-part mould in a similar manner using bronze spacers to separate the inner and outer moulds, with similar heraldic decorative motifs.  The Asante jug is the largest, and the only one to retain its lid.  

Of the other two jugs, the smallest is [[Wenlok jug]] in Luton: it was sold by [[Alexander Fermor-Hesketh, 3rd Baron Hesketh]] in 2005.  The third is the [[Robinson jug]], which was found in a farmhouse in Norfolk in the 1879 and is now in the collection of the [[Victoria &amp; Albert Museum]].  The other two have fittings for a hinged lid but the lid has not survived.  

All three jugs were made in England.  The heraldic emblems on this jug link it to either [[Edward III]] or [[Richard II]].  The stag badges on the lid suggest Richard II, who used the white stag in the 1390s.  The jug was found in [[Manhyia Palace]] in Kumasi in 1895, but when and how it arrived in West Africa is not known.  It is speculated that it was carried from Europe to Africa in the Early Modern period as an impressive gift to present to an African ruler, having been bought cheaply there. There is a photograph taken in 1887 which shows the jug under a sacred tree at the royal palace.  

The jug was bought by the British Museum in 1896 from Major General [[Charles St Leger Barter]], who served in the [[Fourth Anglo-Ashanti War]] in December 1895 to February 1896 (also known as the Second Ashanti Expedition) which reached [[Kumasi]] and depose the [[Asantehene]] [[Prempeh I]].

Another plainer 14th century English lidded jug is in [[Leeds City Museum]].

'''''Authenticité''''' was the name given to the [[Chad]]ian president [[François (Ngarta) Tombalbaye]]'s attempt to remove foreign influence and promote southern Chadian culture throughout Chad during the 1970s. One of its most unpopular requirements was that [[civil servant]]s underwent the ''yondo'' [[initiation rite]]s common only amongst Tombalbaye's own subgroup of [[Sara people]] in southern Chad.

A similar concept, also called ''[[Authenticité (Zaire)|authenticité]]'', was introduced by [[Mobutu Sese Seko]] in [[Zaïre]].

The '''Belvedere on the Pfingstberg''' ({{lang-de|Belvedere auf dem Pfingstberg}}) is a large structure north of the [[New Garden (Potsdam)|New Garden]] in [[Potsdam]], [[Germany]], at the summit of [[Pfingstberg (Potsdam)|Pfingstberg]] hill. It was commissioned by King [[Friedrich Wilhelm IV]] of Prussia and built between 1847 and 1863 as a viewing platform.

The [[Belvedere (structure)|Belvedere]] forms part of the [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] [[Palaces and Parks of Potsdam and Berlin]], inscribed in 1999.

==History==
It was commissioned by King [[Friedrich Wilhelm IV]] of Prussia and as completed is only part of a substantially more extensive project for the hilltop site. The [[Belvedere (structure)|Belvedere]] was built, as its name suggests, as a viewing platform for visitors and contains only two modest scale rooms for entertainment, one in each upper tower. The mural decoration of these ([[Ancient Roman architecture|Roman]]-[[Etruscan architecture|Etruscan]] and [[Moorish architecture|Moorish]], respectively) is mostly now lost.

Architecturally [[eclecticism in architecture|eclectic]], the two towers are [[Renaissance Revival architecture|modelled on Italian Renaissance architecture]] whilst the wings are Roman in style and some of the detailed decoration is Greek-inspired. It was constructed between 1847 and 1863 with an interruption from 1852 to 1860. 

Based on sketches from the King, the architects, [[Ludwig Persius]], [[Friedrich August Stüler]] and {{Interlanguage link multi|Ludwig Ferdinand Hesse|de}}, drew detailed plans. The landscape architect [[Peter Joseph Lenné]] was responsible for the design of the grounds which are planted in the manner of the [[English landscape garden]], with [[serpentine shape|serpentine]] paths and dense copses of hardwood trees. These now obstruct views of the Belvedere from the park and almost all points in Potsdam, but are apparently as designed by Lenné.

The Belvedere fell into disrepair during World War II and was left abandoned in the period of the [[German Democratic Republic]]. It was repaired between 1988 and 2005 by an association formed by a group of local residents. Today, the Belvedere is open to visitors and is still managed by the ''Förderverein Pfingstberg e.V.'' who won major financial backing for the restoration. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.pfingstberg.de/werner-otto.html Association website&lt;/ref&gt; Major contributors included the ''Hermann Reemtsma Stiftung'' and [[Werner Otto (entrepreneur)|Werner Otto]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.spsg.de/schloesser-gaerten/objekt/belvedere-auf-dem-pfingstberg/ SPSG website&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The twin prospect towers from which the view over Potsdam is achieved rise above a very high podium. This is in the form of a three-sided courtyard with central reflecting pool. The three sides of the courtyard are themselves each capped with viewing terraces under colonnades - two [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]] and one with [[astylar]] round arches.

Visitors ascend by many steps both outside and inside, with the final ascent being made via a narrow iron spiral staircase. Because of the dense tree planting of the park the view can only be achieved from the upper level.

==Today==
Occasional concerts are held on a stage in the reflecting pool of the courtyard and the two Belvedere rooms are available as a marriage venue.

There are a number of '''books on British railway accidents''' which provide aid in the systematic study of the causes and effects of accidents, and their prevention.  There are common themes in many accidents (see [[Classification of railway accidents|Classification]]). Key books are listed here to avoid repeating them for each individual accident.

The [[doyen]] is [[L. T. C. Rolt]]'s ''Red for Danger'', first published in 1956, which takes a wide-ranging overview of over 100 accidents.  Most other books concentrate on a smaller number of specific accidents, described in more detail.  O.S. Nock's "Historic Railway Disasters" combines both approaches, with individual chapters on especially significant accidents such as [[Armagh rail disaster|Armagh]] and [[Quintinshill rail crash|Quintinshill]].  For accidents in the last 30 years and modern operating practice, Stanley Hall's four books are particularly good.  Apart from Schneider and Mase (1968/1970) and Faith (2001), all the books below are confined to British accidents.

The list below does not include books on individual accidents; for these, see [[Tay Bridge disaster|Tay Bridge]], [[Quintinshill rail crash|Quintinshill]], [[Harrow and Wealdstone rail crash|Harrow]], [[Hixon rail crash|Hixon]], [[Moorgate tube crash|Moorgate]] and [[Lockington rail crash|Lockington]].

An extremely valuable source now on the Internet is the Railways Archive compilation of official Railway Inspectorate Accident Reports - see "External Links" below.

'''Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh''' are four museums that are operated by the '''Carnegie Institute''' headquartered in the Carnegie Institute complex in the [[Oakland (Pittsburgh)|Oakland]] neighborhood of [[Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]]. The Carnegie Institute complex that includes the original museum, recital hall, and library  was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] on March 30, 1979.

==Portfolio==
Two of the Carnegie museums, the [[Carnegie Museum of Natural History]] and the [[Carnegie Museum of Art]], are both located in the Carnegie Institute and Library complex in Oakland, a landmark building listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] (ref #79002158, added 1979).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arch.state.pa.us/pdfs/H086611_01B.pdf |title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory Nomination Form: Carnegie Institute and Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh |year=1967 |accessdate=2010-06-08 }}{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; It also houses the Carnegie Music Hall and the main branch of the [[Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.nationalregisterofhistoricplaces.com/pa/Allegheny/state.html | title=National Register of Historical Places - PENNSYLVANIA (PA), Allegheny County | publisher=National Register of Historic Places.com | accessdate=2009-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other two museums, [[The Andy Warhol Museum]] and the [[Carnegie Science Center]], are located in separate facilities on Pittsburgh's [[North Shore (Pittsburgh)|North Shore]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.carnegiemuseums.org/interior.php?pageID=24|title=Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh {{!}} Events &amp; Facility Rentals|website=www.carnegiemuseums.org|language=en|access-date=2017-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Andy Warhol Museum==
{{Main article|The Andy Warhol Museum}}
[[File:Andy Warhol Museum.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Andy Warhol Museum]]Opened on May 15, 1994, the [[Andy Warhol]] Museum is the largest museum in the world dedicated to one artist.  The museum's collection includes over 4,000 Warhol art works in all [[Media (arts)|media]] - [[painting]]s, [[drawing]]s, [[screenprint|print]]s, [[photograph]]s, [[sculpture]]s, and [[Installation art|installation]]; the entire [[Andy Warhol Video Collection]], 228 four-minute [[Screen Tests]], and 45 other films by Warhol; and extensive archives, most notably Warhol's [[Time Capsules]].  While dedicated to Andy Warhol, the museum also hosts many exhibits by artists who push the boundaries of art, just as Warhol did.

==Carnegie Museum of Art==

When [[Andrew Carnegie]] envisioned a museum collection consisting of the "Old Masters of tomorrow", the Carnegie Museum of Art became, arguably, the first museum of [[modern art]] in the United States.  Founded in 1895, today it continues showcasing [[contemporary art]] by staging the [[Carnegie International]] exhibition every few years. Numerous significant works from the International exhibitions have been acquired for the museums' permanent collection including [[Winslow Homer]]'s ''The Wreck'' (1896) and [[James A. McNeill Whistler]]'s ''Arrangement in Black: Portrait of Señor Pablo de Sarasate'' (1884).{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}} The [[marble]] [[Hall of Sculpture]] replicates the interior of the [[Parthenon]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}} The [[Hall of Architecture]] contains the largest collection of [[plaster]] casts of architectural masterpieces in America and one of the three largest in the world.  The [[Heinz Architectural Center]], opened as part of the museum in 1993, is dedicated to the collection, study, and exhibition of architectural drawings and models.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}} In 2001 the museum acquired the archive of [[African-American]] photographer [[Charles "Teenie" Harris]], consisting of approximately 80,000 photographic negatives spanning from the 1930s to the 1970s. Many of these images have been catalogued and digitized and are available online via the [[Carnegie Museum of Art]] [https://web.archive.org/web/20070530072335/http://www.cmoa.org/searchcollections/ Collections Search].

The museum's permanent collection includes European and American decorative arts from the late seventeenth century to the present, works on paper, paintings, prints (notably Japanese prints), sculptures and installations.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

From the discovery of ''[[Diplodocus carnegii]]'' to the most complete ''[[Tyrannosaurus rex]]'' known to date passing by a brand new, yet-to-be-named species of [[oviraptorosaur]], Carnegie Museum of Natural History has one of the finest [[dinosaur]] collections in the world.  Other exhibits include [[Hillman Hall of Minerals and Gems]], [[Alcoa Foundation Hall of American Indians]], [[Polar World: Wyckoff Hall of Arctic Life]], [[Walton Hall of Ancient Egypt]], and [[Benedum Hall of Geology]]. The museum's [[Powdermill Nature Reserve]] was established in 1956 to serve as a field station for long-term studies of natural populations, and now forms the core of the museum's Center for Biodiversity and Ecosystems.  Research teams including Carnegie scientists have made critical discoveries such as ''[[Puijila darwini]]'', ''[[Castorocauda lutrasimilis]]'', and ''[[Hadrocodium wui]]''.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

{{Main article|Carnegie Science Center}}
Opened in 1991, but with a history that dates to October 24, 1939, the Carnegie Science Center is the most visited museum in Pittsburgh.  Among its attractions are the newly constructed Buhl Planetarium (which features the latest in digital projection technology), the Rangos Omnimax Theater, [[UPMC SportsWorks|SportsWorks]], the [[Miniature Railroad &amp; Village]], the [[USS Requin (SS-481)|USS ''Requin'']], a [[World War II]] [[submarine]], and [[Roboworld]].

Under the leadership of [[Robert Wilburn]], Buhl Science Center merged with the Carnegie Institute, and a new $40 million Carnegie Science Center was constructed.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

A '''cease and desist''' letter is a document sent to an individual or business to stop purportedly illegal activity ("cease") and not to restart  it ("desist"). The letter may warn that if the recipient does not discontinue specified conduct, or take certain actions, by deadlines set in the letter, that party may be sued.&lt;ref&gt;Gold, Michael Evan. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=ny5Gv2wr3_MC&amp;pg=PA17 An Introduction to Labor Law]'', p. 17 (Cornell University Press, 1998).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Trimble"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Trimble |first=Marketa |year=2010 |title=Setting Foot on Enemy Ground: Cease-and-Desist Letters, DMCA Notifications and Personal Jurisdiction in Declaratory Judgment Actions |url=http://scholars.law.unlv.edu/facpub/105 |journal=[[IDEA: The Intellectual Property Law Review]] |volume=50 |issue=4 |pages=777–830 |accessdate=2 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; When issued by a public authority, a cease and desist letter, being "a warning of impending judicial enforcement",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lorch|first=Robert Stuart|title=Democratic Process and Administrative Law|year=1980|publisher=Wayne State University Press|page=158|isbn=9780814315132}}&lt;/ref&gt; is most appropriately called a "cease and desist order".

Although cease and desist letters are not exclusively used in the area of [[intellectual property]], such letters "are frequently utilized in disputes concerning intellectual property and represent an important feature of the intellectual property law landscape".&lt;ref name="Trimble"/&gt; The holder of an intellectual property right such as a [[copyright]]ed work, a [[trademark]], or a [[patent]], may send the cease and desist letter to inform a third party "of the right holders' rights, identity, and intentions to enforce the rights". The letter may merely contain a licensing offer or may be an explicit threat of a lawsuit. A cease and desist letter often triggers [[licensing]] negotiations, and is a frequent first step towards [[litigation]].&lt;ref name="Trimble"/&gt;

Receiving numerous cease and desist letters may be very costly for the recipient. Each claim in the letters must be evaluated, and it should be decided whether to respond to the letters, "whether or not to obtain an attorney's opinion letter, prepare for a lawsuit, and perhaps initiate [in case of letters regarding a potential patent infringement] a search for alternatives and the development of design-around technologies".&lt;ref name="Trimble"/&gt;

Cease and desist letters are sometimes used to [[intimidation|intimidate]] recipients and can be "an effective tool used by corporations to chill the critical speech of [[gripe sites]] operators". A company owning a [[trademark]] may send such letter to a gripe site operator alleging a [[trademark infringement]], although the actual use of the trademark by the gripe site operator may fall under a [[Fair use (U.S. trademark law)|fair use]] exception (in compliance with, in the U.S., the protection of free speech under the [[First Amendment]]).&lt;ref name="braswell"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Braswell |first=Rachael |year=2007 |title=Consumer Gripe Sites, Intellectual Property Law, and the Use of Cease-and-Desist Letters to Chill Protected Speech on the Internet |url=http://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/iplj/vol17/iss4/10/ |journal=[[Fordham Intell.

They are conically shaped metal funnels and often have ridges down the sides. Normally about {{convert|12|-|18|inch}} in length, they taper to a fine point and are made with varying diameter holes at the end in order to disperse the sand in a controlled way. A Tibetan monk will usually tap glide a piece of wood over the ridges in order to slowly allow the sand to emerge through the hole through the vibrations created.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mysticalartsoftibet.org/mandala.htm|title=Mandala Sand Painting|publisher=Drepung Loseling Monastery|accessdate=16 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lacquerware and [[Mawangdui Silk Texts|Silk Texts]] recovered from [[Mawangdui]] (2nd century BC) there are an indication of the richness of local [[craft]] traditions. In 1904, Changsha was opened to foreign trade, and large numbers of Europeans and Americans settled there. Changsha was the site of Mao Zedong's conversion to communism. It was also the scene of major battles in the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Sino-Japanese War]] (1931–1945) and was briefly occupied by the Japanese. Changsha is now an important commercial, manufacturing and transportation centre.

== Etymology ==
The origins of the name "Changsha" in unknown. The name first appears in the 11th century BC, during the reign of [[King Cheng of Zhou|King Cheng]] of the [[Zhou dynasty]]: a vassal lord from the Changsha area sent a type of [[softshell turtle]] known as "Changsha softshell turtle" ({{zh|s=长沙鳖 |t=長沙鼈 |hp=Chángshā biē|links=no}}) to the Zhou king as a [[tribute]]. In the 2nd century AD, historian [[Ying Shao]] wrote that the [[Qin dynasty]] use of the name Changsha for the area was a continuance of its old name.&lt;ref&gt;''Zhongguo gujin diming dacidian'' 中国古今地名大词典 [Dictionary of Chinese Place-names Ancient and Modern] (Shanghai: Shanghai cishu chubanshe, 2005), 505.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{Main|History of Changsha}}

=== Pre-History ===
Development started around 3000 BC when Changsha developed with the proliferation of [[Longshan culture]], although there is no firm evidence of such a link.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chinaeducenter.com/en/cityguide/cgchangsha.php|title=Changsha City Guide - China Education Center|last=www.chinaeducenter.com|website=www.chinaeducenter.com|access-date=2017-01-19|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202060302/http://www.chinaeducenter.com/en/cityguide/cgchangsha.php|archivedate=2 February 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, pottery and bronze ware have been discovered.[[File:四羊方尊.jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[Four-goat Square Zun]]]]

==== Folklore ====
In the [[Zhongyuan|Central Plain]] region during the [[Zhou dynasty|Zhou]] and [[Shang dynasty|Shang dynasties]], [[Shennong|Yandi]] and [[Yellow Emperor|Huangdi]]  in regards to their relationship between the [[Central Plains War|Central Plains]], paid a visit. [[Sima Qian]] writes in his [[Records of the Grand Historian]] "Huangdi, loving his (oldest son) [[Shaohao]], gave him a parcel of land, an area amounted to Changsha and surrounding land."

=== 1st-century History ===
Evidence exists that people lived and thrived in the area during the Bronze Age. Numerous examples of pottery and other objects have been discovered.

=== Jing-Chu Culture and Culture of Central Plains ===
[[Zhou dynasty|Eastern Zhou]]'s collapse swept in turmoil with the Spring and Autumn Period (770-476BC). The Yue culture spread and took a stronghold through the region, especially through Changsha. During the height of the [[Warring States period|Warring States Period]], the Chu Kingdom took a hardline nationalist and reform approach and took a large-scale military operations in [[South China]]. [[Chu (state)|Chu Kingdom]] took control of Changsha and turned the city into an important part of the southern part of Chu. After years of war and occupation, Changsha slowly replaced Yue culture with Chu culture. In 1951-1957, archaeologists explored numerous large and medium-sized Chu tombs from the warring states era. More than 3,000 tombs have been discovered.

The city is sometimes called Qingyang ({{zh|s=青阳|t=青陽|links=no|hp=Qīngyáng}}) in [[Warring States period]] texts.

=== Qin and Han dynasties ===
Changsha transformed into the Changsha Kingdom. It existed as a fiefdom under the tutelage of the Qin and later the Han dynasty. Under the [[Qin dynasty]] (221–206 BC), it became a staging post for Qin expeditions into [[Guangdong]] province. By 202 BC, it was already a fortified city. During the [[Han dynasty]], it was also the capital of Changsha Kingdom, an imperial fiefdom of the Han. From Han times (206 BC – AD 220), it held the name Linxiang County and was the seat of the Changsha commandery. The county was renamed back Changsha in 589

During the Han dynasty the Mawangdui tombs were constructed between 186 and 165 BC. The earliest tomb (no. 2), when excavated in the 1970s, was seen to have preserved the corpse of Lady [[Xin Zhui]] in a surprisingly good condition. Also found in the tomb were the earliest versions of the [[Tao Te Ching|Dao De Jing]], the main text of [[Taoism]], among many other historical documents.[[File:Changshadragon.jpg|[[Silk painting depicting a man riding a dragon]]|right|thumb|180px]]

=== Three Kingdoms to Sui and Tang dynasty ===
[[File:Sanguowujian.jpg|thumb|[[Zoumalou bamboo slips|Zoumalou Wu bamboo slips]]]]
With the collapse of the Han dynasty, China fell into turmoil amidst of the rise of the Three Kingdoms. The power base of Changsha fragmented into three factions.

====Western Jin====
Changsha soon fell under control of the Jin dynasty. [[Emperor Wu of Jin|Emperor Wudi]] appointed the ruler and governor to be the sixth son of a general Sima Yi. The local government had over 100 counties at the beginning of the dynasty. Over the course of the dynasty, the local government of Changsha lost control over a few counties, leaving them to local rule.

==== Sui dynasty ====
In 589, the [[Sui dynasty]] emerged as the sole power in China. This emergence ended the northern and Southern dynasties era and reunified China once again under one government.

With the emergence of the Sui dynasty, Changsha was renamed to the name of [[Tan Prefecture (Hunan)|Tanzhou]]. In addition, a new form of government was reintroduced. Changsha's 3-tier division system was changed to a 2-tier state and county system, eliminating the middle canton region. This new system is a significant improvement for efficiency. The existing counties in the Hunan region, including Changsha, were either outright replaced or greatly restructured. Some of the new counties created, such as Wangcheng, Liuyang, Liling still exist to this day. Neighboring town such as Xiangtan have experienced such restructure of counties that still exist to this day.

* '''Tang dynasty'''

[[File:Changsha- Dufu Pavilion.jpg|alt=|thumb|300x300px|[[Dufu]] Pavilion]]
The Tang dynasty brought new prosperity and peace to Changsha. the city became a place of trade between China and Southeast Asia. Changsha experienced violence during the Anshi Rebellion when rebels swept through the area.

=== Song dynasty ===
* [[Yuelu Academy]] was founded in AD 976 (during the period of the [[Song dynasty]]). It was destroyed by war in 1127 and was rebuilt in 1165 (during the [[Southern Song dynasty]]). The celebrated philosopher [[Zhu Xi]] taught at the Academy in 1165. It was again destroyed, this time by the [[Mongols]], but was restored in the late 15th century ([[Ming dynasty]]). Early 19th century graduates of the academy formed what one historian called a "network of messianic alumni", including [[Zeng Guofan]], architect of the [[Tongzhi Restoration]],&lt;ref name="Rowe"&gt;William T.

The modern day [[Hunan University]] is a descendant of the academy. The architecture of some of the buildings of the university was restored from 1981 to 1986, presumably according to their original Song design.)

=== Yuan and Ming dynasty ===
Changsha was fiercely defended by local Song troops during the [[Mongol conquest of the Song Dynasty]] and, after it fell into Mongol hands an event of mass suicide by the Changsha defenders took place in the city.

Under the [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] (1368–1644) and [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] (1644–1911/12) dynasties, Changsha was made a superior prefecture. Its name was also reverted to Changsha.

=== Qing Dynasty ===
From 1664 onward, it was the capital of Hunan, prospering as one of China's chief rice markets. During the [[Taiping Rebellion]], the city was besieged by the rebels (1854) but never fell; it then became the principal base for the suppression of the rebellion. It was opened to foreign trade in 1904. Further development followed the opening of the railway to [[Hankou District|Hankou]] in [[Hubei]] province in 1918, which was later extended to [[Guangzhou]] in [[Guangdong]] province in 1936. Although Changsha's population grew, the city remained primarily commercial in character and before 1937 had little industry apart from some small [[cotton]]-[[textile]], glass, and [[nonferrous]]-metal plants and [[handicraft]] enterprises.

[[File:Duzhengjie.jpg|thumb|300px|Historic district "Duzheng Street", the location of local government in Qing dynasty]]

In 1852 [[Taiping Heavenly Kingdom|Taiping]] forces laid a siege on Changsha through 3 months, but they subsequently gave up the offensive and moved onto [[Wuhan]].

The 1903 Treaty of [[Shanghai]] between the [[Qing dynasty]] and [[Japan]] opened the city to foreign trade. Consequently, factories, churches and schools were built. A college was started by [[Yale University]] bachelors, which later became a medical centre named Xiangya and a secondary school named the [[Yali School]].

===Modern era===
[[Mao Zedong]], the founder of the [[China|People's Republic of China]], began his political career in Changsha. He was a student at the Hunan Number 1 Teachers' Training School from 1913 to 1918. He later returned as a teacher and principal from 1920 to 1922. The school was destroyed during the [[Chinese Civil War]] but has since been restored. The former office of the Hunan [[Communist Party]] Central Committee where Mao Zedong once lived is now a museum that includes Mao's living quarters, photographs and other historical items from the 1920s.

Until May 1927, communist support remained strong in Changsha before the massacre carried out by the [[right-wing]] faction of the [[National Revolutionary Army|KMT]] troops. The faction owed its allegiance to [[Chiang Kai-shek]] during its offensive against the KMT's [[left-wing]] faction under [[Wang Jingwei]], who was then allied closely with the [[Communist Party of China|Communists]]. The purge of communists and suspected communists was part of Chiang's plans for consolidating his hold over the KMT, weakening Wang's control, and thereby over the entire China. In a period of twenty days, Chiang's forces killed more than ten thousand people in Changsha and its outskirts.
[[File:文夕大火6.jpg|right|thumb|250x250px|[[1938 Changsha Fire]]]]
During the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] (1937–45), the strategic location of Changsha made it the focus of four campaigns by the [[Japan]]ese to capture it from the hands of the [[National Revolutionary Army|Chinese Nationalists]]: these campaigns were the [[Battle of Changsha (1939)|1st Changsha]],&lt;ref&gt;Van De Ven, Hans J., ''War and Nationalism in China, 1925–1945'', pg. 237.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Battle of Changsha (1941)|2nd Changsha]], the [[Battle of Changsha (1942)|3rd Changsha]], and the [[Battle of Changsha (1944)|4th Changsha]]. The city was able to repulse the first three attacks, thanks to [[Xue Yue]]'s leadership, but ultimately fell into Japanese hands in 1944 for a year until the Japanese were defeated in a counterattack and forced to surrender.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6jRpVWJLxHUC&amp;pg=PA45|title=Chen Duxiu's last articles and letters, 1937-1942|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|year=1998|isbn=0824821122|edition=illustrated|location=|page=45|pages=|quote=24.

The city later became the territory of then-expanding [[China|Communist China]] when it was finally completed in 1949 after the [[Kuomintang]] were driven to [[Taiwan]].

Since the late 1990s, Changsha has rapidly developed, becoming one of the important cities in the central and western regions. At the end of 2007, Changsha, with Xiangtan, Zhuzhou was approved by the State Council for the [[Greater Changsha Metropolitan Region|Chang-Zhu-Tan]] " (Greater Changsha) resource-saving and environment-friendly society" comprehensive reform pilot area, an important engine of the rise of central China. In 2015, Xiangjiang New Area was approved as a national new district

Changsha's population nearly tripled between the start of its rebuilding in 1949 and the early 1980s. The city is now a major port, handling [[rice]], [[cotton]], [[timber]], and [[livestock]], and is also a collection and distribution point on the [[railway]] from [[Hankou District|Hankou]] to [[Guangzhou]]. It is a centre of rice [[Gristmill|milling]] and also has [[oil]]-extraction, [[tea]] and [[tobacco]] production, and [[meat-processing]] plants. Its textile industry produces [[cotton yarn]] and [[fabrics]] and engages in [[dyeing]] and [[printing]]. [[Agricultural chemical]]s and [[fertilizers]], farm implements, and [[pump]]ing [[machinery]] are also produced.

Changsha has a large thermal generating station linked by a [[power grid]] with the nearby industrial centres of [[Zhuzhou]] and [[Xiangtan]]; the three cities were designated in the 1970s as the nucleus of a major industrial complex. In the 1960s there was some development of [[heavy industry]]. The manufacture of machinery, especially machine tools and precision tools, became important, and Changsha became a center of China's [[aluminum]] industry. The city also has cement, rubber, ceramic, and papermaking plants and is a centre for many types of traditional handicrafts, producing [[Hunan|Xiang]] embroidery, leather goods, umbrellas, and buttons. [[Coal]] is mined in the vicinity.

Changsha is one of China's 20 most "economically advanced" cities. In 2008, Changsha's nominal GDP was ¥300.1 billion (US$43 billion), a year-on-year growth of 15.1% from the previous year. Its per capita GDP was ¥45,765 (US$6,589).&lt;ref&gt;Changsha Statistical Yearbook 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Its GDP grew at an average of 14% per year from 2001 to 2005, compared to the national average of 9% in the period. {{As of|2005}}, the [[service sector]] generated roughly around 49% of Changsha's GDP, up 112% from 2001 figures, leading to a disposable income for urban residents of 12,343 RMB annually. This growth is expected to continue driving the city's economic growth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.china-briefing.com/magazine/view/87 China Briefing] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090308190339/http://www.china-briefing.com/magazine/view/87 |date=8 March 2009 }}.

Changsha has attracted a substantial level of foreign investment. In 2005, for example, nearly US$1 billion worth of [[foreign direct investment]] (FDI) poured into the city, mainly in hi-tech, manufacturing, food production, and services. This figure is up 40% from 2001. 59% of the total FDI has come from [[Hong Kong]], [[South Korea]], [[Singapore]], and [[Japan]]; 28% has come from the [[Americas]] and 9% from [[Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Strategic &amp; Commercial Intelligence: Changsha investment Environment study 2006 Advisory|url=http://www.kpmg.com.cn/en/virtual_library/Financial_advisory_services/Changsha_investment06.pdf|website=www.kpmg.com.cn|publisher=KPMG|accessdate=21 June 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130612095534/http://www.kpmg.com.cn/en/virtual_library/Financial_advisory_services/Changsha_investment06.pdf|archivedate=12 June 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of 2008 more than 500 foreign companies had made over US$10 million worth of investments in Changsha.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thechinaperspective.com/topics/city/changsha/ Changsha Economic Data and News] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110602032748/http://www.thechinaperspective.com/topics/city/changsha/ |date=2 June 2011 }}.

== Culture ==

=== Media ===
[[Hunan Broadcasting System]] is China's largest television after China Central Television (CCTV). Its headquarters is in Changsha and produces some of the most popular programs in China, including [[Super Girl (TV series)|''Super Girl'']]. These programs have also brought a new entertainment industry into the city, which includes singing bars, dance clubs, theater shows, as well as related businesses including hair salons, fashion stores, and shops for hot spicy snacks at night (especially during summer). While Changsha has developed into an entertainment hub, the city has also become increasingly westernized and has attracted a growing number of foreigners.

=== Cuisine ===
There are various types of cuisine found in Changsha, yet [[Hunan cuisine]] remains to be the most popular genre. Hot and spicy food is typical of the region.

In addition, street food is also popular. Changsha Stinky Tofu is always identified as the icon of Changsha Street food and is renowned in the nation.

The city has its own [[Siu yeh]] culture.

In May 2008, the BBC broadcast, as part of its ''Storyville'' documentary series, the four-part ''The Biggest Chinese Restaurant in the World'', which explored the inner workings of the 5,000-seating-capacity [[West Lake Restaurant]] (''Xihu Lou Jiujia'') in Changsha.

=== Sports ===
Changsha has one of China's largest multi-purpose sports stadiums—[[Helong Stadium]], with 55,000 seats. The stadium was named after the Communist military leader [[He Long]]. It is the home ground of local football team [[Hunan Billows F.C.]], which plays in [[China League Two]]. The more modest 6,000-seat [[Hunan Provincial People's Stadium]], also located in Changsha, is used by the team for their smaller games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://int.soccerway.com/teams/china-pr/hunan-xiangtao-fc/|title=Hunan Xiangtao FC|publisher=soccerway.com|accessdate=25 December 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130213031342/http://int.soccerway.com/teams/china-pr/hunan-xiangtao-fc/|archivedate=13 February 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Australia]], competitive [[cheerleading]] is a rapidly growing sport. 
&lt;!-- other stuff to go here, e.g.  flesh out Introduction/Lead,  add History, school/uni/pro vs. allstar, note link between cheer and dance, note cheer and pom as separate disciplines --&gt;

== History ==
Prior to 2000, cheerleading was primarily known as the dance-and-pom style displayed by professional cheer squads for  [[National Rugby League|NRL]] rugby.  The US movie ''[[Bring It On (film)|Bring It On]]'' (released December 2000&lt;ref name="IMDb-BringItOn-release" /&gt; in Australia) popularised acrobatic-style cheerleading, and has been credited with sparking subsequent development as a competitive sport.&lt;ref name="Gladman-2008" /&gt;

During the 2000s and 2010s, the style of cheerleading seen as pre-game and half-time sideline entertainment at professional rugby matches continued to attract criticism for objectifying women, and some clubs discontinued their cheer teams. For example,  the [[Canterbury Bulldogs]] in 2013 announced they would cease their relationship with the studio contracted to provide their cheer team, the ''Belles''.&lt;ref name="Massoud-2013"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Massoud |first1=Josh |title=Howls of protest as 'traditional' Canterbury Bulldogs cheerleaders are given the flick |url=https://www.foxsports.com.au/howls-of-protest-as-traditional-canterbury-bulldogs-cheerleaders-are-given-the-flick/news-story/cc4a39f3cdab55bf1138f4c81bc5bd85 |accessdate=12 August 2018 |work=Fox Sports / Daily Telegraph |date=2013-12-09 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180812200643/https://www.foxsports.com.au/howls-of-protest-as-traditional-canterbury-bulldogs-cheerleaders-are-given-the-flick/news-story/cc4a39f3cdab55bf1138f4c81bc5bd85?nk=f5883da18e46988829dc89f97842eee0-1534104403 |archivedate=2018-08-13 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, when journalists sought comment from other football clubs, the chief executive of the [[Canberra Raiders]] stated that they were "reviewing the club's game-day entertainment". He denied the move was based around any female exploitation, rather citing cost as a factor.&lt;ref name="Ritchie-2013"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Ritchie |first1=Dean |title=Pom pom war as more NRL cheerleaders axed - this time at the Canberra Raiders |url=https://www.news.com.au/sport/nrl/pom-pom-war-as-more-nrl-cheerleaders-axed-this-time-at-the-canberra-raiders/news-story/e248b3c5e944578707a22b376645a5b5 |accessdate=12 August 2018 |work=News Corp Australia Network |date=2013-11-12 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170213052700/https://www.news.com.au/sport/nrl/pom-pom-war-as-more-nrl-cheerleaders-axed-this-time-at-the-canberra-raiders/news-story/e248b3c5e944578707a22b376645a5b5 |archivedate=2018-08-13 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Governing bodies ==
=== Gymnastics Australia ===
The Australian Cheerleading Union (ACU), founded in 2008 and managed by [[Gymnastics Australia]] (GA), was recognised as the official body by both the [[International Cheer Union]] (ICU) and by the [[Australian Sports Commission]] (ASC).&lt;ref name="GA-ACU" /&gt;

GA recognised Cheerleading (code CHL) as a "gymsport" alongside artistic, rhythmic, trampoline, acrobatic, and aerobic gymnastics. Cheer has similarities to acrobatic and floor gymnastics.  [[Acrobatic Gymnastics]] (code ACR),&lt;ref name="GA-ACR" /&gt; also involves partner or group lifts, balance, and throws.  [[Floor (gymnastics)|Floor]], which involves tumbling and balancing, is one of four disciplines that compose Women's Artistic Gymnastics (WAG) and one of six in Men's Artistic Gymnastics (MAG). All three (ACR, WAG, and MAG) are governed internationally by the [[Federation Internationale de Gymnastique]] (FIG), whereas cheerleading is governed by the ICU.

In December 2017, GA resolved to cease being the governing body for cheerleading in Australia, with an exit process to proceed through 2018.&lt;ref name="GA-exit" /&gt;  

=== International All Star Federation and AASCF ===
As in the United States, the [[US All Star Federation]] (USASF) and its international version, the IASF, function as ''de facto'' governing bodies.  Whereas the ICU world championships only allow one national team in each event from a given country, the USASF worlds accept all teams that have won bids from local championship competitions.  Hence USASF coaching credentials and competition rules are seen as highly desirable. 

The Australian All Star Cheerleading Federation (AASCF) is affiliated with USASF/IASF and has promoted the use of their rules in Australia.

=== Australian Cheer Sport Alliance ===
The Australian Cheer Sport Alliance (ACSA) was formed in 2017,&lt;ref&gt;Officially registered February 2018.  {{cite web |title=View details: Australian Cheer Sport Alliance Limited ACN 624 569 080 |url=https://connectonline.asic.gov.au/RegistrySearch/faces/landing/panelSearch.jspx?searchText=624569080&amp;searchType=OrgAndBusNm&amp;_adf.ctrl-state=hv37tsoew_15 |website=ASIC Connect |publisher=Australian Securities and Investment Commission |accessdate=14 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; with board members from Gymnastics Australia, {{Lang|fr|Fédération Internationale de Gymnastique}}, Australian All Star Cheer Federation, and Aussie Gold.&lt;ref name="ACSA-board" /&gt;  It is promoted as "Australia's Peak Body" for cheerleading.  

In early 2018, in response to GA's withdrawal, ACSA applied to the ICU to be the officially "recognised body for cheerleading in Australia".&lt;ref name="ACSA-announce-apply-ICU" /&gt;

ACSA runs a "Sanctioned Events" program to accredit event organisers that meet its safety and competition standards.&lt;ref name="ACSA-sanctioned-events" /&gt;

=== Coach accreditation ===
USASF coach credentialing is provided in Australia by The Australian All Star Cheer Federation (AASCF), and previously also by World Cup Cheer and Dance (WCCD).&lt;ref name="WCCD-credentialing" /&gt;  From 2018, Aussie Gold also provides coach accreditation.  

As at 2018, some competition events accept either Gymnastics Australia (Coach Education Framework for Cheerleading) or USASF accreditation for coaches.&lt;ref name="DCE-2018-HB" /&gt;

== Rules ==

Most competition events follow USASF/IASF rules for age divisions, difficulty levels, and terminology.{{efn-ua|For example, "The CUA Championship Series will follow the USASF Cheer Rules as the governing documents for safety and participation.  Please refer to the USASF website links below for complete listing of 2016-2017 Cheer Safety Rules."&lt;ref name="CUA-scoring1" /&gt; Similarly, "AUS Cheer will follow the 2011-2013 USASF/IASF Cheer Level Rules Chart and 2011-2012 USASF/IASF Dance Rules.".&lt;ref name="AUSCheer-Handbook-2012" /&gt;{{rp|page=2}}  AASCF, WCCD, CheerCon, Aussie Gold,&lt;ref name="AG-rules2016" /&gt; and SIA also refer to the USASF documents.}}

=== Competition divisions === 

As in the USA, cheer teams are grouped into classes based on a combination of age, level, and team size.  Certain categories are also separated into "all-girl" (females only) and "co-ed" (mixture of females and males) groups.  For large events, organizers can choose to additionally split on studio size, depending on the number of teams registered. The aim is to have a manageable number of teams in each group.  

For example, a team might compete in "Youth level 1 small-gym", or "Senior Co-ed level 5".  

Dance categories are grouped by age but not level. 

==== Age classes ====

All-star age groups are based on the competitors' ages at 31 December, that is, how many years old they turn at their birthday during the given calendar year.  (In contrast, USASF has used age at May&lt;ref name="USASF-age-2006" /&gt; or August&lt;ref name="USASF-age-2014" /&gt; for normal divisions and December 31 for International divisions.&lt;ref name="USASF-age-2014" /&gt;)  

Overlap in the age divisions means that athletes can compete as members of multiple teams.  For example, a 10-year-old can perform in youth, junior &amp;/or senior teams.  

&lt;!-- intention here is to add extra columns for other years or different event rules --&gt;

==== Levels ====
Difficulty or safety levels are most often based on USASF rules, starting from "Novice" (similar to USASF "Prep") followed by levels 1 to 6. Level "4.2" combines level-4 stunts with level-2 tumbling. &lt;!-- University competitions may use ICU terminology. [need ref] --&gt;

There is also a division for teams having competitors with Special Needs.  These are more usually seen in the Group Stunt category, which has a smaller team size than Team Cheer.  
&lt;!--
ICU levels are similar to USASF, but are named Prep, Basic, Prep Advanced, Advanced, Elite, and Premier, for levels 1 to 6 respectively.&lt;ref name="ICU-2015-2016-Safety-Rules"&gt;{{cite web |title=2015-2016 Safety Rules |url=http://cheerunion.org.ismmedia.com/ISM3/std-content/repos/Top/docs/ICU_2015_Rules_TeamCheer.pdf |website=International Cheer Union |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160624114559/http://cheerunion.org.ismmedia.com/ISM3/std-content/repos/Top/docs/ICU_2015_Rules_TeamCheer.pdf |archivedate=2016-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; As at 2018, these are named Beginner, Novice, Intermediate, Median, Advanced, Elite, and Premier for levels 0 to 6.&lt;ref name="ICU-Rules-2017-2019" /&gt;  [not Australia-specific] 
--&gt;

For each level, there are detailed lists of allowed and disallowed moves in tumbling, stunts, pyramids, and tosses.&lt;ref name="AASCF-USASF-2017-Safety-Rules"&gt;{{cite web |title=2016-2017 USASF Cheer Safety Rules |url=http://aascf.com.au/files/2016-17_USASF_Cheer_Rules_and_Safety_Updated_07_June_2016.pdf |website=AASCF |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170301083021/http://aascf.com.au/files/2016-17_USASF_Cheer_Rules_and_Safety_Updated_07_June_2016.pdf |archivedate=2017-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ICU-Rules-2017-2019"&gt;{{cite web |title=ICU Divisions Rules &amp; Regulations 2017-2019 |url=http://cheerunion.org.ismmedia.com/ISM3/std-content/repos/Top/docs/ICU_TeamCheer_Rules_2018.pdf |website=International Cheer Union |accessdate=26 August 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180128052538/http://cheerunion.org.ismmedia.com/ISM3/std-content/repos/Top/docs/ICU_TeamCheer_Rules_2018.pdf# |archivedate=2018-01-28 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This enables teams to compete with others at the same level of ability, and disallowing more difficult moves prevents competitors from dangerously attempting moves beyond their ability.
&lt;!-- 
Australian all-star competitions generally have a Novice level with the same restrictions as Level 1.  This is similar, but not identical, to the USASF Prep level (which in turn is different from ICU Prep).  In 2016 WCCD replaced Novice with Prep to align with then-current USASF usage. 
--&gt;

== Scoring ==

Scoring systems vary depending on the event organiser. 

At AASCF competitions, the components of cheer routines – standing and running tumbling, jumps, stunts, pyramids, and tosses – are scored separately out of 5.0 for difficulty and for technique.  Stunts and pyramids are also scored for creativity, so they are worth 15.0 instead of 10.0 points.  Building skills (stunts, pyramids, tosses) account for 45 points out of 100 (35 of 90 at Level 1 where there are no tosses); tumble skills (tumbling and jumps) for 30 points; and an additional 25 points are scored on dance break, overall routine composition and performance.&lt;ref name="AASCF-scoresheet-2016" /&gt;  Points are deducted for falls and rule violations.&lt;ref name="AASCF-deductions-2016" /&gt;

In 2015, four event organisers formulated a common scoring system which they named the "Australian Independent Scoring System" (AISS),{{efn-ua|''Introducing the "Australian Indepenent Scoring System"'' appears on the web sites of Aussie Gold&lt;ref name="AG2015Scoring" /&gt; CUA,&lt;ref name="CUA-AISS" /&gt; and SIA&lt;ref name="SIA-AISS" /&gt;.&lt;!-- Reads like press-release style, query did any journalistic media run a story? --&gt;}} also known as the AIEP scoring system.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cheerunlimitedaustralia.com.au/scoring-1/&lt;/ref&gt;

Under this system, scores are apportioned as follows:&lt;ref name="AG2015Scoring" /&gt; 
* 50% Building Skills (Stunt/Pyramids/Tosses)
* 30% Tumbling Skills (Standing/Running/Jumps)
* 20% Dance &amp; Choreography

== Competition organisers ==

The major cheer competitions in Australia are run by cheer federations and by independent event organisers. &lt;!-- TO-DO: confirm there is a distinction, gather supporting references for this assertion --&gt;  Events run from March through to October, in line with the Southern-hemisphere school year.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7674">'''Conjunctive archaeology''' is a method of studying of the past developed by [[Walter Taylor (archaeologist)|Walter Taylor]] in the 1940s that combined elements of both traditional [[archaeology]] and the allied field of [[anthropology]]. It is exemplified by Taylor's ''A Study of Archeology'' (1948).

Taylor saw archaeology as an integrated discipline, combining the study of [[diet (nutrition)|diet]], settlement patterns, tools and other elements to provide a [[holism|holistic]] view of the past. Elements of Taylor's approach are now a standard practice in the discipline, but Taylor's open and specific criticism of leading archaeologists of his day caused dismay amongst many archaeologists.

Taylor was one of the first to criticize the [[culture history|descriptive, historical approaches]] to archaeology that dominated the discipline. According to [[Patty Jo Watson]], Taylor's purpose "was not to generate ill will but rather to stimulate examination ... of aims, goals and purposes by American archaeologists".&lt;ref&gt;Patty Jo Watson, Foreword to the 1983 edition of ''A Study of Archeology''. Center for Archaeological Investigations, Southern Illinois University, Carbondale.{{page needed|date=April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''A Study of Archaeology''==
[[Walter Taylor (archaeologist)|Walter Taylor]] was the founder of conjunctive archaeology. He was born in [[Chicago]] and studied at [[Yale University|Yale]]. He saw archaeology as a discipline that was multifaceted, and tried to focus on Anthropology and Archaeology to form a well-balanced and all-consuming study. He was frustrated by the focus of his contemporaries on typologies, chronological reconstructions, and other elements of archaeology that he saw as formalist and restricting. He put forward his polemical ideas in ''A Study of Archaeology'', which served as a critique of culture-historical archaeology and put forward his prescription of a conjunctive archaeology. Taylor was reacting to what he saw as his contemporaries' limited use of artifacts to produce culture chronologies and identify groups as opposed to their stated goals of reconstructing prehistory. In response, he offered that archaeologists should focus more on quantitative data and spatial distributions of artifacts and features within sites. Part of this new focus on sites as units of analysis would require the collection of what might have appeared as trivial data, as well as paying better attention to things like paleoenvironmental data. All this was done with the aim of developing comparative approaches at the site level and beyond.

Taylor's ''A Study of Archaeology'' provided a number of early impacts. First, it was a history of Americanist archaeology. Alongside [[V. Gordon Childe]] and especially [[Grahame Clark]], he envisaged an archaeology that saw the necessary goal of archaeology as the reconstruction of prehistoric lifeways with a focus on cultures as "functioning entities embracing social, political, and ideological as well as economic components that the archaeologist must try to study holistically from the inside".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/64770830|title=A History of Archaeological Thought|last=Trigger|first=Bruce G.|date=2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521600491|edition=2nd|location=Cambridge [England]|pages=367–371|oclc=64770830}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps conjunctive archaeology's most unique legacy was being among the first rigorous attempts at examining archaeology through the lens of [[Boasian anthropology]]. Utilizing this lens, Taylor departed from Childe's and Clark's more materialist aims (the former working in something of a [[Marxist archaeology|Marxist]] tradition and the latter in an early form of a paleoenvironmental approach). Anticipating psychological anthropology, Taylor held an idealist vision of human culture and sought to learn about the beliefs and ideologies of past peoples through material culture.

== Influence ==
The influence of conjunctive archaeology on the field is somewhat controversial. Taylor claimed until he died that his ideas were a major theoretical contribution that anticipated and directly contributed to [[Processual archaeology|The New Archaeology]]. Perhaps the most public and central debate on the topic of conjunctive archaeology's influence on later archaeologists was the extended debate in publications between Taylor and the major processual theorist [[Lewis Binford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Contemporary Archaeology|last=Leone|first=M. P.|publisher=Southern Illinois University Press|year=1972|isbn=|location=Carbondale|pages=28–33}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=An Archaeological Perspective|last=Binford|first=Lewis|publisher=Seminar Press|year=1972|isbn=|location=New York|pages=8–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Working at Archaeology|last=Binford|first=Lewis|publisher=Academic Press|year=1983|isbn=|location=New York|pages=229–233}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taylor claimed that his ideas included testing of hypotheses and a systems approach decades before processual archaeology.

Taylor's claims are very difficult to assess. While he clearly shared some goals with the later processualists, he also very evidently diverged from them in crucial theoretical ways. The core difference was his reliance on Boas. The idealist conception of culture that Taylor put forward via Boas is at odds with the more materialist aims of the processualists. Perhaps the core separation between processualists and Walter Taylor is the latter's ambivalence if not rejection of the idea of [[Material culture]]. Taylor instead believed that all culture was ideational and that artifacts merely reflected it.

Some scholars have contributed to an edited volume reflecting on Taylor's impact in an ambivalent way.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/664572617|title=Prophet, pariah, and pioneer : Walter W. Taylor and dissension in American archaeology|date=2010|publisher=University Press of Colorado|others=Maca, Allan L., Reyman, Jonathan E., Folan, William J.|isbn=9780870819520|location=Boulder, Colo.|oclc=664572617}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this book, the argument is partially laid out that Taylor's work might have had influence on [[Post-processual archaeology]] rather than processual, given his focus on ideational elements of culture as well as his deep conviction of the importance of a historical and [[historiographic]] approach (as compared to the processualists' aims for objectivity).

Perhaps the most difficult part of interpreting Taylor's influence on the discipline as a whole is that neither he nor anyone else ever produced a substantive work within the framework of conjunctive archaeology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hodder|first=Ian|date=October 2012|title=Desperately Seeking Walter Taylor|url=https://static1.squarespace.com/static/53568703e4b0feb619b78a93/t/53690624e4b09cccf76f2346/1399391780034/desperately-seeking-walter-taylor.pdf|journal=Current Anthropology|volume=53|pages=1–2|via=|doi=10.1086/667703}}&lt;/ref&gt; While his theoretical goals were clear, Taylor's methodology was left somewhat vague. Because of the multifaceted nature of Taylor's work and the fact that his work unites many strains of archaeology that are today seen as being at odds, Taylor's legacy in the field will likely always be at least somewhat controversial.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18923">Dr. '''[[Ignaz Semmelweis]]''' discovered in 1847 that hand-washing with a solution of [[Calcium hypochlorite|chlorinated lime]] reduced the incidence of fatal [[childbed fever]] tenfold in maternity institutions.  However, the reaction of his contemporaries was not positive; his subsequent mental disintegration led to him being confined to an [[insane asylum]], where he died in 1865.

Semmelweis's critics claimed his findings lacked [[scientific reasoning]].  The failure of the nineteenth-century scientific community to recognize Semmelweis's findings, and the nature of the flawed critiques outlined below, helped advance a positivist [[epistemology]], leading to the emergence of [[evidence-based medicine]].

==Epistemological relevance==
[[File:Monthly mortality rates 1841-1849.png|thumb|right|250px|Semmelweis's experimental evidence&amp;mdash;onset of chlorine handwashing mid-May 1847 reduced childbed fever mortality [[Historical mortality rates of puerperal fever#Monthly mortality rates for birthgiving women 1841–1849|(see rates).]] ]]
To a modern reader, Semmelweis's experimental findings&amp;mdash;that chlorine washings reduced childbed fever&amp;mdash;seem obvious, and it may seem absurd that his claims were rejected on the grounds of purported lack of "scientific reasoning".  His unpalatable observational evidence was only accepted when seemingly unrelated work by [[Louis Pasteur]] in Paris some two decades later offered a [[theory (science)|theoretical explanation]] for Semmelweis's observations: the [[germ theory of disease]].

As such, the Semmelweis story is often used in university courses with [[epistemology]] content, e.g. philosophy of science courses - demonstrating the virtues of [[empiricism]] or [[positivism]] and providing a historical account of which types of knowledge count as scientific (and thus accepted) knowledge, and which do not.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

It is an irony that Semmelweis's critics considered themselves positivists.  They could not accept his ideas of "minuscule and largely invisible amounts of decaying organic matter" as a cause of every case of childbed fever.  To them, "Semmelweis seemed to be reverting to the speculative theories of earlier decades that were so repugnant to his positivist contemporaries".&lt;ref&gt;Semmelweis 1861:45&lt;/ref&gt;

The positivistic contempt for theoretical deliberations is evident in these two quotations.  The first from the highly celebrated anatomist [[Rudolf Virchow]] who said, "Explorers of nature recognize no bugbears other than individuals who speculate"&lt;ref&gt;

==Absorption of cadaveric material==
[[File:Streptococcus pyogenes.jpg|right|thumb|'''[[Streptococcus pyogenes]]''' (red-stained spheres) is responsible for most cases of severe [[puerperal fever]]. It is commonly found in the throat and [[nasopharynx]] of otherwise healthy carriers.]]
Semmelweis's key claim was that physicians contaminated their hands with "cadaveric particles" in the morgue while conducting autopsies.  He pointed out that ordinary washings with soap did not remove these particles, because the hands could retain a stench for several days in spite of such washings.  When physicians later carried out gynaecological examinations, the cadaveric particles were absorbed by the patient, in particular if they came into contact with the freshly exposed uterus, or with genital tract lesions caused by the birth process.  Semmelweis was convinced that '''every case''' of childbed fever was caused by resorption of cadaveric particles.  With this [[etiology (medicine)|etiology]], Semmelweis identified childbed fever as purely an [[iatrogenic]] disease&amp;mdash;that is, one ''caused'' by doctors. ([[Friedrich Wilhelm Scanzoni von Lichtenfels]] took personal offense at this, and never forgave Semmelweis for it&lt;ref name="ww.ishm2006.hu"&gt;{{cite conference|first=Erik E |last=Hauzman |title=''Semmelweis and his German contemporaries |booktitle=40th International Congress on the History of Medicine,  ISHM 2006 |year=2006 |location=Budapest, Hungary August 26–30, 2006 |url=http://www.ishm2006.hu/abstracts/files/ishmpaper_093.doc |accessdate=2008-06-05 |deadurl=yes |format=DOC |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080530013805/http://www.ishm2006.hu/abstracts/files/ishmpaper_093.doc |archivedate=May 30, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;—Scanzoni remained one of the most ardent critics of Semmelweis.)

A few childbed fever case stories, described below, did not fit well into Semmelweis's theory and led him to expand it, also to comprise other types of decaying organic matter, for instance secretions from an infected knee or from a cancer tumor.

In a case of discharging cancer of the innermost part of the uterus, Semmelweis wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;In October 1847, a patient was admitted with discharging medullary carcinoma [cancer of the innermost part] of the uterus. She was assigned the bed at which the rounds were always initiated. After examining this patient, those conducting the examination washed their hands with soap only. The consequence was that of twelve patients then delivering, eleven died. The ichor from the discharging medullary carcinoma was not destroyed by soap and water. … Thus, childbed fever is caused not only by cadaverous particles adhering to hands but also by ichor from living organisms.&lt;ref name="Semmelweis 1861:93"&gt;Semmelweis (1861):93&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

And in a case of a discharging carious knee, he wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;A new tragic experience persuaded me that air could also carry decaying organic matter. In November of the same year, an individual was admitted with a discharging carious left knee. […] the [[ichor]]ous exhalations of the carious knee completely saturated the air of her ward. In this way the other patients were exposed and nearly all the patients in that room died. […] The ichorous particles that saturated the air of the maternity ward penetrated the uteruses already lacerated in the birth process. The particles were resorbed, and childbed fever resulted.&lt;ref name="Semmelweis 1861:93"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Even with the most meticulous chlorine-washings there seemed to be an unavoidable mortality rate of about 1 percent.  He therefore suggested that self-infection took place - that internally generated cadaveric particles were responsible, for instance tissue crushed in the birth process and eventually turning gangrenous.

Most of the objections from Semmelweis's critics stemmed from his claim, that '''every case''' of childbed fever was caused by resorption of cadaveric particles.  Some of Semmelweis's first critics even responded that he had said nothing new - it had long been known that cadaveric contamination could cause childbed fever.  But this was only one of many possible causes for childbed fever.  The findings from autopsies of deceased women also showed a confusing multitude of various symptoms, which emphasised the belief that puerperal fever was not ''one'' disease, but rather many different diseases, which remained unidentified. Semmelweis's critics were also quick to point out that he had virtually no evidence for his self-infection theory.

==Rejected as unscientific==
{{Main|Semmelweis reflex}}
[[File:Carl Edouard Marius Levy.jpg|right|thumb|[[Carl Edvard Marius Levy|Professor Levy]] dismissed Semmelweis' findings as improbable and unscientific]]
The quotes below are so selected to demonstrate the speculative theoretical nature of the objections to Semmelweis's theory.  The quotes are from a publication&lt;ref name="levy1848"&gt;{{cite journal| last = Levy| first = Karl Edouard Marius | title = De nyeste Forsög i Födselsstiftelsen i Wien til Oplysning om Barselfeberens Aetiologie| journal = [[Hospitals-Meddelelser]]| volume = 1| pages = 199–211| year = 1848 }} (Alternative spelling [[Carl Edvard Marius Levy]].)  A scan of the 1848 document is available (in Danish) in [[:Image:Levy 1848 De nyeste forsog i Fodselsstiftelsen i Wien etc.pdf|Wikimedia commons]].  A plain text version is available in the Danish [[:s:da:De nyeste Forsög i Födselsstiftelsen i Wien til Oplysning om Barselfeberens Ætiologie|Wikisource]].&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Carl Edvard Marius Levy]], a Danish obstetrician, who attacked Semmelweis's findings on such grounds.  The first quote shows the improbable, shabbily researched and poorly argued nature of Semmelweis's claim, that there is only one universal cause for the disease.

&lt;blockquote&gt;...Above all it is to be regretted that neither the observations nor the opinions grounded on them are presented with the clarity and precision that would be desirable in such an important matter of [[etiology]]. To presume that corpses can and do infect, without considering whether the infection is derived from [[wikt:puerpera|puerpera]]e or from other corpses, is as much a consequence of unrecognized [[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]] assumptions as of the cited facts. A strict examination would absolutely require that different sources of infection be taken into account and provide the basis for a classification of the observations.  From a scientific point of view, particularly regarding the question of the contagiousness of [[puerperal fever]], it is important to know whether the presumed [[cadaver]]ic infection is to be ascribed only to puerperal cadaverous matter or rather to all cadaverous effluvium in general. ..[...]... It would be enlightening, insofar as the discussion concerns only puerperal corpses, to consider whether the [[Infectious disease|contagium]] is present in the superficial parts, since we are concerned with the products of a disease assumed to be transferable to nearby predisposed persons. On the other hand, if the infective matter can originate from all corpses, one must give up every notion of a specific contagium and look instead for an infection of the blood mass.&lt;ref name="Semmelweis 1861:182"&gt;Semmelweis (1861):182&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;... if Dr. Semmelweis had limited his opinion regarding infections from corpses to puerperal corpses, I would have been less disposed to denial than I am. ...[...]... the specific contagium seems to be of little importance to Dr. Semmelweis. Indeed it is so little considered that he does not even discuss the direct transmission of the disease from those who are ill to healthy persons lying nearby. He is concerned only with general infection from corpses without respect to the disease that led to death. In this respect his opinion seems improbable.&lt;ref name="Semmelweis 1861:182"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Hand desinfection test with blood agar plate.jpg|thumb|right|Microbial growth on a cultivation plate without procedures (A), after [[Hand washing|washing hands]] with soap (B) and after disinfection with alcohol (C)]]
Doctors and students did wash hands with soap and water and the hands were visibly clean before examinations.  How could contaminants in such infinitesimal amounts possibly cause such damage?
&lt;blockquote&gt; ...a rapidly fatal putrid infection, even if the putrid matter is introduced directly into the blood, requires more than homeopathic doses of the poison. And, with due respect for the cleanliness of the Viennese students, it seems improbable that enough infective matter or vapor could be secluded around the fingernails to kill a patient.&lt;ref&gt;Semmelweis (1861):182–183&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Why were simpler and more reliable experiments not considered?
&lt;blockquote&gt;To prove his opinion, Dr. Semmelweis ordered chlorine washings to destroy every trace of cadaverous residue on the fingers. Would not the experiment have been simpler and more reliable if it had been arranged, at least during the experiment, that all anatomical work would be avoided?&lt;ref&gt;Semmelweis (1861):183&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Levy suggests that the decrease in deaths could be due to random variation:
&lt;blockquote&gt;In spite of these reservations, one must admit that the results of the experiment appear to support Dr. Semmelweis's opinion, but certainly one must admit no more. Everyone who has had the opportunity to observe the periodic variations in the mortality rate of maternity clinics will agree that his findings lack certain important confirmation.  ...[...]... In the absence of more precise statistical information, it is conceivable that the results of the last seven months depend partially on periodic accidental factors …&lt;ref&gt;Semmelweis (1861):184&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Semmelweis's critics were also quick to point out that he had virtually no evidence for his self-infection theory.  In particular, it seemed unlikely that the two women could have infected other patients without becoming infected themselves:
&lt;blockquote&gt;... the first case [the woman with a carious knee] is clearly inconsistent with the possibility of infection [since presumably she must have infected herself], while the second case [the woman with the cancer in her uterus] remains strikingly unclear. Could [[ichor]] from this patient have been more damaging when conveyed in vaginal examinations to other patients than it would have been as a result of similar examinations carried out on this patient herself? In our hospital we have frequently recorded ichorous sores on the feet of delivering patients without having noticed any subsequent infections, either of those patients themselves or of other patients. Dr. Semmelweis places great emphasis on the better health of institutions exclusively for the education of midwives; he should consider that ichorous secretions occur equally in both institutions. Moreover, in an institution as large as the midwife clinic in Vienna, one or another of the patients must always be ill and so provide a source of infection. If the infection occurs as easily as he believes, this would reduce the inequality in mortality rates between the clinics.&lt;ref&gt;Semmelweis (1861):185&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In conclusion Professor Levy writes: 
&lt;blockquote&gt; These are my impressions of Dr. Semmelweis's experiences; for these reasons I must judge provisionally that his opinions are not clear enough and his findings not exact enough to qualify as scientifically founded.&lt;ref&gt;Semmelweis (1861):186&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

These were not the only objections to Semmelweis' theory. Critics also blamed his theory of infectious particulates on his Catholic faith. They said his idea that invisible particles could cause disease and death was simply a product of his Catholic superstition. Many of his critics argued that the presence of Catholic priests bearing the Eucharist to dying patients was deeply frightening, and this fright induced child-bed fever. Semmelweis tested this theory by keeping priests out of one ward while admitting them to a second: no difference in illness or mortality was observed. Despite this, the critics continued to hold that Semmelweis' religion was the actual cause of the deadly disease.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact of Professor Levy's criticism==
The Levy paper was first published in 1848, in a Danish journal.&lt;ref name="levy1848"/&gt;   A translation was published in Germany by [[Gustav Adolf Michaelis]] in 1850.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal   | last =Levy   | first =    | authorlink =    | title = Gebärhäuser und der praktischen Unterricht in der Geburtshülfe   | journal = Neue Zeitschrift fur Geburrskunde   | volume = 27   | issue =    | pages = 392–449     | year = 1850 }} Semmelweis (1861):137, translator Carter's footnote 18 p 137&lt;/ref&gt;  The actual impact on the medical community of the criticism is unclear.  Semmelweis only learned of the essay in 1858&lt;ref name="ww.ishm2006.hu"/&gt; but evidently finds it significant enough to address it thoroughly in his 1861 publication.  The purpose of quoting the Levy paper is that it demonstrates the nature of the criticism, in particular the intricate theoretical reasoning that completely overshadowed Semmelweis' experimental results.

==Semmelweis's misconception of childbed fever==
Today it is well known that Semmelweis was wrong about the theory of cadaveric contamination. What Semmelweis did not know is that chlorinated lime not only destroys the stench on contaminated hands, but also the bacteria there&amp;mdash;the [[germ theory of disease]] had yet to be discovered. Many of the epidemics of childbed fever were probably caused by [[streptococcus]] infections&amp;mdash;either ''type A'', which is commonly found in the throat and [[nasopharynx]] of otherwise healthy carriers, or ''type B'', which lives on the skin.  Type B is also found in the genitals of about 5–30% of pregnant women.&lt;ref&gt;Carter (2005):104–108&lt;/ref&gt;  It is therefore necessary for the physician to disinfect their hands before every examination and not, as Semmelweis thought, only after visits to the morgue.

{{Maya civilization}}
'''Cuello''' is a [[Maya civilization|Maya]] archaeological site in northern [[Belize]]. The site is that of a farming village with a long occupational history. It was originally dated to 2000 BC, but these dates have now been corrected and updated to around 1200 BC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archaeology.about.com/od/cterms/a/Cuello.htm Cuello] archaeology.about.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, p.203. Drew 1999, p.127.&lt;/ref&gt; Its inhabitants lived in pole-and-thatch houses that were built on top of low plaster-coated platforms. The site contains residential groups clustered around central patios. It also features the remains of a steam bath dating to approximately 900 BC, making it the oldest steam bath found to date in the Maya lowlands. Human burials have been associated with the residential structures; the oldest have no surviving burial relics, but from 900 BC onwards, they were accompanied by offerings of [[Maya ceramics|ceramic vessels]].&lt;ref&gt;Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, p.203.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to some sources, ceramics from the earliest phase of the settlement at Cuello already belonged to an established lowland Maya pottery tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Hammond 2000, p.206&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars disagree, and consider that the earliest Cuello pottery was of the Swasey type, starting at 1200 BC, with a lack of clear parallels.

Although Cuello appears to have been a typical, relatively unimportant rural village in the Preclassic era, it participated in regional [[Trade in Maya civilization|trade networks]] with [[obsidian use in Mesoamerica|obsidian]] being imported from the Maya [[Guatemalan highlands|highlands]] from 800 BC onwards, and a small amount of [[jade use in Mesoamerica|jade]] arriving in the community a few centuries later.&lt;ref&gt;Drew 1999, p.128.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==
Cuello is located two miles Yo Creek Road in the Orange Walk District. It sits on the private land of the Cuello Family but permissions are granted to visit the site.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

==Archaeology==
Uncorrected [[radiocarbon dating|radiocarbon]] dates from the lowest stratigraphic levels of the site returned dates as far back as 2600 BC, although these were viewed as controversial.&lt;ref&gt;Estrada-Belli 2011, p.38.&lt;/ref&gt;

The site was investigated in the 1970s and 1980s by archaeologist [[Norman Hammond]].&lt;ref&gt;Drew 1999, p.127.&lt;/ref&gt; Structure 326 was excavated in 1980 and measures {{convert|8|by|4|m|ft}}. The walls of the building were made of thin poles tied together with vines. This was then coated in a smoothed layer of clay and finished with a white lime wash.&lt;ref&gt;Hammond 2000, pp.206-207.&lt;/ref&gt;

Archaeological investigation has revealed that the [[Maya cuisine|diet]] of the Preclassic occupants of Cuello consisted of less than 30% [[maize]], compared with up to 75% for the [[Maya peoples|modern Maya]]. [[White-tailed deer]] made up over half the meat in their diet, followed by freshwater turtles and domestic dogs, the last of which represents 7% of the animal remains found at the site.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, p.163.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Burials===
Two [[Mesoamerican chronology|Late Preclassic]] mass burial areas have been uncovered at Cuello, one of which contained 26 or more males who had been [[Sacrifice in Maya culture|sacrificed]]. Healed fractures on the bones suggest that they may have been captured warriors. Further evidence of local [[Maya warfare|warfare]] comes from evidence of burnt buildings at the site.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, pp.258-259.&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of elite burials have been excavated at Cuello. The earliest phases of the Middle Classic included both adults and children accompanied by offerings of [[Jade use in Mesoamerica|jade]] and shell ornaments, indicating social differentiation.&lt;ref name="Estrada2011p62"&gt;Estrada-Belli 2011, p.62.&lt;/ref&gt; High-status burials tended to be associated with specific locations throughout the history of the site.&lt;ref name="Estrada2011p62"/&gt;

'''Burial 160''' is an elite burial that has been dated to 500&amp;ndash;400 BC.&lt;ref name="Estrada2011p62"/&gt; It consists of an individual interred in a [[cist]], accompanied by two ceramic vessels and ornaments that included tubes fashioned from deer bones and engraved with a mat design that in later times became associated with royalty.&lt;ref name="Estrada2011p62"/&gt; There was also the upper portion of a human skull that had been fashioned into a plaque.&lt;ref name="Estrada2011p62"/&gt; Due to these distinguishing features of the burial, the excavators concluded that it was that of a Middle Classic ruler of the settlement.&lt;ref name="Estrada2011p62"/&gt; The site of this burial remained important in later times, with the residential patio being converted into a ceremonial platform upon which was built a small [[Mesoamerican pyramids|pyramid]] temple.&lt;ref name="Estrada2011p62"/&gt;

==Ceramic chronology==
The earliest pottery found in Belize is in the western part of the country, in places like [[Cahal Pech]] and [[Blackman Eddy]]. At the northern sites, the pottery is now believed to have come somewhat later.&lt;ref&gt;Jon C. Lohse, Jaime Awe, Cameron Griffith, Robert M. Rosenswig, and Fred Valdez, Jr., [https://www.academia.edu/3657409/ ''Preceramic Occupations in Belize: Updating The Paleoindian and Archaic Record.''] Latin American Antiquity, 17(2), 2006, pp. 209-226&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest Cuello pottery found is of the Swasey type, starting at about 1200 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Susan Toby Evans, David L. Webster, eds, [https://books.google.com.mx/books?id=vZ3DAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA444 ''Archaeology of Ancient Mexico and Central America: An Encyclopedia.''] Routledge, 2013 {{ISBN|1136801855}} p444&lt;/ref&gt; While the known ''Xe ceramics'' of the [[Pasion River]] drainage date from the similar time period, there are significant differences between these and the Swasey/Bladen ceramics.&lt;ref&gt;Laura Kosakowsky, [https://www.academia.edu/1808018/ ''The Ceramics of Cuello, Belize''.] Cambridge Univ Press, 1998 - www.academia.edu&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Folkton Drums''' are a unique set of decorated chalk objects in the shape of [[Drum (container)|drums]] or solid cylinders dating from the [[Neolithic Europe|Neolithic]] period. Found in a child's grave near the village of [[Folkton]] in northern England, they are now on loan to Stonehenge Visitor Centre from the [[British Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pe_prb/t/the_folkton_drums.aspx British Museum Highlights]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery==
In 1889, a round prehistoric [[tumulus|barrow]] was opened by the scholar and amateur archaeologist [[William Greenwell]] near [[Folkton]] in [[North Yorkshire]].&lt;ref name=north&gt;{{cite book|last1=North|first1=John|title=Stonehenge : a new interpretation of prehistoric man and the cosmos|date=1996|publisher=The Free Press|location=New York, NY|isbn=1416576460|url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=1416576460|accessdate=31 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inside, he found a neolithic grave dating to the time of [[Stonehenge]], estimated to be between 2600 and 2000 BC. The remains of several bodies were unearthed, one of whom was a child beside which the three drums were found. The rarity of this find (no other similar artifact is known from Europe) suggests that the child came from an elite group in society. Four years after the discovery, the drums were donated by Greenwell, along with other parts of his collection, to the British Museum.

==Description==
The three drum-like forms are made of chalk (that was quarried locally) and are decorated with stylized human faces and [[geometric]] patterns. On the top of the cylinders are a series of concentric circles and two of them have pairs of eyes that [[schematic]]ally denote a human face. The design of the drums is similar to objects made in the [[Beaker culture]] and early [[bronze age]]. The purpose of the drums is unknown, although the faces may represent important members of the local clan or they may be a type of children's [[toy]] that has uniquely survived, when most would have been made of wood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/search.aspx?searchText=The+Folkton+Drums|title=The Folkton Drums|last=|first=|date=|website=British Museum|language=en-GB|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Hugo Awards''' are a set of [[literary award]]s given annually for the best [[science fiction]] or [[fantasy]] works and achievements of the previous year. The awards are named after [[Hugo Gernsback]], the founder of the pioneering science fiction magazine ''[[Amazing Stories]]'', and were officially named the Science Fiction Achievement Awards until 1992. Organized and overseen by the [[Worldcon#World Science Fiction Society|World Science Fiction Society]], the awards are given each year at the annual [[Worldcon|World Science Fiction Convention]] as the central focus of the event. They were first given in 1953, at the [[11th World Science Fiction Convention]], and have been awarded every year since 1955. Over the years that the award has been given, the categories presented have changed; currently Hugo Awards are given in more than a dozen categories, and include both written and dramatic works of various types.

The Hugo Awards have been termed as "among the highest honors bestowed in science fiction and fantasy writing".&lt;ref name="LAT"/&gt; Works that have won have been published in special collections, and the official logo of the Hugo Awards is often placed on the winning books' cover as a promotional tool. The 2018 Hugos were presented at the [[76th World Science Fiction Convention|76th Worldcon]], "Worldcon 76", in [[San Jose, California]], on August 19, 2018. The 2019 awards will be presented at the [[77th World Science Fiction Convention|77th Worldcon]], "Dublin 2019: An Irish Worldcon", in [[Dublin]] on August 19, 2019.

For lists of winners and nominees for each category, see the [[#Categories|list of award categories]] below.

The World Science Fiction Society (WSFS) gives out the Hugo Awards each year for the best [[science fiction]] or [[fantasy]] works and achievements of the previous year. The award is named after [[Hugo Gernsback]], who founded the pioneering science fiction magazine ''[[Amazing Stories]]'' and who is considered one of the "fathers" of the science fiction genre.&lt;ref name="LocusHugoinfo"/&gt; Works are eligible for an award if they were published in the prior calendar year, or translated into English in the prior calendar year. There are no written rules as to which works qualify as science fiction or fantasy, and the decision of eligibility in that regard is left up to the voters, rather than to the organizing committee. Hugo Award nominees and winners are chosen by supporting or attending members of the annual [[Worldcon|World Science Fiction Convention]], or Worldcon, and the presentation evening constitutes its central event. The selection process is defined in the WSFS constitution as [[instant-runoff voting]] with five nominees per category, except in the case of a tie.&lt;ref name="thafaq"/&gt; The awards are split over more than a dozen categories, and include both written and dramatic works.&lt;ref name="thacat"/&gt;

For each category of Hugo, the voter may rank "No Award" as one of their choices. Voters are instructed that they should do so if they feel that none of the nominees are worthy of the award, or if they feel the category should be abolished entirely. A vote for "No Award" other than as one's first choice signifies that the voter believes the nominees ranked higher than "No Award" are worthy of a Hugo in that category, while those ranked lower are not.&lt;ref name="thavoting"/&gt;

The six works on the ballot for each category are the most-nominated by members that year, with no limit on the number of stories that can be nominated. With the exception of 1956, the first years of the awards did not include any recognition of runner-up novels, but since 1959 all of the candidates have been recorded.&lt;ref name="thafaq"/&gt; Initial nominations are made by members in January through March, while voting on the ballot of six nominations is performed roughly in April through July, subject to change depending on when that year's Worldcon is held.&lt;ref name="thaabout"/&gt; Prior to 2017, the final ballot was five works in each category.&lt;ref name="2017change"/&gt; Worldcons are generally held near the start of September, and take place in a different city around the world each year.&lt;ref name="LocusHugoinfo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="worldcon"/&gt;

The idea of giving out awards at Worldcons was proposed by Harold Lynch for the 1953 convention.&lt;ref name="HugoPropose"/&gt; The idea was based on the [[Academy Awards]],&lt;ref name="Nicholls595"/&gt; with the name "Hugo" being given by Robert A. Madle. The award trophy was created by Jack McKnight and [[Benedict Jablonski|Ben Jason]] in 1953, based on the design of hood ornaments of 1950s cars. It consisted of a finned rocket ship on a wooden base. Each subsequent trophy, with the exception of the 1958 trophy, has been similar to the original design. The rocket trophy was formally redesigned in 1984, and since then only the base of the trophy has changed each year.&lt;ref name="HugoTrophy"/&gt; There is no monetary or other remuneration associated with the Hugo, other than the trophy.&lt;ref name="thafaq"/&gt;

===Retro Hugos===
Retrospective Hugo Awards, or Retro Hugos, were added to the ballot beginning in 1996. They are awards optionally given by a Worldcon for works that would have been eligible 50, 75, or 100 years ago.&lt;ref name="thafaq"/&gt;

Prior to 2017, these could be awarded for the ten years that had a Worldcon where no Hugos were awarded: the conventions in 1939–41, 1946–52, and 1954.&lt;ref name="thafaq"/&gt;&lt;ref name='2015const'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wsfs.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/const-2015.pdf|date=August 23, 2015|publisher=The World Science Fiction Society|title=Constitution of the World Science Fiction Society, as of August 23, 2015|access-date=September 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Retro Hugos under these rules were given five times: in 1996, 2001, and 2004 for 50 years prior, and 2014 and 2016 for 75 years prior. The Worldcons eligible in 1997–2000, 2002, and 2015 chose not to award Retro Hugos, and under these rules there would have been no more opportunities to award them until 2022 (for 1947).&lt;ref name="LocusRetroHugoinfo" /&gt; 

A 2017 rule change expanded the criteria to be any year after 1939 in which no Hugos were awarded, whether or not there was a Worldcon that year, or fifteen years in total: 1939–52 and 1954.&lt;ref name="2017minutes"/&gt; [[Worldcon 76]] and [[77th World Science Fiction Convention|Dublin 2019]] then jointly announced that Retro Hugos would be awarded in 2018 for 1943 and in 2019 for 1944.&lt;ref name="LocusRetroHugoNews2017" /&gt;

==History==

===1950s===
The first Hugo Awards were presented at the [[11th World Science Fiction Convention|11th Worldcon]] in Philadelphia in 1953, which awarded Hugos in seven categories.&lt;ref name="Hugo53"/&gt; The awards presented that year were initially conceived as a one-off event, though the organizers hoped that subsequent conventions would also present them.&lt;ref name="PhilconBook"/&gt; At the time, Worldcons were completely run by their respective committees as independent events and had no oversight between years. Thus there was no mandate for any future conventions to repeat the awards, and no set rules for how to do so.&lt;ref name="Hugo54"/&gt;

The 1954 Worldcon chose not to, but the awards were reinstated at the 1955 Worldcon, and thereafter became traditional. The award was called the Annual Science Fiction Achievement Award, with "Hugo Award" being an unofficial, but better known name.&lt;ref name="LocusHugoinfo"/&gt; The nickname was accepted as an official alternative name in 1958, and since the 1992 awards the nickname has been adopted as the official name of the award.&lt;ref name="Nicholls595"/&gt;&lt;ref name="91minutes"/&gt;

In 1959, though there were still no formal guidelines governing the awards, several rules were instated which thereafter became traditional. These included having a ballot for nominating works earlier in the year and separate from the voting ballot; defining eligibility to include works published in the prior calendar year, rather than the previous rule of the "preceding year"; and allowing voters to select "no award" as an option, which then won that year in two categories: [[Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation|Dramatic Presentation]] and [[Discontinued Hugo Awards|Best New Author]].&lt;ref name="Hugo59"/&gt; The eligibility change additionally sparked a separate rule, prohibiting the nomination of works which had been nominated for the 1958 awards, as the two time periods overlapped.&lt;ref name="Franson36"/&gt;

===1960s===
In 1961, after the formation of the WSFS to oversee each Worldcon committee, formal rules were set down in the WSFS constitution mandating the presenting of the awards as one of the responsibilities of each Worldcon organizing committee. The rules restricted voting to members of the convention at which the awards would be given, while still allowing anyone to nominate works; nominations were restricted to members of the convention or the previous year's convention in 1963.&lt;ref name="Franson36"/&gt; The guidelines also specified the categories that would be awarded, which could only be changed by the World Science Fiction Society board.&lt;ref name="63minutes"/&gt; These categories were for [[Hugo Award for Best Novel|Best Novel]], [[Hugo Award for Best Short Story|Short Fiction]] (short stories, broadly defined), Dramatic Presentation, [[Hugo Award for Best Professional Magazine|Professional Magazine]], [[Hugo Award for Best Professional Artist|Professional Artist]], and [[Hugo Award for Best Fanzine|Best Fanzine]] (fan magazine).&lt;ref name="Hugo61"/&gt; 1963 was also the second year in which "no award" won a category, again for Dramatic Presentation.&lt;ref name="Hugo63"/&gt;

In 1964 the guidelines were changed to allow individual conventions to create additional categories, which was codified as up to two categories for that year. These [[Discontinued Hugo Awards|additional awards]] were officially designated as Hugo Awards, but were not required to be repeated by future conventions.&lt;ref name="63const"/&gt; This was later adjusted to only allow one additional category; while these extra Hugo Awards have been given out in several categories, only a few were ever awarded for more than one year.&lt;ref name="thacat"/&gt;

In 1967 categories for [[Hugo Award for Best Novelette|Novelette]], [[Hugo Award for Best Fan Writer|Fan Writer]], and [[Hugo Award for Best Fan Artist|Fan Artist]] were added, and a category for [[Hugo Award for Best Novella|Best Novella]] was added the following year; these new categories had the effect of providing a definition for what word count qualified a work for what category, which was previously left up to voters.&lt;ref name="Hugo67"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hugo68"/&gt; Novelettes had also been awarded prior to the codification of the rules. The fan awards were initially conceived as separate from the Hugo Awards, with the award for Best Fanzine losing its status, but were instead absorbed into the regular Hugo Awards by the convention committee.&lt;ref name="Franson36"/&gt;

===1970s===
While traditionally five works had been selected for nomination in each category out of the proposed nominees, in 1971 this was set down as a formal rule, barring ties.&lt;ref name="Franson36"/&gt; In 1973, the WSFS removed the category for Best Professional Magazine, and a [[Hugo Award for Best Professional Editor|Best Professional Editor]] award was instated as its replacement, in order to recognize "the increasing importance of original anthologies".&lt;ref name="Hugo73"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nicholls596"/&gt;

After that year the guidelines were changed again to remove the mandated awards and instead allow up to ten categories which would be chosen by each convention, though they were expected to be similar to those presented in the year before. Despite this change no new awards were added or previous awards removed before the guidelines were changed back to listing specific categories in 1977.&lt;ref name="Franson36"/&gt;&lt;ref name="74minutes"/&gt; 1971 and 1977 both saw "no award" win the Dramatic Presentation category for the third and fourth time; "no award" did not win any categories afterwards until 2015.&lt;ref name="Hugo71"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hugo77"/&gt;

===1980s and 90s===
In 1980 the category for Best Non-Fiction Book (later renamed [[Hugo Award for Best Related Work|Best Related Work]]) was added, followed by a category for [[Hugo Award for Best Semiprozine|Best Semiprozine]] (semi-professional magazine) in 1984.&lt;ref name="Hugo80"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hugo84"/&gt; In 1983, members of the [[Church of Scientology]] were encouraged by people such as [[Charles Platt (author)|Charles Platt]] to nominate as a bloc ''[[Battlefield Earth (novel)|Battlefield Earth]]'', written by the organization's founder [[L. Ron Hubbard]], for the Best Novel award; it did not make the final ballot.&lt;ref name="BEscandal"/&gt; Another campaign followed in 1987 to nominate Hubbard's ''[[Mission Earth (novel)|Black Genesis]]''; it made the final ballot but finished behind "no award".&lt;ref name="BGscandal"/&gt; 1989 saw a work—''The Guardsman'' by Todd Hamilton and P. J. Beese—withdrawn by its authors from the final ballot after a fan bought numerous memberships under false names, all sent in on the same day, in order to get the work onto the ballot.&lt;ref name="OlderScandals"/&gt;

In 1990 the Best Original Art Work award was given as an extra Hugo Award, and was listed again in 1991, though not actually awarded, and established afterward as an official Hugo Award.&lt;ref name="91minutes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="90minutes"/&gt; It was then removed from this status in 1996, and has not been awarded since.&lt;ref name="96minutes"/&gt; The Retro Hugos were created in the mid-1990s, and were first awarded in 1996.&lt;ref name="thafaq"/&gt;

===Since 2000===
In 2003, the Dramatic Presentation award was split into two categories, Long Form and Short Form.&lt;ref name="Hugo03"/&gt; This was repeated with the Best Professional Editor category in 2007.&lt;ref name="Hugo07"/&gt; 2009 saw the addition of the [[Hugo Award for Best Graphic Story|Best Graphic Story]] category, while the most recent change to the Hugo Awards was in 2012, when an award for [[Hugo Award for Best Fancast|Best Fancast]] was added.&lt;ref name="Hugo09"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hugo12"/&gt;

In 2015, two groups of science fiction writers, the "[[Sad Puppies]]" led by [[Brad R. Torgersen]] and [[Larry Correia]], and the "Rabid Puppies" led by [[Vox Day]], each put forward a similar [[voting bloc|slate of suggested nominations]] which came to dominate the ballot.&lt;ref name="The Guardian 9 April 2015"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Slate 8 April 2015"/&gt; The Sad Puppies campaign had run for two years prior on a smaller scale, with limited success. The leaders of the campaigns characterized them as a reaction to "niche, academic, overtly [leftist]" nominees and the Hugo becoming "an affirmative action award" that preferred female and non-white authors and characters.&lt;ref name="The Guardian 9 April 2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Daily Telegraph 6 April 2015"/&gt; In response, five nominees declined their nomination before and, for the first time, two after the ballot was published.&lt;ref name="Hugo2015Stats"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FirstAfter"/&gt; Multiple-Hugo-winner [[Connie Willis]] declined to present the awards.&lt;ref name="WillisDecline"/&gt; The slates were characterized by ''[[The Guardian]]'' as a "right wing",&lt;ref name="The Guardian 9 April 2015" /&gt; "orchestrated backlash"&lt;ref name="The Guardian 6 April 2015"/&gt; and by ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' as a "group of white guys",&lt;ref name="The A.V. Club 6 April 2015"/&gt; and were linked with the [[Gamergate controversy]].&lt;ref name="Slate 8 April 2015"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Boston Globe 7 April 2015"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Sydney Morning Herald 9 April 2015"/&gt; Multiple Hugo winner [[Samuel R. Delany]] characterized the campaigns as a response to "socio-economic" changes such as minority authors gaining prominence and thus "economic heft".&lt;ref name="DelanySP"/&gt; In all but the Best Dramatic Presentation, Long Form category, "no award" placed above all nominees that were on either slate, and it won all five categories that only contained slate nominees.&lt;ref name="Hugo2015Stats"/&gt; The two campaigns were repeated in 2016 with some changes to the campaigns, and the "Rabid Puppy" slate again dominated the ballot in several categories, with all five nominees in Best Related Work, Best Graphic Story, Best Professional Artist, and Best Fancast.&lt;ref name="Puppy2016"/&gt;

In response to the campaigns, a set of new rules, called "E Pluribus Hugo", were passed in 2015 and ratified in 2016 to modify the nominations process. Intended to ensure that organized minority groups cannot dominate every finalist position in a category, the new rules define a [[voting system]] in which nominees are eliminated one by one, with each vote for an eliminated work then spread out over the uneliminated works they nominated, until only the final shortlist remains. These rules were ratified in 2016 to be used for the first time in 2017. A rule mandating that the final nominees must appear on at least five percent of ballots was also eliminated, to ensure that all categories could reach a full set of nominees even when the initial pool of works was very large.&lt;ref name="2016RuleChange"/&gt; Each nominator is limited to five works in each category, but the final ballot was changed to six in each; additionally, no more than two works by a given author or group, or in the same dramatic series, can be in one category on the final ballot.&lt;ref name="2017change"/&gt;

In 2018 the newest permanent category, [[Hugo Award for Best Series|Best Series]], was begun; it was run the year prior as a special Hugo Award prior to being ratified at the business meeting.&lt;ref name="Hugo18"/&gt;

The only discontinued awards which were instated in the WSFS constitution as permanent categories were the Best Professional Magazine and Best Original Art Work Hugo Awards. Worldcon committees may also give out special awards during the Hugo ceremony, which are not voted on. Unlike the additional Hugo categories which Worldcons may present, these awards are not officially Hugo Awards and do not use the same trophy, though they once did.&lt;ref name="thacat"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Franson7"/&gt; An additional award, the [[John W. Campbell Award for Best New Writer]], is presented at the Hugo Award ceremony and voted on by the same process, but is not formally a Hugo Award.&lt;ref name="thacamp"/&gt; Another such award, for Best Young Adult Book, was first awarded in 2018.&lt;ref name="Hugo18"/&gt;

==Recognition==
The Hugo Award is highly regarded by observers. The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' has termed it "among the highest honors bestowed in science fiction and fantasy writing",&lt;ref name="LAT"/&gt; a claim echoed by ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'', who said that it was "the premier award in the science fiction genre".&lt;ref name="Wired"/&gt; [[Justine Larbalestier]], in ''The Battle of the Sexes in Science Fiction'' (2002), referred to the awards as "the best known and most prestigious of the science fiction awards",&lt;ref name="BOTSSF"/&gt; and [[Jo Walton]], writing for ''[[Tor Books|Tor.com]]'', said it was "undoubtedly science fiction's premier award".&lt;ref name="TOR"/&gt; ''[[The Guardian]]'' similarly acknowledged it as "a fine showcase for speculative fiction" as well as "one of the most venerable, democratic and international" science fiction awards "in existence".&lt;ref name="GuardianHugo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GuardianHugo2"/&gt; [[James E. Gunn (writer)|James Gunn]], in ''The New Encyclopedia of Science Fiction'' (1988), echoed ''The Guardian''{{'}}s statement of the award's democratic nature, saying that "because of its broad electorate" the Hugos were the awards most representative of "reader popularity".&lt;ref name="TNESF"/&gt; Camille Bacon-Smith, in ''Science Fiction Culture'' (2000), said that at the time fewer than 1000 people voted on the final ballot; she held, however, that this is a representative sample of the readership at large, given the number of winning novels that remain in print for decades or become notable outside of the science fiction genre, such as ''[[The Demolished Man]]'' or ''[[The Left Hand of Darkness]]''.&lt;ref name="SFC"/&gt; The 2014 awards saw over 1900 nomination submissions and over 3500 voters on the final ballot, while the 1964 awards received 274 votes.&lt;ref name="2014noms"/&gt;&lt;ref name="2014voters"/&gt;&lt;ref name="1964voters"/&gt; The 2015 awards saw 2122 nominating ballots and 5950 votes.&lt;ref name="2015noms"&gt;{{cite web |last=Standlee |first=Kevin |title=2015 Hugo Award Finalists Announced |url=http://www.thehugoawards.org/2015/04/2015-hugo-award-finalists-announced/ |publisher=World Science Fiction Society |date=2015-04-04 |accessdate=2015-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="2015votes"&gt;{{cite web |last=Searle-Kovacevic |first=Marah |title=Sasquan Announces Record Participation in the 2015 Hugo Awards Voting |url=http://sasquan.org/2015/08/sasquan-announces-record-participation-in-the-2015-hugo-awards-voting/ |publisher=Worldcon 2015 |date=2015-08-04 |accessdate=2015-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2016 awards saw 4032 nominating ballots and 3130 votes.&lt;ref name="2016noms"/&gt;&lt;ref name="2016votes"/&gt;

[[Brian Aldiss]], in his book ''Trillion Year Spree: The History of Science Fiction'', claimed that the Hugo Award was a barometer of reader popularity, rather than artistic merit; he contrasted it with the panel-selected [[Nebula Award]], which provided "more literary judgment", though he did note that the winners of the two awards often overlapped.&lt;ref name="TYS"/&gt; Along with the Hugo Award, the Nebula Award is also considered one of the premier awards in science fiction, with Laura Miller of [[Salon (website)|Salon.com]] terming it "science fiction's most prestigious award".&lt;ref name="SALONnebula"/&gt;

The official logo of the Hugo Awards is often placed on the winning books' cover as a promotional tool.&lt;ref name="HugoLogo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ScalziLogo"/&gt; [[Gahan Wilson]], in ''First World Fantasy Awards'' (1977), claimed that noting that a book had won the Hugo Award on the cover "demonstrably" increased sales for that novel,&lt;ref name="FWFA"/&gt; though [[Orson Scott Card]] said in his 1990 book ''How to Write Science Fiction &amp; Fantasy'' that the award had a larger effect on foreign sales than in the United States.&lt;ref name="HWSFF"/&gt; [[Spider Robinson]], in 1992, claimed that publishers were very interested in authors that won a Hugo Award, more so than for other awards such as the Nebula Award.&lt;ref name="SFC"/&gt; Literary agent Richard Curtis said in his 1996 ''Mastering the Business of Writing'' that having the term Hugo Award on the cover, even as a nominee, was a "powerful inducement" to science fiction fans to buy a novel,&lt;ref name="MBW"/&gt; while Jo Walton claimed in 2011 that the Hugo is the only science fiction award "that actually affects sales of a book".&lt;ref name="TOR"/&gt;

There have been several anthologies of Hugo-winning short fiction. The series ''[[The Hugo Winners]]'', edited by [[Isaac Asimov]], was started in 1962 as a collection of short story winners up to the previous year, and concluded with the 1982 Hugos in Volume 5. ''[[The New Hugo Winners]]'', edited originally by Asimov, later by [[Connie Willis]] and finally by [[Gregory Benford]], has four volumes collecting stories from the 1983 to the 1994 Hugos.&lt;ref name="AWCGSF"/&gt; The most recent anthology is ''The Hugo Award Showcase'' (2010), edited by [[Mary Robinette Kowal]]. It contains most of the short stories, novelettes, and novellas that were nominated for the 2009 award.&lt;ref name="THAS"/&gt;

[[File:Hipogeu Cala en Blanes 10 oct.jpg|thumb|Entrance of the hypogeum of Torre del Ram. ]]
The '''Hypogeum of Torre del Ram''' is an archaeological site of de '''Torre del Ram''', in Cala en Blanes ([[Ciutadella de Menorca]]), is a [[Bronze Age]] funerary [[hypogeum]], which was used as a collective tomb by a family or a small community. Even though it was emptied in later centuries to be reused as a cattle shelter, which caused the loss of all the information about the interred population, grave goods and chronology, its resemblance with other prehistoric tombs of Menorca dates it to between 1700 and 1400 BC.

A stepped corridor leads to the tomb's rectangular chamber, which has a stone bench that surrounds its internal perimeter. Part of the stone gallery, which used to cover the corridor and the entrance, is still preserved, which was built with the cyclopean{{explain|date=December 2017}} technique. 

The corridor is 2.60 m long, while the dimensions of the chamber are: 8.80 m long, 2.50 m wide and 1.95 m high. 
[[File:TORRE DEL RAM interior.jpg|thumb|right|View of the chamber of Torre del Ram hypogeum, ]]

The walls of the internal chamber present several engravings representing three sailing ships and other undetermined figures. Some authors claim the importance of these elements, since they could date back to the [[Bronze Age]].  However, the date of these engraving has not been determined and could have been made in any other subsequent period.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.menorcatalayotica.info/Contingut.aspx?IdPub=8574#ancla4&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1742">A '''linkage institution''' is a structure within a society that connects the people to the government or centralized authority. These institutions include: elections, political parties, interest groups, and the media.

==Development==

Government is formed as a legitimate alternative to violence. These governments create policy making institutions to develop rules by which conflicts within society are to abide by. Democratic governments often elect a legislative body. Monarchies develop a single arbitrator. Aristocracies develop a privileged body of individuals. All of which centralized authority, develop an institutionalized structure, and provides a means by which policy is made. Dynamic social change occasionally require rules within a society to change. Linkage institutions provide the means to connect those individuals within a society to the centralized authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jenkins|Klandermans|1995|pp=16–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Political exclusions and oligarchical tendencies within societies create "linkage failures". These events create contentions within society and act as motivators towards social protests and rebellion.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jenkins|Klandermans|1995|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was born in New York State, received a BA from Tufts University, a Masters of Public Health from the University of California, Berkeley and a PhD from the University of California, San Francisco. After receiving her doctoral degree in 1995, Moore was a fellow in the National Institutes of Mental Health, Traineeship in AIDS Prevention Sciences at the Center for AIDS Prevention Studies, the largest research center in the world dedicated to social, behavioral and policy science approaches to HIV.  She lives in Crown Heights, Brooklyn with her three daughters.

== Research ==

Moore is a qualitative, medical sociologist with expertise in science and technology studies, gender and sexuality studies, critical body studies and animal studies. She has published seven books and several articles in wide-ranging journals such as ''Social Text'', ''Hypatia'', ''Ethnography'', and ''Science, Technology and Human Values''.

''Catch and Release: The Enduring yet Vulnerable Horseshoe Crab'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Moore|first1=Lisa Jean|title=Catch and Release: The Enduring yet Vulnerable Horseshoe Crab|url=https://nyupress.org/books/9781479848478/|website=NYU Press|publisher=New York University Press|accessdate=October 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; (NYU Press) explores how humans literally harvest the life out of the horseshoe crabs. We use them as markers for understanding geologic time, collect them for agricultural fertilizer, and eat them as delicacies, capture them as bait, then rescue them for conservation,  and categorize them as endangered.

''Buzz: Urban Beekeeping and the Power of the Bee''&lt;ref&gt;Moore, Lisa Jean and Mary Kosut. 2013. Buzz: Urban Beekeeping and the Power of the Bee. (New York: New York University Press). http://nyupress.org/books/book-details.aspx?bookId=12100#.UiTDTLzo854 {{ISBN|9781479827381}}&lt;/ref&gt; (NYU Press) is based on a collaborative multi-sited ethnography of urban beekeepers in the NYC area. This work with sociologist Mary Kosut investigates the socio-cultural relationship between humans and bees, focusing on how bees become meaningful to human life, and how humans have created conditions of their necessity to bees’ survival.  This book won the 2014 Distinguished Scholarship Award from the [[American Sociological Association]]'s Animals and Society Section.

In 2007, she published ''Sperm Counts: Overcome by Man’s Most Precious Fluid'' (NYU Press)&lt;ref&gt;Moore, Lisa Jean. 2007.  Sperm Counts: Overcome by Man’s Most Precious Fluid.  (New York: New York University Press). http://nyupress.org/books/book-details.aspx?bookid=517#.UiTDsLzo854 {{ISBN|9780814795620}}&lt;/ref&gt; a qualitative research project which analyzes historical documentation of biomedical and contemporary representations from reproductive scientists, semen banking promotional materials on the Internet, children’s "facts of life" books, pornography, forensics transcripts, and sex workers’ narratives, and participant observation.

Her collaborative book with Monica J. Casper entitled ''Missing Bodies: The Politics of Visibility''&lt;ref&gt;Casper, Monica and Lisa Jean Moore. 2009.  Missing Bodies: The Politics of Visibility. (New York: New York University Press). http://nyupress.org/books/book-details.aspx?bookid=1020#.UiTEK7zo854 {{ISBN|9780814716779}}&lt;/ref&gt; (NYU Press) draws on varied approaches to examine six provocative sites where some human bodies are highly visible while others are not represented at all, with important consequences for social action and policy. The book calls for a new, systemic, and politically engaged “ocular ethics,” one grounded not merely in representations but also in analysis of social structures.

With [[Judith Lorber]], Moore has written two books. ''Gendered Bodies: Feminist Perspectives''&lt;ref&gt;Lorber, Judith and Lisa Jean Moore. 2011. Gendered Bodies: Feminist Perspectives. (Oxford: Oxford University Press). http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/he/subject/Sociology/SocialInequality/SociologyoftheBody/?&amp;ci=9780199732456 {{ISBN|9780199732456}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Oxford University Press) offers a feminist interpretation of prenatal to after-death gendered bodies, men’s as well as women’s, of different abilities, racial ethnic identities, ages, sexualities, and social classes. ''Gender and the Social Construction of Illness''&lt;ref&gt;Lorber, Judith and Lisa Jean Moore. 2002.  Gender and The Social Construction of Illness. 2nd Edition.  (Walnut Creek, CA: Alta Mira Press). https://rowman.com/ISBN/9780759102378 {{ISBN|9780759102378}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Altamira Press) considers the interface between the social institutions of gender and Western medicine and offers a distinct feminist viewpoint to analyze issues of power and politics concerning physical illness.

The edited collection ''The Body Reader: Essential Social and Cultural Readings'',&lt;ref&gt;Moore, Lisa Jean and Mary Kosut. 2010. The Body Reader: Essential Social and Cultural Readings.  (New York: New York University Press). http://nyupress.org/books/book-details.aspx?bookid=3416#.UiTE4bzo854 {{ISBN|9780814795651}}&lt;/ref&gt; a collaborative effort with Mary Kosut, charts the field of the “sociology of the body” by establishing a collection of well-known (tried and true) writing combined with original essays solicited to address particular theoretical and conceptual needs.

In 2014, the textbook ''The Body: Social and Cultural Dissections'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Moore|first1=Lisa Jean|author2=Casper, Monica J.|title=The Body: Social and Cultural Dissections|date=2014|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-0415821964}}&lt;/ref&gt; written with Monica J. Casper, offers a comprehensive and accessible overview of sociological and cultural perspectives on the human body. Organized along the lines of a standard anatomical textbook delineated by body parts and processes, this volume subverts the expected content in favor of providing tools for social and cultural analysis.

== Book Series ==

Moore is the co-founder and co-editor, with Monica Casper, of the book series for NYU Press titled [http://nyupress.org/series/biopolitics/ Biopolitics: Medicine, Technoscience, and Health in the 21st Century].

'''Luigi Canina''' ([[Casale Monferrato]], 1795 – [[Florence]], 1856) was an [[Italy|Italian]] [[archaeologist]] and [[architect]].

Luigi Canina, Italian architect and archeologist, was born in [[Casale Monferrato]] in 1795 and died in [[Florence]] in 1856. He was a pupil of [[Ferdinando Bonsignore]] in [[Turin]], and settled in [[Rome]] in 1818. Among his works are: some construction at the [[Villa Borghese gardens|Villa Borghese]] (monumental neoclassical propylaea from [[Piazzale Flaminio]]); Casino Vagnuzzi outside of Porta del Popolo in Egyptian style; not realized projects for reconstruction of the [[sanctuary of Oropa]] (1856). He became professor of architecture at [[Turin]], and his most important works were the excavation of [[Tusculum]] in 1829 and of the [[Appian Way]] in 1848, the results of which he embodied in a number of works published in a costly form by his patroness, the [[queen of Sardinia]]. In 1843, he was elected into the [[National Academy of Design]] as an Honorary member.

[[File:Casal rotondo2.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A wall of fragments assembled by Canina on the Appian Way next to the [[Casal Rotondo]]]]

Canina is also noted for his studies of history and archeology: ''Ancient architecture described and represented in documents'' (1830–44). A column opposite the [[San Sebastiano fuori le mura|basilica of Saint Sebastian]] on the Appian Way close to Rome records Canina's work in rescuing many Roman ruins and turning the road into the archeological park that it is today.

In England he restored interiors at [[Alnwick Castle]], [[Northumberland]].

[[File:Duccio Maestà.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The central panel of [[Duccio]]'s ''[[Maestà (Duccio)|Maestà with Twenty Angels and Nineteen Saints]]'' (1308–1311), [[Museo dell'Opera Metropolitana del Duomo a Siena|Museo dell'Opera del Duomo]], [[Siena]].]]
'''Maestà''' {{IPA-it|maeˈsta|}}, the Italian word for "majesty", designates an [[Iconography|iconic formula]] of the enthroned [[Madonna (art)|Madonna]] with the [[child Jesus]], whether or not accompanied with [[angel]]s and [[saint]]s. The ''Maestà'' is an extension of the "[[Seat of Wisdom]]" theme of the seated "Mary [[Theotokos]]", "Mary Mother of God", which is a counterpart to the earlier icon of [[Christ in Majesty]], the enthroned Christ that is familiar in Byzantine [[Mosaics]]. '''''Maria Regina''''' is an art historians' synonym for the [[icon]]ic image of Mary enthroned, with or without the Child.&lt;ref&gt;See M. Lawrence's discussion of this image, "Maria Regina", ''Art Bulletin'' '''7''' (1924–1925:150-61.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the West, the image seems to have developed, based perhaps on Byzantine precedents such as the coin of Constantine's Empress [[Fausta]], crowned and with their sons on her lap&lt;ref&gt;Suggested by Lawrence 1924:&lt;/ref&gt; and on literary examples, such as [[Flavius Cresconius Corippus]]'s celebration of [[Justin II]]'s coronation in 565.&lt;ref&gt;In Corippus' poem, Sophia (Wisdom) prays "''Virgo, creatoris genetrix sanctissima mundi, excelsi regina poli...''". (''Corippus'', A. Cameron, ed., ''In laudem Justini augusti minoris'' (London) 1976, vol. II:52f. The more familiar ''In laudem Mariae'', praising Mary as [[Regina Coeli|Queen of Heaven]], is a late sixth century poem, perhaps by [[Venantius Fortunatus]].&lt;/ref&gt; Paintings depicting the ''Maestà'' came into the mainstream artistic repertory, especially in Rome, in the late twelfth and early thirteenth centuries,&lt;ref&gt;Several rare examples in fresco and mosaic, including the lost apse mosaic in the first church in Rome dedicated to Mary, the [[Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore]], are listed by John L. Osborne, "Early Medieval Painting in San Clemente, Rome: The Madonna and Child in the Niche", ''Gesta'' '''20'''.2 (1981:299–310) p. 304f.&lt;/ref&gt; with an increased emphasis on the veneration of Mary. The ''Maestà'' was often executed in [[fresco]] technique directly on plastered walls or as paintings on gessoed wooden [[altar]] [[panel painting|panels]].

A more domestic representation, suitable to private devotion, is the iconographic theme of [[Madonna and Child]].

==Examples of ''Maestà'' in painting==
{{main|Maestà (Duccio)}} 
The most famous example of the ''Maestà'' is the ''Maestà with Twenty Angels and Nineteen Saints'', an [[altarpiece]] comprising many individual paintings commissioned by the city of [[Siena]] in 1308 from the artist [[Duccio di Buoninsegna]]. The painting was installed in the [[Siena Cathedral|city's cathedral]] on June 9, 1311. Although it took a generation for its effect truly to be felt, Duccio's ''Maestà'' set Italian painting on a course leading away from the hieratic representations of Byzantine art towards more direct presentations of reality.

Creating this altarpiece assembled from many wood panels bonded together before painting was an arduous undertaking. The work was not only large, the central panel was 7 by 13 feet, but it had to be painted on both sides since it could be seen from all directions when installed on the main altar at the centre of the sanctuary.&lt;ref&gt;Stockstad, Marilyn&lt;/ref&gt;

On the back of the ''Maesta'' were episodes from the life of Christ, focusing on his Passion. Sacred narrative unfolds in elegant episodes enacted by graceful figures who seem to dance their way through these stories while still conveying emotional content.&lt;ref&gt;Stokstad, Marilyn&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the ''Maesta'' was dismantled in 1771, its power and beauty can only be imagined from scattered parts, some still in Siena, Italy, but others elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;Stokstad, Marilyn&lt;/ref&gt;

Other noted examples of the ''Maestà'' are [[Simone Martini]]'s ''Maestà'' in the [[Palazzo Pubblico]], Siena, or [[Cimabue]]'s fresco in the [[Basilica of San Francesco d'Assisi]].

'''Mitja Brodar''' (1921 – 16 February 2012) was a [[Slovenia]]n [[archaeology|archaeologist]]. He was a son of [[Srečko Brodar]], a pioneer of the study of the Paleolithic period in Slovenia.

==Life==
He was born in 1921 in [[Celje]] where his father was at the time teaching science at the [[First Grammar School, Celje|Grammar school in Celje]].

During [[Province of Ljubljana|Italian occupation of Ljubljana]] in WW2 he was sent to the [[Rab concentration camp|Italian concentration camp Rab]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arheologija.si/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=90:dr-mitja-brodar&amp;catid=35:novice&amp;Itemid=54 |title=Mitja Brodar (in memoriam) |language=Slovenian |publisher=Slovenian archeological association |date=16 February 2012 }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
Brodar studied at the [[University of Ljubljana]] civil engineering, geology, and paleontology. Between 1954 and 1956 and in 1960 he was excavating [[Mokrica Cave]] ({{lang-sl|Mokriška jama}}). He received PhD in 1959 with a thesis on those excavations. [[Betal Rock Shelter]] ({{lang|sl|Betalov spodmol}}) is another site he was excavating.

He helped establish and was during the 1970s president of the Slovene archaeological association. Together with his father he wrote a book on [[Potok Cave]] ({{lang-sl|Potočka zijalka}}) excavations.

;Divje Babe flute
According to him, the [[Divje Babe flute]] is a product of [[Cro-Magnon]], modern human, and not Neanderthal.&lt;ref name="GL2008"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gore-ljudje.net/novosti/39105/ |title="Piščalka" iz Divjih bab ni neandertalska |language=Slovenian |trans-title=The Divje Babe "Flute" is not Neanderthal |first=Mitja |last=Brodar |date=26 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pre-Columbian art''' refers to the [[Visual arts of indigenous peoples of the Americas|visual arts of indigenous peoples]] of the [[Caribbean]], [[North America|North]],  [[Central America|Central]], and [[South America]]s until the late 15th and early 16th centuries, and the time period marked by [[Christopher Columbus]]' arrival in the Americas.

[[Pre-Columbian]] art thrived throughout the [[Americas]] from at least 13,000 BCE to the European conquests, and sometimes continued for a time afterwards. Many [[Pre-Columbian cultures]] did not have writing systems, so visual art expressed [[cosmology|cosmologies]], [[world view]]s, religion, and philosophy of these cultures, as well as serving as [[mnemonic]] devices.

During the period before and after [[Age of Discovery|European exploration]] and conquest of the Americas, indigenous native cultures produced a wide variety of visual arts, including painting on textiles, hides, rock and cave surfaces, bodies especially faces, ceramics, architectural features including interior murals, wood panels, and other available surfaces. For many of these cultures, the visual arts went beyond physical appearance and served as active extensions of their owners and indices of the divine.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/981761498|title=Golden kingdoms : luxury arts in the ancient Americas|others=Pillsbury, Joanne,, Potts, Timothy F.,, Richter, Kim N.,, J.

Moreover,
many societies used raw materials not available in the geographic location in which they were situated, suggesting difficulty of acquisition as a source of value.  &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/981761498|title=Golden kingdoms : luxury arts in the ancient Americas|others=Pillsbury, Joanne,, Potts, Timothy F.,, Richter, Kim N.,, J.

==Mesoamerica and Central America==
The Mesoamerican cultures are generally divided into three periods (see [[Mesoamerican chronology]]):

*Pre-classic (up to 200 CE)
*Classic (ca. 200–900 CE)
*Post-classic (ca. 900 to 1580 CE).

The Pre-classic period was dominated by the highly developed [[Olmec]] civilization, which flourished around 1200–400 BCE. The Olmecs produced [[jade]] figurines, and created heavy-featured, [[Olmec colossal heads|colossal heads]], up to 2 meters (8&amp;nbsp;ft) high, that still stand mysteriously in the landscape. The Mesoamerican tradition of building large ceremonial centres appears to have begun under the Olmecs.

During the Classic period the dominant Civilization was the [[Maya civilization|Maya]]. Maya royalty commissioned artwork that commemorated their achievements and secured their place in time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schele|first1=Linda, et al|title=The Blood of Kings: Dynasty and Ritual in Maya Art|date=2006|publisher=G. Braziller}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scenes depicting various rituals and historical events are embedded with hieroglyphic text to enable the viewer to identify the important figures, times and places instead of relying upon physical features that could be forgotten over time. The interpretation of the actions represented in the artwork goes hand in hand with  understanding the decorative text that is woven into the picture. Unlocking this hieroglyphic text is vital as it removes anonymity and mystery from the scenes and reveals detailed records of those who held power throughout the timeline of the civilization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schele|first1=Linda, et al|title=The Blood of Kings: Dynasty and Ritual in Maya Art|date=2006|publisher=G. Braziller}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the Mississippian peoples of North America such as the Choctaw and Natchez, the Maya organized themselves into large, agricultural communities. They practised their own forms of [[Maya hieroglyphics|hieroglyphic writing]] and even advanced [[astronomy]]. Mayan art consequently focuses on rain, [[agriculture]], and [[fertility]], expressing these images mainly in relief and surface decoration, as well as some sculpture. [[Glyphs]] and stylized figures were used to decorate architecture such as the pyramid temple of [[Chichén Itzá]]. Murals dating from about 750 CE were discovered when the city of Bonampak was excavated in 1946.

The Post-classic period (10th–12th centuries) was dominated by the [[Toltecs]] who made colossal, block-like sculptures such as those employed as free-standing columns at Tula, [[Mexico]]. The [[Mixtecs]] developed a style of painting known as Mixtec-Puebla, as seen in their murals and codices (manuscripts), in which all available space is covered by flat figures in geometric designs. The [[Aztec]] culture in Mexico produced some dramatically expressive examples of Aztec art, such as the decorated skulls of captives and stone sculpture, of which Tlazolteotl (Woods Bliss Collection, Washington), a goddess in childbirth, is a good example.

==South America==
In the [[Andean]] region of South America (modern-day [[Peru]]), the [[Chavin culture|Chavín civilization]] flourished from around 1000 BCE to 300 BCE. The Chavín produced small-scale pottery, often human in shape but with animal features such as bird feet, reptilian eyes, or feline fangs. Representations of jaguar are a common theme in Chavín art. The Chavin culture is also noted for the spectacular murals and carvings found its main religious site of [[Chavin de Huantar]]; these works include the [[Raimondi Stela]], the [[Lanzón]], and the Tello Obelisk.

Contemporary with the Chavin was the '''[[Paracas culture]]''' of the southern coast of Peru, most noted today for their elaborate textiles. These amazing productions, some of which could measure ninety feet long, were primarily used for as burial wraps for Paracas mummy bundles. Paracas art was greatly influenced by the Chavín cult, and the two styles share many common motifs.

On the south coast, the Paracas were immediately succeeded by a flowering of artistic production around the [[Nazca]] river valley. The '''[[Nazca]]''' period is divided into eight ceramic phases, each one depicting increasingly abstract animal and human motifs. These period range from Phase 1, beginning around 200 CE, to Phase 8, which declined in the middle of the eighth century. The Nasca people are most famous for the [[Nazca lines]], though they are usually regarded as making some of the most beautiful polychrome ceramics in the Andes.

On the north coast, the [[Moche (culture)|Moche]] succeeded the Chavin. The Moche flourished about 100–800 CE, and were among the best artisans of the Pre-Columbian world, producing [[Moche portrait vessel|delightful portrait vases]] (Moche ware), which, while realistic, are steeped in religious references, the significance of which is now lost. For the Moche, ceramics functioned as a primary way of disseminating information and cultural ideas. The Moche made ceramic vessels that depicted and re-created a plethora of objects: fruits, plants, animals, human portrais, gods, demons, as well as graphic depictions of sexual acts. The Moche are also noted for their metallurgy (such as that found in the tomb of the [[Lord of Sípan]]), as well as their architectural prowess, such as the [[Huaca de la Luna]] and the [[Huaca del Sol]] in the Moche River valley.

Following the decline of the Moche, two large co-existing empires emerged in the Andes region. In the north, the [[Huari culture|Wari]] (or Huari) Empire, based in their capital city of the same name. The Wari are noted for their stone architecture and sculpture accomplishments, but their greatest proficiency was ceramic. The Wari produced magnificent large ceramics, many of which depicted images of the [[Staff God]], an important deity in the Andes which during the Wari period had become specifically associated with the [[Lake Titicaca]] region on the modern Peru-Bolivia border. Similarly, the Wari's contemporaries of the [[Tiwanaku]] empire, also centered around a capital city of the same name, held the [[Staff God]] in similar esteem. Tiwanaku's empire began to expand out of  Titicaca around 400 BCE, but its "Classic Period" of artistic production and political power occurred between 375 and 700 CE. Tiwanaku is currently known for its magnificent imperial city on the southern side of Lake Titicaca, now in modern-day Bolivia. Especially famous is the [[Gate of the Sun]], which depicts a large image of the Staff God flanked by other religious symbols which may have functioned as a calendar.

Following the decline of the Wari Empire in the late first millennium, the [[Chimú]] people, centered out of their capital city of [[Chimor]] began to build their empire on the north and central coasts of Peru. The Chimú were preceded by a simple ceramic style known as [[Sican culture#Early Sican|Sicán]] (700-900 CE) which became increasingly decorative until it became recognizable as Chimú in the early second millennium. The Chimú produced excellent portrait and decorative works in metal, notably gold but especially silver. The Chimú also are noted for their featherwork, having produced many standards and headdresses made of a variety of tropical feathers which were fashioned into bired and fish designs, both of which were held in high esteem by the Chimú. The Chimú are best known for their magnificent palatial complex of [[Chan Chan]] just south of modern-day [[Trujillo, Peru]]; now a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]]. The Chimú went into decline very quickly due to outside pressures and conquest from the expanding [[Inca Empire]] in the mid-15th century.

At the time of the Spanish conquest, the [[Inca Empire]] (Tawantinsuyu in [[Quechua languages|Quechua]], the "Land of the Four Quarters") was the largest and wealthiest empire in the world, and this was depicted in their art. Most Inca sculpture was melted down by the invading Spanish, so most of what remains today is in the form of architecture, textiles, and ceramics. The Inca valued gold among all other metals, and equated it with the sun god [[Inti]]. Some Inca buildings in the capital of [[Cusco]] were literally covered in gold, and most contained many gold and silver sculptures. Most Inca art, however, was abstract in nature. Inca ceramics were primarily large vessels covered in geometric designs. Inca tunics and textiles contained similar motifs, often checkerboard patterns reserved for the Inca elite and the Inca army. Today, due to the unpopularity of abstract art and the lack of Inca gold and silver sculpture, the Inca are best known for the architecture - specifically the complex of [[Machu Picchu]] just northwest of Cusco. Inca architecture makes use of large stone blocks, each one cut specifically to fit around the other blocks in a wall. These stones were cut with such precision that the Incas did not need to make use of mortar to hold their buildings together. Even without mortar, Inca buildings still stand today; they form many of the foundations for even modern-day buildings in Cusco and the surrounding area. The Incas produced thousand of large stone structures, among them forts, temples, and palaces, even though the Inca Empire lasted for only ninety-five years.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10892">The  '''Proto-Ionians''' are the hypothetical earliest speakers of the [[Ionic Greek|Ionic dialects]] of [[Ancient Greek]], chiefly in the works of Jean Faucounau. The relation of Ionic to the other Greek dialects has been subject to some debate. It is mostly grouped with [[Arcadocypriot]] as opposed to [[Doric Greek|Doric]], reflecting two waves of migration into Greece following the [[Proto-Greek]] period, but sometimes also as separate from Arcadocypriot on equal footing with Doric, suggesting three distinct waves of migration.

==Position of Ionic Greek==

Mainstream Greek linguistics separates the [[Ancient Greek dialects|Greek dialects]] into two large genetic groups, one including [[Doric Greek]] and the other including both [[Arcadocypriot]] and [[Ionic Greek]]. But alternative approaches proposing three groups are not uncommon; Thumb and Kieckers (1932) propose three groups, classifying Ionic as genetically just as separate from Arcadocypriot as from Doric. Like a few other linguists (Vladimir Georgiev, C. Rhuijgh, P. Léveque, etc.),
The bipartite classification is known as the "Risch–Chadwick theory", named after its two famous proponents, Ernst Risch and [[John Chadwick]].{{ref|Chadwick}}

The "Proto-Ionians" first appear in the work of [[Ernst Curtius]] (1887), who believed that the [[Attic-Ionic]] dialect group was due to an "Ionicization" of Attica by immigration from Ionia in historical times. Curtius hypothesized that there had been a "Proto-Ionian" migration from the Balkans to western Anatolia in the same period that brought the [[Arcadocypriot|Arcadic]] dialect (the successor of the [[Mycenean Greek]] stage yet undiscovered in the time of Curtius) to mainland Greece.{{ref|Hallm}} Curtius' hypothesis was endorsed by George Hempl in 1920.{{ref|Hempl}} Hempl preferred to call these hypothetical, early Anatolian Greeks "Javonians". Hempl attempted to defend a reading of [[Hittite cuneiform]] as Greek, in spite of the  establishment of the [[Hittite language]] as a separate branch of Indo-European by Hrozný in 1917.

==Faucounau==
{{Notability|date=April 2009}}
The tripartite theory was revived by amateur linguist Jean Faucounau. In his view, the first Greek settlers in their historical territory were the (Pelasgic) "proto-Ionians", who were separated around 3000 BC from both the proto-[[Dorians]] and the proto-[[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaeans]]. Faucounau traces this three-wave model to similar views put forward by [[Paul Kretschmer]] in the 1890s and the 1900s (''i.e.'', before the decipherment of [[Linear B]]), with a modification: the (proto-Ionic) First wave came by sea, the "Proto-Ionians" settling first in the Cycladic Islands, then in Euboea and Attica. The last two waves are the generally accepted arrival of the Mycenaean Greeks (the linguistic predecessors of the Arcadocypriot speakers) in around 1700 BC and the [[Dorian invasion]] around 1100 BC.

Following Georgiev{{ref|Georgiev1}}{{ref|Georgiev2}}, Faucounau makes three arguments for the proto-Ionic language{{ref|Faucouneau}}. The first is the explanation of certain Mycenaean forms as [[loan word|loan-words]] from the proto-Ionians already present in Greece: he asserts that [[digamma]] is unexpectedly absent from some Mycenaean words,{{ref|digamma}} the occasional resolution of [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] [[Syllabic consonant|vocalic ''r'']] to ''-or/ro-'' instead of ''-ar/ra-''; ''to-pe-za'' for τράπεζα,{{ref|trapeza}} and the explanation of Mycenaean ''pa-da-yeu'' as Greek παδάω/πηδάω{{ref|LSJ}}, "spring leap, bound", which he interprets as both [[cognate]] with, and having the same meaning as, [[modern English|English]] ''paddle''.{{ref|paddle}}.

The second argument is a refinement of a long-established argument in [[archaeoastronomy]], developed most recently by Michael Ovenden,{{ref|Ovenden}} which considers the motion of the North Pole with respect to the fixed stars, because of the [[precession]] of the [[equinox]]es. Ovenden concluded, from the slant of the [[constellation]]s in the present sky and the hypothesis that [[Aratus]] and [[Hipparchus]] (insofar as his work survives) correctly and completely represent immemorial tradition, that the constellations we now use had been devised when the Pole was in [[Draco (constellation)|Draco]], about 2800 BC. He also concluded that the inventors probably lived between 34°30' and 37°30' N., north of most ancient civilizations, and so were likely to be the Minoans.

Dr. Crommelin, FRAS, has disputed this latitude, arguing that the constellation makers could only see to 54° S, but that this was compatible with latitudes as low as the 31°N of [[Alexandria]]; stars which only skirt the southern horizon by a few degrees are not effectively visible. Assuming a Greek latitude would render [[Canopus]] and [[Fomalhaut]] invisible. Crommelin estimates the constellators at 2460 BC; [[Richard Anthony Proctor|R. A. Proctor]] has estimated 2170 BC. [[E. W. Maunder]] 2700 BC.{{Ref|Crommelin}}

Faucounau's addition to this is the argument that Crete is also too far south, that the names of the constellations are (Ionic) Greek, not Minoan, and therefore that the constellation makers must be the proto-Ionians in the [[Cyclades]].{{ref|Crete}}  The south coast of Crete follows 35°N latitude; [[Syros]], which he identifies as a center of proto-Ionian civilization,{{ref|syros}} is at 37°20'.{{ref|Atlas}} On this basis, he identifies the proto-Ionians with the archaeological [[Cyclades|Early Cycladic II]] culture: after all, they made round "[[frying pans]]," and one of them with an incised spiral, and the Phaistos Disc is round with an incised spiral.{{Ref|pan}}

His third argument depends on Herodotus's somewhat obscure use of the word [[Pelasgians|Pelasgian]] for various peoples, Greek-speaking and otherwise, around the Aegean basin. Faucounau claims that the word, which he derives idiosyncratically from πελαγος, "sea",{{ref|pelagos}} means the descendants of the proto-Ionians. Some of them lost their language because they settled among foreigners; others, such as the Athenians, preserved their language - Attic, apparently, arises from a mixture of proto-Ionian and other dialects. He does not explain why Homer speaks of [[Dodona]], inland in north-western Greece, as Pelasgian (Il, 16,233); nor why no place in historic [[Ionia]] is called Pelasgian.

He adds to the above arguments with archaeological facts. For example, the Treaty of [[Alaksandu]] between [[Wilusa]] and the [[Hittite empire]] bore a Greek name at a time when there was no Mycenaean pottery at Troy. Faucounau considers that all these arguments are an indirect confirmation of his own decipherment claim of the [[Phaistos Disk]] as proto-Ionic.

Faucounau's "Proto-Ionic Disk Language" has most of the properties of [[Homeric Greek]], including loss of [[Labial–velar consonant|labiovelars]] and even of [[digamma]] (both are preserved intact in the Mycenaean of the 14th century BC). Digamma, in Faucounau's reading of the Phaistos Disk, has in some instances passed to ''y'', a sound shift not known from any other Greek dialect, but suspected in Ionic (e.g. Ion. païs v/etym. paus). For Faucounau, the [[Pelasgian]]s, the [[Troy|Trojans]], the [[Carians]] and the [[Philistines]] are all descended from the Proto-Ionians.

Faucounau's work on this subject has received two scholarly notices. [[Paul Faure (archeologist)|Paul Faure]], as below, writes warmly of many parts of the Proto-Ionian theory. He declines to address the decipherment, and omits the Celts; he also dates the Middle Cycladic culture only from 2700 BC, not 2900. Yves Duhoux expresses his disbelief in the decipherment, but does not mention the wider theory, except to deny that the Disc came from Syros. Faucounau's paper on the statistical problem of how many glyphs are likely to be omitted from a short text has never been cited. Most of it addresses the long-solved case in which the glyphs are equally likely.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6711">A '''referent''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|r|ɛ|f|ə|r|ə|n|t}}) is a person or thing to which a [[name]] – a [[linguistics|linguistic]] [[Phrase|expression]] or other [[symbol]] – [[reference|refers]]. For example, in the sentence ''Mary saw me'', the referent of the word ''Mary'' is the particular person called Mary who is being spoken of, while the referent of the word ''me'' is the person uttering the sentence.

Two expressions which have the same referent are said to be [[co-referential]]. In the sentence ''John had his dog with him'', for instance, the [[noun]] ''John'' and the [[pronoun]] ''him'' are co-referential, since they both refer to the same person (John).

==Etymology and meanings==
The word 'referent' may be considered to derive from the Latin ''referentem'', the [[present participle]] (in accusative form) of the verb ''referre'' ("carry back", see also [[Reference#Etymology and meanings|etymology of ''refer(ence)'']]); or simply from the addition of the suffix ''-ent'' to the verb ''refer'' on the model of other English words having that suffix. It is defined in the [[Merriam-Webster]] Dictionary as "one that &lt;u&gt;refers&lt;/u&gt; or &lt;u&gt;is referred to&lt;/u&gt;; especially: the thing that a symbol (as a word or sign) stands for."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/referent |title=Referent – Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary |publisher=merriam-webster.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest meaning of ''referent'' recorded in the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' is "one who is referred to or consulted", dating from 1844. A subsequent meaning is "a word referring to another"; the OED gives only one citation for this use, dating from 1899 (which speaks of "referent words or referents" that express a relation). The next meaning, which appears to stand in opposition to the previous meaning, as well as to the meaning implied by the etymology, is nonetheless the one which has gained currency: "that to which something [particularly a word or expression] has reference". This sense is first recorded in Ogden and Richards' ''[[The Meaning of Meaning]]'' (1923; see further below); the OED also lists numerous subsequent examples of that usage.

In [[logic]], the word ''referent'' is sometimes used to denote one of the two objects participating in a [[binary relation|relation]], the other being called the '''relatum'''.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', Second Edition (1989), entry for ''referent''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In semantics and philosophy==
[[File:Ogden semiotic triangle.png|thumb|right|220px|The [[triangle of reference]], from Ogden and Richards' ''The Meaning of Meaning''.]]
In fields such as [[semantics]], [[semiotics]], and the [[theory of reference]], a distinction is made between a referent and a [[reference]]. Reference is a relationship in which a [[symbol]] or [[sign]] (a word, for example) signifies something; the referent is the thing signified. The referent may be an actual person or object, or may be something more abstract, such as a set of actions.&lt;ref&gt;Hildegard E. Peplau, ''Interpersonal Relations in Nursing: A Conceptual Frame ...'' (2004), p. 289: "Each concept or word has both a referent and a reference. The word is the symbol; the reference is its meaning held in the mind of its user; and the referent is the actions or ob}ect the symbol signified."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David M. Miller, ''The net of Hephaestus: A study of modern criticism'' (1971):  "... then, the general quality of 'dogness' suggested by the recurrence of similar sense perceptions is abstracted and stored in the memory. We now have a Referent and a Reference. Next, a symbol is constructed: visual and linguistic."&lt;/ref&gt;

Reference and referents were considered at length in the 1923 book ''[[The Meaning of Meaning]]'' by the [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] scholars [[C. K. Ogden]] and [[I. A. Richards]]. Ogden has pointed out that reference is a psychological process, and that referents themselves may be psychological – existing in the imagination of the referrer, and not necessarily in the real world.&lt;ref&gt;Correspondence from C. K. Ogden to [[Whately Carington]], quoted in ''C. K. Ogden and Linguistics'', Psychology Press, 1994, vol. 1, p. xxiii: "A 'reference' and a 'referent' are parts of a sign or symbol situation [...] 'Visualizing', as such, is not relevant. References are always 'psychological' in a sign or symbol situation; referents may be psychological, i.e., in the order of the referrer's imaginings; ..."&lt;/ref&gt; For further ideas related to this observation, see [[failure to refer]].

==In syntax==
Considerations of the possible arrangement of expressions which may be ''co-referential'' – having the same referent – have been undertaken by [[linguist]]s engaged in the study of [[syntax]], particularly since [[Noam Chomsky]]'s launch of [[Government and Binding Theory]] (GBT) in the 1980s. The subject of [[binding (linguistics)|binding]] is largely concerned with the possible syntactic positions of co-referential [[noun phrase]]s and [[pronoun]]s. Attempts are made to explain phenomena such as that illustrated by the following pair of sentences:
*Before she dried off, Mary was wet.
*She dried off because Mary was wet.
In the first sentence, ''she'' and ''Mary'' may have the same referent (''she'' may refer to Mary), but in the second they normally cannot. More details of these considerations can be found in the articles on GBT and binding linked to above.

==In computing==
&lt;!--[without more context, this sentence is practically meaningless:] In computing the distinction of correspondence between a referent and a reference can be expressed by using descriptions.--&gt;
Considerations of [[reference (computer science)|references]] and their referents are sometimes of importance in [[computing]] and [[computer programming|programming]].&lt;ref&gt;Ėduard Viktorovich Popov ''Talking with computers in natural language'' - 1986 - 305 pages - The problem of correspondence between a referent and a reference can also be expressed using descriptions. This can be done as follows: When entities are encountered in a text, an understanding system (either human being or computer) ...&lt;/ref&gt; References play a role in the [[Perl]] programming language, for example, and the ''ref'' function is used to obtain the type of the referent of an [[Perl language structure#Objects|object]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://perldoc.perl.org/functions/ref.html ''ref''], perldoc.perl.org&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Saint Mary Magdalene''''' (French - ''Sainte Marie-Madeleine'') '''''Penitent Magdalene''''' (''Madeleine pénitente'') or '''''The Beautiful German Woman''''' (''La Belle Allemande'') is a painted wooden sculpture of [[Mary Magdalene]] by [[Gregor Erhart]] (died 1540) of the [[Ulm School]]. Probably originally intended for the church dedicated to the saint in the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] monastery in [[Augsburg]], it later became part of [[Siegfried Lämmle]]'s collection. The [[Louvre]] used art of a legacy from Émile Louis Sévène (née Laure Eugénie Declerck) to acquire it in 1902 and it was returned to the Louvre after being taken to Germany during the Nazi Occupation on the orders of [[Hermann Goering]].

Silwan began as a farming village, dating back to the [[7th century]] according to local traditions, while the earliest mention of the village is from the year 985. From the [[19th century]] onwards, the village was slowly being incorporated into Jerusalem until it became an urban neighborhood.

After the 1948 war, the village [[Jordanian annexation of the West Bank|fell under Jordanian rule]]. Jordanian rule lasted until the 1967 [[Six-Day War]], since which it has been [[Israeli-occupied territories|occupied by Israel]]. Silwan is administered as part of the [[Jerusalem Municipality]].

In 1980, Israel incorporated East Jerusalem (of which Silwan is a part) into its claimed capital city [[Jerusalem]] through the [[Jerusalem Law]], a [[basic law]] in Israel. The move is considered by the international community as [[International law and Israeli settlements|illegal under international law]],&lt;ref name="BBC_GC4"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/1682640.stm |title=The Geneva Convention |publisher=BBC News |date=10 December 2009 |accessdate=27 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the Israeli government disputes this. According to  [[Haaretz]], the Israeli government has worked closely with the right-wing settler organization [[Ateret Cohanim]] to evict Palestinians living on property whether classified formerly as [[heqdesh]] (property pledged to a temple) or not, especially in the Batan el-Hawa area of Silwan.&lt;ref name="Hasson2016" &gt;Nir Hasson, [http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-1.695731?date=1451862993096 'How Israel Helps Settler Group Move Jews Into East Jerusalem’s Silwan,'] [[Haaretz]] 6 January 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Depending on how the neighborhood is defined, the Palestinian residents in Silwan number 20,000 to 50,000 while there are about 500 to 2,800 Jews.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.breakingisraelnews.com/39071/jews-reclaim-synagogue-in-arab-neighborhood-in-jerusalem-after-80-years/#ITl3XHsRhfo8SCGj.97 Jewish Activists Reclaim Synagogue in Silwan]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesofisrael.com/in-tense-eastern-jerusalem-arabs-and-jews-hunker-down/ In tense eastern Jerusalem, Arabs and Jews hunker down]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
Historically, Silwan was located on the eastern slope of the [[Kidron Valley]], above the outlet of the [[Gihon Spring]] opposite the [[City of David]]. The villagers cultivated the arable land in the Kidron Valley, which in biblical tradition formed the king's gardens during the Davidic dynasty,&lt;ref&gt;[[Book of Jeremiah|Jer]]. 39:4;52:7; 2 [[Books of Kings|Kgs]].25:4; [[Book of Nehemiah|Neh]].3:15.

==History==
[[File:City of david2.jpg|thumb|250px|Housing in Silwan built over ancient Judean tombs]]

===Ancient period===
{{main|Silwan necropolis|Pool of Siloam|Jerusalem pilgrim road}}
In the ancient period, the area where the village stands was occupied by the [[Silwan necropolis|necropolis of the Biblical kingdom]].&lt;ref name=Ussishkin&gt;[http://www.tau.ac.il/humanities/archaeology/projects/proj_past_silwan.html]"Silwan, Jerusalem: The Survey of the Iron Age Necropolis," [[David Ussishkin]], Tel Aviv University webpage.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bible-history.com/isbe/S/SILOAM%3B+SILOAH%3B+SHELAH%3B+SHILOAH/ Bible Encyclopedia entry: Siloam] International Standard Bible Encyclopedia.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ussishkin70"/&gt;  In the valley below, according Bible,  "the waters of Shiloah go softly" (from the Gihon Spring) ({{bibleverse||Isaiah|8:6}}) and "the [[Pool of Siloam]]" ({{bibleverse||Nehemiah|3:15}}) to water [[King Solomon]]'s Royal Garden, later used as a staging area for Jewish pilgrims who, during the festivals of Passover, Shavuot and Sukkot, used the spring-fed [[Pool of Siloam]] to wash and ritually purify themselves before ascending the [[Jerusalem pilgrim road|Great Staircase to the Temple Mount]] while singing hymns based on Psalms. On [[Sukkot]] water was brought from the Pool of Siloam to the Temple and poured upon the altar (Suk iv 9) and the priests also drank of this water (Ab. R. N. xxxv).

The [[necropolis]], or ancient cemetery, is an archaeological site of major significance. It contains fifty rock-cut tombs of distinguished calibre, assumed to be the burial places of the highest-ranking officials of the Judean kingdom.&lt;ref name=Ussishkin/&gt; Tomb inscriptions are in Hebrew.&lt;ref name=Ussishkin/&gt; The "most famous" of the ancient [[rock-cut tombs]] in Silwan is finely carved, the one known as the [[Monolith of Silwan|Tomb of Pharaoh's daughter]].&lt;ref name=Ussishkin/&gt; Another notable tomb, called the ''Tomb of the Royal Steward'' is now incorporated into a modern-period house.&lt;ref name=Ussishkin/&gt; The ancient inscription informs us that it is the final resting place of ""...yahu who is over the house."&lt;ref name=Ussishkin/&gt; The first part of the Hebrew name is effaced, but it refers to a Judean royal steward or chamberlain.&lt;ref name=Ussishkin/&gt; It is now in the collection of the [[British Museum]].&lt;ref name=Ussishkin/&gt;

All of the tombs were long since emptied, and their contents removed.&lt;ref name=Ussishkin/&gt; A great deal of destruction was done to the tombs over the centuries by quarrying and by their conversion for use as housing, both by monks in the Christian period, when some were used as churches, and later by Muslim villagers.&lt;ref name=Ussishkin70&gt;The Necropolis from the Time of the Kingdom of Judah at Silwan, Jerusalem, David Ussishkin, The Biblical Archaeologist, Vol. 33, No. 2 (May, 1970), pp. 33-46,&lt;/ref&gt; "When the Arab village was built; tombs were destroyed, incorporated
in houses or turned into water cisterns and sewage dumps."&lt;ref name=Ussishkin70/&gt;

===Medieval Arab period===
Local folklore dates Silwan to the arrival of the second [[Rashidun Caliphate|Rashidun]] caliph, [[Umar|Umar ibn al-Khattab]] from [[Arabia]]. According to one resident's version of the story, the Greeks were so impressed that the Caliph entered on foot while his servant rode on a camel that they presented him with the key to the city. The Caliph thereafter granted the wadi to "Khan Silowna," an agricultural community of cave dwellers living ancient [[Rock-cut tombs in ancient Israel|rock-cut tombs]] along the face of the eastern ridge.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;Jeffrey Yas.[http://www.jerusalemquarterly.org/ViewArticle.aspx?id=240 "(Re)designing the City of David: Landscape, Narrative and Archaeology in Silwan"]; ''Jerusalem Quarterly,'' Winter 2000, Issue 7&lt;/ref&gt;

In medieval Muslim tradition, the spring of Silwan (Ayn Silwan) was among the four most sacred water sources in the world. The others were [[Zamzam Well|Zamzam]] in [[Mecca]], Ayn Falus in [[Beisan]] and Ayn al-Baqar in [[Acre, Israel|Acre]].&lt;ref&gt;Sharon, 1997,  [https://books.google.com/books?id=j1rSzWgHMjoC&amp;pg=PA24  24]&lt;/ref&gt; Silwan is mentioned as "Sulwan" by the 10th-century [[Arab]] writer and traveller [[al-Muqaddasi]]. In 985 he noted that the village in the outskirts of Jerusalem and south of the village was ''′Ain Sulwan'' ("Spring of Siloam") which provided "fairly good water" that irrigated the large gardens that the third Rashidun [[caliph]], [[Uthman Ibn Affan|'Othman ibn 'Affan]], endowed as a ''[[waqf]]'' to the impoverished residents of Jerusalem. Al-Muqaddasi further wrote "It is said that on the [[Day of Arafa|Night of 'Arafat]] the water of the holy well Zamzam, at Makkah, comes underground to the water of the Spring (of Siloam). The people hold a festival here on that evening."&lt;ref&gt;Muk., 171. Quoted in le Strange, 1890, p. [https://archive.org/stream/palestineundermo00lestuoft#page/221/mode/1up 221]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ottoman era===
In 1596, Ayn Silwan appeared in [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Defter|tax registers]] as being in the ''[[Nahiya]]'' of Quds of the ''[[Liwa (Arabic)|Liwa]]'' of [[Al-Quds|Quds]], with  a population of 60 households, all [[Muslim]]. They paid  a total of 35,500 [[akçe]] in taxes, and all of the revenues went to a [[Waqf]].&lt;ref&gt;Hütteroth and  Abdulfattah, 1977, p. 114&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1834, during a large-scale [[Peasants' revolt in Palestine|peasants' rebellion]] against [[Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt|Ibrahim Pasha]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-242896/Jerusalem#320040.hook Jerusalem (Israel)&amp;nbsp;– Britannica Online Encyclopedia&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; thousands of rebels infiltrated Jerusalem through ancient underground sewage channels leading to the farm fields of the village of Silwan.&lt;ref&gt;''Jerusalem in the 19th Century: The Old City'' Yehoshua Ben-Arieh, Part II, Chapter One: Ottoman Rule, pp. 90, 109, Yad Ben Zvi Institute &amp; St. Martin's Press, New York, 1984&lt;/ref&gt; A traveler to Palestine in 1883, T. Skinner, wrote that the olive groves near Silwan were a gathering place for Muslims on Fridays.&lt;ref&gt;''Jerusalem in the 19th Century: The Old City'' Yehoshua Ben-Arieh, Part II, Chapter Two: The Muslim Community, p. 133, Yad Ben Zvi Institute &amp; St. Martin's Press, New York, 1984&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-1850s, the villagers of Silwan were paid £100 annually by the Jews in an effort to prevent the desecration of graves on the Mount of Olives.&lt;ref name="Har-El2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Menashe Har-El|title=Golden Jerusalem|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9Z2cFY9iGqgC&amp;pg=PA244|accessdate=14 October 2010|date=April 2004|publisher=Gefen Publishing House Ltd|isbn=978-965-229-254-4|page=244}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jewish visitors to the [[Western Wall]] were also required to pay a tax to the inhabitants of Silwan, which by 1863 was 10,000 [[Piastre]]s.&lt;ref name="Ye'or"&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Bat Ye'or|title=Islam and Dhimmitude: Where Civilizations Collide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n4kTdYgwQPkC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|year=2002|publisher=[[Fairleigh Dickinson University Press]]|isbn=978-0-8386-3942-9|page=86}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nineteenth-century travelers described the village as a robbers' lair.&lt;ref&gt;''This is Jerusalem'', Menashe Har-El, Jerusalem 1977, p.135&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles William Wilson|Charles Wilson]] wrote that "the houses and the streets of Siloam, if such they may be called, are filthy in the extreme.” Charles Warren depicted the population as a lawless set, credited with being "the most unscrupulous ruffians in Palestine.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://members.bib-arch.org/publication.asp?PubID=BSBA&amp;Volume=20&amp;Issue=3&amp;ArticleID=3 The Tombs of Silwan]&lt;/ref&gt;

An official Ottoman village list from about 1870 showed that Silwan had a total of 92 houses and a population of 240, though the population count included only men.&lt;ref&gt;Socin, 1879, p. [https://archive.org/stream/zeitschriftdesde01deut#page/161/mode/1up  161]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hartmann, 1883, p. [https://archive.org/stream/bub_gb_BZobAQAAIAAJ#page/n932/mode/1up  124] also  noted 92 houses&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1883,  the [[Palestine Exploration Fund]]'s ''Survey of Western Palestine'' described Silwan as a "village perched on a precipice and badly built of stone. The waters is brought from Ain Umm ed Deraj. There are numerous caves among and behind the houses, which are used as stables by the inhabitants."&lt;ref name=SWP30&gt;Conder and Kitchener, 1883,  SWP III,  p. [https://archive.org/stream/surveyofwesternp03conduoft#page/30/mode/1up  30]&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern settlement of the western ridge of the modern urban neighborhood of Silwan, called the City of David, began in 1873-1874, when the [[Meyuchas]] family moved out of the [[Old City (Jerusalem)|Old City]] to a new home on the ridge called the City of David.&lt;ref&gt;Yemin Moshe: The Story of a Jerusalem Neighborhood, Eliezer David Jaffe, Praeger, 1988, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kfar Hashiloach 1891.jpg|thumb|right|Housing units built on Silwan's barren hillside for poor Jews in the 1880s]]
In 1881–82, a group of Jews arrived from [[Yemen]] as a result of messianic fervor.&lt;ref name="Ariel"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nini"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nini|first=Yehuda|title=The Jews of the Yemen, 1800-1914|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-XSS35Ax7W0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|publisher=[[Taylor &amp; Francis]]|isbn=978-3-7186-5041-5|pages=205–207}}&lt;/ref&gt; The year had special meaning unto them, for which some thirty Yemenite Jewish families set out from Sana'a for the Holy Land.&lt;ref&gt;Based on a numerological interpretation of the biblical verse "I shall go up on the date palm [tree]" (Song of Songs 7:9), in which the numerical value of the Hebrew words "on the date palm" ({{Lang-he-n|'''בתמר'''}}) - 642 - corresponded to the Hebrew year 5642 [[anno mundi]] (1881/82), with the millennium being abbreviated, it was expounded to mean, "I shall go up (meaning, make the pilgrimage) in the year 642 of the sixth millennia.

Initially shunned by the Jews of the [[Old Yishuv]], who did not recognize them as Jews due to their dark complexions, unfamiliar customs, and strange pronunciation of Hebrew, they had to be given shelter by the Christians of the [[American Colony, Jerusalem|Swedish-American colony]], who called them [[Tribe of Gad|Gadites]].&lt;ref name="Ariel"&gt;{{cite book | author = Tudor Parfitt | title = The road to redemption: the Jews of the Yemen, 1900-1950 | series = Brill's series in Jewish Studies, vol 17 | publisher = Brill Academic Publishers | year = 1997 | page = 53}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nini|first=Yehuda|title=The Jews of the Yemen, 1800-1914|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-XSS35Ax7W0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|publisher=[[Taylor &amp; Francis]]|isbn=978-3-7186-5041-5|page=206}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Messianism, Holiness, Charisma, and Community: The American-Swedish Colony in Jerusalem, 1881–1933, Yaakov Ariel and Ruth Kark , ''Church History,'' Vol. 65, No. 4 (Dec., 1996), p. 645&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, to end their reliance on Christian charity, Jewish philanthropists purchased land in the Silwan valley to establish a neighborhood for them.

An early 20th-century travel guide writes: In the "village of Silwan, east of Kidron ... some of the fellah dwellings [are] old sepulchers hewn in the rocks. During late years a great extension of the village southward has sprung up, owing to the settlement here of a colony of poor Jews from Yemen, etc. many of whom have built homes on the steep hillside just above and east of Bir Eyyub."&lt;ref&gt;''Cook's Handbook for Palestine and Syria'', Thomas Cook Ltd., 1907, p. 105&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1896 the population of  Silwan  was estimated to be about 939 persons.&lt;ref&gt;Schick, 1896, p.  [https://archive.org/stream/zeitschriftdesde19deut#page/n228/mode/1up  121]&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1910, the Yemenite Jewish community in Jerusalem and in Silwan purchased on credit a parcel of ground on the [[Mount of Olives]] for burying their dead, through the good agencies of [[Albert Antébi]] and with the assistance of the philanthropist, [[Edmond James de Rothschild|Baron Edmond Rothschild]]. The next year, the community was coerced into buying its adjacent property, by insistence of the ''[[Mukhtar]]'' (headman) of the village Silwan, and which considerably added to their holdings.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Avraham Al-Naddaf|Zekhor Le'Avraham]]'', Shelomo al-Naddaf (ed.

[[File:Silwan 1948.jpg|thumb|Silwan 1948]]

The British Mandatory government began annexing parts of Silwan to the Jerusalem Municipality, a process completed by the final Jordanian annexation of remaining Silwan in 1952.

[[File:View to Silwan and Wall.jpg|thumb|right|Silwan from [[Abu Tor]], looking towards the [[Israeli West Bank barrier|separation barrier]] near the Old City]]
In the twentieth century, Silwan grew northward towards Jerusalem, expanding from a small farming village into an urban neighborhood. Modern Arab Silwan encompasses Old Silwan (generally to the south), the Yemenite village (to the north), and the once-vacant land between. Today Silwan follows the ridge of the southern peak of the [[Mount of Olives]] to the east of the Kidron Valley, from the [[City of David|ridge west]] of the [[Ophel]] up to the [[southern wall]] of the [[Temple Mount]]/[[Haram al-Sharif]].

In the [[Village Statistics, 1945|1945 statistics]]  the population of Silwan was 3,820; 3,680  Muslims and 140 Christians,&lt;ref name=1945p25&gt;Department of Statistics, 1945, p. [http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/yabber/census/VSpages/VS1945_p25.jpg   25]&lt;/ref&gt;  with a total of  5,421 [[dunam]]s of land according to an official land and population survey.&lt;ref&gt;Government of Palestine, Department of Statistics.

===Jordanian era===
After the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]], Silwan was annexed by [[Jordan]] along with the rest of the West Bank. Jewish-owned land in Silwan came under control of the Jordanian "guardian of enemy properties."&lt;ref name="Fischbach"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fischbach|first=Michael R.|title=State, Society, and Land in Jordan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_WAgDMWsyb8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|year=2000|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|isbn=978-90-04-11912-3|page=193}}&lt;/ref&gt; It remained under Jordanian occupation until 1967, when Israel captured the Old City and surrounding region. Until then, the village had delegates in the Jerusalem City Council.

===Israeli control===
After the 1967 [[Six-Day War]] Silwan has been under Israeli occupation,  and Jewish organizations have sought to re-establish a Jewish presence there.

In 1987, the Permanent Representative of Jordan to the United Nations wrote to the Secretary-General to inform him of Israeli settlement activity; his letter noted that an Israeli company had taken over two Palestinian houses in the neighborhood of al-Bustan, also called [[King's Garden (Jerusalem)|King's Garden]], after evicting their occupants, claiming the houses were its property.&lt;ref&gt;[http://domino.un.org/unispal.NSF/3822b5e39951876a85256b6e0058a478/44ddc2496c28e0af052567f400544c98!OpenDocument "Letter dated 16 October 1987 from the Permanent Representative of Jordan to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General"]{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} UN General Assembly Security Council&lt;/ref&gt; City of David (Wadi Hilweh), an area of Silwan close to the southern wall of the Old City, and its neighborhood of al-Bustan, has been ever since a focus of Jewish settlement.

The [[Ir David Foundation]] and the [[Ateret Cohanim]] organizations are promoting resettlement of Jews in the neighborhood in cooperation with the Committee for the Renewal of the Yemenite Village in Shiloah.&lt;ref name="Bronner"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=411060 11 Jewish families move into J'lem neighborhood of Silwan&amp;nbsp;– Haaretz&amp;nbsp;– Israel News&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/feb/26/diggingintotrouble The Guardian]&lt;/ref&gt;

The City of David (Hebrew: ''Ir David''), an archeological site believed to be the original site of Jerusalem, is located within Silwan.&lt;ref name="Bronner"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/may/01/archaeologistsforhire|title=Archaeologists for hire|last=Bronner|first=Yigal|date=1 May 2008|publisher=[[The Guardian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Silwan (East)====
In 2003, Ateret Cohanim built a seven-storey apartment building known as [[Beit Yonatan]] (named for [[Jonathan Pollard]]) without a permit. In 2007, the courts ordered the eviction of the residents,&lt;ref&gt;Meron Rapoport [http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/869813.html "The battle over settling Silwan simmers"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012071954/http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/869813.html |date=2008-10-12 }} Haaretz, June 12, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; but the building was approved retroactively.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/Flash.aspx/134748 "Jerusalem Approves ‘Beit Yehonatan’ in Shiloach"] Arutz Sheva, October 15, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 a plan was submitted for a building complex including a synagogue, 10 apartments, a kindergarten, a library and underground parking for 100 cars in a location 200 meters from the Old City walls.&lt;ref&gt;Akiva Eldar.[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/983289.html "Plan to put synagogue in heart of East Jerusalem likely to be approved"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517151903/http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/983289.html |date=2008-05-17 }}; Haaretz, May 20, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2014, the Ir David Foundation helped Jews move into 25 apartments in 7 different buildings in Silwan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/news/israel/.premium-1.618470 Settlers move into 25 East Jerusalem homes, marking biggest influx in decades]&lt;/ref&gt;{{dubious|Article not clear to whether this happened in E or W Silwan.

====Palestinian cultural activities====
The Silwan Ta’azef Music School opened in October 2007. Since November 2007, an art program, language courses for women, men and children, leadership training for teenage girls, cooking classes, an embroidery club and swimming classes have opened in Silwan. In 2009, a local library was established. The Silwan theater group is led by a professional actress from Bethlehem.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.exedrajournal.com/docs/s-internationalization2/15.pdf The Silwan Ta'azef Music School in Silwan]&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these activities take place at the Madaa Silwan Creative Center.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.preludefund.org/silwan.html Prelude: Creating playgrounds in the Middle East] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110307010137/http://www.preludefund.org/silwan.html |date=2011-03-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demography==
The Statistical Yearbook of Jerusalem by the [[Jerusalem Institute for Israel Studies]] put the number of residents to 19,050 in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jiis.org.il/.upload/yearbook2014/shnaton_C1414.pdf|title=Table III/14 - Population of Jerusalem, by Age, Quarter, Sub-Quarter and Statistical Area, 2012|work=[[Jerusalem Institute for Israel Studies]]|date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Palestinian neighborhoods in Jerusalem are difficult to define, in contrast to the Jewish neighborhoods, because dense construction has blurred older boundaries and Silwan is now merged with [[Ras al-Amud]], [[Jabel Mukaber]] and [[Abu Tor]]. The Palestinian residents in Silwan number 20,000 to 50,000 while there are fewer than 700 Jews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/.premium-1.618734|title=East Jerusalem remains 'Arab' despite Jewish settlers, experts say|work=[[Haaretz]]|date=2 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jewish Settlements==
In 1991, a movement was formed to promote Jewish settlement in Silwan,&lt;ref&gt;[[John Quigley (academic)|John Quigley]], ''Flight Into the Maelstrom: Soviet Immigration to Israel and Middle East Peace,'' Ithaca Press, 1997 p.68.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

Overnight on 30 September 2014 at 1:30 am, settlers, supported by police officers and reportedly connected to the [[Ir David Foundation]], commonly known as Elad, entered 25 houses in 7 buildings which previously belonged to several Palestinian families in the neighborhood, in what was the largest Israeli purchase of homes in Silwan since 1986.&lt;ref name="Ynet50"&gt;[[Reuters]], [http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4576395,00.html 'Jewish settlers move into Palestinian homes in Old City's shadow'], [[Ynetnews]] 30 September 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Most were vacant, but in one house where a family was evicted a confrontation broke out.

Elad stated that the houses had been bought properly and legally.

White House spokesman [[Josh Earnest]], in a condemnation of the takeover, described the new occupants as "individuals who are associated with an organization whose agenda, by definition, stokes tensions between Israelis and Palestinians." Israeli prime minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] was "baffled" by US criticism, deeming it "un-American" to criticize the legal purchase of homes in East Jerusalem to either Jews or Arabs.&lt;ref name="Estrin" &gt;Daniel Estrin,[http://www.timesofisrael.com/sudden-apartment-takeovers-in-east-jerusalem-spark-anger/ 'Sudden apartment takeovers in east Jerusalem spark anger,'] [[The Times of Israel]] 3 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rabbis for Human Rights-North America, which changed its name to [[T'ruah]] in 2012 accused Elad of creating a "method of expelling citizens from their properties, appropriating public areas, enclosing these lands with fences and guards, and banning the entrance of the local residents...under the protection of a private security force."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.rhr-na.org/news/rhr-israel-defends-citizens-silwan |title=RHR statement |access-date=2008-06-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012172314/http://www.rhr-na.org/news/rhr-israel-defends-citizens-silwan |archive-date=2008-10-12 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 1,500 supporters of RHR-NA/T'ruah wrote to Russell Robinson,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jta.org/2012/03/01/news-opinion/opinion/op-ed-jnf-should-plant-trees-not-uproot-families]&lt;/ref&gt; CEO of JNF-US, to demand an end to the eviction of a Silwan family.

==Housing demolition and construction permits==
In 2005, the Israeli government planned to demolish 88 Arab homes in al-Bustan neighborhood built without permits&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1069913.html|publisher=Ha'aretz|title=Jerusalem demolitions may spark repeat of 1996 riots|date=2009-03-10|accessdate=2009-03-10|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090313045248/http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1069913.html|archivedate=2009-03-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but they were not found illegal in a municipal court.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060925041930/http://jmcc.org/new/05/jun/jeru.htm "Jerusalem Municipality plans to demolish 88 homes in Silwan"]; ''Al Ayyam Newspaper,'' June 1, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the State Comptroller's report, there were 130 illegal structures in Silwan in 2009, a tenfold increase since 1967. When enforcement of the building code began in al-Bustan in 1995, thirty illegal structures were found, mostly old residential buildings.&lt;ref name="jpost.com"&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/Israel/Article.aspx?id=191282&amp;R=R2 Illegal structures in Silwan multiply by ten in last 43 yrs]&lt;/ref&gt; By 2004, the number of illegal structures rose to 80. The municipality launched legal proceedings against 43 and demolished 10, but these were soon replaced by new buildings.&lt;ref name="jpost.com"/&gt;

The group [[Ir Amim]] argues that the illegal construction is due to insufficient granting of permits by the Jerusalem municipality. They say that under Israeli administration, fewer than 20 permits, mainly minor, were issued for this part of Silwan, and that as a result, most building in this part of Silwan and the whole neighborhood generally lack permits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ir-amim.org.il/Eng/?CategoryID=339&amp;ArticleID=919|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110823011617/http://www.ir-amim.org.il/Eng/?CategoryID=339&amp;ArticleID=919|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2011-08-23|publisher=[[Ir Amim]]|title=City of David- Silwan|first=|last=|date=|accessdate=2011-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also say that as of 2009, the vast majority of buildings in the neighborhood were built without permits, in particular in al-Bustan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ir-amim.org.il/sites/default/files/Silwanreporteng.pdf|title=Shady Dealings in Silwan|work=[[Ir Amim]]|date=May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, Ir Amim's petition to halt a municipal zoning plan for the City of David area was rejected. The plan does not call for demolition of illegal construction, but rather regulates where construction may continue. The group said that the plan favored the interests of Elad and the neighborhood's Jewish residents, while Elad said that the plan allotted only 15 percent of construction to Jews versus 85 percent to Arab residents. The [[mukhtar]] of Silwan objected to Ir Amim's petition against the plan. “We have said that there are good aspects of the plan and there are bad aspects of the plan, we’re still working it all out. But to come and say that the whole plan is bad, and to ask that it be done away with, then what have you accomplished? Nothing.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Israel/Article.aspx?id=170284 |publisher=[[Jerusalem Post]] |title=Court rejects NGO petition to halt Silwan planning scheme |first=Selig |last=Abe |date=2010-05-03 |accessdate=2011-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Silwan has expanded onto designated [[Open space reserve|greenspace]] on the floor of the Kidron Valley.

The ridge to the west of Silwan, known as the City of David, is believed to be the original [[Bronze Age]] and [[Iron Age]] site of Jerusalem.  Archaeological exploration began in the 19th century. Vacant during most of the Ottoman period, Jewish and Arab settlement began in the late 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;A photograph of the vacant ridge taken between 1853 and 1857 by James Grahm can be found on page 31 of ''Picturing Jerusalem; James Graham and Mendel Diness, Photographers, Israel Museum, Jerusalem, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Islamic-era skeletons discovered in the course of excavations have disappeared.&lt;ref&gt;Meron Rapaport.[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/988803.html "Islamic-era skeletons 'disappeared' from Elad-sponsored dig"] Haaretz, June 1, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; ElAd was accused of excavating on Palestinian property&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/964131.html Haaretz on Rabbis for Human Rights arrest]&lt;/ref&gt; and beginning its work on the City of David tunnels before receiving a permit from the Jerusalem Municipality.&lt;ref&gt;Meron Rapoport.[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/821774.html "City of David tunnel excavation proceeds without proper permit"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080419114651/http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/821774.html |date=2008-04-19 }}; ''Haaretz,'' February 5th, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, archaeologists unearthed under a parking lot a 2,000-year-old mansion that may have belonged to [[Queen Helene of Adiabene]]. The building includes storerooms, living quarters and ritual baths.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3479597,00.html Israeli archaeologists find 2,000-year-old mansion linked to historic queen]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tree wars: Olive groves===

In May 2010, a group of Israeli settlers torched "an 11-Dunam olive orchard in al-Rababa valley, in Silwan, south of the Old City of Jerusalem" which included the destruction of three olive trees that were over 300 years old.&lt;ref name=" IMEMC_2010"&gt;{{citation |first=Saed |last=Bannoura |url=http://www.imemc.org/article/58670 |title=Settler Torch Olive Orchard In Silwan |work=International Middle East Media Center |date=13 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2011 [[New York Times]] article, these attacks were called [[List of Israeli price tag attacks|"price tag" attacks.]]&lt;ref name="NYT_2011"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/04/world/middleeast/mosque-set-on-fire-in-northern-israel.html |title=Mosque Set on Fire in Northern Israel |date=3 October 2011 |first=Isabel |last=Kershner |accessdate=23 January 2015 |work=New York Times |location=Jerusalem}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar destruction of olive trees occurred in Jabal Jales (an area near Hebron) and in [[Huwara]].&lt;ref name="IBT_2014"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/battle-between-israel-palestine-being-fought-olive-fields-100-trees-torched-1471595 |title=Palestine: Jewish Settlers Torch 100 of World's Oldest Olive Trees |first=Tabatha |last=Kinder |date=24 October 2014 |accessdate=22 January 2015 |work=International Business News}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United Nations reported that by 2013, 11,000 olive trees owned by Palestinians in the occupied West Bank had been damaged or destroyed.&lt;ref name="Washington_Post_2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Washington_Post_2014"&gt;{{cite news |title=In West Bank, Palestinians gird for settler attacks on olive trees |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/in-west-bank-palestinians-gird-for-settler-attacks-on-olive-trees/2014/10/21/eb4f5096-54a8-11e4-892e-602188e70e9c_story.html |accessdate=23 January 2015 |first=William |last=Booth |date=22 October 2014 |location=Kfar Yassug, West Bank}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="United_Nations_2013"&gt;{{citation |work=United Nations Information System on the Question of Palestine (UNISPAL) |title=Nearly 11,000 Palestinian-owned trees damaged by Israeli settlers in 2013 |url=https://unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/6AFAE8EA35DC1DD085257C54005CB175#sthash.wYK54Pqs.dpuf |accessdate=23 January 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150122221356/http://unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/6AFAE8EA35DC1DD085257C54005CB175#sthash.wYK54Pqs.dpuf |archive-date=22 January 2015 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Washington Post, October 2014:

The '''''Solly Madonna''''' by the [[Italy|Italian]] [[renaissance]] artist [[Raphael]] was painted somewhere between 1500 and 1504.

An early work, it clearly shows the influence of Raphael's teacher [[Perugino]].&lt;ref name="Sociology, Religion and Grace"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pEh_AgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA267&amp;dq=%22Solly%20Madonna%22&amp;pg=PA267#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Solly%20Madonna%22&amp;f=false | title=Sociology, Religion and Grace | publisher=Routledge | author=Szakolczai, Arpad | year=2007 | isbn=9781134194506}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two motifs in this work would recur in later Madonnas by Raphael. The virgin Mary is reading a book, as in the [[Madonna and Child (Raphael, Pasadena)|Madonna and Child]] in the [[Norton Simon Museum]], the [[Connestabile Madonna]], the [[Madonna Colonna]] and the [[Madonna del cardellino]]. As in that last painting a small bird, a [[European goldfinch|goldfinch]], is part of the scene.&lt;ref name="Uffizi"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oNE3ofu8psMC&amp;lpg=PA420&amp;dq=%22Solly%20Madonna%22&amp;pg=PA420#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Solly%20Madonna%22&amp;f=false | title=Uffizi | publisher=Giunti Editore | author=Fossi, Gloria | year=2004 | isbn=9788809036765}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting is located in the [[Gemäldegalerie, Berlin]]. It is called the ''Solly Madonna'' because it was owned by the British banker and art collector [[Edward Solly]] (1776–1848).

[[File:GDL Statute.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Statute of [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]], written in [[Polish language|Polish]]]]
A '''statute''' is a formal written enactment of a [[legislature|legislative]] authority that governs a [[city]], [[State (polity)|state]], or [[country]].&lt;ref name=Blacks&gt;{{cite book
  | last =  Black
  | first = Henry Campbell
  | title = Black's Law Dictionary, Sixth Edition
  | publisher = [[West Publishing]] 
  | year = 1990
  | location = 
  | pages =1410 
  | isbn =0-314-76271-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, statutes command or prohibit something, or declare [[Public policy|policy]].&lt;ref name=Blacks/&gt; Statutes are rules made by legislative bodies; they are distinguished from [[case law]] or [[precedent]], which is decided by [[court]]s, and [[regulations]] issued by [[government agencies]].&lt;ref name=Blacks/&gt;

==Publication and organization==

In virtually all countries, newly enacted statutes are published in a [[Government gazette]] which is then distributed so that everyone can look up the statutory law.

A universal problem encountered by lawmakers throughout human history is how to organize published statutes. Such publications have a habit of starting small but growing rapidly over time, as new statutes are enacted in response to the exigencies of the moment. Eventually, persons trying to find the law are forced to sort through an enormous number of statutes enacted at various points in time to determine which portions are still in effect.
   
The solution adopted in many countries is to organize existing statutory law in topical arrangements (or [[Codification (law)|"codified"]]) within publications called [[Code (law)|codes]], then ensure that new statutes are consistently drafted so that they add, amend, repeal or move various code sections. In turn, in theory, the code will thenceforth reflect the current cumulative state of the statutory law in that jurisdiction.  In many nations [[statutory law]] is distinguished from and subordinate to [[constitutional law]].

==Alternative meanings==

===International law===
The term '''statute''' is also used to refer to an International [[treaty]] that establishes an [[institution]], such as the Statute of the [[European Central Bank]], a protocol to the international courts as well, such as the Statute of the [[International Court of Justice]] and the Rome Statute of the [[International Criminal Court]]. Statute is also another word for law. The term was adapted from England in about the 18th century.

===Autonomy statute===
In the [[Autonomous Communities of Spain]], the autonomy statute is a legal document similar to a state constitution in a [[federated state]]. The autonomies statutes in Spain have the rank of "Ley Organica", a category of special laws reserved only for the main institutions and issues and mentioned in the Constitution (the highest ranking legal instrument in Spain). Leyes Organicas rank between the Constitution and ordinary laws. The name was chosen, among others, to avoid confusion with the term Constitution (i.e. the Spanish Constitution of 1978).

==Religious statutes==

===Biblical terminology===
In biblical terminology,  statute (Hebrew ''chok'') refers to a law given without any reason or justification. The classic example is the statute regarding the [[Red Heifer]].(Numbers 19:2)

The opposite of a chok is a ''mishpat'', a law given for a specified reason, e.g. the [[Shabbat|Sabbath]] laws, which were given because "God created the world in six days, but on the seventh day He rested" ([[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 2:2-3).{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

===Dharma===
''That which upholds, supports or maintains [[Rta|the regulatory order of the universe]]'' meaning the ''Law'' or ''Natural Law''. This is a concept of central importance in [[Indian philosophy]] and [[Indian religions|religion]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2766">{{Place of articulation}}
'''Sulcalization''' (from Latin ''sulcus'', "groove"), in [[phonetics]], is the pronunciation of a sound, typically a [[sibilant consonant]], such as [[English language|English]] {{IPAslink|s}} and {{IPAslink|z}}, with a deep ''groove'' running along the back of the tongue that focuses the airstream on the teeth, producing a more intense sound. That is accomplished by raising the sides of the back of the tongue ("lateral contraction") and leaving a hollow along the mid-line. It is not clear if all sibilants are so ''grooved'': Catford (1977) observed that the degree of sulcalization differs between places of articulation as well as between languages, but no language is known to contrast a grooved and non-grooved sibilant. 

English {{IPA|[ɹ]}}, which allows various tongue positions without apparent distinction, may also receive its characteristic quality from being sulcal. 

In [[phonology]] and [[historical linguistics]], ''sulcalization'' is the development of such a groove in a non-sulcal consonant. For example, [[close vowel]]s trigger the effect in [[Japanese language|Japanese]], in which historic *''tu'' and *''ti'' have become {{IPA|[tsu]}} and {{IPA|[tɕi]}}, respectively. A similar sound changes as operated in the [[Senufo languages]]. (The [[palatalization (sound change)|palatalization]] of *''tsi'' to {{IPA|[tɕi]}} in Japanese is a different process and does not occur in Senufo.)

Vowels may also be sulcalized, which has been described as giving them a "throaty" sound (Jones 1967:82). The {{IPAslink|ɒ}} vowel of [[Received Pronunciation]], which is normally described as a [[rounded vowel|rounded]], is pronounced by some speakers without rounded lips for whom the characteristic quality is rather one of sulcality (Lass 1984:124).

One scholar has also suggested that the vowel in the RP pronunciation of words like ''bird'', typically transcribed {{IPAblink|ɜ}}, is actually a sulcal schwa, retaining the sulcality of the original rhotic consonant. Accordingly,  the realization of the {{IPA|/ə/}}-element of the centering diphthongs {{IPA|/ɪə, ʊə, ɛə/}} in words such as ''near'', ''pure'' and ''scare'', is interpreted as the product of a loss of sulcality (Erickson 2003:197).

"'''I-Feel-Like-I'm-Fixin'-to-Die Rag'''" is a song by the American [[psychedelic rock]] [[musical ensemble|band]] [[Country Joe and the Fish]], written by [[Country Joe McDonald]], and first released as the opening track on the [[extended play]] ''Rag Baby Talking Issue No. 1'', in October 1965 (''see'' [[1965 in music]]). "I-Feel-Like-I'm-Fixin'-to-Die Rag"{{'}}s [[dark humor]] and [[satire]] made it one of the most recognized protest songs [[Opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War|against the Vietnam War]]. Critics cite the composition as a classic of the [[counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture era]].

The song was usually preceded by "'''The Fish Cheer'''", a [[cheer]] spelling out "F-I-S-H".  An altered version of the cheer that was performed in live performances, known as "The Fuck Cheer", resulted in a television ban for Country Joe and the Fish in 1968, for the vulgarity, but was applauded by concert-goers.

"I-Feel-Like-I'm-Fixin'-to-Die Rag" saw a more commercial release on the group's second [[album]], ''[[I Feel Like I'm Fixin' to Die]]'', which was distributed in November 1967.  The song was a favorite among the [[hippie culture]], and was featured in McDonald's set list at the [[Woodstock Festival]] in 1969. Decades later, McDonald had a lawsuit filed against him for allegedly [[copyright infringement|infringing on the copyright]] of [[Kid Ory]]'s tune, "[[Muskrat Ramble]]". McDonald denied these allegations and the suit was later dismissed.

== History ==

===Composition and ''Rag Baby''===
Although the song achieved national notoriety when it was included on [[Country Joe and the Fish]]'s second [[album]], ''[[I Feel Like I'm Fixin' to Die]]'', it was first composed and  distributed two years prior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ci.berkeley.ca.us/vvm/about/joebio.html|title=Country Joe McDonald Biography|work=ci.berkley.ca.us|accessdate=June 24, 2015|author=Selvin, Joel}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1965, [[Country Joe McDonald]] founded and edited for a local [[counterculture]] magazine in Berkeley, California, which he called ''Rag Baby'' - a Bay Area adaptation of the [[folk music|folk]] magazine ''[[Broadside (magazine)|Broadside]]''. McDonald published four editions of the magazine, and sought to incorporate musical influences to support ''Rag Baby'''s [[left-wing]] message.&lt;ref name=rag&gt;{{cite web|title=''Collectors Items: The First Three EP's'' (CD booklet)|year=1994|publisher=One Way Records}}&lt;/ref&gt; To accomandate the issue, McDonald was inspired to distribute a "talking issue" of the magazine, an [[extended play]] called  ''Rag Baby Talking Issue No. 1''. In June 1965,  an early incarnation of Country Joe and the Fish recorded an acoustic version of "I-Feel-Like-I'm-Fixin'-to-Die Rag", the later debut album track, "Superbird", and two other songs by local folk musician, Peter Krug at [[Arhoolie Records]] Studios, under the guidance of [[record producer]] [[Chris Strachwitz]].&lt;ref name=well&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.well.com/~cjfish/bandbio.htm|title=A History|work=well.com|author=Belmont, Bill|accessdate=June 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to McDonald, the rag was written in under 30 minutes with a conscious purpose of reflecting on the escalation of [[The Vietnam War|the Vietnam conflict]], while he composed another song, "Who Am I", which was also relating to the US's increasing armed involvement.&lt;ref name=how&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.countryjoe.com/howrag.htm|title=How I Wrote the Rag|work=countryjoe.com|author=McDonald, Country Joe|accessdate=June 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 100 copies of the EP were pressed on McDonald's independent label and, were sold at Sproul Plaza in [[UC Berkeley]], during a [[Teach-in]], and in [[underground press|underground]] stores that stocked ''Rag Baby''.&lt;ref name=rag/&gt;

The song's lyrics are about placing blame on American politicians, high-level military officers, and industry corporations on starting the Vietnam War. McDonald composed "I-Feel-Like-I'm-Fixin'-to-Die Rag" in the summer of 1965, just as the U.S.'s military involvement was increasing, and was intensively opposed by the young generation.&lt;ref name=how/&gt; It expresses discontent towards the process of [[conscription]], through the use of [[dark humor]], and culminating in a reflection of [[casualties]] of the war, as hinted in the [[satirical]] invitation to "be the first one on your block, to have your son come home in a [[coffin|box]]". In addition, the song features a signature chorus:
{{bquote|And it's one, two, three, what are we fighting for?&lt;br /&gt;
Don't ask me I don't give a damn&lt;br /&gt;
Next stop is Vietnam.&lt;br /&gt;
And it's five, six, seven, open up the pearly gates,&lt;br /&gt;
Well there ain't no time to wonder why,&lt;br /&gt;
Whoopie! We're all gonna die!}}

The album version concludes with the uttering of several light machine guns firing and a final explosion, evoking the dropping of another [[atomic bomb]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''I Feel Like I'm Fixin' to Die'' (CD booklet)|year=2013|publisher=Ace Vanguard Masters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Album version and "The Fuck Cheer"===
After a brief stint performing as a duo in Berkley, McDonald and Melton recruited more members and eventually signed a recording contract with [[Vanguard Records]] in December 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.countryjoe.com/cjmbio.htm|title=Country Joe McDonald|work=countryjoe.com|accessdate=June 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inspired by the live performances of [[Bob Dylan]] and [[The Paul Butterfield Blues Band]], the group became fully intertwined in [[electronic rock]], and recorded a new electrified version of "I-Feel-Like-I'm-Fixin'-to-Die Rag" in Sierra Sound Laboratories, in February 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://psychedelicbaby.blogspot.com/2015/02/country-joe-and-fish-interview-with-joe.html?m=1|title=Country Joe and the Fish interview with Joe McDonald|publisher=Psychedelic Baby Magazine|accessdate=June 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aw6kSkR3eXgC&amp;pg=PA26&amp;dq=country+joe+and+the+fish+i+feel+like+i'm+fixin+to+die&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=YReTVeSUFYH0-AH27r-QDg&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=country%20joe%20and%20the%20fish%20i%20feel%20like%20i'm%20fixin%20to%20die&amp;f=false|author=Unterberger, Richie|year=2003|title=''Eight Miles High: Folk-rock's Flight from Haight-Ashbury to Woodstock''|publisher=Backbeat Books|page=27|isbn=0879307439}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, the song was going to be featured on Country Joe and the Fish's debut [[album]], ''[[Electric Music for the Mind and Body]]'', but record producer [[Sam Charters]] insisted that the track remain off the record. When the controversial composition, "Superbird", was not banned from airplay, "I-Feel-Like-I'm-Fixin'-to-Die Rag" was placed as the opening to their second album, ''I Feel Like I'm Fixin' to Die''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/country-joe-the-fish-mn0000128266|title=Country Joe and the Fish - Biography|work=allmusic.com|author=Eder, Bruce|accessdate=June 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/i-feel-like-im-fixin-to-die-mw0000195025|title=I Feel Like I'm Fixin' to Die - Review|author=Unterberger, Richie|work=allmusic.com|accessdate=June 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The song was a popular attraction in the band's live performance, and, in the summer of 1968, the first instance of slightly altered version known as "The Fuck Cheer" appeared in New York City at the Shaefer Summer Music Festival, among a crowd of nearly 10,000. [[Drummer]] [[Gary "Chicken" Hirsh]] suggested that the opening chorus spell out "[[fuck]]", which was positively received by younger listeners, and led to unexpected radio exposure of the album version on both alternative radio stations and [[AM radio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/chicken-hirsh-mn0000777148|title=Gary "Chicken" Hirsh - Biography|work=allmusic.com|author=Eder, Bruce|accessdate=June 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Hirsh has never  explained why he made the change, writer James E. Perone has speculated in his book ''Songs of the Vietnam Conflict'' that it was a "rebellious counterculture political act demonstrating free speech rights in the mid-1960s".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HHQqoUcbd8gC&amp;pg=PA40&amp;dq=country+joe+and+the+fish+the+fuck+cheer&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=GQOTVcOZFMv0-AGnvYygDQ&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=country%20joe%20and%20the%20fish%20the%20fuck%20cheer&amp;f=false|title=''Songs of the Vietnam Conflict''|author=Perone, James E.|page=40|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year=2001|isbn=0313315280}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, executives from ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' were present at the concert, and barred Country Joe and the Fish from their scheduled appearance and any future performances on the show.&lt;ref name=well/&gt;

===Woodstock performance===
On August 16, 1969, the second day of the [[Woodstock Festival]], McDonald made an unexpected solo performance of "The Fuck Cheer" at the conclusion of his set list, after [[Ritchie Havens]]. McDonald was augmented with a Yamaha FG 150 guitar that he found and holstered with a rope.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.countryjoe.com/woodxxx.htm|title=Woodstock 1969-1999|work=countryjoe.com|accessdate=July 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to McDonald, "I went on with my guitar and it was like 'Here is this guy who's going to sing' but no one paid any attention. I played 'Janis' and 'Tennessee Stud' and then I walked off the stage. I asked my tour manager if he thought it would be OK if I went back on and did the cheer and he said yeah. So I went "Give me an F!", and they all yelled "F!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/feel-like-im-fixin-for-a-comeback-1159597.html|title=Feel Like I'm Fixin' For a Comeback...|author=Johnson, Phil|work=independent.co.uk|accessdate=July 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The audience receptively responded by cheering the "F-U-C-K" chant along with McDonald. The performance was featured on the [[Woodstock (film)|''Woodstock'' film]], which included sing-a-long lyrical subtitles of  "The Fuck Cheer".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hightimes.com/read/high-times-archives-country-joe-mcdonald-interview|title=Country Joe McDonald interview|work=hightimes.com|accessdate=July 2, 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150704101218/http://www.hightimes.com/read/high-times-archives-country-joe-mcdonald-interview|archivedate=July 4, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Copyright lawsuit===
In 2001, the heirs of New Orleans jazz trombonist [[Kid Ory]] launched a lawsuit against Country Joe McDonald, claiming that the music of "I-Feel-Like-I'm-Fixin'-to-Die Rag" constituted plagiarism of "[[Muskrat Ramble]]", a number by Ory,&lt;ref name=stealing&gt;{{cite web|title=Country Joe Sued For Stealing Protest Song|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/78072/country-joe-sued-for-stealing-protest-song|publisher=Billboard}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Country Joe McDonald Accused Of Ripping Off Jazz Great|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1449850/country-joe-sued-plagiarism.jhtml|publisher=MTV}}&lt;/ref&gt; recorded by [[Louis Armstrong and His Hot Five]] in 1926. In 2005, a court dismissed the suit, holding that the Ory estate had [[Statute of limitations|waited too long to make the claim]]. If the action had been successful Country Joe McDonald would have been required, under law, to pay $150,000 for each live performance of the song in the three years since the lawsuit was filed. McDonald would have also been barred from ever performing the song again without the possibility of further damages.&lt;ref name=stealing/&gt;

== Covers and features ==
[[Pete Seeger]] covered the song in 1970. There were initially plans to release his version as a single, and indeed some copies were sent out to DJs, but according to Seeger, distributors refused to handle it, and it was never officially released. It eventually found its way onto the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.countryjoe.com/seeger.htm|title=Country Joe McDonald, the "Suppressed" Seeger recording|work=countryjoe.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also included as a bonus track on a reissue of his 1969 album ''Young vs. Old''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldwentdown.com/omni/omni125.php the omni recording corporation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120203133611/http://www.worldwentdown.com/omni/omni125.php |date=February 3, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

McDonald performed part of the song while playing a folksinging hippie named "Joaquin" in the [[Tales of the City (1993 miniseries)|''Tales of the City'' TV miniseries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106148/|title=Armistead Maupin's Tales of the City (TV Mini-Series 1993)|work=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The song was regularly broadcast into [[Hỏa Lò Prison|Hỏa Lò Prison (the "Hanoi Hilton")]], in [[North Vietnam]], to American [[prisoners of war]] by their captors. The prisoners later reported it actually boosted their morale as they sang along.&lt;ref&gt;"Patriots": the Vietnam War Remembered from All Sides", Christian G. Appy, p. 198&lt;/ref&gt;

The Passion Killers, comprising several members of the band [[Chumbawamba]], covered the song with modified lyrics on their 1991 single, "Whoopee! We're All Gonna Die!", as a protest against the [[first Gulf War]].&lt;ref name=howrag&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.countryjoe.com/howrag.htm|title=Country Joe McDonald, How I Wrote the Rag|work=countryjoe.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/TheTropics/Cabana/7272/discog.html&amp;date=2009-10-25+11:21:17 Chumbawamba Discography] &lt;/ref&gt;

[[Eugene Chadbourne]] released a rewritten version entitled "Feel Like I'm Fixin' to Die (Iraq)" on his 1991 7" single ''Oil of Hate''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Chadbourne|first1=Eugene|title=Oil Of Hate|url=https://www.discogs.com/Eugene-Chadbourne-Oil-Of-Hate/release/919337|website=Discogs|accessdate=13 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Japanese band [[Seiichi_Yamamoto#with_Omoide_Hatoba|Omoide Hatoba]] included a 40-second-long cover on their 1992 album ''Black Hawaii'', with the title reading "I-Feel-Like-I'm-Fix-in-to-Die Rag." Sung by [[Public Bath Records]]' David Hopkins, it consists of the intro, first verse, chorus, and the chorus starting to repeat when [[Seiichi Yamamoto]] cuts it off by shouting "Next!"

Swedish rock singer {{Interlanguage link multi|Svante Karlsson|sv}} covered it in 2003 on his album ''Autograph''. This version features a solo performed by legendary guitarist [[Albert Lee]].

The song has been featured in the films ''[[Woodstock (film)|Woodstock]]'' (1970), ''[[More American Graffiti]]'' (1979), ''[[Purple Haze (film)|Purple Haze]]'' (1982), and ''[[Hamburger Hill]]'' (1987), and the HBO miniseries ''[[Generation Kill (TV series)|Generation Kill]]'' (2008). It was also featured in the TV show ''[[The Wonder Years]]'', in the season 2 episode, titled "Walk Out" (1989).

It was referenced on the 2008 edition of the [[AP United States History]] exam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apcentral.collegeboard.com/apc/public/repository/ap08_us_hist_frq.pdf|format=PDF|title=Repository|website=apcentral.collegeboard.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Compleat Housewife, or, Accomplish'd Gentlewoman's Companion''''' is a [[cookery book]] written by [[Eliza Smith]] and first published in [[London]] in 1727. It became extremely popular, running through 18 editions in fifty years.

It was the first cookery book to be published in the [[Thirteen Colonies]] of America: it was printed in [[Williamsburg, Virginia]], in 1742. It contained the first published recipe for "[[ketchup|katchup]]", and appears to be the earliest source for [[bread and butter pudding]].

The book includes recipes not only for foods but for wines, cordial-waters, medicines and salves.

==Book==

The title page describes ''The Compleat Housewife'' as a

{{quote|collection of several hundred of the most approved receipts, in cookery, pastry, confectionery, preserving, pickles, cakes, creams, jellies, made wines, cordials. And also bills of fare for every month of the year. To which is added, a collection of nearly two hundred family receipts of medicines; viz. drinks, syrups, salves, ointments, and many other things of sovereign and approved efficacy in most distempers, pains, aches, wounds, sores, etc. never before made publick in these parts; fit either for private families, or such publick-spirited gentlewomen as would be beneficent to their poor neighbours.}}

The book was the first to publish a recipe for "[[ketchup|Katchup]]"; it included mushrooms, anchovies and horseradish.&lt;ref name=JASNA/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smith, 1739. Page 91.&lt;/ref&gt; The title ''The Compleat Housewife'' may owe something to [[Gervase Markham]]'s 1615 ''[[The English Huswife]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Appelbaum |first1=Robert |title=Rhetoric and Epistemology in Early Printed Recipe Collections |journal=Journal for Early Modern Cultural Studies |date=2003 |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=1–35 |jstor=27793766}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Little is known of Smith beyond what she writes of herself in the preface. She spent her life working as a cook or housekeeper in wealthy households, and unlike [[Elizabeth Raffald]] who left service to run her own shop, continued in that profession despite the success of her book. It is possible that she worked at [[Beaulieu Abbey]], Hampshire. She is critical of cookery books written by men who conceal their secrets, preventing readers from using their recipes successfully.&lt;ref name=JASNA/&gt;&lt;ref name=CT&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Robbins |first1=Jean |title=Understanding Women's Lives through their Cookbooks |url=http://spec.lib.vt.edu/culinary/CulinaryThymes/2005_07/cookbooks.html |publisher=Culinary Thymes |volume=7 |issue=Winter 2005 |accessdate=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Badley |first1=Jocelyn |title=Compleat Housewife, The; Or, Accomplish'd Gentlewoman's Companion |url=http://www.crcstudio.org/conf_exhibit/Pages/viewtext.php?tid=17&amp;route=browseby.php&amp;start=64&amp;by=year |website=Women Writing and Reading |publisher=CRC Studio |accessdate=26 March 2015 |date=1 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The preface contains the following passage:

{{quote|It being grown as fashionable for a book now to appear in public without a preface, as for a lady to appear at a ball without a hoop-petticoat, I shall conform to the custom for fashion-sake and not through any necessity. The subject being both common and universal, needs no argument to introduce it, and being so necessary for the gratification of the appetite, stands in need of no encomiums to allure persons to the practice of it; since there are but a few nowadays who love not good eating and drinking}}

The passage was lightly adapted from an earlier book with a similar title, John Nott's ''[[The Cooks and Confectioners Dictionary|The Cooks and Confectioners Dictionary: or, the Accomplish’d Housewife’s Companion]]'' (1723), which declared he had added an introduction because fashion had made it as odd for a book to be printed without one as for a man to be seen "in church without a neck cloth or a lady without a hoop-petticoat."&lt;ref name=Yost/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Nott |first1=John |title= The cooks and confectioners dictionary; or, The accomplish'd housewifes companion |date=1723 |publisher=C.

===Approach===
Smith offers no general advice, either at the start of the book or at the start of chapters; each chapter consists entirely of recipes. There are no lists of ingredients, these simply being mentioned as needed in the recipes. Most recipes do not mention either oven temperature or cooking time, though for example "To candy Orange Flowers" instructs "set your glasses in a stove with a moderate heat",&lt;ref&gt;Smith, 1739. Page 206.&lt;/ref&gt; and "To Stew a Rump of Beef" states "this requires six or seven hours stewing."&lt;ref&gt;Smith, 1739. Pages 6–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

The recipes are predominantly English, but dishes include French and other foreign names, and imported ingredients such as spices.

Recipes are described tersely, and do not generally spell out basic techniques such as how to make pastry; the recipe for "A [[Battalia pie|Battalia Pye]]"{{efn|The name means a pie filled with ''beatilles'', small blessed objects (Latin ''beatus'', blessed) such as, according to the [[Oxford English Dictionary]], "Cocks-combs, Goose-gibbets, Ghizzards, Livers, and other Appurtenances of Fowls (1706)". It is not connected with Italian ''battaglia'', battle.}} does not mention pastry at all, though it is called for with the instruction to "close the pye":&lt;ref name=Smith10&gt;Smith, 1739. Page 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|'''''A Battalia Pye'''''&lt;br&gt;Take four small chickens, four squab pigeons, four sucking [[rabbit|rabbet]]s; cut them in pieces, season them with savoury spice, and lay 'em in the pye, with four [[sweetbreads]] sliced, and as many sheep's [[tongue]]s, two shiver'd palates,{{efn|Bones were cooked to add flavour and to release [[gelatine]].}} two pair of [[testicle|lamb-stones]], twenty or thirty [[comb (anatomy)|coxcomb]]s, with savoury balls and [[oyster]]s. Lay on butter, and close the pye. A Lear.&lt;ref name=Smith10/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=An Now For Something Completely Different: The British Tradition of The Savory Pie |url=http://www.britishfoodinamerica.com/A-Number-of-Savory-Pies-for-Fall/the-lyrical/An-Now-For-Something-Completely-Different-The-British-Tradition-of-The-Savory-Pie/#.VRQA8eHtjgw |journal=The Lyrical | volume=44 | issue=Spring 2015 |accessdate=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

However, a few frequently-used components of dishes are described, such as "A Lear for Savoury Pyes" and "A Ragoo for made Dishes". The "Lear" is a thickened sauce made with [[claret]], gravy, "oyster liquor", anchovies, herbs, onion and butter. The "Ragoo" contains similar ingredients, with the addition of sliced meats and mushrooms; the recipe ends with "use it when called for", such as in the Battalia Pye.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, 1739. Page 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Eliza Smith The Compleat Housewife 1739 To Promote Breeding.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4&lt;!--size for small print sample--&gt;|Recipe "To Promote Breeding"]]
Recipes are provided for home-made medicines and remedies such as "To promote Breeding" for women wanting to become [[pregnant]]. The recipe calls for a spoonful of "stinking orrice"{{efn|Stinking iris, ''[[Iris foetidissima]]''.}} syrup to be taken night and morning, and for "good ale" to be boiled with "the piths of 3 ox-backs,{{efn|[[Spinal cord]]s.}} half a handful of clary, a handful of nep (or cat-bos)",{{efn|Common catnip, ''[[Nepeta cataria]]'' or catmint, ''[[Nepeta mussinii]]''.}} dates, raisins, and nutmegs. The woman drinking this mixture "at your going to-bed" is enjoined "as long as it lasts, accompany not with your husband."&lt;ref&gt;Smith, 1739. Page 258.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication==

===Britain===
The book was first published in 1727 and ran through 18 editions by 1773.&lt;ref name=UPENN&gt;{{cite web |title=The compleat housewife; or, Accomplish'd gentlewoman's companion ... |url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/compleat-housewife-or-accomplishd-gentlewomans-companion/oclc/2884903 |publisher=WorldCat |accessdate=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first four editions were published under the byline "E— S—", but Smith did reveal she was a woman "constantly employed in fashionable and noble Families ... for the Space of thirty Years and upwards".&lt;ref name=UPENN/&gt; The fifth edition of 1732 gave the author's name as "E. Smith".&lt;ref name=Spedding&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Spedding |first1=Patrick |title=To (not) Promote Breeding: Censoring Eliza Smith's Compleat Housewife (1727) |journal=Script &amp; Print | volume=31 | issue=4 | pages=233–242 |url=http://www.bsanz.org/download/script-and-print/script_&amp;_print_vol._31_no._4_%282007%29/SP_2007_Vol31_No4_pp233-242.pdf |publisher=BSANZ |accessdate=26 March 2015 |date=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bibliographer [[William Carew Hazlitt]] recorded that the 7th edition included "near fifty Receipts being communicated just before the author's death".&lt;ref&gt;Hazlitt, William Carew. ''[[s:Old Cookery Books and Ancient Cuisine/Cookery Books, part 4|Old Cookery Books and Ancient Cuisine/Cookery Books, part 4]]'', 1902.&lt;/ref&gt;

===America===
''The Compleat Housewife'' was the first cookery book to be published in America, when [[William Parks (publisher)|William Parks]], an ambitious and enterprising printer (originally from [[Shropshire]]) printed it in [[Williamsburg, Virginia]] in 1742.&lt;ref name=Yost/&gt;&lt;ref name=UPenn&gt;{{cite web |title=HOUSEHOLD WORDS: Women Write from and for the Kitchen |url=http://www.library.upenn.edu/exhibits/rbm/aresty/007.html |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Library |accessdate=28 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; His version of ''The Compleat Housewife'', a "cookery book of ambitious scope", was based on the fifth London edition of 1732, altered to suit American taste, and without recipes "the ingredients or materials for which are not to be had in this country."&lt;ref name=MSU&gt;{{cite web | author=Longone, Jan | url=http://digital.lib.msu.edu/projects/cookbooks/html/intro_essay.html | title=Feeding America | accessdate=28 March 2015 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150816044847/http://digital.lib.msu.edu/projects/cookbooks/html/intro_essay.html | archive-date=2015-08-16 | dead-url=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Copies of the 1742 edition have become very rare, but "happily, one copy has returned to the city of its origin", and is in the Library of Colonial Williamsburg, Incorporated.&lt;ref name=Yost/&gt;

==Reception==

In 1893, the bibliographer [[William Carew Hazlitt]] allocated 54 pages of his history of cookery books to the ''Compleat Housewife'', commenting that "the highly curious contents of E. Smith ... may be securely taken to exhibit the state of knowledge in England upon this subject in the last quarter of the seventeenth and the first quarter of the eighteenth [century]".&lt;ref name=Yost&gt;{{cite journal| author=Yost, Genevieve |title=The Compleat Housewife or Accomplish'd Gentlewoman's Companion. A Bibliographical Study |journal=William and Mary Quarterly |volume=18 | year=1938 |pages=419–435 |jstor=1922976 |doi=10.2307/1922976}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hazlitt&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hazlitt |first1=W. C. |title=Old Cookery Books and Ancient Cuisine |date=1893 |publisher=Stock |location=London |pages=99–153}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christine Mitchell, reviewing the Chawton House reprint in 2010 for the Jane Austen Society of North America,  wrote that Eliza Smith's book "met the growing need for a text to assist women with their task of maintaining a household." She quotes Elizabeth Wallace's introduction as saying that it gives modern readers reason to appreciate having a refrigerator and a global food system that brings us out-of-season produce. Yet, she observes, the English housewife had many varieties of vegetables, 30 kinds of seafood and 35 kinds of poultry (including hares and rabbits). She notes that the book also describes home remedies, the housewife having to function as " chef, doctor, pharmacist, exterminator, chemist, laundress, and all-around handy-woman." Reflecting that the recipes would "probably never" be used today, and the medicines are useless, the book remains invaluable for researchers, gives readers a glimpse into the world of [[Jane Austen]] and her contemporaries, and richly documents eighteenth-century English life.&lt;ref name=JASNA&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mitchell |first1=Christine M. |title=Book Review: The Handy Homemaker, Eighteenth-Century Style |url=http://www.jasna.org/bookrev/br261p22.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101010004203/http://jasna.org/bookrev/br261p22.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=10 October 2010 |journal=JASNA News |issue=Spring 2010 |accessdate=26 March 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Patrick Spedding, in ''Script &amp; Print'', notes that the book was very popular in the eighteenth century, with 20 London editions in fifty years. However, he roundly criticises the 1983 Arlon House facsimile reprint of the 16th edition for deliberately omitting recipes including "To promote Breeding", suggesting this was because the publisher was concerned they might be harmful.&lt;ref name=Spedding/&gt;

The historian Sandra Sherman comments that ''The Compleat Housewife'' "is the first female-authored blockbuster."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sherman |first1=Sandra |title=Invention of the Modern Cookbook| publisher=ABC-Clio| url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/126710932/Sandra-Sherman-Invention-of-the-Modern-Cookbook-2010#scribd |accessdate=28 March 2015 |date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bibliographer Genevieve Yost comments that "E. Smith's popularity in eighteenth century England was challenged perhaps most seriously by [[Hannah Glasse]], who admittedly is better remembered today",&lt;ref name=Yost/&gt; adding at once that Glasse is recalled mainly for the controversy over whether she actually existed, and for the recipe that people supposed started with "First catch your hare."&lt;ref name=Yost/&gt; Yost suggests that the book's popularity in the colonies was probably increased by the publication of an American edition.&lt;ref name=Yost/&gt; She concludes that

{{quote|The quantities and ingredients render many of the recipes unsuitable to the modern kitchen, but these old cookbooks are increasing in value and interest to libraries, bibliophiles, and collectors, who find in them a truly revealing and fascinating glimpse of the past.&lt;ref name=Yost/&gt;&lt;!--these brackets close quote--&gt;}}&lt;!--quote closed--&gt;

1n the Spring 2006 issue of ''[[Prairie Schooner]]'', [[Sarah Kennedy (poet)|Sarah Kennedy]] published a poem called "The Compleat Housewife, 1727", with the gloss "the first popular cookbook published in Great Britain". The poem begins:

{{quote|Learning to thigh a pigeon or tame a crab&lt;br&gt;was now within any woman's grasp,&lt;br&gt;even a maid could be taught to carve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kennedy |first1=Sarah |title=The Compleat Housewife, 1727 |journal=Prairie Schooner |date=2006 |volume=80 |issue=1 |pages=43–44 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/ |doi=10.1353/psg.2006.0075 }}{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''''The Mays Literary Anthology''''' (or just '''''The Mays''''') is an anthology of new writing by students from the [[University of Oxford]] and the [[University of Cambridge]]. In 1992, when Peter Ho Davies, Adrian Woolfson, and Ron Dimant came up with the original concept for the ''Mays'', the publication was split into two separate anthologies; one devoted to prose and the other to poetry. In 2003 the ''Mays'' became a single publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Mays XIX|url=http://themaysxix.tumblr.com/about|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110830224605/http://themaysxix.tumblr.com/about|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2011-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each year, the ''Mays'' receives hundreds of submissions from students at Oxford and Cambridge.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} In 2006 the ''Mays'' received a record 1,100 entries. The Editorial Committee (composed of students from both universities) review the submissions during Lent Term.

''The Mays'' is broader in scope than most university literary projects: it is sold in bookstores and by delivery nationwide; it is distributed to every major literary agent; and each year a guest editor — usually a prominent author, poet, or artist — writes an introduction to the anthology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Mays XIX|url=http://themaysxix.tumblr.com/about|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110830224605/http://themaysxix.tumblr.com/about|dead-url=yes|archive-date=30 August 2011|accessdate=7 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previous guest editors include: [[Margaret Drabble]] and [[Jon Stallworthy]] (1992), [[Michael Dibdin]] and [[Seamus Heaney]] (1993), [[Stephen Fry]] (1994), [[Ted Hughes]] (1995), [[Penelope Fitzgerald]] (1996), [[Christopher Reid]] and [[Jill Paton Walsh]] (1997), [[Sebastian Faulks]] and [[J.H. Prynne]] (1998), [[Penelope Lively]] and John Kinsella (1999), [[Paul Muldoon]] and [[Lawrence Norfolk]] (2000), [[Zadie Smith]] and [[Michael Donaghy]] (2001), [[Andrew Motion]] and [[Nick Cave]] (2002), [[Ali Smith]] (2003), [[Philip Pullman]] (2004), Robert Macfarlane (2005), [[Don Paterson]] and [[Jeanette Winterson]] (2006), [[Colm Toibin]] (2007), Ian Patterson (2008), [[Patti Smith]] (2009), [[Amit Chaudhuri]], [[Tom Raworth]] (2010), {{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}, [[Jarvis Cocker]] (2011), [[John Darnielle]], [[Tao Lin]], [[Toby Litt]] (2012), [[Michael Frayn]], [[David Harsent]], [[Tom Phillips (artist)|Tom Phillips]] (2013), [[John Fuller (poet)|John Fuller]], [[Paul Farley]], [[Ben Okri]], [[Prajwal Parajuly]], [[Emma Chichester Clark]] and [[Alexander Gilkes]] (2014), Roger Mcgough and Rupi Kaur (2016).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Mays XIX |url=http://themaysxix.tumblr.com/post/5744413958/poetry-jarvis-cocker-is-a-musician-actor-radio |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413124923/http://themaysxix.tumblr.com/post/5744413958/poetry-jarvis-cocker-is-a-musician-actor-radio |archivedate=2014-04-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Mays'' is often noted for launching the career of novelist [[Zadie Smith]].&lt;ref&gt;http://books.guardian.co.uk/review/story/0,12084,1560999,00.html "Learning Curve," ''The Guardian'', 3 September 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Her work appears in two of the short story editions (1996 and 1997). Literary agencies first took notice of Smith after seeing her story "Mrs. Begum’s Son and the Private Tutor" in the 1997 collection. Smith guest edited the ''Mays'' in 2001. Her quip "maybe in a few years this lot will have me out of a job" has become a catch phrase for the publication.

''The Mays'' is associated with Varsity Publications Ltd, which publishes ''[[Varsity (Cambridge)|Varsity]]''.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} The cost of publication is funded in part by donations from various Oxford and Cambridge colleges.

Sonneck was succeeded by a number of editors, including [[Carl Engel]] (1930-1944), [[Gustave Reese]] (1944-45), [[Paul Henry Lang]], who edited the journal for over 25 years, from 1945 to 1973, [[Joan Peyser]] (1977-84), [[Eric Salzman]] who served as editor from 1984 to 1991 and several others.

Since 1993 ''The Musical Quarterly'' has been edited by [[Leon Botstein]], president of [[Bard College]] and principal conductor of the [[American Symphony Orchestra]]. It is published by [[Oxford University Press]].

'''Topfreedom''' is a [[cultural movement|cultural]] and [[political movement]] seeking changes in laws to allow women to be [[toplessness|topless]] in public places where men are permitted to be [[barechested]], as a form of [[gender equality]]. Specifically, the movement seeks the repeal or overturning of laws which restrict a woman's right not to have her chest covered at all times in public.

In addition, topfreedom advocates seek allowing nursing mothers to openly [[breastfeeding in public|breastfeed in public]], and women to [[bathe]] topless.

==Social and legal attitudes==
{{See also|Indecent exposure|Public indecency}}

Many societies{{which|date=September 2015}} consider women who expose their nipples and areolae as [[modesty|immodest]] and contrary to [[social norms]]. In many jurisdictions{{which|date=September 2015}} a topless woman may be socially or officially harassed or cited for [[Lascivious|public lewdness]], [[indecent exposure]], [[public indecency]] or [[disorderly conduct]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.feministezine.com/feminist/toplessness004.html|title=Topfreedom: The Fundamental Right of Women|author=Suzanne MacNevin|date=|website=The Feminist eZine|accessdate=21 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Topfreedom advocates seek to change community attitudes to breasts as sex objects or indecent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.007b.com/topfreedom.php |title=What is Topfreedom? |publisher=007b.com |date=20 January 2013 |accessdate=12 August 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130120232359/http://www.007b.com/topfreedom.php |archive-date=20 January 2013|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several countries in [[Europe]] have decriminalised non-sexual toplessness. Topless swimming and sunbathing on beaches has become acceptable in many parts of Europe, though the practice remains controversial in many places, and not common in most places. Many public swimming pools in Europe are owned by municipalities, which are treated as private organisations and allowed to set their [[dress code]]s.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

===Breastfeeding===
{{main|Breastfeeding in public}}
In many countries around the world, [[breastfeeding in public]] is not unusual. During 2006–2010 and earlier, a number of news reports in the United States cited incidents where women were refused service or harassed for breastfeeding in public. In response, a majority of U.S. states have passed laws explicitly permitting nursing in public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncsl.org/IssuesResearch/Health/BreastfeedingLaws/tabid/14389/Default.aspx |title=Breastfeeding Laws |author= |date=March 2010 |website=Breastfeeding State Laws |publisher=NCSL |accessdate=14 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,200615,00.html |publisher=FOXNews.com |title=Indecent Exposure|first=Lis|last=Wiehl | date=2006-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.llli.org/llleaderweb/lv/lvjunjul05p51.html|title=Breastfeeding Legislation in the United States: A General Overview and Implications for Helping Mothers|author=|date=|website=|publisher=La Leche League International|accessdate=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070331220518/http://www.llli.org/llleaderweb/LV/LVJunJul05p51.html|archivedate=2007-03-31|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States federal government enacted a law in 1999&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=106_cong_public_laws&amp;docid=f:publ058.106 |title=Treasury and General Government Appropriations Act, 2000|accessdate=2010-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; which specifically provides that "a woman may breastfeed her child at any location in a Federal building or on Federal property, if the woman and her child are otherwise authorized to be present at the location." However, these laws generally do not apply to rules imposed by private organizations or on private property, such as restaurants, airlines, or shopping malls.

In [[Poland]] in 2008–2009, two women from [[Szczecin]] including [[glamour model]] [[Dorota Krzysztofek]],&lt;ref name="ckm"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ckm.pl/szukaj,Dorota%20Krzysztofek,2,3,0,1,1,sa.html | title=Dorota Krzysztofek | publisher=[[CKM (adult magazine)|CKM]] | website=Galerie | year=2012 | accessdate=July 22, 2012 | language=Polish | quote=[http://www.ckm.pl/dziewczyny/dorota-krzysztofek,80,img,1,gna.html  CKM photo session.]}}&lt;/ref&gt; won a court battle that reasserted the women's right to sunbathe topless on public beaches.&lt;ref name="pardon"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.pardon.pl/artykul/7705/sad_w_polsce_wolno_chodzic_topless | title=Sąd: w Polsce wolno chodzić topless!

The women refused to pay the fine and took the matter to [[Civil Court]]. Their first hearing had to be postponed due to remarkable media interest.&lt;ref name="wyborcza"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://wyborcza.pl/1,75248,5558277,W_obronie_topless_pojdzie_nawet_do_Strasburga.html | title=W obronie topless pójdzie nawet do Strasburga | publisher=[[Gazeta Wyborcza]], [[Szczecin]] | website=Artykuły | date=August 6, 2008 | accessdate=July 22, 2012 | author=Andrzej Kulej | language=Polish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 7, 2008, judge Szczepańska upheld the city staff decision, and charged the women with indecent exposure, explaining that their personal freedoms cannot encroach on the freedoms of families with children who frequent the same recreation spot. Although topless sunbathing is not prohibited in Poland, the judge sentenced them to pay a fine of 230 [[zloty]] (150 zloty by different source,&lt;ref name="france24"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.france24.com/en/20081107-polish-court-reprimands-topless-sunbathers |title=Polish court reprimands topless sunbathers |publisher=France 24 (after AFP News Briefs) |date=January 10, 2009|accessdate=July 22, 2012 |author=AFP |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090110125209/http://www.france24.com/en/20081107-polish-court-reprimands-topless-sunbathers |archivedate=January 10, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[euro|€]]40, [[dollar|$]]55) for breaking the rules of conduct. In her rationale, the judge also said that it is not up to the defendants to teach youngsters human anatomy; however, her decision was appealed by Krzysztofek's female friend soon afterwards, with the plea of not guilty.&lt;ref name="pardon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="attuworld"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://attuworld.com/girls/polish-court-reprimands-topless-sunbathers.html |title=Polish court reprimands topless sunbathers |publisher=''Attuworld.com'' |accessdate=July 22, 2012 |author=Attu editorial |quote=[https://web.archive.org/web/20100102182403/http://attugirls.com/blonde/dorota-krzysztofek-from-poland.html  Dorota Krzysztofek from Poland busted for topless sunbathing.

The appellate court declared both women to be innocent,&lt;ref name="wyborcza.pl-2"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://wyborcza.pl/1,76842,6232762,Topless_jest_legalny.html | title=Topless jest legalny | publisher=[[Gazeta Wyborcza]], Szczecin | date=April 2, 2009 | accessdate=July 22, 2012 | author=Adam Zadworny | language=Polish}}&lt;/ref&gt; because the city staff were unable to prove that anyone at the beach was indignant or scandalized by their toplessness, and no complaint was ever reported. On the contrary, some visitors stood up to their defense. There were no signs at the recreation area against what is otherwise legal.&lt;ref name="france24"/&gt; The appellate court's decision was binding, but it also created an aura of ambivalence, with topless sunbathing in public declared acceptable only if nobody else including families with children formally objects to it.&lt;ref name="pardon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="polandian"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://polandian.wordpress.com/2009/02/05/topless-women-soften-polish-court/ | title=Topless women soften Polish court (entertainment, photo credit: Getty Images) | publisher=''Polandian''.

=== Sweden ===
In Sweden, toplessness is not illegal. However, private or public establishments are permitted to establish [[dress code]]s which may require women to wear tops, and deny access or remove individuals who breach these standards. In September 2007, "[[Bara Bröst]]" (a pun meaning both "Just Breasts" and "Bare Breasts") appeared to promote topless equality in these semi-public facilities. The group staged several events in public swim baths in September and October 2007, starting in [[Uppsala]] from which they were evicted several times, before succeeding in [[Sundsvall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metro.co.uk/weird/76183-swedes-fight-for-topless-rights |publisher=Metro.co.uk|date=November 19, 2007|title=Swedes fight for topless rights}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thelocal.se/9599/20080108/ Victory for topless bathers] Article from The Local&lt;/ref&gt;

The group scored a victory in June 2009 when the [[Malmö]] city's sports and recreation committee approved new rules that, while requiring everybody to wear bathing suits at indoor public swimming pools, did not require women to cover their breasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thelocal.se/20250/20090624/ |publisher=[[The Local]] |date=24 June 2009 |title=Malmö win for topless Swedish bathers}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inquisitr.com/27519/swedish-city-legalizes-topless-bathingat-public-swimming-pools/ |title=Swedish city legalizes topless bathing at public swimming pools |publisher=Inquisitr.com |date=2009-06-27 |accessdate=2009-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; "We don't define what bathing suits men should wear so it doesn't make much sense to do it for women. And besides, it's not unusual for men to have large breasts that resemble women's breasts", said a council spokesman.&lt;ref name="Inquisitr.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inquisitr.com/27519/swedish-city-legalizes-topless-bathingat-public-swimming-pools/ |title=Swedish city legalizes topless bathing....at public swimming pools |publisher=Inquisitr.com |date=2009-06-27 |accessdate=2009-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Vancouver Pride 2009 (31).jpg|thumb|Topless women at [[Vancouver Pride Festival]]]]

In 1991 toplessness as an indecent act was challenged by Gwen Jacob in [[Guelph]], [[Ontario]], who removed her shirt and was charged with indecency. Part of her defence was the [[double standard]]s between men and women. Although she was convicted, this was overturned by the Court of Appeal.&lt;ref name="QueenvsJacob"&gt;{{Cite journal| url = http://www.canlii.org/en/on/onca/doc/1996/1996canlii1119/1996canlii1119.html | title = Judgment C12668, R. vs. Jacob | date = 1996-12-09 | publisher = Province of Ontario Court of Appeal | accessdate = 2009-02-16| postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; This case determined that being topless is not indecent under the meaning of the Criminal Code. However it did not establish any constitutional right of equality. This case subsequently led to the acquittal of women in [[British Columbia]] and [[Saskatchewan]] who faced similar charges. Although each province and territory technically reserves its right to interpret the law as it pleases, the Ontario case has proven influential. Since the matter has not been determined by the [[Supreme Court of Canada]], it is still possible that a woman could be convicted elsewhere in Canada, but interpretation of moral law in Canada has become increasingly liberalized.&lt;ref&gt;Valverde, Mariana (1999). [http://myweb.dal.ca/mgoodyea/Documents/Law/The%20harms%20of%20sex%20and%20the%20risks%20of%20of%20breasts%20Valverde%20Social%20Leg%20Stud%201999%208%282%29%20181-197.pdf "The Harms of Sex and the Risks of Breasts: Obscenity and Indecency in Canadian Law"]. ''Social Legal Studies'' (8): 181.&lt;/ref&gt; There do not appear to have been any further women charged in Canada since these cases were determined.

=== United States ===
In the United States, states have primary jurisdiction in matters of public morality. The topfreedom movement has claimed success in a few instances in persuading some state and federal courts to overturn some state laws on the basis of [[sex discrimination]] or [[equal protection]], arguing that a woman should be free to expose her chest in any context in which a man can expose his. Other successful cases have been on the basis of freedom of expression in protest, or simply that exposure of breasts is not indecent (or similar terminology).

Laws and ordinances barring female toplessness are being challenged in federal courts around the nation. Each lawsuit, if it prevails at the appellate level, will legalize topfreedom in the following U.S. circuits of appeal (from west to east): 9 (California), 10 (Colorado), 8 (Missouri) and 4 (Maryland). A federal lawsuit in the 7th Circuit (Illinois), was lost at the appellate level and the petition for review by the U.S. Supreme Court was denied.

==== Colorado ====
On February 22, 2017, U.S. District Judge R. Brooke Jackson granted a [[preliminary injunction]] against a Fort Collins ordinance banning female toplessness saying it likely violates the [[Equal Protection Clause]] of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] due to gender-based discrimination. Britt Hoagland, Samantha Six and Free the Nipple - Fort Collins brought the case in May 2016. The judge wrote: ''the naked female breast is seen as disorderly or dangerous because society, from Renaissance paintings to Victoria's Secret commercials, has conflated female breasts with genitalia and stereotyped them as such. The irony is that by forcing women to cover up their bodies, society has made naked women's breasts something to see.'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4252844/Judge-blocks-Colorado-college-town-s-ban-topless-women.html |title=Judge in Colorado blocks town's ban on topless women calling it unconstitutional |date= February 23, 2017 |publisher= Daily Mail.com |accessdate=2017-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fort Collins is appealing the district court's ruling to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.westword.com/news/free-the-nipple-topless-order-being-fought-by-fort-collins-8903249 |title=Fighting Free the Nipple Topless Order Will Cost Fort Collins $250K, Attorney Says |date= March 23, 2017 |publisher= Westword.com |accessdate=2017-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 17, 2018, a three-judge panel of the 10th Circuit heard Fort Collins' appeal of the preliminary injunction ruling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.delmarvanow.com/story/news/2018/01/17/free-nipple-apppeal/1040824001// |title=Appeals court hears Fort Collins topless ban arguments |date= January 17, 2018 |publisher= USA Today Network |accessdate=2018-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the district court's ruling is upheld on appeal, discriminatory anti-topless laws in the territory of the Tenth Circuit (Wyoming, Utah, Colorado, New Mexico, Kansas, and Oklahoma) will be unenforceable.

==== Florida ====
A Florida statute about indecent exposure prohibits the vulgar or indecent exposure of sexual organs but does not specify if female breasts are included as sexual organs. The right to breastfeed in public is expressly protected,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=The Florida Legislature|title=Lewdness; Indecent Exposure – Sec. 800.03 Fla.

State, 766 So. 2d 1067 (Fla. 5th DCA 1999)&lt;/ref&gt; and the Supreme Court of Florida held that a separate statute about disorderly conduct can be used to prosecute female toplessness.&lt;ref&gt;Moffett v. State, 340 So. 2d 1155 (Fla. 1976).&lt;/ref&gt;  Courts have rejected equal protection arguments.

The right of a woman to ''protest'' topless has been held to be a freedom of expression and not an equal protection issue.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} For example, in 2007, a Florida court acquitted a woman of indecent exposure for being topless on [[Daytona Beach, Florida|Daytona Beach]] because of the political nature of her stand, under the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] right of free speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gotopless.org/news.php?item.8.1|title=On Sept 25, 2007, Daytona Beach, FL loses topless case|first=|last=|date=25 September 2007 |website=GoTopless}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although there is only one known public place throughout the state where female toplessness is officially allowed (a [[nude beach]] located at [[Haulover Park]], in [[Bal Harbour]]), topless bathing is tolerated on [[South Beach]], along with a number of hotel pools in [[Miami Beach]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Muench-Pace|first=Dawn|title=Topless and Nude Beaches in Miami|url=http://gomiami.about.com/od/naturebeachesparks/a/ToplessBeaches.htm|publisher=About.com|accessdate=9 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=O'Neill|first=Natalie|title=Topless Protesters on South Beach|url=http://www.miaminewtimes.com/2008-09-04/news/topless-protesters-on-south-beach/|accessdate=24 August 2017|newspaper=Miami New Times|date=September 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== New Jersey ====
In 2008,  Jill Coccaro, aka Phoenix Feeley,&lt;ref name=durante/&gt; of New York City (see also [[Topfreedom#New York|New York]], below) visited the beach at [[Spring Lake, New Jersey]]. She did not wear a top and was arrested when she refused to cover up. She was given a T-shirt but left the police department and took it off, and was arrested again.&lt;ref name=durante/&gt; She was charged with violating a borough ordinance prohibiting public nudity. She appealed the conviction to the state appeals court, and the two-judge panel—one man, one woman—ruled against her.&lt;ref name=durante&gt;{{cite news|last=Durante|first=Thomas|title=Breasts are a moral 'threat': Court rules topless sunbathing violates 'public sensibilities' |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2037604/Breasts-moral-threat-New-Jersey-rules-topless-sunbather-Phoenix-Feeley-bizarre-ruling.html|accessdate=12 February 2012|newspaper=Daily Mail UK|date=September 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Restrictions on the exposure of the female breast are supported by the important governmental interest in safeguarding the public's moral sensibilities." The court cited ''State of New Jersey v. Arlene Vogt'' (2001) as precedent.&lt;ref name=baxter&gt;{{cite web|last=Baxter|first=Christopher|title=State appeals court rejects N.Y. woman's fight to go topless in public|url=http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2011/09/state_appeals_court_rejects_ny.html|publisher=New Jersey On-Line LLC|accessdate=12 February 2012|date=September 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that case, Vogt was fined after she appeared on Higbee Beach in [[Cape May County, New Jersey]] without a shirt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NJ v Arlene Vogt|url=http://naturisteducation.org/Toni_Egbert_Library/State_Appellate_Courts/NJ_v_Arlene_Vogt/nj_v_arlene_vogt.html|accessdate=12 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the five years since she was found guilty and fined, she appealed the case to the New Jersey state appellate court, who ruled against her. The [[New Jersey Supreme Court]] refused to hear her appeal.&lt;ref name=bodner&gt;{{cite news|last=Bodner|first=Brett|title=Brett|url=http://www.dailyrecord.com/article/20130806/NJNEWS10/308060043/Woman-who-went-topless-Spring-Lake-2008-now-jail-after-refusing-pay-fines|accessdate=25 August 2013|newspaper=Daily record|date=Aug 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Legally representing herself, she then appealed to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]], but it too refused to hear her appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Phoenix Feeley v NJ|url=https://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/13-5801.htm|accessdate=June 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She would not pay the  $816 fine, telling Judge George Pappas, "I refuse to pay the fines for an act that is legal for a man, but not legal for a woman." The judge sentenced her to 16 days but she was released after only eight for good behavior. Ron Taft, a Manhattan attorney, offered to pay her fine but Coccaro refused, desiring to make a point. She went on a hunger strike. The GoTopless group organized a protest outside the jail where Coccaro was held,&lt;ref name=bodner/&gt; but only two individuals attended. Taft commented, "The point is, there are guys with larger breasts than women, and sometimes they take their top off."&lt;ref name=kemp&gt;{{cite news|last=Kemp|first=Joe|title=BUST-ed!

==== New Mexico ====
The [[City of Albuquerque]] has an anti-topless ordinance.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==== New York ====
In 1986, seven women who picnicked topless were charged in [[Rochester, New York]] with baring "that portion of the breast which is below the top of the areola".&lt;ref&gt;[[New York Penal Law|Penal Law]] § 245.01 has since been amended. For the [http://law.onecle.com/new-york/penal/PEN0245.01_245.01.html present version]: &lt;br&gt;A person is guilty of exposure if he appears in a public place in such a manner that the private or intimate parts of his body are unclothed or exposed. For purposes of this section, the private or intimate parts of a female person shall include that portion of the breast which is below the top of the areola. This section shall not apply to the breastfeeding of infants or to any person entertaining or performing in a play, exhibition, show or entertainment.&lt;/ref&gt; That law had originally been enacted to discourage 'topless' waitresses. The women were initially convicted, but on appeal two of the women's charges were reversed by the New York State Court of Appeals in 1992 on equal protection grounds in ''Santorelli's'' case.&lt;ref name=Santorelli&gt;{{cite web|title=NY v Santorelli|url=http://naturisteducation.org/Toni_Egbert_Library/State_Supreme_Courts/NY_v_Santorelli/ny_v_santorelli.html|publisher=Naturist Education Foundation|accessdate=12 February 2012|date=July 7, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cornell&gt;{{cite web|title=The People &amp;C., Respondent, ''V''.

Jill Coccaro, aka Phoenix Feeley,&lt;ref name=durante/&gt; of New York City, was arrested in 2005 in New York City for walking along a street without wearing a shirt. She sued the city for violating a New York State Supreme Court ruling in ''Santorelli's'' case which had declared that women can go topless in public.&lt;ref name=Santorelli /&gt; The city finally paid $29,000 to settle her lawsuit. The [[Outdoor Co-ed Topless Pulp Fiction Appreciation Society]] has since 2011 organized regular gatherings around New York City of women who read books in public while topless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Outdoor Co-ed Topless Pulp Fiction Appreciation Society|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/09/07/co-ed-topless-pulp-fiction-reading-naked_n_952510.html|publisher=Huffington Post|accessdate=8 February 2012|date=Sep 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The objective of the group, besides enjoying the sun and book reading, is to create awareness that New York law allows toplessness in public and to change social attitudes to the exposure of breasts. Although participation has been very small, there has been no harassment of the participants either by the police or the public. The Topless New York series, created by an anonymous New York City photographer in 2007, is another effort to raise awareness of women's topless rights in New York State, and normalize the exercise of those rights, by publishing photographs of women topless in public all over New York City and other areas of New York State.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Topless New York|url=https://twitter.com/ToplessNewYork|publisher=Topless New York|accessdate=14 November 2016|date=2007–2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Holly Van Voast]], a Bronx photographer and performance artist, was detained, arrested or issued summonses 10 times during 2011 and 2012. Among other places, she went topless on the [[Staten Island Ferry]],&lt;ref name=flegenheimer/&gt; at the Oyster Bar in [[Grand Central Terminal]], in front of an elementary school, on a train, and outside a [[Hooters|Hooters restaurant]].&lt;ref name=goodman/&gt; After her arrest in front of the Hooters, police officers took her to a hospital for a psychiatric evaluation. On October 11, 2011, she appeared in the Midtown Community Court and promptly removed her top, baring her breasts, in front of the judge.&lt;ref name=flegenheimer&gt;{{cite news|last=Flegenheimer|first=Matt|title=In Court for Disrobing, and Doing It Again|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/13/nyregion/answering-a-summons-on-disrobing-and-disrobing-in-court.html|accessdate=25 August 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=October 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; All the charges were dismissed. Van Voast filed a federal lawsuit on May 15 against the city and the police department.&lt;ref name=goodman&gt;{{cite news|last=Goodman|first=J. David|title=See Topless Woman?

In February 2013, the New York City Police Department issued a command to all its officers through their daily roll call. It reminded officers that they are not to cite or arrest a woman for public lewdness, indecent exposure or any other section of the [[New York Penal Law|Penal Law]] for "simply exposing their breasts in public."&lt;ref name=goodman/&gt;

====Oregon====
Oregon's indecent exposure law criminalizes only nudity that is intended to sexually arouse the public. The cities of [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], [[Eugene, Oregon|Eugene]], [[Ashland, Oregon|Ashland]] and [[Happy Valley, Oregon|Happy Valley]] all have local ordinances against exposing genitalia, but not against exposing female breasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Women can bare it all in the Rose City|url=http://psuvanguard.com/women-can-bare-it-all-in-the-rose-city/|publisher=Vanguard|accessdate=4 September 2017|date=November 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Public nudity in Oregon: Where you can and can't legally be naked in the open|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2015/06/public_nudity_in_oregon.html/|publisher=The Oregonian|accessdate=28 December 2017|date=June 29, 2015|dead-url=yes|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160817172139/http://www.oregonlive.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2015/06/public_nudity_in_oregon.html/|archive-date=August 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pennsylvania====
Pennsylvania laws do not directly address the issue, are ambiguous and have been used to prosecute female toplessness under open lewdness, indecent exposure or disorderly conduct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ydr.com/story/news/2017/06/13/topl/391833001/ |title=Topless women in Pa.: Against the law? |date= June 13, 2017 |publisher= York Daily Record |accessdate=2017-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Texas ====
In 1972, the Texas [[State Equal Rights Amendments|Equal Rights Amendment]] was passed into law, which communities in [[Lewisville, Texas|Lewisville, TX]]&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.feministezine.com/feminist/modern/Toplessness-A-Right.html| title=Toplessness: A Right All Women Deserve|accessdate=14 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth, TX]]&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;  have used to strike down gendered ordinances, including toplessness. However, women in Texas appearing topless in public can be charged under [[public nuisance]] laws,&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; with the exception of [[Austin]], the state capital, where some women sunbathe topless in Zilker Park, at various festivals, and at [[Hippie Hollow]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url =http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,200615,00.html |title=Indecent Exposure |first=Lis |last=Wiehl|accessdate=14 January 2010 |publisher=Fox News | date=22 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, Lewisville, TX's nudity laws were updated to indicate that food staff must wear 'decent covering'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = A Restaurant In Texas Called Redneck Heaven Was Told That Their Waitresses Had To Start Wearing Clothes|url = https://www.buzzfeed.com/ryanhatesthis/a-restaurant-in-texas-called-redneck-heaven-was-told-that-th#.xn20d4lp0|accessdate = 2015-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Texas town changing nudity laws to make body paint unacceptable after waitresses served customers topless|url = http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2366237/Redneck-Heaven-naked-body-paint-waitresses-force-Texas-town-change-nudity-laws.html|accessdate = 2015-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Oceania ==
=== Australia ===
In [[Australia]], [[indecent exposure]] laws only refer to the genital area, so technically both male and female toplessness is legal. However, many local councils impose their own rules, and have the power to ask topless people to leave an area.&lt;ref name=Lifehackerau&gt;{{cite news|title=Is it legal to sunbathe topless in Australia?|date=Nov 30, 2015|access-date= Nov 12, 2018|author=Chris Jager|publisher=Lifehacker|url=https://www.lifehacker.com.au/2015/11/is-it-legal-to-sunbathe-topless/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, women who go topless are sometimes slapped with more vague charges such as being a public nuisance, or offensive behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=How to Legally #FreeTheNipple in Australia|date=March 11, 2016|access-date= Nov 12, 2018|author=Katherine Gillespie|publisher=Vice.com|url=https://i-d.vice.com/en_au/article/mbv4pb/how-to-legally-freethenipple-in-australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On public beaches, local bylaws are not heavily enforced, and women can often sunbake topless without fuss.&lt;ref name=Lifehackerau&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Breastfeeding in public places is a legal right in Australia. Under the [[Sex Discrimination Act 1984]], no business or service provider can discriminate against a breastfeeding woman. Women can still breastfeed even if no other food/drink is allowed in the area. If a special baby care room is available for breastfeeding, women are not required to use it unless they wish to. If someone abuses a beastfeeding woman or forces her to leave, this may come under state/territory harassment laws. These protections also include women who are expressing breast milk for their baby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|url=https://www.breastfeeding.asn.au/bf-info/breastfeeding-and-law/legalright|title=Breastfeeding in public - your legal rights|date=Aug 2016|access-date=12 Nov 2018|publisher=Australian Breastfeeding Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== New Zealand ===
In [[New Zealand]], there is no specific law prohibiting nudity in public places. If a person is nude ''and'' also exhibiting lewd and lascivious, or obscene behaviour, then they may fall afoul of laws.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.freebeaches.org.nz/legal.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[High Court of New Zealand]] has upheld a conviction of disorderly conduct for nudity in the street, because it was not a place where nudity was known to occur or commonplace. Being nude in the street is likely to incur a small fine if a complaint is made against the person, or if the person ignores a police order to cover themselves. However in practice, the likelyhood of being prosecuted for nudity on a public beach is low, providing the person keeps to themselves.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.freebeaches.org.nz/legal.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, a woman swam topless on [[Opunake]] beach. The police were called, but informed the callers that toplessness was not an offence.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stuff.co.nz/taranaki-daily-news/news/6321828/Nudity-not-necessarily-an-offence&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, nudists used the beach at [[Tauranga]], which causes consternation among some residents. However, the local council said there were no bylaws dealing with the issue, and that nudity was not an offence.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nzherald.co.nz/front-page-top-stories/news/article.cfm?c_id=698&amp;objectid=11824550&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16501">In [[machine learning]] and [[natural language processing]], a '''topic model''' is a type of [[statistical model]] for discovering the abstract "topics" that occur in a collection of documents. Topic modeling is a frequently used text-mining tool for discovery of hidden semantic structures in a text body. Intuitively, given that a document is about a particular topic, one would expect particular words to appear in the document more or less frequently: "dog" and "bone" will appear more often in documents about dogs, "cat" and "meow" will appear in documents about cats, and "the" and "is" will appear equally in both. A document typically concerns multiple topics in different proportions; thus, in a document that is 10% about cats and 90% about dogs, there would probably be about 9 times more dog words than cat words. The "topics" produced by topic modeling techniques are clusters of similar words. A topic model captures this intuition in a mathematical framework, which allows examining a set of documents and discovering, based on the statistics of the words in each, what the topics might be and what each document's balance of topics is.

Topic models are also referred to as probabilistic topic models, which refers to statistical algorithms for discovering the latent semantic structures of an extensive text body. In the age of information, the amount of the written material we encounter each day is simply beyond our processing capacity. Topic models can help to organize and offer insights for us to understand large collections of unstructured text bodies. Originally developed as a text-mining tool, topic models have been used to detect instructive structures in data such as genetic information, images, and networks. They also have applications in other fields such as [[bioinformatics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Blei|first1=David|title=Probabilistic Topic Models|journal=Communications of the ACM|date=April 2012|volume=55|issue=4|pages=77–84|doi=10.1145/2133806.2133826}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Latent Dirichlet allocation]] (LDA), perhaps the most common topic model currently in use, is a generalization of PLSA. Developed by [[David Blei]], [[Andrew Ng]], and [[Michael I. Jordan]] in 2002, LDA introduces sparse [[Dirichlet distribution|Dirichlet prior distributions]] over document-topic and topic-word distributions, encoding the intuition that documents cover a small number of topics and that topics often use a small number of words.&lt;ref name="blei2003"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other topic models are generally extensions on LDA, such as [[Pachinko allocation]], which improves on LDA by modeling correlations between topics in addition to the word correlations which constitute topics.

The resulting patterns are called "topics".&lt;ref&gt;http://topicmodels.west.uni-koblenz.de/ckling/tmt/svd_ap.html&lt;/ref&gt;]]

==Topic models for context information==

Approaches for temporal information include Block and Newman's determination of the temporal dynamics of topics in the ''[[Pennsylvania Gazette]]'' during 1728–1800. Griffiths &amp; Steyvers use topic modeling on abstracts from the journal ''[[PNAS]]'' to identify topics that rose or fell in popularity from 1991 to 2001. Nelson has been analyzing change in topics over time in the ''[[Richmond Times-Dispatch]]'' to understand social and political changes and continuities in Richmond during the [[American Civil War]]. Yang, Torget and Mihalcea applied topic modeling methods to newspapers from 1829–2008. Mimno used topic modelling with 24 journals on classical philology and archaeology spanning 150 years to look at how topics in the journals change over time and how the journals become more different or similar over time.

Yin et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yin|first=Zhijun|year=2011|title=Geographical topic discovery and comparison|url=|journal=Proceedings of the 20th international conference on World wide web|pages=247–256|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; introduced a topic model for geographically distributed documents, where document positions are explained by latent regions which are detected during inference.

Chang and Blei&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chang|first=Jonathan|year=2009|title=Relational Topic Models for Document Networks|url=|journal=AISTATS|volume=9|pages=81–88|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; included network information between linked documents in the relational topic model, which allows to model links between websites.

The author-topic model by Rosen-Zvi et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rosen-Zvi|first=Michal|year=2004|title=The author-topic model for authors and documents|url=|journal=Proceedings of the 20th conference on Uncertainty in artificial intelligence|pages=487–494|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; models the topics associated with authors of documents to improve the topic detection for documents with authorship information.

==Algorithms==
In practice researchers attempt to fit appropriate model parameters to the data corpus using one of several heuristics for maximum likelihood fit. A recent survey by Blei describes this suite of algorithms.&lt;ref name="blei2011"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Several groups of researchers starting with Papadimitriou et al.&lt;ref name=PRTV1998 /&gt; have attempted to design algorithms with probable guarantees. Assuming that the data were actually generated by the model in question, they try to design algorithms that probably find the model that was used to create the data. Techniques used here include [[singular value decomposition]] (SVD) and the [[method of moments (statistics)|method of moments]]. In 2012 an algorithm based upon [[non-negative matrix factorization]] (NMF) was introduced that also generalizes to topic models with correlations among topics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite arXiv

[[File:Senate cap.PNG|right|200px|thumb|Seal of the United States Senate]]
The '''United States Senate Committee on Finance''' (or, less formally, '''Senate Finance Committee''') is a [[Standing committee (United States Congress)|standing committee]] of the [[United States Senate]]. The Committee concerns itself with matters relating to [[Taxation in the United States|taxation and other revenue]] measures generally, and those relating to the [[insular possessions]]; [[Bond (finance)|bonded debt]] of the [[United States]]; [[customs]], collection districts, and [[ports of entry]] and delivery; deposit of public moneys; general [[revenue sharing]]; health programs under the [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security Act]] (notably [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] and [[Medicaid]]) and health programs financed by a specific tax or trust fund; national social security; [[Trade pact|reciprocal trade agreements]]; [[tariff]] and [[import]] quotas, and related matters thereto; and the transportation of dutiable goods. It is considered to be one of the most powerful committees in Congress.

==History==

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Wyden.Lew.Hatch.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Committee Chairman [[Ron Wyden]] (D-OR), and Ranking Member [[Orrin Hatch]] (R-UT), greet [[Secretary of Treasury]] [[Jack Lew]], center]] --&gt;

The Committee on Finance is one of the original committees established in the Senate. First created on December 11, 1815, as a [[Select or special committee (United States)|select committee]] and known as the Committee on Finance and an [sic] Uniform National Currency, it was formed to alleviate economic issues arising from the War of 1812. On December 10, 1816 the Senate officially created the Committee on Finance as a [[standing committee]].  Originally, the Committee had power over tariffs, taxation, banking and currency issues and appropriations.  Under this authority the committee played an influential role in the most heated topics of the era; including numerous tariffs issues and the [[Bank War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the Committee on Finance United States Senate|url=http://www.finance.senate.gov/download/?id=f057dc65-9c25-4ec2-96be-36c67490ecad|publisher=Government Printing Office}}&lt;/ref&gt; The committee was also influential in the creation of the [[U.S. Department of Interior|Department of Interior]] in 1849.&lt;ref&gt;Simms, Henry Harrison. Life of Robert M.T. Hunter: A Study in Sectionalism and Secession. Richmond: William Byrd Press, 1935&lt;/ref&gt;  Under the Chairmanship of [[William Pitt Fessenden]], the committee played a decisive role during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].  Appropriating all funds for the war effort as well as raising enough funds to finance the war through tariffs and the nation's first income tax.  Additionally, the committee produced the Legal Tender Act of 1862, the nation's first reliance on paper currency.&lt;ref&gt;Jellison, Charles A. Fessenden of Maine, Civil War Senator. Syracuse: Syracuse University Press, 1962.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1865 the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] created an [[House Appropriations Committee|Appropriations Committee]] to relieve the burden from the [[United States House Committee on Ways and Means|Committee on Ways and Means]].  The [[United States Senate|Senate]] followed this example by forming the [[U.S. Senate Committee on Appropriations|Appropriations Committee]] in 1867.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the Committee on Finance United States Senate|url=http://www.finance.senate.gov/download/?id=f057dc65-9c25-4ec2-96be-36c67490ecad|publisher=Government Printing Office}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the loss of one of its signature duties the committee continued to play a prominent role in the major issues of the nation.  The committee was at the center of the debate over the silver question in the latter half of the 19th Century.  Passage of the [[Bland-Allison Act]] and the [[Sherman Silver Purchase Act]] were attempts to remedy the demand for silver, though the silver cause would eventually fail by the end of the century.&lt;ref&gt;Sherman, John. Recollections of Forty Years in The House, Senate, and Cabinet: An Autobiography. 2 vols. 1895. Reprint. New York: Greenwood Press, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt;  The committee also continued to play a role in the debate over income taxes.  The repeal of the Civil War income taxes in the 1870s would eventually be raised in 1894 with the passage of a new income tax law.  The Supreme Court's decision in {{ussc|name=Pollock v. Farmers' Loan &amp; Trust Co.|157|429|1895}} ruled the income tax as unconstitutional, since it was not based on apportionment.  The fight for an income tax finally culminated with the [[Payne-Aldrich Tariff Act]] of 1909.  In order to pass the new tariff Senate leaders, including Chairman [[Nelson Aldrich]], allowed for a Constitutional Amendment to be passed.  Four years later the [[Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|16th Amendment]] was officially ratified and in 1913 the nation's first peacetime income tax was instituted.&lt;ref&gt;Stephenson, Nathaniel W. Nelson W. Aldrich: A Leader In American Politics. 1930. Reprint. New York: Kennikat Press, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;

Around that same time the committee lost jurisdiction over banking and currency issues to the newly created [[United States Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs|Committee on Banking and Currency]].  The committee did gain jurisdiction over veterans’ benefits when it successfully passed the War Risk Insurance Act of 1917.  The act shifted pensions from gratuities to benefits and which served as one of the first life insurance programs created under the federal government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the Committee on Finance United States Senate|url=http://www.finance.senate.gov/download/?id=f057dc65-9c25-4ec2-96be-36c67490ecad|publisher=Government Printing Office}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Finance Committee continued to play an increasingly important role in the lives of the nation's veterans.  The committee helped to consolidate the veteran bureaucracy by streamlining the various responsibilities into a Veterans' Bureau which ultimately would become the Veterans' Administration.  In 1924 the committee passed a [[Adjusted Compensation Payment Act|"Bonus Bill"]] for [[World War I]] veterans which compensated veterans of that war for their service.&lt;ref&gt;The Provision of Federal
Benefits for Veterans. House Committee Print 171, 84th Congress, 1st Session, December 28, 1955&lt;/ref&gt;  These series of increasing and providing better benefits for veterans reached a crescendo in 1944 with the passage of the [[GI Bill|Servicemen's Readjustment Act]].  Senator [[Bennett Clark|Bennett "Champ" Clark]], who served as the Chairman of the Subcommittee on Veterans, assured smooth sailing of the bill through the Senate.  The bill not only ended the usual demands from returning veterans which had been seen in nearly every war America had participated in, but also provided the most generous benefits that veterans had ever received, including continuing education, loans and unemployment insurance.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, Michael. When Dreams Come True: The G.I. Bill and the Making of Modern America. Washington: Potomac Books, Inc., 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all Finance Committee legislation was as well received as the G.I. Bill.  At the beginning of the [[Great Depression]] the committee passed the [[Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act]].  The act greatly increased tariffs and had a negative effect on the nation's economy.  Following traditional economic practices the members of the committee, including Chairman [[Reed Smoot]], felt that protection of American businesses was required in order to buoy them during the dire economic times.  The effort backfired and the economic situation worsened.  The Smoot-Hawley Tariff would eventually be replaced by the [[Reciprocal Tariff Act]] of 1934 which authorized the President to negotiate trade agreements.  This act not only set up the trade policy system as it exists today but also effectively transferred trade making policy from the Congress to the President.&lt;ref&gt;Dobson, John. Two Centuries of Tariffs: The Background and Emergence of the U.S. International Trade Commission. Washington:U.S. Government Printing Office, 1976.&lt;/ref&gt;

The committee also played an important role in two major acts created under the [[New Deal]].  The committee received jurisdiction over the [[National Industrial Recovery Act]] because of tax code changes in the bill.  The new bureaucracy was President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s attempt to stimulate the economy and promote jobs for unemployed Americans while also regulating businesses.  The National Recovery Administration would ultimately fail as it lost public support but the act served as a springboard to the [[Wagner Act]] and the [[National Labor Board]].&lt;ref&gt;Ratner, Sidney. Taxation and Democracy in America. Octagon Books, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;

Probably the single biggest, and by far one of the most lasting, piece of legislation enacted by the Finance Committee during the New Deal was the [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security Act]].  Once again the committee received jurisdiction owing to the payroll taxes that would be enacted to pay for the new program.  The act was the first effort by the federal government to provide benefits to the elderly and the unemployed.  The act greatly enhanced the economic welfare of many elderly Americans.&lt;ref&gt;Swain, Martha H. Pat Harrison: The New Deal Years. Jackson: University Press of Mississippi, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1981, a Senate Resolution required the printing of the History of the Committee on Finance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the Committee on Finance United States Senate|url=http://www.finance.senate.gov/download/?id=f057dc65-9c25-4ec2-96be-36c67490ecad|publisher=Government Printing Office}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role==
The role of the Committee on Finance is very similar to that of the [[House Committee on Ways and Means]].  The one exception in area of jurisdiction is that the Committee on Finance has jurisdiction over both Medicare and Medicaid,  while the House Ways and Means Committee only has jurisdiction over Medicare. (The [[United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce|House Energy and Commerce Committee]] has jurisdiction over Medicaid.) The other difference in terms of power is that all revenue raising measures must originate in the House giving the Ways and Means Committee a slight edge in setting tax policy.  In addition to having jurisdiction over legislation the Committee has extensive oversight powers.  It has authority to investigate, review and evaluate existing laws, and the agencies that implement them.

Due to the Committee's wide jurisdiction, it is often considered an influential committee.  A wide array of Senators with differing policy concerns seek membership on the Committee because of its role in setting tax, trade, and health policy.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5378">[[File:Willard L. Boyd.jpg|thumb|right|170px|Boyd from 1969 ''Hawkeye'']]
'''Willard Lee Boyd''' (born March 29, 1927)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lib.uiowa.edu/spec-coll/archives/guides/RG05/RG05.01.13.htm&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[United States|American]] [[legal scholar]], [[academic administrator]], and
[[President Emeritus]] of [[The University of Iowa]] and [[Field Museum of Natural History]] in [[Chicago, Illinois]].  He is currently on the faculty of the [[University of Iowa College of Law]] as the Rawlings/Miller Professor of Law and President Emeritus.

==Early years and career==
Boyd grew up on Commonwealth Avenue in St. Paul, MN, attending [[Murray Junior High School (Minnesota)|Murray High School]], [[St. Paul, Minnesota]], graduating in 1944.  He served as a U.S. Navy Hospital Corpsman from 1945 to 1947.  He went on the [[University of Minnesota]], where he earned his [[B.S.L]] in 1949, and received his [[LL.B.]] from the [[University of Minnesota Law School]] in 1951.  He was admitted to the Minnesota [[Admission to the bar in the United States|Bar]] in 1951.  Boyd then attended the [[University of Michigan Law School]], where he received an [[LL.M.]] in 1952.  He worked as an [[Associate (business rank)|Associate]] [[Lawyer|attorney]] at [[Minneapolis]] [[law firm]] [[Dorsey &amp; Whitney]] from 1952 to 1954.&lt;ref name=BoydCV&gt;[http://www.law.uiowa.edu/documents/faculty_cvs/boyd.pdf Willard L(ee) Boyd CV], University of Iowa College of Law, March 4, 2008, Accessed October 13, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academia==
After a brief time in private practice, Boyd entered academia, teaching law at The University of Iowa College of Law from 1954 to 1964; during this time he earned his [[S.J.D.]] from Michigan in 1962.  He became a member of the Iowa Bar in 1958.  His career as an academic administrator began in 1964, when he served as Associate Dean of the College of Law before becoming Vice President of Academic Affairs and Dean of the Faculties for The University of Iowa, a position he held from 1964 to 1968.&lt;ref name="BoydCV"/&gt;

In 1969, Boyd succeeded [[Howard Bowen]] as the fifteenth President of The University of Iowa.  He served until 1981, and was eventually followed by [[James O. Freedman]].  He served as Chairman of the [[American Association of Universities]] from 1979 to 1980.&lt;ref name=UIbio&gt;[http://www.law.uiowa.edu/faculty/willard-boyd.php Willard Boyd], University of Iowa College of Law, Accessed October 20, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

After ending his tenure as a university president, Boyd served as the President of the [[Field Museum of Natural History]] in [[Chicago]] from 1981 to 1996.  During this time, he was one of the first recipients of the [[Charles Frankel Prize]] (now the National Humanities Medal) in 1989, honoring his efforts to bring history, literature, philosophy and other humanities disciplines to general audiences.&lt;ref name="UIbio"/&gt;

He returned to Iowa in 1996 to teach at the College of Law again. A central focus of his return to Iowa was creating the Iowa Nonprofit Resource Center (which became the Larned A. Waterman Iowa Nonprofit Resource Center after a significant gift from the Waterman family); he taught courses which supported learning in the nonprofit area. In 2002 he served as interim president, holding the role between 2002 and 2003 until being succeeded by [[David J. Skorton]]. After serving as Acting President, he returned to teaching as the Rawlings-Miller Professor of Law in 2003; he also was the Chester Phillips Research Fellow at the [[Tippie College of Business]] at Iowa from 2003 to 2006.&lt;ref name="BoydCV"/&gt;

He is a member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]], the [[American Law Institute]], the Department of State Cultural Property Advisory Committee and the board of National Arts Strategies and chairs the Iowa Cultural Trust. Willard is also a Trustee of the Roy J. Carver Trust.&lt;ref name="BoydCV"/&gt;

The Boyd Law Building at the University of Iowa is named for him.
