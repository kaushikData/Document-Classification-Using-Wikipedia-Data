}}

The meaning of the ambigram may either change, or remain the same, when viewed or interpreted from different perspectives.

[[Douglas R. Hofstadter]] describes an ambigram as a "calligraphic design that manages to squeeze two different readings into the selfsame set of curves." Different ambigram artists (sometimes called ''ambigramists'') may create completely different ambigrams from the same word or words, differing in both style and form.

==Discovery and popularity==
The earliest known non-natural ambigram dates to 1893 by artist [[Peter Newell]]. Although better known for his children's books and illustrations for Mark Twain and Lewis Carroll, he published two books of invertible illustrations, in which the picture turns into a different image entirely when turned upside down. The last page in his book ''Topsys &amp; Turvys'' contains the phrase THE END, which, when inverted, reads PUZZLE. In ''Topsys &amp; Turvys Number 2'' (1902), Newell ended with a variation on the ambigram in which THE END changes into PUZZLE 2.

The Verbeek strip "The UpsideDowns of old man Muffaroo and little lady Lovekins" used ambigrams in 3 consecutive strips in March,1904, but otherwise the format of this strip prevented the use of word balloons.

From June to September, 1908, the British monthly ''The Strand'' published a series of ambigrams by different people in its "Curiosities" column.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite magazine|last=Newnes|first=George|date=1908|title=Curiosities|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=45MkAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA359&amp;lpg=PA359&amp;dq=Possibly+B+is+the+only+letter+of+the+alphabet+that+will+produce+such+an+interesting+anomaly&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ScGLkirrWp&amp;sig=DY-p5rSxj-fKc1MoJv7_sruTSws&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjXm8vdxJXQAhVGyyYKHbjiCKMQ6AEIIzAB|magazine=The Strand Magazine|issue=36|page=359|doi=|pmid=|access-date=6 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of particular interest is the fact that all four of the people submitting ambigrams believed them to be a rare property of particular words. Mitchell T. Lavin, whose "chump" was published in June, wrote, "I think it is in the only word in the English language which has this peculiarity," while Clarence Williams wrote, about his "Bet" ambigram, "Possibly B is the only letter of the alphabet that will produce such an interesting anomaly."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1969, [[Raymond Loewy]] designed the rotational NEW MAN ambigram logo, which is still in use today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://raymond-loewy.un-jour.org/biographie_raymond_loewy.html|title=Raymond Loewy Biographie|last=|first=|date=|website=Raymond-loewy.un-jour.org|publisher=|language=French|accessdate=6 November 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090608042138/http://raymond-loewy.un-jour.org/biographie_raymond_loewy.html|archivedate=8 June 2009|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/culture/art/multimedia/2009/04/pl_arts?slide=6&amp;slideView=3|title=Typography Two Ways: Calligraphy With a Twist|last=Pierce|first=Scott|date=20 May 2009|website=[[Wired (website)]]|publisher=Wired.com|accessdate=6 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mirror ambigram [[DeLorean Motor Company]] logo was first used in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine|last=|first=|date=July 1977|title=1975 Prototype Logo|url=http://www.entermyworld.com/cat/articles/caranddriver/cdjul771x1.jpg|magazine=[[Car and Driver]]|doi=|pmid=|access-date=6 November 2016}} In 1977, only the single 1975 prototype existed.

[[John Langdon (typographer)|John Langdon]] and [[Scott Kim]] also each believed that they had invented ambigrams in the 1970s.&lt;ref name="Doodle"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/3648509/The-doodle-bug.html|title=The Doodle Bug|first=Emily|date=4 December 2005|work=|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|via=|author=Bearn|accessdate=6 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Langdon and Kim are probably the two artists who have been most responsible for the popularization of ambigrams. John Langdon produced the first mirror image logo "Starship" in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.johnlangdon.net/works/starship/|title=Starship|last=Langdon|first=John|date=|website=johnlangdon.net|publisher=[[John Langdon (typographer)|John Langdon]]|access-date=6 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Robert Petrick, who designed the invertible ''[[Angel (band)|Angel]]'' logo in 1976, was also an early influence on ambigrams.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://angelrocks.com/intro.html|title=Angel Logo|last=|first=|date=2 October 2009|website=angelrocks.com|publisher=|access-date=6 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest known published reference to the term ''ambigram'' was by [[Douglas R. Hofstadter|Hofstadter]], who attributed the origin of the word to conversations among a small group of friends during 1983–1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ambigramania.com/articles/entry/Origins-of-the-word-Ambigram-|title=Origins of the word ''Ambigram''|last=Hofstadter|first=Douglas|date=|website=|publisher=|format=e-mail message to David Holst|author=|accessdate=6 November 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160901122223/http://ambigramania.com/articles/entry/Origins-of-the-word-Ambigram-|archivedate=1 September 2016|df=}} &lt;/ref&gt; The original 1979 edition of Hofstadter's ''[[Gödel, Escher, Bach]]'' featured two 3-D ambigrams on the cover.

Ambigrams became more popular as a result of [[Dan Brown]] incorporating John Langdon's designs into the plot of his bestseller, ''[[Angels &amp; Demons]]'', and the DVD release of the ''[[Angels &amp; Demons]]'' movie contains a bonus chapter called "This is an Ambigram".  Langdon also produced the ambigram that was used for some versions of the book's cover.&lt;ref name="Doodle"/&gt; Brown used the name Robert Langdon for the hero in his novels as an homage to John Langdon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popularculture.it/museo_virtuale/pagine/dan_brown.html|title=As a tribute to John Langdon, I named the protagonist Robert Langdon.|last=Brown|first=Dan|date=21 December 2005|website=Popularculture.it|publisher=|language=Italian|accessdate=6 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In music, the [[Grateful Dead]] have used ambigrams several times, including on their albums ''[[Aoxomoxoa]]'' and ''[[American Beauty (album)|American Beauty]]''.

In the first series of the British show ''[[Trick or Treat (TV series)|Trick or Treat]]'', the show's host and creator [[Derren Brown]] uses cards with rotational ambigrams. These cards can read either 'Trick' or 'Treat'.

Although the words spelled by most ambigrams are relatively short in length, one DVD cover for [[The Princess Bride (film)|''The Princess Bride'']] movie creates a rotational ambigram out of two words: "Princess Bride," whether viewed right side up or upside down.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.amazon.ca/Princess-Bride-Anniversary-Widescreen-Bilingual/dp/B000TZJBT2|title=The Princess Bride (20th Anniversary Widescreen Edition) (Bilingual)|last=|first=|date=|website=amazon.ca|publisher=[[Amazon.com]]|access-date=6 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 iSmart's logo on one of its travel [[battery charger|charger]]s went [[Viral phenomenon|viral]] because the brand's name turned out to be a natural ambigram that read "+[[Jew]]s!" upside down. The company noted that "...we learned a powerful lesson of what not to do when creating a [[logo]].”

Ambigrams are exercises in [[graphic design]] that play with [[optical illusion]]s, [[symmetry]] and [[visual perception]]. Some ambigrams feature a relationship between their [[Visual appearance|form]] and their content. Ambigrams usually fall into one of several categories:

; 3-Dimensional : A design where an object is presented that will appear to read several letters or words when viewed from different angles. Such designs can be generated using [[constructive solid geometry]].{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

; Chain :A design where a word (or sometimes words) are interlinked, forming a repeating chain. Letters are usually overlapped meaning that a word will start partway through another word. Sometimes chain ambigrams are presented in the form of a circle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.johnlangdon.net/thoughts/types-of-ambigrams/|title=Types of Ambigrams {{!}} John Langdon|work=John Langdon|access-date=2018-10-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- Please check the website as a reliable source.
Used for 13, 14, 16, and 17 --&gt;

; [[Dihedral prime|Dihedral]]: A natural mirror-image ambigram consisting of numerical digits.

; Figure-ground :A design in which the spaces between the letters of one word form another word.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.johnlangdon.net/thoughts/types-of-ambigrams/|title=Types of Ambigrams {{!}} John Langdon|work=John Langdon|access-date=2018-10-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

; Fractal : A version of space-filling ambigrams where the tiled word branches from itself and then shrinks in a [[self-similar]] manner, forming a [[fractal]]. See [[Scott Kim]]'s fractal of the word "TREE" for an animated example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scottkim.com.previewc40.carrierzone.com/inversions/gallery/tree.html|title=Tree|last=Kim|first=Scott|date=1981|website=scottkim.com|publisher=|accessdate=6 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

; Mirror-image :A design that can be read when reflected in a mirror, usually as the same word or phrase both ways. Ambigrams that form different words when viewed in the mirror are also known as glass door ambigrams, because they can be printed on a glass door to be read differently when entering or exiting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.johnlangdon.net/thoughts/types-of-ambigrams/|title=Types of Ambigrams {{!}} John Langdon|work=John Langdon|access-date=2018-10-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

; Multi-Lingual : An ambigram that can be read one way in one language and another way in a different language. Multi-lingual ambigrams can exist in all of the various styles of ambigrams, with multi-lingual perceptual shift ambigrams being particularly striking.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

; Natural :A natural ambigram is a word that possesses one or more of the above symmetries when written in its natural state, requiring no typographic styling.  For example, the words "dollop", "suns" and "pod" form natural rotational ambigrams. In Korean,  곰 (bear) and 문 (door) form a natural rotational ambigram. In some fonts, the word "swims" forms a natural rotational ambigram. The word "bud" forms a natural mirror ambigram when reflected over a vertical axis. The words "CHOICE" and "OXIDE", in all capitals, form natural mirror ambigrams when reflected over a horizontal axis.  The longest such word is CHECKBOOK. The word "TOOTH", in all capitals, forms a natural mirror ambigram when its letters are stacked vertically and reflected over a vertical axis.  See the article ''[[transformation of text]]'' for a discussion of letter symmetry.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

;Perceptual Shift (Oscillation) :A design with no symmetry but can be read as two different words depending on how the curves of the letters are interpreted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.johnlangdon.net/thoughts/types-of-ambigrams/|title=Types of Ambigrams {{!}} John Langdon|work=John Langdon|access-date=2018-10-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;



; Rotational : A design that presents several instances of words when rotated through a fixed angle.  This is usually 180 degrees, but rotational ambigrams of other angles exist, for example 90 or 45 degrees.  The word spelled out from the alternative direction(s) is often the same, but may be a different word to the initially presented form.  A simple example is the lower-case abbreviation for "Down", ''dn'', which looks like the lower-case word ''up'' when rotated 180 degrees.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

; [[Strobogrammatic number|Strobogrammatic]]: A natural rotational ambigram consisting of numerical digits.

; Space-Filling : Similar to chain ambigrams, but tile to fill the 2-dimensional plane.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

; Spinonym : An ambigram in which all the letters are made of the same glyph, possibly rotated and/or inverted. WEB is an example of a word that can easily be made into a spinonym. Previously called rotoglyphs or rotaglyphs.&lt;ref&gt;See Hofstadter, ''Ambigrammi'', p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt;

; Symbiotogram : An ambigram that, when rotated, can be read as a different word than the original, e.g., "LIFE" would read as "DEATH".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dWTaRp2-HDUC&amp;lpg=PT51&amp;ots=KuitFo8p1_&amp;dq=symbiotogram&amp;pg=PT51#v=onepage&amp;q=symbiotogram&amp;f=false|title=Ambigrams Revealed: A Graphic Designer's Guide To Creating Typographic Art Using Optical Illusions, Symmetry, and Visual Perception|last=Prokhorov|first=Nikita|publisher=New Riders|year=2013|isbn=9780133086461|location=|pages=51, 124|language=en|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creating ambigrams==
There are no universal guidelines for creating ambigrams, and there are different ways of approaching problems. A number of books suggest methods for creation (including ''WordPlay''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=WordPlay |last=Langdon |first=John |publisher=Bantam Press |isbn= 0-593-05569-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Eye Twisters''&lt;ref name="Polster"&gt;{{cite book |title=Eye Twisters |last=Polster |first=Burkard |publisher=Constable |isbn=1-84529-629-X|author-link=Burkard Polster}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

Computerized methods to automatically create ambigrams have been developed. The earliest, the 'Ambimatic' created in 1996,&lt;ref name="Generators"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ambigram.com/ambigram-generators|title=Ambigram.com|last=Holst|first=David|date=|website=ambigram.com|publisher=Word.Net Communications|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060203040817/http://ambigram.com/|archive-date=3 February 2006|dead-url=yes|access-date=6 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; was letter-based and used a database of 351 letter glyphs in which each letter was mapped to another.&lt;ref name="Polster174"&gt;{{cite book
 |title=Eye Twisters
 |last=Polster
 |first=Burkard
 |publisher=Constable
 |isbn=1-84529-629-X
 |pages=174–176
}}&lt;/ref&gt; This generator could only map a word to itself or to another word that was the same length: because of this, most of the generated ambigrams were of poor quality.&lt;ref name="Polster174"/&gt;
However, the Ambimatic has been almost completely taken down (it was available on Ambigram.com, but they deleted that site and it is now a redirect to FlipScript.com), it's only available as [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ambimatic an app for Android]. In 2007, software developer Mark Hunter developed the ambigram generator at FlipScript.com (and licensed to other companies).&lt;ref name="Generators"/&gt; It uses a more complex method of creating ambigrams,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ambigrams.flipscript.com/ambigram-generator/|title=The Ambigram Generator|last=|first=|date=|website=flipscript.com|publisher=|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120708121017/http://ambigrams.flipscript.com/ambigram-generator/|archive-date=8 July 2012|dead-url=yes|access-date=6 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a database containing more than 5 million curves,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ambigrams.flipscript.com/ambigram-generator-part2/|title=Ambigram Generator, Part 2|last=|first=|date=|website=flipscript.com|publisher=|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120701105657/http://ambigrams.flipscript.com/ambigram-generator-part2/|archive-date=1 July 2012|dead-url=yes|access-date=6 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and multiple lettering styles.
In 2016, software developer Saransh Kejriwal composed a tutorial on designing rotational ambigrams, wherein he demonstrated a technique to count the number of vertical lines in the individual letters of the word to find the point of symmetry of the ambigram, which he called the Line technique.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kejriwal|first1=Saransh|title=Ambigram design for beginners|url=https://www.udemy.com/ambigram-design-for-beginners/learn/v4/overview|website=Udemy.com|publisher=Udemy|accessdate=18 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Americana''''' is a musical revue in two parts, with book and lyrics by [[J. P. McEvoy]], and music by [[Con Conrad]] with additional numbers by [[George Gershwin]], [[Ira Gershwin]], [[Philip Charig]], [[James F. Hanley|James Hanley]], [[B. G. DeSylva]], [[Morrie Ryskind]], [[Arthur Schwartz]], Theo Goodwin, [[Joe Young (lyricist)|Joe Young]], and [[Sam M. Lewis|Sam Lewis]]. The show was presented by Richard Herndon at the Belmont Theatre (121 W. 48th Street, New York, NY), and, after many postponements, opened July 26, 1926.&lt;ref name="Mantle, Burns p. 363"&gt;Mantle, Burns, Editor, "The Best Plays of 1926–1927", Dodd, Mead &amp; Company, p. 363.&lt;/ref&gt;  The show was staged by [[Allan Dinehart]] with dance numbers by Larry Ceballos. The production was designed by John Held, Jr. It ran for 224 performances, closing in February, 1927. &lt;ref name="thebroadwayleague"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ibdb.com/production.php?id=9800|title=Americana - IBDB: The official source for Broadway Information|author=The Broadway League|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The cast headlined [[Lew Brice]], [[Roy Atwell]], [[Betty Compton]], [[Charles Butterworth (actor)|Charles Butterworth]] and the Eddie Elkins Orchestra &lt;ref name="thebroadwayleague"/&gt; The New York Times review called it a "witty, ingenious and sophisticated evening of fun-making, it made up in its abundant humor for more than it lacked in some other departments."&lt;ref&gt;New York Times, July 27, 1926.&lt;/ref&gt;  The other departments referred to were lack of chorus girls and opulent settings. 

The revue was revived on October 30, 1928, at [[Brooks Atkinson Theatre|Lew Fields’ Mansfield Theatre]] for 12 performances, closing November 3, 1928.  It had music by [[Roger Wolfe Kahn]] and lyrics by J. P. McEvoy and [[Irving Caesar]] &lt;ref&gt;Mantle, Burns, Editor, "The Best Plays of 1928–1929", Dodd, Mead &amp; Company, p. 406.&lt;/ref&gt;  The cast included [[Frances Gershwin]], the younger sister of George and Ira Gershwin.&lt;ref name="thebroadwayleague"/&gt;  The New York Times review called it "a reasonably bright and generally entertaining revue . . ."&lt;ref&gt;New York Times, October 31, 1928.&lt;/ref&gt; 

After trying out in Philadelphia, the show was revived once again on October 5, 1932, at the [[Shubert Theatre (Broadway)|Shubert Theatre]] running for 77 performances, &lt;ref&gt;Mantle, Burns, Editor, "The Best Plays of 1932–1933", Dodd, Mead &amp; Company, p. 395.&lt;/ref&gt; until December 1932.  It was produced by [[Lee Shubert]] and had music by [[Jay Gorney]], [[Harold Arlen]], [[Herman Hupfeld]], and [[Richard Myers]], with lyrics by [[E. Y. Harburg]] and sketches by J. P. McEvoy.  It was directed by Harold Johnsrud with scenic design by Albert R. Johnson. &lt;ref name="thebroadwayleague"/&gt;  The cast included [[Don Barclay (actor) | Don Barclay]], [[George Givot]], [[Doris Humphrey]] Dance Group, [[Lloyd Nolan]], and the [[Charles Weidman]] Dancers.  It contained the famous song, “[[Brother, Can You Spare a Dime?]]”, which The New York Times review called "the first song of the year that can be sung . . . Mr. Gorney has expressed the spirit of these times with more heart-breaking anguish than any of the prose bards of the day."&lt;ref&gt;New York Times, October 6, 1932.&lt;/ref&gt; The show was also favorably reviewed for its dance numbers. &lt;ref&gt;New York Times, October 16, 1932.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Balduccilevitation.nwr.jpg|thumb|Artist's rendition (with background removed) of Balducci levitation, &lt;br&gt;named after Ed Balducci]]

The '''Balducci levitation''' is a [[Levitation (illusion)|levitation illusion]] first described by [[Ed Balducci]]. Its inventor is unknown. It is an [[impromptu]] [[magic (illusion)|magic trick]], which has been popularized by many magicians, such as [[David Roth]], [[Paul Harris (magician)|Paul Harris]], and [[David Blaine]].

== Effect ==
The performer stands at an angle facing away from the spectators. The performer appears to levitate a few inches above the ground. The effect generally does not last for more than five seconds. The performer's feet return to the ground, and the effect is complete.

== Advantages and disadvantages ==
Other methods of levitation allow for greater heights, longer durations, and better viewing angles (see definition of angles from [[List of conjuring terms]]) for performance; however, most of these methods can only be performed on a stage because they require special equipment or setups (such as wires).  The Balducci levitation requires no preparation of any kind, and so it can be performed impromptu – anytime, anywhere. Although variations have been made to improve the illusion of genuine levitation, they are generally harder to perform, and some require [[gimmick]]s or setups that make them less practical than the Balducci levitation.

== Misdirection ==
Like many magic effects, this illusion relies mostly on subtle [[misdirection (magic)|misdirection]] and [[acting]] on the part of the performer.

These psychological subtleties increase the probability that spectators will believe the illusion:
*The spectators are informed ahead of time the performer intends to levitate.
*The performer pretends to put a good deal of care in choosing a place to perform the levitation.
*The performer acts as if performing the levitation is difficult and physically straining.
*The performer emphasizes the fact that there are no gimmicks (wires, etc.) used, and encourages that the area and the performer's clothing be examined.
*The performer provides a reason for the audience's position: a warning he may fall and require them to catch him.

These physical subtleties make the levitation seem more amazing:
*The spectators are misdirected from the performer's method because they are concentrating on the movement of the feet and the space that appears between the feet and the ground.
* When "landing", the performer will make a point of hitting the ground hard with the feet, and bending the knees to convince the spectators that the performer's feet were higher in the air than they actually were.

The effects of these subtleties can be seen in David Blaine's television performances of this illusion. For example, one spectator is asked how high Blaine levitated. She gestures a height that is obviously a few inches higher than the illusion is capable of producing, demonstrating that subtleties can often cause a spectator's interpretation of an effect to be better than the effect itself.

== Method ==
The magician positions himself at an angle to his audience, a little distance away, in such a way that the audience can only see the rearward portion of one foot and most of the other foot&amp;nbsp;– concealing the toe end of the "far" (upstage) foot.  The audience group must be small enough that they can be grouped close together. The magician, with the rearward portion of his feet held together, lifts the "near" foot off the ground, standing on only the front part of his "far" foot (the one which is partially concealed) while lifting the rearward part of the "far" foot and all of the "near" foot and keeping his ankles together. The audience sees only one foot and the heel of the other (the "far" foot), which appear to rise off the floor.  The hidden part of the "far" (upstage) foot supports the weight of the magician as he appears to levitate one or two inches.

Simply put: the magician stands on the front of one foot, while raising the one foot and the visible part of his other foot, blocking the view of the front of the supporting foot with the other foot and rear part of the supporting foot.

The ''reverse Balducci'' illusion is similar to the Balducci illusion, but the magician faces towards the audience at a 90-degree angle rather than facing away.  The magician slowly stands on the heel of his "far" foot as he lifts his "near" foot and the front of the "far" foot.  To improve the appearance of the effect, the magician will try to maintain the near foot parallel to the ground.

Another variation that is sometimes shown on TV shows is done by performing a normal "Balducci", filming the audience reaction, then later returning and performing the illusion with the aid of wires to get more height or to get a shot from the front or underneath. These shots will be edited into the footage of the original performance, thus allowing the levitation effect to be exaggerated, while still using genuine onlookers in the shot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.learnmagictricks.org/ebook/david_blaines_magic_revealed.pdf|title=David Blaine's Magic Tricks Revealed!|accessdate=2007-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a principle in theatrical magic that "the audience will often remember or describe an exaggerated effect"{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}&amp;nbsp;– so the audience members may not notice the increased height caused by the "faked second shot" (if the additional height is not more than a few extra centimeters) when watching the combined footage later, believing that they are seeing a genuine recreation of the performance.  This is even more likely if, during the original performance, cameras are positioned in the same place as those from which the "faked" footage was later shot.

== History ==
[[Ed Balducci]] published the first known description of the illusion in July 1974 in ''The Pallbearer's Review'', (Volume 9, Number 9, pp 755) under the name "Impromptu Levitation." Balducci ended his description by saying, "Originator unknown. It was shown to me many years ago by one of the [[Harmonicats]], a cousin of mine, Erwin Levine, known as the Baron."

Despite Balducci's disclaimer, the illusion has since been known as the "Balducci levitation".

== Known variations ==
*Antigravity boots by [[Peter Marvey]]
*[[King levitation]] by Corey King
*Criss Angel's Levitation by [[Criss Angel]]
*Sooperman by [[Paul Harris (magician)|Paul Harris]]
*Zero Gravity by Mike Bent

==Appearances in popular media==
* The "Reverse Balducci" is performed by Wade's crew members in the film ''[[You Got Served]]''.
* The "Reverse Balducci" is performed and mentioned by name in issue 25 of the comic book series ''[[Y: The Last Man]]''.
* ''[[Hotel Babylon]]'' S3E7 features a character (Dan Black) loosely based on David Blaine, who performs the illusion in the lift; later one of the main characters (Anna) shows the other hotel staff (but not the viewer) how the illusion is performed.
* In the movie [[John Dies at the End (film)|''John Dies at the End'']], when Dave goes to a party and hears a girl gasp that a man just levitated off the ground, he asks how high and scoffs, "Let me guess, about six inches above the grass right? Balducci levitation?"

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2550">'''Biograph Girl''' was a phrase associated with two early-20th-century actresses, [[Florence Lawrence]] and [[Mary Pickford]], who  made black-and-white silent films with the [[Biograph Company]]. At that time, all studios refused to give actors on-screen film credit; they did not want them to gain public celebrity status and command higher salaries. This had already happened with stage actors, and the studios did not want to repeat the trend on film.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web

|accessdate=2012-07-23
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the actors were mainly anonymous, the public and news media began to call the popular actress [[Florence Lawrence]] the "Biograph girl". In 1910, Lawrence was lured away from Biograph by [[Carl Laemmle]] when he started his new [[Independent Motion Picture Company]], known as IMP (he later founded [[Universal Studios]] in 1913). Laemmle wanted Lawrence to be his star attraction so he offered her more money ($250 a week) and marquee billing—something Biograph did not allow at the time.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; She signed on with him; Laemmle had rumors of her death circulated in the press and later took out advertisements criticizing the same rumors. This publicity, timed with the release of her first IMP film ''[[The Broken Oath]]'' (1910), made her a household name. She quickly became the first film star with celebrity status, and the first person to receive billing on the credits of her film. From then on, other actors slowly began to receive billing credit on film.

After Lawrence left Biograph, Mary Pickford began gaining in popularity with the studio and was soon nicknamed the new "Biograph Girl" until she, too, received billing credits in her films.

Coincidentally, both Lawrence and Pickford were both originally from [[Ontario, Canada]]; Pickford was from [[Toronto]], and Lawrence from [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]]. As well, both were raised by their mothers, as their fathers died within a week of each other (in unrelated accidents) in February 1898.

'''Bleeding Cool''' is an Internet news site, focusing on comics, TV, film, and games. Owned by [[Avatar Press]], it was launched by [[Rich Johnston]] on 27 March 2009, and has gone through several iterations of design, and many forum changes. Avatar also publishes an associated magazine, ''Bleeding Cool''.

== Reputation ==
Bleeding Cool has a reputation within the industry for spreading previously secretive information far and wide. John Cunningham, VP Content Strategy at [[DC Comics|DC Entertainment]], told DC All Access presenter [[Miss Alaska USA|Tiffany Smith]] on stage at San Diego Comic-Con, on whether she could reveal some information, "It was on Bleeding Cool this morning. The whole world knows."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=[[Johnston, Rich]]|url=https://www.bleedingcool.com/2014/07/29/and-finally-dc-comics-john-cunningham-on-bleeding-cool/|title=And Finally... DC Comics' John Cunningham On Bleeding Cool|date=July 29, 2014|website=Bleeding Cool}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 Marvel Senior Vice President of Publishing and Executive Editor [[Tom Brevoort]] referred to Bleeding Cool when talking about the revelation that [[Marvel Entertainment]] CEO [[Isaac Perlmutter]] had personally intervened to cancel the [[Fantastic Four]] comics in his dispute with [[20th Century Fox|Fox Studios]], saying "Seriously, if there wasn't a website stirring all of this stuff up, can you honestly say that you would even have noticed anything here?"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Johnston, Rich|url=https://www.bleedingcool.com/2015/01/13/bleeding-cool-endorsement-tom-brevoort/|title=A Bleeding Cool Endorsement From Tom Brevoort?|date=January 13, 2015|website=Bleeding Cool}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
Among Bleeding Cool's features are a power list detailing the most influential people in the comics industry.&lt;ref&gt;Truitt, Brian (November 27, 2013).

In 2012, Bleeding Cool was the first to report on sexual harassment accusations leveled against [[DC Comics]] editor [[Eddie Berganza]], beginning with an incident at [[WonderCon]] in [[Anaheim, California]]. Though that initial article was a blind item that did not name the victim or accused, four years later, Bleeding Cool named Berganza when it accused him of sexual harassment, and detailed how he had risen in the ranks at DC even after the accusations became known to his employers. This was followed by a November 2017 [[BuzzFeed]] report on accusations leveled against Berganza by several women that led to his termination from DC.&lt;ref&gt;Gaudette, Emily (November 13, 2017).

[[The Verge]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2017, Bleeding Cool broke the story that writer/editor [[C.B. Cebulski]], who had recently been promoted to Editor in Chief of Marvel Comics, had written a number of Japanese-themed stories for Marvel in 2003 and 2004 under the pseudonym Akira Yoshida, which led to accusations of [[cultural appropriation]], [[Portrayal of East Asians in American film and theater|yellowfacing]], and "Orientalist profiteering".&lt;ref name=Atlantic&gt;Elbein, Asher (December 17, 2017).

'''''Bombshell''''' is a [[Top-down shooter|top-down]] [[action game|action]] [[role-playing game]] developed by [[Interceptor Entertainment]] and published by [[3D Realms]]. The game was released on January 29, 2016 for [[Microsoft Windows]], with [[PlayStation 4]] and [[Xbox One]] release dates to be announced later. The game runs on [[Unreal Engine 3]].

==Plot==
The game allows the player to control Shelly "Bombshell" Harrison, a [[Colonel]] in the Global Defense Force. Her career is abruptly brought to an end after an event titled "the Washington Incident", which caused her to lose her arm and her team. Shelly is then offered a new contract by a private military contractor and offered a second chance and a new mechanical arm.

==Development==
The game was conceived during [[Gearbox Software]]'s lawsuit against Interceptor regarding the video game ''Duke Nukem: Mass Destruction''. Interceptor was working on the game for the PlayStation 4 and PC, however due to a lawsuit by [[Gearbox Software]], the game's name was changed to ''Bombshell'' and the main character was changed to Shelly Harrison who was originally meant to play a supporting role in the [[Duke Nukem]] game.&lt;ref name= "Polygon"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.polygon.com/2014/5/14/5719040/bombshell-is-3d-realms-and-interceptor-entertainments-action-rpg-for|title= Bombshell is 3D Realms and Interceptor Entertainment's action RPG for PC, PS4|author= Jenna Pitcher|work= [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|publisher= [[Vox Media]]|date= May 14, 2014|accessdate= September 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= " Verge"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2015/3/4/8145901/bombshell-3d-realms-duke-nukem|title=Bombshell looks and sounds like a Duke Nukem game starring a bionic woman|first=Chris|last=Plante|work=[[The Verge]]|date=March 4, 2015|accessdate=November 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2014, a website NoGumNeeded.com was launched by Interceptor Entertainment that showed a countdown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.polygon.com/2014/4/15/5617286/duke-nukem-teaser-site-lawsuit-interceptor-gearbox|title= Teaser site hints at Interceptor game with Duke Nukem removed|author= Owen S.

It is light on the RPG side, with little depth to sink your teeth into".&lt;ref name="GWTW"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gonewiththewin.com/someone-has-set-us-up-the-bombshell-review/ |title=Someone has set us up the Bombshell: Review |publisher=GoneWithTheWin |accessdate=2016-01-29 |first=Leo|last=Espada}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has a score of 44% on [[Metacritic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/bombshell|title=Bombshell|website=Metacritic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Chajchas''''' (also ''chapchas''; [[Spanish language|Spanish]]: ''uñas'', "toenails") are a small [[percussion instrument]] of the [[Rattle_(percussion_instrument)|rattle]] family, typically made from [[Capra_(genus)|goat]] or [[sheep]] hooves, and originating in the [[Andes|Central Andes]]. The instrument is used in traditional rituals and ceremonies, and can also be heard in much of the folk music of the region,&lt;ref&gt;http://kuntur_huasi.en.eresmas.com/instrumentos/chajchas.htm&lt;/ref&gt; especially the countries of [[Colombia]], [[Bolivia]], [[Peru]], [[Chile]], [[Ecuador]].&lt;ref&gt;http://makingmulticulturalmusic.wordpress.com/2013/05/24/chapchas-a-rattle-made-from-the-toenails-of-goats/&lt;/ref&gt;

It consists of a number of dried [[Hoof|hooves]] (which may also come from [[llamas]] or [[alpacas]]) strung onto a colorful piece of fabric, often elasticated, which allows the instrument to be worn as a bracelet around the wrist or ankle. They are typically played in pairs, and may be used in [[Ceremonial_dance|ceremonial dances]].&lt;ref&gt;http://saintpaulsunday.publicradio.org/features/9705_rumillajta/docs/inst_percussion.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.7at.net/Chajchas.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Chrono Trigger: Crimson Echoes''''' is a [[fangame]] developed by the international team Kajar Laboratories as a [[ROM hacking|ROM hack]] of [[Square (company)|Square]]'s [[role-playing video game]] ''[[Chrono Trigger]]'' for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]]. It was conceived as an unofficial installment in the ''[[Chrono (series)|Chrono]]'' series, set between the events of ''Chrono Trigger'' and its sequel ''[[Chrono Cross]]''.

The game, as a ROM hack, runs on the ''Chrono Trigger'' [[game engine]] and has gameplay similar to the original. It is based five years after the events of ''Chrono Trigger'' and features all the playable characters from the original game, who come together across different time periods to fight an enemy attempting to change the past.  The plot includes  elements from both official games. ''Crimson Echoes'' concludes by setting up several plot points that were used in ''Chrono Cross''.

The project was in development from 2004–09, with 98% of the game completed. The game reportedly totaled around 35&amp;nbsp;hours of play time, and had ten alternate endings. A few weeks prior to the expected released date, [[Square Enix]] sent the developers a [[Cease and desist|cease-and-desist]] letter for knowingly violating Square Enix's [[intellectual property]], which led to the cancellation of the project. This cancellation was widely reported in the gaming press, who were largely sympathetic to the project. Despite its cancellation, versions of the game ranging from an [[Software release life cycle#Alpha|alpha]] to a [[Software release life cycle#Release candidate|release candidate]] have since been leaked onto the internet and can be played through to the end.

{{see also|Chrono Trigger#Gameplay|l1=Gameplay of Chrono Trigger}}

As ''Crimson Echoes'' runs on the ''Chrono Trigger'' [[game engine]], the gameplay is similar to that of the original title.&lt;ref name="wired"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2009/05/square-enix-kills-near-complete-chrono-trigger-fan-project/|title=Square Enix Kills Near Complete Chrono Trigger Fan Project|first=Earnest|last=Cavalli|date=May 11, 2009|work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired.com]]|publisher=[[Condé Nast]]|accessdate=May 8, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090514070509/http://www.wired.com/gamelife/2009/05/square-enix-kills-near-complete-chrono-trigger-fan-project|archivedate=May 14, 2009|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Players and enemies may use physical or magical attacks to wound targets during battle, and players may use items to heal or protect themselves. Each character and enemy has a certain number of [[hit point]]s that are reduced by successful attacks and can be restored through potions and spells. When a playable character loses all hit points, he or she faints. It also uses the [[Active Time Battle]] 2.0 system from the first game. The game features new maps, graphics and sprites.&lt;ref name="ceplot"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://crimsonechoes.com/Plot.html|title=Crimson Echoes: Plot|date=March 4, 2010| publisher=Kajar Laboratories|accessdate=May 8, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323162840/http://crimsonechoes.com/Plot.html|archivedate=March 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; New [[minigame]]s were designed to reward players with items and equipment, including a "Coliseum" battle mode based on that of ''[[Final Fantasy VII]]'' and a [[casino]] featuring luck-based games.

==Characters==
{{see also|Characters of Chrono Trigger|l1=List of Chrono Trigger characters}}

''Crimson Echoes'' features all the playable characters of the original game, and is set five years after the events of ''Chrono Trigger''.&lt;ref name="ceplot"/&gt; [[Crono (Chrono Trigger)|Crono]] and [[Characters of Chrono Trigger#Marle|Marle]] are junior regents of the Kingdom of Guardia; [[Characters of Chrono Trigger#Lucca|Lucca]] continues her scientific endeavors. The three struggle to ease tensions with Porre, which has modernized its military and seeks to end Guardia's economic hegemony. [[Characters of Chrono Trigger#Frog|Frog]] lives in 605&amp;nbsp;A.D., restored to his human form, though this was not implemented before the cease and desist letter. [[Characters of Chrono Trigger#Magus|Magus]] searches for Schala in the still-frozen 11,995&amp;nbsp;B.C., and feuds with Dalton, obsessed with finding artifacts from the lost Kingdom of Zeal. [[Characters of Chrono Trigger#Ayla|Ayla]] dwells in 64,999,995&amp;nbsp;B.C., and has given birth to her tribe's successor. [[Characters of Chrono Trigger#Robo|Robo]] assists the Guru of Reason, Belthasar, who has established a clandestine temporal research facility named Chronopolis in 2305&amp;nbsp;A.D. Belthasar claims it will be a guardian of time to ensure a threat such as [[Characters of Chrono Trigger#Lavos|Lavos]] will never arise. He nonetheless harbors darker wishes to leave a grand legacy in history, and is almost recklessly pragmatic. He fixes the Epoch during the story's course, which returns as the Neo-Epoch (akin to its design in ''Chrono Cross'').&lt;ref name="ceplot"/&gt;

The main villain of ''Crimson Echoes'' is King Zeal, revived by Lavos through the Frozen Flame. Confused and saddened by the loss of his kingdom, he is easily manipulated by Lavos, who uses him to attempt revenge on Crono and his friends. He later learns of his deception, and seeks to dominate Lavos and recreate his kingdom through unmatched temporal power. While under Lavos's influence, he recruits Dalton and Kasmir to his cause. Kasmir is an illusionist who served under Magus in the Mystic War. King Zeal gives him the Masamune, and he assumes leadership of the Mystics after 600&amp;nbsp;A.D. Other foes come from the Reptite timeline, an alternate universe temporarily brought into existence by King Zeal's meddling. They number the Dragon God—a Reptite artificial intelligence created in an alternate timeline—and the Xamoltan time travelers, who were used by King Zeal and survive into the restored human world. The party also visit 1&amp;nbsp;A.D., the era of the founding of Guardia. There, they meet Cedric the Executor, the ruthless first King of Guardia, as well as Antaeus, the ancestor of Porre.&lt;ref name="ceplot"/&gt;

==Plot==
The game begins as Crono, Marle, and Lucca attend a political meeting between the Kingdom of Guardia and Porre. An assassin attacks; the party pursues him to the Denadoro Mts., where Lucca's prototype Time Egg backfires and sends them to the future. They find Belthasar there, who has established a research facility called Chronopolis. He warns of a new threat to the timeline, and sends the party to the Ocean Palace ruins of 11,995&amp;nbsp;B.C. to investigate. They find Magus, still searching for Schala and feuding with Dalton. They confront a mysterious villain who resurrects Schala and robs the early Masamune, still embedded in the husk of the Mammon Machine. Its theft changes history, causing the Mystics' war in the Middle Ages to drag on another 50&amp;nbsp;years, led by the illusionist Kasmir. The party retrieve Frog (named Glenn in ''Crimson Echoes'') from 605&amp;nbsp;A.D. and meet with Belthasar.&lt;ref name="ceplot"/&gt;

He explains the mysterious villain was King Zeal, somehow alive and in possession of the Frozen Flame, a shard of Lavos with incredible powers. Melchior takes up residence in Chronopolis to aid the fight against him. The party goes to 64,999,995&amp;nbsp;B.C. to find the Dragon's Tooth, an enchanted totem that will assist Chronopolis. King Zeal confronts them at the old Lavos impact crater, scattering them through time and unleashing the "Atash Kedah", a destructive spell that changes history. Marle awakens in 1&amp;nbsp;A.D. to discover Reptites have survived the long ice age, and war with humanity for control of the planet.&lt;ref name="gamesradar"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.gamesradar.com/10-fan-games-that-shouldnt-be-ceased-or-desisted/| title=10 fan games that shouldn't be ceased or desisted|first=Oliver J.|last=Chiang|date=February 18, 2010|work=[[GamesRadar]]|publisher=[[Future US]]|accessdate=May 8, 2011|page=1|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141113072431/http://www.gamesradar.com/10-fan-games-that-shouldnt-be-ceased-or-desisted/|archivedate=November 13, 2014|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lucca and Robo arrive in 2305&amp;nbsp;A.D., awaking in the midst of a futuristic Reptite civilization. They ally with rebellious, sentient robots and venture to Dinopolis, the equivalent of Chronopolis in this timeline. They destroy the Vision Serpent, an artificial intelligence created to administrate the world. Crono, Magus, and Glenn awaken in 1005&amp;nbsp;A.D., and assault the earlier Dinopolis, where Reptite time travelers from 2305&amp;nbsp;A.D. have come to conduct research on the past. The party use the temporal technology in place to return to 64,999,995&amp;nbsp;B.C. and stop the Atash Kedah spell, restoring the human timeline.&lt;ref name="ceplot"/&gt;

Marle awakens in 1&amp;nbsp;A.D. once more, this time witnessing her ancestor, Cedric Guardia, brutally unify the world with the Frozen Flame. A ubiquitous agent from Chronopolis—code-named 12—brings her back to the future. The party learn that the Reptite time travelers—named Cakulha, Coyopa, and Yaluk—survived the human world's restoration, and had been manipulated by King Zeal. The party fix the Mystic War by retrieving the Masamune from Kasmir and putting it back in antiquity. In 1005&amp;nbsp;A.D., new diplomatic talks are about to begin. Porre instead launches an assault, backed by King Zeal and Dalton, placed in Porre's high command by the king. King Guardia dies in the attack. The party venture to 11,995&amp;nbsp;B.C. once more with Schala, intent on striking the Frozen Flame in antiquity to lure out King Zeal. This unleashes wild energies, and the party must overcome individual mental assaults by the Flame. King Zeal retreats, and the energies cause Schala to fall into the Darkness Beyond Time, a temporal netherworld. Unsuccessful, the party seek out Gaspar tens of millions of years in the past (known as the Dreamtime), where he's gone to witness the birth of the planet's consciousness. King Zeal attacks them there; Crono falls near the rifts of the forming planet and is partly infused with its natal awareness. The party learn that King Zeal's ultimate goal is to resurrect the Kingdom of Zeal in 11,995&amp;nbsp;B.C.&lt;ref name="ceplot"/&gt;

The party return to antiquity and defeat Dalton. King Zeal nears the fruition of his plan, but Melchior and Belthasar enter the time period to dissuade him. King Zeal leaves the Sun Stone, the trigger for the revival of Zeal, with a follower and walks to the North Cape. He reveals that Lavos survived defeat in ''Chrono Trigger'' and clung to life in the Darkness Beyond Time. He used the Frozen Flame to revive King Zeal, manipulating him to take revenge on the heroes. He is now merging with Schala, as he has done with all the other "Arbiters" who have used the Frozen Flame throughout history. Lavos calls King Zeal, intending to merge with him as well and evolve to become the Dream Devourer (as seen in ''Chrono Trigger DS''). The party convince Zeal's followers not to activate the Sun Stone, and pursue Zeal to the Darkness Beyond Time. King Zeal confronts them once more, revealing his will is stronger than that of Lavos; he'll merge, but become the dominant personality within the Dream Devourer and create a new Zeal using its vast power. The party defeat him and return to Chronopolis. They notice the planet's Gates are closing again, and depart to their homes, promising to stay in touch. Belthasar meanwhile reveals he has the Frozen Flame, which activates and informs him that Lavos is still alive and will become the Time Devourer, the enemy of ''Chrono Cross''. It challenges Belthasar to a grand game, and he begins drawing up plans for Project Kid. The game closes with King Zeal, shown to be alive and imprisoned by Magus in 11,995&amp;nbsp;B.C., who forces him to teach advanced temporal magic.&lt;ref name="ceplot"/&gt;

The ''Crimson Echoes'' project was launched by ZeaLitY in 2004.&lt;ref name="gamesradar"/&gt; The development team, dubbed Kajar Laboratories, primarily consisted of members of the ''Chrono'' fansite Chrono Compendium.&lt;ref name="1up"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/features/posthumous-cult-favorites-games-endure?pager.offset=1 |title=Posthumous Cult Gaming: Games That Endure |first=Bob |last=Mackey |date=March 17, 2010 |publisher=[[1UP.com]] |accessdate=May 8, 2011 |pages=2–3 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Qg2KMdVb?url=http://www.1up.com/features/posthumous-cult-favorites-games-endure?pager.offset=1 |archivedate=June 28, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The team was led by a game director, Agent 12, and two co-directors, ZeaLitY and Chrono'99. To create a story that was compatible with ''Chrono Trigger'' and ''Chrono Cross'', the team took full advantage of the Chrono Compendium's encyclopedia and the fandom's knowledge and analysis of the series.&lt;ref name="1up"/&gt;

The game took the form of a [[ROM hacking|ROM hack]] of the Super Nintendo Entertainment System version of ''Chrono Trigger''.&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2009/may/21/game-theory-copyright|title=Game theory: Fans should be embraced, not treated as criminals|first=Keith|last=Stuart|date=May 21, 2009|publisher=''[[The Guardian]]''|accessdate=May 8, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150120192753/http://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2009/may/21/game-theory-copyright|archivedate=January 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was coded using ''Chrono Trigger'' ROM editing software,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Muñoz Sánchez|first=Pablo|editor1-last=Kockaert|editor1-first=Hendrik J.|editor2-last=Lommel|editor2-first=Arle|year=2009|title=Video Game Localisation for Fans by Fans: The Case of Romhacking|journal=The Journal of Internationalisation and Localisation|volume=1|page=181|location=[[Antwerp]], [[Belgium]]|publisher=[[Lessius Hogeschool|Lessius University College]]|issn=2032-6904|oclc=661095707|accessdate=May 8, 2011|url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/jbp/jial/2009/00000001/00000001/art00007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was meant to be played on a Super Nintendo Entertainment System emulator. The finished game was intended to be released as a [[Patch (computing)|patch]] file in the IPS (International Patching System) format, so as to avoid illegal distribution of a full ''Chrono Trigger'' ROM.&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt;

The project lasted four and a half years, with a planned release date of May 31, 2009.&lt;ref name= "cnet"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ce"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://crimsonechoes.com|title=Crimson Echoes|author=ZeaLitY| date=August 12, 2009|publisher=Kajar Laboratories|accessdate=May 8, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120513103111/http://crimsonechoes.com/|archivedate=May 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Square Enix sent ZeaLitY and Agent 12 a [[Cease and desist|cease-and-desist]] letter on May 8, 2009 for trademark and [[copyright infringement]], ordering that the team stop development and cancel all ROM hacking activities,&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt; including translation and distribution of all their other projects that were in progress or already released.&lt;ref name="cnet"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.cnet.com/news/square-enix-pulls-rug-from-under-chrono-sequel/|title=Square Enix pulls rug from under Chrono sequel|first=Eric|last=Franklin|date=May 14, 2009|publisher=[[cNET.com|CNET]]|accessdate=May 8, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025003352/http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-10240371-1.html|archivedate=October 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The letter noted that ZeaLitY and Agent 12 risked being sued for "up to [[US dollar|$]]150,000 per work" in damages.&lt;ref name="wired"/&gt; At the time of the cancellation, the game was "around 98% complete"; it allegedly featured 23 story chapters adding up to roughly 35&amp;nbsp;hours of gameplay and ten [[Types of fiction with multiple endings|alternate ending]]s.&lt;ref name="gamesradar"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ce"/&gt;

==Internet circulation==
Shortly after the project received the cease and desist letter, an [[Software release life cycle#Alpha|alpha version]] of the patch was leaked on the internet. ZeaLitY expressed his disapproval and embarrassment on the Crimson Echoes website, noting that the alpha version was extremely buggy and lacked many of the improvements made in the [[Software release life cycle#Beta|beta version]].&lt;ref name="ce" /&gt; In January 2011, a more complete beta version was leaked which could be played from beginning to end, believed to be the final build of the project prior to cancellation.&lt;ref name="Leak1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.joystiq.com/2011/01/18/fan-made-chrono-trigger-sequel-finds-release/|title=Fan-made Chrono Trigger sequel finds release|first=Mike|last=Schramm |date=January 18, 2011 |publisher=[[Joystiq]] |accessdate=April 7, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150131112645/http://www.joystiq.com/2011/01/18/fan-made-chrono-trigger-sequel-finds-release/|archivedate=January 31, 2015|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, "Chrono Trigger: Flames of Eternity" was [[Fork (software)|forked]] from an Crimson Echoes around 2010 with the aim to fully complete the game's development, switching from using the earlier version as a base to the latest released version.&lt;ref&gt;[http://metronomeproject.blogspot.de/2010/10/new-home-for-status-updates-on-chrono.html New Home for Status Updates on Chrono Trigger: Flames of Eternity!] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180418185216/http://metronomeproject.blogspot.de/2010/10/new-home-for-status-updates-on-chrono.html |date=2018-04-18 }} on metronomeproject (2010)&lt;/ref&gt; Development was ongoing until June 2017.&lt;ref&gt;[http://metronomeproject.blogspot.de/2017/06/something-in-works.html something in works] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180418185216/http://metronomeproject.blogspot.de/2017/06/something-in-works.html |date=2018-04-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reaction==
Kajar Laboratories complied with the cease-and-desist letter and all traces of ''Crimson Echoes'' were removed from the Chrono Compendium.&lt;ref name="1up"/&gt; [[cNET.com|CNET]] senior associate editor Eric Franklin noted that it was "sad to see four and a half years of work go spinning down the drain", stating: "I feel for the fans who were anticipating this."&lt;ref name="cnet"/&gt; [[1UP.com]] called the project "ambitious," noting that "This wasn't just some fly-by-night hack."&lt;ref name= "1up"/&gt; Earnest Cavalli, from [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]], stated: "I fully understand Square Enix's desire to protect its properties, but that doesn't make this any less depressing. The game looked quite good (if obviously derivative)."&lt;ref name="wired"/&gt; The project's cancellation was also reported by gaming journalists in the Netherlands,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://gamer.nl/articles/nieuws/square-enix-roept-officieuze-chrono-trigger-2-halt-toe/|title=Square Enix roept officieuze Chrono Trigger 2 halt toe|first=Youri|last=Dechesne|date=May 11, 2009|publisher=Gamer.nl |accessdate=May 8, 2011|language=Dutch|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130325000119/http://www.gamer.nl/nieuws/51542/square-enix-roept-officieuze-chrono-trigger-2-halt-toe|archivedate=March 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; France,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.generation-nt.com/chrono-trigger-crimson-echoes-projet-amateur-rom-hack-actualite-738761.html|title=Chrono Trigger: Crimson Echoes annulé par Square Enix|first=Fabien|last=H.|date=May 13, 2009|publisher= Génération-NT|accessdate=May 8, 2011|language=French|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120911022334/http://www.generation-nt.com/chrono-trigger-crimson-echoes-projet-amateur-rom-hack-actualite-738761.html|archivedate=September 11, 2012|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.gamespark.jp/article/2009/05/23/18856.html|script-title=ja:スクエニが4年掛かりの海外ファンプロジェクトを差し止め → 一部から批判の声|author=riot_兄|date=May 23, 2009|publisher=Game Spark|accessdate=May 8, 2011|language= Japanese|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100128103016/http://gs.inside-games.jp/news/188/18856.html|archivedate=January 28, 2010|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2010, [[GamesRadar]] included the game in an article about the "10 fan games that shouldn't be ceased or desisted".&lt;ref name="gamesradar"/&gt;

Keith Stuart, from ''[[The Guardian]]'', pointed out the contrast between Square Enix's policy and that of companies like [[Valve Corporation|Valve]], which officially adopted the ''[[Half-Life (video game)|Half-Life]]'' fan [[mod (video gaming)|mods]] ''[[Counter-Strike]]'' and ''[[Day of Defeat]]'', and [[Vivendi Games|Vivendi Universal Games]], which granted a licence to the ''[[King's Quest]]'' fan game ''[[The Silver Lining (video game)|The Silver Lining]]''. He noted that since ''Crimson Echoes'' was a ROM hack, it was in a "trickier area of copy protection law" than those other projects, but felt that its release would have had next to no commercial impact since the game was to be distributed as an IPS patch rather than a ROM image. Finally, he noted that an official port of the fangame to the [[Nintendo DS]] or [[WiiWare]] would have had more "marketing benefits" for Square Enix.&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt;

'''Cirque Éloize''' is a [[Montreal]]-born [[contemporary circus]] company founded in 1993 by Daniel Cyr, Claudette Morin and Jeannot Painchaud. Julie Hamelin, because of her important contribution to the company, is also considered as one of the cofounders.

Since 2004, Cirque Éloize' headquarters and creation studio are located in [[Old Montreal]], inside the former [[Dalhousie Station (Montreal)|Dalhousie Station]], a historical building where the National circus school of Montreal was based from 1989 to 2003, and also where the company's founders studied.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ecolenationaledecirque.ca/en/choose-ncs/circus-artists-graduates/testimonials|title=Testimonials - École nationale de cirque|last=|first=|date=|website=Ecole nationale de cirque|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cirque Éloize creates shows destined for indoor tours and sometimes for the big top. At other times, it creates custom shows for the [[Dalhousie Station (Montreal)|Dalhousie Station]], or for client chosen venues.

Cirque Éloize has carried out more than 5 000 performances in over 550 cities and 50 countries. Its repertoire is composed of 15 key shows, and it has performed in excess of 1 600 custom-made shows across the world. The company has reached more than 3 million spectators.

The company has roughly a hundred employees spread between its headquarters, tour shows and special international events.

== Name Origins ==
"''Éloize''" means "[[heat lightning]]" in [[Acadian French]] ("''éclair de chaleur''" in [[Standard French]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://grandquebec.com/theatres-du-quebec/cirque-eloize/ The history of Cirque Éloize]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cirque-eloize.ru Цирк Элуаз]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cirque-eloize.com/en/shows/id Cirque Éloize, Jeannot Painchaud]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cirque-eloize.com/en/shows/cirkopolis Cirkopolis, Cirque Éloize]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cirque-eloize.com/en/news Cirque Éloize, news English]&lt;/ref&gt; The word appears to come from Saintongese language (of western [[France]]), but has appeared at least once (spelled "eloise") in a book written by [[Montaigne]] in classical French.

It is used in [[Acadia]] and in the [[Magdalen Islands]]; islands from which the artists of the first Cirque Éloize troupe were all natives of. The thunderbolt depicts their acrobatic and spectacular side and the heat, their humanity that wishes to touch the heart and soul.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.lavoixdelest.ca/arts/le-cirque-eloize-debarque-en-ville-2a6510b4b3c5c1ec17d3223f90ce9b4c|title=Le Cirque Éloize débarque en ville|date=2018-04-07|work=La Voix de l'Est|access-date=2018-06-26|language=fr-CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cyr Wheel ==
Daniel Cyr, cofounder of Cirque Éloize, invented the [[Cyr wheel|Cyr Wheel]] and popularized it by obtaining a silver medal with his act at the Festival mondial du cirque de demain in 2003. The [[Cyr wheel|Cyr Wheel]] has since then been present in the majority of Cirque Éloize' creations. Having become an entire discipline of its own, the technique is now taught in many professional schools and used by numerous artists from various countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.fedec.eu/file/249/download|title=Manuel pedagogique Roue Cyr|last=Demey (coordination)|first=Sven|publisher=FEDEC - Federation europeenne des ecoles de cirque profesionnelles (in French)|year=2011|isbn=|location=|pages=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tailored events and concepts ==
Cirque Éloize designs, creates and produces tailored concepts and events for corporate, private or governmental clients in its [[Dalhousie Station (Montreal)|Dalhousie Station]] venues, and across the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tourisme-montreal.org/Meeting-Planners/Off-site-Venues/cirque-eloize|title=Cirque Eloize - Off-site Venues - Tourism Montreal|last=|first=|date=|website=Tourism Montreal|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than 1 600 custom-made events have been carried around the globe, in varying contexts and locations.

In 2006, Cirque Éloize collaborated in the [[2006 Winter Olympics|Turin Winter Olympic Games]] Closing Ceremony, in 2012, in the inauguration of the [[Jaeger-LeCoultre|Jaeger-Lecoultre]] boutique at [[Place Vendôme]] Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cirque-eloize.com/fr/actualite/cirque-eloize-evenements-speciaux-a-linauguration-de-boutique-jaeger-lecoultre-a-paris/|title=Cirque Eloize inauguration boutique Paris|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2016, in l'Heure Bleue, an exclusive show presented all summer long as part of Montreal city's 375th anniversary festivities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cirque-eloize.com/app/uploads/2017/04/cmq_devoilement-gt_en.pdf|title=Montreal's 375 festivities with Cirque Eloize|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cirque Éloize was a featured company at the first edition of the [[Biennale Internationale des Arts du Cirque]] in 2015.

}}'''Detective fiction''' is a subgenre of [[crime fiction]] and [[mystery fiction]] in which an [[criminal investigation|investigator]] or a [[detective]]—either professional, amateur or retired—investigates a crime, often [[murder]]. The detective genre began around the same time as [[speculative fiction]] and other [[genre fiction]] in the mid-nineteenth century and has remained extremely popular, particularly in novels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Victorian Tales of Mystery and Detection: An Oxford Anthology|last=Michael|first=Cox|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1992|isbn=978-0192123084|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the most famous heroes of detective fiction include [[C. Auguste Dupin]], [[Sherlock Holmes]], and [[Hercule Poirot]]. Juvenile stories featuring [[The Hardy Boys]], [[Nancy Drew]], and [[The Boxcar Children]] have also remained in print for several decades.

==Beginnings of detective fiction==
===In ancient literature===
Some scholars, such as R. H. Pfeiffer,  have suggested that certain ancient and religious texts bear similarities to what would later be called detective fiction. In the Old Testament story of [[Susanna (Book of Daniel: 13)|Susanna and the Elders]] (the [[Protestant]] [[Bible]] locates this story within the [[apocrypha]]), the account told by two witnesses broke down when [[Daniel (biblical figure)|Daniel]] cross-examines them. In response, author [[Julian Symons]] has argued that "those who search for fragments of detection in the Bible and Herodotus are looking only for puzzles" and that these puzzles are not detective stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Scaggs|first=John|title=Crime Fiction (The New Critical Idiom)|year=2005|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0415318259|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the play ''[[Oedipus Rex]]'' by [[Ancient Greek]] playwright [[Sophocles]], the protagonist discovers the truth about his origins after questioning various witnesses. Although "Oedipus's enquiry is based on supernatural, pre-rational methods that are evident in most narratives of crime until the development of Enlightenment thought in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries", this narrative has "all of the central characteristics and formal elements of the detective story, including a mystery surrounding a murder, a closed circle of suspects, and the gradual uncovering of a hidden past."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Scaggs|first=John|title=Crime Fiction (The New Critical Idiom)|year=2005|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0415318259|pages=9–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early Arab detective fiction===
The oldest known example of a detective story was ''[[The Three Apples]]'', one of the tales narrated by [[Scheherazade]] in the ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'' (''Arabian Nights''). In this story, a fisherman discovered a heavy, locked chest along the [[Tigris]] river, which he then sold to the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid Caliph]], [[Harun al-Rashid]]. When Harun broke open the chest, he discovered the body of a young woman who had been cut into pieces. Harun then orders his [[vizier]], [[Ja'far ibn Yahya]], to solve the crime and to find the murderer within three days, or be executed if he fails in his assignment.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Story-Telling Techniques in the Arabian Nights|first=David|last=Pinault|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|year=1992|isbn=978-90-04-09530-4|pages=86–91}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Suspense]] is generated through multiple [[plot twist]]s that occur as the story progressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Story-Telling Techniques in the Arabian Nights|first=David|last=Pinault|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|year=1992|isbn=978-90-04-09530-4|pages=93, 95, 97}}&lt;/ref&gt; WIth these characteristics this may be considered an archetype for detective fiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Story-Telling Techniques in the Arabian Nights|first=David|last=Pinault|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|year=1992|isbn=978-90-04-09530-4|page=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main difference between Ja'far ("[[The Three Apples]]") and later fictional detectives, such as [[Sherlock Holmes]] and [[Hercule Poirot]], is that Ja'far has no actual desire to solve the case. The [[whodunit]] mystery is solved when the murderer himself confessed his crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Story-Telling Techniques in the Arabian Nights|first=David|last=Pinault|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|year=1992|isbn=978-90-04-09530-4|pages=91–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; This in turn lead to another assignment in which Ja'far has to find the culprit who instigated the murder within three days or else be executed. Ja'far again fails to find the culprit before the deadline, but owing to chance, he discovers a key item. In the end, he manages to solve the case through reasoning in order to prevent his own execution.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Story-Telling Techniques in the Arabian Nights|first=David|last=Pinault|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|year=1992|isbn=978-90-04-09530-4|pages=96–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early Chinese detective fiction===
[[Gong'an fiction]] ([[:zh:公案小说|公案小说]], literally："case records of a public law court") is the earliest known genre of Chinese detective fiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2018-03-22|title=Detective fiction|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Detective_fiction&amp;oldid=831738438|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some well-known stories include the [[Yuan Dynasty]] story ''[[Circle of Chalk]]'' (Chinese: [[wikt:灰|灰]][[wikt:闌|闌]][[wikt:記|記]]), the [[Ming Dynasty]] story collection ''[[Bao Gong An]]'' (Chinese: [[wikt:包|包]][[wikt:公|公]][[wikt:案|案]]) and the 18th century ''[[Di Gong An]]'' (Chinese: [[wikt:狄|狄]][[wikt:公|公]][[wikt:案|案]]) story collection. The latter was translated into English as ''[[Celebrated Cases of Judge Dee]]'' by Dutch sinologist [[Robert Van Gulik]], who then used the style and characters to write the original [[Judge Dee]] series.

The hero/detective of these novels was typically a traditional judge or similar official based on historical personages such as [[Judge Bao]] ([[Bao Zheng|Bao Qingtian]]) or Judge Dee ([[Di Renjie]]). Although the historical characters may have lived in an earlier period (such as the [[Song dynasty|Song]] or [[Tang dynasty]]) most stories are written in the later [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] or [[Qing Dynasty|Qing]] Dynasty period.

These novels differ from the Western style tradition in several points as described by Van Gulik:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Celebrated Cases of Judge Dee|last=Gulik|first=Van|publisher=Dover Publications|year=1976|isbn=978-0486233376|location=|pages=1–237}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The detective is the local magistrate who is usually involved in several unrelated cases simultaneously;
* The criminal is introduced at the very beginning of the story and his crime and reasons are carefully explained, thus constituting an [[inverted detective story]] rather than a "puzzle";
* The stories have a supernatural element with ghosts telling people about their death and even accusing the criminal;
* The stories are filled with digressions into philosophy, the complete texts of official documents, and much more, resulting in long books; and
* The novels tend to have a huge cast of characters, typically in the hundreds, all described with their relation to the various main actors in the story.

Van Gulik chose ''Di Gong An'' to translate because in his view it was closer to the Western literary style and more likely to appeal to non-Chinese readers.

One notable fact is that a number of [[Gong An story|Gong An]] works may have been [[Lost works|lost]] or destroyed during the [[Literary Inquisition]]s and the [[List of Chinese battles|wars]] in ancient China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/62103/1/MPRA_paper_62103.pdf|title=The Literary Inquisition: The Persecution of Intellectuals and Human Capital Accumulation in China|last=Koyama|first=Mark|date=February 11, 2015|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, in the traditional Chinese culture, this genre was low-prestige, and therefore was less worthy of preservation than works such as philosophy or poetry. Only little or incomplete case volumes can be found; for example, the only copy of [[Di Gong An]] was found at a [[second-hand]] book store in [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]].

===Early Western detective fiction===
[[File:Edgar Allen Poe 1898.jpg|thumb|[[Edgar Allan Poe]] (1809–1849)]]

One of the earliest examples of detective fiction in Western Literature is [[Voltaire]]'s ''[[Zadig]]'' (1748), which features a main character who performs feats of analysis.&lt;ref name=Silverman171/&gt; ''[[Things as They Are; or, The Adventures of Caleb Williams]]'' (1794) by [[William Godwin]] portrays the law as protecting the murderer and destroying the innocent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first =Gay|last = Clifford |date =1977|title = ''Caleb Williams'' and ''Frankenstein'': First-Person Narratives and "Things as They Are"|journal =Genre|number = 10  |pages = 601–617|url = http://knarf.english.upenn.edu/Articles/clifford.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas Skinner Sturr's anonymous ''Richmond, or stories in the life of a Bow Street officer'' was published in London in 1827; the [[Denmark|Danish]] crime story ''[[The Rector of Veilbye]]'' by [[Steen Steensen Blicher]] was written in 1829; and the Norwegian crime novel ''Mordet paa Maskinbygger Roolfsen'' ("The Murder of Engine Maker Roolfsen") by [[Maurits Hansen]] was published in December 1839.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2016-10-25|title=Maurits Hansen|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Maurits_Hansen&amp;oldid=746071916|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"[[Mademoiselle de Scuderi|Das Fräulein von Scuderi]]" is an 1819 short story by [[E. T. A. Hoffmann]], in which Mlle de Scudery establishes the innocence of the police's favorite suspect in the murder of a jeweller. This story is sometimes cited as the first detective story and as a direct influence on [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s "[[The Murders in the Rue Morgue]]" (1841).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Seven Basic Plots|last=Booker|first=Christopher|publisher=Bloomsbury Academic|year=2004|isbn=978-0826480378|location=|page=507}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also suggested as a possible influence on Poe is ‘The Secret Cell’, a short story published in September 1837 by [[William Evans Burton]]. It has been suggested that this story may have been known to Poe, who in 1839 worked for Burton.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Dead Witness: A Connoisseur's Collection of Victorian Detective Stories|last=Sims|first=Michael|publisher=Walker Books|year=2011|isbn=9780802779182|location=|pages=2–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story was about a London policeman who solves the mystery of a kidnapped girl. Burton’s fictional detective relied on practical methods such as dogged legwork, knowledge of the underworld and undercover surveillance, rather than brilliance of imagination or intellect.

===Establishment of the genre===
Detective fiction in the English-speaking world is considered to have begun in 1841 with the publication of Poe's "The Murders in the Rue Morgue",&lt;ref name=Silverman171&gt;{{Citation | title=Edgar A. Poe: Mournful and Never-ending Remembrance | last=Silverman | first=Kenneth | authorlink=Kenneth Silverman | publisher=Harper Perennial | location=New York | edition=Paperback | year=1991 | page=171 | isbn=978-0-06-092331-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; featuring "the first fictional detective, the eccentric and brilliant [[C. Auguste Dupin]]". When the character first appeared, the word detective did not even exist. However, the character's name, "Dupin", originated from the English word dupe or deception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.librarypoint.org/detective_fiction_origins|title=A History of Detective Fiction: Literary Origins {{!}} Librarypoint|website=www.librarypoint.org|language=en|access-date=2018-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poe devised a "plot formula that's been successful ever since, give or take a few shifting variables."&lt;ref name="NDHB"&gt;Kismaric, Carole and Heiferman, Marvin. ''The Mysterious Case of Nancy Drew &amp; The Hardy Boys''. New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1998. p. 56. {{ISBN|0-684-84689-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poe followed with further Auguste Dupin tales: "[[The Mystery of Marie Rogêt]]" in 1843 and "[[The Purloined Letter]]" in 1845.

Poe referred to his stories as "tales of [[wikt:ratiocination|ratiocination]]".&lt;ref name=Silverman171/&gt; In stories such as these, the primary concern of the plot is ascertaining truth, and the usual means of obtaining the truth is a complex and mysterious process combining intuitive logic, astute observation, and perspicacious inference. "Early detective stories tended to follow an investigating protagonist from the first scene to the last, making the unravelling a practical rather than emotional matter."&lt;ref name="NDHB" /&gt; "The Mystery of Marie Rogêt" is particularly interesting because it is a barely fictionalized account based on Poe's theory of what happened to the real-life [[Mary Rogers|Mary Cecilia Rogers]].

[[Émile Gaboriau]] was a pioneer of the detective fiction genre in France. In ''[[Monsieur Lecoq (novel)|Monsieur Lecoq]]'' (1868), the title character is adept at disguise, a key characteristic of detectives.&lt;ref&gt;Bonnoit, R: ''[[Émile Gaboriau]] ou la Naissance du Roman Policier'', Paris: Librairie Philosophique J Vrin, 1985, p. 198&lt;/ref&gt; Gaboriau's writing is also considered to contain the first example of a detective minutely examining a crime scene for clues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gunning|first=Tom|date=2005|title=Lynx-Eyed Detectives and Shadow Bandits: Visuality and Eclipse in French Detective Stories and Films before WWI|jstor=4149299|journal=Yale French Studies|issue=108|pages=74–88|doi=10.2307/4149299}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dickens by Watkins 1858.png|thumb|left|[[Charles Dickens]] (1812–1870). Photo from 1858|196x196px]]
Another early example of a whodunit is a subplot in the novel ''[[Bleak House]]'' (1853) by [[Charles Dickens]]. The conniving lawyer Tulkinghorn is killed in his office late one night, and the crime is investigated by Inspector Bucket of the Metropolitan police force. Numerous characters appeared on the staircase leading to Tulkinghorn's office that night, some of them in disguise, and Inspector Bucket must penetrate these mysteries to identify the murderer. Dickens also left a novel unfinished at his death, ''[[The Mystery of Edwin Drood]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Kate Dickens Perugini]] (1906), "''Edwin Drood'' and the Last Days of Charles Dickens", ''Pall Mall Magazine'', Vol. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Dickens, Drood and the Detectives|last=Dubberke|first=Ray|publisher=Todd &amp; Honeywell|year=1989|isbn=978-0899628264|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Wilkie-Collins.jpg|thumb|[[Wilkie Collins]] (1824–1889)]]
Dickens's protégé, [[Wilkie Collins]] (1824–1889)&amp;mdash;sometimes referred to as the "grandfather of English detective fiction"&amp;mdash;is credited with the first great mystery novel, ''[[The Woman in White (novel)|The Woman in White]]''. [[T. S. Eliot]] called Collins's novel ''[[The Moonstone]]'' (1868) "the first, the longest, and the best of modern English detective novels... in a genre invented by Collins and not by Poe",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Cambridge Companion to the Victorian Novel|last=David|first=Deirdre|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2013|isbn=978-0521182157|location=|page=179}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Dorothy L. Sayers]] called it "probably the very finest detective story ever written".&lt;ref&gt;Hall, Sharon K (1979). ''Twentieth century literary criticism''. p. 531. University of Michigan&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Moonstone'' contains a number of ideas that have established in the genre several classic features of the 20th century detective story:

* [[English country house]] robbery
* An "[[wikt:inside job|inside job]]"
* [[Red herring (plot device)|red herrings]]
* A celebrated, skilled, professional investigator
* Bungling local constabulary
* Detective inquiries
* Large number of false suspects
* The "least likely suspect"
* A rudimentary "[[Locked room mystery|locked room]]" murder
* A reconstruction of the crime
* A final twist in the plot

Although ''The Moonstone'' is usually seen as the first detective novel, there are other contenders for the honor. A number of critics suggest that the lesser known ''[[The Notting Hill Mystery|Notting Hill Mystery]]'' (1862–63), written by the pseudonymous "Charles Felix" (later identified as [[Charles Warren Adams]]&lt;ref name=collins/&gt;&lt;ref name=buckler&gt;Buckler, William. "Once a Week Under Samuel Lucas, 1859-65", ''PMLA'', 67.7(1952): 924-941. In 1952, William Buckler identified the author of the novel as [[Charles Warren Adams]] and in 2011 American investigator [[Paul Collins (American writer)|Paul Collins]] found a number of lines of evidence that confirmed Buckler's initial claim.&lt;/ref&gt;), preceded it by a number of years and first used techniques that would come to define the genre.&lt;ref name=collins&gt;[[Paul Collins (American writer)|Paul Collins]].

Literary critics Chris Willis and Kate Watson consider [[Mary Elizabeth Braddon]]'s first book, the even earlier ''The Trail of the Serpent'' (1861), the first British detective novel.&lt;ref name=Watson&gt;{{cite book |last=Watson |first=Kate |date=2012 |title=Women Writing Crime Fiction, 1860-1880: Fourteen American, British and Australian Authors |page=46 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6ZQrQAx7BvgC&amp;dq |location=Jefferson, North Carolina |publisher=McFarland &amp; Company, Inc. |isbn=978-0-7864-6782-2 |accessdate=27 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The novel "features an unusual and innovative detective figure, Mr. Peters, who is lower class and mute, and who is initially dismissed both by the text and its characters."&lt;ref name="Watson"/&gt; Braddon's later and better-remembered work, ''[[Aurora Floyd]]'' (printed in 1863 novel form, but serialized in 1862-63&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.broadviewpress.com/product.php?productid=95 |title=Broadview Press: "Aurora Floyd"|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website=www.broadviewpress.com |publisher=Broadview Press |accessdate=27 February 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;), also features a compelling detective in the person of Detective Grimstone of Scotland Yard.

[[Tom Taylor]]'s melodrama ''[[The Ticket-of-Leave Man (play)|The Ticket-of-Leave Man]]'', an adaptation of ''Léonard'' by Édouard Brisbarre and Eugène Nus,&lt;ref&gt;"The Ticket-of-Leave Man" in ''Dictionary Central'' http://www.dictionarycentral.com/definition/the-ticket-of-leave-man.html . Accessed 2013.12.10.&lt;/ref&gt; appeared in 1863, introducing [[Hawkshaw the Detective]]. In short, it is difficult to establish who was the first to write the English-language detective novel, as various authors were exploring the theme simultaneously.

In 1887, [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] created [[Sherlock Holmes]], arguably the most famous of all fictional detectives. Although Sherlock Holmes is not the original fiction detective (he was influenced by Poe's [[C. Auguste Dupin|Dupin]] and Gaboriau's [[Monsieur Lecoq|Lecoq]]), his name has become a byword for the part. Conan Doyle stated that the character of Holmes was inspired by [[Joseph Bell|Dr. Joseph Bell]], for whom Doyle had worked as a clerk at the [[Edinburgh Royal Infirmary]]. Like Holmes, Bell was noted for drawing large conclusions from the smallest observations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Lycett |first=Andrew |title=The Man Who Created Sherlock Holmes: The Life and Times of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle |publisher=Free Press |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-7432-7523-1 |pages=53–54, 190}}&lt;/ref&gt; A brilliant [[London]]-based "consulting detective" residing at [[221B Baker Street]], Holmes is famous for his [[intelligence|intellectual prowess]] and is renowned for his skillful use of astute [[observation]], [[deductive reasoning]], and [[forensic]] skills to solve difficult [[legal case|cases]]. Conan Doyle wrote four [[novels]] and fifty-six [[short stories]] featuring Holmes, and all but four stories are narrated by Holmes's friend, assistant, and biographer, [[Dr. Watson|Dr. John H. Watson]].

==Golden Age detective novels==
[[File:Agatha Christie.png|thumb| [[Agatha Christie]] (1890–1976)]]
The period between World War I and World War II (the 1920s and 1930s) is generally referred to as the Golden Age of Detective Fiction.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.spectator.co.uk/2013/12/a-nice-gentle-murder/|title=P.D. James: Who killed the golden age of crime? {{!}} The Spectator|date=2013-12-14|work=The Spectator|access-date=2018-03-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, a number of very popular writers emerged, including mostly British but also a notable subset of American and New Zealand writers. Female writers constituted a major portion of notable Golden Age writers. Agatha Christie, Dorothy L. Sayers, Josephine Tey, Margery Allingham, and Ngaio Marsh were particularly famous female writers of this time.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Apart from Ngaio Marsh (a New Zealander), they were all British.

Various conventions of the detective genre were standardized during the Golden Age, and in 1929, some of them were codified by writer Ronald Knox in his 'Decalogue' of rules for detective fiction. One of his rules was to avoid supernatural elements so that the focus remained on the mystery itself.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Knox has contended that a detective story "must have as its main interest the unravelling of a mystery; a mystery whose elements are clearly presented to the reader at an early stage in the proceedings, and whose nature is such as to arouse curiosity, a curiosity which is gratified at the end."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=gYL2DAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA4&amp;lpg=PA4&amp;dq=must+have+as+its+main+interest+the+unravelling+of+a+mystery;+a+mystery+whose+elements+are+clearly+presented+to+the+reader+at+an+early+stage+in+the+proceedings,+and+whose+nature+is+such+as+to+arouse+curiosity,+a+curiosity+which+is+gratified+at+the+end#v=onepage&amp;q=must%20have%20as%20its%20main%20interest%20the%20unravelling%20of%20a%20mystery;%20a%20mystery%20whose%20elements%20are%20clearly%20presented%20to%20the%20reader%20at%20an%20early%20stage%20in%20the%20proceedings,%20and%20whose%20nature%20is%20such%20as%20to%20arouse%20curiosity,%20a%20curiosity%20which%20is%20gratified%20at%20the%20end&amp;f=false|title=Queering Agatha Christie: Revisiting the Golden Age of Detective Fiction|last=Bernthal|first=J. C.|date=2016-09-02|publisher=Springer|isbn=9783319335339|location=|pages=1–24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another common convention in Golden Age detective stories involved an outsider — sometimes a salaried investigator or a police officer, but often a gifted amateur — investigating a murder committed in a closed environment by one of a limited number of suspects.

The most widespread subgenre of the detective novel became the whodunit (or whodunnit, short for "who done it?"). In this subgenre, great ingenuity may be exercised in narrating the crime, usually a homicide, and the subsequent investigation. This objective was to conceal the identity of the criminal from the reader until the end of the book, when the method and culprit are both revealed. According to scholars Carole Kismaric and Marvi Heiferman, "The golden age of detective fiction began with high-class amateur detectives sniffing out murderers lurking in rose gardens, down country lanes, and in picturesque villages. Many conventions of the detective-fiction genre evolved in this era, as numerous writers — from populist entertainers to respected poets — tried their hands at mystery stories."&lt;ref name="NDHB" /&gt;

John Dickson Carr — who also wrote as Carter Dickson — used the “puzzle” approach in his writing which was characterized by including a complex puzzle for the reader to try to unravel. He created ingenious and seemingly impossible plots and is regarded as the master of the "locked room mystery". Two of Carr’s most famous works are ''The Case of Constant Suicides'' (1941) and ''The Hollow Man'' (1935).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jan/29/top-10-locked-room-mysteries-adrian-mckinty|title=The top 10 locked-room mysteries|last=McKinty|first=Adrian|date=2014-01-29|newspaper=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another author, Cecil Street — who also wrote as John Rhode — wrote of a detective, Dr. Priestley, who specialised in elaborate technical devices. In the United States, the whodunit subgenre was adopted and extended by Rex Stout and Ellery Queen, along with others. The emphasis on formal rules during the Golden Age produced great works, albeit with highly standardized form. The most successful novels of this time included “an original and exciting plot; distinction in the writing, a vivid sense of place, a memorable and compelling hero and the ability to draw the reader into their comforting and highly individual world.”&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==='Whodunit'===
{{main|Whodunit|}}
A '''''whodunit''''' or '''''whodunnit''''' (a colloquial elision of "Who [has] done it?" or "Who did it?") is a complex, plot-driven variety of the detective story in which the audience is given the opportunity to engage in the same process of deduction as the protagonist throughout the investigation of a crime. The reader or viewer is provided with the clues from which the identity of the perpetrator may be deduced before the story provides the revelation itself at its [[Climax (narrative)|climax]]. The "whodunit" flourished during the so-called "[[Golden Age of Detective Fiction|Golden Age]]" of detective fiction, between 1920 and 1950, when it was the predominant mode of crime writing.

=== Agatha Christie ===
Agatha Christie is not only the most famous Golden Age writer, but also considered one of the most famous authors of all genres of all time. At the time of her death in 1976, “she was the best-selling novelist in history.”&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Many of the most popular books of the Golden Age were written by Agatha Christie. She produced long series of books featuring detective characters like Hercule Poirot and Miss Marple, amongst others. Her use of basing her stories on complex puzzles, “combined with her stereotyped characters and picturesque middle-class settings”, is credited for her success.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Christie's works include ''Murder on the Orient Express'' (1934), ''Death on the Nile'' (1937), and ''And Then There Were None'' (1939).

== Modern regional detective fiction ==

=== [[Japanese detective fiction]] ===
[[Edogawa Rampo]] is the first Japanese modern mystery writer and the founder of the [[Mystery Writers of Japan|Detective Story Club in Japan]]. Rampo was an admirer of western mystery writers. He gained his fame in early 1920s, when he began to bring to the genre many bizarre, erotic and even fantastic elements. This is partly because of the social tension before [[World War II]].&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Manji, G. (1993). Crime fiction with a social consciousness. ''Japan Quarterly, 40''(2), 157. Retrieved from https://search.proquest.com/docview/1304283380&lt;/ref&gt; In 1957, [[Seichō Matsumoto|Seicho Matsumoto]] received the [[Mystery Writers of Japan Award]] for his short story ''The Face'' (''顔'' ''kao''). ''The Face'' and Matsumoto's subsequent works began the "social school" (社会派 ''shakai ha'') within the genre, which emphasized [[social realism]], described crimes in an ordinary setting and sets motives within a wider context of social injustice and political corruption.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Since the 1980s, a "[[Golden Age of Detective Fiction#The "new traditionalist" movement in Japanese mystery writing|new orthodox school]]" (新本格派 ''shin honkaku ha'') has surfaced. It demands restoration of the classic rules of detective fiction and the use of more self-reflective elements. Famous authors of this movement include [[Soji Shimada]], [[Yukito Ayatsuji]], [[Rintaro Norizuki]], [[Alice Arisugawa]], [[Kaoru Kitamura]] and [[Taku Ashibe]].

=== [[Chinese crime fiction|Chinese detective fiction]] ===
Through China’s Golden Age of [[crime fiction]] (1900-1949), translations of Western classics, and native Chinese detective fictions&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Chinese Justice, the Fiction: Law and Literature in Modern China|last=Kinkley|first=Jeffrey C.|publisher=Stanford University Press|year=2000|isbn=978-0804734431|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; circulated within the country.

Cheng Xiaoqing had first encountered [[Arthur Conan Doyle|Conan Doyle]]’s highly popular stories as an adolescent. In the ensuing years, he played a major role in rendering them first into classical and later into [[vernacular Chinese]]. Cheng Xiaoqing’s translated works from [[Arthur Conan Doyle|Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]] introduced China to a new type of narrative style. Western detective fiction that was translated often emphasized “individuality, equality, and the importance of knowledge” , appealing to China that it was the time for opening their eyes to the rest of the world.

This style began China’s interest in popular [[crime fiction]], and is what drove Cheng Xiaoqing to write his own [[crime fiction]] novel, ''Sherlock in Shanghai''.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sherlock in Shanghai : stories of crime and detection|last1=Cheng|first1=Xiaoqing|date=2007|publisher=University of Hawai'i Press|translator-last=Wong|translator-first=Timothy C.|isbn=9780824864286|location=Honolulu|oclc=256676525}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1910s, Cheng began writing detective fiction very much in [[Arthur Conan Doyle|Conan Doyle]]’s style, with Bao as the Watson-like narrator; a rare instance of such a direct appropriation from foreign fiction.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Famed as the “Oriental [[Sherlock Holmes]]”,&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; the duo Huo Sang and Bao Lang become counterparts to [[Arthur Conan Doyle|Doyle]]’s [[Sherlock Holmes]] and [[Dr. Watson]] characters.

===Other regional and ethnic subcultures===
Especially in the United States, detective fiction emerged in the 1960s, and gained prominence in later decades, as a way for authors to bring stories about various subcultures to mainstream audiences. One scholar wrote about the detective novels of [[Tony Hillerman]], set among the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] population around [[New Mexico]], "many American readers have probably gotten more insight into traditional [[Navajo people|Navajo]] culture from his detective stories than from any other recent books."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=UIrr2lOnkp8C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA8#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "Canonization, Modern Literature, and the Detective Story], John G. Cawelti, from ''Theory and practice of classic detective fiction'', Jerome Delamater, etc., Hofstra University, 1997, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; Other notable writers who have explored regional and ethnic communities in their detective novels are [[Harry Kemelman]], whose [[Rabbi Small]] series were set in the [[Conservative Jewish]] community of [[Massachusetts]]; [[Walter Mosley]], whose [[Easy Rawlins]] books are set in the [[African American]] community of 1950s [[Los Angeles]]; and [[Sara Paretsky]], whose [[V. I. Warshawski]] books have explored the various subcultures of [[Chicago]].

== Subgenres ==

===Standard private eye, or "hardboiled"===
Martin Hewitt, created by British author [[Arthur Morrison]] in 1894, is one of the first examples of the modern style of fictional [[private detective]]. This character is described as an "'Everyman' detective meant to challenge the detective-as-superman that Holmes represented."&lt;ref name="google2005"&gt;Rzepka, Charles J. (2005-09-30). [https://books.google.ca/books?id=iYq7D2VCmc0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=zh-CN&amp;source=gbs_atb#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Detective Fiction'']. Polity. {{ISBN|9780745629421}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the late 1920s, [[Al Capone]] and the Mob were inspiring not only fear, but piquing mainstream curiosity about the American [[Organized crime|crime underworld]]. Popular [[pulp fiction magazine]]s like ''[[Black Mask (magazine)|Black Mask]]'' capitalized on this, as authors such as Carrol John Daly published violent stories that focused on the mayhem and injustice surrounding the criminals, not the circumstances behind the crime. Very often, no actual mystery even existed: the books simply revolved around justice being served to those who deserved harsh treatment, which was described in explicit detail."&lt;ref name="NDHB" /&gt; The overall theme these writers portrayed reflected "the changing face of America itself."&lt;ref name="google2005"/&gt;

In the 1930s, the private eye genre was adopted wholeheartedly by American writers. One of the primary contributors to this style was [[Dashiell Hammett]] with his famous private investigator character, Sam Spade.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2006"&gt;Messent, P. (2006). ''Introduction: From private eye to police procedural--the logic of contemporary crime fiction''&lt;/ref&gt; His style of crime fiction came to be known as "[[hardboiled]]", which is described as a genre that "usually deals with criminal activity in a modern urban environment, a world of disconnected signs and anonymous strangers."&lt;ref name="autogenerated2006"/&gt; "Told in stark and sometimes elegant language through the unemotional eyes of new hero-detectives, these stories were an American phenomenon."&lt;ref name="NDHB" /&gt;

In the late 1930s, [[Raymond Chandler]] updated the form with his private detective [[Philip Marlowe]], who brought a more intimate voice to the detective than the more distanced "operative's report" style of Hammett's Continental Op stories.&lt;ref&gt;Beal, W. (2014). Philip marlowe, family man. ''College Literature, 41''(2), 11-28. 10.1353/lit.2014.0021&lt;/ref&gt; Despite struggling through the task of plotting a story, his cadenced dialogue and cryptic narrations were musical, evoking the dark alleys and tough thugs, rich women and powerful men about whom he wrote. Several feature and television movies have been made about the Philip Marlowe character. [[James Hadley Chase]] wrote a few novels with private eyes as the main heroes, including ''Blonde's Requiem'' (1945), ''Lay Her Among the Lilies'' (1950), and ''Figure It Out for Yourself'' (1950). The heroes of these novels are typical private eyes, very similar to or plagiarizing Raymond Chandler's work.&lt;ref&gt;Pristed, B. B. (2013). Glasnost noire: The soviet and post-soviet publication and reception of James Hadley Chase. ''Book History, 16''(1), 329-363. 10.1353/bh.2013.0000&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ross Macdonald]], pseudonym of [[Kenneth Millar]], updated the form again with his detective [[Lew Archer]]. Archer, like Hammett's fictional heroes, was a camera eye, with hardly any known past. "Turn Archer sideways, and he disappears," one reviewer wrote. Two of Macdonald's strengths were his use of psychology and his beautiful prose, which was full of imagery. Like other '[[hardboiled]]' writers, Macdonald aimed to give an impression of realism in his work through violence, sex and confrontation. The 1966 movie ''[[Harper (film)|Harper]]'' starring [[Paul Newman]] was based on the first Lew Archer story ''[[The Moving Target]]'' (1949). Newman reprised the role in ''[[The Drowning Pool]]'' in 1976.

[[Michael Collins (author)|Michael Collins]], pseudonym of Dennis Lynds, is generally considered the author who led the form into the Modern Age. His PI, [[Dan Fortune]], was consistently involved in the same sort of David-and-Goliath stories that Hammett, Chandler, and Macdonald wrote, but Collins took a sociological bent, exploring the meaning of his characters' places in society and the impact society had on people. Full of commentary and clipped prose, his books were more intimate than those of his predecessors, dramatizing that crime can happen in one's own living room.

The PI novel was a male-dominated field in which female authors seldom found publication until [[Marcia Muller]], [[Sara Paretsky]], and [[Sue Grafton]] were finally published in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Each author's detective, also female, was brainy and physical and could hold her own.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite thesis|last=Nora|first=Martin,|title="In the business of believing women's stories": Feminism through detective fiction (Sara Paretsky, Sue Grafton)|date=1996|publisher=Wilfrid Laurier University|url=http://scholars.wlu.ca/etd/3/|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their acceptance, and success, caused publishers to seek out other female authors.

=== [[Inverted detective story|Inverted detective]] ===
An inverted detective story, also known as a "'''howcatchem'''", is a [[murder]] [[mystery fiction]] structure in which the commission of the crime is shown or described at the beginning,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; usually including the identity of the perpetrator.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Dictionary of literary themes and motifs|date=1988|publisher=Greenwood Press|others=Seigneuret, Jean-Charles.|isbn=9780313263965|location=New York|oclc=15696167}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story then describes the detective's attempt to solve the mystery. There may also be subsidiary puzzles, such as why the crime was committed, and they are explained or resolved during the story. This format is the opposite of the more typical "[[whodunit]]", where all of the details of the perpetrator of the crime are not revealed until the story's climax.

===[[Police procedural]]===
Many detective stories have [[police]] officers as the main characters. These stories may take a variety of forms, but many authors try to realistically depict the routine activities of a group of police officers who are frequently working on more than one case simultaneously. Some of these stories are whodunits; in others, the criminal is well known, and it is a case of getting enough evidence.

In the 1940s the police procedural evolved as a new style of detective fiction. Unlike the heroes of Christie, Chandler, and Spillane, the police detective was subject to error and was constrained by rules and regulations. As Gary Huasladen says in ''Places for Dead Bodies'', "not all the clients were insatiable bombshells, and invariably there was life outside the job." The detective in the police procedural does the things police officers do to catch a criminal. Writers include [[Ed McBain]], [[P. D. James]], and [[Bartholomew Gill]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://libguides.enc.edu/mysteryfiction/genres|title=LibGuides: Mystery Fiction and Film: Genres of Mystery and Crime Fiction|last=Hwang|first=Amy|website=libguides.enc.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== [[Historical mystery]] ===
These works are set in a time period considered historical from the author's perspective, and the central plot involves the solving of a mystery or crime (usually murder). Though works combining these genres have existed since at least the early 20th century, many credit [[Ellis Peters]]'s ''[[The Cadfael Chronicles|Cadfael Chronicles]]'' (1977–1994) for popularizing what would become known as the historical mystery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704804204575069371115999474|title=Historical Mystery Novels|last=Jr|first=David B.

=== [[Cozy mysteries]] ===
"[[Cozy mystery|Cozy mysteries]]" began in the late 20th century as a reinvention of the Golden Age whodunit; these novels generally shy away from violence and suspense and frequently feature female amateur detectives. Modern cozy mysteries are frequently, though not necessarily in either case, humorous and thematic (culinary mystery, animal mystery, quilting mystery, etc.)

This style features minimal violence, sex, and social relevance; a solution achieved by intellect or intuition rather than police procedure, with order restored in the end; honorable and well bred characters; and a setting in a closed community. Writers include [[Agatha Christie]], [[Dorothy L. Sayers]], and [[Elizabeth Daly]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Serial killer mystery ===
Another subgenre of detective fiction is the [[serial killer]] mystery, which might be thought of as an outcropping of the police procedural. There are early mystery novels in which a police force attempts to contend with the type of criminal known in the 1920s as a homicidal maniac, such as a few of the early novels of [[Philip Macdonald]] and [[Ellery Queen]]'s ''[[Cat of Many Tails]]''. However, this sort of story became much more popular after the coining of the phrase "serial killer" in the 1970s and the publication of ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (novel)|The Silence of the Lambs]]'' in 1988. These stories frequently show the activities of many members of a police force or government agency in their efforts to apprehend a killer who is selecting victims on some obscure basis. They are also often much more violent and suspenseful than other mysteries.

=== [[Legal thriller]] or courtroom ===
The [[legal thriller]] or courtroom novel is also related to detective fiction. The system of justice itself is always a major part of these works, at times almost functioning as one of the characters.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} In this way, the legal system provides the framework for the legal thriller as much as the system of modern police work does for the [[police procedural]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2017-12-14|title=Legal thriller|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Legal_thriller&amp;oldid=815435109|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The legal thriller usually starts its business with the court proceedings following the closure of an investigation, often resulting in a new angle on the investigation, so as to bring about a final outcome different from the one originally devised by the investigators. In the legal thriller, court proceedings play a very active, if not to say decisive part in a case reaching its ultimate solution. [[Erle Stanley Gardner]] popularized the courtroom novel in the 20th century with his [[Perry Mason]] series. Contemporary authors of legal thrillers include [[Michael Connelly]], [[Linda Fairstein]], [[John Grisham]], [[John Lescroat]], [[Paul Levine]], [[Lisa Scottoline]], and [[Scott Turow]].

=== [[Locked-room mystery]] ===
The '''[[locked-room mystery]]''' is a subgenre of detective fiction in which a [[crime]]—almost always [[murder]]—is committed under circumstances which it was seemingly impossible for the perpetrator to commit the crime and/or evade detection in the course of getting in and out of the crime scene. The genre was established in the 19th century. Edgar Allen Poe’s  "The Murders in the Rue Morgue" (1841) is considered the first locked-room mystery; since then, other authors have used the scheme. The crime in question typically involves a [[crime scene]] with no indication as to how the intruder could have entered or left, i.e., a locked room. Following other conventions of classic detective fiction, the reader is normally presented with the puzzle and all of the [[Evidence|clues]], and is encouraged to solve the mystery before the solution is revealed in a dramatic [[Climax (narrative)|climax]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2018-03-06|title=Locked-room mystery|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Locked-room_mystery&amp;oldid=829001010|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Amateur railway detective ===
One of the most prolific writers of the railway detective genre is [[Keith Miles]], who is also best known as [[Edward Marston]]. His "Railway Detective" series, published by [[Allison &amp; Busby]], is set in the mid-19th century, against the background of the "Railway Age". The cases, oftentimes linked with railways, unravel through the endeavors of two Scotland Yard detectives. To the end of 2017, there are sixteen titles in the series.

==Modern criticism of detective fiction==
===Preserving the story's secrets===
Even if they do not mean to, advertisers, reviewers, scholars and aficionados sometimes give away details or parts of the plot, and sometimes—for example in the case of [[Mickey Spillane]]'s novel ''[[I, the Jury]]''—even the solution. After the credits of [[Billy Wilder]]'s film ''[[Witness for the Prosecution (1957 film)|Witness for the Prosecution]]'', the cinemagoers are asked not to talk to anyone about the plot so that future viewers will also be able to fully enjoy the unravelling of the mystery.

===Plausibility and coincidence===
For series involving amateur detectives, their frequent encounters with crime often test the limits of plausibility. The character [[Miss Marple]], for instance, dealt with an estimated two murders a year{{Citation needed|reason=Her 12 novels span 40 years. Hardly 2 per year.|date=July 2018}}; De Andrea has described Marple's home town, the quiet little village of [[St. Mary Mead]], as having "put on a pageant of human depravity rivaled only by that of [[Sodom and Gomorrah]]"{{Citation needed|reason=This is a quote. Where is it from?|date=July 2018}}. Similarly, TV heroine [[Jessica Fletcher]] of ''[[Murder, She Wrote]]'' was confronted with bodies wherever she went, but most notably in her small hometown of [[Cabot Cove]], [[Maine]]; ''[[The New York Times]]'' estimated that, by the end of the series' 12-year run, nearly 2% of the town's residents had been killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/04/14/weekinreview/whodunit-that-under-40-crowd.html|title=Whodunit? That Under-40 Crowd|last=Barron|first=James|date=1996-04-14|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-03-29|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is arguably more convincing if police, [[forensics|forensic expert]]s or similar professionals are made the protagonist of a series of crime novels.

The television series ''[[Monk (TV series)|Monk]]'' has often made fun of this implausible frequency. The main character, [[Adrian Monk]], is frequently accused of being a "bad luck charm" and a "murder magnet" as the result of the frequency with which murder happens in his vicinity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mondayeveningclub.blogspot.ca/2009/02/butler-did-it-passion-for-mystery.html|title=The butler did it: A passion for mystery novels|website=mondayeveningclub.blogspot.ca|language=en|access-date=2018-03-22|date=2009-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Likewise Kogoro Mori of the manga series ''[[Detective Conan]]'' got that kind of unflattering reputation. Although Mori is actually a [[private investigator]] with his own agency, the police never intentionally consult him as he stumbles from one crime scene to another.

The role and legitimacy of coincidence has frequently been the topic of heated arguments ever since [[Ronald A. Knox]] categorically stated that "no accident must ever help the detective" (Commandment No. 6 in his "Decalogue").&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thrillingdetective.com/trivia/triv186.html|title=Father Knox's Decalogue: The Ten Rules of (Golden Age) Detective Fiction|website=www.thrillingdetective.com|access-date=2018-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effects of technology&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.deadgoodbooks.co.uk/stav-sherez-crime-fiction-and-technology/|title=Stav Sherez: crime fiction and technology – Dead Good|date=2017-01-29|work=Dead Good|access-date=2018-03-22|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;===
Technological progress has also rendered many plots implausible and antiquated. For example, the predominance of [[mobile phone]]s, [[pager]]s, and [[Personal digital assistant|PDAs]] has significantly altered the previously dangerous situations in which investigators traditionally might have found themselves.

One tactic that avoids the issue of technology altogether is the [[Historical whodunnit|historical detective genre]]. As global interconnectedness makes legitimate suspense more difficult to achieve, several writers—including [[Elizabeth Peters]], [[P. C. Doherty]], [[Steven Saylor]], and [[Lindsey Davis]]—have eschewed fabricating convoluted plots in order to manufacture tension, instead opting to set their characters in some former period. Such a strategy forces the protagonist to rely on more inventive means of investigation, lacking as they do the technological tools available to modern detectives.

As technology advances, so does the genre of crime fiction, as we now have the issue of cyber crime, or a crime that involves a computer and a network.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cyber crime: Investigating High-Technology Computer Crime|last=Moore|first=Robert|publisher=Anderson Publishing Co.|year=2005|isbn=978-1593453039|location=Mississippi|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also the new issue of cyberterrorism, which is being more frequently incorporated into modern crime fiction.

==Detective Commandments==
Several authors have attempted to set forth a sort of list of “Detective Commandments” for prospective authors of the genre.

According to "Twenty Rules for Writing Detective Stories," by [[Van Dine's Commandments|Van Dine]] in 1928: "The detective story is a kind of intellectual game. It is more—it is a sporting event. And for the writing of detective stories there are very definite laws—unwritten, perhaps, but nonetheless binding; and every respectable and self-respecting concocter of literary mysteries lives up to them. Herewith, then, is a sort of credo, based partly on the practice of all the great writers of detective stories, and partly on the promptings of the honest author's inner conscience."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gaslight.mtroyal.ca/vandine.htm |title=Twenty rules for writing detective stories (1928) by S. S. Van Dine |publisher=Gaslight.mtroyal.ca |date= |accessdate=2013-02-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130113070900/http://gaslight.mtroyal.ca/vandine.htm |archivedate=2013-01-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ronald Knox]] wrote a set of ''Ten Commandments'' or ''Decalogue'' in 1929,&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; see article on the [[Golden Age of Detective Fiction]].

A general consensus among crime fiction authors is there is a specific set of rules that must be applied for a novel to truly be considered part of the detective fiction genre. As noted in "Introduction to the Analysis of Crime Fiction",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Milda|first=Danytė|date=2011|title=Introduction to the analysis of crime fiction : a user-friendly guide|url=https://eltalpykla.vdu.lt/handle/1/225;jsessionid=0031AA6D5371C55A12C9211F3AD3D94E|language=en|isbn=9789955126980|publisher=Vytauto Didžiojo universitetas}}&lt;/ref&gt; crime fiction from the past 100 years has generally contained 8 key rules to be a detective novel:
* A crime, most often murder, is committed early in the narrative
* There are a variety of suspects with different motives
* A central character formally or informally acts as a detective
* The detective collects evidence about the crimes and its victim
* Usually the detective interviews the suspects,  as well as the witnesses
* The detective solves the mystery and indicates the real criminal
* Usually this criminal is now arrested or otherwise punished

=== [[C. Auguste Dupin]] ===
''Le [[Knight|Chevalier]]'' '''C. Auguste Dupin''' is a fictional character created by [[Edgar Allan Poe]]. Dupin made his first appearance in Poe's "[[The Murders in the Rue Morgue]]" (1841), widely considered the first detective fiction story.&lt;ref name="C. Auguste Dupin"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2018-01-13|title=C. Auguste Dupin|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=C._Auguste_Dupin&amp;oldid=820120170|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; He reappears in "[[The Mystery of Marie Rogêt]]" (1842) and "[[The Purloined Letter]]" (1844).

C. Auguste Dupin is generally acknowledged as the first detective in [[fiction]]. The character served as the prototype for many that were created later, including [[Sherlock Holmes]] by [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] and [[Hercule Poirot]] by [[Agatha Christie]].&lt;ref name="C. Auguste Dupin"/&gt; Conan Doyle once wrote, "Each [of Poe's detective stories] is a root from which a whole literature has developed... Where was the detective story until Poe breathed the breath of life into it?"&lt;ref name="C. Auguste Dupin"/&gt;

=== [[Ellery Queen]] ===
[[Ellery Queen]] is a fictional detective-hero, created by [[Manfred Bennington Lee]] (1905-1971), and [[Frederic Dannay]] (1905～1982), as well as a joint [[pseudonym]] for the cousins Dannay and Lee.

The '''''Dialogus de oratoribus''''' is a short work attributed to [[Tacitus]], in [[dialogue]] form, on the art of [[rhetoric]]. Its date of composition is unknown, though its dedication to [[Lucius Fabius Justus]] places its publication around 102 AD.

The dialogue itself, set in the 70s AD, follows the tradition of [[Cicero]]'s speeches on philosophical and rhetorical arguments.&lt;ref name=Tarrant1987&gt;{{citation | last=Tarrant | first=R. J. | year=1987 | title=Harvard Studies in Classical Philology, Volume 90 | publisher=Harvard University Press | isbn=978-0-674-37937-4 | page=235}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is set in the home of [[Curiatius Maternus]], one of the speakers, to whom two leading lawyers of the day, [[Marcus Aper]] and [[Julius Secundus]], have come to discuss a recent event; the fourth speaker, [[Gaius Vipstanus Messalla Gallus]], arrives later. All four men are attested historical personages. The beginning of the work is a speech in defence of eloquence and poetry. It then deals with the decadence of oratory, for which the cause is said to be the decline of the education, both in the family and in the school, of the future orator. The education is not as accurate as it once was; the teachers are not prepared and a useless rhetoric often takes the place of the general culture.

After a [[lacuna (manuscripts)|lacuna]], the ''Dialogus'' ends with a speech delivered by Maternus reporting what some believe is Tacitus's opinion. Maternus thinks that great oratory was possible with the freedom from any power, more precisely in the [[anarchy (word)|anarchy]], that characterized the [[Roman Republic]] during the civil wars. It became anachronistic and impracticable in the quiet and ordered society that resulted from the institution of the [[Roman Empire]]. The peace, warranted by the Empire, should be accepted without regret for a previous age that was more favorable to the wide spread of literacy and the growth of great personality.

Some believe that at the base of all of Tacitus's work is the acceptance of the Empire as the only power able to save the state from the chaos of the civil wars. The Empire reduced the space of the orators and of the political men, but there is no viable alternative to it. Nevertheless, Tacitus does not accept the imperial government apathetically, and he shows, as in the ''[[Agricola (book)|Agricola]]'' the remaining possibility of making choices that are dignified and useful to the state.

The date of publication of the ''Dialogus'' is uncertain, but it was probably written after the ''Agricola'' and the ''Germania''. Many characteristics set it apart from the other works of Tacitus, so much so that the its authenticity may be questioned, even if it is always grouped with the ''Agricola'' and the ''[[Germania (book)|Germania]]'' in the manuscript tradition. The way of speaking in the ''Dialogus'' seems closer to the model of Cicero, refined but not prolix, which inspired the teaching of [[Quintilian]]; it lacks the incongruities that are typical of Tacitus's major historical works. It may have been written when Tacitus was young; its dedication to Fabius Iustus would thus give the date of publication, but not the date of writing. More probably, the unusually classical style may be explained by the fact that the ''Dialogus'' is a work of rhetoric. For this genre the structure, the language, and the style of Cicero were the usual models.

The '''Doctor of Musical Arts''' ('''D.M.A.''') is a [[doctorates|doctoral]] [[academic degree]] in music. The D.M.A. combines advanced studies in an applied area of specialization (usually [[Performance|music performance]], [[music composition]], or [[conducting]]) with graduate-level academic study in subjects such as [[music history]], [[music theory]], or [[Music education|music pedagogy]]. The D.M.A. degree usually takes about three to four years of full-time study to complete (in addition to the master's and bachelor's degrees), preparing students to be professional [[performance|performers]], [[conducting|conductors]], and [[musical composition|composers]]. As a [[terminal degree]], the D.M.A. qualifies its recipient to work in university, college, and conservatory teaching/research positions. Students seeking doctoral training in [[musicology]] or [[music theory]] typically enter a [[Ph.D.]] program, rather than a D.M.A. program.

==Terminology==
The degree is also abbreviated as '''DMA''' (without periods), '''D.Mus.A.''' or '''A.Mus.D.'''. For the related degree [[Doctor of Music]], the abbreviation is '''D.M.''' or '''D.Mus.''' For the related degree [[Doctor of Arts]], the abbreviation '''D.A.''' is used.

==Types==
===Concentrations===
The D.M.A. is widely available in the concentrations of performance (sometimes with a specialization in instrumental or voice pedagogy and/or music literature), composition, conducting, and music education. Some universities awarding doctoral degrees in these areas use the title [[Doctor of Music]] (D.M. or D.Mus.) or [[Doctor of Arts]] (D.A.)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.olemiss.edu/depts/music/degree_programs/grad_degrees.html The University of Mississippi – Department of Music]&lt;/ref&gt; or Doctor in Musical Studies (Ph.D.) instead of D.M.A. The D.M.A. degree was pioneered by Howard Hanson and the [[National Association of Schools of Music]], who approved the first D.M.A. programs in 1952. Northwestern University, the University of Michigan, and the Eastman School of Music became the first to offer the D.M.A.&lt;ref&gt;Marvin Latimer, "The Nation's First D.M.A. in Choral Music," ''Journal of Historical Research in Music Education'', 32.1 (October 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Boston University]] offered its first D.M.A. program in 1955. In 2005, Boston University also expanded into [[online music education]] by launching the first online doctoral degree in music, a D.M.A. program (along with a [[Master of Music]] program) in [[music education]].&lt;ref&gt;As of November 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

A large number of U.S. institutions offer the D.M.A. degree in the 2010s. The Ph.D. is generally considered to be more research oriented, while other doctorates may  place more emphasis on practical applications and/or include a performance component. Such distinctions among degree types are not always so clear-cut, however. For instance, most programs include traditional research training and culminate in a written [[dissertation]], regardless of degree designation. The music education degree can be a D.M.A. or Ph.D.  Also, music education Ph.D. programs may include performance-oriented tracks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Florida State University – Conducting Degrees|url=http://www.music.fsu.edu/Areas-of-Study/Conducting/Degree-Programs|accessdate=31 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In composition, one may study for either the D.M.A. or the Ph.D., depending on the institution. The Ph.D. is the standard doctorate in [[music theory]], [[musicology]], [[music therapy]], and [[ethnomusicology]].
===Sacred music===
A related program is the Doctor of Sacred Music (D.S.M.), also ''Sacrae Musica Doctor'' (S.M.D.), which tends to be awarded by seminaries or university music schools that focus on church music, choral conducting and organ performance.  In the past, some seminaries titled the degree Doctor of Church Music (D.C.M.).  Only one U.S. institution, [[Claremont Graduate University]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Claremont Graduate University – Doctor of Church Music|url=http://www.cgu.edu/pages/8740.asp|accessdate=30 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; still offers the D.C.M. degree, in addition to the more typical D.M.A.  The vast majority of U.S. seminaries have closed their music doctorate programs, but some still offer a Master of Arts or Master of Sacred Music degree. A new program offered at [[Perkins School of Theology]] is the Doctor of Pastoral Music (D.P.M.).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.smu.edu/Perkins/FacultyAcademics/degrees/dpm/Apply Perkins School of Theology – Doctor of Ministry Program]&lt;/ref&gt;  While more theology-based and housed within the [[Doctor of Ministry]] (D.Min.) program, admission to the degree requires applicants to hold a Master of Music (M.Mus.), Master of Sacred Music (M.S.M.), Master of Church Music (M.C.M.), M.A. in Church Music or equivalent 48 semester hour degree recognized by the National Association of Schools of Music.

D.M.A. students typically complete applied studies, such as lessons or mentoring with a professor or instructor, and take courses within their area of specialization. In many D.M.A. programs, all of the different D.M.A. streams (e.g., performance, composition, conducting) take a common core of music theory and music history courses. Many D.M.A. programs require students to pass a [[comprehensive exam]] on their area of specialization and on subjects such as music history and music theory. The last stage of the D.M.A. degree is usually the completion of a [[thesis]], [[dissertation]], or research project and the performance of [[recital]]s, usually including at least one lecture-recital.

Some programs additionally require a sub-specialization in a cognate area within music, such as music history or performance practice, which contributes to their area of specialization. For example, a student doing a D.M.A. in Baroque violin might do a sub-specialization in Baroque music history or Baroque-era dance.

Some institutions permit D.M.A. students to do a sub-specialization in a field ''outside'' music that contributes to their professional and academic goals. For example, a student completing a D.M.A. in [[piano pedagogy]] may be able to do a sub-specialization in the university's department of psychology (e.g., on the psychology of learning and memory); a student completing a D.M.A. in electronic composition may be permitted to do a sub-specialization in the department of [[computer engineering]] (e.g., in computer programming).

While teaching experience is not an official part of most D.M.A. programs, most D.M.A. candidates will have the opportunity to work as a [[teaching assistant]] or lecturer for undergraduate students during their degree, either as a requirement of their scholarship/assistantship package or as a part-time employee of the university. D.M.A. students can teach in an area related to their D.M.A. program, or, if they have multiple skill areas (e.g., a person with an M.Mus. in piano performance who is doing a D.M.A. in composition), they may teach in another area.

==Admission requirements==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2017}}
To be admitted to a D.M.A. degree program, most institutions require a master's degree, such as a M.Mus. degree or an M.A. degree in music or an equivalent course of study, usually with a grade average of "B+" or higher. D.M.A. programs in performance usually require applicants to prepare solo literature that is the equivalent of a graduate recital—i.e. several advanced pieces from a wide range of styles—in addition to orchestral excerpts. Admission to doctoral programs in conducting often require a video recording of live rehearsals and performances as a pre-screening element. Composition programs usually require the submission of a portfolio of compositions, including scores and recordings of live performances. Programs in music education generally require two or more years of public school (or similar) teaching experience, and may further require an example of scholarly writing.

Newly admitted D.M.A. students are usually required to pass a series of diagnostic tests in music history, theory, and sometimes ear-training to confirm thorough command of essential musical principles gained in prior study. Advanced courses in these areas are not permitted until the tests are passed and/or remedial coursework in deficient area(s) is completed. Often, the knowledge of a second language – one of languages of major influence in music history (such as German, French, Italian, Spanish, or Russian) – is required to complete the degree. The graduate admissions branch of many US universities require applicants to complete the [[Graduate Record Examination]] (GRE), a standardized test of abstract thinking skills in the areas of math, vocabulary, and analytical writing. While the outcome of the GRE test may affect an applicant's eligibility for some university-wide scholarships, it does not always affect admission to the music program of the university.

== Brief history ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2017}}
After World War II, there had been a sharp rise in music education at the university level. As was the case with many occupations, the music world was experiencing an unprecedented number of discharged musicians from the U.S. Armed Forces. The G.I. Bill was an impetus for many opting for college, causing a spike in demand for college professors, across all disciplines, and a spike in enrollment. In music education, universities had an opportunity to employ formidable musicians, but many, including those of international rank, lacked a terminal academic degree that would put them on equal footing with professors. Post World War II also a period of rise the quality of comprehensive music education at universities. The Nation's renowned conservatories, such as [[Juilliard School|Juilliard]] and [[Curtis Institute of Music|Curtis]], at the time, saw no need for the degree – yet many [[alumni]] of those institutions, and many top musicians with no degree were the very people being sought by universities offering degrees in music and music education.

In 1952, after six years of deliberation, the [[National Association of Schools of Music]] (NASM) approved thirty-two schools for graduate degrees for graduate work "in one or more of the fields into which graduate music study has been divided." The NASM was, and still is, the only accrediting agency for music schools recognized by the [[American Council on Education]]. In 1952, 143 music schools had already established standards for undergraduate degrees.&lt;ref&gt;"NTSTC One of 32 Colleges for Graduate Study in Music", ''[[The Dallas Morning News]]'', December 31, 1942, Sec I, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; The national launch of DMA by institutions meeting criteria was 1953.

* [[Eastman School of Music]] (the DMA degree was approved by the State of New York Board of Regents in 1953)
* [[Boston University]]
* [[University of Southern California]]

The Dean of the [[University of Rochester]] [[Eastman School of Music]], Howard Harold Hanson (1896–1981), who had been awarded an honorary doctorate in 1925, was one of several high-profile advocates of creating a performance oriented doctors degree.

In 1953, he published a proposal for a Doctor of Musical Arts degree, which was roundly criticized by Paul Henry Lang, PhD, professor of musicology at [[Columbia University]].&lt;ref&gt;"New Degrees to Musicians – Dissenters Claim Title Not Necessary", ''[[Omaha World-Herald]]'', November 15, 1953, p. 9F&lt;/ref&gt;

* 1954: Mathias "Matt" Higgins Doran, DMA (born 1921), [[University of Southern California]]
* 1955: [[Will Gay Bottje]], DMA (born 1925), [[Eastman School of Music]] – some sources attribute Bottje as having been the first in the nation to earn the degree&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=6AAKBSlQAxMC&amp;pg ''Howard Hanson: In Theory and Practice''], by Allen Laurence Cohen, p. 14, [[Praeger Publishers|Praeger]] (2004) {{OCLC|52559264}} {{ISBN|9780313321351}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* August 1955: Edward F. Gilday, Jr., DMA, [[Boston University]]

'''Non-NASM institutions'''

The alumni of Music conservatories in the United States also seek positions at universities.  The conservatories that are not affiliated with the [[National Association of Schools of Music]] began offering DMAs in the late 1960s.

* 1971: Margaret Hee-Leng Tan, [[Juilliard School|Juilliard]] – she is the first woman to earn a DMA from Juilliard; Juilliard added the degree in 1969, the year it moved to [[Lincoln Center]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3863">'''Esther Bigeou''' (1895 – 1935 or 1936) was an [[United States|American]] [[vaudeville]] and [[blues]] singer. Billed as "The Girl with the Million Dollar Smile", she was one of  the [[classic female blues]] singers popular in the 1920s.

==Biography==
She was born in [[New Orleans, Louisiana]] in 1895. Several members of her extended family were musicians; the drummer [[Paul Barbarin]] was her cousin.&lt;ref name="Harris"&gt;[[Sheldon Harris (music historian)|Harris, Sheldon]] (1994). ''Blues Who's Who''. (Rev. ed.). New York: Da Capo Press. p. 48. {{ISBN|0-306-80155-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1913 she began touring in [[vaudeville]] with the performer and playwright [[Irvin C. Miller]]; they later married.&lt;ref name=harlem&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=NgIYlUbaoAoC&amp;pg=PA794&amp;dq=%22Brown+Skin+Models%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=41PAU_yCHsOsPNK7gNgI&amp;ved=0CB8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Brown%20Skin%20Models%22&amp;f=false Wintz, Cary D.; Paul Finkelman, Paul, eds. 2004. ''Encyclopedia of the Harlem Renaissance: K–Y''. Taylor &amp; Francis. p. 793.]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1917 Bigeou appeared as a singer, dancer, and recitalist in the revue ''Broadway Rastus'', written by Miller, at the Standard Theater in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], the Lafayette Theater in [[New York City]], and the Orpheum Theater in [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]].&lt;ref name="Harris" /&gt; She recorded for [[OKeh Records]] in 1921 and 1923 and toured the [[Theater Owners Booking Association]] vaudeville circuit with the Billy King Company in 1923.&lt;ref name="Harris" /&gt; From 1923 to 1925 and 1927 to 1930, she toured as a single act in the American South, Midwest, and Northeast.&lt;ref name="Harris" /&gt;

She died in 1935 or 1936.

==Legacy==
The blues writer Chris Smith said that Bigeou was "a singer at the pop end of African-American entertainment" and that she "seems to have retired, aged only 35, to settle in New Orleans, where reports indicate that she died circa 1936".&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;''Esther Bigeou: Complete Recorded Works in Chronological Order (1921–1923).''

'''Four Card Poker''' is a [[casino]] [[card game]] similar to [[Three Card Poker]], invented by Roger Snow and owned by [[Shuffle Master]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shufflemaster.com/02_eu_products/entertainment_products/table_games/four_card_poker.asp ShuffleMaster: Four Card Poker]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description of play==
The player can place an [[Betting (poker)#Ante|ante]] bet or an "Aces Up" bet or both. Five playing cards are dealt to the player, while the [[Poker dealer|dealer]] is dealt five cards face down and a sixth card face up. Both the player and the dealer make their best four-card hands. The dealer's advantages are in having an extra card and the fact that if the player folds, he will lose his ante, even if his hand turns out to be better than the dealer's.

After seeing their cards and the dealer's face up card, the player can opt to [[Betting (poker)#Fold|fold]] the ante bet, in which case the player loses it, or play by betting 1-3 times their ante. Unlike Three Card Poker and some other games, the dealer always qualifies (plays). If the player ties or beats the dealer, the player is paid the amount bet. A bonus is paid if the player has a three of a kind (2-1 for the original ante bet only), straight flush (20-1), or four of a kind (25-1). This bonus is paid out even if the dealer's hand is better than the player's; however, in this situation, the player would still lose their ante and play bets. 

The Aces Up bet depends solely on the player's hand. If the player has a pair of aces or better, they win, otherwise they lose. The dealer's hand is immaterial. The payout for a win can range from 1-1 for a pair of aces to 50-1 for four of a kind, the best possible hand. Various payout variations are possible, depending on the casino, resulting in a house edge ranging from 1.98% to 6.15%.&lt;ref name=wiz&gt;[http://wizardofodds.com/fourcardpoker Wizard of Odds: Four Card Poker]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rank of hands==
The possible four-card hands are (from best to worst): 
*[[Rank of hands (poker)#Four of a kind|Four of a kind]]

The '''gallery''' of a theatre is a form of [[balcony]], an elevated platform generally supported by columns or brackets, which projects from the interior wall of a theatre, in order to accommodate additional audience.

It may specifically refer to the highest such platform, and carries the cheapest seats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Oxford English Dictionary|edition=second|publisher=Oxford University Press|ISBN= 0 19 861218 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gendai-geki''' ([[wiktionary:現|現]][[wiktionary:代|代]][[wiktionary:劇|劇]]) is a [[genre]] of [[film]] and [[television]] or [[theater]] play in [[Japan]]. Unlike the ''[[jidai-geki]]'' genre of period dramas, whose stories are set in the [[Edo period]], ''gendaigeki'' stories are contemporary dramas set in the modern world.

These toys, collectively known as "[[Glo Friends]]", were so successful that American fast food chain [[Wendy's]] in 1989 also released a series of 12 soft vinyl toys to advertise their chain. Their names were:
Glo Snugbug,

Glo Bug,
Glo Grannybug,

====Patria====
'''Patria''' is another Khabouth-Harji King West restaurant collaboration, this one serving Spanish food. It opened in October 2012. Originally, only Harji was behind Patria, but soon after meeting Khabouth who was getting ready to open Weslodge next door, the two decided to join forces and run both venues in partnership with one another.&lt;ref name="natpost-mar-2015"/&gt; Reportedly, they invested C$2.5 million into getting Patria off the ground,&lt;ref name="torstar-jan-2013"&gt;{{cite news|last=Pataki|first=Amy|url=https://www.thestar.com/life/food_wine/restaurants/2013/01/04/patria_review.html|title=Patria: Review|agency=''[[Toronto Star]]''|date=4 January 2013|accessdate=8 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; enlisting the Toronto-based Commute Home design company to do the restaurant's interior&lt;ref name="torstar-jan-2013"/&gt; and getting chefs Stuart Cameron and Claudia Gibson to run the kitchen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lau|first=Gizelle|url=http://torontolife.com/food/restaurants/introducing-patria/|title=Introducing: Patria, the new King West spot for traditional Spanish food from Charles Khabouth and Hanif Harji|agency=''[[Toronto Life]]''|date=29 October 2012|accessdate=9 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Toronto location of the popular Montreal restaurant '''Buonanotte''' opened in January 2013&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Chong|first=Barry|url=http://toromagazine.com/daily-toro/20130114/buonanotte-toronto-opens-january-22|title=BUONANOTTE TORONTO OPENS JANUARY 22|publisher=''[[Toro (magazine)|Toro]]''|date=14 January 2013|accessdate=1 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; courtesy of Khabouth's INK Entertainment that licensed the name and recipes from the original restaurant's owner Massimo "Max" Lecas who remains in charge of the new venue's management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ellacott|first=Karolyne|url=http://torontolife.com/food/restaurants/buonanotte/|title=Introducing: Buonanotte, Charles Khabouth’s Toronto version of the Montreal night-life fixture|agency=''[[Toronto Life]]''|date=9 September 2012|accessdate=14 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It opened at 19 Mercer Street, the same location where Khabouth previously ran a Japanese cuisine restaurant named Ame in partnership with Michael and Guy Rubino. The original Buonanotte restaurant in Montreal has been in continual operation since 1991.

====Byblos====
'''Byblos''' is a restaurant serving Eastern [[Mediterranean cuisine|Mediterranean]] and [[Moroccan cuisine|Moroccan]] food, located on Duncan Street near King Street West inside the Storys building in Toronto's [[Toronto Entertainment District|Entertainment District]]. Opened in March 2014, it is the third restaurant that Khabouth established in Toronto in partnership with Hanif Harji.

Originally envisioned as a fish and seafood eatery,&lt;ref name="torlife-aug-2014"&gt;{{cite news|last=Pupo|first=Mark|url=http://torontolife.com/food/restaurants/rise-in-the-east-byblos-fat-pasha-toronto-restaurants/|title=Rise in the East: Byblos, Fat Pasha and the Middleterranean craze|publisher=''[[Toronto Life]]''|date=14 August 2014|accessdate=12 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; its opening took place during a time when Toronto experienced a bit of a spike in restaurants serving Mediterranean and Middle Eastern (Middleterranean) fare,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bain|first=Jennifer|url=https://www.thestar.com/life/food_wine/2014/03/24/toronto_falls_for_middleterranean_cuisine.html|title=Toronto falls for ‘Middle’terranean’ cuisine|publisher=''[[Toronto Star]]''|date=24 March 2014|accessdate=13 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; a trend that Khabouth and Harji took note of and decided to join.&lt;ref name="torlife-aug-2014"/&gt; Most upscale among the string of such spots in Toronto that opened or expanded during the 2013-2014 period (Anthony Rose's Fat Pasha, Dr. Laffa, Me Va Me, District Oven, S.

Byblos received near universal critical acclaim, getting enthusiastic reviews&lt;ref name="nuttall-smith-byblos-mar-2014"/&gt; and accolades&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Pupo|first=Mark|url=http://torontolife.com/food/restaurants/best-new-restaurants-2015-byblos/|title=Best New Restaurants 2015: #6, Byblos|publisher=''[[Toronto Life]]''|date=18 March 2015|accessdate=13 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; for its food blend and becoming perhaps the best-reviewed Khabouth restaurant ever.&lt;ref name="hello-jul-2015"&gt;{{cite news|last=Govani|first=Shinan|url=http://ca.hellomagazine.com/celebrities/02015071717521/on-the-town-with-shinan-charles-khabouth-takes-toronto-s-byblos-to-sunny-miami/|title=On the Town with Shinan: Charles Khabouth takes Toronto's Byblos to sunny Miami|publisher=''[[Hello (magazine)|Hello]]''|date=17 July 2015|accessdate=13 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Byblos got established on Toronto's restaurant scene and following the successful launch of its second location in [[Miami Beach]], it was announced in September 2015 that the Byblos brand would be expanding to the [[Gulf countries]] in early 2016 as part of a deal between Daman Investments PSC, a [[Dubai]]-based financial services company, and a consortium of partners including Harji's ICON Legacy Hospitality.&lt;ref name="Daman-ICON-sep-2015"/&gt;

After their limited collaboration on snacks at the Cabana Pool Bar, America Restaurant thus marked a closer partnership between INK and O&amp;B that began in December 2013 with an announcement of the two companies taking over all food operations at Trump International Hotel &amp; Tower&lt;ref name="torlife-dec-2013"/&gt; from [[Alex Shnaider]]'s Talon International that developed the tower and then later also managed its two dining and drinking venues — Stock restaurant and Suits Lobby Lounge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Pupo|first=Mark|url=http://torontolife.com/food/restaurants/critic-america-trump-hotel-party-in-the-usa/|title=Party in the U.S.A.: the Trump Hotel’s America serves excellent food—with a side of "What the hell?"|agency=''[[Toronto Life]]''|date=21 January 2015|accessdate=9 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After getting announced in January 2015, '''Byblos Miami''', an offshoot of Toronto's Byblos, opened in [[Miami Beach]] during late summer 2015. Another partnership between Khabouth and Harji, the Miami restaurant reportedly came on the heels of extensive research as the duo of Toronto restaurateurs aimed at minimizing surprises and risks of launching in the Miami market that they don't know very well.&lt;ref name="natpost-mar-2015"/&gt;

====Figo====
Opened in November 2015, '''Figo''' is the seventh Khabouth-Harji restaurant collaboration, their sixth in Toronto. Located on the south-west corner of Adelaide West &amp; John in the recently built Pinnacle on Adelaide condo building that's owned by Pinnacle International, the eatery serves Italian cuisine.

After his 2012 takeover of the [[Sound Academy]], Khabouth opened '''Cabana Pool Bar''' on 15 June 2013 on its patio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Star staff|url=https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/2013/05/14/cabana_pool_bar_to_open_at_sound_academy_site_june_15.html|title=Cabana Pool Bar to open at Sound Academy site June 15|agency=''[[The Toronto Star]]''|date=14 May 2013|accessdate=31 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spending C$5 million, he hired Ink's go-to interior designers Munge Leung to remake the outdoor space by installing 12 poolside white-tent [[cabana (structure)|cabanas]] and several dozen tables and couches all in an effort of appealing to the "25-plus crowd that has traveled to the south of France, been to Miami, been to Vegas".&lt;ref name="globe-oct-2015"&gt;{{cite news|last=Daly|first=John|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/rob-magazine/can-aging-club-king-charles-khabouth-conquer-the-hotel-business/article27006544/|title=Can club king Charles Khabouth conquer the hotel business?|agency=''[[The Globe and Mail]]''|date=29 October 2015|accessdate=31 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With a daytime concept that's an extension of the bottle-service booths in Khabouth's nightclubs — the cost of renting a table, a couch, or a cabana for an entire day is from C$1,000 to C$2,500, an amount for which the patrons also get three bottles of liquor to start, a platter of snacks, and wristbands affording access to 10-20 people — Cabana Pool Bar became a big success right away, attracting more than 4,000 people a day on summer weekends if the weather is nice.&lt;ref name="globe-oct-2015"/&gt; Open during summer only from early to mid June until late September, Cabana shuts down by 11pm on weekends due to the residents of the neighbouring [[Toronto Island]] complaining about the noise from the patio.&lt;ref name="globe-oct-2015"/&gt; The venue is closed to the general public during summer weekdays though it is available for corporate bookings and functions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oliverbonacinievents.com/Venues/Alternate-Venues.aspx Cabana - Oliver &amp; Bonacini Restaurants]&lt;/ref&gt; Light food offerings and snacks at the venue are handled by Oliver &amp; Bonacini Restaurants, a Toronto-based hospitality company.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cabanapoolbar.com/food/ Cabana Pool Bar Food]&lt;/ref&gt;

Celebrity presence, a staple of Khabouth's nightclubs and restaurants, played a large part in Cabana Pool Bar's initial promotion as well — [[Justin Bieber]], [[Drake (rapper)|Drake]], [[Milos Raonic]], [[deadmau5]], [[P. K. Subban]], [[Phil Kessel]], and [[Nazem Kadri]] were all on hand during its first summer in operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.etcanada.com/blogs/etc_24207/justin-bieber-and-deadmau5-spotted-poolside-in-toronto/|title=Justin Bieber And Deadmau5 Spotted Poolside in Toronto|agency=''[[Entertainment Tonight Canada]]''|date=22 July 2013|accessdate=31 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Flower|first=Jessica|url=http://torontolife.com/city/jersey-shore-meets-lake-shore/|title=Jersey Shore Meets the Lake Shore|agency=''[[Toronto Life]]''|date=31 July 2014|accessdate=31 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the coming summers, [[Will Smith]], in town filming ''[[Suicide Squad (film)|Suicide Squad]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.yaaaeh.net/news-rumours/will-smith-was-spotted-at-cabana-in-toronto/|title=Will Smith was spotted at Cabana In Toronto|agency=Yaaaeh.net|date=5 July 2015|accessdate=31 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theupperech.com/2015/07/05/will-smith-at-cabana-pool-bar/|title=Will Smith at Cabana Pool Bar|agency=TheUpperech.com|date=5 July 2015|accessdate=31 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dan Bilzerian]], [[LeBron James]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://cabanapoolbar.com/event/daylight-lebron/|title=LeBRon at Cabana|agency=CabanaPoolBar.com|date=31 July 2015|accessdate=31 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; etc. made highly publicized appearances.

===Bisha Hotel &amp; Residences===
'''Bisha Hotel &amp; Residences''' at 80 Blue Jays Way in Toronto's Entertainment District is a hotel and condominium project, currently under construction, executed as a joint venture between INK Entertainment hospitality company and Lifetime Developments real estate development company.&lt;ref name="nationalpost"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nationalpost.com/Bisha/3855833/story.html |title=Two men and a Bisha |publisher=Nationalpost.com |date=2010-11-19 |accessdate=2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a new private label hotel and residence brand named after INK founder, Charles Khabouth’s childhood nickname, Bisha.&lt;ref name="nationalpost" /&gt; It was designed by award-winning ''Wallman Architects'' and ''Munge Leung Design Associates'' and will stand 41 stories tall when complete.&lt;ref name="nationalpost" /&gt; The Bisha Presentation Centre has hosted many events including features by [[Sir Richard Branson]] and [[John Legend]].

'''Veld Music Festival''' takes place over a two-day weekend at [[Downsview Park]] in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]]. Organized annually by INK Entertainment.&lt;ref name="newswire" /&gt;

The inaugural event took place on 4 and 5 August 2012, featuring some of the best stars and labels in [[electronic dance music]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bliss|first=Karen|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/deadmau5-plays-to-enraptured-crowd-at-inaugural-veld-music-festival-20120805|title=Deadmau5 Plays to Enraptured Crowd at Inaugural Veld Music Festival|publisher=''[[Rolling Stone]]''|date=5 August 2012|accessdate=1 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inaugural headliners included [[deadmau5]] and [[Avicii]]; the 2013 festival was headlined by [[deadmau5]] and [[Above &amp; Beyond (band)|Above &amp; Beyond]].

====Controversy====
The 2014 festival had two drug-related deaths — 20-year-old Annie Le of Toronto and 22-year-old Willard Amurao from the [[Greater Toronto Area]], both of whom died after ingesting recreational drugs they had bought at the two-day event — as well as additional thirteen drug-related illnesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/veld-music-festival-deaths-toronto-police-focus-on-party-drugs-1.2727870|title=Veld Music Festival deaths: Toronto police focus on 'party drugs'|agency=[[CBC News]]|publisher=[[CBC.ca]]|date=5 August 2014|accessdate=1 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fox|first=Chris|url=http://www.cp24.com/news/police-release-description-of-pills-possibly-linked-to-music-festival-deaths-1.1946533|title=Police release description of pills possibly linked to music festival deaths|agency=''[[CP24]]''|date=5 August 2014|accessdate=27 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Questions were raised about the circumstances of Amurao's death, prompting a [[Special Investigations Unit]] (Ontario's police watchdog) investigation due to him apparently being handcuffed by a Toronto police officer before receiving medical help.&lt;ref name="SIU-to-probe"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/siu-to-probe-veld-festival-death-1.2727011|title=SIU to probe VELD festival death|agency=[[CBC News]]|publisher=[[CBC.ca]]|date=4 August 2014|accessdate=1 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The police officer reportedly approached him after seeing him being carried by two men at which point the 22-year-old reportedly became violent and needed to be handcuffed.&lt;ref name="SIU-to-probe"/&gt; A month later, the Special Investigations Unit closed its investigation, concluding that Toronto police had "nothing to do" with Amurao's death, further stating the man was helped to an emergency medical area where he began to convulse and flail "violently," and his movements prevented paramedics from treating him at which point a Toronto police officer handcuffed the man's hands to a stretcher so he could be treated while his one hand was later freed so that medication could be given to him.&lt;ref name="SIU-sept-2014"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/police-had-nothing-to-do-with-veld-festival-death-siu-says-1.2756121|title=Police had 'nothing to do' with Veld festival death, SIU says|agency=[[CBC News]]|publisher=[[CBC.ca]]|date=4 September 2014|accessdate=1 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SIU report also states the man was subsequently rushed to hospital and went into cardiac arrest en route at which point his remaining handcuffs were removed and the ambulance stopped, but he could not be revived by paramedics or hospital staff.&lt;ref name="SIU-sept-2014"/&gt;

In reaction to the deaths, Toronto [[Toronto City Council|city councilor]] [[Giorgio Mammoliti]] released a statement saying festival organizers INK Entertainment, and INK chief executive Charles Khabouth were partially responsible for the deaths, "due to their negligence and poor security measures".&lt;ref name="Mammoliti-aug-2014"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Karstens-Smith|first1=Gemma|last2=Dale|first2=Daniel|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2014/08/05/mammoliti_blames_veld_festival_deaths_on_promoters_2_councillors.html|title=Mammoliti blames Veld festival deaths on promoters, 2 councillors|publisher=''[[Toronto Star]]''|date=5 August 2014|accessdate=1 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mammoliti's statement additionally blamed fellow councilors [[Gord Perks]] and [[Mike Layton]] for the deaths.&lt;ref name="Mammoliti-aug-2014"/&gt; Through its lawyer James Zibarras, INK Entertainment immediately demanded full retraction from Mammoliti, threatening legal action if one is not issued within 48 hours.&lt;ref name="Mammoliti-aug-2014"/&gt; On late Friday afternoon, 8 August 2014, almost a full day after the deadline set by INK's lawyer, Mammoliti formally retracted his earlier statement that blamed Khabouth and INK; the company didn't pursue legal action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Dale|first=Daniel|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/city_hall/toronto2014election/2014/08/08/mammoliti_retracts_statement_blaming_organizer_for_deaths_at_music_festival.html|title=Mammoliti retracts statement blaming organizer for deaths at music festival|publisher=''[[Toronto Star]]''|date=8 August 2014|accessdate=1 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Former assets==
===Stilife===
'''Stilife''' was an upscale Toronto nightclub that ran from 1987 until 1995 in a 1920s six-storey brick building at the southwest corner of Richmond and Duncan Streets. Opening in October 1987 in the building's basement with a [[dirt floor]], it was run in very hands-on fashion by young entrepreneur Charles Khabouth who leased the 6,000 square foot space&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clubland.ca/Players/CharlesKhabouth.html Khabouth]&lt;/ref&gt; at an extremely cheap rate of C$4 per square foot.&lt;ref name="globe-stilife"/&gt; Despite being located in a then-deserted part of Toronto's former Garment District, Stilife quickly managed to develop an image of exclusivity, becoming a favourite hangout for Toronto's posh crowd. The club was populated by attractive, well-heeled patrons that had to pass a strict door policy designed to attract glamorous, high-income clientele.&lt;ref name="thenandnow-stilife"&gt;{{cite news|last=Benson|first=Denise|url=http://thenandnowtoronto.com/2014/11/then-now-stilife/|title=Then &amp; Now: Stilife|agency=ThenAndNowToronto.com|date=17 November 2014|accessdate=5 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after opening Stilife, Khabouth sold Club Z, a Yonge and Wellesley area club that was his first entrepreneurial effort in the hospitality industry, in order to fully concentrate on his ambitious new venue. In complete contrast to Club Z that was open to anyone who wanted to dance, Khabouth went out of his way to make every single aspect of Stilife exclusive.&lt;ref name="torlife-mar-2013"&gt;{{cite news|last=Hough|first=Robert|url=http://torontolife.com/food/charles-khabouth-profile/|title=The scraps, stunts and multi-million-dollar investments behind Charles Khabouth’s empire of cool|agency=''[[Toronto Life]]''|date=5 March 2013|accessdate=5 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal was attracting a more mature, sophisticated, and free-spending urban crowd rather than settling for suburban youth that many downtown Toronto clubs catered to at the time.&lt;ref name="globe-stilife"/&gt; Inspired by the look of the recently opened [[Phoenix Concert Theatre|Diamond]] club at Sherbourne Street whose interior differed significantly from the standard brass-and-mirrors decor of the numerous clubs in the city, Khabouth devoted particular attention to his new venue's interior design.{{sfn|Wilson|2006|p=51}}&lt;ref name="globe-stilife"/&gt; He hired Toronto-based [[Yabu Pushelberg]] design studio (consisting of George Yabu and Glenn Pushelberg who would go on to achieve international renown, but were still largely unknown outside of the city) to come up with ideas for the club's interior. They traveled to New York City for inspiration,&lt;ref name="globe-stilife"/&gt; ending up with dark, sculptured aesthetic and edgy, industrial design, which featured a heavy use of polished steel, concrete, and mosaic tile. The chain walls created by long chains hanging off the club's ceiling were a particularly big draw.&lt;ref name="globe-stilife"/&gt; Furthermore, Stilife's core interior elements referenced [[Art Deco]], [[Salvador Dalí]], and ''[[Blade Runner]]''.&lt;ref name="thenandnow-stilife"/&gt;

In addition to attracting the rich of Toronto, Stilife soon gained a reputation as a celebrity hangout with notable guests such as [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] (dropped by in late May 1990 during her [[Blond Ambition World Tour]]), [[George Michael]], and [[Prince (musician)|Prince]] further fueling its success and enhancing its status.&lt;ref name="thenandnow-stilife"/&gt;

In terms of the music played, Stilife covered a wide range of sounds and themed nights. Many Toronto DJs worked the venue, but two left their mark especially — Richard Vermeulen who was the resident on Tuesdays for most of the club's run and JC Sunshine whose residency was Fridays.&lt;ref name="thenandnow-stilife"/&gt; Vermeulen particularly proved adept at combining genres, spinning an eclectic mix that covered the range from [[Ted Nugent]]'s "[[Stranglehold (Ted Nugent song)|Stranglehold]]" over to [[James Brown]], disco, funk, and hard rock, until [[Bomb the Bass]]' "[[Beat Dis]]", [[Eric B. &amp; Rakim]]'s "[[Paid in Full (Eric B. &amp; Rakim song)|Paid in Full]]", and [[Baby Ford]]'s "Oochy Coochy".&lt;ref name="thenandnow-stilife"/&gt; DJ Mark Oliver joined Stilife in 1990 after the closure of Tazmanian Ballroom and became resident on Mondays that were popular with [[voguing]] gay men; for Oliver this marked the beginning of a long collaboration with Khabouth and Ink that would later continue in his other clubs.&lt;ref name="thenandnow-stilife"/&gt;

By early 1990s numerous new nightclubs opened along Richmond Street West and Adelaide Street West as well as in adjoining streets within the area bound by Front St., Queen Street West, [[Bathurst Street (Toronto)|Bathurst St.]], and Simcoe St. all of which was a consequence of low rent in the said area and Khabouth's success with Stilife there.&lt;ref name="thenandnow-stilife"/&gt; Among them were: '''Go-Go''' (a three-level superclub opened by the Ballinger brothers in 1990 across the street from Stilife at the north-west corner of Richmond &amp; Duncan), '''23 Hop''' (a minimalist all-ages club opened by Wesley Thuro during summer 1990 in a warehouse down the street from Stilife at 318 Richmond that would soon become a catalyst for the Toronto rave scene), '''Venus''', '''Klub Max''' (a huge venue started in 1990 by Nick DiDonato and Angelo Belluz in a heritage building on Peter St. just south of King Street West that previously housed DiDonato's P.M. Toronto sports bar and restaurant), '''LimeLight''' (in 1993 by businessman Zisi Konstantinou at 250 Adelaide Street West near the corner with Duncan Street), '''My Apartment''' (a club in an old shoe factory building at 81 Peter Street playing Top 40 music), and '''Club 606'''. At the same time, Khabouth for his part attempted, and mostly failed, to expand into fine dining with his involvement in several restaurants — Boa Cafe, Oceans, Acrobat, and Bellair Cafe — quickly ending, either via him pulling out of the venture or the venues folding. Most of those restaurants were in the [[Yorkville, Toronto|Yorkville]] upscale neighbourhood where in 1992 he also opened Skorpio nightclub that closed by 1994.&lt;ref name="thenandnow-stilife"/&gt; In late 1995 after eight years of successful operation, Khabouth sold Stilife, describing the decision as being motivated by his desire to expand and the inability to do so at the Richmond and Duncan location due to space, capacity, and ceiling height constraints.&lt;ref name="thenandnow-stilife"/&gt;

Right away in 1995, Fluid nightclub opened at the location vacated by Stilife.&lt;ref name="thenandnow-stilife"/&gt; The new club was also successful, continuing until 2009 including a slight mid-2000s makeover and re-branding as Fluid Lounge. In February 2010 Pop Nightclub opened in the same location, but folded quickly. Over the coming decades Khabouth has occasionally organized one-off Stilife retro parties in Toronto under the 'A Return To Stilife' moniker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bosworth|first=Lori|url=http://www.torontonicity.com/2014/04/30/suzanne-rogers-hosts-zac-posen-fashion-show-at-the-carlu/|title=Suzanne Rogers Hosts Zac Posen Fashion Show at The Carlu|agency=Torontonicity.com|date=30 April 2014|accessdate=13 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oceans===
In late 1989, emboldened by the rapid success of his Stilife nightclub, 27-year-old Charles Khabouth opened '''Oceans''' restaurant in the same building as a companion piece, attempting to transfer some of the nightclub's sexy upscale vibe into the dining setting. He recruited celebrity chef Greg Couillard and the restaurant even got featured on the ''[[Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous]]'' TV show. However, things quickly started to unravel and by July 1990 Couillard quit, taking most of the kitchen staff with him. His replacement was [[Susur Lee]], another high-profile chef, but he only lasted a few weeks.&lt;ref name="torlife-mar-2013"/&gt; The restaurant got merged into Stilife by year's end.&lt;ref name="globe-stilife"/&gt;

The high-profile failure of Oceans got Khabouth a bit of a tarnished reputation on the Toronto entertainment scene that followed him in various forms throughout subsequent decades as far as his involvement with dining is concerned — the charge that food is secondary in his restaurants. Joanne Kates, ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' food critic at the time, claimed "Khabouth never intended the food to be important at Oceans", further stating that the restaurant imploded "once he realized he couldn't run it as a club and efficiently make money".&lt;ref name="globe-stilife"/&gt; Khabouth identified the inability of celebrity chefs to subordinate as the main reason for Oceans failure: "I had a hard time working with some of these chefs. With celebrity chefs, it's like you work for them".&lt;ref name="globe-stilife"/&gt;

===Boa Café===
Opened in Yorkville in October 1989&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Weil|first=Bernard|url=http://www.gettyimages.ca/detail/news-photo/no-cramp-to-stilife-style-boa-cafe-which-opened-in-news-photo/502841675?license|title=No cramp to stilife style|agency=[[Getty Images]]|date=23 October 1989|accessdate=13 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a collaboration between Khabouth (at the time owner of successful upscale nightclub Stilife) and fellow young Lebanese-Canadian Rony Hitti, '''Boa Café''' was a venue that brought fine dining and club culture together.&lt;ref name="thenandnow-boa"&gt;{{cite news|last=Benson|first=Denise|url=http://thenandnowtoronto.com/2014/11/then-now-boa-cafe/|title=Then &amp; Now: Boa Café|agency=ThenAndNowToronto.com|date=30 November 2014|accessdate=6 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hitti, who studied finance and politics at [[York University]] while DJing at various Toronto clubs during the 1980s befriended Khabouth at Stilife.&lt;ref name="thenandnow-boa"/&gt; Traveling to Montreal together, the two went to a place called Lola's Paradise and thought Toronto could use a similar venue — a late-night dining spot catering to the Stilife crowd that had very few eating options after the 1 a.m. last call.&lt;ref name="thenandnow-boa"/&gt; They found a spot at 25 Bellair Street that previously housed a daytime coffee shop and after extensive renovations opened Boa Café to much fanfare in October 1989 as 50/50 partners.&lt;ref name="thenandnow-boa"/&gt; Chic and trendy, Boa served food and drinks from noon until late night five days a week. Though the venue received plenty of positive notices in local press, it faced financial problems in its first year. These issues coincided with the problems Khabouth was experiencing with Stilife due to the Oceans restaurant that he opened as an adjoining piece in the same building. The relationship between Hitti and Khabouth soured and by 1991 the two decided to go their separate ways.&lt;ref name="thenandnow-boa"/&gt;

Hitti took over the venue, reorganized it by making it more focused on food than drinking. It continued running with much success until 1998.&lt;ref name="thenandnow-boa"/&gt;

===Acrobat===
Despite his continued success with Stilife nightclub in the late 1980s and early 1990s, Khabouth experienced trouble expanding into the dining aspect of the hospitality industry with his involvement in two high-profile restaurants - Boa Café and Oceans - quickly turning sour.

Almost immediately, Khabouth jumped into another high-profile project, again in Yorkville, but this time in partnership with established Toronto restaurateur Franco Prevedello. Following numerous delays and C$1.4 million in renovations, they opened '''Acrobat''' in June 1992 at 1221 Bay Street, catering to upscale Yorkville clientele with a restaurant-nightclub hybrid.&lt;ref name="torlife-dec-2005"/&gt; However, their relationship quickly soured and Khabouth got out of the venture the same year, selling his share to Prevedello.&lt;ref name="torlife-mar-2013"/&gt; Apparently, they weren't seeing eye to eye due to Khabouth wanting to make Acrobat a supper club where people dined and danced while Prevedello was only interested in the dining part.&lt;ref name="torlife-mar-2013"/&gt; The restaurant continued under Prevedello until 1994.

===Bellair Café===
The famous '''Bellair Café''' in Yorkville at 100 Cumberland St. had been closed for four years when Khabouth decided to revive it in 1995. It first opened in 1981 under the ownership of famous Toronto restaurateur and nightclub owner Tom Kristenbrun who had by this time already been involved with the [[El Mocambo]] live music venue and the upscale Bemelmans restaurant.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chefdb.com/nm/336/Tom-Kristenbrun Tom Kristenbrun on ChefDB]&lt;/ref&gt; Like Bemelmans, Kristenbrun's other fine dining Yorkville menu, nearby Bellair Café also became a place to see and be seen, attracting local stars like [[Bryan Adams]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Slaughter|first=Mike|url=http://www.gettyimages.ca/detail/news-photo/music-star-bryan-adams-hams-it-up-at-bellair-cafe-news-photo/502253949|title=Music star Bryan Adams hams it up at Bellair Cafe|agency=[[Getty Images]]|date=19 September 1985|accessdate=22 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as visiting celebrities such as [[Bruce Willis]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Weil|first=Bernard|url=http://www.gettyimages.ca/detail/news-photo/actor-bruce-willis-left-holds-court-at-the-bellair-cafe-in-news-photo/502313247|title=Actor Bruce Willis holds court at the Bellair Cafe in Yorkville |agency=[[Getty Images]]|date=8 September 1989|accessdate=22 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Gere]], and [[Robert Altman]],&lt;ref name="globe-dec-2006"&gt;{{cite news|last=Kelly|first=Deirdre|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/the-search-for-a-new-it-spot/article4113786/|title=The search for a new it spot|agency=''[[The Globe and Mail]]''|date=16 December 2006|accessdate=22 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; especially during The Festival of Festivals (later renamed the [[Toronto International Film Festival]]).&lt;ref name="torstar-aug-2010"&gt;{{cite news|last=Zekas|first=Rita|url=https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/movies/2010/08/25/yorkville_has_own_brand_of_star_power.html|title=Yorkville has own brand of star power|agency=''[[Toronto Star]]''|date=25 August 2010|accessdate=22 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The celebrity practice of starting the evening off with a cocktail party at Bellair Café&lt;ref name="torstar-aug-2010"/&gt; before going to their movie's gala opening and afterwards winding up at The Copa nightclub for dancing became well established at the festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Faught|first=Ken|url=http://www.gettyimages.ie/detail/news-photo/actress-helen-shaver-heads-into-the-university-theatre-with-news-photo/502490817|title=Actress Helen Shaver heads into the University theatre with fashion designer Roger Edwards|agency=[[Getty Images]]|date=4 September 1986|accessdate=22 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, Kristenbrun, who in the meantime opened and established additional lucrative fine dining properties such as Rhodes near Yonge &amp; [[St. Clair Avenue|St. Clair]] and [[Bistro 990]] on Bay &amp; Wellesley, got out of the Bellair Café venture and the venue closed.

In 1995, Khabouth (who had already established himself as the owner of influential Stilife nightclub and was in the process of taking over the RPM nightclub, but nevertheless also had a recent string of failed fine dining ventures) decided to try again by resuscitating the famous Bellair Café at the same spot. Staying with the same upscale concept, Bellair under Khabouth continued to attract celebrities as well as movie industry movers and shakers such as [[Harvey Weinstein]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Vlessing|first=Etan|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2010/09/03/us-toronto-cameron-idUSTRE6820CS20100903|title=Toronto film fest boss stays cool under pressure|agency=''[[Reuters]]''|date=2 August 2010|accessdate=22 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It closed less than two years later in 1997, this time for good. Right away, a new restaurant, Sassafraz, opened at Bellair's spot and also went on to become very popular.&lt;ref name="globe-dec-2006"/&gt;

===The Guvernment / Kool Haus complex===
[[File:The Guvernment.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The Guvernment in July 2007.]]
'''[[The Guvernment]]''' was the name of a [[nightclub]] complex in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], Canada. Opened in 1996, it was incarnated from the former RPM nightclub, which closed its doors after ten years at the same location. '''Kool Haus''' was often used as a venue for concerts and live performances. In 2008, [[The Guvernment]] was voted #8 nightclub in the world in [[DJMag]]'s Top 100 Clubs.&lt;ref name="djmag"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.djmag.com/index.php?op=top100club&amp;top100club_op=display&amp;club_top_100_id=8&amp;status=live&amp;limit_num=100&amp;page=1=1# |title=DJ Mag |publisher=djmag.com|accessdate=2015-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional concept rooms included Haven, The Gallery, Surface, Chroma and the rooftop patio, Skybar. The complex was located directly across from [[Lake Ontario]], in downtown [[Toronto]]. The Guvernment / KoolHaus complex was [[Canada]]’s largest and longest running entertainment complex, with a capacity of over 5000. This complex hosted [[Tiësto]], [[Coldplay]], [[Deadmau5]], [[Avicii]], [[Afrojack]], [[Bob Dylan]], [[Lady Gaga]], [[David Guetta]], [[Common (rapper)|Common]], [[N.E.R.D]], [[The Black Eyed Peas]], [[Armin Van Buuren]], and many more over the years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clubcrawlers.com/toronto/nightclub/guvernment |title=Guvernment Nightclub (Toronto) |publisher=Clubcrawlers.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Popular events held in this complex included ''Decadence'' and ''Labour of Love''.

The Guvernment and Koolhaus Entertainment Complex closed its doors on January 31, 2015 and is expected to be replaced by a mixed-use project.&lt;ref name="bisnow"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bisnow.com/commercial-real-estate/toronto/1600-another-icon-bites-the-dust/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140506005658/http://www.bisnow.com/commercial-real-estate/toronto/1600-another-icon-bites-the-dust/ |archive-date=2014-05-06 |dead-url=yes|title=Another Icon Bites The Dust - Real Estate Bisnow (Toronto)|accessdate=2015-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ame===
Japanese cuisine restaurant '''Ame''' opened in September 2009&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kates|first=Joanne|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/restaurant-review-ame/article4196178/|title=Restaurant review: Ame|agency=''[[The Globe and Mail]]''|date=25 September 2009|accessdate=5 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; on 19 Mercer Street in the [[Toronto Entertainment District]] as a collaboration between Khabouth and the Rubino brothers (Michael and [[Guy Rubino|Guy]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Aronovitch|first=Davida|url=http://torontolife.com/food/restaurants/here-comes-the-rain-again-a-peek-inside-guy-and-michael-rubinos-ame/|title=Here comes the Rain again: a peek inside Guy and Michael Rubino’s Ame|agency=''[[Toronto Life]]''|date=3 September 2009|accessdate=5 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the spot where the Rubinos had previously for almost ten years co-owned and operated Rain, a club-like pan-Asian restaurant. Rain closed down in January 2009 for modest renovations as the Rubinos planned on adding a [[sushi]] and [[sashimi]] bar and quickly re-opening.&lt;ref name="torlife-may-2009"&gt;{{cite news|last=Aronovitch|first=Davida|url=http://torontolife.com/food/restaurants/rain-is-now-%E2%80%9Cunrecognizable%E2%80%9D-as-it-becomes-the-all-new-japanese-inspired-ame/|title=Rain is now "unrecognizable" as it becomes the all-new Japanese-inspired Ame|agency=''[[Toronto Life]]''|date=4 May 2009|accessdate=5 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the meantime, they went into business with Ink's Charles Khabouth who convinced them to completely change up the concept. The venue thus re-opened with a new name (Ame), new concept (high end Japanese food), new completely renovated space, and Khabouth as the new business partner.&lt;ref name="torlife-may-2009"/&gt;

In October 2010, Ame held a lavish one-year anniversary party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thecdaily.com/2010/10/10/ames-1st-anniversary |title=Ame’s 1st Anniversary |agency=''The Compendium Daily'' |date=10 October 2010 |accessdate=15 October 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120202102210/http://www.thecdaily.com/2010/10/10/ames-1st-anniversary |archivedate=February 2, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2011 a re-zoning application was submitted to the City of Toronto from a real estate developer wishing to build a residential condominium building on the plot currently occupied by two old buildings, specifically units from 15 to 35 Mercer Street&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.toronto.ca/legdocs/mmis/2011/te/bgrd/backgroundfile-38790.pdf 15-35 Mercer Street - Zoning Amendment Application - Preliminary Report]&lt;/ref&gt; including Ame at the time. The application was eventually rejected.

Ame closed in August 2011 with Michael Rubino attributing its failure to a "difference in vision" between him and Khabouth.&lt;ref name="torlife-mar-2013"/&gt; After renovations that lasted through the second part of 2012, Khabouth opened Buonanotte at the same location in January 2013 as a licensed offshoot of the eponymous Montreal restaurant.

===Briscola Trattoria===
'''Briscola''' opened in February 2011 at 501 [[College Street (Toronto)|College St.]] near [[Palmerston Boulevard]] in [[Little Italy, Toronto|Little Italy]] as a collaboration between Khabouth and Syrian-born Toufik Sarwa at the same spot where Sarwa's short-lived Cinq 01 previously operated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lau|first=Gizelle|url=http://torontolife.com/food/restaurants/introducing-briscola-a-cinq-01s-rustic-italian-successor/|title=Introducing: Briscola, Cinq 01’s rustic Italian successor|agency=''[[Toronto Life]]''|date=25 February 2011|accessdate=5 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Briscola also turned out to have very short lifespan, closing in 2012. By June 2012 Mexican restaurant La Carnita co-owned by Andrew Richmond and Amin Todai opened in its spot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Suen|first=Renée|url=http://torontolife.com/food/restaurants/introducing-la-carnita-2/|title=Introducing: La Carnita, the bricks-and-mortar incarnation of the pop-up taco sensation|agency=''[[Toronto Life]]''|date=15 June 2012|accessdate=5 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Cocktail Parlor at Storys===
After getting introduced to one another in 2011, Ink's Charles Khabouth and Icon Legacy's Hanif Harji forged a business collaboration that began with their October 2011 purchase of the Storys building and continued by opening two restaurants on King West in 2012 — Weslodge Saloon and Patria. By summer 2013 they were ready to launch yet another joint venue — '''The Cocktail Parlor at Storys''', a cocktail lounge on the second floor of the building they acquired almost two years prior.

Inspired by a bar called The Aviary in [[Chicago]],&lt;ref name="globe-jun-2013"/&gt; The Cocktail Parlour featured an extensive 60-cocktail menu along with snacks overseen by executive chef Stuart Cameron who simultaneously performed the same duties at Weslodge and Patria, the other two Khabouth-Harji venues at the time&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Parniak|first=Sarah|url=https://nowtoronto.com/food-and-drink/drinks/the-cocktail-parlor-at-storys/|title=The Cocktail Parlor at Storys|agency=''[[Now (newspaper)|Now]]''|date=29 August 2013|accessdate=26 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with decor that referenced the prohibition era&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://dobbernationloves.com/2014/01/15/review-cocktail-parlor-storys-toronto/|title=Review: The Cocktail Parlor at Storys, Toronto|agency=DobberNationLoves|date=15 January 2014|accessdate=26 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as 1920s and 1930s in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Stortz|first=Martha|url=http://www.blogto.com/bars/cocktail-parlour-storys-toronto|title=The Cocktail Parlor at Storys|agency=BlogTO|date=5 September 2013|accessdate=26 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lau|first=Gizelle|url=http://torontolife.com/food/restaurants/cocktail-parlor-toronto-restaurants/|title=Introducing: The Cocktail Parlor, Charles Khabouth’s new lounge at STORYS on King West|agency=''[[Toronto Life]]''|date=29 July 2013|accessdate=26 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; With its opening timed for the [[2013 Toronto International Film Festival]], The Cocktail Parlor hosted numerous celebrity parties in its first month of operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://torontolife.com/culture/movies-and-tv/tiff-2014-where-to-eat-drink-party/|title=TIFF 2014 Insider’s Guide: Where to Eat, Drink and Party|agency=''[[Toronto Life]]''|date=27 August 2014|accessdate=26 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the March 2014 launch of Byblos restaurant on the Storys building ground floor, The Cocktail Parlor soon closed permanently.

===Product===
'''Product''', previously known as '''This is London''' until late 2012, was a multilevel [[nightclub]] featuring numerous bars, various private lounges, and a ladies spa all with a capacity of 1,200 people. It was set in a renovated 1936 warehouse at 364 Richmond Street West near the corner of Richmond West &amp; Peter in [[Toronto]]'s [[Toronto Entertainment District|Entertainment District]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://clubzone.com/places/barcode-product-upper-level/ |title=Product Nightclub|publisher=clubzone.com |date= |accessdate=22 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 364 Richmond West building first got converted into a nightclub in 2000.&lt;ref name="til-june2015"&gt;{{cite web|last=Hooper|first=Kurtis|url=http://trc.daily-beat.com/news/2015/06/looking-back-at-this-is-london-with-the-closure-of-364-richmonds-club-space/ |title=Look Back at This is London|publisher=TRC |date=June 2015 |accessdate=26 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; After four years of operation, the venue got acquired by INK Entertainment in 2004.&lt;ref name="til-june2015"/&gt; Having gone through several names already, the nightlife venue eventually became known as This is London. INK's idea for the offering of This is London was combining electronic music with Toronto's mid-to-late 2000s upscale scene.&lt;ref name="til-june2015"/&gt; To that end, a steady stream of celebrities including Paris Hilton, [[Jon Jones]], [[Michael Sorrentino]], [[Usher (singer)|Usher]], [[Kardinal Offishall]], etc. came through the club's doors.&lt;ref name="til-june2015"/&gt; On the musical side, Fridays at the club, billed as Soho Fridays, proved popular — featuring numerous [[house music]] acts such as [[Deniz Koyu]], [[Kaskade]], [[Moby]], [[DJ AM]], [[DJ Chus|Chus]] &amp; Ceballos, [[Morgan Page]], [[Mark Knight (sound designer)|Mark Knight]], [[Fedde le Grand]], [[Steve Aoki]], [[Carl Cox]], [[Benny Benassi]], etc.&lt;ref name="til-june2015"/&gt;

By late 2012, This is London re-branded to Product.

From mid 2014, '''Barcode''', night spot with capacity of 450 people, opened on the upper level of Product nightclub.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.clubcrawlers.com/toronto/nightclub/barcode-inside-product/events#3 |title=BARCODE NIGHTCLUB EVENTS|publisher=clubcrawlers.com |date= |accessdate=22 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Product closed in late May 2015&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.clubcrawlers.com/toronto/event/last-call-at-product-final-closing-party |title=LAST CALL AT PRODUCT FINAL CLOSING PARTY|publisher=clubcrawlers.com |date=30 May 2015 |accessdate=22 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the remaining parties moved to the Polson Pier complex, specifically the Solarium venue that was for these occasions billed as '''Barcode by the Lake'''. The reason for Product's closing had to do with the overall trend of residential condos and office buildings being built in the area; after the 364 Richmond West building found itself next to a commercial and office space, the building's landlord offered to buy the nightclub out of its remaining lease.&lt;ref name="til-june2015"/&gt;

===Città===
In December 2014, '''Città''' opened in the [[CityPlace, Toronto|CityPlace]] neighbourhood as a three-way partnership between INK's Khabouth, ICON's Harji, and Adam Brown, the owner of Fox &amp; Fiddle pub franchise in Toronto.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/life/food_wine/restaurants/2014/12/17/restaurant_news_nota_bene_partnership_ends_citta_opens_in_cityplace.html|title=Restaurant news: Nota Bene partnership ends, Citta opens in CityPlace|agency=''[[Toronto Star]]''|date=17 December 2014|accessdate=17 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Pal|first=Jackie|url=http://torontolife.com/food/restaurants/introducing-citta-cityplaces-new-rustic-italian-kitchen/|title=Introducing: Città, CityPlace’s new (but rustic) Italian kitchen|agency=''[[Toronto Life]]''|date=8 January 2015|accessdate=17 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Located on the ground floor of a Concord Pacific condo tower at 92 Fort York Blvd and serving casual Italian cuisine, the owners' initial idea was to treat the 80-seat venue with a 100-person patio as a base to be grown over time into a franchise with a possible second location at Adelaide West &amp; John already under construction.&lt;ref name="PostCity-on-Città-jan-2015"&gt;{{cite news|last=Finestone|first=Jason|url=http://www.postcity.com/Eat-Shop-Do/Eat/January-2015/First-Look-Citta-CityPlace-is-the-first-of-several-casual-Italian-restaurants-by-Khabouth-and-Harji/|title=First Look: Citta CityPlace is the first of several casual Italian restaurants by Khabouth and Harji|agency=''Post City Toronto''|date=13 January 2015|accessdate=17 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; They hired Ben Heaton who previously worked at [[Claudio Aprile]]'s Colborne Lane and [[Mark McEwan]]'s ONE to be Città's first executive chef.&lt;ref name="Nuttall-Smith-on-Città-aug-2015"&gt;{{cite news|last=Nuttall-Smith|first=Chris|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/food-and-wine/restaurant-reviews/citta-and-a3-napoli-one-is-pedestrian-the-other-does-superb-street-food/article26152981/|title=Città and A3 Napoli: One is pedestrian; the other does superb street food|agency=''[[The Globe and Mail]]''|date=28 August 2015|accessdate=8 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The partners also brought on David Mattachioni, a 14-year veteran of the [[Terroni (restaurant)|Terroni]] company, to train the staff and run Città's pizza oven&lt;ref name="Nuttall-Smith-on-Città-aug-2015"/&gt; as well as head baker Carlo Lazzarino also of Terroni.&lt;ref name="PostCity-on-Città-jan-2015"/&gt;

Early reviews focused on Città's decor being more modest than other "luxe, spare-no-expense design" Khabouth-Harji eateries&lt;ref name="Nuttall-Smith-on-Città-aug-2015"/&gt; and its food not being top-notch when compared with "[[Old World]] cooking throughout the city".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://torontolife.com/food/restaurants/review-citta-makes-fun-cityplace-hangout-dont-expect-top-notch-italian/|title=Review: Città makes for a fun CityPlace hangout, but don’t expect top-notch Italian|agency=''[[Toronto Life]]''|date=4 February 2015|accessdate=17 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The restaurant tried to generate some buzz by hosting promotions such as a September 2015 pop-up from prominent [[Brooklyn]] hipster pizzeria [[Roberta's]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Manzocco|first=Natalia|url=https://nowtoronto.com/food-and-drink/food/robertas-pizza-is-coming-to-toronto-for-one-night/|title=ROBERTA'S PIZZA IS COMING TO TORONTO (FOR ONE NIGHT)|agency=''[[Now (newspaper)|Now]]''|date=15 September 2015|accessdate=17 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, Città continually struggled for patrons compared to other CityPlace neighbourhood eateries like Hunter's Landing.&lt;ref name="now-citta-jan-2016"&gt;{{cite news|last=Manzocco|first=Natalia|url=https://nowtoronto.com/food-and-drink/food/citta-to-become-laid-back-mexican-snack-shop/|title=CITTA TO BECOME LAID-BACK MEXICAN SNACK SHOP|agency=''[[Now (newspaper)|Now]]''|date=6 January 2015|accessdate=17 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the same trio of Khabouth, Harji, and Brown opening Figo in November 2015 at Adelaide West &amp; John, site once touted as Città's potential second location, Città's days looked to be numbered. The restaurant closed in late December 2015 with further news about its owners hiring chef Guillermo Herbertson of Barsa Taberna to develop a new Mexican-inspired restaurant concept for an April 2016 opening at the same location focusing largely on inexpensive snack and finger foods.&lt;ref name="now-citta-jan-2016"/&gt;

===Tattoo===
'''Tattoo''', previously known as '''Tattoo Queen West''' and '''Tattoo Rock Parlour''', was a nightclub and live performance venue.

It opened in December 2007 as '''Tattoo Rock Parlour''' via INK's partnership with Nick Di Donato's Liberty Entertainment Group and [[King Street (Toronto)|King Street]] tattoo shop Black Line Studios. Its co-owners Khabouth and Di Donato reportedly spent C$2.5 million on renovating the space before the launch.&lt;ref name="zekas-jan-2008"&gt;{{cite news|last=Zekas|first=Rita|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/2008/01/17/bars_serve_up_more_than_martinis.html|title=Bars serve up more than martinis|publisher=''[[Toronto Star]]''|date=17 January 2008|accessdate=1 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially advertised as [[Canada]]'s only tattoo parlor and bar,&lt;ref name="newswire" /&gt; Tattoo included a two-level event space that could hold over 400 people.&lt;ref name="todotcom-dec-2007"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.toronto.com/article/599131 |title=New in Clubs: Tattoo Rock Parlour |publisher=Toronto.com |date=20 December 2007 |accessdate=2012-08-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121005095815/http://www.toronto.com/article/599131 |archivedate=October 5, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to other Queen West rock clubs such as Velvet Underground and the longstanding [[Bovine Sex Club]], Tattoo was going more for designer décor.&lt;ref name="todotcom-dec-2007"/&gt; Its location at 567 Queen Street West was previously, from 1993 until 2004, occupied by the Di Donato-owned Left Bank nightclub (with Crystal Room lounge bar inside it).

Initially, Tattoo offered a food menu with items ranging from mac-and-cheese to steak.&lt;ref name="zekas-jan-2008"/&gt;

Shifting between live bands and DJ nights, Tattoo has hosted live performances from the likes of [[Dragonette]] (performed the 2008 New Year's concert on 31 December 2007),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Prickett|first=Sarah Nicole|url=http://torontoist.com/2007/12/nye_countdown/|title=New Year’s Eve(ist)|agency=Torontoist.com|date=30 December 2007|accessdate=11 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Killers]], [[Nickelback]], [[Broken Social Scene]] (performed on 24 September 2008 as part of the inaugural [[The Verge (XM)|Verge]] Music Awards), and [[M.I.A. (rapper)|M.I.A.]] (performed on 3 May 2014 as part of [[Canadian Music Week]]). Additionally, it welcomed various celebrities via either event after parties or paid appearances such as [[Avril Lavigne]], [[Gene Simmons]] (hosted a party on 14 September 2010 during [[2010 Toronto International Film Festival|TIFF]]), [[Drew Barrymore]] (attended ''[[Whip It (film)|Whip It]]'' after-party on 13 September 2009),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McNeeley|first=Jen|url=http://legacy.torontolife.com/culture/movies-and-tv/2009/09/15/whip-it-good-drew-barrymore-and-ellen-page-at-tattoo-rock-parlour/|title=Whip It good: Drew Barrymore and Ellen Page at Tattoo Rock Parlour|agency=''[[Toronto Life]]''|date=15 September 2009|accessdate=11 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Slash (musician)|Slash]] (stopped by with bodyguards and partied on 10 September 2010 as part of a paid appearance following a [[Slash 2010–11 World Tour|live concert]] at [[Kool Haus]], another one of Khabouth's venues).&lt;ref&gt;[https://twitter.com/INKent/status/22723679167 INK Twitter]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Abe|first=Fraser|url=http://torontolife.com/culture/movies-and-tv/slash-parties-at-tattoo-rock-parlour-with-a-troupe-of-bodyguards/|title=Slash parties at Tattoo Rock Parlour with a troupe of bodyguards|agency=''[[Toronto Life]]''|date=11 September 2010|accessdate=11 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Journal of Film Preservation''''' ('''''JFP''''') is a journal published twice a year by [[Fédération Internationale des Archives du Film|FIAF]], the [[International Federation of Film Archives]].&lt;ref name=fiaf&gt;{{cite web|title=Journal of Film Preservation|url=http://www.fiafnet.org/pages/Publications/About-the-JFP.html?PHPSESSID=0ea7rtkitiiknu9ocv8l5m3e63|work=FIAF|accessdate=30 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and profile==
The journal was founded in 1972.&lt;ref name=fiaf/&gt; It was published under the title of ''FIAF Information Bulletin'' from 1972 to 1993.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="806">'''Koftos''' ({{lang-el|Κοφτός}}) is a lively [[Greek dance]] typical of the areas of [[Thessaly]], [[Epirus]] and central [[Greece]]. "Koftos" in Greek means to cut and the name of the dance comes from the periodic interruptions in the music/tune.  When the music stops, the dancers yell "Hey", and you can also put your arms up, down, or clap. This sta dio (two-measure) style dance is a faster [[syrtos]] (Syrtos, Sirto, Sirtos), that can also be danced going backwards and forwards or with partners.

'''Lapa''' is a neighborhood in the city of [[Rio de Janeiro]], in [[Brazil]]. It is located in the centre of Rio and is famous for its historical monuments and nightlife.

The neighborhood is home to the [[Arcos da Lapa]], an impressive [[aqueduct (bridge)|aqueduct]] constructed in the mid-18th century by [[Colonial Brazil|colonial authorities]]. Another important historical attraction is the [[Passeio Público (Rio de Janeiro)|Passeio Público]], the first public park of the city, built in the 1780s.

Since the early 1950s, Lapa has been known for its lively cultural life where there is a concentration of many restaurants and bars where Brazilian artists and intellectuals would meet. It was, and still is, famous for its many restaurants, bars and clubs where the various forms of [[Brazilian music]] can be appreciated, like the ''Asa Branca'' bar and the ''Fundição Progresso''. The [[Sala Cecília Meireles]], an important venue for [[chamber music]], is also located in Lapa.

==Arcos da Lapa==
[[File:Arcos de Carioco or Grand Aqueduct in Rio de Janeiro.jpg|thumb|right|220px|The Aqueduct, and settlement in 1792]]
[[File:Arcos da Lapa.jpg|thumb|right|220px|The [[Carioca Aqueduct]], also known as Arcos da Lapa.]]
The neighborhood of Lapa, Rio de Janeiro, known as the cradle of bohemian Rio is also famous for its architecture, starting with the Arcos - known as the Arcos da Lapa, constructed to act as conduit in the days of colonial Brazil and now serve as a signal for the cable cars that climb the hill of [[Santa Teresa, Rio de Janeiro|Santa Teresa]].

The Carioca Aqueduct is considered the architectural work of greater importance of Old Rio and one of the main symbols of the city. The impressive Roman-style building is 17.6 meters high, 270 meters long and 42 arches that connect the neighborhood of Santa Teresa to Morro de Santo Antônio. The Carioca Aqueduct was built in 1723, during the colonial Brazil, and was intended to lead water from the Carioca river height Morro do Desterro, on Santa Teresa for the Morro de Santo Antônio. The work would help solve the problem of water shortage in the city. Problem that was already old. Studies to bring the waters of the Carioca river to the city began in the early years of the seventeenth century, but the works of installing water pipes in Rio de Janeiro did not start until a century later.

In recent times the landscape of Lapa has been significantly amended. Where was the Square of the Brazilian armed forces (a square attached to the arches) today there is a huge Circo Voador. Arches Street, which crosses the aqueduct, was via a building occupied by trees, including the Progress Casting, which is now a venue. The neighborhood is born at the end of the south, where the road of glory becomes Rua da Lapa. Also on the border of Santa Teresa, climbing its slopes and the small neighborhood of Fátima.

In an attempt to rescue the vocation of the residential district was created the Movement "I am from Lapa". Inspired by the famous advertising campaign "I love NY", who helped revitalize the American city that was in decline in the 1970s, the movement seeks to rescue the pride of saying "I'm from Lapa ". With government support and participation of the majority of shops in Lapa, the "I am from Lapa" was spread around town, but with few effective achievements in the area of security, rehabilitation of the homeless and combating crime, old complaints from residents public authorities.

With the population density in other regions of the city and increased traffic, the neighborhood, which holds the headquarters and administrative buildings for many large companies (Petrobras, BNDES, etc..) As well as numerous commercial buildings of high standard on Chile Avenue (Ventura I and II, etc..), has also attracted the attention of residents of the north, south and west of Rio de Janeiro, eager to live close to work, downtown, escaping from traffic jams. Therefore, newly launched residential projects providing comprehensive infrastructure or structure apart-hotel (Viva Lapa, Cores da Lapa, etc..) Have exhausted their sales in full release, which clearly shows the pent-up demand for housing in standard high in the neighborhood.

==Culture==
[[File:1920x2560 escalas lapa rio de janeiro brasil.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Escadaria Selarón]]
Reference point for lovers of nightlife, one of the striking features of the neighborhood is the harmony that living with the most diverse urban tribes. Since the 1950s, when it began to be called the "Montmartre Carioca", Lapa attracted intellectuals, artists, politicians and especially the people of Rio, who come together to celebrate the [[samba]], [[forró]], MPB (música popular brasileira), [[choro]] and more recently, electronic music and rock.

For the major pathways, Mem de Sá, Rua do Riachuelo Street and Lavradio, spread attractions such as the Sala Cecilia Meireles, who is considered one of the best concert of chamber music existing in Rio.

The Public Promenade, the National School of Music, the Church of Our Lady of Lapa do Desterro and the [[Escadaria Selarón]] are references to the tourist who wants to see a sample of the architecture of old Rio.

==Music== 
As highlights of the night, there are the famous Asa Branca, the main stronghold of forró, bars Seed, where there have been artists such as Teresa and the group Casuarina, Ernesto, Coffee Cultural Sacrilege beyond the River and Scenarium Carioca da Gema, where absolute reign wheels samba. Recently opened the gaff Lapa 40 Graus, in Brook Street next to the traditional Democratic Club, which had space for the dance, the samba, choro and gaff. 
For the public that prefers electronic music and rock concerts, there is the Progress and Casting Flying Circus, opened in 2004. There is also a plethora of bars and venues that cater to all tastes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9164">On February 20, 2012, '''Le Grand David and His Spectacular Magic Company''' celebrated its 35th anniversary.  The company was then the longest consecutively running stage [[Magic (illusion)|magic]] show in the world, according to [[Guinness World Records]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kaminskiauctions.com/announcing-the-auction-of-the-le-grand-david-spectacular-magic-show/ Announcing the Auction of The Le Grand David Spectacular Magic Show]&lt;/ref&gt; Marco the Magi (Cesareo Pelaez) started the show in the 1970s.&lt;ref name="David"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.boston.com/ae/theater_arts/articles/2010/03/19/33_years_later_time_leaves_its_mark_on_le_grand_david_show/  |title=Trying to keep the magic in the air: 35 years later, time leaves its mark on Le Grand David show |first1=Linda |last1=Matchan |date=March 8, 2010 |publisher=[[Boston Globe]] |accessdate=April 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The family-oriented stage magic show ran most Sundays at the [[Cabot Street Cinema Theatre]] and some Thursdays at the [[Larcom Theatre]] in [[Beverly, Massachusetts]] through the Spring of 2012.

== Overview ==
On February 20, 1977, with little advance publicity, ''Le Grand David and his own Spectacular Magic Company'' made its debut on the stage of the Cabot Street Cinema Theatre, and ran for 35 years. In 1985, the Le Grand David Company opened a second two-hour spectacle of magic, music, comedy, and dance at Beverly's other antique playhouse, the Larcom Theatre. The two productions showcase: over 1000 costumes, 700 entrances and exits, 100 classic illusions, 45 backdrops, 35 years in a small town, 4 hours of stage magic, and 2 antique theaters. The shows were produced, directed, designed and choreographed by Marco the Magi.

In the spring of 2012 it was announced that 
*the Cabot and Larcom productions would cease;
*the Cabot St. Cinema Theatre would continue showing films only; and
*that both theaters and adjoining spaces would be available for rental for functions.

An auction of props, artwork, bronzes and memorabilia was held on February 23, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cabotcinemamovies.com/cabotcinemamovies.com/Enter_Cabot_Street_Cinema_Theatre_Beverly_MA_Movies_files/PgA7.png&lt;/ref&gt; With over 200 items available, the auction was conducted by Kaminski Auctioneers.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kaminskiauctions.com/servlet/Search.do?auctionId=15&amp;&amp;page=1&amp;perPage=20&amp;orderBy=&lt;/ref&gt;

== Marco the Magi ==

Marco the Magi (Cesareo Pelaez, October 16, 1932 - March 24, 2012) is billed as the troupe’s founder, producer, director, designer, and choreographer. He was also a star in both productions. He began to organize his troupe in the early 1970s and brought it to Beverly. The aging Cabot Cinema became available in 1976, and the company Marco already had been forming acquired the playhouse outright. A biography of Cesareo Pelaez (Wonderful Surprises, author Avrom Surath) was published in April 2007 (second, updated edition in March 2012) relating Pelaez's early experiences growing up in Cuba, his work with noted psychologist [[Abraham Maslow]], his founding Le Grand David Spectacular Magic Company, and his ongoing work with the company to 2012, the year of his death.

== Le Grand David ==

Le Grand David (David Bull) began as an apprentice to Marco in the early 1970s, and is a generation younger than Marco. According to magic historian Stuart Cramer, “Le Grand David is an extraordinarily skillful magician and showman. He adds youth, verve, and graceful motion to a show filled with color and action. David’s manipulation of the Zombie [floating silver ball] is the best I have ever even the immortal Neil Foster’s.” (MAGICOL: A Journal of the Magic Collectors’ Association, November, 1993)

==Company history==
{{Anchor|Le Grand David Spectacular Magic Company History}}
{{refimprove section|date=January 2018}}

By 1976, the Cabot Cinema seemed on the downslope of its career, offering last-run movies for pocket change. A corporation called White Horse Productions was formed to buy and renovate it. Spearheading the project was the man now known as Marco the Magi, aided by business and artistic friends. The Cabot was kept open as a movie house, renamed the [[Cabot Street Cinema Theatre]] with a revamped film program.

Meanwhile, the troupe undertook a concentrated effort to restore her full stage, which lay thick with the dust of fifty years’ disuse. Office space above Cabot Street was transformed into workshops for carpenters, painters, and seamstresses. The hundreds of props and scenic elements turned out during six months’ work were gradually put into play in after-hours rehearsals. An entertainment calendar published every two weeks began announcing the debut of a stage attraction just after holiday time 1976.

On a day remembered for heavy snow and a sizable, receptive house, Le Grand David and his own Spectacular Magic Company premiered Sunday, February 20, 1977. Headed by Marco and his one-time apprentice David, the company of several dozen performers gave weekly Sunday matinée performances until mid-May. Then a second Sunday show was added, at 8:15&amp;nbsp;p.m. By mid-summer even this schedule was not enough to meet demand. “The Whirlwind of Enchantment” offered eighteen shows in a fortnight. Boston-area theatergoers and the regional media were beginning to catch wind of Beverly’s enchantment.

It would be three years before the story went international, carried around the globe by the likes of [[TIME]] and [[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian magazines]] and an enthralled magic press. Robert Lund (1920–1995), founder and curator of the American Museum of Magic in Marshall, Michigan, dubbed it “the finest magic show in the world today.”

The Le Grand David Spectacular Magic Company  soon became a cultural institution. Seven performances at the White House in Washington, D.C., over 40 cover stories in magic periodicals followed. Robert Lund wrote, “Of all the practitioners of the presto trade in the U.S., none has better credentials to the title of America’s national magic company than Le Grand David.” The esteemed British magic historian and collector Dr. [[Edwin Dawes]] called the Beverly bafflers “magicdom’s most incredible venture.”{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

Building on the success of the Cabot effort, the Le Grand David Spectacular Magic Company purchased the [[Larcom Theatre]], just four blocks away, in 1984 and launched a restoration project that dwarfed their previous [[Cabot Street Cinema Theatre]] restoration . The Larcom received a balcony-to-boiler-room renovation. In October 1985 the Le Grand David troupe premiered a second resident production of conjuring, music, comedy and dance “in the style and tradition of the turn of the last century.”{{attribution needed|date=November 2011}} ''An Anthology of Stage Magic'' continues to play there.

In 1995, the Le Grand David Company opened an expanded wing adjoining the original Larcom structure. The new wing includes: the Grand Salon lobby appointed in oak, marble, and brass, rehearsal place, three galleries of Le Grand David apparatus and poster artwork, a library, a meeting room, a guest suite, and a caretaker's apartment.

== Honors ==

*The Le Grand David troupe has been called “America’s national magic company” by historian Robert Lund. Like the theatres in which it performs, the magic company’s thirty years of continuous performances have given its community a source of genuine pride.
*TIME magazine proclaims in its two-page spread: “With the crash of a gong, the curtain flies up and smoke billows out from the stage as a team of magicians begins 2½ hours of joyous entertainment that recalls the most opulent days of vaudeville . . . . Spectacular it is . . . The real magic about Le Grand David is the cast and their locale. The show goes on not on Broadway but in Beverly, Mass., a Boston suburb, though it looks as lushly endowed as any Great White Way musical,” ([[Jeff Melvoin]], “Conjuring Only On Sundays,” TIME magazine, May 12, 1980).
*The Theatre Historical Society of America brought the attendees from its 2006 Conclave to Beverly to tour the Cabot and Larcom Theatres. The society presented Marco with a special recognition—the first of its kind—for “CREATING THEATRE HISTORY By Contributing To The Rich Legacy Of America’s Historic Theatres.”

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15575">This is a list of [[live action role-playing game]] groups. This is for active or once active groups that run or organize games.  It is not a list of game systems.

__NOTOC__
{{Compact ToC|side=yes}}
&lt;!--

STOP - ASK YOURSELF THE FOLLOWING QUESTION - IS MY LARP THE SUBJECT OF MULTIPLE INDEPENDENT SOURCES ? IF IT IS NOT - IT DOES NOT BELONG HERE AND WILL BE REMOVED.

When adding groups:

1. Link to internal Wikipedia pages, not home pages for the groups themselves.  A link to the group's home page is appropriate on the group's Wikipedia article.

2. Include a _brief_ description.  Keep it brief; visitors can see the full article through the link if they want more information.  Try to include useful information to help a visitor select useful resources.
 Useful things might include genre (fantasy, modern, sci-fi, horror, etc), style (boffer combat, theatrical), and location (eastern US, a specific city).  Try to stick to words and descriptions in the [[live action role-playing game]] article; "boffer combat" or "physical combat" is well known and more likely to be useful than "Enhanced realism combat".  Don't mention that it's a "LARP," it's obvious from context, otherwise it doesn't belong on this page.

3. This is a list of _groups_, not game systems.  So the "Camarilla" might be appropriate, but "Minds Eye Theatre" is not.  A separate [[List of live action role-playing games]] might be appropriate, but this is not it.

'''The Media Practice Model''' is a media effects model used within the area of [[mass communication]].  This model was developed by '''Jeanne R. Steele''' and '''Jane D. Brown''' in 1995, and it takes a practice perspective which means that it focuses on everyday activities and routines of [[media consumption]]. This [[theoretical]] framework was developed to better understand what drives [[teenagers]] to pick one media source over another, and what factors play a role in this decision. The Media Practice Model emphasizes the constant interaction between consumers and the media, and focuses on the [[dialectical]] aspect of this interaction, suggesting that it is the adolescents’ individual characteristics, environment and daily practices that allow the media to have stronger or weaker effects on them (Steele &amp; Brown, 1995).&lt;ref&gt;Steele, J.R., &amp; Brown, J.D. (1995). Adolescent room culture: Studying media in the context of everyday life. Journal of Youth and Adolescence, 24(5), 551.  Retrieved November 30, 2010, from ABI/INFORM Global. (Document ID: 12036417)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin ==

The model was developed based on a study that progressed from 1987 through 1993, and used a variety of methods such as daily [[newspaper|journals]], in-depth [[interviews]], self-administered [[questionnaires]] and “room touring” to understand, as the Steele and Brown call it, the adolescents’ “room [[culture]].” This environment was chosen based on the facts that adolescents’ bedrooms are usually cluttered with different media materials and sources, as well as the fact that this is a place where adolescents spend a good part of their day. This is also a place that provides an intimate environment where adolescents can experiment with possible selves (Markus &amp; Nurius, 1986).&lt;ref&gt;Markus, H., &amp; Nurius, P. (1986). Possible selves. Am. Psychol. 41: 954-969&lt;/ref&gt; The Media Practice Model was based on the findings of this first study, and the incorporation of other media effects theories such as [[Selective Exposure Theory]], [[Uses and Gratifications]], [[Framing (social sciences)|Framing]], [[Cultivation theory]], and Emotional Conditioning.

== Components ==

The Media Practice Model proposed by Steele and Brown has the concepts of selection, [[interaction]] and application as the three main components, but also takes into account one’s [[Identity formation|identity]] and lived experience. [[Identity formation]] is the key component of this model and it represents the main task of adolescent formation (Steele &amp; Brown, 1995). It is believed that adolescents’ sense of who they are influences their interactions with the media, and those interactions in turn influence their sense of who they are, in what Steele and Brown call an ongoing process of [[cultural]] production and reproduction. The [[theoretical]] perspective of “'''lived through experience'''” ([[Vygotsky]], 1978),&lt;ref&gt;Vygotsky, L.S. (1978). Mind in Society: The Development of Higher Psychological Processes. In M. Cole, V. John-Steiner, S. Scribner, and E. Souberman (Eds.). Harvard University Press, Cambridge, MA.&lt;/ref&gt; also takes into account the [[Developmental stage theories|developmental stage]], the [[sociocultural]] differences based on gender, class, and race, as well as other factors such as [[religious beliefs]], interactions within one’s neighborhood, school, family, friends circle, and so on. This concept of “lived experience” emphasizes the idea that adolescents’ interaction with the media does not happen in a vacuum. It is argued that the continuous dialectal relationship between the other four components of the Media Practice Model, selection, interaction, application, and identity, all occur within the context of “lived experience (Steele &amp; Brown, 1995).” 
	

'''Selection''', within the Media Practice Model, is simply defined as the act of choosing among media related alternatives (Steele &amp; Brown, 1995). Selection is influenced by [[motivation]]s, which in turn affects [[attention]] to the media selected. In this context, the concept of motivation is defined based on previous theories such as [[Selective exposure theory|selective exposure]] and [[uses and gratifications theory]]. This means that a teenager’s motivation to attend to certain media might be based on [[affective]], [[behavioral]], [[cognitive]] and [[Instrumental value|instrumental]] needs, or it could also simply be a result of [[habituation]] (Steele &amp; Brown, 1995). As far as factoring in “lived experience”, in their initial study Steele and Brown found that selection is also influenced by gender and race. Thus, boys were more likely to be more interested in media that dealt with sports, and this was also reflected in how their rooms were decorated. Also, an African-American girl was more interested in magazines and certain types of music that reflected her [[ethnic heritage]]. 
	

'''Interaction''' is defined as the [[cognitive]], [[affective]], and [[behavioral]] engagement with the media that produces [[cultural]] meanings, which are affected by adolescents’ evaluation and interpretation of the media content. In terms of practice, interaction was conceptually defined as what is actually happening at the moment adolescent use the media (Steele &amp; Brown, 1995). As noted in the definition, adolescents can interact with the media on different levels such as cognitive (processing information), affective (arousal), or behavioral (dancing, channel surfing, etc.). However, researchers in communication have been more concerned with the cognitive and affective interactions, and adolescents’ evaluation and interpretation of media content are clearly more closely related to those two types of interactions.

:''Evaluation'' and ''interpretation'' of media content are also believed to play an important role in the process of [[identity formation]]. Thus, adolescents are more likely to prefer characters that they can relate to, that match with who they are or would like to become (Steele &amp; Brown, 1995). In their study, Steele and Brown (1995) came across different interpretation and evaluation of the media, as teenagers were trying to make sense of the messages the media were conveying. This process of sense making is sometimes very complex, as teenagers are trying to understand themselves and the world around them by trying to balance their already formed beliefs and worldviews, with the sometimes contradictory messages of the media (Steele &amp; Brown, 1995).

The concept of “lived experience” was shown to have a role in the interaction component of the model as well. As found by Steele and Brown, [[racial]] understanding, class and gender also affected how teenagers interpreted and evaluated the messages conveyed by the media.

'''Application''' is defined as the [[Concrete (philosophy)|concrete]] ways in which adolescents use media in their everyday lives (Steele &amp; Brown, 1995). The Media Practice Model looks at two different types of application: appropriation and incorporation.

:''Appropriation'' is an active, [[intentional]], easily visible and goal oriented use of the media by adolescents. Steele and Brown (1995) found some typical examples of media appropriation when it comes to teenagers: enhance a mood or cope with feelings; sort through cultural values and norms; make a statement about identity; imitate admired behavior; fantasize about possible selves or situations. ''Incorporation'', on the other hand, is harder to recognize because it is more internal, it is less visible, and most of the times happens [[unconsciously]]. Incorporation refers to taking the messages and beliefs conveyed by the media and making them a part of the [[self]], building on already existing [[Attitude (psychology)|attitudes]], [[feeling]]s and [[knowledge]] (Steele &amp; Brown, 1995). In trying to better explain the concept of incorporation, Steele and Brown (1995) build upon other media effects theories such as framing, cultivation, and emotional conditioning.

== Development ==
	
Based on reviewers’ critiques that the concepts of incorporation and appropriation are one and the same thing, and also based on a new study performed in 1999, Steele slightly revised this component of the Media Practice Model. Based on the study, Steele noticed that within the application component of the model, a new factor stood out: resistance. Resistance was defined as “teens’ practice of using media to open up a space for combating the status quo (Steele, 1999).” This suggests that when adolescents feel marginalized they engage with media that go against the dominant culture. This way they become fans of movies that depict drug usage, are graphically violent or show sexually explicit material, or start listening to less culturally popular genres of music such as [[hard rock]] or [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] (Steele, 1999).&lt;ref&gt;Steele, J. (1999). Teenage Sexuality and Media Practice: Factoring in the Influences of Family, Friends, and School (Book). Journal of Sex Research, 36(4), 331-341. Retrieved from Communication &amp; Mass Media Complete database&lt;/ref&gt; 
	
Besides contributing to the Media Practice Model through the discussed revision to the application component, Steele’s (1999) study also provided more depth to the “lived experience” component. It demonstrated more explicitly how one’s race, gender, and developmental stage plays an important role in their media practices and choices. Also, while acknowledging the importance of media content, this study puts more emphasis on media practice rather than on [[Content (media)|media content]] or [[media effects]].

Since it was first introduced by Steele and Brown in 1995, and then revised in 1999 by Steele, the Media Practice Model has been used by other researchers in different contexts; however, this model has experienced modest popularity. One of the main drawbacks of this model is its general scope and simplified description of media use. Even so, this model allows for the integration of a whole multitude of variables within its main components, and offers scholars the possibility to use it for more in-depth investigative purposes if desired.

'''Minchiate''' is an early 16th-century [[card game]], originating in [[Florence]], [[Italy]]. It is no longer widely played. ''Minchiate'' can also refer to the special deck of 97 [[playing cards]] used in the game. The deck is closely related to the [[tarot]] cards, but contains an expanded suit of [[trump (card games)|trump]]s.  The game was similar to but more complex than [[tarocchi]]. The minchiate represents a Florentine variant on the original game.

==History==
Florence is one of the contenders for the birthplace of tarot. The earliest reference to tarot cards, then known as [[Trionfi (cards)|trionfi]], is dated to 1440 when a notary in Florence recorded the transfer of two decks to [[Sigismondo Pandolfo Malatesta]].&lt;ref&gt;Pratesi, Franco. [http://trionfi.com/giusto-giusti Studies on Giusto Giusti] at trionfi.com. Retrieved 3 March 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''minchiate'' comes from a dialect word meaning "[[nonsense]]" or "trifle", derived from ''mencla,'' the vulgar form of ''mentula'', a Latin word for "phallus"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Mario Alinei|title=L'etimologia di it. ''minchione'', it. ''mer.'' ''minchia'' e lat. ''mentula''|journal=Quaderni di semantica|publisher=Il Mulino|date=2015|number=1|pp=407-415|issn=0393 1226|language=it}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  The word ''minchione'' is attested in [[Italian language|Italian]] as meaning "fool", and ''minchionare'' means "to laugh at" someone.  The intended meaning may be "the game of the fool", considering that the card "[[The Fool (Tarot card)|The Fool]]", also called "The Excuse", features prominently in the game play of all tarot games. In [[tarocchini]], ''sminchiate'' is a signal used to communicate to a teammate.
[[File:La Papessa.jpg|thumb|left|Popess from the Rosenwald sheet.]]
The earliest reference to minchiate is found in a 1466 letter by [[Luigi Pulci]] to [[Lorenzo de' Medici]]. However, this game was believed to be played by a 78-card deck as evidenced by the Rosenwald sheets, uncut sheets of Florentine tarots dated from 1480 to 1500.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nga.gov/global-site-search-page.html?searchterm=tarocchi+woodcut Rosenwald sheets] at the [[National Gallery of Art]]. Retrieved 13 October 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; There are two other differences from 97-card minchiate. First, in 97-card minchiate the sequence for some of the lower trumps goes from lowest to highest: [[Strength (Tarot card)|Fortitude]], [[Justice (Tarot card)|Justice]], [[Wheel of Fortune (Tarot card)|Wheel]], and [[Chariot (Tarot card)|Chariot]]. In the Rosenwald ordering it is Justice, Fortitude, Chariot, and Wheel. Second, the Rosenwald sheets contains the [[Popess]] as the second trump which is not found in the 97-card deck. In a Florentine song written around 1500, the trumps in a tarot deck were listed as almost exactly as the Rosenwald sheets with the exception of the missing Popess which likely means that this card was dropped from the deck by that time.&lt;ref name="Depaulis"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Depaulis|first1=Thierry|title=Early Italian Lists of Tarot Trumps|journal=[[The Playing-Card]]|date=2007|volume=36|issue=1|pages=39–47}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song also ranks the other trumps as Fortitude, Justice, Chariot, and Wheel, which suggests it is a transitional stage from the Rosenwald sheets to the 97-card deck's order.

97-card minchiate was first known as ''germini'', after the Gemini (XXXV) card, the highest of the newly introduced trumps. The earliest record of germini dates to 1506.&lt;ref name="Pratesi"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pratesi|first1=Franco|title=1499-1506: Firenze|journal=[[The Playing-Card]]|date=2015|volume=44|issue=1|pages=61–71}}&lt;/ref&gt; This deck was created by inserting the 20 new trumps as a single block between trump 15 and [[The Star (Tarot card)|The Star]], which is now trump 36. The new deck proved so much more popular that the 77-card deck ceased production and the older name of minchiate was transferred over to the larger deck during the 17th century. The game spread from Florence to the rest of Italy and France during that century. In [[Sicily]], it was called ''gallerini'' while in [[Liguria]] it was known as ''ganellini'' but the rules used in these regions are lost save for cryptic references that they were quite different from the Florentine game. All surviving rules are derived from the type played in the [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany]] and the [[Papal States]].

By the 18th century, minchiate had overtaken the original game of tarot in popularity in Italy.  Paolo Minucci published a commentary on the game in 1676, and the game is described in detail by Romain Merlin in ''Origine des cartes à jouer'', published in [[Paris]] in 1869. It was also known in Germany during the late 18th century. The game was still played in [[Genoa]] in the 1930s, but its popularity declined in the late 19th and early 20th century.

==Deck==
[[File:Vitoria - Bibat 019a.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Lucca]] version cards]]
The minchiate deck differs from other tarot decks in several features. The first and most obvious difference is that the trumps have almost doubled in number; there are 40 trumps in the minchiate, in addition to the unnumbered card the Madman, [[The Fool (tarot card)|The Fool]] or the excuse. Minchiate uses [[Roman numerals#Alternative forms|additive Roman numerals]] for its trumps. Due to the large number of trumps, players generally called them by their number with the exception of the ''arie''.

Minchiate decks come in two standard patterns, earlier and later, which coexisted for almost two centuries. Earlier Minchiate dates from the early 16th century or even the late 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://i-p-c-s.org/pattern/ps-28.html Earlier Minchiate pattern] at the [[International Playing-Card Society]].

Retrieved 2 March 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; There are the four standard Latin [[Suit (cards)|suits]] of swords, batons, coins, and cups; these contain [[pip cards]] from [[ace]] to ten, and four [[face card]]s: a jack, a knight, a queen, and a king. In the minchiate deck, however, in the suits of cups and coins, the "knaves" or "pages" ([[Italian language|Italian]] ''fanti'') have been replaced by "maids" (''fantine'').  The knights, mounted figures in the [[tarot of Marseilles]] and similar designs, are [[centaur]]s or [[sphinx]]es in many minchiate decks. The suits follow the [[Spanish playing cards#Extinct Portuguese pattern|Portuguese pattern]] with the exception of the batons which follows the [[Italian playing cards|northern Italian suit-system]]. This pattern died out around 1900.

The [[Republic of Lucca]] produced their own version of Minchiate decks which were very similar to the ones used in nearby Florence but with several graphical differences.&lt;ref name="Mann" /&gt; Kings are seated under arches, knights are humans riding horses, all knaves are male, and the Fool is playing with a dog. This pattern died out in the eighteenth century.

The Later Minchiate pattern appeared around the early 18th century as a luxury edition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://i-p-c-s.org/pattern/ps-29.html Later Minchiate pattern] at the [[International Playing-Card Society]].

By comparing the Rosenwald sheet with 16th century trump lists, the Popess (II) was likely dropped in the late 15th century which shifted every trump above the first down one rank.&lt;ref name="Depaulis" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Renzoni"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Renzoni|first1=Nazario|title=Some remarks on Germini in Bronzino's ''Capitolo in lode della Zanzara''|journal=[[The Playing-Card]]|date=2012|volume=41|issue=2|pages=85–87}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Empress, Emperor, and Pope became the new II, III, and IIII respectively, the latter now wearing a secular crown as opposed to a [[papal tiara]]. Since the five lowest trumps were collectively known as the ''papi'' (popes), Love was added to this group after its demotion. The identification of middle ''papi'' was largely forgotten for centuries as players generally called cards by their number (pope 2, pope 3, etc.) French writer Romain Merlin (1869) is the only source that called trumps II, III, and IIII the Grand Duke, Western Emperor, and Eastern Emperor.

[[Justice (virtue)|Justice]], Fortitude, and [[Temperance (virtue)|Temperance]] were three classical "[[cardinal virtues]]" depicted in the more familiar tarot trumps. The minchiate supplies the remaining cardinal virtue&amp;nbsp;— [[Prudence]]&amp;nbsp;— and inserts them with the three [[theological virtues]], [[Faith]], [[Hope]] and [[Charity (virtue)|Charity]].  The only other deck to have the theological virtues was the [[Visconti-Sforza tarot deck|Cary-Yale deck]]. This is the only deck to include all [[seven virtues]].

Minchiate is a southern tarot pattern so it shares many qualities with the [[Tarocco Bolognese|Bolognese]] and [[Tarocco Siciliano|Sicilian tarots]] as opposed to the western patterns like the tarot of Marseilles. While the [[The Tower (Tarot card)|Tower]] is called The House of God in the Marseilles tarot, it is called the House of the Devil or Hellmouth in the minchiate deck  and it depicts a nude woman fleeing a burning building. The Moon depicts an [[astrology|astrologer]] studying the moon instead of the tarot of Marseilles howling dogs and lobster. The card corresponding to the Hermit is often called Time, or the Hunchback; it depicts an elderly man on crutches with an hourglass in the background. Like other southern decks, the final card in the series is not the World, but Judgement. The minchiate completes the series by adding all the [[zodiac]] signs (in random order) and the four [[classical element]]s.

The eight highest ranking trumps have a red background while the top five (the ''arie'') are unnumbered. A 98th card was made for some decks.&lt;ref name="History" /&gt; It is a trump with a red background and is also unnumbered like the ''arie''. It depicts a nude woman running in a wheel, probably representing [[Fortuna]]. While 98-card decks were mentioned as being played in Sicily during the early 18th century, only a few examples from Genoa survive. It is uncertain how this card ranked and how it affected the versicole sequences in the game. Also unknown is how it relates to the 98-card version of the Minchiate Francesi described below.

=== Educational Minchiate ===
Educational decks were produced in Florence during the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mann|first1=Sylvia|title=All Cards on the Table|date=1990|publisher=Deutsches Spielkarten-Museum|location=Leinfelden|page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Depaulis|first1=Thierry|title=Tarot, jeu et magie|date=1984|publisher=[[Bibliothèque nationale de France]]|location=Paris|pages=85–86}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of the usual figures and pips, each card would have text explaining a certain topic. One history deck has each suit teaching the history of Assyria, Persia, Greece, or Rome with the trumps teaching myths and legends. Geography decks contained maps of the known world.

=== Minchiate Francesi ===
[[File:Momus Tarot.jpg|thumb|Momus as the Fool in the 97-card deck]]
The '''Minchiate Francesi''', also called '''Minchiate de Poilly''' after its attribution to engraver [[François de Poilly]] (1623–93) and his son (1666-1741) who had the same name, refer to 3 different French decks utilizing the same set of engravings. The first has 42 numbered trumps, the second has 40 numbered trumps and [[Momus]] as an unnumbered card and lacks the first's "Le Chaos" card, the third has 21 numbered trumps and Momus as an unnumbered card. The intended game for the first deck is unknown, but the second appears to be intended to be played like the Italian Minchiate while the third deck appears to be intended for ordinary Tarot (despite still being called a Minchiate deck). The order of the motifs for the two latter decks have been rearranged compared to the first deck to more closely resemble their Italian counterparts. All three decks have the same 56 plain suit cards with [[French playing cards|French suits]] with each suit representing a different continent; spades for Africa, hearts for Europe, clubs for the Americas, and diamonds for Asia. The engravings share motifs with both the Italian Minchiate and the [[Tarot Nouveau]] as well as taking unique motifs from [[Roman Mythology]].&lt;ref&gt;''Origine des cartes à jouer'', Romain Merlin, Paris, 1869. Page 130-131.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Tarot, jeu et magie'', Thierry Depaulis, 1984. Page 86.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Austrian Minchiate ===
Mysterious French suited decks produced by [[Piatnik &amp; Söhne|Piatnik]] of Vienna around 1930 also featured forty trumps.&lt;ref&gt;Fara, Rudolf and Salles, Maurice (2006) An interview with Michael Dummett: from analytical philosophy to voting analysis and beyond. Social Choice and Welfare, 27 (2). pp. 347-364. ISSN 1432-217X&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://i-p-c-s.org/problist.html Unsolved Problems in Playing-Card Research] at the [[International Playing-Card Society]] website&lt;/ref&gt; It resembles the [[Industrie und Glück]] decks used for Central European tarock. Like the 54-card [[Industrie und Glück]] pattern, the plain suits consists of only 32 cards while the 40 trumps feature rustic [[genre scenes]]. With the ''Sküs'' (the Fool), the total number of cards is 73. Compounding the mystery is that the packaging is in French. Industrie und Glück type decks are not known to have a community of players in any French speaking country while the game of Minchiate is thought to have been restricted to only a few players in Genoa by the 1930s.

==Game==
Minchiate can be played by two to four players with the most common version played by four players divided into two partnerships.&lt;ref name="History" /&gt; The game, like other tarot games, is a [[trick taking game]] in which points are scored by capturing certain cards and sets of cards. As in most tarot games, the pip cards in cups and coins are in reverse order and play is counter-clockwise. The lowest five trumps were called ''papi'' ("popes") while the highest five trumps (Star, Moon, Sun, World, Trumpets) were called ''arie'' ("airs") and have a special high scoring value in the game. Minchiate is similar in many ways to [[tarocchini]] played in [[Bologna]]. In these games, combinations ([[Meld (cards)|melds]]) of cards are more important than the value of individual cards.

The last trick is worth 10 points. Trump 29 is a unique card, by itself it is worth nothing but when used in combinations (''versicole''), it is worth 5 points. ''Versicole'' are formed through a sequence of three or more of consecutive point cards.  In addition, there are four irregular ''versicole'':

*'''''Versicola del Matto''''': Trumps 1, 40, and the Fool
*'''''Versicola del Tredici''''': Trumps 1, 13, and 28
*'''''Versicola delle diecine''''': Trumps 10, 20, and 30; or 20, 30, and 40; or 10, 20, 30, and 40
*'''''Versicola dei Regi''''': Three or four kings
{{clear}}
All ''versicole'' have to be declared at the beginning of the game. At the end of the round, each team will assemble ''versicole'' from their captured tricks. Trumps 1, 3, 13, 20, 28, 30-33, and 38 are considered valuable cards because they are required to form some ''versicole'' or to deny the opposition the same. The Fool can be added to every ''versicola''.

The minchiate deck was also used to play two games that don't use normal tarot rules, ''Al Palio'' and ''A sei tocchi''.

===2-player rules===
This is the simplest version of the game; it was not considered serious but only as an introduction to the more complex four player versions. [[Jeton]]s are used to keep track of scoring. The dealer gives 25 cards to his opponent and himself. His opponent leads the first trick but instead of letting the dealer play, she declares any meld she has and scores. The dealer then declares his melds and scores. Each takes back their own cards and the dealer finishes the first trick. Players must [[follow suit]]. If they are unable to do so, they must play a trump. If unable to play a trump, then any card can be discarded. The winner of each trick immediately scores from the captured cards and leads to the next trick.

The Fool excuses the player from following suit, it can neither capture nor be captured. The player gives a worthless card from his trick pile in exchange to his opponent.

At the end of the round, each player adds to their running total the captured cards, melds from the captured cards, and the last trick bonus. The player who has captured more than 25 cards gets a bonus point for each extra card. The two players then compare their sums with the loser having to pay the winner the difference.

==In cartomancy==
Although no divination system using this pack of cards ever existed in previous centuries, and because of this allegorical and cosmological content, in recent years tarot occultists have proposed systems of [[divination]] and [[cartomancy]] that use the minchiate deck. In [[Charles Godfrey Leland]]'s book 1890 book ''[[Aradia, or the Gospel of the Witches]]'', an [[incantation]] is given that mentions the use of "40 cards", which are renamed in the spell as 40 [[deity|gods]] who are being invoked to compel the goddess [[Laverna]] to do the caster's bidding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/pag/aradia/ara17.htm |title=Aradia, ch. 17 |publisher=Sacred-texts.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Paul Huson]] has speculated that these 40 cards are the 40 trumps of the minchiate deck.&lt;ref&gt;Huson, Paul, ''The Devil's Picturebook'', p.67, New York: G.P. Putnams Sons, 1971&lt;/ref&gt;  He has also pointed out that Leland's book ''Etruscan-Roman Remains in Popular Tradition'' (1892) contains a spell that is cast with ''tarocco'' cards,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Huson |first=Paul |title=The Devil's Picturebook |page=189}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/pag/err/err10.htm |title=Etruscan-Roman Remains, ch. 10}}&lt;/ref&gt; to invoke [[Janus (mythology)|Janus]].

=== Earlier Minchiate ===
Spanish publisher ''Ediciones del Prado'' reproduced a deck from 1790 in 2004. Artist Constante Constantini (died 2006), through Italian publisher Solleone, has published "Minchiate Fiorentine", a modern redrawing of a woodcut design in 1980.

=== Later Minchiate I ===
The Italian publisher ''Lo Scarabeo'' offers a reproduction of the "Antiche Minchiate Etruria", an engraved minchiate deck that originally appeared in 1725 but has added Roman numerals to the ''arie''. The Italian publisher ''Il Meneghello'' also made a reproduction of the same deck as "Minchiate Fiorentine Etruria". It leaves the ''arie'' unnumbered and reproduces the tax stamp on trump 30.

=== Later Minchiate II ===
''Il Meneghello'' also made a reproduction, in regular and mini sizes, of the "Minchiate Fiorentine", a woodcut minchiate deck that originally appeared circa 1820.

=== Minchiate Francesi ===
Solleone reproduced this deck in 1986.

==Modern decks==
{{More citations needed|section|date=November 2018}}
The late tarot artist Brian Williams (died 2002) &lt;!--not the game illustrator--&gt; published a modern edition of the minchiate deck, which accompanies his book referenced below.

Constantini also produced "Nuove Minchiate Fiorentine" with Solleone in 1981. Unlike the earlier deck, this one is based on his own personal style.

The '''NWA New Zealand Heavyweight Championship''' is the primary singles title in the [[List of NWA territories|NWA-affiliated]] wrestling promotion [[NWA New Zealand]]. It is the first heavyweight championship in New Zealand and one of the oldest in the world. It was first won by [[Gisborne Katene]], who defeated [[Frank Findlay]] in 1919. The title has generally been defended in New Zealand, most often in [[Christchurch]], [[Tauranga, New Zealand|Tauranga]], [[Wellington]] and [[Auckland, New Zealand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Puroresu Dojo |title=New Zealand Heavyweight Title |url=http://www.wrestling-titles.com/nz/nz-h.html |work=Pro-Wrestling Title Histories: New Zealand |publisher=Wrestling-Titles.com |year=2003 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=GB Team |title=New Zealand Heavyweight Title (inactive) |url=http://www.WrestlingData.com/index.php?befehl=titles&amp;titel=384 |work= |publisher=WrestlingData.com |pages= |language=de |year=2001 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8709">The '''Noor Iranian Film Festival''' is an annual [[film festival]] held in [[Los Angeles|Los Angeles, California]], founded by cultural producer [[Siamak Ghahremani]] and co-founder [[Anthony Azizi]] in 2007. The festival's namesake comes from the word [[Nur (name)|Nur]], also spelled Noor, meaning to shed light or "noor," on Iranian culture and heritage through [[Cinema of Iran|Iranian cinema]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Noor Film Festival|title=NIFF Mission|url=http://noorfilmfestival.com|publisher=Noor Film Festival|accessdate=9 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional to the main annual festival in Los Angeles, a tour of the program has made several return trips to cities such as [[Daytona Beach]], [[San Diego]], [[San Francisco]], [[Seattle]], and [[Washington D.C.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=de Yampert|first=Rick|title=Noor film festival sheds light on Iran|url=http://www.news-journalonline.com/article/20140211/living/140219971|publisher=News-JournalOnline.com|accessdate=11 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PAAIA Takes the Noor Iranian Film Festival on Tour|url=http://www.paaia.org/CMS/paaia-takes-the-noor-iranian-film-festival-on-tour.aspx|publisher=PAAIA|accessdate=11 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Los Angeles]] festival has been held at such venues as the [[James Bridges|James Bridges Theater]] on the [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA Campus]], [[Laemmle Theatres|Laemmle's Music Hall 3]] in [[Beverly Hills]] and Magnin Auditorium at the [[Skirball Cultural Center]]. It has taken place every year since 2007, with the exception of 2010, where due to [[2009–10 Iranian election protests|Iran's political uprising in 2010]], and out of respect for the people in Iran, the festival decided to postpone its 4th festival to 2011. The postponement was also due to a lack of sponsorship and seed money for the festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=4th Annual Noor Film Festival Announces Award Winners: "Circumstance" Sweeps Three Categories|url=http://www.prlog.org/11617255-4th-annual-noor-film-festival-announces-award-winners-circumstance-sweeps-three-categories.html|publisher=The Burgett Group|accessdate=11 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''novelty song''' is a comical or nonsensical [[song]], performed principally for its [[Comedy|comical effect]]. Humorous songs, or those containing humorous elements, are not necessarily novelty songs. The term arose in [[Tin Pan Alley]] to describe one of the major divisions of [[popular music]]. The other two divisions were [[Ballad (music)|ballads]] and [[dance music]].&lt;ref&gt;Hamm, ''Irving Berlin Early Songs'', p. xxxiv: "The text of a novelty song sketches a vignette or a brief story of an amusing or provocative nature. ... noted for portraying characters of specific ethnicity or those finding themselves in certain comic or melodramatic situations, ..."&lt;/ref&gt; Novelty songs achieved great popularity during the 1920s and 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Axford, ''Song Sheets to Software'', p. 20: "As sentimental songs were the mainstay of Tin Pan Alley, novelty and comical songs helped to break the monotony, developing in the twenties and thirties as signs of the times."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tawa, ''Supremely American'', p. 55: "... in the 1920s, novelty songs offset the intensely serious and lachrymose ballads. nonsensical novelty songs, reproducing the irrational and meaningless side of the twenties, made frequent appearances."&lt;/ref&gt; They had a resurgence of interest in the 1950s and 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.waybackattack.com/top100-noveltyhits.html|title=Way Back Attack - Top 100 Novelty Hits of the '50s and '60s|website=Waybackattack.com|accessdate=December 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Novelty songs are often a [[Parody song|parody]] or humor song, and may apply to a current event such as a holiday or a fad such as a [[novelty and fad dances|dance]] or TV programme. Many use unusual lyrics, subjects, sounds, or instrumentation, and may not even be musical.  For example, the 1966 novelty song "[[They're Coming to Take Me Away, Ha-Haaa!]]" has little music and is set to a rhythm tapped out on a [[snare drum]] and [[tambourine]].

A book on achieving an attention-grabbing novelty single is ''[[The Manual|The Manual (How to Have a Number One the Easy Way)]]'', written by [[The KLF]]. It is based on their achievement of a UK number-one single with "[[Doctorin' the Tardis]]", a 1988 dance remix mashup of the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' [[Doctor Who theme music|theme music]] released under the name of 'The Timelords.' It argued that (at the time) achieving a number one single could be achieved less by musical talent than through [[market research]], [[sampling (music)|sampling]] and gimmicks matched to an underlying danceable groove.&lt;ref name="Words and Music: Our 60 Favorite Music Books"&gt;{{cite web|title=Words and Music: Our 60 Favorite Music Books|url=http://pitchfork.com/features/staff-lists/7967-words-and-music-our-60-favorite-music-books/2/|website=Pitchfork Music|accessdate=October 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Manual (how to have a number one the easy way)"&gt;{{cite book|last1=The KLF|title=The Manual (how to have a number one the easy way)|date=1988|publisher=KLF|location=[Great Britain]|isbn=0-86359-616-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Novelty songs were a major staple of [[Tin Pan Alley]] from its start in the late 19th century. They continued to proliferate in the early years of the 20th century, some rising to be among the biggest hits of the era. Varieties included songs with an unusual gimmick, such as the stuttering in "[[K-K-K-Katy]]" or the playful boop-boop-a-doops of "[[I Wanna Be Loved By You]]", which made a star out of [[Helen Kane]] and inspired the creation of [[Betty Boop]]; silly lyrics like "[[Yes! We Have No Bananas]]"; playful songs with a bit of double entendre, such as "Don't Put a Tax on All the Beautiful Girls"; and invocations of foreign lands with emphasis on general feel of exoticism rather than geographic or anthropological accuracy, such as "[[Oh By Jingo!]]", "[[The Sheik of Araby]]", and "The Yodeling Chinaman". These songs were perfect for the medium of [[Vaudeville]], and performers such as [[Eddie Cantor]] and [[Sophie Tucker]] became well-known for such songs. [[Zez Confrey]]'s 1920s instrumental compositions, which involved gimmicky approaches (such as "Kitten on the Keys") or maniacally rapid tempos ("Dizzy Fingers"), were popular enough to start a fad of [[novelty piano]] pieces that lasted through the decade.

A 1940s novelty song was [[Spike Jones|Spike Jones']] 1942 "[[Spike Jones#Der Fuehrer's Face|Der Fuehrer's Face]]", which included [[blowing a raspberry|raspberries]] in its chorus. [[Tex Williams]]'s "[[Smoke! Smoke! Smoke! (That Cigarette)]]" topped the ''Billboard'' best-sellers chart for six weeks and the [[Hot Country Songs|country music chart]] for 16 weeks in 1947 and 1948. The 1953 #1 single "[[(How Much Is) That Doggie in the Window?]]" became notable both for its extensive airplay and the backlash from listeners who found it increasingly annoying.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}  Satirists such as [[Stan Freberg]] and [[Tom Lehrer]] used novelty songs to poke fun at contemporary pop culture in the 1950s and early 1960s.

In 1951, Frank Sinatra was paired in a CBS television special with TV personality [[Dagmar (American actress)|Dagmar]]. Mitch Miller at Columbia Records became intrigued with the pairing and compelled songwriter [[Dick Manning]] to compose a song for the two of them. The result was "[[Mama Will Bark]]", a novelty song performed by Sinatra with interspersed spoken statements by Dagmar, saying things like "mama will bark", "mama will spank", and "papa will spank". The recording even includes the sound of a dog yowling. It is regarded by both music scholars and Sinatra enthusiasts to be perhaps the worst song he ever recorded. Sinatra would in fact record a few others before he left Columbia and joined Capitol Records in 1952.

[[Dickie Goodman]] faced a lawsuit for his 1956 novelty song "[[The Flying Saucer (song)|The Flying Saucer]]", which [[Sampling (music)|sampled]] snippets of contemporary hits without permission and arranged them to resemble interviews with an alien landing on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/new-case-for-old-napster-dickie-goodmans-son-reveals-fathers-legacy-in-book-and-fights-for-it-in-lawsuit-73270132.html |title=New Case for Old `Napster'; Dickie Goodman's Son Reveals Father's Legacy in Book and Fights for It in Lawsuit|publisher=[[PR Newswire]] |accessdate=November 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Goodman released more hit singles in the same vein for the next two decades. 

Among the more far out songs of this genre was the two released in 1956 by [[Nervous Norvus]], "Transfusion" and "Ape Call". 

The Coasters had novelty songs such as "Charlie Brown"&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dailydoowop.com/the-coasters-charlie-brown/&lt;/ref&gt; and "[[Yakety Yak]]". "Yakety Yak" became a [[Hot 100 number-one hits of 1958 (USA)#Hot 100|#1 single on July 21, 1958]], and is the only novelty song (#346) included in the [[Songs of the Century]].  "Lucky Ladybug" by [[Billy and Lillie]] was popular in December 1958. [[Lonnie Donegan]]'s 1959 cover of the 1924 novelty song "[[Does Your Chewing Gum Lose Its Flavour (On the Bedpost Overnight?)]]" was a transatlantic hit, reaching #5 on the ''Billboard'' charts two years after its release; it was one of the earliest top-5 hits to come from the United Kingdom in the rock era, preceding the [[British Invasion]].

Three songs using a sped-up recording technique became #1 hits in the United States in 1958-59: [[David Seville]]'s "[[Witch Doctor (song)|Witch Doctor]]" and Ragtime Cowboy Joe, [[Sheb Wooley]]'s "[[The Purple People Eater]]", and Seville's "[[The Chipmunk Song (Christmas Don't Be Late)]]", which used a speeded-up voice technique to simulate three chipmunks' voices.&lt;ref name=Hoffman&gt;The first [[Best Comedy Performance#1950s|Best Comedy Recording]] Grammy was awarded to [[David Seville]]'s 
{{cite web|last=Hoffman|first=Dr Frank|url=http://www.jeffosretromusic.com/novelty.html|title=Novelty Songs|work=Jeff O's Retro Music|accessdate=2008-02-23|publisher=Jeff O'Corbett}}&lt;/ref&gt; The technique (which Dickie Goodman had also used on "The Flying Saucer") would inspire a number of other knockoffs, including [[The Nutty Squirrels]] and [[Russ Regan]]'s one-off group Dancer, Prancer and Nervous.

In 1960, 16-year-old [[Brian Hyland]] had a novelty hit with the song "[[Itsy Bitsy Teenie Weenie Yellow Polka Dot Bikini]]", by [[Paul Vance]] and [[Lee Pockriss]], which topped the ''Billboard'' single chart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=6099|title=Itsy Bitsy Teeny Weeny Yellow Polka Dot Bikini by Brian Hyland Songfacts|website=Songfacts.com|accessdate=December 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Trashmen reached the top 5 with "[[Surfin' Bird]]", a [[surf rock]] medley of two novelty songs originally recorded by [[The Rivingtons]]. In 1964, the [[Grammy Award for Best Country Album#1960s|Grammy for Best Country and Western Album]] was awarded to [[Roger Miller]]. Miller was known to sing novelty songs.

In 1965, "[[A Windmill in Old Amsterdam]]", a song written by [[Ted Dicks]] and [[Myles Rudge]], became a UK hit for [[Ronnie Hilton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Ronnie-Hilton-A-Windmill-In-Old-Amsterdam-Dear-Heart/release/1733514|title=Ronnie Hilton - A Windmill In Old Amsterdam / Dear Heart|website=Discogs.com|accessdate=20 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song spent a total of 13 weeks on the [[UK Singles Chart]] peaking at No. 23 in the chart of 17 February 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.officialcharts.com/search/singles/a%20windmill%20in%20old%20amsterdam/ |title=A Windmill In Old Amsterdam |website=Officialcharts.com |accessdate=20 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song's composers were granted an [[Ivor Novello Awards|Ivor Novello Award]] in 1966 for [[List of Ivor Novello Award winners|the Year’s Outstanding Novelty Composition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theivors.com/archive/1960-1969/the-ivors-1966/|title=The Ivors 1966|website=Theivors.com|accessdate=20 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History: 1970s–present ==
[[Chuck Berry]]'s "[[My Ding-a-Ling]]" reached #1 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] in 1972,&lt;ref name="AM"&gt;{{cite web |url={{Allmusic |class=artist|id=p3664|tab=charts-awards/billboard-singles|pure_url=yes}} |title=Chuck Berry: Charts &amp; Awards – ''Billboard'' Singles |work=[[AllMusic]] |publisher=[[Rovi Corporation]] |location=[[United States]] |accessdate=March 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ray Stevens]], known for such novelty hits as "[[Ahab the Arab]]", "[[Gitarzan]]", and "Mississippi Squirrel Revival", had a #1 hit with "[[The Streak]]" in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100/1974-05-18|title=Music: Top 100 Songs - Billboard Hot 100 Chart|publisher=Billboard|accessdate=December 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Comedy act [[Cheech &amp; Chong]] recorded a number of musical bits that can be classified as novelty songs, including "[[Basketball Jones]]"(1973) and "[[Earache My Eye]]" (1974). Other novelty songs in the '70s are Jimmy Castor Bunch "King Kong"(1975), [[Rick Dees]]' "[[Disco Duck]]" (1976) and [[The Fools]]' "Psycho Chicken"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dangerousminds.net/comments/psycho_chicken|title=‘Psycho Chicken’: Plucked-up Talking Heads parody, 1979|date=February 3, 2015|website=Dangerousminds.net|accessdate=December 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1978). [["Weird Al" Yankovic]] would emerge as one of the most prolific parody acts of all time in the 1980s, with a career that would span four decades; he would join [[Cliff Richard]] in being one of the few acts to have at least one top-40 hit in the U.S. in four consecutive decades (1950s through the 1980s for Richard, 1980s to 2010s for Yankovic).

Randy Brooks wrote a Christmas novelty song and it was originally recorded by then husband-wife recording duo [[Elmo Shropshire]] and his wife Patsy in 1979, called "[[Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer]]". It tells the tragic-comic story of a family grandmother who meets her end on Christmas Eve. After having drunk too much eggnog and forgetting to take her medicine, she staggers out of her family's house late Christmas Eve. She is mauled over by Santa Claus' entourage, and found dead at the scene the next morning. "Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer" is perhaps the only hit Christmas novelty song which has had continuous popularity since circa 1980.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

An underground novelty music scene began to emerge in the 1960s, beginning with the homosexually themed songs of [[Camp Records]] and the racist humor of [[Johnny Rebel (singer)|Johnny Rebel]], then in the 1970s and 1980s with X-rated albums by [[David Allan Coe]] and [[Blowfly (artist)|Clarence "Blowfly" Reid]].

Novelty songs have been popular in the UK as well. In 1991, "[[The Stonk]]" novelty song raised over £100,000 for the [[Comic Relief (charity)|Comic Relief]] charity. In 1993, "[[Mr Blobby (song)|Mr Blobby]]" became the second novelty song to reach the coveted [[List of Christmas number one singles (UK)|Christmas number one]] slot in the UK, following [[Benny Hill]]'s 1971 chart-topper "[[Ernie (The Fastest Milkman in the West)]]".&lt;ref&gt;Bromley, Tom ''We Could Have Been the Wombles: The Weird and Wonderful World of One-Hit Wonders'' p.51. Penguin books ltd, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Many popular children's TV characters would try to claim the Christmas number one spot after this. In 1997, the [[Teletubbies]] who reached number one the previous week failed to gain it with their single "[[Teletubbies say Eh-oh!|Say Eh-oh!]]".{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}  They came second in the charts to [[The Spice Girls]] second of three consecutive Christmas number ones, with "[[Too Much (Spice Girls song)|Too Much]]".{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}  Later on at the turn of the [[millennium]], [[Bob the Builder]] was successful in achieving a Christmas number one in 2000, with "[[Can We Fix It?]]". However, Bob the Builder did have another number one single a year later with a cover of [[Lou Bega]]'s "[[Mambo No.5]]", and also had another less successful single in 2008 with "[[Big Fish Little Fish (song)|Big Fish Little Fish]]".

Some novelty music draws its appeal from its unintentional novelty; so-called "[[outsider music]]ians" with little or no formal musical training often will produce comical results (see for instance, [[Florence Foster Jenkins]], [[Mrs. Elva Miller|Mrs. Miller]], the [[Portsmouth Sinfonia]], [[The Shaggs]] and [[William Hung]]).

After the fictitious composer [[P.D.Q. Bach]] repeatedly won the "Best Comedy Album" Grammy from 1990 to 1993, the category was changed to "Best ''Spoken'' Comedy Album". When "Best Comedy Album" was reinstated in 2004, [["Weird Al" Yankovic]] won for ''[[Poodle Hat]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Why Weird Al is still the king of spoof |first= Tim |last= Donnelly |date= July 12, 2014 |work= New York Post |url= https://nypost.com/2014/07/12/why-weird-al-is-still-the-king-of-spoof/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Novelty songs were popular on U.S. radio throughout the 1970s and 1980s, to the point where it was not uncommon for novelty songs to break into the [[top 40]]. [[Freeform (radio format)|Freeform]] and [[album-oriented rock]] stations made use of novelty songs; some of the best-known work from [[Frank Zappa]], for instance, is his extensive body of mostly adult-oriented novelty music. Zappa had "Dancing Fool", "Disco Boy". Beginning in 1970, [[Dr. Demento]]'s nationally syndicated radio show gave novelty songs an outlet for much of the country; this lasted through the mid-2000s, when the show (mirroring trends in the genre) faded in popularity until its terrestrial cancellation in June 2010. 

In the 21st century, novelty songs had found a new audience online; the hit song "[[The Fox (What Does the Fox Say?)]]" by Norwegian comedy duo [[Ylvis]] was featured on the kids compilation album ''So Fresh Pop Party 13'' in 2014. 
Likewise, British comedian [[Michael Dapaah]]'s 2017 hit "[[Man's Not Hot]]", which depicts a man who refuses to take off his jacket, received widespread attention and inspired countless [[memes]] as a result of its success.

{{Refimprove|date=December 2009}}
A '''preceptor''' (Turkic-Persian Ataaleeq) is a teacher responsible to uphold a certain law or tradition, a ''[[precept]]''.

==Christian military orders==
A preceptor was historically in charge of a preceptory, the headquarters of certain orders of monastic knights, such as the [[Knights Hospitaller]] and [[Knights Templar]], within a given geographical area.&lt;ref&gt;Zsolt Hunyadi, József Laszlovszky, ''The Crusades and the Military Orders: Expanding the Frontiers of Medieval Latin Christianity'' (Budapest, 2001), pp. 235, 270&lt;/ref&gt; The preceptor had supreme control of his brethren and was only answerable to the [[Grand Master (order)|grand master]] of his particular order. A preceptory's main focus would be its church and accommodation for the brethren.

Examples include the Hospitaller [[Torphichen Preceptory]] in [[West Lothian]], [[Scotland]]; [[West Peckham Preceptory]] in [[West Peckham]], [[England]] and the Templar [[Aslackby Preceptory]] in [[Lincolnshire]], [[Keele Preceptory]] in [[Staffordshire]] and [[Temple, Midlothian]].

==Freemasonry==
Within modern-day [[Freemasonry]] the preceptor is the head of a lodge of instruction.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Edward Waite, ''A New Encyclopedia of Freemasonry'', Volume 1 (New York: Cosimo, 2007), p. xxi&lt;/ref&gt;  Such lodges operate within a geographical area and provide training in the performance of the order's ritual for members of the order.  The preceptor is an elected position and is usually a Freemason who has spent several years as a director of ceremonies in his local lodge and is considered an expert in the ritual of the order.

In English Freemasonry, the Preceptor of the lodge is usually appointed by the Master. His main responsibility is to prompt those masons who have forgotten their words. Some lodges, and some preceptors, take his theoretical status as a teacher more seriously than others.

==Music==
Musically, the title preceptor usually refers to a monk responsible for making music in a [[monastery]]. He trained the monks in the traditions of plainchant for daily services and prayers.

==Education==
Some North American universities have a special student position called preceptor. Preceptors are student volunteers who assist the staff professor and teaching assistants of a large lecture class by helping design certain lessons and holding his or her own office hours and review sessions. In some cases, volunteers are required to take an outside class focused on leadership development, where the final grade is determined by both the lecture professor and leadership development teacher. Thus, the preceptor earns credit for his or her preceptorship. It is considered a good leadership experience and reflects well on the student in his or her transcript. Preceptor can also refer to a paid student grader.{{cn|date=February 2016}}

At some universities, including [[Harvard University|Harvard]], [[Cambridge University|Cambridge]] and [[Oxford University|Oxford]], "preceptors" are not students at all but faculty members teaching courses in [[writing]], [[music]], [[mathematics]], [[languages]], and the [[life sciences]]. In some departments they are not tenured faculty but rather non-ladder faculty (generally PhDs) who help administer and run the course, especially with the larger ones. Harvard preceptors, who teach introductory writing, have included ''[[The New Yorker|New Yorker]]'' staff writer [[George Packer]], novelist [[Tom Perrotta]], former ''[[The Boston Globe|Globe]]'' music critic [[Richard Dyer]] and poet [[Dan Chiasson]].{{cn|date=February 2016}} At [[Columbia University]], on the other hand, "preceptors" are senior graduate students who, along with senior faculty, teach courses on "Literature Humanities" and "Contemporary Civilization". The title is also used to refer to [[teaching assistant]]s at [[Princeton University|Princeton]], who are typically [[graduate student]]s.

At [[Elon University School of Law]], a preceptor is an attorney who mentors two or three first-year law students.

==Health==
In [[medical education|medicine]], [[allied health]], midwifery, paramedicine, pharmacy and [[nursing]] education, a preceptor is a skilled practitioner or faculty member who supervises students in a clinical setting to allow practical experience with patients.&lt;ref&gt;Florence Myrick, Olive Yonge, ''Nursing Preceptorship: Connecting Practice and Education'' (Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins, 2005), p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mercer |first1=C |title=Family medicine faces shortage of doctors willing to teach. |journal=CMAJ : Canadian Medical Association journal &lt;nowiki&gt;=&lt;/nowiki&gt; journal de l'Association medicale canadienne |date=28 May 2018 |volume=190 |issue=21 |pages=E666 |doi=10.1503/cmaj.109-5604 |pmid=29807944 |pmc=5973894}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ropecon''' ({{IPA-fi|ropekon}}) is a [[Role-playing game|role-playing]] convention held annually in [[Finland]]. The convention is one of the largest non-commercial annual events of its kind, having reached a record of 3946 attendees in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{fi icon}} [https://www.ropecon.fi/pmwiki/index.php/Blogi/Historia Ropecon official website - History]&lt;/ref&gt; The current venue is the [[Messukeskus Helsinki]] convention centre in [[Helsinki]], the capital city of [[Finland]].

Ropecon hosts a wide variety of different types of games, including [[role-playing game]]s, [[live action role-playing game]]s, [[collectible card game]]s, [[Miniature wargaming|miniature wargames]] and [[strategy game]]s. The event also has a range of lectures, panel discussions and other presentations covering different aspects of gaming. Past guests of honor have included several prominent game designers, such as [[Steve Jackson (US)|Steve Jackson]].

Ropecon is organised by the Ropecon Society, a joint venture of several Finnish role-playing associations. The practical arrangements are made by the unpaid members of an organising committee and hundreds of voluntary workers at the convention. Any profits are used to support various other role-playing activities.

The name "Ropecon" comes from the [[Finnish language]] word "[[:wikt:roolipeli|'''ro'''oli'''pe'''li]]", meaning role-playing game, but is also a nod to the [[English language]] word "[[rope]]", a vital piece of equipment in classic [[dungeon crawl]] role-playing games.

The Finnish culture ministry supported Ropecon in 2013 with funding.&lt;ref&gt;http://yle.fi/uutiset/opera_nabs_biggest_share_of_festival_funding/6585099&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rumillajta''' ([[Quechua language|Quechua]]: ''rumi'' stone, ''llaqta'' place (village, town, city, country, nation),&lt;ref&gt;Teofilo Laime Ajacopa, Diccionario Bilingüe Iskay simipi yuyayk'ancha, La Paz, 2007 (Quechua-Spanish dictionary)&lt;/ref&gt; pronounced {{sic|hide=y|ɾʊmɪ'ʎaqta}}) is a [[Bolivia|Bolivian]] musical quintet that formed in 1980 and became one of the most important progenitors of [[Andean music]]. They were the subjects of a short documentary from the [[BBC]] and played at festivals on three continents. Their music concerns folk themes and nature as well as more political themes like [[coca]], foreign exploitation and indigenous rights. Rumillajta apparently ceased to exist in 2001 after the release of their last CD, ''Pachakuti''.

Related customs are found in the Welsh and English [[Morris dance]], in Austria, Germany, Flanders, France, Italy, Spain, Portugal and Romania.

==History of the Scottish sword dance ==
As a part of the traditional Scottish intangible heritage, the performance of the Sword Dance has been recorded as early as the 15th century. It is normally recognised as the war dance with some ceremonial sense in the Scottish Royal court during that period. The old kings and clan chiefs organised the Highland Games as a method to choose their best men at arms, and the  discipline required to perform the Highland dances allowed men to demonstrate their strength, stamina, and agility. The earliest reference also mentioned that the dance is often accompanied with the music of bagpipes. The basic rule requires the dancer to cross two swords on the ground in an "X" shape and to dance around and within the 4 quarters of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historic-uk.com/HistoryUK/HistoryofScotland/Highland-Dancing/|title=Highland Dancing|accessdate=2016-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest reference to these dances in [[Scotland]] is mentioned in the ''Scotichronicon'', compiled in Scotland by [[Walter Bower]] in the 1440s. The passage regards [[Alexander III of Scotland|Alexander III]] and his second marriage to the French lady [[Yolande de Dreux (Scotland)|Yolande de Dreux]] at Jedburgh in [[Roxburghshire]] on 14 October 1285.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
At the head of this procession were the skilled [[musician]]s with many sorts of pipe music including the wailing music of [[bagpipes]], and behind them others splendidly performing a war-dance with intricate weaving in and out. Bringing up the rear was a figure regarding whom it was difficult to decide whether it was a man or an apparition. It seemed to glide like a [[ghost]] rather than walk on feet. When it looked as if he would disappear from everyone's sight, the whole frenzied procession halted, the song died away, the music faded, and the dancing contingent froze suddenly and unexpectedly.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1573, Scottish [[mercenaries]] are said to have performed a Scottish Sword dance before the [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[Monarch|King]], [[John III of Sweden|John III]], at a [[banquet]] held in Stockholm Castle. The dance, "a natural feature of the festivities," was used as part of a plot to assassinate the King, where the conspirators were able to bare their weapons without arousing suspicion. Fortunately for the King, at the decisive moment the agreed signal was never given.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scotclans.com/history-scottish-highland-dancing/|title=A History of Scottish Highland Dancing {{!}} ScotClans {{!}} Scottish Clans|website=www.scotclans.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"[[Sword]] dance and Hieland Dances" were included at a reception for [[Anne of Denmark]] at Edinburgh in 1589 and a mixture of sword dance and acrobatics were performed before [[James I of England|James VI]] in 1617 &lt;ref&gt;(New Statistical Account of Scotland Edinb. 1845 x, pp. 44-45)&lt;/ref&gt; and again for [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] in 1633, by the Incorporation of Skinners and Glovers of [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
His Majesty’s chair being set upon the wall next to the Water of Tay whereupon was a floating stage of timber clad about with birks, upon the which for His Majesty’s welcome and entry thirteen of our brethren of this calling of Glovers with green caps, silver strings, red ribbons, white shoes and bells upon their legs, shearing rapiers in their hands and all other abulzements, danced our sword dance with many difficult knots and allapallajesse, five being under and five above upon their shoulders, three of them dancing through their feet and about them, drinking wine and breaking glasses. Which (God be praised) was acted and done without hurt or skaith to any.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Types of sword dance ==
[[File:Sword dance c1900 Stone.jpg|thumb|upright|right|A performer of the Scottish sword dance, the "Gillie Callum", in [[Inverness]],  c. 1900]]
Many of the [[Scottish Highlands|Highland]] dances now lost were once performed with traditional weapons that included the [[Lochaber axe]], the [[broadsword]], a combination of [[targe]] and [[dirk]], and the [[flail (weapon)|flail]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

The old [[Isle of Skye|Skye]] dancing song, ''Bualidh mi u an sa chean'' (''Buailidh mi thu anns a' cheann'' "I will break your head"), may indicate some form of [[sparring|weapon play]] to music, 'breaking the head' was the winning blow in cudgelling matches throughout Britain, "for the moment that blood runs an inch anywhere above the eyebrow, the old gamester to whom it belongs is beaten, and has to stop."

C.N. McIntyre North describes a clockwise-moving Sword Dance in his 1880 "Book of the Club of True Highlanders".&lt;ref&gt;"Book of the Club of True Highlanders" http://www.electricscotland.com/history/club/index.htm&lt;/ref&gt; McIntyre North describes nine steps. The first step beats the rhythm in time with the tune "Gillie Calliun" [sic].

A combative sword dance{{Clarify|date=July 2011}} called the Highland Dirk Dance still exists and is often linked to the sword dance or dances called "Macinorsair" (''Mac an Fhòrsair''), the "Broad Sword Exercise" or the "Bruicheath" (Battle Dance). These dances are mentioned in a number of sources, and may have been performed in a variety of different forms, by two performers in a duelling form and as a solo routine.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

==Dance with Highland Regiments==
[[File:Scottish Sword Dance.jpg|right|thumb|alt=Scottish Sword Dance|The Malagasy Envoys at Cape Town—Entertainment at the Officers’ Mess of the 1st Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders]]

===Regimental Tradition===
This tradition was gradually kept in the Highlander Regiments with some changing rules. To prepare for the Sword Dance, a soldier should lay two swords on the ground in the form of an X, he would then proceed to dance a complex series of steps and movements between and around the swords to the sound of the bagpipes. The dance itself can be performed with more than one individual. This tradition of exhibition and competitive dancing carried on into the 21st century. It was performed at a Regimental Highland Games C1930s. Four swords are laid on the dance floor in a cross shape. The dancer then performs a number of intricate dance steps across and around the sword blades, keeping their backs straight, arms raised, and hands in a particular shape. Throughout the decades, this style of dance became an integral part of the performance of the pipes and drums band when it went on tour to various countries around the world. Highland country dancing (often a less formal style of dance) was also encouraged within the Regiment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Thin Red Line Regimental Magazine of the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders|year=1947|location=UK|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Scottish Sword Dance 2.jpg|right|thumb|alt=Scottish Sword Dance 2|The Sword Dance, 93rd were camped at Chobham in England, 1853]]
{{double image|right|Lochaber axe.jpg|150|Lochaber axe 2.jpg|150|Lochaber Axe,traditional Scottish battle weapon}}
Actually, the weapon in the traditional sword dance is not only the basket-hilted broadsword. In the book “Highland and Traditional Scottish Dances”, Mr. MacLellan has mentioned when his father was living on Loch Fyneside in Argyll, designed the Foursome Dance over swords as a counter to the Lochaber Dance, which was initially danced over Lochaber axes. The Broadsword indicated the basket-hilted sword worn by officers of Highland Regiments and sometimes miscalled the Claymore, which is a large two-handed weapon. The original version of the Broadswords Dance is described in Mr. MacLellan’s book, and the steps, four strathspey and one quick–time, and drill for marching on and off a dancing stage are simpler and less elaborate than those seen in some present day forms of the dance. It is not an “Old Thyme” dance and it is not Regimental in origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Thin Red Line Regimental Magazine of the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders|year=1951|location=UK|page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The influence of the Dance in Highland Regiments===
[[File:Highland dance.jpg|right|thumb|alt=Highland dance|RIT, P and Ds and D Coy with local children who put on a Highland Dancing display in Topermory, Isle of Mull
]]
Due to the popularity, it encouraged the recovery of traditional prestige on influence in Highland Dancing culture and competition. It increased more training and intensive preparation, or students amongst students attending the Piping Course in Edinburgh, or schoolboys from Queen Victoria School performing at the Royal Tournament in London and the Festival Tattoo in Edinburgh, due to the Highland Dancing interest.To inspire schoolboys to join the events, the school provided special instruction of Highland Dancing. In the south of England, highland and Scottish country dancing caused a wave of enthusiasm to sweep over the Service Establishments. Many officers of Highland Brigade supported the dancing, and it was taught at the Joint Service Staff College, the Army Staff College, the Royal Navy College, and the Royal Military Academy. The only “fortress” holding out against this Scottish “investment” is the R.A.F. Staff College.
[[File:Scottish Regimental Sword dance.jpg|right|thumb|alt=Scottish Regimental Sword dance|Pipers of the 1st  Battalion perform the Sword Dance]]
The Highland dancers of Regimental Headquarter---Sgt.Oliver, Cpls,Yule and Eliott and Pte.Ferguson---gained notable successes at the Games at Oban on 15 September {{clarify|date=February 2018}} . The Regimental Foursome won the Alasdair Maclean Challenge Cup for Regimental Reel Dancing, beating the Gordon Highlanders’ and the Highlander Light Infantry Foursomes. Cpl.Yule won the Poltalloch Cup, presented by Colonel George Malcolm, for the non-professional dancer serving in the Armed Forces who obtained the highest aggregate of marks in the four individual dancing competitions. This was the first year of competition for the Cup.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Thin Red Line Regimental Magazine of the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders|year=1955|location=UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Scottish Official Board of Highland Dancing has published its Manual on the technique and performance of the traditional Highland dances, individual and foursome. This is a comprehensive guide, with illustrations of basic positions, movements, and steps. The organisation and conduct of competitions in Highland dancing are also dealt with within the book.

===The Regimental Piping and Dancing Society===
A Society has been formed to stimulate interest in the playing of the Highland Bagpipe, to create enthusiasm for Highland Dancing, and so raise the level of performance of both these arts in the units of the Regiment.
The aims of the Society are:--
A.  To assist in the training of pipers and Highland dancers generally in the Regiment, and to watch their progress throughout their Regimental career.
B. To standardise settings for pipe music throughout the Regiment.
C. To assist pipe presidents in all ways possible in their duties, both technical and administrative, in order to maintain the highest standard of piping and dancing in the Regiment.
D. To train judges in piping and dancing for the benefit of Regimental and National competition.
A Regimental Committee, representative of all the Battalions of the Regiment, is required to develop the policy of the Society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Thin Red Line Regimental Magazine of the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders|year=1956|issue=Vol.10|location=UK|pages=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Shockheaded Peter''''' is a 1998 musical using the popular German children's book ''[[Struwwelpeter]]'' (1845) by [[Heinrich Hoffmann (author)|Heinrich Hoffmann]] as its basis.

Created by [[Julian Bleach]], [[Anthony Cairns]], [[Julian Crouch]], [[Graeme Gilmour]], [[Tamzin Griffin]], [[Jo Pocock]], [[Phelim McDermott]], [[Artangel|Michael Morris]] and [[The Tiger Lillies]] ([[Martyn Jacques]], Adrian Huge and Adrian Stout) the production combines elements of [[pantomime]] and [[puppetry]] with musical versions of the poems with the songs generally following the text but with a somewhat darker tone. Whereas the children in the poems only sometimes die, in the musical they all do. Commissioned by the [[West Yorkshire Playhouse]] in Leeds and the [[Lyric Hammersmith]] in West London, the show debuted in 1998 in Leeds before moving to London and subsequently to world tours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Elyse Sommer|title=''Shockheaded Peter'' Makes a Comeback|url=http://www.curtainup.com/shockheadedpeterny.html#Original%20Shockheaded%20Peter%20Review|publisher=CurtainUp|year=2005| accessdate=2009-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''show tune''' is a [[popular song|song]] originally written as part of the score of a [[musical theatre|musical stage show or musical]], especially if the piece in question has become a [[Standard (music)|standard]], more or less detached in most people's minds from the original context.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allmusic.com/style/show-tunes-ma0000002852 "Show Tunes"], AllMusic.com, accessed March 13, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Particular musicals that have yielded popular “show tunes” include:

Though show tunes vary in style, they do tend to share common characteristics&amp;mdash;they usually fit the context of a story being told in the original musical, they are useful in enhancing and heightening choice moments. A particularly common form of show tune is the [["I Want" song]], which composer Stephen Schwartz noted as being particularly likely to have a lifespan outside the show that spawned it.&lt;ref name="writers"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musicalwriters.com/write/stephen-schwartz/songs/i-want-songs.htm|title=Writing "I Want Songs" for Musicals|accessdate=May 31, 2014|first=Carol |last=de Giere|publisher=MusicalWriters.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Show tunes were a major venue for popular music before the [[rock and roll]] and [[television]] era; most of the hits of such songwriters as Jerome Kern, [[Cole Porter]], and [[George Gershwin]] came from their shows. (Even into the television and rock era, a few stage musicals managed to turn their show tunes into major pop music hits, sometimes aided by film adaptations and exposure through [[variety show]]s.) Although show tunes no longer have such a major role in popular music as they did in their heyday, they remain somewhat popular, especially among niche audiences. Show tunes make up a disproportionate part of the songs in most variations of the [[Great American Songbook]].

The reverse phenomenon, when already popular songs are used to form the basis of a stage musical, is known as a [[jukebox musical]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25183">'''Television in the Netherlands''' was officially [[Timeline of the introduction of television in countries|introduced in 1951]]. In the 1930s there were already experiments though. In the [[Netherlands]], the [[television]] market is divided between a number of commercial networks, such as [[RTL Nederland]], and a system of public broadcasters sharing three channels, [[NPO 1]], [[NPO 2]], and [[NPO 3]]. Imported programmes (except those for children), as well as news interviews with responses in a foreign language, are almost always shown in their original language, with [[subtitles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://southholland.angloinfo.com/countries/holland/tv.asp|title=Television, Satellite &amp; Radio Stations in the Netherlands|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
In the Netherlands, television can be watched analog or digital (the latter with the option of [[HDTV]] or [[3D Television|3D]]). Over 2013, 78.3% of Dutch viewers received television digitally.&lt;ref name=SKO&gt;{{cite web|last=Stichting Kijkonderzoek|title=Television in the Netherlands, 2013|url=https://kijkonderzoek.nl/images/TV_in_Nederland/SKOTV_IN_NEDERLAND_2013.pdf|publisher=Stichting KijkOnderzoek|accessdate=7 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Analogue television is only available via some cable operators and some fiber to the home providers, since the Dutch government ended analogue reception via airwaves in 2006. Dutch largest cable company [[Ziggo]] began to phase out the analogue signal in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.vodafoneziggo.nl/286/ziggo-maakt-tv-aanbod-volledig-digitaal |title=Ziggo maakt tv-aanbod volledig digitaal |date=8 March 2018 |publisher=VodafoneZiggo |language=Dutch |trans-title=Ziggo makes TV-offer fully digital }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://tweakers.net/nieuws/136069/ziggo-begint-in-april-met-uitschakelen-van-analoog-tv-signaal.html |title=Ziggo begint in april met uitschakelen van analoog tv-signaal |author=Julian Huijbregts |date=8 March 2018 |language=Dutch |trans-title=Ziggo to start shutting down analogue TV signal in April |website=[[Tweakers]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Watching digital television is possible through a variety of ways, the most common being:
*Digital television over [[Coaxial cable|cable]] (in most cases through a [[set-top box]] with a [[smart card#Other|smart card]] or through a [[Conditional-access module]]).
**[[Ziggo]] is the major supplier of cable television in the Netherlands.
*[[Satellite television]]
**[[CanalDigitaal]] and Joyne are the two satellite providers.
*[[Digital terrestrial television]]
**KPN [[Digitenne]] is the only terrestrial provider.
*Internet television ([[IPTV]])
**[[KPN]] (subsidiaries [[Telfort]] and [[XS4ALL]]) and [[Tele2]] are the two major suppliers of IPTV.
*[[Fiber to the home]]
** [[KPN]] is the major operator of FTTH with its subsidiaries KPN Glasvezel, [[Glashart]] and [[Reggefiber]].

Which television channels can be received is heavily dependent on the operator and in most cases also the channel package that is paid for. However, there is a small selection of channels that every operator [[must-carry|must carry]]. Since 2014, these are the following channels:&lt;ref name=Kabelraad&gt;{{cite web|website=Rechtennieuws.nl|title=Tv kijker kan rekenen op minimaal 30 digitale zenders|url=https://rechtennieuws.nl/40751/tv-kijker-kan-rekenen-op-minimaal-30-digitale-zenders/|date=8 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[NPO 1]]
*[[NPO 2]]
*[[NPO 3]]
*[[Één|één]] (Flanders (Belgium))
*[[Canvas (Belgian TV channel)|Canvas]] (Flanders (Belgium))
*[[Ketnet]] (Flanders (Belgium))
*Regional ([[Provinces of the Netherlands|provincial]]) broadcasters (when available) &lt;!-- The BES-islands are not part of a province and hence do not have a provincial broadcaster! --&gt;
*Local broadcaster (when available)

==Public channels==
The [[Netherlands]] has three nationwide channels for publicly funded television ([[Nederlandse Publieke Omroep|NPO]]). These channels can only make a fixed maximum amount of money from commercials. These commercials never interrupt broadcasts, and are only shown in between shows. The broadcasting organisations that use these channels are basically representative of the Dutch society. Every broadcasting company has members and the number of members gives them a status that is connected to the number of hours of broadcasting. If you are planning to 'go public' on Dutch television you need to have 50.000 members and something new to add to the existing broadcasting conglomerate. Granting or refusal of entry is decided politically on the guidance of public opinion.

In 2005 there was a sharp political debate over government plans to cut funding to public broadcasters and to abolish statutory broadcaster [[Nederlandse Programma Stichting|NPS]].

===National===
The three national television channels are:
* [[NPO 1]]
* [[NPO 2]]
* [[NPO 3]]

===Thematic===
The five digital television channels that are provided by the [[Nederlandse Publieke Omroep]] organisation, are:
* [[NPO 1 Extra]] / [[NPO Zapp Xtra]]
* [[NPO 2 Extra]]
* [[NPO 3 Extra]]
* [[NPO Nieuws]]
* [[NPO Politiek]] / [[NPO Sport]]

===International===
There is also an international public channel:
* [[BVN]], shared with [[Belgium]]'s publicly funded Flemish television channel [[Vlaamse Radio- en Televisieomroep|VRT]]. It shows the best of Dutch and Flemish public television, specifically for [[Dutch people|Dutch]] and [[Flemish people|Flemish]] viewers abroad.

===Regional===
Most regions and provinces have their own television channel as well. These also receive government funding:
* [[AT5]] ([[Amsterdam#Definitions|Greater Amsterdam]])
* [[Omrop Fryslân]] ([[Friesland]]), in [[West Frisian language|West Frisian]]
* [[RTV Noord]] ([[Groningen (province)|Groningen]])

==High-definition==
In the Netherlands customers can receive [[high-definition television]] channels by cable or satellite. There is no terrestrial HD service available at the moment. Although KPN is switching its digital terrestrial television platform to the [[DVB-T2]] HEVC standard, making HD possibile in the future.&lt;ref name="dvbt"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.totaaltv.nl/nieuws/omschakeling-digitenne-dvbt2-en-hd-begint-op-1-oktober-in-het-noorden/ |title=Omschakeling Digitenne DVB-T2 en HD begint op 1 oktober in het noorden |accessdate=11 August 2018 |author=Jarco Kriek and Jan-Hein Visser |date=25 June 2018 |work=TotaalTV.nl |language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first trials with high-definition television in the Netherlands began in 2006 with the broadcast of the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 World Cup]] in HD. After the trial the larger cable companies continued a HD service with a small number of channels such as [[National Geographic (Dutch TV channel)|National Geographic Channel HD]], [[Discovery HD|Discovery HD Showcase]], [[History (European TV channel)|History HD]], [[Film1|Film1 HD]] and [[Ziggo Sport Totaal|Sport1 HD]]. The demand for HD was low because no Dutch network had made the move to HD, already broadcasting in [[widescreen]] and the quality of the [[standard-definition television|standard-definition]] [[PAL]] signal was good enough for most people.

Since the 2006 trials none of the main Dutch networks made the move to HD. This changed in the summer of 2008 when from 1 June 2008 until 24 August 2008, the [[Netherlands Public Broadcasting]] (NPO) organisations made their primary channel, [[NPO 1|Nederland 1]] temporary available in HD. This made it possible to broadcast [[UEFA Euro 2008|Euro 2008]], the [[2008 Tour de France]], and the [[2008 Summer Olympics]] in HD and additionally allowed them to test their systems before the scheduled launch of their permanent HD service in early 2009. The NPO planned to launch their permanent HD service with HD versions of their three channels [[NPO 1|Nederland 1]], [[NPO 2|Nederland 2]], and [[NPO 3|Nederland 3]]. Most of the programming in the early stages consisted of upscaled material from their SD channels as in time more programs will became available in HD.&lt;ref name="marketingfactsnpohd"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marketingfacts.nl/berichten/nederland_1_2_en_3_in_2009_deels_in_hdtv/ |title=Nederland 1, 2 en 3 in 2009 deels in HDTV |accessdate=2009-10-21 |author=Paulo Lopes |date=2008-05-19 |work=Marketingfacts |language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[w:nl:Technicolor Nederland|Technicolor Netherlands]], the company responsible for the technical realisation of the broadcasts of the NPOs television and radio channels, began the summer 2008 test broadcast of Nederland 1 1 HD in [[720p]]/50 as the [[European Broadcasting Union]] (EBU) recommends. During the test period an additional [[1080i]]/25 version of the channel was made available to the cable companies because of quality complaints from viewers. In 2009 the NPO decided to adopt the 1080i/25 HD standard.&lt;ref name="1080i"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://nl.hardware.info/nieuws/15786/publieke-omroep-hd-in-1080i-formaat |title=Publieke Omroep HD in 1080i formaat |accessdate=11 August 2018 |author=Eric van Ballegoie |date=23 June 2009 |work=Hardware.Info |language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Development===

''Interrobang.com''. Retrieved July 29, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;  The network ordered a pilot episode in January 2013, at which time [[Mira Sorvino]] was attached to play Gaffigan's wife, with Christian Barillas and [[Tongayi Chirisa]] in supporting roles. CBS passed on the series in May 2013 and instead planned to redevelop it for the 2014-15 television season. The series was recast with new cast members Williams, Goldberg and Black. CBS passed on the series in May 2014, and [[Sony Pictures Television]] began shopping it to other networks. It was announced in July 2014 that [[TV Land]] had ordered the series and, unlike previous networks, granted the Gaffigans full creative control.&lt;ref name=ophira/&gt; Jim Gaffigan said of the announcement: "I am thrilled that TV Land is giving us this opportunity to do this show that Peter, Jeannie and I have been fine-tuning for three years."&lt;ref name="Goldberg0729" /&gt; TV Land president Larry W. Jones said the series was perfect for its target audience of [[Generation X]]ers who are raising families. Jones said: "We love Jim Gaffigan's brand of humor. The second we saw this show we knew we wanted it on TV Land."&lt;ref name="Goldberg0729" /&gt;

===Writing===
The series is partially based on the real lives of Jim and Jeannie Gaffigan, who have five children and live in a two-bedroom apartment in New York City.&lt;ref name="Goldberg0729" /&gt; The age differences between the children were shortened for the television show, and Jeannie said, "The TV kids are sort of a snapshot of an earlier time in our lives when they were all younger".&lt;ref name="McGlynn0330" /&gt; Episodes are built around actual incidents they've experienced.&lt;ref name=ophira&gt;Eisenberg, Ophira (July 9, 2015), [https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=421350059 "According to Jim (Gaffigan)"]. ''Ask Me Another''. NPR. Retrieved August 2, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Other regular topics of Jim Gaffigan's stand-up comedy are part of the series, particularly his love of food. Jeannie said the list of props for the show is "almost 90 percent food ... which I thought was pretty funny".&lt;ref name="McGlynn0330" /&gt;

Although Jim will play a comedian, a conscious decision was made not to regularly intersperse the narrative with his stand-up comedy, like in such popular shows as ''[[Seinfeld (TV series)|Seinfeld]]'' and ''[[Louie (U.S. TV series)|Louie]]''. He said of this decision: "I want this to be more about what happens off the stage. ... 'Stand-up comedian' is an occupation and, like our pilot, we're evolving into a much more mature show."&lt;ref name="McGlynn0330" /&gt; Jim Gaffigan and Peter Tolan wrote the pilot together.&lt;ref name="Goldberg0729" /&gt;  The rest of the series is written by Jim and his wife Jeannie.

===Crew===
Jeff Lowell was the [[showrunner]] for Season 1 ''The Jim Gaffigan Show'', and served as an executive producer along with Jim and Jeannie Gaffigan, Jim's real-life wife, a fictional version of whom will also appear in the show. Jeannie took over the [[showrunner]] position for Season 2. Alex Murray and Sandy Wernick will also be executive producers.&lt;ref name="Futon" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Goldberg0729"&gt;{{cite news |last=Goldberg |first=Lesley |title=CBS' Jim Gaffigan Comedy Moves to TV Land With Series Order |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=July 29, 2014 |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/cbs-jim-gaffigan-comedy-moves-718505 |accessdate=March 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Episodes are available on video on demand on cable outlets and for streaming on Hulu (with a paid subscription) three weeks after airing on TV Land.

''The List'' is an independent limited company and was founded in October 1985 by Robin Hodge (publisher)&lt;ref name="bbc14"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McKay|first=Jenny|title=The Magazines Handbook|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=VMSEAgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA207&amp;dq=%22The%20List%22%20Hodge%201985&amp;pg=PA207#v=onepage&amp;q=%22The%20List%22%20Hodge%201985&amp;f=false|year=2000|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781134698851|page=207}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Nigel Billen (founding editor).

'''''Mirror''''' ({{lang-ru|Зеркало|Zerkalo}}; known in the United States as ''The Mirror''&lt;ref&gt;Tarkovsky's official English translator, Kitty Hunter-Blair, always referred to the film as ''Mirror'' not ''The Mirror'' which was a later innovation unauthorized by the filmmaker.&lt;/ref&gt;) is a 1975&lt;ref&gt;In markets outside the US the year of production of ''Mirror'' is often stated as 1974 since principal photography began in late July 1973 and ended in March 1974. The final edit was achieved by the autumn of 1974 although distribution proper began in April 1975&lt;/ref&gt; [[Russian film|Russian]] [[art film]] directed by [[Andrei Tarkovsky]]. It is loosely autobiographical, unconventionally structured, and incorporates poems composed and read by the director's father, [[Arseny Tarkovsky]]. The film features [[Margarita Terekhova]], Ignat Daniltsev, [[Alla Demidova]], [[Anatoli Solonitsyn]], Tarkovsky's wife [[Larisa Tarkovskaya]] and his mother Maria Vishnyakova. [[Innokenty Smoktunovsky]] provides voiceover and [[Eduard Artemyev]] the incidental music and sound effects.

''Mirror'' is structured in the form of a [[nonlinear narrative]]. It unfolds as an organic flow of memories recalled by a dying poet (based on Tarkovsky's own father Arseny, who in reality would outlive his son by three years) of key moments in his life both with respect to his immediate family as well as that of the Russian people as a whole during the tumultuous events of the twentieth century. In an effort to represent these themes visually, the film combines contemporary scenes with childhood memories, dreams, and newsreel footage. Its cinematography slips, often unpredictably, between color, black-and-white, and [[Sepia tone|sepia]]. The film's loose flow of visually [[Oneiric (film theory)|oneiric images]], combined with its rich – and often symbolic – imagery has been compared with the [[Stream of consciousness writing|stream of consciousness]] technique in [[Modernism|modernist]] literature.

The main concept of ''Mirror'' dates as far back as 1964. Over the years Tarkovsky wrote several screenplay variants, at times working with [[Aleksandr Misharin (screenwriter)|Aleksandr Misharin]]. Their mutually developed script initially was not approved by the film committee of [[Goskino]], and it was only after several years of waiting that Tarkovsky would be allowed to realize the project. At various times the script was known under different names, most notably ''Confession'' and ''A White, White Day''. The completed film was initially rejected by Goskino, and after some delay was given only limited release in the Soviet Union.

''Mirror'' initially polarized critics and audiences, with many considering its narrative to be incomprehensible. The work has grown in reputation since its release, and ranked nineteenth in ''[[Sight &amp; Sound]]'''s 2012 critics' poll of the best films ever made, and ninth in the directors' poll.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Sight &amp; Sound 2012 Polls {{!}} BFI|url = http://explore.bfi.org.uk/sightandsoundpolls/2012/|website = explore.bfi.org.uk|accessdate = 2015-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sight &amp; Sound Revises Best-Films-Ever Lists|url=http://www.studiodaily.com/2012/08/sight-sound-revises-best-films-ever-lists/|accessdate=1 August 2012|newspaper=studiodaily|date=1 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also found favor with many Russians for whom it remains their most beloved of Tarkovsky's works.&lt;ref&gt;"...remains today most Russians' favourite Tarkovsky film." Synessios (2001). Tarkovsky himself recounts in ''[[Sculpting In Time]]'' that Mirror provoked an overwhelming audience response that dwarfed his other movies. He received hundreds of letters expressing in the most movingly intimate terms how the film had made a profound impact on them.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==

===Structure and content===
''Mirror'' depicts the thoughts, emotions and memories of Alexei, or Alyosha (Ignat Daniltsev), and the world around him as a child, adolescent, and forty-year-old. The adult Alexei is only briefly glimpsed, but is present as a voice-over in some scenes including substantial dialogue. The structure of the film is discontinuous and nonchronological, without a conventional plot, and combines incidents, dreams and memories along with some news-reel footage.&lt;ref&gt;Timo Hoyer: Filmarbeit – Traumarbeit. Andrej Tarkowskij und sein Film "Der Spiegel" ("Serkalo"). In: R. Zwiebel / A. Mahler-Bungers (Hrsg.): Projektion und Wirklichkeit. Die unbewusste Botshaft des Films. Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht, Göttingen 2007, S. 85–110. {{ISBN|3-525-45179-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The film switches among three different time-frames: prewar (1935), war-time (1940s), and postwar (1960s or '70s).

''Mirror'' draws heavily on Tarkovsky's own childhood. Memories such as the evacuation from Moscow to the countryside during the war, a withdrawn father and his own mother, who actually worked as a [[Proofreading|proof-reader]] at a printing press, feature prominently.

===Synopsis===
The film opens with Alexei's adolescent son Ignat (also played by Ignat Daniltsev) switching on a television and watching the examination of a stammerer by a physician. After the opening titles roll, a scene is set in the countryside during prewar times in which Alexei's mother Maria ([[Margarita Terekhova]]) — also called Masha and Marusya — talks with a doctor ([[Anatoli Solonitsyn]]) who chances to be passing by. The exterior and interior of Alexei's grandfather's country house are seen. The young Alexei, his mother and sister watch as the family barn burns down. In a dream sequence Maria is washing her hair. Now in the postwar time-frame, Alexei is heard talking with his mother Maria on the phone while rooms of an apartment are seen. Switching back to the prewar time-frame, Maria is seen rushing frantically to her work-place as a proof-reader at a printing press. She is worrying about a mistake she may have overlooked, but is comforted by her colleague Liza ([[Alla Demidova]]), who then abruptly reduces her to tears with withering criticism. Back in postwar time, Alexei quarrels with his wife, Natalia (also played by [[Margarita Terekhova]]), who has divorced him and is living with their son Ignat. This is followed by news-reel scenes from the [[Spanish Civil War]] and of a balloon ascent in the U.S.S.R. In the next scene, set in Alexei's apartment, Ignat meets with a strange woman (Tamara Ogorodnikova) sitting at a table. At her request, Ignat reads a passage from a letter by [[Alexander Pushkin|Pushkin]] and receives a telephone call from his father Alexei. The strange woman vanishes mysteriously. Switching to war-time, the adolescent Alexei is seen undergoing rifle training with a dour instructor, intercut with news-reel footage of [[World War II]] and the [[Sino-Soviet border conflict]]. The reunion of Alexei and his sister with their father ([[Oleg Yankovsky]]) at war's end is shown. The film then returns to the quarrel between Alexei and his wife Natalia in the postwar sequence. Switching again to prewar time, vistas of the country house and surrounding countryside are followed by a dreamlike sequence showing a levitating Maria. The film then moves to the postwar time, showing Alexei apparently on his death-bed with a mysterious malady. The final scene plays in the prewar time-frame, showing a pregnant mother, Maria, intercut with scenes showing Maria young and old. (Old Maria is played by Tarkovsky's own mother, Maria Vishnyakova.)

===Writing===
The concept of ''Mirror'' dates as far back as 1964, when Tarkovsky wrote down his idea for a film about the dreams and memories of a man, though without the man appearing on screen as he would in a conventional film. The first episodes of ''Mirror'' were written while Tarkovsky was working on ''[[Andrei Rublev (film)|Andrei Rublev]]''. These episodes were published as a short story under the title ''A White Day'' in 1970. The title was taken from a 1942 poem by his father, [[Arseny Tarkovsky]]. In 1968, after having finished ''Andrei Rublev'', Tarkovsky went to the cinematographer's resort in [[Repino]] intending to write the script for ''The Mirror'' together with Aleksandr Misharin. This script was titled ''Confession'' and was proposed to the film committee at [[Goskino]]. Although it contained popular themes – for example, a heroic mother, the war, and patriotism – the proposal was turned down. The main reason was most likely the complex and unconventional nature of the script. Moreover, Tarkovsky and Misharin clearly stated that they did not know what the final form of the film would be – this was to be determined in the process of filming.&lt;ref name="TarkovskyScreenplays"&gt;{{cite book | last = Tarkovsky | first = Andrei | others = | editor =William Powell | title = Collected Screenplays | publisher = Faber &amp; Faber | year = 1999 | location = London | pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the script being turned down by the film committee, Tarkovsky went on to make the film ''[[Solaris (1972 film)|Solaris]]''. But his diary entries show that he was still eager to make the film. Finally, the script was approved by the new head of Goskino, Filipp Ermash in the summer of 1973. Tarkovsky was given a budget of 622,000 [[Soviet ruble]] and 7500 metres (24,606 feet) of Kodak film, corresponding to 110 minutes, or roughly three takes assuming a film length of 3000 metres (10,000 feet).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Tarkovsky | first = Andrei | translator = Kitty Hunter-Blair | title = Time Within Time: The Diaries 1970–1986 | publisher = [[Seagull Book]] | year = 1991 | location = Calcutta | page = 77 (July 11, 1973) | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 81-7046-083-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several versions of the script for ''Mirror'' exist, as Tarkovsky constantly rewrote parts of the script, with the latest variant of the script written in 1974 while he was in Italy. One scene that was in the script but that was removed during shooting was an interview with his mother. Tarkovsky wanted to use a hidden camera to interview her on the pretext that it was research for the film. This scene was one of the main reasons why [[Vadim Yusov]], who was the camera-man for all of Tarkovsky's previous films refused to work with him on this film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Tarkovsky | first = Andrei | translator = Kitty Hunter-Blair | title = Time Within Time: The Diaries 1970–1986 | publisher = [[Seagull Book]] | year = 1991 | location = Calcutta | pages = 60–61 (September 17, 1972) | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 81-7046-083-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; At various times, the script and the film was known under the titles ''Confession'', ''Redemption'', ''Martyrology'', ''Why are you standing so far away?'', ''The Raging Stream'' and ''A White, White Day'' (sometimes also translated as ''A Bright, Bright Day''.). Only while filming Tarkovsky decided to finally title the film ''Mirror''.&lt;ref name="TarkovskyScreenplays" /&gt; (The final film does indeed feature several mirrors with some scenes shot in reflection.)

A poster of Tarkovsky's 1966 film ''[[Andrei Rublev (film)|Andrei Rublev]]'' is seen on a wall.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.electricsheepmagazine.co.uk/reviews/2011/07/16/mirror/|title=''Mirror''|last=Cairns|first=David|date=16 July 2011|website=Electric Sheep|accessdate=18 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Mirror'' thus forms the third part, together with Tarkovsky's previous film ''[[Solaris (1972 film)|Solaris]]'' which was made in 1972 and which references [[Andrei Rublev]] by having an icon made by him being placed in the main character's room,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/feb/12/featuresreviews.guardianreview11|title=Out of this world|last=Jones|first=Jonathan|date=12 February 2005|publisher=''[[The Guardian]]''|accessdate=18 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a series of three films by Tarkovsky referencing [[Andrei Rublev]].

===Casting===
Initially, Tarkovsky considered [[Alla Demidova]] and Swedish actress [[Bibi Andersson]] for the role of the mother. In the end [[Margarita Terekhova]] was chosen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Tarkovsky | first = Andrei | translator = Kitty Hunter-Blair | title = Time Within Time: The Diaries 1970–1986 | publisher = [[Seagull Book]] | year = 1991 | location = Calcutta | page = 41 (August 20, 1971) | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 81-7046-083-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Filming===
[[Principal photography]] began in late July 1973&lt;ref&gt; Synessios 2001, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; and ended in March 1974. Outdoor scenes were shot in Tutshkovo near Moscow and the indoor scenes were shot at the [[Mosfilm]] studio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Tarkovsky | first = Andrei | translator = Kitty Hunter-Blair | title = Time Within Time: The Diaries 1970–1986 | publisher = [[Seagull Book]] | year = 1991 | location = Calcutta | pages = 78, 92–93 (September 30, 1973 &amp; March 8, 17, 1974) | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 81-7046-083-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The naturalist style of the film required Margarita Terekhova to forego makeup completely.&lt;ref name=bulvar1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bulvar.com.ua/gazeta/archive/s45_64269/6507.html|publisher=Bulvar Gordona|author=Dmitry Gordon|title=Маргарита ТЕРЕХОВА: "Рубить голову петуху?

I'm an actor, and not the - what is it? - flayer "|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The completed film was initially rejected by Filipp Ermash, the head of Goskino in July 1974. One reason given was that the film is incomprehensible. Tarkovsky was infuriated about this rejection and even toyed with the idea of going abroad and making a film outside the Soviet Union. ''Mirror'' was ultimately approved by Goskino without any changes in fall 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Tarkovsky | first = Andrei | translator = Kitty Hunter-Blair | title = Time Within Time: The Diaries 1970–1986 | publisher = [[Seagull Book]] | year = 1991 | location = Calcutta | pages = 96–97 (July 27, 29 &amp; August 1, 1974) | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 81-7046-083-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Release==
{{expand section|date=December 2012}}
''Mirror'' never had an official premiere and had only a limited, second category release with only 73 copies. Although it was officially announced for September 1975, it was shown as early as March 1975.

==Reception==
When Mosfilm critics were asked in November 1974 to evaluate ''Mirror'', responses were divided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/62554%7C0/The-Mirror.html|title=The Mirror|last=Steffen|first=James|publisher=Turner Classic Movies, Inc.|accessdate=March 9, 2017|quote=The finished film was widely criticized for being too 'elite' and private for what was supposed to be a 'mass' art form.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some viewed it as a major work that would be better understood upon the analysis of future generations; others dismissed it as an unfocused failure and believed that even more cultured viewers would find its story opaque. This resulted in a very limited [[Film distribution|distribution]].{{sfn|Synessios|2001|p=114–115}} Many audience members walked out of theatrical screenings, but those who approved of the work were ardent in their praise.{{sfn|Synessios|2001|p=116}} In a 1975 article for ''[[The New York Times]]'', James F. Clarity reported that "in the first round of published reviews, in which some of Mr. Tarkovsky's fellow film makers evaluated his new work, there is much praise, tempered with criticism of some parts of the film."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9E06E1D6173BE336A05750C1A9629C946490D6CF|title=NEW FILM STIRS SOVIET AUDIENCE:'Mirror' by Tarkovsky Is Unorthodox and Popular|last=Clarity|first=James F.|newspaper=The New York Times|date=April 13, 1975|accessdate=March 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Goskino]] did not allow it to be shown at the [[Cannes Film Festival]]. The managing director of the festival, Maurice Bessy, was sympathetic to Tarkovsky. Upon hearing that ''Mirror'' would not be allowed to be shown in Cannes, he unsuccessfully threatened not to take any other Soviet film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Tarkovsky | first = Andrei | translator = Kitty Hunter-Blair | title = Time Within Time: The Diaries 1970–1986 | publisher = [[Seagull Book]] | year = 1991 | location = Calcutta | pages = 106–109 (March 2, April 8, 11, 1975) | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 81-7046-083-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Mirror'' is now frequently listed among the [[List of films considered the best|greatest films of all time]]. In a 2012 ''[[Sight &amp; Sound]]'' directors' poll, ''Mirror'' ranked as the 9th greatest film of all time. In a parallel poll by film critics, the film ranks at No. 19. In 2012, [[Will Self]] argued that it remains 'the most beautiful film ever made'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://thequietus.com/articles/09180-looking-in-looking-out-2012 |title= Looking In, Looking Out Film Festival  |publisher= [[The Quietus]] |date = 2012-06-27 |accessdate=2012-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter Bradshaw]] of ''[[The Guardian]]'' called it "a startling piece of film-making" and described many of its images as "transcendentally brilliant".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/News_Story/Critic_Review/Guardian_review/0,,1281613,00.html|title=Mirror|last=Bradshaw|first=Peter|newspaper=The Guardian|date=August 13, 2004|accessdate=March 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[British Film Institute]], the film is billed as "a work of cumulative, rhythmic effect" and its unconventional narrative is credited with having "pioneered a poetic and richly allusive form."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6bb90873|title=Mirror (1974)|publisher=British Film Institute|accessdate=March 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Director [[Michael Haneke]] voted for ''Mirror'' in the 2002 ''[[Sight &amp; Sound]]'' directors' poll, and later said that he has seen the picture at least 25 times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2009/10/05/happy-haneke|title=Happy Haneke|publisher=[[The New Yorker]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2013/01/23/michael_haneke_art_doesn%E2%80%99t_offer_answers_only_questions/|title=Michael Haneke: "Art doesn’t offer answers, only questions"|publisher=[[Salon (website)|Salon]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretation==
{{Expand section|date=March 2017}}
While highly acclaimed, ''Mirror'' continues to be viewed as enigmatic, and has been considered a plotless film. Natasha Synessios wrote that it is closer in structure to a musical piece than a narrative film, noting that Tarkovsky himself "always maintained that he used the laws of music as the film's organisational principle...emphasis placed not on the ''logic'', but the ''form'', of the flow of events."{{sfn|Redwood|2010|p=63}} Critic Antti Alanen billed the film as a "space odyssey into the interior of the psyche" and Tarkovsky's ''[[In Search of Lost Time]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/sightandsoundpoll2012/voter/785|title=Antti Alanen|publisher=British Film Institute|accessdate=March 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Howard Hampton argued that the work's central subject is "the inescapable persistence of the [[past]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/sightandsoundpoll2012/voter/539|title=Howard Hampton|publisher=British Film Institute|accessdate=March 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trivia==
* A [[recitative]] from [[Johan Sebastian Bach]]'s ''[[Johannes-Passion]]'' (''"Und siehe da, der Vorhang im Tempel..."'') features in the score, as does the opening chorus from the ''[[Johannes-Passion]]'' (''"Herr, unser Herrscher, dessen Ruhm in allen Landen herrlich ist!"'') accompanying the film's memorable closing scene.
* Another of [[Bach]]'s works [[Orgelbüchlein|''Das alte Jahr vergangen ist'', BWV 614]], played by [[Leonid Roizman]], is heard during the opening credits.
* The soundtrack also features an aria from [[Henry Purcell]]'s ''[[The Indian Queen (opera)|The Indian Queen]]'' (''"They tell us that your mighty powers"''), played by [[Bath Festival Orchestra]] and conducted by [[Yehudi Menuhin]].
* A poster of Tarkovsky's 1966 film ''[[Andrei Rublev (film)|Andrei Rublev]]'' is seen on a wall.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;
* Dante Alighieri's Divine Comedy is quoted by the skipping collaborator at the Printing Press: "Nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita, ..."

[[File:Zoetrope.jpg|thumb|A modern replica of a Victorian zoetrope]]
A '''zoetrope''' is one of several [[Precursors of film#Modern era|pre-film]] [[animation]] devices that produce the illusion of motion by displaying a sequence of drawings or photographs showing progressive phases of that motion.

==Etymology==
The name ''zoetrope'' was composed from the [[Greek language|Greek]] root words ζωή ''zoe'', "life" and τρόπος ''tropos'', "turning" as a transliteration of "wheel of life".
The term was coined by inventor William George Horner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=_1lIAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=%22william+e.+lincoln%22+zoetrope&amp;dq=%22william+e.+lincoln%22+zoetrope&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiVjKSipKfYAhVkF8AKHdd4DJ8Q6AEIKTAA|title=Harper's Magazine|date=10 April 2018|publisher=Harper's Magazine Company|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technology==
The zoetrope consists of a cylinder with cuts vertically in the sides. On the inner surface of the cylinder is a band with images from a set of sequenced pictures. As the cylinder spins, the user looks through the slits at the pictures across. The scanning of the slits keeps the pictures from simply blurring together, and the user sees a rapid succession of images, producing the illusion of motion. From the late 19th century, devices working on similar principles have been developed, named analogously as [[#Linear zoetropes|linear zoetropes]] and [[#3D zoetropes|3D zoetropes]], with traditional zoetropes referred to as "cylindrical zoetropes" if distinction is needed.

The zoetrope works on the same principle as its predecessor, the [[phenakistoscope]], but is more convenient and allows the animation to be viewed by several people at the same time. Instead of being radially arrayed on a disc, the sequence of pictures depicting phases of motion is on a paper strip. For viewing, this is placed against the inner surface of the lower part of an open-topped metal drum, the upper part of which is provided with a vertical viewing slit across from each picture. The drum, on a spindle base, is spun. The faster the drum is spun, the smoother the animation appears.

==Earlier rotating devices with images==
[[File:1635 John Bate - The Mysteries of Nature and Art p.29.jpg|thumb|Device described in John Bate's ''The Mysteries of Nature and Art'' (1635)]]
An earthenware bowl from [[History of Iranian animation|Iran]], over 5000 years old, could be considered a predecessor of the zoetrope. This bowl is decorated in a series of images portraying a goat jumping toward a tree and eating its leaves.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.animationmagazine.net/article/8045 Oldest Animation Discovered In Iran]. ''Animation Magazine''. 12-03-2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The images are sequential and seem evenly distributed around the bowl, but the bowl would have to rotate quite fast and steady as a stroboscopic effect is needed for the images to appear as an animation. It remains very uncertain if the artist who created the bowl actually intended to create an animation.

According to a 4th-century Chinese historical text, the 1st-century BCE Chinese Han craftsman [[Ding Huan]] created a lamp with a circular band with images of birds and animals that moved "quite naturally" when the heat of the lamp caused the band to rotate. However, it is unclear whether this really created the illusion of motion or whether the account was an interpretation of the spatial movement of the pictures of animals.&lt;ref name="Rojas"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rojas|first=Carlos|title=The Oxford Handbook of Chinese Cinemas|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8F1pAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA5|year=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-998844-0|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Possibly the same device was referred to as "umbrella lamp" and mentioned as "a variety of zoetrope" which "may well have originated in China" by historian of Chinese technology Joseph Needham. It had pictures painted on thin panes of paper or mica on the sides of a light cylindrical canopy bearing vanes at the top. When placed over a lamp it would give an impression of movement of animals or men. Needham mentions several other descriptions of figures moving after the lighting of a candle or lamp, but some of these have a semi-fabulous context or can be compared to heat operated carousel toys.&lt;ref name="NeedhamIV-1"&gt;Needham, Joseph (1962). ''Science and Civilization in China'', vol. IV, part 1: ''Physics and Physical Technology''. Cambridge University Press. p. 123-124.&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible that all these early Chinese examples were actually the same as, or very similar to, the "trotting horse lamp" [走馬燈] known in China since before 1000 CE. This is a lantern which on the inside has cut-out silhouettes or painted figures attached to a shaft with a paper vane impeller on top, rotated by heated air rising from a lamp. The moving silhouettes are projected on the thin paper sides of the lantern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Js_lBAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA309&amp;ots=RtAiKy6JSA&amp;dq=%22trotting%20horse%22%20lamp&amp;pg=PA308#v=onepage&amp;q=%22trotting%20horse%22%20lamp&amp;f=false|title=A History of Chinese Science and Technology, Volume 3|author=Yongxiang Lu|pages=308–310}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some versions added extra motion with jointed heads, feet or hands of figures triggered by a transversely connected iron wire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=Js_lBAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA309&amp;ots=RtAiKy6JSA&amp;dq=%22trotting%20horse%22%20lamp&amp;pg=PA308#v=onepage&amp;q=%22trotting%20horse%22%20lamp&amp;f=false|title=A History of Chinese Science and Technology, Volume 3|author=Yongxiang Lu|pages=308–310}}&lt;/ref&gt; None of these lamps are known to have featured sequential substitution of images depicting motion and thus don't display animation in the way that the zoetrope does.

[[File:Livingpicturesth00hopw 0052R.jpg|thumb|Four phase animation device as depicted in Hopwood's ''Living Pictures'' (1899)]]
John Bate described a simple device in his 1634 book "The Mysteries of Nature and Art". It consisted of  "a light card, with several images set upon it" fastened on the four spokes of a wheel which was turned around by heat inside a glass or horn cylinder, "so that you would think the immages to bee living creatures by their motion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://docs.lib.noaa.gov/rescue/rarebooks_1600-1800/TC160B371654.pdf|year=1654|title=The Mysteries of Nature and Art|last=Bate|first=John|page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The description seems rather close to a simple four-phase animation device depicted and described in Henry V. Hopwood's 1899 book ''Living Pictures'' (see picture). Hopwood gave no name, date or any additional information for this toy that rotated when blown upon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/livingpicturesth00hopw#page/34/mode/2up|title=Living Pictures|last=Hopwood|first=Henry V.|year=1899}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar device inside a small zoetrope drum with four slits, was marketed around 1900 by a Parisian company as ''L'Animateur'' (or ''The Animator'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dickbalzer.com/Zoetropes.610.0.html|title=Dick Balzer's Website: Zoetropes|first=Richard|last=Balzer|website=www.dickbalzer.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Bate's device as it is seen in the accompanying illustration seems not to have actually animated the images, but rather to have moved the images around spatially.

==Invention==
===Simon Stampfer (1833)===
[[Simon Stampfer]], one of the inventors of the [[phenakistoscope|phenakistiscope]] animation disc (or "stroboscope discs" as he called them), suggested in July 1833 in a pamphlet that the sequence of images for the stroboscopic animation could be placed on either a disc, a cylinder or a looped strip of paper or canvas stretched around two parallel rollers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stampfer|first=Simon|title=Die stroboscopischen Scheiben; oder, Optischen Zauberscheiben: Deren Theorie und wissenschaftliche Anwendung |year=1833 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xUk0AQAAMAAJ&amp;lpg=PA2&amp;dq=stampfer%20scheiben&amp;pg=PA10-IA1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stampfer chose to publish his invention in the shape of a disc.

===William Horner (1834)===
After taking notice of [[Joseph Plateau]]'s invention of the phénakisticope (published in London as "phantasmascope") British mathematician [[William George Horner]] thought up a cylindrical variation and published details about its mathematical principles in January 1834.&lt;ref name="horner-1"&gt;{{cite book |title=The London and Edinburgh Philosophical Magazine and Journal of Science |year=1834 |pages=36 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XmrkAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA36&amp;lpg=PA36&amp;dq=On+the+Properties+of+the+Daedaleum,+A+New+Instrument+of+Optical+Illusion&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=GIznFi88Dq&amp;sig=MKGgcVmFx2hZ6bbCbPaeUV1bmiA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=G8kDUJmrO-ih0QWc0d21Bw&amp;ved=0CEgQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; He called his device the ''Dædaleum'', as a reference to the Greek myth of [[Daedalus]].&lt;ref name="Herbert1"&gt;Herbert, Stephen. (n.d.) [http://www.stephenherbert.co.uk/wheelZOETROPEpart1.htm ''From Daedaleum to Zoetrope'', Part 1.] Retrieved 2014-05-31.&lt;/ref&gt; Horner's revolving drum had viewing slits between the pictures, instead of above as the later zoetrope variations would have. Horner planned to publish the dædaleum with optician King, Jr in Bristol but it "met with some impediment probably in the sketching of the figures".&lt;ref name="horner-1" /&gt;

===Experimental photographic sequence viewers (1850s–1860s)===
[[File:1855 czermak - das Stereophoroskop (fig. 26) (crop).jpg|thumb|Czermak's 1855 Stereophoroskop]]
During the next three decades the phénakisticope remained the more common animation device, while relatively few experimental variations followed the idea of Horner's dædaleum or Stampfer's stroboscopic cylinder. Most of the zoetrope-like devices created between 1833 and 1865 were intended for viewing photographic sequences, often with a stereoscopic effect.&lt;ref name="Herbert1" /&gt; These included [[Johann Nepomuk Czermak]]'s Stereophoroskop, about which he published an article in 1855.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://echo.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/ECHOdocuView?url=/permanent/vlp/lit15017/index.meta&amp;viewMode=auto&amp;pn=1|last=Czermak|title=Das Stereophoroskop|year=1855|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 February 1860 Peter Hubert Desvignes received British patent no. 537 for 28 monocular and stereoscopic variations of cylindrical stroboscopic devices. This included a version that used an endless band of pictures running between two spools that was to be intermittently lit by an electric spark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=UXTAAgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA30&amp;ots=K-mYh9tD-4&amp;dq=peter+hubert+desvignes+patent&amp;pg=PA31#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Stereoscopic Cinema and the Origins of 3-D Film, 1838-1952|first=Ray|last=Zone|date=3 February 2014|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Desvignes' ''Mimoscope'', received an Honourable Mention "for ingenuity of construction" at the 1862 International Exhibition in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/medalsandhonour00goog|title=Medals and Honourable Mentions Awarded by the International Juries: With a ...|first=1862|last=International exhibition|date=10 April 1862|publisher=Her Majesty's Commissioners|via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; It could "exhibit drawings, models, single or stereoscopic photographs, so as to animate animal movements, or that of machinery, showing various other illusions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Handbook to the industrial department of the International exhibition, 1862|last=Hunt|first=Robert|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=-fUHAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA181#v}}&lt;/ref&gt; Desvignes "employed models, insects and other objects, instead of pictures, with perfect success." The horizontal slits (like in Czermak's Stereophoroskop) allowed a much improved view, with both eyes, of the opposite pictures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=5GFAAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=mimoscope&amp;pg=PA777#v=onepage&amp;q=mimoscope&amp;f=false|title=Chambers's Encyclopaedia: A Dictionary of Universal Knowledge for the People|date=10 April 1868|publisher=W. and R. Chambers|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===William Ensign Lincoln &amp; Milton Bradley's Zoetrope (1865–1867)===
[[File:1867-04 lincoln patent US64117-0R.jpg|thumb|W.E. Lincoln's U.S. Patent No. 64,117 of Apr. 23, 1867]]
William Ensign Lincoln invented the definitive zoetrope in 1865 when he was circa 18 years old and a sophomore at [[Brown University]], Providence, Rhode Island. Lincoln's patented version had the viewing slits on a level ''above'' the pictures, which allowed the use of easily replaceable strips of images. It also had an illustrated paper disc on the base, which was not always exploited on the commercially produced versions. On advice of a local bookstore owner, Lincoln sent a model to color lithographers and board game manufacturers [[Milton Bradley Company|Milton Bradley and Co.]]&lt;ref name="Herbert1" /&gt; Some shop owners advertised the zoetrope in American newspapers in December 1866.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Indianapolis Daily Journal |date=December 3, 1866}}&lt;/ref&gt; The instrument was first patented in the U.K. on 6 March 1867 under no. 629 by Henry Watson Hallett (as a communication to him by Milton Bradley).&lt;ref name="Herbert1" /&gt; In the United States it was patented as the ''Zoëtrope'' on April 23, 1867 by William E. Lincoln – as an assignor to Milton Bradley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/pdfs/US64117.pdf |title=Toy patent |website=docs.google.com |date=1867 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the years Milton Bradley released at least seven numbered series with twelve zoetrope strips each, as well as a set of twelve strips by Professor [[Robert Hallowell Richards]] showing the gradual transformations from one [[Cubic crystal system|isometric]] form to another,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/catalogueofgames00milt#page/44/mode/2up|title=Bradley's Game and Toy Catalogue. 1889-90}}&lt;/ref&gt; and one separately available strip showing the progress of the [[Grecian bend]] (a woman morphing into a camel).&lt;ref name="Herbert1" /&gt; The London Stereoscopic &amp; Photographic Company was licensed as the British publisher and repeated most of the Milton Bradley animations, while adding a set of twelve animations by famous British illustrator [[George Cruikshank]] in 1870.&lt;ref name=Herbert2/&gt;

===James Clerk Maxwell's improved zoetrope===
In 1868 [[James Clerk Maxwell]] had an improved zoetrope constructed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=fe88AAAAIAAJ&amp;lpg=PR27&amp;dq=1864+zoetrope&amp;pg=PA444#v=onepage&amp;q=%22wheel+of+life%22&amp;f=false|title=The Scientific Letters and Papers of James Clerk Maxwell:|first=James Clerk|last=Maxwell|date=18 May 1995|publisher=CUP Archive|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of slits it used concave lenses with a focal length equaling the diameter of the cylinder. The virtual image was thus seen in the centre and appeared much more sharp and steady than in the original zoetrope. Maxwell drew several strips that mostly demonstrated subjects relating to physics, like the vibrations of a harp string or [[Helmholtz]]'s vortex rings threading through each other. An article about the "Zootrope perfectionné" was published in French scientific magazine ''Le Cosmos'' in 1869,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=c8YWAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=%22le+cosmos%22+%22volume+20%22&amp;pg=PA585#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Le Cosmos; revue des sciences et de leurs applications|date=10 April 1869|publisher=|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the device was never marketed. Maxwell's original zoetrope and some strips are kept in the collection of the Cavendish Museum in Cambridge.

==Linear zoetropes==
A linear zoetrope consists of an opaque linear screen with thin vertical slits in it. Behind each slit is an image, often illuminated. A motion picture is seen by moving past the display.

Linear zoetropes have several differences compared to cylindrical zoetropes due to their different geometries. Linear zoetropes can have arbitrarily long animations and can cause images to appear wider than their actual sizes.

===Subway zoetropes===

====Japan====

Linear zoetrope-like advertising was in use in Japan in the early 1990s, for example on the line between the Narita airport and central Tokyo.

====United States====
[[File:Masstransiscope vc.ogv|thumb|The ''Masstransiscope'' artwork]]

In September 1980, independent filmmaker [[Bill Brand (film artist)|Bill Brand]] installed a type of linear zoetrope he called the [[Bill Brand (film artist)#Masstransiscope|"Masstransiscope"]] in an unused subway platform at the former [[Myrtle Avenue (BMT Fourth Avenue Line)|Myrtle Avenue]] station on the [[New York City Subway]]. It consists of a wall with 228&amp;nbsp;slits; behind each slit is a hand-painted panel, and riders of passing trains see a motion picture. After falling into a state of disrepair, the "Masstransiscope" was restored in late 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bboptics.com/masstransiscope.html|title=Masstransiscope by Bill Brand|publisher=|accessdate=20 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, a variety of artists and advertisers have begun to use subway tunnel walls to produce a zoetrope effect when viewed from moving trains.

Joshua Spodek, as an astrophysics graduate student, conceived of and led the development of a class of linear zoetropes that saw the zoetrope's first commercial success in over a century. A display of his design debuted in September 2001 in the [[MARTA|Atlanta subway system]] tunnel and showed an advertisement to riders moving past. The display is internally lit and nearly {{convert|980|ft|m}} long, with an animation lasting around 20&amp;nbsp;seconds. His design soon appeared, both commercially and artistically, in subway systems around North America, Asia, and Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.urbanphoto.net/blog/2010/11/20/tunnel-vision-subway-zoetrope/|title=URBANPHOTO: Cities / People / Place » Tunnel Vision: Subway Zoetrope|work=URBANPHOTO: Cities / People / Place|accessdate=20 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2006, the [[Washington Metro]] installed advertisement zoetropes between the [[Metro Center (Washington Metro)|Metro Center]] and [[Gallery Place (WMATA station)|Gallery Place]] subway stations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nbc4.com/news/8457121/detail.html "Metro begins testing new tunnel ads"], NBC4, April 4, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; A similar advertisement was installed on the [[Port Authority Trans-Hudson|PATH]] train in New Jersey, between the [[World Trade Center (PATH station)|World Trade Center]] and [[Exchange Place (PATH station)|Exchange Place]] stations.

At around the same time, the [[San Francisco]] [[Bay Area Rapid Transit]] (BART) system installed a zoetrope-type advertisement between the Embarcadero and Montgomery stations which could be viewed by commuters traveling in either direction. The BART ads are still visible, though they are changed infrequently: a particular ad may remain up for several months before being replaced.

The New York City Subway hosted two digital linear zoetropes through its Arts for Transit program. One, "Bryant Park in Motion", was installed in 2010 at the [[42nd Street – Bryant Park / Fifth Avenue (New York City Subway)|Bryant Park]] subway station, and was created by Spodek and students at [[New York University]]'s [[Tisch School of Arts]]' Interactive Telecommunications Program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://joshuaspodek.com/public_art|title=Public Art|work=Joshua Spodek|accessdate=20 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other, "Union Square in Motion", was installed in 2011 by Spodek and students and alumni from [[Parsons the New School for Design]]'s Art, Media, and Technology program in the [[14th Street – Union Square (New York City Subway)|Union Square]] station.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://joshuaspodek.com/union-square-display-beautiful|title=Union Square display just up and beautiful!|work=Joshua Spodek|accessdate=20 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other places====
The [[Kiev Metro]] (in [[Kiev]], [[Ukraine]]) also featured an advertisement about 2008 for Life mobile telephone carrier in one of its subway tunnels that featured the zoetrope effect. It was quickly taken down.

In [[Mexico City]], [[Mexico]], an advertisement for the [[Honda Civic]] featuring a zoetrope effect was placed in one of the [[Mexico City Metro Line 2|Line 2]]  tunnels.

The [[Zurich Airport]] [[Skymetro]] features a linear zoetrope.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvwL5i9d9-Y|title=Zürich Airport Tram and that Swiss babe...HD|first=|last=FuryFeatherFun|date=9 January 2011|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==3D zoetropes==
[[File:Murey.jpg|thumb|Murey|Marey's 1887 zoetrope with ten sculptures of different phases of the flight of a gull]]
3D zoetropes apply the same principle to three-dimensional models. This variation was suggested by several inventors including [[Étienne-Jules Marey]], who in 1887 used a large zoetrope to animate a series of plaster models based on his [[chronophotography|chronophotographs]] of birds in flight.&lt;ref name="Herbert2"&gt;Herbert, Stephen. (n.d.) [http://www.stephenherbert.co.uk/wheelZOETROPEpart2.htm ''From Daedaleum to Zoetrope'', Part 2.] Retrieved 2014-05-31.&lt;/ref&gt; Modern equivalents normally dispense with the slitted drum and instead use a rapidly flashing [[strobe light]] to illuminate the models, producing much clearer and sharper distortion-free results. The models are mounted on a rotating base and the light flashes on and off within an extremely small fraction of a second as each successive model passes the same spot. The [[stroboscopic effect]] makes each seem to be a single animated object. By allowing the rotation speed to be slightly out of synchronization with the strobe, the animated objects can be made to appear to also move slowly forwards or backwards, according to how much faster or slower each rotation is than the corresponding series of strobe flashes.

===Ghibli===
The [[Ghibli Museum]] in Tokyo, Japan hosts a 3D zoetrope featuring characters from the animated movie ''[[My Neighbour Totoro]].'' The zoetrope is accompanied by an explanatory display, and is part of an exhibit explaining the principles of animation and historical devices.

===''Toy Story''===
[[File:Toy Story Zoetrope, Disney California Adventure 2.jpg|thumb|''[[Toy Story]]'' zoetrope at [[Disney California Adventure]] creates illusion of motion using figures, rather than static pictures.]]
[[Pixar]] created a 3D zoetrope inspired by [[Studio Ghibli|Ghibli]]'s for its touring exhibition, which first showed at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] and features characters from ''[[Toy Story]]''. Two more 3D zoetropes have been created by Pixar, both featuring 360-degree viewing. One was installed at [[Disney California Adventure]], sister park to [[Disneyland]], but has since been moved to The [[Walt Disney Studios (Burbank)|Walt Disney Studios]] Lot in Burbank, CA. The other is installed at [[Hong Kong Disneyland]]. The original ''Toy Story'' zoetrope still travels worldwide and has been shown in: [[London]], England, [[Edinburgh]], [[Melbourne]], [[Seoul]], [[Helsinki]], [[Monterrey]], [[Taipei]], [[Kaohsiung]] (Taiwan), [[Singapore]]; [[Shanghai]], [[Hamburg]] and [[Amsterdam]].

===All Things Fall===
This zoetrope is created by the British artist Mat Collishaw and is inspired by a painting by [[Scarsellino|Ippolito Scarsella]] of The Massacre of Innocents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.factum-arte.com/pag/636/All-things-fall|title=Factum Arte :: All things Fall|author=Factum Arte, S.L.|publisher=|accessdate=20 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work, named "All things Fall", presented during the solo exhibition "Black Mirror" at [[Galleria Borghese]] in [[Rome]] is made of steel, aluminium, plaster, resin, lit by [[LED lamp|LED lights]] and powered by an electric motor. Of his work, Collishaw says: "The zoetrope literally repeats characters to create an overwhelming orgy of violence that is simultaneously appalling and compelling." It was originally designed in three dimensions. Each model figure was 3D printed in [[Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene|ABS]] printing. The ABS material is a special strong plastic used in this additive prototype systems called [[Fused deposition modeling|FDM]].

===Peter Hudson===
Over the period 2002–2016, Peter Hudson and the makers at Spin Art, LLC, have created multiple [[interactive]] 3D stroboscopic zoetrope art [[installation art|installations]]. This began with "Sisyphish" (2002),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hudzo.com/?p=58 |title=Peter Hudson Zoetrope Video and News |publisher=Hudzo.com |date=2008-01-26 |accessdate=2013-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; a human powered zoetrope that used [[strobe light]] to animate human figures swimming on a large rotating disk. Sisyphish, sometimes called the Playa Swimmers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hobbs|first1=Jess|title=Support Peter Hudson’s Charon|journal=Voices of Burning Man|url=http://blog.burningman.com/2011/04/culture-art-music/support-peter-hudsons-charon/|accessdate=April 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  was originally unveiled at the arts and culture event, [[Burning Man]], in the [[Black Rock Desert]] of [[Nevada]].

==Giant Zoetropes==
A "Great Zoetrope" with "life-size figures" turned by a gas engine was installed in [[the Crystal Palace]] in London at least from late 1867 to spring 1868.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stephenherbert.co.uk/wheelZOETROPEpart2.htm#fn48|title=ZOETROPE 2|website=www.stephenherbert.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sony BRAVIA-drome.jpg|thumb|The BRAVIA-drome at [[Venaria]], in Northern [[Italy]]]]
In 2008, Artem Limited, a UK visual effects house, built a 10-meter wide, 10-metric ton zoetrope for Sony, called the [[BRAVIA]]-drome, to promote Sony's [[motion interpolation]] technology. It features 64&amp;nbsp;images of the Brazilian footballer [[Kaká]]. This has been declared the largest zoetrope in the world by ''[[Guinness World Records]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Murph |first=Darren |url=http://www.engadgethd.com/2008/12/21/sony-sets-guinness-world-record-with-bravia-drome |title=Sony sets Guinness World Record with BRAVIA-drome |publisher=Engadgethd.com |date=2008-12-21 |accessdate=2009-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Sony Creates World's Largest Zoetrope |work=PopSci.com.au |date=2009-02-18 |url=http://www.popsci.com.au/entertainment-amp-gaming/article/2009-02/sony-creates-world%E2%80%99s-largest-zoetrope |accessdate=2009-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Successors==
Émile Reynaud's 1877 [[praxinoscope]] was an improvement on the zoetrope that became popular toward the end of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Dulac |first=Nicolas |author2=André Gaudreault  |year=2004 |url=http://www.rochester.edu/in_visible_culture/Issue_8/dulac_gaudreault.html |title=Heads or Tails: The Emergence of a New Cultural Series, from the Phenakisticope to the Cinematograph |work=Invisible Culture: A Journal for Visual Culture |publisher=The University of Rochester |accessdate=2006-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; It replaced the zoetrope's narrow viewing slits with an inner circle of mirrors that intermittently reflected the images.

Soon after the zoetrope became popular, the [[flip book]] was introduced in 1868. With its simplicity and compactness, along with its more tactile qualities, the flip book has stayed relatively popular. A disadvantage of the flip book can be seen in the fact that the animation stops rather quickly, while the zoetrope can display animation as a continuous loop.

[[Eadward Muybridge]] published his first [[chronophotography]] pictures in 1878. These sequential pictures were soon mounted in zoetropes by several people (including Muybridge himself) and were also published as strips for the zoetrope in the 1880s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stephenherbert.co.uk/muybZOETROPES.htm|title=COMPLEAT EADWEARD MUYBRIDGE - ZOETROPES|website=www.stephenherbert.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; This paved the way for the development of motion pictures. Muybridge's own [[Zoopraxiscope]] (1879) was an early moving image projector and one of several inventions made before the breakthrough in 1895.

In 1895 [[Auguste and Louis Lumière]] were developing the [[Kinora]] simultaneously with the [[cinematograph]]. While [[film|cinema]] proved to be an enormous success, the Kinora became a popular motion picture viewer for home use.

Film, [[television]] and [[video]] are seen as the prevailing successors of the zoetrope, when regarded as technological steps in the development of motion pictures.

[[GIF]] animation can arguably be seen as the closest contemporary successor of Zoetrope animation, since both usually show looped image sequences. However, the option of manipulating the speed of the animation is hardly ever present with GIFs.

==Contemporary media uses==
Since the late 20th century, zoetropes have seen occasional use for artwork, entertainment, marketing and other media use, notably as linear zoetropes and 3D zoetropes (see above).

Making a zoetrope has also become a relatively common arts and crafts assignment and a means to explain some of the technical and optical principles of film and motion viewing in educational programs.

The American company Optical Toys, in Vermont, publishes a paper zoetrope reproduction that was originally published as a newspaper supplement in 1896 in the Boston Herald.

===In popular culture===
[[Blue Man Group]] uses a zoetrope at their shows in Las Vegas and the Sharp Aquos Theater in Universal Studios (in Orlando, Florida).

The 1999 film ''[[House on Haunted Hill (1999 film)|House on Haunted Hill]]'' uses a man-sized zoetrope chamber as a twisted horror theme.

A zoetrope was used in the filming of the [[music video]] for "My Last Serenade" from ''[[Alive or Just Breathing]]'' (2002) by [[Killswitch Engage]]. It features a woman looking through the slits on a zoetrope while it moves; as she looks closer, the camera moves through the slits into the zoetrope, where the band is playing the song.

In 2007, an image of a zoetrope was unveiled as one of [[BBC Two]]'s new idents: a futuristic city with flying cars seen through the shape of the number two.

In 2009 the E4 drama program ''[[Skins (TV series)|Skins]]'' released silent preview clips of series four to coincide with their mash-up competition. One of the clips featured the character Emily Fitch looking into a zoetrope.

In 2011, [[Scott Blake]] created a "[[September 11 attacks|9/11]] Zoetrope" allowing viewers to watch a continuous reenactment of [[United Airlines Flight 175]] crashing into the [[Two World Trade Center|South Tower]] of the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://nymag.com/news/9-11/10th-anniversary/collected-works/ The Collected Works: How artists, writers, musicians, filmmakers, video-game designers, and quilters responded to the attacks of 9/11] – ''[[New York Magazine]]'', Published August 27, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 animation studio Sehsucht, Berlin created the opener to the 2012 [[MTV Europe Music Awards]]. The [[CGI animation]] features a 3D zoetrope that shows a story of the American Dream. The animation followed the lives of Roxxy and Seth, who, through social media and popularity reach the height of their success playing at the EMA's atop the zoetrope carousel. It was directed by Mate Steinforth and produced by Christina Geller&lt;ref&gt;[http://christinageller.com/animation-producer/zoetrope-animation-mtv-ema-opener-2012/ Zoetrope Animation – MTV EMA Opener 2012 | Sehsucht]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, director [[Jeff Zwart]] created a two-minute film, "Forza/Filmspeed", promoting [[Forza Motorsport 5]]. The production placed high resolution still images from the game on panels around [[Barber Motorsports Park]] and filmed them from a camera attached to a [[McLaren MP4-12C]] sports car.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5fiJ49-o_8|title=Forza Motorsport 5: FilmSpeed [ESPN TV Commercial] Official Ad|date=19 September 2013|work=YouTube|accessdate=20 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fastcocreate.com/3017831/how-the-worlds-fastest-camera-was-created-for-forza-motorsport-5|title=How The World's Fastest Camera Was Created for Forza Motorsport 5|work=Co.Create|accessdate=20 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autoweek.com/article/20130920/CARNEWS01/130929974|title='Forza Motorsport 5' goes meta in new TV spot|publisher=|accessdate=20 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2016 horror film ''[[The Conjuring 2]]'', there is the usage of a zoetrope in one of the scenes.
