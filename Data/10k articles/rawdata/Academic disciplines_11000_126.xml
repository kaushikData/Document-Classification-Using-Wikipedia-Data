'''African Centre for Technology Studies''' (ACTS) is an intergovernmental non-profit organization, founded in 1988 by [[Calestous Juma]]  {{post-nominals|country=GBR|FRS|commas=true}}&lt;ref name="Juma_Harvard_2012" /&gt; in Nairobi, Kenya, promoting policy-oriented research on science and technology in development that is sustainable in terms of the economy, society, and the environment.&lt;ref name="who_when" /&gt; It was the first African non-profit organization to combine policy research, science and technology.&lt;ref name="Juma_Harvard_2012" /&gt;{{rp|6}}

==History==
Founded in 1988, ACTS was a pioneer in development research on innovative development policies related to applied science, technology, and innovation.&lt;ref name="who_when" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Juma_Harvard_2012" /&gt;

ACTS research influenced policies on industrial property legislation and policy in Kenya, environmental impact assessment standards in Eastern and Southern Africa,  [[biofuels]] and [[bio-energy]] in Kenya, Eastern and West Africa. ACTS has also influenced policies across Africa on issues such as [[climate change adaptation]] and [[climate change mitigation|mitigation]], agriculture, biotechnology, [[biodiplomacy]], and [[biosafety]].&lt;ref name="who_when" /&gt;

==Affiliations==
ACTS is a member of the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development Data (GPSDD),  which includes 150 data producers and users working towards sustainable development focusing on data that informs research ending extreme poverty and addressing climate change. The Canadian, Colombian, French, Ghanaian, Italian, Mexican, Moroccan, Nigerian, Philippine, Senagalese, United Kingdom and United States' governments are member-states of the network.&lt;ref name="sustainabledevelopment_UN"&gt;{{citation |url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/partnership/?p=9691 |title=Global Partnership for Sustainable Development Data |publisher=United Nations |date=2016 |accessdate=December 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
In 2013, ACTS was named as one of the top Environment Think Tanks globally.&lt;ref name="who_when" /&gt; In 1991 the Council for the Development of Social Science Research in Africa ([[CODESRIA]]) honored ACTS for its contribution to expanding the knowledge base for development in Africa with the Justinian Rweyemamu Prize, named after Tanzania’s first major economics scholar, [[Justinian Rweyemamu]].&lt;ref name="who_when" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Juma_Harvard_2012" /&gt;{{rp|6}}

==Community-based actions==
ACTS policy researchers engage with local communities to encourage communities to reflect on and learn from their own coping mechanisms when faced with flood-prone areas. They then choose best practice adaptations and develop long-term proactive strategies for flood mitigation which might include crop diversification.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://cdkn.org/resource/in-conversation-with-elvin-nyukuri-african-centre-for-technology-studies-2/?loclang=en_gb |title=In conversation with… Elvin Nyukuri, African Centre for Technology Studies |publisher=African Centre for Technology Studies |date=May 16, 2011 |accessdate=January 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Selected publications==
ACTS published the groundbreaking study by Harvard professor, Calestous Juma&lt;ref name="List of Fellows"&gt;{{cite web|title=List of Fellows|url=http://www.raeng.org.uk/about-us/people-council-committees/the-fellowship/list-of-fellows}}&lt;/ref&gt; and J.

In his 1993 article, in which he examined legal processes regarding access and tenurial issues in regards to group and individual pastoral natural resource management in Turkana in Kenya, focusing on tree rights, Edmund G.C. Barrow made a case for indigenous property rights.&lt;ref name="Barrow_1993_Tree_rights"&gt;{{citation |publisher=Biopolicy International, African Centre for Technology Studies via Bioline International |number=8 |date=1993 |pages=1–23 |title=Tree Rights in Kenya: The Case of the Turkana (Part 1) |author=Edmund G.C.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11279">'''Alan F. Segal''' (August 2, 1945 – February 13, 2011) was a scholar of ancient religions, specializing in Judaism's relationship to Christianity. Segal was a distinguished scholar, author, and speaker, self-described as a "believing Jew and twentieth-century humanist."&lt;ref name="PaulConvert"&gt;{{cite book|last=Segal|first=Alan|title=Paul the Convert: The Apostolate and Apostasy of Paul the Convert|publisher=[[Yale University Press]]|location=Hew Haven|year=1990|isbn=9780300045277|page=281}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|281}} Segal was one of the first modern scholars to write extensively on the influences of Judaism (including [[Second Temple Judaism|Second Temple]] Rabbinic texts, [[Merkabah mysticism]], and [[Jewish eschatology|Jewish apocalypticism]]) on [[Paul the Apostle|Paul of Damascus]].

Segal was born in [[Worcester, Massachusetts]]. He attended [[Amherst College]] ([[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]], 1967), [[Brandeis University]] ([[Master of Arts|M.A.]], 1969), [[Hebrew Union College|Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion]] (Bachelor of Hebrew Letters, 1971), and [[Yale University]] (M.A., 1971; [[Master of Philosophy|M.Phil.]], 1973; and [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]], 1975). At the time of his retirement, Segal was Professor Emeritus of Religion and Ingeborg Rennert Professor Emeritus of Judaic Studies at [[Barnard College]] and held a concurrent appointment as Adjunct Professor of Scripture at Union Theological Seminary. He had also taught at Princeton University and the University of Toronto.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Professor Alan Fr. Segal Remembered|url=http://barnard.edu/headlines/professor-alan-f-segal-remembered|website=Barnard College|publisher=Faculty}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Segal was an expert in the field of history and religious traditions of Judaism and Christianity of the Roman period, and on the Semitic languages in use in Israel in that period. His scholarly reputation commenced with his landmark book, ''Two Powers in Heaven: Early Rabbinic Reports About Christianity and Gnosticism'' (1977), in which he explored early references in rabbinic texts that he proposed were directed against beliefs of Jewish Christians and gnostics. His 1986 book, ''Rebecca's Children'', was a sensitive study showing that rabbinic Judaism and early Christianity were sibling developments from the parent biblical tradition. His award-winning book, ''Paul the Convert'' (1990) was Editor's Choice and main selection of the History Book Club's summer 1990 list, and a selection of the Book of the Month Club. The 368 page text is a collection of studies that interprets Paul within the context of Jewish mysticism and history, providing unique depth and insight for Biblical exegetes and Jewish historians. His last book, ''Life After Death: A History of the Afterlife in Western Religion'' (2004) was a massive study of beliefs spanning from ancient near-eastern civilizations to the present and across various religious traditions. Life After Death is "considered one of the definitive treatments of that weighty subject — and was weighty in its own right, at 731 pages."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Levin|first1=Jay|title=Religious scholar Alan F. Segal, 65, of Ho-Ho-Kus|url=http://www.northjersey.com/obituaries/religious-scholar-alan-f-segal-65-of-ho-ho-kus-1.254299|website=northjersey.com/obituaries|publisher=The Record}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a selection of the History Book Club, the Book of the Month Club, and the Behaviorial Science Book Club. It also featured on the Leonard Lopate Show, Talk of the Nation, and was the cover story of the Globe and Mail Book Review Supplement (Toronto). In addition, he wrote numbers articles and chapters in scholarly books.

Segal gave conference presentations and lectures internationally. He was a founding member of the Society of Biblical Literature program unit on Early Jewish and Christian Mysticism, and the SBL program unit on Divine Mediators in Antiquity. In 1988, he was the first Jewish member of the Society for New Testament Studies to address the society. He was elected a member of the American Society for the Study of Religion and the first American living outside Canada to be elected President of the Canadian Society for Biblical Studies.

Until Segal's book ''Paul the Convert'' was published in 1990, most modern Biblical scholars failed to take into account the Jewishness of Paul and the vast majority of Jewish historians ignored Paul altogether because of his perceived anti-Semitic writing.&lt;ref name="PaulConvert" /&gt;{{rp|xi}} Segal argues in ''Paul the Convert'' that despite Paul's polemical rhetoric, the Jewish community must nevertheless consider the historical value of Paul's epistles because of the insights he provides into first century Hellenisic Judaism. 

Segal's exegetical concern is with the Jewish context of Paul's religious struggle following his conversion. He reads Paul's epistles in light of the social sciences, borrowing from modern sociological and psychological studies (especially those pertaining to conversion). He also examines Paul through the lens of Jewish Merkabah mysticism and the Rabbinic tradition – a pioneering method of study of the New Testament. Segal argues that in order to understand Paul thoroughly, one must understand the circumstances of his time and culture. Segal draws similarities between things like Paul's description of his conversion on the road to Damascus (2 Cor. 12:1-9) and Ezekiel and Enoch's heavenly ascent.&lt;ref name="PaulConvert" /&gt;{{rp|39–47}} He argues that Paul's emphasis on the Glory of God (Kavod) in these stories is characteristic of the Merkabah mystic tradition. The type of exegesis that Segal engages in provides a rare insight into first century thinking.

Segal understands Paul as part of Jewish history; he interprets Paul's conversion as an apostasy and a break from Judaism because of his insistence on transformation in Christ,&lt;ref name="PaulConvert" /&gt;{{rp|117}} although Paul never perceived his actions as outside the Jewish community (Acts 21:24). Paul, Segal argues, never felt that he had left Judaism, "He began as a Pharisee and became a convert from Pharisaism. He spent the rest of his life trying to express what he converted to. He never gave it a single name."&lt;ref name="PaulConvert" /&gt;{{rp|283}} Paul's conversion experience, Segal argues, forced him to re-evaluate his faith and understanding of the Torah; he was made to reconcile his revelation with his Pharasaism.

Segal was a frequent media commentator on St. Paul&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beliefnet.com/story/143/story_14384_1.html Do the Gospels Correct Paul's Letters? By Alan F.

'''Anthony van Stralen''' (1521 - [[Executed]], [[Vilvoorde]], 24 September 1568), [[Lord of Merksem]], Lord of Dambrugghe was a Mayor of [[Antwerp]]. Although he was Roman Catholic,he became a famous victim of the terror of the [[duke of Alva]].

== Family ==
He was the son of Goswin von Straelen, born in Cologne&lt;ref&gt;Correspondance du cardinal de Granvelle, 1565-1586, Volume 1&lt;/ref&gt; and Anna Draeck, Lady of Merksem. His grandfather was the major [[Willem Draeck, Lord of Merksem]]. His wife's sister, Mathilde, was married to [[Schetz|Melchior I Schetz]], lord of Rumpst and treasurer of Antwerp. He was related to Isabella van Stralen (1577-1660), known as Isabel de Jesús Christo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://resources.huygens.knaw.nl/vrouwenlexicon/lemmata/data/Stralen |title=Stralen, Isabella van (1577-1660) |publisher=Resources.huygens.knaw.nl |date=2014-01-13 |accessdate=2017-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
He became Lord of Merksem on 23 September 1561. Van Stralen was mayor of Antwerp from 1555 to 1557, in 1561 and in 1565. After the [[Beeldenstorm|Iconoclastic Fury]] he became a refugee in Germany. The [[Fernando Álvarez de Toledo, 3rd Duke of Alba|Duke of Alva]] ordered his arrest. He was a friend and correspondent of [[William the Silent]], and the Spanish government suspected him of treason. His letters were confiscated by the Count of Lodron.&lt;ref&gt;Antwerpsch archievenblad, Volumes 1-2&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1565 he acquired his main residence, ''Huysinge de Groote Robijn''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://inventaris.onroerenderfgoed.be/erfgoedobjecten/6133 |title=De Groote Robijn - Erfgoedobjecten - Inventaris Onroerend Erfgoed |publisher=Inventaris.onroerenderfgoed.be |date= |accessdate=2017-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his execution his complete fortune, 400,000 guilders and the lordship, were forfeited to the Spanish Crown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merksem.net/regio/geschiedenis/bestuur/jan_van_glimes_antoon_van_straalen.shtml |title=Antwerpen - Merksem - Geschiedenis - Antoon van Straele - Van Stralen - Van Strale |publisher=Merksem |date= |accessdate=2017-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Execution ==
The duke of Alba waited with his [[arrest]] until Horne was back in [[Brussels]]. Van Stralen never left Antwerpen, he was convinced that his contact with Oranje was official on request of the City. Lord van stralen was arrested in 1567 during a "fake" dinner with Don [[Ferdinand of alva|Ferdinand]], Alvas son.&lt;ref&gt;Behelzende de regering van Filip II tot aan de unie van Utrecht: 6 p 83&lt;/ref&gt; Alva ordered his arrest and Lord van stralen stood trial, after he was in 1568 extremely hard tortured with new methods, with permition of Alva.&lt;ref name="thomascook1"&gt;file://sw-pmiocc-dc110.ids.ads.thomascook.com/Users-PMIOCC$/T9900167/Downloads/BURG_ANTOON_VANSTRALEN.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The city of Antwerp protested his execution, in panic many merchands left the city in fear of the duke of Alva. An official delegation went to the duke to beg for the freedom of Lord van Stralen.&lt;ref name="thomascook1"/&gt; He was executed after a trial before the [[Council of Troubles]]. After being tortured he was beheaded on 24 September 1568 in [[Vilvoorde]], together with [[Jan van Casembroot|John of Casembroodt, Lord of Backerzele]], and Alfons de La Loi, secretary to the Count of Horne.

In 1885 a painting of him by [[Auguste Delfosse]] was hung in the mayor's office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://balat.kikirpa.be/photo.php?path=B059308&amp;objnr=110455&amp;nr=1 |title=Balat Kik-Irpa |publisher=Balat.kikirpa.be |date= |accessdate=2017-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Association of Information Technology Professionals''' ('''AITP''') is a [[Professional organization|professional association]] that focuses on [[information technology]] education for business professionals. The group is a non-profit [[United States|US]]-oriented group, but its activities are performed by 62 local chapters organized on a geographic basis,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Professional Chapter List|url=http://www.aitp.org/?page=Chptmap|work=AITP.org|accessdate=31 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 286 student chapters at college and universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Student Chapter List|url=http://www.aitp.org/?page=FindStuChap|work=AITP.org|accessdate=31 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The group was first organized in [[Chicago]], United States, in 1949, as the '''National Machine Accountants Association''' ('''NMAA''').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Johnson | first=Charles | title=Data Processing: 1958 Proceedings | year=1958 | publisher=National Machine Accountants Association | location=Paris, Illinois | page=412 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The State of Illinois granted the NMAA a charter on December 26, 1951. It soon had over 20 chapters. Harvey W. Protzel, systems manager for Protzel's Company, was elected the first International President at the 1952 First Annual Convention in [[Minneapolis]]. In 1962, it adopted the more inclusive name, '''Data Processing Management Association''' ('''DPMA'''), and in 1996, the present name.

The Association began its certification program with the Certificate in Data Processing (CDP) professional examination, first  held in 1962 in [[New York City]]. In 1970, it added  the Registered Business Programmer (RBP) examination. In 1974, the Association joined in establishing the [[Institute for the Certification of Computing Professionals|Institute for the Certification of Computer Professionals]] (ICCP) to administer the examination program and stimulate industry acceptance of the examinations. The certification is now called [[Certified Computing Professional]] (CCP)'''.

In 1969, the Association created the annual DPMA Man of the Year Award, awarding it (incongruously, given its name) to [[Grace Hopper|Dr. Grace Murray Hopper]]. After Dr. Ruth Davis of the US [[National Bureau of Standards]] won the 1979 award,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aitp.org/?page=DISA DISA Award Winners], AITP.&lt;/ref&gt; it was renamed the Distinguished Information Sciences Award.

==Ethics==
The Association requires its members to abide by a [[code of ethics]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Code of Ethics &amp; Standards of Conduct|url=http://www.aitp.org/?page=EthicsConduct&amp;hhSearchTerms=%22ethics%22|work=AITP.org|accessdate=31 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; that has been in place for decades,  predating both the [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act|HIPAA]] and [[Sarbanes-Oxley]] legislation. The Association also requires members to operate by a ''"Standards of Conduct"'' for IT Professionals, which adds specifics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Code of Ethics - Standards of Conduct|url=http://www.aitp.org/resource/resmgr/forms/code_of_ethics.pdf|work=AITP.org|accessdate=31 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mars-human-exploration-art-astronauts-vehicle-dust-full.jpg|thumb|This space art, titled ''The Next Stop'' was selected by the ESA when discussing its Aurora program.&lt;ref name="esa.int"&gt;[http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Human_Spaceflight/Exploration/Liftoff_for_Aurora_Europe_s_first_steps_to_Mars_the_Moon_and_beyond]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The '''Aurora programme''' (sometimes called '''Aurora Exploration Programme''', or simply '''Exploration Programme''') is a [[human spaceflight]] [[List of human spaceflight programs|programme]] of the [[European Space Agency]] (ESA) established in 2001. The objective is to formulate and then to implement a European long-term plan for [[Space exploration|exploration]] of the [[Solar System]] using [[robotic spacecraft]] and [[human spaceflight]] to investigate bodies holding promise for traces of [[Astrobiology|life beyond the Earth]].&lt;ref name='Overview'&gt;
{{cite web | url = http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Human_Spaceflight/Exploration/The_European_Space_Exploration_Programme_Aurora| title = The European Space Exploration Programme Aurora | publisher = [[ESA]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.astrobio.net/topic/exploration/moon-to-mars/assessing-aurora/ |title=Assessing Aurora |work=Astrobiology Magazine |date=April 7, 2007 |accessdate=2015-04-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Member states commit to participation in the Aurora programme for five-year periods, after which they can change their level of participation or pull out entirely. In the early years the Aurora programme planned for flagship missions and arrow missions for key technology demonstrations, such as Earth re-entry vehicle/capsule and Mars aerocapture demonstrator. Although human spaceflight has remained a long-term goal of the programme, with some basic technology development in this area, the thrust has been on implementation of the [[ExoMars]] mission and preparations for an international [[Mars sample return mission]].&lt;ref name='Overview'/&gt;

{{quote|The objective of the Aurora Programme is first to formulate and then to implement a European long-term plan for the robotic and human exploration of solar system bodies holding promise for traces of life. |ESA&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Human_Spaceflight/Exploration/The_European_Space_Exploration_Programme_Aurora]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Aurora programme was a response to Europe's Strategy for space which  was endorsed by [[European Union Council of Research]] and the ESA Council.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Human_Spaceflight/Exploration/Aurora_s_origins]&lt;/ref&gt; Europe strategy for space had three main points including:"explore the solar system and the Universe", "stimulate new technology", and "inspire the young people of Europe to take a greater interest in science and technology".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; One of the foundational principles of the Aurora program is recognising the interdependence of technology and exploration;.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="esa.int"/&gt;

==Missions==
[[Image:ExoMars model at ILA 2006.jpg|thumb|ExoMars rover model (for the 2020 launch)]]
The first decade is planned to focus on [[robot]]ic missions.

===Flagship missions===
[[File:ExoMars 2016 Launch.jpg|thumb|ExoMars launches in 2016]]
ESA describes some Aurora programme missions as "Flagship" missions. The first Flagship mission is [[ExoMars]], a dual robotic mission to [[Mars]] made in cooperation with the [[Russian Federal Space Agency]] (Roskosmos). It will involve development of a Mars orbiter ([[ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter]]), a technology demonstrator [[lander (spacecraft)|descent module]] (Schiaparelli lander) and the [[ExoMars rover]].&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web | url = http://www.esa.int/SPECIALS/Aurora/SEM1NVZKQAD_0.html | title = ExoMars | publisher = ESA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Flagship missions considered for the Aurora programme include:
* ''[[ExoMars]]'', consisting of an uncrewed Mars orbiter and lander launched jointly with the [[Russian Federal Space Agency]] in 2016 on Proton rocket with Fregat upper stage.
* [[ExoMars rover]] launch to be conducted jointly the [[Russian Federal Space Agency]] in 2020
* a robotic ''[[Mars Sample Return Mission]]'' by the mid-2020s 
* a human space mission to be launched in the mid-2030s

===Arrow missions===
{{Update|date=November 2010}}
''Arrow missions'' are technology demonstrator missions focused on developing a certain technology needed for the Flagship missions. Approved Arrow missions so far (as of January 30, 2003):
*''Earth re-entry vehicle/capsule'', a step in the preparations for the ''Mars Sample Return'' mission.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}
*''Mars aerocapture demonstrator'', to further develop the technologies for using a planet's [[Celestial body atmosphere|atmosphere]] to brake into orbit. This particular mission seems to have been revised into an expanded mission to demonstrate "aerobraking/aerocapture, solar electric propulsion and soft landing" to be launched in 2020. {{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}

The proposed Aurora roadmap&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esa.int/esaCP/SEMXZY274OD_index_0.html |title=Aurora’s roadmap to Mars / Exploration / Human Spaceflight / Our Activities / ESA |publisher=[[European Space Agency]] |date=2003-12-19 |accessdate=2013-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; (as of September 30, 2005. This roadmap can, and most likely will, go through revisions):
* 2014 – Human mission technologies demonstrator(s) to validate technologies for orbital assembly and docking, life support and human habitation{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}
* 2016 and 2020 – [[ExoMars rover]] to Mars. The scientific objectives include exobiological studies as well as study of the surface of Mars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Case study ExoMars|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/case-studies/exomars|publisher=UK Government Space Agency|accessdate=17 June 2015|date=3 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 2024 – Human mission to the Moon{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}
* 2026 – Automatic mission to Mars{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}
* 2030s – First human mission to Mars, as a split mission. The proposed Ariane M rocket may be used for this landing.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}

The human part of the programme has been challenged by the main ESA contributors (France, Germany and Italy), making it quite possible that the whole Aurora Programme will be refocused on robotic-only exploration of Mars.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}

'''Barry Dean Kernfeld''' (born 11 August 1950, [[San Francisco]]), is a [[musicologist]] and jazz saxophonist who has researched and published extensively about the history of jazz and the biographies of its musicians.&lt;ref&gt;''Contemporary Authors, New Revision Series'', Vol. 135, [[Thomson Gale]] [[Detroit]] (2005) {{OCLC|6921683}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Contemporary Authors'', Vol. 161, [[Gale Research]], [[Detroit]] (1998) {{OCLC|6921683}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Writers Directory,'' [[St. James Press]], [[Detroit]] {{OCLC|1776757}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''International Who's Who in Music and Musicians' Directory; 12th edition, 1990–1991,'' [[International Who's Who in Music]], [[Cambridge, England]] (1990) {{OCLC|632053332}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Who's Who in America, 60th edition, 2006,'' [[Marquis Who's Who]], [[New Providence, NJ]] (2005) {{OCLC|62401678}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Editing and writing career ==
Kernfeld was the editor of the first and second editions of ''The New Grove Dictionary of Jazz,'' the largest jazz dictionary ever published. The first edition was published in 1988. ''Volume 1'' had 670 pages and ''Volume 2'' had 690.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephen Holden]], [https://www.nytimes.com/1988/11/23/arts/the-pop-life-205788.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm "The Pop Life: Jazz Facts and Figures",] ''[[New York Times]]'', November 23, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[John S. Wilson (music critic)|John S. Wilson]], [https://www.nytimes.com/1988/12/30/books/books-of-the-times-updating-the-minutiae-of-a-truly-american-sound.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm "Books of The Times; Updating the Minutiae of a Truly American Sound",] ''New York Times'', December 30, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, Kernfeld initiated a long-term project, transcribing and editing the contents of the [http://www.smithsonianjazz.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=22&amp;Itemid=28 Smithsonian Jazz Oral History Program]. A number of lengthy interviews are now available at the institution's website. Also in 2005, Kernfeld became a staff archivist in the [https://archive.is/20121211071535/http://www.libraries.psu.edu/psul/speccolls/hcla.html Historical Collections and Labor Archives within Special Collections] at the [[Pennsylvania State University]] library. In 2012, he taught a writing course at [[Penn State]], "American Jazz Masters in their Own Words."

Kernfeld spent a decade researching pop [[Copyright infringement|song piracy]] which culminated him publishing two books, one about [[fake books]] (2006) and the other a general survey (2011). (see book listings below)

== Post-baccalaureate academic education ==
In 1968, Kernfeld enrolled at [[University of California, Berkeley]]; then, from April 1970 to September 1972, he focused on being a professional saxophonist.  In October 1972, Kernfeld enrolled at the [[University of California, Davis]], where, in 1975, he earned a Bachelor of Arts in [[musicology]].  From 1975 to 1981, he studied at [[Cornell University]] where he focused on jazz.  Cornell awarded him a master's degree in 1978 and a Doctor of Philosophy degree 1981.

A '''camera trap''' is a remotely activated [[camera]] that is equipped with a [[motion sensor]] or an [[infrared sensor]], or uses a light beam as a [[Image trigger|trigger]]. Camera trapping is a method for capturing wild [[animal]]s on film when researchers are not present, and has been used in ecological research for decades. In addition to applications in [[hunting]] and [[wildlife]] viewing, research applications include studies of nest [[ecology]], detection of rare species, estimation of population size and species richness, as well as research on habitat use and occupation of human-built structures.&lt;ref name="swann10"&gt;{{cite book |author=Swann, D. E., Kawanishi, K., Palmer, J. |year=2010 |chapter=Evaluating Types and Features of Camera Traps in Ecological Studies: A Guide for Researchers |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=onO2967GdPwC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA27#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false  |pages=27–43 |title=Camera Traps in Animal Ecology: Methods and Analyses |editor1-last=O'Connell |editor1-first=A.

Camera traps, also known as [[trail camera]]s, are used to capture images of wildlife with as little human interference as possible.&lt;ref name=CT1&gt;{{cite web |title=WWF - Camera Traps - More on Camera Traps |url=http://www.worldwildlife.org/species/camera-traps/moreoncameratraps.html |work=World Wildlife Fund - Wildlife Conservation, Endangered Species Conservation|publisher=World Wildlife Fund |accessdate=4 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the introduction of commercial infrared-triggered cameras in the early 1990s their use has increased.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Camera Trapping |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JT2nBQAAQBAJ|editor1=Meek, P. |editor2=Fleming, P. |publisher=CSIRO Publishing |year=2014 |isbn=9781486300396}}&lt;/ref&gt; With advancements in the quality of camera equipment this method of field observation has become more popular among researchers.&lt;ref name=CT2&gt;{{cite web|title=Camera Traps for Researchers, Camera Trap Reviews and Tests.|url=http://www.trailcampro.com/cameratrapsforresearchers.aspx|work=Trail Cameras, Game Cameras Tests and Unbiased Reviews of Camera Traps|accessdate=4 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hunting has played an important role in development of camera traps, since hunters like to use them to scout for game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jiao|first1=H. |title=Wireless Trail Cameras|url=http://www.trailcameralab.com/#Wireless_Trail_Cameras|website=Trail Camera Lab|accessdate=11 April 2017|date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; These hunters have opened a commercial market for the devices which have led to many improvements over time.

==Application==
The great advantage of camera traps is that they can record very accurate data without disturbing the photographed animal. These data are superior to human observations, because they can be reviewed by other researchers.&lt;ref name="swann10"/&gt; 
They minimally disturb wildlife and can replace the use of more invasive survey and monitoring techniques such as live trap and release. They operate continually and silently, provide proof of species presence in an area, can reveal what prints and scats belong to which species, provide evidence for management and policy decisions, and are a cost effective monitoring tool. Infrared flash cameras have low disturbance and visibility.&lt;ref name=Cronin&gt;{{cite journal |year=2010 |author=Cronin, S. |title=Camera trap talk |url=http://www.lps.org.au/camera%20traps.pdf |publisher=Photographic Society, April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303225033/http://www.lps.org.au/camera%20traps.pdf |archivedate=2012-03-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides [[olfactory]] and acoustic cues, camera [[Flash (photography)|flash]] may scare animals so that they avoid or destroy camera traps. The major alternative light source is infrared, which is usually not detectable by [[mammal]]s or [[bird]]s.&lt;ref name="swann10"/&gt;

Camera traps are also helpful in quantifying the number of different species in an area; this is a more effective method than attempting to count by hand every individual organism in a field. It can also be useful in identifying new or rare species that have yet to be well documented. By using camera traps, the well-being and survival rate of animals can be observed over time.&lt;ref name=CMT4&gt;{{cite web|title=A-Z Animal Index|url=http://siwild.si.edu/index.cfm?species=155|work=Smithsonian Wild|publisher=Smithsonian|accessdate=29 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Camera traps are helpful in determining behavioral and activity patterns of animals, such as which time of day they visit [[mineral lick]]s.&lt;ref name=Blake2010&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Blake, J.

Camera traps are also useful to record animal migrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = How a Photographer Captured Stunning Wildlife Photos|url = http://video.nationalgeographic.com/video/ng-adventure/150715-riis-camera-trap|website = video.nationalgeographic.com|accessdate = 2015-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Camera traps have revolutionized wildlife research and conservation, enabling collection of photographic evidence of rarely seen and often globally [[endangered species]], with little expense, relative ease, and minimal disturbance to wildlife. Camera traps can document wildlife presence, abundance, and population changes, particularly in the face of deforestation and habitat destruction. Camera traps  enable collection of baseline population data on elusive mammals and birds where only estimates — and often just guesses — were possible before. Camera traps are increasingly being used to raise conservation awareness worldwide, with [[Non-governmental organization]]s (NGO)s embracing the tool as a powerful way of reaching out to the public through electronic media. Wildlife conservation groups such as [[Panthera]], [[Wildlife Conservation Society]] (WCS), [[World Wildlife Fund]] (WWF) have found camera trap videos and photos to be an important part of campaigns to save threatened or endangered species.&lt;ref name=TM&gt;{{cite journal |title=Camera Traps Emerge as Key Tool in Wildlife Research |journal=Yale Environment 360 |author=Hance, J. |url=http://e360.yale.edu/feature/camera_traps_emerge_as_key_tool_in_wildlife_research/2469/ |publisher=Yale University |year=2011 |location=New Haven}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Camera types==
The earliest models used traditional film and a one-shot trigger function. These cameras contained film that needed to be collected and developed like any other standard camera. Today, more advanced cameras utilize [[digital photography]], sending photos directly to a [[computer]]. Even though this method is uncommon it is highly useful and could be the future of this research method. Some cameras are even programmed to take multiple pictures after a triggering event.&lt;ref name=OConnell2010&gt;{{cite book |author=O'Connell, A. F., Nichols, J. D., Karanth, U. K. (Eds.) |title=Camera Traps in Ecology: Methods and Analyses|year=2010 |publisher=Springer |location=Tokyo, Dordrecht, London, Heidelberg, New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are non-triggered cameras that either run continuously or take pictures at specific time intervals. The more common ones are the advanced cameras that are triggered only after sensing movement and/or a heat signature to increase the chances of capturing a useful image. Infrared beams can also be used to trigger the camera. [[Video]] is also an emerging option in camera traps, allowing researchers to record running streams of video and to document animal behavior.

The battery life of some of these cameras is another important factor in which cameras are used; large batteries offer a longer running time for the camera but can be cumbersome in set up or when lugging the equipment to the field site .&lt;ref name=CMT4/&gt;

===Extra features===
Weather proof and waterproof housing for camera traps protect the equipment from damage and disguise the equipment from animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Griffiths, M. |author2=van Schaik, C. P. |title=Camera-trapping: a new tool for the study of elusive rain forest animals|journal=Tropical Biodiversity|year=1993|volume=1|pages=131–135}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Noise-reduction housing limits the possibility of disturbing and scaring away animals. Sound recording is another feature that can be added to the camera to record animal calls and times when specific animals are the most vocal.&lt;ref name=CT1/&gt;

==Effects of weather and the environment==
[[Humidity]] has a highly negative effect on camera traps and can result in camera malfunction.
This can be problematic since the malfunction is often not immediately discovered, so a large portion of research time can be lost.&lt;ref name=Cronin/&gt; Often a researcher expecting the experiment to be complete will trek back to the site, only to discover far less data than expected – or even none at all.&lt;ref name=OConnell2010/&gt;

The best type of weather for it to work in is any place with low humidity and stable moderate temperatures.
There is also the possibility, if it is a motion activated camera, that any movement within the sensitivity range of the camera’s sensor will trigger a picture, so the camera might end up with numerous pictures of anything the wind moves, such as plants.

As far as problems with camera traps, it cannot be overlooked that sometimes the subjects themselves negatively affect the research. One of the most common things is that animals unknowingly topple a camera or splatter it with mud or water ruining the film or [[Lens (optics)|lens]]. One other method of animal tampering involves the animals themselves taking the cameras for their own uses. There are examples of some animals actually taking the cameras and snapping pictures of themselves.&lt;ref name=OConnell2010/&gt;

Local people sometimes use the same game trails as wildlife, and hence are also photographed by camera traps placed along these trails. This can make camera traps a useful tool for anti-poaching or other [[law enforcement]] effort.

==Placement techniques==
One of the most important things to consider when setting up camera traps is choosing the location in order to get the best results. Camera traps near mineral licks or along game trails, where it is more likely that animals will visit frequently, are normally seen. Animals congregate around mineral licks to consume water and soil, which can be useful in reducing toxin levels or supplement mineral intake in their [[Diet (nutrition)|diet]]. These locations for camera traps also allow for variety of animals who show up at different times and use the licks in different ways allowing for the study of [[ethology|animal behavior]].&lt;ref name=CMT4/&gt;

Another major factor in whether this is the best technique to use in the specific research is which type of species one is attempting to observe with the camera. Species such as small-bodied birds and insects may be too small to trigger the camera. Reptiles and amphibians will not be able to trip the infrared or heat differential-based sensors, however, methods have been developed to detect these species by utilizing a reflector based sensor system. However, for most medium and large-bodied [[Terrestrial animal|terrestrial]] [[Species (biology)|species]] camera traps have proven to be a successful tool for study.&lt;ref name=OConnell2010/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20897">'''Commonsense reasoning''' is one of the branches of [[artificial intelligence]] (AI) that is concerned with simulating the human ability to make presumptions about the type and essence of ordinary situations they encounter every day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine|last=|author1=Ernest Davis|author2=Gary Marcus|date=2015|title=Commonsense reasoning|url=http://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2015/9/191169-commonsense-reasoning-and-commonsense-knowledge-in-artificial-intelligence/fulltext|magazine=Communications of the ACM|publisher=|volume=58|pages=92–103|doi=10.1145/2701413|accessdate=|number=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; These assumptions include judgments about the physical properties, purpose, intentions and behavior of people and objects, as well as possible outcomes of their actions and interactions. A device that exhibits commonsense reasoning will be capable of predicting results and drawing conclusions that are similar to humans' [[folk psychology]] (humans' innate ability to reason about people's behavior and intentions) and [[naive physics]] (humans' natural understanding of the physical world).

== Commonsense knowledge ==
In Artificial intelligence, [[Commonsense knowledge (artificial intelligence)|commonsense knowledge]] is the set of background information that an individual is intended to know or assume and the ability to use it when appropriate. It is a shared knowledge (between everybody or people in a particular culture or age group only). The way to obtain commonsense is by learning it or experiencing it. In communication, it is what people don’t have to say because the interlocutor is expected to know or make a presumption about.

=== Commonsense knowledge problem ===
The commonsense knowledge problem is a current project in the sphere of artificial intelligence to create a database that contains the general knowledge most individuals are expected to have, represented in an accessible way to artificial intelligence programs&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.journals.elsevier.com/artificial-intelligence/|title = Artificial intelligence Programs|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; that use natural language. Due to the broad scope of the commonsense knowledge this issue is considered to be among the most difficult ones in the AI research&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-artificial-intelligence--cs271|title = Artificial intelligence applications|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; sphere. In order for any task to be done as a human mind would manage it, the machine is required to appear as intelligent as a human being. Such tasks include object recognition, machine translation and text mining. To perform them, the machine has to be aware of the same concepts that an individual, who possess commonsense knowledge, recognizes.

== Commonsense in intelligent tasks ==
In 1961, [[Yehoshua Bar-Hillel|Bar Hille]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;l first discussed the need and significance of practical knowledge for natural language processing in the context of machine translation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.theguardian.com/technology/artificialintelligenceai|title = Bar Hillel Artificial Intelligence Research Machine Translation|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some ambiguities are resolved by using simple and easy to acquire rules. Others require a broad acknowledgement of the surrounding world, thus they require more commonsense knowledge. For instance when a machine is used to translate a text, problems of ambiguity arise, which could be easily resolved by attaining a concrete and true understanding of the context. Online translators often resolve ambiguities using analogous or similar words. For example, in translating the sentences "The electrician is working" and "The telephone is working" into German, the machine translates correctly "working" in the means of "laboring" in the first one and as "functioning properly" in the second one. The machine has seen and read in the body of texts that the German words for "laboring" and "electrician" are frequently used in a combination and are found close together. The same applies for "telephone" and "function properly". However, the statistical proxy which works in simple cases often fails in complex ones. Existing computer programs carry out simple language tasks by manipulating short phrases or separate words, but they don’t attempt any deeper understanding and focus on short-term results.

=== Computer vision ===
[[File:Thyme-Bathroom-RGB.jpg|alt=Figure 1|thumb|Issues in computer vision&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = RANGES - The Bathroom Studio|url = http://www.thebathroomstudio.net/ranges/|website = www.thebathroomstudio.net|accessdate = 2015-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
]]
Issues of this kind arise in computer vision. For instance when looking at the photograph of the bathroom (figure 1) some of the items that are small and only partly seen, such as the towels or the body lotions, are recognizable due to the surrounding objects (toilet, wash basin, bathtub), which suggest the purpose of the room. In an isolated image they would be difficult to identify. Movies prove to be even more difficult tasks. Some movies contain scenes and moments that cannot be understood by simply matching memorized templates to images. For instance, to understand the context of the movie, the viewer is required to make inferences about characters’ intentions and make presumptions depending on their behavior. In the contemporary state of the art, it is impossible to build and manage a program that will perform such tasks as reasoning, i.e. predicting characters’ actions. The most that can be done is to identify basic actions and track characters.

=== Robotic manipulation ===
The need and importance of commonsense reasoning in [[autonomous robot]]s that work in a real-life uncontrolled environment is evident. For instance, if a robot is programmed to perform the tasks of a waiter on a cocktail party, and it sees that the glass he had picked up is broken, the waiter-robot should not pour liquid into the glass, but instead pick up another one. Such tasks seem obvious when an individual possess simple commonsense reasoning, but to ensure that a robot will avoid such mistakes is challenging.

== Successes in automated commonsense reasoning ==
Significant progress in the field of the automated commonsense reasoning is made in the areas of the taxonomic reasoning, actions and change reasoning, reasoning about time. Each of these spheres has a well-acknowledged theory for wide range of commonsense inferences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O11-commonsensereasoning.html|title = Taxonomy|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Taxonomic reasoning ===
Taxonomy is the collection of individuals and categories and their relations. Taxonomies are often referred to as semantic networks. Figure 2 displays a taxonomy of a few categories of individuals and animals.
[[File:Figure2ww.jpg|thumb|377x377px|Taxonomy
Figure 2&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = RANGES - The Bathroom Studio|url = http://www.thebathroomstudio.net/ranges/|website = www.thebathroomstudio.net|accessdate = 2015-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
]]

Three basic relations are demonstrated:
* An individual is an instance of a category. For example, the individual ''Tweety'' is an instance of the category ''robin''.
* One category is a subset of another. For instance ''robin'' is a subset of ''bird''.
* Two categories are disjoint. For instance ''robin'' is disjoint from ''penguin''.
Transitivity is one type of inference in taxonomy. Since ''Tweety'' is an instance of ''robin'' and ''robin'' is a subset of ''bird'', it follows that ''Tweety'' is an instance of ''bird''. Inheritance is another type of inference. Since ''Tweety'' is an instance of ''robin'', which is a subset of ''bird'' and ''bird'' is marked with property ''canfly'', it follows that ''Tweety'' and ''robin'' have property ''canfly''.  When an individual taxonomizes more abstract categories, outlining and delimiting specific categories becomes more problematic. Simple taxonomic structures are frequently used in AI programs. For instance, [[WordNet]] is a resource including a taxonomy, whose elements are meanings of English words. Web mining systems used to collect commonsense knowledge from Web documents focus on taxonomic relations and specifically in gathering taxonomic relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2015/9/191169-commonsense-reasoning-and-commonsense-knowledge-in-artificial-intelligence/fulltext#body-5|title = Taxonomy|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Action and change ===
The theory of action, events and change is another range of the commonsense reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/someneed/node3.html|title = Action and change in Commonsense reasoning|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are established reasoning methods for domains that satisfy the constraints listed below:
* Events are atomic, meaning one event occurs at a time and the reasoner needs to consider the state and condition of the world at the start and at the finale of the specific event, but not during the states, while there is still an evidence of on-going changes (progress).
* Every single change is a result of some event
* Events are deterministic, meaning the world’s state at the end of the event is defined by the world’s state at the beginning and the specification of the event.
* There is a single actor and all events are his actions.
* The relevant state of the world at the beginning is either known or can be calculated.

=== Temporal reasoning ===
Temporal reasoning is the ability to make presumptions about humans' knowledge of times, durations and time intervals. For example, if an individual knows that Mozart was born after Hadyn and died earlier than him, they can use their temporal reasoning knowledge to deduce that Mozart had died younger than Hadyn. The inferences involved reduce themselves to solving systems of linear inequalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www-formal.stanford.edu/leora/commonsense/|title = Temporal reasoning|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; To integrate that kind of reasoning with concrete purposes, such as [[natural language understanding|natural language interpretation]], is more challenging, because natural language expressions have context dependent interpretation. Simple tasks such as assigning timestamps to procedures cannot be done with total accuracy.

=== Qualitative reasoning ===
Qualitative reasoning&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://techcrunch.com/2014/08/09/guide-to-common-sense-reasoning-whos-doing-it-and-why-it-matters/|title = Qualitative reasoning|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; is the form of commonsense reasoning analyzed with certain success. It is concerned with the direction of change in interrelated quantities. For instance, if the price of a stock goes up, the amount of stocks that are going to be sold will go down. If some ecosystem contains wolves and lambs and the number of wolves decreases, the death rate of the lambs will go down as well. This theory was firstly formulated by Johan de Kleer, who analyzed an object moving on a roller coaster. The theory of qualitative reasoning is applied in many spheres such as physics, biology, engineering, ecology, etc. It serves as the basis for many practical programs, analogical mapping, text understanding.

== Challenges in automating commonsense reasoning ==
As of 2014, there are some commercial systems trying to make the use of commonsense reasoning significant. However, they use statistical information as a proxy for commonsense knowledge, where reasoning is absent. Current programs manipulate individual words, but they don't attempt or offer further understanding.  Five major obstacles interfere with the producing of a satisfactory "commonsense reasoner".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.edx.org/course/artificial-intelligence-uc-berkeleyx-cs188-1x|title = Artificial Challenges|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

First, some of the domains that are involved in commonsense reasoning are only partly understood. Individuals are far from a comprehensive understanding of domains as communication and knowledge, interpersonal interactions or physical processes.

Second, situations that seem easily predicted or assumed about could have logical complexity, which humans’ commonsense knowledge does not cover. Some aspects of similar situations are studied and are well understood, but there are many relations that are unknown, even in principle and how they could be represented in a form that is usable by computers.

Third, commonsense reasoning involves plausible reasoning. It requires coming to a reasonable conclusion given what is already known. Plausible reasoning has been studied for many years and there are a lot of theories developed that include probabilistic reasoning and non-monotonic logic. It takes different forms that include using unreliable data and rules, whose conclusions are not certain sometimes.

Fourth, there are many domains, in which a small number of examples are extremely frequent, whereas there is a vast number of highly infrequent examples.

Fifth, when formulating pressumptions it is challenging to discern and determine the level of abstraction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.aaai.org/home.html|title = Association Artificial Intelligence|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Compared with humans, all existing computer programs perform extremely poorly on modern "commonsense reasoning" benchmark tests such as the [[Winograd Schema Challenge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Winograd Schema Challenge|url=https://cs.nyu.edu/faculty/davise/papers/WinogradSchemas/WS.html|website=cs.nyu.edu|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The problem of attaining human-level competency at "commonsense knowledge" tasks is considered to probably be "[[AI complete]]" (that is, solving it would require the ability to synthesize a [[artificial general intelligence|human-level intelligence]]).&lt;ref&gt;Yampolskiy, Roman V. "AI-Complete, AI-Hard, or AI-Easy-Classification of Problems in AI." MAICS. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andrich, C, Novosel, L, and Hrnkas, B. (2009). [https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/59e3/495f4f1e70629e17ddbbce06834626b2a363.pdf Common Sense Knowledge]. Information Search and Retrieval, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Approaches and techniques ==
Commonsense’s reasoning study is divided into knowledge-based approaches and approaches that are based on machine learning over and using a large data corpora with limited interactions between these two types of approaches. There are also crowdsourcing approaches, attempting to construct a knowledge basis by linking the collective knowledge and the input of non-expert people. Knowledge-based approaches can be separated into approaches based on mathematical logic.

In knowledge-based approaches, the experts are analyzing the characteristics of the inferences that are required to do reasoning in a specific area or for a certain task. The knowledge-based approaches consist of mathematically grounded approaches, informal knowledge-based approaches and large-scale approaches. The mathematically grounded approaches are purely theoretical and the result is a printed paper instead of a program. The work is limited to the range of the domains and the reasoning techniques that are being reflected on. In informal knowledge-based approaches, theories of reasoning are based on anecdotal data and intuition that are results from empirical behavioral psychology. Informal approaches are common in computer programming. Two other popular techniques for extracting commonsense knowledge from Web documents involve [[Web mining]] and [[Crowd sourcing]].

'''Computational statistics''', or '''statistical computing''', is the interface between [[statistics]] and [[computer science]]. It is the area of [[computational science]] (or scientific computing) specific to the mathematical science of [[statistics]]. This area is also developing rapidly, leading to calls that a broader concept of computing should be taught as part of general [[statistical education]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Deborah A. Nolan|Nolan, D.]] &amp; Temple Lang, D. (2010). "Computing in the Statistics Curricula", ''[[The American Statistician]]'' '''64''' (2), pp.97-107.&lt;/ref&gt;

As in [[Statistics|traditional statistics]] the goal is to transform [[raw data]] into [[knowledge]],&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[[Edward Wegman|Wegman, Edward]] J. “[https://www.jstor.org/stable/24536995 Computational Statistics: A New Agenda for Statistical Theory and Practice.]” ''[http://www.washacadsci.org/journal/ Journal of the Washington Academy of Sciences]'', vol. 78, no. 4, 1988, pp. 310–322. ''JSTOR''&lt;/ref&gt; but the focus lies on [[computer]] intensive [[statistical methods]], such as cases with very large [[Sample size determination|sample size]] and non-homogeneous [[data set]]s.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The terms 'computational statistics' and 'statistical computing' are often used interchangeably, although Carlo Lauro (a former president of the [[International Association for Statistical Computing]]) proposed making a distinction, defining 'statistical computing' as "the application of computer science to statistics",
and 'computational statistics' as "aiming at the design of algorithm for implementing
statistical methods on computers, including the ones unthinkable before the computer
age (e.g. [[bootstrapping (statistics)|bootstrap]], [[Monte Carlo simulation|simulation]]), as well as to cope with analytically intractable problems" [''[[sic]]''].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| first=Carlo|last=Lauro| title=Computational statistics or statistical computing, is that the question?| journal= Computational Statistics &amp; Data Analysis| volume=23| issue=1| year=1996| pages=191–193| url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/B6V8V-3SWT44Y-F/2/5320a35df36fb38ffba03483c73dc861| doi=10.1016/0167-9473(96)88920-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term 'Computational statistics' may also be used to refer to computationally ''intensive'' statistical methods including [[resampling (statistics)|resampling]] methods, [[Markov chain Monte Carlo]] methods, [[local regression]], [[kernel density estimation]], [[artificial neural networks]] and [[generalized additive model]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3770">'''David Wyn Jones''' (born 1950) is a British [[musicology|musicologist]]. He is an expert on music of the [[Classical period (music)|Classical period]], including that of [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]] and [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]].

==Professional life==
Jones received his Ph.D. from the [[University of Wales]] in 1978, on the basis of a doctoral dissertation in three volumes entitled ''The String Quartets of [[Johann Baptist Vanhal|Vanhal]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Brook and Viano (1997:460)&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier (1974) he had been appointed as a Lecturer at [[Cardiff University]], and was subsequently promoted there several times:  Senior Lecturer (1998), Reader (2002), Professorial Chair (2007). He served as Head of School from March 2008 to July 2013.&lt;ref&gt;Source:  Jones's web site, cited below&lt;/ref&gt; He serves on the editorial board of the journal ''Eighteenth-Century Music'' and the e-journal ''Haydn''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rit.edu/affiliate/haydn/ Journal site]&lt;/ref&gt; He has given lectures and talks at the BBC [[Proms]], the [[Edinburgh Festival]], and at the [[Royal Festival Hall]] and other major venues.&lt;ref&gt;Jones web site&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honors==
His book ''Oxford Composer Companions: Haydn'' was awarded a prize by the International Association of Music Librarians (UK and Ireland) in 2002. He has served as chairman of the Music Libraries Trust since 2005 and was elected a Vice President of the [[Royal Musical Association]] in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Jones web site&lt;/ref&gt;

==Books==
Jones's books incorporate a large amount of factual information, much of it from recent scholarly research. He tends to favor trustworthy over vivid sources (e.g. for Haydn, the sober [[Georg August Griesinger|Griesinger]], in preference to the tale-spinning [[Albert Christoph Dies|Dies]] and [[Giuseppe Carpani|Carpani]]).

'''Diauxic growth''' or [[diauxie]] is any cell growth characterized by cellular growth in two phases, and can be illustrated with a [[diauxic growth curve]].  Diauxic growth, meaning double growth, is caused by the presence of two sugars on a culture growth media, one of which is easier for the target bacterium to metabolize.  The preferred sugar is consumed first, which leads to rapid growth, followed by a lag phase.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Editors|first=AccessScience|date=2015|title=Diauxic growth (diauxie)|url=https://www.accessscience.com/content/diauxic-growth-diauxie/BR0105151|journal=Access Science|language=en|doi=10.1036/1097-8542.BR0105151}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the lag phase the cellular machinery used to metabolize the second sugar is activated and subsequently the second sugar is metabolized.

This can also occur when the bacterium in a closed batch culture consumes most of its nutrients and is entering the stationary phase when new nutrients are suddenly added to the growth media. The bacterium enters a lag phase where it tries to ingest the food. Once the food starts being utilized, it enters a new log phase showing a second peak on the growth curve.

A '''diauxic growth curve''' refers to the [[growth curve (biology)|growth curve]] generated by an [[organism]] which has two growth peaks.  The theory behind the diauxic growth curve stems from [[Jacques Monod|Jacques Monod's]] Ph.D. research in 1940.

A simple example involves the [[bacterium]] ''Escherichia coli'' (''E. coli''), the best understood bacterium.  The bacterium is grown on a [[growth media]] containing two types of [[sugars]], one of which is easier to [[metabolism|metabolize]] than the other (for example [[glucose]] and [[lactose]]).  First, the bacterium will metabolize all the glucose, and grow at a higher speed.  Eventually, when all the glucose has been consumed, the bacterium will begin the process of expressing the [[gene]]s to metabolize the lactose.  This will only occur when all glucose in the media has been consumed.  For these reasons, '''diauxic growth''' occurs in multiple phases.

The first phase is the ''fast growth phase'', since the bacterium is consuming (in the case of the above example) exclusively glucose, and is capable of rapid growth.  The second phase is a ''lag phase'' while the genes used in lactose metabolism are expressed and observable cell growth stops.  This is followed by another ''growth phase'' which is slower than the first because of the use of lactose as the primary energy source.  The final stage is the ''saturation phase''. This process can also refer to the positive control of the lac operon.

'''DIPROMISTO''' ([[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]]: ДІПРОМІСТО) is a research and planning institute in the field of spatial and urban planning in Ukraine. It is a state enterprise within the field of governance of the [[Ministry of Regional Development (Ukraine)|Ministry of Regional Development, Construction and Housing of Ukraine]]. It was established on September 12, 1930. Its full name is ''State Enterprise Y.Bilokon Ukrainian State Scientific-Research Institute of Urban Design "DIPROMISTO"''.
&lt;br /&gt;In Russian language sources it is also known as Giprograd ([[Russian language|Russian]]: Гипроград). During Soviet times it was a system of planning institutes consisting of the central institute in Kyiv and a range of affiliates in oblasts' centres of USSR. In due time, most of the affiliates separated from the Dipromisto system into separate institutes. Currently the Institute has three affiliates: Ivano-Frankivsk, Rivne, and Volyn affiliates.&lt;ref name="Book"&gt;[http://dipromisto.gov.ua/files/Publications/BookGiprograd1990.pdf Giprograd. Information, page 3 (in Russian, English, and French)]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Dipromisto Team1930.jpg|thumb|300px|Dipromisto's team in 1933 or 1934.|left]]
The Institute “DIPROMISTO” was established on September 12, 1930. According to the Government of Ukrainian SSR Statute, the Institute had been assigned the tasks of urban planning, design residential and community buildings, and scientific work in the field of urban planning.&lt;br /&gt; During the pre-war period, Dipromisto’s team had produced a great amount of projects on regional planning in the most significant industrial regions, planning of cities and villages, design of community facilities, residential and public buildings, allocation of new industrial development, guidance and control on construction, scientific elaboration of key issues in spatial and urban planning, and experimental and standard design.&lt;ref name="Book2"&gt;[http://dipromisto.gov.ua/files/Publications/BookGiprograd1990.pdf Giprograd. Information, page 6 (in Russian, English, and French)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt; During 1943-44 the key task of the Institute was to identify the loss to urban economies caused by war and define top-priority measures to assist the recovery of the cities of Ukrainian SSR. The huge destruction caused by war events in cities and villages demanded not only wide planning measures, but also new approaches to solving problems in the sphere of urban planning.&lt;br /&gt; In the 1950s, the attention of planners turned to verdurization and improvement of cities and villages, and the formation of their architectural view and landscape. In relation to such tendencies in 1962 a new architectural-planning workshop on resort-recreational objects design was created in the Institute in which both theoretical and practical works on resort design and typification have been made. In 1960-70s a landscape workshop was formed in the Institute in which the works on landscape reconstruction of green plantations and natural landscapes organisation have been designed.
[[File:Dipromisto Bilokon.jpg|right|thumb|300px|'''Yurii Mykolayovych Bilokon''', &lt;br /&gt; Director of the Institute in 1993-2009, &lt;br /&gt; People’s Architect of Ukraine]]Having started in late 1960s the work on schemes of regional planning for 25 Oblasts of Ukrainian SSR lasted until 1989. In 1985 the Institute “DIPROMISTO” started working on Summary Scheme of Regional Planning of Ukrainian SSR.&lt;ref name="Book3"&gt;[http://dipromisto.gov.ua/files/Publications/BookGiprograd1990.pdf Giprograd. Information, page 9 (in Russian, English, and French)]&lt;/ref&gt; In this complex scheme the versatile analyses of territorial resources and the state of environment, settlement systems, social, engineer and transport infrastructure has been given. &lt;br /&gt; With obtaining the state independence by Ukraine the tasks of revaluation of factors of regions and the whole state development, defining new priority axes of development, reorganisation of settlement system in consideration with political and economic changes, providing the integrated intrastate system of spatial and urban development, taking into account a market relations in planning of settlements development had arisen ahead of the experts in the field of spatial and urban planning.&lt;br /&gt; Since the beginning of 1990s an active work on implementation of geographical information technologies into spatial and urban planning is carried out in the Institute. Already in 1991-1993 the experts of the Institute “DIPROMISTO” have elaborated geographical information system for the purposes of urban planning – MISTO. Since 1995 the Base Center on implementation of GIS into spatial and urban planning is functioning in the structure of the Institute. Already in the end of 1995 it became evident that further usage of own software wasn’t enough to solve the tasks arisen before the Center and the whole Institute. Consequently, an active implementation of software products by [[Environmental Systems Research Institute|ESRI]] – the leader in GIS software production – had been started. Such technological re-equipment allowed not only to rise significantly the quality of spatial and urban planning works, but also to come to rethinking of methodology of both spatial and urban planning and of regions and settlements governing development.&lt;br /&gt;The strengthening of the Institute in conditions of independent Ukraine has been realized under the direction of Yurii Mykolaiovych Bilokon, Doctor of Architecture, Professor, People’s Architect of Ukraine. The activity of Yurii Mykolaiovych Bilokon in the Institute has been wide and versatile – as a talented architect, who was highly aware of the problems of both planning and architectural design, he made a lot for improvement and development of the Institute functioning. Yurii Bilokon became one of the initiators of spatial planning of cross-border regions and elaborated methodological basis for these works. Bilokon Y.M. paid a great attention to scientific activity development in the Institute, education of the next generation of experts having been created a scientific-production-educational complex "Arhmistobud"&lt;ref name="АМБ"&gt;[http://www.knuba.edu.ua/ukr/?page_id=554 Information about the scientific-production-educational complex "Arhmistobud" on the web-page of the Department of Urban Planning of Kyiv National University of Construction and Architecture]&lt;/ref&gt; on the base of the Institute in collaboration with the Department of Urban Planning of [[Kyiv National University of Construction and Architecture]], implementation of the latest information technologies into the productive activity.&lt;br /&gt;In 2009 in gratitude for 16 years of the talented leadership and in memory of the passionate role of Yurii Bilokon’s personality in the development of the Institute, the staff has initiated to name the Institute “DIPROMISTO” after Y.M.Bilokon which was adopted by the Order of the Ministry of Regional Development of Ukraine.&lt;ref name="Name"&gt;[http://search.ligazakon.ua/l_doc2.nsf/link1/FIN60585.html The Order of the Ministry of Regional Development, Construction and Housing of Ukraine from October, 26, 2010 No. 415 “About Renaming of  the State enterprise Ukrainian State Scientific-Research Institute of Urban Design “Dipromisto”]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dr. Duke's Phytochemical and Ethnobotanical Databases''' is an online database developed by [[James A. Duke]] at the [[USDA]].

The databases report species, [[phytochemical]]s, and [[biological activity]], as well as [[ethnobotanical]] uses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url=https://dx.doi.org/10.15482/USDA.ADC/1239279 | doi=10.15482/USDA.ADC/1239279| title=Dr. Duke's Phytochemical and Ethnobotanical Databases| year=2016| last1=Duke| first1=James A.| publisher=Ag Data Commons}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current Phytochemical and Ethnobotanical databases facilitate plant, chemical, bioactivity, and ethnobotany searches. A large number of plants and their chemical profiles are covered, and data are structured to support browsing and searching in several user-focused ways. For example, users can
* get a list of chemicals and activities for a specific plant of interest, using either its scientific or common name
* download a list of chemicals and their known activities in PDF or spreadsheet form
* find plants with chemicals known for a specific biological activity
* display a list of chemicals with their LD toxicity data
* find plants with potential cancer-preventing activity
* display a list of plants for a given ethnobotanical use
* find out which plants have the highest levels of a specific chemical
References to the supporting scientific publications are provided for each specific result. Also included are links to nutritional databases, plants and cancer treatments and other plant-related databases.

'''Early Christian art and architecture''' or '''Paleochristian art''' is the art produced by [[Christian]]s or under Christian patronage from the [[Early Christianity|earliest period]] of [[Christianity]] to, depending on the definition used, sometime between 260 and 525. In practice, identifiably Christian art only survives from the 2nd century onwards.{{sfn|Jensen|2000|p=15–16}} After 550 at the latest, Christian art is classified as [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]], or of some other regional type.{{sfn|Jensen|2000|p=15–16}}&lt;ref&gt;van der Meer, F., 27 uses "roughly from 200 to 600".&lt;/ref&gt;

It is hard to know when distinctly [[Christian art]] began. Prior to 100, Christians may have been constrained by their position as a persecuted group from producing durable works of art. Since Christianity was largely a [[religion]] of the lower classes in this period,{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}} the lack of surviving art may reflect a lack of funds for [[patronage]], and simply small numbers of followers. The [[Old Testament]] restrictions against the production of graven (an idol or fetish carved in wood or stone) images (see also [[Idolatry and Christianity]]) may also have [[aniconism in Christianity|constrained Christians from producing art]]. Christians may have made or purchased art with [[paganism|pagan]] [[iconography]], but given it Christian meanings, as they later did.  If this happened, "Christian" art would not be immediately recognizable as such.

Early Christianity used the same artistic media as the surrounding pagan culture. These media included [[fresco]], [[mosaic]]s, [[sculpture]], and [[illuminated manuscript|manuscript illumination]]. Early Christian art not only used [[Roman architecture|Roman]] forms, it also used Roman styles. Late classical style included a proportional portrayal of the human body and impressionistic presentation of space. Late classical style is seen in early Christian frescos, such as those in the [[Catacombs of Rome]], which include most examples of the earliest Christian art.{{sfn|Syndicus|1962|p=10–14}}{{sfn|Syndicus|1962|p=30-32}}{{sfn|Jensen|2000|p=12-15}}

Early Christian art and architecture adapted [[Roman art|Roman]] artistic motifs and gave new meanings to what had been pagan symbols. Among the motifs adopted were the [[peacock]], [[grape]]vines, and the "[[Good Shepherd]]". Early Christians also developed their own [[iconography]], for example, such symbols as the fish (''[[ikhthus]]''), were not borrowed from pagan iconography.

Early Christian art is generally divided into two periods by scholars: before and after either the [[Edict of Milan]] of 313, bringing the so-called [[Triumph of the Church]] under [[Constantine I|Constantine]], or the [[First Council of Nicea]] in 325.  The earlier period being called the Pre-Constantinian or [[Ante-Nicene Period]] and after being the period of the [[First seven Ecumenical Councils]].{{sfn|Jensen|2000|p=16}} The end of the period of early Christian art, which is typically defined by art historians as being in the 5th–7th centuries, is thus a good deal later than the end of the period of early Christianity as typically defined by theologians and church historians, which is more often considered to end under Constantine, around 313–325.

During the [[Persecution of early Christians in the Roman Empire|persecution of Christians under the Roman Empire]], Christian art was necessarily and deliberately furtive and ambiguous, using imagery that was shared with pagan culture but had a special meaning for Christians. The earliest surviving Christian art comes from the late 2nd to early 4th centuries on the walls of Christian [[tomb]]s in the [[catacombs of Rome]].  From literary evidence, there may well have been panel [[icon]]s which, like almost all classical painting, have disappeared.  Initially Jesus was represented indirectly by [[pictogram]] symbols such as the ''[[Ichthys]]'' (fish), [[peacock]], [[Lamb of God]], or an anchor (the ''[[Labarum]]'' or ''Chi-Rho'' was a later development).  Later personified symbols were used, including [[Jonah]], whose three days in the belly of the whale pre-figured the interval between the death and [[resurrection of Jesus]], [[Daniel (biblical figure)|Daniel]] in the lion's den, or [[Orpheus]]' charming the animals. The image of "[[The Good Shepherd (religion)|The Good Shepherd]]", a beardless youth in [[pastoral]] scenes collecting [[sheep]], was the most common of these images, and was probably not understood as a portrait of the historical Jesus.{{sfn|Syndicus|1962|p=21-23}} These images bear some resemblance to depictions of ''kouros'' figures in Greco-Roman art.  The "almost total absence from Christian monuments of the period of persecutions of the plain, unadorned [[cross]]" except in the disguised form of the anchor,&lt;ref&gt;Marucchi, Orazio. "Archæology of the Cross and Crucifix." The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 4. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1908. 7 Sept. 2018 [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04517a.htm online]&lt;/ref&gt; is notable.  The Cross, symbolizing Jesus' crucifixion on a cross, was not represented explicitly for several centuries, possibly because crucifixion was a punishment meted out to common criminals, but also because literary sources noted that it was a symbol recognised as specifically Christian, as the [[sign of the cross]] was made by Christians from very early on.

The popular conception that the Christian catacombs were "secret" or had to hide their affiliation is probably wrong; catacombs were large-scale commercial enterprises, usually sited just off major roads to the city, whose existence was well known.  The inexplicit symbolic nature of many early Christian visual motifs may have had a function of discretion in other contexts, but on tombs they probably reflect a lack of any other repertoire of Christian iconography.{{sfn|Jensen|2000|p=22}}

The dove is a symbol of peace and purity. It can be found with a halo or celestial light. In one of the earliest known Trinitarian images, "the Throne of God as a Trinitarian image" (a marble relief carved c. 400 CE in the collection of the Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation), the dove represents the Spirit. It is flying above an [[empty throne]] representing God, in the throne are a ''[[chlamys]]'' (cloak) and [[diadem]] representing the Son.  The [[Chi-Rho]] monogram, XP, apparently first used by [[Constantine I]], consists of the first two characters of the name 'Christos' in Greek.

A general assumption that [[Aniconism in Christianity#Early Christianity|early Christianity was generally aniconic]], opposed to religious imagery in both theory and practice until about 200, has been challenged by Paul Corby Finney's analysis of early Christian writing and material remains (1994).  This distinguishes three different sources of attitudes affecting early Christians on the issue: "first that humans could have a direct vision of God; second that they could not; and, third, that although humans could see God they were best advised not to look, and were strictly forbidden to represent what they had seen".  These derived respectively from Greek and Near Eastern pagan religions, from Ancient Greek philosophy, and from the Jewish tradition and the Old Testament. Of the three, Finney concludes that "overall, Israel's aversion to sacred images influenced early Christianity considerably less than the Greek philosophical tradition of invisible deity apophatically defined", so placing less emphasis on the [[Jewish Christianity|Jewish background]] of most of the first Christians than most traditional accounts.&lt;ref&gt;Finney, viii–xii, viii and xi quoted&lt;/ref&gt;  Finney suggests that "the reasons for the non-appearance of Christian art before 200 have nothing to do with principled aversion to art, with other-worldliness, or with anti-materialism. The truth is simple and mundane: Christians lacked land and capital. Art requires both. As soon as they began to acquire land and capital, Christians began to experiment with their own distinctive forms of art".&lt;ref&gt;Finney, 108&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Dura-Europos church]], of about 230–256, which is in the best condition of the surviving very early churches, there are frescos of biblical scenes including a figure of Jesus, as well as Christ as the [[Good Shepherd]].  The building was a normal house apparently converted to use as a church.{{sfn|Weitzmann|1979|p=no. 360}}&lt;ref&gt;Graydon F. Snyder, ''Ante pacem: archaeological evidence of church life before Constantine'', p. 134,  Mercer University Press, 2003, [https://books.google.com/books?id=swtI9Cpyl3kC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s google books]&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest Christian paintings in the [[Catacombs of Rome]] are from a few decades before, and these represent the largest body of examples of Christian art from the pre-Constantinian period, with hundreds of examples decorating tombs or family tomb-chambers. Many are simple symbols, but there are numerous figure paintings either showing [[orant]]s or female praying figures, usually representing the deceased person, or figures or shorthand scenes from the bible or Christian history.

The style of the catacomb paintings, and the entirety of many decorative elements, are effectively identical to those of the catacombs of other religious groups, whether conventional pagans following [[Ancient Roman religion]], or Jews or followers of the [[Roman mystery religion]]s.  The quality of the painting is low compared to the large houses of the rich, which provide the other main ''corpus'' of painting surviving from the period, but the shorthand depiction of figures can have an expressive charm.{{sfn|Syndicus|1962|p=29-30}}{{sfn|Jensen|2000|p=24}}{{sfn|Beckwith|1979|p=23–24}} A similar situation applies at [[Dura-Europos]], where the decoration of the church is comparable in style and quality to that of the (larger and more lavishly painted) [[Dura-Europos synagogue]] and the Temple of Bel. At least in such smaller places, it seems that the available artists were used by all religious groups. It may also have been the case that the painted chambers in the cattacombs were decorated in similar style to the best rooms of the homes of the better-off families buried in them,  with Christian scenes and symbols replacing those from mythology, literature, paganism and eroticism, although we lack the evidence to confirm this.{{sfn|Syndicus|1962|p=10–11}}{{sfn|Jensen|2000|p=10-15}}&lt;ref&gt;Balch, 183, 193&lt;/ref&gt;  We do have the same scenes on small pieces in media such as pottery or glass,{{sfn|Weitzmann|1979|p=no. 377}} though less often from this pre-Constantinian period.

There was a preference for what are sometimes called "abbreviated" representations, small groups of say one to four figures forming a single motif which could be easily recognised as representing a particular incident. These vignettes fitted the Roman style of room decoration, set in compartments in a scheme with a geometrical structure (see gallery below).{{sfn|Weitzmann|1979|p=396}}  Biblical scenes of figures rescued from mortal danger were very popular; these represented both the [[Resurrection of Jesus]], through [[typology (theology)|typology]], and the salvation of the soul of the deceased. [[Jonah and the whale]],{{sfn|Weitzmann|1979|p=no. 365}}&lt;ref&gt;Balch, 41 and chapter 6&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Sacrifice of Isaac]], [[Noah]] praying in the Ark (represented as an orant in a large box, perhaps with a dove carrying a branch), [[Moses]] striking the rock, [[Daniel in the lion's den]] and the [[Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego|Three Youths in the Fiery Furnace]] ({{Bibleref2c|Daniel|3:10–30|NIV|Daniel 3:10–30}}) were all favourites, that could be easily depicted.{{sfn|Syndicus|1962|p=15-18}}{{sfn|Jensen|2000|p=Chapte 3}}{{sfn|Weitzmann|1979|p=396}}{{sfn|Weitzmann|1979|p=no. 360-407}}{{sfn|Beckwith|1979|p=21-24}}

[[Early Christian sarcophagi]] were a much more expensive option, made of marble and often heavily decorated with scenes in very [[high relief]], worked with drills. Free-standing statues that are unmistakably Christian are very rare, and never very large, as more common subjects such as the [[Good Shepherd]] were symbols appealing to several religious and philosophical groups, including Christians, and without context no affiliation can be given to them.  Typically sculptures, where they appear, are of rather high quality. One exceptional group that seems clearly Christian is known as the Cleveland Statuettes of Jonah and the Whale,{{sfn|Weitzmann|1979|p=no. 362-367}}{{sfn|Weitzmann|1979|p=396}} and consists of a group of small statuettes of about 270, including two busts of a young and fashionably dressed couple, from an unknown find-spot, possibly in modern Turkey.  The other figures tell the story of Jonah in four pieces, with a Good Shepherd; how they were displayed remains mysterious.{{sfn|Weitzmann|1979|p=410}}

The [[depiction of Jesus]] was well-developed by the end of the pre-Constantinian period. He was typically shown in narrative scenes, with a preference for [[New Testament]] miracles, and few of scenes from his Passion.  A variety of different types of appearance were used, including the thin long-faced figure with long centrally-parted hair that was later to become the norm. But in the earliest images as many show a stocky and short-haired beardless figure in a short tunic, who can only be identified by his context. In many images of miracles Jesus carries a stick or wand, which he points at the subject of the miracle rather like a modern stage magician (though the wand is a good deal larger).

Saints are fairly often seen, with [[saint Peter|Peter]] and [[Saint Paul|Paul]], both martyred in Rome, by some way the most common in the catacombs there. Both already have their distinctive appearances, retained throughout the history of Christian art. Other saints may not be identifiable unless labelled with an inscription.  In the same way some images may represent either the [[Last Supper]] or a contemporary [[agape feast]].

==Christian architecture after 313==
[[File:Santa Sabina.JPG|thumb|[[Santa Sabina]], Rome, interior (5th century).]]
:Main article: '''''Christianising the basilica''''' in '''''[[Basilica]]'''''

In the 4th century, the rapidly growing Christian population, now supported by the state, needed to build larger and grander public buildings for worship than the mostly discreet meeting places they had been using, which were typically in or among domestic buildings. Pagan temples remained in use for their original purposes for some time and, at least in Rome, even when deserted were shunned by Christians until the 6th or 7th centuries, when some were converted to churches.{{sfn|Syndicus|1962|p=39}} Elsewhere this happened sooner.  Architectural formulas for temples were unsuitable, not simply for their pagan associations, but because pagan cult and sacrifices occurred outdoors under the open sky in the sight of the gods, with the temple, housing the cult figures and the treasury, as a windowless backdrop.

The usable model at hand, when [[Constantine I (emperor)|Emperor Constantine I]] wanted to memorialize his imperial piety, was the familiar conventional architecture of the [[basilica]].  There were several variations of the basic plan of the secular basilica, always some kind of rectangular hall, but the one usually followed for churches had a center nave with one aisle at each side, and an [[apse]] at one end opposite to the main door at the other. In, and often also in front of, the apse was a raised platform, where the altar was placed and the clergy officiated.  In secular buildings this plan was more typically used for the smaller audience halls of the emperors, governors, and the very rich than for the great public basilicas functioning as law courts and other public purposes.{{sfn|Syndicus|1962|p=40}} This was the normal pattern used for Roman churches, and generally in the Western Empire, but the Eastern Empire, and Roman Africa, were more adventurous, and their models were sometimes copied in the West, for example in [[Milan]].  All variations allowed natural light from windows high in the walls, a departure from the windowless sanctuaries of the temples of most previous religions, and this has remained a consistent feature of Christian [[church architecture]]. Formulas giving churches with a large central area were to become preferred in [[Byzantine architecture]], which developed styles of basilica with a dome early on.{{sfn|Syndicus|1962|loc=chapter II, covers the whole story of the Christianization of the basilica.}}

A particular and short-lived type of building, using the same basilican form, was the '''funerary hall''', which was not a normal church, though the surviving examples long ago became regular churches, and they always offered funeral and memorial services, but a building erected in the Constantinian period as an indoor cemetery on a site connected with early Christian martyrs, such as a catacomb.  The six examples built by Constantine outside the walls of Rome are: [[Old Saint Peter's Basilica]], the older basilica dedicated to [[Saint Agnes]] of which [[Santa Costanza]] is now the only remaining element, [[San Sebastiano fuori le mura]], [[San Lorenzo fuori le Mura]], [[Santi Marcellino e Pietro al Laterano]], and one in the modern park of [[Villa Gordiani]].&lt;ref&gt;Webb, Matilda. ''The churches and catacombs of early Christian Rome: a comprehensive guide'', p. 251, 2001, Sussex Academic Press, {{ISBN|1-902210-58-1}}, {{ISBN|978-1-902210-58-2}}, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=hUN1K78QMskC&amp;pg=PA249&amp;dq=santa+costanza+rome&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=g2NRTvayJMzD8QOjwNyvBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CEQQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=santa%20costanza%20rome&amp;f=false google books]&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Martyrium (architecture)|martyrium]] was a building erected on a spot with particular significance, often over the burial of a martyr. No particular architectural form was associated with the type, and they were often small. Many became churches, or chapels in larger churches erected adjoining them.  With baptistries and mausolea, their often smaller size and different function made martyria suitable for architectural experimentation.{{sfn|Syndicus|1962|loc=chapter III}}
  
Among the key buildings, not all surviving in their original form, are:
*Constantinian [[Basilicas]]:
**[[Basilica di San Giovanni in Laterano|St. John Lateran]]
**[[Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore|St Mary Major]]
**[[Old Saint Peter's Basilica]]
**[[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]]
**[[Church of the Nativity]]
*Centralized Plan
**[[Santa Constanza]], built as an Imperial mausoleum adjoining a funerary hall, part of the wall of which survives.{{sfn|Syndicus|1962|p=69-70}}

==Christian art after 313==
[[File:1057 - Roma, Museo d. civiltà Romana - Calco sarcofago Giunio Basso - Foto Giovanni Dall'Orto, 12-Apr-2008.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Detail - cast of the central sections of the [[Sarcophagus of Junius Bassus]], with ''[[Traditio Legis]]'' and ''Jesus entering Jerusalem''.]]
With the final legalization of Christianity, the existing styles of Christian art continued to develop, and take on a more monumental and iconic character.  Before long very large Christian churches began to be constructed, and the majority of the rich elite adapted Christianity, and public and elite Christian art became grander to suit the new spaces and clients.

Although borrowings of motifs such as the [[Virgin and Child]] from pagan religious art had been pointed out as far back as the [[Protestant Reformation]], when [[John Calvin]] and his followers gleefully used them as a stick with which to beat all Christian art, the belief of [[André Grabar]], [[Andreas Alföldi]], [[Ernst Kantorowicz]] and other early 20th-century art historians that Roman Imperial imagery was a much more significant influence "has become universally accepted".  A book by Thomas F. Mathews in 1994 attempted to overturn this thesis, very largely denying influence from Imperial iconography in favour of a range of other secular and religious influence, but was roughly handled by academic reviewers.&lt;ref&gt;The book was ''The Clash of Gods: A Reinterpretation of Early Christian Art'' by Thomas F. Mathews. Review by: W. Eugene Kleinbauer (quoted, from p. 937), ''Speculum'', Vol. 70, No. 4 (Oct., 1995), pp. 937-941, Medieval Academy of America, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2865390 JSTOR]; JSTOR has other reviews, all with criticisms along similar lines: [[Peter Brown (historian)|Peter Brown]], ''[[The Art Bulletin]]'', Vol. 77, No. 3 (Sep., 1995), pp. 499–502;  RW. Eugene Kleinbauer, ''Speculum'', Vol. 70, No. 4 (Oct., 1995), pp. 937–941 ,  Liz James, ''[[The Burlington Magazine]]'', Vol. 136, No. 1096 (Jul., 1994), pp. 458–459;Annabel Wharton, ''The American Historical Review'', Vol. 100, No. 5 (Dec., 1995), pp. 1518–1519 .&lt;/ref&gt;

More complex and expensive works are seen, as the wealthy gradually converted, and more theological complexity appears, as Christianity became subject to acrimonious doctrinal disputes. At the same time a very different type of art is found in the new public churches that were now being constructed.  Somewhat by accident, the best group of survivals of these is from Rome where, together with Constantinople and Jesusalem, they were presumably at their most magnificent. [[Mosaic]] now becomes important; fortunately this survives far better than [[fresco]], although it is vulnerable to well-meaning restoration and repair. It seems to have been an innovation of early Christian churches to put mosaics on the wall and use them for sacred subjects; previously the technique had essentially been used for floors and walls in gardens.  By the end of the period the style of gold background had developed that continued to characterize Byzantine images, and many [[Early Medieval]] Western ones.

With more space, narrative images containing many people develop in churches, and also begin to be seen in later catacomb paintings. Continuous rows of biblical scenes appear (rather high up) along the side walls of churches. The best-preserved 5th-century examples are the set of [[Old Testament]] scenes along the nave walls of  [[Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore|Santa Maria Maggiore]] in Rome.  These can be compared to the paintings of Dura-Europos, and probably also derive from a lost tradition of both Jewish and Christian illustrated manuscripts, as well as more general Roman precedents.{{sfn|Syndicus|1962|p=52-54}}{{sfn|Weitzmann|1979|p=366-369}} The large [[apse]]s contain images in an iconic style, which gradually developed to centre on a large figure, or later just the bust, of Christ, or later of the Virgin Mary. The earliest apses show a range of compositions that are new symbolic images of the Christian life and the Church.

No panel paintings, or "[[icon]]s" from before the 6th century have survived in anything like an original condition, but they were clearly produced, and becoming more important throughout this period.

Sculpture, all much smaller than lifesize, has survived in better quantities.  The most famous of a considerable number of surviving [[early Christian sarcophagi]] are perhaps the [[Sarcophagus of Junius Bassus]] and [[Dogmatic sarcophagus]] of the 4th century.  A number of [[ivory carving]]s have survived, including the complex late-5th-century [[Brescia Casket]], probably a product of Saint [[Ambrose]]'s episcopate in [[Milan]], then the seat of the Imperial court, and the 6th-century [[Throne of Maximian]] from the Byzantine Italian capital of [[Ravenna]].

===Gold glass===
{{main article|Gold glass}}
[[Gold sandwich glass]] or gold glass was a technique for fixing a layer of [[gold leaf]] with a design between two fused layers of glass, developed in [[Hellenistic glass]] and revived in the 3rd century.  There are a very fewer larger designs, but the great majority of the around 500 survivals are roundels that are the cut-off bottoms of wine cups or glasses used to mark and decorate graves in the [[Catacombs of Rome]] by pressing them into the mortar. The great majority are 4th century, extending into the 5th century. Most are Christian, but many pagan and a few Jewish, and had probably originally been given as gifts on marriage, or festive occasions such as New Year.  Their [[iconography]] has been much studied, although artistically they are relatively unsophisticated.{{sfn|Beckwith|1979|p=25-26}} Their subjects are similar to the catacomb paintings, but with a difference balance including more portraiture of the deceased (usually, it is presumed).  The progression to an increased number of images of saints can be seen in them.&lt;ref&gt;Grig, throughout&lt;/ref&gt;  The same technique began to be used for gold [[tesserae]] for mosaics in the mid-1st century in Rome, and by the 5th century these had become the standard background for religious mosaics.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6994">The '''electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide''' ('''ERC''') is the conversion of [[carbon dioxide]] to more [[reduction (chemistry)|reduced chemical species]] using electrical energy. The first examples of electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide are from the 19th century, when carbon dioxide was reduced to [[carbon monoxide]] using a [[zinc]] [[cathode]]. Research in this field intensified in the 1980s following the [[oil embargo]]es of the 1970s.  Electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide represents a possible means of producing chemicals or fuels, converting carbon dioxide ({{CO2|link=yes}}) to organic feedstocks such as [[Formic acid|formic acid (HCOOH)]], [[Methanol|methanol (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;OH)]], [[Ethylene|ethylene (C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)]], [[Methane|methane (CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)]], and [[Carbon monoxide|carbon monoxide (CO)]].&lt;ref name=Centi&gt;Gabriele Centi, Siglinda Perathoner "Opportunities and prospects in the chemical recycling of carbon dioxide to fuels" Catalysis Today 148 (2009) 191–205.{{doi|10.1016/j.cattod.2009.07.075}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J.

Rev. 2013, vol. 113, 6621-6658.  {{DOI|10.1021/cr300463y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Chemicals from carbon dioxide ==
In [[carbon fixation]], plants convert carbon dioxide into sugars, from which many biosynthetic pathways originate.  The catalyst responsible for this conversion, [[RuBisCo]], is the most common protein on earth. Some anaerobic organisms employ enzymes to convert CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to [[carbon monoxide]], from which fatty acids can be made.&lt;ref&gt;1. J. C. Fontecilla-Camps, P. Amara, C. Cavazza, Y. Nicolet and A. Volbeda, "Structure-function relationships of anaerobic gas-processing metalloenzymes", Nature 2009, volume 460, p. 814-822.{{doi|10.1038/nature08299}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In industry, a few products are made from CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, including [[urea]], [[salicylic acid]], [[methanol]], and certain inorganic and organic carbonates.&lt;ref&gt;Susan Topham, "Carbon Dioxide" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 2005, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a05_165}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the laboratory, carbon dioxide is sometimes used to prepare [[carboxylic acid]]s.  No electrochemical process involving CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; has been commercialized.

==Electrocatalysis==
The electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide to CO is usually described as:
: CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  +  2 H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;  +  2 e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;   →   CO   + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
The redox potential for this reaction is similar to that for hydrogen evolution in aqueous electrolytes, thus electrochemical reduction of CO2 is usually competitive with hydrogen evolution reaction.&lt;ref name= Jitaru/&gt;

Electrochemical methods have gained significant attention: 1) at ambient pressure and room temperature; 2) in connection with renewable energy sources (see also [[solar fuel]]) 3) competitive controllability, modularity and scale-up is relatively simple.&lt;ref&gt;S. Lee et al., ChemSusChem 9 (2016) 333-344, Electrode Build-Up of Reducible Metal Composites toward Achievable Electrochemical Conversion of Carbon Dioxide{{DOI|10.1002/cssc.201501112}}&lt;/ref&gt; The electrochemical reduction or electrocatalytic conversion of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; can produce value-added chemicals such methane, ethylene, ethane, etc., and the products are mainly dependent on the selected catalysts and operating potentials (applying reduction voltage).&lt;ref&gt;S. Lee et al., Sustainable production of formic acid by electrolytic reduction of gaseous carbon dioxide, J. Mater. Chem. A, 2015,3, 3029-3034 {{DOI|10.1039/C4TA03893B}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;D.T.

Although an electrochemical route to CO (or other chemicals) has not been commercialized, a variety of [[Homogeneous catalysis|homogeneous]] and [[heterogeneous catalyst]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Hori | first1 = Y. | chapter = Electrochemical CO2 Reduction on Metal Electrodes | doi = 10.1007/978-0-387-49489-0_3 | title = Modern Aspects of Electrochemistry | series = Modern Aspects of Electrochemistry | volume = 42 | pages = 89–80 | year = 2008 | isbn = 978-0-387-49488-3 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; have been evaluated.&lt;ref name='Jitaru'/&gt;&lt;ref name=Centi/&gt;  Many such processes are assumed to operate via the intermediacy of [[metal carbon dioxide complex]]es.&lt;ref&gt;Eric E.

[[File:Acer griseum2.jpg|thumb|The exfoliating bark of the [[Paperbark Maple]] ''Acer griseum'']]

'''Exfoliation''' (from the term "foliate", meaning “related to [[leaf|leaves]]”) means the removal or loss of leaves from a [[plant]].  It is used both to describe the loss of a leaves as a natural part of a plant’s [[Biological life cycle|life cycle]] (such as in the case of [[deciduous trees]] which lose their leaves in the autumn) or because of some trauma or outside cause (such as [[dehydration]], an [[infestation]] of [[caterpillar]]s or [[hurricane]]-force winds).

In [[arboriculture]], the term “exfoliating [[Bark (botany)|bark]]” describes the natural process and condition of the bark peeling-away from a [[tree trunk]], typically in large pieces that remain partially attached to the trunk until such time as they are completely detached by the elements or the eventual and subsequent exfoliation of additional layers of bark.  Examples of trees with exfoliating bark are the [[paperbark maple]] and various species of [[Platanus|Plane]] (Sycamore) and [[birch]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3621">'''Foregrounding''' is the practice of making something stand out from the surrounding words or images.&lt;ref&gt;Leech, G. and Short, M. (2007) ''Style in Fiction'' (2nd ed.) Pearson Education Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt; It is "the 'throwing into relief' of the linguistic sign against the background of the norms of ordinary language."&lt;ref&gt;Wales, K. (2001) ''Dictionary of Stylistics'' (2nd ed.) Pearson Education Ltd. p157&lt;/ref&gt; The term was first associated with Paul Garvin in the 1960s, who used it as a translation of the [[Czech (language)|Czech]] ''aktualisace'' (literally "to actualise"), borrowing the terms from the [[Prague school]] of the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Procházka (2010). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=c9a9nhXQUKEC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=The%20Prague%20School%20and%20Theories%20of%20Structure&amp;hl=es&amp;pg=PA196#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The Prague School and Theories of Structure]'' p.196 footnote 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two main types of foregrounding: [[parallelism (grammar)|parallelism]] and deviation. Parallelism can be described as unexpected regularity, while deviation can be seen as unexpected irregularity.&lt;ref&gt;Leech, G. (1969) ''A Linguistic Guide to English Poetry''. Longman&lt;/ref&gt; As the definition of foregrounding indicates, these are relative concepts. Something can only be unexpectedly regular or irregular within a particular context. This context can be relatively narrow, such as the immediate textual surroundings (referred to as a 'secondary norm'&lt;ref&gt;Leech, G. and Short, M. (2007) ''Style in Fiction'' (2nd ed.) Pearson Education Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt;) or wider such as an entire genre (referred to as a 'primary norm'&lt;ref&gt;Leech, G. and Short, M. (2007) ''Style in Fiction'' (2nd ed.) Pearson Education Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt;).

For example, the last line of a poem with a consistent metre may be foregrounded by changing the number of syllables it contains. This would be an example of a deviation from a secondary norm. In the following poem by [[E. E. Cummings]],&lt;ref&gt;as quoted in Wales, K. (2001) ''Dictionary of Stylistics'' (2nd ed.) Pearson Education Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt; there are two types of deviation:

:light’s lives lurch

:a once world quickly from rises

:army the gradual of unbeing fro{{Clarify|date=June 2016}}

:on stiffening greenly air and to ghosts go

:drift slippery hands tease slim float twitter faces

:Only stand with me, love! against these its

:until you are, and until i am dreams...

Firstly, most of the poem deviates from 'normal' language (primary deviation). In addition, there is secondary deviation in that the penultimate line is unexpectedly different from the rest of the poem. [[Nursery rhyme]]s, adverts and [[slogan]]s often exhibit parallelism in the form of repetition and [[rhyme]], but parallelism can also occur over longer texts. For example, jokes are often built on a mixture of parallelism and deviation. They often consist of three parts or characters. The first two are very similar (parallelism) and the third one starts out as similar, but our expectations are thwarted when it turns out different in end (deviation).

Foregrounding can occur on all levels of language&lt;ref&gt;Simpson, p (2004) "Stylistics, A Resource Book". London: Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; ([[phonology]], [[graphology]], [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], [[lexis (linguistics)|lexis]], [[syntax]], [[semantics]] and [[pragmatics]]). It is generally used to highlight important parts of a text, to aid memorability and/or to invite interpretation.

'''''Fundamentals of Physics''''' is a [[calculus]]-based [[physics]] textbook by [[David Halliday (physicist)|David Halliday]], [[Robert Resnick]], and [[Jearl Walker]]. The textbook is currently in its tenth edition (published 2013). The current version is a revised version of the original 1960 textbook ''Physics for Students of Science and Engineering'' by Halliday and Resnick, which was published in two parts (Part I containing Chapters 1-25 and covering mechanics and thermodynamics; Part II containing Chapters 26-48 and covering electromagnetism, optics, and introducing quantum physics).  A 1966 revision of the first edition of Part I changed the title of the textbook to ''Physics''.&lt;ref&gt;Resnick &amp; Halliday, ''Physics'', Part I, rev. ed. (New York, London, and Sydney: John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1966), pp. v-vi, and Resnick &amp; Halliday, ''Physics for Students of Science and Engineering'', Part II, 2nd ed. (New York and London: John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1962), pp. xi-xv.&lt;/ref&gt; It is widely used in [[college]]s as part of the [[undergraduate]] physics courses, and has been well known to [[science]] and [[engineering]] students for decades as "the gold standard" of [[freshman]]-level physics texts. In 2002, the [[American Physical Society]] named the work the most outstanding introductory physics text of the 20th century.

The first edition of the book to bear the title ''Fundamentals of Physics'', first published in 1981, was revised from the original text by [[Farrell Edwards]] and [[John J. Merrill]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.physics.byu.edu/department/publications/merrill-0 Publications by John J.

[[File:John-Garton-reduced 2.jpg|thumb|right|John Garton]]

'''Dr John Garton''', of the firm of Garton Brothers of [[Newton-le-Willows]] in the [[United Kingdom]] was the  Originator of Scientific Farm Plant Breeding. He is credited as the first scientist to show that the common grain crops and many other plants are self-fertilizing. He also invented the process of multiple cross-fertilization of crop plants.

In 1898 the business became known as '''Gartons Limited''' and, under the inspired commercial leadership of '''George Peddie Miln''', was to become the British Empire's largest [[plant breeding]] and [[seed company]]. 

A public company from the start, its shares were traded on the [[London Stock Exchange]] from 1947.

==History of the business==

John Garton and his two brothers, Robert and Thomas, were in business with their father, Peter, in Golborne and Newton-le-Willows in [[Lancashire]], [[England]], as corn and agricultural merchants.

As a young man, John Garton (1863–1922),&lt;ref&gt;Obituary, Warrington Examiner, 27 May 1922&lt;/ref&gt; was the first to understand that whilst some agricultural plants were self-pollinating, others were cross-pollinating. He began experimenting with the artificial cross pollination firstly of cereal plants, then herbage species and root crops. 

He attracted the friendship and encouragement of a young Scottish seedsman, George Peddie Miln (1861–1928)&lt;ref&gt;The Nurseryman and Seedsman, 4 January 1919&lt;/ref&gt; who had trained in [[Dundee]] and was seed manager of Dicksons Limited of [[Chester]].

Knowing he had developed a far reaching new technique in plant breeding John Garton began to carry out many thousands of controlled crosses on fields at the family farm in Newton-le-Willows. He and his colleagues tried in 1889 to interest the UK Government’s new Board of Agriculture in the invention they called '''Scientific Farm Plant Breeding'''.  But this was to no avail.

===Commercial start===

Robert&lt;ref&gt;Obituary, Warrington Examiner, 11 February 1950&lt;/ref&gt; and John Garton made a commercial start as R. &amp; J. Garton.&lt;ref&gt;Warrington Examiner, 11 February 1950&lt;/ref&gt; They launched their first variety, 'Abundance' oat, in 1892.

Generous publicity followed in the press, together with the publication of articles by botanists in the Journal of the [[Royal Agricultural Society of England]], and in the Transactions of the [[Royal Highland and Agricultural Society of Scotland]] in 1894 and 1898.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rhass.org.uk Royal Highland and Agricultural Society of Scotland]   {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130829144444/http://www.rhass.org.uk/ |date=29 August 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Robert Wallace (1853–1939) of the [[University of Edinburgh]] said 'Under the system originated by Mr John Garton an infinite number of new and distinct breeds of oats, barleys, wheats, clovers and grasses have been produced'.&lt;ref&gt;Page 22, 1900 Seed Catalogue, Gartons Limited&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1898 a public company was launched, Gartons Limited. It was based in [[Warrington]]. Many of the 600 or so subscribers for £50,000 cumulative preference shares of 6% rising to 10% were farmers. 

George Peddie Miln joined the company as Managing Director, together with Robert Garton, Thomas R. Garton, Thomas Baxter and Arthur Smith as directors.&lt;ref&gt;Warrington Guardian front page, 6 August 1898&lt;/ref&gt; Robert and John Garton agreed to continue to work for the Company for five years for £500 and to receive the entire ordinary share capital of the new company of £50,000.{{clarification needed|perhaps this makes sense to business people, but it sounds as if they absconded with the capital|date=October 2013}}

It rapidly became the United Kingdom's best known plant breeding and seed company, and also exported seeds widely.&lt;ref&gt;Warrington Examiner, 26 June 1948&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Garton Lectureship at Edinburgh University===

In 1900 an endowment was made to found the Garton Lectureship in Indian and Colonial Agriculture at the University of Edinburgh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2507&amp;dat=19390118&amp;id=uTU1AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=L6YLAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3643,2419176|journal=The Glasgow Herald|title=Obituary: Emeritus Professor Robert Wallace, An authority on agricultural matters — 37 years in Edinburgh chair|date=18 January 1939}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Garton Lectureship still exists as a biennial award to promising young lecturers in the School of Agriculture but is without [[emolument]]s and is no longer tied to colonial agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;Britain's First Chair of Agriculture, Fleming &amp; Robertson, {{ISBN|0-902164-33-3}} pages 47 and 48&lt;/ref&gt;

===Publicity in USA===

Noel Kingsbury writes:&lt;ref&gt;page 140 Kingsbury, Noel. Hybrid : the history and science of plant breeding. University of Chicago Press, {{ISBN|978-0-226-43704-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;From the late nineteenth century on, seed companies began to play an increasingly important, if not dominant, role in breeding non-cereal crops and a major role in producing varieties for market gardening and for private growers. The production of new cereals was a somewhat different matter - the fact that they were so vitally important for national food supplies and involved large-scale and long-term work made it more likely that they would be the concern of government. 

There were exceptions though, one being the family firm of Gartons of Warrington, Lancashire, in the north of England. Their production of cereals - oats in particular - was appreciated as internationally important during the latter quarter of the nineteenth century and the early years of the twentieth; (The American wheat breeder) [[Mark A. Carleton|Mark Carleton]] visited them in 1898 and was reportedly astonished at their work, Garton varieties were widely exported throughout the British Empire (then by far and away the world's largest political unit) and the United States.&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

"That private companies could be so effective in breeding cereal grains indicated that there was no link of necessity between their improvement and the publicly funded research that was to so dominate this sector over so much of the next century." 

In 1903 Professor [[Willet M. Hays]] (1859–1927) of the Agricultural Experiment Station in [[Minnesota]], USA said 'No one has done more brilliant work in Agricultural Plant Breeding than Messrs. Garton, and this is from now on to be recognised.'&lt;ref&gt;Page 5, 1902 Catalogue, Gartons Limited&lt;/ref&gt;

===Attempted intellectual property donation===

The introduction to their 1899 Spring Catalogue&lt;ref&gt;Introduction to Gartons Limited's Spring 1899 Seed Catalogue&lt;/ref&gt; reads: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Our original idea for the dissemination of the seed of these new breeds as the stocks became sufficiently large for the purpose, was through some public body as in the form of an annual free seed distribution upon similar lines to the free seed distributions carried out by the Governments of the United States, Canada, and several of the British Colonies. 

''On three successive occasions we approached Her Majesty's Government with this object in view, the first occasion being on the formation of the Board of Agriculture, in 1889, when we offered to hand over the whole of the valuable results, providing that body would undertake their dissemination and the continuance of the work, either in the form of an annual free seed distribution or at current market price.''

''Upon the last occasion our offer was accompanied by letters and reports from all the leading Agricultural Professors, Botanists, and Scientists in the Kingdom, setting forth the national benefit which would accrue from the dissemination of the results in the form we had suggested. The final reply of Her Majesty's Government, however, was that whilst fully recognising the value of the work, owing to there being no precedent upon which to act in such a matter, they were unable to avail themselves of the offer. This was much to be regretted for had our ideas been carried into effect the British farmer would have been placed in immediate possession of important results, which in the hands of a Public Company would not reach him for many years.''

''Our efforts in this direction not having been successful, and as we were not in a position to undertake the work of distribution ourselves, we have placed it in the lands{{verify source|reason=should that be "hands"?|date=October 2013}} of a Public Company, and we trust that the continued efforts made by us on behalf of the British farmer will be fully appreciated by him, through his support of the Company responsible for the distribution of the seed of our new breeds of agricultural plants''

''R. &amp; J. Garton''''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Crop innovations===

The firm's first historic introduction was 'Abundance' [[oat]], the world's first agricultural plant variety bred from a ''controlled'' cross, introduced to commerce in 1892.&lt;ref&gt;Spring Seed Catalogue 1899, Gartons Limited&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the other 170 crop varieties&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.mac.com/barnabymiln/Site/Gartons.html Gartons]&lt;/ref&gt; that Gartons bred and introduced to commerce were:

* 'Standwell' [[barley]], introduced in 1898,&lt;ref&gt;Seed  Catalogue 1898, Gartons&lt;/ref&gt; the first barley bred from a controlled cross. 
* 'White Monarch' [[wheat]], introduced in 1899,&lt;ref&gt;Seed Catalogue 1899, Gartons Limited&lt;/ref&gt; the first wheat bred from a controlled cross. 
* 'Invincible' barley, introduced in 1899,&lt;ref&gt;Seed Catalogue 1899, Gartons Limited&lt;/ref&gt; the first crop plant control crossed for disease resistance.
* Perennialized [[Trifolium pratense|red clover]], introduced in 1898,&lt;ref&gt;Seed Catalogue 1898, Gartons&lt;/ref&gt; the first controlled cross clover.
* Perennialized [[Lolium multiflorum|Italian ryegrass]], introduced in 1907,&lt;ref&gt;Seed Catalogue 1907, Gartons Limited&lt;/ref&gt; the first controlled cross pasture grass.
* 'Apex' [[winter wheat]], introduced in 1967,&lt;ref&gt;Seed Catalogue 1967, Gartons Limited&lt;/ref&gt; the first wheat to be granted [[plant breeders' rights]] in the United Kingdom.

===John Garton's honorary doctorate===

On 23 March 1922 the Senatus Academicus of the [[University of Edinburgh]] offered to confer the honorary doctorate of LL.D on John Garton shortly before his death, which he duly accepted.&lt;ref&gt;University of Edinburgh Senatus Academicus Printed Minutes Volume III Oct. 1920-July 1924 p.295&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Warrington Guardian 26 August 1922&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;British Medical Journal 29 July 1922 page 191&lt;/ref&gt; At its meeting on 6 July 1922 the Senatus Academicus learned that John Garton had died.&lt;ref&gt;University of Edinburgh Senatus Academicus Printed Minutes Volume III Oct. 1920-July 1924 p.332&lt;/ref&gt;

The programme and report of the Graduation Ceremony held on 21 July 1922 reads &lt;blockquote&gt; The Senatus Academicus recently conferred the Honorary Degree of Doctor of Laws upon the late John Garton, who duly accepted it. The Degree would have been formally conferred on the present occasion but for his lamented death. Mr Garton invented the process of multiple cross fertilisation of crop plants and has been the means in a great measure of revolutionising field culture by producing hundreds of new and improved varieties which have greatly increased the yields of all the common crops of the farm. The achievement proved to be of immense national importance during the War.

Mr Garton first showed that the common grain crops and many other crop plants are self-fertilising. Up till that time they were generally believed to be fertilised by wind or insects.
Mr Garton’s results got in crossing different species of grasses helped to develop the modern conception of species.

Twenty-two tears ago Mr Garton provided the means to establish the Garton Lectures on Colonial and Indian Agriculture, and subsequently he permanently endowed them as an integral part of the work of the Chair of Agriculture.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Plant breeding grounds===

The plant breeding grounds were initially at Newton-le-Willows but moved to Acton Grange, two and a half miles south west of Warrington before settling in about 1930 at Little Leigh near [[Northwich]] in [[Cheshire]]. A seed development farm was located in [[Essex]], and root crop trials were located on farms in the north of England and in [[Scotland]]. Traditionally groups of farmers were invited in mid-summer to inspect the plant breeding grounds and be entertained by the Company.

[[File:LittleLeighTrials.jpg|thumb|right]]

Initially the Seed Warehouse for cleaning and distributing seed was in [[Newton-le-Willows]] but moved to Friars Green in Warrington in 1899 by which time the offices were at Thynne Street, Warrington.&lt;ref&gt;Gartons Limited Seed Catalogue 1901&lt;/ref&gt; A purpose built seven story Seed Warehouse and separate Head Office were built at Arpley, Warrington in 1910.&lt;ref&gt;Gartons Limited Seed Catalogue 1910&lt;/ref&gt; There was an L. M. S.  railway siding into the Seed Warehouse. On 25 April 1912 the Seed Warehouse burned down&lt;ref&gt;Photograph in T.E.Miln's Newspaper Cutting Book, Miln Family Cartulary&lt;/ref&gt; but quickly rebuilt largely by the same builders. Seed cleaning machinery, some unique to the Company, ensured the purity of the product. As time went by fewer seeds were ‘picked’ or cleaned by hand by upwards of one hundred staff as machinery became more sophisticated. Across the top of roof of the warehouse was the company’s name which had to be disguised during wartime.

[[File:Gartons-Warehouse.tiff|thumb|right]]

From the beginning Gartons Limited tested its seeds for purity and germination at its own seed testing laboratories in Warrington. The [[1920 Seeds Act]], for the first time, made testing and declaring for purity and germination a legal requirement for all seed companies. The [[Official Seed Testing Station]] was created in 1917, firstly in Victoria Street in [[Westminster]], [[London]] and then in 1921 within the newly formed [[National Institute of Agricultural Botany]] in [[Cambridge]]. Larger seed companies including Gartons Limited were licensed to carry out their own purity and germination testing. 

[[File:Gartons World Records.jpg|thumb|right]]

===Commercial success and competition===

Gartons Limited was the United Kingdom’s only major agricultural plant breeding company.  But this caused them difficulties as early as in their Spring 1900 seed catalogue where a paragraph of the introduction reads: &lt;blockquote&gt; It has come to our knowledge that nearly all the New Breeds introduced by us up to the present time have been renamed by various dealers and are being offered by them under different names. Although the honesty of this conduct is more than questionable, we are resigned for the present to regard it as a novel form of flattery, but we strongly recommend all those who wish to secure our Seeds to order them direct from us, as they cannot be procured from any other genuine source. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

After the Great War (1914–1918) the United Kingdom government funded cereal breeding at the Plant Breeding Institute at Cambridge which had been founded in 1912,  and funded the setting up of plant breeding stations in Edinburgh (1921), Aberystwyth (1919) and in Glasnevin, Northern Ireland in competition with Gartons Limited.

The 1960 Report of the Committee on Transactions in Seeds set up by Parliament entitled Plant Breeders' Rights &lt;ref&gt;Her Majesty's Stationery Office Report, July 1960&lt;/ref&gt; stated that whilst two thirds of breeding work was by then carried out by government organisations, one third was in the hands of private breeders. And yet the only non-government funded agricultural crop plant breeding, research and testing establishment visited by the Committee was to Gartons Limited.&lt;ref&gt;Her Majesty's Stationery Office Report, July 1960, page 104&lt;/ref&gt; The United Kingdom's Plant Varieties and Seeds Act 1964 allowed plant breeders  to fully protect and be rewarded for their introductions. The last variety bred by Gartons, 'Apex' wheat, was the first British bred wheat to be awarded plant breeders rights in 1967 under this legislation.&lt;ref&gt;Photographs of the Gartons Warrington Warehouse and Office built in 1910, The Warrington Examiner 4 April 1931.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gartons Headquarters Plant Breeding Grounds in Cheshire, from The Warrington Examiner 4 April 1931.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chairmen and directors===

The eldest of the three Garton brothers, Robert Garton, was the first chairman of Gartons Limited. He died in February 1950, aged 91,&lt;ref&gt;Warrington Examiner, 11 February 1950&lt;/ref&gt; a widower with no children. He was succeeded by the youngest brother, Thomas R. Garton, who died in May 1956. His son, John, was chairman from August 1963 until September 1965. Dr John Garton, the middle of the three brothers, was never, a director.

Nine members of the Miln family were involved with the business over a period of seventy five years.

[[File:Three-Miln-Generations.jpg|thumb|left]]

:[[File:George-Peddie-Miln.jpg|thumb|right|George Peddie Miln]]

Born at Linlathen, [[Broughty Ferry]] in 1861,  George Peddie Miln trained in a Dundee seed warehouse, the traditional Scottish training for a young man with ambition in the seed trade. He moved to [[Chester]] and ran one of its old established seed merchants before joining Gartons Limited as its first Managing Director in 1898. He was a member of Her Majesty's Board of Agriculture Seeds Advisory Council during the first World War. Both the Seeds Act 1920 and the formation of the [[National Institute of Agricultural Botany]] came about with his considerable encouragement during his three-year presidency of the Seed Trade Association of the United Kingdom. Of his eleven children, five trained in the seed trade. He was a Justice of the Peace in the City of [[Chester]], a Fellow of the Linnean Society and a member of the Council of the Royal Agricultural Society of England. He died aged 68 following an unsuccessful operation.

When George P. Miln died in 1928 he was succeeded as managing director by his eldest son, Thomas Edward Miln (1890–1963)&lt;ref&gt;The Field, 25 November 1922&lt;/ref&gt; who for over twenty five years was chairman of the Retail Committee of the Seed Trade Association of the United Kingdom which proudly kept its independence from government control during World War II. A plant breeder as well as a businessman he is credited with the introduction of the sugar beet crop to UK agriculture. 

When Gartons Limited became a public quoted company on the London Stock Exchange in 1947 T. E. Miln entered into a further ten year employment contract as Managing Director, even though he was already 59, such was his reputation. Both his sons, Wallace and George, joined him in the business.

T. E. Miln was succeeded in 1961 by his elder son, Wallace Miln (1919–1994) also a skilled plant breeder and seed analyst.&lt;ref&gt;Warrington Guardian, 5 January 1962&lt;/ref&gt;  Wallace Miln was one of the three founders of the British Association of Plant Breeders at the time of the introduction of the United Kingdom's Plant Varieties and Seeds Act 1964. He was twice President of the Seed Trade Association of United Kingdom. He left Gartons Limited in 1973 to join his elder son, [[Barnaby Miln]], who had trained at Gartons and later with [[Northrup-King]]  in Minneapolis before setting up his own seed business at Bodenham in Herefordshire.

From 1947 Gartons Limited's shares were quoted on the London Stock Exchange.  The Company's profits for the previous seven years had averaged £48,940.&lt;ref&gt;London Corn Circular, 1 August 1947&lt;/ref&gt; In 1949 the profit of £75,340  was the highest ever recorded &lt;ref&gt;Daily Telegraph, 20 September 1949&lt;/ref&gt; by the Company.

===Decline and closure===

In 1965 Peter Darlington&lt;ref&gt;Financial Times, 16 September 1965&lt;/ref&gt; became chairman of Gartons Limited. In a dramatic change of direction in 1967 Gartons Limited ceased retailing seeds directly to farmers. Instead  a new brand was created, Gartons GROplan, and marketing became wholesale through agricultural merchants throughout the United Kingdom. However Gartons GROplan was sold to Agricultural Holdings Company Limited in 1971,&lt;ref&gt;The Times newspaper, London, Friday 2 July 1971&lt;/ref&gt; but Gartons Limited continued as a plant breeding company.

Gartons plc, as it became known, ceased trading in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;Financial Times, 19 August 1983&lt;/ref&gt; The seed warehouse at Bridge Foot, Warrington, which had dominated the town centre skyline since 1910, was demolished in October 1986.&lt;ref&gt;Warrington Guardian, 15 October 1986&lt;/ref&gt; A hotel was built on the site.

==The Garton System of Plant Breeding==

These Explanatory Notes come from the Gartons Seed Catalogue for Spring 1900:

&lt;blockquote&gt;To those who are not acquainted with the botanical construction of plants it may be well to explain that plants possess generative organs, which correspond to those of the male and female in the animal kingdom. In the animal kingdom, progeny is derived from the mating of different animals of the same breed; in the vegetable kingdom the rule is that the seed is produced through the agency of the generative organs growing together on the same plant. Prior to the commencement of the work initiated by us and carried on during the past 20 years, which has led to the production of our New and Improved Breeds of agricultural plants, it was a recognised belief that many farm plants in the production of their seed were more or less cross-fertilised. The results of our experiments however have proved that such was not the case but that constant in-and-in breeding was the rule. 

Where such in-and-in breeding takes place the results are governed by the same natural laws as the in-and-in breeding of animals. In the production of New Breeds of animals the rule followed is to mate two animals of distinct breeds. The progeny, when fixity of type has been secured, constitutes a New Breed. 

Under our system of plant breeding we carry the mating of varieties or breeds far beyond what is practised in the animal kingdom. In the first instance we mate varieties and also what were formerly regarded as distinct species of the same genera, and after fixation, the progeny by these combinations are further mated together. 

A further extension of our system which is in itself unique and instructive, is the mating of uncultivated indigenous plants of the same Natural Order as the cultivated varieties. From such combinations most valuable results have been obtained. 

For example In Southern Asia there exists a species of wheat botanically known as Triticum spelta. In some districts it is looked upon as an indigenous weed infesting the cultivated crops of wheat. 

Under no climatic conditions does the grain of this species shed its seed when ripe, and even in threshing it is not possible to separate the grains, as the spikelets break off at the bases of the glumes, the grains remaining firmly enclosed between the chaff scales. 

By mating the varieties of this species with cultivated varieties, new breeds have been produced which will under no conditions shed their seed when ripe, but which thresh out a perfectly clean sample with a much heavier yield per acre than common wheat. 

In China there is an indigenous species of oat botanically known as Avena nuda or naked oat. The peculiar feature of this species is that the grains (which are very small) grow without any husk, being protected only by the chaff. The habit of the plant is likewise quite unique, four or five grains being suspended upon a thread-like filament about half an inch long. The mating of this species with cultivated varieties has produced new breeds giving yields 50 to 100 per cent. heavier than the original cultivated parents, with a corresponding decrease in the thickness of the skin. 

The wild or land oat, Avena fatua, of Great Britain has likewise been used with marked success in the production of new breeds in conjunction with the cultivated varieties. In the wild oat there is hardiness of constitution, vigour, strength of straw, and remarkable fertility. All these qualities have been retained in the new breeds produced. 

Another part of our system is the improvement of existing varieties of agricultural plants. The method is similar to that adopted by the breeder of stock for the improvement of his animals, when fresh blood of the same breed is introduced from some other herd. 

By crossing two distinct plants of the same variety the resulting progeny is more vigorous and robust in constitution, whilst the habit and individual character of the variety is maintained.&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

'''A year later, these Explanatory Notes come from the Gartons Seed Catalogue for Spring 1901:'''

&lt;blockquote&gt;FOR over 20 years the work of cross-fertilising crop plants, with the object of producing New and Improved Breeds, has been carried on at Newton-le-Willows in Lancashire. It has there for the first time been demonstrated to Scientific Botanists as well as to Agriculturists that all the corn crops (cereals) and nearly all the other common crops of the farm are self fertilising. In other words, each individual plant provides the pollen which is required in the process of producing seed, to fertilise the female organs of its own flowers. This natural process results in a perfect system of in-breeding which has been going on for an indefinite period, making it possible to grow the different varieties of crops of the same kind in close proximity to each other, and even as mixed crops without any danger of crosses being produced. 

If crossing could have occurred in nature it would have been quite impossible to maintain the purity of any variety of crop plant for more than a year or two. As in the Animal Kingdom, the in-breeding of plants tends to the decrease of constitutional vigour, consequently when cross-fertilisation is practised the size and vigour of the selected progeny are increased in a remarkable degree.
 
Although the natural laws which govern the Animal and the Vegetable Kingdoms bear a very strong resemblance to each other, further points can be realised and greater progress can be made in a limited time with plants than with animals under a system of cross breeding. 

Not only have varieties of a given species, but what were formerly regarded as distinct species belonging to the same genus, been successfully mated. 
The tendency to sterility in their progeny is overcome by introducing pollen from one or other '01' the original plants, it being the male organs of reproduction that are liable to be absent or defective in the progeny of two extremely divergent parent plants. Many varieties as well as species can thus be blended in the formation of a new breed, but as it is necessary to secure fixity of type in every cross bred plant before it is again used for crossing, the labour and care involved are very considerable. 

Attempts at the production of first crosses are not new, as these have been practised for many years by experimenters in the same field, who however stopped short of the point at which the Garton System achieved its greatest results, viz.  by compound or multiple crossing. This further stage of the work of cross fertilisation leads to a thorough dislocation of the usual course of the law of inheritance by which "like produces like." In the wilderness of uncertainty and confusion which follows and in which the great majority of the progeny are found to be abortive or inferior, a few choice specimens appear which are grown for a number of years until fixity of type has been secured. These superior and selected specimens are adopted as suitable for cultivation, and a number of them are described in this Catalogue and offered to the public as much superior to the old varieties from which they were derived by the Garton System of Plant Breeding. In making the selections the large quantity and superior quality of the grain, together with great standing power in the straw have been the chief characteristics aimed at, and if these desiderata have been secured in a few of the new breeds to the detriment of the habit of "tillering," the difficulty is readily overcome by providing a liberal seeding.
 
Some of the most striking and valuable results have been achieved by introducing as progenitors, certain weeds belonging to the same natural order of plants as the cultivated parents. For example, an inferior variety of "spelt" wheat Triticum spelta from Southern Asia, has been employed with excellent results to introduce strength of gluten to the grain, and large yielding and standing power to the crop with immunity from shedding its seed during harvest.
 
A wild naked Oat, Avena nuda, indigenous to China has been used to produce new breeds which yield in some instances 100 per cent. more than their cultivated parents. Four or five grains are suspended in each spikelet by a thread like filament about half-an-inch long. This peculiar habit of the plant 'has been extended in the progeny and an' accompanying illustration shows a spikelet with no fewer than 14 grains in it.
 
The hardiness of constitution, standing power of straw, and remarkable fertility of the wild or land oat, Avena fatua, of Great Britain have been successfully introduced, but not without many difficulties, into some of the new breeds.
 
Some progress has also been made with the improvement of existing varieties of Agricultural plants by introducing pollen from plants of the same variety to increase the vigour of the plant without materially altering its general characteristics.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3295">'''Gender budgeting''' means preparing [[budget]]s or analysis them from a gender perspective. Also referred to as gender-sensitive budgeting, this practice does not entail dividing budgets for women. It aims at dealing with budgetary [[gender inequality]] issues, including gender hierarchies and the discrepancies between women's and men's salaries.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002316/231646e.pdf|title=A Guide for Gender Equality in Teacher Education Policy and Practices|last=UNESCO|first=|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=978-92-3-100069-0|location=|pages=72–75}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gender budgeting allows governments to promote equality through fiscal policies by taking analyses of a budget's differing impacts on the sexes as well as setting goals or targets for equality and allocating funds to support those goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2017/03/economist-explains-2|title=What is gender budgeting?|work=The Economist|access-date=2017-10-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Main activities ==
Three principal activities have been recognized as gender budgeting sensitive:
# At the institutional level, the goal is to understand policies promoted by governmental institutions and how these affect gender inequalities within a specific society.
# Analysis of the institutional budget, in order to see whether [[gender mainstreaming]] activities are included.
# Planning as well as implementing a gender-based budget that will focus on gender-related issues.
Point 3 most likely includes the restructuration of the existing budget to deal with gender-related issues.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Gender budget analysis ==
Gender budget analysis aims at finding out whether women and men have can access the same opportunities equally. In gender budget analysis, gaps are addressed so that those who are disadvantaged become empowered. A gender-sensitive budget analysis contains how budgets recognize and answer the needs of men and women, whether they are children, young or adults.&lt;ref&gt;Balmori, H. H. 2003.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4921">'''Giovan Antonio Rusconi''' (c. 1500-05; † 1578) was a [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] [[architect]], [[Hydraulic engineering|hydraulic engineer]], translator and illustrator of [[Vitruvius]].

== Life ==
[[File:Della architettvra (1590) (14769861931).jpg|thumbnail|''Della Architettvra''. Illustration.]]
Apart from being introduced into building and painting young Antonio Rusconi studied [[mathematics]] at the [[University of Padua]] under [[Giovanni Battista Memmo]] and [[Niccolò Tartaglia]]. Extensively consulting Vitruvius’ [[De architectura|"Ten Books on Architecture"]] while he was constructing a novel type of [[watermill]] Antonio became aware of many grave technical errors within the work’s early Renaissance editions and commentaries. Finally [[Pietro Lauro]], who had rendered [[Leon Battista Alberti|Leon Battista Alberti’s]] “De Architectura” into the vernacular, convinced Rusconi to set out with a translation of his own. The text was finished until 1552 and illustrated with more than three hundred supplementary [[woodcut]]s. Earlier, Rusconi had already provided the illustrations for [[Lodovico Dolce|Lodovico Dolce’s]] version of the [[Metamorphoses|Ovidian “Metamorphoses”]].
Yet, since then countless treatises on architecture and commentaries on [[Vitruvius]] (e.g. by [[Daniele Matteo Alvise Barbaro|Daniele Barbaro]], [[Giacomo Barozzi da Vignola|Gicaomo Vignola]] and [[Andrea Palladio]]) were being published, Rusconi’s Venetian editors, [[:de:Gabriele Giolito de’ Ferrari|Giolito]] and [[Tommaso Porcacchi]], saw no benefit in printing another title on the subject.
Together with [[Andrea Palladio|Palladio]] Rusconi draughted the [[Brescia#Piazza della Loggia|"Palazzo municipale" (Brescia)]] in 1562, they also took part in rebuilding the [[Doge's Palace]] after the fire of 1577 and constructing the [[Palazzo Grimani di Santa Maria Formosa|Palazzo Grimani]]. Nevertheless throughout his life Rusconi’s main occupation was that of a [[Hydraulic engineering|hydraulic engineer]] for the [[Republic of Venice]]. After having fallen gravely ill in 1575 Giovan Antonio died in 1579.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Anna Bedon, ''Giovan Antonio Rusconi: illustratore di Vitruvio, artista, ingegnere, architetto'', in: ''Della Architettura di Gio''[van]''Antonio Rusconi'', Centro Internazionale di Studi di Architettura Andrea Palladio di Vicenza, Testi e fonti per la storia dell’architettura, Verona, Vicenza 1996, pp. IX–XXI; Louis Cellauro, ''La biblioteca di un architetto del Rinascimento la raccolta di libri di Giovanni Antonio Rusconi'', in: Arte Veneta 58 (2001), pp. 224–237.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rusconi's "Della Architettura" ==
Rusconi’s “Vitruvius” was only printed after his death in 1590 by the son of his former editor [[:de:Gabriele Giolito de’ Ferrari|Giolito]]. Although the latter recognised the value of Giovan Antonio’s [[woodcut|xylographies]] he considered his translation and annotations as outdated, and thus a strange “Vitruvius without Vitruvius“ was published:&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Bedon 1996, p. XII: „questa strana edizione vitruviana senza Vitruvio, senza traduzione, senza autore.“&lt;/ref&gt; Just about 160 of originally 300 [[woodcut]]s were compiled with extracts from [[Giovanni Giocondo|Fra Giocondo’s]] and [[Cesare Cesariano|Cesariano’s]] translations of [[De architectura|Vitruvius’ treatise]]. For many of Rusconi’s illustrations containing references to textual explanations, it is particularly regrettable that his translation has hence been lost.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Thomas Reiser, ''Giovan Antonio Rusconi (1515/20–1579)'', in: ''Firmitas et Splendor. Vitruv und die Techniken des Wanddekors'', ed. by Erwin Emmerling, [[:de:Andreas Grüner|Andreas Grüner]] et al., Munich 2014 (Studien aus dem Lehrstuhl für Restaurierung, [[Technische Universität München]], Fakultät für Architektur) {{ISBN|978-3-935643-62-7}}, pp. 269-276.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''genomic epidemiological database for global identification of microorganisms''' or '''global microbial identifier (GMI) '''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=GMI|title=Global Microbial Identifier|url=http://www.g-m-i.org/About.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a platform for storing [[whole genome sequencing]] (WGS) data of [[microorganisms]], for the identification of relevant [[genes]] and for the comparison of [[genomes]] to detect and track-and-trace [[infectious disease]] outbreaks and emerging [[pathogens]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schlundt|first=J|title=The time is right for a global genomic database for microorganisms|journal=Health Diplomacy Monitor|year=2011|volume=3|issue=2|pages=2–3|url=http://www.ghd-net.org/sites/default/files/Health%20Diplomacy%20Monitor%20Volume%203%20Issue%202.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The database holds two types of information: 1) genomic information of [[microorganisms]], linked to, 2) [[metadata]] of those microorganism such as [[epidemiological]] details. The database includes all genera of microorganisms: [[bacteria]], [[viruses]], [[parasites]] and [[fungi]].

== Technology ==

For [[genotype|genotyping]] of microorganisms for [[medical diagnosis]], or other purposes, scientists may use a wide variety of [[DNA profiling]] techniques, such as [[PCR]], [[PFGE]] and [[MLST]]. A complication of this broad variety of pre-WGS techniques is the difficulty to standardize between techniques, laboratories and microorganisms, which may be overcome using the complete [[DNA]] code of the genome generated by WGS techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shendure|first=J|title= Next-generation DNA sequencing|journal=Nat. Biotechnol.|year=2008|volume=26|issue=10|pages=1135–1145|doi=10.1038/nbt1486|pmid=18846087}}&lt;/ref&gt; For straight forward diagnostic identification the WGS information of a microbiological sample is fed into a global genomic database and compared using [[BLAST]] procedures to the genomes already present in the database.&lt;ref name="X"&gt;{{cite web|title=genomic epidemiology database|url=http://www.genomicepidemiology.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, WGS data may be used to back calculate to the different pre-WGS genotyping methods, so previous collected valuable information is not lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Inouye|first=M|title=Short read sequence typing (SRST):multi-locus sequence types from short reads|journal=BMC Genomics|year=2012|volume=13|pages=388|doi=10.1186/1471-2164-13-338|pmid=22827703|pmc=3460743|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Larsen|first=MV|title=Multilocus sequence typing of total-genome-sequenced bacteria|journal=J Clin Microbiol|year=2012|volume=50|pages=1355–1366|doi=10.1128/JCM.06094-11|pmid=22238442|issue=4|pmc=3318499|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the global microbial identifier the genomic information is coupled to a wide spectrum of metadata about the specific microbial clone and includes important clinical and [[Epidemiology|epidemiological]] information such as the global finding place(s), treatment options and [[antimicrobial resistance]], making it a general microbiological identification tool.This makes [[Personalized medicine|personalized treatment]] of microbial disease possible as well as real-time tracing systems for global surveillance of [[infectious diseases]] for [[food safety]] and serving [[human health]].

== The initiative ==

The initiative for building the database arose in 2011 and when several preconditions were met : 1) WGS has become mature and serious alternative for other genotyping techniques,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zankari|first=E|title=Genotyping using whole-genome sequencing is a realistic alternative to surveillance based on phenotypic antimicrobial susceptibility testing|journal=J Antimicrob Chemother|year=2013|pmid=23233485|doi=10.1093/jac/dks496|volume=68|issue=4|pages=771–7|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dunne|first=WM|title= Next-generation and whole-genome sequencing in the diagnostic clinical microbiology laboratory|journal=Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis|year=2012|volume=31|issue=8|pages=1719-17126|doi=10.1007/s10096-012-1641-7|pmid=22678348|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2) the price of WGS has started falling dramatically and in some cases below the price of traditional identifications, 3) vast amounts of [[Information technology|IT]] resources and a fast [[Internet]] have become available, and 4) there is the idea that via a cross sectoral and [[One Health]] approach infectious diseases may be better controlled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Current Topics in Microbiology and Immunology, Vol 366|title=One Health: The Human-Animal-Environment Interfaces in Emerging Infectious Diseases|year=2013|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-540-70961-9|pages=280|url=https://www.springer.com/biomed/virology/book/978-3-642-35845-6?detailsPage=authorsAndEditors#|editor=Mackenzie, J.S. |editor2=Jeggo, M. |editor3=Daszak, P. |editor4=Richt, J}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Wielinga, PR |author2=Schlundt, J |title=Food Safety: At the Center of a One Health Approach for Combating Zoonoses |journal=Curr Top Microbiol Immunol|year=2013|pmid=22763857|doi=10.1007/82_2012_238|pages=3–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting the second millennium, many microbiological laboratories, as well as national health institutes, started genome sequencing projects for sequencing the infectious agents collections they had in their [[biobanks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= A summary of genomic databases|title= Bacterial genome databases|url= http://phobos.ramapo.edu/~pbagga/binf/binf_res/bioinfo_gndb_bact.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= WGS projects info by EBI|title= WGS projects|url= http://www.ebi.ac.uk/genomes/wgs.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thereby generating private databases and sending model genomes to global nucleotide databases such as [[GenBank]] of the [[National Center for Biotechnology Information|NCBI]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= Genome Browser NCBI|title= Genome information by organism |url= https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/browse/}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the nucleotide database of the [[EMBL]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= Genome Browser EMBL|title= Access to Completed Genomes|url= http://www.ebi.ac.uk/genomes/}}&lt;/ref&gt; This created a wealth of genomic information and independent databases for [[List of sequenced eukaryotic genomes|eukaryotic]] as well as [[List of sequenced bacterial genomes|prokaryotic]] genomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= Microbial Genomes Database|title=MBGD|url= http://mbgd.genome.ad.jp/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Other genomic databases via EBI|url= http://www.ebi.ac.uk/2can/databases/genomic2.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= DOE's Joint Genome Institute Integrated Microbial Genomes (IMG) |title= IMG DOEs JGI|url=http://img.jgi.doe.gov/cgi-bin/w/main.cgi}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The need to further integrate these databases and to harmonize data collection, and to link the genomic data to metadata for optimal prevention of infectious diseases, was generally recognized by the scientific community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Aarestrup|first=F|title=Integrating Genome-based Informatics to Modernize Global Disease Monitoring, Information Sharing, and Response|journal=Emerg Infect Dis|year=2012|volume=18|issue=11|pages=e1|doi=10.3201/eid/1811.120453|pmid=23092707|pmc=3559169|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, several infectious disease control centers and other organizations took the initiative of a series of international scientific- and policy-meetings, to develop a common platform and to better understand the potentials of an interactive microbiological genomic database. The first meeting was in Brussels, September 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kupferschmidt|first=K|title=Epidemiology.

The '''Idiap Research Institute''' is a semi-private non-profit [[research institute]] at [[Martigny]] in the [[Cantons of Switzerland|canton]] of [[Valais]], in south-western Switzerland. It conducts research in the areas of [[speech processing]], [[computer vision]], [[information retrieval]], [[Biometrics|biometric authentication]], [[multimodal interaction]] and [[machine learning]]. The institute is affiliated with the [[École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne]] (EPFL), and with the [[Université de Genève]].&lt;ref name=esv&gt;[http://esv2000.edi.admin.ch/f/entry.asp?Id=2048 Fondation de l'Institut de Recherche Idiap (Foundation of the Idiap Research Institute)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140913145657/http://esv2000.edi.admin.ch/f/entry.asp?Id=2048 |date=13 September 2014 }} (in French).

==History==

The institute was founded as the Istituto Dalle Molle di Intelligenza Artificiale Percettiva ({{lang-fr|{{noitalic|Institut Dalle Molle d'intelligence artificielle perceptive}}}}) in 1991 by the Italian entrepreneur [[Angelo Dalle Molle]] through the [[Fondation Dalle Molle]], in collaboration with the [[École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne]] and with local, cantonal and federal government bodies. Its purpose was to investigate the application of [[artificial intelligence]] to human perception in general, and to recognition and analysis of patterns in particular. In 1996, with the participation of the town of [[Martigny]], the [[canton of Valais]], the EPFL, the [[University of Geneva]] and [[Swisscom]], it became a research foundation independent of the Dalle Molle foundation, and shortly after changed its name to Idiap Research Institute.&lt;ref name=fond3&gt;[http://www.dallemolle.ch/en/the-institutes/idiap-research-institute Research Institute Idiap, Martigny]. Fondation Dalle Molle. Accessed September 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Idiap is one of the four Swiss research organisations founded by the Dalle Molle foundation, of which three are in the field of artificial intelligence.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7082">An '''interference [[Fit (manufacturing)|fit]]''', also known as a '''press fit''' or '''friction fit'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Principles and design of mechanical face seals | author = Alan O. Lebeck | page = 232 | publisher = Wiley-Interscience | year = 1991 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=RnOZ4zl6CRMC&amp;pg=PA232&amp;dq=%22Friction+fit%22+%22interference+fit%22+%22press+fit%22&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Friction%20fit%22%20%22interference%20fit%22%20%22press%20fit%22&amp;f=false | isbn = 978-0-471-51533-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is a fastening between two parts which is achieved by [[friction]] after the parts are pushed together, rather than by any other means of fastening.

A press fit is also required to  mount [[wheel]]s on an [[axle]] to make a [[Wheel set (rail transport)|wheel set]].

== Introducing interference between parts ==
These fits, though applicable to shaft and hole assembly, are more often used for bearing-housing or bearing-shaft assembly.

== Tightness of fit ==
The tightness of fit is controlled by amount of interference; the [[Allowance (engineering)|allowance]] (planned difference from nominal size). Formulas exist &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.engineersedge.com/calculators/machine-design/press-fit/press-fit-calculator.htm |website= www.engineersedge.com|title=Press Fit Engineering and Design Calculator|access-date=2017-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; to compute allowance that will result in various strengths of fit such as loose fit, light interference fit, and interference fit. The value of the allowance depends on which material is being used, how big the parts are, and what degree of tightness is desired. Such values have already been worked out in the past for many standard applications, and they are available to engineers in the form of [[Table (information)|table]]s, obviating the need for re-derivation.

As an example, a {{convert|10|mm|in|3|abbr=on}} shaft made of 303 [[stainless steel]] will form a tight fit with allowance of 3–10 [[µm]] (0.0001–0.0003 in). A [[slip fit]] can be formed when the bore diameter is 12–20 µm (0.0005–0.0008 in) wider than the rod; or, if the rod is made 12–20 µm under the given bore diameter. {{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

An example:
The allowance per inch of diameter usually ranges from 0.001 inch to 0.0025 inch (0.1–0.25%), 0.0015 inch (0.15%) being a fair average. Ordinarily the allowance per inch decreases as the diameter increases; thus the total allowance for a diameter of 2 inches (50.8 mm) might be 0.004 inch (0.102 mm, 0.2%), whereas for a diameter of 8 inches (203.2 mm) the total allowance might not be over 0.009 or 0.010 inch (0.23 or 0.25 mm, ''i.e.'' 0.11–0.12%). The parts to be assembled by forced fits are usually made cylindrical, although sometimes they are slightly tapered. Advantages of the taper form are: the possibility of abrasion of the fitted surfaces is reduced; less pressure is required in assembling; and parts are more readily separated  when renewal is required. On the other hand, the taper fit is less reliable, because if it loosens, the entire fit is free with but little axial movement. Some lubricant, such as [[white lead]]  and [[lard]] oil mixed to the consistency of paint, should be applied to the pin and bore before assembling, to reduce the tendency toward abrasion.{{citation needed|reason= this is word-for-word from Machinery's Handbook.|date=August 2016}}

== Assembling ==
There are two basic methods for assembling an oversize shaft into an undersized hole, sometimes used in combination: force and thermal expansion or contraction.

=== Force ===
There are at least three different terms used to describe an interference fit created via force: '''press fit''', '''friction fit''', and hydraulic dilation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Improving machinery reliability | author = Heinz P. Bloch | page = 216 | edition = 3rd | publisher = Gulf Professional Publishing | year = 1998 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=pBhKQu8WwL8C&amp;pg=PA216&amp;dq=%22Friction+fit%22+%22interference+fit%22&amp;cd=2#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Friction%20fit%22%20%22interference%20fit%22&amp;f=false | isbn = 978-0-88415-661-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emerson-ept.com/EPTRoot/kopflex/Engineered/FAQ/design.htm |title=Coupling Design and Selection |accessdate=2010-01-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090926142345/http://www.emerson-ept.com/eptroot/kopflex/Engineered/FAQ/design.htm |archivedate=2009-09-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Press fit is achieved with presses that can press the parts together with very large amounts of force. The presses are generally [[Hydraulic press|hydraulic]], although small hand-operated presses (such as [[arbor press]]es) may operate by means of the mechanical advantage supplied by a [[jackscrew]] or by a gear reduction driving a [[rack and pinion]]. The amount of force applied in hydraulic presses may be anything from a few pounds for the tiniest parts to hundreds of tons for the largest parts.

Often the edges of shafts and holes are [[chamfer]]ed (beveled). The chamfer forms a guide for the pressing movement, helping to distribute the force evenly around the circumference of the hole, to allow the compression to occur gradually instead of all at once, thus helping the pressing operation to be smoother, to be more easily controlled, and to require less power (less force at any one instant of time), and to assist in aligning the shaft parallel with the hole it is being pressed into. In the case of [[Wheelset (rail transport)|train wheelsets]] the [[train wheel|wheels]] are pressed onto the [[axle]]s by force.

=== Thermal expansion or contraction ===
Most materials expand when [[heat]]ed and shrink when cooled. Enveloping parts are heated (e.g., with torches or gas ovens) and assembled into position while hot, then allowed to cool and contract back to their former size, except for the compression that results from each interfering with the other. This is also referred to as [[shrink-fitting]]. Railroad axles, wheels, and [[railway tire|tires]] are typically assembled in this way. Alternatively, the enveloped part may be cooled before assembly such that it slides easily into its mating part. Upon warming, it expands and interferes. Cooling is often preferable as it is less likely than heating to change material properties, e.g., assembling a hardened gear onto a shaft, where the risk exists of heating the gear too much and drawing its [[tempering (metallurgy)|temper]].

Practices in [[language education]] vary significantly by region. Firstly, the languages being learned differ; in the [[United States]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]] is the most popular language to be learned, whereas the most popular languages to be learned in [[Australia]] are [[Italian language|Italian]] and [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin Chinese]]. Also, [[Methods of teaching foreign languages|teaching methods]] tend to differ by region. [[Language immersion]] is popular in some European countries, but is not used very much in the [[United States]].

==Europe==

===Foreign language education===
1995 [[European Commission]]’s White Paper "Teaching and learning – Towards the learning society", stated that "upon completing initial training, everyone should be proficient in two Community foreign languages". The Lisbon Summit of 2000 defined languages as one of the five key skills.

In fact, even in 1974, at least one foreign language was compulsory in all but two European member states: [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] and the [[United Kingdom]] (apart from [[Scotland]]). By 1998 nearly all pupils in [[Europe]] studied at least one foreign language as part of their compulsory education, the only{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} exception being the Republic of Ireland, where primary and secondary schoolchildren learn both [[Irish language|Irish]] and [[English language|English]], but neither is considered a foreign language although a third European language is also taught. Pupils in upper secondary education learn at least ''two'' foreign languages in [[Belgium]], [[France]], [[Denmark]], [[Netherlands]], [[Germany]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Finland]], [[Sweden]], [[Iceland]], [[Switzerland]], [[Greece]], [[Croatia]], [[Cyprus]], [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], [[Poland]], [[Romania]], [[Serbia]], [[Slovenia]] and [[Slovakia]].

On average in Europe, at the start of foreign language teaching, pupils have lessons for three to four hours a week. Compulsory lessons in a foreign language normally start at the end of [[primary school]] or the start of [[secondary school]]. In Luxembourg, [[Norway]], [[Italy]] and [[Malta]], however, the first foreign language starts at age six, in [[Sweden]] at age seven and in Belgium at age 10. About half of the EU's primary school pupils learn a foreign language.

English is the language taught most often at lower secondary level in the EU. There, 93% of children learn English. At upper secondary level, English is even more widely taught. [[French language|French]] is taught at lower secondary level in all EU countries except [[Slovenia]]. A total of 33% of European Union pupils learn French at this level. At upper secondary level the figure drops slightly to 28%. [[German language|German]] is taught in nearly all EU countries. A total of 13% of pupils in the European Union learn German in lower secondary education, and 20% learn it at an upper secondary level.

Despite the high rate of foreign language teaching in schools, the number of adults claiming to speak a foreign language is generally lower than might be expected. This is particularly true of native English speakers: in 2004 a [[United Kingdom|British]] survey{{which|date=November 2010}} showed that only one in 10 [[United Kingdom|UK]] workers could speak a foreign language. Less than 5% could count to 20 in a second language, for example. 80% said they could work abroad anyway, because "everyone speaks English." In 2001, a European Commission survey{{which|date=November 2010}} found that 65.9% of people in the UK spoke only their native tongue.

Since the 1990s, the [[Common European Framework of Reference for Languages]] has tried to standardize the learning of languages across Europe (one of the first results being [[UNIcert]]).

===Bilingual education===
{{Main|Bilingual education}}

In some countries, learners have lessons taken entirely in a foreign language: for example, more than half of European countries with a [[minority language|minority]] or [[regional language]] community use partial immersion to teach both the minority and the state language.

In the 1960s and 1970s, some central and eastern European countries created a system of bilingual schools for well-performing pupils. Subjects other than languages were taught in a foreign language. In the 1990s this system was opened to all pupils in general education, although some countries still make candidates sit an entrance exam. At the same time, Belgium's French community, [[France]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Austria]] and [[Finland]] also started bilingual schooling schemes. [[Germany]] meanwhile had established some bilingual schools in the late 1960s.

==United States==
{{main|Language education in the United States}}
In most school systems, foreign language is taken in [[high school]], with many schools requiring one to three years of foreign language in order to graduate. In some school systems, foreign language is also taught during middle school, and recently, many elementary schools have begun teaching foreign languages as well. However, foreign language immersion programs are growing in popularity, making it possible for elementary school children to begin serious development of a second language.

In 2008 the Center for Applied Linguistics conducted an extensive survey documenting foreign language study in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cal.org/content/download/2241/29054/version/2/file/ForeignLanguageExecutiveSummary.pdf|title=Foreign Language Teaching in U.S. Schools: Results of a National Survey|last1=Rhodes|first1=Nancy C.|last2=Pufahl|first2=Ingrid|publisher=Center for Applied Linguistics|date=November 2009|accessdate=7 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most popular language is [[Spanish language|Spanish]], due to the large number of recent Spanish-speaking immigrants to the United States (see [[Spanish in the United States]]). According to this survey, in 2008 88% of language programs in elementary schools taught Spanish, compared to 93% in secondary schools. Other languages taught in U.S. high schools in 2008, in descending order of frequency, were [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], [[Latin language|Latin]], [[Standard Mandarin|Mandarin Chinese]], [[American Sign Language]], [[Italian language|Italian]], and [[Japanese language|Japanese]]. During the [[Cold War]], the United States government pushed for [[Russian language|Russian]] education, and some schools still maintain their Russian programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2005/0405/p11s02-legn.html|title=You learned Russian - in high school?|last=Méndez|first=Theresa|date=5 April 2005|publisher=The Christian Science Monitor|accessdate=7 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other languages recently gaining popularity include [[Arabic language|Arabic]]. The Center for Applied Linguistics also conducted a study that concluded that while the number of schools from the elementary to secondary level offering foreign language instruction are on the rise, a pitfall of the curriculum is that students are not becoming proficient in the target languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pufahl|first=Ingrid|title=What We Can Learn From Foreign Language Teaching In Other Countries|url=http://www.cal.org/resources/digest/0106pufahl.html|publisher=Center for Applied Linguistics|accessdate=8 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers also note that American students of foreign languages significantly underperform in comparison to their European and Asian counterparts.  It has been suggested that a system where foreign language instruction is required from PK-12 should be implemented in order to fix this problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cognitive Benefits of Learning Language|url=http://www.actfl.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=4724|publisher=Online Newsletter for Parents of Gifted Youth|accessdate=8 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Australia==
Prior to European colonisation, there were hundreds of [[Australian Aboriginal languages|Aboriginal languages]], taught in a traditional way. The arrival of a substantial number of [[Irish language|Irish]] in the first English convict ships meant that European Australia was not ever truly monolingual. When the [[Australian gold rushes|gold rushes]] of the 1850s trebled the white population, it brought many more [[Welsh language|Welsh]] speakers, who had their own language newspapers through to the 1870s, but the absence of language education meant that these Celtic languages never flourished.

Waves of [[Post-war immigration to Australia|European migration after World War II]] brought "community languages," sometimes with schools. However, from 1788 until modern times it was generally expected that immigrants would learn English and abandon their first language.&lt;ref&gt;Clyne, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;{{broken citation|date=March 2011}} The wave of [[Multiculturalism in Australia|multicultural policies]] since the 1970s has softened aspects of these attitudes.

In 1982 a bipartisan committee of Australian parliamentarians was appointed and identified a number of guiding principles that would support a National Policy on Languages (NPL). Its trend was towards bilingualism in all Australians, for reasons of fairness, diversity and economics.

In the 1990s the Australian Languages and Literacy Policy (ALLP) was introduced, building on the [https://books.google.com/books/about/National_Policy_on_Languages.html?id=IGIcAQAAIAAJ NPL], with extra attention being given to the economic motivations of second language learning. A distinction became drawn between priority languages and community languages. The ten priority languages identified were [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]], [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], [[Modern Greek]], [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Korean language|Korean]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Australian Aboriginal languages|Aboriginal languages]].

However, Australia's federal system meant that the NPL and ALLP direction was really an overall policy from above without much engagement from the states and territories. The NALSAS strategy united Australian Government policy with that of the states and territories. It focused on four targeted languages: Mandarin, Indonesian, Japanese and Korean. This would be integrated into studies of Society and Environment, English and Arts.

By 2000, the top ten languages enrolled in the final high school year were, in descending order: Japanese, French, German, Chinese, Indonesian, Italian, Greek, Vietnamese, Spanish and Arabic. In 2002, only about 10% of Year 12 included at least one [[Languages other than English|language other than English]] (LOTE) among their course choices.
In 2009, Lo Bianco and Slaughter, recommended a new approach, stating that “What is needed is a universal apprenticeship in learning how to learn languages”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Second Languages and Australian Schooling | author=Lo Bianco, J | year=2009 | publisher=Australian Council for Educational Research}}&lt;/ref&gt; An apprenticeship language is a relatively easy language which is taught to overcome the limitations of monolingualism, in preparation for later mastery of a different language or languages. 

Reasons to use an apprenticeship language are:{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}

* To make a start when target language teachers are unavailable.
* To master a whole foreign language, for motivation and effective subsequent learning.
* To combat procrastination in the face of diverse priorities in Language education.
* To normalize bilingualism and promote flexibility.
* To model creative problem solving, ethical behaviour and global citizenship.

A resource and method has been devised to implement the ALL approach by equipping generalist primary (elementary) teachers to teach the simple designed language [[Esperanto]] as a [[Propaedeutic value of Esperanto|first, fluent, intercultural, foreign language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Talking to the Whole Wide World: Integrated LOTE and Intercultural Studies for Australian Primary Schools | author=Vos, P | year=2010 | publisher=Mondeto}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The professional body for teachers of foreign languages in Australia is the [[Australian Federation of Modern Language Teachers Associations]].

==Hong Kong==
Native [[Cantonese]]-speaking Hong Kong children commence learning English and maybe also [[Mandarin_Chinese|Mandarin]] from age 3 when they go to kindergarten and continue until they finish their secondary education.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} The [[Hong Kong government]]'s language policy is to produce people who are [[biliterate]] in English and [[Written Chinese]] and [[trilingual]] in Cantonese, Mandarin and English. In order to enter university in Hong Kong, students must pass both English and Chinese exams, or in the case of those who did not learn Chinese at school, due to having studied at an [[international school]], another foreign language.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

==United Kingdom==

Since 2014 it has been compulsory for [[primary school]] children to be taught at least one language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-15135560 |title=BBC News - Teach foreign languages from age five, says Gove |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=October 1, 2011 |accessdate=February 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lepkowska |first=Dorothy |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/schools/an-innovative-scheme-is-helping-primary-teachers-brush-up-their-language-skills-2230676.html |title=An innovative scheme is helping primary teachers brush up their language skills - Schools - Education |publisher=The Independent |date=March 3, 2011 |accessdate=February 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-26713090&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004 it was no longer compulsory for secondary school pupils to have to study a foreign language at GCSE level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Richardson |first=Hannah |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-12243936 |title=BBC News - Gove: 'Door open' for compulsory foreign language GCSE |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=January 20, 2011 |accessdate=February 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; A pivotal difference between [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and the other [[Linux kernel]]-based operating systems is the [[C standard library]]: Android's [[Bionic (software)|libbionic]] is different in that it does not aim to support [[POSIX]] to the same extent as the other libraries. With the help of [[Hybris (software)|libhybris]] it is possible to run Android-only software on other Linux kernel based operating systems, as long as this software does not depend on subsystems found only in the Android-forked Linux kernel, such as binder, pmem, ashmem, etc. Whether software programmed for Linux can run on Android, depends entirely on the extent to which libbionic matches the API of the [[GNU C Library|glibc]].

&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;tt&gt;[[libinput]]&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wiki.x.org/wiki/Events/XDC2014/XDC2014HuttererLibInput/ |title=Peter Hutterer - Consolidating the input stacks with libinput |date=2014-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; provides device detection via [[udev]], device handling, input device event processing and abstraction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=libinput|url=http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/libinput/|publisher=Freedesktop.org|accessdate=2014-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''libinput'' also provides a generic [[X.Org Server|X.Org]] input driver.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://cgit.freedesktop.org/xorg/driver/xf86-input-libinput |title=xf86-input-libinput}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''libinput'' support was first merged in Weston 1.5. and is also used by Mutter.

'''Master Polikarp's Dialog with Death''' (Polish: '''''Rozmowa Mistrza Polikarpa ze Śmiercią''''', Latin: '''''De morte prologus, Dialogus inter Mortem et Magistrum Polikarpum''''') is a late [[Middle Ages|medieval]] dialog in verse, written probably in the early 15th century. Master Polikarp's Dialog with Death is now regarded as one of the most important examples of [[medieval poetry]] in the [[Polish language]]. The work is patterned after a 12th century [[Latin]] poem ''Dialogus mortis cum homine'', and other Latin language publications, popular in medieval Europe. Its author is unknown, but after discovering the complete, printed version from 1542 some [[historian]]s speculate that [[Mikołaj Rej]] has re-written the original text for print.

One of the unique features of the work is its use of [[humour]]. The dialog mocks monks and priests, inn-keepers, fat women, dishonest physicians and unjust judges.

== Versions ==

The original version of the [[dialogue]] has been lost; what remains is an incomplete copy from ca. 1463-1465, belonging to Mikołaj of Mirzyniec (Mikołaj z Mirzyńca). The ending of the work was known due to its 16th century [[Russian language|Russian]] [[translation]]. It has 498 lines, and presents everyday life scenes of members of different social classes of 15th century [[Poland]].

An unknown printed edition of ''Rozmowa Mistrza Polikarpa ze Śmiercią'' (''Master Polikarp’s Dialogue with Death'') from 1542 (Cracow, Maciej [[Scharffenberg family|Scharffenberg]]) has been discovered in one of the European university libraries.&lt;ref name="a"&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://instytutksiazki.pl/en/news,2,professor-wydra%E2%80%99s-great-discovery,1307.html | |title=Professor Wydra’s Great Discovery | publisher = The Polish Book Institute | date= July 3, 2018 | access-date=November 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The discovery was made by Professor Wiesław Wydra from the Institute of Polish Philology at [[Adam Mickiewicz University]] in [[Poznań]].&lt;ref name="a"/&gt; In the contrast to the previously known version of the dialogue from the Płock manuscript, this text has been preserved in its entirety.&lt;ref name="a"/&gt; This discovery, with a complete Polish text of 918 verses, makes it the biggest and the most important event in Polish language and literature scholarship for several decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=https://www.thefirstnews.com/article/full-text-of-polish-literatures-oldest-masterpiece-found-1138 | title=Full text of Polish literature’s oldest masterpiece found | last=Nowacki | first = Aleksander | publisher = The first news | date= July 14, 2018 | access-date=November 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The critical edition of the discovered text has been published by prof.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3245">The '''Media Dispatch Protocol''' (MDP) was developed by the [[Pro-MPEG]] Media Dispatch Group to provide an open standard for secure, automated, and tapeless delivery of audio, video and associated data files. Such files typically range from low resolution content for the web to [[Hdtv|HDTV]] and high-resolution digital intermediate files for cinema production.

MDP is essentially a [[middleware]] protocol that decouples the technical details of how delivery occurs from the business logic that requires delivery. For example, a TV post-production company might have a contract to deliver a programme to a broadcaster.  An MDP [[Software agent|agent]] allows users be able to deal with company and programme names, rather than with filenames and network endpoints. It can also provide a delivery service as part of a [[Service-oriented architecture|service oriented architecture]].

MDP acts as a communication layer between business logic and low-level file transfer mechanisms, providing a way to securely communicate and negotiate transfer-specific metadata about file packages, delivery routing, deadlines, and security information, and to manage and coordinate file transfers in progress, whilst hooking all this information to project, company and job identifiers.

MDP works by implementing a 'dispatch transaction' layer by which means agents negotiate and agree the details of the individual file transfers required for the delivery, and control, monitor and report on the progress of the transfers. At the heart of the protocol is the 'Manifest' - an XML document that encapsulates the information about the transaction.

MDP is based on existing open technologies such as [[XML]], [[HTTP]] and [[Transport Layer Security|TLS]]. The protocol is specified in a layered way to allow the adoption of new technologies (e.g. [[Web Services]] protocols such as [[Simple Object Access Protocol|SOAP]] and [[Web Services Description Language|WSDL]]) as required.

Since early 2005, multiple implementations based on draft versions of the Media Dispatch Protocol have been in use, both for technical testing, and, since April 2005, for real-world production work. The experience with these implementations, both at the engineering level, and at the practical production level, has been rolled into the 1.0rcX specification. 

A newer, and more complete, open-source reference implementation is now available on [[Sourceforge|SourceForge]].

Media Dispatch Protocol (MDP) has been standardized by a [[SMPTE]] Working Group under the S22 Committee. This work has been published as SMPTE 2032-1-2007 (MDP specification), 2032-2-2007 (MDP/[[XML]]/[[HTTP]] mapping specification) and 2032-3-2007 (MDP Target pull profile specification). MDP is also supported by [[SMPTE]] Engineering Guideline EG 2032-4-2007 covering the use of MDP.

== MaB-flocs ==

[[Microalgae]] do not settle by [[gravity]], therefore expensive [[harvesting]] techniques must be applied. This is a major bottleneck of microalgal technology. [[Bioflocculation]] of microalgae and [[bacteria]] addresses this.

MaB-flocs or '''M'''icro'''a'''lgal '''B'''acterial flocs settle by gravity, up to density of 20 g per liter. This is a major improvement for microalgal technology for [[wastewater treatment]].

Currently, MaB-flocs are being applied for [[sewage treatment]] on lab and pilot scale in [[Germany]], [[New Zealand]] and [[Belgium]].  The idea is to scavenge [[nutrient]]s such as [[nitrogen]] and [[phosphorus]] from the [[wastewater]], sometimes combined with [[flue gas]] treatment.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5171">In cognitive psychology, the '''missing letter effect''' refers to the finding that, when people are asked to [[consciously]] detect target letters while reading text, they miss more letters in frequent, function words (e.g. the letter "h" in "the") than in less frequent, content words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The effect is usually measured using a paper-and-pencil procedure, where readers are asked to circle a target letter every time they come across it while reading a short passage.  The missing letter effect is more likely to appear when reading words that are part of a normal sequence, than when words are embedded in a mixed-up sequence (e.g. readers asked to read backwards).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Two primary hypotheses tried to explain the missing letter effect: [[Alice F. Healy|Healy]] (1994) emphasized identification processes playing a crucial role, almost entirely focusing on word frequency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

A new model called the guidance-organization model was recently proposed to potentially explain the missing letter effect. It is a combination of the two models proposed by Healy, Koriat, and Greenberg.  As Greenberg et al. explain: "The time spent processing high-frequency function words at the whole-word level is relatively short, thereby enabling the fast and early use of these words to build a tentative structural frame."&lt;ref&gt;

A '''motor soft starter''' is a device used with [[AC motor|AC electrical motor]]s to temporarily reduce the load and [[torque]] in the [[power train]] and electric current surge of the motor during start-up. This reduces the [[mechanical stress]] on the motor and shaft, as well as the [[electrodynamics|electrodynamic]] stresses on the attached power cables and [[electricity distribution|electrical distribution network]], extending the lifespan of the system.&lt;ref name=Siskind&gt;{{cite book | first=Charles S. | last=Siskind | author link= | year=1963 | title=Electrical Control Systems in Industry | edition= | publisher=McGraw-Hill, Inc. | location=New York | isbn= 0-07-057746-3 | page=150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It can consist of mechanical or electrical devices, or a combination of both. Mechanical soft starters include [[clutch]]es and several types of [[coupling]]s using a [[fluid coupling|fluid]], magnetic forces, or steel [[Lead shot|shot]] to transmit torque, similar to other forms of [[torque limiter]]. Electrical soft starters can be any control system that reduces the torque by temporarily reducing the [[voltage]] or [[electric current|current]] input, or a device that temporarily alters how the motor is connected in the [[electric circuit]].
[[File:Digital Soft Starter with Motor Protection and In Built By Pass.jpg|thumb|Digital Soft Starter]]
Across-the line starting of induction motors is accompanied by inrush currents up to 7-10 times higher than running current, and starting torque up to 3 times higher than running torque. The increased torque results in sudden mechanical stress on the machine which leads to a reduced service life. Moreover, the high inrush current stresses the power supply, which may lead to voltage dips. As a result, lifespan  of sensitive equipment may be reduced.&lt;ref name="Siskind" /&gt;

A soft starter eliminates the undesired side effects. Several types based on control of the supply voltage or mechanical devices such as slip clutches were developed. The list provides an overview of the various electric start-up types. The current and torque characteristic curves show the behavior of the respective starter solution.
Torque surges entail high mechanical stress on the machine, which results in higher service costs and increased wear. High currents and current peaks lead to high fixed costs charged by the power supply companies (peak current calculation) and to increased mains and generator loads.

A soft starter continuously controls the three-phase motor’s voltage supply during the start-up phase. This way, the motor is adjusted to the machine’s load behavior. Mechanical operating equipment is accelerated smoothly. This lengthens service life, improves operating behavior, and smooths work flows. Electrical soft starters can use [[solid state (electronics)|solid state]] devices to control the [[Electric current|current]] flow and therefore the voltage applied to the motor. They can be connected in [[series circuits|series]] with the line voltage applied to the motor, or can be connected inside the delta (Δ) loop of a [[Y-Δ transform|delta-connected motor]], controlling the voltage applied to each winding. Solid state soft starters can control one or more [[three-phase electric power|phases]] of the voltage applied to the induction motor with the best results achieved by three-phase control. Typically, the voltage is controlled by reverse-[[parallel circuits|parallel]]-connected [[silicon-controlled rectifier]]s ([[thyristor]]s), but in some circumstances with three-phase control, the control elements can be a reverse-parallel-connected SCR and [[diode]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://machinedesign.com/engineering-essentials/soft-starters|title= Soft starters |publisher=machinedesign.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another way to limit motor starting current is a series [[inductor|reactor]].  If an air core is used for the series reactor then a very efficient and reliable soft starter can be designed which is suitable for all types of 3 phase induction motor [ synchronous / asynchronous ] ranging from 25 kW 415 V to 30 MW 11 kV.  Using an air core series reactor soft starter is very common practice for applications like pump, compressor, fan etc.  Usually high starting torque applications do not use this method.

==Applications==
Soft starters can be set up to the requirements of the individual application. In pump applications, a soft start can avoid pressure surges. Conveyor belt systems can be smoothly started, avoiding jerk and stress on drive components. Fans or other systems  with belt drives can be started slowly to avoid belt slipping. Soft starts are seen in electrical R/C helicopters, and allow the rotor blades to spool-up in a smooth, controlled manner rather than a sudden surge. In all systems, a soft start limits the inrush current and so improves stability of the power supply and reduces transient voltage drops that may affect other loads.

'''NAR 1''' or just '''NAR''' ([[Serbian language|Serbian]] '''Na'''stavni '''R'''ačunar, [[English language|en.]] ''Educational Computer'') was a theoretical model of a computer created by Faculty of Mathematics of [[University of Belgrade]] professor [[Nedeljko Parezanović]] (In Serbian:Недељко Парезановић).  It was used for [[Assembly language]] and [[Computer architecture]] courses.

==Specifications==
NAR 1 [[Central Processing Unit|processor]] has a 5-[[bit]] [[address bus]] (32 [[byte]]s of addressable memory) and 8-bit [[Bus (computing)|data bus]]. [[machine language|Machine]] [[instruction (computer science)|instruction]]s were single-byte with three [[most significant bit]]s specifying the [[opcode]] and 5 [[least significant bit]]s the parameter - [[memory address]]. A single 8-bit [[Accumulator (computing)|accumulator register]] was available and there were no [[Flag (computing)|flags or flag registers]]. Only [[Addressing mode#Absolute|absolute addressing mode]] was available and all others were achieved by [[self-modifying code]]. 

Even though this is only a theoretical computer the following physical characteristics were given:

* Memory cycle: 1μs
* Arithmetic operation (SABF) cycle: 0.9μs (900ns)
* Control panel facilitates power on and off, memory data entry and readout, instruction counter entry and selection of either program execution mode or control panel mode.

==Instruction coding and set==
* '''SABF''' (001aaaaa, [[Serbian language|sr.]] '''Sab'''eri u '''F'''iksnom zarezu, [[English language|en.]] Add Fixed point) loads the content of memory location specified by the address parameter, adds it to the current value of the accumulator and stores the result into the accumulator
* '''PZAF''' (010xxxxx, [[Serbian language|sr.]] '''P'''romeni '''Z'''nak '''A'''kumulatora u '''F'''iksnom zarezu, [[English language|en.]] Change the sign of the accumulator in fixed point) Negates the fixed point (such as integer) value in the accumulator
* '''AUM''' (011aaaaa, [[Serbian language|sr.]] '''A'''kumulator '''U''' '''M'''emoriju, [[English language|en.]] Accumulator Into Memory) stores the content of the accumulator into memory location specified by the address parameter
* '''MUA''' (100aaaaa, [[Serbian language|sr.]] '''M'''emorija '''U''' '''A'''kumulator, [[English language|en.]] Memory Into Accumulator) loads the content of memory location specified by the address parameter into the accumulator
* '''NES''' (101aaaaa, [[Serbian language|sr.]] '''Ne'''gativni '''S'''kok, [[English language|en.]] Negative Jump) performs a [[Branch (computer science)|conditional jump]] to the address specified by the parameter if the current value of the accumulator is negative
* '''ZAR''' (110xxxxx, [[Serbian language|sr.]] '''Za'''ustavi '''R'''ačunar, [[English language|en.]] Stop the Computer) stops any further processing.

Two more instructions were not specified but were commonly present in simulators and took instruction codes 000aaaaa and 111aaaaa:
* '''BES''' ([[Serbian language|sr.]] '''Be'''zuslovni '''S'''kok, [[English language|en.]] Unconditional Jump) performs an [[Jump instruction|unconditional jump]] to the address specified by the parameter
* '''NUS''' ([[Serbian language|sr.]] '''Nu'''la-'''S'''kok, [[English language|en.]] Zero Jump) performs a [[Branch (computer science)|conditional jump]] to the address specified by the parameter if the current value of the accumulator is zero

==Example programs==
A sample program that sums up an array of 8-bit integers:

&lt;source lang="nasm"&gt;
00:     0         ; input: 0 or value 22, output: result
01..21: 0,0,0...  ; input: values 1..21
22:     MUA  0    ; Start of program; Load accumulator from address 0
23:     SABF 1    ; Add value from address 1 to accumulator
24:     AUM  0    ; Store accumulator to address 0
25:     MUA  23   ; Load instruction at address 23 (SABF)
26:     SABF 31   ; Add value from address 31 (+1) to accumulator
27:     AUM  23   ; Store accumulator to address 23 (modifies SABF instruction)
28:     SABF 30   ; Add value from address 30 to accumulator
29:     NES  22   ; Jump back to 22 if accumulator value is negative
30:     ZAR  10   ; Stop the computer. Argument makes this byte have the value of -(SABF 22) = -54.
31:     1         ; Value to add to address in each iteration
&lt;/source&gt;

Above program adds up to 22 8-bit values if executed from address 22:
* Values 1-21 stored at locations 1-21
* Value 22 stored at location 0, instead of the constant 0 and will be replaced by the result

NAR 1 programs are commonly self-modifying. Unlike in some other architectures, this is not a 'trick'. As memory can not be addressed by a register, the only way to dynamically manipulate memoory data is to modify memory manipulation instructions. Above example also contains a typical trick to save memory - instruction (at address 30) is reused as data by another instruction (at address 28).

If initial accumulator value can be controlled from the control pane, a 23rd value can be stored in it. Above program has to be only slightly modified - instruction SABF 1 at address 23 has to be changed to SABF 0 and the program should be executed from that address (23) and not from 22.

Other tricks included the use of the changes of the sign after instruction is modified, as shown in the following example:

&lt;source lang="nasm"&gt;
00..21: 0,0,0...  ; input values 22 to 1
22:     0         ; input: 0 or value 23, output: result
23:     MUA  21   ; start of program; Load (next) value
24:     SABF 22   ; Add subtotal at 22 to accumulator
25:     AUM  22   ; Store new subtotal to 22
26:     MUA  23   ; Load instruction 23 into accumulator
27:     SABF 31   ; Decrement instruction by 1
28:     AUM  23   ; Update instruction
29:     NES  23   ; Repeat if the instruction is still negative
30:     ZAR       ; Otherwise, stop the computer
31:     -1        ; Constant needed for instruction at 27
&lt;/source&gt;

Here the instruction "MUA 21" at address 23 has the binary value 10010101, which is -107 decimal when treated like signed integer in [[two's complement]]. Instructions at addresses 26, 27 and 28 decrement this value by 1 in each iteration. This will modify the 5 least significant bits specifying the address and will not touch the three bits indicating the instruction until that instruction becomes MUA 0 (10000000 binary = -128 decimal, negative). Once this is decremented by one it becomes 01111111 (+127 decimal) which is no longer negative and will cause the jump-if-negative instruction at 29 to pass, proceeding to "stop the computer" at 30.

Similarly to above, this program can add between 22 and 24 values, depending on whether address 22 can be used for both input and output and whether initial value of the accumulator can be used as input (the program should then be executed from address 24 and instruction at 23 should be MUA 22).

If particular implementation stops the computer if it encounters an unknown opcode or it implements additional unconditional jump instruction with opcode "111aaaaa", then such behaviour can be used as follows:

&lt;source lang="nasm"&gt;
00..22: 0,0,0...  ; input values 23 to 1
23:     0         ; input: 0 or value 24, output: result
24:     MUA  22   ; start of program; Load (next) value
25:     SABF 23   ; Add subtotal at 23 to accumulator
26:     AUM  23   ; Store new subtotal to 23
27:     MUA  24   ; Load instruction 24 into accumulator
28:     SABF 31   ; Decrement instruction by 1
29:     AUM  24   ; Update instruction
30:     NES  24   ; Repeat if the instruction is still negative
31:     -1        ; BES 31 or invalid instruction &amp; constant for instruction at 28
&lt;/source&gt;

Above, the value of "-1" found at address 31 can either be treated as invalid instruction causing the computer to stop or as unconditional jump (BES 31) to the same address, resulting in infinite loop that does not affect the result (control panel can be used to display it).

Finally, depending on whether it is decided that a computer will stop program execution if it reaches the end of memory (address 31, will not roll back to address 0), above program can be reorganized to take one value more by eliminating the need for "stop the computer" instruction altogether, as follows:

&lt;source lang="nasm"&gt;
00..22: 0,0,0...  ; input values 23 to 1
23:     0         ; input: 0 or value 24, output: result
24:     -1        ; Constant needed for instruction at 29
25:     MUA  22   ; start of program; Load (next) value
26:     SABF 23   ; Add subtotal at 23 to accumulator
27:     AUM  23   ; Store new subtotal to 23
28:     MUA  25   ; Load instruction 25 into accumulator
29:     SABF 24   ; Decrement instruction by 1
30:     AUM  25   ; Update instruction
31:     NES  25   ; Repeat if the instruction is still negative
; ------------- end of memory
&lt;/source&gt;

==Trivia==
* Word "nar" means [[Teaching computer model]]
* Many NAR 1 simulators were created. One was named "Šljiva" ([[English language|en.]] ''[[plum]]'') as that fruit grows in [[Serbia]], while "nar" does not.
* One of frequently given task was to create a program that adds as many numbers as possible, having those numbers stored in 32-byte memory along with the program.
* Some assembly language protocols are derived from the NAR1 khulil code

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="75410">{{short description|control loop feedback mechanism}}
A '''proportional–integral–derivative controller''' ('''PID controller''' or '''three-term controller''') is a [[control loop]] [[feedback mechanism]] widely used in [[industrial control system]]s and a variety of other applications requiring continuously modulated control. A PID controller continuously calculates an ''error value'' &lt;math&gt;e(t)&lt;/math&gt; as the difference between a desired [[Setpoint (control system)|setpoint]] (SP) and a measured [[process variable]] (PV) and applies a correction based on [[Proportional control|proportional]], [[integral]], and [[derivative]] terms (denoted ''P'', ''I'', and ''D'' respectively), hence the name.

In practical terms it automatically applies accurate and responsive correction to a control function. An everyday example is the [[cruise control]] on a car, where external influences such as hills (gradients) would decrease speed. The PID algorithm restores from current speed to the desired speed in an optimal way, without delay or overshoot, by controlling the power output of the vehicle's engine. 

The first theoretical analysis and practical application was in the field of automatic steering systems for ships, developed from the early 1920s onwards. It was then used for automatic process control in manufacturing industry, where it was widely implemented in pneumatic, and then electronic, [[Controller (control theory)|controllers]]. Today there is universal use of the PID concept in applications requiring accurate and optimised automatic control.

==Fundamental operation==
[[File:PID en.svg|thumb|400x400px|A [[block diagram]] of a PID controller in a feedback loop. ''r''(''t'') is the desired process value or setpoint (SP), and ''y''(''t'') is the measured process value (PV).]] 
The distinguishing feature of the PID controller is the ability to use the three ''control terms'' of proportional, integral and derivative influence on the controller output to apply accurate and optimal control. The block diagram on the right shows the principles of how these terms are generated and applied. It shows a PID controller, which continuously calculates an ''error value'' &lt;math&gt;e(t)&lt;/math&gt; as the difference between a desired [[Setpoint (control system)|setpoint]]&lt;math&gt;\text{SP} = r(t)&lt;/math&gt; and a measured [[process variable]] &lt;math&gt;\text{PV} = y(t)&lt;/math&gt;, and applies a correction based on [[proportional control|proportional]], [[integral]], and [[derivative]] terms. The controller attempts to minimize the error over time by adjustment of a ''control variable'' &lt;math&gt;u(t)&lt;/math&gt;, such as the opening of a [[control valve]], to a new value determined by a [[weighted sum]] of the control terms.

In this model:
* Term '''P''' is proportional to the current value of the SP − PV error ''e''(''t''). For example, if the error is large and positive, the control output will be proportionately large and positive, taking into account the gain factor "K". Using proportional control alone in a process with compensation such as temperature control, will result in an error between the setpoint and the actual process value, because it requires an error to generate the proportional response. If there is no error, there is no corrective response.
* Term '''I''' accounts for past values of the SP − PV error and integrates them over time to produce the ''I'' term. For example, if there is a residual SP − PV error after the application of proportional control, the integral term seeks to eliminate the residual error by adding a control effect due to the historic cumulative value of the error. When the error is eliminated, the integral term will cease to grow. This will result in the proportional effect diminishing as the error decreases, but this is compensated for by the growing integral effect.
* Term '''D''' is a best estimate of the future trend of the SP − PV error, based on its current rate of change. It is sometimes called "anticipatory control", as it is effectively seeking to reduce the effect of the SP − PV error by exerting a control influence generated by the rate of error change. The more rapid the change, the greater the controlling or dampening effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.eolss.net/ebooks/Sample%20Chapters/C18/E6-43-03-03.pdf | title = PID Control | last = Araki | first = M. | ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Tuning''' – The balance of these effects is achieved by "loop tuning" (see later) to produce the optimal control function. The tuning constants are shown below as "K" and must be derived for each control application, as they depend on the response characteristics of the complete loop external to the controller. These are dependent on the behaviour of the measuring sensor, the final control element (such as a control valve), any control signal delays and the process itself. Approximate values of constants can usually be initially entered knowing the type of application, but they are normally refined, or tuned, by "bumping" the process in practice by introducing a setpoint change and observing the system response. 

'''Control action''' – The mathematical model and practical loop above both use a "direct" control action for all the terms, which means an increasing positive error results in an increasing positive control output for the summed terms to apply correction. However, the output is called "reverse" acting if it is necessary to apply negative corrective action. For instance, if the valve in the flow loop was 100–0% valve opening for 0–100% control output – meaning that the controller action has to be reversed. Some process control schemes and final control elements require this reverse action. An example would be a valve for cooling water, where the [[fail-safe]] mode, in the case of loss of signal, would be 100% opening of the valve; therefore 0% controller output needs to cause 100% valve opening.

===Mathematical form===
The overall control function can be expressed mathematically as
:&lt;math&gt;u(t) = K_\text{p} e(t) + K_\text{i} \int_0^t e(t') \,dt' + K_\text{d} \frac{de(t)}{dt},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;K_\text{p}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;K_\text{i}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;K_\text{d}&lt;/math&gt;, all non-negative, denote the coefficients for the [[proportional control|proportional]], [[integral]], and [[derivative]] terms respectively (sometimes denoted ''P'', ''I'', and ''D'').

In the ''standard form'' of the equation (see later in article), &lt;math&gt;K_\text{i}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;K_\text{d}&lt;/math&gt; are respectively replaced by &lt;math&gt;K_\text{p}/T_\text{i}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;K_\text{p} T_\text{d}&lt;/math&gt;; the advantage of this being that &lt;math&gt;T_\text{i}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;T_\text{d}&lt;/math&gt; have some understandable physical meaning, as they represent the integration time and the derivative time respectively.

===Selective use of control terms===
Although a PID controller has three control terms, some applications use only one or two terms to provide the appropriate control. This is achieved by setting the unused parameters to zero and is called a PI, PD, P or I controller in the absence of the other control actions. PI controllers are fairly common, since derivative action is sensitive to measurement noise, whereas the absence of an integral term may prevent the system from reaching its target value.

===Applicability===
The use of the PID algorithm does not guarantee [[optimal control]] of the system or its [[Nyquist stability criterion|control stability]] {{See below |Limitations of PID control}}. Situations may occur where there are excessive delays: the measurement of the process value is delayed, or the control action does not apply quickly enough.  In these cases [[Lead–lag compensator|lead–lag compensation]] is required to be effective. The response of the controller can be described in terms of its responsiveness to an error, the degree to which the system [[overshoot (signal)|overshoots]] a setpoint, and the degree of any system oscillation. But the PID controller is broadly applicable, since it relies only on the response of the measured process variable, not on knowledge or a model of the underlying process.

==History==
[[File:Scross helmsman.jpg|thumb|Early PID theory was developed by observing the actions of [[helmsmen]] in keeping a vessel on course in the face of varying influences such as wind and sea state.]]
[[File:Pneumatische regelaar.jpg|thumb|Pneumatic PID (Three term) controller. The magnitude of the "three terms" P, I and D are adjusted by the dials at the top.]]
===Origins===
Continuous control, before PID controllers were fully understood and implemented, has one of its origins in the [[centrifugal governor]] which uses rotating weights to control a process. This had been invented by [[Christian Huygens]] in the 17th century to regulate the gap between [[millstone]]s in [[windmill]]s depending on the speed of rotation, and thereby compensate for the variable speed of grain feed.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Hills|first=Richard L|title=Power From the Wind|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Adaptive Control Processes: A Guided Tour |author=Richard E. Bellman |publisher=Princeton University Press |date=December 8, 2015 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iwbWCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA36&amp;dq=%22Centrifugal+Governor%22+Huygens&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjq8cC3uaHPAhWCmBoKHR2OCqwQ6AEIPjAH#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Centrifugal%20Governor%22%20Huygens&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the invention of the low-pressure, stationary steam engine there was a need for automatic speed control, and [[James Watt]]’s self-designed, "conical pendulum" governor, a set of revolving steel balls attached to a vertical spindle by link arms, came to be an industry standard. This was based on the mill stone gap control concept.&lt;ref name="ben96"/&gt;

Rotating governor speed control, however, was still variable under conditions of varying load, where the shortcoming of what is now known as proportional control alone was evident. The error between the desired speed and the actual speed would increase with increasing load. In the 19th century the theoretical basis for the operation of governors was first described by [[James Clerk Maxwell]] in 1868 in his now-famous paper ''On Governors''. He explored the mathematical basis for control stability, and progressed a good way towards a solution, but made an appeal for mathematicians to examine the problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=J. C. |last=Maxwell |authorlink=James Clerk Maxwell |title=On Governors |date=1868 |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society |volume=100 |issue= |pages= |url=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b1/On_Governors.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ben96"/&gt;  The problem was examined further by [[Edward Routh]] in 1874, [[Jacques Charles François Sturm|Charles Sturm]] and in 1895, [[Adolf Hurwitz]], who all contributed to the establishment of control stability criteria.&lt;ref name="ben96"/&gt;
In practice, speed governors were further refined, notably by American scientist [[Willard Gibbs]], who in 1872 theoretically analysed Watt’s conical pendulum governor.

About this time, the invention of the [[Whitehead torpedo]] posed a control problem which required accurate control of the running depth. Use of a depth pressure sensor alone proved inadequate, and a pendulum which measured the fore and aft pitch of the torpedo was combined with depth measurement to become the [[pendulum-and-hydrostat control]]. Pressure control provided only a proportional control which, if the control gain was too high, would become unstable and go into overshoot, with considerable instability of depth-holding. The pendulum added what is now known as derivative control, which damped the oscillations by detecting the torpedo dive/climb angle and thereby the rate of change of depth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Newpower |first=Anthony |title=Iron Men and Tin Fish: The Race to Build a Better Torpedo during World War II |publisher=Praeger Security International |year=2006 |isbn=0-275-99032-X}} p.&amp;nbsp; citing {{citation |first=Edwyn |last=Gray |title=The Devil's Device: Robert Whitehead and the History of the Torpedo |location=Annapolis, MD |publisher=U.S. Naval Institute |date=1991 |page=33 |ref=none}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This development (named by Whitehead as  "The Secret" to give no clue to its action) was around 1868.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Sleeman |first=C.

Another early example of a PID-type  controller was developed by [[Elmer Sperry]] in 1911 for ship-steering, though his work was intuitive rather than mathematically-based.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.building-automation-consultants.com/building-automation-history.html |title=A Brief Building Automation History |accessdate=2011-04-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708104028/http://www.building-automation-consultants.com/building-automation-history.html |archivedate=2011-07-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was not until 1922, however, that a formal control law for what we now call PID or three-term control was first developed using theoretical analysis, by [[Russian American]] engineer [[Nicolas Minorsky]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Minorsky |first=Nicolas |authorlink=Nicolas Minorsky |title=Directional stability of automatically steered bodies |journal=J. Amer. Soc. Naval Eng. |year=1922 |volume=34 |pages=280–309 |issue=2 |ref=harv |postscript= &lt;!--None--&gt; |doi=10.1111/j.1559-3584.1922.tb04958.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Minorsky was researching and designing automatic ship steering for the US Navy and based his analysis on observations of a [[helmsman]]. He noted the helmsman steered the ship based not only on the current course error, but also on past error, as well as the current rate of change;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bennett|1993|loc = [https://books.google.com/books?id=VD_b81J3yFoC&amp;pg=PA67 p. 67]}}&lt;/ref&gt; this was then given a mathematical treatment by Minorsky.&lt;ref name="ben96"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
His goal was stability, not general control, which simplified the problem significantly. While proportional control provided stability against small disturbances, it was insufficient for dealing with a steady disturbance, notably a stiff gale (due to [[#Steady-state error|steady-state error]]), which required adding the integral term. Finally, the derivative term was added to improve stability and control.

Trials were carried out on the [[USS New Mexico (BB-40)|USS ''New Mexico'']], with the controllers controlling the ''[[angular velocity]]'' (not angle) of the rudder. PI control yielded sustained yaw (angular error) of ±2°. Adding the D element yielded a yaw error of ±1/6°, better than most helmsmen could achieve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Navy ultimately did not adopt the system due to resistance by personnel. Similar work was carried out and published by several others in the 1930s.

===Industrial control===
[[File:Nozzle and flapper proportional controller.png|thumb|Proportional control using nozzle and flapper high gain amplifier and negative feedback]]
The wide use of feedback controllers did not become feasible until the development of wide band high-gain amplifiers to use the concept of negative feedback. This had been developed in telephone engineering electronics by [[Harold Black]] in the late 1920s, but not published until 1934.&lt;ref name="ben96"/&gt; Independently, Clesson E Mason of the Foxboro Company in 1930 invented a wide-band pneumatic controller by combining the [[nozzle and flapper]] high-gain pneumatic amplifier, which had been invented in 1914, with negative feedback from the controller output. This dramatically increased the linear range of operation of the nozzle and flapper amplifier, and integral control could also be added by the use of a precision bleed valve and a bellows generating the Integral term. The result was the "Stabilog" controller which gave both proportional and integral functions using feedback bellows.&lt;ref name="ben96"/&gt; Later the derivative term was added by a further bellows and adjustable orifice. 

From about 1932 onwards, the use of wideband pneumatic controllers increased rapidly in a variety of control applications. Compressed air was used both for generating the controller output, and for powering the process modulating device; such as a diaphragm operated [[control valve]].  They were simple low maintenance devices which operate well in a harsh industrial environment, and did not present an explosion risk in [[Electrical equipment in hazardous areas|hazardous locations]]. They were the industry standard for many decades until the advent of discrete electronic controllers and [[distributed control system]]s.

With these controllers, a pneumatic industry signalling standard of {{cvt|3|-|15|psi|bar|1}} was established, which had an elevated zero to ensure devices were working within their linear characteristic and represented the control range of 0-100%.

In the 1950s, when high gain electronic amplifiers became cheap and reliable, electronic PID controllers became popular, and 4–20 mA [[current loop]] signals were used which emulated the pneumatic standard. However field actuators still widely use the pneumatic standard because of the advantages of pneumatic motive power for [[control valves]] in process plant environments.
[[File:Analogue control loop evolution.png|thumb|Showing the evolution of analogue control loop signalling from the pneumatic to the electronic eras.]]
[[File:Smart current loop positioner.png|thumb|Current loops used for sensing and control signals. A modern electronic "smart" [[control valve|valve positioner]] is shown, which will incorporate its own PID controller.]]

Most modern PID controls in industry are implemented in [[distributed control system]]s (DCS), [[programmable logic controller]]s (PLCs), computer-based controllers or as a [[compact controller]]. Software implementations have the advantages that they are relatively cheap and flexible with respect to the implementation of the PID algorithm in a particular control scenario.

===Electronic analogue controllers===
Electronic analog PID control loops were often found within more complex electronic systems, for example, the head positioning of a [[disk drive]], the power conditioning of a [[power supply]], or even the movement-detection circuit of a modern [[seismometer]]. Discrete electronic analogue controllers have been largely replaced by digital controllers using [[microcontrollers]] or [[FPGA]]s to implement PID algorithms. However, discrete analog PID controllers are still used in niche applications requiring high-bandwidth and low-noise performance, such as laser-diode controllers.&lt;ref name="Toptica"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.toptica.com/fileadmin/user_upload/Articles_Application_Notes/toptica_AP_1012_laser_locking_2012.pdf|last = Neuhaus|first = Rudolf|authorlink = |title = Diode Laser Locking and Linewidth Narrowing|work = |accessdate = June 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Control loop example==
{{Further information|Control system}}
Let's take the example of a [[robotic arm]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ee.hacettepe.edu.tr/~solen/ELE356/exp1.pdf|title=Position control system|publisher=Hacettepe University Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering}}&lt;/ref&gt;, that can be moved and positioned by a control loop. An [[electric motor]] may lift or lower the arm, depending on forward or reverse power applied, but power cannot be a simple function of position because of the [[Mass#Inertial mass|inertial mass]] of the arm, forces due to gravity, external forces on the arm such as a load to lift or work to be done on an external object.
* The sensed position is the [[process variable]] (PV).
* The desired position is called the setpoint (SP).
* The difference between the PV and SP is the error (e), which quantifies whether the arm is too low or too high and by how much.
* The input to the process (the [[electric current]] in the motor) is the output from the PID controller. It is called either the manipulated variable (MV) or the control variable (CV).

By measuring the position (PV), and subtracting it from the setpoint (SP), the error (e) is found, and from it the controller calculates how much electric current to supply to the motor (MV).

===Proportional===
The obvious method is '''proportional''' control: the motor current is set in proportion to the existing error. However, this method fails if, for instance, the arm has to lift different weights: a greater weight needs a greater force applied for a same error on the down side, but a smaller force if the error is on the upside. That's where the integral and derivative terms play their part.

===Integral===
An '''integral''' term increases action in relation not only to the error but also the time for which it has persisted. So, if applied force is not enough to bring the error to zero, this force will be increased as time passes. A pure "I" controller could bring the error to zero, however, it would be both slow reacting at the start (because action would be small at the beginning, needing time to get significant) and brutal (the action increases as long as the error is positive, even if the error has started to approach zero).

===Derivative===
A '''derivative''' term does not consider the error (meaning it cannot bring it to zero: a pure D controller cannot bring the system to its setpoint), but the rate of change of error, trying to bring this rate to zero. It aims at flattening the error trajectory into a horizontal line, damping the force applied, and so reduces overshoot (error on the other side because too great applied force). Applying too much impetus when the error is small and decreasing will lead to overshoot. After overshooting, if the controller were to apply a large correction in the opposite direction and repeatedly overshoot the desired position, the output would [[oscillate]] around the setpoint in either a constant, growing, or decaying [[sine wave|sinusoid]]. If the amplitude of the oscillations increase with time, the system is unstable. If they decrease, the system is stable. If the oscillations remain at a constant magnitude, the system is [[marginal stability|marginally stable]].

===Control damping===
In the interest of achieving a controlled arrival at the desired position (SP) in a timely and accurate way, the controlled system needs to be [[critically damped]]. A well-tuned position control system will also apply the necessary currents to the controlled motor so that the arm pushes and pulls as necessary to resist external forces trying to move it away from the required position. The setpoint itself may be generated by an external system, such as a [[programmable logic controller|PLC]] or other computer system, so that it continuously varies depending on the work that the robotic arm is expected to do. A well-tuned PID control system will enable the arm to meet these changing requirements to the best of its capabilities.

===Response to disturbances===
If a controller starts from a stable state with zero error (PV = SP), then further changes by the controller will be in response to changes in other measured or unmeasured inputs to the process that affect the process, and hence the PV. Variables that affect the process other than the MV are known as disturbances. Generally controllers are used to reject disturbances and to implement setpoint changes. A change in load on the arm constitutes a disturbance to the robot arm control process.

===Applications===
In theory, a controller can be used to control any process which has a measurable output (PV), a known ideal value for that output (SP) and an input to the process (MV) that will affect the relevant PV. Controllers are used in industry to regulate [[temperature]], [[pressure]], [[force]], [[feed rate]],&lt;ref name="Kebriaei et. al. 2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kebriaei|first=Reza|author2=Frischkorn, Jan |author3=Reese, Stefanie |author4=Husmann, Tobias |author5=Meier, Horst |author6=Moll, Heiko |author7= Theisen, Werner |title=Numerical modelling of powder metallurgical coatings on ring-shaped parts integrated with ring rolling|journal=Material Processing Technology|volume=213|issue=1|pages=2015–2032|accessdate=1 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Volumetric flow rate|flow rate]], chemical composition (component [[concentration]]s), [[weight]], [[position (vector)|position]], [[speed]], and practically every other variable for which a measurement exists.

==PID controller theory==
:''This section describes the parallel or non-interacting form of the PID controller. For other forms please see the section [[#Alternative nomenclature and PID forms|Alternative nomenclature and PID forms]].''

The PID control scheme is named after its three correcting terms, whose sum constitutes the manipulated variable (MV). The proportional, integral, and derivative terms are summed to calculate the output of the PID controller. Defining &lt;math&gt;u(t)&lt;/math&gt; as the controller output, the final form of the PID algorithm is
:&lt;math&gt;u(t) = \mathrm{MV}(t) = K_\text{p} e(t) + K_\text{i} \int_0^t e(\tau) \,d\tau + K_\text{d} \frac{de(t)}{dt},&lt;/math&gt;

where
: &lt;math&gt;K_\text{p}&lt;/math&gt; is the proportional gain, a tuning parameter,
: &lt;math&gt;K_\text{i}&lt;/math&gt; is the integral gain, a tuning parameter,
: &lt;math&gt;K_\text{d}&lt;/math&gt; is the derivative gain, a tuning parameter,
: &lt;math&gt;e(t) = \mathrm{SP} - \mathrm{PV}(t)&lt;/math&gt; is the error (SP is the setpoint, and PV(''t'') is the process variable),
: &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is the time or instantaneous time (the present),
: &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; is the variable of integration (takes on values from time 0 to the present &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;).

Equivalently, the transfer function in the [[Laplace transform|Laplace domain]] of the PID controller is
:&lt;math&gt;L(s) = K_\text{p} + K_\text{i}/s + K_\text{d} s,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; is the complex frequency.

===Proportional term===
[[File:PID varyingP.jpg|right|thumb|320px|Response of PV to step change of SP vs time, for three values of ''K''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; (''K''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; and ''K''&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; held constant)]]

The proportional term produces an output value that is proportional to the current error value. The proportional response can be adjusted by multiplying the error by a constant ''K''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;, called the proportional gain constant.

The proportional term is given by
:&lt;math&gt;P_\text{out} = K_\text{p} e(t).&lt;/math&gt;

A high proportional gain results in a large change in the output for a given change in the error. If the proportional gain is too high, the system can become unstable (see [[#Loop tuning|the section on loop tuning]]). In contrast, a small gain results in a small output response to a large input error, and a less responsive or less sensitive controller. If the proportional gain is too low, the control action may be too small when responding to system disturbances. Tuning theory and industrial practice indicate that the proportional term should contribute the bulk of the output change.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

====Steady-state error====

Because a non-zero error is required to drive it, a proportional controller generally operates with a so-called ''steady-state error''.{{efn|The only exception is where the target value is the same as the value obtained when the proportional gain is equal to zero.}} Steady-state error (SSE) is proportional to the process gain and inversely proportional to proportional gain. SSE may be mitigated by adding a compensating [[biasing|bias term]] to the setpoint AND output, or corrected dynamically by adding an integral term.

===Integral term===
[[File:Change with Ki.png|right|thumb|320px|Response of PV to step change of SP vs time, for three values of ''K''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; (''K''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; and ''K''&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; held constant)]]

The contribution from the integral term is proportional to both the magnitude of the error and the duration of the error. The [[integral]] in a PID controller is the sum of the instantaneous error over time and gives the accumulated offset that should have been corrected previously. The accumulated error is then multiplied by the integral gain (''K''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;) and added to the controller output.

The integral term is given by
:&lt;math&gt;I_\text{out} = K_\text{i} \int_0^t e(\tau) \,d\tau.&lt;/math&gt;

The integral term accelerates the movement of the process towards setpoint and eliminates the residual steady-state error that occurs with a pure proportional controller. However, since the integral term responds to accumulated errors from the past, it can cause the present value to [[overshoot (signal)|overshoot]] the setpoint value (see [[#Loop tuning|the section on loop tuning]]).

===Derivative term===
[[File:Change with Kd.png|right|thumb|320px|Response of PV to step change of SP vs time, for three values of ''K''&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; (''K''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; and ''K''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; held constant)]]

The derivative of the process error is calculated by determining the slope of the error over time and multiplying this rate of change by the derivative gain ''K''&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;. The magnitude of the contribution of the derivative term to the overall control action is termed the derivative gain, ''K''&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;.

The derivative term is given by
:&lt;math&gt;D_\text{out} = K_\text{d} \frac{de(t)}{dt}.&lt;/math&gt;

Derivative action predicts system behavior and thus improves settling time and stability of the system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ctms.engin.umich.edu/CTMS/index.php?example=Introduction&amp;section=ControlPID |title=Introduction: PID Controller Design |publisher=University of Michigan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=PID without a PhD |url=http://igor.chudov.com/manuals/Servo-Tuning/PID-without-a-PhD.pdf |publisher=EE Times-India |date=October 2000 |author=Tim Wescott}}&lt;/ref&gt; An ideal derivative is not [[causal system|causal]], so that implementations of PID controllers include an additional low-pass filtering for the derivative term to limit the high-frequency gain and noise. Derivative action is seldom used in practice though – by one estimate in only 25% of deployed controllers {{Citation needed|date=November 2017}} – because of its variable impact on system stability in real-world applications.

==Loop tuning==
''Tuning'' a control loop is the adjustment of its control parameters (proportional band/gain, integral gain/reset, derivative gain/rate) to the optimum values for the desired control response. Stability (no unbounded oscillation) is a basic requirement, but beyond that, different systems have different behavior, different applications have different requirements, and requirements may conflict with one another.

PID tuning is a difficult problem, even though there are only three parameters and in principle is simple to describe, because it must satisfy complex criteria within the [[#Limitations of PID control|limitations of PID control]]. There are accordingly various methods for loop tuning, and more sophisticated techniques are the subject of patents; this section describes some traditional manual methods for loop tuning.

Designing and tuning a PID controller appears to be conceptually intuitive, but can be hard in practice, if multiple (and often conflicting) objectives such as short transient and high stability are to be achieved. PID controllers often provide acceptable control using default tunings, but performance can generally be improved by careful tuning, and performance may be unacceptable with poor tuning. Usually, initial designs need to be adjusted repeatedly through computer simulations until the closed-loop system performs or compromises as desired.

Some processes have a degree of [[nonlinear system|nonlinearity]] and so parameters that work well at full-load conditions don't work when the process is starting up from no-load; this can be corrected by [[gain scheduling]] (using different parameters in different operating regions).

===Stability===

If the PID controller parameters (the gains of the proportional, integral and derivative terms) are chosen incorrectly, the controlled process input can be unstable, i.e., its output [[divergence (computer science)|diverges]], with or without [[oscillation]], and is limited only by saturation or mechanical breakage. Instability is caused by ''excess'' gain, particularly in the presence of significant lag.

Generally, stabilization of response is required and the process must not oscillate for any combination of process conditions and setpoints, though sometimes [[marginal stability]] (bounded oscillation) is acceptable or desired.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

Mathematically, the origins of instability can be seen in the Laplace domain.&lt;ref name=Bechhoefer&gt;{{cite journal | last = Bechhoefer | first = John | title = Feedback for Physicists: A Tutorial Essay On Control | journal = Reviews of Modern Physics | volume = 77 | issue = 3 | pages = 783–835 | publisher = APS Physics | url = http://journals.aps.org/rmp/abstract/10.1103/RevModPhys.77.783 | doi=10.1103/revmodphys.77.783| citeseerx = 10.1.1.124.7043 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The total loop transfer function is:
:&lt;math&gt;H(s)=\frac{K(s)G(s)}{1+K(s)G(s)}&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;K(s)&lt;/math&gt; is the PID transfer function and
:&lt;math&gt;G(s)&lt;/math&gt; is the plant transfer function

The system is called unstable where the closed loop transfer function diverges for some &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Bechhoefer"/&gt; This happens for situations where &lt;math&gt;K(s)G(s)=-1&lt;/math&gt;. Typically, this happens when &lt;math&gt;|K(s)G(s)|=1&lt;/math&gt; with a 180 degree phase shift. Stability is guaranteed when &lt;math&gt;K(s)G(s)&lt;1&lt;/math&gt; for frequencies that suffer high phase shifts. A more general formalism of this effect is known as the [[Nyquist stability criterion]].

===Optimal behavior===
The optimal behavior on a process change or setpoint change varies depending on the application.

Two basic requirements are ''regulation'' (disturbance rejection&amp;nbsp;– staying at a given setpoint) and ''command tracking'' (implementing setpoint changes)&amp;nbsp;– these refer to how well the controlled variable tracks the desired value. Specific criteria for command tracking include [[rise time]] and [[settling time]]. Some processes must not allow an overshoot of the process variable beyond the setpoint if, for example, this would be unsafe. Other processes must minimize the energy expended in reaching a new setpoint.

===Overview of tuning methods===
There are several methods for tuning a PID loop. The most effective methods generally involve the development of some form of process model, then choosing P, I, and D based on the dynamic model parameters. Manual tuning methods can be relatively time consuming, particularly for systems with long loop times.

The choice of method will depend largely on whether or not the loop can be taken "offline" for tuning, and on the response time of the system. If the system can be taken offline, the best tuning method often involves subjecting the system to a step change in input, measuring the output as a function of time, and using this response to determine the control parameters. {{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}

===Manual tuning===
If the system must remain online, one tuning method is to first set &lt;math&gt;K_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;K_d&lt;/math&gt; values to zero. Increase the &lt;math&gt;K_p&lt;/math&gt; until the output of the loop oscillates, then the &lt;math&gt;K_p&lt;/math&gt; should be set to approximately half of that value for a "quarter amplitude decay" type response. Then increase &lt;math&gt;K_i&lt;/math&gt; until any offset is corrected in sufficient time for the process. However, too much &lt;math&gt;K_i&lt;/math&gt; will cause instability. Finally, increase &lt;math&gt;K_d&lt;/math&gt;, if required, until the loop is acceptably quick to reach its reference after a load disturbance. However, too much &lt;math&gt;K_d&lt;/math&gt; will cause excessive response and overshoot. A fast PID loop tuning usually overshoots slightly to reach the setpoint more quickly; however, some systems cannot accept overshoot, in which case an [[overdamped]] closed-loop system is required, which will require a &lt;math&gt;K_p&lt;/math&gt; setting significantly less than half that of the &lt;math&gt;K_p&lt;/math&gt; setting that was causing oscillation.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}

===Ziegler–Nichols method===
{{Details|Ziegler–Nichols method}}

Another heuristic tuning method is formally known as the [[Ziegler–Nichols method]], introduced by [[John G. Ziegler]] and [[Nathaniel B. Nichols]] in the 1940s. As in the method above, the &lt;math&gt;K_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;K_d&lt;/math&gt; gains are first set to zero. The proportional gain is increased until it reaches the ultimate gain, &lt;math&gt;K_u&lt;/math&gt;, at which the output of the loop starts to oscillate. &lt;math&gt;K_u&lt;/math&gt; and the oscillation period &lt;math&gt;T_u&lt;/math&gt; are used to set the gains as follows:

| &lt;math&gt;3{K_u}{T_u}/40&lt;/math&gt;
|}

These gains apply to the ideal, parallel form of the PID controller. When applied to the standard PID form, only the integral and derivative time parameters &lt;math&gt;T_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;T_d&lt;/math&gt; are dependent on the oscillation period &lt;math&gt;T_u&lt;/math&gt;. Please see the section "[[#Alternative nomenclature and PID forms|Alternative nomenclature and PID forms]]".

===Cohen–Coon parameters===
This method was developed in 1953 and is based on a first-order + time delay model. Similar to the [[Ziegler–Nichols method]], a set of tuning parameters were developed to yield a closed-loop response with a decay ratio of 1/4. Arguably the biggest problem with these parameters is that a small change in the process parameters could potentially cause a closed-loop system to become unstable

===Relay (Åström–Hägglund) method===
Published in 1984 by [[Karl Johan Åström]] and Tore Hägglund,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.controleng.com/search/search-single-display/relay-method-automates-pid-loop-tuning/4a5774decc.html |title=Relay Method Automates PID Loop Tuning |first=Vance |last=VanDoren |journal=Control Engineering |date=1 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; the relay method temporarily operates the process using [[bang-bang control]] and measures the resultant oscillations.  The output is switched (as if by a [[relay]], hence the name) between two values of the control variable.  The values must be chosen so the process will cross the setpoint, but need not be 0% and 100%; by choosing suitable values, dangerous oscillations can be avoided.

As long as the process variable is below the setpoint, the control output is set to the higher value.  As soon as it rises above the setpoint, the control output is set to the lower value.  Ideally, the output waveform is nearly square, spending equal time above and below the setpoint.  The period and amplitude of the resultant oscillations are measured, and used to compute the ultimate gain and period, which are then fed into the Ziegler–Nichols method.

Specifically, the ultimate period &lt;math&gt;T_u&lt;/math&gt; is assumed to be equal to the observed period, and the ultimate gain is computed as &lt;math&gt;K_u = 4b/\pi a,&lt;/math&gt; where {{mvar|a}} is the amplitude of the process variable oscillation, and {{mvar|b}} is the amplitude of the control output change which caused it.

There are numerous variants on the relay method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=A Review of Relay Auto-tuning Methods for the Tuning of PID-type Controllers |first=Stephen |last=Hornsey |journal=Reinvention |volume=5 |issue=2 |date=29 October 2012 |url=http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/cross_fac/iatl/reinvention/issues/volume5issue2/hornsey}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===PID tuning software===
Most modern industrial facilities no longer tune loops using the manual calculation methods shown above. Instead, PID tuning and loop optimization software are used to ensure consistent results. These software packages will gather the data, develop process models, and suggest optimal tuning. Some software packages can even develop tuning by gathering data from reference changes.

Mathematical PID loop tuning induces an impulse in the system, and then uses the controlled system's frequency response to design the PID loop values. In loops with response times of several minutes, mathematical loop tuning is recommended, because trial and error can take days just to find a stable set of loop values. Optimal values are harder to find. Some digital loop controllers offer a self-tuning feature in which very small setpoint changes are sent to the process, allowing the controller itself to calculate optimal tuning values.

Other formulas are available to tune the loop according to different performance criteria. Many patented formulas are now embedded within PID tuning software and hardware modules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Yun |last1=Li |first2=Kiam Heong |last2=Ang |first3=Gregory C.Y. |last3=Chong |title=Patents, software, and hardware for PID control: An overview and analysis of the current art |journal=IEEE Control Systems Magazine |volume=26 |issue=1 |pages=42–54 |date=February 2006 |url=http://eprints.gla.ac.uk/3816/1/IEEE2pdf.pdf |doi=10.1109/MCS.2006.1580153}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advances in automated PID loop tuning software also deliver algorithms for tuning PID Loops in a dynamic or non-steady state (NSS) scenario. The software will model the dynamics of a process, through a disturbance, and calculate PID control parameters in response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |title=On Automation of the PID Tuning Procedure |first=Kristian |last=Soltesz |publisher=[[Lund university]] |date=January 2012 |type=[[Licentiate (degree)|Licentiate]] theis |url=http://www.control.lth.se/documents/2012/sol2012lic.pdf |id=[http://lup.lub.lu.se/record/2293573 847ca38e-93e8-4188-b3d5-8ec6c23f2132]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Limitations of PID control==
While PID controllers are applicable to many control problems, and often perform satisfactorily without any improvements or only coarse tuning, they can perform poorly in some applications, and do not in general provide [[optimal control|''optimal'' control]]. The fundamental difficulty with PID control is that it is a feedback control system, with ''constant'' parameters, and no direct knowledge of the process, and thus overall performance is reactive and a compromise. While PID control is the best controller in an [[state observer|observer]] without a model of the process, better performance can be obtained by overtly modeling the actor of the process without resorting to an observer.

PID controllers, when used alone, can give poor performance when the PID loop gains must be reduced so that the control system does not overshoot, oscillate or [[hunting oscillation|hunt]] about the control setpoint value. They also have difficulties in the presence of non-linearities, may trade-off regulation versus response time, do not react to changing process behavior (say, the process changes after it has warmed up), and have lag in responding to large disturbances.

The most significant improvement is to incorporate [[feed-forward control]] with knowledge about the system, and using the PID only to control error. Alternatively, PIDs can be modified in more minor ways, such as by changing the parameters (either [[gain scheduling]] in different use cases or adaptively modifying them based on performance), improving measurement (higher sampling rate, precision, and accuracy, and low-pass filtering if necessary), or cascading multiple PID controllers.

===Linearity===
Another problem faced with PID controllers is that they are linear, and in particular symmetric. Thus, performance of PID controllers in non-linear systems (such as [[HVAC control system|HVAC systems]]) is variable. For example, in temperature control, a common use case is active heating (via a heating element) but passive cooling (heating off, but no cooling), so overshoot can only be corrected slowly – it cannot be forced downward. In this case the PID should be tuned to be overdamped, to prevent or reduce overshoot, though this reduces performance (it increases settling time).

===Noise in derivative===

A problem with the derivative term is that it amplifies higher frequency measurement or process [[noise]] that can cause large amounts of change in the output. It is often helpful to filter the measurements with a [[low-pass filter]] in order to remove higher-frequency noise components. As low-pass filtering and derivative control can cancel each other out, the amount of filtering is limited. So low noise instrumentation can be important. A nonlinear [[median filter]] may be used, which improves the filtering efficiency and practical performance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eprints.gla.ac.uk/3815/1/IEEE_CS_PID_01580152.pdf Li, Y. and Ang, K.H. and Chong, G.C.Y. (2006) PID control system analysis and design - Problems, remedies, and future directions]. IEEE Control Systems Magazine, 26 (1). pp. 32-41. {{ISSN|0272-1708}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, the differential band can be turned off with little loss of control. This is equivalent to using the PID controller as a [[#PI controller|PI controller]].

==Modifications to the PID algorithm==
The basic PID algorithm presents some challenges in control applications that have been addressed by minor modifications to the PID form.

===Integral windup===
{{Details|Integral windup}}

One common problem resulting from the ideal PID implementations is [[integral windup]]. Following a large change in setpoint the integral term can accumulate an error larger than the maximal value for the regulation variable (windup), thus the system overshoots and continues to increase until this accumulated error is unwound. This problem can be addressed by:

*Disabling the integration until the PV has entered the controllable region
*Preventing the integral term from accumulating above or below pre-determined bounds
*Back-calculating the integral term to constrain the regulator output within feasible bounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.controlguru.com/2008/021008.html|last=Cooper|first=Douglas|title=Integral (Reset) Windup, Jacketing Logic and the Velocity PI Form|accessdate=2014-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Overshooting from known disturbances===
For example, a PID loop is used to control the temperature of an electric resistance furnace where the system has stabilized. Now when the door is opened and something cold is put into the furnace the temperature drops below the setpoint. The integral function of the controller tends to compensate for error by introducing another error in the positive direction. This overshoot can be avoided by freezing of the integral function after the opening of the door for the time the control loop typically needs to reheat the furnace.

===PI controller===
[[File:PI controller.svg|thumb|300x300px|Basic block of a PI controller]]&lt;!--redirects link here--&gt;

A '''PI Controller''' (proportional-integral controller) is a special case of the PID controller in which the derivative (D) of the error is not used.

The controller output is given by
:&lt;math&gt;K_P \Delta + K_I \int \Delta\,dt&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt; is the error or deviation of actual measured value ('''''PV''''') from the setpoint ('''''SP''''').
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta = SP - PV.&lt;/math&gt;

A PI controller can be modelled easily in software such as [[Simulink]] or [[Xcos]] using a "flow chart" box involving [[Laplace transform|Laplace]] operators:
:&lt;math&gt;C=\frac{G(1+\tau s)}{\tau s}&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;G = K_P&lt;/math&gt; = proportional gain
:&lt;math&gt;\frac G \tau = K_I&lt;/math&gt; = integral gain

Setting a value for &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is often a trade off between decreasing overshoot and increasing settling time.

The lack of derivative action may make the system more steady in the steady state in the case of noisy data. This is because derivative action is more sensitive to higher-frequency terms in the inputs.

Without derivative action, a PI-controlled system is less responsive to real (non-noise) and relatively fast alterations in state and so the system will be slower to reach setpoint and slower to respond to perturbations than a well-tuned PID system may be.

===Deadband===
Many PID loops control a mechanical device (for example, a valve). Mechanical maintenance can be a major cost and wear leads to control degradation in the form of either [[stiction]] or [[Backlash (engineering)|backlash]] in the mechanical response to an input signal. The rate of mechanical wear is mainly a function of how often a device is activated to make a change. Where wear is a significant concern, the PID loop may have an output [[deadband]] to reduce the frequency of activation of the output (valve). This is accomplished by modifying the controller to hold its output steady if the change would be small (within the defined deadband range). The calculated output must leave the deadband before the actual output will change.

===Setpoint step change===
The proportional and derivative terms can produce excessive movement in the output when a system is subjected to an instantaneous step increase in the error, such as a large setpoint change. In the case of the derivative term, this is due to taking the derivative of the error, which is very large in the case of an instantaneous step change. As a result, some PID algorithms incorporate some of the following modifications:

;Setpoint ramping
:In this modification, the setpoint is gradually moved from its old value to a newly specified value using a linear or first order differential ramp function. This avoids the [[discontinuity (mathematics)|discontinuity]] present in a simple step change.
;Derivative of the process variable
:In this case the PID controller measures the derivative of the measured [[process variable]] (PV), rather than the derivative of the error. This quantity is always continuous (i.e., never has a step change as a result of changed setpoint). This modification is a simple case of setpoint weighting.
;Setpoint weighting
:Setpoint weighting adds adjustable factors (usually between 0 and 1) to the setpoint in the error in the proportional and derivative element of the controller. The error in the integral term must be the true control error to avoid steady-state control errors. These two extra parameters do not affect the response to load disturbances and measurement noise and can be tuned to improve the controller's setpoint response.

===Feed-forward===

The control system performance can be improved by combining the [[feedback]] (or closed-loop) control of a PID controller with [[feed forward (control)|feed-forward]] (or open-loop) control. Knowledge about the system (such as the desired acceleration and inertia) can be fed forward and combined with the PID output to improve the overall system performance. The feed-forward value alone can often provide the major portion of the controller output. The PID controller primarily has to compensate whatever difference or ''error'' remains between the setpoint (SP) and the system response to the open loop control. Since the feed-forward output is not affected by the process feedback, it can never cause the control system to oscillate, thus improving the system response without affecting stability. Feed forward can be based on the setpoint and on extra measured disturbances. Setpoint weighting is a simple form of feed forward.

For example, in most motion control systems, in order to accelerate a mechanical load under control, more force is required from the actuator. If a velocity loop PID controller is being used to control the speed of the load and command the force being applied by the actuator, then it is beneficial to take the desired instantaneous acceleration, scale that value appropriately and add it to the output of the PID velocity loop controller. This means that whenever the load is being accelerated or decelerated, a proportional amount of force is commanded from the actuator regardless of the feedback value. The PID loop in this situation uses the feedback information to change the combined output to reduce the remaining difference between the process setpoint and the feedback value. Working together, the combined open-loop feed-forward controller and closed-loop PID controller can provide a more responsive control system.

===Bumpless operation===
PID controllers are often implemented with a "bumpless" initialization feature that recalculates the integral accumulator term to maintain a consistent process output through parameter changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.controlguru.com/wp/p71.html|last=Cooper|first=Douglas|title=PI Control of the Heat Exchanger|work=Practical Process Control by Control Guru|accessdate=2014-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; A partial implementation is to store the integral of the integral gain times the error rather than storing the integral of the error and postmultiplying by the integral gain, which prevents discontinuous output when the I gain is changed, but not the P or D gains.

===Other improvements===

In addition to feed-forward, PID controllers are often enhanced through methods such as PID [[gain scheduling]] (changing parameters in different operating conditions), [[fuzzy logic]], or [ftp://www.cc.uah.es/pub/Alumnos/G_Ing_Informatica/Comp_Flexible/Articulos/CI.pdf computational verb logic].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last= Yang | first= T.|title= Architectures of Computational Verb Controllers: Towards a New Paradigm of Intelligent Control | journal= International Journal of Computational Cognition | volume= 3 | issue= 2 | pages= 74–101 | publisher= Yang's Scientific Press |date= June 2005 | ref= harv | url=  http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.152.9564}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last= Liang| first= Y.-L.()|title= Controlling fuel annealer using computational verb PID controllers | journal= Proceedings of the 3rd international conference on Anti-Counterfeiting, security, and identification in communication |pages= 417–420 | publisher= [[IEEE]] | year= 2009 | url=  http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1719210&amp;preflayout=tabs | ref= harv | display-authors= 1 | author2= &lt;Please add first missing authors to populate metadata.&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further practical application issues can arise from instrumentation connected to the controller. A high enough sampling rate, measurement precision, and measurement accuracy are required to achieve adequate control performance. Another new method for improvement of PID controller is to increase the degree of freedom by using [[fractional calculus#PID controllers|fractional order]]. The order of the integrator and differentiator add increased flexibility to the controller.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tenreiro Machado JA, et al | title = Some Applications of Fractional Calculus in Engineering | journal = Mathematical Problems in Engineering | volume = 2010 | date = 2009 | doi = 10.1155/2010/639801 | url = https://www.hindawi.com/journals/mpe/2010/639801/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cascade control==
One distinctive advantage of PID controllers is that two PID controllers can be used together to yield better dynamic performance. This is called cascaded PID control. In cascade control there are two PIDs arranged with one PID controlling the setpoint of another. A PID controller acts as outer loop controller, which controls the primary physical parameter, such as fluid level or velocity. The other controller acts as inner loop controller, which reads the output of outer loop controller as setpoint, usually controlling a more rapid changing parameter, flowrate or acceleration. It can be mathematically proven{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} that the working frequency of the controller is increased and the time constant of the object is reduced by using cascaded PID controllers.{{Vague|date=February 2009}}.

For example, a temperature-controlled circulating bath has two PID controllers in cascade, each with its own thermocouple temperature sensor. The outer controller controls the temperature of the water using a thermocouple located far from the heater where it accurately reads the temperature of the bulk of the water. The error term of this PID controller is the difference between the desired bath temperature and measured temperature. Instead of controlling the heater directly, the outer PID controller sets a heater temperature goal for the inner PID controller. The inner PID controller controls the temperature of the heater using a thermocouple attached to the heater. The inner controller's error term is the difference between this heater temperature setpoint and the measured temperature of the heater. Its output controls the actual heater to stay near this setpoint.

The proportional, integral, and differential terms of the two controllers will be very different. The outer PID controller has a long time constant – all the water in the tank needs to heat up or cool down. The inner loop responds much more quickly. Each controller can be tuned to match the physics of the system ''it'' controls – heat transfer and thermal mass of the whole tank or of just the heater – giving better total response.

==Alternative nomenclature and PID forms==
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2012}}

===Ideal (standard) versus parallel PID form===
The form of the PID controller most often encountered in industry, and the one most relevant to tuning algorithms is the ''standard form''. In this form the &lt;math&gt;K_p&lt;/math&gt; gain is applied to the &lt;math&gt;I_{\mathrm{out}}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;D_{\mathrm{out}}&lt;/math&gt; terms, yielding:

:&lt;math&gt;u(t) = K_p \left( e(t) + \frac{1}{T_i}\int_0^t e(\tau)\,d\tau + T_d\frac{d}{dt}e(t) \right)&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;T_i&lt;/math&gt; is the ''integral time''
:&lt;math&gt;T_d&lt;/math&gt; is the ''derivative time''

In this standard form, the parameters have a clear physical meaning. In particular, the inner summation produces a new single error value which is compensated for future and past errors. The proportional error term is the current error. The derivative components term attempts to predict the error value at &lt;math&gt;T_d&lt;/math&gt; seconds (or samples) in the future, assuming that the loop control remains unchanged. The integral component adjusts the error value to compensate for the sum of all past errors, with the intention of completely eliminating them in &lt;math&gt;T_i&lt;/math&gt; seconds (or samples). The resulting compensated single error value is then scaled by the single gain &lt;math&gt;K_p&lt;/math&gt; to compute the control variable.

In the parallel form, shown in the controller theory section
:&lt;math&gt;u(t) = K_p e(t) + K_i \int_0^t e(\tau)\,d\tau + K_d\frac{d}{dt}e(t)&lt;/math&gt;

the gain parameters are related to the parameters of the standard form through &lt;math&gt;K_i = K_p/T_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;K_d = K_p T_d&lt;/math&gt;. This parallel form, where the parameters are treated as simple gains, is the most general and flexible form. However, it is also the form where the parameters have the least physical interpretation and is generally reserved for theoretical treatment of the PID controller. The standard form, despite being slightly more complex mathematically, is more common in industry.

===Reciprocal gain, a.k.a. proportional band===
In many cases, the manipulated variable output by the PID controller is a dimensionless fraction between 0 and 100% of some maximum possible value, and the translation into real units (such as pumping rate or watts of heater power) is outside the PID controller. The process variable, however, is in dimensioned units such as temperature. It is common in this case to express the gain &lt;math&gt;K_p&lt;/math&gt; not as "output per degree", but rather in the reciprocal form of a ''proportional band'' &lt;math&gt;100/K_p&lt;/math&gt;, which is "degrees per full output": the range over which the output changes from 0 to 1 (0% to 100%).  Beyond this range, the output is saturated, full-off or full-on.  The narrower this band, the higher the proportional gain.

===Basing derivative action on PV===
In most commercial control systems, derivative action is based on process variable rather than error. That is, a change in the setpoint does not affect the derivative action.  This is because the digitized version of the algorithm produces a large unwanted spike when the setpoint is changed. If the setpoint is constant then changes in the PV will be the same as changes in error. Therefore, this modification makes no difference to the way the controller responds to process disturbances.

===Basing proportional action on PV===
Most commercial control systems offer the ''option'' of also basing the proportional action solely on the process variable. This means that only the integral action responds to changes in the setpoint. The modification to the algorithm does not affect the way the controller responds to process disturbances.
Basing proportional action on PV eliminates the instant and possibly very large change in output caused by a sudden change to the setpoint. Depending on the process and tuning this may be beneficial to the response to a setpoint step.
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{MV(t)}=K_p\left(\,{-PV(t)} + \frac{1}{T_i}\int_{0}^{t}{e(\tau)}\,{d\tau} - T_d\frac{d}{dt}PV(t)\right)&lt;/math&gt;
King&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=King |first=Myke |title=Process Control: A Practical Approach |publisher=Wiley |year=2011 |pages=52–78 |isbn=0-470-97587-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; describes an effective chart-based method.

===Laplace form of the PID controller===
Sometimes it is useful to write the PID regulator in [[Laplace transform]] form:
:&lt;math&gt;G(s)=K_p + \frac{K_i}{s} + K_d{s}=\frac{K_d{s^2} + K_p{s} + K_i}{s}&lt;/math&gt;

Having the PID controller written in Laplace form and having the [[transfer function]] of the controlled system makes it easy to determine the closed-loop transfer function of the system.

===Series/interacting form===
Another representation of the PID controller is the series, or ''interacting'' form
:&lt;math&gt;G(s) = K_c \frac{(\tau_i{s}+1)}{\tau_i{s}} (\tau_d{s}+1)&lt;/math&gt;
where the parameters are related to the parameters of the standard form through
:&lt;math&gt;K_p = K_c \cdot \alpha&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;T_i = \tau_i \cdot \alpha&lt;/math&gt;, and
:&lt;math&gt;T_d = \frac{\tau_d}{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;
with
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha = 1 + \frac{\tau_d}{\tau_i}&lt;/math&gt;.

This form essentially consists of a PD and PI controller in series, and it made early (analog) controllers easier to build. When the controllers later became digital, many kept using the interacting form.

===Discrete implementation===
The analysis for designing a digital implementation of a PID controller in a [[microcontroller]] (MCU) or [[FPGA]] device requires the standard form of the PID controller to be ''discretized''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/19070283/Discrete-PI-and-PID-Controller-Design-and-Analysis-for-Digital-Implementation |title=Discrete PI and PID Controller Design and Analysis for Digital Implementation |publisher=Scribd.com |accessdate=2011-04-04 |url-access=registration}}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximations for first-order derivatives are made by backward [[finite difference]]s. The integral term is discretised, with a sampling time &lt;math&gt;\Delta t&lt;/math&gt;, as follows,
:&lt;math&gt;\int_0^{t_k} e(\tau) \, d\tau = \sum_{i=1}^k e(t_i) \, \Delta t &lt;/math&gt;

The derivative term is approximated as,
:&lt;math&gt;\dfrac{de(t_k)}{dt}=\dfrac{e(t_k)-e(t_{k-1})}{\Delta t}&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, a ''velocity algorithm'' for implementation of the discretized PID controller in a MCU is obtained by differentiating &lt;math&gt;u(t)&lt;/math&gt;, using the numerical definitions of the first and second derivative and solving for &lt;math&gt;u(t_k)&lt;/math&gt; and finally obtaining:

:&lt;math&gt;u(t_k)=u(t_{k-1})+K_p\left[\left(1+\dfrac{\Delta t}{T_i}+\dfrac{T_d}{\Delta t}\right) e(t_k)+\left(-1-\dfrac{2T_d}{\Delta t}\right)e(t_{k-1}) + \dfrac{T_d}{\Delta t}e(t_{k-2})\right]&lt;/math&gt;

s.t. &lt;math&gt; T_i = K_p/K_i, T_d = K_d/K_p&lt;/math&gt;

==Pseudocode==

Here is a simple software loop that implements a PID algorithm:&lt;ref name="codeproject"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/36459/PID-process-control-a-Cruise-Control-example |title=PID process control, a "Cruise Control" example |publisher=CodeProject |accessdate=4 November 2012 |year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 previous_error = 0
 integral = 0
 loop:
   error = setpoint - measured_value
   integral = integral + error * dt
   derivative = (error - previous_error) / dt
   output = Kp * error + Ki * integral + Kd * derivative
   previous_error = error
   wait(dt)
   goto loop
In this example, two variables that will be maintained within the loop are [[initialization (programming)|initialized]] to zero, then the loop begins. The current ''error'' is calculated by subtracting the ''measured_value'' (the process variable, or PV) from the current ''setpoint'' (SP). Then, ''[[integral]]'' and ''[[derivative]]'' values are calculated, and these and the ''error'' are combined with three preset gain terms – the proportional gain, the integral gain and the derivative gain – to derive an ''output'' value. 

In the real world, this is [[digital-to-analog converter|D-to-A converted]] and passed into the process under control as the manipulated variable (MV). The current error is stored elsewhere for re-use in the next differentiation, the program then waits until dt seconds have passed since start, and the loop begins again, [[analog-to-digital converter|reading in]] new values for the PV and the setpoint and calculating a new value for the error.&lt;ref name="codeproject"/&gt;

Note that for real code, the use of "wait(dt)" might be inappropriate because it doesn't account for time taken by the algorithm itself during the loop, or more importantly, any preemption delaying the algorithm.

'''Periphyton''' is a complex mixture of [[algae]], [[cyanobacteria]], [[heterotroph]]ic [[microbe]]s, and [[detritus]] that is attached to submerged surfaces in most aquatic [[ecosystem]]s. The related term '''Aufwuchs''' ([[German language|German]] "surface growth" or "overgrowth") refers to the collection of small animals and plants that adhere to open surfaces in aquatic environments, such as parts of rooted plants. Periphyton serves as an important food source for [[invertebrate]]s, [[tadpole]]s, and some [[fish]]. It can also absorb [[contaminant]]s, removing them from the water column and limiting their movement through the environment. The periphyton is also an important indicator of [[water quality]]; responses of this community to [[pollutant]]s can be measured at a variety of scales representing [[physiological]] to community-level changes. So periphyton has often been used as an experimental system in, e.g., [[pollution-induced community tolerance]] studies.

In both marine and freshwater environments, [[algae]] &amp;ndash; particularly [[green algae]] and [[diatom]]s &amp;ndash; make up the dominant component of aufwuchs communities. Small [[crustacean]]s, [[rotifer]]s, and [[protozoa]]ns are also commonly found in fresh water and the sea, but [[insects|insect larvae]], [[Oligochaeta|oligochaetes]] and [[tardigrade]]s are peculiar to freshwater aufwuchs faunas.

Periphyton communities are used in [[aquaculture]] food production systems for the removal of solid and dissolved pollutants. Their performance in filtration is established and their application as aquacultural feed is being researched.

A risk for periphyton stems from urbanization. Increased turbidity levels associated with [[urban sprawl]] can smother periphyton causing its detachment from the rocks on which it lives. It can be important for the clearance of harmful chemicals and reducing turbidity.

Periphyton serves as an indicator of water quality&lt;ref name="#1"&gt;[http://water.epa.gov/scitech/monitoring/rsl/bioassessment/ch06main.cfm], EPA - Periphyton Protocols&lt;/ref&gt; because:

:*It has a naturally high number of species.
:*It has a fast response to changes.
:*It is easy to sample.
:*It is known for tolerance/sensitivity to change.

==Food source==
Many aquatic animals feed extensively on aufwuchs. The [[mbuna]] [[cichlid]]s from [[Lake Malawi]] are particularly well known examples of fish adapted for feeding on aufwuchs. Examples include ''[[Labeotropheus trewavasae]]'' and ''[[Pseudotropheus zebra]]''. They have scraper-like teeth that allow them to rasp the aufwuchs from rocks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://malawicichlids.com/mw01100.htm#aufw ''Aufwuchs'']&lt;/ref&gt; In marine communities, aufwuchs food sources are important for animals such as [[limpet]]s and [[sea urchin]]s.

The '''Petroleum Conservation Research Association''' (PCRA) is an organization established in [[India]] in 1978, under the aegis of the [[ gurchandan singh Government's of India|Indian]] [[Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas]] that is engaged in promoting [[efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] in various sectors of the economy. It helps the government in proposing policies and strategies aimed at reducing India's dependency on oil, in order to save money, reduce the environmental impact of oil use and also conserve [[fossil fuel]].

==Mandate==
India's demand for petroleum products is increasing at a rate of approximately 3-4% per annum. Some of this usage, the PCRA argues, is avoidable: it sponsored a project in Delhi which is demonstrated that fuel worth Rs. 994 cr per annum is being burnt at traffic signals due to idling of vehicles at red lights. Energy efficiency measures to reduce by 2% India's use of petroleum products, worth Rs. 4 [[Lakh]] [[Crore]]s per annum, could save the country's Rs. 8,000 Crores worth of imports.

The PCRA is mandated to promote popular awareness of the importance of energy conservation. It cites an international acceptance that energy efficiency measures, like turning off car engines at traffic signals and driving at speeds of 45–50&amp;nbsp;km/h, could help most countries to reduce their use of petroleum products by 20%. The PCRA promotes a nationwide mass media awareness campaign titled “Save Fuel Yaani Save Money”, broadcast on television, radio, and in newspapers. The campaign mascot, Yaani, is a piggy bank, representing saving. The PCRA took the campaign to the [[India International Trade Fair]] – 09, where the PCRA stall featured interactive games and quizzes to promote energy efficiency.

The PCRA aims to become a center of excellence for conservation of hydrocarbons &amp; environment protection for sustainable development on our inherent strength. Its mission is to reach efficient energy utilization and environment protection leading to Improvement in Quality of Life. Its objectives are:

1)To formulate strategies and promote measures for accelerating conservation of petroleum products leading to environment protection, energy security and sustainable development.

2)To create awareness among masses about the importance, benefits and methods of conserving petroleum products &amp; clean environment by enhancing information and capacity building.

3)To promote research, development and deployment efforts aimed at petroleum conservation &amp; environment protection, support &amp; facilitate efforts for adoption and dissemination of fuel efficient technologies and substitution of petroleum products with alternate fuels and renewable.

4)To establish synergistic institutional linkages at the national &amp; international levels in the areas of petroleum conservation &amp; environment protection.

5)To provide training and technical advisory services, designed to achieve economy &amp; efficiency in use of petroleum products for cleaner environment.

6)To function as a Think Tank to the Govt. of India for proposing policies and strategies on petroleum conservation and environment protection aimed at reducing excessive dependence on oil

'''Plato's Retreat''' was a [[swingers' club]] in [[Manhattan]], [[New York City|New York]], NY, USA,  operating from 1977 until 1985 and catering to [[heterosexual]] couples and [[bisexual]] women.
&lt;ref name=pecker&gt;{{cite book |last=Friedman |first=Josh Alan|author-link=Josh Alan Friedman |editor-last=|editor-first= |title=Tales of Times Square|publisher=[[Feral House]]|date=1993|orig-year=1986 |pages=98–124 |chapter=Pecker Full of Miracles|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Establishment==
In 1976, Larry Levenson, a high school friend of [[Al Goldstein]] and a former fast-food manager who was selling ice cream at [[Coney Island]], was introduced  to the [[Swinging (sexual practice)|swinging lifestyle]] by a woman he met at a bar.&lt;ref name=observed/&gt; After organizing swinging parties himself for a time, he opened a club "for swingers" in 1977&lt;ref name=wild&gt;{{cite book |last= Heidenry |first=Jean|author-link=Josh Alan Friedman |editor-last=|editor-first= |title=What Wild Ecstasy: The Rise and Fall of the Sexual Revolution|publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]]|date=2002|orig-year=|page=221 |chapter=|isbn=0743241843}}&lt;/ref&gt;, in the basement of the Kenmore Hotel on East 23rd Street between Lexington and Third Avenue, and called it "Plato's Retreat." The same year, he moved it to the basement of the [[Ansonia Hotel]], a 19th-century building on 2109 [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]] between West 73rd and [[West 74th Street]]s on the [[Upper West Side]] of [[Manhattan]]. The hotel used to house [[Continental Baths]], a [[gay bathhouse]] where [[Bette Midler]], often accompanied by [[Barry Manilow]] on piano, provided musical entertainment early in her career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cooperator.com/articles/1200/1/Inside-the-Ansonia/Page1.html |title=Inside the Ansonia |first=Mary K. |last=Fons |work=The Cooperator |date=September 2005 |accessdate=2 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rules and premises==
Plato's Retreat was a "members-only" establishment that required everyone to follow the club's rules. Levenson barred male [[homosexual]]s, and accepted only straight couples &amp;ndash; and women, escorted or otherwise &amp;ndash; in the premises. Once a woman left a room after a sexual encounter, her male companion had to accompany her within two minutes. This rule was intended to ensure that women nearly always outnumbered men.

According to a 1979 advertisement in ''[[SCREW (magazine)|SCREW]]'' magazine, the club offered, besides a heated swimming pool, a [[sauna]] steam, [[whirlpool bath]]s, disco dancing, free bar and buffet, "cozy living rooms and lounging areas", a "variety of swing areas", and a [[backgammon]] lounge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work= [[SCREW (magazine)|SCREW]] |page=47 |date=June 18, 1979|title=Plato's Retreat |url=http://40.media.tumblr.com/9222b013b59d4ea1830c10bff900f81b/tumblr_n9uk3hEmQC1sbtct0o1_1280.jpg |accessdate=20 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fame==
During its heyday, Plato's Retreat was considered the world's most infamous sex club,&lt;ref name=observed&gt;{{cite news |last=Hart |first=Jon|date=22 September 2002 |title=Fantasy Island |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/22/nyregion/new-york-observed-fantasy-island.html|dead-url=no |work=[[The New York Times]] |location=|archiveurl=|archivedate=|access-date=21 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; popular with celebrities, [[porn star]]s, and well-to-do couples. The clientele was described as "an assortment of kinky types from the [[suburbs]]: dry cleaners and their wives, or fat men in [[toupee]]s with their heavily made-up girlfriends."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gaines |first=Steven |title=The Sky's the Limit: Passion and Property in Manhattan |year=2005 |publisher=Little, Brown and Company |location=New York |isbn=0-316-60851-3 |page=197}}&lt;/ref&gt; Owner Levenson often partook in sexual activity on the premises, once winning a bet against Al Goldstein and 'Butch' Katz, owner of 42nd Street's Roxy Burlesk theater, that he could [[Ejaculation|ejaculate]] fifteen times within a twenty-four-hour day.&lt;ref name=pecker/&gt;

In 1980, Plato's relocated to 509 West 34th Street.&lt;ref name="clubs"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.disco-disco.com/clubs/other-clubs.shtml |title=Other Legendary Clubs |publisher=Disco-Disco.com |accessdate=2 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decline and closure==
In 1985, New York City Mayor [[Ed Koch]] backed the [[New York City Health Department]]'s decision to shut down the city's gay bathhouses, in response to concerns over the spread of [[HIV/AIDS]]. In closing the gay bathhouses while allowing the heterosexual swingers' clubs &amp;ndash; most notably Plato's Retreat &amp;ndash; to remain open, the city found itself in violation of the newly adopted anti-discrimination law. The Health Department, with Koch's approval, reacted by ordering the heterosexual clubs, including Plato's Retreat, to close as well. The club's Manhattan location was shut down on New Year's Eve 1985, ostensibly for violating public-health ordinances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Golubski|first=Suzanne|author2=Kappstatter, Bob|work=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]|title=Swinging doors shut: City probe KO's Plato's|date=|url=http://www.wmob.com/artpages/platos1.html|accessdate=21 September 2018|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927043031/http://www.wmob.com/artpages/platos1.html|archivedate=27 September 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1981, Levenson and his by-then two partners along with Plato’s [[accountant]] were tried and convicted for [[tax evasion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court

After serving his sentence, Levenson worked in various jobs, such as [[cab driver]]. He died in 1999 after a [[Coronary artery bypass surgery|quadruple bypass heart surgery]].&lt;ref name=beast&gt;{{cite news |last=Hart |first=Jon |date=7 April 2009 |title=The Studio 54 of Sex|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-studio-54-of-sex |dead-url=no |work=[[The Daily Beast]] |location=|archiveurl=|archivedate=2013-10-18 |access-date=20 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Florida==
Plato's Retreat relocated to [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida|Fort Lauderdale]], [[Florida]], where it reopened under the name "Plato's Retreat 2." Located at 321 West Sunrise, the new location was in operation as an on-premises heterosexual [[Swinging (sexual practice)|swingers' club]], open Monday through Sunday from eight p.m. until the last person left. Saturday night was for couples only. Plato's Retreat in Fort Lauderdale was a [[BYOB (acronym)#Bottle club|bring-your-own-bottle]] club, since no liquor was sold on the premises; however, it provided complimentary mixers, soft drinks, juices, and ice.

In 2006, Plato's Retreat 2 closed, and then reopened as a sex club "for men only," keeping the same location and bring-your-own format. The club at the Fort Lauderdale location currently operates under the business name "321 Slammer."&lt;ref&gt;[http://321slammer.com 321 Slammer] website&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2010s, there are reportedly numerous on-premises swingers' clubs operating in [[South Florida]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Mooney |first=Michael J.|date=3 March 2011 |title=South Florida sex clubs revealed|url=https://www.miaminewtimes.com/news/south-florida-sex-clubs-revealed-6379994|dead-url=no |work=[[Miami New Times]] |location=|archiveurl=|archivedate=2013-10-18 |access-date=20 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Service-learning''' is an educational approach that combines learning objectives with community service in order to provide a pragmatic, progressive learning experience while meeting societal needs.

Service-learning involves students in service projects to apply classroom learning for local agencies that exist to effect positive change in the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Knapp |first=Timothy D. |author2=Bradley J. Fisher|title=The Effectiveness of Service-Learning: It's not always what you think|journal=Journal of Experiential Education|year=2010|volume=33|issue=3|pages=208–224|doi=10.5193/JEE33.3.208}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Youth Leadership Council]] defines service learning as "a philosophy, pedagogy, and model for community development that is used as an instructional strategy to meet learning goals and/or content standards".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=K–12 Service-Learning Standards for Quality Practice|publisher=National Youth Leadership Council|url=http://www.nylc.org/sites/nylc.org/files/files/Standards_Oct2009-web.pdf|accessdate=November 11, 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111111201324/http://www.nylc.org/sites/nylc.org/files/files/Standards_Oct2009-web.pdf|archivedate=November 11, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Author Barbara Jacoby defines service-learning as "a form of experiential education in which students engage in activities that address human and community needs together with structured opportunities for reflection designed to achieve desired learning outcomes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jacoby|first1=Barbara|title=Service-Learning in Higher Education: Concepts and Practices|date=1996|isbn=978-0787902919|publisher=Jossey-Bass}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Typology==
As defined by Robert Sigmon, 1994:
* Service-LEARNING: Learning goals primary; service outcomes secondary.
* SERVICE-Learning: Service outcomes primary; learning goals secondary.
* service learning: Service and learning goals completely separate.
* SERVICE-LEARNING: Service and learning goals of equal weight and each enhances the other for all participants.

===Examples of service-learning typologies===

'''Service-learning''', as defined by Robert Sigmon, "occurs when there is a balance between learning goals and service outcomes."&lt;ref name=Furco&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Furco|first1=Andrew|title="Service-Learning": A Balanced Approach to Experiential Education|journal=The INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL for GLOBAL and DEVELOPMENT EDUCATION RESEARCH|date=October 2011|issue=0|pages=71–76|url=http://educacio-cp89.webjoomla.es/wp-content/uploads/03-Furco-1-English.pdf|accessdate=4 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|72}} As follows, there are various methods of hands-on learning that fall into this category, these include:
* [[Volunteering|Volunteerism]]: Volunteerism is acts of service performed out of free will without expectation of recompense and is generally altruistic in nature; the main beneficiaries (at least in a visible sense) are generally those served by the student.
* [[Community service|Community Service]]: Community service is quite similar to volunteerism, the main difference being that it is said to "involve more structure and student commitment than do volunteer programs."&lt;ref name=Furco/&gt;{{rp|74}}
* [[Internship]]: Internships can provide students with experience in various fields of work; however, unlike volunteerism and community service, students gain a more measurable benefit from this aspect of service learning.
* Field Education: Field education, like internships, is generally more materially beneficial to the student. Field education involves programs that, "provide students with co‐curricular service opportunities that are related, but not fully integrated, with their formal academic studies."&lt;ref name=Furco/&gt;{{rp|75}}

The purpose of service learning is, in essence, to, "equally benefit the provider and the recipient of the service as well as to ensure equal focus on both the service being provided and the learning that is occurring." Volunteerism, community service, internships, and field education all exemplify, in some way or another, the core value of service learning, as all of them benefit the student as well as the one they served to an equal degree, the only difference being how material the benefit is. These methods also tend to focus on ensuring that the student not only serves, but learns something, whether it is interpersonal skills, work experience in their future field,&lt;ref name=Furco/&gt; or a change in how they view themselves and others.&lt;ref name="Eyler 1999"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eyler|first1=Janet|last2=Giles Jr.|first2=Dwight E.|title=Where's the Learning in Service-Learning|date=23 April 1999|publisher=Jossey-Bass|edition=1st|location=San Francisco, CA|isbn=978-0-470-90746-7|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|25}}

==History==
In ''Service-learning: History, Theory, and Issues'', Bruce W. Speck and Sherry Lee Hoppe say that [[John Dewey|John Dewey's]] writings on the active nature of understanding and the benefits of and conditions for participatory democracy "provide an early theoretical foundation for a pedagogy in which students cooperatively engage actual social problems". In ''Building partnerships for service-learning'', Barbara Jacoby writes that Service-learning "is based on the work of researchers and theorists on learning, including [[John Dewey]], [[Jean Piaget]], [[Kurt Lewin]], [[Donald Schon]], and [[David Kolb]], who believe that we learn through combinations of action and reflection."&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web | url =https://www.nl.edu/media/nlu/downloadable/studentservices/civicengagement/chapter-1.pdf | title =Service-Learning Faculty Manual | last1 =Lukenchuk | first1 =Antonina | last2 =Jagla | first2 =Virginia | last3 =Eigel | first3 =Matthew | publisher =National Louis University | access-date =November 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979 Robert Sigmon called for a more precise definition in ''Service-Learning: Three Principles'', in which he said the term, which was relatively new, was being used to describe a number of different volunteer actions and experiential education programs.&lt;ref name=Sigmon1979&gt;{{cite journal | last = Sigmon | first = Robert | date = Spring 1979 | title = Service-Learning: Three Principles | url = http://critical.tamucc.edu/~wiki/uploads/AWebb/sl3p.pdf | language = English | journal = Synergist | pages = 9–11 | access-date = November 5, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Sigmon wrote that, in the late 1960s, the Southern Regional Education Board (SREB) popularized a service-learning internship model, that defined service-learning as "the integration of the accomplishment of a public task with conscious educational growth."&lt;ref name=Sigmon1979/&gt;{{rp|9}}

===In American education===
In 1992 Maryland adopted statewide service-learning requirements for high school graduation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Graduation Requirements|url=http://archives.marylandpublicschools.org/msde/programs/servicelearning/docs/requirements.htm|website=Maryland Department of Education}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the same year, the District of Columbia also adopted such requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DCPS Community Service Guide 2011–2012|url=http://cfo.dc.gov/sites/default/files/dc/sites/dcps/publication/attachments/DCPS%20Community%20Service%20Guide%20SY11-12%20FINAL.pdf|website=District of Columbia Public Schools|accessdate=7 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of other states have allowed credit toward graduation for service-learning/community service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://ecs.force.com/mbdata/mbquest3RTE?Rep=SL1301 | title =High School Graduation Requirement or Credit toward Graduation — Service-Learning/Community Service | date =January 2014 | publisher =Education Commission of the States (ECS) | access-date =November 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Learning==
Janet Eyler outlines the different ways student learn through service-learning in the book ''Where's the Learning in Service-Learning?''.  First, there is interpersonal learning, in which students re-evaluate personal values and motivations by channeling a passionate interest to service-learning projects, as well as build a connection and commitment to the community.  The second form is academic material that is taught through practical application and reflective instruction, so that it may be practiced outside classrooms and test-taking. Janet Eyler explains, "it is the product of continuous challenge to old conceptions and reflection on new ways to organize information and use the new material."  Thirdly is cognitive development where students are challenged to use critical thinking and problem-solving skills in a context that provides additional information and experience for student evaluation, because service-learning deals with numerous problems in complex situations.  The fourth form is transformation within the students, which "is about thinking about things in a new way and moving in new direction—creating a new picture without relying on the old lines."  Finally, service-learning focuses on effective citizenship and behavioral issues, and this helps the students better understand social issues relevant to their own community.  Learning in all these ways makes service-learning effective to those serving as well as those being served, for "learning begins with the impact of service-learning on the personal and interpersonal development of the students."&lt;ref name="Eyler 1999" /&gt;{{rp|16}}

According to Janet Eyler and Dwight E. Giles, there are numerous benefits to the service-learning approach. It provides experiential learning that connects personal and interpersonal development with cognitive and academic advancement,  providing opportunities for personal connections and ultimately transformation. Those serving may encounter certain social problems for the first time, thus transforming their view on the world. Beyond that, students may be transformed in the way of developing better problem-solving skills to address those problems about which they now know. A service-learning experience may be the catalyst in the life of a student to dive into the complexities of the social issues they have encountered and to seek to develop innovative solutions.

Service learning combines both [[experiential learning]] and [[community service]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Perez, Shivaun|title=Assessing Service Learning Using Pragmatic Principles of Education: A Texas Charter School Case Study|year=2000|journal=Applied Research Projects|series=Paper 76|publisher=Texas State University|url=http://ecommons.txstate.edu/arp/76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order for students to receive college credit for service-learning courses, a substantial amount of academic learning needs to accompany the service.&lt;ref name="Eyler 1999"/&gt;{{rp|12–13}} Janet Eyler outlines several impacts of learning that she believes evolves from service-learning. The first impact is Personal Connections.&lt;ref name="Eyler 1999"/&gt;{{rp|14–15}} When a person is passionate about a certain topic or cause, they will more likely want to make a difference by trying to mend the area with which they are passionate about.&lt;ref name="Eyler 1999"/&gt;{{rp|14–15}} Lifelong learners develop from students who are personally connected with their passion. Secondly, the usefulness of service-learning, according to Eyler, can impact a student for the rest of their lives.&lt;ref name="Eyler 1999"/&gt;{{rp|15–16}} Eyler points that learning the material for a test or exam in a classroom is one thing, but actually pulling that knowledge out and using it in new circumstances or in problems that arise in everyday life is another thing. Students have the chance to practice what they learn in the classroom by encountering life problems and have a chance to develop skill in how to develop solutions for the problems they face. The development of learning is the third impact that Eyler explains.&lt;ref name="Eyler 1999"/&gt;{{rp|16–17}} She writes that much of the knowledge that students have is not self-consumed, but rather developed from training obtained from the classroom and from daily life. Any thought or active development attained during service is more liable to impact the student, and the students' surroundings.  The fourth impact that Eyler explains is the transformational aspect of service-learning.&lt;ref name="Eyler 1999"/&gt;{{rp|17–18}} Students who participate in service are can be likely to develop different ways of thinking and approaching life. It may be a service-learning course that impacts the students' frame of thinking, while transforming the community as well. Finally, the fifth impact of learning is finding citizenship in our communities.&lt;ref name="Eyler 1999"/&gt;{{rp|18–19}} While the students are serving and impacting the community, they are very likely to find their role in society. Students can realize that they can make a difference and do have a part in their community. This realization can lead to citizenship, and active and acknowledged place in community. These five by-products of learning, as Janet Eyler outlines, are important to the progression of learning in service-learning.&lt;ref name="Eyler 1999"/&gt;{{rp|14–19}}

=== Factors ===
According to Eyler and Giles Jr., who conducted nationwide studies on service-learning, factors which influence its impact on students include placement quality, duration, and reflection.&lt;ref name="Eyler 1999" /&gt;{{rp|54–56}}&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Placement quality ====
According to Eyler and Giles, "''Placement quality'' refers to the extent that students in their community placements are challenged, are active rather than observers, do a variety of tasks, feel that they are making a positive contribution, have important levels of responsibility, and receive input and appreciation from supervisors in the field."&lt;ref name="Eyler 1999" /&gt;{{rp|33}} According to their research, placement quality has measurable effects on such things as "personal development outcomes," "increased leadership and communication skill," and connection to community, faculty, and other students.&lt;ref name="Eyler 1999" /&gt;{{rp|54–56}}

==== Duration ====
In ''The Importance of Program Quality in Service-Learning,'' Eyler and Giles state: "a program or a sequence of experiences needs to be of a long enough duration to have a developmental impact."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Importance of Program Quality in Service-Learning|last=Eyler|first=Janet|last2=Giles Jr.|first2=Dwight|work=Service-Learning: Applications From the Research|publisher=Psychology Press|year=2013|isbn=|editor-last=Waterman|editor-first=Alan S.|location=New York, NY|pages=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view is expanded upon by Alexander W. Astin and Linda J. Sax. In their opinion, "the amount of time devoted to providing service carries additional benefits beyond those benefits associated with the type of service performed, especially in the areas of civic responsibility and life skill development."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Astin|first=Alexander W.|last2=Sax|first2=Linda J.|date=1998|title=How Undergraduates are Affected by Service Participation|url=|journal=Journal of College Student Development|pages=260|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

But how much time is enough? According to J. Beth Mabry, "students should spend at least fifteen to nineteen hours in their service activities to have adequate exposure to the people and issues their service addresses."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mabry|first=J. Beth|date=1998|title=Pedagogical Variations in Service-Learning and Student Outcomes|url=|journal=Michigan Journal of Community Service-Learning|page=41|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Reflection ====
An essential feature of service-learning programs, reflection is a period of critical thinking performed by the student. For many advocates of the pedagogy, reflection may symbolize the learning that occurs in the student. Janet Eyler and Dwight E. Giles provide an example of this opinion in their book, ''Where's the Learning in Service-Learning?'' when they state: "learning occurs through a cycle of action and reflection, not simply through being able to recount what has been learned through reading and lecture."&lt;ref name="Eyler 1999" /&gt; Also, the National Service Learning Clearinghouse considers reflection to be a "core component" of service-learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.servicelearning.org/instant_info/fact_sheets/he_facts/he_reflection |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071114232334/http://www.servicelearning.org/instant_info/fact_sheets/he_facts/he_reflection/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=November 14, 2007 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=November 22, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some higher education programs require a reflection component in their service-learning classes. The University of Minnesota is one such institution that includes required reflection activities with its service learning classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.servicelearning.umn.edu/info/reflection.html|title=Reflection in service-learning classes|publisher=Center for Community-Engaged Learning|accessdate=June 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reflection may be done individually or as a group activity. Wartburg College in Indiana published a list of reflection activity suggestions on their website. These included various types of journaling, brainstorming as a group, using quotes, writing essays and papers, structured class discussions, and class presentations among other ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Service-Learning Reflection Activities | publisher=Wartburg College | accessdate=June 2, 2016 | author=Robin R. Jones | url=http://www.wartburg.edu/cce/cce/assessment%20and%20reflection/SL-Reflection%20Activities.pdf | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120905080645/http://www.wartburg.edu/cce/cce/assessment%20and%20reflection/SL-Reflection%20Activities.pdf | archivedate=September 5, 2012 | deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Effective service-learning programs also include required written reflection. Not only does writing permanently record a student's service-learning experience, but it also provides a helpful tool for continued reflection long after the program has been completed. Written reflection assignments also require students to stop, think, and articulate their learning. This evaluation is of incredible value to students.&lt;ref name="Eyler 2007" /&gt;{{rp|171–177}}

==Service==
High quality placements are a key to the success of a service-learning program. This requires the service learning establishment to have a broad network of connections within the community. Students need to have a positive connection with the establishment they're serving in order to maximize their learning.&lt;ref name="Eyler 2007"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Where's the Learning in Service-Learning?|last1=Eyler|first1=Janet|last2=Giles|first2=Dwight E.|year=2007|location=San Francisco, CA|publisher=Jossey-Bass|last-author-amp=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|167–170}}

Diversity is also a component of a successful service-learning program. By working with people of different ethnicities, lifestyles, and socioeconomic statuses, a student's learning and tolerance will increase. By serving in a diverse [[learning environment]], student are more likely to reduce stereotypes and increase their cultural appreciation. This can help a student learn how to more effectively serve a broader array of people.&lt;ref name="Eyler 2007" /&gt;{{rp|177–178}}

The Service in Service Learning takes knowledge outside the classroom into the real world with real people and situations.&amp;nbsp; In his book ''Banker to the Poor: Micro-lending and the Battle Against World Poverty'', Muhammad Yunus states that "If a university is a repository for knowledge, then some of this knowledge should spill over to the neighboring community. A university must not be an island where academics reach out to higher and higher levels of knowledge without sharing any of their findings."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Banker to The Poor|last=Yunus|first=Muhammad|publisher=PublicAffairs|year=2007|isbn=1-58648-198-3|location=United States of America|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Service brings community together as a whole, towards a common goal or purpose. Service is about what is for someone else. The action of service in and among the community, provides chances for sociocultural norms and prejudices to be removed. While some have questioned the positive effect and collective interest of the ''service'' side of service-learning, among those who perform the services, it has been made known that many would say otherwise.

==Effects==
Based upon various studies, students who participate in service-learning courses or projects seem to encounter a multitude of benefits. The book ''Where's the Learning in Service-Learning?'' discusses the effects of service learning on students, as well service learning in general.&lt;ref name="Eyler 1999" /&gt;

===Effects on the student===

In addition to interpersonal skills students have also reported developing personal leadership skills.&lt;ref name="UCLA - Service-Learning"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Alexander W. Astin|author2=Lori J. Vogelgesang|author3=Elaine K. Ikeda|author4=Jennifer A. Yee|title=How Service Learning Affects Students|url=http://digitalcommons.unomaha.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1145&amp;context=slcehighered|website=Digital Commons|accessdate=15 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another benefit seen is that it can also develop a sense of meaning and purpose in their academics.&lt;ref name="Eyler 1999" /&gt; 

Though one might not immediately think of serving others as affecting oneself, studies have found that "coming into contact with people whose life experiences and assumptions about the world are different calls one's own world into question."&lt;ref name="Eyler 1999"/&gt;{{rp|34}} Not only does the service experience move one to examine his own life, but it also allows him to produce a better version of himself. In their book, ''Where's the Learning in Service-Learning?'' Janet Eyler and Dwight E. Giles Jr. identify five key personal growth outcomes of service-learning: self-knowledge, spiritual growth, the reward of helping others, career benefits and careers in service, and changes in personal efficacy.&lt;ref name="Eyler 1999"/&gt;{{rp|35–39}} As one goes out into the community with the intent of reaching out to those within it, this broader social context causes one to see himself more clearly.&lt;ref name="Eyler 1999"/&gt;{{rp|35}}

Being involved in the educational process of service-learning also strengthens one's critical thinking and problem-solving skills, which is vital to facing modern-day dilemmas. This will transform a person's prior way of thinking, for critical thinking stimulates people to question assumptions and to "color outside the lines". According to Eyler and Giles Jr., "Transformative thinking is about thinking about things in a new way and moving in new directions—creating a new picture without relying on the old lines".&lt;ref name="Eyler 1999"/&gt;{{rp|17}}

It is in this way that service-learning motivates individuals to become better citizens of their communities. Many of those interested in reforming higher education have found that this experiential pedagogy helps to "cultivate civic and social responsibility as part of education for citizenship".&lt;ref name="Eyler 1999"/&gt;{{rp|12}} As individuals acquire knowledge about serving those around them, they can apply that knowledge to community problems, thus being able to make a greater difference in the world. People who realize their responsibility to their community will naturally develop into more productive members of society. 

Service-learning begins in the heart and mind of the individual; he must understand himself before he can attempt to understand others. This will prompt him to develop personal connections with those whom he is serving, for it is within community involvement where one's own understanding and knowledge are transformed.&lt;ref name="Eyler 1999"/&gt;{{rp|19}}

Researchers have found that these personal and interpersonal gains from engaging in service-learning classes where higher when the programs were of better quality. The biggest predictor of increased learning in communication skills was the high placement quality that the students were put into, allowing them to develop and "hone" their skills.&lt;ref name="Eyler 1999" /&gt;

Many experience interpersonal development through the service learning process. According to ''Where's the Learning in Service-Learning?'', among the students in their survey, "40 percent reported that learning to work with others was among the most important things they learned from service-learning, and 81 percent indicated that it was the most or very important." Learning to work with others is crucial for job placement in our world today. Another effect this has on the students is that they are more apt to learn how to lead. By working with others, the students are given opportunities to be more responsible and take initiative. Service-learning also encourages connection within the community. Truly, many learned how to listen to the voice of their communities. Not only that, but it helps form friendships and find other like-minded individuals who are involved with service learning. Above all it helps students to feel as though they are making a difference and matter to their communities. It was also found that quantity and quality of reflective discussion was linked to the outcome of feeling a closeness among the community and other students. An even more powerful outcome was the creation of a bond between a student and faculty member. In most classroom settings there's little room for a deep relationship between the student and teacher, while in service-learning often student and teacher will work alongside each other and develop a more lasting bond. As stated in ''Where's the Learning in Service-Learning?'', "Service participants in their assessment of Learn and Serve America were more likely than their peers to spend at least an hour a week interacting with a faculty member." Service-learning has a tremendous impact on students and how they learn, but also how they interact with others.&lt;ref name="Eyler 1999"/&gt;{{rp|45–52}}

===Diversity awareness===

Service-learning offers an opportunity for students to experience different cultures, which in turn reduces many negative and unnecessary stereotypes derived by inexperienced students. The appreciation of different cultures in service-learning happens because of the interaction that often occurs while completing a service. A survey on students who participated in service-learning finds that, "63 percent reported interacting with those receiving services at least fairly often, 60 percent reported frequent interaction with other volunteers, 51 percent felt that professionals at the placement site often took an interest in them, and 57 percent reported that they had frequent chances to work with people from ethnic groups other than their own."&lt;ref name="Eyler 2007" /&gt;{{rp|26}}

One of the goals of service-learning is positive interactions.&lt;ref name="Eyler 2007" /&gt;{{rp|26}}

People often only distinguish the differences between other cultures and communities and their own. These perceived differences often influence the decisions made when interacting with people of other cultures. Service-learning provides the opportunity for students to not only appreciate other cultures, but to appreciate their shared humanity.&lt;ref name="Eyler 2007" /&gt;{{rp|31}}

==Effects on community partners==
Service learning programs have developed rapidly within the last 30 years. From 1995–1997, 458 universities received grants from the Corporation for National Service's Learn and Serve Higher Education (LASHE) which enabled 3,000 new service-learning courses to be developed to the benefit of more than 60 students per course.&lt;ref name="Eyler 1999" /&gt;

Much of the research on the effects of service-learning is focused on what students learn through their service to the community; fewer studies have been conducted on the impact of service-learning on the communities where the students serve.&lt;ref name=Tryon&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tryon|first1=Elizabeth|last2=Stoecker|first2=Randy|title=The Unheard Voices: Community Organizations and Service-Learning|journal=Journal of Higher Education Outreach and Engagement|date=September 2008|volume=12|issue=3|url=http://openjournals.libs.uga.edu/index.php/jheoe/article/view/99/87|accessdate=13 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|47}}  Several studies that have been done on this topic measure the impact of service-learning on the community organizations with which college students volunteer, seeking to understand the organizations' perspectives on service-learning.&lt;ref name=Tryon/&gt;{{rp|48}}&lt;ref name="Sandy 2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sandy|first1=Marie|last2=Holland|first2=Barbara A.|title=Different Worlds and Common Ground: Community Partner Perspectives on Campus-Community Partnerships|journal=Michigan Journal of Community Service Learning|date=Fall 2006|volume=13|issue=1|pages=30–43|url=http://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/mjcsl/3239521.0013.103/--different-worlds-and-common-ground-community-partner?view=image|accessdate=13 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|31}}&lt;ref name="Vernon 2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vernon|first1=Andrea|last2=Ward|first2=Kelly|title=Campus and Community Partnerships: Assessing Impacts and Strengthening Connections|journal=Michigan Journal of Community Service Learning|date=1999|volume=6|issue=1|url=http://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/mjcsl/3239521.0006.103/--campus-and-community-partnerships-assessing-impacts?view=image|accessdate=13 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|30}}

One positive impact of service-learning on these organizations is the presence of more volunteers, which enables the organizations to accomplish more&lt;ref name="Sandy 2006" /&gt;{{rp|35–36}} and to serve more clients.&lt;ref name=Perla&gt;{{cite web|last1=Barrientos|first1=Perla|title=Community Service Learning and its Impact on Community Agencies: An Assessment Study|url=http://www.sfsu.edu/~icce/downloads/pdf/CSL%20Report%20for%20Publishing_3-25-10.pdf|website=www.sfsu.edu|publisher=San Francisco State University|accessdate=13 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|5}}  Students can use specific skills they possess to benefit the organization,&lt;ref name=Tryon/&gt;{{rp|49}} and can be a source of new ideas, energy, and enthusiasm.&lt;ref name="Vernon 2014" /&gt;{{rp|33}} Through partnering with a college or university, the organization can gain access to new knowledge and opportunities to connect with other organizations that have partnered with the same school.&lt;ref name="Sandy 2006" /&gt;{{rp|36}}

==In Native American communities==
Service-learning has been applied across a host of cultural settings, including numerous Native American communities. Guffey (1997) notes credible service learning begins with tribal ways of knowing and value systems, which is to say that outsiders should not impose service learning projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED416179|title=Learning with the Community: Concepts and Models for Service-Learning in Teacher Education. AAHE's Series on Service-Learning in the Disciplines.|author1=Erickson, Joseph A.|author2=Anderson, Jeffrey B.|date=30 November 1996|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather, tribal communities should devise projects that reflect needs unique to the community being served. This parallels Matthew Fletcher's (2010) assertion that tribes, and other historically marginalized communities, should unique develop educational programs, as opposed to merely adopting Westernized forms of education. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/American-Indian-Education-Counternarratives-Struggle/dp/0415957354|title=American Indian Education: Counternarratives in Racism, Struggle, and the Law|first=search|last=results|date=30 May 2008|publisher=Routledge|via=Amazon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to this view, service learning provides a pedagogical framework for tribes to address community needs. One such example is provided by Sykes, Pendley, and Deacon (2017) who provide a qualitative case study of a tribally-initiated service learning project embedded within a partnership at a research university.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://epress.lib.uts.edu.au/journals/index.php/ijcre/article/view/5334|title=Transformative learning, tribal membership and cultural restoration: A case study of an embedded Native American service-learning project at a research university|first1=Brent E.|last1=Sykes|first2=Joy|last2=Pendley|first3=Zermarie|last3=Deacon|date=22 June 2017|publisher=|journal=Gateways: International Journal of Community Research and Engagement|volume=10|pages=204–28|via=epress.lib.uts.edu.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; This case is unique in that it recounts how service learning students (who were also tribal members) came to collectively understand their responsibilities of citizenship through service. Moreover, tribal elders came to appreciate the importance of young citizens in maintaining and growing tribal culture. Thus, service learning can also be a means to explore cultural identity.

==Critiques==
There are numerous critiques of service-learning. In 1979, Robert Sigmon acknowledged criticisms that called service-learning, "a utopian vision" and "too demanding and impractical". He called for research into outcomes related to service-learning.&lt;ref name=Sigmon1979/&gt;{{rp|11}} Towson University Professor John Egger, writing in the Spring 2008 issue of the journal ''Academic Questions'', argued that service learning does not really teach useful skills or develop cultural knowledge. Instead, Egger maintained, service learning mainly involves the inculcation of communitarian political ideologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://ncsce.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/NoToServiceLearning_000.pdf|first=John|last=Egger|title= No Service to Learning: 'Service-Learning' Reappraised|journal=Academic Questions|volume=21|pages=183–194|year=2008|doi=10.1007/s12129-008-9057-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tulane Professor [[Carl L. Bankston]] III has described his own university's policy of mandating service learning as the imposition of intellectual conformity by the university administration on both students and faculty. According to Bankston, by identifying specific types of civic engagement as worthy community service, the university was prescribing social and political perspectives. He argued that this was inconsistent with the idea that individuals in a pluralistic society should choose their own civic commitments and that it was contrary to the ideal of the university as a site for the pursuit of truth through the free exchange of ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popecenter.org/commentaries/article.html?id=2537|author=[[Carl L. Bankston]] III|title=Modern Orthodoxies}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, these organizations face challenges in working with the students.  Communication with faculty is often inconsistent, so organizations do not always understand their roles and the roles of the faculty in students' service projects.&lt;ref name=Tryon/&gt;{{rp|55–56}}  Some organizations' representatives stated that faculty assigned students projects that were not allowed in their organization.&lt;ref name="Sandy 2006" /&gt;{{rp|37}}  Often the demographics of students do not match well with the demographics of the clients they serve, which can make it difficult for the students to relate to the clients&lt;ref name=Perla/&gt;{{rp|11}} or create an uncomfortable situation for the clients.&lt;ref name=Tryon/&gt;{{rp|54–55}}  The academic calendar students follow tends not to work well with the organizations' schedules, since students' volunteering schedules are interrupted for holiday breaks, finals, and other activities.&lt;ref name="Vernon 2014" /&gt;{{rp|33}} Also, the small number of hours students are required to spend volunteering can cause problems for organizations and their clients.  Some organizations require more hours for volunteer training than students are required to volunteer,&lt;ref name="Sandy 2006" /&gt;{{rp|39}} and making a personal connection with clients only to break it off soon after can be more hurtful than helpful.&lt;ref name=Tryon/&gt;{{rp|52}}

Representatives of community organizations where service-learning students volunteer expressed interest in working with colleges and universities to change service-learning programs so that they work more smoothly for the organizations. Their suggestions included establishing more consistent communication between faculty and organizations, creating longer-term partnerships between colleges and community organizations, and ensuring that the students and their projects are matched well with the organizations they serve.&lt;ref name=Tryon/&gt;{{rp|56–57}}&lt;ref name="Sandy 2006" /&gt;{{rp|34, 37, 40}}

In ''Downsizing Democracy: How America Sidelined Its Citizens and Privatized Its Public'', Matthew A. Crenson and Benjamin Ginsberg question whether service-learning is contributing to privatizing or downsizing citizenship practices. Responding to this, Christopher Koliba wrote that education providers may have the opportunity to change this trend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Koliba | first= Christopher

=== Comprehensive Action Plan for Service Learning (CAPSL) ===
* CAPSL Identifies four constituencies on which a program for service learning needs to focus its principal activities: institution, faculty, students, and community.
* CAPSL also identifies a sequence of activities (Planning; awareness; prototype; resources; expansion; recognition; monitoring; evaluation; research; institutionalization) to be pursued for each of the four constituencies(institution, faculty, students and community).
* CAPSL provides a heuristic for guiding the development of a service learning program in higher education.
* Advantages of CAPSL: it is general enough that the execution of each cell can be tailored to local conditions.
* Disadvantages of CAPSL: it is not possible to detail how each step can be successfully accomplished to take the sequence of activities from the whole CAPSL model and apply it to any cell in the matrix.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Robert|first=G. Bringle|author2=Julie A.

===Engineering education===
{{Main article|Service-learning in engineering education}}

Many engineering faculty members believe the educational solution lies in taking a more constructivist approach, where students construct knowledge and connections between nodes of knowledge as opposed to passively absorbing knowledge.  Educators see service learning as a way to both implement a [[Constructivism (learning theory)|constructivism]] in [[Engineers Without Borders|engineering education]] as well as match the teaching styles to the learning styles of typical engineering students.  As a result, many engineering schools have begun to integrate service learning into their curricula and there is now a journal dedicated to service learning in engineering.&lt;ref&gt;[[International Journal for Service Learning in Engineering]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious aspects===
In ''Where's the Learning in Service-Learning?'', Janet Eyler and Dwight E. Giles Jr. wrote, "Although fewer students chose spiritual growth as an important outcome of service-learning—20 percent selecting it as among the most important things they learned and 46 percent selecting it as very or most important—it was important to many students...Some saw service as a definite opportunity to fulfill their religious commitment."&lt;ref name="Eyler 1999" /&gt;{{rp|36, 37}}

Service-learning has both a service and a learning component. Eyler and Giles Jr. in ''Where's the Learning in Service-Learning?'' apply the term service-learning "to programs where the two foci are in balance, and study and action are explicitly integrated.&lt;ref name="Eyler 2007" /&gt;{{rp|4}}

Eyler and Giles Jr. have found that service-learning students, upon reflecting on their experience, find reward in helping others&lt;ref name="Eyler 2007" /&gt;{{rp|55}} and in developing close personal relationships.&lt;ref name="Eyler 2007" /&gt;{{rp|56}} The second focus in the term ''service-learning'', that of ''learning'', is defined by R. L. Atkinson as "a relatively permanent change in behavior that results from practice".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=So What Is Learning?|url=http://www.learningandteaching.info/learning/whatlearn.htm|website=What Is Learning?|accessdate=29 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the ''service'' and ''learning'' components stressed by Eyler and Giles, author David Bornstein references motivation in service. In ''How to Change the World: Social Entrepreneurs and the Power of New Ideas'', he states: "The key difference [between highly successful and average entrepreneurs has] more to do with the quality of their motivation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bornstein|first1=David|title=How to Change the World|date=2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-533476-0|page=238}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Service learning is about taking the student out of the classroom and placing them in an environment where they can make a difference while also learning. Service learning strengthens not just the community that is being helped but the person who is giving their time and effort to their cause, which benefits them socially, mentally, emotionally, and spiritually. For many service learning is simply tending to basic human needs: food, water, clothes, and housing. Some organizations, such as The Salvation Army, also seek to attend to the spiritual side of service learning. They used the motto "soup, soap, and salvation"&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Andrzej Diniejko, [http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/salvation-army-founded "The Origin and Early Development of the Salvation Army in Victorian England"], "The Victorian Web", 11 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt; to show what they wanted to do with their ministry. "The Salvation Army sees no conflict between spiritual and social ministry. It seeks to serve people so as to satisfy both the spiritual and social dimensions of their needs."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/christianity/subdivisions/salvationarmy_1.shtml "Salvation Army"], BBC, 2009-07-30&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable people==
One contributor to the study of service learning is [[Alexander Astin]]. Astin, the Allan M. Cartter Distinguished Professor of Higher Education Emeritus and founding director of both Cooperative Institutional Research Program and Higher Education Research Institute&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Alexander Astin |url=https://gseis.ucla.edu/media/AlexanderAstinCV.pdf?x63302 |website=Curriculum Vitae |accessdate=18 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, formed a Theory of Involvement. This theory explains how student involvement in co-curricular activities positively affects college outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Alexander Astin's Theory of Involvement |url=https://studentdevelopmenttheory.weebly.com/astin.html |website=Student Development Theory |accessdate=18 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through a 1998 study of college seniors, Astin demonstrated that service greatly improves critical thinking skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Eyler |first1=Janet |last2=Giles |first2=Dwight E., Jr. |title=Where's the Learning in Service-Learning? |date=1999 |publisher=Jossey-Bass Publishers |location=San Francisco |isbn=0-7879-4483-1 |edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nadinne I.

Other skills, such as courage, forgiveness, and stewarding the earth, must be learned elsewhere. Therefore, she recommends service learning and community engagement, which “offer learning with and from wise people, who teach by example.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=TEDxPioneerValley - Nadinne Cruz - Education on Fire.mov |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycbQwCb2Gl8 |website=YouTube |accessdate=18 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Andrew Furco]], Associate Vice President for Public Engagement at the University of Minnesota and a professor&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Faculty &amp; Instructors |url=http://www.cehd.umn.edu/olpd/people/afurco/ |website=University of Minnesota |accessdate=18 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, has contributed a variety of literature to service learning, including two books: Service-Learning: The Essence of the Pedagogy and Service-Learning Through a Multidisciplinary Lens, which he co-authored with S. Billig.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Andrew Furco |url=https://talloiresnetwork.tufts.edu/andrew-furco/ |website=The Taillores Network |accessdate=18 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He gives five reasons engagement programs differ from engaged universities: “Engagement differs from outreach… is at the heart of the university’s identity… focuses on partnerships… is with, not to, for, or in communities… is about institutional transformation.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Maynard |first1=Meleah |title=Awesomely Urban: A Conversation with Andrew Furco |url=https://umnalumni.org/UMAA-stories/Awesomely-Urban-Andrew-Furco |website=University of Minnesota Alumni Association |accessdate=18 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One other service-learning notable is [[James Kielsmeier]]. Kielsmeier founded the National Youth Leadership Council, a nonprofit that became the service-learning movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Founder |url=https://nylc.org/leadership-team/founder/ |website=National Youth Leadership Council |accessdate=18 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kielsmeier posits that service learning involves a change in how schools see young people: from “resource users, recipients, and victims” to “contributors, givers, and leaders”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Service and schools -- partnership on purpose: Jim Kielsmeier at TEDxFargo |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7AkyEuS6QU |website=YouTube |accessdate=18 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''seven management and planning tools''' have their roots in [[operations research]] work done after World War II and the Japanese ''[[total quality control]]'' (TQC) research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|year=1979 |title=Seven New Quality Tools for Managers and Staff}} translated into English 1983&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asq.org/learn-about-quality/new-management-planning-tools/overview/overview.html Seven New Management and Planning Tools]&lt;/ref&gt;

== The seven tools ==

===Affinity diagram (KJ method)===
[[Image:AffinitySmall.gif|Affinity diagram|left]]
[[Affinity diagram]]s are a special kind of [[brainstorming]] tool that  organize large amounts of disorganized data and information into groupings based on natural relationships.

It was created in the 1960s by the Japanese anthropologist Jiro Kawakita. It is also known as KJ diagram, after Jiro Kawakita. An affinity diagram is used when:
# You are confronted with many facts or ideas in apparent chaos.
# Issues seem too large and complex to grasp.
{{clear}}

===Interrelationship diagram===
{{see also|Cause-and-effect diagram}}
[[Image:InterrelationshipSmall.gif|Interrelationship digraph|left]]
Interrelationship diagrams (IDs) displays all the interrelated [[causality|cause-and-effect]] relationships and factors involved in a complex problem and describes desired outcomes. The process of creating an interrelationship diagram helps a group analyze the natural links between different aspects of a complex situation.
{{clear}}

===Tree diagram===
[[Image:TreeDiagramSmall.gif|Tree diagram|left]]
This tool is used to break down broad categories into finer and finer levels of detail. It can map levels of details of tasks that are required to accomplish a goal or solution or task. Developing a [[event tree|tree diagram]] directs concentration from generalities to specifics.
{{clear}}

===Prioritization matrix===
[[Image:MatrixSmall.gif|Matrix diagram|left]]
This tool is used to prioritize items and describe them in terms of weighted criteria. It uses a combination of tree and [[matrix diagram]]ming techniques to do a pair-wise evaluation of items and to narrow down options to the most desired or most effective. Popular applications for the prioritization matrix include [[return on investment]] (ROI) or [[cost–benefit analysis]] (investment vs. return), [[Priority Matrix|time management matrix]] (urgency vs. importance), etc.
{{clear}}

===Matrix diagram or quality table===
[[Image:MatrixSmall.gif|Matrix diagram|left]]
This tool shows the relationship between two or more sets of elements. At each intersection, a relationship is either absent or present. It then gives information about the relationship, such as its strength, the roles played by various individuals or measurements. The matrix diagram enables you to analyze relatively complex situations by exposing interactions and dependencies between things. Six differently shaped matrices are possible: L, T, Y, X, C, R and roof-shaped, depending on how many groups must be compared.
{{clear}}

===Process decision program chart===
[[Image:ProcessDecisionSmall.gif|Process decision program chart|left]]
A useful way of planning is to break down tasks into a hierarchy, using a tree diagram. The [[process decision program chart]] (PDPC) extends the tree diagram a couple of levels to identify risks and countermeasures for the bottom level tasks. Different shaped boxes are used to highlight risks and identify possible countermeasures (often shown as "clouds" to indicate their uncertain nature). The PDPC is similar to the [[failure modes and effects analysis]] (FMEA) in that both identify risks, consequences of failure, and contingency actions; the FMEA also rates relative risk levels for each potential failure point.
{{clear}}

===Activity network diagram===
{{see also|Program evaluation and review technique}}
[[Image:ActivityNetworkSmall.gif|Arrow diagram|left]]
This tool is used to plan the appropriate sequence or schedule for a set of tasks and related subtasks. It is used when subtasks must occur in parallel. The diagram helps in determining the [[critical path method|critical path]] (longest sequence of tasks). The purpose is to help people sequentially define, organize, and manage a complex set of activities.

[[File:Sexual cycle.svg|thumb|250px|right|In the first stage of sexual reproduction, "meiosis", the number of chromosomes is reduced from a [[diploid]] number (2n) to a [[haploid]] number (n). During "fertilization", haploid gametes come together to form a diploid zygote and the original number of chromosomes is restored.]]

'''Sexual reproduction''' is a kind of [[Biological life cycle|life cycle]] where generations alternate between cells with a single set of [[chromosome]]s ([[haploid]]) and cells with a double set of chromosomes ([[diploid]]).&lt;ref&gt;John Maynard Smith &amp; Eörz Szathmáry, The Major Transitions in Evolution, [[W. H. Freeman and Company]], 1995, p 149&lt;/ref&gt; ''Sexual reproduction'' is by far the most common life cycle in [[eukaryotes]], for example animals and plants. 

Diploid cells divide into haploid cells in a process called [[meiosis]]. Two haploid cells combine into one diploid cell in a process called [[fertilisation]]. Between fertilisation and meiosis there can be a large number of [[mitosis|cell division]]s without change of the number of chromosomes.  

[[Fertilization]] creates a single-celled [[zygote]] which includes genetic material from both gametes. In a process called [[genetic recombination]], genetic material ([[DNA]]) joins up so that [[homologous chromosome]] sequences are aligned with each other, and this is followed by exchange of genetic information. Two rounds of cell division then produce four daughter cells with half the number of chromosomes from each original parent cell, and the same number of chromosomes as both parents. For instance, in [[human reproduction]] each human cell contains 46 chromosomes in 23 pairs. Meiosis in the parents' gonads produce gamete cells which only contain 23 chromosomes each. When the gametes are combined via [[sexual intercourse]] to form a fertilized egg, the resulting child will have 23 chromosomes from each parent genetically recombined into 23 chromosome pairs or 46 total.

Cell division [[mitosis]] then initiates the development of a new individual [[organism]] in [[multicellular organism]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/fertilization | title = Fertilization | publisher = Merriam-Webster | accessdate = 2013-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; including [[animal]]s and [[plant]]s, for the vast majority of whom this is the primary method of reproduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Otto|first1=Sarah P.|last2=Lenormand|first2=Thomas|title=EVOLUTION OF SEX: RESOLVING THE PARADOX OF SEX AND RECOMBINATION|journal=Nature Reviews Genetics|date=1 April 2002|volume=3|issue=4|pages=252–261|doi=10.1038/nrg761|pmid=11967550}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[evolution of sexual reproduction]] is a major puzzle because [[asexual reproduction]] should be able to outcompete it as every young organism created can bear its own young. This implies that an asexual population has an intrinsic capacity to grow more rapidly with each generation.&lt;ref name="maynard"&gt;[[John Maynard Smith]] ''The Evolution of Sex'' 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; This 50% cost is a [[fitness (biology)|fitness]] disadvantage of sexual reproduction.&lt;ref&gt;Ridley M (2004) Evolution, 3rd edition. Blackwell Publishing, p. 314.&lt;/ref&gt; The two-fold cost of sex includes this cost and the fact that any organism can only pass on 50% of its own genes to its offspring. One definite advantage of sexual reproduction is that it prevents the accumulation of genetic [[mutation]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1038/ng.3216 | pmid = 25685891 | laydate = 4 March 2015 | laysummary = http://www.oxfordtoday.ox.ac.uk/opinion/making-sense-sex | journal = Nature Genetics | title = Recombination affects accumulation of damaging and disease-associated mutations in human populations | year = 2015 | last1 = Hussin | first1 = Julie G | last2 = Hodgkinson | first2 = Alan | last3 = Idaghdour | first3 = Youssef | last4 = Grenier | first4 = Jean-Christophe | last5 = Goulet | first5 = Jean-Philippe| last6 = Gbeha | first6 = Elias | last7 = Hip-Ki | first7 = Elodie | last8 = Awadalla | first8 = Philip | volume=47 | issue = 4 | pages=400–404}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sexual selection]] is a mode of [[natural selection]] in which some individuals out-reproduce others of a population because they are better at securing [[Mating|mates]] for sexual reproduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Biology: The Unity &amp; Diversity of Life|year=2013|publisher=Cengage Learning|page=281|author=Cecie Starr|edition=Ralph Taggart, Christine Evers, Lisa Starr}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PHYS-20140129"&gt;{{cite news |last=Vogt |first=Yngve |title=Large testicles are linked to infidelity |url=http://phys.org/news/2014-01-large-testicles-linked-infidelity.html |date=January 29, 2014 |work=[[Phys.org]] |accessdate=January 31, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been described as "a powerful evolutionary force that does not exist in asexual populations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=11395771|year=2001|author1=Agrawal|first1=A. F.|title=Sexual selection and the maintenance of sexual reproduction|journal=Nature|volume=411|issue=6838|pages=692–5|doi=10.1038/35079590}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Prokaryote]]s, whose initial cell has additional or transformed genetic material, reproduce through asexual reproduction but may,  in [[lateral gene transfer]], display processes such as [[bacterial conjugation]], [[transformation (genetics)|transformation]] and [[transduction (genetics)|transduction]], which are similar to sexual reproduction although they do not lead to reproduction.

==Evolution==
{{main|Evolution of sexual reproduction}}
The first [[fossil]]ized evidence of sexual reproduction in eukaryotes is from the [[Stenian]] period, about 1 to 1.2 billion years ago.&lt;ref name=dateref&gt;
{{cite journal | author = N.J. Buttefield | year = 2000 | title = Bangiomorpha pubescens n.  gen., n. sp.: implications for the evolution of sex, multicellularity,  and the Mesoproterozoic/Neoproterozoic radiation of eukaryotes | url = http://paleobiol.geoscienceworld.org/content/26/3/386.abstract | journal = [[Paleobiology (journal)|Paleobiology]] | volume = 26 | issue = 3 | pages = 386–404 | doi = 10.1666/0094-8373(2000)026&lt;0386:BPNGNS&gt;2.0.CO;2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biologists studying [[evolution]] propose several explanations for why sexual reproduction developed and why it is maintained. These reasons include reducing the likelihood of the [[Mullers ratchet|accumulation]] of deleterious mutations, increasing rate of [[red queen hypothesis|adaptation to changing environments]],&lt;ref name=Gray2012&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gray | first1 = J. C. | last2 = Goddard | first2 = M. R. | title = Gene-flow between niches facilitates local adaptation in sexual populations | journal = Ecology Letters | volume = 15 | issue = 9 | pages =  955–962| year = 2012 | pmid =  | pmc =  | doi = 10.1111/j.1461-0248.2012.01814.x | editor1-first = Michael | editor1-last = Bonsall }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[tangled bank hypothesis|dealing with competition]], and masking deleterious mutations.&lt;ref name="Michod"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Michod RE, Bernstein H, Nedelcu AM | title = Adaptive value of sex in microbial pathogens | journal = Infect. Genet. Evol. | volume = 8 | issue = 3 | pages = 267–85 |date=May 2008  | pmid = 18295550 | doi = 10.1016/j.meegid.2008.01.002 | url = http://www.hummingbirds.arizona.edu/Faculty/Michod/Downloads/IGE%20review%20sex.pdf | format=PDF| last2 = Bernstein | last3 = Nedelcu }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bernstein1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bernstein2 "/&gt;  All of these ideas about why sexual reproduction has been maintained are generally supported, but ultimately the size of the population determines if sexual reproduction is entirely beneficial. Larger [[population]]s appear to respond more quickly to benefits obtained through sexual reproduction than do smaller population sizes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=12478292|year=2002|author1=Colegrave|first1=N|title=Sex releases the speed limit on evolution|journal=Nature|volume=420|issue=6916|pages=664–6|doi=10.1038/nature01191|bibcode=2002Natur.420..664C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maintenance of sexual reproduction has been explained by theories that work at several [[levels of selection]], though some of these models remain controversial.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} However, newer models presented in recent years suggest a basic advantage for sexual reproduction in slowly reproducing [[complex organism]]s.

Sexual reproduction allows these species to exhibit characteristics that depend on the specific [[Natural environment|environment]] that they inhabit, and the particular survival strategies that they employ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/s12064-009-0077-9|title=Diploidy and the selective advantage for sexual reproduction in unicellular organisms|year=2009|last1=Kleiman|first1=Maya|last2=Tannenbaum|first2=Emmanuel|journal=Theory in Biosciences|volume=128|issue=4|pages=249–85|pmid=19902285|arxiv=0901.1320}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sexual selection==
{{main|Sexual selection}}
In order to sexually reproduce, both males and females need to find a [[mating|mate]]. Generally in animals [[mate choice]] is made by females while males compete to be chosen. This can lead [[organism]]s to extreme efforts in order to reproduce, such as combat and display, or produce extreme features caused by a [[positive feedback]] known as a [[Fisherian runaway]]. Thus sexual reproduction, as a form of [[natural selection]], has an effect on [[evolution]]. [[Sexual dimorphism]] is where the basic [[phenotypic trait]]s vary between males and females of the same [[species]]. Dimorphism is found in both [[sex organ]]s and in [[secondary sex characteristics]], body size, physical strength and morphology, [[biological ornament]]ation, [[behavior]] and other bodily traits. However, sexual selection is only implied over an extended period of time leading to sexual dimorphism.&lt;ref&gt;Dimijian, G. G. (2005). Evolution of sexuality: biology and behavior. Proceedings (Baylor University. Medical Center), 18, 244–258.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sex ratio==
Apart from some [[Eusociality|eusocial]] [[wasp]]s, organisms which reproduce sexually have a 1:1 [[sex ratio]] of male and female births. The English statistician and biologist [[Ronald Fisher]] outlined why this is so in what has come to be known as [[Fisher's principle]].&lt;ref name=Hamilton67&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.156.3774.477 | last1 = Hamilton | first1 = W.D. | year = 1967 | title = Extraordinary sex ratios | url = http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/refs/156/3774/477 | journal = Science | volume = 156 | issue = 3774| pages = 477–488 | pmid = 6021675 |bibcode = 1967Sci...156..477H }}&lt;/ref&gt; This essentially says the following:

:# Suppose male births are less common than female.
:# A newborn male then has better mating prospects than a newborn female, and therefore can expect to have more offspring.
:# Therefore parents genetically disposed to produce males tend to have more than average numbers of grandchildren born to them.
:# Therefore the genes for male-producing tendencies spread, and male births become more common.
:# As the 1:1 sex ratio is approached, the advantage associated with producing males dies away.
:# The same reasoning holds if females are substituted for males throughout. Therefore 1:1 is the equilibrium ratio.

===Insects===
{{further|Insect#Reproduction and development}}
[[File:Australian Emperor mating and laying.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Australian emperor]] laying egg, guarded by the male]]
Insect species make up more than two-thirds of all [[Extant taxon|extant]] animal species. Most insect species reproduce sexually, though some species are facultatively [[parthenogenetic]]. Many insects species have [[sexual dimorphism]], while in others the sexes look nearly identical. Typically they have two sexes with males producing spermatozoa and females ova. The ova develop into eggs that have a covering called the [[chorion]], which forms before internal fertilization. Insects have very diverse mating and reproductive strategies most often resulting in the male depositing [[spermatophore]] within the female, which she stores until she is ready for egg fertilization. After fertilization, and the formation of a zygote, and varying degrees of development, in many species the eggs are deposited outside the female; while in others, they develop further within the female and are born live.

===Mammals===
{{main|Mammalian reproduction}}
{{See also|Human reproduction}}
There are three extant kinds of mammals: [[monotreme]]s, [[placental]]s and [[marsupial]]s, all with internal fertilization. In placental mammals, offspring are born as juveniles: complete animals with the [[sex organ]]s present although not reproductively functional. After several months or years, depending on the species, the sex organs develop further to maturity and the animal becomes [[Sexual maturity|sexually mature]]. Most female mammals are only [[fertility|fertile]] during certain periods during their [[estrous]] cycle, at which point they are ready to mate. Individual male and female mammals meet and carry out [[animal sexual behavior#Mammals|copulation]].{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} For most mammals, males and females [[Promiscuity|exchange sexual partners throughout their adult lives]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Reichard|first=U.H. |title=Monogamy—A variable relationship |journal=Max Planck Research |volume=3 |pages=62–7 |year=2002|url=http://www.mpg.de/1028786/W001_Biology-Medicine_062_067.pdf|format=PDF|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130524204835/http://www.mpg.de/1028786/W001_Biology-Medicine_062_067.pdf|archivedate=24 May 2013|accessdate=24 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Barash,Lipton,2001"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Lipton, Judith Eve |author2=Barash, David P. |title=The Myth of Monogamy: Fidelity and Infidelity in Animals and People |publisher=W.H.

===Fish===
{{further|Fish#Reproductive system}}
The vast majority of fish species lay eggs that are then fertilized by the male,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seaworld.org/animal-info/info-books/bony-fish/reproduction.htm BONY FISHES - Reproduction&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; some species lay their eggs on a substrate like a rock or on plants, while others scatter their eggs and the eggs are fertilized as they drift or sink in the water column.

Some fish species use internal fertilization and then disperse the developing eggs or give birth to live offspring. Fish that have live-bearing offspring include the [[guppy]] and mollies or ''[[Poecilia]]''. Fishes that give birth to live young can be [[ovoviviparous]], where the eggs are fertilized within the female and the eggs simply hatch within the female body, or in [[seahorse]]s, the male carries the developing young within a pouch, and gives birth to live young.&lt;ref name=Cavendish2001&gt;
{{Cite book | author = M. Cavendish | year = 2001 | title = Endangered Wildlife and Plants of the World | url = https://books.google.com/?id=s5zZJVu2hxYC&amp;pg=PA1254 | page = 1252 | isbn = 978-0-7614-7194-3 | publisher = Marshall Cavendish | accessdate = 2013-11-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fishes can also be [[viviparous]], where the female supplies nourishment to the internally growing offspring.  Some fish are [[hermaphrodite]]s, where a single fish is both male and female and can produce eggs and sperm. In hermaphroditic fish, some are male and female at the same time while in other fish they are serially hermaphroditic; starting as one sex and changing to the other. In at least one hermaphroditic species, self-fertilization occurs when the eggs and sperm are released together. Internal self-fertilization may occur in some other species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Orlando EF, Katsu Y, Miyagawa S, Iguchi T | year = 2006 | title = Cloning and differential  expression of estrogen receptor and aromatase genes in the self-fertilizing  hermaphrodite and male mangrove rivulus, Kryptolebias marmoratus | journal = [[Journal of Molecular Endocrinology]] | volume = 37 | issue = 2 | pages = 353–365 | doi = 10.1677/jme.1.02101 | pmid = 17032750 | last2 = Katsu | last3 = Miyagawa | last4 = Iguchi }}&lt;/ref&gt; One fish species does not reproduce by sexual reproduction but uses sex to produce offspring; ''[[Poecilia formosa]]'' is a unisex species that uses a form of [[parthenogenesis]] called [[gynogenesis]], where unfertilized eggs develop into embryos that produce female offspring. ''Poecilia formosa'' mate with males of other fish species that use internal fertilization, the sperm does not fertilize the eggs but stimulates the growth of the eggs which develops into embryos.&lt;ref&gt;

==Plants==
{{main|Plant reproduction}}
Animals typically produce gametes directly by meiosis. Male gametes are called sperm, and female gametes are called eggs or ova. In animals, fertilization follows immediately after meiosis. Plants on the other hand have mitosis occurring in spores, which are produced by meiosis. The spores germinate into the gametophyte phase. The gametophytes of different groups of plants vary in size; angiosperms have as few as three cells in pollen, and mosses and other so called primitive plants may have several million cells. Plants have an [[alternation of generations]] where the sporophyte phase is succeeded by the gametophyte phase. The sporophyte phase produces spores within the sporangium by meiosis.

===Flowering plants===
[[File:hosta3.jpg|thumb|right|Flowers are the sexual organs of flowering plants.]]
[[Flowering plant]]s are the dominant plant form on land and they reproduce either sexually or asexually. Often their most distinguishing feature is their reproductive organs, commonly called flowers.  The [[Stamen|anther]] produces [[pollen|pollen grains]] which contain the male [[gametophyte]]s (sperm). For pollination to occur, pollen grains must attach to the stigma of the female reproductive structure ([[carpel]]), where the female gametophytes (ovules) are located inside the [[ovary]]. After the pollen tube grows through the carpel's style, the [[sex]] cell nuclei from the pollen grain migrate into the ovule to fertilize the egg cell and endosperm nuclei within the female gametophyte in a process termed [[double fertilization]]. The resulting zygote develops into an embryo, while the triploid endosperm (one sperm cell plus two female cells) and female tissues of the ovule give rise to the surrounding tissues in the developing seed. The ovary, which produced the female gametophyte(s), then grows into a [[fruit]], which surrounds the seed(s). Plants may either [[Self-pollination|self-pollinate]] or [[pollination|cross-pollinate]].

Nonflowering plants like [[fern]]s, [[moss]] and [[Marchantiophyta|liverwort]]s use other means of sexual reproduction.

In 2013, flowers dating from the [[Cretaceous]] (100 million years before present) were found encased in amber, the oldest evidence of sexual reproduction in a flowering plant. Microscopic images showed tubes growing out of pollen and penetrating the flower's stigma. The pollen was sticky, suggesting it was carried by insects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=George O |last=Poinar Jr. |first2=Kenton L |last2=Chambers |first3=Joerg |last3=Wunderlich |title=Micropetasos, a new genus of angiosperms from mid-Cretaceous Burmese amber |journal=J.

===Ferns===
Ferns mostly produce large diploid [[sporophyte]]s with [[rhizome]]s, roots and leaves; and on fertile leaves called [[sporangium]], [[spore]]s are produced. The spores are released and germinate to produce short, thin gametophytes that are typically heart shaped, small and green in color. The gametophytes or [[thallus]], produce both motile sperm in the [[antheridia]] and egg cells in separate [[archegonia]]. After rains or when dew deposits a film of water, the motile sperm are splashed away from the antheridia, which are normally produced on the top side of the thallus, and swim in the film of water to the archegonia where they fertilize the egg. To promote out crossing or cross fertilization the sperm are released before the eggs are receptive of the sperm, making it more likely that the sperm will fertilize the eggs of different thallus. A [[zygote]] is formed after fertilization, which grows into a new sporophytic plant. The condition of having separate sporephyte and gametophyte plants is called [[alternation of generation]]s. Other plants with similar reproductive means include the  ''[[Psilotum]]'', ''[[Lycopodium]]'', ''[[Selaginella]]'' and ''[[Equisetum]]''.

===Bryophytes===
The [[bryophyte]]s, which include [[Marchantiophyta|liverwort]]s, [[hornwort]]s and [[moss]]es, reproduce both sexually and [[Vegetative reproduction|vegetatively]]. They are small plants found growing in moist locations and like ferns, have motile sperm with [[flagella]] and need water to facilitate sexual reproduction. These plants start as a haploid spore that grows into the dominate form, which is a multicellular haploid body with leaf-like structures that [[photosynthesis|photosynthesize]]. Haploid gametes are produced in antherida and archegonia by mitosis. The sperm released from the antherida respond to chemicals released by ripe archegonia and swim to them in a film of water and fertilize the egg cells thus producing a zygote.  The [[zygote]] divides by mitotic division and grows into a sporophyte that is diploid.  The multicellular diploid sporophyte produces structures called spore capsules, which are connected by [[seta]] to the archegonia. The spore capsules produce spores by meiosis, when ripe the capsules burst open and the spores are released. Bryophytes show considerable variation in their breeding structures and the above is a basic outline. Also in some species each plant is one sex while other species produce both sexes on the same plant.&lt;ref&gt;

[[Fungi]] are classified by the methods of sexual reproduction they employ.  The outcome of sexual reproduction most often is the production of [[resting spore]]s that are used to survive inclement times and to spread. There are typically three phases in the sexual reproduction of fungi: [[plasmogamy]], [[karyogamy]] and [[meiosis]]. The cytoplasm of two parent cells fuse during plasmogamy and the nuclei fuse during karyogamy. New haploid gametes are formed during meiosis and develop into spores.

==Bacteria and archaea==
Three distinct processes in [[prokaryote]]s are regarded as similar to [[Origin and function of meiosis|eukaryotic sex]]: [[bacterial transformation]], which involves the incorporation of foreign DNA into the bacterial chromosome; [[bacterial conjugation]], which is a transfer of [[plasmid]] DNA between bacteria, but the plasmids are rarely incorporated into the bacterial chromosome; and [[Prokaryote#Gene transfer|gene transfer and genetic exchange in archaea]].

Bacterial transformation involves the [[genetic recombination|recombination of genetic material]] and its function is mainly associated with [[Sexual recombination#Recombinational repair|DNA repair]]. Bacterial transformation is a complex process encoded by numerous bacterial genes, and is a bacterial adaptation for DNA transfer.&lt;ref name="Michod" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bernstein1"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1525/bio.2010.60.7.5|title=Evolutionary Origin of Recombination during Meiosis|year=2010|last1=Bernstein|first1=Harris|last2=Bernstein|first2=Carol|journal=BioScience|volume=60|issue=7|pages=498–505}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process occurs naturally in at least 40 bacterial species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=7968924|year=1994|last1=Lorenz|first1=MG|last2=Wackernagel|first2=W|title=Bacterial gene transfer by natural genetic transformation in the environment|volume=58|issue=3|pages=563–602|pmc=372978|journal=Microbiological Reviews}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a bacterium to bind, take up, and recombine exogenous DNA into its chromosome, it must enter a special physiological state referred to as competence (see [[Natural competence]]). Sexual reproduction in early single-celled eukaryotes may have evolved from bacterial transformation,&lt;ref name="Bernstein2"&gt;Bernstein H, Bernstein C, Michod RE.

Open access for reading only. {{ISBN|978-1-62100-756-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; or from a similar process in archaea (see below).

On the other hand, bacterial conjugation is a type of direct transfer of DNA between two bacteria through an external appendage called the conjugation pilus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=22986519|year=2012|last1=Lodé|first1=T|title=Have Sex or Not?

The infrequent integration of a plasmid into a host bacterial chromosome, and the subsequent transfer of a part of the host chromosome to another cell do not appear to be bacterial adaptations.&lt;ref name="Michod" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Krebs|first1=JE|last2=Goldstein|first2=ES|last3=Kilpatrick|first3=ST|year=2011|title=Lewin's GENES X|pages=289–292|publisher=Jones and Bartlett Publishers|location=Boston|isbn=9780763766320}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Exposure of hyperthermophilic archaeal Sulfolobus species to DNA damaging conditions induces cellular aggregation accompanied by high frequency genetic marker exchange.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fröls S, Ajon M, Wagner M, Teichmann D, Zolghadr B, Folea M, Boekema EJ, Driessen AJ, Schleper C, Albers SV | year = 2008 | title = UV-inducible cellular aggregation of the hyperthermophilic archaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus is mediated by pili formation | url = | journal = Mol Microbiol | volume = 70 | issue = 4| pages = 938–952 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2958.2008.06459.x | pmid = 18990182 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ajon"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ajon M, Fröls S, van Wolferen M, Stoecker K, Teichmann D, Driessen AJ, Grogan DW, Albers SV, Schleper C | title = UV-inducible DNA exchange in hyperthermophilic archaea mediated by type IV pili | journal = Mol.

'''Sustainable development''' is the [[organizing principle]] for meeting [[Human development (humanity)|human development]] goals while at the same time [[Sustainability|sustaining]] the ability of natural systems to provide the [[natural resource]]s and [[ecosystem services]] upon which the [[economy]] and [[society]] depend. The desired result is a state of society where living conditions and resource use continue to meet human needs without undermining the integrity and stability of the natural system. Sustainable development can be classified as development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations.

While the modern concept of sustainable development is derived mostly from the 1987 [[Brundtland Commission|Brundtland Report]], it is also rooted in earlier ideas about [[sustainable forest management]] and twentieth century environmental concerns. As the concept developed, it has shifted to focus more on [[economic development]], [[Social change|social development]] and environmental protection for future generations. It has been suggested that "the term 'sustainability' should be viewed as humanity's target goal of human-ecosystem equilibrium (homeostasis), while 'sustainable development' refers to the holistic approach and temporal processes that lead us to the end point of sustainability".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Shaker |first=Richard Ross |date=September 2015 |title=The spatial distribution of development in Europe and its underlying sustainability correlations |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0143622815001745 |journal=Applied Geography |volume=63 |pages=&lt;!-- 304–314 --&gt; |at=p. 35 |doi=10.1016/j.apgeog.2015.07.009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The modern economies are endeavouring to reconcile ambitious economic development and obligations of preserving the [[natural resource]]s and [[Ecosystem services|ecosystem]], the two are traditionally seen as of conflicting nature. Instead of holding climate change commitments and other sustainability measures as a drug to economic development, turning and leveraging them into market opportunities will do greater good. The economic development brought by such organized principles and practices in an [[economy]] is called Managed Sustainable Development (MSD).

The concept of sustainable development has been—and still is—subject to criticism, including the question of what is to be sustained in sustainable development. It has been argued{{weasel inline|date=October 2018}} that there is no such thing as a sustainable use of a [[non-renewable resource]], since any positive rate of exploitation will eventually lead to the exhaustion of earth's finite stock. The United Nations organized an international conference in Stockholm, Sweden from 5 to 16 June 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.un-documents.net/unchedec.htm|title=Declaration of the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment - A/CONF.48/14/Rev.1 Chapter I - UN Documents: Gathering a body of global agreements|last=Environment|first=United Nations Conference on the Human|website=www.un-documents.net|access-date=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sustainability can be defined as the practice of maintaining processes of productivity indefinitely—natural or human made—by replacing resources used with resources of equal or greater value without degrading or endangering natural biotic systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Communicating Sustainability for the Green Economy|publisher=M.E. Sharpe|year=2014|isbn=978-0-7656-3680-5|location=New York|author=Lynn R. Kahle, Eda Gurel-Atay, Eds}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sustainable development ties together concern for the [[carrying capacity]] of [[Systems ecology|natural systems]] with the social, political, and economic challenges faced by humanity. [[Sustainability science]] is the study of the concepts of sustainable development and environmental science. There is an additional focus on the present generations' responsibility to regenerate, maintain and improve planetary resources for use by future generations.&lt;ref name=Finn-2009&gt;{{cite book|last=Finn|first=Donovan|title=Our Uncertain Future: Can Good Planning Create Sustainable Communities?|publisher=University of Illinois|location=Champaign-Urbana|date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{RP|3-8}}

Sustainable development has its roots in ideas about [[sustainable forest management]] which were developed in Europe during the 17th and 18th centuries.&lt;ref name="Grober2"&gt;Ulrich Grober: Deep roots&amp;nbsp;— A conceptual history of "sustainable development" (Nachhaltigkeit), Wissenschaftszentrum Berlin für Sozialforschung, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Blewitt-2015"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Blewitt|first1=John|title=Understanding Sustainable Development|date=2015|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=9780415707824|edition=2nd|url=https://www.routledge.com/Understanding-Sustainable-Development-2nd-Edition/Blewitt/p/book/9780415707824|accessdate=26 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{RP|6-16}} In response to a growing awareness of the depletion of timber resources in England, [[John Evelyn]] argued that "sowing and planting of trees had to be regarded as a national duty of every landowner, in order to stop the destructive over-exploitation of natural resources" in his 1662 essay ''[[Sylva, or A Discourse of Forest-Trees and the Propagation of Timber|Sylva]]''. In 1713 [[Hans Carl von Carlowitz]], a senior mining administrator in the service of Elector [[Augustus II the Strong|Frederick Augustus I of Saxony]] published ''Sylvicultura oeconomica'', a 400-page work on forestry. Building upon the ideas of Evelyn and French minister [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert]], von Carlowitz developed the concept of managing forests for [[sustained yield]].&lt;ref name="Grober2" /&gt; His work influenced others, including [[Alexander von Humboldt]] and [[Georg Ludwig Hartig]], eventually leading to the development of a science of forestry. This in turn influenced people like [[Gifford Pinchot]], first head of the [[US Forest Service]], whose approach to forest management was driven by the idea of wise use of resources, and [[Aldo Leopold]] whose [[land ethic]] was influential in the development of the [[environmental movement]] in the 1960s.&lt;ref name="Grober2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Blewitt-2015"/&gt;

Following the publication of [[Rachel Carson]]'s ''[[Silent Spring]]'' in 1962, the developing environmental movement drew attention to the relationship between economic growth and development and environmental degradation. [[Kenneth E. Boulding]] in his influential 1966 essay ''The Economics of the Coming Spaceship Earth'' identified the need for the economic system to fit itself to the ecological system with its limited pools of resources.&lt;ref name="Blewitt-2015"/&gt; One of the first uses of the term sustainable in the contemporary sense was by the [[Club of Rome]] in 1972 in its classic report on the ''[[Limits to Growth]]'', written by a group of scientists led by [[Dennis Meadows|Dennis]] and [[Donella Meadows]] of the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]. Describing the desirable "state of global equilibrium", the authors wrote: "We are searching for a model output that represents a world system that is sustainable without sudden and uncontrolled collapse and capable of satisfying the basic material requirements of all of its people."&lt;ref name=Finn-2009/&gt;

Following the Club of Rome report, an MIT research group prepared ten days of hearings on "[http://www.wpainc.com/Archive/MIT/Growth%20and%20Its%20Implications.pdf Growth and Its Implication for the Future]" (Roundtable Press, 1973)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wpainc.com/Archive/MIT/Growth%20and%20Its%20Implications.pdf|title=Growth and its implications for the future|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the US Congress, the first hearings ever held on sustainable development. [[William Flynn Martin]], David Dodson Gray, and Elizabeth Gray prepared the hearings under the Chairmanship of Congressman [[John Dingell]].{{Citation needed|reason=This is not common historical knowledge and should probably be documented with a secondary source as well.|date=August 2018}}

In 1980 the [[International Union for the Conservation of Nature]] published a world conservation strategy that included one of the first references to sustainable development as a global priority&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url=http://www.a21italy.it/medias/31C2D26FD81B0D40.pdf|title=World Conservation Strategy: Living Resource Conservation for Sustainable Development|date=1980|publisher=International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources}}&lt;/ref&gt; and introduced the term "sustainable development".&lt;ref name=Sachs-2015&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Age of Sustainable Development|last=Sachs|first=Jeffrey D.|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2015|isbn=9780231173155|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{RP|4}} Two years later, the [[United Nations]] [[World Charter for Nature]] raised five principles of [[Conservation (ethic)|conservation]] by which human conduct affecting nature is to be guided and judged.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=World Charter for Nature|date=28 October 1982|url=https://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/37/a37r007.htm|publisher=United Nations, General Assembly, 48th Plenary Meeting}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987 the [[United Nations]] [[World Commission on Environment and Development]] released the report ''Our Common Future'', commonly called the Brundtland Report. The report included what is now one of the most widely recognised definitions of sustainable development.&lt;ref name="Brundtland2"&gt;{{Cite journal|year=1987|title=Report of the World Commission on Environment and Development|url=https://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/42/ares42-187.htm|publisher=United Nations|author=[[Brundtland Commission]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Economic Development, 2nd edition|last=Smith|first=Charles|publisher=Macmillan|year=1998|isbn=0-333-72228-0|location=Basingstoke|pages=|id=|authorlink=Charles Emrys Smith|author2=Rees, Gareth}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Pull quote|Sustainable development is development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.

Since the Brundtland Report, the concept of sustainable development has developed beyond the initial intergenerational framework to focus more on the goal of "socially inclusive and environmentally sustainable economic growth".&lt;ref name=Sachs-2015/&gt;{{RP|5}} In 1992, the [[UN Conference on Environment and Development]] published the [[Earth Charter]], which outlines the building of a just, sustainable, and peaceful global society in the 21st century. The action plan [[Agenda 21]] for sustainable development identified information, integration, and participation as key building blocks to help countries achieve development that recognises these interdependent pillars. It emphasises that in sustainable development everyone is a user and provider of information. It stresses the need to change from old sector-centered ways of doing business to new approaches that involve cross-sectoral co-ordination and the integration of environmental and social concerns into all development processes. Furthermore, Agenda 21 emphasises that broad public participation in decision making is a fundamental prerequisite for achieving sustainable development.&lt;ref&gt;Will Allen. 2007.[http://learningforsustainability.net/susdev/ "Learning for Sustainability: Sustainable Development."]&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the principles of the [[United Nations Charter]] the [[United Nations Millennium Declaration|Millennium Declaration]] identified principles and treaties on sustainable development, including [[economic development]], [[Social change|social development]] and [[environmental protection]]. Broadly defined, sustainable development is a systems approach to growth and development and to manage natural, produced, and [[social capital]] for the welfare of their own and future generations. The term sustainable development as used by the United Nations incorporates both issues associated with [[land development]] and broader issues of [[Human development (humanity)|human development]] such as education, public health, and standard of living.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

A 2013 study concluded that sustainability reporting should be reframed through the lens of four interconnected domains: ecology, economics, politics and culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|year=2013|title=Reframing social sustainability reporting: Towards an engaged approach|url=https://www.academia.edu/4362669/Reframing_Social_Sustainability_Reporting_Towards_an_Engaged_Approach|journal=Environment, Development and Sustainability|publisher=University of Melbourne|doi=10.1007/s10668-012-9384-2|author1=Liam Magee |author2=Andy Scerri |author3=Paul James |author4=James A.

==Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)==
In September 2015, the United Nations General Assembly formally adopted the "universal, integrated and transformative" [https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdgs 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development], a set of 17 [[Sustainable Development Goals]] (SDGs). The goals are to be implemented and achieved in every country from the year 2016 to 2030.

Sustainable development, or sustainability, has been described in terms of three spheres, dimensions, domains or pillars, i.e. the environment, the economy and society. The three-sphere framework was initially proposed by the economist René Passet in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4RFOAQAAIAAJ|title=L'Économique et le vivant|last=Passet|first=René|date=1979-01-01|publisher=Payot|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been worded as "economic, environmental and social" or "ecology, economy and equity".&lt;ref name="Global Sustainability Report"&gt;{{cite book|last=United Nations|title=Prototype Global Sustainable Development Report|publisher=United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Division for Sustainable Development|location=New York|date=2014|edition=Online unedited|url=http://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/globalsdreport/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been expanded by some authors to include a fourth pillar of culture, institutions or governance,&lt;ref name="Global Sustainability Report"/&gt; or alternatively reconfigured as four domains of the social - ecology, economics, politics and culture,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1= James | first1= Paul | authorlink= Paul James (academic) | last2= with Magee | first2= Liam | last3= Scerri | first3= Andy | last4= Steger | first4= Manfred B. | title= Urban Sustainability in Theory and Practice: Circles of Sustainability | url= https://www.academia.edu/9294719/Urban_Sustainability_in_Theory_and_Practice_Circles_of_Sustainability_2015_ | year= 2015 | publisher= Routledge | location= London}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus bringing economics back inside the social, and treating ecology as the intersection of the social and the natural.&lt;ref&gt;[http://citiesprogramme.com/archives/resource/circles-of-sustainability-urban-profile-process Circles of Sustainability Urban Profile Process] and {{Cite journal | year=2010 | first1= Andy |last1= Scerri | first2= Paul |  last2= James | authorlink2= Paul James (academic) | title= Accounting for sustainability: Combining qualitative and quantitative research in developing ‘indicators’ of sustainability | url= https://www.academia.edu/3230887/Accounting_for_Sustainability_Combining_Qualitative_and_Quantitative_Research_in_Developing_Indicators | journal= International Journal of Social Research Methodology | volume= 13 | issue= 1 | pages= 41–53 | doi=10.1080/13645570902864145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Environmental sustainability concerns the [[natural environment]] and how it endures and remains diverse and productive. Since [[natural resources]] are derived from the environment, the state of air, water, and the climate are of particular concern. The [[IPCC Fifth Assessment Report]] outlines current knowledge about scientific, technical and socio-economic information concerning [[climate change]], and lists options for [[Adaptation to global warming|adaptation]] and [[Climate change mitigation|mitigation]].&lt;ref name="Climate Change 2014: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Environmental sustainability requires society to design activities to meet human needs while preserving the life support systems of the planet. This, for example, entails using water sustainably, utilizing renewable energy, and sustainable material supplies (e.g. harvesting wood from forests at a rate that maintains the biomass and biodiversity).{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

An unsustainable situation occurs when [[natural capital]] (the sum total of nature's resources) is used up faster than it can be replenished. Sustainability requires that human activity only uses nature's resources at a rate at which they can be replenished naturally. Inherently the concept of sustainable development is intertwined with the concept of carrying capacity. Theoretically, the long-term result of [[environmental degradation]] is the inability to sustain human life.  Such degradation on a global scale should imply an increase in human death rate until population falls to what the degraded environment can support.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}  If the degradation continues beyond a certain [[Planetary boundaries|tipping point]] or critical threshold it would lead to eventual [[extinction]] for humanity.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

Integral elements for a sustainable development are research and innovation activities. A telling example is the [[European environmental research and innovation policy]], which aims at defining and implementing a transformative agenda to greening the economy and the society as a whole so to achieve a truly sustainable development. Research and innovation in Europe is financially supported by the programme [[Horizon 2020]], which is also open to participation worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;See Horizon 2020 – the EU's new research and innovation programme http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-13-1085_en.htm&lt;/ref&gt; A promising direction towards sustainable development is to design systems that are flexible and reversible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09613218.2012.702565|date=2012 | doi=10.1080/09613218.2012.702565 | volume=40 |title=Flexible strategies for long-term sustainability under uncertainty |journal=Building Research |pages=545–557 | last1 = Fawcett | first1 = William | last2 = Hughes | first2 = Martin | last3 = Krieg | first3 = Hannes | last4 = Albrecht | first4 = Stefan | last5 = Vennström | first5 = Anders}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Vladan_Babovic/publication/269694158_HYDRO-D-09-00078/links/54925b6a0cf2484a3f3e0c41.pdf |last=Zhang|first=S.X.|author2=V.

Pollution of the public resources is really not a different action, it just is a reverse tragedy of the commons, in that instead of taking something out, something is put into the commons.  When the costs of polluting the commons are not calculated into the cost of the items consumed, then it becomes only natural to pollute, as the cost of pollution is external to the cost of the goods produced and the cost of cleaning the waste before it is discharged exceeds the cost of releasing the waste directly into the commons.  So, the only way to solve this problem is by protecting the ecology of the commons by making it, through taxes or fines, more costly to release the waste directly into the commons than would be the cost of cleaning the waste before discharge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Economics, Ecology, Ethics: Essays toward a Steady-State Economy|last=Daly|first=H. E.|publisher=W. H. Freeman and Company|others=Hardin, G. "The tragedy of the commons"|year=|isbn=|location=New York and San Francisco|pages=100–114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

So, one can try to appeal to the ethics of the situation by doing the right thing as an individual, but in the absence of any direct consequences, the individual will tend to do what is best for the person and not what is best for the common good of the public.  Once again, this issue needs to be addressed.  Because, left unaddressed, the development of the commonly owned property will become impossible to achieve in a sustainable way.  So, this topic is central to the understanding of creating a sustainable situation from the management of the public resources that are used for personal use.

====Agriculture====
{{See also|Sustainable agriculture}}
Sustainable agriculture consists of [[environment friendly]] methods of farming that allow the production of crops or livestock without damage to human or natural systems. It involves preventing adverse effects to soil, water, biodiversity, surrounding or downstream resources—as well as to those working or living on the farm or in neighboring areas. The concept of sustainable agriculture extends intergenerationally, passing on a conserved or improved natural resource, biotic, and economic base rather than one which has been depleted or polluted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Networld-Project |url=http://www.green-networld.com/facts/glossary.htm |title=Environmental Glossary |publisher=Green-networld.com |date=1998-02-09 |accessdate=2011-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elements of sustainable agriculture include [[permaculture]], [[agroforestry]], [[mixed farming]], [[multiple cropping]], and [[crop rotation]].&lt;ref&gt;Ben Falk, ''The resilient farm and homestead: An innovative permaculture and whole systems design approach''. Chelsea Green, 2013. pp. 61-78.&lt;/ref&gt; It involves agricultural methods that do not undermine the environment, smart farming technologies that enhance a quality environment for humans to thrive and reclaiming and transforming deserts into farmlands(Herman Daly, 2017). {{Citation needed|reason=reclaiming and transforming deserts is sustainable|date=December 2017}}

According to ecological economist [[:de:Malte Michael Faber|Malte Faber]], ecological economics is defined by its focus on nature, justice, and time. Issues of [[intergenerational equity]], [[irreversibility]] of environmental change, [[uncertainty]] of long-term outcomes, and sustainable development guide ecological economic analysis and valuation.&lt;ref name=Faber2008&gt;Malte Faber. (2008). How to be an ecological economist. ''Ecological Economics'' '''66'''(1):1-7. [https://ideas.repec.org/p/awi/wpaper/0454.html Preprint].&lt;/ref&gt;

As early as the 1970s, the concept of sustainability was used to describe an [[economy]] "in equilibrium with basic ecological support systems".&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert L. Stivers|Stivers, R.]] 1976. The Sustainable Society: Ethics and Economic Growth. Philadelphia: [[Westminster John Knox Press|Westminster Press]].&lt;/ref&gt; Scientists in many fields have highlighted ''[[The Limits to Growth]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Meadows, D.H., D.L. Meadows, J.

In 1987 the economist Edward Barbier published the study ''The Concept of Sustainable Economic Development'', where he recognised that goals of environmental conservation and economic development are not conflicting and can be reinforcing each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Barbier |first=E. |year=1987 |title=The Concept of Sustainable Economic Development |journal=Environmental Conservation |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=101–110 |doi=10.1017/S0376892900011449 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[World Bank]] study from 1999 concluded that based on the theory of genuine savings, policymakers have many possible interventions to increase sustainability, in [[macroeconomics]] or purely environmental.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hamilton |first=K. |first2=M. |last2=Clemens |year=1999 |title=Genuine savings rates in developing countries |journal=World Bank Economy Review |volume=13 |issue=2 |pages=333–356 |doi=10.1093/wber/13.2.333 | url=http://wber.oxfordjournals.org/content/13/2/333.abstract }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several studies have noted that efficient policies for renewable energy and pollution are compatible with increasing human welfare, eventually reaching a golden-rule steady state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |year=2001 |first=A.

The study, ''Interpreting Sustainability in Economic Terms'', found three pillars of sustainable development, interlinkage, [[intergenerational equity]], and [[dynamic efficiency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Stavins |first=R. |first2=A. |last2=Wagner |first3=G. |last3=Wagner |title=Interpreting Sustainability in Economic Terms: Dynamic Efficiency Plus Intergenerational Equity |journal=[[Economic Letters]] |volume=79 |issue=3 |pages=339–343 |doi=10.1016/S0165-1765(03)00036-3 |year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

But [[Gilbert Rist]] points out that the World Bank has twisted the notion of sustainable development to prove that economic development need not be deterred in the interest of preserving the ecosystem. He writes: "From this angle, 'sustainable development' looks like a cover-up operation. ... The thing that is meant to be sustained is really 'development', not the tolerance capacity of the ecosystem or of human societies."&lt;ref&gt;''The History of Development'', 3rd Ed. (New York: Zed, 2008) 194.&lt;/ref&gt;

The World Bank, a leading producer of environmental knowledge, continues to advocate the win-win prospects for economic growth and ecological stability even as its economists express their doubts.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel P. Castillo, "Integral Ecology as a Liberationist Concept" in ''Theological Studies'', Vol 77, 2, June 2016, 374.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Herman Daly]], an economist for the Bank from 1988 to 1994, writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;When authors of ''WDR'' '92 [the highly influential 1992 ''World Development Report'' that featured the environment] were drafting the report, they called me asking for examples of "win-win" strategies in my work. What could I say? None exists in that pure form; there are trade-offs, not "win-wins." But they want to see a world of "win-wins" based on articles of faith, not fact. I wanted to contribute because ''WDR''s are important in the Bank, [because] task managers read [them] to find philosophical justification for their latest round of projects. But they did not want to hear about how things really are, or what I find in my work..."&lt;ref&gt;Michael Goldman, ''Imperial Nature: the World Bank and the Struggle for Justice in the Age of Globalization.'' (New Haven: Yale University, 2005), 128, quoted in ''[[Theological Studies (journal)|Theological Studies]]'', supra.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==== Environmental economics ====
{{main|Environmental economics}}
The total environment includes not just the biosphere of earth, air, and water, but also human interactions with these things, with nature, and what humans have created as their surroundings.&lt;ref&gt;Environmental Economics, 3rd Edition. J.J. Seneca/M.K. Taussig. 1984. Page 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

As countries around the world continue to advance economically, they put a strain on the ability of the natural environment to absorb the high level of pollutants that are created as a part of this economic growth. Therefore, solutions need to be found so that the economies of the world can continue to grow, but not at the expense of the public good.  In the world of economics the amount of environmental quality must be considered as limited in supply and therefore is treated as a scarce resource. This is a resource to be protected. One common way to analyze possible outcomes of policy decisions on the scarce resource is to do a cost-benefit analysis. This type of analysis contrasts different options of resource allocation and, based on an evaluation of the expected courses of action and the consequences of these actions, the optimal way to do so in the light of different policy goals can be elicited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barbier|first1=E.B.|last2=Markandya|first2=A.|last3=Pearce|first3=D.W.|title=Environmental sustainability and cost-benefit analysis|journal=Environment and Planning A|date=1990|volume=22|doi=10.1068/a221259|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.335.1749&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf|accessdate=11 November 2016|pages=1259–1266}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Benefit-cost analysis basically can look at several ways of solving a problem and then assigning the best route for a solution, based on the set of consequences that would result from the further development of the individual courses of action, and then choosing the course of action that results in the least amount of damage to the expected outcome for the environmental quality that remains after that development or process takes place. Further complicating this analysis are the interrelationships of the various parts of the environment that might be impacted by the chosen course of action.  Sometimes it is almost impossible to predict the various outcomes of a course of action, due to the unexpected consequences and the amount of unknowns that are not accounted for in the benefit-cost analysis.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

====Energy====

Sustainable energy is clean and can be used over a long period of time. Unlike fossil fuels and biofuels that provide the bulk of the worlds energy, [[renewable energy]] sources like hydroelectric, solar and wind energy produce far less pollution.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-climate-biofuels-idUSBRE90601A20130107&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fainstein, Susan S. 2000.

These communities are historically left out during the decision-making process, and often end up with dirty power plants and other dirty energy projects that poison the air and harm the area. These toxicants are major contributors to health problems in the communities. As renewable energy becomes more common, fossil fuel infrastructures are replaced by renewables, providing better social equity to these communities.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, Scott. 1996. "Green Cities, Growing Cities, Just Cities?: Urban planning and the Contradictions of Sustainable Development," Journal of the American Planning Association&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the core concepts in sustainable development is that technology can be used to assist people meet their developmental needs.

It also offers a practical opportunity to save people's time and household income as well as government budgets,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ledsgp.org/resource/leds-practice-save-time-money/?loclang=en_gb|title=LEDS in Practice: Save money and time|work=The Low Emission Development Strategies Global Partnership}}&lt;/ref&gt; making investment in sustainable transport a 'win-win' opportunity.

Some Western countries are making transportation more sustainable in both long-term and short-term implementations.&lt;ref&gt;Barbour, Elissa and Elizabeth A. Deakin. 2012. "Smart Growth Planning for Climate Protection"&lt;/ref&gt; An example is the modification in available transportation in [[Freiburg im Breisgau|Freiburg, Germany]]. The city has implemented extensive methods of public transportation, cycling, and walking, along with large areas where cars are not allowed.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Since many Western countries are highly automobile-oriented, the main transit that people use is personal vehicles. About 80% of their travel involves cars.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Therefore, California, is one of the highest [[greenhouse gases]] emitters in the United States. The federal government has to come up with some plans to reduce the total number of vehicle trips in order to lower greenhouse gases emission. Such as:

* Improve public transit through the provision of larger coverage area in order to provide more mobility and accessibility, new technology to provide a more reliable and responsive public transportation network.&lt;ref&gt;Murthy, A.S. Narasimha Mohle, Henry. [http://site.ebrary.com/lib/alltitles/docDetail.action?docID=10447877&amp;p00=transportation%20improvement Transportation Engineering Basics (2nd Edition)]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. (American Society of Civil Engineers 2001).&lt;/ref&gt;
* Encourage walking and biking through the provision of wider pedestrian pathway, bike share stations in downtowns, locate parking lots far from the shopping center, limit on street parking, slower traffic lane in downtown area.
* Increase the cost of car ownership and gas taxes through increased parking fees and tolls, encouraging people to drive more fuel efficient vehicles. This can produce a social equity problem, since lower income people usually drive older vehicles with lower fuel efficiency. Government can use the extra revenue collected from taxes and tolls to improve public transportation and benefit poor communities.&lt;ref&gt;Levine, Jonathan. 2013. "Urban Transportation and Social Equity: Transportation Planning Paradigms that Impede Policy Reform," in Naomi Carmon and Susan S. Fainstein, eds. Policy, Planning and people: promoting Justice in Urban Development (Penn)&lt;/ref&gt;

Other states and nations have built efforts to [[knowledge translation|translate knowledge]] in [[behavioral economics]] into [[evidence-based]] [[sustainable transportation]] policies.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

====Business====

{{See also|Corporate sustainability}}
The most broadly accepted criterion for corporate sustainability constitutes a firm's efficient use of natural capital.  This [[eco-efficiency]] is usually calculated as the economic value added by a firm in relation to its aggregated ecological impact.&lt;ref&gt;Schaltegger, S. &amp; Sturm, A. 1998. Eco-Efficiency by Eco-Controlling. Zürich: vdf.&lt;/ref&gt;  This idea has been popularised by the World Business Council for Sustainable Development ([[WBCSD]]) under the following definition: "Eco-efficiency is achieved by the delivery of competitively priced goods and services that satisfy human needs and bring quality of life, while progressively reducing ecological impacts and [[resource intensity]] throughout the life-cycle to a level at least in line with the earth's carrying capacity" (DeSimone and Popoff, 1997: 47).&lt;ref&gt;DeSimone, L. &amp; Popoff, F. 1997. Eco-efficiency: The business link to sustainable development. Cambridge: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar to the eco-efficiency concept but so far less explored is the second criterion for corporate sustainability. Socio-efficiency&lt;ref name="Dyllick, T. 2002"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dyllick | first1 = T. | last2 = Hockerts | first2 = K. | year = 2002 | title = Beyond the business case for corporate sustainability | url = | journal = Business Strategy and the Environment | volume = 11 | issue = 2| pages = 130–141 | doi=10.1002/bse.323}}&lt;/ref&gt; describes the relation between a firm's value added and its social impact. Whereas, it can be assumed that most corporate impacts on the environment are negative (apart from rare exceptions such as the planting of trees) this is not true for social impacts. These can be either positive (e.g. corporate giving, creation of employment) or negative (e.g. work accidents, mobbing of employees, human rights abuses). Depending on the type of impact socio-efficiency thus either tries to minimise negative social impacts (i.e. accidents per value added) or maximise positive social impacts (i.e. donations per value added) in relation to the value added.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

Both eco-efficiency and socio-efficiency are concerned primarily with increasing economic sustainability. In this process they instrumentalise both natural and social capital aiming to benefit from win-win situations. However, as Dyllick and Hockerts&lt;ref name="Dyllick, T. 2002"/&gt; point out the business case alone will not be sufficient to realise sustainable development. They point towards eco-effectiveness, socio-effectiveness, sufficiency, and eco-equity as four criteria that need to be met if sustainable development is to be reached.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

CASI Global, New York "CSR &amp; Sustainability together lead to sustainable development. CSR as in corporate social responsibility is not what you do with your profits, but is the way you make profits. This means CSR is a part of every department of the company value chain and not a part of HR / independent department. Sustainability as in effects towards Human resources, Environment and Ecology has to be measured within each department of the company." http://casiglobal.us/

====Income====

At the present time, sustainable development can reduce [[poverty]]. Sustainable development reduces [[poverty]] through financial (among other things, a balanced budget), environmental (living conditions), and social (including equality of income) means.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wydawnictwoumk.pl/czasopisma/index.php/CJFA/article/view/CJFA.2014.001/3213 S. Adamiak, D. Walczak, Sustainable development and social solidarism in the context of social security, Copernican Journal of Finance &amp; Accounting, Vol 3, No 1, p. 12,17.]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Architecture====

{{See also|Sustainable architecture}}
In sustainable architecture the recent movements of [[New Urbanism]] and [[New Classical architecture]] promote a sustainable approach towards construction, that appreciates and develops [[smart growth]], [[Vernacular architecture|architectural tradition]] and [[Classical architecture|classical design]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnu.org/charter Charter of the New Urbanism]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Beauty, Humanism, Continuity between Past and Future|url=http://www.traditionalarchitecture.co.uk/aims.html|publisher=Traditional Architecture Group|accessdate=23 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This in contrast to [[Modern architecture|modernist]] and [[International Style (architecture)|International Style]] architecture, as well as opposing to solitary [[housing estate]]s and [[Urban sprawl|suburban sprawl]], with long commuting distances and large ecological footprints.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aia.org/SiteObjects/files/smartgrowth05.pdf Issue Brief: Smart-Growth: Building Livable Communities]. American Institute of Architects. Retrieved on 2014-03-23.&lt;/ref&gt; Both trends started in the 1980s. (It should be noted that sustainable architecture is predominantly relevant to the economics domain while architectural landscaping pertains more to the ecological domain.){{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

===Politics===
{{See also|Environmental politics|Environmental governance|Sustainability metrics and indices}}
A study concluded that social indicators and, therefore, sustainable development indicators, are scientific constructs whose principal objective is to inform public policy-making.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Paul-Marie Boulanger |url=http://sapiens.revues.org/index166.html |title=Sustainable development indicators: a scientific challenge, a democratic issue. '&amp;#39;S.A.P.I.EN.S.'&amp;#39; '&amp;#39;'1'&amp;#39;' (1) |publisher=Sapiens.revues.org |year=2008 |accessdate=2011-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Institute for Sustainable Development]] has similarly developed a political policy framework, linked to a sustainability index for establishing measurable entities and metrics. The framework consists of six core areas, international trade and investment, economic policy, climate change and energy, measurement and assessment, natural resource management, and the role of communication technologies in sustainable development.

The [[United Nations Global Compact]] Cities Programme has defined sustainable political development in a way that broadens the usual definition beyond states and governance. The political is defined as the domain of practices and meanings associated with basic issues of social power as they pertain to the organisation, authorisation, legitimation and regulation of a social life held in common. This definition is in accord with the view that political change is important for responding to economic, ecological and cultural challenges. It also means that the politics of economic change can be addressed. They have listed seven subdomains of the domain of politics:&lt;ref name="citiesprogramme.com"/&gt;

#Organization and governance
#Law and justice
#Communication and critique
#Representation and negotiation
#Security and accord
#Dialogue and reconciliation
#Ethics and accountability

This accords with the Brundtland Commission emphasis on development that is guided by human rights principles (see above).

===Culture===

[[File:Circles of Sustainability image (assessment - Melbourne 2011).jpg|250px|thumb|Framing of sustainable development progress according to the [[Circles of Sustainability]], used by the [[United Nations Global Compact|United Nations]].]]
Working with a different emphasis, some researchers and institutions have pointed out that a fourth dimension should be added to the dimensions of sustainable development, since the triple-bottom-line dimensions of economic, environmental and social do not seem to be enough to reflect the complexity of contemporary society. In this context, the [[Agenda 21 for culture]] and the [[United Cities and Local Governments]] (UCLG)  Executive Bureau lead the preparation of the policy statement "Culture: Fourth Pillar of Sustainable Development", passed on 17 November 2010, in the framework of the World Summit of Local and Regional Leaders&amp;nbsp;– 3rd World Congress of UCLG, held in Mexico City. This document inaugurates a new perspective and points to the relation between culture and sustainable development through a dual approach: developing a solid [[cultural policy]] and advocating a cultural dimension in all public policies. The [[Circles of Sustainability]] approach distinguishes the four domains of economic, ecological, political and cultural sustainability.&lt;ref name="agenda21culture.net"&gt;United Cities and Local Governments, [http://agenda21culture.net/index.php/16-official-documentation-all/agenda-21-culture-all/437-cultural-policies-and-sustainable-development "Culture: Fourth Pillar of Sustainable Development"].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uclg.org/en/node/21824&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.academia.edu/15885475/Assessing_Cultural_Sustainability_Agenda_21_for_Culture&lt;/ref&gt;

Other organizations have also supported the idea of a fourth domain of sustainable development. The Network of Excellence "Sustainable Development in a Diverse World",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.susdiv.org/ |title=Sus.Div |publisher=Sus.Div |accessdate=2011-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; sponsored by the [[European Union]], integrates multidisciplinary capacities and interprets [[cultural diversity]] as a key element of a new strategy for sustainable development. The Fourth Pillar of Sustainable Development Theory has been referenced by executive director of IMI Institute at [[UNESCO]] Vito Di Bari&lt;ref&gt;"Agreement between UNESCO and the City of Milan concerning the International Multimedia Institute (IMI) - Appointment of Executive Director&amp;nbsp;— UNESCO Archives ICA AtoM catalogue". Atom.archives.unesco.org. 1999-10-08. Retrieved 2014-01-17.&lt;/ref&gt; in his manifesto of art and architectural movement [[Neo-Futurism]], whose name was inspired by the 1987 [[United Nations]]’ report [[Our Common Future]]. The [[Circles of Sustainability]] approach used by Metropolis defines the (fourth) cultural domain as practices, discourses, and material expressions, which, over time, express continuities and discontinuities of social meaning.&lt;ref name="citiesprogramme.com"&gt;http://citiesprogramme.com/archives/resource/circles-of-sustainability-urban-profile-process {{Cite journal

===Progress===
{{See also|Sustainable development goals}}
The [[United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development]] (UNCSD; also known as Rio 2012) was the third international conference on sustainable development,  which aimed at reconciling the economic and environmental goals of the global community. An outcome of this conference was the development of the [[Sustainable Development Goals]] that aim to promote sustainable progress and eliminate inequalities around the world. However, few nations met the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]]'s definition of sustainable development criteria established in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Living Planet Report 2006 |url= http://assets.panda.org/downloads/living_planet_report.pdf |publisher= [[World Wide Fund for Nature]], [[Zoological Society of London]], [[Global Footprint Network]] |date= 24 October 2006 |page= 19 |accessdate= 18 August 2012 }}; [http://www.science.org.au/nova/newscientist/107ns_004.htm World failing on sustainable development] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140209164418/http://www.science.org.au/nova/newscientist/107ns_004.htm |date=9 February 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although some nations are more developed than others, all nations are constantly developing because each nation struggles with perpetuating disparities, inequalities and unequal access to fundamental rights and freedoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Creating Capabilities: The Human Development Approach|last = Nussbaum|first = Martha|publisher = The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press|year = 2011|isbn = 978-0-674-05054-9|location = Cambridge, Massachusetts and London, England|pages = 16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Measurement===

[[File:Amazonie deforestation.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Deforestation and increased road-building in the [[Amazon Rainforest]] are a concern because of increased human encroachment upon [[wilderness]] areas, increased resource extraction and further threats to [[biodiversity]].]]
In 2007 a report for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency stated: "While much discussion and effort has gone into sustainability indicators, none of the resulting systems clearly tells us whether our society is sustainable. At best, they can tell us that we are heading in the wrong direction, or that our current activities are not sustainable. More often, they simply draw our attention to the existence of problems, doing little to tell us the origin of those problems and nothing to tell us how to solve them."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/1841126/Environmental-Protection-Agency-hechtepaordpaper |title=Joy E. Hecht, Can Indicators and Accounts Really Measure Sustainability? Considerations for the U.S. Environmental Protection |access-date=15 September 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140410172521/http://www.scribd.com/doc/1841126/Environmental-Protection-Agency-hechtepaordpaper |archive-date=10 April 2014 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, a majority of authors assume that a set of well defined and harmonised indicators is the only way to make sustainability tangible. Those indicators are expected to be identified and adjusted through empirical observations (trial and error).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | year = 2006 | title = An adaptive learning process for developing and applying sustainability indicators with local communities | url = http://km.fao.org/uploads/media/An%20adaptative%20learning%20process%20for%20developing%20and%20applying%20sustainability%20indicators%20with%20local%20communities.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Ecological economics | volume = 59 | issue =  | pages = 406–418 | doi = 10.1016/j.ecolecon.2005.11.008 | last1 = Reed | first1 = Mark S. | access-date = 18 February 2011 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110726045818/http://km.fao.org/uploads/media/An%20adaptative%20learning%20process%20for%20developing%20and%20applying%20sustainability%20indicators%20with%20local%20communities.pdf | archive-date = 26 July 2011 | dead-url = yes | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common critiques are related to issues like data quality, comparability, objective function and the necessary resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nse-netz.de/downloads/nachh.pdf |title=Annette Lang, Ist Nachhaltigkeit messbar?, Uni Hannover, 2003 |format=PDF |accessdate=2011-09-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110802135133/http://www.nse-netz.de/downloads/nachh.pdf |archive-date=2 August 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; However a more general criticism is coming from the project management community: How can a sustainable development be achieved at global level if we cannot monitor it in any single project?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://youth-partnership-eu.coe.int/youth-partnership/documents/Publications/T_kits/3/tkit3.pdf |title=Project Management T-kit, Council of Europe and European Commission, Strasbourg, 2000 |format=PDF |accessdate=2011-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.grida.no/publications/et/ep4/page/2653.aspx |title=Do global targets matter?, The Environment Times, Poverty Times #4, UNEP/GRID-Arendal, 2010 |publisher=Grida.no |accessdate=2011-09-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629043039/http://www.grida.no/publications/et/ep4/page/2653.aspx |archive-date=29 June 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cuban-born researcher and entrepreneur Sonia Bueno suggests an alternative approach that is based upon the integral, long-term cost-benefit relationship as a measure and monitoring tool for the sustainability of every project, activity or enterprise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.empai-matanzas.co.cu/revista/REVISTA_archivos/Page969.htm |title=Sostenibilidad en la construcción.

Reasonable qualifications of sustainability are seen U.S. Green Building Council's (USGBC) Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED). This design incorporates some ecological, economic, and social elements. The goals presented by LEED design goals are sustainable sites, water efficiency, energy and atmospheric emission reduction, material and resources efficiency, and indoor environmental quality. Although amount of structures for sustainability development is many, these qualification has become a standard for sustainable building.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

Recent research efforts created also the [[SDEWES Centre#SDEWES Index|SDEWES Index]] to benchmark the performance of cities across aspects that are related to energy, water and environment systems. The [[SDEWES Centre|SDEWES]] Index consists of 7 dimensions, 35 indicators, and close to 20 sub-indicators. It is currently applied to 58 cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = SDEWES Centre - SDEWES Index|url = http://www.sdewes.org/sdewes_index.php|website = www.sdewes.org|accessdate = 2015-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Natural capital===
[[File:Hillside deforestation in Rio de Janeiro.jpg|300px|thumb|alt=Deforastation of native rain forest in Rio de Janeiro City for extraction of clay for civil construction|[[Deforestation]] of native [[rain forest]] in Rio de Janeiro City for extraction of [[clay]] for [[civil engineering]] (2009 picture).]]
The sustainable development debate is based on the assumption that societies need to manage three types of capital (economic, social, and natural), which may be non-substitutable and whose consumption might be irreversible.&lt;ref name="Dyllick, T. 2002"/&gt; Leading [[Ecological economics|ecological economist]] and [[Steady-state economy#Herman Daly's concept of a steady-state economy|steady-state theorist]] [[Herman Daly]],&lt;ref name=hd01/&gt; for example, points to the fact that [[natural capital]] can not necessarily be substituted by economic capital. While it is possible that we can find ways to replace some natural resources, it is much more unlikely that they will ever be able to replace eco-system services, such as the protection provided by the ozone layer, or the climate stabilizing function of the Amazonian forest. In fact natural capital, social capital and economic capital are often complementarities. A further obstacle to substitutability lies also in the multi-functionality of many natural resources. Forests, for example, not only provide the raw material for paper (which can be substituted quite easily), but they also maintain biodiversity, regulate water flow, and absorb CO2.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

Another problem of natural and social capital deterioration lies in their partial irreversibility. The [[Biodiversity loss|loss of biodiversity]], for example, is often definitive. The same can be true for cultural diversity. For example, with globalisation advancing quickly the number of indigenous languages is dropping at alarming rates.  Moreover, the depletion of natural and social capital may have non-linear consequences. Consumption of natural and social capital may have no observable impact until a certain threshold is reached. A lake can, for example, absorb nutrients for a long time while actually increasing its productivity. However, once a certain level of algae is reached lack of oxygen causes the lake's ecosystem to break down suddenly.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

===Business-as-usual===
[[File:Air pollution by industrial chimneys.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Before [[flue-gas desulfurization]] was installed, the [[air pollution|air-polluting]] emissions from this power plant in [[New Mexico]] contained excessive amounts of [[sulfur dioxide]].]]
If the degradation of natural and social capital has such important consequence the question arises why action is not taken more systematically to alleviate it. Cohen and Winn&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cohen | first1 = B. | last2 = Winn | first2 = M. I. | year = 2007 | title = Market imperfections, opportunity and sustainable entrepreneurship | url = | journal = Journal of Business Venturing | volume = 22 | issue = 1| pages = 29–49 | doi=10.1016/j.jbusvent.2004.12.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; point to four types of market failure as possible explanations: First, while the benefits of natural or social capital depletion can usually be privatised, the costs are often externalised (i.e. they are borne not by the party responsible but by society in general). Second, natural capital is often undervalued by society since we are not fully aware of the real cost of the depletion of natural capital. Information asymmetry is a third reason—often the link between cause and effect is obscured, making it difficult for actors to make informed choices. Cohen and Winn close with the realization that contrary to economic theory many firms are not perfect optimisers. They postulate that firms often do not optimise resource allocation because they are caught in a "business as usual" mentality.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

===Education===
''Main page: [[Education for sustainable development]]''

Education must be revisited in light of a renewed vision of sustainable human and social development that is both equitable and viable. This vision of sustainability must take into consideration the social, environmental and economic dimensions of human development and the various ways in which these relate to education: ‘An empowering education is one that builds the human resources we need to be productive, to continue to learn, to solve problems, to be creative, and to live together and with nature in peace and harmony. When nations ensure that such an education is accessible to all throughout their lives, a quiet revolution is set in motion: education becomes the engine of sustainable development and the key to a better world.’&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Power of Education: Education for All, Development, Globalisation and UNESCO|last=Power|first=C|publisher=London, Springer|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002325/232555e.pdf|title=Rethinking Education: Towards a global common good?|last=|first=|publisher=UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=978-92-3-100088-1|location=|pages=31–32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Higher education in sustainability across education streams including engineering, finance, supply chain and operations is gaining weight-age. Multiple institutes including Wharton, Columbia, CASI Global New York offer certifications in Sustainability.
Corporate's prefer employees certified in sustainability.

== Insubstantial stretching of the term ==
It has been argued that since the 1960s, the concept of sustainable development has changed from "conservation management" to "economic development", whereby the original meaning of the concept has been stretched somewhat.&lt;ref name=to01&gt;{{cite book |last=O'Riordan |first=Timothy |date=1993 |chapter=The Politics of Sustainability |editor-last=Turner |editor-first=R. Kerry |title=Sustainable Environmental Economics and Management: Principles and Practice. |location=London |publisher=Belhaven Press }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|48–54}}

In the 1960s, the international community realised that many African countries needed national plans to safeguard wildlife habitats, and that rural areas had to confront the limits imposed by soil, climate and water availability. This was a strategy of conservation management. In the 1970s, however, the focus shifted to the broader issues of the provisioning of basic human needs, community participation as well as appropriate technology use throughout the developing countries (and not just in Africa). This was a strategy of economic development, and the strategy was carried even further by the [[Brundtland Commission]]'s report on ''[[Our Common Future]]'' when the issues went from regional to international in scope and application.&lt;ref name=to01/&gt;{{rp|48–54}} In effect, the conservationists were crowded out and superseded by the developers.

But shifting the focus of sustainable development from conservation to development has had the imperceptible effect of stretching the original forest management term of [[sustainable yield]] from the use of renewable resources only (like forestry), to now also accounting for the use of non-renewable resources (like [[Natural resource#Classification|minerals]]).&lt;ref name=kt01&gt;{{cite book |last=Turner |first=R. Kerry |date=1988 |chapter=Sustainability, Resource Conservation and Pollution Control: An Overview |editor-last=Turner |editor-first=R. Kerry |title=Sustainable Environmental Management. |location=London |publisher=Belhaven Press }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|13}} This stretching of the term has been questioned. Thus, environmental economist Kerry Turner has argued that literally, there can be no such thing as overall "sustainable development" in an industrialised [[world economy]] that remains heavily dependent on the extraction of earth's finite stock of exhaustible mineral resources: "It makes no sense to talk about the sustainable use of a non-renewable resource (even with substantial [[recycling]] effort and use rates). Any positive rate of exploitation will eventually lead to exhaustion of the finite stock."&lt;ref name=kt01/&gt;{{rp|13}}

In effect, it has been argued that the industrial revolution as a whole is unsustainable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Georgescu-Roegen |first=Nicholas |authorlink=Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen |date=1971 |title=The Entropy Law and the Economic Process |url=https://www.scribd.com/document/267519123/The-Entropy-Law-and-the-Economic-Process-by-Nicholas-Georgescu-Roegen-pdf |format=Full book accessible at Scribd |location=Cambridge |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=0674257804 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|20f}}&lt;ref name=hd01/&gt;{{rp|22f}}&lt;ref name=jr01&gt;{{cite book |last=Rifkin |first=Jeremy |authorlink=Jeremy Rifkin |date=1980 |title=Entropy: A New World View. |url=http://www.foet.org/FOET-data/uploads/2017/03/Jeremy-Rifkin-Entropy-table-of-contents.pdf |format=PDF contains only the title and contents pages of the book |location=New York |publisher=The Viking Press |isbn=0670297178 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|61–67}}&lt;ref name="Monbiot-20171124"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Monbiot|first1=George|title=Everything Must Go|url=http://www.monbiot.com/2017/11/24/everything-must-go/|website=George Monbiot|accessdate=26 November 2017|date=2017-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One critic has argued that the [[Brundtland Commission]] promoted nothing but a business as usual strategy for world development, with the ambiguous and insubstantial concept of "sustainable development" attached as a public relations slogan:&lt;ref name=ap01&gt;{{cite book |last=Perez-Carmona |first=Alexander |date=2013 |chapter=Growth: A Discussion of the Margins of Economic and Ecological Thought |chapter-url=http://www.slideshare.net/lucieevers1/growth-in-margin-of-ecological-thought-by-perez |editor-last=Meuleman |editor-first=Louis |title=Transgovernance.

After World War II, the notion of "development" had been established in the West to imply the projection of the American model of society onto the rest of the world. In the 1970s and 1980s, this notion was broadened somewhat to also imply human rights, basic human needs and finally, ecological issues. The emphasis of the report was on helping poor nations out of poverty and meeting the basic needs of their growing populations—as usual. This issue demanded more economic growth, also in the rich countries, who would then import more goods from the poor countries to help them out—as usual. When the discussion switched to [[Steady-state economy#Present background: Exceeding global limits to growth|global ecological limits to growth]], the obvious dilemma was left aside by calling for economic growth with improved resource efficiency, or what was termed "a change in the ''quality'' of growth". However, most countries in the West had experienced such improved resource efficiency since the early-20th century already and as usual; only, this improvement had been more than offset by continuing industrial expansion, to the effect that world resource consumption was now higher than ever before—and these two historical trends were completely ignored in the report. Taken together, the policy of perpetual economic growth for the entire planet remained virtually intact. Since the publication of the report, the ambiguous and insubstantial slogan of "sustainable development" has marched on worldwide.&lt;ref name=ap01/&gt;{{rp|94–99}}

'''Systematic political science''', as developed by [[Dallas F. Bell Jr.]], basically is the use of [[game theory]] methods to mathematically unify the anthropocentric academic disciplines of [[theology]], [[epistemology]], [[psychology]], [[sociology]] and [[eschatology]] for computerized [[analysis]] and predictions after [[verification and validation]] methods are employed, such as [[red team]] procedures.  The discipline of systematic political science has two natural divisions of emphasis--pure and applied.  Pure (systematic) political science focuses on the parameters of individual, institutional, and societal behavior(s).  The behavioral parameters create probable decision-tree algorithms from a norm within the min max vector space sum, ∑.  Applied (systematic) political science applies the corresponding behavioral algorithms from pure political science to the subject(s) of analysis.

A '''trick tank''' is a watering device for [[livestock]] or [[wildlife]].  It collects [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]], holds the water in a covered tank to minimize [[evaporation]] and maintain adequate [[water quality]], and dispenses water on demand into a basin from which animals can drink.  Dispensing may be regulated by a mechanical float device similar to a [[ballcock]] in the tank of a [[flush toilet]].

Trick tanks are manufactured in several styles, including inverted umbrella and apron.  They are heavy and often are used in remote wilderness locations, to which they may require delivery via helicopter.

To provide water to wild animals, not livestock, fencing may be built to surround a trick tank.  Fences serve to exclude [[cattle]] and [[sheep]].  Trick tanks are widely used in the [[southwest United States]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Classification==
[[File:R-Sct-Lightcurve-AAVSO.gif|thumb|left|R-Sct-Lightcurve-AAVSO]]
Historically Type II Cepheids were called [[W Virginis variable]]s, but are now divided into three subclasses based on the length of their period.  Stars with periods between 1 and 4 days are of the [[BL Herculis variable|BL Herculis subclass]] and 10–20 days belong to the [[W Virginis variable|W Virginis subclass]].  Stars with periods greater than 20 days, and usually alternating deep and shallow minima, belong to the [[RV Tauri variable|RV Tauri subclass]].  RV Tauri variables are usually classified by a formal period from deep minimum to deep minimum, hence 40 days or more.&lt;ref name=wallerstein02/&gt;&lt;ref name=so08/&gt;

The divisions between the types are not always clearcut or agreed.  For example, the dividing line between BL Her and W Vir types is quoted at anything between 4 and 10 days, with no obvious division between the two.  RV Tau variables may not have obvious alternating minima, while some W Vir stars do.  Nevertheless, each type is thought to represent a distinct different evolutionary stage, with BL Her stars being helium core burning objects moving from the [[horizontal branch]] towards the [[asymptotic giant branch]] (AGB), W Vir stars undergoing hydrogen or helium shell burning on a blue loop, and RV Tau stars being post-AGB objects at or near the end of nuclear fusion.

RV Tau stars in particular show irregularities in their light curves, with slow variations in the brightness of both maxima and minima, variations in the period, intervals with little variation, and sometimes a temporary breakdown into chaotic behaviour.  [[R Scuti]] has one of the most irregular light curves.

==Properties==
The physical properties of all the type II Cepheid variables are very poorly known.  For example, it is expected that they have masses near or below that of the sun, but there are few examples of reliable known masses.&lt;ref name=harris&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Binary Type II Cepheids IX CAS and TX Del |author=Harris, Hugh C. |author2=Welch, Douglas L. |journal=Astronomical Journal |volume=98 |pages=981 |date=September 1989 |bibcode=1989AJ.....98..981H |doi=10.1086/115190 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Period-Luminosity relationship==
Type II Cepheids are fainter than their [[classical Cepheid]] counterparts for a given period by about 1.6 magnitudes.&lt;ref name=cwtop&gt;{{cite web|title=Cepheid Variables|url=http://www.caglow.com/info/wtopic/cepheid|work=Weekly Topic|publisher=Caglow|accessdate=30 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cepheid variables are used to establish the distance to the [[Galactic center]], [[globular clusters]], and [[galaxies]].&lt;ref name=majaess09&gt;{{cite journal |bibcode=2009AcA....59..403M |title=Type II Cepheids as Extragalactic Distance Candles |author1=Majaess, D. |author2=Turner, D. |author3=Lane, D. |volume=59 |date=2009 |pages=403 |journal=Acta Astronomica|arxiv = 0909.0181 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ku02&gt;{{cite journal |bibcode=2003AcA....53..117K |title=The Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment.

==Examples==
Type II Cepheids are not as well known as their type I counterparts, with only a couple of naked eye examples.  In this list, the period quoted for RV Tauri variables is the interval between successive deep minima, hence twice the comparable period for the other sub-types.
