'''123rf''' (part of Inmagine Group) is a stock content agency founded in 2005 which sells royalty-free images. In the past few years, 123RF expanded the portfolio to serve the growing market of the web-based content industry. In addition to over 90 million images in its library, the company also has a large collection of vector graphics, icons, fonts, video and audio files. The marketing is mainly carried out by about 350 employees from 40 offices around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vcnewsnetwork.com/malaysian-stock-photo-startup-123rf-acquires-thehungryjpeg-with-plans-to-go-ipo/ |title= Malaysian stock photo startup 123RF acquires TheHungryJPEG with plans to go IPO |publisher= VC News Network}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In 2000, the founder, Andy Sitt, had just quit his job at a British company that sold stock images in CDs while showing customers printed catalogues. Andy launched his e-commerce business by setting up Inmagine, which sold premium large-format photo prints. Together with Stephanie Sitt as a cofounder and current CEO&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://vulcanpost.com/623351/123rf-stephanie-sitt-inmagine-group-startup/|title=5 Of The Most Common Startup Pain Points—Solved By This M'sian Startup Worth US$220 Mil|last=Tan|first=Tee May|date=2017-10-11|work=Vulcan Post|access-date=2017-11-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Inmagine Group is one of the few technology companies to have bootstrapped globally from Asia.

Inmagine also produced proprietary content which required in-house photographers, graphic designers, make up artists and a sales team to cater to demand. In 2005, Inmagine set up 123RF, which offers royalty-free stock images, videos, as well as audio clips, from just US$1 to US$3 apiece. Unlike the previous business model, 123RF allows photographers around the world to sell their work on the platform on a royalty-free model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.techinasia.com/malaysian-husband-wife-bootstrapped-worlds-top-stock-image-players|title=How Malaysian husband and wife bootstrapped one of the world’s top stock image players|publisher= Tech in Asia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, Inmagine Group has expanded by building new businesses such as Stockunlimited.com, Designs.net and has also acquired TheHungryJPEG.com, Craftbundles.com, Pixlr.com, Vectr.com and Storyandheart.com.

== Acquisitions ==
In March 2017, 123rf acquired TheHungryJPEG, a UK-registered font and graphics marketplace and its sister company Craftbundles for an undisclosed sum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://e27.co/malaysian-stock-photo-startup-123rf-acquires-thehungry-jpeg-grow-design-resources-globally-20170309/ |title=Malaysian stock photo startup 123RF acquires TheHungry.JPEG to grow design resources globally |publisher= e27 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dealstreetasia.com/stories/malaysia-inmagine-acquires-online-design-marketplace-thehungryjpeg-67053/|title=123RF acquires design marketplace TheHungryJPEG|website=www.dealstreetasia.com|access-date=2017-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2017, 123rf acquired [[Pixlr]], an online web-based image editor from [[Autodesk]] for an undisclosed sum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://e27.co/123rf-acquires-pixlr-looking-secure-50m-monthly-active-users-20170425/ | title= 123RF acquires Pixlr, looking towards securing 50M monthly active users |publisher= e27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2017, 123RF acquired Vectr, a web-based vector editor and Story &amp; Heart, a video education platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dealstreetasia.com/stories/malaysia-inmagine-buys-us-companies-86336/|title=Malaysia: Digital stock media firm Inmagine Group buys two US companies|website=www.dealstreetasia.com|access-date=2017-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bobohizans.jpeg|thumb|upright=1.5|Bobohizans of Putatan]]{{Anthropology of religion}}

A '''''Bobohizan''''' (Tangaa' Kadazan term) or '''''Bobolian''''' (Bundu Liwan Dusun term) is a high priestess, a ritual specialist and a [[Mediumship|spirit medium]] in [[Kadazan-Dusun]] pagan rites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Keat Gin|first1=Ooi|title=Historical Dictionary of Malaysia|date=2009|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=0810863057|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; The office of ''Bobohizan'' or ''Bobolian'', is also the chief preserver of [[Momolianism]], i.e. the philosophy and way of life of the Kadazan-Dusun people.

One of the primary roles of a ''Bobohizan'' is to appease the rice spirit Bambaazon during harvest festival or [[Kaamatan]]. During the event, she will lead a procession of people from her village through the [[paddy field]] under the full moon, to give thanks and to seek a bountiful harvest for the rice-cultivating Kadazan-Dusun people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thestar.com.my/story/?file=%2F2009%2F6%2F6%2Flifefocus%2F3600100&amp;sec=lifefocus|title=The Last of the Shamans, The star, 6 June 2009|publisher=Thestar.com|accessdate=24 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A ''Bobohizan'' also plays a role as a mediator between the spirits and the people. One of the commonest duties of a ''Bobohizan'' is to heal and cure illnesses with herbal remedies and rites.

==Origin==
''Bobohizan'' is said to stem from the first ancestors of the [[Kadazan-Dusun]] people, ''Kinoingan'' and his wife ''Suminundu''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Luping|first1=Herman|title=Looking at the Origins of the Bobohizan|url=http://www.dailyexpress.com.my/read.cfm?NewsID=1198|work=Daily Express Sabah|date=8 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not certain whether the calling of ''Bobohizan'' (''Bobolian'' in the Bundu-Liwan dialect) exist prior to or after the settling of the ancestors at [[Nunuk Ragang]]. Long after the first ancestors passing to ''Hibabou'' (Heaven), the rites, prayers, and incantations (''Rinait'' or ''Inaait'') were lost and forgotten. This is when Suminundu sent a spirit to earth to teach the people about the ''rinait''. The spirit came every evening, calling upon anyone brave enough to learn. The call was repeated for years but no one was brave enough to come forth until one day a brave woman went out and meet the spirit in the dark. She soon learned the art of ''rinait'' and rites from the spirit and passed it on to other women in the village. According to legend, because of the woman who was brave enough to meet the spirit, all ''Bobohizan'' in [[Penampang]] was by custom, women only.

== Roles ==
A ''Bobohizan'' plays a pivotal role in a daily life of the Kadazan people before the advent of [[Christianity]]. This ranges from appeasing the rice spirit during '[[Kaamatan]] and Magavau festivals, appeasing the skull spirits during the Magang celebration,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Phelan|first1=Peter|title=Head-hunting and Magang ceremony in Sabah|date=2001|publisher=Natural History Publication (Borneo)|isbn=9838120456}}&lt;/ref&gt; appeasing and offering sacrifices to the spirits of the sacred jars (''gusi'') and to exorcise evil spirits. ''Bobohizans'' are also involved in [[Spell (paranormal)|charms]], reading [[omens]] and to a lesser extent [[augury]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rutter|first1=Owen|title=The Pagans of North Borneo|date=1929|publisher=Hutchinson &amp; Co (Publishers) Ltd, London|pages=227–245|edition=First}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2209">A '''citizenship judge''' is an [[official]] in [[Canada]] who assesses referred applications to ensure they meet the physical presence requirements for [[Canadian nationality law|Canadian citizenship]] and presides over citizenship ceremonies to administer the [[Oath of Citizenship (Canada)|Oath of Citizenship]] for successful applicants.  Citizenship judges also speak to community groups, schools, and other audiences about the process to become a citizen, as well as Canadian values and the rights and responsibilities of Canadian citizenship. As independent decision makers, citizenship judges comprise the [[Citizenship Commission]] a body that is arms length from the [[Department of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship]].

Citizenship judges are appointed in accordance with the Citizenship Act by the [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]]-[[Queen-in-Council|in-Council]] on the recommendation of [[Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship]]. Citizenship judges are addressed as ''Judge [name]'' rather than ''[[Your Honour]]''.

Citizenship Judges are independent decision makers, and unlike [[Justice of the peace]], Citizenship judges are not judicial officers.

''''' De Mantel der Liefde ''''' is a 1978 Dutch [[satire|satirical]] [[anthology film]], directed by [[Adriaan Ditvoorst]]. It is a [[black comedy]] based on the [[Ten Commandments]] and mankind's failure to live up to them. &lt;ref name="vpro.nl"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vpro.nl/cinema/films/film~401914~de-mantel-der-liefde~.html|title=De Mantel der Liefde - vpro cinema|website=www.vpro.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.be/books?id=4H0UDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT324&amp;lpg=PT324&amp;dq=de+mantel+der+liefde+film+ditvoorst&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=6LV3-sW5dr&amp;sig=LcoeF913PnQpKP-uW1ME3VLanNQ&amp;hl=nl&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj48P_E27fTAhXOZ1AKHQVXDYo4ChDoAQhAMAY#v=onepage&amp;q=de+mantel+der+liefde&amp;f=false|title=Humour and irony in Dutch post-war fiction film|first=Peter|last=Verstraten|date=29 April 2016|publisher=Amsterdam University Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==

The film starts off with [[Jesus Christ]] and [[Moses]], who are sent from [[Ancient history|Antiquity]] to the present to see if mankind followed up the [[Ten Commandments]]? The film is divided in ten self-contained sketches, named after one of the Commandments each. &lt;ref name="vpro.nl"/&gt; Every sketch shows people sinning against the Commandments. Near the end the director and his producer (Hans Boskamp) watch their own film reach its conclusion. The producer feels the movie "sucks" and is "too vulgar", whereupon the director defends it by saying it's actually "art". The producer then replies that "art doesn't sell" and "stupid entertainment is what the public wants."

The '''Declaration of Independence of the Republic of Crimea''' was a joint resolution adopted on March 11, 2014 by the Russian-proclaimed [[Supreme Council of Crimea]] and the [[Sevastopol]] City Council where they expressed their intention to join Russia, in the event of a ''Yes'' vote in a [[Crimean status referendum, 2014|referendum]] that was to be held on March 16.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|title=Crimea parliament declares independence from Ukraine ahead of referendum|url=http://rt.com/news/crimea-parliament-independence-ukraine-086/|publisher=[[RT (TV network)|RT]]|accessdate=March 11, 2014|date=March 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The participants were at the time subnational divisions of [[Ukraine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|script-title=ru:ДЕКЛАРАЦИЯ о независимости Автономной Республики Крым и города Севастополя |url=http://www.rada.crimea.ua/app/2988 |publisher=[[Supreme Council of Crimea]] |accessdate=March 11, 2014 |language=Russian |date=March 11, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140312060543/http://www.rada.crimea.ua/app/2988 |archivedate=March 12, 2014 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversies ==
The international community widely condemned the Declaration of Independence. A major source of criticism was that the referendum's adoption came after the building of the Supreme Council of Crimea was seized by the Russian military prior to adoption. During that time, no journalists were allowed inside the building to witness the council seating on the referendum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.kmu.gov.ua/en/news/247105448|title=Коментар МЗС України щодо проведення місцевого референдуму в Автономній Республіці Крим 16 березня ц.р.|last=|first=|date=15 March 2014|website=Ukrainian Ministry of Foreign Affairs|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Council seating on the referendum was not included the in Supreme Council's original schedule, which had no meetings originally scheduled for March 11, 2014.

Further evidence of undemocratic tampering in the referendum was that the Sevastopol local election results recorded an impossible 123% support in favour of independence from Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://espreso.tv/article/2015/03/16/rokovyny_putinskoho_anshlyusu_krymu_yak_ce_bulo|title=Роковини путінського аншлюсу Криму: Як це було|website=espreso.tv|access-date=2018-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Derby Museum and Art Gallery''' was established in 1879, along with [[Derby Central Library]], in a new building designed by [[Richard Knill Freeman]] and given to [[Derby, England|Derby]] by [[Michael Thomas Bass]]. The collection includes a gallery displaying many paintings by [[Joseph Wright of Derby]]; there is also a large display of [[Royal Crown Derby]] and other porcelain from Derby and the surrounding area. Further displays include archaeology, natural history, geology, military collections and world cultures. The Art Gallery was opened in 1882.

==History==
[[File:derbymuseumlib.jpg|upright|thumb|The 1876 building mostly housed [[Derby Central Library]] today but the dividing line with newer building varies]]
The museum can trace its start to the formation of the Derby Town and County Museum and Natural History Society on 10 February 1836.&lt;ref name="geo"/&gt; The society was housed by Full Street Public Baths but it was a private society funded by its members' subscriptions. Its collections were created by donations initially from Dr Forrester who had been a President of [[Derby Philosophical Society]]. The patron of the Museum Society was [[William Cavendish, 6th Duke of Devonshire]], and the President was [[Sir George Harpur Crewe, 8th Baronet|Sir George Crewe]] who was a keen naturalist.&lt;ref name="geo"/&gt; Col. [[George Gawler]] contributed a collection of minerals and exotic stuffed birds which included an albatross from his time as governor in South Australia.&lt;ref name=glover&gt;{{cite book|last=Glover|first=Stephen|title=The history and directory of the borough of Derby, a guide p.430|year=1829|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qu0GAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA58#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1839 a major exhibition was held at the Mechanics' Institute which contained many items including those from [[Joseph Strutt (philanthropist)|Joseph Strutt]]'s collection. Many of these made their way into Derby Museum's collection.&lt;ref name="goodeys"/&gt; The society moved in 1840 to the Athenaeum in Victoria Street. The society's collections grew in 1856 and they were first offered for incorporation into the town by [[William Mundy (Markeaton)|William Mundy]], but the offer was rejected.&lt;ref name="geo"/&gt;

In 1857, [[Llewellyn Jewitt]] became secretary and the museum was opened to the general public on Saturday mornings. In 1858 the [[Derby Philosophical Society]] moved to a house on the Wardwick in Derby as it merged with what was called the Derby Town and County Museum and the Natural History Society.&lt;ref name="geo"/&gt; This move included the society's library of 4,000 volumes, mathematical and scientific apparatus and its collection of fossils.&lt;ref name="geo"&gt;[http://www.geocurator.org/arch/Curator/Vol1No8.pdf Newsletter of the Geological Curators Club] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716055953/http://www.geocurator.org/arch/Curator/Vol1No8.pdf |date=16 July 2011 }}, Vol 1, No. 8, 1976. Retrieved 26 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1863 the botanist [[Stirling Smith Museum and Art Gallery#The early years|Alexander Croall]] was appointed the first Librarian and Curator and the following year the museum and library were joined together. Croall left in 1875&lt;ref name="geo"/&gt; to become the curator of the [[Stirling Smith Museum and Art Gallery|Smith Institute in Stirling]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oldtowncemetery.co.uk/history/croall.html Old Town Cemetery, Stirling], accessed February 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The Derby Town and County Museum was finally transferred into the ownership of Derby Corporation in 1870, but there were difficulties in finding space to display the collections. After placing all the artefacts into storage for three years, the museum was finally opened to the public on 28 June 1879.&lt;ref name="geo"/&gt; The Art Gallery opened in 1882 and in 1883 the museum had electricity supplied for new lighting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.derbyshiregazette.co.uk/attractions/museums/derby-museum-art-gallery/|title=Derby Museum and Art Gallery: Home to a fascinating range of nationally important collections|date=28 March 2018|publisher=Derbyshire Gazette|accessdate=22 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1936 the museum was given a substantial collection of paintings by [[Alfred E. Goodey]] who had been collecting art for 50 years. At his death in 1945 he left £13,000 to build an extension to the museum. The extension, which now houses the museum, was completed in 1964.&lt;ref name="goodeys"/&gt; Refurbishment to parts of both the new and old buildings were undertaken in 2010–11.&lt;ref name=leap&gt;{{cite news|title=Closure could be small step back for a giant leap forward.

A lighting upgrade and installation of a disabled lift will continue, with completion expected in March 2011|newspaper=Evening Telegraph|date=19 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, over 1,000 items were stolen from the museum's storage facility between 2 May and 19 June. The museum did not know about the theft until they accessed the facility to remove an item from storage. Stolen items included coins, medals, and watches. A man was charged with receiving stolen goods in connection with the theft in January 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-derbyshire-19411354 |title=Derby museum theft: Police arrest two men|publisher= BBC |date= 29 August 2012|accessdate=10 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-derbyshire-21044097 |title=Derby museum theft: Man charged |publisher=BBC |date= 16 January 2013|accessdate=10 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Derby and the Enlightenment connection==
[[File:Wright of Derby, The Orrery.jpg|left|thumb|''[[A Philosopher Lecturing on the Orrery]]'', by Joseph Wright, 1766]]
Derby was significant in the eighteenth century for its role in the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], a period in which science and philosophy challenged the [[divine right of kings]] to rule. The enlightenment has many strands, including the largely philosophical "Scottish enlightenment" centred around the philosopher [[David Hume]], and political changes that culminated in the [[French revolution]], but the English Midlands was an area where many key figures of industry and science came together. The [[Lunar Society of Birmingham|Lunar Society]] included [[Erasmus Darwin]], [[Matthew Boulton]], [[Joseph Priestley]] and [[Josiah Wedgwood]] with [[Benjamin Franklin]] corresponding from America.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jquarter.members.beeb.net/morelunar.htm Lunar] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080207075746/http://jquarter.members.beeb.net/morelunar.htm |date=7 February 2008 }}, jquarter.members.beeb.net&lt;/ref&gt; Erasmus Darwin, grandfather of [[Charles Darwin]], started the [[Derby Philosophical Society]] when he moved to Derby in 1783.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | author=Albert Edward Musson, Eric Robinson | year=1969 | title=Science and Technology in the Industrial Revolution | publisher=Manchester University Press | pages=162–163 | isbn=0-7190-0370-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the paintings by [[Joseph Wright of Derby]], which are renowned for their use of light and shade, are of Lunar Society members. The Derby Gallery possesses over 300 sketches and 34 oil paintings by Wright, and also holds a document collection. One of the paintings is entitled ''[[The Alchymist in Search of the Philosopher's Stone]]'' (1771) and it depicts the discovery of the element [[phosphorus]] by German alchemist [[Hennig Brand]] in 1669. A flask into which a large quantity of [[urine]] has been boiled down is seen bursting into light as the phosphorus, which is abundant in urine, ignites spontaneously in air.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Vertesi|first=Janet|title=Light and Enlightenment in Joseph Wright of Derby's The Alchymist|url=http://www.reocities.com/jvertesi/wright/#_ftn11|publisher=ReoCities|accessdate=26 April 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69X9vVjgB?url=http://www.reocities.com/jvertesi/wright/#_ftn11|archivedate=30 July 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[A Philosopher Lecturing on the Orrery]]'' shows an early mechanism for demonstrating the movement of the planets around the sun, and an actual [[orrery]] is on display in the centre of the gallery in front of the painting. The Scottish scientist, astronomer and lecturer [[James Ferguson (1710–1776)|James Ferguson]] undertook a series of lectures in Derby in July 1762.&lt;ref name="Search.revolutionaryplayers.org.uk"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.search.revolutionaryplayers.org.uk/content/files/81/76/355.rtf |title=Search.revolutionaryplayers.org.uk |accessdate=2012-06-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070316172422/http://www.search.revolutionaryplayers.org.uk/content/files/81/76/355.rtf |archivedate=16 March 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; They were based on his book ''Lectures on Select Subjects in Mechanics, Hydrostatics, Pneumatics, Optics &amp;c.'', published in 1760. In order to illustrate his lectures he used various machines, models and instruments. Wright possibly attended Ferguson’s lecture, especially as tickets for the event were available from [[John Whitehurst]], his close neighbour, the clockmaker and scientist. The artist could also have drawn on Whitehurst's practical knowledge to find out more about the orrery and its operation.&lt;ref&gt;Nicolson, Benedict, ''Joseph Wright of Derby: painter of light'', Taylor &amp; Francis, 1968, {{ISBN|0-7100-6284-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance of Joseph Wright's paintings==
[[File:Joseph Wright of Derby The Alchemist.jpg|thumb|left|''[[The Alchemist in Search of the Philosopher's Stone]]'', by [[Joseph Wright of Derby|Joseph Wright]], 1771]]
These factual paintings are considered to have metaphorical meaning too, the bursting into light of the phosphorus in front of a praying figure signifying the problematic transition from faith to scientific understanding and enlightenment, and the various expressions on the figures around the bird in the airpump indicating concern over the possible inhumanity of the coming age of science.&lt;ref name="Search.revolutionaryplayers.org.uk"/&gt; These paintings represent a high point in scientific enquiry which began the undermining of the power of religion in Western societies. Some ten years later scientists worldwide would find themselves persecuted, or even put to death in the backlash to the French Revolution of 1789, itself the culmination of enlightenment thinking. Joseph Priestley, member of the Lunar Society and discoverer of [[oxygen]] would flee Britain after his laboratory in Birmingham was smashed and his house burned down in the [[Priestley Riots|Birmingham riots]] of 1791, by a mob objecting to his outspoken support for the French Revolution;&lt;ref name=Schofield2004&gt;{{citation | last=Schofield | first=Robert E. | year=2004 | title=The enlightened Joseph Priestley: a study of his life and work from 1773 to 1804 | publisher=Penn State Press | isbn=978-0-271-02459-2 | page=151}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his colleague [[Lavoisier]] in France would be executed at the [[guillotine]]. The politician and philosopher [[Edmund Burke]], in his famous ''Reflections on the Revolution in France'' (1790), tied natural philosophers, and specifically Priestley, to the French Revolution, writing that radicals who supported science in Britain "considered man in their experiments no more than they do mice in an air pump". In the light of this comment, Wright's painting of the bird in the air pump, completed over twenty years earlier, seems particularly prescient.&lt;ref name="Search.revolutionaryplayers.org.uk"/&gt;

Because of this web of connections related to science, and the tensions it created which were so subtly illustrated by the art of the painter Joseph Wright of Derby, Derby Museum and Art Gallery, far from being just a collection of fine paintings as the casual visitor might imagine, is significant for being in a place that some would see as having a very significant role in the birth of modern science and industry worldwide. [[Birmingham]], with its science and industry, has been described as the 'silicon valley' of the eighteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Arthur |last=Herman |url=http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/s2.cfm?id=994032002 |title=BOOKS: The outsiders who made the future by moonlight |newspaper=The Scotsman |date=7 September 2002 |accessdate=9 February 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Erasmus Darwin has only a small display. [[Herbert Spencer]], friend of Charles Darwin and originator of the phase "the survival of the fittest", who was born in Derby and has been described as the founder of [[sociology]], does not appear to be mentioned at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.derbyshireuk.net/spencer.html |title=Famous Derbyshire People: Herbert Spencer 1820–1903 |publisher=derbyshireuk.net |accessdate=24 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Repton Stone- detail.JPG|thumb|upright|The mounted figure on the Repton Stone in the museum has been identified as King [[Æthelbald of Mercia]]]]
A fragment of a cross shaft from Repton includes on one face a carved image of a mounted man which, it has been suggested, may be a memorial to [[Æthelbald of Mercia]]. The figure is of a man wearing mail armour and brandishing a sword and shield, with a [[diadem]] bound around his head.

He is the son of [[Dory Funk]] and brother of [[Terry Funk]], and was the promoter of the [[Amarillo]], [[Texas]]-based [[Western States Sports]] promotion. He is credited with the invention of the [[Professional wrestling holds#Cloverleaf|Texas cloverleaf]] submission hold and runs the [[Funking Conservatory]], a [[List of professional wrestling terms#S|professional wrestling school]].

Funk held the [[NWA World Heavyweight Championship]] once. He is the fifth-longest reigning NWA World Heavyweight Champion of all time, holding it for over four years. He also held the [[WWC Universal Heavyweight Championship]] once and the [[CWA World Heavyweight Championship]] once. He is a 2009 [[WWE Hall of Fame]] inductee. He is working for [[All Japan Pro Wrestling]] as the Pacific Wrestling Federation (PWF) chairman.

==Professional wrestling career==

===Training===
Funk's career in professional wrestling began in 1963 just after a college football career with [[West Texas A&amp;M Buffaloes football|West Texas State University]] (now West Texas A&amp;M University), culminating in a 15 to 14 victory over [[Ohio Bobcats football|Ohio University]] in the [[Sun Bowl]] in [[El Paso, Texas]]. Funk's first match was a victory over Don Fargo in [[Amarillo, Texas]]. West Texas State University All American [[Jerry Logan]] was in Funk's corner and Fargo's brother, Jim, was in his corner. Funk was supported by the whole West Texas State University football team and the [[Tascosa High School]] amateur wrestling team. He was doing his student teaching as coach of the Tascosa High wrestling team under coach James Kyle.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

Funk started in his father's Amarillo, Texas-based [[Western States Sports]] promotion and fought Harley Race, Iron Mike DiBiase and Wild Bull Curry. He demonstrated a rugged hard-hitting style that gained attention. He would eventually move on to Florida, Missouri and Japan where his skills improved as he used uppercut forearm smashes, a variety of suplexes and leglocks. Funk won the [[NWA World Heavyweight Championship]] from [[Gene Kiniski]] on February 11, 1969 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nwawrestling.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=41&amp;Itemid=101 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-05-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68Vm9rJdq?url=http://127.0.0.1/ |archivedate=2012-06-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Tampa, Florida]] with a spinning toe hold and remained NWA World Champion for the next four and a half years, which is the second-longest uninterrupted reign of any NWA World Champion&lt;ref name=Encyclopedia&gt;{{cite book|title=WWE. In his many title defences across North America and Japan he fought The Sheik, Johnny Valentine, Jack Brisco, Archie Goudie, Ernie Ladd, Antonio Inoki and Giant Baba.. He also teamed with brother Terry and held both the U.S. and NWA team titles in a feud with Jack and Gerry Brisco. Encyclopedia|last1=Shields|first1=Brian|last2=Sullivan|first2=Kevin|page=83|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley|DK]]|year=2009|isbn=978-0-7566-4190-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Lou Thesz]] held the NWA world title from November 27, 1949, to March 15, 1956). Dory and Terry are the only brothers in history to each hold the title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ocala.com/article/20080310/SPORTS/803100325|title=Ex-champ Dory Funk leaves ring|author=Burton, Richard|publisher=Ocala Star Banner|accessdate=2014-09-12|date=2008-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Funk finally lost the NWA World Championship on May 24, 1973 after a hurried recovery from a pickup truck accident on his father's Flying Mare Ranch in West Texas. Dory was forced into the ring in [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]], losing the belt to [[Harley Race]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Murdock|first=William|title=Brisco|publisher=Culture House Books|location=Newton, Iowa|year=2003|pages=134–135|isbn=0-9676080-7-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Race held the title only a few months before dropping it to Brisco. In truth his father told the NWA board of directors that he didn't want Dory Jr. to lose to fellow face Jack Brisco, so Race was given the nod instead. He performed regularly throughout the NWA, particularly in the [[Jim Crockett Promotions|Mid-Atlantic]] and Ontario as a heel, [[Georgia Championship Wrestling|Georgia]], [[Championship Wrestling from Florida|Florida]] and Central States regions, through the 1970s and early 1980s. In Toronto he fought Ric Flair for the NWA championship. In 1984, he and his brother Terry competed in a tag team match against [[Frank Goodish|Bruiser Brody]] and [[Stan Hansen]] that later received a [[Dave Meltzer#Rating system|5-star rating]] by [[Dave Meltzer]].{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} As well they had a series of matches against Abdullah the Butcher and The Sheik. In Tokyo they were placed against each other in a tournament and Dory won the match.

In 1986, Dory (given the nickname "Hoss") made his WWF debut in a team alongside his brother Terry. The brothers performed at [[WrestleMania 2]] defeating the [[Junkyard Dog]] and [[Tito Santana]]. Terry left the WWF shortly after WrestleMania, but Dory remained, mostly tagging with storyline brother [[Jesse Barr|Jimmy Jack Funk]], who in truth had no relation to the Funk family.  He made an appearance for WCW at the Slamboree 1993: A Legends Reunion Pay-Per-View, wrestling [[Nick Bockwinkel]] to a time limit draw. He also made a single appearance with the WWF as a participant in the [[Royal Rumble (1996)|1996 Royal Rumble]].&lt;ref name=Encyclopedia/&gt;

===Later years===
Funk is now the Coach of the [[Funking Conservatory]] Professional Wrestling School in Ocala, Florida and teaches the Dory Funk Method of Professional Wrestling. Dory's students included [[Jeff Hardy]],&lt;ref name=Encyclopedia/&gt; [[Matt Hardy]],&lt;ref name=Encyclopedia/&gt; [[Christian Cage]], [[Lita (wrestler)|Lita]], [[Kurt Angle]], [[Mickie James]],&lt;ref name=Encyclopedia/&gt; [[Edge (wrestler)|Edge]],&lt;ref name=Encyclopedia/&gt; [[Ted DiBiase]] and [[Test (wrestler)|Test]]. His wife Marti runs BANG TV in which Dory`s matches are featured. On March 1, 2008, Funk and Nishimura defeated [[Genichiro Tenryu]] and [[Masanobu Fuchi]] in Funk's retirement match via [[Professional wrestling holds#Spinning toe hold|spinning toe hold]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gerweck.net Gerweck.Net]; accessed 15 August 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the February 16, 2009 episode of ''Raw'', it was announced that Dory along with his brother Terry would be inducted into the [[WWE Hall of Fame]] Class of 2009 by [[Dusty Rhodes (wrestler)|Dusty Rhodes]]. On the April 1, 2010 edition of [[TNA Today]], Funk appeared on the show to have an interview with [[Jeremy Borash]].{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

On October 27, 2013, Funk returned to All Japan Pro Wrestling, teaming with Terry in a tag team match, where they wrestled Masanobu Fuchi and Osamu Nishimura to a twenty-minute time limit draw.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.all-japan.co.jp/schedule/tour03.php?taikai_id=430 |title=Anniversary Tour |accessdate=2013-10-27 |work=[[All Japan Pro Wrestling]] |language=Japanese |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029193420/http://www.all-japan.co.jp/schedule/tour03.php?taikai_id=430 |archivedate=2013-10-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Funk was then announced as the new Pacific Wrestling Federation (PWF) chairman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://battle-news.com/battle/2013/10/002008.php|script-title=ja:曙が諏訪魔を下し、新ベルトとなった三冠王座を奪取！健在だったファンクスにファン歓喜！ドリフは惜しくもアジアタッグに届かず！|date=2013-10-28|accessdate=2013-10-27|work=Battle News|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/Other_News_4/article_74202.shtml|title=Japan news: Funks return to Japan, Dory Funk named chairman, IWGP &amp; NWA Tag Titles to be defended in same match|last=Caldwell|first=James|date=2013-10-28|accessdate=2013-10-28|work=Pro Wrestling Torch}}&lt;/ref&gt; Funk returned to All Japan on July 27, 2014, teaming with Osamu Nishimura and [[Yutaka Yoshie]] in a six-man tag team match, where they defeated Masanobu Fuchi, [[Takao Omori]] and [[Último Dragón]], with Funk submitting Fuchi for the win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://battle-news.com/fight/index.php?QBlog-20140728-1|title=【全日本プロレス】諏訪魔vsドーリングの三冠戦、青木vs光留の世界Jr戦|date=2014-07-28|accessdate=2014-07-27|work=Battle News|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; Funk's next match with All Japan took place on May 31, 2015, when he and Nishimura wrestled Fuchi and [[Yoshiaki Fujiwara]] to a twenty-minute time limit draw.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://battle-news.com/?p=9674|title=5.31全日本プロレス大阪大会『ファン感謝デー』でドリーと藤原の対戦が実現！潮崎＆宮原はビッグガンズを下して世界タッグV1|date=2015-06-01|accessdate=2015-06-01|work=Battle News|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; The day before at age 74 he teamed with old student Tenryu and [[Nosawa Rongai]] for [[Tenryu Project]] to beat [[Kohei Suwama]], [[Hikaru Sato]] and [[Atsushi Aoki]]. He returned to All Japan the next month to team with Fuchi and [[Ultimo Dragon]] to beat his student Nishimura, [[Masao Inoue]] and Soma Takao.

==Personal life==
Dory married his first wife, Jimmie, on June 8, 1960.&lt;ref name="Texas Divorces"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.familytreelegends.com/records/31992?c=search&amp;first=dory&amp;last=funk|title=Free Family Tree, Genealogy and Family History - MyHeritage|website=www.familytreelegends.com|accessdate=14 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together, they have three children: Dory III, Adam Dirk, and Penny. They also have five grandchildren. They later separated and were officially divorced on July 6, 1983. Dory III went into medicine and now practices out of Colorado. Dory IV is now training to be a wrestler under Dory Jr. In 1980, Dory met his second and current wife, Marti; the couple married in 1989. He has two children.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

'''''E.S v. Austria''''' was a case held before the  [[European Court of Human Rights]] (ECtHR) case where the court upheld a domestic court's fine on an Austrian woman who had called Mohammed a pedophile. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://hudoc.echr.coe.int/eng-press#%7B%22itemid%22:%5B%22003-6234980-8105265%22%5D%7D|title=HUDOC - European Court of Human Rights|last=ECHR|website=hudoc.echr.coe.int|access-date=2018-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The applicant, E.S., is an Austrian national who was born in 1971 and lives in Vienna.

In October and November 2009, Mrs S. held two seminars entitled “Basic Information on Islam”, in which she discussed the marriage between the Prophet [[Muhammad]] and a six-year old girl, [[Aisha]], which allegedly was consummated when she was nine. Inter alia, the applicant stated that Muhammad “liked to do it with children” and “… A 56-year-old and a six-year-old? … What do we call it, if it is not paedophilia?”.

On 15 February 2011 the Vienna Regional Criminal Court found that these statements implied that Muhammad had had paedophilic tendencies, and convicted Mrs S. for disparaging religious doctrines. She was ordered to pay a fine of 480 euros and the costs of the proceedings. Mrs S. appealed but the Vienna Court of Appeal upheld the decision in December 2011, confirming in essence the lower court’s findings.

== Original statement ==

The statement that the Austrian woman originally said was:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lawandreligionuk.com/2018/10/26/freedom-of-expression-or-criminal-blasphemy-es-v-austria/|title=Freedom of expression or criminal blasphemy?: ES v Austria|access-date=2018-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|''One of the biggest problems we are facing today is that Muhammad is seen as the ideal man, the perfect human, the perfect Muslim. That means that the highest commandment for a male Muslim is to imitate Muhammad, to live his life. This does not happen according to our social standards and laws. Because he was a warlord, he had many women, to put it like this, and liked to do it with children. And according to our standards, he was not a perfect human. We have huge problems with that today, that Muslims get into conflict with democracy and our value system …

''The most important of all Hadith collections recognised by all legal schools: The most important is the Sahih Al-Bukhari. If a Hadith was quoted after Bukhari, one can be sure that all Muslims will recognise it. And, unfortunately, in Al-Bukhari the thing with Aisha and child sex is written…

''I remember my sister, I have said this several times already, when ''[S.W.]'' made her famous statement in Graz, my sister called me and asked: ‘For God’s sake. Did you tell ''[S.W.]'' that?’ To which I answered: ‘No, it wasn’t me, but you can look it up, it’s not really a secret.’ And her: ‘You can’t say it like that!’ And me: ‘A 56-year-old and a six-year-old? What do you call that? Give me an example? What do we call it, if it is not paedophilia?’ Her: ‘Well, one has to paraphrase it, say it in a more diplomatic way.’ My sister is symptomatic ''[sic]''. We have heard that so many times. ‘Those were different times’ – it wasn’t okay back then, and it’s not okay today. Full stop. And it is still happening today. One can never approve something like that. They all create their own reality because the truth is so cruel …}}

== Court's decision ==

Only where expressions under Article 10 went beyond the limits of a critical denial, and certainly where they were likely to incite religious intolerance, might a state legitimately consider them to be incompatible with respect for the freedom of thought, conscience and religion and take proportionate restrictive measures.

The court noted that the domestic courts comprehensively explained why they considered that the applicant’s statements had been capable of arousing justified indignation; specifically, they had not been made in an objective manner contributing to a debate of public interest (e.g. on child marriage), but could only be understood as having been aimed at demonstrating that Muhammad was not worthy of worship

Furthermore her statements were partly based on untrue facts and apt to arouse indignation in others. The national courts found that Mrs S. had subjectively labelled Muhammad with paedophilia as his general sexual preference, and that she failed to neutrally inform her audience of the historical background, which consequently did not allow for a serious debate on that issue. Hence, the court saw no reason to depart from the domestic courts’ qualification of the impugned statements as value judgments which they had based on a detailed analysis of the statements made.

The court held further that even in a lively discussion it was not compatible with Article 10 of the Convention to pack incriminating statements into the wrapping of an otherwise acceptable expression of opinion and claim that this rendered passable those statements exceeding the permissible limits of freedom of expression.

== International reactions ==

The case was subject to much misinformation in public reporting, including the accusation that the judgment "imposed" a blasphemy law in Europe. Nevertheless, it was a source of concern for human rights commentators. The [[International Humanist and Ethical Union]], an INGO concerned with [[secular humanism|humanist]] advocacy and repeal of blasphemy laws, was "frustrated" that the court did not uphold the complainant's Article 10 rights, criticising the court's "timidity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://iheu.org/european-court-fails-overturn-blasphemy-conviction-austria/|title=IHEU ‘frustrated’, as European Court fails to overturn ‘blasphemy’ conviction in Austria|date=26 October 2018|accessdate=15 November 2018|publisher=[[International Humanist and Ethical Union]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The British charity [[Humanists UK]], which campaigns on similar issues internationally, criticised the ruling as "fundamentally at odds with the spirit and tradition of free expression in Europe" expressed hope the case would be appealed and overturned in the Grand Chamber. It criticised the court's rationale in balancing the Article 10 right it is sworn to protect against "a previously nonexistent right to protection of one’s ‘religious feelings’".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://humanism.org.uk/2018/10/29/european-court-of-human-rights-rules-that-austria-can-keep-its-blasphemy-law/|work=Humanists UK|date=29 October 2018|title=European Court of Human Rights rules that Austria can keep its blasphemy law}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in ''[[The Atlantic]]'', Simon Cottee expressed serious concerns about the judgment, saying "it has given legitimacy to what is in all but name an Austrian blasphemy law, and by invoking the slippery notion of “religious peace,” it has effectively given a veto to those who would deploy violence in defense of their religious beliefs."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2018/10/europe-rules-against-free-speech/574369/|title=A Flawed European Ruling on Free Speech|work=[[The Atlantic]]|accessdate=15 November 2018|last=Cottee|first=Simon|date=31 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''European Case Law Identifier''' (ECLI) is an [[identifier]] for [[case law]] in Europe, implemented by the European Union  Court of Justice, the European Court of Human Rights, the European Patent Office and several [[Member States of the European Union|EU Member States]]. The identifier consists of 5 parts separated by colons: '''ECLI:'''''[country code]''''':'''''[court identifier]''''':'''''[year of decision]''''':'''''[specific identifier]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://alnola.home.xs4all.nl/pubs/Marc_van_Opijnen_fik_ECLI.pdf |title=European Case Law Identifier: Indispensable Asset for Legal Information Retrieval |publisher= Marc van Opijnen |accessdate=May 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system contains also a set of uniform [[metadata]] to improve search facilities for case law. The standard is laid down in the [[Council of the European Union|Council]] Conclusions inviting the introduction of the European Case Law Identifier (ECLI) and a minimum set of uniform metadata for case law of the European Union.&lt;ref name="r1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2011:127:0001:0007:EN:PDF|title=Council conclusions inviting the introduction of the European Case Law Identifier (ECLI) and a minimum set of uniform metadata for case law|date=22 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The concept of ECLI was first&lt;ref name="r2"&gt;{{cite book |last= Cottin |first= Stéphane |title= La gestion de la documentation juridique |year= 2011|publisher= L.G.D.J.|location= Paris|isbn= 978-2-275-03534-5 |page=67 (footnote 113)}}&lt;/ref&gt; launched at the Legal Access Conference (Paris, December 2008)&lt;ref name="r3"&gt;
{{cite journal |last1=van Opijnen |first1= Marc|year= 2008|title= Identifiers, Metadata and Document Structures: Essential Ingredients for Inter-European Case Law Search|journal= European Legal Access Conference, Paris 10–12 December|url=http://www.legalaccess.eu/?Identifiants-metadonnees-et}}
&lt;/ref&gt; and at Jurix Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Law in Florence (December 2008).&lt;ref name="r4"&gt;
{{cite journal |last1=van Opijnen |first1=Marc |year= 2008|title= Finding Case Law on a European Scale – Current Practice and Future Work|journal= Legal Knowledge and Information Systems – JURIX 2008: the Twenty-First Annual Conference|editor1-first=E.|editor1-last=Francesconi |editor2-first=G. |editor2-last=Sartor|editor3-first=D.|editor3-last=Tiscornia |pages= 43–52|publisher= IOS Press|ssrn=2046266}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Around the same time, the study by a task group of the EU Council Working Group on e-Law showed that accessibility of judicial decisions, both at the national and European level, was seriously hampered by the lack of standardised identifiers and metadata:
&lt;blockquote&gt;''The task group suggested to establish a voluntary common identification system based on the European Case-Law Identifier (ECLI). ECLI as an identifier would be linked to an index with references. This would enable any citizen or legal practitioner to find any decision to which ECLI has been attributed from any public or private register or database in the EU. In addition a Dublin-core implementation for case-law should be established to facilitate searching case-law in different search engines.''&lt;ref name="r5"&gt;{{cite book |last= EU Working Party on Legal Data Processing (e-Law)|title=Draft Conclusions of the Council on European Case-Law Identifier (ECLI) |url=http://register.consilium.europa.eu/pdf/en/09/st17/st17377.en09.pdf |accessdate= 2013-01-27|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Based on the report of this task group, the Council of Ministers agreed on the principles of ECLI and common metadata, and asked the EU Council Working Party on Legal Data Processing (e-Law) to elaborate the initial work.&lt;ref name="r5" /&gt; This continued work resulted in the Council Conclusion inviting the introduction of the European Case Law Identifier (ECLI) and a minimum set of uniform metadata for case law of the European Union.,&lt;ref name="r1" /&gt; decided upon by the Council of Ministers on 22 December 2010. It was published in the Official Journal of 29 April 2011 (2011/C 127/01).

==Identifier construction==
ECLI does not primarily identify a paper or electronic document containing a judgment, but instead  identifies the judgment at a more abstract level. In the terminology of the [[Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records]] on which it is based, ECLI is a work-level identifier. It is constructed with the intention to be meaningful, open, technological neutral, recognisable for both humans and computers, error-proof and interoperable with other identifiers.&lt;ref name="r8"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=van Opijnen|first1=Marc |year= 2011|title=European Case Law Identifier: indispensable asset for legal information retrieval |journal= From Information to Knowledge. Online Access to Legal Information: Methodologies, Trends and Perspectives|editor1-first=M.A.|editor1-last=Biasiotti |editor2-first=S. |editor2-last=Faro|pages=91–104 |publisher= IOS Press|ssrn=2046160}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The formatting rules for ECLI are prescribed in detail in the Annex to the Council Conclusions. Summarized, an ECLI always consists of five parts, separated by a colon: 
* 'ECLI' as a self-identifier;
* The country code, prescribed by the interinstitutional style guide of the EU.&lt;ref name="r9"&gt;{{cite book |last= Publications Office of the EU|title=Interinstitutional Style Guide|url=http://publications.europa.eu/code/en/en-000100.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The standard uses mostly [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2]] codes with the exception of the United Kingdom (UK). A special code for non-states can be assigned by the European Commission;
* The court code, to be assigned by the national ECLI co-ordinator; it has a maximum length of seven positions;
* The year the judgment is rendered, written in four digits;
* A unique code to make an ECLI unique. The maximum length of this code is 25 characters. Only letters, digits and dots are to be used, other punctuation marks or whitespace are not allowed. Pre-existing national identifiers can be used for this fifth part, of which the date of judgment can be a part too. Also a serial number which is generated especially for ECLI is possible. It is up to the national ECLI co-ordinator to decide on the construction of this last part.
Only the Latin alphabet is to be used, and that ECLI is case-insensitive, although it is written preferably in capitals. 
An example of a case law identifier of the Rotterdam court is ECLI:NL:RBROT:2013:5042,&lt;ref&gt;http://uitspraken.rechtspraak.nl/inziendocument?id=ECLI:NL:RBROT:2013:5042&lt;/ref&gt; which indicates a Dutch decision (NL) of 2013 of the Rotterdam court (RBROT) with serial number 5042.

==ECLI website==
According to paragraph 4 of the Annex to the Council Conclusions an ECLI website has to be set up, containing
* general information on ECLI;
* a list of participating countries, with, for each country: 
** the court codes used;
** information on the formatting of the fifth part of the ECLI code;
** information on the national ECLI co-ordinator. 
The ECLI website&lt;ref&gt;[https://e-justice.europa.eu/content_european_case_law_identifier_ecli-175-en.do ECLI website]&lt;/ref&gt; was set up within the frame work of the e-justice portal of the European Union and contains this information.

==ECLI search engine==
According to paragraph 5 of the Annex to the Council Conclusions an ECLI search interface has to be set up, enabling search by ECLI and metadata. 
This [https://e-justice.europa.eu/content_ecli_search_engine-430-en.do?m=1 ECLI search engine] launched on 4 May 2016. It provides access to national and European case law, stored in whatever database. Searches are possible on the basis of the ECLI, its metadata as well as full-text.

As prescribed by the Council Conclusions a resolver is available at &lt;nowiki&gt;https://e-justice.europa.eu/ecli/&lt;/nowiki&gt;; with an ECLI typed after it, this link with show all available information on this ECLI, from whatever indexed website. As an example: &lt;nowiki&gt;https://e-justice.europa.eu/ecli/ECLI:CZ:NS:2015:32.CDO.2051.2013.1
&lt;/nowiki&gt; shows from {{ECLI|ECLI:CZ:NS:2015:32.CDO.2051.2013.1}}, a decision from the Czech Supreme Court, the information from the website of that court as well as from the [http://www.aca-europe.eu/index.php/en/jurifast-en Jurifast database] of the [[Association of Councils of State and Supreme Administrative Jurisdictions of the EU]]. The latter document also has English and French metadata.

Documents are indexed by the ECLI search engine in cooperation between the European Commission and data providers, using the [[Sitemaps|sitemaps protocol]] and [[Robots exclusion standard|robots.txt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=van Opijnen |first1=Marc |last2=Ivantchev |first2=Alexander |year= 2015|title= Implementation of ECLI - State of Play|journal= Legal Knowledge and Information Systems – JURIX 2015: the Twenty-Eighth Annual Conference|editor1-first=A.|editor1-last=Rotolo |publisher= IOS Press|ssrn=2706768}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organisation==
The Council of Ministers is responsible for any future changes in the standard, while the European Commission is responsible for the ECLI-website and the (planned) ECLI search interface. The Commission is also responsible for handing out 2 letter "country codes" for international organisations that use the system.

===National level===
Every Member State (or other entity that wishes to participate in the ECLI system, including the EU itself) must have a national ECLI co-ordinator. The main responsibilities of this national ECLI co-ordinator are: 
* to decide on the court codes to be used (the third part of the ECLI);
* to decide on the construction of the fifth part of ECLI;
* to update the national information pages on the implementation of ECLI on the European e-justice portal;
* to decide on specific language varieties of certain metadata.

==Implementation in individual jurisdictions==
According to the Council Conclusions, Member States are free to decide on their own implementation route. A big-bang scenario is possible, but also a step-by-step approach is allowed. International organizations may also participate and can request a "country code" from the European Commission.

===Austria===
Austria started the introduction of ECLI in the beginning of 2014. Currently the ECLI is assigned to judgments of the [[:de:Bundesverwaltungsgericht (Österreich)|Federal administrative court]], the [[:de:Bundesfinanzgericht|Federal financial court]], the [[:de:Landesverwaltungsgericht|administrative courts]], the [[:de:Verfassungsgerichtshof (Österreich)|Constitutional court]]  and the [[:de:Datenschutzbehörde (Österreich)|Data protection Authority]]. The national ECLI co-ordinator in Austria is the [[Federal Chancellery of Austria|Federal Chancellery]].

===Czech Republic===
Since the first of April 2012&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://finance.idnes.cz/nejvyssi-soud-cr-se-pripojil-k-systemu-ecli-feb-/pravo.aspx?c=A120415_194341_pravo_vr|title=Nejvyšší soud ČR se připojil k systému ECLI|date=15 April 2012|publisher= iDNES.cz|accessdate=2014-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the Czech Republic decisions of the [[Supreme Court of the Czech Republic|Supreme Court]] have an ECLI, e.g. 'ECLI:CZ:NS:2012:6.TDO.1416.2012.1'. The national ECLI co-ordinator in the Czech Republic is the [[Supreme Court of the Czech Republic|Supreme Court]].

Starting in March 2014, the decisions of the [[Constitutional Court of the Czech Republic|Constitutional Court]] also use ECLI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://e-justice.europa.eu/content_european_case_law_identifier_ecli-175-cz-cs.do?member=1|title=Portál evropské e-Justice|date=27 March 2018|publisher= europa.eu|accessdate=2018-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Finland===
In March 2016 ECLI was implemented on the [http://data.finlex.fi open data portal] of Finland.

===France===
France started assigning ECLI's to judgments of the [[Conseil d'Etat (France)|Council of State (Conseil d'Etat)]] and [[Court of Cassation (France)|Supreme Court (Cour de cassation)]] in September 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://donneesjuridiques.wordpress.com/2012/09/11/lidentifiant-ecli-sur-les-decisions-du-conseil-detat-et-de-la-cour-de-cassation/ |title=L’identifiant ECLI sur les décisions du Conseil d’Etat et de la Cour de cassation |date=11 September 2012 |publisher= Données juridiques|accessdate=2013-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; ECLI's of the Council of State can be found on [http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr Legifrance], e.g. 'ECLI:FR:CESSR:2013:358751.20130123'. Judgments of the Supreme Court have an ECLI on the [http://www.courdecassation.fr website of the Court], e.g. 'ECLI:FR:CCASS:2013:AV00005'. Also all published decisions of the [[Conseil Constitutionnel|Constitutional Council (Conseil Constitutionnel)]] have an ECLI assigned. With regard to the [[:fr:Tribunal des conflits (France)|Tribunal des conflits]] only decisions from 2012 on have an ECLI. The national ECLI co-ordinator in France is [[:fr:Direction de l'information légale et administrative|the Office of Legal and Administrative Information]].

===Germany===
In Germany the ECLI was introduced for the [[Federal Administrative Court of Germany|Federal administrative court]] on 23 September 2013. An example of an ECLI from this court: {{ECLI|ECLI:DE:BVerwG:2013:121213U2C49.11.0}}. In 2015 ECLI was also introduced for the [[Federal Constitutional Court of Germany|Constitutional Court]] and the [[Federal Labour Court of Germany|Federal Labour Court]]. The national ECLI co-ordinator in Germany is the Competence center for the federal legal information system of the Federal Office of Justice. ECLI is also available for 100 000 decisions of the courts of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.justiz.nrw.de/BS/nrwe2/index.php |work= Rechtsprechung Nordrhein-Westfalen, Search Engine |agency= Justice portal of North Rhine-Westphalia |accessdate= 26 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Malta===
In Malta 'Courts of Malta' is the national ECLI co-ordinator. According to the information supplied by Malta, ECLI has been introduced in December 2011 for all new court decisions, but the code is as of August 2014 not visible to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://e-justice.europa.eu/newsManagement.do?plang=en&amp;action=show&amp;idNews=50|title=The inclusion of European Case Law Identifier (ECLI) code in Malta|date=1 February 2012|accessdate=2013-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Greece===
The decisions of the [[Council of State (Greece)|Council of State]] have an ECLI and are available through the ECLI search engine. The country code for Greece is EL, and the court code for the council of state is COS.

===Netherlands===
In the Netherlands the Council for the Judiciary is the national ECLI co-ordinator. On 28 June 2013 ECLI was introduced for all courts, replacing the national [[:nl:Landelijk Jurisprudentie Nummer|LJN]] identifier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rechtspraak.nl/Actualiteiten/Nieuws/Pages/European-Case-Law-Identifier-vervangt-Landelijk-Jurisprudentie-Nummer.aspx|title=European Case Law Identifier vervangt Landelijk Jurisprudentie Nummer|date=31 October 2012|accessdate=2013-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; ECLI is not only assigned to those decisions published on the national judicial portal website [http://www.rechtspraak.nl Rechtspraak.nl], but also to those published in commercial law reviews and those stored in an internal database of the judiciary. In total, more than 2 million decisions have been assigned an ECLI.

If a decision previously has had an LJN, this code (two letters and four digits) has been transposed to the fifth part of ECLI. E.g. LJN BN5158, a decision of the court of appeal Den Bosch, is now {{ECLI|ECLI:NL:GHSHE:2010:BN5158}}. Decisions which are published after the introduction of ECLI have a serial number in the fifth part of ECLI. E.g. {{ECLI|ECLI:NL:RBROT:2013:4788}}, a decision by the district court of Rotterdam.

Both a list of the [http://www.rechtspraak.nl/Uitspraken-en-Registers/Uitspraken/Pages/ECLI.aspx most used court codes] and a [https://www.rechtspraak.nl/Uitspraken-en-nieuws/Uitspraken/Paginas/Volledige-lijst-Nederlandse-gerechtscodes.aspx full list of all court codes] can be found at the website of the judiciary. The full ECLI register and all decisions published on the portal are also available as open data. The register covers all judicial organizations of the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]], including the parts which are outside the European Union.

===Portugal===
Having started in January 2017, a beta version of the Portuguese portal was released in May 2017, Portugal assigns an ECLI to all judicial decisions which have been rendered after 1932 on a total of 175 000 decisions.  The country code for Portugal is PT. The national ECLI co-ordinator in Portugal is the [http://www.csm.org.pt/ Judicial High Council], and the Portal is being developed by a team of the Information Division of [http://www.csm.org.pt/ Judicial High Council]. An example of a Portuguese ECLI is '[https://jurisprudencia.csm.org.pt/ecli/ECLI:PT:TRP:2017:671.14.0GAMCN.P1 ECLI:PT:TRP:2017:671.14.0GAMCN.P1]'. The Portuguese ECLI portal url is https://jurisprudencia.csm.org.pt

===Slovakia===
Slovakia assigns an ECLI to all judicial decisions which have been rendered after 25 July 2011. Also judgments rendered before that date, but appealed after it have an ECLI assigned.

===Slovenia===
Having started on 1 October 2011, Slovenia was the first country to assign ECLI's  to judgments on their judiciary website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sodisce.si/znanje/sodna_praksa judiciary website]&lt;/ref&gt;  ECLI is assigned to all judgments of the Supreme Court and the courts of appeal. An example of a Slovenian ECLI is 'ECLI:SI:VSRS:2012:III.IPS.15.2012'.

===Spain===
In November 2014 the Council of the Judiciary in Spain assigned ECLI to all judgments published in its public case law database.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.poderjudicial.es/search judiciary website]&lt;/ref&gt; ECLI is based on the national case law identifier 'ROJ'. E.g. for ROJ 'ROJ: STS 12/2014' the ECLI is 'ECLI:ES:TS:2014:12'. The first character of the ROJ-code, indicating the type of decision (in this example the 'S' of 'sentencia'), is not used in the ECLI.

===International Organizations===
The European Patent Office (an organ of the European Patent Organization, which has 38 Member States in Europe) is one of two not-EU related organisations which has introduced ECLI.

====Council of Europe====
The [[European Court of Human Rights]] - connected to the [[Council of Europe]] - introduced ECLI in 2015 retroactively in its [http://hudoc.echr.coe.int HUDOC] case law database. The country code is 'CE' (Council of Europe), the court code is 'ECHR'. The fifth part of the ECLI identifier contains from left to right: the month the document was rendered (2 digits), the day the document was rendered (2 digits), the type of document ('JUD' for judgment, 'DEC' for decision, 'REP' for report) and finally the application number (with leading zeros to a total of nine digits). The Pretto judgment can serve as an example ECLI:CE:ECHR:1983:1208JUD000798477.

====European Patent Office====
The European Patent Office introduced ECLI publicly in 2013 with "country-code" EP retroactively. An example is of a case before the Board of Appeal (BA) from 1991 is: ECLI:EP:BA:1991:W000491.19910131.

====European Union====
The [[Court of Justice of the European Union]] is the 'national' ECLI co-ordinator for the EU and introduced ECLI on 24 March 2014. ECLI is assigned to all decisions of the Court and opinions of the [[Advocate General]]. The institution uses three court codes, which also include decisions of its legal predecessors Court of Justice of the European Communities and the Court of Justice of the [[European Coal and Steel Community|European Coal and Steel Communities]]:
*'C', [[European Court of Justice|Court of Justice]] (colloquially: European Court of Justice)
*'T' [[General Court (European Union)|General Court]] (in operation since 1989) 
*'F', [[Civil Service Tribunal (European Union)|Civil Service Tribunal]] (since 2005)  
The fifth part of the ECLI code is serial number, that has no relation to any other identifier. ECLI is now also used when the Court is citing its own case law. For this the Court uses the ECLI without the prefix 'ECLI:'. This is explained by the Court as: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;''In the interest of not extending the reference to no good purpose, the prefix ‘ECLI' will not be included in the citation of the decisions of the Court of Justice, the General Court or the Civil Service Tribunal,''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://curia.europa.eu/jcms/jcms/P_125997|title=New method of citing the case-law of the Court of Justice of the European Union on the basis of the ECLI|accessdate=12 May 2014|work=Court of Justice of the European Union (Curia)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Since 24 March 2014 the case law of the Court of Justice can also be searched by ECLI on [[EUR-Lex]] and since 4 May 2016 all case law is also available on the [https://e-justice.europa.eu/content_ecli_search_engine-430-en.do?m=1 ECLI search engine].

==Metadata==
[[Metadata]] are to be attached to documents containing a judicial decision. They can relate to the ECLI itself (on the bibliographic work level, e.g.: date of the decision), but also to a specific editorial version (the 'expression level', e.g. a summary). In the Council Conclusions nine mandatory and eight optional metadata are listed. All these are based on the [[Dublin Core metadata standard]]. The mandatory means that without these metadata, a document can not be indexed by the future ECLI search interface.

===Mandatory metadata===
The mandatory metadata, as listed in the Annex to the Council Conclusions, are: 
* dcterms:identifier: a URL where the document is located;
* dcterms:isVersionOf: the ECLI; 
* dcterms:creator: the name of the court;
* dcterms:coverage: country or part thereof;
* dcterms:date: the date of the decision;
* dcterms:language: the language of the document;
* dcterms:publisher: the organisation responsible for the publication of the current document;
* dcterms:accessRights: either public or private;
* dcterms:type: the type of decision. If none is specified it defaults to 'judicial decision'.

===Optional metadata===
The optional metadata, as listed in the Annex to the Council Conclusions, are: 
* dcterms:title; a Title field
* dcterms:subject: the [[field of law]]; at least one value should be picked out of a controlled vocabulary;
* dcterms:abstract: a summary or description;
* dcterms:description: keywords or headnotes;
* dcterms:contributor: judges, advocate-general or other staff;
* dcterms:issued: the date of the current document (not necessarily the date of the decision);
* dcterms:references: References to other case law (the use of CELEX-numbers or ECLI's is advised, but also other formats are allowed);
* dcterms:isReplacedBy: ECLI by which the ECLI has been replaced (to guarantee persistency in case ECLI's are renumbered).

The '''Everton Genealogy Collection''' was a noncirculating collection of [[genealogy]] and [[local history]] items that was part of the [[Logan Library]] in [[Logan, Utah]]. It included approximately 80,000 [[books]], [[serial (fiction)|serials]], [[pamphlets]], [[compact discs]], [[microfilms]], [[atlases]], [[map]]s, and [[databases]]. A large portion consisted of unpublished manuscripts that were rare or unique to the collection. The materials in the collection related to every state in the [[United States]] and the [[District of Columbia]]. While the focus was on the United States, there were resources for other nations as well.

==History==

The Everton Genealogy Collection was started in 1947 by [[Walter Everton]] when he established the [[Everton Publishing Company]]. He and his successors in the company gathered items to be included in this collection. Some were donated, but most were added when they were sent to be reviewed in their magazine, ''The Genealogical Helper''. Over the course of nearly sixty years, the collection gradually grew to its present size.

In 2001, the publishing company was purchased by the [[Family History Network, Inc.]] and in 2004, then owner Bill Schjelderup, donated the collection to Logan City.  In October 2006 the collection opened to the public in the former Logan Justice building. In early 2008, the collection was closed to the public while city departments shuffled buildings.

==Current Status==

In 2010, a condensed collection opened to the public within the Logan Library in the space formerly occupied by the Logan Municipal Council. It is no longer identified as the Everton Collection but continues to be a large portion of the items housed in the library's Virginia Hansen Special Collections Room.

The '''Family Jewels''' is the informal name used to refer to a set of reports that detail activities conducted by the [[United States]] [[Central Intelligence Agency]]. Considered illegal or inappropriate, these actions were conducted over the span of decades, from the 1950s to the mid-1970s.&lt;ref name="WaPoJun22"&gt;{{cite news |first=Karen |last=DeYoung |authorlink=Karen DeYoung |author2=Walter Pincus |title=CIA to Air Decades of Its Dirty Laundry|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/21/AR2007062102434_pf.html |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=2007-06-22 |accessdate=2007-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Colby]], who was the [[CIA director]] in the mid-1970s and helped in the compilation of the reports, dubbed them the "skeletons" in the CIA's closet.&lt;ref name="WaPoJun22"/&gt; Most of the documents were publicly released on June 25, 2007, after more than three decades of secrecy.&lt;ref name="WaPoJun27"&gt;{{cite news |first=Karen |last=DeYoung |authorlink=Karen DeYoung |author2=Walter Pincus |title=CIA Releases Files on Past Misdeeds |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/26/AR2007062600861.html |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=2007-06-27 |accessdate=2017-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYTJun26"&gt;{{cite news |title=C.I.A.

==Background==
The reports that constitute the CIA's "Family Jewels" were commissioned in 1973 by then [[Director of Central Intelligence|CIA director]] [[James R. Schlesinger]], in response to press accounts of CIA involvement in the [[Watergate scandal]]—in particular, support to the burglars, [[E. Howard Hunt]] and [[James W. McCord Jr.|James McCord]], both CIA veterans.&lt;ref name="WaPoJun22"/&gt; On May 7, 1973, Schlesinger signed a directive commanding senior officers to compile a report of current or past CIA actions that may have fallen outside the agency's charter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nsarchive.chadwyck.com/marketing/fj/displayItemId.do?ItemID=FJ00036 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-05-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728032415/http://nsarchive.chadwyck.com/marketing/fj/displayItemId.do?ItemID=FJ00036 |archivedate=2011-07-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting report, which was in the form of a 693-page loose-leaf book of memos, was passed on to [[William Colby]] when he succeeded Schlesinger as Director of Central Intelligence in late 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Prados|first=John|title=Safe for Democracy: The Secret Wars of the CIA|date=2006|publisher=Ivan R. Dee|isbn=9781615780112|page=[https://books.google.no/books?id=3OCDelYICIsC&amp;pg=PA432 432]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Leaks and official release==
[[Investigative journalist]] [[Seymour Hersh]] revealed some of the contents of the "Family Jewels" in a front-page ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' article in December 1974,&lt;ref&gt;Image of the article: [http://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/238963/huge-c-i-a-operation-reported-in-u-s-against.pdf "Huge C.I.A. operation reported in U.S. against antiwar forces, other dissidents in Nixon years"]. Seymour Hersh, ''The New York Times'', 22 December 1974. (Reproduced by permission of copy right holder; further reproduction prohibited.)&lt;/ref&gt; in which he reported that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The Central Intelligence Agency, directly violating its charter, conducted a massive, illegal domestic intelligence operation during the [[Nixon Administration]] against the [[antiwar movement]] and other [[dissident]] groups in the United States according to well-placed Government sources.&lt;ref name="Hersh1974"&gt;{{cite news |first=Seymour |last=Hersh |authorlink=Seymour Hersh |title=Huge C.I.A. operation reported in U.S. against antiwar forces, other dissidents in Nixon years |work=[[The New York Times]] |page= 1|date=1974-12-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Additional details of the contents trickled out over the years, but requests by journalists and historians for access to the documents under the [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] were long denied. Finally, in June 2007, CIA Director [[Michael Hayden (general)|Michael Hayden]] announced that the documents would be released to the public at an announcement made to the annual meeting of the Society for Historians of American Foreign Relations.&lt;ref name="WaPoJun22"/&gt; A six-page summary of the reports was made available at the [[National Security Archive]] (based at [[George Washington University]]), with the following introduction:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The Central Intelligence Agency violated its charter for 25 years until revelations of illegal [[wiretapping]], domestic surveillance, [[assassination]] plots, and [[human experimentation]] led to official investigations and reforms in the 1970s.&lt;ref name= GWU/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The complete set of documents, with some redactions (including a number of pages in their entirety), was released on the CIA website on June 25, 2007.&lt;ref name="FJ"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foia.cia.gov/sites/default/files/document_conversions/89801/DOC_0001451843.pdf|format=PDF|title=Family Jewels|website=foia.cia.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
The reports describe numerous activities conducted by the CIA during the 1950s to 1970s that violated its charter. According to a briefing provided by CIA Director [[William Colby]] to the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] on December 31, 1974, these included 18 issues which were of legal concern:&lt;ref name=Memo&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB222/family_jewels_wilderotter.pdf |title=Memorandum: CIA Matters |accessdate=2007-06-22 |author=James A.

==Reactions to release==
Then-President of [[Cuba]], [[Fidel Castro]], who was the target of multiple [[Assassination attempts on Fidel Castro|CIA assassination attempts]] reported in these documents, responded to their release on July 1, 2007, saying that the United States was still a "killing machine" and that the revealing of the documents was an attempt at diversion.&lt;ref&gt;[[Fidel Castro]], [http://www.juventudrebelde.cu/cuba/2007-07-01/la-maquina-de-matar La máquina de matar], ''[[Juventud Rebelde]]'', July 1, 2007.{{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.miamiherald.com/915/story/157565.html Castro: US is still a 'killing machine'], [[Associated Press]], published in ''[[The Miami Herald]]'', July 1, 2007 {{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Corn]] of the [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal / progressive]] magazine ''[[The Nation]]'' wrote that one key 'jewel' had been redacted and remained classified.&lt;ref name="The Nation; June 26, 2007"&gt;{{cite news |last=Corn |first=David |author-link=David Corn |date=June 26, 2007 |title=Where's the CIA's Missing Jewel? |url=http://www.thenation.com/article/wheres-cias-missing-jewel/ |newspaper=The Nation |access-date=August 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing for ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[Amy Zegart]] wrote: "Given all the illegal activities actually listed in this document, the hidden sections are all the more disturbing."&lt;ref name="Zegart"&gt;{{cite news |last=Zegart |first=Amy |date=June 26, 2007 |title=Keeping Track of All the Redactions |url=http://washington.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/06/26/entire-category-of-activities-still-classified/ |newspaper=The New York Times |location=New York |accessdate=October 22, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Filesystem Hierarchy Standard''' ('''FHS''') defines the [[directory structure]] and directory contents in [[Linux]] distributions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://wiki.debian.org/FilesystemHierarchyStandard|title=FilesystemHierarchyStandard - Debian Wiki|website=wiki.debian.org|access-date=2016-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is maintained by the [[Linux Foundation]]. The latest version is 3.0, released on 3 June 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.linuxfoundation.org/collaborate/workgroups/lsb/fhs-30 |title=FHS 3.0 Released |date=June 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Directory structure==
In the FHS, all files and [[directory (file systems)|directories]] appear under the [[root directory]] &lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt;, even if they are stored on different physical or virtual devices. Some of these directories only exist on a particular system if certain subsystems, such as the [[X Window System]], are installed.

Most of these directories exist in all [[Unix-like]] operating systems and are generally used in much the same way; however, the descriptions here are those used specifically for the FHS, and are not considered authoritative for platforms other than Linux.

There has been controversy over the meaning of the name itself. In early versions of the UNIX Implementation Document from Bell labs, &lt;code&gt;/etc&lt;/code&gt; is referred to as the ''[[et cetera|etcetera]] directory'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=J.

== FHS compliance ==
Most [[Linux distribution]]s follow the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard and declare it their own policy to maintain FHS compliance.&lt;ref&gt;[[Red Hat]] reference guide on [https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/7/html-single/Storage_Administration_Guide/index.html#s1-filesystem-fhs file system structure]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[SuSE Linux]] Enterprise Server Administration, Novell authorized courseware, by Jason W.

September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; provide examples of intentionally non-compliant filesystem implementations.

Some distributions generally follow the standard but deviate from it in some areas. Common deviations include:
* Modern Linux distributions include a &lt;code&gt;/sys&lt;/code&gt; directory as a [[virtual filesystem]] ([[sysfs]], comparable to &lt;code&gt;/proc&lt;/code&gt;, which is a [[procfs]]), which stores and allows modification of the devices connected to the system,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=5.3 About the /sys Virtual File System|url=http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E37670_01/E41138/html/ol_sysfs.html|website=docs.oracle.com|publisher=Oracle|accessdate=8 July 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160708193213/https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E37670_01/E41138/html/ol_sysfs.html|archivedate=8 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas many traditional [[Unix-like]] operating systems use &lt;code&gt;/sys&lt;/code&gt; as a [[symbolic link]] to the [[Kernel (computing)|kernel]] source tree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lehey|first1=Greg|title=The Complete FreeBSD: Documentation from the Source|date=May 2003|publisher=O'Reilly Media, Incorporated|isbn=9780596005160|pages=188, 609|edition=Fourth|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7Y5kfaRmtKUC|accessdate=8 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Many modern Unix-like systems (like [[FreeBSD]] via its [[FreeBSD Ports|ports]] system) install third party packages into &lt;code&gt;/usr/local&lt;/code&gt; while keeping code considered part of the operating system in &lt;code&gt;/usr&lt;/code&gt;.
* Some Linux distributions no longer differentiate between &lt;code&gt;/lib&lt;/code&gt; versus &lt;code&gt;/usr/lib&lt;/code&gt; and have &lt;code&gt;/lib&lt;/code&gt; symlinked to &lt;code&gt;/usr/lib&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Allan McRae|title=Arch Linux - News: The /lib directory becomes a symlink|url=https://www.archlinux.org/news/the-lib-directory-becomes-a-symlink/|website=archlinux.org|accessdate=28 December 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140909234433/https://www.archlinux.org/news/the-lib-directory-becomes-a-symlink/|archivedate=9 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Some Linux distributions no longer differentiate between &lt;code&gt;/bin&lt;/code&gt; versus &lt;code&gt;/usr/bin&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;/sbin&lt;/code&gt; versus &lt;code&gt;/usr/sbin&lt;/code&gt;. They may symlink &lt;code&gt;/bin&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;/usr/bin&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;/sbin&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;/usr/sbin&lt;/code&gt;. Other distributions choose to consolidate all four, symlinking them to &lt;code&gt;/usr/bin&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Allan McRae|title=Arch Linux - News: Binaries move to /usr/bin requiring update intervention|url=https://www.archlinux.org/news/binaries-move-to-usrbin-requiring-update-intervention/|website=archlinux.org|accessdate=28 December 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140910093202/https://www.archlinux.org/news/binaries-move-to-usrbin-requiring-update-intervention/|archivedate=10 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern Linux distributions include a &lt;code&gt;/run&lt;/code&gt; directory as a [[temporary filesystem]] ([[tmpfs]]) which stores volatile runtime data, following the FHS version 3.0. According to the FHS version 2.3, such data were stored in &lt;code&gt;/var/run&lt;/code&gt; but this was a problem in some cases because this directory is not always available at early boot. As a result, these programs have had to resort to trickery, such as using &lt;code&gt;/dev/.udev&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;/dev/.mdadm&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;/dev/.systemd&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;/dev/.mount&lt;/code&gt; directories, even though the device directory isn't intended for such data.&lt;ref&gt;https://lwn.net/Articles/436012/&lt;/ref&gt; Among other advantages, this makes the system easier to use normally with the root filesystem mounted read-only.
For example, below are the changes [[Debian]] made in its 2013 Wheezy release:&lt;ref&gt;http://wiki.debian.org/ReleaseGoals/RunDirectory&lt;/ref&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;/dev/.*&lt;/code&gt; → &lt;code&gt;/run/*&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;/dev/shm&lt;/code&gt; → &lt;code&gt;/run/shm&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;/dev/shm/*&lt;/code&gt; → &lt;code&gt;/run/*&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;/etc/*&lt;/code&gt; (writeable files) → &lt;code&gt;/run/* &lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;/lib/init/rw&lt;/code&gt; → &lt;code&gt;/run&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;/var/lock&lt;/code&gt; → &lt;code&gt;/run/lock&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;/var/run&lt;/code&gt; → &lt;code&gt;/run&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;/tmp&lt;/code&gt; → &lt;code&gt;/run/tmp&lt;/code&gt;

== History ==
FHS was created as the FSSTND (short for "Filesystem Standard"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/docs/fsstnd/old/FSSTND-FAQ |title=FSSTND FAQ page |accessdate=2016-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;), largely based on similar standards for other [[Unix-like]] operating systems.  Notable examples are these: the &lt;tt&gt;hier(7)&lt;/tt&gt; description of file system layout,&lt;ref&gt;{{man|7|hier|FreeBSD}}&lt;/ref&gt; which has existed since the release of [[Version 7 Unix]] (in 1979); the [[SunOS]] &lt;tt&gt;filesystem(7)&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=filesystem&amp;manpath=SunOS+4.1.3 SunOS 4.1.3 manual page for filesystem(7)], dated 10 January 1988 (from the FreeBSD Man Pages library)&lt;/ref&gt; and its successor, the [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]] &lt;tt&gt;filesystem(5)&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{man|5|filesystem|Solaris}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://manpages.unixforum.co.uk/man-pages/unix/solaris-10-11_06/5/filesystem-man-page.html |title=filesystem man page - Solaris 10 11/06 Man Pages |accessdate=2011-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7068">The '''Fordham Francis Index''' (Full Name: [[Fordham University]]'s [[Pope Francis]] Global [[Poverty Index]]) is a multidimensional measure of international [[poverty]]. It is a simple tool that relies on seven primary indicators which are categorized into a Material Well-being Index and a Spiritual Well-being Index. It was launched on September 23, 2016 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ipednews.blog.fordham.edu/?p=1848 |title=Fordham IPED Students Launch Fordham’s Pope Francis Global Poverty Index (FFI) &amp;#124; FORDHAM &amp;#124;IPED |website=Ipednews.blog.fordham.edu |date=2016-06-07 |accessdate=2017-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; at a Fordham conference entitled ''Pope Francis' Call for Escaping Poverty''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Awad |first=Mary |url=http://news.fordham.edu/inside-fordham-category/student-research-inspired-by-pope-presented-at-national-conference/ |title=Fordham Students Launch Poverty Index Inspired by Pope Francis |website=News.fordham.edu |date=2016-09-26 |accessdate=2017-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; co-sponsored by the Vatican Foundation ''[[Centesimus Annus Pro Pontifice]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.centesimusannus.org/site/index.php?lingua=2 |title=Corsi in dottrina sociale della chiesa |language=it |publisher=Centesimus Annus |date= |accessdate=2017-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The research was conducted by students from Fordham's Graduate Program in International Political Economy and Development(IPED),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://iped.fordham.edu |title=Graduate Program in International Political Economy and Development &amp;#124; Fordham |website=Iped.fordham.edu |date= |accessdate=2017-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  under the research direction of Dr. Henry Schwalbenberg. The Fordham Francis Index is a response to the [[Pope]]'s Address to the [[United Nations]] in New York last September 25, 2015.&lt;ref name="vatican1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://w2.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/speeches/2015/september/documents/papa-francesco_20150925_onu-visita.html |title=Apostolic Journey - United Nations: Meeting with the members of the General Assembly of the United Nations Organization (New York, 25 September 2015) &amp;#124; Francis |website=W2.vatican.va |date= |accessdate=2017-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

==Origin==
Pope Francis’ Address to the United Nations was part of his apostolic journey to Cuba, the United States of America and to the United Nations Organization Headquarters on the occasion of his participation at the ''Eighth World Meeting of Families'' in Philadelphia from 19–28 September 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://w2.vatican.va/content/francesco/it/travels/2015/outside/documents/papa-francesco-cuba-usa-onu-2015.html |title=Viaggio Apostolico del Santo Padre a Cuba, negli Stati Uniti d'America e Visita alla Sede dell'Organizzazione delle Nazioni Unite (19-28 settembre 2015) &amp;#124; Francesco |website=W2.vatican.va |date=2015-09-19 |accessdate=2017-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
 
In his speech at the UN, he stated that: &lt;blockquote&gt;“the simplest and best measure and indicator of the implementation of the new Agenda for Development will be effective, practical and immediate access, on the part of all, to essential material and spiritual goods: housing, dignified and properly remunerated employment, adequate food and drinking water; religious freedom and, more generally, spiritual freedom and education. These pillars of integral human development have a common foundation, which is the right to life and, more generally, what we could call the right to existence of human nature itself.”&lt;ref name="vatican1"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

==Fordham Francis Index Construction==
The Fordham Francis Index is a broad measure of global poverty - it is based on a small number of indicators that are strongly correlated with many aspects of development and can therefore serve as a proxy for overall success in achieving the UN's [[Sustainable Development Goals]]. It is also an innovative measure of human well-being since it explicitly attempts to measure spiritual welfare.&lt;br /&gt;

Selection of these well-being indicators took into consideration availability of data for many countries, credibility of the data source, and the breadth of its measure. These 7 primary indicators are categorized into two areas: Material Well-being and Spiritual Well-being.

===Material Well-being Components===
      * '''Water''' – the percentage of a population using an improved drinking water source&lt;ref&gt;https://washdata.org/&lt;/ref&gt;
      * '''Food''' – the prevalence of undernourishment&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/FS&lt;/ref&gt;
      * '''Housing''' – access to adequate flooring&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ophi.org.uk/multidimensional-poverty-index/mpi-resources/#2014&lt;/ref&gt;
      * '''Employment''' – unemployment rate&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SL.UEM.TOTL.ZS |title=Unemployment, total (% of total labor force) (modeled ILO estimate) &amp;#124; Data |website=Data.worldbank.org |date= |accessdate=2017-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spiritual Well-being Components===
      * '''Education''' – Adult literacy rates&lt;ref name="unesco1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uis.unesco.org/Library/Documents/eiguide09-en.pdf |title=Microsoft Word - indicator definitions_Edited_En_REV_Redouane.doc |website=Uis.unesco.org |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2017-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;
      * '''Gender equity''' – Female acceptance of domestic violence&lt;ref&gt;- https://data.oecd.org/inequality/violence-against-women.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
      * '''Religious Freedom''' – Government Restrictions Index&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewforum.org/2009/12/17/government-restrictions-index-gri/ |title=Government Restrictions Index (GRI) &amp;#124; Pew Research Center |website=Pewforum.org |date=2009-12-17 |accessdate=2017-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methodology==
The approach to computing the Fordham Francis Index is identical to the methodology employed by the [[United Nations Development Program]] (UNDP) in their calculation of the [[Human Development Index]] (HDI). Using the same methodology means that any differences between the two indices are solely attributed to substantive differences in their components. The Fordham Francis Index is an equally weighted [[geometric mean]] of Material Index and Spiritual Index.&lt;br /&gt;

The Material Index and Spiritual Index are also equally weighted geometric means of the standardized value of their primary indicators. To achieve this, the primary indicators were transformed into standardized formula so that they each yielded indices with values between 0 and 1. Measures of food, employment and religious freedom were inverted so that for all seven measures a higher number would represent a more desirable outcome.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;math&gt;Primary Indicator Score=  \frac{(Actual value-Minimum Theoretical Value of Statistic)}{(Maximum Value of Statistic-Minimum Theoretical Value of Statistic)}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

[[File:John Gordon Lorimer.jpg|thumbnail|[[John Gordon Lorimer (1870-1914)|John Gordon Lorimer]]]]
The '''''Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf, Oman and Central Arabia''''' (nicknamed '''''Lorimer''''')&lt;ref name=QDL/&gt; is a two-volume [[encyclopedia]] compiled by [[John Gordon Lorimer (1870-1914)|John Gordon Lorimer]]. The ''Gazetteer'' was published in secret by the [[British Raj|British government in India]] in 1908 and 1915 and it served as a handbook for British diplomats in the [[Arabian Peninsula]] and [[Persia]].&lt;ref name=CAE&gt;{{cite web|title=Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf, Oman and Central Arabia|url=http://archiveeditions.co.uk/titledetails.asp?tid=2|website=Cambridge Archive Editions|accessdate=10 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The work was declassified in 1955 under the [[Thirty-year rule#United Kingdom|fifty-year rule]], and was widely praised for its extensive coverage of the region's history and geography.&lt;ref name=QDL&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lowe|first1=Daniel A.|title=‘Persian Gulf Tragedy’: the Death and Legacy of John Gordon Lorimer|url=http://www.qdl.qa/en/%E2%80%98persian-gulf-tragedy%E2%80%99-death-and-legacy-john-gordon-lorimer|website=Qatar Digital Library|accessdate=10 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is considered to be "the most important single source of historical material on the [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf|Gulf States]] and [[Saudi Arabia]]" from the 17th to early 20th century.&lt;ref name=CAE/&gt;

==Background==
Beginning in the 20th century, the [[British Empire]] sought to strengthen its connections to British-controlled [[India]] which in turn resulted in a greater interest in the [[Persian Gulf]] region, culminating in the visit of the [[Viceroy of India]] [[Lord Curzon]] to the Gulf in 1903.&lt;ref name=CAE/&gt; To ensure that British agents in the region were adequately informed and prepared to strengthen their influence in the region, a light-weight and easily accessible handbook was needed.&lt;ref name=Leech&gt;{{cite news|last1=Leech|first1=Nick|title=A reference book for every historian to rely on|url=http://www.thenational.ae/news/uae-news/heritage/a-reference-book-for-every-historian-to-rely-on|accessdate=10 August 2015|agency=The National|date=7 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1903, the British authorities commissioned John Gordon Lorimer, a member of the [[Indian Civil Service]] serving in the [[North-West Frontier Province (1901–55)|North-West Frontier Province]], to compile such a document. Lorimer was initially given six months to accomplish the task, but repeatedly insisted on being granted more time to ensure the work was completed thoroughly. Placed under special duty and with a team of researchers, over the next 10 years data was collated from government archives in [[Calcutta]] and [[Bombay]], and from multiple field expeditions to the Gulf.&lt;ref name=CAE/&gt;

==Contents==
The gazetteer is a 5000-page document divided into two volumes; the first details the region's history and the second details its geography.&lt;ref name=CAE/&gt; The geography portion of the gazetteer was completed first and was published in 1908. The history portion of the gazetteer was only completed and published in 1915, one year after Lorimer himself died in a shooting accident.&lt;ref name=CAE/&gt;

===History===
Titled "History, geography and genealogy", the volume was split into three sections which were divided by ethnicity. Section 1 (the Arab section) was dedicated to the history of the Persian Gulf, central [[Arabia]] and [[Ottoman Iraq]]. Section 2 (the Persian section) regarded the history of Persia with particular reference to the predominantly-Arab populated region of [[Khuzestan|Arabistan]]. Section 3 consisted of 19 genealogical charts pertaining to the ruling families of the region.&lt;ref name=Lowe/&gt; The research was compiled from Lorimer's own notes and the work of colleagues such as [[J.A. Saldanha]] and [[C.H. Gabriel]] and ranged from the 17th to the 20th centuries.&lt;ref name=CAE/&gt;

[[File:Persian_Gulf,_Oman_and_Central_Arabia_map_by_F.F._Hunder_1905_(retouched).jpg|thumb|Map of the Persian Gulf, from the gazetteer.]]

===Geography===
Titled the "Geographical and Statistical" section, this is a 2000-page document and lists an extensive alphabetical arrangement of tribes and settlements across the region, divided into different countries.&lt;ref name=Lowe/&gt; The data was obtained through research missions carried out by Lorimer and his group.&lt;ref name=CAE/&gt; Also in the volume are 56 reproduced images of the region taken from colonial records and two maps showing the distribution of pearling sites and the overall political geography.&lt;ref name=Lowe/&gt;

==Reception and legacy==
Classified ''for official use only'', the gazetteer was published in secrecy in 1908 and 1915 respectively with only dozens of copies in circulation. As such, there was no public awareness of the existence of the work. Consequently, Lorimer's obituary makes no mention of the gazetteer.&lt;ref name=QDL/&gt; He was credited as the author only when the work was declassified in 1955.&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite news|last1=Teller|first1=Matthew|title=The diplomat’s portable handbook (wheelbarrow required)|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-magazine-monitor-30344377|accessdate=10 August 2015|agency=BBC News|date=6 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1971, ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]'' praised the historical coverage of the work as "stupendous" and its geographical section as "without modern substitute". The gazetteer, although drawn from British sources and written from a British perspective, is still regarded as a valuable resource for the serious researcher.&lt;ref name=CAE/&gt;

The gazetteer was digitised and made available online by the [[Qatar Digital Library]] in January 2015.&lt;ref name=Lowe&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lowe|first1=Daniel|title=Colonial Knowledge: Lorimer’s Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf, Oman and Central Arabia|url=http://britishlibrary.typepad.co.uk/untoldlives/2015/01/colonial-knowledge-lorimers-gazetteer-of-the-persian-gulf-oman-and-central-arabia.html|publisher=Qatar Digital Library|accessdate=10 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6815">The '''Generally Accepted Recordkeeping Principles''' (The Principles), were created by [[ARMA International]] as a common set of principles that describe the conditions under which [[business records]] and related information should be maintained.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arma.org/principles&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Principles==
The eight principles are designed to identify the major hallmarks of effective [[Information governance]], but do not follow a numerical hierarchy of importance.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arma.org/principles&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Principle of Accountability'''
* '''Principle of Transparency'''
* '''Principle of Integrity'''
* '''Principle of Protection'''
* '''Principle of Compliance'''
* '''Principle of Availability'''
* '''Principle of Retention'''
* '''Principle of Disposition'''

The list of principles can be recalled with the help of the [[Mnemonic]] "A TIP CARD," which serves a dual purpose as it implies the principles are tips for effective recordkeeping.

==ARMA International Maturity Model for Information Governance==

Information is one of the most vital, strategic assets organizations possess. They depend on information to develop products and services, make critical strategic decisions, protect property rights, propel marketing, manage projects, process transactions, service customers, and generate revenues. This critical information is contained in the organizations' business records. 
It has not always been easy to describe what "good recordkeeping" looks like. Yet, this question gains in importance as regulators, shareholders, and customers are increasingly concerned about the business practices of organizations.

ARMA International recognized that a clear statement of "Generally Accepted Recordkeeping Principles®" (The Principles) would guide:

* CEOs in determining how to protect their organizations in the use of information assets; 
* Legislators in crafting legislation meant to hold organizations accountable; and 
* Records management professionals in designing comprehensive and effective records management programs.

The principles identify the critical hallmarks of information governance, which Gartner describes as an accountability framework that "includes the processes, roles, standards, and metrics that ensure the effective and efficient use of information in enabling an organization to achieve its goals." As such, they apply to all sizes of organizations, in all types of industries, and in both the private and public sectors. Multi-national organizations can also use the Principles to establish consistent practices across a variety of business units.

===A Picture of Effective Information Governance===

The Maturity Model for Information Governance&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arma.org/gprinciples&lt;/ref&gt; begins to paint a more complete picture of what effective information governance looks like. It is based on the eight principles as well as a foundation of standards, best practices, and legal/regulatory requirements. The maturity model goes beyond a mere statement of the principles by beginning to define characteristics of various levels of recordkeeping programs. For each principle, the maturity model associates various characteristics that are typical for each of the five levels in the model:

* Level 1 (Sub-standard): This level describes an environment where recordkeeping concerns are either not addressed at all, or are addressed in a very ad hoc manner. Organizations that identify primarily with these descriptions should be concerned that their programs will not meet legal or regulatory scrutiny. 
* Level 2 (In Development): This level describes an environment where there is a developing recognition that recordkeeping affects the organization, and that the organization may benefit from a more defined information governance program. However, in Level 2, the organization is still vulnerable to legal or regulatory scrutiny since practices are ill-defined and still largely ad hoc in nature. 
* Level 3 (Essential): This level describes the essential or minimum requirements that must be addressed in order to meet the organization's legal and regulatory requirements. Level 3 is characterized by defined policies and procedures, and more specific decisions taken to improve recordkeeping. However, organizations that identify primarily with Level 3 descriptions may still be missing significant opportunities for streamlining business and controlling costs. 
* Level 4 (Proactive): This level describes an organization that is initiating information governance program improvements throughout its business operations. Information governance issues and considerations are integrated into business decisions on a routine basis, and the organization easily meets its legal and regulatory requirements. Organizations that identify primarily with these descriptions should begin to consider the business benefits of information availability in transforming their organizations globally. 
* Level 5 (Transformational): This level describes an organization that has integrated information governance into its overall corporate infrastructure and business processes to such an extent that compliance with the program requirements is routine. These organizations have recognized that effective information governance plays a critical role in cost containment, competitive advantage, and client service.

===How to Use the Maturity Model===

The Information Governance Maturity Model will assist an organization in conducting a preliminary evaluation of its recordkeeping programs and practices. Thoughtful consideration of the organization's practices should allow users to make an initial determination of the maturity of their organization’s information governance. Initially, it is not unusual for an organization to be at differing levels of maturity for the eight principles. It is also important to note that the maturity model represents an initial evaluation. In order to be most effective, a more in-depth analysis of organizational policies and practices may be necessary.

The maturity model will be most useful to leaders who wish to achieve the maximum benefit from their information governance practices. Effective information governance requires a continuous focus. But in order to get started, organizations can look to the steps below:

* Identify the gaps between the organization's current practices and the desirable level of maturity for each principle. 
* Assess the risk(s) to the organization, based on the biggest gaps. 
* Determine whether additional information and analysis is necessary. 
* Develop priorities and assign accountability for further development of the program.

On 12 July 1213, [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor]] made a [[Golden Bull]] by which Frederick offered his obedience to the [[Pope]] and pledged himself to the principle of free canonical elections by the chapters, unhampered liberty of appeal to Rome on ecclesiastical issues, and abandonment of the traditional rights of the Crown to the personal estate of deceased bishops (''Spolienrecht'') and the Revenues of vacant sees (''Regalienrecht'').&lt;ref&gt;Leeper 1941 pp. 297&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Good Apollo, I'm Burning Star IV, Volume One: From Fear Through the Eyes of Madness''''' is a [[graphic novel]] released in September of [[2005 in comics|2005]] along with the [[Coheed and Cambria]] [[Good Apollo, I'm Burning Star IV, Volume One: From Fear Through the Eyes of Madness|album of the same name]].  It is written by [[Claudio Sanchez]], illustrated by Christopher Shy, and published by [[Evil Ink Comics]]

==Plot==

The story of Good Apollo takes a step outside the [[science fiction]] [[narrative]] of the first three chapters and examines the life of the Writer, a character who is crafting the lives of the [[protagonist]] Claudio and his companions in the form of a fictional story.  The [[graphic novel]] alternates between the two different worlds of Claudio the Writer and Claudio the Character, which can be confusing for one unacquainted with the concept as the Writer and Character are similar in appearance.

The novel opens with a dream taking place in the mind of Claudio the Character, in which he sits in priest's garb in the Writer's study looking upon the phrase "God Only Knows" scrawled in front of him in blood (a line repeated in the song "Mother May I").  He is approached by several skeletal figures begging for Claudio to save them.  As their protests become more emphatic and they begin to overwhelm Claudio, he realizes he is dreaming and forces himself to awaken by stabbing himself in the hand with a screwdriver.  Aboard his uncle Jesse's ship, the Grail Arbor, he explains the dreams to Jesse and his daughter Chase as the enslaved souls of the Keywork pleading for liberation.  Jesse and Chase (who appears to have some [[prophetic]] power) believe the only way to free them is by destroying Heaven's Fence and that Claudio is a [[messiah]]-like figure called the Crowing who has the power to do this.  Claudio, however, is having trouble accepting this daunting role.

The novel's focus now shifts to the Writer, who resides in Rockland County, [[New York (state)|New York]].  He is haunted by memories of a former lover, Erica Court, who had been unfaithful.  The Writer suffers a series of delusions involving the death of Erica at his hands.  These visions make up the song "[[Welcome Home (Coheed and Cambria song)|Welcome Home]]" on the Good Apollo album.  Suddenly, the Writer's window is broken and then someone apparently steals his ten-speed bicycle.  As the Writer walks off to investigate, the novel re-enters the story with an exchange between the story's villains, Supreme Tri-Mage Wilhelm Ryan and his General, Mayo Deftinwolf, in which they vaguely speak of Claudio's role as the Crowing and their plans to crush him and the rebellion his uncle Jesse has been leading against the Mages of Heaven's Fence.  Back aboard the Grail Arbor, Claudio is awakened from a nightmare about his lost family by the Prise Ambellina.  They discuss a plan formulated by Jesse to penetrate the defenses of Apity Prime, a planet in the Omega star system, by landing in the city of Kalline, which is adjacent to Wilhem's lair, the House Atlantic.  Claudio needs to get there to fulfill his destiny as the Crowing, however he points out that the opening in the defenses is likely a trap and argues further with Chase and Ambellina about his role, which he still doubts.  Jesse explains the plan to the pilot of the Grail Arbor, who also expresses doubts, and the group prepares for the final assault on the forces of Wilhelm Ryan.

&lt;!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:Tenspeed card.jpg|right|thumb|Ten Speed convinces the Writer to kill Ambellina]] --&gt;
In the Writer's world, he has wandered off into deeper [[hallucinations]], arriving at the house of Newo Ikkin, a fictional character from his story and his character's former love interest, and witnessing Claudio the character speak to Newo's dog Apollo, as he had written in his story before (Claudio utters the phrase "Good Apollo, where shall I begin?"  At the end of the first track on [[In Keeping Secrets of Silent Earth: 3]], The Ring In Return, one can hear a voice quietly saying "Hello Apollo.  Where shall I begin?"  It's believed the slight differentiation was accidental).  In Newo's place is Erica Court, and the Writer's bicycle has taken on a demonic persona, Ten Speed of God's Blood and Burial, and begins speaking with him.  The Writer is seeking a way to end the story, which Ten Speed claims he can provide if he kills Ambellina (though the Writer thinks Ten Speed wants him to kill Erica).  Exact quotes of their bickering can be heard during part of the song, "[[Ten Speed (Of God's Blood and Burial)]]," from the Good Apollo album.  The exchange ends with Claudio saying "You say a lot of things.  And how's that work?  You're a bicycle."

Meanwhile, a rebel strike team has disabled the generator on Kalline, allowing the Grail Arbor to land.  Mayo springs his trap, destroying the strike force by unleashing one of the beast-like Priests upon them.  As the Arbor prepares to land, more of the Writer's delusions are portrayed, including Erica's murder at the hands of the Writer using the same poison Mayo gave to Coheed to kill his children in the Second Stage Turbine Blade.  This delusion makes up the song "Once Upon Your Dead Body" on the Good Apollo album.  While Mayo prepares for the rebel's ground assault, Ten Speed explains that he doesn't actually want the Writer to murder Erica, but rather to exact his vengeance metaphorically by killing Ambellina, who represents Erica's good side in the story, which will in turn cause Claudio to accept his destiny as the Crowing and destroy the Keywork; an ending for the story.

Mayo's trap comes to full fruition as a planetary defense cannon called a Jackhammer is fired into the Grail Arbor when it tries to land, damaging it.  The Arbor retreats while Claudio, Ambellina, Jesse, Chase, and Jesse's other IRO-bot children abandon ship and land on the surface of Apity Prime.  Ambellina and Claudio split off from the group while Jesse and his children stay behind to confront Mayo.  As Ten Speed and the Writer further argue about the fate of Ambellina, Jesse delivers a final goodbye to his children who proceed to mutate into monstrous forms and attack Mayo's forces.  Jesse confronts Mayo and is killed by him in hand-to-hand combat when Mayo rips Jesse's heart out of his body.

Claudio and Ambellina arrive at a mirror (the Willing Well) in which they can see the Writer's argument with Ten Speed take place. Claudio and Ambellina then combat a Priest in front of the mirror, resulting in Ambellina being injured. As the battle takes place, the Writer is swept further into his delusion by the skeletal figures the Character dreamt of earlier, who, apparently at the behest of a hallucinated Erica Court, take him to a large, winged [[guillotine]] and have him beheaded. Erica hauntingly says "This is no beginning. This is the final cut"—a phrase repeated as the chorus of the song "The Willing Well IV: The Final Cut" on the Good Apollo album. The Writer awakens from this delusion, once again finding himself at the house of Newo Ikkin, and decides to take Ten Speed's advice.  Passing through the mirror into his own story, the Writer sees Claudio has made the transformation into his powerful role as the Crowing after witnessing Ambellina's injury at the hands of the Priest. Ignoring the Writer's command to stop, Claudio kills the Priest and proceeds to confront the Writer.  The Writer explains he must kill Ambellina for his own peace of mind, so that the story may have an ending. The Crowing furiously declares, "My God is a coward!" The Writer kills Ambellina, easily overwhelming Claudio's resistance despite his newfound power as the Crowing. As Ambellina dies in Claudio's arms, she professes that she would have loved Claudio had she been able. The Writer walks off into the distance with his bicycle, leaving Claudio with the cryptic message "You're Burning Star IV." He also tells Claudio to listen to the Vishual (Chase) and that "all worlds from here must burn," implying that it is the Crowing's duty to destroy the Keywork.

The '''Grand Baoji Palace and Glazed Hall''' is an ancient historical temple, located in the east Baisha Street, more than 10&amp;nbsp;km north of the old [[Lijiang, Yunnan|Lijing]] city, [[Yunnan]] province, [[China]]. The two buildings faced each other in a distance of nearly 7 metres. The Grand Baoji Palace is a [[Tibet]]an [[Tangmi|Mizong]] temple while Glazed Hall is a hall of [[Chan Buddhism]]. Built in the late years of the [[Ming dynasty]],&lt;ref group=NB name="Ming Dynasty"&gt;a dynasty in China from 1388 to 1424&lt;/ref&gt; the Grand Baoji Palace is a thick-eave gabled building with steep house ridge and elegant structure. The rectangular palace has three rooms on each side. Twelve murals in the palace are considered the best works of the art of Lijiang murals. The contents of the paintings are various and complex, and they are the artistic reflection of different religions and cultures. The Glazed Hall was built between the reigns of the [[Hongwu Emperor]] and [[Yongle Emperor]] in the Ming dynasty. Facing the east, the rectangular Hall has three entrance gates and three main rooms. 21 murals in the main hall, painted during the reign of the Hongwu Emperor, are the earliest works of the ancient Lijiang murals.&lt;ref group=NB name="Lijiang murals"&gt;important relic under National Protection&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''InterCourses: An Aphrodisiac Cookbook''''' is a 1997 cookbook written&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]|url=https://www.motherjones.com/media/1997/09/hotmedia|title=HOT!media|date=September–October 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Martha Hopkins and Randall Lockridge&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=[[The Los Angeles Times]]|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1998/feb/18/food/fo-20201|title=Los Angeles Times Cookbook Hot List|date=February 18, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; with photography by Ben Fink, and published by Terrace Publishing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=InterCourses Authors|url=http://www.intercourses.com/authors.htm|work=InterCourses}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It focuses primarily on recipes and foods appropriate for romantic settings and seduction, covering traditionally [[sex]]ually-associated foods such as [[chocolate]], [[strawberry|strawberries]], [[oyster]]s, [[honey]], and [[avocado]]s, as well as less-traditional foods such as [[pine nut]]s, [[coffee]], and [[chile pepper|chile]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=InterCourses Aphrodisiacs|work=InterCourses|url=http://www.intercourses.com/aphrodisiacs.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The recipes are illustrated with numerous personal stories interviewed for each edition and extensive, non-explicit erotic photography.

According to the book's official website, at least 240,000 copies have been sold and the book was extensively reviewed in both editions by both print and electronic media.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

The book was followed by a sequel entitled ''[[The New InterCourses]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=[[Fox News]]|title=Top 10 sexy cookbooks|date=January 29, 2013|url=http://www.foxnews.com/leisure/2013/01/29/top-10-sexy-cookbooks/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Inventories''' are the one method that [[libraries]] use to determine whether some items in their collection are in need of [[Preservation (library and archival science)|preservation]] or conservation activities. A modern inventory might involve examining item by item with a [[barcode scanner]] and a laptop, with the objective of adjusting bibliographic and item records in theirs and [[OCLC]]'s [[WorldCat]] databases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt; Doing an annual (or less frequent) physical inventory with the laying on of hands on each individual item may not be practical for several reasons. It may not be financially feasible, employees required may not have extra time to devote to such an inventory, and there are no financial rewards for the Library for completing an inventory. Problems that are discovered (books in need of repurchase, rebinding, repair, or digitization) may require solutions that are expensive and labor-intensive.  Because of these restraints, inventories may not take place for decades, if ever, at large academic institutions. By contrast, complete inventories are often a regular part of the [[teacher-librarian|school library media specialist]]'s job at [[K-12]] institutions, where inventory may be a legal requirement that shows that the libraries are accountable for the money they have spent throughout the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==The role of inventories==
Although [[collection development|collecting]] new materials is viewed as a central mission of the library, maintaining the condition of library collections, which includes less satisfactory activities such as [[Weeding (library)|weeding]], [[book repair]], shifting and counting what libraries think they have on their shelves, are also a vital part of the library's mission to provide access to current patrons, as well as those people who will use the library at some point in the future.

Inventories help guarantee that the collections as listed in [[Online public access catalog]]s and [[Finding aid]]s do not lack integrity.  School libraries also use the inventory to assess the collection (numbers, age and ratio:student) against benchmarks of accrediting institutions, and also to examine each resource and determine its future in the collection based on age, relevance, currency and condition—which may include repair, replacement, disposal or cleaning to ensure that attractive, up-to-date resources are available for patrons.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid. Braxton''&lt;/ref&gt;  Inventory can also identify anomalies in the catalog and provide an opportunity to correct catalog records and labeling of items.  This is also a time when shelves can be rearranged to minimize overcrowding to prevent damage.

==Sampling==

[[Sampling (statistics)|Sampling]] is a compromise measure, which can be an important management tool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt; Random sampling of library collections can give a quick and clear assessment measure of a collection — whether the books are present, and whether those books present are in good physical condition.  In 1982, the California State University libraries, suggested inventory procedures to insure that the 19 campus collections were secure and intact.  They recognized that a complete regular inventory was too expensive, and decided that the best method of assessing book loss would be to use sampling.  Every three years, a sample was to be taken of an identified number of items in each Library of Congress letter [[Library of Congress Classification|classification]].  If loss rates were more than 1% for two years in a row, this would indicate that a full inventory was needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt;

"A random sampling of the collection serves as an indicator for the rest of the collection. If all the items are accounted for in a random sampling, then it can be assumed that rest of the collections' records is just as reliable. However, a complete inventory provides the institution with the knowledge that the entire collection can be accounted for; the random sampling is used to check the consistency of the collections' records."&lt;ref&gt;[[Inventory (museum)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Determining the sample size and items===

First, it must be determined if the entire collection, including stacks, reference and special collections will be sampled together or if just a particular area will be analyzed.  At the University of Illinois, their bookstacks included government publications and the Asian library, but these special holdings were not included in their study.   Unbound items may also be excluded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt;

Next, the Library needs to decide upon the size of its sample.  More datapoints, of course result in more accurate data about the collection.  There are two types of errors possible in sampling: tolerance and confidence.  Tolerance  is the unexact percentage, a maximum deviation from the nominal error value, for example, a survey question may be accurate for 85-95% of the population, it could also be stated 90% ±5; in this case, the tolerance is five.  Confidence is the second error, measuring the certainty of a true answer within the limits stated in the tolerance.  If there is a 90 per cent confidence, it is predicted that if the sample study is repeated ten times using different samples, but with the same tolerance, then the results would be accurate for nine of those studies out of ten.&lt;ref&gt;''ibid. Drott''&lt;/ref&gt;

In the table below, for a tolerance of ±5%, the sample sizes for a collection of more than 50,000 books would be 381 items for 95% confidence, and 648 items for 99% confidence.  To achieve a lower tolerance of ±1% one would have to sample thousands of books, which might stretch the resources available for even a sample inventory.  Surveying 270 to 655 volumes is much more reasonable for the average-sized library staff.

[[File:LibraryInventorySamplingSizeBasedOnCollectionSize.jpg]]

An alternative for counting hundreds of books in a given random sample is to count until you know that you do or do not have a problem.  The Prescott Memorial Library at [[Louisiana Tech]] employed [[sequential analysis]] in the late 1980s when working on automation of the collections.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid. DiCarlo''&lt;/ref&gt;

Random selection of the books can take place in a couple of different ways.  If in addition to the physical condition of items, a library also wants to know whether items are missing from shelves, random samples should be generated from the library's [[integrated library system]] (ILS).  If librarians are just accessing the collection for preservation purposes, they can easily count ranges, columns, shelves and books &lt;ref name="IbidChrzastowski"&gt;''Ibid. Chrzastowski''&lt;/ref&gt; and use [[Microsoft Excel]] or other spreadsheet software to create [[random sample]]s.  It should be noted, however, that misplacement of books on shelves does have associated costs—in the patron's satisfaction with the library's services and in staff time trying to locate missing books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt; It may be well worth the extra time to figure out how to extract random items from your library's ILS to complete your sample.

===Management of sampling surveys===

Once librarians are laying hands on individual books in their sample, what do they look for?  They should check the cover of the book for discoloration, peeling, damage.  Then they should open the book and look at the pages of the text—are they yellowing, brittle?  An archival marking pen may be used to determine whether a book is acidic.  How is the binding?  Are the pages intact?  This data can be recorded in a spreadsheet for use of later analysis of the entire sample.  Include the item's call number,  place of publication, place of production, publication date, measurements (spine height, cover width, depth of back to front cover, the amount of shelving space surrounding the item, horizontally and vertically); describe the case style, leaf attachment and binding condition, text attachment, acidity, paper strength, and text contrast ; list the damaged pages and describe the enclosure type and condition; record any additional notes that will be useful for future reference and analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;

Costs for sampling 384 random items at the [[Uiuc|University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]] in 1987 were less than $5000. The UIUC Library employed eleven graduate students from the school of library and information science, who received training and supervision.  Each surveyor collected forty samples, 90% of the surveys were completed on the first day in 5.5 survey hours.&lt;ref name="IbidChrzastowski" /&gt;

===Analysis of results===

Information from samples can easily be recorded in Excel or some other spreadsheet program, where simple analysis can be performed.  For preservation purposes, librarians want to know the condition of their collections: what percentage of the books are acidic?  What percentage of the collection is damaged?  Does more damage take place on cramped shelves?  Does the library need to be concerned with books printed in Eastern Europe?  Etc.  After identifying the issues of primary concern in the collection, preservation measures should be considered.  What needs to happen as soon as possible to preserve the collection?  What choices can be delayed for some time?  Does the library have a preservation plan in its collection management policy?  Is there a budget for maintaining the collections?  What can be extrapolated from the data about what might happen to the collection in ten to twenty years?

Using the results of the library's collection assessment, budgetary requests can be substantiated by data.  The library needs an increase in budget to care for aging collections, or the library needs an increase in funding to add new materials for our students to meet deficiencies and weaknesses.  This strategy was employed by the Joyner Library at [[East Carolina University]] after an inventory and shelf-analysis project in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other uses of sampling in library collection management===

Sampling can also be used to calculate optimum intervals for shelf reading.  Average misplacement of books on a shelf in a university library is 5.6%.  65 percent of the books were located on the correct shelf, but not in the right order.   Cooper and Wolthausen developed equations indicating that the optimal shelf-reading interval is a function of the number of books in a section, the likelihood that a book in one section will migrate to another, checking and users costs, and the error rate of the shelf reader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

In '''''Keesoopersandh v Essop''''' (1970), an important case in the South African law of lease, the relationship which arises between the lessee and the purchaser, who are bound by the rule ''huur gaat voor koop'', is such that such purchaser cannot be regarded as a third party as contemplated by section 2 of the General Law Amendment Act of 1956. The scope of the rule ''huur gaat voor koop'' and the proviso to section 2 of the GLAA were fully discussed, and the decision in the Natal Provincial Division reversed.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="44089">A '''lightweight markup language''' ('''LML'''), also termed a '''simple''' or '''humane markup language''', is a [[markup language]] with simple, unobtrusive [[syntax (programming languages)|syntax]]. It is designed to be easy to write using any generic [[text editor]] and easy to read in its raw form.  Lightweight markup languages are used in applications where it may be necessary to read the raw document as well as the final rendered output.

For instance, a person downloading a software library might prefer to read the documentation in a text editor rather than a web browser.  Another application for such languages is to provide for data entry in [[web publishing|web-based publishing]], such as [[weblog]]s and [[wiki]]s, where the input interface is a simple [[text box]].  The server software then converts the input into a common [[document markup language]] like [[HTML]].

== History ==
Lightweight markup languages were originally used on text-only displays which could not display characters in [[italics]] or [[bold]], so informal methods to convey this information had to be developed. This formatting choice was naturally carried forth to plain-text email communications. [[text-based web browser|Console browsers]] may also resort to similar display conventions.

In 1986 international standard [[SGML]] provided facilities to define and parse lightweight markup languages using grammars and tag implication. The 1998 W3C [[XML]] is a profile of SGML that omits these facilities. However, no SGML [[Document type definition|DTD]] for any of the languages listed below is known.

== Types ==
Lightweight markup languages can be categorized by their tag types. Like HTML (&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;b&gt;'''bold'''&amp;lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt;), some languages use named elements that share a common format for start and end tags (e.g. [[BBCode]] &lt;code&gt;[b]'''bold'''[/b]&lt;/code&gt;), whereas proper lightweight markup languages are restricted to [[ASCII]]-only punctuation marks and other non-letter symbols for tags, but some also mix both styles (e.g. [[Textile (markup language)|Textile]] &lt;code&gt;bq. &lt;/code&gt;) or allow embedded HTML (e.g. [[Markdown]]), possibly extended with custom elements (e.g. [[MediaWiki#Markup|MediaWiki]] &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;ref&gt;'''source'''&amp;lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/code&gt;).

Most languages distinguish between markup for lines or blocks and for shorter spans of texts, but some only support inline markup.

Some markup languages are tailored for a specific purpose, such as documenting computer code (e.g. [[Plain Old Documentation|POD]], [[Ruby Document format|RD]]) or being converted to a certain output format (usually HTML) and nothing else, others are more general in application. This includes whether they are oriented on textual presentation or on data serialization.{{clarify|date=June 2014}}

Presentation oriented languages include [[AsciiDoc]], [[atx (markup language)|atx]], BBCode, [[Creole (markup)|Creole]], [[Crossmark]], [[Epytext]], [[Haml]], [[JsonML]], [[MakeDoc]], Markdown, [[Org-mode]], POD, [[reStructuredText|reST]], RD, [[Setext]], [[SiSU]], [[SPIP]], [[Xupl]], [[Texy!]], Textile, [[txt2tags]], [[UDO (markup language)|UDO]] and [[Wikitext]].

Data serialization oriented languages include [[Curl (programming language)|Curl]] (homoiconic, but also reads JSON; every object serializes), [[JSON]], [[OGDL]], and [[YAML]].

Markdown's own syntax does not support class attributes or id attributes; however, since Markdown supports the inclusion of native HTML code, these features can be implemented using direct HTML. (Some extensions may support these features.)

txt2tags' own syntax does not support class attributes or id attributes; however, since txt2tags supports inclusion of native HTML code in tagged areas, these features can be implemented using direct HTML when saving to an HTML target.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://txt2tags.org/userguide/TaggedTaggedLineTaggedArea.html#6_16 |title=Txt2tags User Guide | publisher=Txt2tags.org |date= |accessdate=2017-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Comparison of lightweight markup language syntax ==
Although usually documented as yielding italic and bold text, most lightweight markup processors output semantic HTML elements &lt;code&gt;em&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;strong&lt;/code&gt; instead. Monospaced text may either result in semantic &lt;code&gt;code&lt;/code&gt; or presentational &lt;code&gt;tt&lt;/code&gt; elements. Few languages make a distinction, e.g. Textile, or allow the user to configure the output easily, e.g. Texy.

LMLs sometimes differ for multi-word markup where some require the markup characters to replace the inter-word spaces (''infix'').
Some languages require a single character as prefix and suffix, other need doubled or even tripled ones or support both with slightly different meaning, e.g. different levels of emphasis.

=== Heading syntax ===

Headings are usually available in up to six levels, but the top one is often reserved to contain the same as the document title, which may be set externally. Some documentation may associate levels with divisional types, e.g. part, chapter, section, article or paragraph.

Most LMLs follow one of two styles for headings, either [[Setext]]-like underlines or [[atx (markup language)|atx]]-like&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaronsw.com/2002/atx/intro "atx, the true structured text format" by Aaron Swartz (2002)]&lt;/ref&gt; line markers, or they support both.

==== Underlined headings ====
&lt;pre&gt;Level 1 Heading
===============

Level 2 Heading
---------------

Level 3 Heading
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;/pre&gt;
The first style uses underlines, i.e. repeated characters (e.g. equals &lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt;, hyphen &lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt; or tilde &lt;code&gt;~&lt;/code&gt;, usually at least two or four times) in the line below the heading text.

RST and Texy determine heading levels dynamically, which makes authoring more individual on the one hand, but complicates merges from external sources on the other hand.

==== Prefixed headings ====
&lt;pre&gt;# Level 1 Heading
## Level 2 Heading ##
### Level 3 Heading ###&lt;/pre&gt;
The second style is based on repeated markers (e.g. hash &lt;code&gt;#&lt;/code&gt;, equals &lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt; or asterisk &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt;) at the start of the heading itself, where the number of repetitions indicates the (sometimes inverse) heading level. Most languages also support the reduplication of the markers at the end of the line, but whereas some make them mandatory, others do not even expect their numbers to match.

POD and Textile choose the HTML convention of numbered heading levels instead.
Org-mode supports indentation as a means of indicating the level.

=== Link syntax ===
Hyperlinks can either be added inline, which may clutter the code because of long URLs, or with named &lt;code&gt;alias&lt;/code&gt; or numbered &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt; references to lines containing nothing but the address and related attributes and often may be located anywhere in the document.
Most languages allow the author to specify text &lt;code&gt;Text&lt;/code&gt; to be displayed instead of the plain address &lt;code&gt;http://example.com&lt;/code&gt; and some also provide methods to set a different link title &lt;code&gt;Title&lt;/code&gt; which may contain more information about the destination.

LMLs that are tailored for special setups, e.g. wikis or code documentation, may automatically generate named anchors (for headings, functions etc.) inside the document, link to related pages (possibly in a different namespace) or provide a textual search for linked keywords.

Most languages employ (double) square or angular brackets to surround links, but hardly any two languages are completely compatible. Many can automatically recognize and parse absolute URLs inside the text without further markup.

=== List syntax ===
&lt;!-- TODO: add other languages --&gt;

HTML requires an explicit element for the list, specifying its type, and one for each list item, but most lightweight markup languages need only different line prefixes for the bullet points or enumerated items. Some languages rely on indentation for nested lists, others use repeated parent list markers.

Languages differ on whether they support optional or mandatory digits in numbered list items, which kinds of enumerators they understand (e.g. decimal digit ''1'', roman numerals ''i'' or ''I'', alphabetic letters ''a'' or ''A'') and whether they support to keep explicit values in the output format. Some Markdown dialects, for instance, will honor a start value other than 1, but ignore any other explicit value.

Slack assists the user in entering enumerated and bullet lists, but does not actually format them as such, i.e. it just includes a leading digit followed by a period and a space or a bullet character &lt;code&gt;•&lt;/code&gt; in front of a line.

For Moody's, a bond is considered [[investment grade]] if its credit rating is Baa3 or higher. Bonds rated Ba1 and below are considered to be [[speculative grade]], sometimes also referred to as "junk" bonds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.finance-glossary.com/define/investment-grade/12452/0/I |title=investment grade : defined at Finance Glossary |publisher=Finance-glossary.com |date= |accessdate=2013-02-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105210331/http://finance-glossary.com/define/investment-grade/12452/0/I |archivedate=2012-11-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''''Lophius americanus''''' is a [[goosefish]] in the family [[Lophiidae]], also called '''all-mouth''', '''American anglerfish''', '''bellows-fish''', '''devil-fish''', '''headfish''', '''molligut''', '''satchel-mouth''', or '''wide-gape'''. It is native to the eastern coast of [[North America]].

==Description ==
The American anglerfish is unique in its appearance and has no relatives with which it can be confused in the areas where it is caught.  A fish of lesser importance than other food fish in the region, such as cod, its various names suggest its unusual appearance - a very large mouth, more than twice the width of the tail, with several spines and strong teeth, enabling it to snare prey larger than itself.  The body is flattened dorsoventrally to allow it to hide on the sea floor.  The front of the head carries erectile spines, the primary of which has a flattened end to resemble a small organism or piece of algae.  The pectoral fins are like wide fans behind the head, and the pelvic fins are like small hands below the head.

The American anglerfish can grow to a length of {{convert|140|cm|abbr=on}}, but {{convert|100|cm|abbr=on}} is a more usual size. The greatest recorded weight is {{convert|22.6|kg|abbr=on}} and the greatest recorded age is 30 years.&lt;ref name=FishBase&gt;[http://www.fishbase.us/summary/Lophius-americanus.html ''Lophius americanus''  Valenciennes, 1837] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140408092341/http://www.fishbase.us/summary/Lophius-americanus.html |date=2014-04-08 }} FishBase. Retrieved 2012-01-06.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Distribution and habitat ==
The American anglerfish is found in the western Atlantic from [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]] and [[Quebec]] south to northern [[Florida]], but is commoner in the more northerly parts of its range, north of [[Cape Hatteras]]. It is a [[demersal]] fish living close to the seabed at depths down to about {{convert|2000|ft}}.&lt;ref name=FishBase/&gt; It is found on sand bottoms, gravel, shell fragments, mud and clay.&lt;ref name=NMFS&gt;{{cite journal |author= |year=1999 |title=Goosefish, Lophius americanus, Life History and Habitat Characteristics |publisher=US Department of Commerce: National Marine Fisheries Service  |url=http://www.nefsc.noaa.gov/publications/tm/tm127/tm127.pdf |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Behaviour==
[[File:AmericanAngler.jpg|thumb|left|{{center|Skeleton}}]]
[[File:Different size monkfish.jpg|thumb|right|Various sizes of Lophius americanus]]

===Feeding===
The American anglerfish is an ambush [[Predation|predator]]. It spends most of its time on the seabed partly covered in sediment waiting for suitable [[Predation|prey]] to pass. It can swim slowly or "walk" with the help of its pectoral fins. Its diet normally consists of fin and [[ray fish]], [[squid]]s, [[cuttlefish]] and occasionally carrion.&lt;ref name=NMFS/&gt; After storms it has been reported on the sea surface where it has been recorded as catching seabirds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bigelow, H.B. and W.C. Schroeder |year=1953 |title=Fishes of the Gulf of Maine |journal=Fishery Bulletin |pages=1–577 |volume=53 |publisher=U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service |url=http://www.gma.org/fogm/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Breeding and lifecycle===
Spawning takes place in the summer with a peak in May and June. The [[Egg (biology)|eggs]] are large and are believed to be unique among fish in being attached to a floating [[mucus]] veil. The number of eggs in a veil can range from 1 to 3 million and the veil drifts on the surface of the sea. The eggs hatch after 6 to 100 days, depending on the sea temperature, and remain protected within the veil for a few days, absorbing nutrients from their yolk sacs. They then become pelagic and join other fish larvae in the "ichthyoplankton community". The larvae feed on [[zooplankton]] and look quite different from the adult fish, being laterally compressed and having long dorsal and pectoral fin rays. When about {{convert|7|cm}} long they become juveniles, changing their appearance over a period of several weeks into the adult shape and starting to live on the seabed. They grow fast in their first year and more slowly thereafter.&lt;ref name=NMFS/&gt;

==Food use ==

The flesh of the anglerfish is located primarily in the body, less so in the "shoulders" and cheeks.  The flesh is very white and moist, becoming quite firm when cooked.  It is served both in soups and grilled, and is similar in texture to the flesh of crustaceans.  Fillets are thick and boneless resembling crab or lobster tail.  Connoisseurs believe the liver is also excellent.  The fish is covered with a soft, scaleless, elastic skin, under which another thin edible membrane covers the flesh.  Though much less so than in cod, one can sometimes find parasitic worms in the flesh of anglerfish, whose opacity can make them easier to find. Worms are usually found between the skin and outer portion of the flesh ranging in size from a few millimeters to over one inch.

== Sustainable consumption ==
In 2010, Greenpeace International added ''Lophius americanus'' or the American anglerfish to its seafood red list. "The Greenpeace International seafood red list is a list of fish that are commonly sold in supermarkets around the world, and which have a very high risk of being sourced from unsustainable fisheries."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/campaigns/oceans/seafood/red-list-of-species/ Greenpeace International Seafood Red list]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{pp-semi-indef|small=yes}}
'''MENA''' is an [[English language|English-language]] [[acronym]] referring to the '''[[Middle East]] and [[North Africa]]''' region. An alternative for the same group of countries is '''WANA''' ([[West Asia]] and North Africa). The term covers an extensive region stretching from [[Morocco]] to [[Iran]], including all [[Mashriq]] and [[Maghreb]] countries. This toponym is roughly synonymous with the term the [[Greater Middle East]].

The population of the MENA region at its least extent is estimated to be around 381 million people. This constitutes about 6% of the total world population. The MENA acronym is often used in [[Education in the Middle East and North Africa|academia]], military planning, disaster relief, media planning as a broadcast region, and business writing.&lt;ref name="worldbank"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/COUNTRIES/MENAEXT/0,,menuPK:247619~pagePK:146748~piPK:146812~theSitePK:256299,00.html|title=World Bank Definition: MENA|publisher=Worldbank.org|accessdate=28 November 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141029180410/http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/COUNTRIES/MENAEXT/0,,menuPK:247619~pagePK:146748~piPK:146812~theSitePK:256299,00.html|archivedate=29 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weforum.org/en/events/WorldEconomicForumontheMiddleEastandNorthAfrica/index.htm|title=World Economic Forum on the Middle East and North Africa, Marrakech, Morocco, 26-28 October 2010|work=World Economic Forum on the Middle East and North Africa 2010 - World Economic Forum|accessdate=28 November 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/66ooOPiYU?url=http://www.weforum.org/events/world-economic-forum-middle-east-and-north-africa-2010|archivedate=10 April 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
Due to the geographic ambiguity and [[Eurocentrism|Eurocentric]] nature of the term "Middle East", some people prefer use of the terms '''Arab World''', '''WANA''' ([[West Asia]] and North Africa)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldbank.org/html/cgiar/newsletter/april97/8beltagy.html|title=West Asia and North Africa: A Regional Vision|publisher=Worldbank.org|accessdate=28 November 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141027183217/http://www.worldbank.org/html/cgiar/newsletter/april97/8beltagy.html|archivedate=27 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the less common '''NAWA''' (North Africa-West Asia).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.agu.org/pubs/crossref/2003/2003GL017862.shtml|title=Welcome|publisher=Agu.org|accessdate=28 November 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050430023759/http://www.agu.org/pubs/crossref/2003/2003GL017862.shtml|archivedate=30 April 2005|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both the [[Arab world]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Malone|first=David|date=25 October 2003|accessdate=3 January 2011|newspaper=[[World Bank]]|location=Washington D.C.|url=http://data.worldbank.org/region/arab-world|title=Arab World Data|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160713110839/http://data.worldbank.org/region/arab-world|archivedate=13 July 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and MENA region remain the most common terms and are used by most organizations, academia, and political entities flexibly, including those in the region itself.

==Economy==
{{See also|Economy of the Middle East}}
The MENA region has vast reserves of [[petroleum]] and [[natural gas]] that make it a vital source of global [[economic stability]]. According to the Oil and Gas Journal (January 1, 2009), the MENA region has 60% of the world's [[oil reserves]] ({{convert|810.98|Goilbbl|km3}}) and 45% of the world's natural gas reserves (  {{convert|2868886|e9cuft|km3}}  ).&lt;ref name="international reserves"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/international/reserves.html | title=International Reserves | publisher=[[United States Department of Energy]] | accessdate=2011 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110513235602/http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/international/reserves.html | archivedate=2011-05-13 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2011, 8 of the 15 [[OPEC]] nations are within the MENA region.

==Religion==
[[Islam]] is by far the dominant religion in nearly all of the MENA territories; 91.2% of the population is [[Muslim]]. The Middle East-North Africa region comprises 20 countries and territories with an estimated Muslim population of 315 million or about 23% of the world's Muslim population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewforum.org/2009/10/07/mapping-the-global-muslim-population10/|title=Middle East-North Africa Overview|date=7 October 2009|publisher=Pew Forum|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170128210559/http://www.pewforum.org/2009/10/07/mapping-the-global-muslim-population10/|archivedate=28 January 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "MENA" is often defined in part in relation to majority Muslim countries that based on the countries located in the region, although several nations in the region are not majority Muslim-dominated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://intpolicydigest.org/2012/04/24/politics-and-islam-in-central-asia-and-mena/|title=Politics and Islam in Central Asia and MENA|date=24 April 2012|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170206022201/https://intpolicydigest.org/2012/04/24/politics-and-islam-in-central-asia-and-mena/|archivedate=6 February 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other terms==

===MENAP===
From April 2013, the [[International Monetary Fund]] started using a new analytical region called [[MENAP]] (Middle East, North Africa, Afghanistan, and Pakistan), which adds [[Afghanistan]] and [[Pakistan]] to MENA countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2013/01/weodata/index.aspx|title=World Economic Outlook Database|publisher=Imf.org|accessdate=28 November 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141023211422/http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2013/01/weodata/index.aspx|archivedate=23 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Now [[MENAP]] is prominent economic grouping in IMF reports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2016/01/pdf/text.pdf |title=World Economic Outlook Database|accessdate=2016-04-23 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160421023851/http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2016/01/pdf/text.pdf |archivedate=2016-04-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/reo/2013/mcd/eng/pdf/menap1113_h.pdf |title=MENAP|accessdate=2016-10-03 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140819070817/http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/reo/2013/mcd/eng/pdf/menap1113_h.pdf |archivedate=2014-08-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===MENAT===
The term '''MENAT''' has been used to include [[Turkey]] in the list of '''MENA''' countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://middleeast.syr.edu/aboutus/MENAT-regional-council.html | title = MENAT Regional Council | publisher = Syracuse University Dubai | accessdate = June 14, 2016 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160818165906/http://middleeast.syr.edu/aboutus/MENAT-regional-council.html | archivedate = August 18, 2016 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ge.com/news/company-information/menat | title = About GE in the Middle East, North Africa and Turkey (MENAT) | publisher = General Electric | accessdate = June 14, 2016 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160804211613/http://www.ge.com/news/company-information/menat | archivedate = August 4, 2016 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Instability in the region==
Due to rich resources, mainly oil and gas, combined with its location between three continents, ([[Asia]], [[Africa]] and [[Europe]]), the MENA region has been in conflict since the collapse of the [[Ottoman Empire]]; notably due to the creation of [[Israel]], a Jewish state among Arab and Muslim countries; [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]]; the [[Iran–Iraq War]]; [[Iran–Saudi Arabia proxy conflict]]; and [[War on Terror|the rise of terrorism]]. Conflict in the region had come to its highest peak so far in the 21st century, with incidents such as [[2003 invasion of Iraq|the U.S. intervention of Iraq in 2003]] and subsequent [[Iraq War]] and the rise of [[ISIS]]; the [[Arab Spring]], which spread war to throughout the region such as the [[Syrian Civil War]], [[Libyan Civil War (2011)|Libyan Civil War]] and [[Yemeni Civil War (2015–present)|Yemeni Civil War]].

'''Microsoft Academic Search''' was a research project and academic search engine retired in 2012.&lt;ref name="Microsoft Academic Search FAQ"&gt;{{cite web|title=Microsoft Academic Search FAQ|url=https://academic.microsoft.com/FAQ|accessdate=29 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It relaunched in 2016 as [[Microsoft Academic]].

==History==
Microsoft launched a search tool called Windows Live Academic Search in 2006 to directly compete with Google Scholar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carlson|first1=Scott|title=Challenging Google, Microsoft Unveils a Search Tool for Scholarly Articles|journal=Chronicle of Higher Education|date=April 2006|volume=52|issue=33|page=A43|url=https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ773667|accessdate=29 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was renamed [[Live Search Academic]] after its first year and then discontinued two years later.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jacsó|first1=Péter|title=The pros and cons of Microsoft Academic Search from a bibliometric perspective|journal=Online Information Review|date=2011|volume=35|issue=6|pages=983–997}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, [[Microsoft Research Asia]] Group launched a beta tool called Libra in 2009, which was for the purpose of algorithms research in object-level vertical search,&lt;ref name="msr news vertical search"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/news/features/verticalsearch.aspx|title=Microsoft Research News: Search Objective Gets a Refined Approach|publisher=Microsoft Research|accessdate=February 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[data mining]], [[entity linking]], and [[data visualization]].&lt;ref name="microsoft academic search project description"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/academic/|title=Microsoft Research Projects - Academic Search|publisher=Microsoft Research|accessdate=February 20, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140225095910/http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/academic/|archivedate=February 25, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Libra was redirected to the MAS service by 2011 and contained 27.2 million records for books, conference papers, and journals.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Although largely functional, the service was not intended to be a production website and ceased to be developed, as was originally intended when the research goals of the project had been met.&lt;ref name="microsoft academic search help page; current"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://academic.research.microsoft.com/About/Help.htm|title=About Microsoft Academic Search|publisher=Microsoft Research|accessdate=February 20, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140213082154/http://academic.research.microsoft.com/About/Help.htm|archivedate=February 13, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The service stopped being updated in 2012.,&lt;ref name="Microsoft Academic Search FAQ"/&gt;&lt;ref name="1404.7045"&gt;{{Cite journal|arxiv=1404.7045|title=Empirical Evidences in Citation-Based Search Engines: Is Microsoft Academic Search dead?|journal=Online Information Review|volume=38|issue=7|pages=936|last1=Orduna-Malea|first1=Enrique|author2=Juan Manuel Ayllon|last3=Martin-Martin|first3=Alberto|author4=Emilio Delgado Lopez-Cozar|year=2014|doi=10.1108/OIR-07-2014-0169}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that this decline was not reported on earlier indicated to the authors that the service was largely ignored by academics and bibliometricians alike.&lt;ref name="1404.7045"/&gt;

In July 2014, Microsoft Research announced that [[Microsoft Academic]] was evolving from a research project to a production service, and would be integrating with Microsoft's flagship search engine, [[Bing (search engine)|Bing]], and its intelligent personal assistant service, [[Microsoft Cortana|Cortana]]. “By growing Microsoft Academic Search from a research effort to production,” [Microsoft Research's Kuansan] Wang says, “our goal is to make Bing-powered Cortana the best personal research assistant for our users"&lt;ref name="cortana research"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.technet.com/b/inside_microsoft_research/archive/2014/07/14/making-cortana-the-researcher-s-dream-assistant.aspx|title=Making Cortana the Researcher's Dream Assistant|accessdate=March 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2420">The '''Moys Classification Scheme''' is a system of [[library classification]] for legal materials. It was designed by [[Betty Moys]] and first published in 1968. It is used primarily in [[Law library|law libraries]] in many common law jurisdictions such as [[Canada]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], and the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref name=IALS&gt;{{cite web|title=IALS Library|url=http://ials.sas.ac.uk/library/archives/moys.htm|publisher=Institute of Advanced Legal Studies|accessdate=5 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The Moys system is designed to fit into a library that utilises [[Library of Congress Classification|Library of Congress Classification (LCC)]]. The primary reason for this is that LCC had not fully developed the K class (the class for Law) at the time when the Moys system was developed. In addition, LCC is the main classification system used in academic libraries. This commonality is the rationale behind adopting the same notation style used in the [[Library of Congress Classification:Class K -- Law|LCC Class K]]. The subclasses and enumeration are very different in the two systems, though.&lt;ref name=Moysclass&gt;{{cite book|last=Moys|first=Elizabeth M.|title=Moys Classification and Thesaurus for Legal Materials, 4th ed.|year=2001|publisher=K.G. Saur|location=München|isbn=3598115024|page=xxvi}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with LCC, a set of numbers follows the class letters to indicate specific subject areas (however there is notably less use of decimal points in the Moys system than in LCC).

==Classes&lt;ref&gt;Moys 2001, pp. xli-xlii&lt;/ref&gt;==   
Note: Not all of these subclasses are mandatory, and certain classes may not be utilised in some libraries.

In [[linguistic typology]], a '''null-subject language''' is a [[language]] whose [[grammar]] permits an [[independent clause]] to lack an explicit [[subject (grammar)|subject]]; such a clause is then said to have a '''null subject'''.

Typically, null-subject languages express [[Grammatical person|person]], [[Grammatical number|number]], and/or [[Grammatical gender|gender]] [[Agreement (linguistics)|agreement]] with the [[Coreference|referent]] on the verb, rendering a subject [[noun phrase]] redundant. In the [[principles and parameters]] framework, the null subject is controlled by the '''pro-drop parameter''', which is either on or off for a particular language.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

For example, in [[Italian language|Italian]] the subject "she" can be either explicit or implicit:
:{{lang|it|Maria non vuole mangiare.}} [[literal translation|lit.]] Maria not wants [to-]eat, "Maria does not want to eat".
:{{lang|it|Non vuole mangiare.}} lit. [[Subject (grammar)|Subject]] not wants [to-]eat, "[(S)he] does not want to eat."

The subject "(s)he" of the second sentence is only implied in Italian. [[English language|English]] and [[French language|French]], on the other hand, require an explicit subject in this sentence.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

&lt;!--PLEASE DISCUSS ON TALK PAGE BEFORE ADDING MORE LANGUAGES HERE--&gt;
Of the thousands of languages in the world, a considerable number are null-subject languages, from a wide diversity of unrelated [[language family|language families]]. They include [[Albanian language|Albanian]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Basque language|Basque]], [[Berber language|Berber]], [[Catalan language|Catalan]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Estonian language|Estonian]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], [[Hindi language|Hindi]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Italian language|Italian]],  [[Romanian language|Romanian]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Korean language|Korean]],  [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]],  [[Slavic languages]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]] and the [[Turkic languages]], as well as most languages related to these, and many others still. In fact, it is rather the absence of [[pro-drop language|pronoun dropping]] that is an [[areal feature]] of [[Standard Average European]], including French, German, and English.&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin Haspelmath]], [http://www.anglistik.uni-freiburg.de/seminar/abteilungen/sprachwissenschaft/ls_kortmann/Courses/Kortmann/Variation/index_html/2008-05-27.8724094854 ''The European linguistic area: Standard Average European''], in Martin Haspelmath, ''et al.'', ''Language Typology and Language Universals'', vol. 2, 2001, pp. 1492-1510&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characterization==
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2018}}
In the framework of [[government and binding theory]] of [[syntax]], the term ''null subject'' refers to an [[empty category]]. The empty category in question is thought to behave like an ordinary [[pronoun]] with respect to [[anaphora (linguistics)|anaphoric reference]] and other grammatical behavior. Hence it is most commonly referred to as "''pro''".

This phenomenon is similar, but not identical, to that of [[pro-drop language]]s, which may omit pronouns, including subject pronouns, but also [[object (grammar)|object]] pronouns. While all pro-drop languages are null-subject languages, not all null-subject languages are pro-drop.

In null-subject languages that have [[verb]] [[inflection]] in which the verb inflects for person, the [[grammatical person]] of the subject is reflected by the inflection of the verb and likewise for [[grammatical number|number]] and [[grammatical gender|gender]].

==Examples==
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2018}}
The following examples come from [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]:

*"I'm going home" can be translated either as {{lang|pt|vou para casa}} or as {{lang|pt|eu vou para casa}}, where ''eu'' means "I".
*"It's raining" can be translated as {{lang|pt|está chovendo}} ([[Brazilian Portuguese]]) or {{lang|pt|está a chover}} ([[European Portuguese]]). In Portuguese, as in the other Romance languages, there is no exact equivalent for the pronoun ''it''. However, some elder persons say {{lang|pt|Ele está a chover}} ([[European Portuguese]]) which directly translates to "He is raining".
*"I'm going home. I'm going to watch TV" would not, except in exceptional circumstances, be translated as {{lang|pt|Eu vou para casa. Eu vou ver televisão.}} At least the subject of the second sentence should be omitted in Portuguese unless one wishes to express emphasis, as to emphasize the ''I''.

As the examples illustrate, in many null-subject languages, [[personal pronoun]]s exist and can be used for [[Stress (linguistics)|emphasis]] but are dropped whenever they can be inferred from the context. Some sentences do not allow a subject in any form while, in other cases an explicit subject without particular emphasis, would sound awkward or unnatural.

Most [[Bantu language]]s are null-subject. For example, in [[Luganda|Ganda]], 'I'm going home' could be translated as ''Ŋŋenze ewange'' or as ''Nze ŋŋenze ewange'', where ''nze'' means 'I'.

===Arabic===
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2018}}
[[Arabic language|Arabic]] is considered a null-subject language, as demonstrated by the following example:

:Arabic text: ساعد غيرك، يساعدك
:Transliteration: ''sā‘id ghayrak, yusā‘iduk''
:Literal translation: help other, he helps you.
:Idiomatic translation: You help another, he helps you.

===Azerbaijani===
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2018}}
''Gəldim, gördüm, işğal etdim'' ("[[Veni, vidi, vici]]").&lt;br/&gt;
'''Literal translation:''' came, saw, conquered.&lt;br/&gt;
'''Idiomatic translation:''' I came, I saw, I conquered.

===Bulgarian===
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2018}}
''Дойдох, видях, победих'' ("[[Veni, vidi, vici]]").&lt;br/&gt;
'''Literal translation:''' came, saw, conquered.&lt;br/&gt;
'''Idiomatic translation:''' I came, I saw, I conquered.

===Catalan===
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2018}}
In Catalan, as in Spanish, Portuguese, Galician, etc., the subject is also encoded in the [[verb conjugation]]. Pronoun use is not obligatory.
* ''(Nosaltres) Anem a la platja'': We go to the beach.
* ''(Tu) Ets la meva amiga'': You are my friend.
* ''(Vostès/vosaltres) No són/sou benvinguts aquí'': You are not welcome here.
* ''(Ells) Estan dormint'': They are asleep.
* ''(Jo) Necessito ajuda'': I need help.
* ''(Ell) És a la seva habitació'': He is in his bedroom.
* ''(Ella) Està cansada'': She is tired.

In Catalan, one may choose whether to use the subject or not. If used in an inclined tone, it may be seen as an added emphasis; however, in colloquial speaking, usage of a pronoun is optional. Even so, sentences with a null subject are used more frequently than sentences with a subject. In some cases, it is even necessary to skip the subject to create a grammatically correct sentence.

===Chinese===
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2018}}
Most [[varieties of Chinese]] tend to be non-null-subject. However, in certain circumstances, most Chinese varieties would remove the subjects, thus forming null-subject sentences. One of the instances where the subject would be removed is when the subject is known. Below is an example in Mandarin:

{| style="text-align:left"
! Chinese text 1
| {{ruby-zh-p|妈|mā}}{{ruby-zh-p|妈|ma}} ||:||{{ruby-zh-p|不|bú}} || {{ruby-zh-p|要|yào}} || {{ruby-zh-p|忘|wàng}}{{ruby-zh-p|了|le}} || {{ruby-zh-p|丢|diū}} || {{ruby-zh-p|垃|lā}}{{ruby-zh-p|圾|ji}} || 。

! Literal translation 1
| ''Mother'' ||:|| ''Not'' || ''want'' || ''forget'' || ''&lt;small&gt;LE(perfect aspect)&lt;/small&gt;''|| ''throw'' || ''rubbish'' .
|}

{| style="text-align:left"
! Chinese text 2
| {{ruby-zh-p|妹|mèi}}{{ruby-zh-p|妹|mei}} ||:|| {{ruby-zh-p|知|zhī}}{{ruby-zh-p|道|dào}} || {{ruby-zh-p|啦|la}}。
|-
! Literal translation 2
| ''Younger sister''||:|| ''(I)know'' || (&lt;small&gt;PARTICLE&lt;/small&gt;).
|}
{| style="text-align:left"
! Idiomatic translation
||''Mother : "Do not (you) forget to take out the rubbish."''||
||''Younger sister : "(I) know it"''||
|}
The above example clearly shows that a speaker could omit the subject if the doer of the verb is known. In a Chinese imperative sentence, like the first text, the subject is also left out.

===Emilian===
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2018}}
In [[Emilian dialect|Emilian]] (a [[Gallo-Italic languages|Gallo-Italic language]]) at least one pronoun (of two) is mandatory.
* ''(Nuàtar) A 'ndém in spiàgia'': We go to the beach.
* ''(Tè) At sē mè amìga'': You are my friend.
* ''(Vuàtar) A n sî minga bènvgnû chè'': You are not welcome here. → (you) you not are not welcome here.
* ''(Lōr) I èn drē a durmìr'': They are asleep. → (they) they are behind to sleep.
* ''(I gat) I èn drē a durmìr'': Cats are asleep. → (the cats) they are behind to sleep.
* ''(Mè) A gh'ò biśógn 'd ajùt'': I need help.
* ''(Lò) 'L è in dla sò cambra'': He is in his bedroom. → (he) he is in of the his bedroom.
* ''(Śvan) 'L è in dla sò cambra'': John is in his bedroom. → (John) he is in of the his bedroom.
* ''(Lē) L'è stufa'': She is tired.

===Modern Greek===
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2018}}
''Ήρθα, είδα, νίκησα'' (equivalent of "[[Veni, vidi, vici]]" in Latin).&lt;br/&gt;
'''Transliteration:''' Írtha, eída, níkisa.&lt;br/&gt;
'''Literal translation:''' came, saw, conquered.&lt;br/&gt;
'''Idiomatic translation:''' I came, I saw, I conquered.

===Hebrew===
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2018}}
[[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] is considered a partially null-subject language, as demonstrated by the following example:

'''Hebrew text:''' עזור לאחרים, יעזרו לך&lt;br/&gt;
'''Transliteration:''' azor l'aherim, ya'azru lkha&lt;br/&gt;
'''Literal translation:''' help others, will-help you&lt;br/&gt;
'''Idiomatic translation:'''  you help others, they will help you.

Subjects can usually be omitted only when the verb is conjugated for grammatical person, as in the third-person plural in the example above.
In Hebrew one can also construct null-subject sentences as in the Latin and Turkish language examples: "We/they are going to the beach" can be expressed as "holkhim la-yam" (הולכים לים), lit. "Are going to the beach." This is truly a null-subject construction.

As in Spanish and Turkish though, Hebrew conjugates verbs in accordance with specific pronouns, so "we went to the beach" is technically just as much a null-subject construction as in the other languages, but in fact the conjugation does indicate the subject pronoun: "Halakhnu la-yam" (הלכנו לים), lit. "Went (we) to the beach." The word "halakhnu" means "we went", just as the Spanish and Turkish examples indicate the relevant pronoun as the subject in their conjugation. So these should perhaps not be considered to be true null-subject phrases.  
Potentially confusing the issue further, is the fact that Hebrew word order can also make some sentences appear to be null-subject, when the subject is in fact given after the verb. For instance, "it's raining" is expressed "yored geshem" (יורד גשם) which means "descends rain" - rain is the subject. The phrases meaning "It's snowing" and "It's hailing" are formed in the same way.

===Japanese===
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2018}}
[[Japanese language|Japanese]] and several other null-subject languages are [[topic-prominent language]]s; some of these languages require an expressed [[topic (linguistics)|topic]] in order for sentences to make sense. In Japanese, for example, it is possible to start a sentence with a topic marked by the particle ''wa'', and in subsequent sentences leave the topic unstated, as it is understood to remain the same, until another one is either explicitly or implicitly introduced. For example, in the second sentence below, the subject ("we") is not expressed again but left implicit:

{| style="text-align:left"
! Japanese text
| {{ruby-ja|私|わたし}}{{ruby-ja|達|たち}}は || {{ruby-ja|買|か}}い{{ruby-ja|物|もの}}を || した。 || {{ruby-ja|後|あと}} で || ご{{ruby-ja|飯|はん}}を || {{ruby-ja|食|た}}べた。
|-
! Transliteration
| Watashitachi ''wa'' || kaimono ''o'' || shita. || Ato ''de'' || gohan ''o'' || tabeta.
|-
! Literal translation
| ''We'' (&lt;small&gt;TOPIC&lt;/small&gt;) || ''shopping'' (&lt;small&gt;OBJ&lt;/small&gt;) || ''did.'' || ''After'' (&lt;small&gt;COMPL&lt;/small&gt;) || ''dinner'' (&lt;small&gt;OBJ&lt;/small&gt;) || ''ate.''
|-
! Idiomatic translation
|colspan="6" | ''"We went shopping. Afterwards, we ate dinner."''
|}

In other cases, the topic can be changed without being explicitly stated, as in the following example, where the topic changes implicitly from "today" to "I".

{| style="text-align:left"
! Japanese text
| {{ruby-ja|今日|きょう}}は || ゲームの || {{ruby-ja|発|はつ}}{{ruby-ja|売|ばい}}{{ruby-ja|日|び}} || なんだ || けど、 || {{ruby-ja|買|か}}おうか || どうか || {{ruby-ja|迷|まよ}}っている。
|-
! Transliteration
| Kyō ''wa'' || gēmu ''no'' || hatsubaibi || na n da || kedo, || kaō ''ka'' || dō ''ka'' || Mayotte iru.
|-
! Literal translation
| ''Today'' (&lt;small&gt;TOPIC&lt;/small&gt;) || ''game'' (&lt;small&gt;GEN&lt;/small&gt;) || ''release date'' || ''is'' || ''but'', || ''whether to buy'' || ''or not'' || ''confused''.
|-
! Idiomatic translation
|colspan="6" | ''"The game comes out today, but (I) can't decide whether or not to buy (it)."''
|}

===Latin===
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2018}}
'''Latin text:''' [[Veni, vidi, vici]]. &lt;br/&gt;
'''Literal translation:''' (I) came, (I) saw, (I) conquered.&lt;br/&gt;
'''Idiomatic translation:''' I came, I saw, I conquered.

'''Latin text:''' [[Cogito ergo sum]]. &lt;br/&gt;
'''Literal translation:''' (I) think, therefore (I) am.&lt;br/&gt;
'''Idiomatic translation:''' I think, therefore I am.

===Macedonian===
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2018}}
''Дојдов, видов, победив'' ("[[Veni, vidi, vici]]").&lt;br/&gt;
'''Literal translation:''' came, saw, conquered.&lt;br/&gt;
'''Idiomatic translation:''' I came, I saw, I conquered.

===Polish===
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2018}}
''Myślę, więc jestem.'' ("[[Cogito ergo sum]]").&lt;br/&gt;
'''Literal translation:''' (I) think, therefore (I) am.&lt;br/&gt;
'''Idiomatic translation:''' I think, therefore I am.

In Polish, the subject is omitted almost every time, although it can be present to put emphasis on the subject.

===Russian===
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2018}}
''Пришёл, увидел, победил'' ("[[Veni, vidi, vici]]").&lt;br/&gt;
'''Literal translation:''' came, saw, conquered.&lt;br/&gt;
'''Idiomatic translation:''' I came, I saw, I conquered.

===Spanish===
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2018}}
In Spanish, as with Latin and most Romance languages, the subject is encoded in the verb conjugation. Pronoun use is not obligatory.
* {{lang|es|(Yo) Necesito ayuda}}: I need help.
* {{lang|es|(Tú) Eres mi amiga}}: You(infrm) are my friend.
* {{lang|es|(Usted) Me ve}}: You(frm) see me.
* {{lang|es|(Él) Está en su habitación}}: He is in his bedroom.
* {{lang|es|(Ella) Está cansada}}: She is tired.
* {{lang|es|(Nosotros) Vamos a la playa}}: We go to the beach.
* {{lang|es|(Vosotros) Deberíais andarse}}: You(pl, infrm) should leave.
* {{lang|es|(Ustedes) No son bienvenidos aquí}}: You(pl) are not welcome here.
* {{lang|es|(Ellos) Están durmiendo}}: They are asleep.
* {{lang|es|(Ellas) Van allí}}: They(fem) go there..

In Spanish, for the most part one may choose whether to use the subject or not. Generally if a subject is provided, it is either for clarity or for emphasis. Sentences with a null subject are used more frequently than sentences with a subject. In some cases, it is even necessary to skip the subject to create a grammatically correct sentence{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}.

===Turkish===
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2018}}
''Geldim, gördüm, yendim'' ("[[Veni, vidi, vici]]").&lt;br/&gt;
'''Literal translation:''' I came, I saw, I conquered.&lt;br/&gt;
''Ben geldim, ben gördüm, ben yendim''&lt;br/&gt;
'''Idiomatic translation:''' ''I'' came, ''I'' saw, ''I'' conquered.

===Tamil===
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2018}}
Verb conjugations in Tamil incorporate suffixes for number (singular and plural) and person (1st, 2nd and 3rd), and also for gender (masculine, feminine and neuter) in the third person. An explicit subject, therefore, is unnecessary, and can be inferred from the verb conjugation.

'''Tamil script:''' முடிந்துவிட்டது &lt;br/&gt;
'''Transliteration:''' muḍinduviṭṭadu&lt;br/&gt;
'''Literal Translation:''' It has left, having ended.&lt;br/&gt;
'''Actual Translation:''' It has come to an end.

==Impersonal constructions==
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2018}}
{{Main article|Impersonal verb}}
In some cases ([[impersonal verb|impersonal constructions]]), a proposition has no [[referent]] at all. Pro-drop languages deal naturally with these, whereas many non-pro-drop languages such as English and French must fill in the [[syntax|syntactic]] gap by inserting a [[dummy pronoun]]. "''*Rains''" is not a correct sentence; a dummy "it" must be added: "''It rains''"; in French "''Il pleut''". In most Romance languages, however, "''Rains''" can be a sentence: Spanish "''Llueve''", Italian "''Piove''", Catalan "''Plou''", Portuguese "''Chove''", Romanian "''Plouă''", etc. [[Uralic language|Uralic]] and [[Slavic languages]] also show this trait: [[Finnish language|Finnish]] "''Sataa''", [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] "''Esik''"; [[Polish language|Polish]] "''Pada''".

There are [[constructed languages]] that are not pro-drop but do not require this syntactic gap to be filled. For example, in [[Esperanto]], "He made the cake" would translate as ''Li faris la kukon'' (never ''*Faris la kukon''), but ''It rained yesterday'' would be ''Pluvis hieraŭ'' (not ''*Ĝi pluvis hieraŭ'').

==Null subjects in non-null-subject languages==
Other languages (sometimes called '''non-null-subject languages''') require each sentence to include a subject: this is the case for most [[Germanic languages]], including [[English language|English]] and [[German language|German]], as well as many other languages. [[French language|French]], though a [[Romance language]], also requires a subject. In some cases—particularly in English, less so in German, and occasionally in French—[[colloquialism|colloquial]] expressions allow for the omission of the subject in a manner similar to that of Spanish or [[Russian language|Russian]]:{{vague|date=May 2018}}{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

:"[''I''] Bumped into George this morning." 
:"[''We''] Agreed to have a snifter to catch up on old times." 
:"[''He''] Told me what the two of you had been up to." 
:"[''You''] Went down to Brighton for the weekend?" 

===The imperative form===
Even in such non-null-subject languages as English, it is standard for [[clause (grammar)|clauses]] in the [[imperative mood]] to lack explicit subjects; for example:
:"Take a break—you're working too hard."
:"Shut up!"
:"Don't listen to him!"

An explicit declaration of the pronoun in the imperative mood is typically reserved for [[intensifier|emphasis]]:
:"You stay away!"
:"Don't you listen to him!"

French and German offer less flexibility with respect to null subjects. 

In French, it is neither grammatically correct nor possible to include the subject within the imperative form; the ''vous'' in the expression ''taisez-vous'' stems from the fact that ''se taire'', "to be silent," is a [[reflexive verb]] and is thus the object with similar meaning to "yourself" in an English imperative.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

In German, the pronoun (singular ''du'' or plural ''ihr'') is normally omitted from the informal [[grammatical person|second-person]] imperative (''Mach das'', "Do it"), although it may be added in a colloquial manner for emphasis (''Macht ihr das!'', "''You [guys]'' do it!"). By contrast, the addressee-specific formal imperative requires the addition of the pronoun ''Sie'' (as in ''Machen Sie das!'', "Do it, [sir/ma'am]!") to avoid confusion with the otherwise [[morphology (linguistics)|morphologically]] identical [[infinitive]], whereas the addressee-nonspecific or "neutral" formal imperative omits the pronoun and moves the verb to [[German sentence structure|final position]] (as in ''Bitte nicht stören'', "Please do not disturb"). On the other hand, the pronoun ''wir'' is always included in the first-person plural imperative (''Machen wir das!'', "Let's do it!"), with the verb appearing in first position to differentiate the imperative from the [[indicative mood]], wherein the verb appears in [[V2 word order|second position]] (as in ''Wir machen das'', "We're doing it").&lt;ref name="joyce2018"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Joyce |first1=Paul |title=German verbs: the imperative |url=http://joycep.myweb.port.ac.uk/verbs/imperat.html |website=The Paul Joyce Beginners' German Course |publisher=Paul Joyce |accessdate=31 May 2018 |ref=joyce2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Auxiliary languages ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2018}}
Many [[international auxiliary language]]s, while not officially pro-drop, permit pronoun omission with some regularity.

===Interlingua===
In [[Interlingua]], pronoun omission is most common with the pronoun ''il'', which means "it" when referring to part of a sentence or to nothing in particular. Examples of this word include
:Il pluvia.
:''It's raining.''
:Il es ver que ille arriva deman.
:''It is true that he arrives tomorrow.''

''Il'' tends to be omitted whenever the contraction "it's" can be used in English. Thus, ''il'' may be omitted from the second sentence above: "Es ver que ille arriva deman". In addition, subject pronouns are sometimes omitted when they can be inferred from a previous sentence:

:Illa audiva un crito. Curreva al porta. Aperiva lo.
:''She heard a cry. Ran to the door. Opened it.''

===Esperanto===
Similarly, [[Esperanto]] sometimes exhibits pronoun deletion in casual use. This deletion is normally limited to subject pronouns, especially where the pronoun has been used just previously:

:Ĉu vi vidas lin? Venas nun.
:&lt;small&gt;QUESTION-PARTICLE&lt;/small&gt; ''you see him? Comes now.''
:''Do you see him? ''He'' is coming now.''

In "official" use, however, Esperanto admits of null-subject sentences in two cases only:
* (optional) in the 2nd person imperative ''(N.B. The Esperanto imperative is often named "volitive" instead, since it can be conjugated with a subject in any person, and also used in subordinate clauses)''
*: Venu! ''Come!''
*: Vi venu! ''You [there], come [with me]!'' (pronoun added for emphasis)
* For "impersonal verbs" which have no semantic subject. In English or French, an "empty" subject is nevertheless required:
*: Pluvas. '''''It''' is raining.'' FR: '''''Il''' pleut.''
*: Estas nun somero. '''''It''' is summer now.'' FR: '''''C&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''est l'été à présent.''
*: Estas vere, ke li alvenos morgaŭ. '''''It''' is true that he will arrive tomorrow.'' FR: '''''C&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''est vrai qu'il arrivera demain.''
*:: ''(In this latter case, the sentence is not really no-subject, since "ke li alvenos morgaŭ" ("that he will arrive tomorrow") is the subject.)''

Contrary to the Interlingua example above, and as in English, a repeated subject can normally be omitted only within a single sentence:
: Ŝi aŭdis krion. Ŝi kuris al la pordo. Ŝi malfermis ĝin.
:: ''She heard a shout. She ran to the door. She opened it.''
: Ŝi aŭdis krion, kuris al la pordo kaj malfermis ĝin.
:: ''She heard a shout, ran to the door and opened it.''

The '''Phenice method''' is a form of gross morphological analysis used to determine the sex of an unidentified human skeleton based on three characteristics of the [[pelvis]]: the ventral arc, sub-pubic concavity, and the medial aspect of the [[ischiopubic ramus]]. It is named after T.{{nbsp}}W. Phenice, who first described the method in a 1969 paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Phenice|first=T.W.|title=A newly developed visual method of sexing in the os pubis|journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology|year=1969|volume=30|pages=297–301|doi=10.1002/ajpa.1330300214|pmid=5772048|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Phenice method should only be used for adult individuals because inter-sex differences in the morphology of the pelvis are [[Secondary sex characteristic|secondary sexual characteristics]] present only in post-pubertal individuals.

==Determining sex using the Phenice method==

===Ventral arc===
The ventral arc is a ridge of bone on the inferior aspect of the anterior surface of the [[Pubis (bone)|pubis]] present only in females.

===Sub-pubic concavity===
From the anterior view, female [[Hip bone|os coxae]] display concavity of the ischiopubic ramus along the medial edge. In males, the medial edge of the ischiopubic ramus from the anterior view is straight.

===Medial aspect of the ischiopubic ramus===
From the medial view, the medial aspect of the ischiopubic ramus has a sharp edge inferior to the pubis in females. In males, this surface is broad and flat.

A '''press kit''', often referred to as a '''media kit''' in business environments, is a pre-packaged set of promotional materials that provide information about a person, company, organization or cause and which is distributed to members of the [[Mass media|media]] for [[promotion (marketing)|promotional]] use.  Press kits, or media kits as they are sometimes known, are often distributed to announce a release or for a [[news conference]].

[[File:FEMA - 42468 - Participants at Joint Field Office News Media Conference.jpg|thumb|A press kit is often given to members of the media as part of a media conference]]

==Terminology==

Traditionally the term, "press kit", referred to a set of documents, photographs and other relevant materials packaged together, and designed to be sent to a newspaper or magazine as part of an organisations [[Public relations]] or promotional program. Recently, as print media circulation and readership levels have been declining,&lt;ref&gt;World Association of Newspapers, ''World Press Trends'', 2015 Online: http://www.wan-ifra.org/reports/2015/10/01/world-press-trends-report-2015&lt;/ref&gt; marketing and PR people have begun using the broader term, "media kit", so that it now refers to any promotional material distributed to any media outlet.

A PR media kit should not be confused with an advertising media kit developed by a newspaper or magazine for distribution to prospective advertisers. Advertising media kits typically consist of documents outlining the print media's editorial philosophy, detailed profiles of the medium's audience, a rate-card and information about forthcoming special features.
[[File:Press kit photo by New Yorker Film, 1982. Photo by Nancy Wong.jpg|thumb|left|Marc Hayashi and Wood Moy on location in San Francisco's "Chan Is Missing," a film by Wayne Wang, 1981.]]
==Uses==
The press kit or media kit is a [[Public Relations]] (PR) staple, and an integral part of a company's media relations activities.&lt;ref name="Belch, G 2009, p.617"&gt;Belch, G, Belch, M.A, Kerr, G. and Powell, I., ''Advertising and Promotion Management: An Integrated Marketing Communication Perspective'', McGraw-Hill, Sydney, Australia, 2009, p. 617&lt;/ref&gt;

Press kits are typically used for:

[[File:Media Release - Port Colborne Bridge Closures.pdf|thumb|''A media kit often accompanies a media release'']]
* Product launches
* New company launch
* Mergers and acquisitions
* News conferences
* Announcements of special events, industry trade shows or exhibitions
* Accompany a press release or media release
* Notify the media of any newsworthy event within a company's sphere of activities

==Common components==
There is no universal guide to the elements that should be included in a press kit or media kit, but the following are common components:&lt;ref&gt;Donnelly, T., "How to Put Together a Press Kit," Inc.com., Online: http://www.inc.com/guides/2010/09/how-to-put-together-a-press-kit.html&lt;/ref&gt;
* Backgrounder with historical information on the company or individual.
* Fact sheet listing specific features, statistics, or benefits.
* Biographies of key executives, individuals, artists, etc.
* Past press coverage

* Media contact information (usually of a [[public relations]] department or spokesperson)
* A CD, DVD, software title, video, etc. as appropriate for the sender of the release
* Collateral advertising material, such as: postcard, flier, newspaper ad, etc.

===Band press kits===
Musicians, including orchestras, bands and choral groups use media kits when launching a new album or when performing at a special event.  [[Band (music)|Band]] press kits often have their own unique set of components, including:&lt;ref&gt;Cool, D., "The 8 Things that Should be in Every Band's Digital Press Kit," Bandzoogle, Online: https://bandzoogle.com/blog/the-8-things-that-should-be-in-every-band-s-digital-press-kit&lt;/ref&gt;
* Band biography / History of the band
* CD or DVD
* Video
* Photos – colour or monotone (monotone (black and white) for newspapers; colour for other media)
* Press articles/ reviews
* Notable achievements
* Contact information for the band's label, manager, publicist, other representative and links to social media pages
* Discography (all previous albums and/or singles released by the band)
* [Optional] Equipment list (included when the kit is to be sent to a music venue)

=={{anchor|EPK}}Electronic press kit (EPK)==
{{Redirect|EPK|the weapons manufacturer originally known as EPK|Pyrkal}}
An electronic press kit (EPK) is a press kit equivalent in electronic form. An EPK usually takes the form of a website or e-mail, though they are also known to exist in CD and DVD form. The first known EPK, as we know it today, premiered live on the web on January 8, 1995, and was invented and given the exact name electronic press kit or EPK by Andre Gray, the inventor of online music sales certifications and winner of The Johannes Gutenberg Inventor Prize. Gray's EPK featured a bio, audio clips, videos, photos, press, set list, basic technical requirements, and a calendar and featured R&amp;B singer and songwriter [[Aaron Hall (singer)|Aaron Hall]] as the first artist ever to have an EPK created on their behalf.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

===Distribution formats===
Many companies make their electronic press kits available via the corporate website, where kits are offered in PDF format. An electronic press kit can be provided in any of the following formats:
* CD
* DVD
* Video or audio cassette
* The Internet (e.g. E-mail, WWW, newsgroups, etc.)
* USB flash drive

===Contents===

The contents of an EPK media kit are similar to other types of media kit, but are likely to include a range of audio-visual material. Decisions about what to include in the EPK media kit will depend on the industry and target audience. As a general guide, an EPK in the music industry might contain the following:
* Biography
* Music clips (audio files, CD or DVD)
* High resolution press photos
* Forthcoming tour dates
* Promotional videos
* Offline website or website links,especially links to relevant social media and music websites
* Media reviews and interviews
* "RIYL" or "recommended if you like" list (list of artists in similar styles or genres)
* Contact information
* High resolution, colour photos or images of key executives, the company logo, products, etc.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5003">Within the field of [[clinical trial]]s, '''rating''' is the process by which a human evaluator subjectively judges the response of a patient to a [[medical treatment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Targum SD | title = Evaluating rater competency for CNS clinical trials | journal = Journal of Clinical Psychopharmacology | volume = 26 | issue = 3 | pages = 308–10 | date = June 2006 | pmid = 16702896 | doi = 10.1097/01.jcp.0000219049.33008.b7 | department = primary }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Khan A, Yavorsky WC, Liechti S, DiClemente G, Rothman B, Opler M, DeFries A, Jovic S | title = Assessing the sources of unreliability (rater, subject, time-point) in a failed clinical trial using items of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) | journal = Journal of Clinical Psychopharmacology | volume = 33 | issue = 1 | pages = 109–17 | date = February 2013 | pmid = 23277234 | doi = 10.1097/JCP.0b013e3182776ebe | department = primary }}
&lt;/ref&gt;  The rating can include more than one treatment response. The accessor is normally an independent observer other than the patient, but the accessor can also be the patient (a patient-reported outcome).  Furthermore, some clinical outcomes can only be assessed by the patient (a "private phenomena").&lt;ref name="pmid25263546"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Moustgaard H, Bello S, Miller FG, Hróbjartsson A | title = Subjective and objective outcomes in randomized clinical trials: definitions differed in methods publications and were often absent from trial reports | journal = Journal of Clinical Epidemiology | volume = 67 | issue = 12 | pages = 1327–34 | date = December 2014 | pmid = 25263546 | doi = 10.1016/j.jclinepi.2014.06.020 | department = review }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the evaluation is subjective, this can result in both [[Inter-rater reliability|inter-rater]] or [[intra-rater reliability]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Chin R, Lee BY | chapter = Chapter 4.5.3: Observer Variability | title = Principles and Practice of Clinical Trial Medicine | location = | publisher = | date = | pages = 72–74 | isbn = 978-0-08-055793-9 | chapter-url = https://books.google.se/books?id=HgmrI2r5eo4C&amp;lpg=PA72&amp;dq=intra%20and%20inter-observer%20variation%20clinical%20trials&amp;pg=PA73#v=onepage&amp;q=4.5.3&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; When conducting clinical trials, ensuring rating consistency is important, but can prove to be quite difficult to obtain. Studies dealing with such indications as pain, [[Mental illness|mental disease]] or mood are not able to easily track progress with physical or physiological testing, rather, verbal subjective human testing is used. This can allow for an array of differences in rating.

[[Blinded_experiment#Double-blind_trials|Blinded]] assessors who are not told which treatment group a patient belongs to have a significantly lower observer bias compared to non-blinded assessors.&lt;ref name="pmid23359047"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hróbjartsson A, Thomsen AS, Emanuelsson F, Tendal B, Hilden J, Boutron I, Ravaud P, Brorson S | title = Observer bias in randomized clinical trials with measurement scale outcomes: a systematic review of trials with both blinded and nonblinded assessors | journal = CMAJ : Canadian Medical Association Journal = Journal De l'Association Medicale Canadienne | volume = 185 | issue = 4 | pages = E201–11 | date = March 2013 | pmid = 23359047 | pmc = 3589328 | doi = 10.1503/cmaj.120744 | department = review }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid24448109"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hróbjartsson A, Thomsen AS, Emanuelsson F, Tendal B, Rasmussen JV, Hilden J, Boutron I, Ravaud P, Brorson S | title = Observer bias in randomized clinical trials with time-to-event outcomes: systematic review of trials with both blinded and non-blinded outcome assessors | journal = International Journal of Epidemiology | volume = 43 | issue = 3 | pages = 937–48 | date = June 2014 | pmid = 24448109 | doi = 10.1093/ije/dyt270 | department = review }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2093">In '''''S v Marx''''', an important case in [[South African criminal law]], the relationship of the appellant and his wife had deteriorated markedly during the course of their nineteen-year marriage. She had become [[Verbal abuse|verbally abusive]] and aggressive towards him, and humiliated him in public. On the evening in question, she had taunted and abused him. This, coupled with other factors, acted as a trigger for the appellant to shoot her. He was later convicted of the murder of his wife and sentenced to ten years' imprisonment.

On [[appeal]] against both conviction and sentence, the court held, that there was no merit in the appeal against conviction. At the time of the commission of the offence, however, the appellant had been acting under circumstances of severely [[diminished responsibility]], which were relevant to [[Sentence (law)|sentencing]].&lt;ref&gt;569d, 569h.&lt;/ref&gt;

The court, had it been sitting as a court of first instance, would have imposed a sentence strikingly different from the sentence imposed in the court ''a quo''. In the
circumstances of the case, having regard to the extent of the appellant's emotional disintegration, and the fact that he was acting at the time under circumstances of severely diminished responsibility, a sentence of correctional supervision would be appropriate.&lt;ref&gt;570f–g.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Deterrence (legal)|Deterrence]], either of the appellant or of others, was not an important factor, having regard to the highly unusual concatenation of events, and the extremely remote possibility of a recurrence. Neither was the case one which was clamant for retribution.&lt;ref&gt;572c–d.&lt;/ref&gt;

The court held, accordingly, that a correctional supervision order, coupled with stringent conditions, would be fair and just.&lt;ref&gt;572h.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Old Norse]], '''''seiðr''''' (sometimes anglicized as ''seidhr'', ''seidh'', ''seidr'', ''seithr'', ''seith'', or ''seid'') was a type of [[Magic (paranormal)|sorcery]] practiced in [[Vikings|Norse society]] during the [[Iron Age Scandinavia|Late Scandinavian Iron Age]]. Connected with [[Norse religion]], its origins are largely unknown, although it became gradually eroded following the [[Christianization of Scandinavia]]. Accounts of ''seiðr'' later made it into sagas and other literary sources, while further evidence has been unearthed by [[archaeology|archaeologists]]. Various scholars have debated the nature of ''seiðr'', some arguing that it was [[shamanism|shamanic]] in context, involving visionary journeys by its practitioners.

''Seiðr'' practitioners were of both sexes, although females are more widely attested, with such sorceresses being variously known as ''vǫlur'', ''seiðkonur'' and ''vísendakona''. There were also accounts of male practitioners, known as ''seiðmenn'', but in practising magic they brought a social taboo, known as ''[[ergi]]'', on to themselves, and were sometimes persecuted as a result. In many cases these magical practitioners would have had assistants to aid them in their rituals.

In pre-Christian [[Norse mythology]], ''seiðr'' was associated with both the god [[Odin|Oðinn]], a deity who was simultaneously responsible for war, poetry and sorcery, and the goddess [[Freyja]], a member of the [[Vanir]] who was believed to have taught the practice to the [[Æsir]].{{sfn|Price|2002|pp=91, 108}}

In the 20th century, adherents of various [[modern paganism|modern pagan]] [[new religious movement]]s adopted forms of magico-religious practice that include ''seiðr''. The practices of these contemporary ''seiðr''-workers have since been investigated by various academic researchers operating in the field of [[pagan studies]].

==Terminology and etymology==
{{Further|Witch (word)}}
Seiðr is believed to come from [[Proto-Germanic]] ''*saiðaz'', cognate with [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] ''saitas'', "sign, soothsaying" and [[Proto-Celtic]] ''*soito-'' "sorcery" (giving Welsh ''hud'', Breton ''hud'' "magic"), all derived from [[Proto-Indo-European]] ''*soi-to-'' "string, rope", ultimately from the Proto-Indo-European root ''*seH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;i-'' "to bind".&lt;ref&gt;Hyllested, Adam, 2010, 'The Precursors of Celtic and Germanic'. in SW Jamison, HC Melchert &amp; B Vine (eds), Proceedings of the Twenty-first Annual UCLA Indo-European Conference, Los Angeles, October 30th and 31st, 2009. Dr. Ute Hempen Verlag, Bremen, pp. 107-128.&lt;/ref&gt;

Related words in [[Old High German]] (see German [[:de:Saite|Saite]], used both in string instruments and in bows) and [[Old English]] refer to "cord, string," or "snare, cord, halter" and there is a line in verse 15 of the [[skald]]ic poem [[Ragnarsdrápa]] that uses seiðr in that sense.{{sfn|Heide|2006|pp=164-68}} However, it is not clear how this derivation relates to the practice of seiðr. It has been suggested that the use of a cord in attraction may be related to seiðr, where attraction is one element of the practice of seiðr magic described in Norse literature and with witchcraft in [[Scandinavian folklore]].{{sfn|Heide|2006|pp=164-68}} However, if seiðr involved "spinning charms", that would explain the [[distaff]], a tool used in spinning flax or sometimes wool, that appears to be associated with seiðr practice.{{sfn|Heide|2006|pp=164-68}}

Old English terms cognate with seiðr are ''siden'' and ''sidsa'', both of which are attested only in contexts that suggest that they were used by elves (''ælfe''); these seem likely to have meant something similar to seiðr.{{sfn|Hall|2004|pp=117—30}} Among the Old English words for practitioners of magic are ''wicca'' (m.) or ''wicce'' (f.), the [[Etymology|etymons]] of Modern English "[[witchcraft|witch]]".

Seiðr involved the incantation of [[spell (paranormal)|spell]]s ([[galdr|galðrar]], [[Grammatical number|sing]]. ''galðr'') and possibly a circular dance.&lt;ref name="Edred Thorsson"&gt;Edred Thorsson.&lt;/ref&gt;  Practitioners of seiðr were predominantly women ([[völva|vǫlva]] or ''seiðkona'' "seiðr woman"), although there were male practitioners (''seiðmaðr'' "seiðr-man") as well.

These female practitioners were religious leaders of the Viking community and usually required the help of other practitioners to invoke their deities, gods or spirits. The seiðr ritual required not just the powers of a female spiritual medium but of the spiritual participation of other women within the Norse community: it was a communal effort. As they are described in a number of other Scandinavian sagas, [[Saga of Erik the Red]] in particular, the female practitioners connected with the spiritual realm through chanting and prayer. Viking texts suggest that the seiðr ritual was used in times of inherent crisis, as a tool used in the process of seeing into the future, and for cursing and hexing one's enemies. With that said, it could have been used for great good or destructive evil, as well as for daily guidance.

==Old Norse literature==
[[File:Skjern-stenen.JPG|thumb|150px|right|The [[Skern Runestone]] has a curse regarding a 'siþi' or 'seiðr worker'.]]
In the [[Viking Age]], the practice of seid by men had connotations of unmanliness or effeminacy, known as [[ergi]], as its manipulative aspects ran counter to masculine ideal of forthright, open behavior.{{sfn|Hall|2007|p=148}} [[Freyja]] and perhaps some of the other goddesses of [[Norse mythology]] were seiðr practitioners,  as was Oðinn, a fact for which he is taunted by [[Loki]] in the [[Lokasenna]].

===Sagas===

====Eric the Red====
In the 13th century ''Saga of Eric the Red'', there was a ''seiðkona'' or ''vǫlva'' in [[Greenland]] named Thorbjǫrg ("Protected by Thor"). She wore a blue [[cloak]] and a headpiece of black lamb trimmed with white ermine, carried the symbolic [[distaff]] (''seiðstafr''), which was buried with her, and would sit on a high platform. As related in the Saga:

{|
| style="padding: 1pt 10pt;" |
En er hon kom um kveldit ok sá maðr, er móti henni var sendr, þá var hon svá búin, at hon hafði yfir sér tuglamöttul blán, ok var settr steinum allt í skaut ofan. Hon hafði á hálsi sér glertölur, lambskinnskofra svartan á höfði ok við innan kattarskinn hvít. Ok hon hafði {{Not a typo|staf}} í hendi, ok var á knappr. Hann var búinn með messingu ok settr steinum ofan um knappinn. Hon hafði um sik hnjóskulinda, ok var þar á skjóðupungr mikill, ok varðveitti hon þar í töfr sín, þau er hon þurfti til fróðleiks at hafa. Hon hafði á fótum kálfskinnsskúa loðna ok í þvengi langa ok á tinknappar miklir á endunum. Hon hafði á höndum sér kattskinnsglófa, ok váru hvítir innan ok loðnir.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.heimskringla.no/wiki/Eiríks_saga_rauða Eiríks saga rauða]'', Chapter 4.&lt;/ref&gt;
 | style="padding: 1pt 10pt;" |
Now, when she came in the evening, accompanied by the man who had been sent to meet her, she was dressed in such wise that she had a blue mantle over her, with strings for the neck, and it was inlaid with gems quite down to the skirt. On her neck she had glass beads. On her head she had a black hood of lambskin, lined with ermine. A staff she had in her hand, with a knob thereon; it was ornamented with brass, and inlaid with gems round about the knob. Around her she wore a girdle of soft hair (or belt of touch wood&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hrafnar.org/articles/kveldulf/spaecraft/|title=Spae-Craft, Seiðr, and Shamanism|first=Kveldúlfr|last=Gundarsson|website=www.hrafnar.org|accessdate=10 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and therein was a large skin-bag, in which she kept the talismans needful to her in her wisdom. She wore hairy calf-skin shoes on her feet, with long and strong-looking thongs to them, and great knobs of [[latten]] at the ends. On her hands she had gloves of ermine-skin, and they were white and hairy within.&lt;ref&gt;'[http://sagadb.org/eiriks_saga_rauda.en The Saga of Erik the Red]', Chapter 4.&lt;/ref&gt;
|
|}

====Other sagas====
As described by [[Snorri Sturluson]] in his [[Ynglinga saga]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.northvegr.org/lore/heim/001_02.php|title=Heimskringla — Ynglinga Saga, p. 2, sec. 7|website=www.northvegr.org|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100406041416/http://www.northvegr.org/lore/heim/001_02.php|archivedate=6 April 2010|deadurl=yes|accessdate=10 May 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; seiđr includes both divination and manipulative magic. It seems likely that the type of divination of seiđr-practitioners was generally distinct, by dint of an altogether more metaphysical nature, from the day-to-day auguries performed by the seers (''menn framsýnir'', ''menn forspáir'').

However, in the Icelandic saga [[Örvar-Oddr|Ǫrvar-Oddr]], the ''seiðkona'''s cloak is black but she also carries a distaff, which allegedly had the power of causing forgetfulness in one who is tapped three times on the cheek by it.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

==Practices==
Price noted that, because of its connection with ergi, seidr was undoubtedly located on 'one of society's moral and psychological borders'.&lt;ref name="Price 2002. p. 210"&gt;[[#Pri02|Price 2002]]. p. 210.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sex magic===
{{see also|Sex magic}}
Certain aspects of seiðr were sexual in nature, leading Neil Price to argue that it was very likely that it actually involved sexual acts.&lt;ref name="Price 2002. p. 210"/&gt;  Scholars have highlighted that the staffs have phallic epithets in various Icelandic sagas.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Pri02|Price 2002]]. p. 217.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mythology==

===Oðinn and ''Seiðr''===
[[Image:Tangelgarda Odin.jpg|thumb|The 7th century [[Tängelgårda stone]] shows Oðinn leading a troop of warriors all bearing rings. [[Valknut]] symbols are drawn beneath his horse, which is depicted with four legs.]]
British archaeologist [[Neil Price (archaeologist)|Neil Price]] noted that "the realm of sorcery" was present in Oðinn's many aspects.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Pri02|Price 2002]]. p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Lokasenna]], according to the Poetic Edda, Loki accuses Oðinn of practising seiðr, condemning it as an unmanly art (''ergi''). A justification for this may be found in the ''Ynglinga saga'', where Snorri opines that following the practice of seiðr rendered the practitioner weak and helpless.

One possible example of seiðr in Norse mythology is the prophetic vision given to Oðinn in the [[Völuspá|Vǫluspá]] by the [[Völva]] after whom the poem is named. Her vision is not connected explicitly with seiðr; however, the word occurs in the poem in relation to a character called Heiðr (who is traditionally associated with Freyja but may be identical with the Völva).{{sfn|McKinnell|2001|pp=394—417}} The interrelationship between the vǫlva in this account and the [[Norns]], the fates of Norse lore, is strong and striking.

Another noted mythological practitioner of seiðr was [[Gróa]], who attempted to assist [[Thor]], and who in the [[Svipdagsmál]] in a poem entitled [[Grógaldr]] "Gróa's spell" is summoned from beyond the grave.

===Freyja and ''Seiðr''===
Like Oðinn, the Norse goddess [[Freyja]] is also associated with 'seiðr' in the surviving literature. In the ''Ynglinga saga'' (c.1225), written by Icelandic poet [[Snorri Sturluson]], it is stated that ''seiðr'' had originally been a practice among the [[Vanir]], but that Freyja, who was herself a member of the Vanir, had introduced it to the [[Æsir]] when she joined them.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Pri02|Price 2002]]. p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt;

Freyja is identified in ''Ynglinga saga'' as an adept of the mysteries of seiðr, and it is said that it was she who taught it to Oðinn:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Dóttir Njarðar var Freyja. Hon var blótgyðja. Hon kenndi fyrst með Ásum seið, sem Vǫnum var títt.

"[[Njörðr|Njǫrðr]]’s daughter was Freyja. She presided over the sacrifice. It was she who first acquainted the Æsir with seiðr, which was customary among the Vanir."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Origins==
Since the publication of [[Jacob Grimm]]'s socio-linguistical [[Deutsches Wörterbuch]] (p.&amp;nbsp;638) in 1835, scholarship draws a Balto-Finnic link to seiðr, citing the depiction of its practitioners as such in the sagas and elsewhere, and linking seiðr to the practices of the [[noaidi]], the [[patrilineality|patrilineal]] shamans of the [[Sami people]]. However, Indo-European origins are also possible.{{sfn|Hall|2004|pp=121—122}} Note that the [[Finnish language|Finnish]] word ''seita''  and the [[Sami languages|Sami]] variants of the term ''sieidde'' refer to a human-shaped tree or a large and strangely-shaped stone or rock and do not necessarily reference magical power. There is a good case, however, that these words do derive ultimately from seiðr.{{sfn|Parpola|2004|pp=235–73}}

==Contemporary Paganism==
Contemporary Paganism, also referred to as Neo-Paganism, is an [[umbrella term]] used to identify a wide variety of new religious movements, particularly those influenced by the various pagan beliefs of premodern Europe.&lt;ref name="Carpenter 1996 40"&gt;[[#Car96|Carpenter 1996]]. p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lew04|Lewis 2004]]. p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Several of these contemporary pagan religions draw specifically on the original mediaeval religious beliefs and practices of Anglo-Saxon England as sources of inspiration, adopting such Anglo-Saxon deities as their own.

Seiðr is interpreted differently by different groups and practitioners, but usually taken to indicate altered consciousness or even total loss of physical control.{{sfn|Harvey|1997}} [[Diana L. Paxson]] and her group ''Hrafnar'' have attempted reconstructions of seiðr (particularly the oracular form) from historical material.{{sfn|Blain|2002|p=21}} [[Jan Fries]] regards seiðr as a form of "shamanic trembling", which he relates to "seething", used as a shamanic technique, the idea being his own and developed through experimentation.{{sfn|Fries|1996}} According to Blain, seiðr is an intrinsic part of spiritual practice connecting practitioners to the wider cosmology in British Germanic Neopaganism.{{sfn|Blain|2002|p=13}}

Shutterstock was founded in 2003 by [[Americans|American]] entrepreneur and computer programmer [[Jon Oringer]].&lt;ref name="hSchwartz" /&gt; Creating his own [[online marketplace]],&lt;ref name="Forbes-10-28-2013" /&gt; Oringer initially uploaded 30,000 of his own [[stock photo]]s and made them available via subscription,&lt;ref name="Forbes-10-28-2013" /&gt; with unlimited downloads and a monthly starting fee of US$49.&lt;ref name="Forbes-10-28-2013" /&gt; When demand exceeded his photo supply,&lt;ref name="Forbes-10-28-2013" /&gt; he became an agent&lt;ref name="Smart Money 02-04-2009" /&gt; and began hiring additional contributors.&lt;ref name="Forbes-10-28-2013" /&gt; Helping pioneer the subscription based [[microstock photography]] business model,&lt;ref name="Smart Money 02-04-2009" /&gt; Shutterstock claimed that it was the "largest subscription-based stock photo agency in the world" as of 2006, with 570,000 images in its collection.&lt;ref name="press-release-footage-announced" /&gt; Shutterstock branched into film in 2006 with the launch of Shutterstock Footage,&lt;ref name="press-release-footage-announced" /&gt; and by 2007, the company had 1.8 million photos.&lt;ref name="NYT-06-05-07" /&gt; [[Insight Venture Partners]] invested in the company that year.&lt;ref name="Forbes-10-28-2013" /&gt; Shutterstock expanded beyond subscriptions into a la carte pricing in August 2008, with its "On Demand" service removing daily download limits.&lt;ref name="press-release-on-demand" /&gt;

On September 23, 2009, Shutterstock announced that it had purchased [[Bigstock]], a rival credit-based [[microstock photography]] agency.&lt;ref name="CNET 9-23-2009" /&gt; ''[[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]]'' argued the deal put "Shutterstock on a competitive playing field with [[Getty Images|Getty]], whose [[iStock]]Photo is also credit-based."&lt;ref name="oFCOMPANY" /&gt; Shutterstock's CEO Jon Oringer stated the addition would "enable Shutterstock to better satisfy the diverse payment preferences of stock photo buyers worldwide."&lt;ref name="CNET 9-23-2009" /&gt; Shutterstock had 11 million royalty-free stock images by early 2010.&lt;ref name="statswebsitea" /&gt; In February 2011, Shutterstock announced a two-year partnership with the [[AIGA|American Institute of Graphic Arts (AIGA)]] to provide creative inspiration to its members.&lt;ref name="AIGA-press-release" /&gt; Claiming it licensed more images than "any other brand worldwide" in 2011,&lt;ref name="AIGA-press-release" /&gt; that November Shutterstock debuted Shutterstock for iPad, which it provided for free.&lt;ref name="the-next-web-11-03-11" /&gt;

=== Acquisitions and IPO (2012–2013) ===
With 200 million licensed image downloads as of February 2012,&lt;ref name="press-release-image-downloads" /&gt; by April 2012 the company had 18 million royalty-free stock images,&lt;ref name="statswebsitea" /&gt; which grew to 19 million the following month.&lt;ref name="lstockphoto" /&gt; Shutterstock Images LLC announced the Shutterstock Instant tool in May 2012, which displayed images in an interlocking mosaic to increase viewing speed.&lt;ref name="press-release-instant" /&gt; Shutterstock Instant was launched under the auspices of the newly formed Shutterstock Labs, which develops tools and interfaces for Shutterstock, among other projects.&lt;ref name="press-release-instant" /&gt;&lt;ref name="press-release-spectrum" /&gt; Also in May 2012, Shutterstock filed for an [[initial public offering]] on the New York Stock Exchange, which it completed on October 17, 2012 under the ticker SSTK.&lt;ref name="nyse-release" /&gt;&lt;ref name="s-1-report" /&gt; In November 2012, Shutterstock debuted a universal [[iOS]] application meant for [[iPhone]] and [[iPad]], among other devices.&lt;ref name="press-release-ios" /&gt;

Shutterstock, Inc. announced Spectrum, a new "image discovery tool," in March 2013.&lt;ref name="press-release-spectrum" /&gt; At the time, Shutterstock had 24 million licensable photos, vectors and illustrations in its portfolio.&lt;ref name="press-release-spectrum" /&gt; In August 2013, Shutterstock and [[Facebook]] announced a partnership to integrate Shutterstock's library within Facebook's Ad Creator, allowing advertisers to select from Shutterstock's images when creating ads.&lt;ref name="constineteccrunch" /&gt; At the time, Shutterstock was available in 20 languages including [[Thai language|Thai]], [[Korean language|Korean]], [[French language|French]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[German language|German]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]], and [[Japanese language|Japanese]].&lt;ref name="press-release-languages" /&gt;

=== Offset and new partnerships (2013–2014) ===
In September 2013, Shutterstock launched Offset, marketplace prioritizing high end curated photos from established artists.&lt;ref name="tomchereder" /&gt; A few months later, it launched its first [[Android (operating system)|Android]] app.&lt;ref name="the-next-web-12-10-13" /&gt; In October 2013, Shutterstock opened offices in [[Berlin, Germany]].&lt;ref name="oprnrutoprsn" /&gt; At the time, Shutterstock stated it served 750,000 customers, with 30 percent of those customers in Europe.&lt;ref name="oprnrutoprsn" /&gt; Shutterstock's shares had reached a $2.5 billion market value by the fall of 2013,&lt;ref name="Forbes-10-28-2013" /&gt; while revenue for 2013 was US$235 million.&lt;ref name="motleyfoo" /&gt;

In March 2014, Shutterstock acquired Webdam, a provider of online [[digital asset management]] software.&lt;ref name="lardinois" /&gt; Also in March 2014, Shutterstock relocated its headquarters to the [[Empire State Building]].&lt;ref name="yakwicza" /&gt; In May 2014, Shutterstock and [[Salesforce]] partnered to integrate Shutterstock's image library into Salesforce's Social Studio.&lt;ref name="syonyha" /&gt;  Shutterstock debuted its Palette tool in July 2014, a "multi-color image discovery tool."&lt;ref name="creativebloqa" /&gt; Shutterstock announced it had surpassed 2 million video clips on September 2, 2014.&lt;ref name="press-release-video-count" /&gt; Shortly afterwards it revealed a new app meant to help contributors with uploading and categorizing photos.&lt;ref name="samosstruck" /&gt; Shutterstock's revenue was $328 million in 2014, an increase of 39% from 2013.&lt;ref name="hSchwartz" /&gt; In 2014, Shutterstock paid "over $83 million to its roughly 80,000 contributors."&lt;ref name="hSchwartz" /&gt;

=== Recent developments (2015–2016) ===
In January 2015, Shutterstock acquired both Rex Features, Europe's largest independent photo press agency, and PremiumBeat, a stock music and sound effects service.&lt;ref name="acquiresrex" /&gt; The Rex acquisition was estimated at $33 million,&lt;ref name="nCRAINS" /&gt; while PremiumBeat was purchased for $32 million.&lt;ref name="acquiresrex" /&gt; [[Penske Media Corporation]] formed a partnership with Shutterstock in June 2015 to create and license entertainment and fashion images. According to the terms of the deal, by 2016 Shutterstock would have an exclusive right and license to PMC's archive,&lt;ref name="tochallenggetty" /&gt;  which included magazines such as ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', ''[[Women's Wear Daily]],''&lt;ref name="nCRAINS" /&gt; and ''[[Deadline Hollywood|Deadline]]''.&lt;ref name="hSchwartz" /&gt; ''Crain's'' wrote that with the partnership, "Shutterstock, a provider of stock imagery and music tracks, is stepping into the world of red carpets and fashion runways—and taking a key provider of fashion and entertainment photos and video away from archrival Getty Images."&lt;ref name="nCRAINS" /&gt;

By March 2016, the company had "over 100,000 contributors," with around 70 million images and 4 million video clips available for licensing and sale.&lt;ref name="fapa" /&gt; That month Shutterstock announced it would be distributing material from the [[Associated Press]] in the United States, with the deal to last 3 years and cover 30 million photos and around 2 million videos. The photos were expected to go live in April.&lt;ref name="fapa" /&gt; According to ''[[Entrepreneur (magazine)|Entrepreneur]]'', Shutterstock also had an "active customer base of 1.4 million people in 150 countries."&lt;ref name="bestentrej" /&gt;

In July, 2016, Shutterstock revealed a partnership with [[Google]] advertising products including [[adsense]], [[adwords]], and [[admob]].&lt;ref name="annefreier" /&gt; The integration allows marketers creating Google ads to directly access Shutterstock images and track ad performance via the Shutterstock API.&lt;ref name="rachelpower" /&gt;

In May, 2018, IBM's Watson Content Hub officially announced its partnership with Shutterstock which will be made available in July, 2018.&lt;ref name="kylewiggers" /&gt; The Watson Content Hub is a [[content management system]] (CMS) that allows marketers to create content using the IBM Watson AI search tool. See [[Watson (computer)]].&lt;ref name="ibmwatson" /&gt; According to Richard Hearn, chief revenue officer, "Now customers can use AI to quickly sift through Shutterstock’s library, which includes millions of professional quality content, and create and launch campaigns that resonate with their target audiences and move them to take action."&lt;ref name="kylewiggers" /&gt;

== Facilities and staff ==
Shutterstock is headquartered in [[New York City]]'s [[Silicon Alley]]. In October 2013 Shutterstock opened its new European headquarters in [[Berlin, Germany]] in the [[Kulturbrauerei]],&lt;ref name="oprnrutoprsn" /&gt; and by March 2014, Shutterstock had additional offices in [[Amsterdam]], [[Chicago]], [[Denver]], [[London]], [[Montréal]], [[Paris]] and [[San Francisco]].&lt;ref name="oprnrutoprsn" /&gt; After maintaining its New York headquarters for years in a [[Wall Street]] office,&lt;ref name="Forbes-10-28-2013" /&gt; in March 2014 Shutterstock relocated into the [[Empire State Building]].&lt;ref name="yakwicza" /&gt; According to ''[[Inc. (magazine)|Inc.]]'', the office was selected with the goal of decreasing commute times for New York employees.&lt;ref name="yakwicza" /&gt; The new location was built with no private offices, instead with 23 "pop-in rooms" for private meetings and conferences when needed.&lt;ref name="yakwicza" /&gt;

After its founding in 2003 with CEO [[Jon Oringer]] as the sole employee, by 2007 Shutterstock had grown to 30 people. In 2010 Oringer hired [[Thilo Semmelbauer]] as [[Chief operating officer|COO]], who had previously worked with [[TheLadders.com]] and [[Weight Watchers]].&lt;ref name="Forbes-10-28-2013" /&gt; With 295 employees as of October 2013,&lt;ref name="Forbes-10-28-2013" /&gt; that had grown to 700 employees as of 2016.&lt;ref name="builtiny" /&gt; In 2014, ''[[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]]'' published an article featuring Shutterstock as an example of a successful "[[intrapreneur]]"-reliant company, touting the company's "[[hackathons]]" for fostering staff creativity. Explains ''Fast Company,'' "the most obvious benefit of intrapreneurship is the ability to pursue more opportunities, allowing Shutterstock to test boundaries and experiment with offshoot products that can keep their core consumer base from turning to a competitor for their needs."&lt;ref name="pencouraged" /&gt;

== Business model ==
Shutterstock licenses media for online download on behalf of photographers, designers, illustrators, [[videographers]] and musicians,&lt;ref name="Forbes-10-28-2013" /&gt; maintaining a library of almost 200 million [[royalty-free]] [[stock photos]], [[vector graphics]], and [[illustrations]].&lt;ref name="press-release-image-count" /&gt; Shutterstock also has 10 million [[video clips]] and music clips in its portfolio.&lt;ref name="press-release-video-count" /&gt;  While Shutterstock currently has several payment models, ''[[The Atlantic]]'' wrote in 2012 that Shutterstock "pioneered the subscription approach to stock photo sales, allowing customers to download images in bulk rather than à la carte."&lt;ref name="lstockphoto" /&gt; ''The Atlantic'' further wrote that Shutterstock is "a web community in the manner of a [[Facebook]] or a [[Twitter]] or a [[Pinterest]], with its value relying almost entirely on the enthusiasms of its contributors."&lt;ref name="lstockphoto" /&gt;

{| class="toccolours" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 2em; font-size: 85%; background: offwhite; color: black; width: 20em; max-width: 40%;" cellspacing="5"
| style="text-align: left;" | "Shutterstock is e-commerce with a twist, and its success depends on its contributors' ability to predict, and then provide, products that its subscribers will want to buy."
|-
| style="text-align: left;" | — ''[[The Atlantic]]'' (May 18, 2012)&lt;ref name="lstockphoto" /&gt;
|}
With potential contributors able to apply to the site for free,&lt;ref name="hSchwartz" /&gt; Shutterstock has a team of reviewers "charged with ensuring editorial consistency and quality."&lt;ref name="lstockphoto" /&gt; As of 2016, if one of ten of a photographer's pictures are accepted, then they become a Shutterstock contributor.&lt;ref name="oenappaorved" /&gt; As of 2011, only around 20 percent of applicants were approved, and "less than 60 percent of all the images uploaded by those approved contributors were ultimately put up on the site."&lt;ref name="lstockphoto" /&gt; Once approved, contributors can begin uploading their work through the website. They supply keywords, categorize the images, and submit them to the "inspection queue", where images are examined for quality, usefulness and copyright and trademark laws. Each time an image is downloaded, the photographer receives a flat rate.&lt;ref name="NYT-06-05-07" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Forbes-09-02-2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Time Out NY 1-22-09" /&gt; Explains [[Vice (magazine)|VICE]], "photographers retain copyright over their images, but Shutterstock is given full permission to market, display, and license the image to the customers on their site without final approval from the photographer."&lt;ref name="hSchwartz" /&gt; As of March 2015, contributors added around 50,000 new images daily, and Shutterstock had paid around $250 million to contributors since its founding. In 2014, it paid $80 million to contributors.&lt;ref name="press-release-image-count" /&gt;

== Products ==
=== Shutterstock film and music ===
Shutterstock began selling [[Stock footage|stock video]] in February 2006. Shutterstock Footage operates similarly to their image library, offering video clips by subscription or on a per-clip basis.&lt;ref name="press-release-footage-announced" /&gt; As of 2014, Shutterstock Footage contained around 2 million royalty-free video clips.&lt;ref name="press-release-video-count" /&gt; Shutterstock Music debuted later, with new content submittable by contributors.&lt;ref name="SMUSIC" /&gt;

=== Shutterstock apps ===
Shutterstock for iPad was launched in November 2011,&lt;ref name="the-next-web-11-03-11" /&gt; and in May 2012 the app received a [[Webby Award]] for People's Voice in the tablet app category for utilities and services.&lt;ref name="webby-2012" /&gt; Shutterstock for iPad was followed in 2012 by a universal [[iOS]] app,&lt;ref name="press-release-ios" /&gt; which by 2013 had been downloaded 650,000 times. The iOS app originally lacked the ability to download images, with that functionality added later.&lt;ref name="the-next-web-12-10-13" /&gt;  The universal iOS app also included new features for Shutterstock, including the ability to filter image searches by color.&lt;ref name="press-release-ios" /&gt; Shutterstock debuted an [[Android (operating system)|Android]] App in 2013,&lt;ref name="the-next-web-12-10-13" /&gt; and in September 2014, Shutterstock launched an app dedicated to its contributors, both available for iOS and Android. The app allows contributors to upload, keyword and categorize new images.&lt;ref name="samosstruck" /&gt;

=== Shutterstock Labs ===
In 2012, Shutterstock launched Shutterstock Labs, a lab for "exploratory tools and products."&lt;ref name="press-release-spectrum" /&gt; In May 2012, Shutterstock Images LLC announced the Shutterstock Instant tool, which according to the company was inspired by Shutterstock for iPad. The interface displays images in an interlocking mosaic view, allowing users to view more photos in less time.&lt;ref name="press-release-instant" /&gt; Shutterstock Instant was made available on the Shutterstock Labs website.&lt;ref name="press-release-instant" /&gt;&lt;ref name="press-release-spectrum" /&gt; The prototype for the search tool Spectrum was launched on March 21, 2013. With development in-house by Shutterstock Labs, the tool "indexes hexagram data to yield search results by color."&lt;ref name="press-release-spectrum" /&gt; In July 2014, Shutterstock launched Palette, which allows users to add colors to the terms of the search, in addition to keywords.&lt;ref name="creativebloqa" /&gt;

=== Offset ===

In September 2013 Shutterstock launched Offset, a stock photography marketplace that focuses on high-quality curated images from established artists.&lt;ref name="tomchereder" /&gt; Described as a "high-end imagery service,"&lt;ref name="lardinois" /&gt; the photo marketplace is operated by an independent company, which in turn is owned by Shutterstock.&lt;ref name="hSchwartz" /&gt; Explains ''[[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]]'' in 2014, Offset "was created to serve the adjacent needs of existing customers who were looking for premium imagery for billboards, book covers, and high-profile signage for a fraction of the cost of a custom photo shoot."&lt;ref name="pencouraged" /&gt; At its launch, Offset had 45,000 images from around 100 artists and publishers such as ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]''.&lt;ref name="tomchereder" /&gt;

=== Computer vision ===
Shutterstock has developed a number of tools utilizing a "[[convolutional neural network]]" that it created&lt;ref name="bestentrej" /&gt; to help with [[reverse image search]] technology.&lt;ref name="esayerss" /&gt; The network is "essentially a computer system that is trained to recognize images – there are millions of specific items such as cats, bicycles, the night sky – and pull up the most relevant photos."&lt;ref name="bestentrej" /&gt; The network was dubbed [[computer vision]] by Shutterstock, and it "breaks down the key components of a photo numerically, drawing from its pixel data instead of metadata that is pulled from those tags and keywords."&lt;ref name="bestentrej" /&gt;

{{Blockquote|"So a lot of image databases fill in those gaps with user behavior. If people searching the words 'bike' and 'fence' download a particular image more often, that one probably contains those two things in it.... [[Computer vision]] [like Shutterstock's] can change all that by eliminating the need for keywords in the first place. Using a series of algorithms, a model can progressively survey each pixel in an image to pick out different features in it—the color, the shapes, the sharpness of the angles. Each calculation is a layer of the [[deep learning]] network."|''[[Popular Science]]'' (March 10, 2016)&lt;ref name="kpopsi" /&gt;}}

On March 10, 2016, Shutterstock debuted its Reverse Image Search tool. According to ''Entrepreneur,'' with the tool "users can upload an image, either from Shutterstock or another source, and the tool will call up images that look like and have a similar feel to the original photo."&lt;ref name="bestentrej" /&gt; The reverse image search allows users to not just search by keywords, but to also find images based on "color schemes, mood, or shapes."&lt;ref name="esayerss" /&gt; Later that month, Shutterstock also debuted its Similar Search and Discovery tools,&lt;ref name="bestentrej" /&gt; with the "similar search" option provided beneath photos on the Shutterstock website.&lt;ref name="esayerss" /&gt;

A '''soul eater''' is a folklore figure in the traditional belief systems of some African peoples, notably the [[Hausa people]] of [[Nigeria]] and [[Niger]].

Belief in soul eaters is related to traditional folk beliefs in [[witchcraft]], [[zombie]]s, and related phenomena. The soul eater is supposedly able to consume an individual's spirit, causing a wasting disease that can be fatal; "the soul eater is a classical form of the cannibalistic witch".&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, Pamela J., and Andrew Strathern. ''Witchcraft, Sorcery, Rumors and Gossip.'' Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 2004; p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt; In Hausa belief, the desire and capacity for the practice, termed ''maita,'' is rooted in special stones kept in a person's stomach. The trait allegedly can be inherited from one's parents, or can be acquired from an existing practitioner. The soul eater can take the form of a dog or other animal in pursuit of his or her practice&lt;ref&gt;Schmoll, Pamela G. "Black Stomachs, Beautiful Stones: Soul-Eating among Hausa in Niger." In: ''Modernity and Its Malcontents: Ritual and Power in Postcolonial Africa.'' Edited by Jean Comaroff. Chicago, University of Chicago Press, 1993; pp. 193-220.&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;mdash;a belief that connects with the beliefs in [[Werewolf|werewolves]], [[werecat]]s, [[selkie]]s, and other were-creatures and human/animal beings found in world folklore.

Another belief about soul eaters is that they are men who were cursed by [[witch]]es and have to eat the souls of humans to live their lives. After the soul eater devours a victim's soul, the victim disappears as dust.

The belief survived into African-American folklore in the United States and the Caribbean region. Related beliefs can be found in other traditional African cultures, like the [[Fulbe]]&lt;ref&gt;Regis, Helen A. ''Fulbe Voices: Marriage, Islam, and Medicine in Northern Cameroon.'' Boulder, CO, Westview Press, 2003; p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Serer people|Serer]],&lt;ref&gt;Galvan, Dennis Charles. ''The State Must Be Our Master of Fire: How Peasants Craft Culturally Sustainable Development in Senegal.'' Berkeley, University of California Press, 2004; p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt; and in cultures outside of Africa too&amp;mdash;such as in the tribes of the [[Mount Hagen]] area of [[Papua New Guinea]].&lt;ref&gt;Stewart and Strathern, p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''hix'' or ''ix'' of the [[Maya civilization|Maya]] and related peoples is a comparable figure; the [[Pipils|Pipil]] term ''teyollocuani'' translates literally as "soul eater".

Some traditional religions, from that of the [[ancient Egypt]]ians to the [[Chickasaw]], [[Choctaw]], and [[Natchez people|Natchez]], contain figures whose names have been translated into English as "soul eater". These mythological figures, however, are spiritual and not human beings, and so are distinctly different from Hausa and comparable beliefs.

The traditional belief in soul-eaters has been adopted by a range of modern [[horror fiction]] and [[fantasy]] writers, contemporary songwriters, and [[anime]] and [[video game]] creators for their own uses.

'''Staten Island Museum''' (officially the '''Staten Island Institute of Arts &amp; Sciences''') is [[Staten Island]]’s oldest cultural institution, and the only remaining general interest [[museum]] in [[New York City]]. 

Founded in 1881 by fourteen of New York City’s first “environmental activists”, the Staten Island Museum houses artifacts and specimens from ancient to contemporary periods. This “mini-Smithsonian” is rich with arts, natural sciences and local history.

The museum’s holdings are formally organized into three main collections: Natural Sciences, Fine Art, and History Archives &amp; Library. The natural science collections encompass over 500,000 botanical, biological, anthropological and mineral specimens including bird nests and eggs, mounted animals, fossils, shells, and a significant collection of insects, including important type specimens. Based upon a 19th-century model, the art collection includes works spanning prehistory to the modern period, with representations of diverse world cultures from both the Western and Non-Western traditions. The historical collections include a library, maps and atlases, early films, audio recordings, photographs, historical objects, ephemera and archival documents reaching back to the 17th century.

== History ==
The Staten Island Museum was founded in 1881 as a private society of local naturalists and antiquarians who pooled their personal collections to create the public museum in 1908. [[William T. Davis]], along with [[Nathaniel Lord Britton]], Arthur Hollick,&lt;ref&gt;[http://sciweb.nybg.org/science2/libr/finding_guide/hollick1.asp Records of the Herbarium (RG 4) CHARLES ARTHUR HOLLICK RECORDS (1873-1979)]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles W. Leng]], are some of the founding fathers who also contributed significantly to the city’s nature preserve,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rpts.tamu.edu/pugsley/Britton.htm Cornelius Amory Pugsley Silver Medal Award, 1929] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100616075438/http://www.rpts.tamu.edu/pugsley/Britton.htm |date=2010-06-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; research and education. The museum focused on environmental protection and has participated in the preservation of High Rock Park and the William T. Davis Wildlife Refuge. Since 1908, the staff has conducted annual bird counts together with the Audubon Society. In 1909, the Section of Art was organized, and in 1919 the Staten Island Institute of Arts &amp; Sciences was incorporated to reflect the broader mission which also includes local history. 

The museum has been called a "Mini Smithsonian" because of the breadth of its collections, and is based on a 19th-century model of creating within one's own community the complete resources for a cultural education. As a general interest museum, it is one of the last intact examples of the first type of public museum in America, and today serves a diverse audience of 80,000 people annually, with the goal of providing cross-disciplinary exhibitions for a wide cross-section of visitors. 

As the oldest cultural organization on Staten Island, the museum has been instrumental in the founding of many other cultural organizations in the area. These include the [[New York Botanical Garden]] (the institute's co-founder [[Nathaniel Lord Britton]] became its first director), the [[Staten Island Zoo]] (originally the Staten Island Zoological Society, a Section of the Museum in 1933), the [[Staten Island Historical Society]] (running [[Historic Richmond Town]]), and the Staten Island Children's Museum. The museum also greatly impacted Staten Island's environment, contributing to the preservation of the [[Staten Island Greenbelt|Greenbelt]] and the establishment of other environmental organizations.

== Current mission ==
It is the mission of the Staten Island Museum to document, research, preserve, collect, interpret and exhibit significant objects and themes in the areas of natural science, art and local history, with the goal of educating, celebrating and enriching the community of Staten Island in particular, and the New York metropolitan region in general.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.statenislandmuseum.org/articles/id-79-cPath-49/Mission+&amp;+History.html Mission of the Museum]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Collections ==

=== Art ===
The Museum’s art collection ranges from ancient Egyptian sculpture, to Renaissance paintings, to 19th century Hudson River School landscapes of Staten Island and New York Harbor, to 21st-century abstract art, photography and new media. It is the only museum actively collecting works by contemporary Staten Island artists. Its collections include American landscape paintings, Old Master prints, historic costume pieces and costume accessories, African sculpture and masks, Egyptian, Greek and Roman antiquities, Japanese prints, Pre-Columbian ceramics, ancient and modern Native American artifacts, English and American silver, and both Western and Non-Western objects of vertu, for example collections of Chinese snuff bottles, carved smoking pipes, and pocket watches, the bequests of local benefactor-collectors. It has a group of Samuel H. Kress Italian Renaissance paintings, and several complementary small 19th-century Renaissance-revival bronzes. There are important 19th–20th-century paintings featuring Staten Island and New York Harbor, fine 19th and 20th-century portraits, and works by prominent local contemporary artists. Examples of traditional representational art in the Staten Island Museum’s permanent collection include prints by Rembrandt, Goya, Piranesi and Audubon, paintings by Cropsey, Moran, Alma-Tadema, Giovanni di Paolo and Pordenone, sculpture by Hiram Powers and Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney. There are Japanese prints by Hiroshige, Hokusai, Utamaro and Kunisada. The Modern Art collection includes works by John Sloane, Guy Pene du Bois, George Bellows, Chagall, Leger, Maillol, Andy Warhol, Philip Pearlstein, Isabel Bishop, Peter Max, Donald Judd and the folk artist Clementine Hunter. Over 150 women artists are represented in the Staten Island Museum’s holdings.

=== History ===
The museum has over half a million items in the local History Collection, including authentic land grants with the wax seals of [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]] (1674) and [[King William III]] (1696) as well as a 1776 military document signed by [[William Howe, 5th Viscount Howe|William Howe]], Commander in Chief of the British Armies.

=== Natural Science ===
The Museum houses a 130-year comprehensive record of the changing biodiversity of the New York metro area, fully documented with specimens, including specimens of birds and mammals, a collection of fish, amphibians and reptiles preserved in alcohol, 500,000 mounted insects, and 25,000 plants preserved in the herbarium.

=== Current exhibitions ===

==== Remember the Mastodon: Diversity &amp; Preservation ====
Remember the Mastodon is about the hard facts of extinction, the wonder of enduring species, the importance of bio-diversity and the challenge of preservation. Includes fossils, lost bird species, and a full-size replica of a Mastodon emerging through the wall! Visit the Museum opening weekend to help name the newest addition to the Museum team! 

==== The Wall of Insects ====
A display of over 150 beetles, cicadas, butterflies and moths from the permanent collection.

==== Staten Island SEEN ====
The exhibition traces this borough’s unique history and landscape from the 17th century to the present. These works are made by amateur and professional artists, working in a broad range of styles and materials from ink drawing to anaglyph 3-D video.

After a successful run of one year, about half of our inaugural exhibition, Staten Island SEEN has been taken down to make way for our latest offering, Infinite Compassion. You can still view parts of Staten Island SEEN on the second floor in the Elizabeth Egbert Gallery.

==== Opening the Treasure Box: Bringing the World Home ====
Presenting art objects spanning 4,000 years of artistic endeavor gathered from five continents: Africa, Asia, Europe, North and South America. Countries represented include Germany, Greece, India, Japan, Liberia, Mexico, Nigeria, Peru, and the United States. The oldest piece is an Egyptian funerary statuette of a striding man, dating from 2,000 BCE.

==== From Farm to City  ====
A glimpse into Staten Island’s unique history, its people, and the themes that resonate as collective truths on this unusual island using images and historic documents, audio interviews, and digital collections. This exhibition strives to reunite Islanders with their past and share the evolving story of New York City’s Borough of Parks with visitors. From Farm to City: Staten Island 1661–2012 was created by the Museum of the City of New York. The exhibition focused on land-use on Staten Island. This legacy exhibition focuses on the people and themes that define the Island throughout history.

== Operations at Snug Harbor ==
[[File:Staten Island Museum.jpg|thumb|Building A, Snug Harbor]]
Staten Island’s "hometown" museum has consolidated its collection to the Staten Island Museum at Snug Harbor. A state of the art LEED certified building opened to the public as of September 2015. In addition, the Museum operates its Art Conservation Studio and the Staten Island History Center &amp; Archives at [[Snug Harbor Cultural Center]], joining other cultural institutions at the site. The museum has transformed from the 19th-century model of a museum as a "cabinet of curiosities", into a fully realized 21st-century institution that is accessible, diverse, technologically advanced, and demonstrates leadership in collections management, exhibitions, education and public programming.

The new museum, on the Snug Harbor Campus, is the first federal historic landmark on Staten Island designed to achieve [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED Gold]] certification, including [[geo-thermal]] heating and cooling. The mainly city-funded ($23 million) renovation of Building A added over {{convert|25000|sqft|m2}}, with additional space to follow in Building B (Bio-Diversity) in 2022. 

The Museum displays 'Staten Island Scene/Seen', a new interpretation of Staten Island across three centuries, including commissioned works by contemporary artists and featuring Hudson River School landscape paintings by [[Jasper Cropsey]] and [[Edward Moran]] from the museum's collection. 

In addition, a life-size replica of a [[mastodon]] greets visitors as they explore the museum, a creature that once roamed the hills of Staten Island as evidenced by local discoveries held in the museum's fossil collection on display in the new lobby.

'''System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM)''' is a standard for automating the exchange of user identity information between identity domains, or IT systems.

For example, as a company hires and fires employees, they are added and removed from the company's electronic employee [[Directory service|directory]]. SCIM could be used to automatically add/delete (or, [[Provisioning#User provisioning|provision]]/de-provision) accounts for those users in external systems such as [[Google Apps for Work]], [[Office 365]], or [[Salesforce.com]]. Then, a new user account would exist in the external systems for each new employee, and the user accounts for former employees might no longer exist in those systems.

In addition to simple user-record management (creating &amp; deleting), SCIM can also be used to share information about user attributes, attribute schema, and group membership. Attributes could range from user contact information to group membership. Group membership or other attribute values are generally used to manage user permissions. Attribute values and group assignments can change, adding to the challenge of maintaining the relevant data across multiple identity domains.&lt;ref name="SCIM-19"&gt;{{cite book |author = Internet Engineering Task Force, Network Working Group|title = System for Cross-Domain Identity Management: Core Schema|version = Draft 19|date = May 11, 2015|url = http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-scim-core-schema-19|accessdate = 2015-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The SCIM standard has grown in popularity and importance, as organizations use more SaaS tools.&lt;ref name="SCIMming" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SailPoint"&gt;{{cite press release | title = Identity Management Companies To Demonstrate Simple Cloud Identity Management (SCIM) Specification at Internet Identity Workshop (IIW) | publisher = SailPoint | date = October 18, 2011 | url = https://www.sailpoint.com/news/identity-management-companies-to-demonstrate-simple-cloud-identity-manageme | accessdate = May 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large organization can have hundreds or thousands of hosted applications (internal and external) and related servers, databases and file shares that require user provisioning. Without a standard connection method, companies must write custom software connectors to join these systems and their IdM system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Grizzle | first = Kelly | title = SCIM: Provisioning users, killing connectors | journal = SecureID News | publisher = SecureID | date = March 10, 2014 | url = http://www.secureidnews.com/news-item/scim-provisioning-users-killing-connectors/  | accessdate = May 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SCIM uses a standardised [[API]] through [[REST]] with data formatted in [[JSON]] or [[XML]].&lt;ref name="SCIM-19" /&gt;

==History==
The first version, SCIM 1.0, was released in 2011 by a SCIM standard working group organized under the Open Web Foundation.&lt;ref name="simplecloud"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.simplecloud.info/#overview|title = SCIM Overview|accessdate = May 17, 2015|website = SimpleCloud.info| publisher = Simple Cloud Identity Management }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, it was transferred to the [[IETF]], and the current standard, SCIM 2.0 was released as [[Request for Comments|IETF RFC]] in 2015.&lt;ref name=SCIMming&gt;{{cite web |last= Wilson |first= Neil |id= (link: [https://www.unboundid.com/blog/author/neil-wilson neil-wilson]) |title= SCIMming along... |publisher= UnboundID blog |date= June 22, 2011 |url= https://www.unboundid.com/blog/2011/06/22/scimming-along |accessdate= May 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Internet Engineering Task Force, Network Working Group |title= System for Cross-Domain Identity Management: Core Schema 1.1 | version= Version 1.1 |date= August 2, 2012 |url= https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-scim-core-schema-01 |accessdate= 2015-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SCIM 2.0 was completed in September 2015 and is published as IETF RFCs 7643&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7643 |title= System for Cross-domain Identity Management: Core Schema |date= September 2015 |website = ietf.org |publisher= Internet Engineering Task Force }}&lt;/ref&gt; and 7644.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7644 |title= System for Cross-domain Identity Management: Protocol |date= September 2015 |website= ietf.org |publisher= Internet Engineering Task Force }}&lt;/ref&gt; A use-case document is also available as RFC7642.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7642 |title= System for Cross-domain Identity Management: Definitions, Overview, Concepts, and Requirements |date= September 2015 |website= ietf.org |publisher= Internet Engineering Task Force }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The standard has been implemented in various [[Identity management|IdM]] software.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url = http://www.simplecloud.info/#implementations|title= Known SCIM implementations |date= |website= SimpleCloud.info |publisher= Simple Cloud Identity Management }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The standard was initially called '''''Simple Cloud Identity Management''''' (as it is still called this in some places), but the name was officially changed to ''System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM)'' when the IETF adopted it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Hunt |first= Phil |title= Standards Corner: SCIM and the Shifting Enterprise Identity Center of Gravity |website= Oracle Fusion Middleware (blog) |publisher= Oracle |date= February 27, 2014 |url = https://blogs.oracle.com/fusionmiddleware/entry/standards_corner_scim_and_the | accessdate= May 17, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Interoperability]] was demonstrated in October, 2011, at the Cloud Identity Summit, an [[Identity management|IAM]] industry conference. There, user accounts were provisioned and de-provisioned across separate systems using SCIM standards, by a collection of [[Identity management system|IdM software]] vendors: Okta, Ping Identity, SailPoint, Technology Nexus and UnboundID.&lt;ref name="SailPoint" /&gt; In March 2012, at IETF 83 in Paris, [[Interoperability]] tests continued by the same vendors, joined by [[Salesforce.com]], BCPSoft, WSO2, Gluu, and Courion (nine companies, total).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Logistics and attendee info for the March 20012 SCIM interop event | website = SCIM, Simple Cloud Identity Management | date = April 26, 2012 | url = https://code.google.com/p/scim/wiki/FirstInteropEvent | accessdate = May 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SCIM is not the first standard for exchanging user data, but it builds on prior standards (e.g. SPML, [[Portable Contacts|PortableContacts]], [[vCard]]s, and [[LDAP Data Interchange Format|LDAP directory services]]) in an attempt to be a simpler and more widely adopted solution for cloud services providers.&lt;ref name="Ping-SCIM"&gt;{{cite web| title = SCIM: How It Works| website = PingIdentity.com| url = https://www.pingidentity.com/en/resources/articles/scim.html| format = Article| accessdate = May 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SCIM-19-intro"&gt;{{cite book | author= Internet Engineering Task Force, Network Working Group | title = System for Cross-Domain Identity Management: Core Schema | version = Draft 19 | date = May 11, 2015 | section = Section 1, Introduction | url = http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-scim-core-schema-19#section-1 | accessdate = 2015-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Google]], [[Salesforce.com]], [[Cisco]], SailPoint and Ping Identity have been considered as the initial driving forces to create this open standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = SCIMing the provisioning landscape|url = http://www.networkworld.com/article/2202653/access-control/sciming-the-provisioning-landscape.html|accessdate = 2015-06-23|first = Dave|last = Kearns|date = 2011-04-29|publisher = Network World}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Cambridge Guide to English Usage''''' by [[Pam Peters]] is a [[usage dictionary]], giving an up-to-date account of the debatable issues of English usage and written style. It is based on extensive, up-to-date [[corpus linguistics|corpus data]] rather than on the author's personal intuition or prejudice, and differentiates among US, UK, Canadian and Australian usages. British [[lexicographer]] [[Sidney Landau]] remarked:

{{quote|The Cambridge Guide to English Usage is unique in the extent of its coverage of all the major varieties of English and in the degree to which it is based on corpus evidence, that is, on the analysis of vast collections of actual written and spoken language in each of the varieties under study.}}

'''Tower Millennium Pier''' is a [[pier]] on the [[River Thames]], in [[London]], [[United Kingdom|UK]]. It is operated by [[London River Services]] and served by various river transport and cruise operators. The pier is close to [[Tower Bridge]] and is situated immediately adjacent to the southwest corner of the [[Tower of London]].

==Services==
The pier is used by the river bus route RB1 from [[Embankment Pier|Embankment]] to [[Woolwich Arsenal Pier|Woolwich]] (operated by [[MBNA Thames Clippers]]) and [[Westminster Millennium Pier|Westminster]]-[[Greenwich Pier|Greenwich]] tourist boats (operated by City Cruises).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==History==
[[File:City of London skyline from London City Hall - Oct 2008.jpg|thumb|Tower Millennium Pier, with the [[City of London]]'s financial core behind, as seen from [[City Hall (London)|City Hall]]]]
Tower Millennium Pier was opened on 14 July by London Mayor [[Ken Livingstone]]. Its creation was funded by the [[Millennium Commission]] as part of the Thames 2000 project, and was one of five new piers provided by the Commission on the Thames (the others being [[Blackfriars Millennium Pier]], [[London Eye Pier]], [[Westminster Millennium Pier]] and [[Millbank Millennium Pier]]). The pier has at its upstream end a small cruise terminal facility which is used for processing passengers and baggage transferred by boat from cruise ships berthed alongside HMS Belfast. The Tower Pier project was part of an integrated transport and regeneration strategy for the Thames led by London's [[Cross River Partnership]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Lifeboat pier move==
In 2002 the [[Royal National Lifeboat Institution|RNLI]]'s Thames [[Lifeboat (rescue)|lifeboat]] service was introduced to the River Thames following the [[Marchioness disaster]], and Tower Pier was initially used as a base for the lifeboat service. In 2006 the RNLI station moved up-river to a new base, the former Waterloo Police Pier on [[Victoria Embankment]] next to [[Waterloo Bridge]], which took the name Tower Lifeboat Station.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==History==
===1988–1991: The Hot 100===
The idea for the poll came from Triple J producer Lawrie Zion in late 1988.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/30years/audio/hot100_1989.mp3 How Hottest 100 started (mp3)]&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, he conceived the idea of running a listener poll to determine their 100 favourite songs of all time.&lt;ref name="ABCJ"/&gt; The idea was allegedly stolen from [[Brisbane]] community radio station [[4zzz]], which developed the original Hot 100 in 1976.

For the Hot 100, before Triple J had become a national broadcaster, Sydney listeners were required to write their 10 favourite tracks on the back of an envelope.&lt;ref name="ABCJ"/&gt; Some entries were sent into the station written on a variety of items, including paintings, sculptures, and hand-rolled cannabis cigarettes.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} The results of the first poll were counted down on Sunday 5 March 1989 between 10am and 6pm.

The station repeated the event the following year when it started broadcasting to other capital cities besides Sydney. In 1991, Triple J was forced to change the poll's name to 'Hottest 100' to avoid legal action with 4zzz.

During the poll's first few years — from 1989 to 1991 — the winner in the first two years was "[[Love Will Tear Us Apart]]" by [[Joy Division]],&lt;ref name="ABCJ"/&gt; while 1991's favourite song was "[[Smells Like Teen Spirit]]" by [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]],&lt;ref name="ABCJ"/&gt; which had been released that year.

===1992–1995: Change to an annual poll, the Hottest 100===
Realising that the poll's results were unlikely to significantly change from year to year, Triple J rested the Hottest 100 in 1992 and relaunched it as an annual poll the following year. The newly launched poll required listeners to vote for their favourite songs of that year. Denis Leary's comedy anthem "Asshole" was voted number 1 in 1993.&lt;ref name="ABCJ"/&gt;

The inaugural Hottest 100 compilation CD, ''Triple J Hottest 100 (The Hottest Of The Hottest)'', was released by [[ABC Music]] in 1994. [[Denis Leary]]'s "Asshole" was voted in the number-one position in that year, while the radio-edited version of [[Ween]]'s "Push the Little Daisies",&lt;ref&gt;http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/hottest100/history/1993.htm&lt;/ref&gt; featuring a sample of musician [[Prince (musician)|Prince]] howling in place of the word "shit", appeared on the CD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Various – Triple J Hottest 100 (The Hottest Of The Hottest) - 1|url=http://www.discogs.com/Various-Triple-J-Hottest-100-The-Hottest-Of-The-Hottest-1/release/396987|website=Various on Discogs|publisher=Discogs|accessdate=21 January 2015|date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1996–2016: Rise in Australian music ===
In 1996, [[Spiderbait]] became the first Australian act to reach number 1. Since 1999, Australian acts have made up the majority of the polls.&lt;ref name="abc.net.au"&gt;{{cite web |title=History {{!}} Hottest 100 Archive {{!}} triple j |url=http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/hottest100/archive/history/ |website=www.abc.net.au |accessdate=23 July 2018 |language=en-AU |date=11 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Hottest 100 DVD, ''Triple J Hottest 100: The Hottest Videos For 2002'', was released in 2002. [[Queens Of The Stone Age]]'s "No One Knows" was voted into the top position in that year, while [[Grinspoon]], [[Motor Ace]], [[Darren Hanlon]], Machine Translations and [[Ms Dynamite]] were other Hottest 100 artists featured on the release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Various – Triple J Hottest 100 - The Hottest Videos For 2002|url=http://www.discogs.com/Various-Triple-J-Hottest-100-The-Hottest-Videos-For-2002/release/3235437|website=Various on Discogs|publisher=Discogs|accessdate=21 January 2015|date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, [[Powderfinger]] became the first act to be featured three times in the top 10 poll with "(Baby I've Got You) On My Mind", "Sunsets" and "Love Your Way" placing in the 4th, 7th and 10th places, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=hottest 100 2003|url=http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/hottest100_08/history/2003.htm|website=triple j Hottest 100|publisher=ABC|accessdate=26 January 2015|date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; All three songs appeared on the 2003 ''[[Vulture Street (album)|Vulture Street]]'' full-length studio album, which attained "6 x Platinum" sales in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Australian Record Sales - 2003 Full Year Figures - 12 Months Ending 31 December 2003|url=http://www.aria.com.au/pages/australianrecordsales-2003fullyearfigures.htm|website=ARIA Australian Recording Industry Association|publisher=Australian Recording Industry Association Ltd.|accessdate=26 January 2015|date=2005–2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Powderfinger – Vulture Street|url=http://www.discogs.com/Powderfinger-Vulture-Street/master/251585|website=Powderfinger on Discogs|publisher=Discogs|accessdate=26 January 2015|date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Powderfinger is also the only Australian artist to reach number 1 twice.&lt;ref name="abc.net.au"/&gt;

After its beginnings as a write-in poll, the Hottest 100 progressed to phone-in voting, which then progressed to SMS and online voting. In 2003, only web votes through the Triple J website were accepted, with registration required and a limit of 10 votes applied. In 2004, the guidelines were expanded so that voters were entitled to 10 internet votes and 10 SMS votes.

In 2014, [[Chet Faker]], whose real name is Nick Murphy, repeated Powderfinger's achievement from 2003 by placing three times in the top 10 positions. Faker reached the number-one spot with "[[Talk Is Cheap (Chet Faker song)|Talk Is Cheap]]" and the 7th and 8th positions, respectively, with "Gold" and "[[1998 (Chet Faker song)|1998]]". All three songs came from Faker's 2014 album ''[[Built On Glass]]''. Chet Faker placed a total of four times in the entire poll, with a [[cover version]] of [[Sonia Dada]]'s "Lover You Don't Treat Me No Good No More" in the 22nd position. The 22nd Hottest 100 poll received a record 2,099,707 million votes, cast by 258,762 voters from 188 countries.&lt;ref name="Chet" /&gt;

=== 2017-present: Announcement date change ===
In 2017, [[Triple J]] announced that they would be holding 2018's Hottest 100 on January 27, instead of the traditional date of January 26. Triple J cited "growing dialogue around Indigenous recognition and perspectives on 26 January.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Donoughue |first1=Paul |title=The Hottest 100 won't be held on Australia Day next year, triple j says |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-11-27/hottest-100-wont-be-held-on-australia-day-triple-j-says/9197014 |website=ABC News |publisher=ABC |accessdate=23 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable artists==
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2015}}
In the 25 years since its inception, the bands who have been featured the most are [[Powderfinger]], with 22 songs between the 1996 and 2009 countdowns, and the [[Foo Fighters]], who charted 22 times between 1995 and 2014. In 2011, it was incorrectly stated that Foo Fighters had the most appearances.&lt;ref&gt;http://hottest100.org/fingervsfoo.html&lt;/ref&gt;
Powderfinger's frontman, [[Bernard Fanning]], has taken the top spot on three occasions, twice with [[Powderfinger]] in 1999 and 2000 and once as a solo artist in 2005.

[[Dave Grohl]] has appeared 32 times throughout the countdown's history, including the top spot on two occasions (1991, 2002); 13 of those appearances were from the Hottest 100 Of All Time countdowns. He has appeared 4 times with [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]], 22 with [[Foo Fighters]], 6 with [[Queens of The Stone Age]] and once with [[Them Crooked Vultures]]. In fact, Grohl has appeared in the most countdowns run by Triple J, only excluding those in 1989, 1990, 2001, 2003, 2004, 2008, 2010 and 2012.

[[Robert Smith (musician)|Robert Smith]] of [[The Cure]] has appeared 34 times throughout the countdown's lifetime; 28 of those instances were in the All Time countdowns. Five additional entries came from countdowns between 1993 and 1997 with a final appearance, to date, through a collaboration with [[Crystal Castles (band)|Crystal Castles]] in 2010.

==Controversy==

===Lack of female artist representation===
There has been increased debate regarding lack of representation of female artists in the Hottest 100 each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Triple J's Hottest 100: where are the female singers? |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jun/09/triple-j-100-women|work=The Guardian |accessdate=27 January 2018|date=9 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Karen Pickering |title=Feminism and Music |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140122055321/http://mskarenpickering.com.au:80/2013/06/09/feminism-and-music/ |website=The Wayback Machine|accessdate=27 January 2018|date=9 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017 only sixteen of the artists were female,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PLAYLIST: Australian women on triple j's 2017 Hottest 100 |url=http://www.musiclove.com.au/blog/2017/1/27/playlist-australian-women-on-triple-js-2017-hottest-100|website=musiclove|accessdate=27 January 2018|date=27 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; compared to 2015 where despite 48% of voters being female, only thirteen female solo artists and eight female fronted or duo artists received votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author= |title=Triple J Hottest 100: It's a man's world|url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/music/triple-j-hottest-100-its-a-mans-world-20150127-12yx4x.html |work=The Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=27 January 2018|date=27 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A  break down was provided by Casey Briggs for the 2014 Hottest 100&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Casey Briggs|title=The 2014 Hottest 100, by the numbers|url=http://www.caseybriggs.com/blog/2015/1/26/the-2014-hottest-100-by-the-numbers|accessdate=27 January 2018|date=26 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and previous Hottest 100 polls over the Last 20 years (2013).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Casey Briggs |title=Women in the Hottest 100: Some numbers |url=http://caseybriggs.tumblr.com/post/52540078370/women-in-the-hottest-100-some-numbers|accessdate=27 January 2018|date=6 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===#Tay4Hottest100===
Following a 13 January 2015 article on [[BuzzFeed]], the "#Tay4Hottest100" [[hashtag]] campaign began during the voting period for the Hottest 100 poll for 2014. According to those critical of the campaign, the Hottest 100 is reserved for non-mainstream artists who were "discovered or fostered by Triple J" and provides valuable exposure for artists in the outer circles of the music industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Peter Vincent|title=Triple J Hottest 100: Has Taylor Swift been dumped from contention due to KFC ad?|url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/music/triple-j-hottest-100-has-taylor-swift-been-dumped-from-contention-due-to-kfc-ad-20150120-12u1gi.html|accessdate=23 January 2015|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=20 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Sarah Smith|title=Flight Facilities weigh in on Taylor Swift Hottest 100 furore|url=http://www.inthemix.com.au/news/59825/Flight_Facilities_weigh_in_on_Taylor_Swift_Hottest_100_furore|website=inthemix|publisher=inthemix Pty Ltd|accessdate=23 January 2015|date=20 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The campaign led to discussion &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.radioinfo.com.au/news/search?search=taylor%20swift%20hottest%20100&amp;any=on|title=NEWS {{!}} radioinfo|website=www.radioinfo.com.au|access-date=2017-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; about the broader cultural implications of the controversy generated by Swift. The ''[[Guardian Australia|Guardian]]''{{'}}s Elle Hunt wrote: "... the virulent response to #Tay4Hottest100 has revealed the persistence of a dichotomy I'd thought we'd thrown out long ago: that of high art versus low."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Elle Hunt|title=#Tay4Hottest100: Taylor Swift campaign shows it's time for Triple J to shake off cultural elitism|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jan/19/tay4hottest100-taylor-swift-campaign-shows-its-time-for-triple-j-to-shake-off-cultural-elitism|accessdate=21 January 2015|work=The Guardian|date=19 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Mark Di Stefano|title=Why Isn't Everyone Voting For "Shake It Off" In The Hottest 100?|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/markdistefano/tay-4-hottest100#.gmLzd8y1p|website=BuzzFeed|publisher=BuzzFeed, Inc|accessdate=21 January 2015|date=13 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing for ''[[The Conversation (website)|The Conversation]]'' on 23 January 2015, [[Charles Darwin University]] academic Gemma Blackwood concluded:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The cultural and economic meanings attached to the celebrity-sign of "Taylor Swift" seems antithetical to Triple J's self-representation as a place for exciting new music, with a supposed focus on emerging Australian talent. This perhaps explains why Swift is excluded from the playlist when other "mainstream" American artists and chart toppers ... are still played on the station heavily: the alignment and transfer of values of what is considered "cool" and "hip" between the station and its chosen artists ... The concept of "youth" seems to be used in reference to a musical market and to identify particular music genres rather than being a real or an accurate signifier of young tastes and interests. It raises the question: what responsibility does a national youth broadcaster have in the shaping and the adapting of young musical interests?&lt;ref name="Gem"&gt;{{cite news|author1=Gemma Blackwood|title=Taylor Swift, Triple J and what the youth market really wants to hear|url=http://theconversation.com/taylor-swift-triple-j-and-what-the-youth-market-really-wants-to-hear-36643|accessdate=1 February 2015|work=The Conversation|date=23 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Station manager Chris Scaddan told the media that the Swift campaign was within the rules of the poll, later instructing Triple J employees not to comment to "media, friends, family" about the campaign, as "it will all become clear when we get to the countdown next Monday." The station said: "we don't comment on voting campaigns whilst Hottest 100 voting is open. It draws attention to them and may influence the results of the poll."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Joe Harris|title=The Guardian Says Triple J Are "Sexist" For Ignoring Taylor Swift, &amp; That's Just Dumb|url=http://www.tonedeaf.com.au/432757/guardian-triple-j-sexist-taylor-swift.htm|website=Tone Deaf|publisher=Tone Deaf|accessdate=21 January 2015|date=20 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marketing website Mumbrella suggested on 20 January that a Facebook post by [[KFC]] incorporating the "#Tay4Hottest100" hashtag was against the Hottest 100 rules and could see Swift disqualified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Christensen|first1=Nic|title=KFC Facebook post may have disqualified Taylor Swift campaign from Triple J Hottest 100 list|url=http://mumbrella.com.au/abc-coy-taylor-swifts-hottest-100-eligibility-kfc-tries-jump-tay4hottest100-bandwagon-271943|website=Mumbrella|accessdate=22 January 2015|date=20 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Guardian'' submitted a freedom of information request to the ABC in regard to the station's response to the campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Elle Hunt|title=Taylor Swift fans have spoken – but will Triple J's Hottest 100 listen?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jan/20/taylor-swift-fans-have-spoken-but-will-triple-js-hottest-100-listen|accessdate=21 January 2015|work=The Guardian|date=20 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After journalist Peter Vincent reported that the Swift campaign had "swallowed" the Hottest 100 for 2014, citing research from the [[University of Queensland]] that showed that over 7,341 Hottest 100 posts in a 30-day period leading up to the poll results related to Swift, "Shake It Off" was eventually disqualified by the radio station in an announcement on 26 January 2015. The official announcement read: "it became pretty clear, pretty quick that a lot of people just wanted to prod some 'hipsters' for the lulz", acknowledging that the station "had a heap of fun", while Swift is "smart", "cool" and "successful". The song would have placed in the number-12 position if it had been allowed to compete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Cameron Adams|title=Taylor Swift disqualified from Hottest 100|url=http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/tv/taylor-swift-disqualified-from-hottest-100/story-fnndfy6b-1227196860796|accessdate=26 January 2015|work=News.com.au|date=26 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Peter Vincent|title=Taylor Swift campaign has swallowed Triple J Hottest 100|url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/music/taylor-swift-campaign-has-swallowed-triple-j-hottest-100-20150123-12wfs1.html|accessdate=26 January 2015|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=23 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the inside cover of the Triple J Hottest 100 Volume 22 CD, bold capital initials spell out "TAYLOR SWIFT BAN".

===Moving the Date===
In mid-2016, support grew for a campaign calling on Triple J to change the date of the Hottest 100. Calls were led by [[Indigenous Australians|Indigenous Australian]] activists and supporters, many of whom regard Australia Day as "Invasion Day". [[Australian hip hop]] duo [[A.B. Original]] and their anti-Australia Day single "January 26" were instrumental in drawing support to the cause. Triple J responded to the campaign in September 2016, announcing a review over whether the date of the Hottest 100 should be changed.

The review of the date continued into 2017, including consultation with [[Reconciliation Australia]], the [[National Congress of Australia's First Peoples]], and the [[National Australia Day Council]], while [[Triple J Hottest 100, 2016|2016's Hottest 100]] was held on Australia Day without change. In August 2017, Triple J launched a survey asking for public opinion on whether the date should be changed. Shortly after the survey began, former Triple J presenters [[Matt Okine]] and Kyran Wheatley came out in support of a date change.

On 27 November 2017, Triple J announced plans to move the Hottest 100 to the fourth weekend of January. This followed analysis led by [[Rebecca Huntley]] of the aforementioned survey, which attracted 64,990 responses, indicating that 60% of listeners supported moving the date. The announcement was welcomed by many musicians and the [[Australian Greens]]. Within the [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal Party]], however, Communications Minister [[Mitch Fifield]] was reportedly "bewildered" by the choice, one that MP [[Alex Hawke]] described as "disappointing" and "pathetic". As the minister responsible for the government-funded [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] (ABC), which Triple J is part of, Fifield wrote to the ABC's [[board of directors]] on 28 November asking them to return the Hottest 100 to Australia Day.

Some organisations offered alternatives to Triple J's Hottest 100 in response to the date change. These include nationwide rock radio station [[Triple M]] broadcasting an ''Ozzest 100'' countdown of only [[Music of Australia|Australian songs]] on 26 January, and Senator [[Cory Bernardi]]'s [[Australian Conservatives]] publishing an ''AC100'' playlist of Australian music on [[Spotify]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1489">In the [[Domain Name System]], a '''Uniform Resource Identifier''' ('''URI''') '''record''' (RFC 7553) is a means for publishing mappings from hostnames to [[URI]]s.

== Record format ==

The URI record is expressed in a master file in the following format:

&lt;pre&gt;
_service._proto.name. TTL class URI priority weight target.
&lt;/pre&gt;

where:

* ''service'': the symbolic name of the desired service.
* ''proto'': the transport protocol of the desired service; this is usually either [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]] or [[User Datagram Protocol|UDP]].
* ''name'': the domain name for which this record is valid, ending in a dot.
* ''TTL'': standard DNS [[time to live]] field.
* ''class'': standard DNS class field (this is always ''IN'').
* ''priority'': the priority of the target host, lower value means more preferred.
* ''weight'': A relative weight for records with the same priority, higher value means more preferred.
* ''target'': This field holds the URI of the target, enclosed in double-quote characters ('"'), where the URI is as specified in RFC 3986

== An example DNS URI resource record ==

&lt;pre&gt;
_ftp._tcp.example.com.    IN URI 10 1 "ftp://ftp1.example.com/public"
&lt;/pre&gt;

'''USS ''Dolphin'' (AGSS-555)''' was a [[United States Navy]] [[Diesel-electric transmission|diesel-electric]] deep-diving research and development [[submarine]]. She was commissioned in 1968 and decommissioned in 2007, and this 38 year career was the longest in history for a US Navy submarine. She was the Navy's last operational non-nuclear-powered submarine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last =Stillwell| first =Paul| title =The Last Diesel Boat| url= https://www.usni.org/magazines/navalhistory/2008-02/looking-back| accessdate=2018-03-12|journal =Naval History magazine| issue =February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction and service==
''Dolphin''{{'}}s [[keel]] laid on 9 November 1962 at the [[Portsmouth Navy Yard]], [[Kittery, Maine]].  She was [[Ship naming and launching|launched]] on 8 June 1968, sponsored by Mrs. [[Daniel K. Inouye]], and [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 17 August 1968 with Lieutenant Commander J.R. McDonnell in command. Despite a recent repair and upgrade, ''Dolphin'' was [[Ship decommissioning|decommissioned]] on 15 January 2007 and stricken from the [[Naval Vessel Register]] on the same date. She is now a [[museum ship]] in [[San Diego Bay]] under the management of the [[San Diego Maritime Museum]].

==Design==
The single most significant technical achievement in the development of ''Dolphin'' is the [[Pressure vessel|pressure hull]] itself. It is a constant diameter cylinder, closed at its ends with hemispherical heads, and utilizes deep frames instead of [[Bulkhead (partition)|bulkheads]]. The entire design of the pressure hull was kept as simple as possible to facilitate its use in structural experiments and trials. Hull openings were minimized for structural strength and minimum hull weight, in addition to eliminating possible sources for flooding casualties. The submarine has no [[Submarine snorkel|snorkel]] mast; her one hatch must be open while her diesels are running.

==Use==
Employed by both civilian and Navy activities, ''Dolphin'' was equipped with an extensive instrumentation suite that supported missions such as acoustic deep-water and [[littoral]] research, near-bottom and ocean surveys, weapons launches, sensor trials, and engineering evaluations.

Because she was designed as a test platform, ''Dolphin'' could be modified both internally and externally to allow installation of up to 12 tons of special research and test equipment. She has internal and external mounting points, multiple electronic hull connectors, and up to ten equipment racks for project use.

==Service record==
In August 1969, ''Dolphin'' launched a [[torpedo]] from the deepest depth that one has ever been fired.
Other examples of ''Dolphin'''s work include
* first successful submarine-to-aircraft optical communications
* development of a Laser Imaging system of photographic clarity
* development of an Extreme Low Frequency (ELF) antenna for {{sclass-|Ohio|submarine|1}}s
* evaluation of various non-acoustic ASW techniques
* evaluation of various low probability of interception active sonars
* first submarine launch of a [[mobile submarine simulator]] (MOSS) system
* first successful submarine test of BQS-15 sonar system
* development of highly accurate (10&amp;nbsp;cm) towed body position monitoring system
* development of a new Obstacle Avoidance Sonar system
* development of a highly accurate target management system
* evaluation of a possible "[[fifth force]] of nature"
* first successful submarine-to-aircraft two-way laser communication
* deepest submarine dive- more than 3,000 feet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Burge, Michael|title=Sub Dolphin Surfaces As Museum Piece|publisher=[[San Diego Union-Tribune]]|date=4 July 2009|page=B1|url=http://www3.signonsandiego.com/stories/2009/jul/04/sub-dolphin-surfaces-museum-piece/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Dolphin'' was overhauled in 1993.

In the late 1990s, ''Dolphin'' tested a new [[sonar]] system. As a result of ''Dolphin'''s efforts, this new system will now be retrofitted into the fleet.

===Fire and evacuation at sea===
On 21 May 2002, at about 2330 PDT, while operating approximately {{convert|100|mi|km|-1}} off the coast of [[San Diego, California]], ''Dolphin'' was cruising on the surface, recharging her batteries, when a torpedo shield door gasket failed, and the boat began to flood. Due to high winds and {{convert|10|to|11|ft|m|sing=on}} swells in the ocean, approximately 70 to 85 tons of seawater entered the ship, an amount perilously close to the boat's reserve [[buoyancy]]. The flooding shorted electrical panels and started fires.

Chief Machinist's Mate (SS) John D. Wise Jr. dove into the {{convert|57|F|adj=on}} water of the flooded pump room. With less than a foot of breathable space in the compartment, he ensured the seawater valves were lined up, allowing pumping out to commence. Once the valves were aligned, he remained in the pump room for more than 90 minutes in order to keep a submersible pump from becoming clogged. His courageous efforts prevented the loss of the ship and crew. Wise received the [[Navy and Marine Corps Medal]] for his efforts.

After 90 minutes,&lt;!--starting when?--&gt; with fire and flooding beyond the ability of the crew to control, Commander Stephen Kelety, ''Dolphin'''s commanding officer, ordered the crew of 41 and two civilian Navy employees to abandon ship. The Oceanographic Research ship [[MV William McGaw|''McGaw'']] was operating in the vicinity and immediately responded to Kelety's call for assistance. They were evacuated by boat to ''McGaw'' after the hatches&lt;!--which ones? The interior compartment hatches, I presume--&gt; had been secured. All crewmembers were safely recovered with only a few minor injuries. Two were recovered from the water by [[United States Coast Guard]] [[helicopter]] during the transfer. ''McGaw'' transported the crew to San Diego. {{USS|Thach|FFG-43}} also came alongside ''Dolphin'' and rescued several crewman from the water but the seas were too rough for full recovery or towing operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/navy-sub-catches-fire/|title=Navy Sub Catches Fire|last=Hancock|first=David|date=22 May 2002|work=CBS News/AP|access-date=2018-10-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.navy.mil/submit/display.asp?story_id=1766|title=Crew of Research Sub Safely Evacuated After Fire, Flooding|last=Submarine Force|first=Pacific Fleet Representative, West Coast|date=22 May 2002|work=Navy Press Release|access-date=2018-10-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.navy.mil/submit/display.asp?story_id=5397|title=Navy Recognizes USS Dolphin's Modest Hero|last=Hoehne|first=Trevor, Journalist 2nd Class|date=16 January 2003|work=Navy Region Southwest Public Affairs|access-date=2018-10-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The quick response of the crew placed the submarine in a stable condition. Submarine Support Vessel [[MV Kellie Chouest|''Kellie Chouest'']] got underway from San Diego early on 22 May to assist in recovery. ''Dolphin'' was towed back to San Diego the following day.

''Dolphin'' underwent three and a half years of repairs and upgrades at a cost of $50 million, then completed sea-trials during the summer of 2005 and returned to her duties for one year.

In mid-2006, the Navy decided to retire ''Dolphin'', citing the $18 million her operations cost annually.  She was deactivated on 22 September 2006, and [[ship decommissioning|decommissioned]] and struck from the [[Naval Vessel Register]] on 15 January 2007.  Her 38 year career was the longest in history for a US Navy submarine.

''Dolphin'' was officially transferred to the [[San Diego Maritime Museum]] in September 2008, to become the eighth vessel in their floating collection. She was opened to the public for the first time on 4 July 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sdmaritime.org/contentpage.asp?ContentID=725 San Diego Maritime Museum]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6238">The '''Washington State Digital Archives''' in [[Cheney, Washington]] preserves electronic records from Washington's state and local government agencies. It opened in October 2004 and is the first state [[archive]]s in the [[United States]] dedicated specifically to the preservation of electronic records.

== History ==
The Washington State Archives began strategic planning for the Digital Archives in 2000, and planning for the physical design and technical infrastructure occurred in 2002. Construction began in January 2003.

Concurrent with construction, research began on the programmatic and technological aspects of the Digital Archives. Site visits by project team members were made to the National Archives and the Library of Congress. A strategic plan was developed that included extensive involvement of staff, executive management and external stakeholders.

In June 2004, custom development on the web interface and database design began, blending the latest technologies with traditional archival theory to create a first of its kind repository. The goal of the program was to make the historical electronic records of State and Local government agencies easily accessible to the public, from anywhere, at anytime. The first records brought into the facilities care were marriage records from three pilot counties (Chelan, Snohomish and Spokane) along with the Historic Census and Naturalization records from the State Archives and State Library.

The grand opening of the facility occurred on October 4, 2004 and was attended by Washington State legislators, county officials, and archivists from throughout the United States. Among the speakers at this prestigious event were Washington Secretary of State [[Sam Reed]] and Lew Bellardo, Deputy Archivist of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalarchives.wa.gov/Content.aspx?txt=background|title=Digital Archives Background and History|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Washington State Digital Archives|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=April 3, 2017}} {{PD-notice|url=https://www.digitalarchives.wa.gov/StaticContent/background}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some significant milestones have occurred over the years. In 2005 the staff of the digital archives worked quickly to preserve outgoing governor Gary Locke's website, an important public record, before it was replaced by the website for incoming governor Christine Gregoire.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.digitalarchives.wa.gov/News/View/32|title=Digital archives saves Locke's website from extinction|last=|first=|date=|website=www.digitalarchives.wa.gov|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three years later, through a collaboration with Microsoft Research, the archives released a ground-breaking new feature that made it possible to keyword search audio files.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.digitalarchives.wa.gov/News/View/42|title=Digital Archives, Microsoft Research take public records access to the next level with Audio Search|last=|first=|date=|website=www.digitalarchives.wa.gov|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of May 15, 2017, there are nearly 30,000 keyword searchable audio files on the archives website. Starting in 2007, the archives partnered with the [[Library of Congress]] on their Multi-State Preservation Consortium, an effort to spread digital archiving of state government records into other states across the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.digitalpreservation.gov/partners/states_wa.html|title=Multi-State Preservation Consortium - Partners - Digital Preservation (Library of Congress)|website=www.digitalpreservation.gov|access-date=2017-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Washington State Digital Archives is part of the Office of the Secretary of State currently directed by [[Kim Wyman]].

== Location ==
The archives is located in Cheney, Washington on the campus of [[Eastern Washington University]]. The archives has extensive educational partnerships with the university including internships for students, an archive crash-course for history survey classes, and facilitated student research projects using surrogate archival collections. One student-driven project, "Treasures of the Archives," showcases a compelling series or records in the collection each month. These short bits are featured on the archives' home page.

The archives is located on the southwest corner of EWU's campus in a two-story building that it shares with the Eastern Region Branch of the Washington State Archives, a regional archives for paper records created by local government agencies in Washington's eleven easternmost counties.

== Holdings and Notable Collections ==
When the facility opened in 2004 the Archives only held a few record series but as of April 3, 2017, the Archives has preserved 187,121,397 records, of which 65,559,111 were searchable on the Archives website. Many of these records were [[Born-digital|born digital]] but the Archives also preserves digitized historic paper records to provide easy access to the records to researchers around the world. Some of the Archives notable collections that can be found on the website are:
* Washington State Birth Records pre-1907
* Washington State Marriage Records
* Washington State Agency Meeting Minutes
* Washington State Historic Photographs
* Washington State Agency Audio Recordings
