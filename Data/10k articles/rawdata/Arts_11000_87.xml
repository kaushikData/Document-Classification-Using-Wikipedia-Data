'''A. &amp; M. Karagheusian, Inc.''' was a rug manufacturer headquartered at 295 [[Fifth Avenue]] in [[Manhattan]]. Manufacturing was located in [[Freehold Borough, New Jersey]] and operated for 60 years before closing in 1964. It employed 1,700 people at its peak operation in the 1930s. [[Bruce Springsteen]] wrote about the '''Karagheusian Rug Mill'''’s closing in his 1984 song "[[My Hometown]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Karen|last= Demasters|authorlink= |coauthors= |title=A Factory That Wove Rugs and Bound a Town Together. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/04/09/nyregion/on-the-map-a-factory-that-wove-rugs-and-bound-a-town-together.html |quote= History of old Karagheusian Rug Mill in [[Freehold Township, New Jersey]], recalled by Bernadette Rogoff, curator at Monmouth County Historical Association; long-empty mill is being converted to housing, office and retail space. For more than half of the 20th century, life in Freehold, the county seat for Monmouth County, revolved around the Karagheusian Rug Mill, which employed 1,700 people at its peak operation in the 1930s. The mill was referred to in the Bruce Springsteen song [[My Hometown]]; Mr. Springsteen's father worked there for a time. The 15-ton looms have been removed, and the sole remaining building is being converted to apartments, office and retail space after sitting empty for several years. The Monmouth County Historical Association will mount an exhibition on the mill at the association headquarters in Freehold starting next fall. Bernadette Rogoff, the historical association curator, talked recently about why the association is doing the exhibition. ... |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=April 9, 2000 |accessdate=2007-08-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Arshag Karagheusian]] (1872-1963) and Miran Karagheusian (1874-1948), were [[Armenians]] and fled Turkey in 1896 to go to England and then to the United States. The family had been in the rug trade in Turkey since 1818, and they began in the United States in 1897 as rug importers, and then expanded into manufacturing in 1903. By 1927 they had 15 broadlooms, weighing 15 tons each, and 196 single looms. They developed, and were the only manufacturers of "Gulistan Rug" carpets. They made the carpet for [[Radio City Music Hall]] in 1932 and for the [[United States Supreme Court]] building in 1933. They stopped manufacturing oriental carpets in 1953.

==Miran Karagheusian==
Miran Karagheusian (1874–1948) married Zabelle and had: Howard Karagheusian who died young, and a scholarship was set up in his name; and a daughter, Leila Karagheusian (c1910-1999). Miran Karagheusian died on October 7, 1948, at [[Lenox Hill Hospital]] in Manhattan, he lived in [[Oyster Bay (hamlet), New York|Oyster Bay, New York]] and he had attended [[Robert College]] in Turkey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Miran Karagheusian, A Rug Manufacturer. |url= |quote= |work=The New York Times |date=October 7, 1948}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arshag Karagheusian==
{{main|Arshag Karagheusian}}
Arshag Karagheusian (1872–1963) had the following children: Jean Karagheusian Hallaure (1898–2000) aka Alice Hallaure; Charles Karagheusian (1903–1977) who married Artemis Tavshanjian (1904–1990) on April 30, 1927,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Miss Artemis Tavshanjian to Wed C. Karagheusian. |url= |quote= |work=The New York Times |date=April 5, 1927}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Marguerite Karagheusian Agathon (husband Oshin Agathon) (1904–1986). Arshag served as the head of the [[Armenian General Benevolent Union]] from 1943 to 1952. Arshag died on September 24, 1963, in [[Larchmont, New York]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=[[Larchmont, New York]], September 24, 1963 Arshag Karagheusian, a carpet manufacturer and a leader in Armenian philanthropic work, died here today in his home at 14 Pryor Lane. He was 92 years old. |url= |quote= |work=The New York Times |date=September 25, 1963}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Renovation==
In 2001 the mill reopened as a 202-unit affordable apartment complex, named The Continental at Freehold. The [[New Jersey Department of Community Affairs]] (DCA) and its affiliated [[New Jersey Housing and Mortgage Finance Agency]] (HMFA) were major financiers of the project. Community Affairs Commissioner Jane M. Kenny said: "Nearly forty years after the looms were packed up and hauled away, the rug mill is a working building once again."

==Archive==
The [[Monmouth County Historical Association]] at 70 Court Street in [[Freehold Borough, New Jersey]], houses a collection of manuscripts, newsletters, newspaper clippings, photographs, negatives and other materials related to the A &amp; M Karagheusian Rug Mill, which was located in Freehold, New Jersey.

==Roselle Park factory==
The company had a factory in [[Roselle Park, New Jersey]], from May 19, 1923, to 1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Morgan|first1=Audrey|last2=Pagnetti|first2=Patricia|last3=Sokol|first3=Barbara|title=Roselle Park|date=2000|publisher=Arcadia|location=Charleston, SC|isbn=0-7385-0430-0|pages=97–98|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m18w_T0fqLgC|accessdate=6 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Television and radio===
When she was 21, Rippon began her television career at [[BBC South West]] in Plymouth in 1966,&lt;ref name=bbcnews&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/devon/3799125.stm|title=TV newsreader honoured by Queen|publisher=BBC News|date=12 June 2004|accessdate=21 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; before becoming a reporter for BBC TV news.&lt;ref name=evening&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=PO9AAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=ZqcMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4848,674700&amp;dq=angela-rippon+plymouth&amp;hl=en|title=Election Spotlight|date=3 May 1979|newspaper=[[Evening Times]]|accessdate=21 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rippon first presented a national news programme on [[BBC Two|BBC2]] in 1974. For a fortnight, she replaced newsreader [[Richard Baker (broadcaster)|Richard Baker]] – who was on holiday – on [[BBC One]]'s ''Nine O'Clock News'', and was offered a permanent newsreading role on that programme in 1975. Rippon was called by newspapers the first female television newsreader. However, [[ITN]]'s [[Barbara Mandell]] predated her, having first appeared on the second night of [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] in 1955; [[Nan Winton]] was the first female BBC newsreader in 1960, and [[Mary Marquis]] had already been [[BBC Scotland]]'s main newsreader for a few years. Rippon was the first female journalist to read the news regularly on national television.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sponsored/foodanddrink/glenrothes-vintage-single-malt-/8564089/My-vintage-moment-Angela-Rippon.html|title=My vintage moment: Angela Rippon|date=8 June 2011|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|accessdate=21 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/g2/story/0,3604,353899,00.html|title='Sexism?

In an interview with ''[[The Guardian]]'', she said: "You just become an automated autocue reader and if you've half a brain you want an opportunity to use it. When I read the Nine O'Clock News, I kept my brain active by working on programmes like ''[[Antiques Roadshow]]'' (which she briefly hosted in 1979), ''[[Top Gear (1977 TV series)|Top Gear]]'' and ''In the Country''."&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt; Rippon was a guest in the 1976 [[Morecambe and Wise]] Christmas Show, first appearing behind a BBC newsdesk, then emerging to perform a high-kicking dance routine.&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt; Her appearance was so popular she made a [[cameo appearance|cameo]] appearance in the following year's show, in which she was revealed to be one of a [[chorus line]].

'''''But What If We're Wrong? Thinking About the Present As If It Were the Past''''' is a 2016 non-fiction book by American author and essayist [[Chuck Klosterman]].

==Content and concepts==
The premise of the book is that most of what we believe is likely to be wrong, but to avoid delusions in our perceptions, Klosterman advises us to “think about the present as if it were the distant past.”&lt;ref name=NYTimes20160629/&gt;

Klosterman examines such things as: the history of scientific theories such as gravity, our perception of historical literary geniuses, our interests in entertainment and professional sports—as background examples to challenge confidence in our contemporary perceptions, to try to detect how those perceptions might be mistaken.&lt;ref name=NYTimes20160629/&gt; In a series of what have been called [[thought experiment]]s,&lt;ref name=PubWeekly20160418/&gt; various topics (literary greats, [[multiverse]]s, time, dreams, democracy, television shows, sports) are analyzed under “Klosterman’s Razor”: the concept that "the best hypothesis is the one that reflexively accepts its potential wrongness to begin with.”&lt;ref name=Kirkus20160304/&gt;

==Reception==
''But What If We're Wrong?'' reached ''[[The New York Times]]'' [[The New York Times Best Seller list|Best Seller list]] in the Culture category.&lt;ref name=NYTimes20170127&gt;{{cite web |title=BOOKS / BEST SELLERS / Culture |url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/best-sellers/2016/09/11/culture/ |publisher=''The New York Times'' |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170127204951/https://www.nytimes.com/books/best-sellers/2016/09/11/culture/ |archivedate=January 27, 2017 |date=September 2016 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jim Holt wrote in ''The New York Times'' that while he was "never bored" and Klosterman's goals were admirable, the book left him "exasperated," Holt asserting the book lacked rigor and treated profound questions with glibness: "My hackles raised, I argued inwardly with the author on every page."&lt;ref name=NYTimes20160629&gt;{{cite web |last1=Holt |first1=Jim |title=The Good, the True, the Beautiful and Chuck Klosterman |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/03/books/review/chuck-klosterman-but-what-if-were-wrong.html |publisher=''The New York Times'' |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160702192223/https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/03/books/review/chuck-klosterman-but-what-if-were-wrong.html |archivedate=July 2, 2016 |date=June 29, 2016 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Kirkus Reviews'' indicated the book is "full of intelligence and insights" and "makes readers think," challenging our beliefs "with jocularity and perspicacity."&lt;ref name=Kirkus20160304&gt;{{cite web|title=KIRKUS REVIEW / An inquiry into why we’ll probably be wrong about almost everything |url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/chuck-klosterman/but-what-if-were-wrong/ |publisher=''Kirkus Reviews'' |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161013212214/https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/chuck-klosterman/but-what-if-were-wrong/ |archivedate=October 13, 2016 |date=March 4, 2016 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Publisher's Weekly'' acknowledged the book was "pop philosophy" but noted parts were based on interviews of "heavyweights," adding that Klosterman's humor and curiosity "propel the reader through the book."&lt;ref name=PubWeekly20160418&gt;{{cite web |title=But What If We’re Wrong? Thinking About the Present as if It Were the Past |url=https://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-399-18412-3 |publisher=''Publisher's Weekly'' |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161230225254/https://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-399-18412-3 |archivedate=December 30, 2016 |date=April 18, 2016 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''The Oregonian,'' Douglas Perry recognized the impossibility of the predicting the future, explaining why the book includes "endless streams of maybes, coulds and ifs, all leading to a shrug"—while affirming that Klosterman is "good company throughout the long, fruitless expedition."&lt;ref name=Oregonian20160621&gt;{{cite web |last1=Perry |first1=Douglas |title=Chuck Klosterman's 'But What If We're Wrong?' peers into the future |url=http://www.oregonlive.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2016/06/if_chuck_klostermans_but_what.html |publisher=''The Oregonian'' |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160622134412/http://www.oregonlive.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2016/06/if_chuck_klostermans_but_what.html |archivedate=June 22, 2016 |date=June 21, 2016 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''Pittsburgh Post-Gazette,'' Will Ashton asserted the book to be Klosterman's most wide-reaching accomplishment to date and confirmed the writer’s "signature wit," but wrote that Klosterman appeared "overwhelmed" by the challenge, leaving "an ongoing sense (Klosterman) is grasping here."&lt;ref name=PittsburghPostGaz20160712&gt;{{cite web |last1=Ashton |first1=Will |title='But What If We’re Wrong?': Certitude is a four-letter word in Chuck Klosterman's latest |url=http://www.post-gazette.com/ae/books/2016/07/10/But-What-If-We-re-Wrong-Certitude-is-a-four-letter-word-in-Chuck-Klosterman-s-latest/stories/201607100031 |publisher=''Pittsburgh Post-Gazette'' |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160712023049/http://www.post-gazette.com/ae/books/2016/07/10/But-What-If-We-re-Wrong-Certitude-is-a-four-letter-word-in-Chuck-Klosterman-s-latest/stories/201607100031 |archivedate=July 12, 2016 |date=July 10, 2016 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a review for the online literary magazine ''The Millions,'' Ashley Perez argued, "Klosterman allows himself to be swayed, and allows himself to be wrong. The ebb and flow of opinions shows how difficult Klosterman’s project is, and how charming a writer he can be."

The book's cover, designed by [[Paul Sahre]], was judged among the year's best, as chosen by the art director of ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]''.&lt;ref name=NYTimes20161207&gt;{{cite web |last1=Dorfman |first1=Matt |title=The Best Book Covers of 2016 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/books/review/book-covers.html |publisher=''The New York Times'' |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161216105316/http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/books/review/book-covers.html |archivedate=December 16, 2016 |date=December 7, 2016 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Campo Grande''' (English: "Large Field") is a large public park located in the heart of the city of [[Valladolid]], [[Spain]]. Is triangular, has 115.000 [[m]] (11.5 [[Hectare|ha]]) surface and is limited by the street Acera de Recoletos, the Paseo de los Filipinos and Paseo de Zorrilla.&lt;ref&gt;Surface data of [http://www.asomateavalladolid.com/es/ocio_natur/index.asp?por=no&amp;men1=12c&amp;men2=21&amp;men3=31&amp;p3=RUTAS&amp;con=r_burgues.htm Asómate a Valladolid]&lt;/ref&gt; Its main entrance is in the Plaza de Zorrilla, where together with a modern bill gate lies a floral shield of the city. The park is closed around its perimeter by a simple fence that runs between [[Column|pillars]], with doors on all sides.

Compared with the [[Retiro Park]] in [[Madrid]] is 10 times smaller in size (11'5 hectares compared to 118) and almost 30 times smaller in size than the [[Central Park]] in [[New York City]] (11'5 hectares compared to 341).

Its origin as a park or, more specifically, as a garden area, dates back to 1787, although from the fifteenth century must be regarded as an important urban space.&lt;ref&gt;Duran Montero, María Antonia, La Alameda de los Descalzos Lima and its relationship with Hercules in Seville and Valladolid, Prado, Sevilla (Seville: Printing EEHA) [sn], 1984. Albardonedo Freire, Antonio, The urbanism of Sevilla during the reign of Philip II. Sevilla: Guadalquivir, 2002, p. 191-208&lt;/ref&gt;  A notable feature of the park is the abundant bird population. Spread over the surface lies a Faisanera, an aviary and a loft belonging to Castilla Pigeon Club, which make the [[Pavo cristatus|peacocks]], [[Phasianidae#Genres|pheasants]] and [[Columbidae|pigeons]] very numerous and they've become the real inhabitants of the park. It has a variety of trees that are a true botanical garden.

At various points in its history called '''Field of Truth''' and then '''Field of Mars''' but finally consolidated as '''Campo Grande'''.

A '''canvas print''' is the result of an image [[printing|printed]] onto [[canvas]] which is stretched, or [[gallery wrap|gallery-wrapped]], onto a frame and displayed. Canvas prints are often used in interior design, with stock images, or customised with personal photographs.  Canvas prints are intended to reproduce the look of original oil or acrylic paintings on stretched canvas.

==Printing methods==
Reproductions of original artwork have been printed on canvas for many decades using [[offset printing]]. Since the 1990s, canvas print has been associated with either [[dye-sublimation printer|dye sublimation]] or [[inkjet printer|inkjet]] print processes (often referred to as [[repligraph]] or [[giclée]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dpandi.com/giclee/ "''What's In a Name: The True Story of Giclée''" By Harald Johnson]&lt;/ref&gt; respectively). The canvas print material is generally cotton or plastic based [[poly canvas]], often used for the reproduction of photographic images.

Modern large format printers are capable of printing onto canvas rolls measuring {{convert|1.5|m|in}} or more. Modern examples of inkjet-based printers capable of printing directly onto canvas&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tiaracle.com/collections/custom-canvas-prints|title=Custom Canvas Prints - Large Multiple Panel Custom Art Canvas Prints|last=Tiaracle|website=Tiaracle|language=en|access-date=2018-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hp.com/hpinfo/newsroom/press_kits/2008/pma/fs_dj_z6100.pdf [[Hewlett-Packard|HP]] Designjet Z6100 Printer Series]&lt;/ref&gt; are the HP Designjet z6100 and the [[Epson]] Ultra Chrome 11880. Printers such as these allow artists and photographers to print their works directly onto canvas media, with slow print speed settings available to ensure print quality is not diminished.

Printed canvas for wall art is generally of a weight around 400&amp;nbsp;gsm and should be 100% pure white cotton for a more exact colour representation.{{Fact|date=January 2009}}

==Construction methods==

After the image is printed, the canvas is trimmed to size and glued, or stapled to traditional [[stretcher bar]]s, or a wooden panel and displayed in a frame, or as a [[gallery wrap]]. The frames are usually constructed from solid pine and underpinned for added strength. A print that is designed to continue round the edges of a stretcher frame once gallery-wrapped is referred to as [[bleed (printing)|full-bleed]]. This can be used to enhance the three-dimensional effect of the mounted print.

==Uses for prints==

Canvas prints are commonly used in home decor, either chosen by professional interior designers, or by the homeowner. Canvas prints can be mass produced and available through high street retailers and home improvement stores, such as [[IKEA]], or personalized one-off canvas prints produced from the individual's own photograph, or drawing, usually uploaded via the Internet, or ordered direct from social media websites.

Canvas prints are often used as a cheaper alternative to framed artwork as there is no glazing required and the pine frame is not usually visible, so do not need to be varnished, or treated.

Backwards time travel would allow for causal loops involving events, information, people or objects whose histories form a closed loop, and thus seem to "come from nowhere."&lt;ref name="Smith" /&gt; The notion of objects or information which are "self-existing" in this way is often viewed as paradoxical,&lt;ref name="Lobo" /&gt; with several authors referring to a causal loop involving information or objects without origin as a  ''bootstrap paradox'',&lt;ref name="Everett"&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last1=Everett|first1=Allen|last2=Roman|first2=Thomas|title=Time Travel and Warp Drives|date=2012|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=978-0-226-22498-5|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Dm5xt_XbFyoC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA136 136–139]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Visser|first=Matt|title=Lorentzian Wormholes: From Einstein to Hawking|date=1996|publisher=Springer-Verlag|location=New York|isbn=1-56396-653-0|p=213}} "A second class of logical paradoxes associated with time travel are the bootstrap paradoxes related to information (or objects, or even people?) being created from nothing."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Klosterman"&gt;{{cite book |ref=harv|last1=Klosterman |first1=Chuck |title=Eating the Dinosaur |date=2009 |publisher=Scribner |location=New York |isbn=9781439168486|edition=1st Scribner hardcover|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=lZurDFJtAWwC&amp;lpg=PA60&amp;pg=PA60 60–62]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Toomey2012"&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Toomey|first=David|title=The New Time Travelers|date=2012|publisher=W.

An example of a causal loop paradox involving information is given by Everett: suppose a time traveler copies a mathematical proof from a textbook, then travels back in time to meet the mathematician who first published the proof, at a date prior to publication, and allows the mathematician to simply copy the proof. In this case, the information in the proof has no origin.&lt;ref name="Everett"/&gt; A similar example is given in the television series ''[[Doctor Who]]'' of a time-traveler who copies Beethoven's music from the future and publishes it in Beethoven's time in Beethoven's name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|ref=harv|last=Holmes|first=Jonathan|work=Radio Times|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2015-10-10/doctor-who-what-is-the-bootstrap-paradox|title=Doctor Who: what is the Bootstrap Paradox?|date=October 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Everett gives the movie ''[[Somewhere in Time (film)|Somewhere in Time]]'' as an example involving an object with no origin: an old woman gives a watch to a playwright who later travels back in time and meets the same woman when she was young, and gives her the same watch that she will later give to him.&lt;ref name="Everett" /&gt;

Krasnikov writes that these bootstrap paradoxes - information or an object looping through time - are the same; the primary apparent paradox is a physical system evolving into a state in a way that is not governed by its laws.&lt;ref name="Krasnikov2001"&gt;{{cite|last=Krasnikov|first=S.|year=2001|title=The time travel paradox|journal=Phys.

A 1992 paper by physicists Andrei Lossev and [[Igor Dmitriyevich Novikov|Igor Novikov]] labeled such items without origin as ''Jinn'', with the singular term ''Jinnee''.&lt;ref name="Lossev1992"&gt;{{cite journal |ref=harv|last=Lossev|first=Andrei |last2=Novikov|first2=Igor|date=15 May 1992|title=The Jinn of the time machine: non-trivial self-consistent solutions|journal=Class.

The term ''predestination paradox'' is used in the ''[[Star Trek]]'' franchise to mean "a time loop in which a time traveler who has gone into the past causes an event that ultimately causes the original future version of the person to go back into the past."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last1=Okuda|first1=Michael|last2=Okuda|first2=Denise|title=The Star Trek Encyclopedia|date=1999|publisher=Pocket Books|isbn=0-671-53609-5|p=384}}&lt;/ref&gt; This use of the phrase was created for a sequence in a 1996 episode of ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'' titled "[[Trials and Tribble-ations]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last1=Erdmann|first1=Terry J.|last2=Hutzel|first2=Gary|title=Star Trek: The Magic of Tribbles|date=2001|publisher=Pocket Books|isbn=0-7434-4623-2|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=W6bvoGUg7G8C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA31 31]}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the phrase had been used previously to refer to belief systems such as [[Calvinism]] and some forms of [[Marxism]] which encouraged followers to strive to produce certain outcomes while at the same time teaching that the outcomes were predetermined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |ref=harv|last=Daniels|first=Robert V.|date=May–June 1960|title=Soviet Power and Marxist Determinism|journal=Problems of Communism|volume=9|p=[http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015059418874;view=1up;seq=159 17]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smeenk and Morgenstern use the term "predestination paradox" to refer specifically to situations in which a time traveler goes back in time to try to prevent some event in the past, but ends up helping to cause that same event.&lt;ref name="smeenk" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Morgenstern"&gt;{{cite|url=http://cs.nyu.edu/web/Research/TechReports/TR2013-950/TR2013-950.pdf |title=Foundations of a Formal Theory of Time Travel |last=Morgenstern|first=Leora|year=2010|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Self-fulfilling prophecy==
A [[self-fulfilling prophecy]] may be a form of causality loop, only when the prophecy can be said to be ''truly'' known to occur, since only then events in the future will be causing effects in the past. Otherwise, it would be a simple case of events in the past causing events in the future. [[Predestination]] does not necessarily involve a [[supernatural]] power, and could be the result of other "infallible foreknowledge" mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |ref=harv|last=Craig|first=William Lane|year=1987 |url=http://www.leaderu.com/offices/billcraig/docs/newcomb.html |title=Divine Foreknowledge and Newcomb's Paradox |journal=Philosophia |volume=17 |issue=3 |pages=331–350 |doi=10.1007/BF02455055}}&lt;/ref&gt; Problems arising from infallibility and influencing the future are explored in [[Newcomb's paradox]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Dummett|first=Michael|title=The Seas of Language|isbn13=9780198240112|year=1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|pp=356, 370–375}}&lt;/ref&gt; A notable fictional example of a self-fulfilling prophecy occurs in classical play ''[[Oedipus Rex]]'', in which [[Oedipus]] becomes the king of [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]], whilst in the process unwittingly fulfills a prophecy that he would kill his father and marry his mother. The prophecy itself serves as the impetus for his actions, and thus it is self-fulfilling.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Dodds|first=E.R.|year=1966|title=Greece &amp; Rome}} 2nd Ser., Vol. 13, No. 1, pp. 37–49&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last1=Popper|first1=Karl|title=Unended Quest: An Intellectual Autobiography|date=1985|publisher=Open Court|location=La Salle, Ill.|isbn=978-0-87548-343-6|edition=Rev.|p=139}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movie ''[[12 Monkeys (film)|12 Monkeys]]'' heavily deals with themes of predestination and the [[Cassandra (metaphor)|Cassandra complex]], where the protagonist who travels back in time explains that he can't change the past.&lt;ref name="Klosterman" /&gt;

''Evolution of the Universe'', p. 169: "The close of time curves does not necessarily imply a violation of causality, since the events along such a closed line may be all 'self-adjusted'—they all affect one another through the closed cycle and follow one another in a self-consistent way."&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1990 paper by Novikov and several others, "Cauchy problem in spacetimes with closed timelike curves",&lt;ref name="Friedman1990" /&gt; the authors suggested the ''principle of self-consistency,'' which states that ''the only solutions to the laws of physics that can occur locally in the real Universe are those which are globally self-consistent.'' The authors later concluded that time travel need not lead to unresolvable paradoxes, regardless of what type of object was sent to the past.&lt;ref name="Thorne" /&gt;

Physicist [[Joseph Polchinski]] argued that one could avoid questions of free will by considering a potentially paradoxical situation involving a [[billiard ball]] sent back in time. In this situation, the ball is fired into a [[wormhole]] at an angle such that, if it continues along its course, it will exit in the past at just the right angle to hit its earlier self, knocking it off course, which would stop it from entering the wormhole in the first place. Thorne referred to this problem as "Polchinski's paradox".&lt;ref name="Thorne" /&gt; Two students at Caltech, Fernando Echeverria and Gunnar Klinkhammer, went on to find a solution that avoided any inconsistencies. In the revised scenario, the ball would emerge from the future at a different angle than the one that had generated the paradox, and delivers its past self a glancing blow instead of knocking it completely away from the wormhole. This blow changes its trajectory by just the right degree, meaning it will travel back in time with the angle required to deliver its younger self the necessary glancing blow. Echeverria and Klinkhammer actually found that there was more than one self-consistent solution, with slightly different angles for the glancing blow in each case. Later analysis by Thorne and [[Robert Forward]] showed that for certain initial trajectories of the billiard ball, there could actually be an infinite number of self-consistent solutions.&lt;ref name="Thorne" /&gt;

Echeverria, Klinkhammer and Thorne published a paper discussing these results in 1991;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |ref={{harvid|Echeverria|1991}}| first=Fernando | last=Echeverria |author2=Gunnar Klinkhammer |author3=Kip Thorne | url=http://authors.library.caltech.edu/6469/ | title=Billiard balls in wormhole spacetimes with closed timelike curves: Classical theory | journal = Physical Review D | volume = 44 | year=1991 | issue=4 | doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.44.1077 | pages=1077|bibcode = 1991PhRvD..44.1077E }}&lt;/ref&gt; in addition, they reported that they had tried to see if they could find ''any'' initial conditions for the billiard ball for which there were no self-consistent extensions, but were unable to do so. Thus it is plausible that there exist self-consistent extensions for every possible initial trajectory, although this has not been proven.&lt;ref name="Earman1995187188"&gt;{{cite book |ref=harv| last = Earman | first = John | title = Bangs, Crunches, Whimpers, and Shrieks: Singularities and Acausalities in Relativistic Spacetimes | publisher = Oxford University Press |year= 1995 | isbn = 0-19-509591-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|184}} The lack of constraints on initial conditions only applies to spacetime outside of the chronology-violating region of spacetime; the constraints on the chronology-violating region might prove to be paradoxical, but this is not yet known.&lt;ref name="Earman1995187188" /&gt;{{Rp|187–188}}

Novikov's views are not widely accepted.

'''Chaekgeori''' ({{Korean|hangul=책거리|hanja=冊巨里}}), translated as "books and things", is a genre of still-life [[Korean painting|painting]] from the [[Joseon]] period of Korea that features books as the dominant subject.&lt;ref name="Met"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hyun|first1=Eleanor Soo-ah|title=Korean Chaekgeori Paintings|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/chae/hd_chae.htm|website=The Met’s Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History|publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art|accessdate=30 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''chaekgeori'' tradition flourished from the second half of the 18th century to the first half of the 20th century and was enjoyed by all members of the population, from the king to the commoners, revealing the infatuation with books and learning in Korean culture.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia"&gt;{{cite web|title=책거리|url=http://folkency.nfm.go.kr/kr/topic/%EC%B1%85%EA%B1%B0%EB%A6%AC/6591|website=Encyclopedia of Korean Folk Culture|publisher=National Folk Museum of Korea|accessdate=30 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
During the 18th century, [[Joseon]] experienced a golden age following the turbulence of the 17th century; the arts flourished, and new artistic themes and genres emerged.&lt;ref name="Met" /&gt;

Developed in the 18th century, ''chaekgeori'' was personally propagated by King [[Jeongjo of Joseon|Jeongjo]], a bibliophile who promoted studious learning, and embraced by the aristocratic [[yangban]] class of Joseon society.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia" /&gt;&lt;ref name="KOCIS" /&gt; Early ''chaekgeori'' paintings were prized for their illusionistic realism.&lt;ref name="Met" /&gt; In the 19th century, ''chaekgeori'' spread to the ''[[minhwa]]'' folk art of the common class, which resulted in more expressionist and abstract depictions, and the diminished prominence of bookshelves as a primary motif.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia" /&gt; Court ''chaekgeori'' were used in both ritual ceremonies and as decoration, but ''minhwa chaekgeori'' were displayed solely as a decoration in homes.&lt;ref name="KOCIS" /&gt;

==Influences==
King [[Jeongjo of Joseon|Jeongjo]] promoted cultural exchange with the [[Qing dynasty]], leading to increased exposure and importation of Chinese and European cultural items.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia" /&gt; Some of the depicted items in ''chaekgeori'' are of foreign origin from China, Japan, and the West. ''Chaekgado'' incorporated Western linear perspective and shading techniques, and the depicted bookshelves reveal influence of the ''duobaoge'' treasure cabinets of the Qing dynasty, though more symmetrical and systematic.&lt;ref name="Met" /&gt; The ''duobaoge'' itself was influenced by the European [[cabinet of curiosities]] brought into China by Jesuit missionaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Art Historian Brings Little-Known Korean Art to America|url=https://news.dartmouth.edu/news/2016/10/art-historian-brings-little-known-korean-art-america|website=Dartmouth News|publisher=Dartmouth College|accessdate=2 December 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Devil Returns''''' (Original title '''''Jing hun feng yu ye''''') as is a 1982 Hong Kong [[horror film]] directed by Richard Chen Yao-Chi, and written by Gu Bi and Cheung Wing-Cheung.

== Plot ==

Mei-hsun Fang hails a [[taxicab]], and is brought to an abandoned building by the driver, a wanted robber and serial rapist. The man beats and sexually assaults Mei-hsun, and leaves her for dead. Mei-hsun survives, and is able to identify her assailant in a [[police lineup]], resulting in his [[execution by firing squad]], an event which Mei-hsun witnesses in a dream the moment it occurs. The rapist's death does little to comfort Mei-hsun, who is plagued by nightmares and visions of the man, and is horrified to learn that she is pregnant with what she assumes is his child. Mei-hsun tries to have an [[abortion]] in secret, but as the procedure is about to begin, an invisible force attacks the doctor and nurse, and flings the former out a window.

In a last-ditch effort to get rid of the baby, which she is convinced is evil, Mei-hsun throws herself down a flight of stairs, though this merely causes the child to be born a month premature. While Mei-hsun's husband, nanny, and friends all believe he is normal, the baby is in fact supernatural, and torments his mother when no one else is around to witness his actions. One day, to try and put Mei-hsun at ease, the nanny suggests she take the child to a temple where [[exorcism]]s are performed, in attempt to rid the boy of whatever being she believes is corrupting him. The ceremony (during which the baby's head spins around, and objects break) is a success, and the child begins acting normal.

Enraged by what has been done to his son, Mei-hsun's rapist returns from beyond to take revenge, following the nanny to her home, and slamming her head onto a door hook. The nanny's young son visits Mei-hsun to ask if she has seen his mother, who Mei-hsun goes to look for, eventually stumbling onto her hidden body. Mei-hsun rushes home, where the killer murders a visiting female friend and her suitor, impaling the latter with a knife, and causing the former to bleed uncontrollably before asphyxiating her and crushing her head. The killer attacks Mei-hsun, who manages to fend him off long enough for her husband and a police officer to appear, and banish the undead madman by drenching him in wine, and shooting him several times.

== Reception ==
{{expand section|date=November 2014}}
A one and a half out of five was awarded by ''Hysteria Lives!'', which wrote that ''Devil Returns'' was woefully derivative of a number of superior works (the most prominent being ''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]'') and a "[[Schizophrenia|schizophrenic]]" film, albeit one where "the last half an hour is pretty suspenseful – if obviously shamelessly unoriginal".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.hysteria-lives.co.uk/hysterialives/Hysteria/devil_returns.htm|title = ''Devil Returns''|last = Kerswell|first = JA|publisher = Hysteria Lives!|date = 15 July 2012|website = www.hysteria-lives.co.ukaccessdate = 11 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bloody Pit of Horror gave ''Devil Returns'' two and a half stars out of five, stating "The first hour is very solid, the acting is good and the film effectively builds suspense throughout" and "The premise deals with [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|post traumatic stress]] and [[postpartum depression]], the fears of a first time mother that she won't be able to connect with her child and other female/mother centered issues in an insightful and interesting way..." before concluding that the film's shift into being a ''Halloween'' rip-off for the final third was "abrupt, random and basically ruins what had come before it".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://thebloodypitofhorror.blogspot.ca/2012/05/devil-returns-1982.html|title = ''Devil Returns'' (1982)|last = McKinney|first = Justin|publisher = The Bloody Pit of Horror|date = 17 May 2012|website = thebloodypitofhorror.blogspot.ca|accessdate = 11 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''"Do You Know the Way to San Jose"''' is a 1968 popular song written and composed for singer [[Dionne Warwick]] by [[Burt Bacharach]]. [[Hal David]] wrote the lyrics. The song was Warwick's biggest international hit to that point, selling several million copies worldwide and winning Warwick her first [[Grammy Award]]. David's lyrics tell the story of a native of [[San Jose, California]] who, having failed to break into the entertainment field in [[Los Angeles]], is set to return to her hometown.

The song was released on the 1968 RIAA Certified Gold album ''[[Dionne Warwick in Valley of the Dolls]]''. "Do You Know the Way to San Jose" was issued as the follow-up single to the double-sided hit "[[(Theme from) Valley of the Dolls]]"/ "[[I Say a Little Prayer]]" in April 1968. It became Warwick's third consecutive Top Ten song in the closing months of 1967 and into 1968, punctuating the most successful period of Warwick's recording career.

The song peaked at #8 in the UK, Ireland, and Canada. It also charted highly in France, Italy, South Africa, Australia, Germany, Brazil, Mexico, Israel, Lebanon, Japan,and many other countries throughout the world. The single was one of the most successful of Warwick's international hits, selling over 3,500,000 copies worldwide. The flip-side of the single, "Let Me Be Lonely," also penned by Bacharach/David, charted in the Billboard Hot 100 as well and became one of many double-sided hits for Warwick.

==Production==
Bacharach had composed the music for the song before David wrote its lyrics. David had a special interest in San Jose, having been stationed there while in the Navy.&lt;ref name="Bacharach Song by Song"&gt;{{cite book

The track was the last Dionne Warwick single to be recorded at New York City's Bell Studios. It features a prominent use of bass drum, played by session musician [[Gary Chester]]. The engineer was Ed Smith, who devised the famous introduction to the tune by directly attaching a mike to the head of Chester's bass drum.

Warwick did not like "Do You Know the Way to San Jose," and she had to be convinced to record it. In a May 1983 interview with ''[[Ebony (magazine)|Ebony]],'' she said: "It's a dumb song and I didn't want to sing it. But it was a hit, just like [her recent Top Ten hit] '[[Heartbreaker (Dionne Warwick song)|Heartbreaker]]' is. I'm happy these songs were successful, but that still doesn't change my opinion about them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hunt |first=Dennis |date=May 1983 |title=Dionne Wardwick Speaks Out for Strong Black Women |journal=Ebony |publisher=Johnson Publishing Company |url=http://www.books.google.ca/books?id=ZC251QJRupUC |page=100 |accessdate=17 July 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140727093005/http://books.google.ca/books?id=ZC251QJRupUC |archivedate=27 July 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Though she still does not like it, the song remains one of Warwick's most popular chart selections, and she still includes it in almost every concert she performs.

==Awards==
Warwick won her first Grammy, the 1969 [[Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance]], for "Do You Know the Way to San Jose." She told ''[[Jet (magazine)|Jet]]'' in May 2002 that winning this award was the overall highlight of her career.

The song has been recorded on various Burt Bacharach [[tribute album]]s, including by [[Medeski Martin &amp; Wood]] on ''Great Jewish Music: Burt Bacharach'' (1997), by both [[Yazz]] and Dionne Warwick (separately) on ''Tribute to Burt Bacharach &amp; Hal David'' (2002), by [[Trijntje Oosterhuis]] on ''The Look of Love'' (2006), and by [[Kahimi Karie]] on ''All Kinds of People ~Love Burt Bacharach~'' (2010).

In 1977, [[Maureen McCormick]], [[Geri Reischl]] &amp; [[Susan Olsen]] performed the song during a medley on an episode of ''[[The Brady Bunch Hour|The Brady Bunch Variety Hour]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1782">From 1975 and 1985 '''Double X''' was active as an artist collective, their aim was to expand the visibility of art made by women.
The work shown by Double X was not only the work by their members but also by other women, established as well as emerging. One can find many perspectives which are now considered to be the foundation of the [[feminist art movement]] within Double X's founding statement.

''“We are committed to expanding the notion of what is considered art . . . .We recognize a pluralistic art that is both stylistically diverse and expressive of a variety of points of view in a framework such that although different modes may conflict with one another, they do not negate one another.''”

However Double X has been left out of many history books while their legacy is 'incontournable'.
Double X comprised members such as: [[Faith Wilding]],  Audrey Chan, Barbara McCullough, [[Micol Hebron]], [[Nancy Youdelman]], [[Merion Estes]], Connie Jenkins, Carol Kaufman, [[Rachel Rosenthal]], [[Nancy Buchanan]], Jan Lester Martin, Nancy Webber, Marsia Alexander-Clarke, [[Vanalyne Green]], Diane Calder,  Mayde Herberg, Rachel Youdelman, Vaughan Rachel.

'''''Drowned Land''''' is a 1912 [[oil painting|oil sketch]] by the 20th-century Canadian painter [[Tom Thomson]].

The work was painted in the fall of 1912, possibly on the [[Mississagi River]]. It depicts an area desolate and damaged due to flooding via damming. It was purchased by the [[Art Gallery of Ontario]] in [[Toronto]] in 1937 and has remained in the collection ever since. It was produced near the beginning of Thomson's short art career, just as he was beginning a transition from commercial art into a full-time painting.

==Background==
{{Further|Tom Thomson#Exploring Algonquin Park (1912–13)|Artistic development of Tom Thomson#First ventures to Algonquin Park (1912–13)}}

In 1912 after Thomson's initial experience of visiting [[Algonquin Provincial Park|Algonquin Park]], he and his colleague William Broadhead went on a two month expedition up the [[Spanish River (Ontario)|Spanish River]] and into Mississagi Forest Reserve (today [[Mississagi Provincial Park]]).{{sfnb|Hunter|2002|p=27}} Thomson's transition from commercial art towards his original style of painting began to be apparent around this time.{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|p=[https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/biography/#discovering-algonquin-park 10]}}{{sfnb|Silcox|2006|p=23}} Much of his artwork from this trip, mainly oil sketches and photographs, has been lost due to two canoe spills experienced during the trip,{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|p=[https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/biography/#discovering-algonquin-park 10]}} the first spill being on Green Lake in a rain [[squall]] and the second in a series of rapids.{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=119}}{{efn|group=note|Thomson would write to his friend M. J. (John) McRuer: {{quote|[...] 

We started in at Bisco and took a long trip on the lakes around there going up the [[Spanish River (Ontario)|Spanish River]] and over into the Mississauga &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Mississagi River|Mississagi]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; water we got a great many good snapshots of game—mostly moose and some sketches, ''but'' we had a dump in the forty-mile rapids which is near the end of our trip and lost most of our stuff—we only saved 2 rolls of film out of about 14 dozen. Outside of that we had a peach of a time as the Mississauga is considered the finest canoe trip in the world.

==Analysis==

{{See also|Tom Thomson#Industry in nature|Artistic development of Tom Thomson#Photography}}

Thomson's art director while at [[Grip Ltd.]], Albert Robson, identified ''Drowned Land'' as being painted on the Mississagi Forest Reserve canoe trip.{{sfnb|Robson|1937|p=6}} [[Art history|Art historian]] David Silcox has suggested that it was perhaps painted on [[Lake Scugog]] or near [[Owen Sound]].{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|p=[https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/key-works/drowned-land 23]}} It was painted with [[Oil painting|oil]] on [[paper]], which was further embossed with [[canvas]] texture, all mounted on [[plywood]]. A similar support was used for ''View Over a Lake: Shore with Houses''.{{sfnb|Webster-Cook|Ruggles|2002|p=146}}

[[File:Tom Thomson Near Owen Sound.jpg|thumb|''Near Owen Sound'', November 1911. [[National Gallery of Canada]], [[Ottawa]]]]

The painting came right as Thomson was transitioning from commercial art into fine art and indicates his innate talent.{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|p=[https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/key-works/drowned-land 24]}} It is similar to a sketch from the previous year, ''Near Owen Sound'', in terms of colour, drawing and [[Texture (painting)|texture]].{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=120}} On display is a "camera-like precision" and his incredible attention to detail in capturing scenes.{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|p=[https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/key-works/drowned-land 23]}} Indeed, David Silcox has speculated that ''Drowned Land'' as well as other paintings may have been completed with a photograph as a memory aid given their "uncanny precision."{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|p=[https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/significance-and-critical-issues/#photography 63]}} The painting is especially notable for its skill of composition and precision, especially when compared with some of Thomson's other work from this period, such as ''The Canoe'' and ''Old Lumber Dam, Algonquin Park''. These early sketches show how he had not yet established his own form of expression, being particularly dark and dreary compared to his later work.{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|p=[https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/key-works/drowned-land 23]}} The subject of desolation was uncommon for the time, having not been seen in Canadian painting since the works of [[Topography|topographers]] in the early-nineteenth century.{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=120}}

The painting, like others from this period, depicts ideal fishing territory that Thomson likely would have enjoyed.{{sfnb|Hunter|2002|p=29}} Many of his paintings were overt in their depictions of the lumber industry, including dams, [[Pointer boat|pointers]], [[Alligator boat|alligators]] and [[Log driving|drives]],{{sfnb|Wadland|2002|p=95}} the presence of industry being on his mind from early on.{{sfnb|Reid|1971|pp=2–10}} ''Drowned Land'' however is more subtle as it does not directly display any logging equipment. Instead, it presents the damage caused by logging operations and flooding due to damming. A hopeful recovering growth is apparent in the distance behind the skeleton of trees in the foreground.{{sfnb|Wadland|2002|p=95}}

===Death===
On April 30, 1947, McHale took a train from New York to [[Easton, Pennsylvania]] to visit Rhodes. The next day, after leaving Rhodes' residence, she returned to New York City and went to the Empire State Building where she jumped from the 86th floor observatory. A security guard was reportedly standing approximately ten feet from her just before she jumped.

Rhodes did not notice any indication of suicide before McHale left. Detective Frank Murray found her [[suicide note]] in a black pocketbook next to her neatly folded cloth coat over the observation deck wall which read:&lt;ref name="rare_TheM"/&gt;&lt;ref name="real_TheW"&gt;{{Cite web |title=The Wild and Dark History of the Empire State Building, One of New York City's Most Recognized Landmarks, and Known for its Record-Breaking Height |last=Reporter |first=Staff |work=Realty Today |date=November 27, 2015 |accessdate=April 17, 2016 |url=http://www.realtytoday.com/articles/56503/20151127/wild-dark-history-empire-state-building-one-new-york-city.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
[[File:Evelyn McHale.jpg|thumb|The Robert Wiles photo]]

The photo of her body, taken by Robert Wiles, has been compared to the photograph by [[Malcolm Wilde Browne]] of the [[self-immolation]] of Vietnamese Buddhist monk [[Thích Quảng Đức]] who burned himself alive at a busy Saigon road intersection on June 11, 1963, which is widely regarded as among the most iconic suicide photographs. Ben Cosgrove of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' described the photo as "technically rich, visually compelling and ... downright beautiful". Cosgrove described her body as "resting, or napping, rather than ... dead" and appears as if she is "daydreaming of her beau".&lt;ref name="time_'The"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gawk_Spec"&gt;{{Cite web |title=Specter Detector: Courting the Empire State Building's Prettiest Ghost |last=Conaboy |first=Kelly |work=[[Gawker]] |date=September 25, 2015 |accessdate=April 18, 2016 |url=http://gawker.com/specter-detector-courting-the-empire-state-buildings-p-1732169081 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160425222325/http://gawker.com/specter-detector-courting-the-empire-state-buildings-p-1732169081 |archivedate=April 25, 2016 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her picture was also used on the cover of [[Saccharine Trust]]'s album ''[[Surviving You, Always]]'', released in 1984 by [[SST Records]].

[[David Bowie]]'s 1993 video for the single "[[Jump They Say]]" includes a recreation of the image, with the singer splayed atop a smashed car.

The cover of the 1995 album ''[[Gilt (album)|Gilt]]'' by the Tucson band [[Machines of Loving Grace]] uses a color photo that recreates the original image.

The shot is also referenced at the start of Taylor Swift's 'Bad Blood' video.

'''''Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!''''' is a 1965 American [[exploitation film|exploitation]] film directed by [[Russ Meyer]] and co-written by Meyer and Jack Moran. It follows three [[Go-go dancing|go-go dancers]] who embark on a spree of kidnapping and murder in the [[California]] desert.

The film is known for its violence, provocative gender roles, and eminently quotable "dialogue to shame [[Raymond Chandler]]".&lt;ref name="Faster, Pussycat! Kill!

==Plot==
Three wild, uninhibited [[Go-go dancing|go-go dancers]]—Billie, Rosie, and Varla, dance at a club before racing their sports cars across the California desert. They play a high-speed game of [[Chicken (game)|chicken]] on the [[Dry lake|salt flats]] and encounter a young couple, Tommy and Linda, out to run a [[time trial]]. After breaking Tommy's neck in a fight, Varla kidnaps and drugs Linda.

In a small desert town, they stop at a gas station where they see a wheelchair-bound old man and his muscular, dim-witted son. The gas station attendant tells the women that the old man was crippled in a railway accident, “going nuts" as a result, and that he received a large settlement of money that is hidden somewhere around his decrepit house in the desert. Intrigued, Varla hatches a scheme to rob the old man, and the three women follow him back to the ranch, with their captive in tow.

At the ranch they encounter the old man, his younger son (who they learn is called "The Vegetable" due to his [[feebleminded]]ness) and his elder son, Kirk. The group all have lunch together, and Billie taunts Rosie when Varla leaves with Kirk, hoping to seduce him into revealing the location of the money. Linda subsequently escapes the drunken Billie and runs away into the desert. The old man and the younger son pursue in their truck. The younger son catches Linda and seems about to assault her, but he collapses in tears as Varla and Kirk arrive. Kirk finally acknowledges his father’s lecherous nature and the old man’s hold over his younger brother, and he vows to have his younger brother institutionalized. He tries to take the hysterical Linda into town in the truck, but the old man says that he has thrown away the keys, and Kirk and Linda set out across the desert on foot.

Varla drives back to the house and tells Billie and Rosie that they should kill the men and the girl to cover up Linda’s kidnapping and the murder of her boyfriend. Billie refuses, but as she walks away, Varla throws a knife into her back just as the old man and his younger son arrive. Rosie and Varla hit the old man with their car, killing him and knocking over his wheelchair to reveal the money hidden inside. Rosie is stabbed and killed by the younger son while trying to retrieve the knife from Billie's body. Varla tries to ram him into a wall with her car, injuring him. She drives off in the truck and overtakes Kirk and Linda, chasing them into a [[gully]]. Varla and Kirk fight [[Hand-to-hand combat|hand-to-hand]]. She gets the better of him until Linda hits her with the truck, and she dies. Kirk and Linda drive off together in the truck.

==Production==
===Development===
The film was a follow up to an earlier Meyer movie. "`We had just done a film called ''Motorpsycho'', which was about three bad boys, and it had gone through the roof. So I said, `Well, let's do one with three bad girls'."&lt;ref name="trash"&gt;Trashmeister persists in stirring tempest in a D-cup
By Rob Salem Toronto Star 8 Dec 1995: E.3. &lt;/ref&gt;

The screenplay is credited to Jack Moran from an original story by [[Russ Meyer]]. The first draft was titled ''The Leather Girls'' and was written over a brief four-day period by Moran, who also collaborated with Meyer on ''[[Common Law Cabin]]'' and ''[[Good Morning and... Goodbye!]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=McDonough|first1=Jimmy|title=Big Bosoms and Square Jaws: The Biography of Russ Meyer, King of the Sex Film|date=2005|publisher=Crown|location=New York|isbn=1-4000-5044-8|pages=162–163|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; The screenplay went through a second working title&amp;mdash;''The Mankillers''&amp;mdash;and had already begun production when the sound editor, Richard S. Brummer, came up with the now-immortal final title.&lt;ref name="Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!"/&gt; Although neither Moran nor Meyer overtly cited any prior works as inspiration, the plot has been called a “loose remake of ''[[The Desperate Hours (film)|The Desperate Hours]]'', or possibly ''[[The Virgin Spring]]''" by one prominent film critic&lt;ref name="Thanks for the Mammaries"/&gt; and a “[[Pop art|pop-art]] setting of [[Aeschylus]]'s ''[[The Eumenides|Eumenides]]''” by at least one classical scholar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Solomon|first1=Jon|title=The Ancient World in the Cinema|date=2001|publisher=Yale Univ.

===Casting===
Haji had worked with Meyer on ''[[Motor Psycho]]''. She recommended Tura Satana to him.&lt;ref&gt;http://psychotronic.info/2009/10/14/russ-meyer-pfs-interview/&lt;/ref&gt;

Lori Williams later said "Russ didn't want to hire me because he didn't think I had a big enough bust!  I said I could use pushups in my bra, which I did.  He didn't know whether it would work, but then in rehearsals he finally said okay.  I kind of did my part like a cartoon, like the rest of the film, bigger than life."&lt;ref name="mondo"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mondo-digital.com/russmeyer.html|website=Mondo Digital|first= Nathaniel|last= Thompson  |title=MEMORIES FROM RUSS MEYER &amp; CAST AT THE EGYPTIAN THEATER, LOS ANGELES, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Filming===
''Faster, Pussycat!'' had a modest budget of about $45,000 and was shot in black and white in order to save money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=DeFino|first1=Dean|title=Faster, Pussycat! Kill!

The film began shooting at the Pussycat Club, a [[strip club]] in [[Van Nuys]], before moving on to the California desert later that night. The film's early racing scene was shot on the dry [[Dry lake|salt flats]] of Lake Cunniback, the gas station scene was filmed in the town of Randsburg&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.therialtoreport.com/2017/11/19/faster-pussycat-kill-kill/|title=Adult Film Locations 10: Faster, Pussycat!

Meyer, who got his start making movies while serving in the [[United States Army|US Army]]'s 166th Signal Photographic Company during [[World War II]], had a reputation for running strictly regimented film shoots with a small crew composed largely of former Army buddies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=DeFino|first1=Dean|title=Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!|date=2014|publisher=Wallflower Press|location=London|isbn=9780231167390|pages=19–20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Actor [[Charles Napier (actor)|Charles Napier]], who appeared in five of Meyer's films, said that "Working with Russ Meyer was like being in the first wave [[Normandy landings|landing in Normandy]] during World War II."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=McDonough|first1=Jimmy|title=Big Bosoms and Square Jaws: The Biography of Russ Meyer, King of the Sex Film|date=2005|publisher=Crown|location=New York|isbn=1-4000-5044-8|page=54|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meyer considered the ''Faster, Pussycat!'' shoot no different, saying "It was the usual thing with me. It's like being in the military. Everybody has to get up and do their jobs to get things together, and that's it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rabin|first1=Nathan|title=Russ Meyer (Interview)|url=http://www.avclub.com/article/russ-meyer-13556|website=A.V. Club|accessdate=8 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meyer's directorial style and the rules he imposed upon cast and crew caused clashes with his equally strong-willed star, Tura Satana.&lt;ref name="Russ Meyer: An Interview"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=DeFino|first1=Dean|title=Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!|date=2014|publisher=Wallflower Press|location=London|isbn=9780231167390|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

There was also friction between Susan Bernard and her director and co-stars, much of which they attributed to the presence of her mother on the set (necessitated by Bernard being a sixteen-year-old [[Minor (law)|minor]] at the time). Bernard has said in interviews that she was truly scared of Satana, and some have thought that this contributed to her performance as a frightened kidnapping victim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=McDonough|first1=Jimmy|title=Big Bosoms and Square Jaws: The Biography of Russ Meyer, King of the Sex Film|date=2005|publisher=Crown|location=New York|isbn=1-4000-5044-8|pages=170–172|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Sutana, "Everybody [on set] did everything from moving props to marking scenery and marking spots where we had to be in the next take.  I had to stage the fight scenes because nobody else knew how to do them, and so literally when I did the fight scenes, I really had to pick up each and every one of those guys and carry them through in order for them to look realistic. Basically I had to lay one guy on the floor because he was afraid he was going to get hurt.  A lot of it actually had to be done in reverse,so try to imagine doing a fight scene that way."&lt;ref name="mondo"/&gt;
===Music===
The film's title song, "Faster Pussycat!", was performed by California band, the Bostweeds. The lyrics were written by [[Rick Jarrard]] and the music was written and sung by [[Lynn Ready]], who formed the Bostweeds and sang leads. The track was never released commercially, but it did appear in February 1966 as a promotional-only [[Single (music)|45]] [[Single (music)|single]] without a [[A-side and B-side|B-side]].&lt;ref name="cosmicmindatplay.wordpress.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=One Side Wonders #11: The Bostweeds – Faster Pussycat!

==Reception and influence==
===Box Office===
''Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!'' premiered in [[Los Angeles]] on August 6, 1965.&lt;ref name="TCMDb"&gt;{{cite web|title=Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/74621/Faster-Pussycat-Kill-Kill-/|website=Turner Classic Movies Database|accessdate=24 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Atypically for a Meyer film, it was a box office failure upon its initial release.&lt;ref name="LA Times"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; 

"When it first came out, it was not successful," said Meyer. "At the time, people didn't understand that women could have a relationship with other women."&lt;ref name="trash"/&gt;
===Critical===
It was generally dismissed as an exploitative "skin flick" by the few critics who took any note of it at all.&lt;ref name="Ebert" /&gt; [[John L. Wasserman]] of the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', for example, reviewed a double bill of ''Faster, Pussycat!'' and ''[[Mudhoney (film)|Mudhoney]]'' in April 1966, saying that "''Pussycat'' has the worst script ever written, and ''Mudhoney'' is the worst movie ever made."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wasserman|first1=John|title=Two Films with But One Thought|work=San Francisco Chronicle|issue=41|date=19 April 1966}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Oliver|first1=Myrna|title=Russ Meyer, 82; Iconic Sexploitation Filmmaker|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2004/sep/22/local/me-meyer22|accessdate=19 April 2015|work=Los Angeles Times|date=22 September 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;
===Cult Status===
In the years since, the film has been regarded more favorably, gaining in both commercial and critical stature.&lt;ref name="Ebert" /&gt; As of April 2015 it holds a "fresh" rating on film review aggregator site [[Rotten Tomatoes]], with 73% (nineteen of twenty-six) critic reviews positive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/faster_pussycat_kill_kill/#|website=Rotten Tomatoes|accessdate=19 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his review of the film's 1995 re-release, [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning critic [[Roger Ebert]] gave the film three out of four stars.&lt;ref name="Ebert"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ebert|first1=Roger|title=Faster Pussycat!

Ruby Rich]] said that when she first saw ''Faster, Pussycat!'' in the 1970s she "was absolutely outraged that [she'd] been forced to watch this [[Misogyny|misogynist]] film that objectified women and that was really just short of [[Softcore pornography|soft-core porn]]."&lt;ref name="Myers"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Myers|first1=Emma|title=Profiles in Criticism: B.

'''''Finian's Rainbow''''' is a 1968 Irish-American [[musical film]] directed by [[Francis Ford Coppola]] and starring [[Fred Astaire]] and [[Petula Clark]]. The [[screenplay]] by [[E. Y. Harburg]] and [[Fred Saidy]] is based on their [[Finian's Rainbow|1947 stage musical of the same name]].  It is a [[fantasy]] about an Irishman and his daughter who steal a [[leprechaun]]'s magic pot of gold and emigrate to the United States, where they become involved in a dispute between rural landowners and a greedy, racist [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]]. 

The film was nominated for several [[Academy Awards]], [[Golden Globe Award|Golden Globe Awards]], and a [[Writers Guild of America Award]].

==Plot==
A lovable rogue named Finian McLonergan absconds from his native [[Ireland]] with a pot of gold secreted in a carpetbag, plus his daughter Sharon in tow. His destination is Rainbow Valley in the mythical state of Missitucky, where he plans to bury his treasure in the mistaken belief that, given its proximity to [[Fort Knox]], it will multiply.

Hot on his heels is the [[leprechaun]] Og, desperate to recover his stolen crock before he turns human. Among those involved in the ensuing shenanigans are Woody Mahoney, a ne'er-do-well dreamer who woos Sharon; his mute sister Susan, who expresses herself in [[dance]]; Woody's good friend and business partner Howard, an [[African American|African-American]] [[botany|botanist]] determined to grow [[Menthol cigarette|mentholated tobacco]]; and bombastic Senator Billboard Rawkins, who wears his [[bigotry]] as if it were a badge of honor.

Complications arise when Rawkins, believing there is gold in Rainbow Valley, attempts to seize the land from the people who live there and makes some racial slurs while doing so. Sharon furiously wishes he would turn black himself&amp;mdash;and, because she is in close proximity to the magical pot of gold, which is capable of granting three wishes, Rawkins does exactly that. Sharon is accused of [[witchcraft]] and sentenced to be burned at the stake unless she can make him white again.

To save his daughter, Finian tries to find the pot of gold, unaware Susan has discovered it and hidden it under a bridge. Rawkins eventually meets Og, who quickly realizes what caused the senator's change in race. Seeing that the change of skin color did nothing to alter his hateful [[racism]], Og casts a spell to make Rawkins more open-minded.

Sharon and Woody gather in the barn to be married, but the sheriff, his deputies, and the local district attorney barricade the doors and promise to burn the building down if Rawkins is not white by sunrise. Og meets with Susan on the bridge under which the gold is hidden and wishes she could talk. When she begins to speak, Og realizes they are standing above the gold.

For a brief moment he considers using the final wish to retain his leprechaun status and return to the fairy world. After a passionate kiss, he decides he would rather remain human with Susan and wishes for Rawkins to be white once more. Thanks to the now-empty crock helping to put out an accidental fire that was about to consume the barn, Howard's mentholated tobacco experiments become successful, ensuring financial success for all the poor people of Rainbow Valley, both white and black. Sharon and Woody are wed, and bid a fond farewell to Finian, who leaves Rainbow Valley in search of his own rainbow.

==Production==

===Development===
Since the musical was such a success on stage, there had always been interest in filming it. [[MGM]] was interested in filming it in 1948 as a vehicle for [[Mickey Rooney]]. However, Harburg set the price for the rights at $1 million and wanted creative control.&lt;ref name="rainbow"&gt;Deck Is Stacked Against Broadway
By Philip K. Scheuer Special to the Los Angeles Times. The Washington Post, Times Herald (1959-1973) [Washington, D.C] 26 Dec 1967: C7.&lt;/ref&gt;

For a time, a German company wanted to make it. In 1954, the Distributors Corporation of America wanted to make it as an animated film. A soundtrack of the score was recorded by several stars, but the film was not completed. In 1958, the authors of the musical teamed with [[Sidney Buchman]] to produce the film independently but the film did not proceed.&lt;ref name="new"&gt;VIEW FROM A LOCAL VANTAGE POINT
By A.H. WEILER. New York Times (1923-Current file) [New York, N.Y] 17 Apr 1960: X5.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1960, the rights were held by Marvin Rothenberg who wanted [[Michael Gordon (film director)|Michael Gordon]] to direct and [[Debbie Reynolds]] to star. It was announced the film would be budgeted at $2 million and be released by [[United Artists]].&lt;ref name="new"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Director's First Comedy a Smash: They Told Gordon He Couldn't Make One---Till 'Pillow Talk'!

By A.H. WEILER. New York Times (1923-Current file) [New York, N.Y] 25 Dec 1960: X9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Harburg stated in 1960 that he was told part of the reason it was so difficult to get a film version made was Hollywood was scared of fantasy musicals.&lt;ref&gt;Age of the Unthinking' Blamed on Broadcasters
By John Crosby. The Washington Post, Times Herald (1959-1973) [Washington, D.C] 22 May 1960: G13.&lt;/ref&gt; Another reason was the McCarthyism of the period.&lt;ref name="rainbow"/&gt;

In 1965, [[Harold Hecht]] bought the film rights and hired Harburg and Saidy to write a script and some new songs. Hecht said he intended to film in nine months. "This time we really mean business," said Harburg. "We've gotten a substantial deal and participation in money and production. Up until now ''Finian'' has been making so much money on the road that we didn't want to kill the goose laying all those golden eggs. But you become more idealistic as you grow older and you tend to stop thinking about yourself."&lt;ref&gt;Smutty Nose to 93rd St.: More About Movies
By A.H. WEILER. New York Times (1923-Current file) [New York, N.Y] 07 Nov 1965: X11.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Warner Bros.===
In September 1966 Warner Bros. announced they had the rights and they would make a film produced by Joseph Landon and starring [[Fred Astaire]], with the aim to get [[Tommy Steele]] as the leprechaun. The budget was expected to be $4 million.&lt;ref&gt;MOVIE CALL SHEET: Warners to Film 'Rainbow'

[[Warner Bros.]] had optioned the film rights to the stage musical, and they were on the verge of expiring. With ''[[Camelot (film)|Camelot]]'' having proven to be more costly than anticipated, and its commercial success still undetermined since it had not been released, [[Jack L. Warner]] was having second thoughts about another musical project, but when he saw [[Petula Clark]] perform on her opening night at the Coconut Grove in the [[Ambassador Hotel (Los Angeles)|Ambassador Hotel]] in [[Los Angeles]], he knew he had found the ideal Sharon.&lt;ref name=CD&gt;''Finian's Rainbow'' Original Soundtrack CD liner notes&lt;/ref&gt;

He decided to forge ahead and hoped for the best, despite his misgivings about having nearly-novice "hippie" director Francis Ford Coppola at its helm. Although Clark had made many films in the 1940s and 1950s in her native Great Britain, this would be her first starring role in ten years, and her first film appearance since rising to international fame with "[[Downtown (Petula Clark song)|Downtown]]" four years earlier.

It was known that Dick Van Dyke was considered to play the role of Finian, back in 1965, however, financial problems caused the filming to be postponed, and Van Dyke dropped out of consideration.  (Source:  "The Films of Fred Astaire")

[[Fred Astaire]], whose last movie musical had been ''[[Silk Stockings (film)|Silk Stockings]]'' eleven years earlier, and who had concentrated on his TV specials in the interim, was persuaded at the age of sixty-nine to return to the screen to portray the title character. Given his status as a screen [[legend]] and to accommodate his talents, the role was given a musical presence it had not had on stage, and he was given top rather than the original third billing.

While a construction crew transformed more than nine acres of backlot into Rainbow Valley, complete with a [[narrow gauge railway]], schoolhouse, general store, post office, houses, and barns, Coppola spent five weeks rehearsing the cast, and before principal photography began, a complete performance of the film was presented to an audience on a studio [[soundstage]].&lt;ref name=PetNet&gt;[http://www.petulaclark.net/films/finians.html ''Finian's Rainbow'' at PetulaClark.net]&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[liner notes]] she wrote for the 2004 [[Rhino Records]] limited, numbered edition [[compact disc|CD]] release of the [[soundtrack]], Clark recalls that old-[[Hollywood]] Astaire was befuddled by Coppola's contemporary methods of film-making and balked at dancing in "a real field with cow dung and rabbit holes." Although he finally acquiesced to filming a sequence in the [[Napa Valley]] near Coppola's home, the bulk of the movie was shot on studio soundstages and the backlot, leaving the finished film with jarring contrasts between [[reality]] and make-believe.&lt;ref name="CD" /&gt;

Clark was nervous about her first Hollywood movie and particularly concerned about dancing with old pro Astaire. He later confessed he was just as worried about singing with her.&lt;ref name="CD" /&gt; The film was partially [[choreographed]] by Astaire's long-time friend and collaborator [[Hermes Pan (choreographer)|Hermes Pan]], who was fired by Coppola during filming.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dvdjournal.com/quickreviews/f/finiansrainbow.q.shtml DVDJournal.com]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Finian's Rainbow'' proved to be Astaire's last major movie musical, although he went on to dance with [[Gene Kelly]] during the linking sections of ''[[That's Entertainment, Part 2]]''.

Clark recalls that Coppola's approach was at odds with the subject matter. "Francis... wanted to make it more real. The problem with ''Finian's Rainbow'' is that it's sort of like a fairy tale... so trying to make sense of it was a very delicate thing."&lt;ref name="CD" /&gt; Coppola opted to fall somewhere in the middle, with mixed results. Updating the story line was limited to changing Woody from a labor organizer to the manager of a [[sharecropper]]s' [[cooperative]], making college-student Howard a research botanist, and a few minor changes to the lyrics in the [[Burton Lane]]-[[E. Y. Harburg]] score, such as changing a reference to [[Carmen Miranda]] to [[Zsa Zsa Gabor]]. Other than that, the plot remains firmly entrenched in an era that predates the [[Civil Rights Movement]].

Because preview audiences found the film overly long, the musical number "Necessity" was deleted prior to its release, although the song remains on the soundtrack album. It can also be heard as background music, when Senator Rawkins first shows up in Rainbow Valley in his attempt to buy Finian out.

In August 2012, Clark told the BBC Radio 4 show The Reunion that she and her fellow cast members smoked [[marijuana]] during the filming of the movie. "There was a lot of Flower Power going on," she said. &lt;ref name=Telegraph&gt;{{cite web|title=The Telegraph entry|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/culturenews/9505840/Fred-Astaire-used-cannabis-claims-Petula-Clark.html|accessdate=March 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==
Released in major cities as a [[Roadshow theatrical release|roadshow presentation]] complete with intermission, at a time when the popularity of movie musicals was on the wane, the film was dismissed as inconsequential by many critics, who found Astaire's obviously frail and aged appearance shocking and Steele's manic performance annoying. In the ''[[New York Times]]'', [[Renata Adler]] described it as a "cheesy, joyless thing" and added, "there is something awfully depressing about seeing ''Finian's Rainbow''... with Fred Astaire looking ancient, far beyond his years, collapsed and red-eyed... it is not just that the musical is dated... it is that it has been done listlessly and even tastelessly."&lt;ref&gt;[https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9E01E4DD1E38E134BC4852DFB6678383679EDE ''New York Times'' review]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'', on the other hand, thought it was "the best of the recent roadshow musicals... Since ''[[The Sound of Music (film)|The Sound of Music]]'', musicals have been... long, expensive, weighed down with unnecessary production values and filled with pretension... ''Finian's Rainbow'' is an exception... it knows exactly where it's going, and is getting there as quickly and with as much fun as possible... it is the best-directed musical since ''[[West Side Story (film)|West Side Story]]''. It is also enchanting, and that's a word I don't get to use much... it is so good, I suspect, because Astaire was willing to play it as the screenplay demands... he... created this warm old man... and played him wrinkles and all. Astaire is pushing 70, after all, and no effort was made to make him look younger with common tricks of lighting, makeup and photography. That would have been unnecessary: He has a natural youthfulness. I particularly want to make this point because of the cruel remarks on Astaire's appearance in the ''New York Times'' review by Renata Adler. She is mistaken."&lt;ref&gt;[http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19681014/REVIEWS/810140301/1023 ''Chicago Sun-Times'' review]&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Time Out London]]'' calls it an "underrated musical... the best of the latter-day musicals in the tradition of [[Vincente Minnelli|Minnelli]] and [[MGM]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.timeout.com/film/reviews/66679/finians_rainbow.html |title=''Time Out'' review |access-date=2007-12-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090507234622/http://www.timeout.com/film/reviews/66679/finians_rainbow.html |archive-date=2009-05-07 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Highly praised by all was Petula Clark, whom Ebert described as "a surprise. I knew she could sing, but I didn't expect much more. She is a fresh addition to the movies: a handsome profile, a bright personality, and a singing voice as unique in its own way as [[Barbra Streisand|Streisand]]'s."  John Mahoney of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' said she "invites no comparisons, bringing to her interpretation of Sharon her own distinctive freshness and form of delivery."&lt;ref name="PetNet" /&gt; In the ''[[Daily News (New York)|New York Daily News]]'', Wanda Hale cited her "winsome charm which comes through despite a somewhat reactive role."&lt;ref name="PetNet" /&gt; Joseph Morgenstern of ''[[Newsweek]]'' said she "looks lovely" and "sings beautifully, with an occasional startling reference to the phrasing and timbre of [[Ella Logan]]'s original performance."&lt;ref name="PetNet" /&gt; ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' observed, "Miss Clark gives a good performance and she sings the beautiful songs like a nightingale."&lt;ref name="PetNet" /&gt;  Clearly, in the United States at least, Clark was known only as a singer, although she had appeared as an actress in British films since she was a child.

The film earned $5.1 million in rentals in North America.&lt;ref&gt;"Big Rental Films of 1969", ''Variety'', 7 January 1970 p 15&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and honors==
The film was nominated for the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy]] but lost to ''[[Oliver!

==Home media==
The film was released on [[DVD]] on March 15, 2005. Presented in [[anamorphic widescreen]] format, it captures all of Astaire's footwork, most of which was unseen in the original release. {{citation needed|date=February 2014}} It has audio tracks in English and French, with both the dialogue and songs translated into the latter language. Fluent in French, Clark was the sole cast member to record the foreign version.

Bonus features include commentary by Francis Ford Coppola, who focuses mostly on the film's shortcomings, a featurette on the world premiere on Finian's Rainbow, and the original theatrical trailer.

The film was released on [[Blu-ray]] on March 7, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blu-ray.com/movies/Finians-Rainbow-Blu-ray/134934/ ''Blu-Ray.com'' review]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Fools Rush In''''' is a 1997 American [[romantic comedy]] film starring [[Matthew Perry]] and [[Salma Hayek]], directed by [[Andy Tennant]].

==Plot ==
Alex Whitman ([[Matthew Perry]]) is an architect from New York City who is sent to [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] to supervise the construction of a nightclub that his firm has been hired to build. Alex is a strait-laced [[White Anglo-Saxon Protestant|WASP-ish]] type who, while researching possible menus items for the new nightclub, meets Isabel Fuentes ([[Salma Hayek]]), a free-spirited Mexican-American photographer. Alex and Isabel are overtaken by lust at first sight and end up spending the night together; however, their immediate attraction doesn't last in the cold light of day, and they don't see each other for another three months.

When they do meet again, it's because Isabel has some interesting news for Alex: she's pregnant with his child. Isabel decides to keep and raise the child. Knowing that becoming a single mom will disappoint her family, she asks Alex to accompany her to a relative's birthday, hoping that when her family asks about the father of her baby, she can at least say that they met him once. Alex agrees, and in spite of some cultural differences, finds himself more attracted to Isabel's personality and art.

Though Isabel is ready to say goodbye after the party, Alex suddenly suggests that they pursue a real relationship. He proposes and they quickly get married (with an Elvis impersonator serving as witness), but after Isabel meets Alex's mom ([[Jill Clayburgh]]) and Alex is confronted by Isabel's father (Tomas Milian), both start to wonder if "doing the right thing" was just that, especially as Alex tries to balance his career in New York with Isabel's desire to continue working in Nevada.

Isabel has a complication with the pregnancy and tells Alex that she lost the baby. Disappointed, Alex returns to working on the nightclub while Isabel goes home to Mexico to recuperate with relatives. Upon realizing that he wants to pursue a family with Isabel more than his career, Alex travels to rural Mexico to find Isabel, where her relatives reveal that she is still very much in love with him, and still pregnant. He catches up with her on the way to a hospital, and she gives birth on the Hoover Dam.

The birth of their daughter coincides with their legal divorce, but they soon remarry with both of their families present at the Grand Canyon.

[[File:Frederic-Clay-ILN.jpg|right|thumb|Frederic Clay]] 
'''Frederic Emes Clay''' (3 August 1838 – 24 November 1889) was an English composer known principally for his music written for the stage. Clay, a great friend of [[Arthur Sullivan]]'s, wrote four [[comic opera]]s with [[W. S. Gilbert]] and introduced the two men.

While working as a civil servant in the Treasury department, Clay began composing seriously in the early 1860s.  His first big success was ''[[Ages Ago]]'' (1869), a short comic opera with a libretto by [[W. S. Gilbert]], for the small [[Gallery of Illustration]].  Other pieces with Gilbert and others followed, and Clay turned to composing full-time after his father died in 1873.  That year, he composed a successful opera-bouffe version of ''[[The Black Crook]]'' for the [[Alhambra Theatre]].  Clay's last piece with Gilbert was  ''[[Princess Toto]]'' (1875).  He also composed two [[cantata]]s.  His last two works were both successful operas composed in 1883, ''The Merry Duchess'' and ''The Golden Ring''.  He then suffered a stroke that paralysed him at age 44.

==Life and career==
Clay was born in Paris&lt;ref name="TBDP1"&gt;"Death of Sir Frederic Clay", ''The Birmingham Daily Post'', 29 November 1889, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; to English parents, [[James Clay (author)|James Clay]] (1804–1873), a member of parliament, and his wife, Eliza Camilla Woolrych.  Clay was the fourth of six brothers and sisters.  His father was celebrated as a player of [[whist]] and the author of a treatise on that subject, as well as an amateur composer.  His mother also had a musical background, as her mother had been an opera singer.&lt;ref name=dnb&gt;Knowles, Christopher.  [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/5559 "Clay, Frederic Emes (1838–1889)",] ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004, accessed 10 October 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Clay was educated at home by private tutors in London, studying piano and violin, and then music composition under [[Bernhard Molique]] and, in 1863, with [[Moritz Hauptmann]] in [[Leipzig]], Germany.&lt;ref name=Grove&gt;Sullivan, Arthur.  [http://diamond.boisestate.edu/gas/gilbert/plays/ages_ago/clay.html "Frederic Clay (1838–1889)",] ''Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians'', reprinted at The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive&lt;/ref&gt; He then worked as a civil servant in the Treasury department while also pursuing composing.&lt;ref name="ERA1"&gt;"Death of Mr Frederic Clay", ''The Era'', 30 November 1889, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

After the death of his father in 1873, his inheritance enabled him to become a full-time composer.&lt;ref name=Scowcroft&gt;Scowcroft, Philip L.  [http://www.musicweb-international.com/garlands/101.htm A 101st Garland of British Light Music Composers], Classical Music Web, MusicWeb-International.com&lt;/ref&gt; With the exception of some songs, hymns, instrumental pieces and two [[cantata]]s, his compositions were nearly all written for the stage.  In the mid-1860s, Clay and his friend [[Arthur Sullivan]] became frequent guests at the home of [[John Scott Russell]].  By about 1865, Clay became engaged to Scott Russell's youngest daughter Alice, and Sullivan wooed the middle daughter Rachel.  The Scott Russells welcomed the engagement of Alice to Clay, but he broke it off.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, p. 87; Jacobs, p. 53.  The Scott Russells forbade the relationship between Sullivan and Rachel, because Sullivan had uncertain financial prospects, although Rachel continued to see him covertly.  At some point in 1868, Sullivan started a simultaneous (and secret) affair with the eldest daughter, Louise, but both relationships had ceased by early 1869.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early career===
[[File:Ages Ago.png|left|thumb|300px|A scene from ''[[Ages Ago]]'' in ''[[The Illustrated London News]]'']]
Clay wrote his first short play for the amateur stage in 1859 called '''The Pirate's Isle'', and completed the short comic play ''Out of Sight'' the following year.&lt;ref name="ERA1"/&gt; His first professionally produced piece was an opera entitled ''Court and Cottage'', with a libretto by [[Tom Taylor]], which was produced at [[Covent Garden Theatre]] in 1862.  In 1865, for the same theatre, he composed another opera, the unsuccessful ''Constance'' (1865), with a libretto by [[Thomas William Robertson]].&lt;ref&gt;Gänzl, p. 16, says: "Constance was written to a rather 'heavy' libretto. ... It was a tale of love and patriotism set in Poland under the Russians – something of a Polish ''Tosca'', but with a happy ending when the hero and heroine are rescued first by a singing [[vivandiere]] and then by the Polish army. The music ... was noted as being promising if rather light and, after being performed eighteen times as a curtain-raiser to the Covent Garden pantomime of ''Cinderella'', it sank into obscurity."  The score is available at the [[National Library of Scotland]].&lt;/ref&gt; With [[B. C. Stephenson]], he wrote three pieces played by amateurs: ''The Pirate's Isle'', ''Out of Sight'' and ''The Bold Recruit'' (1868), and with [[W. S. Gilbert]] he wrote ''[[Ages Ago]]'' (1869) for [[Thomas German Reed]]'s [[Gallery of Illustration]].&lt;ref name=Grove/&gt; This piece ran for 350 performances and was revived several times.&lt;ref name=Scowcroft/&gt; Clay introduced Gilbert to Arthur Sullivan during a rehearsal for ''Ages Ago''.&lt;ref&gt;Crowther, Andrew, [http://diamond.boisestate.edu/gas/other_gilbert/ages_ago/crowther_analysis.html Analysis of Ages Ago] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060903092123/http://diamond.boisestate.edu/gas/other_gilbert/ages_ago/crowther_analysis.html |date=3 September 2006 }}, The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;  ''The Bold Recruit'' was revived at a benefit by German Reed at the [[Gallery of Illustration]] in 1870 as a companion piece to ''Ages Ago''.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Era (newspaper)|The Era]]'', 24 July 1870, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

These were followed by ''[[The Gentleman in Black]]'' (1870, also with Gilbert), ''In Possession'' (1871, also for German Reed), ''[[Happy Arcadia]]'' (1872, with Gilbert), ''Oriana'' (1873, with a libretto by [[James Albery]]), ''Green Old Age'' and ''Cattarina'' (both 1874, with libretti by [[Robert Reece]]), ''[[Princess Toto]]'' (1875, the last collaboration between Clay and Gilbert), and ''Don Quixote'' (1876).&lt;ref name=Scowcroft/&gt;  ''Ages Ago'' (a one-act piece) and ''Princess Toto'' (a three-act [[comic opera]]) are considered to be among Clay's most tuneful and attractive works.

He also furnished incidental music for a revival of ''[[Twelfth Night]]''.&lt;ref name="ERA1"/&gt;

===Cantatas and later career===
Clay's two cantatas were ''The Knights of the Cross'' (1866) and ''Lalla Rookh'' (containing perhaps Clay's best-known song, "I'll sing thee songs of Araby" and also "Still this golden lull"), which was produced successfully at the Brighton Festival in 1877.&lt;ref name=Grove/&gt; Clay had difficulty finding work in London and moved to America.  There he met with only mixed success and returned to England in 1881.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; His last works were ''The Merry Duchess'' (1883) at the [[Royalty Theatre]], starring [[Kate Santley]] and in which [[Louie Henri]] also appeared,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=qUyGtqatz2gC&amp;pg=PA72 Information about ''The Merry Duchess'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gänzl, p. 228&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The Golden Ring'' (starring [[Marion Hood]]) (1883), both with words by [[G. R. Sims]].  The latter was written for the reopening of the Alhambra, which had been burned to the ground the year before.&lt;ref&gt;Gänzl, p. 230&lt;/ref&gt; These shows were both successful and showed an artistic advance upon Clay's previous work.&lt;ref&gt;Gänzl, pp. 228 and 230&lt;/ref&gt;

Clay's friend, Sir Arthur Sullivan, wrote: "In all his works Clay showed a natural gift of graceful melody and a feeling for rich harmonic colouring. [His songs included] 'She wandered down the mountain side,' 'Long ago' and 'The Sands of Dee'".&lt;ref name=Grove/&gt; Other songs that achieved popularity are "Gipsy John" and "Who Knows".&lt;ref name=Scowcroft/&gt;&lt;ref name=Timesobit/&gt;

After conducting the second performance of ''The Golden Ring'' in December 1883, Clay suffered a stroke that paralysed him and cut short his productive life.&lt;ref name="TBDP1"/&gt; In 1889 at the age of 51, he was found drowned in his bath at the home of his sisters in [[Marlow, Buckinghamshire|Great Marlow]], England, presumably a suicide.  He was buried in [[Brompton cemetery]].&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

A '''happening''' is a performance, event, or [[Situationist International|situation]] meant to be considered [[art]], usually as [[performance art]]. The term was first used by [[Allan Kaprow]] during the 1950s to describe a range of art-related event or multiple events.

==Background==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2017}}
Happenings occur anywhere and are often multi-disciplinary, with a [[nonlinear narrative]] and the active participation of the audience. Key elements of happenings are planned but artists sometimes retain room for [[improvisation]].  This [[new media art]] aspect to happenings eliminates the boundary between the artwork and its viewer.

In the late 1960s, perhaps due to the depiction in films of [[hippie]] culture, the term was used much less specifically to mean any gathering of interest from a [[pool hall]] meetup or a [[jam session|jamming]] of a few young people to a beer blast or fancy formal party.

==History==

===Origins===
[[Image:SurvivalResearch2006.jpg|thumb|[[Survival Research Laboratories]] Performance in L.A. 2006]]
[[Allan Kaprow]] first coined the term "happening" in the spring of 1959 at an art picnic at [[George Segal (artist)|George Segal]]'s farm to describe the art pieces that were going on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Critical Introduction to Twentieth-Century American Drama: Volume 3 Beyond Broadway |author=Christopher W. Bigsby |authorlink=Christopher Bigsby |year=1985 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location= |isbn=9780521278966 |page=45 |accessdate=September 5, 2012 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=_gZPUSNnDXwC&amp;lpg=PA45&amp;dq=Allan%20Kaprow%20coined%20happening&amp;pg=PA45#v=onepage&amp;q=Allan%20Kaprow%20coined%20happening&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first appearance in print was in Kaprow's famous "Legacy of Jackson Pollock" essay that was published in 1958 but primarily written in 1956. "Happening" also appeared in print in one issue of the [[Fluxus at Rutgers University|Rutgers University]] undergraduate literary magazine, ''Anthologist''.&lt;ref&gt;Joan M. Marter and Simon Anderson, ''Off Limits: Rutgers University and the [[Avant-Garde]], 1957-1963'', [[Rutgers University]] Press, 1999, p10. {{ISBN|0-8135-2610-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The form was imitated and the term was adopted by artists across the [[United States|U.S.]], [[Germany]], and [[Japan]]. [[Jack Kerouac]] referred to Kaprow as "The Happenings man", and an ad showing a woman floating in outer space declared, "I dreamt I was in a happening in my [[Maidenform]] brassiere".{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}

Happenings are difficult to describe, in part because each one is unique and completely different from one another.  One definition comes from [[Noah Wardrip-Fruin|Wardrip-Fruin]] and [[Nick Montfort|Montfort]] in ''The New Media Reader'', "The term 'Happening' has been used to describe many performances and events, organized by Allan Kaprow and others during the 1950s and 1960s, including a number of theatrical productions that were traditionally scripted and invited only limited audience interaction."&lt;ref&gt;Noah Wardrip-Fruin and Nick Montfort, eds., ''The New Media Reader'' (Cambridge: The MIT Press, 2003): p.&amp;nbsp;83. {{ISBN|0-262-23227-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Another definition is, "a purposefully composed form of theatre in which diverse alogical elements, including nonmatrixed performing, are organized in a compartmented structure".&lt;ref&gt;Michael Kirby, ''Happenings: An Illustrated Anthology'', scripts and productions by Jim Dine, Red Grooms, Allan Kaprow, Claes Oldenburg, Robert Whitman (New York: E. P. Dutton &amp; Co., Inc., 1965), p.&amp;nbsp;21.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Canadian theatre critic and playwright [[Gary Botting]], who himself had "constructed" several happenings, wrote in 1972: "Happenings abandoned the matrix of story and plot for the equally complex matrix of incident and event."&lt;ref&gt;[[Gary Botting]], "Happenings," in ''The Theatre of Protest in America'' (Edmonton: Harden House, 1972) 12-17&lt;/ref&gt;

Kaprow was a student of [[John Cage]], who had experimented with "musical happenings" at [[Black Mountain College]] as early as 1952.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gary Botting]], "Happenings", in ''The Theatre of Protest in America'', p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;  Kaprow combined the theatrical and visual arts with discordant music. "His happenings incorporated the use of huge constructions or sculptures similar to those suggested by Artaud," wrote  Botting, who also compared them to the "impermanent art" of Dada. "A happening explores negative space in the same way Cage explored silence. It is a form of symbolism: actions concerned with 'now' or fantasies derived from life, or organized structures of events appealing to archetypal symbolic associations."&lt;ref&gt;Botting, "Happenings", pp. 12-13&lt;/ref&gt; A "Happening" of the same performance will have  different outcomes because each performance depends on the action of the audience.  In New York City especially, "Happenings" became quite popular even though many had neither seen nor experienced them.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}&lt;!--It is difficult to believe this is even possible; who says so?--&gt;

Happenings can be a form of participatory new media art, emphasizing an interaction between the performer and the audience. In his ''Water'', [[Robert Whitman]] had the performers drench each other with coloured water. "One girl squirmed between wet inner tubes, ultimately struggling through a large silver vulva."&lt;ref&gt;Botting, "Happenings", p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; [[Claes Oldenburg]], best known for his innovative sculptures, used a vacant house, his own store, and the parking lot of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics in Los Angeles for ''Injun'', ''World's Fair II'' and ''AUT OBO DYS''.&lt;ref&gt;Botting, "Happenings, pp. 16-17.&lt;/ref&gt;  The idea was to break down the fourth wall between performer and spectator; with the involvement of the spectator as performer, objective criticism is transformed into subjective support. For some happenings, everyone present is included in the making of the art and even the form of the art depends on audience engagement, for they are a key factor in where the performers' spontaneity leads.&lt;ref&gt;Botting, "Happenings," 12-17&lt;/ref&gt;

Later happenings had no set rules, only vague guidelines that the performers follow based on surrounding props. Unlike other forms of art, Happenings that allow chance to enter are ever-changing. When chance determines the path the performance will follow, there is no room for failure. As Kaprow wrote in his essay, "'Happenings' in the New York Scene", "Visitors to a Happening are now and then not sure what has taken place, when it has ended, even when things have gone 'wrong'. For when something goes 'wrong', something far more 'right,' more revelatory, has many times emerged".&lt;ref&gt;''New Media Reader'', p 86&lt;/ref&gt;

Kaprow's piece ''18 Happenings in 6 Parts'' (1959) is commonly cited as the first happening, although that distinction is sometimes given to a 1952 performance of ''Theater Piece No. 1'' at [[Black Mountain College]] by [[John Cage]], one of Kaprow's teachers in the mid-1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Botting, "Happenings", 13&lt;/ref&gt; Cage stood reading from a ladder, [[Charles Olson]] read from another ladder, [[Robert Rauschenberg]] showed some of his paintings and played wax cylinders of [[Édith Piaf]] on an Edison horn recorder, [[David Tudor]] performed on a [[prepared piano]] and [[Merce Cunningham]] danced.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Dale Hobbs, ''The End of the American Avant Garde'', NYU Press, 1997, p109. {{ISBN|0-8147-3539-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  All these things took place at the same time, among the audience rather than on a stage.  Happenings flourished in [[New York City]] in the late 1950s and early 1960s.  Key contributors to the form included [[Carolee Schneemann]], [[Red Grooms]], [[Robert Whitman]], [[Jim Dine]] ''Car Crash'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comm.unt.edu/histofperf/BeckyWalker/Becky_Descriptions.htm Performance Descriptions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100709225423/http://www.comm.unt.edu/histofperf/BeckyWalker/Becky_Descriptions.htm |date=2010-07-09 }} Retrieved July 10, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; [[Claes Oldenburg]], [[Robert Delford Brown]], [[Lucas Samaras]], and [[Robert Rauschenberg]]. Some of their work is documented in Michael Kirby's book ''Happenings'' (1966).&lt;ref&gt;Michael Kirby, ''Happenings: An Illustrated Anthology'', scripts and productions by Jim Dine, Red Grooms, Allan Kaprow, Claes Oldenburg, Robert Whitman (New York: E. P. Dutton &amp; Co., Inc., 1965).&lt;/ref&gt; Kaprow claimed that "some of us will become famous, and we will have proven once again that the only success occurred when there was a lack of it".&lt;ref&gt;New Media Reader, p 87&lt;/ref&gt; In 1963 [[Wolf Vostell]] made the Happening ''TV-Burying'' at the [[Fluxus at Rutgers University#Yam Festival|Yam Festival]] in coproduction with the [[Smolin Gallery]] and in 1964 the Happening ''You'' in [[Great Neck, New York]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medienkunstnetz.de/works/tv-burying/images/2/|title=Media Art Net - Vostell, Wolf: TV Burying|first=Media Art|last=Net|date=25 September 2017|website=www.medienkunstnetz.de|accessdate=25 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medienkunstnetz.de/works/you/ Happening ''You'', Great Neck, New York, 1964]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the summer of 1959, [[Red Grooms]] along with others (Yvonne Andersen, Bill Barrell, Sylvia Small and Dominic Falcone) staged the non-narrative "play" ''Walking Man'', which began with construction sounds, such as sawing. Grooms recalls, "The curtains were opened by me, playing a fireman wearing a simple costume of white pants and T-shirt with a poncholike cloak and a Smokey Stoverish fireman's helmet. Bill, the 'star' in a tall hat and black overcoat, walked back and forth across the stage with great wooden gestures. Yvonne sat on the floor by a suspended fire engine. She was a blind woman with tin-foil covered glasses and cup. Sylvia played a radio and pulled on hanging junk. For the finale, I hid behand a false door and shouted pop code words. Then the cast did a wild run around and it ended".&lt;ref name="Early Years"&gt;Judith Stein, "The Early Years: 1937-1960", ''Red Grooms: A Retrospective'' (Philadelphia: Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, 1985)&lt;/ref&gt; Dubbing his 148 Delancey Street studio The Delancey Street Museum, Grooms staged three more happenings there, ''A Garden'', ''The Burning Building'' and ''The Magic Trainride'' (originally titled ''Fireman's Dream''). No wonder Kaprow called Grooms "a Charlie Chaplin forever dreaming about fire".&lt;ref name="Early Years"/&gt; On the opening night of ''The Burning Building'', [[Bob Thompson (painter)|Bob Thompson]] solicited an audience member for a light, since none of the cast had one, and this gesture of spontaneous theater recurred in eight subsequent performances.&lt;ref name="Early Years"/&gt;
The Japanese artist [[Yayoi Kusama]] staged [[nude]] happenings during the late '60s in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/52ab168a-4188-11e1-8c33-00144feab49a.html#axzz1kDck8rzm|title=Subscribe to read|website=Financial Times|accessdate=25 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dangerousminds.net/comments/scream_against_the_sky_yayoi_kusamas_self_obliteration|title=Scream Against the Sky: Yayoi Kusama’s Self-Obliteration, avant garde weirdness, 1967|date=15 July 2013|publisher=|accessdate=25 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{double image|right|Marta Minujín Leyendo las noticias1.jpg|200|Marta Minujín Leyendo las noticias3.jpg|200|Argentine artist [[Marta Minujín]] in a 1965 happening, ''Reading the news'', in which she got into the [[Río de La Plata]] wrapped in newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marta-minujin.com/happenings_performances.html |title=HAPPENINGS AND PERFORMANCES |accessdate= 25 July 2013|work=Marta-minujin.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Happenings emphasize the organic connection between art and its environment. Kaprow supports that "happenings invite us to cast aside for a moment these proper manners and partake wholly in the real nature of the art and life. It is a rough and sudden act, where one often feels "dirty", and dirt, we might begin to realize, is also organic and fertile, and everything including the visitors can grow a little into such circumstances." 
Happenings have no plot or philosophy, but rather is materialized in an improvisatory fashion. There is no direction thus the outcome is unpredictable. "It is generated in action by a headful of ideas...and it frequently has words but they may or may not make literal sense. If they do, their meaning is not representational of what the whole element conveys. Hence they carry a brief, detached quality. If they do not make sense, then they are acknowledgement of the sound of the word rather than the meaning conveyed by it."{{Citequote|date=June 2017}}

Due to the convention's nature, there is no such term as "failure" which can be applied. "For when something goes "wrong", something far more "right", more revelatory may emerge. This sort of sudden near-miracle presently is made more likely by chance procedures." As a conclusion, a happening is fresh while it lasts and cannot be reproduced.&lt;ref&gt;Wardrip-Fruin, 1986&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding happenings, [[Red Grooms]] has remarked, "I had the sense that I knew it was something. I knew it was something because I didn't know what it was. I think that's when you're at your best point. When you're really doing something, you're doing it all out, but you don't know what it is."&lt;ref name="Early Years"/&gt;

The lack of plot as well as the expected audience participation can be likened to Augusto Boal's [[Theater of the Oppressed]], which also claims that "spectator is a bad word". Boal expected audience members to participate in the theater of the oppressed by becoming the actors. His goal was to allow the downtrodden to act out the forces oppressing them in order to mobilize the people into political action. Both Kaprow and Boal are reinventing theater to try to make plays more interactive and to abolish the traditional narrative form to make theater something more free-form and organic.&lt;ref&gt;Augusto Boal, "Theater of the Oppressed", in ''The New Media Reader'', edited by Noah Wardrip-Fruin and Nick Montfort, London: The MIT Press, 2003, p 341–52&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contribution toward digital media===

[[Allan Kaprow]]'s and other artists of the 1950s and 1960s that performed these Happenings helped put "new media technology developments into context".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Montfort |first1=Nick |last2=Wardrip-Fruin |first2=Noah|date=February 2003 |title=The New Media Reader |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DQYXoRx9CcEC&amp;pg=PT102 |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |publisher=The MIT Press |page=83 |isbn=9780262232272}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Happenings allowed other artists to create performances that would attract attention to the issue they wanted to portray. Currently happenings today can be found with Jazz in a whole new way through the artistic collaboration of renowned musicians American saxophonist [[David Liebman]], French jazz pianist Jean-Marie Machado, and multimedia visual artist [[Barbara Januszkiewicz]]. their group Jazz Vision Trio&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jazzvisiontrion.info {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170712085033/http://www.jazzvisiontrion.info/ |date=2017-07-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is using new media techniques and real-time improvising with jazz and art.

===Around the world===
In 1959 the French artist [[Yves Klein]] first performed [[Zone de Sensibilité Picturale Immatérielle]]. The work involved the sale of documentation of ownership of empty space (the Immaterial Zone), taking the form of a cheque, in exchange for [[gold]]; if the buyer wished, the piece could then be completed in an elaborate ritual in which the buyer would burn the cheque, and Klein would throw half of the gold into the [[Seine]].&lt;ref name="Stich"&gt;Yves Klein, Stich, Cantz 1995, p156&lt;/ref&gt; The ritual would be performed in the presence of an art critic or distinguished dealer, an art museum director and at least two witnesses.&lt;ref name="Stich"/&gt;

In 1960, [[Jean-Jacques Lebel]] oversaw and partook in the first European Happening ''L'enterrement de la Chose'' in [[Venice]]. For his performance there – called ''Happening Funeral Ceremony of the Anti-Process'' – Lebel invited the audience to attend a ceremony in formal dress. In a decorated room within a grand residence, a draped 'cadaver' rested on a plinth which was then ritually stabbed by an 'executioner' while a 'service' was read consisting of extracts from the French décadent writer [[Joris-Karl Huysmans]] and le [[Marquis de Sade]]. Then pall-bearers carried the coffin out into a gondola and the 'body' – which was a mechanical sculpture by [[Jean Tinguely]] – was ceremonially slid into the canal.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Nechvatal]], ''Immersive Ideals / Critical Distances''. [[LAP Lambert Academic Publishing]], 2009. p. 323&lt;/ref&gt;

Poet and painter [[Adrian Henri]] claimed to have organized the first happenings in England in [[Liverpool]] in 1962,&lt;ref&gt;B. J. Moore-Gilbert, ''Cultural Revolution?: The Challenge of the Arts in the 1960s'', Routledge, 1992, p90. {{ISBN|0-415-07824-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; taking place during the Merseyside Arts Festival.&lt;ref&gt;Günter Berghaus, "Happenings in Europe: Trends, Events and Leading Figures", in ''Happenings and Other Acts'', edited by Mariellen R.

One of the participants, [[Jeff Nuttall]], went on to organize a number of further happenings, often working with his friend [[Bob Cobbing]], [[sound poetry|sound poet]] and [[performance poetry|performance poet]].

In [[Tokyo]] in 1964, [[Yoko Ono]] created a happening by performing her "Cut Piece" at the Sogetsu Art Center. She walked onto the stage draped in fabric, presented the audience with a pair of scissors, and instructed the audience to cut the fabric away gradually until the performer decides they should stop.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Concannon, "[http://kevinconcannon.squarespace.com/storage/pdf/CutPiecePAJ.pdf Yoko Ono's ''Cut Piece'': From Text to Performance and Back Again]" ''PAJ—A Journal of Performance and Art'' 30, no. 3 (September 2008): 81–93, citation on 81–82. doi:0.1162.{{clarify|date=July 2012}}&lt;!--Invalid doi.--&gt; Retrieved July 31, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Belgium]], the first happenings were organized around 1965–1968 in [[Antwerp]], [[Brussels]] and [[Ostend]] by artists [[Hugo Heyrman]] and [[Panamarenko]].

In the [[Netherlands]], the first documented happening took place in 1961, with the Dutch artist and performer Wim T. Schippers emptying a bottle of soda water in the North Sea near Petten. Later on, he organized random walks in the Amsterdam City Centre.  [[Provo (movement)|Provo]] organized happenings around the little statue "Het Lieverdje" on the Spui, a square in the centre of [[Amsterdam]], from 1966 till 1968. [[Police]] often raided these events.

In the 1960s [[Joseph Beuys]], [[Wolf Vostell]], [[Nam June Paik]], [[Charlotte Moorman]], [[Dick Higgins]], and [[HA Schult]] staged Happenings in Germany.

In Canada, [[Gary Botting]] created or "constructed" happenings between 1969 (in St. John's, Newfoundland) and 1972 (in Edmonton, Alberta), including ''The Aeolian Stringer'' in which a "captive" audience was entangled in string emanating from a vacuum cleaner as it made its rounds (similar to Kaprow's "A Spring Happening", where he used a power lawnmower and huge electric fan to similar effect); ''Zen Rock Festival'' in which the central icon was a huge rock with which the audience interacted in unpredictable ways; ''Black on Black'' held in the Edmonton Art Gallery; and "Pipe Dream," set in a men's washroom with an all-female "cast".&lt;ref&gt;[[Gary Botting]], "Happenings" in ''The Theatre of Protest in America'' (Edmonton: Harden House, 1972) 12-17&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Australia]], the [[Yellow House Artist Collective]] in [[Sydney]] housed 24-hour happenings throughout the early 1970s.

Behind the [[Iron Curtain]], in [[Poland]], artist and theater director [[Tadeusz Kantor]] staged the first happenings starting in 1965. In the second half of 1970s painter and performer [[Krzysztof Jung]] ran the Repassage gallery, which promoted performance art in Poland.&lt;ref&gt;''Krzysztof Jung''. Catalogue of the exhibition edited by Grzegorz Kowalski and Maryla Sitkowska, Warsaw 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Also, in the second half of the 1980s, a student-based happening movement [[Orange Alternative]] founded by Major [[Waldemar Fydrych]] became known for its much attended happenings (over 10 thousand participants at one time) aimed against the military regime led by [[Wojciech Jaruzelski|General Jaruzelski]] and the fear blocking the Polish society ever since the [[Martial Law]] had been imposed in December 1981.

Since 1993 the artist [[Jens Galschiøt]] have made political happenings all over the [[world]], in November 1993 he made the happening [[my inner beast]] where twenty sculptures were erected within 55 hours without the knowledge of the authorities all over [[Europe]]. [[Pillar of Shame]] is a series of Galschiøt's sculptures. The first was erected in [[Hong Kong]] on 4 June 1997, ahead of the handover from British to Chinese rule on 1 July 1997, as a protest against China's crackdown of the  [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]]. On 1 May 1999, a [[Pillar of Shame]] was set up on the Zócalo&lt;ref name="zocalo"&gt;{{cite book

It stood for two days in front of the Parliament to protest the oppression of the region's indigenous people.

The non-profit, artist-run organization, iKatun,&lt;ref&gt;ikatun.com&lt;/ref&gt; artist group, The Institute of Infinitely Small Things, has reflected the use of "Happenings" influence while incorporating the medium of internet. Their aim is one that "fosters public engagement in the politics of information".{{Full citation needed|date=November 2010}}  Their project entitled ''The International Database of Corporate Commands'' presents a scrutinizing look at the super-saturating advertisements slogans, and "commands" of companies.   "The Institute for Infinitely Small Things uses these commands to conduct research performances- performances in which we attempt to enact, as literally as possible, what the command tells us to do and where it tells us to do it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=D'Ignazio|first1=Catherine|title=Corporate Commands|url=http://www.ikatun.org/kanarinka/corporate-commands/|website=ikatun.org|publisher=kanarinka projects|accessdate=7 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a user may look at a long list of slogans on the website database section, and may submit, in text, his or her take on the most literal way to act out the slogan/ command.  The iKatun team will then act out the slogan in a research-performance related way.  This means of performance art draws on the collaboration of the web world and tangible reality to conduct a new, modern Happening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ikatun.org/institute/infinitelysmallthings/corporatecommands/about.php|title=The International Database of Corporate Commands|website=www.ikatun.org|accessdate=25 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=June 2016}}&lt;!--Website says nothing at all about the subject.--&gt;

===Philosophy===
Kaprow explains that happenings are not a new style, but a moral act, a human stand of great urgency, whose professional status as art is less critical than their certainty as an ultimate existential commitment. He argues that once artists have been recognized and paid, they also surrender to the confinement, rather the tastes of the patrons (even if that may not be the intention on both ends). "The whole situation is corrosive, neither patrons nor artists comprehend their role...and out of this hidden discomfort comes a stillborn art, tight or merely repetitive and at worst, chic." Though the we may easily blame those offering the temptation, Kaprow reminds us that it is not the publicist's moral obligation to protect the artist's freedom, and artists themselves hold the ultimate power to reject fame if they do not want its responsibilities.&lt;ref&gt;Wardrip-Fruin, 1987&lt;/ref&gt;

==Festivals as happenings==
Art and music festivals play a large role in positive and successful happenings. Some of these festivals include [[Burning Man]] and [[Oregon Country Fair]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oregoncountryfair.org/faqs.php|title=FAQs «  Oregon Country Fair|website=www.oregoncountryfair.org|accessdate=25 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.burningman.com/whatisburningman/about_burningman/faq_what_is.html#Tickets|title=Event FAQ - Burning Man|website=www.burningman.com|accessdate=25 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with the famous [[Allan Kaprow]], [[Burning Man]] frowns on the idea of spectators and stresses the importance of everyone being involved to create something amazing and unique. Both parties embody the "audience" and instead of creating something to show the people, the people become involved in helping create something incredible and spontaneous to the moment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.khtt.net/page/13520/en|title=sandra1985adisa@yahoo.com|website=Khatt Foundation|accessdate=25 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=June 2016}}&lt;!--"Burning Man" is not mentioned on this website, let alone what the relationship with the audience might be.--&gt; Both of these events are happenings that are recreated and special each year and are always new and organic. These events draw crowds of close to 50,000 people each year and reach more people than just the attendees with their messages and ideals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jambase.com/articles|title=Music News &amp; Concert Reviews|date=15 March 2015|website=JamBase|accessdate=25 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=June 2016}}&lt;!--Does not mention attendance figures, let alone reaching people who do not attend.--&gt;

Two symmetrical patterns are considered to be [[Equivalent symmetry|equivalent]] if they have exactly the same types of [[symmetry]]. As recently as 1891, it was finally proved that there are only 17 inequivalent symmetry patterns in the plane. However, the [[Moors]], who lived in [[Spain]] from the eighth to the fifteenth centuries, were aware of all 17 types of symmetry patterns. Examples of the patterns were used to decorate the [[Alhambra]], a Moorish fortress in [[Granada]].

* works inadvertently left unfinished or never completed by their authors
* surviving extracts of larger works subsequently lost as wholes
* works deliberately constructed as fragmentary pieces

The deliberately undeveloped literary sort of fragment played an especially important role in literary [[Romanticism]]. German literature of the Romantic period has left many such fragments. In English literature, note [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge]]'s unfinished (but published as a fragment in 1816) "[[Kubla Khan]]; or, A Vision in a Dream: A Fragment".
In contemporary literature [[Dimitris Lyacos]] employs fragment sequences in order to develop an elliptical narrative alluding to a universe of unattainability and loss.&lt;ref&gt;Fran Mason.

'''Live Nation Entertainment''' is an [[United States|American]] global [[Entertainment|entertainment company]], formed from the [[Mergers and acquisitions|merger]] of [[Live Nation (events promoter)|Live Nation]] and [[Ticketmaster]] in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-pascrell-live-nation-concert-ticketing-20180517-story.html|title=Everyone's worst fears about the Live Nation-Ticketmaster merger have come true|last=Jr|first=Bill Pascrell|website=latimes.com|access-date=2018-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; It owns, leases, operates, has booking rights for and/or equity interests in a large number of U.S. entertainment venues.

== Merger ==
The merger initially received regulatory approval in Norway and Turkey in 2009.&lt;ref name="competitioncomission"&gt;{{cite press release|title=Ticketmaster and Live Nation Welcome Competition Commission Ruling on Merger|date=December 22, 2009|publisher=Ticketmaster Entertainment|url=http://investors.livenationentertainment.com/files/doc_news/2009/Live%20Nation%20Ticketmaster.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2009, the United Kingdom's [[Competition Commission]] provisionally ruled against the merger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/epicenter/2009/10/live-nationticketmaster-merger-faces-obstacles-here-and-abroad/|title=Live Nation/Ticketmaster Merger Faces Obstacles Here and Abroad|author=Van Buskirk, Eliot|date=October 12, 2009|work=Wired|accessdate=2009-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 22, 2009, the Competition Commission reversed its decision and cleared the proposed merger.&lt;ref name="competitioncomission" /&gt; The [[United States Justice Department]] approved the merger on January 25, 2010, with some conditions to which both parties agreed.&lt;ref name="Chmielewski"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-ct-ticketmaster26-2010jan26,0,5237319,full.story|title=Ticketmaster-Live Nation merger gets Justice Department's approval|author=Chmielewski, Dawn C. and Fritz, Ben and Lewis, Randy|date=January 26, 2010|accessdate=January 26, 2010|publisher=The Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the agreement with governments to merge, Ticketmaster had to sell its ownership in its self-ticketing company, [[Paciolan]], and Live Nation Entertainment was placed under a 10-year court order prohibiting it from retaliating against venues that choose to accept competitors' ticket-selling contracts, and it "must allow venues that sign deals elsewhere to take consumer ticketing data with them".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/01/25/AR2010012503555.html|title=Live Nation, Ticketmaster merge after approval|author=Nakashima, Ryan|date=January 25, 2010|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=January 26, 2010|agency=Associated Press}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Live Nation and Ticketmaster Entertainment Merger Receives U.S. Department of Justice Clearance|date=January 25, 2010|publisher=Live Nation and Ticketmaster Entertainment via CNN|url=http://money.cnn.com/news/newsfeeds/articles/prnewswire/NY43093.htm|accessdate=January 26, 2010}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the new company had to license a copy of its ticketing software to two companies—[[Anschutz Entertainment Group]] (AEG) and either [[Comcast Spectacor]] or another "suitable" company—so that both companies could compete "head-to-head" with Ticketmaster for venues’ business. AEG was given the option after five years to buy the software, replacing it with something else, or partnering with another ticketing company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/epicenter/2010/01/doj-approves-modified-ticketmaster-live-nation-merger/|title=DOJ Approves Modified Ticketmaster, Live Nation Merger|author=Van Buskirk, Eliot|date=January 25, 2010|work=Wired News|accessdate=January 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Opposition ===

The merger that formed the company was opposed by members of the [[United States Congress]], business rivals, and the [[Computer &amp; Communications Industry Association]] (CCIA), whose members include [[Google]], [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]], [[Microsoft]], [[Yahoo]], [[Intuit]], and [[eBay]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/23/business/global/23ticketmaster.html|title=British Regulator Supports Live Nation-Ticketmaster Merger|first=Chris V.|last=Nicholson|date=22 December 2009|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ticketnews.com/Ticketmaster-Live-Nation-merger-twenty-five-thousand-contact-DOJ-to-oppose-the-deal11019818|title=Ticketmaster / Live Nation merger: 25,000 contact DOJ to oppose the deal|author=Branch Jr., Alfred|date=January 19, 2010|accessdate=January 26, 2010|publisher=TicketNews|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100122153341/http://www.ticketnews.com/Ticketmaster-Live-Nation-merger-twenty-five-thousand-contact-DOJ-to-oppose-the-deal11019818|archivedate=January 22, 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bruce Springsteen]] said the merger "would make the current ticket situation even worse for the fan than it is now would be Ticketmaster and Live Nation coming up with a single system, thereby returning us to a near monopoly situation in music ticketing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bruce Springsteen "Furious" At Ticketmaster, Rails Against Live Nation Merger|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/rockdaily/index.php/2009/02/04/bruce-springsteen-furious-at-ticketmaster-rails-against-live-nation-merger/|date=February 4, 2009|publisher=Rolling Stone|accessdate=2009-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a January 25, 2010 press release, the TicketDisaster.org group—a coalition of consumer rights and anti-trust groups—also issued the following statement about the proposed Live Nation-TicketMaster merger:&lt;blockquote&gt;"Despite its "monopoly-like dominance" controlling 70 to 80 percent of all concert ticket sales, Ticketmaster is unabashedly seeking to grow its empire - all to the detriment of the average fan. Ticketmaster is now trying to dampen competition by merging with Live Nation, the nation's largest concert promoter and second largest primary ticket seller. That merger is coming under heavy fire from consumer and industry groups and Members of Congress, particularly because of the clear anti-consumer and anti-competitive effects. As the Department of Justice reaches the final round of reviewing this merger, only one question must be answered: will the merger lead to increased prices, poorer service, or less innovation?"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== 2018 Allegations of Antitrust Violations and DOJ Investigation ===

In 2018, the [[United States Department of Justice]] launched an investigation following complaints that Live Nation had engaged in anti-competitive practices following the merger. [[Anschutz Entertainment Group|AEG]] has alleged that Live Nation had pressured them into using [[Ticketmaster]] as a vender. If AEG had refused, they would have lost out on business. The allegations of antitrust violations have resulted in a re-examination of the merger between Ticketmaster and Live Nation. Much of the initial criticisms of the merger has been re-affirmed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/01/arts/music/live-nation-ticketmaster.html Live Nation Rules Music Ticketing, Some Say With Threats]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://news.avclub.com/doj-is-investigating-live-nation-for-possible-antitrust-1824255557&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Radiohead stage collapse}}
In June 2013, Live Nation, two other organizations and an engineer were charged with 13 charges under Ontario health and safety laws following the collapse of a stage at a [[Radiohead]] concert in 2012 that killed one crew member.&lt;ref name="Technician death"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/radiohead-drum-technician-death-1.4422702|title='I feel so let down by Canada': Radiohead and drum tech's parents demand answers in his Toronto death|work=CBC News|access-date=2017-11-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/story/2013/06/07/toronto-live-nation-ontario-ministry-of-labour-optex.html|title=Live Nation, engineer charged in Radiohead stage collapse|date=7 June 2013|work=[[CBC News]]|accessdate=8 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Live Nation issued a statement denying any wrongdoing and vowing to "vigorously defend" itself.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/thepitch/1310-waiting-on-justice-for-the-radiohead-stage-collapse-that-killed-scott-johnson/|title=Waiting on Justice for the Radiohead Stage Collapse That Killed Scott Johnson {{!}} Pitchfork|last=Marc|first=Hogan|date=3 October 2016|website=pitchfork.com|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=1 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2017, after several delays, the case was dropped under the [[R v Jordan (2016)|Jordan ruling]], which sets strict timelines on trials.&lt;ref name="Technician death" /&gt; On 30 November 2017, [[CBC Television|CBC]] reported that the chief coroner of Ontario, Dirk Huyer, will hold an inquest into Johnson's death.&lt;ref name="Technician death"/&gt;

The '''Louis XV style''' or '''''Louis Quinze''''' is a style of architecture and decorative arts which appeared during the reign of [[Louis XV of France]]. From 1710 until about 1730, the period known as the Regency, it was largely an extension of the "[[Style Louis XIV]]" of his great-grandfather and predecessor, [[Louis XIV of France]]. From about 1730 until about 1750, it became more original, decorative and exuberant, in what was known as the ''[[rocaille]]'' style, under the influence of the King's mistress, [[Madame de Pompadour]].  It marked the beginning of the European [[Rococo]] movement.  From 1750 until the King's death in 1774, it became more sober, ordered, and began to show the influences of [[neoclassicism]].

==Architecture==
The chief architect of the King was [[Jacques Gabriel]] from 1734 until 1742, and then his more famous son, [[Ange-Jacques Gabriel]], until the end of the reign. His major works included the [[Ecole Militaire]], the ensemble of buildings overlooking the Place Louis XV (now [[Place de la Concorde]]; 1761-1770), and the [[Petit Trianon]] at Versailles (1764).  Over the course of the reign of Louis XV, while interiors were lavishly decorated, the facades gradually became simpler, less ornamented and more classical. The facades designed by Gabriel were carefully rhymed and balanced by rows of windows and columns, and, on large buildings like the Place de la Concorde, often featured grand arcades on the street level, and classical pediments or balustrades on the roofline. Ornamental features sometimes included curving wrought-iron balconies with undulating rocaille designs, similar to the rocaille decoration of the interiors.&lt;ref&gt;Ducher (1988) p. 140&lt;/ref&gt;

The religious architecture of the period was also sober and monumental, and it tended, at the end of the reign, toward the neoclassical. Major examples include the Church of Saint-Genevieve (now the [[Panthéon]]), built from 1758 to 1790 to a design by [[Jacques-Germain Soufflot]], and the Church of Saint-Philippe-du-Roule (1765-1777) by [[Jean Chalgrin]], which featured an enomrous barrel-vaulted nave.&lt;ref&gt;Ducher (1988) p. 140&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Interior decoration==

Interior decoration during the reign of Louis XV fell into two periods;  the first especially featured [[rocaille]] ornament, sculpted sinuous curves and counter-curves, often in floral and vegetative patterns, applied to the panels of the walls, often with medallions in the center.  The panels large mirrors were framed in often framed with sculpted palm leaves or other floral decoration. Unlike the rococo style, the ornament was usually restrained, symmetrical and balanced. In the early period of the style, the designs were often inspired by French versions of Chinese art, animals, especially monkeys (''[[Singerie]]'') and arabesques, or themes taken from works of the artists of the period, including [[Jean Bérain the Younger]], [[Watteau]] and [[Jean Audran]].&lt;ref&gt;Ducher (1988) pg. 142&lt;/ref&gt;

After 1750, in reaction to the excesses of the earlier style, the designs and moldings on the interior walls were white or pale colored, more geometric, decorated with sculpted garlands, roses, and crowns, and ornamented with designs inspired by ancient Greece and Rome. This style was found in the ''Salon de Compagnie'' at the [[Petit Trianon]], and it was the predecessor of the [[Louis XVI style]].&lt;ref&gt;Ducher (1988) pg. 142-43&lt;/ref&gt;

==Furniture==
{{Main|Louis XV furniture}}
The chairs of the Louis XV style, compared with those of Louis XIV,  were characterized by lightness, comfort and harmony of lines. The traverse support of the legs disappeared, and the chairs were designed so one could sit back comfortably. The legs had a curving 'S shape. The carved decor featured sculpted fleurettes, palmettes, seashells, and foliage. The ''dossier'', or back of the chair, was ''violones'', slightly curved like a violin.  Several new variants of chairs appeared including the ''bergere'', with stuffed upholstered arms, ''A confessional'', with upholstered and padded arms; the ''Marquise'', a ''bergere'' seating two persons, with a low back, and short arms.&lt;ref&gt;Ducher (1988) pg. 144&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Console table]] was a table designed to be placed against a wall, usually used for displaying art objects;  it was almost always in the rocaille style, with undulating curves, modeled after seashells and foliage. very sinuous, twisting rocaille modeled after seashells and foliage.

The [[Commode]] was a new type of furniture which had first appeared late in the reign of Louis XIV.  It was a chest drawers resting on four S-shaped legs.  It usually featured gilded bronze ornament, but during the reign of Louis XV, it was also covered with plaques of exotic woods of different colors in geometric patterns or floral shapes.  A particular variation, called the ''façon de Chine'' or "Chinese fashion"  emerged, which contrasted the gilded bronze against black lacquered wood. A large number of skilled ''[[ébéniste]]s'' from around Europe were employed to fine wood Commodes and other furniture for the King.  They included [[Jean-François Oeben]], [[Roger Vandercruse Lacroix]], [[Gilles Joubert]], [[Antoine Gaudreau]], and [[Martin Carlin]].&lt;ref&gt;Ducher (1988) pg. 144&lt;/ref&gt;

A variety of other new types of furniture appeared, including the ''chiffonier'', a cabinet with five drawers, and the ''table de toilette'', a kind of desk-table with three shutters, the central one having a mirror.&lt;ref&gt;Ducher (1988) pg. 144&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in the reign of Louis XV, between 1755 and 1760, tastes in furniture began to change. The ''rocaille'' designs began more discreet and restrained, and the influence of antiquity and neo-classicism began to appear in new designs of furniture.  The Commodes became to have more geometric forms;  the decoration turned from rocaille to geometric forms, garlands of oak leaves, flowers and classical motifs. A new type of tall cabinet, the ''Cartonnier'', made its appearance between 1760 and 1765.  It took its inspiration from Greek mythology and architecture, with friezes, vaulting, sculpted trophies, bronze lion heads,  and other classic, elements.&lt;ref&gt;Ducher (1988) pg. 146-47&lt;/ref&gt;

==Painting==

The dominant subjects of painting in the early reign of Louis XV were mythology and history, the same as those of Louis XV.  Later in the reign, when Louis began to construct new apartments within the palaces of Versailles and Fontanebleau, his tastes turned more to pastoral scenes and genre painting. [[Madame de Pompadour]], the king's mistress, was also one of the major patrons of the artists of the period.&lt;ref&gt;Guéganic (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

The most favored artist of the King was [[François Boucher]],  He produced for the King art of every description; religious paintings, genre scenes, landscapes, pastorals, and exotic scenes, frequently featuring gatherings of cheerful and seductive nudes. As the king's other great passion was hunting, he painted ''Leopard hunt'' (1765) and ''Crocodile hunt'' (1767) for the King's new apartments at Versailles. In 1767, near the end of the career, he was named First Painter of the King.&lt;ref&gt;Guéganic (2008) pg.76&lt;/ref&gt;

Other notable painters included [[Jean Baptiste Oudry]], whose hunting scenes decorated royal apartments in Versailles, and were made into tapestries and popular engravings; the portrait artists [[Maurice Quentin de la Tour]] and [[Jean-Marc Nattier]], who made portraits for the royal family and aristocracy; and the genre painter [[Jean-Baptiste-Siméon Chardin]].&lt;ref&gt;Guéganic (2008) pg.76-77&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Sculpture==
The sculptural styles of the ''Grand Siécle'' of Louis XIV continued to dominate during most of the reign of Louis XV.  Madame de Pompadour was a particularly enthusiastic patroness of sculpture, and many busts and statues were made of her or commissioned by her.  The most prominent sculptors of the early period were the [[Guillaume Coustou the Younger]] and his brother, [[Guillaume Coustou the Elder]], [[Robert Le Lorrain]], and [[Edmé Bouchardon]].  Bouchardon created the equestrian statue of Louis XV for the center of the new Place Louis XV (now [[Place de la Concorde]]) which was modeled after that of Louis XIV in the Place Louis le Grand (now [[Place Vendôme]]) by [[François Girardon]].  After the death of Bouchardon, the statue was finished by another major monumentalist of the period, [[Jean-Baptiste Pigalle]]. In the later part of the reign of Louis XV, sculptors began to give greater attention to the faces; the leaders of this new style were [[Jean-Antoine Houdon]] noted for his busts of celebrated authors and statesmen, and [[Augustin Pajou]], who made notable portrait busts of the natural scientist [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon]] and [[Madame du Barry]].  Sculpture began to reach a larger popular audience during this period, thanks to reproductions made from terra cotta and unglazed porcelain.&lt;ref&gt;Guéganic (2008) page 77&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Urbanism: monumental squares and fountains==

In the later years of his reign, Louis constructed a major new square in the center of the city, Place Louis XV (now [[Place de la Concorde]], with a harmonious row of new buildings, designed by [[Ange-Jacques Gabriel]]. He built other monumental squares in the centers of [[Rennes]] and [[Bordeaux]].  He also constructed one monumental fountain in Paris, the [[Fontaine des Quatre-Saisons]], with statuary by [[Edmé Bouchardon]]; but it was poorly sited on a narrow street, and while it had an abundance of sculpture, because of the antiquated water supply of Paris, it produced very little water. The fountain was criticized by [[Voltaire]] in a letter to the Count de Caylus in 1739, while it was still under construction:

{{quote|I have no doubt that Bouchardon will make of this fountain a fine piece of architecture;  but what kind of fountain has only two faucets where the water porters will come to fill their buckets?  This isn't the way fountains are built in Rome to beautify the city.  We need to lift ourselves out of taste that is gross and shabby. Fountains should be built in public places, and viewed from all the gates.  There isn't a single public place in the vast [[faubourg Saint-Germain]]; that makes my blood boil. Paris is like [[Daniel 2|the statue of Nabuchodonosor]], partly made of gold and partly made of muck.&lt;ref&gt;Letter from Voltaire to Caylus, extract published in A. Roserot (1902), cited in ''Paris et ses fontaines de la Renaissance à nos jours'', from the Collection ''Paris et son Patrimoine'', directed by Béatrice de Andia, Délégué Général à l'Action artistique de la Ville de Paris, 1998. collection of texts on the history of Paris fountains.)Translation by D.R Siefkin.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Mian Ren''' is a form of traditional [[Chinese folk art]]. Flour figures are made of coloured rice flours, colouring, stone wax and honey. Craftsmen can make lively figures out of the coloured flour balls with a small bamboo knife. They used to carry their tools around villages and towns to sell them for a very basic living.&lt;ref&gt;[http://traditions.cultural-china.com/en/16Traditions265.html ''Chinese flour figure''] Traditions, Cultural China, Retrieved 21 September 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes flour figures are used in dishes as food crafts along with vegetable carvings.

Flour figures were considered as little delights not found in elegant imperial staterooms. They are mainly collected by children as toys.

==Origin==

The origin of the specific craft is unknown. According to archaeological discoveries figures of humans and pigs were found in the [[Xin Jiang]] province tombs. They are considered more than 1,340 years old. In a [[Southern Song]] period book called ''[[Dongjing Meng Hua Lu (Dreams of Splendor of the Eastern Capital)]]'', Mian Ren was defined as a food ornament that could be eaten as a snack.

'''Modern Allegorism''' is a school of [[fine art]] in which the artist uses contemporary elements in an [[allegory|allegorical]] style to communicate a positive and uplifting message to the viewer.

The term was first used in print in a book published in 2007 titled ''Tarnowski: Modern Allegories'' &lt;!-- Published by Masterpiece Publishing, Inc. ISBN #975-0-9790727-0-3 --&gt;about the work of artist [[Glen Tarnowski]]. Tarnowski coined the term to describe artwork that communicated to a modern world in the same way that [[Renaissance]] artists communicated values, ethics and morality to the largely illiterate population of the time.

The three subgenres of Modern Allegorism include whimsical, inspirational/spiritual, and [[paradox]]ical. These subgenres describe the mechanism through which the artist conveys the message. Whimsical modern allegories use humor in a non-critical fashion to encourage the viewer to question their own perspectives and behavior. Inspirational/spiritual modern allegories attempt to inspire the viewer to believe in their own abilities and trust their innate gifts. Paradoxical modern allegories position common elements in ways that are contrary to the viewer's expectation in order to encourage the viewer to evaluate the commonplace and see their own preconceptions in a new light.

'''Nathdwara Painting''' refers to a painting tradition and school of artists that emerged in [[Nathdwara]], a town in [[Rajsamand]] district in the Western state of [[Rajasthan]] in India. Nathdwara paintings are of different sub-styles of which ''[[Pichhwai]]'' paintings are the most popular.&lt;ref name=et02&gt;{{cite news|title=Temple of Doodh|url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2002-08-15/news/27361138_1_temple-management-kar-seva-nathdwara|accessdate=14 January 2012|newspaper=''[[The Economic Times|Economic Times]]''|date=15 August 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The word ''Pichwai'' derives from the [[Sanskrit]] words ''pich'' meaning back and ''wais'' meaning hanging. These paintings are cloth paintings hung behind the image of the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] god [[Shrinathji]].&lt;!-- &lt;ref&gt; http://artofpast.com/gallery/pichwai-of-gopies/ &lt;/ref&gt; Link is dead --&gt;{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

==Origin and area==
The Nathdwara school is a subset of the [[Mewar]] school of painting and is seen as an important school in the 17th and 18th century [[Manuscript miniature|miniature paintings]]. The sub-styles of Mewar painting include Udaigarh, Devgarh and Nathdwara as important centers of miniature production. The temple of Shrinathji is believed to have provided a boost to the art activities in the town. It is recorded that to avoid the oppression of the [[Iconoclasm|iconoclast]] [[Mughal emperor]] [[Aurangzeb]], the image of Shrinathji, a child manifestation of [[Krishna]] was installed in Nathdwara in 1670 by Goswami priests from [[Mathura]]. After this, many artists, including the famous Acharya Gopinathji, motivated by religious fervor came and created paintings of Srinathji.&lt;ref name=toi08&gt;{{cite news|title=Celebrating Nathdwara paintings|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2008-11-30/ahmedabad/27892936_1_mughal-sect-aurangzeb|accessdate=14 January 2012|newspaper=''[[Times of India]]''|date=30 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pichhwai are intricate paintings which portray Lord Krishna. They exist in the holy town of Nathdwara in the Rajasthan state of India.

Krishna is shown in different moods, body postures, and attire more commonly found on a cloth or paper. It is a very ancient form of art passed on from generation to generation and it has a very devotional theme towards Lord Krishna.

The purpose of Pichhwais, other than its artistic appeal, is to narrate tales of Krishna to the illiterate. They have become the main export of Nathdwara and are in much demand among foreign visitors in the area.

These artists mostly live in Chitron ki gali (Street of paintings) and Chitrakaron ka mohallah (colony of painters) and make a close community with constant interaction. It is no wonder that many times a Pichhwai painting is a group effort, where several skillful painters work together under the supervision of a master artist.

==Themes==
[[File:Sri nathji.jpg|thumb|103x103px|Srinathji.]]
Most works produced in this style revolve around the figure of Shrinathji as a manifestation of [[Krishna]] and refer to the incident of him holding the [[Govardhan hill]] on his last finger. Each ''pichwai'' painting is considered a ''seva'' or an offering to the deity and hence personifies Shrinathji as a prince with jewels and luxuries, surrounded by the milkmaids, [[gopi]]s. These ''seva'' themes are based on different seasons and paintings are made to depict different moods of the season.&lt;ref name="workworship"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.hindu.com/mag/2005/08/21/stories/2005082100170200.htm |title=Work is worship |last=Kapur|first=Mita|date=21 August 2005|publisher=[[The Hindu]]|accessdate=9 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also paintings that show the Lord in different costumes celebrating different festivals. Other themes like Mata Yashoda, Nandlal and Balgopal figures are also painted in this style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PGjTjmL29VIC | title=Splendour of Rajasthani Painting | first1=Jai Singh | last1=Neeraj | first2=Jayasiṃha | last2=Nīraja | publisher=Abhinav Publications | year=1991 | isbn=9788170172673}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the paintings are gem-encrusted.&lt;ref name="ht10"&gt;{{cite news |title=Weaving art with charity|url=http://www.livemint.com/2010/08/20182353/Weaving-art-with-charity.html |newspaper=''[[Hindustan Times]]''|date=20 August 2010|accessdate=2 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Maestro_oltremontano,_nicchia_di_sinistra.jpg|thumb|The left loggia of the north transept in the Upper Church at the Basilica of St Francis in Assisi]]
[[File:Maestro_oltremontano,_innesti_della_volta_del_transetto_destro_con_mascheroni_02.jpg|thumb|Mascherone]]
The '''Northern Master''' was an anonymous artist in the late 13th century who worked in the Upper Church of the [[Basilica of Saint Francis of Assisi]]. Although his precise origin is unknown, he is thought to be of French, German, or English origin. He and his assistants played a critical role in painting by merging northern Gothic and Italian influences in the frescoes. Also attributed to him are the designs for some of the stained glass windows.

== Works ==
The Northern Master worked in the Upper Church of the [[Basilica of Saint Francis of Assisi|Basilica of Saint Francis in Assisi]] at roughly the same time as [[Cimabue]] did,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.britac.ac.uk/sites/default/files/08-binski.pdf|title=How Northern was the Northern Master at Assisi?|last=Binski|first=Paul|date=29 March 2001|website=|publisher=|pages=12–15|access-date=26 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; decorating the upper part of the north [[transept]]. The style of the work is markedly [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]], perhaps French, German, or English, and for this the artist is referred to as the Northern Master (called in Italian either the ''Maestro Oltremontano, ''"master from over the mountains" or the ''Maestro Oltralpe'', "master from over the Alps").
[[File:Maestro Oltremontano, trasfigurazione (dettaglio).jpg|thumb|The Northern Master's ''Transfiguration'']]
Attributed to him are two large [[lunette]]s (containing images of the ''[[Transfiguration of Jesus|Transfiguration]] ''and ''Saint Luke kneeling next to a throne''); all the work in the left [[loggia]] (with busts of angels in [[clipeus]]es and life-sized figures of saints and prophets behind the columns); and various decorative elements (perhaps entrusted to his assistants) with geometric and floral motifs found underneath the arches of the lunettes, stained glass windows, and columns. Sometimes also attributed to him are the decorative bands of the [[Vault (architecture)|vaults]], in particular the masks near the joints on the [[pilaster]]s, as well as the remains of the two grand figures in the niches (''Isaiah ''and ''David'') flanking the stained glass windows at the head of the transept along with the two painted rosettes above them. The work in the right loggia is generally attributed one of the Roman masters.

The Northern Master's work (unfortunately much damaged) is particularly important not only for its quality of painting but even more so because it represents a bridge between the purely Gothic style from over the Alps (in France, England, and Germany) and the Italian schools (in Assisi, Florence, and Rome). In a few places his work is patently Gothic (in an epoch in which this style had only just taken root in Italian architecture); in other areas it demonstrates an assimilation of elements from Roman culture (as in the [[Acanthus (ornament)|acanthus leaves]] with their classical flavor, found underneath the arches of the windows); and yet other areas show an exclusively Roman influence tied to a collaborator and successor.

Cimabue himself also appears to have been inspired by this Gothic influence, especially in the decorative bands and motifs, and to a certain scale and fluency in design. Some art historians even hypothesize that the two artists worked together in the lower register of the apse (the ''Annunciation of Joachim and his offering'', the angels holding vases at the bases of the ''Four Evangelists ''in the vaults, and the ''Crucifixion ''in the left transept).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Style ==
[[File:Maestro_oltremontano,_loggetta_di_sinistra,_dettaglio.jpg|left|thumb|Leaf motifs under the arches of the lunettes in the right transept]]
The profile of [[spire]]s and [[pinnacle]]s drawn over the small [[trefoil]] arches of the loggia in itself indicates a clear adhesion to Gothic culture. There is a particular dialogue established in the frescoes between these painted details and the real architectonic elements, that produce the window frames made with columns and arches that create the spaces into which the frescoed prophets are inserted. The loggias have created a series of painted [[Niche (architecture)|niches]], behind a gallery of real columns, which do not always correspond: a feature previously seen only in the [[Sancta Sanctorum|Sancta Sanctorum of St. John Lateran]] (rediscovered in the middle of the 20th century) which perhaps suggests that the artist was at some point in Rome where he distinguished himself and was then enlisted by Nicholas IV to assist in the Assisi decoration.

The idea of painting that not only imiates, but that is engaged enough to actually alter its environment, was then a novelty in an area normally accessible to the public and would have far-reaching consequences in later works of art.

Another characteristic of the Northern Master can be found in his figures, which are physiologically individualized. This can be seen in the way the masks at the bases of the vaults are treated, or in the figures of saints and prophets in the left loggia. Inspired by the decorative designs found in the French [[Vitreous enamel|enamels]], which contain spiraling leaves and vines, the artist clearly owes a debt to classical culture for the presence of [[Meander (art)|meander]] and rhombus, with [[acanthus (plant)|acanthus]] leaves also present.

[[Oil painting|Oil paint]], at the time a predominantly northern medium, was also found to have been used by this artist in Assisi.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  In addition to the paintings, the design of some of the [[Stained glass|stained glass windows]], also a chiefly northern medium, are attributed to him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/47394426_Concerning_the_chronology_of_Cimabue's_oeuvre_and_the_origin_of_pictorial_depth_in_Italian_painting_of_the_later_middle_ages|title=Concerning the chronology of Cimabue's oeuvre and the origin of pictorial depth in Italian painting of the later middle ages (PDF Download Available)|last=|first=|date=|website=ResearchGate|publisher=|page=124|language=en|access-date=2017-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Critics ==
Some critics (for example [[Henry Thode]], [[Josef Strzygowski]], [[Bernard Berenson]], and [[Federico Zeri]]) believe no such artist as the Northern Master existed, attributing everything to Cimabue and his school on the basis of what Vasari indicated.

It was Aubert who first noted the decidedly gothic aspect of the work in this portion of the transept,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2006-01-01|title=Il 'pittore oltremontano' di Assisi, il Gotico a Siena e la formazione di Simone Martini|jstor=24434623|journal=Prospettiva|issue=121/124|pages=227–236}}&lt;/ref&gt; connecting it to the style seen in the stained glass windows (constructed in part by French and German artists). Luigi Coletti followed, insisting on a connection to [[Sainte-Chapelle]] in Paris based on the peculiarly harsh color scheme of this part of the frescos (golds, dark reds, ''turchini'', etc.). He wrote: "The style is rigorously linear; and this is very clear in the figurative parts, where the volumes appear resolved in many flat layers".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.it/books?id=w3XsAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Lo+stile+%C3%A8+rigorosamente+lineare;+e+ci%C3%B2+appare+con+migliore+evidenza+nelle+parti+figurate,+dove+i+volumi+risultano+risolti+in+tanti+piani+schiacciati&amp;dq=Lo+stile+%C3%A8+rigorosamente+lineare;+e+ci%C3%B2+appare+con+migliore+evidenza+nelle+parti+figurate,+dove+i+volumi+risultano+risolti+in+tanti+piani+schiacciati&amp;hl=it&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y|title=L'opera completa di Cimabue e il momento figurativo pregiottesco|last=Cimabue|date=1975-01-01|publisher=Rizzoli|language=it}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brandi in 1951 spoke of a painter "transalpino" for the ''Transfiguration'', without hypothesizing for any specific nationality.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Ultimately, the question of the artist's origin is one that has been extremely difficult to resolve, even if some studies have indicated points of contact with details in the stained glass windows that are decidedly German in taste,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; or in the other frescoes, like those in the [[Nonnberg Abbey]] in Salzburg where the figures have a similar design and the faces a similar composition.

{{Eastern Slavic name|Dmitryevna|Forsh}}
'''Olga Dmitryevna Forsh''' ({{lang-ru|О́льга Дми́триевна Форш}}, {{lang|ru-latn|Oljga Dmitrijevna Forš}}), née Komarova ({{lang-ru|Комаро́ва}}) ({{OldStyleDate|May 28|1873|May 16}}{{spaced ndash}}July 17, 1961), was a Russian/Soviet novelist, dramatist, memoirist, and scenarist.

==Early life==
Forsh was born in the fortress at [[Gunib]], in [[Dagestan Oblast|Dagestan]], the daughter of a major general in the Russian Imperial Army. Her father met her mother, Nina Shakhetdinova, an [[Azerbaijan]]ian, while he was stationed in the [[Caucasus]]. Nina died when Olga was very young. Olga's stepmother, who was also her former nurse, showed little interest in her, especially after the birth of her own daughter by Olga's father. When her father, Major General Komarov, died in 1881 Olga was placed in an orphanage for children of the nobility.&lt;ref name="Women"&gt;{{cite book |title=Dictionary of Russian Women Writers |year=1994 |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |isbn=0-313-26265-9 |pages=183–184 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lI4hPO8u3ecC&amp;pg=PA185&amp;dq=olga+forsh&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Alr1Tu3IL_LMiQKrvOG4Dg&amp;ved=0CHMQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=olga%20forsh&amp;f=false |accessdate=2011-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Oxford"&gt;{{cite book |title=An Anthology of Russian Women's Writing, 1777-1992 |last=Kelly |first=Catriona |year=1994 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-871505-6 |page=243 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fO9fAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=An+Anthology+of+Russian+Women%27s+Writing&amp;dq=An+Anthology+of+Russian+Women%27s+Writing&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=2ScPToeELoaMswaGm635Dg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAQ |accessdate=2011-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She married Boris Eduardovich Forsh, who had also been born into the family of a high-ranking military officer, in 1895. In the 1890s she studied at various art schools,&lt;ref name="Oxford"/&gt; most importantly in [[Kiev]] and St Petersburg, where she worked in the studio of [[Pavel Chistyakov]].&lt;ref name="Women"/&gt;

In 1904 Boris Forsh resigned from the military in objection to his having to serve at the executions of political prisoners. He was deprived of his salary, and he and Olga moved to a farm in the Ukraine with their two children. Olga was also pregnant at the time. She later attributed the inspiration for her early stories to this extended period of living among the peasantry. Her first works of fiction were published in 1907. She continued drawing and painting, and worked as an art teacher at the Levitskaya School in [[Tsarskoye Selo]] in 1910-11, but she turned toward writing as time went by.&lt;ref name="Women"/&gt;

==Career==
Olga was interested in the fashionable ideas of the time, including [[Tolstoyan movement|Tolstoyanism]], [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]] and [[Buddhism]],&lt;ref name="Oxford"/&gt; but was increasingly drawn to Socialism. After the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution of 1917]] Olga and her husband became active supporters of the [[Bolshevik]]s. Olga's husband died of [[typhus]] while serving with the [[Red Army]] in Kiev.&lt;ref name="Oxford"/&gt; After his death she continued to dedicate herself to cultural work.&lt;ref name="Women"/&gt;

She devoted several novels to the history of revolutionary thought and the revolutionary movement in Russia. Among them are ''Palace and Prison'' (1924–25, also made into a film script), about the revolutionary Mikhail Stepanovich Beideman, ''The Fervid Workshop'' (1926), about the Revolution of 1905–07, and ''Pioneers of Freedom'' (1950–53), which deals with the [[Decembrists]]. She also wrote the three-part [[biographical novel]] ''[[Alexander Radishchev|Radishchev]]'', which comprises the books ''Jacobin Leaven'' (1932), ''The Landlady of Kazan'' (1934–35), and ''The Pernicious Book'' (1939). Her experimental play ''The Substitute Lecturer'' was published in 1930.&lt;ref name="Soviet"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Olga+Forsh |title=The Great Soviet Encyclopedia |accessdate=2011-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fate of the creative individual under an oppressive regime is treated in the novel ''The Contemporaries'' (1926), which is about [[Nikolay Gogol]] and A. A. Ivanov. In the novels ''The Lunatic Ship'' (1931) and ''The Raven'' (originally titled ''The Symbolists'', 1933), Olga portrayed life among the St Petersburg artistic intelligentsia in the early 20th century and the first post revolutionary years and created portraits of such contemporaries as [[Maxim Gorky]], [[Alexander Blok]] and [[Fyodor Sologub]].&lt;ref name="Soviet"/&gt;

==Later life==
Olga rose to prominence in the arena of Soviet literature,&lt;ref name="Oxford"/&gt; playing important roles at the [[USSR Union of Writers|1934 Congress of Writers]], and at the 1954 Congress, where she gave the opening address.&lt;ref name="Women"/&gt; She was awarded the [[Order of the Red Banner of Labour]] (twice) and the [[Order of the Badge of Honour]].&lt;ref&gt;According to Olga Forsh article at ru.wikipedia ([[:ru:Форш, Ольга Дмитриевна]])&lt;/ref&gt;

She died in Tyarlova, a suburb of Leningrad, in 1961. She was buried in the [[Kazan]] Cemetery, on the outskirts of [[Pushkin (town)|Pushkin]].&lt;ref name="Women"/&gt;

'''Painting in the Americas before European colonization''' is the [[Precolumbian]] painting traditions of the Americas. Painting was a relatively widespread, popular and diverse means of communication and expression for both religious and utilitarian purpose throughout the regions of the [[Western Hemisphere]]. During the period before and after [[Age of Discovery|European exploration]] and settlement of the Americas; including [[North America]], [[Central America]], [[South America]] and the islands of the [[Caribbean]], the [[Bahamas]], the [[West Indies]], the [[Antilles]], the [[Lesser Antilles]] and other island groups, indigenous native cultures produced a wide variety of visual arts, including painting on textiles, hides, rock and cave surfaces, bodies especially faces, ceramics, architectural features including interior murals, wood panels, and other available surfaces. Many of the perishable surfaces, such as woven textiles, typically have not been preserved, but Precolumbian painting on ceramics, walls, and rocks have survived more frequently.

The oldest known paintings in the South America are the [[cave painting]]s of [[Caverna da Pedra Pintada]], in the [[Brazil]]ian [[Amazon rainforest]] that date back 11,200 years.&lt;ref&gt;Wilford, John Noble.

==Painting in the Americas before colonization==
{{Main|Native American art|Maya art|Pre-Columbian art|Indigenous peoples of the Americas}}
Each continent of the Americas hosted societies that were unique and individually developed cultures; that produced totems, works of religious symbolism, and decorative and expressive painted works. African influence was especially strong in the art of the Caribbean and South America. The arts of the indigenous people of the Americas had an enormous impact and influence on [[European art]] and vice versa during and after the [[Age of Exploration]]. Spain, Portugal, France, The Netherlands and England were all powerful and influential [[colonial power]]s in the Americas during and after the 15th century. By the 19th century cultural influence began to flow both ways across the Atlantic.

===[[Mesoamerica]]===
{{see also|Mesoamerican writing systems|Oasisamerica|Aridoamerica|Aztec calendar stone}}
The murals of [[Teotihuacan]] that adorn the archaeological site (and others, like the [[Wagner Murals]], found in private collections) and from hieroglyphic inscriptions made by the [[Maya civilization|Maya]] describing their encounters with Teotihuacano conquerors are the source of most of what is understood about that ancient civilization.  The painting of the murals, perhaps thousands of them, reached its zenith between 450 and 650 CE.  The painters' artistry was unrivalled in Mesoamerica and has been compared with that of [[Florence, Italy]].&lt;ref&gt;Davies, p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Great Goddess====
A series of [[mural]]s were found in the Tepantitla compound in Teotihuacan. In 1942, archaeologist [[Alfonso Caso]] identified the central figures as a Teotihuacan equivalent of ''[[Tlaloc]],'' the Mesoamerican god of rain and warfare.  During the 1970s researcher Esther Pasztory re-examined the murals and concluded that many paintings of "Tlaloc" instead showed a ''feminine'' deity, an analysis based on a number of factors including the gender of accompanying figures, the green bird in the headdress, and the spiders seen above the figure.&lt;ref&gt;Pasztory (1977, pp.83–85).&lt;/ref&gt;  Pasztory concluded that the figures represented a vegetation and fertility goddess that was a predecessor of the much later Aztec goddess [[Xochiquetzal]].

The Great Goddess has since been identified at locations other than Tepantitla – including Teotihuacan's Tetitla compound, the Palace of the Jaguars, and the Temple of Agriculture – as well as on several vessels.&lt;ref&gt;Pasztory (1977, pp.87–91).&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Temple of the Murals====
{{see also|San Bartolo (Maya site)}}
Large painted [[Maya civilization|Mayan]] [[mural]]s were found in the archaeological site [[Bonampak]], in the [[Mexico|Mexican]] [[Political divisions of Mexico|state]] of [[Chiapas]] near the border with [[Guatemala]]. What is referred to as ''The Temple of the Murals'' is a long narrow building with 3 rooms atop a low-stepped pyramid base. The interior walls preserve the finest examples of classic Maya painting. Huge paintings cover the walls of one of the structure's three rooms. The paintings show the story of a single battle and its victorious outcome.&lt;ref&gt;Coe, Michael D. (1999).

====Nazca culture====
The [[Nazca culture]] of [[Peru]] produced painted pottery and painted ceramics depicting religious and symbolic characters as well as imagery of personages within the culture.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/aoa/d/double_spout_and_bridge_vessel.aspx] On Nazca ceramics retrieved May 12, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; They produced in addition to ceramics, highly complex textiles and [[Geoglyph]]s. The period from 1-700 A.D is generally considered when this group thrived. Modern knowledge about the culture of the Nazca is built upon the study of [[Cahuachi]] the ceremonial center from (1-500 AD).

{{see also|Alaska Natives}}
In the area that is now the United States, many different and diverse [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribes of people created painting and ornamental painted objects of a large variety. The oldest known example is the [[Cooper Bison Kill Site|Cooper Bison skull]], which was painted with a red zigzag circa 10,200 BCE in present-day [[Oklahoma]].&lt;ref&gt;Bement, Leland C. [https://books.google.com/books?id=hfTR4jiAe64C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=Leland%20Bement&amp;lr=&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false ''Bison hunting at Cooper site: where lightning bolts drew thundering herds.''] Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, 1999. {{ISBN|978-0-8061-3053-8}}. Pages 37, 176&lt;/ref&gt; [[Body painting]], [[rock art]], [[hide painting]] flourished in ancient North America, as well as painting on ceramics, textiles, and other surfaces.

[[Ancient Pueblo Peoples]] ([[Anasazi]]) of the American Southwest have a longstanding tradition of painting interior murals and ceramics, as did the [[Mogollon culture]], ancestors of [[Zuni people|Zuni]] and [[Hopi]] tribes, who lived in an area near the [[Gila Wilderness]]. The [[Fremont culture]] of [[Utah]] are known for their abundant rock paintings throughout [[Utah]], particularly those at [[Range Creek|Range Creek Canyon]].&lt;ref&gt;Turner, Ellen Sue. [http://www.staa.org/fremont/FREMONT.html "The Fremont People of Range Creek Canyon, Utah."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100425164346/http://www.staa.org/fremont/FREMONT.html |date=2010-04-25 }} ''Southern Texas Archeological Association.'' 2004 (retrieved 9 May 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Patayan]] typically painted ceramics with a red slip. The [[Hohokam]], ancestors of the [[Akimel O'odham]] and [[Tohono O'odham]], are known for their red-on-buff painted ceramics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mnsu.edu/emuseum/archaeology/artifacts/gilapottery.html "Gila Pottery."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100530105248/http://www.mnsu.edu/emuseum/archaeology/artifacts/gilapottery.html |date=2010-05-30 }} ''E-Museum of the Minnesota State University, Mankato.'' (retrieved 9 May 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Casa Grande Ruins National Monument]] is the best known monument of [[Hohokam]] culture.

[[Classification of indigenous peoples of the Americas#California|Native Americans in California]] created many pieces and environments of [[rock art]]. The most elaborate and artistic painted [[pictograph]]s being the [[Rock art of the Chumash people]], and [[petroglyph]]s those of the [[Coso people]] in the [[Coso Rock Art District]].&lt;ref&gt;Penney, 129&lt;/ref&gt;

Ancient [[Northwest Coast art]] features formline painting on woven items and wood; however, few of these items survived the centuries the [[temperate rainforest]] climate.

==Life and work==
Lamarque was educated at [[Marlborough College]] and received a [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] degree in [[English literature|English]] and [[Philosophy]] from the [[University of East Anglia]]. He then completed a [[BPhil]] in Philosophy at [[The Queen's College, Oxford]] in 1972, where he worked under the supervision of [[L. Jonathan Cohen]].

From 1972 to 1995 Lamarque taught in the Philosophy Department at the [[University of Stirling]], and from 1995 to 2000 he held the [[Ferens Chair in Philosophy]] at the [[University of Hull]]. In 2000, he moved to the University of York to take up his current position. He has held visiting positions in several universities around the world, including [[Cornell University]] (USA) and the [[Australian National University]] (Australia).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Lamarque has published extensively on various philosophical topics, mostly in the area of analytic [[philosophy of art]]. He put forward the first systematic articulation of an approach to the [[paradox of fiction]] usually referred to as 'thought theory'.&lt;ref&gt;See Peter Lamarque (1981), "How Can We Fear and Pity Fictions?", ''British Journal of Aesthetics'' '''21''', pp. 291-304.&lt;/ref&gt; He was editor of the ''[[British Journal of Aesthetics]]'' from 1995 to 2008.

'''Phyllida Lloyd''', {{post-nominals|country=GBR|size=100%|commas=on|CBE}} (born 17 June 1957) is an English film director, best known for her work in theatre and as the director of  ''[[Mamma Mia! (film)|Mamma Mia!]]'' and ''[[The Iron Lady (film)|The Iron Lady]]''.

==Life and career==
Lloyd grew up in [[Nempnett Thrubwell]], [[Somerset]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Saner|first1=Emine|title=Phyllida Lloyd: a director who's determined to put women centre stage|url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/nov/25/phyllida-lloyd-director-all-female-shakespeare-trilogy-mama-mia-iron-lady|accessdate=27 November 2016|work=Guardian|date=25 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After graduating from [[Birmingham University]] in 1979 (BA, English), she spent five years working in BBC Television Drama. In 1985 she was awarded an [[Arts Council of Great Britain]] bursary to be Trainee Director at the [[New Wolsey Theatre|Wolsey Theatre, Ipswich]]. The following year she was appointed Associate Director at the Everyman Theatre, Cheltenham, then in 1989 Associate Director of the [[Bristol Old Vic]], where her production of ''[[The Comedy of Errors]]'' was a success.&lt;ref&gt;David Benedict [https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/arts-together-wherever-we-go-1269939.html "Arts: Together wherever we go"], ''The Independent'', 29 April 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

She moved on to the [[Royal Exchange Theatre]], Manchester where she directed ''[[The Winter's Tale]]'', ''[[The School for Scandal]]'', ''[[Medea]]'', and an acclaimed production of ''[[Death and the King's Horseman]]'' by [[Wole Soyinka]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.royalexchange.co.uk/history/1990/DEATH%20AND%20THE%20KINGS%20HORSEMAN.htm "Death and the Kings Horseman"], Royal Exchange Theatre website&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991 she made her debut at the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]] with a well-received production of a little-known play by [[Thomas Shadwell]], ''The Virtuoso''. Although she followed this in 1992 with a successful production of the rarely seen ''Artists and Admirers'' by [[Alexander Ostrovsky]], she has, as of 2007, never returned to the RSC.

Also in 1992 came her first commercial success: her [[Royal Court Theatre]] production of [[John Guare]]'s ''Six Degrees of Separation'' transferred to the West End. In 1994 she made her debut at [[Royal National Theatre]] with a production of ''[[Pericles, Prince of Tyre|Pericles]]'' which divided the critics.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Pericles at the Royal National Theatre'' by Melissa Gibson, in ''Pericles: Critical Essays'' (Shakespeare Criticism, Volume 23)&lt;/ref&gt; There was general praise, however, for her productions of ''[[Hysteria (play)|''Hysteria'']]'' by [[Terry Johnson (dramatist)|Terry Johnson]] at the [[Royal Court Theatre|Royal Court]] and [[Bertolt Brecht]]/[[Kurt Weill]]'s ''[[The Threepenny Opera]]'' at the Donmar Warehouse.

By this time, Lloyd's work had come to the attention of Nicholas Paine, then running [[Opera North]]. For her debut as an opera director he steered her to what was, at least in the UK, an obscurity – ''L'Etoile'' by [[Chabrier]]. The production was a great success, setting Lloyd on a significant and award-winning career as an opera director. Productions since then include ''[[La Boheme]]'', ''[[Gloriana]]'', [[Cherubini]]'s ''[[Medea]]'', [[Albert Herring]] and [[Peter Grimes]] for Opera North; ''[[Dialogues of the Carmelites]]'' for [[English National Opera]]/[[Welsh National Opera]]; [[Verdi]]'s ''[[Macbeth (opera)|Macbeth]]'' (for the [[Bastille Opera]] and the [[Royal Opera House]] [[Covent Garden]]); the premiere of [[Poul Ruders]]' opera ''[[The Handmaid's Tale (opera)|The Handmaid's Tale]]'' (from the novel by [[Margaret Atwood]]); and a controversial [[Ring of the Nibelung|Ring cycle]] for [[English National Opera|ENO]]. She received an International [[Emmy]], a [[FIPA d'Or]] and the [[Royal Philharmonic Society]] Award.

In spite of the mixed reception accorded to her first production at the National Theatre, Lloyd nonetheless returned to direct productions of ''[[The Way of the World]]'', ''[[Pericles, Prince of Tyre|Pericles]]'', ''[[What the Butler Saw (play)|What the Butler Saw]]'', ''[[The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie (novel)|The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie]]'' and ''[[The Duchess of Malfi]]'', which were well received. She directed an award-winning production of ''[[Boston Marriage (play)|Boston Marriage]]'' at London's [[Donmar Warehouse]] in 2001. Other recent work includes [[Friedrich Schiller]]'s ''[[Mary Stuart (play)|Mary Stuart]]'' newly adapted by poet [[Peter Oswald]], which ran at the [[Donmar Warehouse]], London, and was transferred to the [[Apollo Theatre]], London, and then to the [[broadway theatre|Broadway]] in spring 2009.

In 1999 Lloyd was offered the chance to direct the [[ABBA]] musical ''[[Mamma Mia!]]'', which became a hit, not only in the West End and on Broadway, but worldwide. She directed the [[Mamma Mia! (film)|2008 cinematic adaptation]], which marked her [[feature film|feature]] debut. By the end of 2008, the film had been certified as the biggest grossing film at the UK box office ever.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/celebritynews/3283481/Mamma-Mia-becomes-highest-grossing-British-film.html| title=Mamma Mia becomes highest grossing British film| author = Irvine, Chris| date = 30 October 2008| accessdate = 1 January 2009| publisher=The Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also certified as the UK's biggest-selling DVD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7805847.stm|title=Mamma Mia! tops all-time DVD list|date=1 January 2009|accessdate=1 January 2009|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was nominated as Best Director of a Play in the 2009 [[63rd Tony Awards|Tony Awards]] for her production of ''[[Mary Stuart (play)|Mary Stuart]]''.

Lloyd directed ''[[The Iron Lady (film)|The Iron Lady]]'', a biopic of former British Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]], with [[Meryl Streep]] as Thatcher. The film entered production in January 2011 and was released in December of that year.&lt;ref&gt;Catherine Shoard [https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/feb/08/meryl-streep-margaret-thatcher-iron-lady "Meryl Streep's Margaret Thatcher revealed in first still from The Iron Lady"], ''The Guardian'', 8 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 she directed ''Henry IV'' in the West End.

'''''Poétique du cerveau''''' (English: ''Poetics of the Brain'') is a 66-minute 2015 French-German-Israeli French-, Hebrew-, and Italian-language independent underground experimental documentary art film directed by Nurith Aviv.

==Synopsis==
Childhood photos from Nurith Aviv’s family album evoke memories and reflections which lead her to encounters with researches in neuroscience. The film, released on DVD by Epicentre Films,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media|url=http://www.epicentrefilms.com/dvd-Poetique-du-cerveau-Nurith|people=Aviv, Nurith|title=Poétique du cerveau|location=Paris|publisher=Epicentre Films|language=French|accessdate=26 April 2018|format=DVD|oclc=949902028|date=26 April 2016|trans-title=Poetics of the Brain}}&lt;/ref&gt; weaves associative links between Aviv’s personal biographical stories and interviews she conducts with neuroscientists about their work. These scientists, including Prof. Dr. Laurent Cohen, Prof. Dr. Yadin Dudai, and Prof. Dr. Vittorio Gallese, discuss topics partly related to Aviv’s previous films: memory, bilingualism, reading, mirror-neurons, smell, and traces of experience.

'''Rachel Keller''' is a fictional [[Character (arts)|character]] in [[The Ring (film series)|''The Ring'' film series]]. The character, created by writer-producer [[Ehren Kruger]] and portrayed by [[Naomi Watts]], serves as the [[protagonist]] of ''[[The Ring (2002 film)|The Ring]]'' and ''[[The Ring Two]]'', sharing similarities with [[Reiko Asakawa]] from the [[Ring Trilogy|original Japanese films]].

Introduced in the 2002 film, Rachel is an investigative journalist who must figure out a way to escape death after watching a cursed video tape that she discovered while investigating the death of her niece. In ''[[The Ring Two]]'', Rachel must delve into the history of [[Sadako Yamamura#Samara Morgan|Samara Morgan]] after her son gets sick with a mysterious ailment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.comingsoon.net/movies/features/806745-the-ring-story-so-far#!|title=Franchise Recap: The Ring Story So Far…|last=|first=|date=|website=Coming Soon|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=February 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appearances==
In ''[[The Ring (2002 film)|The Ring]]'', Rachel Keller, an investigative journalist, is asked by her sister Ruth to investigate the mysterious circumstances behind her niece Katie's death. She informs Rachel that she found her daughter's distorted corpse in the closet and that her official cause of death was a heart attack, despite Katie being a healthy teenager. Katie's remaining friends make Rachel aware of the legend of the cursed videotape and that Becca, Katie's friend, was institutionalized after witnessing her being killed. She also discovers that Katie's boyfriend and her two other friends all died in bizarre accidents on the same night at 10 PM. Rachel travels to Shelter Mountain Inn and stays at Cabin 12, the same cabin where Katie and her friends watched the cursed videotape. Rachel finds the mysterious tape and watches it, after which the phone rings. Rachel hears a childish voice utter "seven days". Rachel seeks help from her ex-boyfriend Noah Clay, a video analyst. Later, Rachel discovers that Aidan watched the tape just as Noah calls her and tells her that he believes her. Rachel researches the lighthouse from the tape and discovers that it was located in Moesko Island, the home of an ill-fated horse breeder named Anna Morgan, who appeared on the cursed videotape. After investigating, Rachel discovers Anna had an adopted daughter named Samara, who possessed nensha, allowing her to burn disturbing images into the minds of people, animals and objects. Rachel meets Anna’s surviving husband Richard, but he makes her leave when she begins to ask questions about Samara. She then speaks to the island’s physician, Dr. Grasnik, who explains that Anna experienced horrible visions and dreams after Samara began burning gruesome images into her mind. Rachel watches the missing medical footage, which was revealed to be Samara explaining her powers to her psychiatrist during a psychiatric session. As the footage ends, Richard abruptly strikes her in the head and subsequently decides to end the torment Samara inflicted upon him by electrocuting himself in the bathtub. Noah arrives and they discover an image of the same tree found in both Shelter Mountain Inn and the cursed videotape beneath the wallpaper in the attic of a horse barn, where Samara was kept to prevent her from inflicting harm onto others. Returning to Shelter Mountain Inn, they discover a well beneath the floorboards of Cabin 12. Rachel accidentally falls into the well, where she receives a vision revealing that Anna was the one who killed Samara via suffocating her with a plastic bag and dumping her body into the well, where she survived for seven days. Finding her skeletal remains, Rachel  discovers that the time she was supposed to be killed by the curse has passed, she and Noah return home, believing the curse was finally broken. However, Aidan makes her realize the curse was never ending. Noah is killed and Rachel discovers that she was to late. She realizes that she had been spared after making a copy and passing the copy to Noah. Rachel decides to save Aidan by making a copy of the initial copy she sent to Noah so that he can avoid death by showing someone else the tape.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-ring-2002|title=The Ring Movie Review &amp; Film Summary (2002)|last=Ebert|first=Roger|date=October 18, 2002|website=Roger Ebert|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=February 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Ring Two]]'', takes place one year after the first film. Rachel and Aidan have moved to Astoria from Seattle. Rachel works at The Daily Astorian for editor Max Rourke. Rachel learns of a local teen's death and begins investigating; from the horrified expression on the boy's face, she deduces that Samara is involved. Sure enough, Samara appears, declaring that she has been looking for her. Rachel obtains the videotape and burns it. Aidan encounters Samara in a nightmare and he starts developing hypothermia and bruises on his arms. At a county fair, Aidan takes photographs of his reflection, where Samara appears. Rachel realizes Aidan may be possessed by Samara. Max allows Rachel and Aidan to stay with him and while attempting to give Aidan a bath, Samara causes the water to recede from the bath, replacing Aidan, grabbing Rachel and she tries to drown Samara. Max enters, seeing her drowning Aidan instead, and forces her to take her son to the hospital.  Samara takes control of Aidan’s body and telepathically forces Dr. Temple to commit suicide. Rachel arrives, discovering an affectionate Aidan waiting for her, but acting odd.  Rachel falls asleep, dreaming of Aidan, who tells her that she will have to exorcise Samara. Upon awakening, Rachel drugs Samara with sleeping pills and places her in the bath to temporarily drown Aidan in order to exorcise her. Samara is removed, but appears in the television. Rachel allows herself to be dragged into Samara’s monochromatic world. Finding herself in the bottom of the well Samara died in, Rachel discovers the lid is partially open. Rachel escapes the well, sealing Samara inside. Wandering through the woods, she comes to the cliff where Samara’s adoptive mother Anna committed suicide. Hearing Aidan’s voice, Rachel throws herself off the cliff into the sea, awakening back in the real world, and reunites with Aidan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-ring-two-2005|title=The Ring Two Movie Review &amp; Film Summary (2005)|last=Ebert|first=Roger|date=March 17, 2005|website=Roger Ebert|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=February 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
===Casting and characterization===
[[File:Naomi Watts Cannes 2015 2.jpg|thumbnail|right|[[Naomi Watts]] portrays Rachel in both ''[[The Ring (2002 film)|The Ring]]'' and ''[[The Ring Two]]''.]]
In an interview, Watts revealed that she was originally hesitant to accept the role because she feared being [[typecasting (acting)|typecast]] and discussed her character saying, "it's such a great role, especially the protagonist being female when that kind of part is normally reserved for the guys. She gets to go through such an incredible journey, not just with the struggle and chaos that's happening around her, but her own personal journey." and stated "I like her complexities and the fact that she thinks everything's OK because she's not fighting with her son. She then discovers that throughout the journey that she needs to be a better mum, has a moment to reflect and think: OK I've learned something through this, which I liked."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.filmmonthly.com/Profiles/Articles/NWattsTheRing/NWattsTheRing.html|title=Naomi Grabs Hold of Hollywood's Brass Ring|last=Fischer|first=Paul|date=October 4, 2002|website=FilmMonthly|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=February 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another interview, Watts discussed her character saying that "It was the character that drew me to this project," and elaborated further by saying "What I think sets it apart, is that the character has her own personal journey to go through. She starts out as a flawed person and not a very good mother, and after all the chaos, she learns to recognize what her child needs."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2002/10/15/an-interview-with-naomi-watts|title=An Interview with Naomi Watts|last=B.|first=Scott|date=October 15, 2002|website=IGN|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=February 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the success of the [[The Ring (2002 film)|2002 film]], [[Naomi Watts]] revealed that she was contractually obligated to star in ''[[The Ring Two]]'', stating that she "didn't have the power of choice"  but said that she did not have any second thoughts about reprising her role as Rachel stating that her character "had a lot more substance and it was about confronting the situation, the psychological aspects to it, and moral dilemmas, which I think have come up again in the sequel. They took a long time with the script, DreamWorks are very clever people, they know how to make it right and they persisted. We have a great director, who directed the original one, and we have a great cast. I think there is always that fear of doing any sequel but we took our time in trying to make it the best we could, while also give a nod to the audience."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.femail.com.au/naomi-watts-the-ring-2-king-kong-pf.htm|title=Naomi Watts Interview at the Sundance Film Festival.|last=|first=|date=|website=Femail Magazine|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=February 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with [[BBC]], [[Gore Verbinski]] discussed Watts performance saying, "Naomi's great. She's completely dedicated to her performance and not to her image. That process allows her to become Rachel in this movie and go to some darker areas that I think a lot of actors wouldn't feel comfortable doing."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/films/2003/01/28/gore_verbinski_the_ring_interview.shtml|title=BBC - Films - interview - Gore Verbinski|last=Lee|first=Alana|date=January 28, 2003|website=BBC|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=February 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; While discussing Rachel's character arc in ''[[The Ring Two]]'', Watts stated, "Well, emotionally she's obviously in a very different place. And, you know, she's living with this enormous guilt and, there's no one she can talk to. What have I done? Did I do the right thing? She needs so much to, share a connection with somebody else. But she can't, she's too ashamed and so, it's just her and her son. So, the best thing she thinks she can do is move to another environment and create almost  a whole new identity."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://madeinatlantis.com/interviews/naomi_watts.htm|title=Naomi Watts Generic Interview - Ring 2|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=February 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
In ''Misfit Sisters: Screen Horror as Female Rites of Passage'',  S. Short discusses the distinctiveness of the character noting, "the woman responsible for investigating the murder mystery at the heart of ''The Ring'' is not led by visions or intuition, but by her instincts as a journalist working for the Seattle Correspondent."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Misfit Sisters: Screen Horror as Female Rites of Passage|last=Short|first=S.|publisher=Springer|year=2006|isbn=0230287379|location=|pages=141|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Heroes of Film, Comics and American Culture: Essays on Real and Fictional Defenders of Home'', Lisa M. DeTora states:
:"Rachel's journalistic demeanor gives way to a more desperate and motherly heroism as she tries to save her loved ones while discovering exactly why the Morgans killed Samara. Thus, Rachel is called on to investigate the death of a family member, to pay more attention to her son and his father, and to unearth the horrible tragedy of a murdered child. These missions have the painful effect of extracting heroic compassion from her. To justify this "extraction," Rachel is originally presented as a "bad mother" and an "over-bearing employee." Her first scene clearly depicts this "inappropriate" attunement to motherhood."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Heroes of Film, Comics and American Culture: Essays on Real and Fictional Defenders of Home|last=DeTora|first=Lisa|publisher=McFarland|year=2009|isbn=0786451432|location=|pages=255|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Leigh Kolb from [[IndieWire]] notes that the "ambiguous ending suggests that Rachel may indeed save her son, but will have to harm another to do so. This idea of motherly self-sacrifice portrays the one way that Rachel–single, working mother–can redeem herself."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.indiewire.com/2013/10/the-horror-of-little-girls-and-social-anxiety-about-women-207999/|title=The Horror of Little Girls and Social Anxiety About Women|last=Kolb|first=Leigh|date=|website=IndieWire|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sarah Crocker ranked Rachel 13th on her list of ''13 Horror Movie Heroines That Kick Butt''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://culturess.com/2016/10/31/13-horror-movie-heroines-kick-butt/2/|title=13 Horror Movie Heroines That Kick Butt|last=Crocker|first=Sarah|date=|website=Culturess|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paul Clinton of [[CNN.com]] praised Watts' performance, stating that she "is excellent in this leading role, which proves that her stellar performance in ''Mulholland Drive'' was not a fluke. She strikes a perfect balance between scepticism and the slow realisation of the truth in regard to the deadly power of the videotape."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2002/SHOWBIZ/Movies/10/18/review.the.ring/index.html|title=Review: 'The Ring' gets under your skin|last=Clinton|first=Paul|date=18 October 2002|newspaper=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|publisher=CNN|work=|via=|accessdate=February 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a post for [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]], Stacie Ponder states, "One of the things I like about Rachel Keller (Naomi Watts) in Gore Verbinski’s The Ring is that she wasn’t the best mom in the world. She didn’t neglect her weirdo kid, Aidan (David Dorfman), but she was concerned first and foremost with her own life and her own career."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.amc.com/talk/2008/05/in-praise-of-ho|title=In Praise of Horror Movie Moms|last=Ponder|first=Stacie|date=|website=amc.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=February 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Royal Court Theatre''', at different times known as the '''Court Theatre''', the '''New Chelsea Theatre''', and the '''Belgravia Theatre''', is a [[West End Theatre#London's non-commercial theatres|non-commercial West End theatre]] on [[Sloane Square]], in the [[Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea]], London, England. In 1956 it was acquired by and remains the home of the [[English Stage Company]] and is notable for its contributions to contemporary theatre.

==History==
===The first theatre===
The first theatre on Lower George Street, off Sloane Square, was the converted Nonconformist '''Ranelagh Chapel''', opened as a theatre in 1870 under the name '''The New Chelsea Theatre'''. [[Marie Litton]] became its manager in 1871, hiring [[Walter Emden]] to remodel the interior, and it was renamed the '''Court Theatre'''.&lt;ref&gt;During mid-1870, it was briefly called the "Belgravia" Theatre, but all of W. S. Gilbert's pieces presented at the theatre, beginning in 1871, were publicised as playing at the "Court Theatre".&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Happy Land - Illustrated London News, March 22, 1873.PNG|thumb|left|300px|Scene from ''The Happy Land'', showing the scandalous impersonation of  [[William Ewart Gladstone|Gladstone]], [[Robert Lowe, 1st Viscount Sherbrooke|Lowe]], and [[Acton Smee Ayrton|Ayrton]]]]
Several of [[W. S. Gilbert]]'s early plays were staged here, including ''[[Randall's Thumb]]'', ''[[Creatures of Impulse]]'' (with music by [[Alberto Randegger]]), ''Great Expectations'' (adapted from the [[Dickens]] novel), and ''On Guard'' (all in 1871); ''[[The Happy Land]]'' (1873, with [[Gilbert Abbott à Beckett]]; Gilbert's most controversial play); ''The Wedding March'', translated from ''Un Chapeau de Paille d'Italie'' by [[Eugène Marin Labiche]] (1873); ''The Blue-Legged Lady'', translated from ''La Dame aux Jambes d'Azur'' by Labiche and Marc-Michel (1874); and ''[[Broken Hearts]]'' (1875).  By 1878, management of the theatre was shared by [[John Hare (actor)|John Hare]] and [[W. H. Kendal]].&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, p. 168&lt;/ref&gt;

Further alterations were made in 1882 by Alexander Peebles, after which its capacity was 728 (including stalls and boxes, dress circle and balcony, amphitheatre, and gallery).&lt;ref name=socialhistory&gt;[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=28709#s9 ''Social history: Social and cultural activities, A History of the County of Middlesex'']: Volume 12: Chelsea (2004), pp. 166–76. Date accessed: 22 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  After that, [[Arthur Cecil]] (who had joined the theatre's company in 1881) was co-manager of the theatre with John Clayton.&lt;ref name=dnb&gt;Knight, Joseph, rev. Nilanjana Banerji.  [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/4974 "Cecil, Arthur (1843–1896)",] ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004, accessed 7 October 2008, {{doi|10.1093/ref:odnb/4974}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Among other works, they produced a series of [[Arthur Wing Pinero]]'s farces, including ''The Rector'', ''The Magistrate'' (1885), ''The Schoolmistress'' (1886), and ''Dandy Dick'' (1887), among others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.victorianweb.org/mt/theaters/pva234.html Profile of the theatre and other Victorian theatres]&lt;/ref&gt;  The theatre closed on 22 July 1887 and was demolished.&lt;ref&gt;Howard, ''London Theatres'', p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The current theatre: 1888–1952===
The present building was built on the east side of Sloane Square, replacing the earlier building, and opened on 24 September 1888 as the '''New Court Theatre'''. Designed by Walter Emden and [[Bertie Crewe]], it is constructed of fine red brick, moulded brick, and a stone facade in free Italianate style. Originally the theatre had a capacity of 841 in the stalls, dress circle, amphitheatre, and a gallery.

Cecil and Clayton yielded management of the theatre to [[Mrs. John Wood]] and Arthur Chudleigh in 1887, although Cecil continued acting in their company (and others) until 1895.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; The first production in the new building was a play by [[Sydney Grundy]] titled ''Mamma'', starring [[Mrs. John Wood]] and John Hare, with [[Arthur Cecil]] and [[Eric Lewis (actor)|Eric Lewis]].&lt;ref&gt;"New Court Theatre", ''The Times'', 25 September 1888, p.9&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the century, the theatre was again called the "Royal Court Theatre".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/RoyalCourtTheatreLondon.htm#present "The Royal Court Theatre, Sloane Square, London: The New Court Theatre"], ArthurLloyd.co.uk, accessed 19 December 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Harley Granville-Barker]] managed the theatre for the first few years of the 20th century, and [[George Bernard Shaw]]'s plays were produced at the New Court for a period. It ceased to be used as a theatre in 1932, but was used as a [[movie theater|cinema]] from 1935 to 1940, until [[World War II]] bomb damage closed it.&lt;ref name=socialhistory/&gt;

===The English Stage Company===
The interior was reconstructed by Robert Cromie, and the number of seats was reduced to under 500. The theatre re-opened in 1952.&lt;ref&gt;Mackintosh and Sell, ''Curtains!!!'', p. 155. See Plate 15.&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Devine]] was appointed artistic director at the suggestion of [[Oscar Lewenstein]], one of the  founders of the English Stage Company. [[Greville Poke]], another co-founder was appointed Honorary Secretary of the ESC in October 1954.&lt;ref name="The Royal Court Theatre and the Modern Stage"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Roberts|first1=Philip|title=The Royal Court Theatre and the Modern Stage|date=1999|publisher=Cambridge University Library|isbn=0521479622|pages=20–21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ESC opened at the Royal Court in 1956 as a subsidised theatre producing new British and foreign plays, together with some classical revivals.&lt;ref&gt;[https://royalcourttheatre.com/about/history Royal Court Theatre: History]&lt;/ref&gt; Devine aimed to create a writers' theatre, seeking to discover new writers and produce serious contemporary works. Devine produced the new company's third production  in 1956, [[John Osborne]]'s ''[[Look Back in Anger]]'', a play by one of the [[angry young men]]. The director was [[Tony Richardson]]. Osborne followed ''Look Back In Anger'' with ''[[The Entertainer (play)|The Entertainer]]'', with [[Laurence Olivier]] in the lead as Archie Rice, a play the actor effectively commissioned from the playwright. Significantly, although it was quickly reversed, the artistic board of the ESC initially rejected the play. Two members of the board were in agreement in opposing ''The Entertainer''. The Conservative Christian verse dramatist [[Ronald Duncan]], the third co-founder of the ESC, disliked the work of Osborne according to Osborne biographer [[John Heilpern]],&lt;ref name="Heilpern216"&gt;John Heilpern [https://books.google.com/books?id=e7hBfYDEupYC&amp;pg=PA216 ''John Osborne: A Patriot for Us''], London: Vintage, 2007 [2006], p.216; [https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2007/mar/06/comedy1 "'It's me, isn't it?'"], ''The Guardian'', 6 March 2007 (extract)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Despite Heilpern's claim, Duncan seems to have recognised the qualities of Look Back in Anger'', see Yael Zarhy-Levo [https://books.google.com/books?id=7_xMBGEEi-kC&amp;pg=PA31 ''The Making of Theatrical Reputations: Studies from the Modern London Theatre''], Iowa City: University of Iowa Press, 2008, p.31&lt;/ref&gt; while Lewenstein, a former [[Communist Party of Great Britain|Communist]],&lt;ref name="ODNB"&gt;Robert Murphy [http://www.oxforddnb.com/templates/article.jsp?articleid=65717&amp;back= "Lewenstein, (Silvion) Oscar (1917–1997)"], ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''&lt;/ref&gt; did not want one of the theatre's new plays to be overwhelmed by its star and did not think much of the play.&lt;ref name="Heilpern216"/&gt;

In the mid-1960s, the ESC became involved in issues of [[Censorship in the United Kingdom|censorship]]. Their premiere productions of Osborne's ''[[A Patriot for Me]]'' and ''[[Saved (play)|Saved]]'' by [[Edward Bond]] (both 1965) necessitated the theatre turning itself into a 'private members club' to circumvent the [[Lord Chamberlain]], formally responsible for the licensing of plays until the [[Theatres Act 1968]]. The ''[[succès de scandale]]'' of the two plays helped to bring about the abolition of [[Lord Chamberlain's Office#Theatre censorship|theatre censorship]] in the UK.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} During the period of Devine's directorship, besides Osborne and Bond, the Royal Court premiered works by [[Arnold Wesker]], [[John Arden]], [[Ann Jellicoe]] and [[N.F. Simpson]]. Subsequent Artistic Directors of the Royal Court premiered work by [[Christopher Hampton]], [[Athol Fugard]], [[Howard Brenton]], [[Caryl Churchill]], [[Hanif Kureishi]], [[Sarah Daniels]], [[Errol John]], [[Timberlake Wertenbaker]], [[Martin Crimp]], [[Sarah Kane]], [[Sylvia Wynter]], [[Mark Ravenhill]], [[Martin McDonagh]], [[Simon Stephens]], [[Leo Butler]], [[Polly Stenham]] and [[Nick Payne]]. Early seasons included new international plays by [[Bertolt Brecht]], [[Eugène Ionesco]], [[Samuel Beckett]], [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], and [[Marguerite Duras]]. In addition to the 400-seat [[proscenium arch]] Theatre Downstairs, the much smaller studio Theatre Upstairs was opened in 1969, at the time a 63-seat facility.&lt;ref name=socialhistory/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.behindthearras.com/Reviewspr/reviewsPRJanFeb2010/RockyHorrorG02-10.html 63 seat Theatre Upstairs]&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Rocky Horror Show]]'' premiered there in 1973. The theatre was [[listed building|Grade II listed]] in June 1972.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?pid=2&amp;id=423994 English Heritage listing details] accessed 28 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the main auditorium and the façade were attractive, the remainder of the building provided poor facilities for both audience and performers, and the stalls and understage often flooded throughout the 20th century. By the early 1990s, the theatre had deteriorated dangerously and was threatened with closure in 1995. The Royal Court received a grant of £16.2 million from the [[National Lottery (United Kingdom)|National Lottery]] and the [[Arts Council England|Arts Council]] for redevelopment, and beginning in 1996, under the artistic directorship of [[Stephen Daldry]], it was completely rebuilt, except for the façade and the intimate auditorium. The architects for this were [[Haworth Tompkins]]. The theatre reopened in February 2000, with the 380-seat [[Jerwood Foundation|Jerwood]] Theatre Downstairs, and the 85-seat studio theatre, now the Jerwood Theatre Upstairs. Since 1994, a new generation of playwrights debuting at the theatre has included [[Joe Penhall]], [[Sarah Kane]], [[Mark Ravenhill]], [[Roy Williams (playwright)|Roy Williams]] amongst others.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}  Since the 1990s, the Royal Court has placed an emphasis on the development and production of international plays. By 1993, the British Council had begun its support of the International Residency programme (which started in 1989 as the Royal Court International Summer School), and more recently the [[Genesis Foundation (arts charity)|Genesis Foundation]] has also supported the production of international plays. The theatre received a 1999 International Theatre Institute award.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.royalcourttheatre.com/international.asp International Department], Royal Court Theatre&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2008 The English Stage Company presented ''The Ugly One'' by [[Marius von Mayenburg]] at the "Contact International Theatre Festival" in [[Poland]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://teatr.torun.pl/_portal/12084172374806fbd51b077/Kontakt_2008.html Contact International Theatre Festival 2008] accessed 24 May 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Artistic Directors have included [[Ian Rickson]] (1998–2006), [[Max Stafford-Clark]], [[Stuart Burge]], [[Robert Kidd]], [[Nicholas Wright (playwright)|Nicholas Wright]], [[Lindsay Anderson]], [[Anthony Page]], and [[William Gaskill]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.royalcourttheatre.com/about-us/artistic-directors/ Artistic Directors]" since 1956, Royal Court Theatre website&lt;/ref&gt; From 2007 to 2012, the theatre's Artistic Director was [[Dominic Cooke]] and the deputy artistic director was [[Jeremy Herrin]]. [[Vicky Featherstone]], the first female artistic director, previously founding head of the [[National Theatre of Scotland]], replaced Cooke as Artistic Director in April 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-18041153|title=Royal Court names Vicky Featherstone as Cooke successor|date=11 May 2012|work=[[BBC Online]]|accessdate=12 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Dickson [https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/may/11/royal-court-vicky-featherstone-artistic-director "Royal Court hires Vicky Featherstone as first female artistic director"], ''The Guardian'', 11 May 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controversy over ''Seven Jewish Children''===
[[Caryl Churchill]]'s play ''[[Seven Jewish Children]]'' opened at the theatre in February 2009.  Many Jewish leaders and journalists have criticised ''Seven Jewish Children'' as [[antisemitic]],&lt;ref name=Symons&gt;Symons, Leon.

[http://www.thejc.com/articles/review-seven-jewish-children "Seven Jewish Children",] ''The Jewish Chronicle'', 12 February 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Further, Associate Director [[Ramin Gray]] has been accused of hypocrisy, as he is reported to have stated that he would be reluctant to stage a play critical of [[Islam]].&lt;ref&gt;Whittle, Peter. [http://www.newcultureforum.org.uk/home/?q=node/136 "Islam: The Silence of the Arts; The arts are increasingly censoring themselves when it comes to Islam,"] ''New Culture Forum'', 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Tele&gt;Beckford, Martin.

[[Michael Billington (critic)|Michael Billington]] in ''[[The Guardian]]'' described the play as "a heartfelt lamentation for the future generations".&lt;ref&gt;Michael Billington [https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2009/feb/11/seven-jewish-children "Theatre: ''Seven Jewish Children''"], ''The Guardian'', 11 February 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The paper contended that the play, though controversial, is not antisemitic,&lt;ref&gt;Charlotte Higgins [https://www.theguardian.com/culture/charlottehigginsblog/2009/feb/18/israelandthepalestinians-religion "Is Seven Jewish Children anti-semitic?"] ''The Guardian'' (blog), 18 February 2009&lt;/ref&gt; yet ''Seven Jewish Children'' was viewed by another ''Guardian'' writer as historically inaccurate and harshly critical of Jews.&lt;ref&gt;Romain, Jonathan. [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2009/feb/20/judaism-theatre "Selective bravery is not very brave"], ''The Guardian'', 20 February 2009. Quote: "...the same standards must apply to all faiths".&lt;/ref&gt; Jonathan Hoffman, co-vice chairman of the [[Zionist Federation of Great Britain and Ireland]], called the play "a libellous and despicable demonisation of Israeli parents and grandparents" and expressed fear that it would "stoke the fires of [[antisemitism]]". He added that the play is a modern [[blood libel]] drawing on old anti-Semitic myths.&lt;ref name=Symons/&gt; [[Jeffrey Goldberg]] of ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]]'' also calls the play a blood libel.&lt;ref name=Goldberg/&gt; Columnist [[Melanie Phillips]] wrote that the play is "an open vilification of the Jewish people...  drawing upon an atavistic hatred of the Jews" and called it "Open incitement to hatred".&lt;ref name=Symons/&gt; ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote that the play "at times paints heartless images of Israelis."&lt;ref name=Pat/&gt;

In reply, the Royal Court issued the following statement:
{{quote|Some concerns have been raised that the Royal Court's production of ''Seven Jewish Children'', by Caryl Churchill is anti-Semitic.  We categorically reject that accusation....  While ''Seven Jewish Children'' is undoubtedly critical of the policies of the state of Israel, there is no suggestion that this should be read as a criticism of Jewish people....  In keeping with its philosophy, the Royal Court Theatre presents a multiplicity of viewpoints. ''The Stone'', which is currently running... asks very difficult questions about the refusal of some modern Germans to accept their ancestors' complicity in Nazi atrocities. ''Shades'', currently in our smaller studio theatre... explores issues of tolerance in the [London] Muslim community.&lt;ref name=Tele/&gt;}}

[[File:London. St. Paul's Cathedral, West Front (3610785549).jpg|thumb|Photograph, c.1865-c.1895, with the original railings by [[Jean Tijou]] still in place]]
A '''statue of Queen Anne''' is installed in the forecourt outside the west front of [[St Paul's Cathedral]], in London, United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baker|first1=Margaret|title=Discovering London Statues and Monuments|date=2002|publisher=Osprey Publishing|pages=145–146|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pVJLa5jgzQ4C&amp;pg=PA146&amp;lpg=PA146&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=28 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It became a Grade II [[listed building]] in 1972.

==Description and history==
The statue is a copy of an 1712 sculpture by [[Francis Bird]] in [[Carrara marble]] which formerly stood at the same location.  [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] was the ruling British monarch when the new St Paul's Cathedral was completed in 1710.  Bird's statue was unveiled at a thanksgiving service for the [[Peace of Utrecht]], held 7 July 1713.   The statue cost £1,130, excluding the marble which was provided by the Queen.  It was surrounded by an elegant metal railing made by [[Jean Tijou]].  The Tijou railings were later removed and replaced by heavier railings to match the others around the cathedral.  The original statue was attacked at least three times, in 1743, 1768, and 1882, with noses and arms damaged, and it was also badly weathered by the 1880s.  Reputedly, the statue was once defaced with the lines "[[Brandy Nan]], Brandy Nan, left in the lurch; Her face to the gin-shop, her back to the church", alluding to the Queen's reputed fondness for strong liquor and the location of a [[gin palace]] near the cathedral.

[[Richard Claude Belt]] was commissioned in 1885 to create a replacement statue from Sicilian marble, supplied by the [[Corporation of London]] at a cost of £1,800.  Belt was imprisoned for obtaining money by false pretences in March 1886, and [[Louis Auguste Malempré]] completed the sculpture.  The building work to install the statue was done by [[Mowlem|Mowlem and Sons]], supervised by the [[city architect]] Sir [[Horace Jones (architect)|Horace Jones]], and the new sculpture was unveiled by [[Reginald Hanson]], the [[Lord Mayor of London]], on 15 December 1886, the year before the [[Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria]].

The [[Baroque]] sculpture depicts Queen Anne standing, facing down [[Ludgate Hill]] towards [[Ludgate Circus]].  She is robed, wearing the [[Livery collar|collar]] of the [[Order of the Garter]] and a gilded crown, with one hand holding a gilded orb and the other a gilded sceptre.  The figure stands on a [[Portland stone]] pedestal by architect [[Christopher Wren]], decorated with four symbolic figures, one on each corner: to the west, towards Ludgate Hill, are [[Britannia]] with gilded trident (representing England) and a figure representing France (with [[fleur-de-lys]] on the visor of her helmet), holding between them a carved representation of the [[British Royal Coat of Arms]], and to the east, towards St Paul's Cathedral, are figures representing Ireland (with harp) and North America (a Native American, with feathered skirt and headdress, gilded bow, quiver of arrows, and lizard).  The pedestal stands on three steps surrounded by heavy [[cast iron]] railings.

The pedestal bears two inscriptions: on the south side "The Original STATUE / was erected on this spot in the year 1712 / to commemorate the completion of / SAINT PAUL'S CATHEDRAL / FRANCIS BIRD Sculptor." and on the north side: "This Replica / of the Statue of QUEEN ANNE / was erected at the expense of / The CORPORATION of LONDON / In the year 1886 / The Rt. Hon. / SIR [[Reginald Hanson|REGINALD HANSON]] M.A. F.S.A. / [[Lord Mayor of London|Lord Mayor]] / [[William Braham|Wm. Braham]] Esq / Chairman of the City Lands Committee."

After they were removed, the original 8-ton weathered sculpture, and the four similarly weathered 5-ton stone figures from the base, were rediscovered months later abandoned in the yard of a London stonemason.  They were acquired by [[Augustus Hare]] and installed in the grounds of his house at [[Holmhurst St Mary]] near [[Hastings]], with Queen Anne mounted on an elliptical pedestal and the four other seated figures on steps around at the base, similar to the original.  The house was Grade II listed in 1976, and the statue received a separate Grade II* listing at the same time.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2438">A '''symmetry element''' is a point of reference about which [[symmetry operation]]s can take place. In particular, symmetry elements can be identities, mirror planes, axes of rotation (both proper and improper), and centers of inversion.&lt;ref name="Mortimer2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert G. Mortimer|title=Mathematics for Physical Chemistry|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nGoSv5tmATsC&amp;pg=PA276|date=10 June 2005|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=978-0-08-049288-9|pages=276–}}&lt;/ref&gt; A symmetry element corresponds to a symmetry operation that generates the same representation of an object.

==Identity==

The identity symmetry element is found in all objects and is denoted '''E'''.&lt;ref&gt;Glazer, Michael; Burns, Gerald; Glazer, Alexander. Space groups for solid state scientists.&lt;/ref&gt; It corresponds to an operation of doing nothing to the object.

==Mirror planes==

Mirror planes are denoted by '''σ'''. In particular, a vertical mirror plane is denoted '''σ{{sub|v}}'''.

==[[Cyclic symmetry]]==

Cyclic symmetry, also known as radial symmetry, is represented by an axis about which the object rotates in its corresponding symmetry operation. For proper axes of rotation, cyclic symmetry is denoted as '''C{{sub|n}}''', where n is the order of rotation.&lt;ref&gt;Glazer, Michael; Burns, Gerald; Glazer, Alexander. Space groups for solid state scientists.&lt;/ref&gt;
Improper rotation, also known as [[screw axis]] symmetry, is denoted by '''S{{sub|n}}'''. 
Improper rotation is the composition of a rotation axis and a mirror plane. In its symmetry operation, the object is rotated about the axis, then reflected across a mirror plane that is normal to the axis of rotation.

==Inversion==

For inversion, denoted '''i''', there must be a point in the center of an object that is the inversion center. In the inversion operation for 3D coordinates, the inversion center is the origin (0,0,0). When an object is inverted, the position vector of a point in an object, ⟨x,y,z⟩, is inverted to ⟨-x,-y,-z⟩.

'''''The Blue Room''''' ({{lang-fr|'''La chambre bleue'''}}) is a 1901 painting by [[Pablo Picasso]] painted during his [[Picasso's Blue Period|Blue Period]]. It was found to have a different painting hidden under it using [[X-ray technology]] in 2014 by a group of art historians and scientists from the [[Phillips Collection]] in Washington, assisted by scientists from the [[Cornell University]] High Energy Synchrotron Source.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-27884323 |title=Hidden painting found under Picasso's ''The Blue Room'' |accessdate=18 June 2014 |work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Painting qualities==
In ''The Blue Room'' we can see Picasso’s blue period being fully developed. His cool hues and strong use of natural light draw the viewer in to see this young idealized woman bathing in a tub in what we can assume is her bedroom. Although the painting could be described as patchy or mildly unclear, the subject and scene are still identifiable. The woman's figure and small studio background are typical of Picasso's blue period, as seen in other works such as ''The Blind Man’s Meal'' (1903).&lt;ref&gt;“Pablo Picasso: The Blind Man’s Meal”.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Painting materials==
The painting was investigated by several scientific methods in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;Favero, P., Mass, J., Delaney, J., Woll, A., Hull, A., Dooley, K. and Finnefrock, A. (2017). Reflectance imaging spectroscopy and synchrotron radiation X-ray fluorescence mapping used in a technical study of The Blue Room by Pablo Picasso. Heritage Science, 5(1).&lt;/ref&gt; The investigation revealed the hidden portrait described below and the identity of the pigments used in both paintings. Picasso employed a wide palette of vivid pigments such as [[vermilion]], [[viridian]], [[chrome yellow]], and [[cadmium yellow]]. He used predominantly [[Prussian blue]] for the blue areas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://colourlex.com/project/picasso-the-blue-room/ Pablo Picasso, The Blue Room, ColourLex]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hidden painting==
Although this piece can be considered typical of Picasso’s early blue period works, something interesting has come up in the last few years concerning this piece. Using x-ray cameras, scientists from the Phillip’s Collection in Washington discovered another painting just underneath the surface: a portrait of an old man resting his head in his hands.&lt;ref&gt;Simon, “Buried by Picasso, The Man Beneath ‘The Blue Room’ Tells a Story,” 1. &lt;/ref&gt;

==Possible conclusions==  
Historians who have collectively collected biographical information regarding Picasso and his life during his Blue Period have concluded that he likely painted over another of his paintings because of his prolificacy in painting but lack of extra canvases. His economic state would not have allowed him to purchase the many materials needed in order to be a full-time artist. His “melancholy blue portraits” did not result in many eager buyers, or people willing to pay for the portraits he created of random people off the street. Picasso likely painted over several of his works until one would sell, earning money to purchase more materials.&lt;ref&gt;Simon, ''Buried by Picasso, The Man Beneath 'The Blue Room' Tells a Story'', 1. &lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bomberg, The Mud Bath.jpg|thumb|300px|[[David Bomberg]], ''The Mud Bath'', 1914]]

'''''The Mud Bath''''' is a 1914 oil-on-canvas painting by [[David Bomberg]].  The work is considered a masterpiece of Bomberg's work in this period.  Bomberg was a founder member of the [[London Group]], and the painting is considered a leading example of [[Vorticism]], although Bomberg resisted being described as a Vorticist.

The painting is a striking composition of human figures formed from white and blue geometric planes and angles, in a rectangular bath of vibrant red surrounded by a landscape of mustard brown, arranged around a brown and black vertical element (perhaps a column at the baths).  There is a suggestion that the bathers are waving their arms as if in a [[Bacchanalian]] revel.  The scene is based on [[Schewzik Russian Vapour Baths]] in [[Brick Lane]], [[Whitechapel]], near Bomberg's home in [[East End of London|east London]], which was used by the local Jewish population for cleanliness and for religious observances, including the [[mikveh]] ritual bath.  Bomberg's Jewishness was a very important part of his identity as an artist.  The bathing room, with a communal bath approximately 10-foot square and balcony above, was open to either men and women on different days, and may also have been the inspiration for his 1913 work, ''Ju-Jitsu''.

Bomberg created a series of crayon, gouache and chalk studies before the painting. The completed work measures {{convert|152.4|cm}} by {{convert| 224.2|cm}}.  It was a key component in his one-man exhibition the [[Chenil Gallery]] in [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]] in 1914.  In addition to taking first place in the catalogue, the work was hung on the wall outside the gallery so that it could have "every advantage of lighting and space". A critic remarked that the work was "rained upon, baked by the sun and garlanded with flags", but it did not entice many passing the gallery to enter. The ''[[London Chronicle]]'' noted that "The passers-by make no comment, because they do not recognise it as a picture". Bomberg recalled that as they turned the corner of King's Road, horses pulling the number 29 bus would shy at it.

The work was purchased by the Tate Gallery in 1964, seven years after Bomberg's death.

'''''The Oath of Leo III''''' is a [[painting]] by the workshop of the [[Italy|Italian]] [[renaissance]] artist [[Raphael]]. The painting was part of Raphael's commission to decorate the rooms that are now known as the ''[[Raphael Rooms|Stanze di Raffaello]]'', in the [[Apostolic Palace]] in the [[Vatican City|Vatican]]. It is located in the room that was named after ''[[The Fire in the Borgo]]'', the ''Stanza dell'incendio del Borgo''. In the [[fresco]], [[Pope Leo III]] is seen during the trial on December 23  [[AD]] 800 during which he was brought face to face with the nephews of his predecessor [[Pope Hadrian I]], who had accused him of misconduct. The assembled bishops declared that they could not judge the pope, after which Leo took an oath of purgation of his own free will.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mv.vatican.va/3_EN/pages/x_Schede/SDRs/SDRs_04_02_029.html] vatican.va]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Blue Rigi painting.jpg|thumb|''The Blue Rigi'', {{convert|29.7|xx|45|cm}}, 1842, [[Tate Gallery]]]]
[[File:J. M. W. Turner - The Red Rigi - Google Art Project.jpg |thumb|''The Red Rigi'', {{convert|30.5|xx|45.8|cm}}, 1842, [[National Gallery of Victoria]]]]
In 1842, British artist [[J. M. W. Turner]] painted three [[watercolour]]s of the [[Rigi]], a mountain in the [[Alps]] in [[Central Switzerland]], which he had visited the previous summer. Widely regarded as some of his finest works, the watercolours capture the transitory effects of light and atmospheric conditions at the Rigi. According to [[John Ruskin]], "Turner had never made any drawings [watercolours] like these before, and never made any like them again ... He is not showing his hand in these, but his heart."&lt;ref&gt;Cook, E. T.; Wedderburn, A. ''The Works of John Ruskin''. vol. xiii, London: George Allen, 1904, p. 484.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Blue Rigi, Sunrise''''', better known simply as '''''The Blue Rigi''''', was acquired in 2007 by the [[Tate Gallery]] in Britain for £4.95m, matching the price achieved at auction in 2006, then the largest sum paid by the Tate for a single artwork. '''''The Red Rigi''''' is held by Australia's [[National Gallery of Victoria]] and shows the mountain blushed by the evening sun. ''The Dark Rigi'' is held in a private collection. Many preparatory sketches are held by the Tate as part of the [[Turner Bequest]].

Between January and March of 2007, the three Rigi watercolours were united for the first time in an exhibition held at the Tate Gallery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-britain/exhibition/jmw-turner-three-rigis "J.M.W. Turner: The Three Rigis"]. Tate Gallery. Retrieved 17 April 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Turner painted several variations of the Rigi in 1842, following a visit to Switzerland the previous summer.  Completed examples include ''The Red Rigi'', blushed by the evening sun, originally sold to [[Hugh Andrew Johnstone Munro of Novar|H.A.J. Munro of Novar]] and now held by the [[National Gallery of Victoria]] in Melbourne, Australia, and '''''The Dark Rigi''''', an early morning view, in a private collection.  Many preparatory sketches are held by the Tate as past of the [[Turner Bequest]].

Victorian art critic [[John Ruskin]] may have been the first to describe the different members of Turner's Rigi series by their colours.  The different colours and moods of Turner's Rigi series draws parallels that of [[Hokusai]]'s prints of [[Mount Fuji]], [[Cézanne]]'s paintings of [[Mont Sainte-Victoire]], and [[Monet]]'s series of [[Rouen Cathedral]].

Turner painted the watercolours as part of a commercial series of ten watercolours.  He worked up 15 sample studies (sketches) to show potential patrons his intentions, with the hope of securing commissions for fully worked up watercolours to be sold for 80 guineas each.  He also completed ''The Blue Rigi'' and ''The Red Rigi'', and two others, as examples of how the finished paintings would look.   Most were bought by Munro, including ''The Red Rigi'', and he commissioned Turner to complete ''The Dark Rigi''.  Ruskin later bought ''The Red Rigi'' from Munro.

==Description==
''The Blue Rigi'' depicts the [[Rigi]] mountain in central Switzerland, viewed from the southwest across [[Lake Lucerne]].  The "Queen of Mountains" is blue in the early morning light, wreathed by veils of morning mist.  The tonality is built up with layers of colour wash, with fine detail added through cross-hatching with a  fine brush.  The planet [[Venus]] glints in the yellow morning sky above, where paint has been scratched out with a fingernail to reveal the bright white ground.  In the left foreground, drawn in with pen and brown ink, ducks can be seen rising from the lake, alarmed by a gunshot and chased by two dogs, to the right foreground.

==Provenance==
Turner sold ''The Blue Rigi'' in 1842 through dealer Thomas Griffith to whaling mogul [[Elhanan Bicknell]].  After Bicknell's death, the painting was sold at [[Christie's]] in April 1863 for 296 guineas to the art dealer [[Agnew's]], and resold a month later to [[John Edward Taylor]] (son of the founder of the ''[[Manchester Guardian]]''). ''The Blue Rigi'' was engraved as a mezzotint by Sir [[Frank Short]] in 1910.

After Taylor's death, the painting was sold in July 1912 for 2,700 guineas, again auctioned at Christie's and acquired by Agnew's.   Agnew's acquired about two thirds of the Taylor's Turners in the 12-day sale, including ''The Red Rigi'' for 2,100 guineas.  ''The Blue Rigi'' was acquired by cotton broker [[Walter Jones (polo)|Walter H. Jones]] and inherited by his widow, Maud.  Jones later also acquired ''The Red Rigi'' from Agnew's, after it was sold to a different collector and then auctioned at Christie's again in 1928.  After her death, ''The Blue Rigi'' was acquired for a third time by Agnew's at a Christie's auction, in July 1942, for 1,500 guineas, and sold to a private collector.  ''The Red Rigi'' was sold at the same sale for 1,100 guineas.  It was acquired by the [[National Gallery of Victoria]], in Melbourne, Australia, in 1947.

In 2000-01, ''The Blue Rigi'' was illustrated as the frontispiece to the catalogue accompanying an exhibition of Turner's watercolours at the [[Royal Academy]].  The work was auctioned for a fourth time at Christie's on 5 June 2006, achieving a sale price of £5,832,000 including [[buyer's premium]], against an estimate of £2m.  The hammer price doubled the record for a British work on paper, previously set by [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]]'s ''Pandora'' at £2.6m in 2000.   The work was temporarily denied an [[export licence]] and it was acquired by the [[Tate Gallery]] in 2007 at a matching price (after allowance for tax reliefs) of £4.95m - the largest sum paid by the Tate for a single artwork.   The acquisition was funded by £1,950,000 from the [[National Heritage Memorial Fund]], £2m from the Tate's own resources, £500,000 from the [[Art Fund]], and £582,000 raised from the public by the "Save the Blue Rigi" appeal.

''The Dark Rigi'' was also sold to a private collector in February 2006, for £2.7m.  A proposed sale to the [[National Gallery of Art]] in Washington, DC, was abandoned when the British government imposed a temporary export ban.

The three Rigi paintings - ''Blue'', ''Red'' and ''Dark'' - were exhibited together at the Tate Gallery in 2007, and again in 2014.

[[Martin Hardie]] wrote of Turner: "In the Rigi drawings he is the insuperable master of technique. He used every possible manipulation of brush, colour and paper, every device, every weapon in his armoury, sponging, rubbing, washing, stippling, hatching, touching and retouching, to express the vibration and radiation of light. Light was his theme."

'''''The Stories of Vladimir Nabokov''''' (in some British editions, '''''The Collected Stories''''') is a posthumous collection of every known short story that [[Vladimir Nabokov]] ever wrote, with the exception of "[[The Enchanter]]". The thirteen stories not previously published in English are translated by the author's son, [[Dmitri Nabokov]]. The collection was first published in America by [[Alfred A. Knopf]] in 1995.

The collection includes 65 stories (including one that was long considered lost, but discovered shortly before the latest edition of the volume).

'''Vincent Callebaut''' (b. May 27, 1977 - ) is a Belgian ecological [[architect]]. He designs futuristic-like [[ecodistrict]] projects which take account of several aspects of sustainability (renewable energies, biodiversity, urban agriculture).

==Biography==

Vincent Callebaut was born in 1977 in Belgium. He graduated in 2000 from the Institute [[Victor Horta]], he moved to Paris to intern with architects [[Odile Decq]] and [[Massimiliano Fuksas]] and then founded his own company, « ''Vincent Callebaut Architectures'' ».

==Virtual projects==

===Dragonfly===

The project consists on implementing "[[Vertical farming|vertical farms]]" in [[Manhattan]] along the East River at the South edge of the Roosevelt Island. In a way to rethink the city's food production and encourage each inhabitant to participate to the gardens, one of the visions of the Dragonfly project was defined as: 'Eating an apple just picked out of a collective orchard in the fourth floor while looking at New York through the window and then go back to your office just in the upper floor.'&lt;ref name="culturebox"&gt;{{cite web|title=culturebox|url=http://culturebox.francetvinfo.fr/tendances/architecture/architecte-visionnaire-vincent-callebaut-invente-la-ville-de-demain-148595|website=culturebox.francetvinfo.fr|accessdate=2 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This project was inspired by the Japanese movie "[[Castle in the Sky|Laputa : Castle in the sky]]".&lt;ref name="FranceAmerique"&gt;{{cite web|title=Dragonfly|url=http://www.france-amerique.com/articles/2009/07/31/dragonfly_une_ferme_dans_un_gratte-ciel.html|website=france-amerique.com|accessdate=2 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dragonfly building is {{convert|575|m}} high, shaped as firefly wings. It is composed of two towers related by a 'bio-climatic' glasshouse.  It deploys itself between two crystalline wings made out of glass and steel. The structure in honeycomb stitch allows the sunlight to pass through the building.&lt;ref name="urbanism" /&gt; This concept is seen as a feeder farm and reconnects the consumers with producers. This prototype of urban farm would have superimposed 132 floors and estending {{convert|600|m}} vertically with garden vegetables, fields, production of meat, milk, poultry and eggs where people could grow their own food. The Dragonfly can accommodate 28 different agricultural fields for the production. It is self-sufficient in energy, water and bio-fertilizing, powered by sunshield and eolian systems. These combine solar and wind power, which would make the Dragonfly self-sufficient.&lt;ref name="inhabitat"&gt;{{cite web|title=Inhabitat|url=http://inhabitat.com/dragonfly-urban-agriculture-concept-for-ny/|website=inhabitat.com|accessdate=2 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Everything is recyclable in a continuous auto-feeding so that nothing is lost.  The spaces between the wings are designed to take advantage of solar energy by accumulating warm air in the structure during winter. During the summer it is cooling which is facilitated through natural ventilation and "evapo-perspiration" from the plants.&lt;ref name="inhabitat" /&gt;

The objectives of the Dragonfly project were defined as:
*Creating a proximity between the inhabitants and their productions.
*Reducing intermediaries in the production mode.
*Getting close to self-sufficiency which leads to financial savings.&lt;ref name="urbanism"&gt;{{cite web|title=Dragonfly|url=http://projets-architecte-urbanisme.fr/projet-dragonfly-de-vincent-callebaut-ferme-verticale-dans-new-york/|website=Architecture Urbanisme|accessdate=16 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lilypad===
{{Main| Floating ecopolis}}
The Lilypad or [[Floating ecopolis]] project is based on the idea of creating a place for future refugees of [[Current sea level rise]] caused by [[Global warming]].

=== Tao Zhu Yin Yuan ===

Formerly called "Agora Garden", Vincent Callebaut designed a tower for [[Taipei]], promoting vertical construction in an overpopulated city.&lt;ref name=FranceInter&gt;
{{cite web

 | website= franceinter.fr
 | url= http://www.franceinter.fr/player/reecouter?play=676754
 | accessdate= 2 December 2014
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; It is a concept of eco-construction to reduce the carbon footprint of its inhabitants.&lt;ref name=Dezeen&gt;
{{cite web
 | title= Dezeen
 | website= dezeen.com
 | url= http://www.dezeen.com/2013/04/05/agora-garden-by-vincent-callebaut/
 | accessdate= 2 December 2014
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Vincent Callebaut Architectures SARL replied to an invitation to tender in November 2010. As of 2014 the project is under construction, and due for completion in 2016.&lt;ref name=culturebox/&gt;

The shape of the building looks like a molecule of [[DNA]] with its [[double helix]] (but in opposite [[chirality]] of most common (known) B-form DNA). This was designed to represent a symbol of life and [[wikt:dynamism|dynamism]].&lt;ref name=FranceInter/&gt; The surface area is about {{convert|50000|m²}}.

The aim of the project is to represent a perfect [[symbiosis]] between humans and nature. Vincent Callebaut aims to develop an avant-gardist architecture and tries to institute a new life style in harmony with nature. The building is intended to guarantee environmental norms in order to obtain the Green Building Label delivered by the Home Affairs Ministry of Taipei.

The project addresses four ecologic objectives of the [[Copenhagen Accord]]:&lt;ref name=Dezeen/&gt;

* Reduction of [[global warming]]
* Protection of biodiversity.
* Protection of the environment and quality of life
* Management natural resources and waste

The Agora Garden concept embraces the [[Cradle to Cradle]] philosophy: "nothing is lost and everything transforms itself" ([[Antoine Lavoisier]]). All materials are recycled or recyclable in order to imitate the processes of natural ecosystems. For example, at the top there is a huge free access garden covered by photovoltaic panels which produce electricity for the building. The tower is surrounding by {{convert|20|m|adj=on}} trees which increase the biodiversity in the city.&lt;ref name=Dezeen/&gt;

Agora Garden was planned as twenty levels in a double helix formation, with a total twist from bottom to top of ninety degrees. The twist satisfies four major objectives. Firstly, thanks to this architecture, the morphology of the building changes according to its orientation: On the East/West side we can see a rhomboidal pyramid, when one the North/South side we can see a reverse pyramid. Then, all flats have their own balconies looking like a [[hanging garden]]. Thirdly, there is no vis-à-vis so inhabitants have privacy and a panoramic view on Taipei.&lt;ref name=FranceInter/&gt; &lt;!-- And number four has gone missing? --&gt;

The six main components of the project are :
* The forestair{{clarify|date=November 2017}}: the building is bordered by a forest which ensures the privacy of the inhabitants. The light is over present{{clarify|date=November 2017}} and the car parks, the swimming pool and the fitness area are naturally ventilated.
* Indoor and outdoor areas are well connected thanks to all the bay windows.
* The central core is composed of two staircases, four high speed elevators, a car elevator and two sky garages.
* The apartments measure {{convert|650|m2}}. This could seem large for European people but in Taiwan it is not uncommon for large families of three generations to live together in one flat.
* The landscapes balconies project is to build gardens which cover the entire building and in this way reeintroduce an element of nature to the city. Inhabitants can cultivate fruits, vegetables and herbs so that they could be self-sufficient. Therefore, this gardens take part of the sustainability process. There are compost spaces to transform waste into organic fertilizers, and reservoirs to collect rainwater.
* At a height of {{convert|100|m}}, a {{convert|1000|m²}} [[pergola]] with photovoltaic covering generates electricity for the network of the building.

===The Gate===

The Gate is under construction in Cairo (Egypt). It is a multi-use complex with housing, work spaces and facilities like sports. The roof top is a garden where you can swim or run.

In [[literature]], '''writing style''' is the manner of expressing thought in language characteristic of an individual, period, school, or nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Webster|1969}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, style is a term that may refer, at one and the same time, to both conventions that go beyond the individual writer and to singular aspects of individual writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Aquilina|2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond the essential elements of [[spelling]],  [[grammar]], and [[punctuation]], writing style is the choice of [[word]]s, [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentence]] structure, and [[paragraph]] structure, used to convey the meaning effectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Sebranek et al.|2006|p=111}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The former are referred to as ''rules'', ''elements'', ''essentials'', ''mechanics'', or ''handbook''; the latter are referred to as ''style'', or ''rhetoric''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|pp=100,129,156}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The rules are about ''what'' a writer does; style is about ''how'' the writer does it.  While following the rules drawn from established English usage, a writer has great flexibility in how to express a concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Strunk|White|1979|p=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The point of good writing style is to
* express the message to the reader simply, clearly, and convincingly;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Hacker|1991|p=78}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Ross-Larson|1991|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Sebranek et al.|2006|pp=85,99,112}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Strunk|White|1979|pp=69,79,81}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* keep the reader attentive, engaged, and interested;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Ross-Larson|1991|pp=18–19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Sebranek et al.|2006|pp=21,26,112}}&lt;/ref&gt;
not to
* display the writer’s personality;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Gardner|1991|p=163}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* demonstrate the writer’s skills, knowledge, or abilities;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Sebranek et al.|2006|p=112}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Strunk|White|1979|p=69}}&lt;/ref&gt;
although these are usually evident and are what experts consider the writer’s individual style.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Ross-Larson|1999|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Strunk|White|1979|pp=66,68}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Choice of words ==
[[Diction]], or the choice of ''words'', is obviously a central element in every writer’s style.  Although good diction is partly a matter of trial and error, of tinkering with sentences until they sound right, it is also a matter of following certain general preferences that careful readers and writers tend to share.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|p=100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some methods for using diction effectively in writing:
* Use a dictionary and thesaurus&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|pp=100–105}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Hacker|1991|pp=187–189,191}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Seek a middle level of diction&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|pp=105–106}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Hacker|1991|pp=176–178,181–182}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Call things by their names&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|pp=106–107}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Avoid redundancy and circumlocution&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|pp=107–108}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Hacker|1991|pp=166–172}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Lamb|2008|pp=225–226}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Avoid clichés&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|pp=108–109}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Hacker|1991|pp=194–196}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Strunk|White|1979|pp=80–81}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Avoid jargon&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|pp=109–111}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Hacker|1991|pp=175–176}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Avoid obsolete, archaic, or invented words&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Hacker|1991|p=179}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Avoid slang, regional expressions, and nonstandard English&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Hacker|1991|pp=180–181,192–193}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Strunk|White|1979|pp=75–76,81–84}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Avoid qualifiers&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Lamb|2008|p=225}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Strunk|White|1979|p=73}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Avoid fancy words&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Lamb|2008|p=227}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Strunk|White|1979|pp=76–78}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Use words in their established senses&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|pp=111–112}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Avoid offensive or sexist language&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|pp=112–113}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Hacker|1991|pp=183–185}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Say no more than you mean&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|p=114}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Be as concrete as your meaning allows&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|pp=114–116}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Hacker|1991|pp=190–191}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Strunk|White|1979|pp=21–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Use logical terms precisely&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|p=116}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Put statements in positive form&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|pp=116–117}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Lamb|2008|pp=228–229}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Strunk|White|1979|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Make metaphors vivid and appropriate&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|pp=117–121}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Lamb|2008|p=229}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Prefer vivid nouns and active verbs to adjectives and adverbs&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Hacker|1991|pp=151–152}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Lamb|2008|p=224}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Strunk|White|1979|pp=71–72}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Choice of sentence structure ==
Sooner or later, a writer will have the essential elements of formal ''sentence'' correctness under control and will want to find the best ways of making sentences convey meaning effectively:  how to phrase statements definitely, place coordinate thoughts in coordinate structures, [[Dependent clause|subordinate]] to sharpen the relation between main assertions and modifying elements, eliminate unnecessary words, vary sentence structure, maintain consistency of [[Tone (literature)|tone]], and smooth the general flow of words.  Seemingly minor improvements—the moving of a [[clause]] from one position to another, a shift from the [[Passive voice|passive]] to the [[active voice]], even a slight change in rhythm—can make the difference between drab sentences and pointed ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|p=129}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some methods for writing effective sentences:
* Avoid irrelevancy&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|pp=129–130}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Make real assertions&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|p=130}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Rely on the active voice&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|pp=130–131}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Lamb|2008|p=223}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Strunk|White|1979|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Coordinate to show that ideas belong together&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|pp=131–133}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Hacker|1991|pp=110–111,116–117}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Repeat words, phrases, and clauses for emphasis&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|pp=133–134}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Make series consistent and climactic&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|pp=134–135}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Subordinate to show which is the main statement&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|pp=135–136}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Hacker|1991|pp=111–113}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Subordinate to avoid monotony&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|p=137}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Hacker|1991|pp=114–115}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Subordinate to break up lengthy compound sentences&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|pp=137–138}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Choose an appropriate means of subordination&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|p=138}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Hacker|1991|pp=118–119}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Place subordinate elements where they will convey the exact meaning&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|pp=138–140}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Subordinate in one direction per sentence&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|pp=140–141}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Be concise but do not omit necessary words&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|pp=141–142}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Hacker|1991|pp=126–130}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Lamb|2008|pp=222–223,226,228}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Strunk|White|1979|pp=23–25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Break the monopoly of declarative sentences&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|p=143}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Hacker|1991|pp=161–162}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Vary the order and complexity of sentence elements&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|pp=144–145}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Hacker|1991|pp=157–161}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Lamb|2008|p=226}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Strunk|White|1979|pp=32–33}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Vary the length of the sentences.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|p=145}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Be consistent&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|pp=146–148}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Avoid distracting repetitions of sound&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|pp=148–149}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Listen for sentence rhythm&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|pp=149–151}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Gardner|1991|pp=150–154}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Lamb|2008|pp=227–228}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Use parallel construction&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Hacker|1991|pp=121–124,155–156}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Lamb|2008|p=223}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Strunk|White|1979|pp=26–28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Keep related words together&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Lamb|2008|pp=223–224}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Strunk|White|1979|pp=28–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Choice of paragraph structure ==
The most important unit of meaning in every literary work is the ''paragraph''.  Although each sentence conveys a thought, a literary work is not just a sequence of, say, eighty thoughts; it is rather a development of one central [[Thesis statement|thesis]] through certain steps.  Those steps are paragraphs.  Within an effective paragraph the sentences support and extend one another in various ways, making a single, usually complex, unfolding idea.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|p=156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from outright incoherence, choppiness, or long-windedness, perhaps the most common flaw in paragraph construction is rigidity of presentation.  Having something to say, the writer merely says it—and goes on to do just the same in the following paragraph.  As a result, the reader feels, not like a participant in the writer’s thought, but like someone receiving instructions or being shown a rapid succession of images.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|pp=166–167}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some methods for writing effective paragraphs:
* Pursue one main idea&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|pp=157–160}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Hacker|1991|pp=80–81}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Place the main idea emphatically&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|pp=160–161}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Hacker|1991|pp=78–80}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Choose a suitable pattern of development&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|pp=161–175}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Hacker|1991|pp=83–93}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Strunk|White|1979|pp=15,70–71}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Link sentences within each paragraph&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|pp=175–179}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Hacker|1991|pp=99–106}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Link each paragraph to the next&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|p=179}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Hacker|1991|pp=99–106}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Vary the length of the paragraphs&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|pp=179–181}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Hacker|1991|pp=97–98}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Lamb|2008|p=226}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Move between generality and detail&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|pp=181–183}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Keep things moving&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|p=183}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Write in paragraph blocks&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|pp=184–185}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Strunk|White|1979|pp=15–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Make the first paragraph count&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|pp=185–192}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* End with a strong paragraph&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|pp=193–196}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==
Note how rewriting the familiar sentence, "[[The American Crisis|These are the times that try men’s souls.]]" by [[Thomas Paine]], changes the overall impact of the message.

:Times like these try men’s souls.
:How trying it is to live in these times!
:These are trying times for men’s souls.
:Soulwise, these are trying times.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Strunk|White|1979|p=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Compare the following passages, and note how the authors convey their messages in different manners, as a result of their choices.

''[[Hamlet]]'', Act II, Scene 2 (1599–1602) by [[William Shakespeare]]:

&lt;!-- This passage is reproduced verbatim from the play.  Please do not correct. --&gt;
:HAMLET.  I will tell you why; so shall my anticipation prevent your discovery, and your secrecy to the king and queen moult no feather.  I have of late—but wherefore I know not—lost all my mirth, forgone all custom of exercises; and indeed it goes so heavily with my disposition that this goodly frame, the earth, seems to me a sterile promontory; this most excellent canopy, the air, look you, this brave o’erhanging firmament, this  majestical roof fretted with golden fire, why, it appears no other thing to me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapors.  What a piece of work is a man! how noble in reason! how infinite in faculty! in form and moving how expressed and admirable! in action how like an angel! in apprehension how like a god! the beauty of the world! the paragon of animals!  And yet, to me, what is this quintessence of dust? man delights not me; no, nor woman neither, though by your smiling you seem to say so.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Mack et al.|1985|pp=1923–1924}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[A Tale of Two Cities]]'' (1859) by [[Charles Dickens]]:

:It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way – in short, the period was so far like the present period, that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received, for good or for evil, in the superlative degree of comparison only.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Dickens|2000|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[A Child's Christmas in Wales#Publishing history|Memories of Christmas]]'' (1945) by [[Dylan Thomas]]:

:One Christmas was so much like another, in those years, around the sea-town corner now, and out of all sound except the distant speaking of the voices I sometimes hear a moment before sleep, that I can never remember whether it snowed for six days and six nights when I was twelve or whether it snowed for twelve days and twelve nights when I was six; or whether the ice broke and the skating grocer vanished like a snowman through a white trap-door on that same Christmas Day that the mince-pies finished Uncle Arnold and we tobogganed down the seaward hill, all the afternoon, on the best tea-tray, and Mrs. Griffiths complained, and we threw a snowball at her niece, and my hands burned so, with the heat and the cold, when I held them in front of the fire, that I cried for twenty minutes and then had some jelly.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Eastman et al.|1977|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"[[Ray Bradbury short fiction bibliography#1955|The Strawberry Window]]" (1955) by [[Ray Bradbury]]:

:In his dream he was shutting the front door with its strawberry windows and lemon windows and windows like white clouds and windows like clear water in a country stream.  Two dozen panes squared round the one big pane, colored of fruit wines and gelatins and cool water ices.  He remembered his father holding him up as a child.  "Look!"  And through the green glass the world was emerald, moss, and summer mint.  "Look!"  The lilac pane made livid grapes of all the passers-by.  And at last the strawberry glass perpetually bathed the town in roseate warmth, carpeted the world in pink sunrise, and made the cut lawn seem imported from some Persian rug bazaar.  The strawberry window, best of all, cured people of their paleness, warmed the cold rain, and set the blowing, shifting February snows afire.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Bradbury|1971|p=164}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Letter from Birmingham Jail]]'' (1963) by [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]]:

:Moreover, I am cognizant of the interrelatedness of all communities and states.  I cannot sit idly by in Atlanta and not be concerned about what happens in Birmingham.  Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.  We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny.  Whatever affects one directly, affects all indirectly.  Never again can we afford to live with the narrow, provincial "outside agitator" idea.  Anyone who lives inside the United States can never be considered an outsider anywhere within its bounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Eastman et al.|1977|p=810}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Writer's voice ==&lt;!-- Writer's voice links here. --&gt;
{{Distinguish|Character's voice|Grammatical voice}}

The '''writer's voice''' is a rather vague metaphorical term by which some critics refer to distinctive features of a written work in terms of spoken utterance.  The voice of a literary work is then the specific group of characteristics displayed by the narrator or poetic "speaker" (or, in some uses, the actual author behind them), assessed in terms of ''tone'', ''style'', or ''personality''.  Distinctions between various kinds of narrative voice tend to be distinctions between kinds of ''[[Narrative#Types of narrators and their modes|narrator]]'' in terms of how they address the reader (rather than in terms of their perception of events, as in the distinct concept of ''[[Point of view (literature)|point of view]]'').  Likewise in non-narrative poems, distinctions can be made between the personal voice of a private lyric and the assumed voice (the [[Persona#In literature|persona]]) of a dramatic monologue.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Baldick|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An author uses sentence patterns not only to make a point or tell a story, but to do it in a certain manner that amounts to a personal signature, a characteristic way of presenting reality.  It is perfectly understandable that an aspiring writer could fall in love with the work of a brilliant literary figure (for example, [[William Faulkner]] or [[William S. Burroughs]]) and then try to emulate that literary voice, but when an amateur aims deliberately for the sort of mature voice found in seasoned professionals, the result is likely to be literarily pretentious and largely unreadable.  In fact, this sort of literary pretentiousness is a clear mark of an amateur.  A strong, distinctive, authoritative writing voice is something most fiction writers want and is something any writer can bring out in himself or herself, but oddly enough, it can’t be produced by concentrating on it, nor can it be imparted by an editor or teacher.  Such an effect is achieved simply by writing often and carefully.  Spending creative energy in the service of the way sentences read as prose is likely to be at the expense of the characters or story.  Writers should concentrate on characters and story and let their voice take care of itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Browne|King|1993|pp=175–177}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|p=148}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing coaches, teachers, and authors of [[creative writing]] books often speak of the writer's voice as distinguished from other [[literary element]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Lamb|2008|pp=198–206}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Rozelle|2005|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, as voice is often described vaguely, their distinction may be only superficial.  In some instances, voice is defined nearly the same as style;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|p=148}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Rozelle|2005|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; in others, as [[Literary genre|genre]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Lamb|2008|p=209}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[literary mode]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Gardner|1991|pp=24,26,100,116}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Lamb|2008|pp=201–202}}&lt;/ref&gt; point of view,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Gardner|1991|pp=158–159}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mood (literature)|mood]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Pianka|1998|p=94}}&lt;/ref&gt; or tone.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Lamb|2008|p=198}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Pianka|1998|p=94}}&lt;/ref&gt;
