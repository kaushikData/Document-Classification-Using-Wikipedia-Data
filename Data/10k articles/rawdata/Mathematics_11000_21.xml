'''139''' ('''One hundred [and] thirty-nine''') is the [[natural number]] following [[138 (number)|138]] and preceding [[140 (number)|140]].

==In mathematics==
139 is the 34th [[prime number]]. It is a [[twin prime]] with [[137 (number)|137]]. Because [[141 (number)|141]] is a [[semiprime]], 139 is a [[Chen prime]]. 139 is the smallest prime before a [[prime gap]] of length 10.&lt;ref&gt;Wells, D. ''[[The Penguin Dictionary of Curious and Interesting Numbers]]'' London: Penguin Group. (1987): 139&lt;/ref&gt;

This number is the sum of five consecutive prime numbers ([[19 (number)|19]] + [[23 (number)|23]] + [[29 (number)|29]] + [[31 (number)|31]] + [[37 (number)|37]]).

It is the smallest [[factorization|factor]] of [[64079 (number)|64079]]. It is also the smallest factor of the first nine terms of the [[Euclid–Mullin sequence]], making it the tenth term.

139 is a [[happy number]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oeis.org/A007770|title=Sloane's A007770 : Happy numbers|last=|first=|date=|website=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|publisher=OEIS Foundation|access-date=2016-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[strictly non-palindromic number]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oeis.org/A016038|title=Sloane's A016038 : Strictly non-palindromic numbers|last=|first=|date=|website=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|publisher=OEIS Foundation|access-date=2016-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Absorption''' is a [[Validity (logic)|valid]] [[argument form]] and [[rule of inference]] of [[propositional logic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |ref=harv |last=Copi |first=Irving M. |last2=Cohen |first2=Carl |title=Introduction to Logic |publisher=Prentice Hall |year=2005 |page=362 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.philosophypages.com/lg/e11a.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The rule states that if &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;. The rule makes it possible to introduce [[Logical conjunction|conjunctions]] to [[formal proof|proofs]]. It is called the law of absorption because the term &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; is "absorbed" by the term &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; in the [[consequent]].&lt;ref&gt;Russell and Whitehead, ''[[Principia Mathematica]]''&lt;/ref&gt; The rule can be stated:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{P \to Q}{\therefore P \to (P \land Q)}&lt;/math&gt;

where the rule is that wherever an instance of "&lt;math&gt;P \to Q&lt;/math&gt;" appears on a line of a proof, "&lt;math&gt;P \to (P \land Q)&lt;/math&gt;" can be placed on a subsequent line.

== Formal notation ==
The ''absorption'' rule may be expressed as a [[sequent]]:

: &lt;math&gt;P \to Q \vdash P \to (P \land Q)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\vdash&lt;/math&gt; is a [[metalogic]]al symbol meaning that &lt;math&gt;P \to (P \land Q)&lt;/math&gt; is a [[logical consequence|syntactic consequences]] of &lt;math&gt;(P \rightarrow Q)&lt;/math&gt; in some [[formal system|logical system]];

and expressed as a truth-functional [[tautology (logic)|tautology]] or [[theorem]] of [[propositional calculus|propositional logic]]. The principle was stated as a theorem of propositional logic by [[Bertrand Russell|Russell]] and [[Alfred Whitehead|Whitehead]] in  ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'' as:

:&lt;math&gt;(P \to Q) \leftrightarrow (P \to (P \land Q))&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; are propositions expressed in some [[formal system]].

'''Sir Alfred William Flux''' [[CB (Honour)|CB]] (8 April 1867&amp;nbsp;– 16 July 1942) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[economist]] and [[statistician]].

Flux was born in the [[Landport]] district of [[Portsmouth]] in 1867, the son of a cement maker.&lt;ref name=gw/&gt; He attended [[Portsmouth Grammar School]] then studied mathematics at [[St John's College, Cambridge]] where he was a [[Senior Wrangler]] in 1887&lt;ref name=venn&gt;{{acad|id=FLS884AW|name=Flux, Alfred William}}&lt;/ref&gt; (sharing the honour in a tie with three others). While at Cambridge he became friends with [[Alfred Marshall]], who interested him in economics. He was a foundation member of the Economic Society (1890), and from 1893 until 1908 taught economics, at Manchester and then at [[McGill University]], Montreal.&lt;ref name=nature&gt;{{cite journal| journal=Nature| title=Obituary: Sir Alfred William Flux, C.B| volume=150 |page= 228 |year= 1942 | doi=10.1038/150228a0 |last=Bowley | first=A. L. | authorlink=A. L. Bowley | issue=3799}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1897, while in Manchester he married Harriet Emily Hansen, a Danish woman.&lt;ref name=gw/&gt;

Flux returned to London in 1908 to take up a post as advisor to the Commercial, Labour and Statistics Department. In 1918, he was appointed Head of the Statistics Department of the [[Board of Trade]].&lt;ref name=gw&gt;{{cite journal|last=Groenewegen|first= Peter|title= Alfred William Flux (1867–1942): a mathematician successfully ‘caught’ for economics by Marshall|journal=History of Economics Review |volume= 48 | year=2008| pages=63–77|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_6787/is_48/ai_n31847312/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Royal Statistical Society]] awarded him the [[Guy Medal]] in Silver in 1921 and in Gold in 1930. He also served as President of the Society between 1928 and 1930.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rss.org.uk/site/cms/contentviewarticle.asp?article=486 |title=Royal Statistical Society Presidents |publisher=Royal Statistical Society |accessdate=6 August 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120317044817/http://www.rss.org.uk/site/cms/contentviewarticle.asp?article=486 |archivedate=17 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Flux retired to Denmark in 1932 and was [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]] in 1934. He died of pneumonia in 1942, aged 75.&lt;ref name=gw/&gt;&lt;ref name=venn/&gt;

'''Andreas Floer''' ({{IPA-de|ˈfløːɐ|lang}}; 23 August 1956 – 15 May 1991)&lt;!--Per MOS, full dates in infobox need not be repeated in lede--&gt; was a [[Germany|German]] [[mathematician]] who made seminal contributions to the areas of [[geometry]], [[topology]], and [[mathematical physics]], in particular the invention of [[Floer homology]].

==Life==
He was an undergraduate student at the [[Ruhr-Universität Bochum]] and received a [[Diplom]] in mathematics in 1982. He then went to the [[University of California, Berkeley]] and undertook PhD work on [[monopole (mathematics)|monopole]]s on [[3-manifold]]s, under the supervision of [[Clifford Taubes]]; but he did not complete it when interrupted by his obligatory [[Zivildienst|alternative service]] in Germany. He received his PhD (Dr. phil.) at Bochum in 1984, under the supervision of [[Eduard Zehnder]].

Floer's first pivotal contribution was a solution of a special case of [[V. I. Arnold|Arnold]]'s [[Arnold conjecture|conjecture]] on fixed points of a [[symplectomorphism]].  Because of his work on Arnold's conjecture and his development of [[instanton homology]], he achieved wide recognition and was invited as a plenary speaker for the [[International Congress of Mathematicians]] held in [[Kyoto]] in August 1990.  He received a [[Sloan Fellowship]] in 1989.

In 1988 he became an Assistant Professor at the University of California, Berkeley and was promoted to Full Professor of Mathematics in 1990. From 1990 he was Professor of Mathematics at the Ruhr-Universität Bochum, until his suicide in 1991.

==Quotes==
"Andreas Floer's life was tragically interrupted, but his mathematical visions and striking contributions have provided powerful methods which are being applied to problems which seemed to be intractable only a few years ago."{{Ref|hoferetal}}

[[Simon Donaldson]] wrote: "The concept of Floer homology is one of the most striking developments in differential geometry over the past 20 years. ... The ideas have led to great advances in the areas of low-dimensional topology and symplectic geometry and are intimately related to developments in Quantum Field Theory"{{Ref|donaldson1}} and "the full richness of Floer's theory is only beginning to be explored".{{Ref|donaldson2}}

"Since its introduction by Andreas Floer in the late nineteen eighties, Floer theory has had a tremendous influence on many branches of mathematics including geometry, topology and dynamical systems. The development of new Floer theoretic tools continues at a remarkable pace and underlies many of the recent breakthroughs in these diverse fields."{{Ref|BIRS2007}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1496">In mathematics, the '''Andrews–Curtis conjecture''' states that every balanced [[presentation of a group|presentation]] of the [[trivial group]] can be transformed into a trivial presentation by a sequence of [[Nielsen transformation]]s on the relators together with conjugations of relators, named after [[James J. Andrews (mathematician)|James J. Andrews]] and [[Morton L. Curtis]] who proposed it in 1965.  It is difficult to verify whether the conjecture holds for a given balanced presentation or not.

It is widely believed that the Andrews–Curtis conjecture is false. While there are no counterexamples known, there are numerous potential counterexamples.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sci.ccny.cuny.edu/~shpil/gworld/problems/Back.html Open problems in combinatorial group theory]&lt;/ref&gt; It is known that the [[Zeeman conjecture]] on [[collapsibility]] implies the Andrews–Curtis conjecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Springer|id=c/c110310|title=Collapsibility}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2367">'''[[Atomistix]] Virtual NanoLab''' (VNL) is a commercial point-and-click software for simulation and analysis of physical and chemical properties of [[Nanotechnology|nanoscale devices]]. Virtual NanoLab is developed and sold commercially by QuantumWise A/S.&lt;ref&gt;[http://quantumwise.com/ QuantumWise acquired the products from Atomistix]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Features ==
With its graphical interface, Virtual NanoLab provides a user-friendly approach to atomic-scale modeling. The software contains a set of interactive instruments that allows the user to design [[Nanotechnology|nanosystems]], to set up and execute numerical calculations, and to visualize the results.
Samples such as [[molecules]], [[Carbon nanotube|nanotubes]], [[crystal|crystalline systems]], and two-probe systems (i.e. a nanostructure coupled to two electrodes) are built with a few mouse clicks. 

Virtual NanoLab contains a 3D visualization tool, the Nanoscope, where atomic geometries and computed results can be viewed and analyzed. One can for example plot [[Bloch wave|Bloch functions]] of nanotubes and [[crystal]]s, [[molecular orbital]]s, [[electron density|electron densities]], and effective potentials. 
The numerical engine that carries out the actual simulations is [[Atomistix ToolKit]], which combines [[density functional theory]] and non-equilibrium [[Green's functions]] to [[ab initio]] electronic-structure and transport calculations. Atomistix ToolKit is developed from the academic codes TranSIESTA&lt;ref&gt;Brandbyge, Mozos, Ordejón, Taylor, and Stokbro, [https://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.65.165401 "Density-functional method for non-equilibrium electron transport"], Physical Review B 65, 165401 (2002).&lt;/ref&gt; and McDCal.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Guo, and Wang, [https://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.63.245407 "Ab initio modeling of quantum transport properties of molecular electronic devices"], Physical Review B 63, 245407 (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3271">In [[mathematics]], in the field of [[group theory]], the '''Baer–Specker group''', or '''Specker group''', named after [[Reinhold Baer]] and [[Ernst Specker]], is an example of an infinite [[Abelian group]] which is a building block in the structure theory of such groups.

==Definition==
The Baer–Specker group is the group ''B'' = '''Z'''&lt;sup&gt;'''N'''&lt;/sup&gt; of all integer sequences with componentwise addition, that is, the [[direct product of groups|direct product]] of [[countably infinite|countably]] many copies of '''Z'''. &lt;!-- For each ''n'' in '''N''', let ''e''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; be the sequence with ''n''-th term equal to 1 and all other terms 0.--&gt;

==Properties==
[[Reinhold Baer]] proved in 1937 that this group is ''not'' [[Free abelian group|free abelian]]; Specker proved in 1950 that every countable subgroup of ''B'' is free abelian.

The group of homomorphisms from the Baer–Specker group to a free abelian group of finite rank is a free abelian group of countable rank. This provides another proof that the group is not free.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Blass|Göbel|1996}} attribute this result to {{harvtxt|Specker|1950}}. They write it in the form &lt;math&gt;P^*\cong S&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; denotes the Baer-Specker group, the star operator gives the dual group of homomorphisms to &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is the free abelian group of countable rank. They continue, "It follows that &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; has no direct summand isomorphic to &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;", from which an immediate consequence is that &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is not free abelian.&lt;/ref&gt; See also E. F. Cornelius, Jr., "Endomorphisms and product bases of the Baer-Specker group", Int'l J. Math. and Math. Sciences, 2009, article 396475.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4839">[[Image:Trott bitangents.png|right|frame|The [[Trott curve]] (black) has 28 real bitangents (red).
This image shows 7 of them; the others are symmetric with respect to 90° rotations through the origin and reflections through the two blue axes.]]

In [[mathematics]], a '''bitangent''' to a [[curve]] ''C'' is a line ''L'' that touches ''C'' in two distinct points ''P'' and ''Q'' and that has the same direction as ''C'' at these points. That is, ''L'' is a [[tangent line]] at ''P'' and at ''Q''.

==Bitangents of algebraic curves==
In general, an [[algebraic curve]] will have infinitely many [[secant line]]s, but only finitely many bitangents.

[[Bézout's theorem]] implies that a [[plane curve]] with a bitangent must have degree at least 4. The case of the 28 [[bitangents of a quartic]] was a celebrated piece of geometry of the nineteenth century, a relationship being shown to the 27 lines on the [[cubic surface]].

==Bitangents of polygons==
The four bitangents of two disjoint [[convex polygon]]s may be found efficiently by an algorithm based on [[binary search]] in which one maintains a binary search pointer into the lists of edges of each polygon and moves one of the pointers left or right at each steps depending on where the tangent lines to the edges at the two pointers cross each other. This bitangent calculation is a key subroutine in data structures for maintaining [[convex hull]]s [[dynamic convex hull|dynamically]] {{harv|Overmars|van Leeuwen|1981}}. {{harvs|last1=Pocchiola|last2=Vegter|txt|year=1996a|year2=1996b}} describe an algorithm for efficiently listing all bitangent line segments that do not cross any of the other curves in a system of multiple disjoint convex curves, using a technique based on [[pseudotriangulation]].

Bitangents may be used to speed up the [[visibility graph]] approach to solving the [[Euclidean shortest path]] problem: the shortest path among a collection of polygonal obstacles may only enter or leave the boundary of an obstacle along one of its bitangents, so the shortest path can be found by applying [[Dijkstra's algorithm]] to a [[Glossary of graph theory#Subgraphs|subgraph]] of the visibility graph formed by the visibility edges that lie on bitangent lines {{harv|Rohnert|1986}}.

==Related concepts==
A bitangent differs from a [[secant line]] in that a secant line may cross the curve at the two points it intersects it. One can also consider bitangents that are not lines; for instance, the [[symmetry set]] of a curve is the locus of centers of circles that are tangent to the curve in two points.

[[Tangent lines to two circles|Bitangents to pairs of circles]] figure prominently in [[Jakob Steiner]]'s 1826 construction of the [[Malfatti circles]], in the [[belt problem]] of calculating the length of a belt connecting two pulleys, in [[Casey's theorem]] characterizing sets of four circles with a common tangent circle, and in [[Monge's theorem]] on the collinearity of intersection points of certain bitangents.

Levin Mathematical, Computational Modeling Sciences Center at the same university.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mcmsc.asu.edu/ mcmsc.asu.edu]&lt;/ref&gt;  He is also a former rector at Yachay Tech University in Ecuador.

==Biography==
Castillo-Chavez came to the United States from Mexico in 1974, at the age of 22, and began working at a cheese factory in Wisconsin to support himself. He then returned to his mathematics studies by applying to the [[University of Wisconsin–Stevens Point]], where he graduated in 1976, with dual degrees in math and Spanish literature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ehrweb.aaas.org/mge/Archives/2/chavez.htm ehrweb.aaas.org]&lt;/ref&gt; He continued his MS in Mathematics at [[University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newswise.com/articles/asu-professor-is-appointed-to-committee-on-the-national-medal-of-science-by-president-obama |title=ASU Professor Is Appointed to Committee on the National Medal of Science by President Obama |accessdate=2013-05-11 |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He holds a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in mathematics from the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] (1984).  Prior to moving to [[Arizona State University]] in 2004, he spent 18 years as a professor at [[Cornell University]].  He has published scientific articles and books, and served on panels and committees for organizations such as the [[National Science Foundation]], the [[Alfred P. Sloan Foundation]], the [[National Institutes of Health]], [[Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics]], and the [[American Mathematical Society]].&lt;ref name="titleCarlos Castillo-Chavez" /&gt;

His research interests as a mathematical [[epidemiology|epidemiologist]] relate to the mechanisms underlying the spread of disease, and their containment (prevention of spread) and elimination. A 2006  editorial at Arizona State University, a year after his arrival there, described him as one of the most prominent [[mathematician]]s in the country, an expert in [[Mathematical modelling of infectious disease|epidemiological modelling]], and among the top research contributors to literature on the progression of diseases.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asu.edu/news/stories/200603/20060323_regents_chavez.htm asu.edu],  Regents' Professor: Carlos Castillo-Chavez&lt;/ref&gt;  He is acclaimed for his work on enhancing prospects for academic success and providing research opportunities for underrepresented groups in mathematics and biology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaas.org/aboutaaas/awards/mentor/mentor2007.shtml AAAS Mentor Award] announcement&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Collaborative Diffusion''' is a type of [[pathfinding]] algorithm which uses the concept of ''antiobjects'', objects within a computer program that function opposite to what would be conventionally expected. Collaborative Diffusion is typically used in video games, when multiple agents must path towards a single target agent. For example, the ghosts in [[Pac-Man]]. In this case, the background tiles serve as antiobjects, carrying out the necessary calculations for creating a path and having the foreground objects react accordingly, whereas having foreground objects be responsible for their own pathing would be conventionally expected.

Collaborative Diffusion is favored for its efficiency over other pathfinding algorithms, such as [[A* search algorithm|A*]], when handling multiple agents. Also, this method allows elements of competition and teamwork to easily be incorporated between tracking agents. Notably, the time taken to calculate paths remains constant as the number of agents increases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Repenning|first1=Alexander|title=Collaborative Diffusion: Programming Antiobjects|url=http://www.cs.colorado.edu/~ralex/papers/PDF/OOPSLA06antiobjects.pdf|publisher=AgentSheets Inc &amp; University of Colorado|accessdate=25 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32231">'''Combinatorial design theory''' is the part of [[combinatorics|combinatorial]] [[mathematics]] that deals with the existence,  construction and properties of [[set system|systems of finite sets]] whose arrangements satisfy generalized concepts of ''balance'' and/or ''symmetry''. These concepts are not made precise so that a wide range of objects can be thought of as being under the same umbrella. At times this might involve the numerical sizes of set intersections as in [[block design]]s, while at other times it could involve the spatial arrangement of entries in an array as in [[Sudoku|sudoku grids]].

Combinatorial design theory can be applied to the area of [[design of experiments]].  Some of the basic theory of combinatorial designs originated in the statistician [[Ronald Fisher]]'s work on the design of biological experiments. Modern applications are also found in a wide gamut of areas including; [[Finite geometry]], [[Tournament|tournament scheduling]], [[Lottery|lotteries]], [[mathematical biology]], [[Algorithm design|algorithm design and analysis]], [[Computer network|networking]], [[group testing]] and [[cryptography]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stinson|2003|loc=pg.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Example ==
[[File:Fano plane.svg|thumb|The [[Fano plane]]]]

Given a certain number ''n'' of people, is it possible to assign them to sets so that each person is in at least one set, each pair of people is in exactly one set together, every two sets have exactly one person in common, and no set contains everyone, all but one person, or exactly one person? The answer depends on ''n''.

This has a solution only if ''n'' has the form ''q''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''q'' + 1.  It is less simple to prove that a solution exists if ''q'' is a [[prime power]]. It is conjectured that these are the ''only'' solutions. It has been further shown that if a solution exists for ''q'' congruent to 1 or 2 [[modulo operation|mod]] 4, then ''q'' is a sum of two [[square numbers]].  This last result, the [[Bruck–Ryser theorem]], is proved by a combination of constructive methods based on [[finite field]]s and an application of [[quadratic form]]s.

When such a structure does exist, it is called a finite [[projective plane]]; thus showing how [[finite geometry]] and combinatorics intersect. When ''q''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2, the projective plane is called the [[Fano plane]].

== History ==
Combinatorial designs date to antiquity, with the [[Lo Shu Square]] being an early [[magic square]]. One of the earliest datable application of combinatorial design is found in India in the book ''Brhat Samhita'' by Varahamihira, written around 587 AD, for the purpose of making perfumes using 4 substances selected from 16 different substances using a magic square.&lt;ref name="Hayashi"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hayashi |first=Takao | |title=Magic Squares in Indian Mathematics | series=Encyopaedia of the History of Science, Technology, and Medicine in Non-Western Cultures | date=2008 | edition=2 | pages=1252-1259| publisher=Springer | url=https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007%2F978-1-4020-4425-0_9778#howtocite }}&lt;/ref&gt; Combinatorial designs developed along with the general growth of [[combinatorics]] from the 18th century, for example with [[Latin square]]s in the 18th century and [[Steiner system]]s in the 19th century. Designs have also been popular in [[recreational mathematics]], such as [[Kirkman's schoolgirl problem]] (1850), and in practical problems, such as the scheduling of [[round-robin tournament]]s (solution published 1880s). In the 20th century designs were applied to the [[design of experiments]], notably Latin squares, [[finite geometry]], and [[association scheme]]s, yielding the field of [[algebraic statistics]].

== Fundamental combinatorial designs ==

The classical core of the subject of combinatorial designs is built around [[block design|balanced incomplete block designs (BIBDs)]], [[Hadamard matrix|Hadamard matrices and Hadamard designs]], [[block design#Symmetric BIBDs|symmetric BIBDs]], [[Latin square]]s, [[block design#Resolvable 2-designs|resolvable BIBDs]], [[difference set]]s, and pairwise balanced designs (PBDs).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stinson|2003|loc=pg. IX}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other combinatorial designs are related to or have been developed from the study of these fundamental ones.

* A '''balanced incomplete block design''' or BIBD (usually called for short a [[block design]]) is a collection '''''B''''' of ''b'' subsets (called ''blocks'') of a finite set ''X'' of ''v'' elements, such that any element of ''X'' is contained in the same number ''r'' of blocks, every block has the same number ''k'' of elements, and each pair of distinct elements appear together in the same number λ of blocks. BIBDs are also known as ''2-designs'' and are often denoted as  2-(''v'',''k'',λ) designs.  As an example, when λ = 1 and ''b'' = ''v'', we have a [[projective plane]]: ''X'' is the point set of the plane and the blocks are the lines.
* A '''symmetric balanced incomplete block design''' or '''[[block design#Symmetric BIBDs|SBIBD]]''' is a BIBD in which ''v'' &amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp; ''b'' (the number of points equals the number of blocks). They are the single most important and well studied subclass of BIBDs. Projective planes, biplanes and Hadamard 2-designs are all SBIBDs. They are of particular interest since they are the extremal examples of [[Fisher's inequality]] (''b'' ≥ ''v'').
* A '''[[block design#Resolvable 2-designs|resolvable BIBD]]''' is a BIBD whose blocks can be partitioned into sets (called ''parallel classes''), each of which forms a partition of the point set of the BIBD. The set of parallel classes is called a ''resolution'' of the design. A solution of the famous [[15 schoolgirl problem]] is a resolution of a BIBD with ''v'' &amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;15, ''k'' &amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;3 and  λ&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Beth|Jungnickel|Lenz|1986|loc=pg. 40 Example 5.8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A '''[[Latin rectangle]]''' is an ''r''&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;''n'' [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] that has the numbers 1,&amp;nbsp;2,&amp;nbsp;3,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;''n'' as its entries (or any other set of ''n'' distinct symbols) with no number occurring more than once in any row or column where&amp;nbsp;''r''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''n''.  An ''n''&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;''n'' Latin rectangle is called a [[Latin square]]. If ''r''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''n'', then it is possible to append ''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''r'' rows to an ''r''&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;''n'' Latin rectangle to form a Latin square, using [[Hall's marriage theorem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ryser|1963|loc=pg. 52, Theorem 3.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:Two Latin squares of order ''n'' are said to be ''orthogonal'' if the set of all ordered pairs consisting of the corresponding entries in the two squares has ''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; distinct members (all possible ordered pairs occur). A set of Latin squares of the same order forms a set of '''[[orthogonal Latin squares|mutually orthogonal Latin squares (MOLS)]]''' if every pair of Latin squares in the set are orthogonal. There can be at most ''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1 squares in a set of MOLS of order ''n''. A set of ''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1 MOLS of order ''n'' can be used to construct a [[projective plane]] of order ''n'' (and conversely).

* A (''v'', ''k'', λ) '''[[difference set]]''' is a [[subset]] '''D''' of a [[group (mathematics)|group]] '''G''' such that the [[order of a group|order]] of '''G''' is ''v'', the [[cardinality|size]] of '''D''' is ''k'', and every nonidentity element of '''G''' can be expressed as a product ''d''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''d''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; of elements of '''D''' in exactly λ ways (when '''G''' is written with a multiplicative operation).&lt;ref&gt;When the group '''G''' is an abelian group (or written additively) the defining property looks like d&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; –d&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from which the term ''difference set'' comes from.&lt;/ref&gt;

:If '''D''' is a difference set, and ''g'' in '''G''', then ''g'' '''D'''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{''gd'': ''d'' in '''D'''} is also a difference set, and is called a '''translate''' of '''D'''. The set of all translates of a difference set '''D''' forms a [[Block design#Symmetric BIBDs|symmetric block design]]. In such a design there are ''v'' elements and ''v'' blocks. Each block of the design consists of ''k'' points, each point is contained in ''k'' blocks. Any two blocks have exactly λ elements in common and any two points appear together in λ blocks. This SBIBD is called the ''development'' of '''D'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Beth|Jungnickel|Lenz|1986|loc=pg. 262, Theorem 1.6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:In particular, if λ = 1, then the difference set gives rise to a [[projective plane]]. An example of a (7,3,1) difference set in the group &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}/7\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; (an abelian group written additively) is the subset {1,2,4}. The development of this difference set gives the [[Fano plane]].
:Since every difference set gives an SBIBD, the parameter set must satisfy the [[Bruck–Ryser–Chowla theorem]], but not every SBIBD gives a difference set.

* An '''[[Hadamard matrix]]''' of order ''m'' is an ''m'' × ''m'' matrix '''H''' whose entries are ±1 such that '''HH'''&lt;sup&gt;⊤&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;m'''I'''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;, where '''H'''&lt;sup&gt;⊤&lt;/sup&gt; is the transpose of '''H''' and '''I'''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; is the ''m'' × ''m'' identity matrix. An Hadamard matrix can be put into ''standardized form'' (that is, converted to an equivalent Hadamard matrix) where the first row and first column entries are all +1. If the order ''m'' &gt; 2 then ''m'' must be a multiple of 4.

:Given an Hadamard matrix of order 4''a'' in standardized form, remove the first row and first column and convert every −1 to a 0. The resulting 0–1 matrix '''M''' is the [[incidence matrix]] of a symmetric 2&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;(4''a''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1, 2''a''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1, ''a''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1) design called an '''Hadamard 2-design'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stinson|2003|loc=pg. 74, Theorem 4.5}}&lt;/ref&gt; This construction is reversible, and the incidence matrix of a symmetric 2-design with these parameters can be used to form an Hadamard matrix of order 4''a''. When ''a''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2 we obtain the, by now familiar, [[Fano plane]] as an Hadamard 2-design.

* {{anchor|pairwise balanced design}} A '''pairwise balanced design''' (or PBD) is a set ''X'' together with a family of subsets of ''X'' (which need not have the same size and may contain repeats) such that every pair of distinct elements of ''X'' is contained in exactly λ (a positive integer) subsets. The set ''X'' is allowed to be one of the subsets, and if all the subsets are copies of ''X'', the PBD is called ''trivial''. The size of ''X'' is ''v'' and the number of subsets in the family (counted with multiplicity) is ''b''.

:[[Fisher's inequality]] holds for PBDs:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stinson|2003|loc = pg. 193, Theorem 8.20}}&lt;/ref&gt; For any non-trivial PBD, ''v'' ≤ ''b''.

:This result also generalizes the famous [[De Bruijn–Erdős theorem (incidence geometry)|Erdős–De Bruijn theorem]]: For a PBD with ''λ'' = 1 having no blocks of size 1 or size ''v'', ''v'' ≤ ''b'', with equality if and only if the PBD is a [[projective plane]] or a near-pencil.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stinson|2003|loc= pg. 183, Theorem 8.5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other combinatorial designs ==
The ''Handbook of Combinatorial Designs'' {{harv|Colbourn|Dinitz|2007}} has, amongst others, 65 chapters, each devoted to a combinatorial design other than those given above. A partial listing is given below:

* [[Association scheme]]s
* A '''balanced ternary design''' BTD(''V'', ''B''; ''ρ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''ρ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''R''; ''K'', Λ) is an arrangement of ''V'' elements into ''B'' [[multiset]]s (blocks), each of cardinality ''K'' (''K'' ≤ ''V''), satisfying:
# Each element appears ''R'' = ''ρ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + 2''ρ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; times altogether, with multiplicity one in exactly ''ρ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; blocks and multiplicity two in exactly ''ρ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; blocks.
# Every pair of distinct elements appears Λ times (counted with multiplicity); that is, if ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''vb''&lt;/sub&gt; is the multiplicity of the element ''v'' in block ''b'', then for every pair of distinct elements ''v'' and ''w'', &lt;math&gt;\sum_{b=1}^B m_{vb} m_{wb} = \Lambda&lt;/math&gt;.
:For example, one of the only two nonisomorphic BTD(4,8;2,3,8;4,6)s (blocks are columns) is:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Colbourn|Dinitz|2007|loc=pg. 331, Example 2.2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;
:The [[incidence matrix]] of a BTD (where the entries are the multiplicities of the elements in the blocks) can be used to form a ternary error-correcting code analogous to the way binary codes are formed from the incidence matrices of BIBDs.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Colbourn|Dinitz|2007|loc=pg. 331, Remark 2.8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* A '''{{visible anchor|balanced tournament design}}''' of order ''n'' (a BTD(''n'')) is an arrangement of all the distinct unordered pairs of a 2''n''-set ''V'' into an ''n''&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;(2''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1) array such that
# every element of ''V'' appears precisely once in each column, and
# every element of ''V'' appears at most twice in each row.

&lt;/center&gt;
:The columns of a BTD(''n'') provide a [[1-factorization]] of the complete graph on 2''n'' vertices, ''K''&lt;sub&gt;2n&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Colbourn|Dinitz|2007|loc=pg. 333, Remark 3.3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:BTD(''n'')s can be used to schedule [[round-robin tournament]]s: the rows represent the locations, the columns the rounds of play and the entries are the competing players or teams.

* [[Bent function]]s
* [[Costas array]]s
* [[Factorial design]]s
* A '''frequency square''' ('''F'''-square) is a higher order generalization of a [[Latin square]]. Let ''S'' = {''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''s''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''s''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;} be a set of distinct symbols and (λ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, λ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ...,λ&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;) a ''frequency vector'' of positive integers. A ''frequency square'' of order ''n'' is an ''n'' × ''n'' array in which each symbol ''s''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; occurs ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; times, ''i'' = 1,2,...,m, in each row and column.

* '''Hall triple systems''' (HTSs) are [[Steiner system|Steiner triple systems (STSs)]] (but the blocks are called ''lines'') with the property that the substructure generated by two intersecting lines is isomorphic to the [[Projective plane#Affine planes|finite affine plane]] AG(2,3).
:Any affine space AG(''n'',3) gives an example of an HTS. Such an HTS is an ''affine'' HTS. Nonaffine HTSs also exist.
:The number of points of an HTS is 3&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt; for some integer ''m''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;2. Nonaffine HTSs exist for any ''m''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;4 and do not exist for ''m''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2 or 3.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Colbourn|Dinitz|2007|loc=pg. 496, Theorem 28.5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:Every Steiner triple system is equivalent to a Steiner [[quasigroup]] ([[idempotent]], [[commutative]] and satisfying (''xy'')''y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''x'' for all ''x'' and ''y''). A Hall triple system is equivalent to a Steiner quasigroup which is [[distributive property|distributive]], that is, satisfies {{nowrap| a(xy) {{=}} (ax)(ay)}} for all a,x,y in the quasigroup.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Colbourn|Dinitz|2007|loc=pg. 497, Theorem 28.15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Let ''S'' be a set of 2''n'' elements. A '''Howell design''', H(''s'',2''n'') (on symbol set ''S'') is an ''s'' × ''s'' array such that:
# Each cell of the array is either empty or contains an unordered pair from ''S'',
# Each symbol occurs exactly once in each row and column of the array, and
# Every unordered pair of symbols occurs in at most one cell of the array.

:An example of an H(4,6) is

&lt;/center&gt;

:An H(2''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1, 2''n'') is a [[Room square]] of side 2''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1, and thus the Howell designs generalize the concept of Room squares.

:The pairs of symbols in the cells of a Howell design can be thought of as the edges of an ''s'' regular graph on 2''n'' vertices, called the ''underlying graph'' of the Howell design.

:Cyclic Howell designs are used as ''Howell movements'' in duplicate bridge tournaments. The rows of the design represent the rounds, the columns represent the boards, and the diagonals represent the tables.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Colbourn|Dinitz|2007|loc=pg. 503, Remark 29.38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Linear space (geometry)|Linear spaces]]
* An '''(''n'',''k'',''p'',''t'')-lotto design''' is an ''n''-set ''V'' of elements together with a set β of ''k''-element subsets of ''V'' (blocks), so that for any ''p''-subset P of ''V'', there is a block B in β for which |P ∩ B | ≥ ''t''. '''L(''n'',''k'',''p'',''t'')''' denotes the smallest number of blocks in any (''n'',''k'',''p'',''t'')-lotto design. The following is a (7,5,4,3)-lotto design with the smallest possible number of blocks:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Colbourn|Dinitz|2007|loc=pg. 512, Example 32.4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
::{1,2,3,4,7} &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; {1,2,5,6,7} &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; {3,4,5,6,7}.
:Lotto designs model any [[lottery]] that is run in the following way: Individuals purchase ''tickets'' consisting of ''k'' numbers chosen from a set of ''n'' numbers. At a certain point the sale of tickets is stopped and a set of ''p'' numbers is randomly selected from the ''n'' numbers. These are the ''winning numbers''. If any sold ticket contains ''t'' or more of the winning numbers, a prize is given to the ticket holder. Larger prizes go to tickets with more matches. The value of L(''n'',''k'',''p'',''t'') is of interest to both gamblers and researchers, as this is the smallest number of tickets that are needed to be purchased in order to guarantee a prize.

:The Hungarian Lottery is a (90,5,5,''t'')-lotto design and it is known that L(90,5,5,2) = 100. Lotteries with parameters (49,6,6,''t'') are also popular worldwide and it is known that L(49,6,6,2) = 19. In general though, these numbers are hard to calculate and remain unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Colbourn|Dinitz|2007|loc=pg. 512, Remark 32.3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:A geometric construction of one such design is given in [[Transylvanian lottery]].

* [[Magic square]]s
* A '''(''v'',''k'',''λ'')-Mendelsohn design''', or MD(''v'',''k'',''λ''),is a ''v''-set ''V'' and a collection β of ordered ''k''-tuples of distinct elements of ''V'' (called ''blocks''), such that each ordered pair (''x'',''y'') with ''x'' ≠ ''y'' of elements of ''V'' is cyclically adjacent in ''λ'' blocks. The ordered pair (''x'',''y'') of distinct elements is ''cyclically adjacent'' in a block if the elements appear in the block as (...,''x'',''y'',...) or (''y'',...,''x''). An MD(''v'',3,''λ'') is a '''Mendelsohn triple system''', MTS(''v'',''λ''). An example of an MTS(4,1) on V = {0,1,2,3} is:
:: (0,1,2) &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; (1,0,3) &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; (2,1,3) &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; (0,2,3)
:Any triple system can be made into a Mendelson triple system by replacing the unordered triple {''a'',''b'',''c''} with the pair of ordered triples (''a'',''b'',''c'') and (''a'',''c'',''b''), but as the example shows, the converse of this statement is not true.
:If (''Q'',∗) is an idempotent semisymmetric [[quasigroup]], that is, ''x'' ∗ ''x'' = ''x'' (idempotent) and ''x'' ∗ (''y'' ∗ ''x'') = ''y'' (semisymmetric) for all ''x'', ''y'' in ''Q'', let β = {(''x'',''y'',''x'' ∗ ''y''): ''x'', ''y'' in ''Q''}. Then (''Q'', β) is a Mendelsohn triple system MTS(|''Q''|,1). This construction is reversible.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Colbourn|Dinitz|2007|loc=pg. 530, Theorem 35.15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Orthogonal array]]s
* A '''quasi-3 design''' is a symmetric design (SBIBD) in which each triple of blocks intersect in either ''x'' or ''y'' points, for fixed ''x'' and ''y'' called the ''triple intersection numbers'' (''x'' &lt; ''y''). Any symmetric design with ''λ'' ≤ 2 is a quasi-3 design with ''x''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 and ''y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1. The point-hyperplane design of [[Projective geometry|'''PG'''(''n'',''q'')]] is a quasi-3 design with ''x''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(''q''&lt;sup&gt;''n''−2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1)/(''q''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1) and ''y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''λ''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(''q''&lt;sup&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1)/(''q''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1). If ''y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''λ'' for a quasi-3 design, the design is isomorphic to '''PG'''(''n'',''q'') or a [[projective plane]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Colbourn|Dinitz|2007|loc=pg. 577, Theorem 47.15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A ''t''-(''v'',''k'',''λ'') design ''D'' is '''quasi-symmetric''' with intersection numbers ''x'' and ''y'' (''x'' &lt; ''y'') if every two distinct blocks intersect in either ''x'' or ''y'' points. These designs naturally arise in the investigation of the duals of designs with ''λ'' = 1. A non-symmetric (''b'' &gt; ''v'') 2-(''v'',''k'',1) design is quasisymmetric with ''x'' = 0 and ''y'' = 1. A multiple (repeat all blocks a certain number of times) of a symmetric 2-(''v'',''k'',''λ'') design is quasisymmetric with ''x'' = ''λ'' and ''y'' = ''k''. Hadamard 3-designs (extensions of [[Block design#Symmetric designs|Hadamard 2-designs]]) are quasisymmetric.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Colbourn|Dinitz|2007|loc=pp. 578-579}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:Every quasisymmetric block design gives rise to a [[strongly regular graph]] (as its block graph), but not all SRGs arise in this way.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Colbourn|Dinitz|2007|loc=pg. 579, Theorem 48.10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:The [[incidence matrix]] of a quasisymmetric 2-(''v'',''k'',''λ'') design with ''k'' ≡ ''x'' ≡ ''y'' (mod 2) generates a binary self-orthogonal [[Error-correcting code|code]] (when bordered if ''k'' is odd).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Colbourn|Dinitz|2007|loc=pg. 580, Lemma 48.22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Room square]]s
* A '''[[spherical design]]''' is a finite set ''X'' of points in a (''d''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1)-dimensional [[sphere]] such that, for some integer ''t'', the average value on ''X'' of every polynomial

::&lt;math&gt;f(x_1, \ldots, x_d)\ &lt;/math&gt;

:of total degree at most ''t'' is equal to the average value of ''f'' on the whole sphere, i.e., the [[integral]] of ''f'' divided by the area of the sphere.
* [[Turán system]]s
* An '''''r'' × ''n'' tuscan-''k'' rectangle''' on ''n'' symbols has ''r'' rows and ''n'' columns such that:
# each row is a permutation of the ''n'' symbols and
# for any two distinct symbols ''a'' and ''b'' and for each ''m'' from 1 to ''k'', there is at most one row in which ''b'' is ''m'' steps to the right of ''a''.
: If ''r'' = ''n'' and ''k'' = 1 these are referred to as '''Tuscan squares''', while if ''r'' = ''n'' and ''k'' = ''n'' - 1 they are '''Florentine squares'''. A '''Roman square''' is a tuscan square which is also a [[latin square]] (these are also known as ''row complete latin squares''). A '''Vatican square''' is a florentine square which is also a latin square.

: The following example is a tuscan-1 square on 7 symbols which is not tuscan-2:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Colbourn|Dinitz|2007|loc=pg. 652, Examples 62.4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:In a sequence of visual impressions, one flash card may have some effect on the impression given by the next. This bias can be cancelled by using ''n'' sequences corresponding to the rows of an ''n'' × ''n'' tuscan-1 square.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Colbourn|Dinitz|2007|loc=pg. 657, Remark 62.29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* A '''t-wise balanced design''' (or ''t'' BD) of type ''t''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;(''v'',K,''λ'') is a ''v''-set ''X'' together with a family of subsets of ''X'' (called ''blocks'') whose sizes are in the set K, such that every ''t''-subset of distinct elements of ''X'' is contained in exactly ''λ'' blocks. If K is a set of positive integers strictly between ''t'' and ''v'', then the ''t'' BD is ''proper''. If all the ''k''-subsets of ''X'' for some ''k'' are blocks, the ''t'' BD is a ''trivial design''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Colbourn|Dinitz|2007|loc=pg. 657}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Computational particle physics''' refers to the methods and computing tools developed in and used by  [[particle physics]] research. Like [[computational chemistry]] or [[computational biology]], it is, for [[particle physics]] both a specific branch and an interdisciplinary field relying on computer science, theoretical and experimental particle physics and mathematics.
The main fields of computational particle physics are: [[lattice field theory]] (numerical computations), [[automatic calculation of particle interaction or decay]] (computer algebra) and [[event generator]]s (stochastic methods).

==Computing tools==
* [[Computer algebra]]: Many of the computer algebra languages were developed initially to help particle physics calculations: [[Reduce (computer algebra system)|Reduce]], [[Mathematica]], [[Schoonschip]], [[Form (computer algebra system)|Form]], [[GiNaC]].&lt;ref&gt;''Stefan Weinzierl:- [http://cdsweb.cern.ch/record/582375/files/0209234.ps.gz "Computer Algebra in Particle Physics."]  pgs 5-7.

* [http://eu-datagrid.web.cern.ch/eu-datagrid/ Data Grid]: The largest planned use of the [[Grid computing|grid systems]] will be for the analysis of the [[LHC]] - produced data. Large software packages have been developed to support this application like the [[LHC Computing Grid|LHC Computing Grid (LCG)]] .

* Software Libraries: Many [[software libraries]] are used for particle physics computations. Examples include [[FreeHEP]], [[CLHEP]]. Also important are packages that simulate particle physics interactions using [[Monte Carlo simulation]] techniques (i.e. event generators). Prominent examples of these include [[PYTHIA]], [[Geant4]] and its Fortran predecessor, [[GEANT (program)|GEANT]].

==History==

Particle physics played a role in the early history of the internet, the [[World-Wide Web]] was created by [[Tim Berners-Lee]] when working at CERN in 1991.

=== Computer Algebra ===
Note: This section contains an excerpt from 'Computer Algebra in Particle Physics' by Stefan Weinzierl

Particle physics is an important field of application for computer algebra and exploits the capabilities of Computer Algebra Systems (CAS). This leads to valuable feed-back for the development of CAS. Looking at the history of [[computer algebra systems]], the first programs date back to the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;''Stefan Weinzierl, [[Computational particle physics#cite note-1|op. cit.]] :  pgs 3-5.''&lt;/ref&gt; The first systems were almost entirely based on [[LISP| LISP ("LISt Programming language")]]. LISP is an [[interpreted language]] and, as the name already indicates, designed for the manipulation of [[List (abstract data type)|lists]]. Its importance for [[symbolic computing|symbolic computer programs]] in the early days has been compared to the importance of FORTRAN for numerical programs in the same period.&lt;ref&gt;''Stefan Weinzierl, [[Computational particle physics#cite note-1|op. cit.]] :  pgs 3-5.''&lt;/ref&gt; Already in this first period, the program [[REDUCE]] had some special features for the application to high energy physics. An exception to the LISP-based programs was [[SCHOONSHIP]], written in [[assembler language]] by [[Martinus J. G. Veltman]] and specially designed for applications in particle physics. The use of assembler code lead to an incredible fast program (compared to the interpreted programs at that time) and allowed the calculation of more complex [[scattering]] processes in high energy physics. It has been claimed the program's importance was recognized in 1998 by awarding the half of the Nobel prize to Veltman.&lt;ref&gt;''Stefan Weinzierl, [[Computational particle physics#cite note-1|op. cit.]] :  pgs 3-5.''&lt;/ref&gt; Also the program [[MACSYMA]]  deserves to be mentioned explicitly, since it triggered important development with regard to algorithms. In the 1980s new computer algebra systems started to be written in [[C (programming language)|C]]. This enabled the better exploitation of the [[computer memory|resources]] of the computer (compared to the interpreted language LISP) and at the same time allowed to maintain [[Software portability|portability]] (which would not have been possible in assembler language). This period marked also the appearance of the first commercial computer algebra system, among which Mathematica and [[Maple (software)|Maple]]  are the best known examples. In addition, also a few dedicated programs appeared, an example relevant to particle physics is the program FORM by J. Vermaseren as a (portable) successor to SCHOONSHIP. More recently issues of the [[software maintenance|maintainability]] of large projects became more and more important and the overall [[programming paradigm]]a changed from [[procedural programming]] to [[object-oriented]] design. In terms of programming languages this was reflected by a move from C to [[C++]]. Following this change of paradigma, the library GiNaC was developed. The GiNac library allows symbolic calculations in C++. 

[[Automatic_programming#Implementations|Code generation for computer algebra]] can also be used in this area.

=== Lattice field theory ===

[[Lattice field theory]] was created by [[Kenneth G. Wilson|Kenneth Wilson]] in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;'' Kenneth G. Wilson, Confinement of quarks, Physical Review D, 10, 1974, p. 2445–59 ''&lt;/ref&gt; Simulation techniques were later developed from statistical mechanics.&lt;ref&gt;'' David J. E. Callaway and Aneesur Rahman (1982). "Microcanonical Ensemble Formulation of Lattice Gauge Theory". Physical Review Letters 49 (9): 613–616. Bibcode 1982PhRvL..49..613C. doi:10.1103/PhysRevLett.49.613.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'' David J. E. Callaway and Aneesur Rahman (1983). "Lattice gauge theory in the microcanonical ensemble". Physical Review D28 (6): 1506–1514. Bibcode 1983PhRvD..28.1506C. doi:10.1103/PhysRevD.28.1506. ''&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the early 1980s, LQCD researchers have pioneered the use of [[massively parallel]] computers in large scientific applications, using virtually all available computing systems including traditional main-frames, large [[computer cluster|PC clusters]], and high-performance systems. In addition, it has also been used as a [[Benchmark (computing)|benchmark]] for [[high-performance computing]], starting with the IBM [[Blue Gene]] supercomputer.

Eventually national and regional QCD grids were created: LATFOR (continental Europe), UKQCD and USQCD. The ILDG (International Lattice Data Grid) is an international venture comprising grids from the UK, the US, Australia, Japan and Germany, and was formed in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;'' C.M. Maynard: International Lattice Data Grid: Turn on, plug in, and download. Ch.2, pg. 3. arXiv:1001.5207, 2010. ''&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3807">The '''Davis–Putnam algorithm''' was developed by [[Martin Davis]] and [[Hilary Putnam]] for checking the validity of a [[first-order logic]] formula using a [[Resolution (logic)|resolution]]-based decision procedure for [[propositional logic]]. Since the set of valid first-order formulas is [[recursively enumerable]] but not [[Recursive set|recursive]], there exists no general algorithm to solve this problem. Therefore, the Davis–Putnam algorithm only terminates on valid formulas. Today, the term "Davis–Putnam algorithm" is often used synonymously with the resolution-based propositional decision procedure that is actually only one of the steps of the original algorithm.

==Overview==
The procedure is based on [[Herbrand's theorem]], which implies that an [[satisfiable|unsatisfiable]] formula has an unsatisfiable [[ground instance]], and on the fact that a formula is valid if and only if its negation is unsatisfiable. Taken together, these facts imply that to prove the validity of ''φ'' it is enough to prove that a ground instance of ''¬φ'' is unsatisfiable. If ''φ'' is not valid, then the search for an unsatisfiable ground instance will not terminate.

The procedure roughly consists of these three parts:
* put the formula in [[prenex]] form and eliminate quantifiers 
* generate all propositional ground instances, one by one
* check if each instance is satisfiable

The last part is probably the most innovative one, and works as follows:

* for every variable in the formula
** for every clause &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; containing the variable and every clause &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; containing the negation of the variable
*** [[Resolution (logic)|resolve]] ''c'' and ''n'' and add the resolvent to the formula
** remove all original clauses containing the variable or its negation

At each step, the intermediate formula generated is [[equisatisfiable]], but possibly not [[Logical equivalence|equivalent]], to the original formula. The resolution step leads to a worst-case exponential blow-up in the size of the formula. 

The [[Davis–Putnam–Logemann–Loveland algorithm]] is a 1962 refinement of the propositional satisfiability step of the Davis–Putnam procedure which requires only a linear amount of memory in the worst case. It still forms the basis for today's (as of 2015) most efficient complete [[SAT solver]]s.

In [[mathematics]], two things are called '''distinct''' if they are not [[Equality (mathematics)|equal]]. In [[physics]] two things are distinct if they cannot be [[Topology|mapped]] to each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Martin, Keye|year=2010|chapter=Chapter 9: Domain Theory and Measurement: 9.6 Forms of Process Evolution|title=New Structures for Physics|series=Volume 813 of Lecture Notes in Physics|editor=Coecke, Bob|location=Heidelberg, Germany|publisher=Springer Verlag|pages=579&amp;ndash;580|isbn=978-3-642-12820-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Example==
A [[quadratic equation]] over the [[complex number]]s has two [[root of a function|root]]s.

The equation

: &lt;math&gt;x^2 - 3x + 2 = 0&lt;/math&gt;

[[Factorization|factors]] as

: &lt;math&gt;(x - 1)(x - 2) = 0&lt;/math&gt;

and thus has as roots ''x'' = 1 and ''x'' = 2.
Since 1 and 2 are not equal, these roots are distinct.

In contrast, the equation:

: &lt;math&gt;x^2 - 2x + 1 = 0&lt;/math&gt;

factors as

: &lt;math&gt;(x - 1)(x - 1) = 0&lt;/math&gt;

and thus has as roots ''x'' = 1 and ''x'' = 1.
Since 1 and 1 are (of course) equal, the roots are not distinct; they ''coincide''.

In other words, the first equation has distinct roots, while the second does not. (In the general theory, the [[discriminant]] is introduced to explain this.)

==Proving distinctness==
In order to [[mathematical proof|prove]] that two things ''x'' and ''y'' are distinct, it often helps to find some [[property (metaphysics)|property]] that one has but not the other.
For a simple example, if for some reason we had any doubt that the roots 1 and 2 in the above example were distinct, then we might prove this by noting that 1 is an [[odd number]] while 2 is [[even number|even]].
This would prove that 1 and 2 are distinct.

Along the same lines, one can prove that ''x'' and ''y'' are distinct by finding some [[function (mathematics)|function]] ''f'' and proving that ''f''(''x'') and ''f''(''y'') are distinct.
This may seem like a simple idea, and it is, but many deep results in mathematics concern when you can prove distinctness by particular methods. For example,

*The [[Hahn–Banach theorem]] says (among other things) that distinct elements of a [[Banach space]] can be proved to be distinct using only [[linear functional]]s.
*In [[category theory]], if ''f'' is a [[functor]] between [[Category (mathematics)|categories]] '''C''' and '''D''', then ''f'' always maps [[morphism|isomorphic]] objects to isomorphic objects. Thus, one way to show two objects of '''C''' are distinct ([[up to]] [[isomorphism]]) is to show that their images under ''f'' are distinct (i.e. not isomorphic).
&lt;!--''I don't know what to say here, but there are issues. I can mention [[Leibniz's law]] (which we don't have an article on); this is the claim that distinct things can always be proved distinct as in the last section by some property. These ideas could be discussed under [[Identity (mathematics)|Identity]]. There is some discussion at [[Identity and change]].''

If the base ring ''R'' is a field, then a dual module is a [[dual vector space]].

Every module has a [[canonical homomorphism]] to the dual of its dual (called the '''double dual'''). A [[reflexive module]] is one for which the canonical homomorphism is an [[isomorphism]]. A [[torsionless module]] is one for which the canonical homomorphism is [[injective function|injective]].

'''Example''': If &lt;math&gt;G = \operatorname{Spec}(A)&lt;/math&gt; is a finite commutative group scheme represented by a [[Hopf algebra]] ''A'' over a commutative ring ''k'', then the [[Cartier dual]] &lt;math&gt;G^D&lt;/math&gt; is the Spec of the dual ''k''-module of ''A''.

In the mathematical field of [[model theory]], the '''elementary diagram''' of a [[structure (mathematical logic)|structure]] is the set of all sentences with parameters from the structure that are true in the structure. It is also called the '''complete diagram'''.

== Definition ==

Let ''M'' be a structure in a [[first-order language]] ''L''. An extended language ''L''(''M'') is obtained by adding to ''L'' a constant symbol ''c''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt; for every element ''a'' of ''M''. The structure ''M'' can be viewed as an ''L''(''M'') structure in which the symbols in ''L'' are interpreted as before, and each new constant ''c''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt; is interpreted as the element ''a''. The elementary diagram of ''M'' is the set of all ''L''(''M'') sentences that are true in ''M'' (Marker 2002:44).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5183">In [[actuarial science]], '''force of mortality''' represents the instantaneous [[Mortality rate|rate of mortality]] at a certain age measured on an annualized basis. It is identical in concept to [[failure rate]], also called [[hazard function]], in [[reliability theory]].

==Motivation and definition==

In a [[life table]], we consider the probability of a person dying from age ''x'' to ''x'' + 1, called ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;. In the continuous case, we could also consider the [[conditional probability]] of a person who has attained age (''x'') dying between ages ''x'' and ''x'' + ''Δx'', which is

:&lt;math&gt;P_{x}(\Delta x)=P(x&lt;X&lt;x+\Delta\;x\mid\;X&gt;x)=\frac{F_X(x+\Delta\;x)-F_X(x)}{(1-F_X(x))}&lt;/math&gt;

where F&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;(x) is the [[cumulative distribution function]] of the continuous age-at-death [[random variable]], X. As ''Δx'' tends to zero, so does this probability in the continuous case. The approximate force of mortality is this probability divided by ''Δx''. If we let ''Δx'' tend to zero, we get the function for '''force of mortality''', denoted by &lt;math&gt;\mu(x)&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;\mu\,(x)= \lim_{\Delta x \rightarrow 0} \frac{F_X(x+\Delta\;x)-F_X(x)}{\Delta x (1-F_X(x))} = \frac{F'_X(x)}{1-F_X(x)}&lt;/math&gt;

Since ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'')=''F'' '&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') is the probability density function of ''X'', and ''S''(''x'') = 1 - ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') is the [[survival function]], the force of mortality can also be expressed variously as:

:&lt;math&gt;\mu\,(x)=\frac{f_X(x)}{1-F_X(x)}=-\frac{S'(x)}{S(x)}=-{\frac{d}{dx}}\ln[S(x)].&lt;/math&gt;

To understand conceptually how the force of mortality operates within a population, consider that the ages, ''x'', where the probability density function ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') is zero, there is no chance of dying. Thus the force of mortality at these ages is zero. The force of mortality ''μ''(''x'') uniquely defines a probability density function ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'').

The force of mortality &lt;math&gt;\mu(x)&lt;/math&gt; can be interpreted as the ''conditional'' density of failure at age ''x'', while ''f''(''x'') is the ''unconditional'' density of failure at age ''x''.&lt;ref name=MQR&gt;R. Cunningham, T. Herzog, R. London (2008). ''Models for Quantifying Risk, 3rd Edition'', Actex.&lt;/ref&gt; The unconditional density of failure at age ''x'' is the product of the probability of survival to age ''x'', and the conditional density of failure at age ''x'', given survival to age ''x''.

This is expressed in symbols as

:&lt;math&gt;\,\mu(x)S(x) = f_X(x)&lt;/math&gt;

or equivalently

:&lt;math&gt;\mu(x) = \frac{f_X(x)}{S(x)}.&lt;/math&gt;

In many instances, it is also desirable to determine the survival probability function when the force of mortality is known. To do this, integrate the force of mortality over the interval ''x'' to ''x + t''

:&lt;math&gt; \int_{x}^{x+t} -\frac{d}{dy} \ln[S(y)]\, dy &lt;/math&gt;.

By the fundamental theorem of calculus, this is simply

:&lt;math&gt; \ln[S(x + t)] - \ln[S(x)], &lt;/math&gt;

and taking the exponent to the base ''e'' results in

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{S(x+t)}{S(x)} = S_x(t). &lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, the survival probability of an individual of age ''x'' is written in terms of the force of mortality as

:&lt;math&gt; S_x(t) = e^{-\int_x^{x+t}\mu(y)\, dy\,}. &lt;/math&gt;

==Examples==
* The simplest example is when the force of mortality is constant:

:&lt;math&gt;\mu(y) = \lambda,&lt;/math&gt;

:then the survival function is 

:&lt;math&gt;S_x(t) = e^{-\int_x^{x+t} \lambda dy} = e^{-\lambda t},&lt;/math&gt;

:is the exponential distribution.

* When the force of mortality is 

:&lt;math&gt;\mu(y) = \frac{y^{\alpha-1} e^{-y}}{\Gamma(\alpha) - \gamma(\alpha, y)}, &lt;/math&gt;

:where γ(α,y) is the lower incomplete gamma function, the probability density function that of Gamma distribution

:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = \frac{x^{\alpha - 1} e^{-x}}{\Gamma(\alpha)}.&lt;/math&gt;

* When the force of mortality is 

:&lt;math&gt; \mu(y) = \alpha \lambda^\alpha y^{\alpha-1},&lt;/math&gt;

:where α ≥ 0, we have 

:&lt;math&gt;\int_x^{x+t}\mu(y) dy = \alpha \lambda^\alpha \int_x^{x+t} y^{\alpha-1} dy = \lambda^\alpha( (x+t)^\alpha - x^\alpha).&lt;/math&gt;

:Thus, the survival function is 

:&lt;math&gt;S_x(t) = e^{-\int_x^{x+t}\mu(y) dy} = A(x) e^{ - (\lambda (x+t))^\alpha }, &lt;/math&gt;

:where &lt;math&gt;A(x) = e^{(\lambda x)^{\alpha}}.&lt;/math&gt; This is the survival function for [[Weibull distribution]]. For α = 1, it is same as the exponential distribution.

* Another famous example is when the survival model follows [[Gompertz–Makeham law of mortality]].&lt;ref&gt;Dickson, David C.M., Cambridge (2009). ''Actuarial Mathematics for Life Contingent Risks, First Edition'', Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, the force of mortality is

:&lt;math&gt;\mu(y) = A + Bc^{y} \quad\text{for } y \geqslant 0.&lt;/math&gt;

:Using the last formula, we have

:&lt;math&gt;\int_x^{x+t} (A + Bc^{y}) dy = At + B(c^{x+t}-c^{x})/\ln[c].&lt;/math&gt;

:Then

:&lt;math&gt;S_x(t) = e^{-(At + B(c^{x+t}-c^{x})/\ln[c])} = e^{-At} g^{c^{x} (c^{t}-1)} &lt;/math&gt;

:where &lt;math&gt;g=e^{-B/\ln[c]}.&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="82270">The terminology of algebraic geometry changed drastically during the twentieth century, with the introduction of the general methods, initiated by [[David Hilbert]] and the [[Italian school of algebraic geometry]] in the beginning of the century, and later formalized by [[André Weil]], [[Jean-Pierre Serre]] and [[Alexander Grothendieck]]. Much of the classical terminology, mainly based on case study, was simply abandoned, with the result that books and papers written before this time can be hard to read. This article lists some of this classical terminology, and describes some of the changes in conventions.

{{harvs|txt|last=Dolgachev|year=2012}} translates many of the classical terms in algebraic geometry into scheme-theoretic terminology. Other books defining some of the classical terminology include {{harvtxt|Baker|1922}}, {{harvtxt|Coolidge|1931}}, {{harvtxt|Coxeter|1969}}, {{harvtxt|Hudson|1990}}, {{harvtxt|Salmon|1879}}, {{harvtxt|Semple|Roth|1949}}.

quote=On the other hand, while most of the material treated in the book exists in classical treatises in algebraic geometry, their somewhat archaic terminology and what is by now completely forgotten background knowledge makes these books useful to but a handful of experts in the classical literature.
| source={{harv|Dolgachev|2012|loc=p.iii–iv}}
}}

The change in terminology from around 1948 to 1960 is not the only difficulty in understanding classical algebraic geometry. There was also a lot of background knowledge and assumptions, much of which has now changed. This section lists some of these changes.

* In classical algebraic geometry, adjectives were often used as nouns: for example, "quartic" could also be short for "quartic curve" or "quartic surface".
* In classical algebraic geometry, all curves, surfaces, varieties, and so on came with fixed embeddings into projective space, whereas in scheme theory they are more often considered as abstract varieties. For example, a [[Veronese surface]] was not just a copy of the projective plane, but a copy of the projective plane together with an embedding into projective 5-space.
* Varieties were often considered only up to birational isomorphism, whereas in scheme theory they are usually considered up to biregular isomorphism. {{harv|Semple|Roth|1949|loc=p.20–21}}
* Until circa 1950, many of the proofs in classical algebraic geometry were incomplete (or occasionally just wrong). In particular authors often did not bother to check degenerate cases.
* Words (such as azygetic or bifid) were sometimes formed from Latin or Greek roots without further explanation, assuming that readers would use their [[Classics|classical education]] to figure out the meaning.

{{quotebox|width=30%|align=right
| quote=...we refer to a certain degree of informality of language, sacrificing precision to brevity, ..., and which has long characterized most geometrical writing. ...[The meaning] depends always on the context and is invariably assumed to be capable of unambiguous interpretation by the reader.
| source={{harv|Semple|Roth|1949|loc=p.iii}} }}

* Definitions in classical algebraic geometry were often somewhat vague, and it is futile to try to find the precise meaning of some of the older terms because many of them never had a precise meaning. In practice this did not matter much when the terms were only used to describe particular examples, as in these cases their meaning was usually clear: for example, it was obvious what the 16 tropes of a [[Kummer surface]] were, even if "trope" was not precisely defined in general.
* Algebraic geometry was often implicitly done over the complex numbers (or sometimes the real numbers).
* Readers were often assumed to know classical (or synthetic) projective geometry, and in particular to have a thorough knowledge of conics, and authors would use terminology from this area without further explanation.
* Several terms, such as "Abelian group", "complete", "complex", "flat", "harmonic", "homology", "monoid", "normal", "pole", "regular", now have meanings that are unrelated to their original meanings. Other terms, such as "circle", have their meanings tacitly changed to work in complex projective space; for example, a circle in complex algebraic geometry is a conic passing through the circular points at infinity and has underlying topological space a 2-sphere rather than a 1-sphere.
* Sometimes capital letters are tacitly understood to stand for points, and small letters for lines or curves.

{{Redirect|high-level||High level (disambiguation){{!}}High level}}
'''High-level''' and '''low-level''', as technical terms, are used to classify, describe and point to specific [[Objective (goal)|goal]]s of a systematic operation; and are applied in a wide range of contexts, such as, for instance, in domains as widely varied as [[computer science]] and [[business administration]].

'''High-level''' describe those operations that are more [[abstraction|abstract]] in nature; wherein the overall goals and systemic features are typically more concerned with the wider, macro system as a whole.

'''Low-level''' describes more specific individual components of a systematic operation, focusing on the details of rudimentary micro functions rather than macro, complex processes. Low-level classification is typically more concerned with individual components within the system and how they operate.

Features which emerge only at a high level of description are known as [[epiphenomenon|epiphenomena]].

==Differences and similarities==
Due to the nature of [[complex systems]], the high-level description will often be completely different from the low level one; and, therefore, the (different) descriptions that each deliver are consequent upon the level at which each (differently) direct their study. For example,
* there are features of an [[ant colony]] that are not features of any individual [[ant]];
* there are features of the human [[mind]] that are not known to be descriptive of individual [[neuron]]s in the [[brain]];
* there are features of [[ocean]]s which are not features of any individual [[water molecule]]; and
* there are features of a human [[personality]] that are not features of any [[cell (biology)|cell]] in a body.

==Uses==
* In computer science, software are typically divided into two types: '''high-level''' end-user applications software (such as word processors, databases, video games, etc.), and '''low-level''' systems software (such as operation systems, hardware drivers, etc.).&lt;br&gt;As such, '''high-level''' applications typically rely on '''low-level''' applications to function.&lt;br&gt;In terms of programming, a [[high-level programming language]] is one which has a relatively high level of abstraction, and manipulates conceptual functions in a structured manner.&lt;br&gt;A [[low-level programming language]] is one like [[assembly language]] that contains rudimentary [[microprocessor]] commands.
* In [[formal methods]], a high-level [[formal specification]] can be related to a low-level executable [[implementation]] (e.g., formally by [[mathematical proof]] using [[formal verification]] techniques).
* In [[sociology]] and [[social anthropology]], high-level descriptions would be terms like [[economy]] and [[politics|political structure]], and low level descriptions would be individual peoples' motivations and work.
* In neuroscience, low-level would relate to the functioning of a cell (or part of a cell, or molecule) and high level to the overall function or activity of a neural system.
* In documentation, a [[high-level document]] contains the [[executive summary]], the [[low-level document]]s the technical specifications.
* In business, [[corporate strategy]] is a high-level description, a list of who does what jobs is a low level description.

==Examples==
* ''[[Climate]]'' is a high-level description of the actions of the [[atmosphere]] and [[ocean]]s. [[Physics]] of [[water]] and [[gas]] molecules is a low-level description of the same system.
* The instruction "write a creative poem on love" is a high-level instruction. The instruction "tighten the [[tendon]]s in the [[Handedness|dominant]] [[wrist]] to grip the [[pen]]" is a low-level description of an activity within that.
* ''"Wikipedia is an encyclopedia"'' is a high-level description compared to ''"Wikipedia is a collection of textual articles on many topics"''. The former reflects a higher level view of organization, purpose, concept and structure, but does not explain what Wikipedia physically ''is''. The latter is more detailed as to what exactly Wikipedia contains and how it's made up, but doesn't explain what its overall purpose and goals are. These are typical features of high-level and low-level descriptions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4981">'''Hilbert's twentieth problem''' is one of the 23 [[Hilbert problems]] set out in a celebrated list compiled in 1900 by [[David Hilbert]].  It asks whether all [[boundary value problem]]s can be solved (that is, do [[calculus of variations|variational problems]] with certain [[boundary condition]]s have solutions).

==Introduction==
Hilbert noted that there existed methods for solving partial differential equations where the function's values were given at the boundary, but the problem asked for methods for solving partial differential equations with more complicated conditions on the boundary (e.g., involving derivatives of the function), or for solving calculus of variation problems in more than 1 dimension (for example, minimal surface problems or minimal curvature problems)

==Problem statement==
The original problem statement in its entirety is as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
An important problem closely connected with the foregoing [referring to [[Hilbert's nineteenth problem]]] is the question concerning the existence of solutions of partial differential equations when the values on the boundary of the region are prescribed. This problem is solved in the main by the keen methods of H. A. Schwarz, C. Neumann, and Poincaré for the differential equation of the potential. These methods, however, seem to be generally not capable of direct extension to the case where along the boundary there are prescribed either the differential coefficients or any relations between these and the values of the function. Nor can they be extended immediately to the case where the inquiry is not for potential surfaces but, say, for surfaces of least area, or surfaces of constant positive gaussian curvature, which are to pass through a prescribed twisted curve or to stretch over a given ring surface. It is my conviction that it will be possible to prove these existence theorems by means of a general principle whose nature is indicated by Dirichlet's principle. This general principle will then perhaps enable us to approach the question: Has not every regular variation problem a solution, provided certain assumptions regarding the given boundary conditions are satisfied (say that the functions concerned in these boundary conditions are continuous and have in sections one or more derivatives), and provided also if need be that the notion of a solution shall be suitably extended?&lt;ref&gt;Hilbert, David, "Mathematische Probleme" [[Göttinger Nachrichten]], (1900), pp. 253-297, and in [[Archiv der Mathematik und Physik]], (3) '''1''' (1901), 44-63 and 213-237. Published in English translation by Dr. Maby Winton Newson, [[Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society]] '''8''' (1902), 437-479 [http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/hilbert/problems.html#prob23] [http://www.ams.org/journals/bull/1902-08-10/S0002-9904-1902-00923-3/S0002-9904-1902-00923-3.pdf] {{doi|10.1090/S0002-9904-1902-00923-3}} .

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Boundary value problems==
{{main|Boundary value problem}}
In the field of [[differential equation]]s, a [[boundary value problem]] is a [[differential equation]] together with a set of additional constraints, called the '''boundary conditions'''. A solution to a boundary value problem is a solution to the differential equation which also satisfies the boundary conditions.

To be useful in applications, a boundary value problem should be [[well-posed problem|well posed]].  This means that given the input to the problem there exists a unique solution, which depends continuously on the input.  Much theoretical work in the field of [[partial differential equation]]s is devoted to proving that boundary value problems arising from scientific and engineering applications are in fact well-posed.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14901">[[Network coding]] has been shown to optimally use [[Bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] in a network, maximizing information flow but the scheme is very inherently vulnerable to pollution attacks by malicious nodes in the network. A node injecting garbage can quickly affect many receivers.  The pollution of [[network packet]]s spreads quickly since the output of (even an) honest node is corrupted if at least one of the incoming packets is corrupted. An attacker can easily corrupt a packet even if it is encrypted by either forging the signature or by producing a collision under the [[hash function]]. This will give an attacker access to the packets and the ability to corrupt them. Denis Charles, Kamal Jain and Kristin Lauter designed a new [[homomorphic encryption]] signature scheme for use with network coding to prevent pollution attacks.&lt;ref&gt;http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.60.4738&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The homomorphic property of the signatures allows nodes to sign any linear combination of the incoming packets without contacting the signing authority. In this scheme it is computationally infeasible for a node to sign a linear combination of the packets without disclosing what [[linear combination]] was used in the generation of the packet. Furthermore, we can prove that the signature scheme is secure under well known [[Cryptography|cryptographic]] assumptions of the hardness of the [[discrete logarithm]] problem and the computational [[Elliptic curve Diffie–Hellman]].

==Network coding==
Let &lt;math&gt;G = (V, E)&lt;/math&gt; be a [[directed graph]] where &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is a set, whose elements are called vertices or [[Node (networking)|node]]s, and &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is a set of [[ordered pair]]s of vertices, called arcs, directed edges, or arrows. A source &lt;math&gt;s \in V&lt;/math&gt; wants to transmit a file &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; to a set &lt;math&gt;T \subseteq V&lt;/math&gt; of the vertices. One chooses a [[vector space]] &lt;math&gt;W/\mathbb{F}_p&lt;/math&gt;(say of dimension &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;), where &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is a prime, and views the data to be transmitted as a bunch of vectors &lt;math&gt;w_1 ,\ldots , w_k \in W&lt;/math&gt;. The source then creates the augmented vectors &lt;math&gt;v_1,\ldots , v_k&lt;/math&gt; by setting &lt;math&gt; v_i = (0, \ldots , 0, 1, \ldots , 0, w_{i_1}, \ldots , w{i_d})&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;w_{i_j}&lt;/math&gt; is the &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;-th coordinate of the vector &lt;math&gt;w_i&lt;/math&gt;. There are &lt;math&gt;(i-1)&lt;/math&gt; zeros before the first '1' appears in &lt;math&gt;v_i&lt;/math&gt;. One can assume without loss of generality that the vectors &lt;math&gt;v_i&lt;/math&gt; are [[Linear independence|linearly independent]]. We denote the [[linear subspace]] (of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{F}_p^{k+d}&lt;/math&gt; ) spanned by these vectors by &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; . Each outgoing edge &lt;math&gt;e \in E&lt;/math&gt; computes a linear combination, &lt;math&gt;y(e)&lt;/math&gt;, of the vectors entering the vertex &lt;math&gt;v = in(e)&lt;/math&gt; where the edge originates, that is to say

: &lt;math&gt;y(e) = \sum_{f:\mathrm{out}(f)=v}(m_e(f)y(f))&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;m_e(f) \in \mathbb{F}_p&lt;/math&gt;. We consider the source as having &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; input edges carrying the &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; vectors &lt;math&gt;w_i&lt;/math&gt;. By [[Mathematical induction|induction]], one has that the vector &lt;math&gt;y(e)&lt;/math&gt; on any edge is a linear combination &lt;math&gt;y(e) = \sum_{1 \le i \le k}(g_i(e)v_i)&lt;/math&gt; and is a vector in &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; . The k-dimensional vector &lt;math&gt;g(e) = (g_1(e), \ldots , g_k(e))&lt;/math&gt; is simply the first ''k'' coordinates of the vector &lt;math&gt;y(e)&lt;/math&gt;. We call the [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] whose rows are the vectors &lt;math&gt;g(e_1), \ldots , g(e_k)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;e_i&lt;/math&gt; are the incoming edges for a vertex &lt;math&gt;t \in T&lt;/math&gt;, the global encoding matrix for &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; and denote it as &lt;math&gt;G_t&lt;/math&gt;. In practice the encoding vectors are chosen at random so the matrix &lt;math&gt;G_t&lt;/math&gt; is invertible with high probability. Thus any receiver, on receiving &lt;math&gt;y_1, \ldots , y_k&lt;/math&gt; can find &lt;math&gt;w_1,\ldots ,w_k&lt;/math&gt; by solving

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix} y'\\ y_2' \\  \vdots \\ y_k' \end{bmatrix} = G_t \begin{bmatrix} w_1\\ w_2 \\ \vdots \\ w_k \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; 

where the &lt;math&gt;y_i'&lt;/math&gt; are the vectors formed by removing the first &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; coordinates of the vector &lt;math&gt;y_i&lt;/math&gt;.

==Decoding at the receiver==
Each [[Receiver (information theory)|receiver]], &lt;math&gt;t \in T&lt;/math&gt;, gets &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; vectors &lt;math&gt;y_1, \ldots , y_k&lt;/math&gt; which are random linear combinations of the &lt;math&gt;v_i&lt;/math&gt;’s.
In fact, if

: &lt;math&gt;y_i = (\alpha_{i_1}, \ldots , \alpha_{i_k}, a_{i_1}, \ldots , a_{i_d})&lt;/math&gt;

then

: &lt;math&gt;y_i = \sum_{1 \le j \le k}(\alpha_{ij}v_j).&lt;/math&gt;

Thus we can invert the linear transformation to find the &lt;math&gt;v_i&lt;/math&gt;’s with high [[probability]].

==History==
Krohn, Freedman and Mazieres proposed a theory&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~mfreed/docs/authcodes-ieee04.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; in 2004 that if we have a hash function 
&lt;math&gt;H : V \longrightarrow G&lt;/math&gt; such that: 
*  &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is [[Collision resistance|collision resistant]] – it is hard to find &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;H(x) = H(y)&lt;/math&gt;;
* &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is a [[homomorphism]] – &lt;math&gt;H(x+y) = H(x) + H(y)&lt;/math&gt;.

Then server can securely distribute &lt;math&gt;H(v_i)&lt;/math&gt; to each receiver, and to check if

: &lt;math&gt;y =   \sum_{1 \leq i\leq k} (\alpha_iv_i)&lt;/math&gt;

we can check whether

: &lt;math&gt;H(y) =    \sum_{1 \leq i\leq k} (\alpha_iH(v_i))&lt;/math&gt;

The problem with this method is that the server needs to transfer secure information to each of the receivers. The hash functions &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; needs to be transmitted to all the nodes in the network through a separate secure channel.&lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is expensive to compute and secure transmission of &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is not economical either.

==Advantages of homomorphic signatures==
# Establishes authentication in addition to detecting pollution.
# No need for distributing secure hash digests.
# Smaller bit lengths in general will suffice. Signatures of length 180 bits have as much security as 1024 bit RSA signatures.
# Public information does not change for subsequent file transmission.

==Signature scheme==
The homomorphic property of the signatures allows nodes to sign any linear combination of the incoming packets without contacting the signing authority.

===Elliptic curves cryptography over a finite field===
[[Elliptic curve cryptography]] over a finite field is an approach to [[public-key cryptography]] based on the algebraic structure of [[elliptic curves]] over [[finite field]]s.

Let &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{F}_q&lt;/math&gt; be a finite field such that &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; is not a power of 2 or 3. Then an elliptic curve &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; over &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{F}_q&lt;/math&gt; is a curve given by an equation of the form
: &lt;math&gt; y^2 = x^3 + ax + b, \, &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;a, b  \in   \mathbb{F}_q&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;4a^3 + 27b^2 \not= 0&lt;/math&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;K \supseteq \mathbb{F}_q&lt;/math&gt;, then,

: &lt;math&gt;E(K) = \{(x, y) | y^2 = x^3 + ax + b\} \bigcup  \{O\}&lt;/math&gt;

forms an [[abelian group]] with O as identity. The [[Group (mathematics)|group operations]] can be performed efficiently.

===Weil pairing===
[[Weil pairing]] is a construction of [[roots of unity]] by means of functions on an [[elliptic curve]] &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;, in such a way as to constitute a [[pairing]] ([[bilinear form]], though with [[multiplicative notation]]) on the [[torsion subgroup]] of &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;E/\mathbb{F}_q&lt;/math&gt; be an elliptic curve and let &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{\bar{F}}_q&lt;/math&gt; be an algebraic closure of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{F}_q&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is an integer, relatively prime to the characteristic of the field &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{F}_q&lt;/math&gt;, then the group of &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;-torsion points,
&lt;math&gt;E[m] = {P \in  E(\mathbb{\bar {F}}_q) : mP = O}&lt;/math&gt;.

If &lt;math&gt;E/\mathbb{F}_q&lt;/math&gt; is an elliptic curve and &lt;math&gt;\gcd(m, q) = 1&lt;/math&gt; then

: &lt;math&gt;E[m] \cong  (\mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z}) * (\mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z})&lt;/math&gt;

There is a map &lt;math&gt;e_m : E[m] * E[m] \rightarrow \mu_m(\mathbb{F}_q)&lt;/math&gt; such that:

#(Bilinear) &lt;math&gt;e_m(P + R,Q) = e_m(P,Q)e_m(R,Q)\text{ and }e_m(P,Q + R) = e_m(P,Q)e_m(P, R)&lt;/math&gt;.
#(Non-degenerate) &lt;math&gt;e_m(P,Q) = 1&lt;/math&gt; for all ''P'' implies that &lt;math&gt;Q = O&lt;/math&gt;.
#(Alternating) &lt;math&gt;e_m(P, P) = 1&lt;/math&gt;.

Also, &lt;math&gt;e_m&lt;/math&gt; can be computed efficiently.&lt;ref&gt;http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.88.8848&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Homomorphic signatures===

Let &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; be a prime and &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; a prime power. Let &lt;math&gt;V/\mathbb{F}_p&lt;/math&gt; be a vector space of dimension &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;E/\mathbb{F}_q&lt;/math&gt; be an elliptic curve such that &lt;math&gt;P_1, \ldots , P_D  \in   E[p]&lt;/math&gt;.
Define &lt;math&gt;h : V \longrightarrow E[p]&lt;/math&gt; as follows:
&lt;math&gt;h(u_1, \ldots , u_D) =   \sum_{1 \leq i\leq D} (u_iP_i)&lt;/math&gt;.
The function &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is an arbitrary homomorphism from &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;E[p]&lt;/math&gt;.

The server chooses &lt;math&gt;s_1, \ldots , s_D&lt;/math&gt; secretly in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{F}_p&lt;/math&gt; and publishes a point &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; of p-torsion such that &lt;math&gt;e_p(P_i,Q) \not=  1&lt;/math&gt; and also publishes  &lt;math&gt;(P_i, s_iQ)&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;1 \leq i \leq D&lt;/math&gt;.
The signature of the vector &lt;math&gt;v = u_1, \ldots , u_D&lt;/math&gt; is 
&lt;math&gt;\sigma(v) =   \sum_{1 \leq i\leq D} (u_is_iP_i)&lt;/math&gt;
Note: This signature is homomorphic since the computation of h is a homomorphism.

===Signature verification===

Given &lt;math&gt;v = u_1, \ldots , u_D&lt;/math&gt; and its signature &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;, verify that

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
e_p(\sigma,Q) &amp; = e_p \left(\sum_{1 \leq i \leq D} (u_i s_i P_i), Q \right) \\
&amp; = \prod_i e_p(u_i s_i P_i,Q) \\ 
&amp; = \prod_i e_p(u_i P_i, s_iQ)
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

The verification crucially uses the bilinearity of the Weil-pairing.

==System setup==
The server computes &lt;math&gt;\sigma(v_i)&lt;/math&gt; for each &lt;math&gt;1 \leq i \leq k&lt;/math&gt;. Transmits &lt;math&gt;v_i, \sigma(v_i)&lt;/math&gt;.
At each edge &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; while computing
&lt;math&gt;y(e) =  \sum_{f \in E:\mathrm{out}(f)=\mathrm{in}(e)} (m_e(f)y(f))&lt;/math&gt;
also compute
&lt;math&gt;\sigma(y(e)) =  \sum_{f \in E:\mathrm{out}(f)=\mathrm{in}(e)} (m_e(f)\sigma(y(f)))&lt;/math&gt;
on the elliptic curve &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;.

The signature is a point on the elliptic curve with coordinates in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{F}_q&lt;/math&gt;. Thus the size of the signature is &lt;math&gt;2 \log q&lt;/math&gt; bits (which is some constant times &lt;math&gt;log(p)&lt;/math&gt; bits, depending on the relative size of &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt;), and this is the transmission overhead. The computation of the signature &lt;math&gt;h(e)&lt;/math&gt; at each vertex requires &lt;math&gt;O(d_{in} \log p \log^{1+\epsilon} q)&lt;/math&gt; bit operations, where &lt;math&gt;d_{in}&lt;/math&gt; is the in-degree of the vertex &lt;math&gt;in(e)&lt;/math&gt;. The verification of a signature requires &lt;math&gt;O((d + k) \log^{2+\epsilon} q)&lt;/math&gt; bit operations.

==Proof of security==

Attacker can produce a collision under the hash function.

If given &lt;math&gt;(P_1, \ldots , P_r)&lt;/math&gt; points in &lt;math&gt;E[p]&lt;/math&gt; find
&lt;math&gt;a = (a_1, \ldots , a_r)  \in  \mathbb{F}_p^r&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b = (b_1, \ldots , b_r)  \in  \mathbb{F}_p^r&lt;/math&gt;

such that &lt;math&gt;a \not= b&lt;/math&gt; and

: &lt;math&gt;\sum_{1 \leq i \leq r} (a_iP_i) = \sum_{1 \leq j \leq r} (b_jP_j).&lt;/math&gt;

Proposition: There is a polynomial time reduction from discrete log on the [[cyclic group]] of order &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; on elliptic curves to Hash-Collision.

If &lt;math&gt;r = 2&lt;/math&gt;, then we get &lt;math&gt;xP+yQ = uP+vQ&lt;/math&gt;. Thus &lt;math&gt;(x-u)P+(y-v)Q = 0&lt;/math&gt;.
We claim that &lt;math&gt;x \not = u&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y \not =  v&lt;/math&gt;. Suppose that &lt;math&gt;x = u&lt;/math&gt;, then we would have &lt;math&gt;(y-v)Q = 0&lt;/math&gt;, but &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; is a point of order &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; (a prime) thus &lt;math&gt;y-u \equiv 0 \bmod p&lt;/math&gt;. In other words &lt;math&gt;y = v&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{F}_p&lt;/math&gt;. This contradicts the assumption that &lt;math&gt;(x, y)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(u, v)&lt;/math&gt; are distinct pairs in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{F}_2&lt;/math&gt;. Thus we have that &lt;math&gt;Q = -(x-u)(y-v)^{-1}P&lt;/math&gt;, where the inverse is taken as modulo &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;.

If we have r &gt; 2 then we can do one of two things. Either we can take &lt;math&gt;P_1 = P&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P_2 = Q&lt;/math&gt; as before and set &lt;math&gt;P_i = O&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; &gt; 2 (in this case the proof reduces to the case when &lt;math&gt;r = 2&lt;/math&gt;), or we can take &lt;math&gt;P_1 = r_1P&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P_i = r_iQ&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;r_i&lt;/math&gt; are chosen at random from &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{F}_p&lt;/math&gt;. We get one equation in one unknown (the discrete log of &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;). It is quite possible that the equation we get does not involve the unknown. However, this happens with very small probability as we argue next. Suppose the algorithm for Hash-Collision gave us that

: &lt;math&gt;ar_1P + \sum_{2 \leq i \leq r}(b_ir_iQ) = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

Then as long as &lt;math&gt;\sum_{2 \leq i \leq r} b_ir_i \not\equiv 0 \bmod p&lt;/math&gt;, we can solve for the discrete log of Q. But the &lt;math&gt;r_i&lt;/math&gt;’s are unknown to the oracle for Hash-Collision and so we can interchange the order in which this process occurs. In other words, given &lt;math&gt;b_i&lt;/math&gt;, for &lt;math&gt;2 \leq i \leq r&lt;/math&gt;, not all zero, what is the probability that the &lt;math&gt;r_i&lt;/math&gt;’s we chose satisfies &lt;math&gt;\sum_{2 \leq i \leq r} (b_ir_i) = 0&lt;/math&gt;? It is clear that the latter probability is &lt;math&gt;1 \over p&lt;/math&gt; . Thus with high probability we can solve for the discrete log of &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;.

We have shown that producing hash collisions in this scheme is difficult. The other method by which an adversary can foil our system is by forging a signature. This scheme for the signature is essentially the Aggregate Signature version of the Boneh-Lynn-Shacham signature scheme.&lt;ref&gt;http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~hovav/dist/sigs.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Here it is shown that forging a signature is at least as hard as solving the [[elliptic curve Diffie–Hellman]] problem. The only known way to solve this problem on elliptic curves is via computing discrete-logs. Thus forging a signature is at least as hard as solving the computational co-Diffie–Hellman on elliptic curves and probably as hard as computing  discrete-logs.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3197">'''Hopf–Rinow theorem''' is a set of statements about the [[Geodesic manifold|geodesic completeness]] of [[Riemannian manifold]]s. It is named after [[Heinz Hopf]] and his student [[Willi Rinow]], who published it in 1931.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hopf |first=H. |last2=Rinow |first2=W. |title=Ueber den Begriff der vollständigen differentialgeometrischen Fläche |journal=[[Commentarii Mathematici Helvetici]] |volume=3 |year=1931 |issue=1 |pages=209–225 |doi=10.1007/BF01601813 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statement of the theorem==
Let (''M'',&amp;nbsp;''g'') be a connected Riemannian manifold. Then the following statements are equivalent:

# The [[Closed set|closed]] and [[bounded set|bounded]] [[subset]]s of ''M'' are [[compact space|compact]];
# ''M'' is  a [[complete space|complete]] [[metric space]];
# ''M'' is geodesically complete; that is, for every ''p'' in ''M'', the [[exponential map (Riemannian geometry)|exponential map]] exp&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; is defined on the entire [[tangent space]] T&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;''M''.

Furthermore, any one of the above implies that given any two points ''p'' and ''q'' in ''M'', there exists a length minimizing [[geodesic]] connecting these two points (geodesics are in general [[critical point (mathematics)|critical points]] for the [[arc length|length]] functional, and may or may not be minima).

==Variations and generalizations==
*The Hopf–Rinow theorem is generalized to [[length-metric space]]s the following way:
*:If a [[length-metric space]] (''M'',&amp;nbsp;''d'') is [[complete space|complete]] and [[locally compact]] then any two points in ''M'' can be connected by a [[geodesic|minimizing geodesic]], and any bounded [[closed sets|closed set]] in ''M'' is [[compact space|compact]].
*The theorem does not hold in infinite dimensions: {{harv|Atkin|1975}} showed that two points in an infinite dimensional complete Hilbert manifold need not be connected by a geodesic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1=Atkin | first1=C. J. | title=The Hopf–Rinow theorem is false in infinite dimensions | mr = 0400283 | year=1975 | journal=The Bulletin of the London Mathematical Society | volume=7 | issue=3 | pages=261–266|url=http://blms.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/7/3/261.pdf | doi=10.1112/blms/7.3.261}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The theorem also does not generalize to [[Lorentzian manifold]]s: the [[Clifton–Pohl torus]] provides an example that is compact but not complete.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Semi-Riemannian Geometry With Applications to Relativity|volume=103|series=Pure and Applied Mathematics|first=Barrett|last=O'Neill|publisher=Academic Press|year=1983|isbn=9780080570570|page=193|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CGk1eRSjFIIC&amp;pg=PA193}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[computer science]] and [[discrete mathematics]] a sequence has an '''inversion''' where two of its elements are out of their natural [[total order|order]].

== Definitions ==

===Inversion===

Let &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; be a [[permutation]].  If &lt;math&gt;i &lt; j&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\pi(i) &gt; \pi(j)&lt;/math&gt;, either the pair of places &lt;math&gt;(i, j)&lt;/math&gt;{{sfn|Aigner|2007|pp=27}}{{sfn|Comtet|1974|pp=237}} or the pair of elements &lt;math&gt;\bigl(\pi(i), \pi(j)\bigr)&lt;/math&gt;{{sfn|Knuth|1973|pp=11}}{{sfn|Pemmaraju|Skiena|2003|pp=69}}{{sfn|Vitter|Flajolet|1990|pp=459}} is called an '''inversion''' of &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt;.

The inversion is usually defined for permutations, but may also be defined for sequences:&lt;br&gt;
Let &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; be a [[sequence]] (or [[multiset]] permutation{{sfn|Bóna|2012|pp=57}}). If &lt;math&gt;i &lt; j&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S(i) &gt; S(j)&lt;/math&gt;, either the pair of places &lt;math&gt;(i, j)&lt;/math&gt;{{sfn|Bóna|2012|pp=57}}{{sfn|Cormen|Leiserson|Rivest|Stein|2001|pp=39}} or the pair of elements &lt;math&gt;\bigl(S(i), S(j)\bigr)&lt;/math&gt;{{sfn|Barth|Mutzel|2004|pp=183}} is called an inversion of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;.

For sequences inversions according to the element-based definition are not unique, because different pairs of places may have the same pair of values.

The '''inversion set''' is the set of all inversions. A permutation's inversion set according to the place-based definition is that of the [[Permutation#Product and inverse|inverse]] permutation's inversion set according to the element-based definition, and vice versa,{{sfn|Gratzer|2016|pp=221}} just with the elements of the pairs exchanged.

===Inversion number===

The '''inversion number''' is the cardinality of inversion set. It is a common measure of the sortedness of a permutation{{sfn|Vitter|Flajolet|1990|pp=459}} or sequence.{{sfn|Barth|Mutzel|2004|pp=183}}

It is the number of crossings in the arrow diagram of the permutation,{{sfn|Gratzer|2016|pp=221}} its [[Kendall tau distance]] from the identity permutation, and the sum of each of the inversion related vectors defined below.

It does not matter if the place-based or the element-based definition of inversion is used to define the inversion number, because a permutation and its inverse have the same number of inversions.

Other measures of (pre-)sortedness include the minimum number of elements that can be deleted from the sequence to yield a fully sorted sequence, the number and lengths of sorted "runs" within the sequence, the Spearman footrule (sum of distances of each element from its sorted position), and the smallest number of exchanges needed to sort the sequence.{{sfn|Mahmoud|2000|pp=284}} Standard [[comparison sort]]ing algorithms can be adapted to compute the inversion number in time {{math|O(''n'' log ''n'')}}.

===Inversion related vectors===

Three similar vectors are in use that condense the inversions of a permutation into a vector that uniquely determines it. They are often called ''inversion vector'' or ''[[Lehmer code]]''. (A list of sources is found [[v:Inversion (discrete mathematics)#Sources|here]].)

This article uses the term ''inversion vector'' (&lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;) like [[Wolfram Mathematica|Wolfram]].&lt;ref&gt;{{MathWorld |title=Inversion Vector}}&lt;/ref&gt; The remaining two vectors are sometimes called ''left'' and ''right inversion vector'', but to avoid confusion with the inversion vector this article calls them  ''left inversion count'' (&lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt;) and ''right inversion count'' (&lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;). Interpreted as a [[factorial number system|factorial number]] the left inversion count gives the permutations reverse colexicographic,&lt;ref&gt;Reverse colex order of finitary permutations {{OEIS|A055089}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the right inversion count gives the lexicographic index.

[[File:Inversion example; Rothe 1.svg|thumb|Rothe diagram]]
'''Inversion vector &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;:'''&lt;br&gt;
With the ''element-based'' definition &lt;math&gt;v(i)&lt;/math&gt; is the number of inversions whose ''smaller'' (right) component is &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;.{{sfn|Knuth|1973|pp=11}}
:&lt;math&gt;v(i)&lt;/math&gt; is the number of elements in &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; greater than &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; before &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;.
:&lt;math&gt;v(i) ~~=~~ \# \{ k \mid k &gt; i ~\land~ \pi^{-1}(k) &lt; \pi^{-1}(i) \}&lt;/math&gt;

'''Left inversion count &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt;:'''&lt;br&gt;
With the ''place-based'' definition &lt;math&gt;l(i)&lt;/math&gt; is the number of inversions whose ''bigger'' (right) component is &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;.
:&lt;math&gt;l(i)&lt;/math&gt; is the number of elements in &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; greater than &lt;math&gt;\pi(i)&lt;/math&gt; before &lt;math&gt;\pi(i)&lt;/math&gt;.
:&lt;math&gt;l(i) ~~=~~ \# \left\{ k \mid k &lt; i ~\land~ \pi(k) &gt; \pi(i) \right\}&lt;/math&gt;

'''Right inversion count &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;, often called ''[[Lehmer code]]'':'''&lt;br&gt;
With the ''place-based'' definition &lt;math&gt;r(i)&lt;/math&gt; is the number of inversions whose ''smaller'' (left) component is &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;.
:&lt;math&gt;r(i)&lt;/math&gt; is the number of elements in &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; smaller than &lt;math&gt;\pi(i)&lt;/math&gt; after &lt;math&gt;\pi(i)&lt;/math&gt;.
:&lt;math&gt;r(i) ~~=~~ \# \{ k \mid k &gt; i ~\land~ \pi(k) &lt; \pi(i) \}&lt;/math&gt;

Both &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; can be found with the help of a '''Rothe diagram''', which is a permutation matrix with the 1s represented by dots, and an inversion (often represented by a cross) in every position that has a dot to the right and below it. &lt;math&gt;r(i)&lt;/math&gt; is the sum of inversions in row &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; of the Rothe diagram, while &lt;math&gt;v(i)&lt;/math&gt; is the sum of inversions in column &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;. The permutation matrix of the inverse is the transpose, therefore &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; of a permutation is &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; of its inverse, and vice versa.

==Example: All permutations of four elements==
[[File:2-element subsets of 4 elements; array, hexagonal.svg|thumb|The six possible inversions of a 4-element permutation]]

The following sortable table shows the 24 permutations of four elements with their place-based inversion sets, inversion related vectors and inversion numbers. (The small columns are reflections of the columns next to them, and can be used to sort them in [[colexicographic order]].)

It can be seen that &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; always have the same digits, and that &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; are both related to the place-based inversion set. The nontrivial elements of &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; are the sums of the descending diagonals of the shown triangle, and those of &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; are the sums of the ascending diagonals. (Pairs in descending diagonals have the right components 2, 3, 4 in common, while pairs in ascending diagonals have the left components 1, 2, 3 in common.)

The default order of the table is reverse colex order by &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt;, which is the same as colex order by &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt;. Lex order by &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; is the same as lex order by &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;.

==Weak order of permutations==
[[File:Symmetric group 4; permutohedron 3D; numbers.svg|thumb|Permutohedron of the [[symmetric group]] S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]]
The set of permutations on ''n'' items can be given the structure of a [[partial order]], called the '''weak order of permutations''', which forms a [[lattice (order)|lattice]].

The Hasse diagram of the inversion sets ordered by the [[subset]] relation forms the [[skeleton (topology)|skeleton]] of a [[permutohedron]].

If a permutation is assigned to each inversion set using the place-based definition, the resulting order of permutations is that of the permutohedron, where an edge corresponds to the swapping of two elements with consecutive values. This is the weak order of permutations. The identity is its minimum, and the permutation formed by reversing the identity is its maximum.

If a permutation were assigned to each inversion set using the element-based definition, the resulting order of permutations would be that of a [[Cayley graph]], where an edge corresponds to the swapping of two elements on consecutive places. This Cayley graph of the symmetric group is similar to its permutohedron, but with each permutation replaced by its inverse.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29008">The name '''Jet Propulsion Laboratory Development Ephemeris''' (followed by a number), the abbreviation '''JPL DE'''(number), or just '''DE'''(number) designates one of a series of [[Computer simulation|models]] of the [[Solar system|Solar System]] produced at the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] in [[Pasadena, California]], primarily for purposes of spacecraft navigation and astronomy. The models consist of computer representations of [[Position (vector)|positions]], [[Velocity|velocities]] and [[acceleration]]s of major Solar System bodies, tabulated at equally spaced intervals of time, covering a specified span of years. [[center of mass|Barycentric]] [[Cartesian coordinate system|rectangular coordinates]] of the [[Sun]], eight major [[planet]]s and [[Pluto]], and geocentric coordinates of the [[Moon]] are tabulated.

DE405, created in May 1997, include both [[nutation]]s and [[libration]]s, and is considered the fundamental planetary and lunar ephemerides of The [[Astronomical Almanac]].  It is very large at 62.4 Megabytes, so smaller, more targeted versions have been created based on DE405.

== History ==
There have been many versions of the '''JPL DE''', from the 1960s through the present,&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, {{cite web |url=http://naca.larc.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=19680002127&amp;qs=Ns%3DPublication-Date%7c0%26N%3D4294828771 |title=JPL Development Ephemeris Number 28 |author=Lieske |date=1967 |work=JPL Technical Report 32-1206}}; {{cite web |url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19700021709_1970021709.pdf |title=JPL Development Ephemeris Number 69 |author=O'Handley |display-authors=etal |date=1969 |work=JPL Technical Report 32-1465}}; {{Cite journal|title=JPL Development Ephemeris number 96 |author=Standish |display-authors=etal |date=1976|bibcode = 1976jden.book.....S}}; see also Newhall, Standish and Williams (1983).&lt;/ref&gt; in support of both robotic and manned&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19740075866_1974075866.pdf |title=Estimated DE19 Lunar Ephemeris Errors for the Apollo 15 Mission |author=York |date=1971 |work=NASA MSC Internal Note 71-FM-291}}&lt;/ref&gt; spacecraft missions. Available documentation is sketchy, but we know '''DE69''' was announced in 1969 to be the third release of the JPL Ephemeris Tapes, and was a special purpose, short-duration ephemeris. The then-current JPL Export Ephemeris was '''DE19'''. These early releases were distributed on [[magnetic tape]].

In the days before personal computers, computers were large and expensive, and numerical integrations such as these were run by large organizations with ample resources. The JPL ephemerides prior to '''DE405''' were integrated on a [[Univac]] mainframe in [[Double-precision floating-point format|double precision]]. For instance, '''DE102''', which was created in 1977, took six million steps and ran for nine days on a [[UNIVAC 1100/2200 series|Univac 1100/81]].&lt;ref name="nsw1983" /&gt; '''DE405''' was integrated on a [[DEC Alpha]] in [[Quadruple-precision floating-point format|quadruple precision]].&lt;ref&gt;See Standish and Williams in the '''Sources'''&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s and early 1980s, much work was done in the astronomical community to update the astronomical almanacs from the [[Newcomb's Tables of the Sun|theoretical work of the 1890s]] to modern, relativistic theory. From 1975 through 1982, six ephemerides were produced at JPL using the modern techniques of least-squares adjustment of numerically-integrated output to high precision data: '''DE96''' in Nov. 1975, '''DE102''' in Sep. 1977, '''DE111''' in May 1980, '''DE118''' in Sep. 1981, and '''DE200''' in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |bibcode=1990A&amp;A...233..252S |last=Standish |first=E. M., Jr. |title=The observational basis for JPL's DE 200, the planetary ephemerides of the Astronomical Almanac |journal=Astronomy and Astrophysics |volume=233 |issue=1 |date=July 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''DE102''' was the first numerically integrated so-called Long Ephemeris, covering much of history for which useful astronomical observations were available: 1141 BC to AD 3001. '''DE200''', a version of '''DE118''' migrated to the [[Epoch (astronomy)|J2000.0 reference frame]], was adopted as the [[fundamental ephemeris]] for the new almanacs starting in 1984. DE402 introduced coordinates referred to the [[International Celestial Reference Frame]] (ICRF).

The JPL ephemerides have been the basis of the [[Astronomical Almanac]] since 1981's  DE200.  The current (2016) Almanac is derived from '''DE430'''.&lt;ref name="USNO" /&gt;

== Construction ==
Each [[ephemeris]] was produced by [[numerical integration]] of the [[equations of motion]], starting from a set of initial conditions.  Due to the precision of modern observational data, the [[Analytical mechanics|analytical]] method of [[Perturbation (astronomy)|general perturbations]] could no longer be applied to a high enough accuracy to adequately reproduce the observations. The method of [[Perturbation (astronomy)|special perturbations]] was applied, using numerical integration to [[Equation solving|solve]] the [[N-body problem|''n''-body problem]], in effect putting the entire Solar System into motion in the computer's memory, accounting for all relevant physical laws. The initial conditions were both constants such as [[planetary mass]]es, from outside sources, and parameters such as initial positions and velocities, adjusted to produce output which was a "best fit" to a large set of [[observation]]s. A [[Least squares|least-squares]] technique was used to perform the fitting.&lt;ref name="nsw1983" /&gt; As of DE421, perturbations from 343 asteroids, representing about 90% of the mass of the [[Asteroid belt|main asteroid belt]], have been included in the dynamical model.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ipnpr.jpl.nasa.gov/progress_report/42-196/196C.pdf|title=The Planetary and Lunar Ephemerides, DE430 and DE431|last=Folkner|first=William|date=February 15, 2014|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The physics modeled included the mutual [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|Newtonian]] gravitational accelerations and their [[Parameterized post-Newtonian formalism|relativistic corrections]] (a modified form of the [[Einstein–Infeld–Hoffmann equations|Einstein-Infeld-Hoffmann equation]]), the [[Tidal acceleration|accelerations caused by the tidal distortion]] of the Earth, the accelerations caused by the [[figure of the Earth]] and Moon, and a model of the lunar [[libration]]s.&lt;ref name="nsw1983"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Newhall |first=X.

The observational data in the fits has been an evolving set, including: ranges (distances) to planets measured by radio signals from spacecraft,&lt;ref&gt;See {{cite web|url=http://descanso.jpl.nasa.gov/Monograph/series1/Descanso1_all.pdf |title=Radiometric Tracking Techniques for Deep-Space Navigation |author=Thornton and Border |date=2000 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120218224943/http://descanso.jpl.nasa.gov/Monograph/series1/Descanso1_all.pdf |archivedate=2012-02-18 |df= }} for a good summary of spacecraft radio-navigation.&lt;/ref&gt; direct [[Radar astronomy|radar-ranging]] of planets, two-dimensional position fixes (on the plane of the sky) by [[VLBI]] of spacecraft, [[Transit circle|transit]] and [[Charge-coupled device|CCD]] telescopic observations of planets and small bodies, and [[Lunar laser ranging|laser-ranging]] of [[retroreflector]]s on the Moon, among others. '''DE102''', for instance, was fit to 48,479 observations.

The time argument of the integrated ephemerides is a [[Coordinate time|relativistic coordinate time]] scale called [[Ephemeris time#JPL ephemeris time argument Teph|T&lt;sub&gt;eph&lt;/sub&gt;]],&lt;ref&gt;See sources cited at [[Ephemeris time#JPL ephemeris time argument T&lt;sub&gt;eph&lt;/sub&gt;|JPL ephemeris time argument Teph]].&lt;/ref&gt; necessary in precise work to account for the small [[Theory of relativity|relativistic]] effects of [[time dilation]] and [[Relativity of simultaneity|simultaneity]]. In later ephemerides, T&lt;sub&gt;eph&lt;/sub&gt; is essentially equivalent to the [[International Astronomical Union|IAU]] definition of [[Barycentric Coordinate Time|TCB]].

Positions and velocities of the Sun, Earth, Moon, and planets, along with the orientation of the Moon, are stored as [[Chebyshev polynomials|Chebyshev polynomial coefficients]] fit in 32-day-long segments.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  The ephemerides are now available via World Wide Web and FTP&lt;ref&gt;See the [ftp://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/eph/planets/ JPL FTP site] with ephemerides (data files), source code (for access and basic processing of the data to recover positions and velocities), and documentation.&lt;/ref&gt; as data files containing the Chebyshev coefficients, along with source code to recover (calculate) positions and velocities.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;See JPL Planetary and Lunar Ephemerides Export Information [ftp://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/eph/planets/README.txt README.txt version of 12 Oct 2007]. Also available is an older version [http://iau-comm4.jpl.nasa.gov/README.html README.txt version of December 6, 2005] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120115000000/http://iau-comm4.jpl.nasa.gov/README.html |date=January 15, 2012 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Files vary in the time periods they cover, ranging from a few hundred years to several thousand, and bodies they include. Data may be based on each planet's true center or its [[barycenter]].

The use of Chebyshev polynomials enables highly precise calculations for a given point in time.  '''DE405''' recovery (calculation) for the [[inner planet]]s is about 0.001 [[Minute of arc|arcseconds]] (equivalent to about 1&amp;nbsp;km at the distance of [[Mars]]); for the [[outer planet]]s it is generally about 0.1 arcseconds.  The 'reduced accuracy' '''DE406''' ephemeris gives an interpolating precision (relative to the full ephemeris values) no worse than 25&amp;nbsp;metres for any planet and no worse than 1&amp;nbsp;metre for the moon.

Note that these precision numbers are for the interpolated values relative original tabulated coordinates. The overall precision and accuracy of interpolated values for describing the actual motions of the planets will be a function of both the precision of the ephemeris tabulated coordinates and the precision of the interpolation.

== Applications ==
*JPL uses the ephemerides for navigation of spacecraft throughout the Solar System. Typically, a new ephemeris is computed including the latest available observations of the target planet(s), either for planning of the mission(s), or for final contact of the spacecraft with the target. See below, [[#Recent ephemerides in the series|Recent ephemerides in the series]].
*The [[Astronomical Almanac]] for 1984 through 2002 were based on JPL ephemeris '''DE200''', and from 2003 to 2014 the Astronomical Almanac was based on JPL ephemeris '''DE405'''.&lt;ref name="USNO"&gt;See US Naval Observatory (Naval Oceanography Portal), [http://aa.usno.navy.mil/publications/docs/asa_history.php "History of the Astronomical Almanac"] (accessed September 2017); see also Standish (1998) for details of DE405.&lt;/ref&gt; The current Almanac is derived from '''DE430'''.
*The JPL ephemerides are widely used for planetary science; some examples are included in the [[#Notes and references|Notes and References]].
*Software is available to use the JPL ephemerides for the production of apparent ephemerides for any location and time; these are widely used by professional and amateur astronomers for reducing planetary observations and producing very precise observing guides.&lt;ref&gt;See the NASA [http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/naif/index.html SPICE] system.&lt;/ref&gt;
*DE430 and DE431 can be used with the popular planetarium software [[Stellarium (software)|Stellarium]]

It covers the dates 1550 Jan 01 to 2650 Jan 22 with the most accurate lunar ephemeris. From 2015 onwards this ephemeris is utilized in Astronomical Almanac. Beginning with this release only Mars' Barycenter was included due to the small masses of its moons Phobos and Deimos which create a very small offset from the planet's center.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=ftp://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/eph/planets/bsp/README.txt|title=JPL PLANETARY AND LUNAR EPHEMERIDES : Export Information|last=|first=|date=April 30, 2014|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The complete ephemerides files is 128 megabytes but several alternative versions have been made available by JPL&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Past releases ===

'''DE102''' was created in 1981, includes nutations but not librations. Referred to the dynamical equator and equinox of 1950. Covers JED 1206160.5 (-1410 APR 16) to JED 2817872.5 (3002 DEC 22).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''DE200''' was created in 1981; includes nutations but not librations. Referred to the dynamical equator and equinox of 2000. Covers JED 2305424.5 (1599 DEC 09) to JED 2513360.5 (2169 MAR 31). This ephemeris was used for the [[Astronomical Almanac]] from 1984 to 2003.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''DE202''' was created in 1987; includes nutations and librations. Referred to the dynamical equator and equinox of 2000. Covers JED 2414992.5 (1899 DEC 04) to JED 2469808.5 (2050 JAN 02).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''DE402''' was released in 1995, and was quickly superseded by DE403.

'''DE403'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iau-comm4.jpl.nasa.gov/de403iom/de403iom.pdf |title=JPL Planetary and Lunar Ephemerides, DE403/LE403 |author=Standish |display-authors=etal |date=1995 |work=JPL Interoffice Memorandum IOM 314.10-127 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811081430/http://iau-comm4.jpl.nasa.gov/de403iom/de403iom.pdf |archivedate=August 11, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was created 1993, released in 1995. F JPL ephemeris was expressed in the coordinates of the [[IERS|International Earth Rotation Service]] (IERS) reference frame, essentially the ICRF. The data crunched by JPL to derive the ephemeris began to move away from limited-accuracy telescopic observations and more toward higher-accuracy [[radar astronomy|radar-ranging]] of the planets, radio-ranging of spacecraft, and [[VLBI|very-long-baseline-interferometric]] (VLBI) observations of spacecraft, especially for the four inner planets. Telescopic observations remained important for the outer planets because of their distance, hence the inability to bounce radar off of them, and the difficulty of parking a spacecraft near them. The [[perturbation (astronomy)|perturbations]] of 300 asteroids were included, vs DE118/DE200 which included only the five asteroids determined to cause the largest perturbations. Better values of the planets' masses had been found since DE118/DE200, further refining the perturbations. [[Lunar Laser Ranging experiment|Lunar Laser Ranging]] accuracy was improved, giving better positions of the Moon. DE403 covered the time span Apr 1599 to Jun 2199.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iau-comm4.jpl.nasa.gov/README.html |title=JPL PLANETARY AND LUNAR EPHEMERIDES : Export Information |author=Folkner |date=2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120115000000/http://iau-comm4.jpl.nasa.gov/README.html |archivedate=2012-01-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''DE404'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=New accuracy levels for solar system ephemerides (Lecture) |last1=Standish |first1=E. M., Jr. |last2=Newhall |first2=X. X. |date=1996|bibcode = 1996IAUS..172...29S}}&lt;/ref&gt; was released in 1996. A so-called Long Ephemeris, this condensed version of DE403 covered 3000 BC to AD 3000. While both DE403 and DE404 were integrated over the same timespan, the interpolation of DE404 was somewhat reduced in accuracy and [[nutation]] of the Earth and [[libration]] of the Moon were not included.

'''DE405'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iau-comm4.jpl.nasa.gov/de405iom/de405iom.pdf|title=JPL Planetary and Lunar Ephemerides, DE405/LE405|author=Standish|date=1998|work=JPL Interoffice Memorandum 312.F-98-048|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220062549/http://iau-comm4.jpl.nasa.gov/de405iom/de405iom.pdf|archivedate=February 20, 2012|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; was released in 1998. It added several years' extra data from telescopic, radar, spacecraft, and VLBI observations (of the [[Galileo (spacecraft)|Galileo]] spacecraft at Jupiter, in particular). The method of modeling the asteroids' perturbations was improved, although the same number of asteroids were modeled. The ephemeris was more accurately oriented onto the ICRF. DE405 covered 1600 to 2200 to full precision. This ephemeris was utilized in the Astronomical Almanac from 2003 until 2014.

'''DE406''' was released with DE405 in 1998. A Long Ephemeris, this was the condensed version of DE405, covering 3000 BC to AD 3000 with the same limitations as DE404. This is the same integration as DE405, with the accuracy of the interpolating polynomials has been lessened to reduce file size for the longer time span covered by the file.

'''DE407'''&lt;ref&gt;See, for instance, {{cite web |url=http://202.127.29.4/cddisa/data_base/IERS/Annual_Reports/Annual_Report_2004.pdf |title=IERS Annual Report 2004}} which mentions DE407 only very briefly.&lt;/ref&gt; was apparently unreleased. Details in readily-available sources are sketchy.

'''DE408'''&lt;ref&gt;See {{cite web |url=http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/generic_kernels/spk/planets/a_old_versions/de408.cmt |title=de408.cmt}} at NASA's Navigation and Ancillary Information Facility website and {{cite journal |bibcode=2007Icar..187..365P |title=Long-period forcing of Mercury's libration in longitude |last=Peale |first=S.

'''DE409'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=ftp://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/eph/planets/ioms/de409.iom.pdf |title=JPL Planetary Ephemeris DE409 |author=Standish |date=2003 |work=JPL Interoffice Memorandum IOM 312.N-03-007}}&lt;/ref&gt; was released in 2003 for the [[Mars Exploration Rover|MER]] spacecraft arrival at Mars and the [[Cassini–Huygens|Cassini]] arrival at Saturn. Further spacecraft ranging and VLBI (to the [[Mars Global Surveyor]], [[Mars Pathfinder]] and the [[2001 Mars Odyssey|Mars Odyssey]] spacecraft) and telescopic data were included in the fit. The orbits of the [[Pioneer 11|Pioneer]] and [[Voyager program|Voyager]] spacecraft were reprocessed to give data points for Saturn. These resulted in improvements over DE405, especially to the predicted positions of Mars and Saturn. DE409 covered the years 1901 to 2019.

'''DE410'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=ftp://128.149.23.134/pub/eph/planets/ioms/de410.iom.pdf |title=JPL Planetary Ephemeris DE410 |author=Standish |date=2003 |work=JPL Interoffice Memorandum IOM 312.N-03-009}}&lt;/ref&gt; was also released in 2003 covered 1901 - 2019, with improvements from DE409 in the masses for Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn and the Earth-Moon system based on recent research. Though the masses had not yet been adopted by the [[International Astronomical Union|IAU]]. The ephemerides were created to support the arrivals of the [[Mars Exploration Rover|MER]] and [[Cassini–Huygens|Cassini]] spacecraft.

'''DE411'''&lt;ref name="Standish"&gt;See, for instance, {{cite web |url=http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/generic_kernels/spk/planets/a_old_versions/de413_memo.pdf |title=The Ephemeris of Pluto: DE413 |author=Standish |date=2004 |work=JPL Interoffice Memorandum IOM 343-04-008}} which compares DE413 output with DE411.&lt;/ref&gt;  was widely cited in the astronomical community, but not publicly released by JPL

'''DE412'''&lt;ref&gt;See, for instance, {{cite web |url=http://iopscience.iop.org/2041-8205/720/2/L201/fulltext/apjl_720_2_201.text.html |title=Measuring the Mass of Solar System Planets Using Pulsar Timing |work=The Astrophysical Journal Letters |date=2010 |author=Champion|display-authors=etal}} which references DE412.&lt;/ref&gt; was widely cited in the astronomical community, but not publicly released by JPL

'''DE413'''&lt;ref name="Standish" /&gt; was released in 2004 with updated ephemeris of [[Pluto]] in support of the [[occultation]] of a star by its satellite [[Charon (moon)|Charon]] on 11 Jul 2005. DE413 was fit to new [[Charge-coupled device|CCD]] telescopic observations of Pluto in order to give improved positions of the planet and its moon.

'''DE414'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=ftp://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/eph/planets/ioms/de414.iom.pdf |title=JPL Planetary Ephemeris DE414 |author=Standish |date=2006 |work=JPL Interoffice Memorandum IOM 343.R-06-002}}&lt;/ref&gt; was created in 2005 and released in 2006. The [[numerical integration]] software was updated to use [[Quadruple-precision floating-point format|quadruple-precision]] for the [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|Newtonian]] part of the [[equations of motion]]. Ranging data to the [[Mars Global Surveyor]] and [[2001 Mars Odyssey|Mars Odyssey]] spacecraft were extended to 2005, and further CCD observations of the five outer planets were included in the fit. Some data was accidentally left out of the fit, namely [[Magellan (spacecraft)|Magellan]] Venus data for 1992-94 and Galileo Jupiter data for 1996-97. Some ranging data to the [[NEAR|NEAR Shoemaker]] spacecraft orbiting the asteroid [[433 Eros|Eros]] was used to derive the Earth/Moon mass ratio. DE414 covered the years 1599 to 2201.

'''DE418'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=ftp://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/generic_kernels/spk/planets/a_old_versions/de418_announcement.pdf |title=Planetary and Lunar Ephemeris DE418 |author=Folkner |display-authors=etal |date=2007 |work=JPL Interoffice Memorandum IOM 343.R-07-005}}&lt;/ref&gt; was released in 2007 for planning the [[New Horizons]] mission to Pluto. New observations of Pluto, which took advantage of the new [[Astrometry|astrometric]] accuracy of the [[Hipparcos]] star catalog, were included in the fit. Mars spacecraft ranging and VLBI observations were updated through 2007. Asteroid masses were estimated differently. Lunar laser ranging data for the Moon was added for the first time since DE403, significantly improving the lunar orbit and librations. Estimated position data from the Cassini spacecraft was included in the fit, improving the orbit of Saturn, but rigorous analysis of the data was deferred to a later date. DE418 covered the years 1899 to 2051, and JPL recommended not using it outside of that range due to minor inconsistencies which remained in the planets' masses due to time constraints.

'''DE421'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=ftp://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/eph/planets/ioms/de421.iom.v1.pdf |title=The Planetary and Lunar Ephemeris DE421 |author=Folkner |display-authors=etal |date=2008 |work=JPL Interoffice Memorandum IOM 343.R-08-003}}&lt;/ref&gt; was released in 2008. It included additional ranging and VLBI measurements of Mars spacecraft, new ranging and VLBI of the [[Venus Express]] spacecraft, the latest estimates of planetary masses, additional lunar laser ranging, and two more months of CCD measurements of Pluto.  When initially released in 2008, the DE421 ephemeris covered the years 1900 to 2050.  An additional data release in 2013 extended the coverage to the year 2200.

'''DE422'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iau-comm4.jpl.nasa.gov/README.html |title=JPL Planetary and Lunar Ephemerides : Export Information |author=Folkner |date=2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120115211922/http://iau-comm4.jpl.nasa.gov/README.html |archivedate=January 15, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was created in 2009 for the [[MESSENGER]] mission to Mercury. A Long Ephemeris, it was intended to replace DE406, covering 3000 BC to AD 3000.

'''DE423'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=ftp://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/eph/planets/ioms/de423.iom.pdf |title=Planetary Ephemeris DE423 fit to Messenger encounters with Mercury |author=Folkner |date=2010 |work=JPL Interoffice Memorandum IOM 343.R-10-001}}&lt;/ref&gt; was released in 2010. Position estimates of the MESSENGER spacecraft and additional range and VLBI data from the Venus Express spacecraft were fit. DE423 covered the years 1799 to 2200.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2655">In [[mathematical logic]], a '''literal''' is an [[atomic formula]] (atom) or its [[negation]]. 
The definition mostly appears in [[proof theory]] (of [[classical logic]]), e.g. in [[conjunctive normal form]] and the method of [[resolution (logic)|resolution]].

Literals can be divided into two types:
* A '''positive literal''' is just an atom.
* A '''negative literal''' is the negation of an atom.

For a literal &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt;, the '''complementary literal''' is a literal corresponding to the negation of &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt;, 
we can write &lt;math&gt;\bar{l}&lt;/math&gt; to denote the complementary literal of &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt;. More precisely, if &lt;math&gt;l\equiv x&lt;/math&gt; then  &lt;math&gt;\bar{l}&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\lnot x&lt;/math&gt; and if &lt;math&gt;l\equiv \lnot x&lt;/math&gt; then  &lt;math&gt;\bar{l}&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.

In the context of a formula in the [[conjunctive normal form]], a literal is '''pure''' if the literal's complement does not appear in the formula.

In [[Boolean function|Boolean functions]], the variables that appear either in complemented or uncompleted form is a literal. For example, if &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;are variables then the expressions &lt;math&gt;\bar{A}BC&lt;/math&gt;contains three literal and &lt;math&gt;\bar{A}C+\bar{B}\bar{C}&lt;/math&gt;contains three literals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.ph/books?redir_esc=y&amp;id=fig900Q1eJ0C&amp;q=literal#v=snippet&amp;q=literal&amp;f=false|title=Digital Logic Circuits|last=A.P.Godse|first=D. A. Godse|date=2008|publisher=Technical Publications|isbn=9788184314250|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==
In [[propositional calculus]] a literal is simply a [[propositional variable]] or its negation.

In [[predicate calculus]] a literal is an [[atomic formula]] or its negation, where an atomic formula is a [[Predicate (mathematical logic)|predicate]] symbol applied to some [[term (logic)|terms]], &lt;math&gt;P(t_1,\ldots,t_n)&lt;/math&gt; with the terms [[recursive definition|recursively defined]] starting from constant symbols, variable symbols, and [[function (mathematics)|function]] symbols. For example, &lt;math&gt;\neg Q(f(g(x), y, 2), x)&lt;/math&gt; is a negative literal with the constant symbol 2, the variable symbols ''x'', ''y'', the function symbols ''f'', ''g'', and the predicate symbol ''Q''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16188">In [[computational linguistics]], the term '''mildly context-sensitive grammar formalisms''' refers to several [[grammar formalism]]s that have been developed with the ambition to provide [[linguistic description|adequate description]]s of the [[syntactic structure]] of [[language|natural language]].

Every mildly context-sensitive grammar formalism defines a class of '''mildly context-sensitive grammars''' (the grammars that can be specified in the formalism), and therefore also a class of '''mildly context-sensitive languages''' (the [[formal language]]s generated by the grammars).

== Background ==

By 1985, several researchers in descriptive and mathematical linguistics had provided evidence against the hypothesis that the syntactic structure of natural language can be adequately described by [[context-free grammar]]s.&lt;ref name="huybregts1984"&gt;Riny Huybregts. "The Weak Inadequacy of Context-Free Phrase Structure Grammars". In Ger de Haan, Mieke Trommelen, and Wim Zonneveld, editors, ''Van periferie naar kern'', pages 81–99. Foris, Dordrecht, The Netherlands, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="shieber1985evidence"&gt;Stuart M. Shieber. "Evidence Against the Context-Freeness of Natural Language". ''Linguistics and Philosophy'', 8(3):333–343, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;
At the same time, the step to the next level of the [[Chomsky hierarchy]], to [[context-sensitive grammar]]s, appeared both unnecessary and undesirable.
In an attempt to pinpoint the exact formal power required for the adequate description of natural language syntax, [[Aravind Joshi]] characterized "grammars (and associated [[formal language|language]]s) that are only slightly more powerful than context-free grammars (context-free languages)".&lt;ref name="joshi1985tree"&gt;Aravind K. Joshi. "Tree Adjoining Grammars: How Much Context-Sensitivity Is Required to Provide Reasonable Structural Descriptions?". In David R. Dowty, Lauri Karttunen, and Arnold M. Zwicky, editors, ''Natural Language Parsing'', pages 206–250. Cambridge University Press, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;
He called these grammars ''mildly context-sensitive grammars'' and the associated languages ''mildly context-sensitive languages''.

Joshi’s characterization of mildly context-sensitive grammars was biased toward his work on [[tree-adjoining grammar]] (TAG).
However, together with his students Vijay Shanker and David Weir, Joshi soon discovered that TAGs are equivalent, in terms of the generated string languages, to the independently introduced [[head grammar]] (HG).&lt;ref name="weir1986relationship"&gt;David J. Weir, K. Vijay-Shanker, and Aravind K. Joshi. "The Relationship Between Tree Adjoining Grammars and Head Grammars". In ''Proceedings of the 24th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL)'', pages 67–74, New York, USA, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;
This was followed by two similar equivalence results, for [[linear indexed grammar]] (LIG)&lt;ref name="vijayshanker1987study"&gt;K. Vijay-Shanker. "A Study of Tree Adjoining Grammars". Ph.D. thesis, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, USA, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[combinatory categorial grammar]] (CCG),&lt;ref name="weir1988combinatory"&gt;David J. Weir and Aravind K. Joshi. "Combinatory Categorial Grammars: Generative Power and Relationship to Linear Context-Free Rewriting Systems". In ''Proceedings of the 26th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL)'', pages 278–285, Buffalo, USA, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; which showed that the notion of mildly context-sensitivity is a very general one and not tied to a specific formalism.

The TAG-equivalent formalisms were generalized by the introduction of [[linear context-free rewriting system]]s (LCFRS).&lt;ref name="vijayshanker1987characterizing"&gt;K. Vijay-Shanker, David J. Weir, and Aravind K. Joshi. "Characterizing Structural Descriptions Produced by Various Grammatical Formalisms". In ''Proceedings of the 25th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL)'', pages 104–111, Stanford, CA, USA, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="weir1988characterizing"&gt;David J. Weir. "Characterizing Mildly Context-Sensitive Grammar Formalisms". Ph.D. thesis, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, USA, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;
These grammars define an infinite hierarchy of string languages in between the context-free and the context-sensitive languages, with the languages generated by the TAG-equivalent formalisms at the lower end {{Clarify|date=February 2018}} of the hierarchy.
Independently of and almost simultaneously to LCFRS, Hiroyuki Seki et al. proposed the essentially identical formalism of multiple context-free grammar (MCFG).&lt;ref name="seki1991multiple"&gt;Hiroyuki Seki, Takashi Matsumura, Mamoru Fujii, and Tadao Kasami. "On Multiple Context-Free Grammars". ''Theoretical Computer Science'', 88(2):191–229, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;
LCFRS/MCFG is sometimes regarded as the most general formalism for specifying mildly context-sensitive grammars.
However, several authors have noted that some of the characteristic properties of the TAG-equivalent formalisms are not preserved by LCFRS/MCFG,&lt;ref name="kanazawa2009pumping"&gt;Makoto Kanazawa. "The Pumping Lemma for Well-Nested Multiple Context-Free Languages". In ''Developments in Language Theory. 13th International Conference, DLT 2009, Stuttgart, Germany, June 30–July 3, 2009. Proceedings'', volume 5583 of ''Lecture Notes in Computer Science'', pages 312–325, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and that there are languages that have the characteristic properties of mildly context-sensitivity but are not generated by LCFRS/MCFG.&lt;ref name="kallmeyer2010mildly"&gt;Laura Kallmeyer. "On Mildly Context-Sensitive Non-Linear Rewriting". ''Research on Language and Computation'', 8(4):341–363, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent years have seen increased interest in the restricted class of ''well-nested'' linear context-free rewriting systems/multiple context-free grammars,&lt;ref name="kanazawa2009pumping"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gomez2010efficient"&gt;Carlos Gómez-Rodríguez, Marco Kuhlmann, and Giorgio Satta. "Efficient Parsing of Well-Nested Linear Context-Free Rewriting Systems". In ''Proceedings of Human Language Technologies: The 2010 Annual Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics (NAACL)'', pages 276–284, Los Angeles, USA, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; which define a class of grammars that properly includes the TAG-equivalent formalisms but is properly included in the unrestricted LCFRS/MCFG hierarchy.

== Characterization ==

Despite a considerable amount of work on the subject, there is no generally accepted formal definition of mild context-sensitivity.

According to the original characterization by Joshi,&lt;ref name="joshi1985tree"/&gt; a class of mildly context-sensitive grammars should have the following properties:
# limited [[cross-serial dependencies]]
# constant growth
# polynomial parsing
In addition to these, it is understood that every class of mildly context-sensitive grammars should be able to generate all context-free languages.

Joshi’s characterization is not a formal definition. He notes:&lt;ref name="joshi1985tree"/&gt;
{{cquote|
This is only a rough characterization because conditions&amp;nbsp;1 and&amp;nbsp;3 depend on the grammars, while condition&amp;nbsp;2 depends on the languages; further, condition&amp;nbsp;1 needs to be specified much more precisely than I have done so far.
}}

Other authors have proposed alternative characterizations of mild context-sensitivity, some of which take the form of formal definitions.
For example, Laura Kallmeyer&lt;ref name="kallmeyer2010parsing"&gt;Laura Kallmeyer. ''Parsing Beyond Context-Free Grammars''. Springer, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; takes the perspective that mild context-sensitivity should be defined as a property of classes of languages rather than, as in Joshi’s characterization, classes of grammars.
Such a language-based definition leads to a different notion of the concept than Joshi’s.

=== Cross-serial dependencies ===

The term ''[[cross-serial dependencies]]'' refers to certain characteristic word ordering patterns, in particular to the verb–argument patterns observed in subordinate clauses in Dutch&lt;ref name="huybregts1984"/&gt; and Swiss German.&lt;ref name="shieber1985evidence"/&gt;
These are the very patterns that can be used to argue against the context-freeness of natural language; thus requiring mildly context-sensitive grammars to model cross-serial dependencies means that these grammars must be more powerful than context-free grammars.

Kallmeyer&lt;ref name="kallmeyer2010parsing"/&gt; identifies the ability to model cross-serial dependencies with the ability to generate the ''copy language''

&lt;math&gt;\mathit{COPY} = \{\, ww \mid w \in \{a, b\}^* \,\}&lt;/math&gt;

and its generalizations to two or more copies of&amp;nbsp;''w'', up to some bound.
These languages are not context-free, which can be shown using the [[pumping lemma for context-free languages|pumping lemma]].

=== Constant growth ===

A formal language is of ''constant growth'' if every string in the language is longer than the next shorter strings by at most a (language-specific) constant.
Languages that violate this property are often considered to be beyond human capacity, although some authors have argued that certain phenomena in natural language do show a growth that cannot be bounded by a constant.&lt;ref name="michaelis1996semilinearity"&gt;Jens Michaelis and Marcus Kracht. "Semilinearity as a Syntactic Invariant". In ''Logical Aspects of Computational Linguistics. First International Conference, LACL 1996, Nancy, France, September 23–25, 1996. Selected Papers'', volume 1328 of ''Lecture Notes in Computer Science'', pages 329–345. Springer, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most mildly context-sensitive grammar formalisms (in particular, LCFRS/MCFG) actually satisfy a stronger property than constant growth called ''semilinearity''.&lt;ref name="vijayshanker1987characterizing"/&gt;
A language is semilinear if its image under the Parikh-mapping (the mapping that "forgets" the relative position of the symbols in a string, effectively treating it as a bag of words) is a [[regular language]].
All semilinear languages are of constant growth, but not every language with constant growth is semilinear.&lt;ref name="kallmeyer2010mildly"/&gt;

=== Polynomial parsing ===

A grammar formalism is said to have ''polynomial parsing'' if its membership problem can be solved in [[PTIME|deterministic polynomial time]].
This is the problem to decide, given a grammar ''G'' written in the formalism and a string&amp;nbsp;''w'', whether ''w'' is generated by&amp;nbsp;''G'' – that is, whether ''w'' is "grammatical" according to&amp;nbsp;''G''.
The time complexity of this problem is measured in terms of the combined size of&amp;nbsp;''G'' and&amp;nbsp;''w''.

Under the view on mild context-sensitivity as a property of classes of languages, ''polynomial parsing'' refers to the language membership problem.
This is the problem to decide, for a fixed language&amp;nbsp;''L'', whether a given string&amp;nbsp;''w'' belongs to&amp;nbsp;''L''.
The time complexity of this problem is measured in terms of the length of&amp;nbsp;''w''; it ignores the question how ''L'' is specified.

Note that both understandings of ''polynomial parsing'' are idealizations in the sense that for practical applications one is interested not only in the yes/no question whether a sentence is grammatical, but also in the syntactic structure that the grammar assigns to the sentence.

== Formalisms ==

Over the years, a large number of grammar formalisms have been introduced that satisfy some or all of the characteristic properties put forth by Joshi.
Several of them have alternative, automaton-based characterizations that are not discussed in this article; for example, the languages generated by tree-adjoining grammar can be characterized by [[embedded pushdown automaton|embedded pushdown automata]].

Bunt, John Carroll, and Giorgio Satta, editors, ''New Developments in Parsing Technology'', volume 23 of ''Text, Speech and Language Technology'', pages 269–289. Kluwer Academic Publishers, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Formalisms equivalent to well-nested LCFRS/MCFG ===

* Non-duplicating macro grammars&lt;ref name="fischer1968grammars"&gt;Michael J. Fischer. "Grammars with Macro-Like Productions". In ''Ninth Annual Symposium on Switching and Automata Theory'', pages 131–142, Schenectady, NY, USA, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt;

* Well-nested linear context-free rewriting systems&lt;ref name="gomez2010efficient"/&gt;
* Well-nested multiple context-free grammars&lt;ref name="kanazawa2009pumping"/&gt;

=== Relations among the formalisms ===

Linear context-free rewriting systems/multiple context-free grammars form a two-dimensional hierarchy of generative power with respect to two grammar-specific parameters called ''fan-out'' and ''rank''.&lt;ref name="rambow1994two"&gt;Owen Rambow and Giorgio Satta. "A Two-Dimensional Hierarchy for Parallel Rewriting Systems". Technical Report IRCS-94-02, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, USA, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;
More precisely, the languages generated by LCFRS/MCFG with fan-out&amp;nbsp;{{math|''f''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;1}} and rank&amp;nbsp;{{math|''r''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;3}} are properly included in the class of languages generated by LCFRS/MCFG with rank&amp;nbsp;{{math|''r''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1}} and fan-out&amp;nbsp;''f'', as well as the class of languages generated by LCFRS/MCFG with rank&amp;nbsp;''r'' and fan-out&amp;nbsp;{{math|''f''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1}}.
In the presence of well-nestedness, this hierarchy collapses to a one-dimensional hierarchy with respect to fan-out; this is because every well-nested LCFRS/MCFG can be transformed into an equivalent well-nested LCFRS/MCFG with the same fan-out and rank&amp;nbsp;2.&lt;ref name="kanazawa2009pumping"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gomez2010efficient"/&gt;
Within the LCFRS/MCFG hierarchy, the context-free languages can be characterized by the grammars with fan-out&amp;nbsp;1; for this fan-out there is no difference between general and well-nested grammars.
The TAG-equivalent formalisms can be characterized as well-nested LCFRS/MCFG of fan-out&amp;nbsp;2.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10041">In [[computing]], especially [[digital signal processing]], the '''multiply–accumulate operation''' is a common step that computes the product of two numbers and adds that product to an [[accumulator (computing)|accumulator]].  The hardware unit that performs the operation is known as a '''multiplier–accumulator''' ('''MAC''', or '''MAC unit'''); the operation itself is also often called a MAC or a MAC operation.  The MAC operation modifies an accumulator ''a'':

:&lt;math&gt;\ a \leftarrow a + ( b \times c )&lt;/math&gt;

When done with [[floating point]] numbers, it might be performed with two [[rounding]]s (typical in many [[digital signal processors|DSP]]s), or with a single rounding.  When performed with a single rounding, it is called a '''fused multiply–add''' ('''FMA''') or '''fused multiply–accumulate''' ('''FMAC''').

Modern computers may contain a dedicated MAC, consisting of a multiplier implemented in [[combinational logic]] followed by an [[adder (electronics)|adder]] and an accumulator register that stores the result. The output of the register is fed back to one input of the adder, so that on each clock cycle, the output of the multiplier is added to the register. Combinational multipliers require a large amount of logic, but can compute a product much more quickly than the [[peasant multiplication|method of shifting and adding]] typical of earlier computers. The first processors to be equipped with MAC units were [[digital signal processor]]s, but the technique is now also common in general-purpose processors.

==In floating-point arithmetic==
When done with [[integer]]s, the operation is typically exact (computed [[modular arithmetic|modulo]] some [[power of two]]). However, [[floating-point]] numbers have only a certain amount of mathematical [[arithmetic precision|precision]]. That is, digital floating-point arithmetic is generally not [[associativity|associative]] or [[distributivity|distributive]]. (See [[Floating point#Accuracy problems]].)
Therefore, it makes a difference to the result whether the multiply–add is performed with two roundings, or in one operation with a single rounding (a fused multiply–add). [[IEEE 754-2008]] specifies that it must be performed with one rounding, yielding a more accurate result.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://developer.nvidia.com/sites/default/files/akamai/cuda/files/NVIDIA-CUDA-Floating-Point.pdf |title=Precision &amp; Performance: Floating Point and IEEE 754 Compliance for NVIDIA GPUs |publisher=nvidia |first1=Nathan |last1=Whitehead |first2=Alex |last2=Fit-Florea |year=2011 |accessdate=2013-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fused multiply–add==
A ''fused'' multiply–add (sometimes known as ''FMA'' or ''fmadd'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=fmadd instrs|url=https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/ssw_aix_61/com.ibm.aix.alangref/idalangref_fmadd_instrs.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;
is a floating-point multiply–add operation performed in one step, with a single rounding. That is, where an unfused multiply–add would compute the product ''b''×''c'', round it to ''N'' significant bits, add the result to ''a'', and round back to ''N'' significant bits, a fused multiply–add would compute the entire expression ''a''+''b''×''c'' to its full precision before rounding the final result down to ''N'' significant bits.

A fast FMA can speed up and improve the accuracy of many computations that involve the accumulation of products:

* [[Dot product]]
* [[Matrix multiplication]]
* [[Polynomial]] evaluation (e.g., with [[Horner's rule]])
* [[Newton's method]] for evaluating functions.
* [[Convolutions]] and [[artificial neural networks]] 

Fused multiply–add can usually be relied on to give more accurate results. However, [[William Morton Kahan|William Kahan]] has pointed out that it can give problems if used unthinkingly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=IEEE Standard 754 for Binary Floating-Point Arithmetic |author-first=William |author-last=Kahan |author-link=William Morton Kahan |url=http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~wkahan/ieee754status/ieee754.ps |date=1996-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; If {{math|''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; − ''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} is evaluated as {{math| ((''x''×''x'') − ''y''×''y'')}} using fused multiply–add, then the result may be negative even when {{math|''x'' {{=}} ''y''}} due to the first multiplication discarding low significance bits. This could then lead to an error if, for instance, the square root of the result is then evaluated.

When implemented inside a [[microprocessor]], an FMA can actually be faster than a multiply operation followed by an add.  However, standard industrial implementations based on the original IBM RS/6000 design require a 2''N''-bit adder to compute the sum properly.&lt;ref name="bridged"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://users.ece.utexas.edu/~quinnell/Research/Bridged%20Floating-Point%20Fused%20Multiply-Add%20Design.pdf |title=Bridged Floating-Point Fused Multiply–Add Design |author-first=Eric |author-last=Quinnell&lt;!-- |date=undated, circa 2006 --&gt; |display-authors=etal}}{{Dead link|date=March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |url=http://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/bitstream/handle/2152/3082/quinnelle60861.pdf |date=May 2007 |title=Floating-Point Fused Multiply–Add Architectures |author-first=Eric |author-last=Quinnell |degree=PhD |access-date=2011-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A useful benefit of including this instruction is that it allows an efficient software implementation of [[division (mathematics)|division]] (see [[division algorithm]]) and [[square root]] (see [[methods of computing square roots]]) operations, thus eliminating the need for dedicated hardware for those operations.&lt;ref name="goldschmidt_algo"&gt;{{cite web |citeseerx=10.1.1.85.9648 |title=Software Division and Square Root Using Goldschmidt's Algorithms |author-first=Peter |author-last=Markstein |date=November 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dot product instruction===
Some machines combine multiple fused multiply add operations into a single step, e.g. performing a four-element dot-product on two 128-bit [[SIMD]] registers ''a0''×''b0''+''a1''×''b1''+''a2''×''b2''+''a3''×''b3'' with single cycle throughput.

===Support===
The FMA operation is included in [[IEEE 754-2008]].

The [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]] [[VAX]]'s POLY instruction is used for evaluating polynomials with [[Horner's rule]] using a succession of multiply and add steps.  Instruction descriptions do not specify whether the multiply and add are performed using a single fma step.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://uranium.vaxpower.org/~isildur/vax/week.html |title=VAX instruction of the week: POLY}}&lt;/ref&gt; This instruction has been a part of the VAX instruction set since its original 11/780 implementation in 1977.

The [[C99|1999 standard]] of the [[C (programming language)|C programming language]] supports the FMA operation through the &lt;code&gt;fma&lt;/code&gt; standard math library function, and standard pragmas controlling optimizations based on FMA.

The fused multiply–add operation was introduced as ''multiply–add fused'' in the IBM [[POWER1]] (1990) processor,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author-first1=R.

'''Ombient''' is the moniker under which '''Mike Hunter''' performs his completely improvised [[Ambient music|ambient]]/[[drone music]].

Ombient's ambient/drone music, being of a live and [[Musical improvisation|improvisational]] nature, is representative of the feeling of the moment in which it is performed and of the subtle feedback between the audience and the cool performer. It features amplified guitar which is processed and layered using digital [[music looping|looping]] equipment enabling a single guitar to produce symphonic levels of density. Ombient has in the last 3 years delved deeply into the world of analog synthesis and more recently analog modular synthesis.

Mike Hunter also plays in the [[Progressive rock|progressive]]/[[World music|world]]/[[Ambient music|ambient]]/[[space rock]] band known as Brainstatik,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.brainstatik.com Brainstatik&lt;/ref&gt; of which Mike Hunter is a member.

Mike Hunter is also a [[Fractal art]]ist.&lt;ref&gt;http://art.ombient.com The Fractal Artwork of Mike Hunter.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''prismanes''' are a class of [[hydrocarbon]] compounds consisting of [[Prism (geometry)|prism]]-like polyhedra of various numbers of sides on the [[polygon]]al base. Chemically, it is a series of fused [[cyclobutane]] rings (a [[ladderane]], with all-[[cis–trans isomerism|cis]]/all-[[Syn and anti addition|syn]] geometry) that wraps around to join its ends and form a band, with [[cycloalkane]] edges. Their chemical formula is (C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;, where ''n'' is the number of cyclobutane sides (the size of the cycloalkane base), and that number also forms the basis for a [[systematic nomenclature|system of nomenclature]] within this class. The first few chemicals in this class are:

Triprismane, tetraprismane, and pentaprismane have been synthesized and studied experimentally, and many higher members of the series have been studied using [[computational chemistry|computer models]]. The first several members do indeed have the geometry of a regular prism, with flat ''n''-gon bases. As ''n'' becomes increasingly large, however, modeling experiments find that highly symmetric geometry is no longer stable, and the molecule distorts into less-symmetric forms. One series of modelling experiments found that starting with [11]prismane, the regular-prism form is not a stable geometry. For example, the structure of [12]prismane would have the cyclobutane chain twisted, with the [[dodecagon]]al bases non-planar and non-parallel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Quantum-chemical investigation of structure and stability of [''n'']-prismanes and [''n'']-asteranes |first1= T.

In [[category theory]], a branch of [[mathematics]], a '''pulation square''' (also called a '''Doolittle diagram''') is a diagram that is simultaneously a [[Pullback (category theory)|pullback]] square and a [[pushout (category theory)|pushout]] square. It is a [[Dual (category theory)|self-dual]] concept.

[[File:Rcprwrld2.png|thumb|right|300px|A two-dimensional crystal and its reciprocal lattice]]

In [[physics]], the '''reciprocal lattice''' represents the [[Fourier transform]] of another lattice (usually a [[Bravais lattice]]). In normal usage, this first lattice (whose transform is represented by the reciprocal lattice) is usually a periodic spatial function in real-space and is also known as the ''direct lattice''. While the direct lattice exists in real-space and is what one would commonly understand as a physical lattice, the reciprocal lattice exists in reciprocal space (also known as ''[[momentum space]]'' or less commonly as ''K-space'', due to the relationship between the [[Pontryagin duality|Pontryagin duals]] momentum and position.) The [[Multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]] lattice of a reciprocal lattice, then, is the original direct lattice again, since the two lattices are Fourier transforms of each other.

The reciprocal lattice plays a fundamental role in most analytic studies of periodic structures, particularly in the [[Dynamical theory of diffraction|theory of diffraction]]. In [[neutron diffraction|neutron]] and [[X-ray]] [[diffraction]], due to the [[Laue equations|Laue conditions]], the momentum difference between incoming and diffracted X-rays of a crystal is a reciprocal lattice vector. The diffraction pattern of a crystal can be used to determine the reciprocal vectors of the lattice. Using this process, one can infer the atomic arrangement of a crystal.

The [[Brillouin zone]] is a [[Wigner-Seitz cell]] of the reciprocal lattice.

==Mathematical description==
Assuming a two-dimensional [[Bravais lattice]]

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}_n = n_1 \mathbf{a}_1 + n_2 \mathbf{a}_2&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;n_1, n_2 \in \mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;.

Any quantity, e.g. the electronic density in an atomic crystal can be written as a periodic function

:&lt;math&gt;f\left(\mathbf{r}\right) = f\left(\mathbf{R}_\mathbf{n} + \mathbf{r}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

Due to the periodicity, it is useful to write &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; as a [[Fourier series #Fourier series of Bravais-lattice-periodic-function|Fourier series]]

:&lt;math&gt;f\left(\mathbf{R}_n + \mathbf{r}\right) = \sum_m {f_m e^{i \mathbf{G}_m \cdot \mathbf{r}} e^{i \mathbf{G}_m \cdot \mathbf{R}_n}}&lt;/math&gt;

Since &lt;math&gt;f(\mathbf{R}_n + \mathbf{r}) = f\left(\mathbf{R}_k + \mathbf{r}\right)&lt;/math&gt; for any &lt;math&gt;n, k \in \mathbb{Z}^2&lt;/math&gt; then the last formula is true for the particular case &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}_0 = 0&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
  \sum_m {f_m \left(e^{i \mathbf{G}_m \cdot \mathbf{r}}\right) \left(e^{i \mathbf{G}_m \cdot \mathbf{R}_n}\right)} = 
  \sum_m {f_m \left(e^{i \mathbf{G}_m \cdot \mathbf{r}}\right) \left(e^{i \mathbf{G}_m \cdot 0}\right)} =
  \sum_m {f_m \left(e^{i \mathbf{G}_m \cdot \mathbf{r}}\right) \left(1\right)}
&lt;/math&gt;

so must be true &lt;math&gt; e^{i \mathbf{G}_m \cdot \mathbf{R}_n} = 1&lt;/math&gt; that means

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{G}_m \cdot \mathbf{R}_n = 2\pi N&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;N \in \mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;.

Mathematically, we can describe the reciprocal lattice as the set of all [[vector (geometric)|vector]]s &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{G}_m&lt;/math&gt; that satisfy the above identity for all lattice point position vectors '''R'''.

This reciprocal lattice is itself a Bravais lattice, and the reciprocal of the reciprocal lattice is the original lattice, which reveals the [[Pontryagin duality]] of their respective vector spaces.

For an infinite two-dimensional lattice, defined by its [[primitive cell|primitive vector]]s &lt;math&gt;\left(\mathbf{a}_1, \mathbf{a}_2\right)&lt;/math&gt;, its reciprocal lattice can be determined by generating its two reciprocal primitive vectors, through the following formulae,

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{G}_m = m_1 \mathbf{b}_1 + m_2 \mathbf{b}_2&lt;/math&gt;

Where,

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \mathbf{b}_1 &amp;= 2\pi \frac{-\mathbf{R} \, \mathbf{a}_2}{-\mathbf{a}_1 \cdot \mathbf{R} \, \mathbf{a}_2}
                = 2\pi \frac{ \mathbf{R} \, \mathbf{a}_2}{ \mathbf{a}_1 \cdot \mathbf{R} \, \mathbf{a}_2} \\
  \mathbf{b}_2 &amp;= 2\pi \frac{ \mathbf{R} \, \mathbf{a}_1}{ \mathbf{a}_2 \cdot \mathbf{R} \, \mathbf{a}_1}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Here &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}&lt;/math&gt; represents a 90 degree [[rotation matrix]].

For an infinite three-dimensional lattice, defined by its [[primitive cell|primitive vector]]s &lt;math&gt;\left(\mathbf{a_{1}}, \mathbf{a}_2, \mathbf{a}_3\right)&lt;/math&gt;, its reciprocal lattice can be determined by generating its three reciprocal primitive vectors, through the formulae

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{G}_m = m_1 \mathbf{b}_1 + m_2 \mathbf{b}_2 + m_3 \mathbf{b}_3&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \mathbf{b}_1 &amp;= 2\pi \frac{\mathbf{a}_2 \times \mathbf{a}_3}{\mathbf{a}_1 \cdot \left(\mathbf{a}_2 \times \mathbf{a}_3\right)} \\
  \mathbf{b}_2 &amp;= 2\pi \frac{\mathbf{a}_3 \times \mathbf{a}_1}{\mathbf{a}_2 \cdot \left(\mathbf{a}_3 \times \mathbf{a}_1\right)} \\
  \mathbf{b}_3 &amp;= 2\pi \frac{\mathbf{a}_1 \times \mathbf{a}_2}{\mathbf{a}_3 \cdot \left(\mathbf{a}_1 \times \mathbf{a}_2\right)}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Note that the denominator is the [[scalar triple product]]. Using column vector representation of (reciprocal) primitive vectors, the formulae above can be rewritten using [[matrix inversion]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\left[\mathbf{b}_1\mathbf{b}_2\mathbf{b}_3\right]^\mathsf{T} = 2\pi\left[\mathbf{a}_1\mathbf{a}_2\mathbf{a}_3\right]^{-1}.&lt;/math&gt;

This method appeals to the definition, and allows generalization to arbitrary dimensions.  The cross product formula dominates introductory materials on crystallography.

The above definition is called the "physics" definition, as the factor of &lt;math&gt;2 \pi&lt;/math&gt; comes naturally from the study of periodic structures.  An equivalent definition, the "crystallographer's" definition, comes from defining the reciprocal lattice to be &lt;math&gt;e^{2 \pi i\mathbf{K} \cdot \mathbf{R}} = 1&lt;/math&gt; which changes the definitions of the reciprocal lattice vectors to be

:&lt;math&gt;
  \mathbf{b}_1 = \frac{\mathbf{a}_2 \times \mathbf{a}_3}{\mathbf{a}_1 \cdot \left(\mathbf{a}_2 \times \mathbf{a}_3\right)} 
&lt;/math&gt;
and so on for the other vectors.  The crystallographer's definition has the advantage that the definition of
&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{b}_1&lt;/math&gt; is just the reciprocal magnitude of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}_1&lt;/math&gt; in the direction of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}_2 \times \mathbf{a}_3&lt;/math&gt;, dropping the factor of &lt;math&gt;2 \pi&lt;/math&gt;.  This can simplify certain mathematical manipulations, and expresses reciprocal lattice dimensions in units of [[spatial frequency]]. It is a matter of taste which definition of the lattice is used, as long as the two are not mixed.

Each point &lt;math&gt;(hkl)&lt;/math&gt; in the reciprocal lattice corresponds to a set of lattice planes &lt;math&gt;(hkl)&lt;/math&gt; in the [[space|real space]] lattice. The direction of the reciprocal lattice vector corresponds to the [[Surface normal|normal]] to the real space planes. The magnitude of the reciprocal lattice vector is given in [[reciprocal length]] and is equal to the reciprocal of the interplanar spacing of the real space planes.

== Reciprocal lattices of various crystals ==

Reciprocal lattices for the [[Cubic (crystal system)|cubic crystal system]] are as follows.

===Simple cubic lattice===

The simple cubic [[Bravais lattice]], with cubic [[primitive cell]] of side &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, has for its reciprocal a simple cubic lattice with a cubic primitive cell of side &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \frac{2\pi}{a}&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;\textstyle \frac{1}{a}&lt;/math&gt; in the crystallographer's definition). The cubic lattice is therefore said to be self-dual, having the same symmetry in reciprocal space as in real space.

===Face-centered cubic (FCC) lattice===

The reciprocal lattice to an FCC lattice is the body-centered cubic (BCC) lattice.

Consider an FCC compound unit cell. Locate a primitive unit cell of the FCC; i.e., a unit cell with one lattice point. Now take one of the vertices of the primitive unit cell as the origin. Give the basis vectors of the real lattice. Then from the known formulae, you can calculate the basis vectors of the reciprocal lattice. These reciprocal lattice vectors of the FCC represent the basis vectors of a BCC real lattice. Note that the basis vectors of a real BCC lattice and the reciprocal lattice of an FCC resemble each other in direction but not in magnitude.

===Body-centered cubic (BCC) lattice===

The reciprocal lattice to a [[Cubic crystal system|BCC]] lattice is the [[Cubic crystal system|FCC]] lattice.

It can be easily proven that only the Bravais lattices which have 90 degrees between &lt;math&gt;\left(\mathbf{a}_1, \mathbf{a}_2, \mathbf{a}_3\right)&lt;/math&gt; (cubic, tetragonal, orthorhombic) have &lt;math&gt;\left(\mathbf{b}_1, \mathbf{b}_2, \mathbf{b}_3\right)&lt;/math&gt; parallel to their real-space vectors.

===Simple hexagonal lattice===

The reciprocal to a simple hexagonal Bravais lattice with [[lattice constants]] c and a is another simple hexagonal lattice with lattice constants &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \frac{2\pi}{c}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \frac{4\pi}{a\sqrt{3}}&lt;/math&gt; rotated through 30° about the c axis with respect to the direct lattice. The simple hexagonal lattice is therefore said to be self-dual, having the same symmetry in reciprocal space as in real space.

===Proof that the reciprocal lattice of the reciprocal lattice is the direct lattice===
From its definition we know that the vectors of the Bravais lattice must be closed under vector addition and subtraction. Thus it is sufficient to say that if we have
:&lt;math&gt;e^{i \mathbf{G}_1 \cdot \mathbf{R}} = 1&lt;/math&gt;

and
:&lt;math&gt;e^{i \mathbf{G}_2 \cdot \mathbf{R}} = 1&lt;/math&gt;

then the sum and difference &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{G}_1 \plusmn \mathbf{G}_2&lt;/math&gt; satisfy the same.

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  e^{i \left(\mathbf{G}_1 + \mathbf{G}_2\right) \mathbf{R}} &amp;= \left(e^{i \mathbf{G}_1 \cdot \mathbf{R}}\right)\left(e^{i \mathbf{G}_2 \cdot \mathbf{R}}\right) = \left(1\right)\left(1\right) = 1 \\
  e^{i \left(\mathbf{G}_1 - \mathbf{G}_2\right) \cdot \mathbf{R}} &amp;= \frac{e^{i \mathbf{G}_1 \cdot \mathbf{R}}}{e^{i \mathbf{G}_2 \cdot \mathbf{R}}} = 1
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Thus we have shown the reciprocal lattice is closed under vector addition and subtraction. Furthermore, we know that a vector '''G''' in the reciprocal lattice can be expressed as a linear combination of its [[Wigner–Seitz cell#Primitive cell|primitive vectors]].

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{G} = k_1\mathbf{b}_1 + k_2\mathbf{b}_2 + k_3\mathbf{b}_3&lt;/math&gt;

From our earlier definition of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{b}_1&lt;/math&gt;, we can see that:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{b}_i \cdot \mathbf{a}_j = 2\pi\delta_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\delta_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Kronecker delta]]. We let '''R''' be a vector in the direct lattice, which we can express as a linear combination of ''its'' primitive vectors.

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R} = n_1\mathbf{a}_1 + n_2\mathbf{a}_2 + n_3\mathbf{a}_3&lt;/math&gt;

From this we can see that:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{G} \cdot \mathbf{R} = 2\pi(k_1 n_1 + k_2 n_2 + k_3 n_3)&lt;/math&gt;

From our definition of the reciprocal lattice we have shown that &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{G}&lt;/math&gt; must satisfy the following identity.

:&lt;math&gt;e^{i \mathbf{G} \cdot \mathbf{R}} = 1&lt;/math&gt;

For this to hold we must have &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{G} \cdot \mathbf{R}&lt;/math&gt; equal to &lt;math&gt;2\pi&lt;/math&gt; times an integer. This is fulfilled because &lt;math&gt;n_i \in \mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;k_i \in \mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, the reciprocal lattice is also a Bravais lattice.

Furthermore, if the vectors &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{G}&lt;/math&gt; construct a reciprocal lattice, it is clear that any vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{K}&lt;/math&gt; satisfying the equation:

:&lt;math&gt;e^{i \mathbf{K} \cdot \mathbf{G}} = 1&lt;/math&gt;

… is a reciprocal lattice vector of the reciprocal lattice. Due to the definition of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{G}&lt;/math&gt;, when &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{K}&lt;/math&gt; is the direct lattice vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}&lt;/math&gt;, we have the same relationship.

:&lt;math&gt;e^{i \mathbf{R} \cdot \mathbf{G}} = 1&lt;/math&gt;

And so we can conclude that the reciprocal lattice of the reciprocal lattice is the original direct lattice.

==Arbitrary collection of atoms==

[[File:Shadint3.gif|right|frame|Shadow of a 118-atom faceted carbon-pentacone's intensity reciprocal-lattice lighting up red in diffraction when intersecting the Ewald sphere.]]

One path to the reciprocal lattice of an arbitrary collection of atoms comes from the idea of scattered waves in the [[Fraunhofer diffraction|Fraunhofer]] (long-distance or lens back-focal-plane) limit as a [[Huygens–Fresnel principle|Huygens-style]] sum of amplitudes from all points of scattering (in this case from each individual atom).&lt;ref&gt;B. E. Warren (1969/1990) ''X-ray diffraction'' (Addison-Wesley, Reading MA/Dover, Mineola NY).&lt;/ref&gt;  This sum is denoted by the [[complex amplitude]] F in the equation below, because it is also the Fourier transform (as a function of spatial frequency or reciprocal distance) of an effective scattering potential in direct space:

:&lt;math&gt;F[\vec{g}] = \sum_{j=1}^N f_j \left[\vec{g}\right] e^{2 \pi i \vec{g} \cdot \vec{r}_j}.&lt;/math&gt;

Here '''g''' = '''q'''/(2π) is the scattering vector '''q''' in crystallographer units, N is the number of atoms, f&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;['''g'''] is the [[atomic scattering factor]] for atom j and scattering vector '''g''', while '''r'''&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; is the vector position of atom j.  Note that the Fourier phase depends on one's choice of coordinate origin.

For the special case of an infinite periodic crystal, the scattered amplitude F = M F&lt;sub&gt;hkl&lt;/sub&gt; from M unit cells (as in the cases above) turns out to be non-zero only for integer values of &lt;math&gt;(hkl)&lt;/math&gt;, where

:&lt;math&gt;F_{hkl} = \sum_{j=1}^m f_j\left[g_{hkl}\right] e^{2\pi i \left(h u_j + k v_j + l w_j\right)}&lt;/math&gt;

when there are j=1,m atoms inside the unit cell whose fractional lattice indices are respectively {u&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;, v&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;, w&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;}.  To consider effects due to finite crystal size, of course, a shape convolution for each point or the equation above for a finite lattice must be used instead.

Whether the array of atoms is finite or infinite, one can also imagine an "intensity reciprocal lattice" I['''g'''], which relates to the amplitude lattice F via the usual relation I = F&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;F where F&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; is the complex conjugate of F.  Since Fourier transformation is reversible, of course, this act of conversion to intensity tosses out "all except 2nd moment" (i.e. the phase) information.  For the case of an arbitrary collection of atoms, the intensity reciprocal lattice is therefore:

:&lt;math&gt;I[\vec{g}] = \sum_{j=1}^N \sum_{k=1}^N f_j \left[\vec{g}\right] f_k \left[\vec{g}\right] e^{2 \pi i \vec{g} \cdot \vec{r}_{jk}}.&lt;/math&gt;

Here '''r'''&lt;sub&gt;jk&lt;/sub&gt; is the vector separation between atom j and atom k.  One can also use this to predict the effect of nano-crystallite shape, and subtle changes in beam orientation, on detected diffraction peaks even if in some directions the cluster is only one atom thick.  On the down side, scattering calculations using the reciprocal lattice basically consider an incident plane wave.  Thus after a first look at reciprocal lattice (kinematic scattering) effects, beam broadening and multiple scattering (i.e. [[Dynamical theory of diffraction|dynamical]]) effects may be important to consider as well.

==Generalization of a dual lattice==

There are actually two versions in [[mathematics]] of the abstract '''dual lattice''' concept, for a given [[lattice (group)|lattice]] ''L'' in a real [[vector space]] ''V'', of [[vector space dimension|finite dimension]].

The first, which generalises directly the reciprocal lattice construction, uses [[Fourier analysis]]. It may be stated simply in terms of [[Pontryagin duality]]. The [[Pontryagin duality|dual group]] ''V''^ to ''V'' is again a real vector space, and its closed subgroup ''L''^ dual to ''L'' turns out to be a lattice in ''V''^. Therefore, ''L''^ is the natural candidate for ''dual lattice'', in a different vector space (of the same dimension).

The other aspect is seen in the presence of a [[quadratic form]] ''Q'' on ''V''; if it is [[non-degenerate]] it allows an identification of the [[dual space]] ''V''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; of ''V'' with ''V''. The relation of ''V''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; to ''V'' is not intrinsic; it depends on a choice of [[Haar measure]] (volume element) on ''V''. But given an identification of the two, which is in any case [[well-defined]] up to a [[scalar (mathematics)|scalar]], the presence of ''Q'' allows one to speak to the dual lattice to ''L'' while staying within ''V''.

In [[mathematics]], the '''dual lattice''' of a given [[lattice (discrete subgroup)|lattice]] ''L'' in an [[abelian group|abelian]] [[locally compact space|locally compact]] [[topological group]] ''G'' is the subgroup ''L''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; of the [[Pontryagin duality|dual group]] of ''G'' consisting of all continuous characters that are equal to one at each point of ''L''.

In discrete mathematics, a lattice is a locally discrete set of points described by all integral linear combinations of dim = n linearly independent vectors in R&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;.  The dual lattice is then defined by all points in the linear span of the original lattice (typically all of R^n) with the property that an integer results from the inner product with all elements of the original lattice.  It follows that the dual of the dual lattice is the original lattice.

Furthermore, if we allow the matrix B to have columns as the linearly independent vectors that describe the lattice, then the matrix

&lt;math&gt;A = B\left(B^\mathsf{T} B\right)^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;
has columns of vectors that describe the dual lattice.

==Reciprocal space==
Reciprocal space (also called "k-space") is the space in which the Fourier transform of a spatial function is represented (similarly the [[frequency domain]] is the space in which the Fourier transform of a time dependent function is represented).  A Fourier transform takes us from "real space" to reciprocal space or ''vice versa''. Reciprocal space comes into play regarding wave-mechanics: As a [[plane wave]] can be written by an oscillatory term &lt;math&gt;e^{i(kx - \omega t)}&lt;/math&gt; with wave vector &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; and angular frequency &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;, it can be regarded as both a function of &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; (and the spectroscopic part as a function of both &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;). In space, the periodicity oscillates with &lt;math&gt;kx = 2\pi&lt;/math&gt; - therefore for a given phase, &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; are reciprocal to each other: &lt;math&gt;k = 2\pi/x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x = 2\pi/k&lt;/math&gt;.

A reciprocal lattice is a periodic set of points in this space, and contains the &lt;math&gt;\vec{k}&lt;/math&gt; points that compose the Fourier transform of a periodic spatial lattice. The [[Brillouin zone]] is a volume within this space that contains all the unique k-vectors that represent the periodicity of classical or quantum waves allowed in a periodic structure.

{{Redirect|Enumerable set|the set-theoretic concept|Countable set}}
In [[computability theory]], traditionally called recursion theory, a set ''S'' of [[natural numbers]] is called '''recursively enumerable''', '''computably enumerable''', '''semidecidable''',  '''provable''' or '''Turing-recognizable''' if:

*There is an [[algorithm]] such that the set of input numbers for which the algorithm halts is exactly ''S''. 

Or, equivalently,

*There is an algorithm that [[enumeration|enumerates]] the members of ''S''.  That means that its output is simply a list of the members of ''S'':  ''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''s''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''s''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, ... .  If necessary, this algorithm may run forever.  

The first condition suggests why the term ''semidecidable'' is sometimes used; the second suggests why ''computably enumerable'' is used.    The abbreviations '''r.e.''' and '''c.e.''' are often used, even in print, instead of the full phrase.

In [[computational complexity theory]], the  [[complexity class]] containing all recursively enumerable sets is [[RE (complexity)|RE]].  In [[recursion theory]], the [[Lattice (order)|lattice]] of r.e. sets under inclusion is denoted &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E}&lt;/math&gt;.

== Formal definition ==

A set ''S'' of natural numbers is called '''recursively enumerable''' if there is a [[partial recursive function]] whose [[domain (mathematics)|domain]] is exactly ''S'', meaning that the function is defined if and only if its input is a member of ''S''.

==Equivalent formulations==
The following are all equivalent properties of a set ''S'' of natural numbers:

:Semidecidability:
:*The set ''S'' is recursively enumerable. That is, ''S'' is the domain (co-range) of a partial recursive function.
:*There is a partial recursive function ''f'' such that:
::&lt;math&gt;f(x) = 
\left\{\begin{matrix} 
1 &amp;\mbox{if}\ x \in S \\
\mbox{undefined/does not halt}\ &amp;\mbox{if}\ x \notin S
\end{matrix}\right.
&lt;/math&gt;
:Enumerability:
:*The set ''S'' is the range of a partial recursive function.
:*The set ''S'' is the range of a total recursive function or empty. If ''S'' is infinite, the function can be chosen to be [[injective]].
:*The set ''S'' is the range of a [[primitive recursive function]] or empty. Even if ''S'' is infinite, repetition of values may be necessary in this case.
:Diophantine:
:*There is a polynomial ''p'' with integer coefficients and variables ''x'', ''a'', ''b'', ''c'', ''d'', ''e'', ''f'', ''g'', ''h'', ''i'' ranging over the natural numbers such that
::&lt;math&gt;x \in S \Leftrightarrow \exists a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i \ ( p(x,a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i) = 0).&lt;/math&gt;
:*There is a polynomial from the integers to the integers such that the set ''S'' contains exactly the non-negative numbers in its range.

The equivalence of semidecidability and enumerability can be obtained by the technique of [[Dovetailing_(computer_science)|dovetailing]].

The Diophantine characterizations of a recursively enumerable set, while not as straightforward or intuitive as the first definitions, were found by [[Yuri Matiyasevich]] as part of the negative solution to [[Hilbert's tenth problem|Hilbert's Tenth Problem]]. Diophantine sets predate recursion theory and are therefore historically the first way to describe these sets (although this equivalence was only remarked more than three decades after the introduction of recursively enumerable sets).
The number of bound variables in the above definition of the [[Diophantine set]] is the best known so far; it might be that a lower number can be used to define all diophantine sets.

|}

==Examples==
* Every [[recursive set]] is recursively enumerable, but it is not true that every recursively enumerable set is recursive. For recursive sets, the algorithm must also say if an input is ''not'' in the set – this is not required of recursively enumerable sets.
* A [[recursively enumerable language]] is a recursively enumerable subset of a [[formal language]].
* The set of all provable sentences in an effectively presented axiomatic system is a recursively enumerable set.
* [[Matiyasevich's theorem]] states that every recursively enumerable set is a [[Diophantine set]] (the converse is trivially true).
* The [[simple set]]s are recursively enumerable but not recursive.
* The [[creative set]]s are recursively enumerable but not recursive.
* Any [[productive set]] is '''not''' recursively enumerable.
* Given a [[Gödel numbering]] &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; of the computable functions, the set &lt;math&gt;\{\langle i,x \rangle \mid \phi_i(x) \downarrow \}&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt;\langle i,x \rangle&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Cantor pairing function]] and &lt;math&gt;\phi_i(x)\downarrow&lt;/math&gt; indicates &lt;math&gt;\phi_i(x)&lt;/math&gt; is defined) is recursively enumerable (cf. picture for a fixed ''x''). This set encodes the [[halting problem]] as it describes  the input parameters for which each [[Turing machine]] halts.
* Given a Gödel numbering &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; of the computable functions, the set  &lt;math&gt;\lbrace \left \langle x, y, z \right \rangle \mid \phi_x(y)=z \rbrace&lt;/math&gt; is recursively enumerable. This set encodes the problem of deciding a function value.
* Given a partial function ''f'' from the natural numbers into the natural numbers, ''f'' is a partial recursive function if and only if the graph of ''f'',  that is, the set of all pairs &lt;math&gt;\langle x,f(x)\rangle&lt;/math&gt; such that ''f(x)'' is defined, is recursively enumerable.

==Properties==

If ''A'' and ''B'' are recursively enumerable sets then ''A'' ∩ ''B'', ''A'' ∪ ''B'' and ''A'' × ''B'' (with the ordered pair of natural numbers mapped to a single natural number with the [[Cantor pairing function]]) are recursively enumerable sets. The [[preimage]] of a recursively enumerable set under a partial recursive function is a recursively enumerable set.

A set is recursively enumerable if and only if it is at level &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^0_1&lt;/math&gt; of the [[arithmetical hierarchy]].

A set &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is called '''co-recursively enumerable''' or '''co-r.e.''' if its [[complement (set theory)|complement]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N} \setminus T&lt;/math&gt; is recursively enumerable. Equivalently, a set is co-r.e. if and only if it is at level &lt;math&gt;\Pi^0_1&lt;/math&gt; of the arithmetical hierarchy.

A set ''A'' is [[recursive set|recursive]] (synonym: computable) if and only if both ''A'' and the complement of ''A'' are recursively enumerable. A set is recursive if and only if it is either the range of an increasing total recursive function or finite.

Some pairs of recursively enumerable sets are [[effectively separable]] and some are not.

== Remarks ==
According to  the [[Church–Turing thesis]], any effectively calculable function is calculable by a [[Turing machine]], and thus a set ''S'' is recursively enumerable if and only if there is some [[algorithm]] which yields an enumeration of ''S''.  This cannot be taken as a formal definition, however, because the Church–Turing thesis is an informal conjecture rather than a formal axiom.

The definition of a recursively enumerable set as the ''domain'' of a partial function, rather than the ''range'' of a total recursive function, is common in contemporary texts.  This choice is motivated by the fact that in generalized recursion theories, such as [[Alpha recursion theory|α-recursion theory]], the definition corresponding to domains has been found to be more natural.  Other texts use the definition in terms of enumerations, which is equivalent for recursively enumerable sets.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8758">In [[mathematics]], '''representation''' is a very general relationship that expresses similarities between objects. Roughly speaking, a collection ''Y'' of mathematical objects may be said to ''represent'' another collection ''X'' of objects, provided that the properties and relationships existing among the representing objects ''y&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' conform in some consistent way to those existing among the corresponding represented objects ''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''. Somewhat more formally, for a set ''Π'' of properties and [[relation (mathematics)|relations]], a ''Π''-representation of some structure ''X'' is a structure ''Y'' that is the image of ''X'' under a [[homomorphism]] that preserves ''Π''. The label ''representation'' is sometimes also applied to the homomorphism itself.

== Representation theory ==
Perhaps the most well-developed example of this general notion is the subfield of [[abstract algebra]] called '''[[representation theory]]''', which studies the representing of elements of [[algebraic structures]] by [[linear transformations]] of [[vector spaces]].

== Other examples ==

Although the term ''representation theory'' is well established in the algebraic sense discussed above, there are many other uses of the term ''representation'' throughout mathematics.

=== Graph theory ===
An active area of [[graph theory]] is the exploration of isomorphisms between [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graphs]] and other structures.
A key class of such problems stems from the fact that, like [[adjacency relation|adjacency]] in [[undirected graph]]s, [[intersection (mathematics)|intersection]] of sets
(or, more precisely, [[disjoint sets|non-disjointness]]) is a [[symmetric relation]].
This gives rise to the study of [[intersection graph]]s for innumerable families of sets.&lt;ref&gt;*{{citation

 | isbn = 0-89871-430-3 |mr=1672910 | doi=10.1137/1.9780898719802}}&lt;/ref&gt;
One foundational result here, due to [[Paul Erdős]] and colleagues, is that every ''n''-[[vertex (graph theory)|vertex]] graph may be represented in terms of intersection among [[subsets]] of a set of size no more than ''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/4.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

 |mr=0186575 | doi=10.4153/cjm-1966-014-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Representing a graph by such algebraic structures as its [[adjacency matrix]] and [[Laplacian matrix]] gives rise to the field of [[spectral graph theory]].&lt;ref&gt;*{{citation

 | year = 1994
 | publisher = Cambridge University Press
 |mr=1271140
 | isbn = 978-0-521-45897-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Order theory ===
[[Dual (mathematics)|Dual]] to the observation above that every graph is an intersection graph
is the fact that every [[partially ordered set]] is isomorphic to a collection of sets ordered by the [[subset|containment]] (or inclusion) relation ⊆.
Among the posets that arise as the [[containment order]]s for natural classes of objects are the [[Boolean lattice]]s and the  [[order dimension|orders of dimension ''n'']].&lt;ref&gt;*{{citation

 | isbn = 978-0-8018-4425-6
 |mr=1169299}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many partial orders arise from (and thus can be represented by) collections of [[geometry|geometric]] objects.
Among them are the [[n-sphere#n-ball|''n''-ball]] orders.
The 1-ball orders are the interval-containment orders,
and the 2-ball orders are the so-called ''circle orders'',
the posets representable in terms of containment among disks in the plane.
A particularly nice result in this field is the characterization of the [[planar graph]]s as those graphs
whose vertex-edge incidence relations are circle orders.&lt;ref&gt;*{{citation

 |mr=1105950
 | doi = 10.1137/0404040}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also geometric representations that are not based on containment.
Indeed, one of the best studied classes among these are the [[interval order]]s,&lt;ref&gt;*{{citation
 | last = Fishburn | first = Peter C.
 | title = Interval Orders and Interval Graphs: A Study of Partially Ordered Sets
 | series = Wiley-Interscience Series in Discrete Mathematics
 | year = 1985
 | publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons
 |mr=0776781
 | isbn = 978-0-471-81284-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
which represent the partial order in terms of what might be called ''disjoint precedence'' of intervals on the [[real line]]:
each element ''x'' of the poset is represented by an interval [''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] such that
for any ''y'' and ''z'' in the poset, ''y'' is below ''z'' if and only if ''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; ''z''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.

=== Polysemy ===
Under certain circumstances, a single function ''f'':''X'' → ''Y'' is at once an isomorphism from several mathematical structures on ''X''.
Since each of those structures may be thought of, intuitively, as a meaning of the image ''Y''—one of the things that ''Y'' is trying to tell us—this phenomenon is called '''polysemy''',
a [[polysemy|term borrowed from linguistics]].
Examples include:

* '''intersection polysemy'''—pairs of graphs ''G''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''G''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; on a common vertex set ''V'' that can be simultaneously represented by a single collection of sets ''S&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;'' such that any distinct vertices ''u'' and ''w'' in ''V''...
::are adjacent in ''G''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; if and only if their corresponding sets intersect ( ''S&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;'' ∩ ''S&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;'' ≠  Ø ),  and
::are adjacent in ''G''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; if and only if the [[set complement|complements]] do ( ''S&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt; ∩ ''S&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt; ≠  Ø ).&lt;ref&gt;*{{citation

A pair of graphs ''G''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''G''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; on one vertex set is competition polysemic if and only if there exists a single [[directed graph]] ''D'' on the same vertex set such that any distinct vertices ''u'' and ''v''...
::are adjacent in ''G''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; if and only if there is a vertex ''w'' such that both ''uw'' and ''vw'' are [[arc (graph theory)|arc]]s in ''D'', and

In 1978, he wrote a paper describing a method to efficiently compute strongly connected members of a [[directed graph]], a method later called [[Kosaraju's algorithm]]. Along with Paul Callahan he published many articles on efficient algorithms for computing the [[well-separated pair decomposition]] of a point set. His research efforts include efficient algorithms for pattern matching, data structure simulations, universal graphs, DNA sequence assembly, derandomization and investigations of immune system responses.&lt;ref name="jhu"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~kosaraju/|title=S.

In 1995 he was inducted as a [[List of Fellows of the Association for Computing Machinery|Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery]]. He is also a fellow of the [[IEEE]]. A common saying at [[Johns Hopkins University]], "At some point, the learning stops and the pain begins." has been attributed to him. There used to be a shrine in the [http://cs.jhu.edu/lab-info/ CS Undergraduate Lab] in his honor.

He was born in [[India]], and he did his bachelors in Engineering from [[Andhra University]], and Masters from [[IIT Kharagpur]], and is a [[PhD]] from [[University of Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref name=jhu /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2852">In [[mathematics]], '''Schur's [[inequality (mathematics)|inequality]]''', named after [[Issai Schur]],
establishes that for all [[Nonnegative number|non-negative]] [[real number]]s
''x'', ''y'', ''z'' and a [[positive number]] ''t'',

:&lt;math&gt;x^t (x-y)(x-z) + y^t (y-z)(y-x) + z^t (z-x)(z-y) \ge 0&lt;/math&gt;

with equality if and only if ''x = y = z'' or two of them are equal and the other is zero. When ''t'' is an even positive [[integer]], the inequality holds for all real numbers ''x'', ''y'' and ''z''.

When &lt;math&gt;t=1&lt;/math&gt;, the following well-known special case can be derived:
:&lt;math&gt;x^3 + y^3 + z^3 + 3xyz \geq xy(x+y) + xz(x+z) + yz(y+z)&lt;/math&gt;

== Proof ==
Since the inequality is symmetric in &lt;math&gt;x,y,z&lt;/math&gt; we may assume without loss of generality that &lt;math&gt; x \geq y \geq z&lt;/math&gt;. Then the inequality

: &lt;math&gt;(x-y)[x^t(x-z)-y^t(y-z)]+z^t(x-z)(y-z) \geq 0&lt;/math&gt;

clearly holds, since every term on the left-hand side of the equation is non-negative. This rearranges to Schur's inequality.

== Extensions ==
A [[generalization]] of Schur's inequality is the following:
Suppose ''a,b,c'' are positive real numbers. If the triples ''(a,b,c)'' and ''(x,y,z)'' are [[Order isomorphic|similarly sorted]], then the following inequality holds:

:&lt;math&gt;a (x-y)(x-z) + b (y-z)(y-x) + c (z-x)(z-y) \ge 0.&lt;/math&gt;

In 2007, [[Romania]]n mathematician [[Valentin Vornicu]] showed that a yet further generalized form of Schur's inequality holds: 

Consider &lt;math&gt;a,b,c,x,y,z \in \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;a \geq b \geq c&lt;/math&gt;, and either &lt;math&gt;x \geq y \geq z&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;z \geq y \geq x&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;k \in \mathbb{Z}^{+}&lt;/math&gt;, and let &lt;math&gt;f:\mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}_{0}^{+}&lt;/math&gt; be either [[convex function|convex]] or [[monotonic]]. Then,
: &lt;math&gt;{f(x)(a-b)^k(a-c)^k+f(y)(b-a)^k(b-c)^k+f(z)(c-a)^k(c-b)^k \geq 0}.&lt;/math&gt;	
The standard form of Schur's is the case of this inequality where ''x'' = ''a'', ''y'' = ''b'', ''z'' = ''c'', ''k'' = 1, ''ƒ''(''m'') = ''m''&lt;sup&gt;''r''&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Vornicu, Valentin; ''Olimpiada de Matematica... de la provocare la experienta''; GIL Publishing House; Zalau, Romania.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another possible extension states that if the non-negative real numbers &lt;math&gt; x \geq y \geq z \geq v &lt;/math&gt; with  and the positive real number ''t'' are such that ''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''v''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;''y''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''z'' then&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Finta|first1=Béla|title=A Schur Type Inequality for Five Variables|journal=Procedia Technology|date=2015|volume=19|pages=799–801|doi=10.1016/j.protcy.2015.02.114|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212017315001152}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;x^t (x-y)(x-z)(x-v) + y^t (y-x)(y-z)(y-v) + z^t (z-x)(z-y)(z-v) + v^t (v-x)(v-y)(v-z) \ge 0. &lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7257">In [[algebraic geometry]], a branch of [[mathematics]], '''Serre duality''' is a [[duality (mathematics)|duality]] present on [[smooth variety|non-singular]] [[projective variety|projective]] [[algebraic variety|algebraic varieties]] ''V'' of dimension ''n'' (and in greater generality for [[vector bundle]]s and further, for [[coherent sheaf|coherent sheaves]]). It shows that a [[cohomology]] group ''H''&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt; is the [[dual space]] of another one, ''H''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&amp;minus;''i''&lt;/sup&gt;.

In the case for [[holomorphic vector bundle]] ''E'' over a smooth compact complex manifold ''V'', the statement is in the form:

:::&lt;math&gt;H^q(V,E)\cong H^{n-q}(V,K\otimes E^{\ast})^{\ast},&lt;/math&gt;

in which ''V'' is not necessarily projective.

==Algebraic curve==
The case of [[algebraic curve]]s was already implicit in the [[Riemann-Roch theorem]]. For a curve ''C'' the coherent groups ''H''&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt; vanish for ''i'' &gt; 1; but ''H''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; does enter implicitly. In fact, the basic relation of the theorem involves ''l''(''D'') and ''l''(''K''&amp;minus;''D''), where ''D'' is a [[divisor]] and ''K'' is a divisor of the [[canonical class]]. After [[Jean-Pierre Serre|Serre]] we recognise ''l''(''K''&amp;minus;''D'') as the dimension of ''H''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;(''D''), where now ''D'' means the [[line bundle]] determined by the divisor ''D''. That is, Serre duality in this case relates groups ''H''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;(''D'') and ''H''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;(''KD''*), and we are reading off dimensions (notation: ''K'' is the canonical line bundle, ''D''* is the dual line bundle, and juxtaposition is the [[tensor product]] of line bundles).

In this formulation the Riemann-Roch theorem can be viewed as a computation of the [[Euler characteristic of a sheaf]]

:''h''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;(''D'') &amp;minus; ''h''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;(''D''),

in terms of the [[genus (mathematics)|genus]] of the curve, which is

:''h''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;(''C'',''O''&lt;sub&gt;''C''&lt;/sub&gt;),

and the degree of ''D''. It is this expression that can be generalised to higher dimensions.

Serre duality of curves is therefore something very classical; but it has an interesting light to cast. For example, in [[Riemann surface]] theory, the [[deformation theory]] of complex structures is studied classically by means of [[quadratic differential]]s (namely sections of ''L''(''K''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)). The [[deformation theory]] of [[Kunihiko Kodaira]] and [[D. C. Spencer]] identifies deformations via ''H''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;(''T''), where ''T'' is the [[tangent bundle]] sheaf ''K''*. The duality shows why these approaches coincide.

==Algebraic Geometry==
There is an algebrogeometric analogue of Serre duality for equidimensional projective schemes &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; over an algebraically closed field &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hartshorne|first1=Robin|title=Algebraic Geometry|pages=241–243}}&lt;/ref&gt; if we suppose &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}_X(1)&lt;/math&gt; is very ample (meaning it gives the embedding of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; into &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{P}^m&lt;/math&gt;) there this a sheaf &lt;math&gt;\omega_X^\circ&lt;/math&gt; called the '''[[dualizing sheaf]]''' such that for every coherent sheaf &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F} \in \textbf{Coh}(X)&lt;/math&gt; there are functorial maps
:&lt;math&gt;\theta^i:\text{Ext}^i(\mathcal{F},\omega_X^\circ) \to H^{n-i}(X,\mathcal{F})^*&lt;/math&gt;
which are isomorphisms. These dualizing sheaves can be computed as
:&lt;math&gt;
\omega_X^\circ = \mathcal{Ext}^r_{\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^m}}(\mathcal{O}_X,\omega_{\mathbb{P}^m}),
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is the codimension of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{P}^m&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a local complete intersection, then the Koszul complex of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}_X&lt;/math&gt; can be used to compute this Ext group (since it is a locally-free resolution of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}_X&lt;/math&gt;), giving
:&lt;math&gt;
\mathcal{Ext}^r_{\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^m}}(\mathcal{O}_X,\omega_{\mathbb{P}^m}) = \omega_X^\circ \cong \omega_{\mathbb{P}^m}\otimes \bigwedge^r(\mathcal{I}/\mathcal{I}^2)^*,
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I}&lt;/math&gt; is the ideal sheaf of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.

===Example===
Consider a [[local complete intersection]] &lt;math&gt;X \subset \mathbb{P}^m&lt;/math&gt; with presentation given by the ideal &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I} = (f_1,\ldots,f_r)&lt;/math&gt; generated by forms of degrees &lt;math&gt;d_1,\ldots,d_r&lt;/math&gt;. Then,
:&lt;math&gt; \mathcal{I}/\mathcal{I}^2 \cong \mathcal{O}_X(-d_1)\oplus \cdots \oplus \mathcal{O}_X(-d_r)&lt;/math&gt;
giving us that
:&lt;math&gt;\bigwedge^r(\mathcal{I}/\mathcal{I}^2)^*\cong \mathcal{O}_X(d_1 + \cdots + d_r). &lt;/math&gt;
Since &lt;math&gt;\omega_{\mathbb{P}^m}|_X \cong \mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^m}(-m-1)|_X&lt;/math&gt; we get
:&lt;math&gt;
\omega_X^\circ \cong \mathcal{O}_X(d_1 + \cdots + d_r - m - 1) 
&lt;/math&gt;
as the dualizing sheaf. For example, the dualizing sheaf of a plane curve of degree &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; is given by &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}_X(d-3)&lt;/math&gt;. This is a special case of the proof of the [[Adjunction formula|adjunction formula]], which uses the [[Cotangent_complex|second fundamental (conormal) exact sequence]]. This sequence is exact on the left when &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is (locally) a complete intersection.

==Origin and generalisations==
The origin of the theory lies in Serre's earlier work on [[several complex variables]]. In the generalisation of [[Alexander Grothendieck]], Serre duality becomes a part of [[coherent duality]] in a much broader setting. While the role of ''K'' above in general Serre duality is played by the [[determinant line bundle]] of the [[cotangent bundle]], when ''V'' is a manifold, in full generality ''K'' cannot merely be a ''single'' sheaf in the absence of some hypothesis of [[non-singular]]ity on ''V''. The formulation in full generality uses a [[derived category]] and [[Ext functor]]s, to allow for the fact that ''K'' is now represented by a [[chain complex]] of sheaves, namely, the [[dualizing complex]]. Nevertheless, the statement of the theorem is recognisably Serre's.

In [[numerical analysis]], '''Simpson's  rule''' is a method for [[numerical integration]], the numerical approximation of [[definite integral]]s. Specifically, it is the following approximation for &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; equally spaced subdivisions (where &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is even): (General Form)

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{a}^{b} f(x) \, dx \approx \tfrac{\Delta x}{3}\left(f(x_0) + 4f(x_1)+2f(x_2)+ 4f(x_3)+2f(x_4)+\cdots+4f(x_{n-1}) + f(x_{n})\right)&lt;/math&gt;,
where &lt;math&gt;\Delta x = \frac{b-a}{n}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x_i=a+i\Delta x&lt;/math&gt;.

For unequally spaced points, see Cartwright.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cartwright|first=Kenneth V.|year=2016|title=Simpson's Rule Integration with MS Excel and Irregularly-spaced Data|url=http://msme.us/2016-2-3.pdf|journal=Journal of Mathematical Science and Mathematics Education|volume=11|issue=2|pages=34–42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Simpson's rule also corresponds to the three-point [[Newton–Cotes formulas|Newton-Cotes quadrature rule]].

In English, the method is credited to the mathematician [[Thomas Simpson]] (1710–1761) of Leicestershire, England. However, [[Johannes Kepler]] used similar formulas over 100 years prior, and for this reason the method is sometimes called '''Kepler's rule''', or ''Keplersche Fassregel'' (Kepler's barrel rule) in German.



===Quadratic interpolation===

One derivation replaces the integrand  &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; by the [[quadratic polynomial]] (i.e. parabola)&lt;math&gt;P(x)&lt;/math&gt; which takes the same values as &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; at the end points ''a'' and ''b'' and the midpoint ''m'' = (''a''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''b'') / 2. One can use [[Lagrange polynomial|Lagrange polynomial interpolation]] to find an expression for this polynomial,
:&lt;math&gt; P(x) = f(a) \tfrac{(x-m)(x-b)}{(a-m)(a-b)} + f(m) \tfrac{(x-a)(x-b)}{(m-a)(m-b)} + f(b) \tfrac{(x-a)(x-m)}{(b-a)(b-m)}.
&lt;/math&gt;
Using [[integration by substitution]] one can show that&lt;ref&gt;Atkinson, p. 256; Süli and Mayers, §7.2&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \int_{a}^{b} P(x) \, dx =\tfrac{b-a}{6}\left[f(a) + 4f\left(\tfrac{a+b}{2}\right)+f(b)\right].&lt;/math&gt;
Introducing the step size &lt;math&gt;h=(b-a)/2&lt;/math&gt; this is also commonly written as
:&lt;math&gt; \int_{a}^{b} P(x) \, dx =\tfrac{h}{3}\left[f(a) + 4f\left(\tfrac{a+b}{2}\right)+f(b)\right].&lt;/math&gt;
Because of the &lt;math&gt;1/3&lt;/math&gt; factor Simspon's rule is also referred to as Simpson's 1/3 rule (see below for generalization).

The calculation above can be simplified if one observes that (by scaling) there is [[Without loss of generality|no loss of generality]] in assuming that &lt;math&gt;a=-1&lt;/math&gt;。

===Averaging the midpoint and the trapezoidal rules===

Another derivation constructs Simpson's rule from two simpler approximations: the [[rectangle rule|midpoint rule]]
:&lt;math&gt; M = (b-a) f \left( \tfrac{a+b}{2} \right) &lt;/math&gt;
and the [[trapezoidal rule]]
:&lt;math&gt; T = \tfrac12 (b-a) (f(a)+f(b)). &lt;/math&gt;
The errors in these approximations are
:&lt;math&gt; \tfrac1{24} (b-a)^3 f''(a) + O((b-a)^4) \quad\text{and}\quad -\tfrac1{12} (b-a)^3 f''(a) + O((b-a)^4), &lt;/math&gt;
respectively, where &lt;math&gt; O((b-a)^4) &lt;/math&gt; denotes a term asymptotically proportional to &lt;math&gt; (b-a)^4 &lt;/math&gt;. The two &lt;math&gt; O((b-a)^4) &lt;/math&gt; terms are not equal; see [[Big O notation]] for more details. It follows from the above formulas for the errors of the midpoint and trapezoidal rule that the leading error term vanishes if we take the [[weighted average]]
:&lt;math&gt; \tfrac{2M+T}{3}. &lt;/math&gt;
This weighted average is exactly Simpson's rule.

Using another approximation (for example, the trapezoidal rule with twice as many points), it is possible to take a suitable weighted average and eliminate another error term.  This is [[Romberg's method]].

===Undetermined coefficients===

The third derivation starts from the ''[[ansatz]]''

:&lt;math&gt; \tfrac{1}{b-a} \int_{a}^{b} f(x) \, dx \approx \alpha f(a) + \beta f\left(\tfrac{a+b}{2}\right) + \gamma f(b).&lt;/math&gt;

The coefficients α, β and γ can be fixed by requiring that this approximation be exact for all quadratic polynomials. This yields Simpson's rule.

==Error==

The error in approximating an integral by Simpson's rule is

:&lt;math&gt; -\tfrac{1}{90} \left(\tfrac{b-a}{2}\right)^5 f^{(4)}(\xi), &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt; (the [[Xi (letter)#Lowercase|Greek letter xi]]) is some number between &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Atkinson, equation (5.1.15); Süli and Mayers, Theorem 7.2&lt;/ref&gt;

The error is asymptotically proportional to &lt;math&gt;(b-a)^5&lt;/math&gt;. However, the above derivations suggest an error proportional to &lt;math&gt;(b-a)^4&lt;/math&gt;. Simpson's rule gains an extra order because the points at which the integrand is evaluated are distributed symmetrically in the interval &lt;math&gt;[a,\ b]&lt;/math&gt;.

Since the error term is proportional to the fourth derivative of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt;, this shows that Simpson's rule provides exact results for any polynomial &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; of degree three or less, since the fourth derivative of such a polynomial is zero at all points.

==Composite Simpson's rule==

If the interval of integration &lt;math&gt;[a, b]&lt;/math&gt; is in some sense "small", then Simpson's rule will provide an adequate approximation to the exact integral.  By small, what we really mean is that the function being integrated is relatively smooth over the interval &lt;math&gt;[a, b]&lt;/math&gt;.  For such a function, a smooth quadratic interpolant like the one used in Simpson's rule will give good results.

However, it is often the case that the function we are trying to integrate is not smooth over the interval.  Typically, this means that either the function is highly oscillatory, or it lacks derivatives at certain points.  In these cases, Simpson's rule may give very poor results.  One common way of handling this problem is by breaking up the interval &lt;math&gt;[a, b]&lt;/math&gt; into a number of small subintervals.  Simpson's rule is then applied to each subinterval, with the results being summed to produce an approximation for the integral over the entire interval.  This sort of approach is termed the ''composite Simpson's rule''.

Suppose that the interval &lt;math&gt;[a, b]&lt;/math&gt; is split up into &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; subintervals, with &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; an even number. Then, the composite Simpson's rule is given by

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\int_a^b f(x) \, dx &amp; \approx \frac{h}{3}
\sum_{j=1}^{n/2}\bigg[f(x_{2j-2})+4f(x_{2j-1})+f(x_{2j})\bigg]\\
{} &amp; = \frac{h}{3}
\bigg[f(x_0)+2\sum_{j=1}^{n/2-1}f(x_{2j}) + 4\sum_{j=1}^{n/2}f(x_{2j-1}) + f(x_n)\bigg],
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;x_j=a+jh&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;j=0, 1, ..., n-1, n&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;h=(b-a)/n&lt;/math&gt;; in particular, &lt;math&gt;x_0=a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x_n=b&lt;/math&gt;. This composite rule with &lt;math&gt;n = 2&lt;/math&gt; corresponds with the regular Simpson's Rule of the preceding section.

The error committed by the composite Simpson's rule is

:&lt;math&gt;-\frac{h^4}{180}(b-a)f^{(4)}(\xi),&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt; is some number between &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;h=(b-a)/n&lt;/math&gt; is the "step length".&lt;ref&gt;Atkinson, pp. 257+258; Süli and Mayers, §7.5&lt;/ref&gt; The error is bounded (in absolute value) by

:&lt;math&gt;\tfrac{h^4}{180}(b-a)\max_{\xi\in[a,b]} |f^{(4)}(\xi)|.&lt;/math&gt;

This formulation splits the interval &lt;math&gt;[a,b]&lt;/math&gt; in subintervals of equal length. In practice, it is often advantageous to use subintervals of different lengths, and concentrate the efforts on the places where the integrand is less well-behaved. This leads to the [[adaptive Simpson's method]].

==Simpson's 3/8 rule==

Simpson's 3/8 rule is another method for numerical integration proposed by Thomas Simpson. It is based upon a cubic interpolation rather than a quadratic interpolation. Simpson's 3/8 rule is as follows:
:&lt;math&gt; \int_{a}^{b} f(x) \, dx \approx \tfrac{3h}{8}\left[f(a) + 3f\left(\tfrac{2a+b}{3}\right) + 3f\left(\tfrac{a+2b}{3}\right) + f(b)\right] 
= \tfrac{(b-a)}{8}\left[f(a) + 3f\left(\tfrac{2a+b}{3}\right) + 3f\left(\tfrac{a+2b}{3}\right) + f(b)\right],&lt;/math&gt;
where ''b''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''a''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;3''h''. 
The error of this method is:
:&lt;math&gt;-\tfrac{(b-a)^5}{6480} f^{(4)}(\xi),&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt; is some number between &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, the 3/8 rule is about twice as accurate as the standard method, but it uses one more function value. A composite 3/8 rule also exists, similarly as above.&lt;ref&gt;Matthews (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

A further generalization of this concept for interpolation with arbitrary-degree polynomials are the [[Newton–Cotes formulas]].

=== Composite Simpson's 3/8 rule ===
Dividing the interval &lt;math&gt;[a,b]&lt;/math&gt; into &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; subintervals of length &lt;math&gt;h=(b-a)/n&lt;/math&gt; and introducing the nodes &lt;math&gt;x_i = a + ih&lt;/math&gt; we have

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\int_a^b f(x) \, dx &amp; \approx \tfrac{3h}{8}\left[f(x_0) + 3f(x_1) + 3f(x_2) 
+ 2f(x_3) + 3f(x_4) + 3f(x_5) + 2f(x_6) + \cdots + f(x_n)\right]. \\
&amp; = \frac{3h}{8} \left[ f(x_0) + 3 \sum_{i \ne 3k}^{n-1} f(x_i) + 2 \sum_{j=1}^{n/3 - 1} f(x_{3j}) + f(x_n) \right] \qquad \text{For:  } k \in \mathbb{N}_0
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

While the remainder for the rule is shown as:

:&lt;math&gt;-\frac{h^4}{80}(b-a)f^{(4)}(\xi),&lt;/math&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Matthews (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

Note, we can only use this if &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is a multiple of three.

A simplified version of Simpson's rules is used in naval architecture. The 3/8th rule is also called [[Simpson's rules (ship stability)|Simpson's second rule]].

== Alternative extended Simpson's rule ==
This is another formulation of a composite Simpson's rule: instead of applying Simpson's rule to disjoint segments of the integral to be approximated, Simpson's rule is applied to overlapping segments, yielding:&lt;ref&gt;Press (1989), p. 122&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\int_a^b f(x) \, dx\approx
\tfrac{h}{48}\bigg[17f(x_0)+59f(x_1)+43f(x_2)+49f(x_3)+48 \sum_{i=4}^{n-4} f(x_i)+49f(x_{n-3})+43f(x_{n-2})+59f(x_{n-1})+17f(x_n)\bigg].
&lt;/math&gt;

The formula above is obtained by combining the original composite Simpson's rule with the one consisting of using Simpson's 3/8 rule in the extreme subintervals and the standard 3-point rule in the remaining subintervals. The result is then obtained by taking the mean of the two formulas. 

=== Simpson's rules in the case of narrow peaks ===
In the task of estimation of full area of narrow peak-like functions, Simpson's rules are much less efficient than [[trapezoidal rule]]. Namely, composite Simpson's 1/3 rule requires 1.8 times more points to achieve the same accuracy&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kalambet|first=Yuri|last2=Kozmin|first2=Yuri|last3=Samokhin|first3=Andrey|date=2018|title=Comparison of integration rules in the case of very narrow chromatographic peaks|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0169743917305555|journal=Chemometrics and Intelligent Laboratory Systems|volume=179|pages=22–30|doi=10.1016/j.chemolab.2018.06.001|issn=0169-7439|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as trapezoidal rule. Composite Simpson's 3/8 rule is even less accurate. Integral by Simpson's 1/3 rule can be represented as a sum of 2/3 of integral by trapezoidal rule with step h and 1/3 of integral by rectangle rule with step 2h. No wonder that error of the sum corresponds lo less accurate term. Averaging of Simpson's 1/3 rule composite sums with properly shifted frames produces following rules:

&lt;math&gt;
\int_a^b f(x) \, dx\approx
\tfrac{h}{24}\bigg[-f(x_0)+12f(x_1)+23f(x_2)+24 \sum_{i=2}^{n-2} f(x_i)+23f(x_{n-1})+12f(x_{n})-f(x_{n+1})\bigg]
&lt;/math&gt;

where two points outside of integrated region are exploited and

&lt;math&gt;
\int_a^b f(x) \, dx\approx
\tfrac{h}{24}\bigg[9f(x_1)+28f(x_2)+23f(x_3)+24 \sum_{i=3}^{n-3} f(x_i)+23f(x_{n-2})+28f(x_{n-1})+9f(x_{n})\bigg]
&lt;/math&gt;

Those rules are very much similar to Press's alternative extended Simpson's rule. Coefficients within the major part of the region being integrated equal one, differences are only at the edges. These three rules can be associated with [[Euler-MacLaurin formula]] with the first derivative term and named '''Euler-MacLaurin integration rules'''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. They differ only in the way, how the first derivative at the region end is calculated.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1579">'''Stationary distribution''' may refer to:

* A special distribution for a [[Markov chain#Steady-state analysis and limiting distributions|Markov chain]] such that if the chain starts with its stationary distribution, the marginal distribution of all states at any time will always be the stationary distribution.  Assuming irreducibility, the stationary distribution is always unique if it exists, and its existence can be implied by positive recurrence of all states. The stationary distribution has the interpretation of the [[asymptotic distribution|limiting distribution]] when the chain is ergodic.
* The [[marginal distribution]] of a [[stationary process]] or stationary [[time series]]
* The set of [[joint probability distribution]]s of a [[stationary process]] or stationary [[time series]]

In some fields of application, the term '''stable distribution''' is used for the equivalent of a stationary (marginal) distribution, although in [[probability]] and [[statistics]] the term has a rather different meaning: see [[stable distribution]].

Crudely stated, all of the above are specific cases of a common general concept. A stationary distribution is a specific entity which is unchanged by the effect of some matrix or operator: it need not be unique. Thus stationary distributions are related to [[eigenvector]]s for which the [[eigenvalue]] is unity.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3919">In [[mathematics]], '''Tarski's theorem''', proved by {{harvs|txt|first=Alfred|last= Tarski|authorlink=Alfred Tarski|year=1924}}, states that in [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory|ZF]] the theorem "For every infinite set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, there is a [[bijective map]] between the sets  &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;A\times A&lt;/math&gt;" implies the [[axiom of choice]]. The opposite direction was already known, thus the theorem and axiom of choice are equivalent.

Tarski told {{harvs|first=Jan|last=Mycielski|authorlink=Jan Mycielski|year=2006|txt}} that when he tried to publish the theorem in [[Comptes Rendus de l'Académie des Sciences]] Paris, [[Maurice René Fréchet|Fréchet]] and [[Henri Lebesgue|Lebesgue]] refused to present it. Fréchet wrote that an implication between two well known propositions is not a new result. Lebesgue wrote that an implication between two false propositions is of no interest.

== Proof ==
Our goal is to prove that the axiom of choice is implied by the statement "For every infinite set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;: &lt;math&gt;|A|=|A\times A|&lt;/math&gt;".
It is known that the [[well-ordering theorem]] is equivalent to the axiom of choice, thus it is enough to show that the statement implies that for every set &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; there exist a [[well-order]].

For finite sets it is trivial, thus we will assume that &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; is infinite.

Since the collection of all [[Ordinal number|ordinals]] such that there exist a [[surjective function]] from &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; to the ordinal is a set, there exist a minimal non-zero ordinal, &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;, such that there is no [[surjective function]] from &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;.
We assume [[without loss of generality]] that the sets &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; are [[Disjoint sets|disjoint]].
By our initial assumption, &lt;math&gt;|B \cup \beta|=|(B \cup \beta) \times (B \cup \beta)|&lt;/math&gt;, thus there exists a [[bijection]] &lt;math&gt;f: B \cup \beta \to (B \cup \beta) \times (B \cup \beta)&lt;/math&gt;.

For every &lt;math&gt; x \in B&lt;/math&gt;, it is impossible that &lt;math&gt; \beta \times \{x\} \subseteq f[B]&lt;/math&gt;, because otherwise we could define a surjective function from &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;.
Therefore, there exists at least one ordinal &lt;math&gt;\gamma \in \beta&lt;/math&gt;, such that &lt;math&gt; f(\gamma) \in \beta \times \{x\}&lt;/math&gt;, thus the set &lt;math&gt; S_x=\{\gamma | f(\gamma) \in \beta \times \{x\}\}&lt;/math&gt; is not empty.

With this fact in our mind we can define a new function: &lt;math&gt; g(x)=\min S_x&lt;/math&gt;.
This function is well defined since &lt;math&gt;S_x&lt;/math&gt; is a non-empty set of ordinals, hence it has a minimum.
Recall that for every &lt;math&gt;x,y \in B, x \neq y&lt;/math&gt; the sets &lt;math&gt;S_x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; S_y&lt;/math&gt; are disjoint.
Therefore, we can define a well order on &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;, for every &lt;math&gt;x, y \in B&lt;/math&gt; we shall define &lt;math&gt;x \leq y \iff g(x) \leq g(y)&lt;/math&gt;, since the image of &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. &lt;math&gt;g[B]&lt;/math&gt;, is a set of ordinals and therefore well ordered.

'''Ten15''' is an algebraically specified [[abstract machine]]. It was developed by Foster, Currie et al. at the [[Royal Signals and Radar Establishment]] at [[Malvern, Worcestershire]], during the 1980s. It arose from earlier work on the [[Flex machine]], which was a [[capability (computers)|capability computer]] implemented via [[microcode]]. Ten15 was intended to offer an intermediate language common to all implementations of the Flex architecture for portability purposes. It had the side effect of making the benefits of that work available on modern processors lacking a microcode facility.

Ten15 served as an intermediate language for compilers, but with several unique features, some of which have still to see the light of day in everyday systems. Firstly, it was strongly typed, yet wide enough in application to support most languages — C being an exception, chiefly because C deliberately treats an array similar to a pointer to the first element of that array. This ultimately led to Ten15's development into [[TenDRA Distribution Format|TDF]], which in turn formed the basis for [[Architecture Neutral Distribution Format|ANDF]]. Secondly, it offered a persistent, write-only filestore mechanism, allowing arbitrary data structures to be written and retrieved without conversion into an external representation.

== Historical note ==
Why 'Ten15'? Nic Peeling reports that during early discussions of the concepts of Ten15, it was agreed that this was important and should have a name - but what? [[Ian Currie (computer scientist)|Ian Currie]] looked up at the clock and said 'Why not call it 10:15?'{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\sin X &amp; = X - \frac{X^3}{3!} + \frac{X^5}{5!} - \frac{X^7}{7!} + \cdots &amp; = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^n}{(2n+1)!}X^{2n+1} \\
\cos X &amp; = I - \frac{X^2}{2!} + \frac{X^4}{4!} - \frac{X^6}{6!} + \cdots &amp; = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^n}{(2n)!}X^{2n}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
with {{math|''X&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;''}} being the {{mvar|n}}th [[Matrix multiplication#Powers of matrices|power]] of the matrix {{mvar|X}}, and {{mvar|I}} being the [[identity matrix]] of appropriate dimensions. 

Equivalently, they can be defined using the [[matrix exponential]] along with the matrix equivalent of [[Euler's formula]], {{math|''e&lt;sup&gt;iX&lt;/sup&gt;'' {{=}} cos ''X'' + ''i'' sin ''X''}}, yielding 
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\sin X &amp; = {e^{iX} - e^{-iX} \over 2i} \\
\cos X &amp; = {e^{iX} + e^{-iX} \over 2}.

:&lt;math&gt; 
  \sigma_1 = \sigma_x =
    \begin{pmatrix}
      0&amp;1\\

one has

  \sin(\theta \sigma_1) =     \sin(\theta)~ \sigma_1 , \qquad  \cos (\theta \sigma_1) =     \cos (\theta)~I~,
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{sinc}( \theta \sigma_1) =\operatorname{sinc}( \theta) ~I.   &lt;/math&gt;

==Properties==
The analog of the [[Pythagorean trigonometric identity]] holds:&lt;ref name="Higham" /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\sin^2 X + \cos^2 X = I&lt;/math&gt;

If {{mvar|X}} is a [[diagonal matrix]], {{math|sin ''X''}} and {{math|cos ''X''}} are also diagonal matrices with {{math|(sin ''X'')&lt;sub&gt;''nn''&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} sin(''X&lt;sub&gt;nn&lt;/sub&gt;'')}} and {{math|(cos ''X'')&lt;sub&gt;''nn''&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} cos(''X&lt;sub&gt;nn&lt;/sub&gt;'')}}, that is, they can be calculated by simply taking the sines or cosines of the matrice's diagonal components.

The analogs of the [[trigonometric addition formulas]] are true [[if and only if]] {{mvar|XY {{=}} YX}}:&lt;ref name="Higham" /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\sin (X \pm Y) = \sin X \cos Y \pm \cos X \sin Y \\
\cos (X \pm Y) = \cos X \cos Y \mp \sin X \sin Y
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

==Other functions==
The tangent, as well as [[inverse trigonometric functions]], [[hyperbolic function|hyperbolic]] and [[inverse hyperbolic function]]s have also been defined for matrices:&lt;ref&gt;[https://help.scilab.org/docs/5.5.2/en_US/section_99038107015b1d789de50bf92f154a85.html Scilab trigonometry].&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2643">In discrete mathematics, a '''walk-regular graph''' is a [[simple graph]] where the number of closed walks of any length from a vertex to itself does not depend on the choice of vertex.

== Equivalent definitions ==
Suppose that &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is a simple graph. Let &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; denote the adjacency matrix of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;V(G)&lt;/math&gt; denote the set of vertices of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\Phi_{G - v}(x)&lt;/math&gt; denote the characteristic polynomial of the vertex-deleted subgraph &lt;math&gt;G - v&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;v \in V(G).&lt;/math&gt;Then the following are equivalent:
* &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is walk-regular.
* &lt;math&gt;A^k&lt;/math&gt; is a constant-diagonal matrix for all &lt;math&gt;k \geq 0.&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\Phi_{G - u}(x) = \Phi_{G - v}(x)&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;u, v \in V(G).&lt;/math&gt;

== Examples ==
* The [[vertex-transitive graph]]s are walk-regular.
* The [[semi-symmetric graph]]s are walk-regular.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://mathoverflow.net/a/264155|title=Are there only finitely many distinct cubic walk-regular graphs that are neither vertex-transitive nor distance-regular?|website=mathoverflow.net|access-date=2017-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=July 2017|sure=yes}}
* The [[distance-regular graph]]s are walk-regular. More generally, any simple graph in a homogeneous [[coherent algebra]] is walk-regular.
* A connected [[regular graph]] is walk-regular if:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://m4farrel.quora.com/Distinct-Eigenvalues-and-Walk-Regular-Graphs|title=Distinct Eigenvalues and Walk-Regular Graphs – In Search of Structure|last=Farrell|first=Mark|via=Quora|access-date=2017-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** It has at most four distinct eigenvalues.
** It is [[Triangle-free graph|triangle-free]] and has at most five distinct eigenvalues.
** It is [[Bipartite graph|bipartite]] and has at most six distinct eigenvalues.

== Properties ==
* A walk-regular graph is necessarily a regular graph.
* [[Graph complement|Complements]] of walk-regular graphs are walk-regular.
* [[Cartesian product of graphs|Cartesian products]] of walk-regular graphs are walk-regular.
* [[Tensor product of graphs|Categorical products]] of walk-regular graphs are walk-regular.
* [[Strong product of graphs|Strong products]] of walk-regular graphs are walk-regular.
* In general, the [[line graph]] of a walk-regular graph is not walk-regular.

In mathematical physics, the '''wave maps equation''' is a geometric wave equation that solves

:&lt;math&gt;D^\alpha \partial_\alpha u = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Connection (mathematics)|connection]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tataru|first=Daniel|title=Rough solutions for the wave maps equation|journal=American Journal of Mathematics|date=1 January 2005|volume=127|issue=2|pages=293–377|doi=10.1353/ajm.2005.0014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | zbl=1065.35199 | last=Tataru | first=Daniel | title=The wave maps equation | journal=[[Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society (N.S.)]] | volume=41 |number=2 | pages=185–204 | year=2004 | url=http://www.ams.org/journals/bull/2004-41-02/S0273-0979-04-01005-5/S0273-0979-04-01005-5.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It can be considered a natural extension of the wave equation for [[Riemannian manifolds]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.math.ucla.edu/~tao/preprints/wavemaps.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1267">: ''For other inequalities named after Wirtinger, see [[Wirtinger's inequality (disambiguation)|Wirtinger's inequality]].''

In mathematics, the '''Wirtinger inequality for 2-forms''', named after [[Wilhelm Wirtinger]], states that on a [[Kähler manifold]] &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;, the [[exterior power|exterior &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; power]] of the [[symplectic form]] (Kähler form) ω, when evaluated on a simple (decomposable) &lt;math&gt;(2k)&lt;/math&gt;-vector ζ of unit volume, is bounded above by &lt;math&gt;k!&lt;/math&gt;.  That is,

:&lt;math&gt; \omega^k(\zeta) \leq k !\,.&lt;/math&gt;

In other words, &lt;math&gt; \textstyle{\frac{\omega^k}{k!}} &lt;/math&gt; is a [[calibrated geometry|calibration]] on &lt;math&gt; M &lt;/math&gt;.  An important corollary is that every complex submanifold of a Kähler manifold is volume minimizing in its homology class.
