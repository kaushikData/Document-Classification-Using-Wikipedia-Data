The '''Australian Height Datum''' is a [[geodetic datum]] for [[altitude]] measurement in [[Australia]]. According to [[Geoscience Australia]], "In 1971 the [[Sea Level|mean sea level]] for 1966-1968 was assigned the value of 0.000m on the Australian Height Datum at thirty [[tide gauge]]s around the coast of the Australian continent. The resulting datum surface, with minor modifications in two metropolitan areas, has been termed the Australian Height Datum (AHD) and was adopted by the National Mapping Council as the datum to which all vertical control for mapping (and other surveying functions) is to be referred."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ga.gov.au/earth-monitoring/geodesy/geodetic-datums/australian-height-datum-ahd.html Australian Height Datum] Geoscience Australia&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bom.gov.au/lam/glossary/apagegl.shtml BoM glossary]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1=Roelse|first1= A. | last2=Granger|first2= H.

''Not to be confused with [[Bangkok]] Metropolis, which is a reference to Bangkok's city limits.''

The '''Bangkok Metropolitan Region''' ({{lang-th|กรุงเทพมหานครและปริมณฑล}}; [[Royal Thai General System of Transcription|RTGS:]] ''Krung Thep Mahanakhon Lae Parimonthon''; [[Literal meaning|Literally:]] Bangkok and surrounding provinces), may refer to a government-defined "political definition" of the urban region surrounding the metropolis of Bangkok, or the built-up area, i.e., urban agglomeration of [[Bangkok]], [[Thailand]], which varies in size and shape, and gets filled in as development expands.

The political definition is defined as [[Bangkok#Administration|the metropolis]] and the five adjacent provinces of [[Nakhon Pathom Province|Nakhon Pathom]], [[Pathum Thani Province|Pathum Thani]], [[Nonthaburi Province|Nonthaburi]], [[Samut Prakan Province|Samut Prakan]], and [[Samut Sakhon Province|Samut Sakhon]]. The total area is 7,762 square kilometres.

The Bangkok Metropolitan Region (political definition) covers an area of 7,761.6&amp;nbsp;km².&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Thailand: Bangkok Metropolitan Region / กรุงเทพมหานครและปริมณฑล|url=http://www.citypopulation.de/php/thailand-bangkokmetropolitan.php|website=City Population|accessdate=27 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{unreferenced section|date=May 2016}}
Due to the success of the service and tourism industry in Bangkok, the city has gained in popularity for work among provincial Thais from the rural areas and with people from many countries in the Indochina region as well as many South Asian countries.  In the past 20–30 years, there has been a large influx of [[Indians in Thailand|Indians into Thailand]] (especially [[Punjabis]], [[Gujarati people|Gujaratis]], [[Tamil people|Tamils]] and [[Pashtuns]]), and also [[Iranians in Thailand|Persians]], [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]], [[Khmer Krom]], [[Mon people|Mons]], [[Thai Chinese|Chinese]], as well as others emigrating to Thailand and Bangkok. There are large numbers of workers who legally reside outside the metropolitan area and travel into the city for day jobs. The population of the Bangkok metropolis ("the city") increases to nine million during the day, from eight million at night. The morning influx into the greater metropolitan region is not very significant, rather the influx is seasonal depending upon crop seasons in the rest of the country.

However, during New Year's holiday, the [[Songkran (Thailand)|Songkran]] holiday, and other long weekends, the capital often seems deserted of many taxi drivers, street vendors, and other informal service providers.

==Urban build-up==
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2014}}
Bangkok has seen rapidly urbanization since its population reached two million in the 1960s. Since the 1980s, greater Bangkok's built-up areas have spilled beyond Bangkok's borders to neighboring provinces, initially to the north and south. Despite a general suburbanization trend, Bangkok remained centralized and the city core remained extremely dense until the early 2000s as heavy commuter traffic limited choices. The countryside between once independent towns and the capital became ever more filled in,  with the advent and expansion of urban rail transit, as well as cheap credit enabling automobile adoption by the working class. The outward push of suburbanization has intensified as [[park and ride]] lots near train stations have sprung up.

In a manner similar to Los Angeles, Bangkok is transforming into a region where traffic flows in all directions rather than simply to the central core, as it once did.  Suburbanziation has swallowed ever more fields and swamps, though even parts of Bangkok itself are not built-up. The first areas to suburbanize were in Pathum Thani, Nonthaburi, and Samut Prakan Provinces. Other areas more recently have agglomerated in Samut Sakhon and Nakhon Pathom.  Samut Prakan, Nonthaburi, Pathum Thani and Samut Sakhon all have historic city centers.

Due to a lack of strict [[zoning]] laws, the metropolitan areas' growth appears haphazard. Central areas like Yaowarat, Siam, Sukhumvit, and Sathorn have seen skyrocketing land speculation as foreign investors are allowed to own condominiums, giving rise to [[Manhattanization]]. At the same time, fringe areas are being developed and the boundaries are no longer visible between each provincial city center. Due to the speed of this [[urban sprawl]] over the past twenty years, the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration has sought to tackle rising problems of commute times, pollution, and deteriorating air quality.  Recent administrations have been relatively successful in tackling the air quality issue,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://coconuts.co/bangkok/news/air-bangkok-least-polluted-among-worlds-global-cities/|title=Air in Bangkok least polluted among world’s global cities|author=|date=|website=coconuts.co}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/blogs/asia/2016/12/bangkok-cleans-act-161210153606363.html|title=Bangkok cleans up its act|author=|date=|website=www.aljazeera.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; however the city still lacks an effective mass transit network outside Bangkok proper and a clean and effective plan to resolve environmental issues. This form of urbanization is not limited to Bangkok. Traces of it can be found in metropolitan areas where there has been a surge in population. The [[Pattaya-Chonburi Metropolitan Area]] is a prime example due to the increase in residential high-rise living and the rush for commercial office space. The shared infrastructure of greater Bangkok and greater Pattaya-Chonburi, being physically close, helps fuel the latter's torrid development.

Therefore, greater Bangkok's actual population easily surpassed 15 million by the 2010 census.
* The Department of Provincial Affairs [[:th:กรมการปกครอง]] (DPA) ''Grommágaan Bpòkkrong'' registers Thai population and produces its own statistics separate from National Statistics Office (NSO).  Millions live in Bangkok region with upcountry registration.  Expats, migrants, those in refugee camps, and "native" ethnic tribes without Thai nationality may have not been counted DPA until 2016, when separate Thai nationality and Non-Thai was tabulated.  The total registered population of 64,076,033 in 2011 was some 1.4 million fewer than census figures a year earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stat.bora.dopa.go.th/stat/y_stat54.html|title=ประกาศจำนวนประชากร ปี พ.ศ. 2554|author=|date=|website=stat.bora.dopa.go.th}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thailand is still (2013) trying to officially register migrant workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=Herbert|title=Thailand: government extends a deadline for the registration of migrant workers|url=http://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=9c9cc033-62ac-4a2a-b4cb-77db75c1b9a0|website=Lexology|accessdate=27 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* As of post-coup 2014, Thailand's Department of Employment released figures showing that 408,507 legal workers from three neighboring states, and 1,630,279 Burmese, 40,546 Laotians, and 153,683 Cambodians without legal work authorization were working and residing in Thailand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Junta: No crackdown on foreign workers| url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/national/Junta-No-crackdown-on-foreign-workers-30236412.html|accessdate=27 November 2015|work=The Nation|date=June 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, some 180,000 Cambodians were said to have left Thailand post-coup due to rumors of a crackdown on illegals, indicating government figures may have been undercounted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Thailand, Cambodia to quash 'rumours' after worker exodus|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/archive/thailand-cambodia-to-quash-rumours-after-worker-exodus/415847|accessdate=27 November 2015|work=Bangkok Post|date=2014-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 31 October 2012, some 7,384,934 vehicles were registered in the metro area, roughly one vehicle for every two persons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jitsomboon|first1=Vipaporn|title=Traffic in Bangkok set to worsen in 2014, official warns|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/national/Traffic-in-Bangkok-set-to-worsen-in-2014-official--30196243.html|accessdate=27 November 2015|work=The Nation|date=2012-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To alleviate the ensuing congestion, massive railway development is ongoing, but its construction is causing large scale disturbance to  major thoroughfares.

==Further destruction of green space==
Bangkok's last undisturbed forested zone, Bang Krachao, in [[Samut Prakan Province|Samut Prakan]]'s [[Phra Pradaeng District]], also known as "the green lung" or "pig's stomach" ({{RTGS|krapho mu}}) (due to its shape) is threatened by urban sprawl, especially since a new city plan was implemented recently by Samut Prakan authorities. The plan has changed the pure green area to a "green and white" area, which allows residents to grow crops. Bang Krachao covers over 11,818 rai in six tambons in Phra Pradaeng.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Saengpassa| first1=Chularat|last2=Sarnsamak| first2=Pongphon|title=New city plan 'could ravage' the verdant Bang Krachao|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/national/New-city-plan-could-ravage-the-verdant-Bang-Kracha-30231068.html|accessdate=27 November 2015|work=The Nation|date=2014-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1113">The '''Brussels Geographic Conference''' was held in [[Brussels]] [[Belgium]] in September 1876 at the request of King [[Leopold II of Belgium]]. At the conference were invited nearly forty well-known experts, mainly they were schooled in the geographic sciences or were wealthy [[philanthropist]]s. Before the guests returned to their respective countries, they voted to establish the [[International African Association]]. This initiative would in the end pave the way for the creation of [[Congo Free State]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6797">The '''Cassini Grid''' was a grid coordinate system used on British military maps during the first half of the twentieth century, particularly during [[World War II]].  The referencing consists of square grids drawn on a [[Cassini projection]].  For a period after the war, the maps were also used by the general public.  The system has been superseded by the [[Ordnance Survey National Grid]].

==History==
The Cassini Grid system was introduced in 1927 for maps of the United Kingdom for the British military.  It is so called from the use of [[Cassini projection|Cassini map projection]].  It modified and replaced a grid coordinate system first deployed in 1919 known as the ''British System''.  The Cassini Grid system is thus more properly called the '''Modified British System'''.  It may also be referred to as '''Military Grid''', '''War Office Grid''', or '''Purple Grid''' (due to the grid colour on some issues of maps).  It continued in use until some time after [[World War II]].&lt;ref name=DESP&gt;The Defence of East Sussex Project, [http://www.pillbox.org.uk/methodology/maps.asp Military Maps] {{Webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/6br9uXS0h?url=http://www.pillbox.org.uk/methodology/maps.asp# |date=2015-09-27 }}, accessed and [https://www.webcitation.org/6br9uXS0h archived] 27 September 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war, the Cassini Grid system was replaced with the [[Ordnance Survey National Grid]] (see {{section link||Transition to National Grid}}).  However, the Cassini Grid system continued to be used to map [[Crown colony|colonial possessions]] into the 1960s.  [[Hong Kong]], for instance, was surveyed in 1962 for a series of 1:10,000 and 1:25,000 maps of the territory.  These were published between 1965 and 1972.&lt;ref&gt;R. Böhme, R. W.

The map is divided into a grid of 500 km squares.  The squares covering England are Q, R, V and W with an intersection somewhere between [[York]] and [[Thirsk]].  Ireland is covered by square I, but the Irish grid is tilted slightly to the East relative to the English grid.  Each 500 km square is further divided into 25 100 km squares.  The 100 km squares are also given letters (with I omitted).  The full designation for a grid square is the 500 km letter in lowercase followed by the 100 km letter in uppercase.  For instance, the squares covering London are wL and wQ.&lt;ref name=DESP/&gt;

Each 100 km square is subdivided into 10 km squares, and each of these is further subdivided into 1 km squares.  These squares are numbered according to [[easting and northing|eastings and northings]], that is, counting from the south-west corner of the 100 km square.  For instance, the grid reference 25&amp;nbsp;76 refers to a 1 km square within the 10 km square 2&amp;nbsp;7.  That is, it is two squares across and seven squares up (counting from zero) from the reference corner.  Greater precision can be obtained by using six, eight, or even more digits, but always an even number with the same precision on both coordinates.&lt;ref name=DESP/&gt;

The complete grid reference includes both the grid square letters and the numerical reference giving the location within the grid square.  For instance, wQ 683 825 is a location in South London.  Grid references can also be given in an all numeral notation.  To do this, square vV (the South-West corner of the grid out in the Atlantic) is taken as square zero and then the grid squares are counted from there to the location being referenced.  For instance qY 985 613 (somewhere around [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]]) can also be expressed as 3985 5613.  This is because square qY is three 100 km squares East of square vV and five 100 km squares North of vV.  However, it is frequently not necessary to explicitly give the grid square at all, this can be implied from context.&lt;ref name=DESP/&gt;

==Transition to National Grid==
The Ordnance Survey National Grid was introduced in 1938 and the intention was to replace the Cassini Grid system with this.  However, it had not become established when World War II broke out and the Cassini Grid continued in use throughout the war.  Work on the National Grid maps stopped for the duration of the war.  In fact, progress went backwards due to the [[Southampton]] offices of the [[Ordnance Survey]] being bombed by the Germans in 1940 destroying some of their data.&lt;ref name=DESP/&gt;

National Grid maps began to be issued after the war, but it was some time before there was full coverage.  In the interim, the public were allowed to purchase [[War Office]] Cassini Grid maps.&lt;ref name=DESP/&gt;  National Grid maps at 1:25,000 scale (often referred to as 2{{frac|2}} inches to the mile, or just 2{{frac|2}}-inch maps) were not introduced until as late as 1950.  Cassini Grid maps at this scale had been available, but apparently the public were discouraged from using them by the Ordnance Survey.  They were poor quality, rushed into production for wartime needs, and had been produced by merely photographically reducing six-inch maps.&lt;ref name=Monkhouse&gt;F. J. Monkhouse, [http://online.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/abs/10.3828/tpr.21.1.d517l232h8526222 "The new Ordnance Survey map series: Scale 1:25,000"], ''Town Planning Review'', vol. 21, iss. 1, pp. 70–81, 1950.&lt;/ref&gt;

The long period of introduction of the National Grid resulted in National Grid and Cassini Grid maps being used side by side for an extended time.  Converting between the two systems is problematic.  Although the two grids are superficially similar (both use 100 km squares), different projections, baselines and origins make the conversion non-trivial.  Conversion of Cassini Grid references is of interest to modern archeologists attempting to locate wartime sites and artefacts.&lt;ref name=DESP/&gt;

The [[Catholic Church]] during the [[Age of Discovery]] inaugurated a major effort to spread [[Christianity]] in the New World and to convert the [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]] and other indigenous people. The evangelical effort was a major part of, and a justification for the military conquests of European powers such as [[Spain]], [[France]] and [[Portugal]]. Christian [[Mission (Christian)|Missions]] to the indigenous peoples ran hand-in-hand with the colonial efforts of Catholic nations. In the Americas and other colonies in Asia and Africa, most missions were run by religious orders such as the [[Franciscans]], [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]], [[Augustinians]], and [[Jesuits]]. In Mexico the early systematic evangelization by mendicants came to be known as the "Spiritual Conquest of Mexico."&lt;ref&gt;Robert Ricard, ''The Spiritual Conquest of Mexico: An Essay on the Apostolate and the Evangelizing Methods of the Mendicant Orders in New Spain: 1523-1572'', translated from the French by Lesley Bird Simpson. Berkeley: University of California Press 1966.  The original text in French, ''Conquête Spirituelle du Mexique'' appeared in 1933.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Antonio de Montesinos (Dominican friar)|Antonio de Montesinos]], a Dominican [[friar]] on the island of [[Hispaniola]], was the first member of the clergy to publicly denounce all forms of enslavement and oppression of the [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]].&lt;ref&gt;Hanke, Lewis. (1946) Free Speech in Sixteenth-Century Spanish America. ''The Hispanic American Historical Review'', 26,2:135-149. Page 142.&lt;/ref&gt; Theologians such as [[Francisco de Vitoria]] and [[Bartolomé de las Casas]] drew up theological and philosophical bases for the defense of the [[human rights]] of the colonized native populations, thus creating the basis of [[international law]], regulating the relationships between nations.&lt;ref&gt;https://history.sfsu.edu/sites/default/files/images/2001_Bonar%20Ludwig%20Hernandez.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Important contemporary ecclesiastical documents taking a strong stance on enslaving or despoiling the [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]] was the ecclesiastical letter [[Pastorale officium]] and the superseding encyclical [[Sublimis Deus]].

In the early years most mission work was undertaken by the religious orders. Over time it was intended that a normal church structure would be established in the mission areas. The process began with the formation of special jurisdictions, known as [[apostolic prefecture]]s and [[apostolic vicariate]]s. These developing churches eventually graduated to regular diocesan status with the appointment of a local bishop. After [[decolonization]], this process increased in pace as church structures altered to reflect new political-administrative realities.

==Background==
[[File:La Virgen de Candelaria, en Tenerife, Patrona de las Islas Canarias, España.JPG|thumb|La Virgen de Candelaria, Patron of the Canary Islands]]
In 1341, a three-ship expedition sponsored by King [[Afonso IV of Portugal]], set out from Lisbon for the [[Canary Islands]]. The expedition spent five months mapping the islands.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=JL_IU1hpmsIC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA389#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Boccaccio, Giovanni. "De Canaria et insula reliquis, ultra Ispaniam, in occeano noviter repertis" (repr. in ''Monumenta Henricina'', vol. I, p.202-06]&lt;/ref&gt; This expedition became the basis of Portuguese claims to the islands.

In 1344, the Castilian-French noble [[Luis de la Cerda]] (Count of Clermont and [[Admiral of France]]), and French ambassador to the papal court in [[Avignon Papacy|Avignon]], proposed to [[Pope Clement VI]], conquering the islands and converting the native [[Guanches]] to Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;Viera y Clavijo, [https://books.google.com/books?id=7o42AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA268#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false, p.268]&lt;/ref&gt;  In November 1344, Clement VI issued the bull ''Tu devonitis sinceritas'' bestowing upon Luis de la Cerda the title of sovereign "Prince of Fortuna".  Clement also urged the kings of Portugal and Castile to provide assistance to Cerda's expedition.&lt;ref&gt;''Monumenta Henricina'' vol. 1 contains copies of [[Pope Clement VI]]'s bull ''Tu devonitis sinceritas''(Nov 1344) granting the Canaries to Luis de la Cerda ([https://books.google.com/books?id=JL_IU1hpmsIC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA401#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.207]), the bull ''Prouenit ex tue'' of indulgences (Jan 1345) [https://books.google.com/books?id=JL_IU1hpmsIC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA443#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.228]&lt;/ref&gt;  The Portuguese king [[Afonso IV of Portugal|Afonso IV]] immediately lodged a protest,&lt;ref&gt;For Alfonso IV's protest (Feb 1345), see ''MH'', v. 1,([https://books.google.com/books?id=JL_IU1hpmsIC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA447#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.231])&lt;/ref&gt; as did [[Alfonso XI of Castile]].&lt;ref&gt;For the reply of Alfonso XI (Mar 1345) see ''MH'', vol. 1 [https://books.google.com/books?id=JL_IU1hpmsIC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA455#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.234].&lt;/ref&gt;  Preparations were delayed and no expedition was mounted before Cerda's death in 1348.

The raids and attacks of the Reconquista created captives on both sides, who were either ransomed or sold as slaves. During the dynastic wars of the 1370s, between Portugal and Castile, Portuguese and Castilian privateers made for the Canaries for shelter or slaving raids.

In 1415, the Portuguese captured the city of [[Battle of Ceuta|Ceuta]] and continued to expand their control along the coast of [[Morocco]]. Portuguese ventures were intended to compete with the Muslim trans-Sahara caravans, which held a monopoly on West African [[gold]] and [[ivory]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=okDypjibS0wC&amp;pg=PA25 Phipps, William E., ''Amazing Grace in John Newton'', Mercer University Press, 2004] {{ISBN|9780865548688}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1418 the Portuguese began with to settle the [[Madeira Islands]], at first prized for their wood and later [[cane sugar]].&lt;ref name=Payne/&gt; By 1427 they had reached the [[Azores]]. Portugal and Spain continued to dispute control of the Canary Islands.

==Age of Discovery==

===''Creator omnium''===
The Castilian conquest of the islands began in 1402, with the expedition of [[Jean de Béthencourt]] and [[Gadifer de la Salle]], on commission of [[Henry III of Castile]]. The expedition included two Franciscan friars. [[Lanzarote]], and later [[Fuerteventura]] and [[El Hierro]] were occupied, and the Bishopric of the Canaries was established.

In 1434, [[Henry the Navigator|Prince Henry of Portugal]] attempted to invade Gran Canaria. When a landing was repulsed by the [[Guanches]], the native [[Berbers|Berber]] inhabitants, the expedition then plundered the Castilian missions on Lanzarote and Fuerteventura.&lt;ref name=Lawrance&gt;[http://eprints.nottingham.ac.uk/2172/1/Lawrance_Cartagena_on_the_affair_of_the_Canaries.pdf Lawrance, Jeremy. "Alfonso de Cartagena on the affair of the Canaries (1436–37), ''Historians of Medieval Iberia'', September 1989, University of Birmingham]&lt;/ref&gt; A complaint was lodged by Fernando Calvetos, the Castilian bishop of San Marcial del Rubicón in Lanzarote, supported by the archbishop of Seville. Calvetos informed the pope of the pillaging carried out by the Portuguese "pirates". Pope Eugene IV issued ''Regimini gregis'' on 29 September 1434,&lt;ref&gt;MH, V, 89–93, §38&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Creator Omnium'', on 17 December 1434, forbidding any further raids on the Canaries and ordered the immediate manumission of all Christian converts enslaved during the attack.&lt;ref name=Lawrance/&gt;

While ''Creator omnium'' was issued in response to Portuguese depredations on Castilian settlements in the Canaries, the following month Pope Eugene issued the broader ''[[Sicut Dudum]]'', indicating that Castilian slavers were not exempt and requiring that residents of the Canary Islands who had been enslaved were to be set free within fifteen days of publication of the bull upon penalty of excommunication.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.papalencyclicals.net/Eugene04/eugene04sicut.htm Pope Eugene IV, ''Sicut dudum'', 13 January 1435] Papal Encyclicals online&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Dum diversas''===
According to Stanley G. Payne, "[T]he expansion of the faith was inextricably intertwined with military glory and economic
profit. Because of this it is idle to ask, as is frequently done, whether the Portuguese pioneers and Castilian conquistadores were motivated more by greed or by religious zeal. In the Hispanic crusading expansionist ideology, the two went together.&lt;ref name=Payne&gt;[http://libro.uca.edu/payne1/payne10.pdf Payne, Samuel G., ''A History of Spain and Portugal'', Vol.1, Chapt. 10]&lt;/ref&gt;

When Islam presented a serious military threat to [[medieval Italy|Italy]] and Central Europe during the mid-15th century, Pope [[Nicholas V]] tried to unite [[Christendom]] against them but failed. He then granted Portugal the right to subdue and even enslave Muslims, pagans and other unbelievers in the papal bull [[Dum Diversas]] (1452).&lt;ref name="Thomas66"/&gt; The following year saw the [[Fall of Constantinople]] to [[Ottoman Empire|Muslim invaders]].&lt;ref name="Thomas66"&gt;Thomas, Hugh, ''The Slave Trade: The Story of the Atlantic Slave Trade, 1440-1870'' (1999), Simon and Schuster, {{ISBN|978-0-684-83565-5}},  p. 65-6.&lt;/ref&gt; Several decades later, European colonizers and missionaries spread Catholicism to the Americas, Asia, Africa and Oceania. [[Pope Alexander VI]] had awarded colonial rights over most of the newly discovered lands to Spain and Portugal.&lt;ref name="Koschorke13"&gt;[[Klaus Koschorke|Koschorke, Klaus]], ''A History of Christianity in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, 1450–1990'' (2007), Wm B Eerdmans Publishing Co, {{ISBN|978-0-8028-2889-7}}, p. 13, 283.&lt;/ref&gt; Under the ''patronato'' system, however, state authorities, not the Vatican, controlled all clerical appointments in the new colonies.&lt;ref name="Dussel39"&gt;Dussel, Enrique, ''A History of the Church in Latin America'' (1981), Wm. B. Eerdmans, {{ISBN|0-8028-2131-6}}, p. 39, 59.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the 1455 [[Papal Bull]] ''[[Romanus Pontifex]]'' granted the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] all lands behind [[Cape Bojador]] and allows to reduce pagans and other enemies of Christ to perpetual [[slavery]].&lt;ref name="Daus"&gt;{{cite book

Later, the 1481 [[Papal Bull]] ''[[Aeterni regis]]'' granted all lands south of the [[Canary Islands]] to [[Portuguese Empire|Portugal]], while in May 1493 the Spanish-born [[Pope Alexander VI]] decreed in the Bull ''[[Inter caetera]]'' that all lands west of a meridian only 100 leagues west of the [[Cape Verde]] Islands should belong to [[Spanish Empire|Spain]] while new lands discovered east of that line would belong to Portugal. A further Bull, ''[[Dudum siquidem]]'', made some more concessions to Spain, and the pope's arrangements were then amended by the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]] of 1494 negotiated between Spain and Portugal.

After the discovery of the Americas, many of the clergy sent to the New World began to criticize Spain and the Church's treatment of indigenous peoples. In December 1511, [[Antonio de Montesinos (Dominican friar)|Antonio de Montesinos]], a Dominican friar, openly rebuked the Spanish rulers of [[Hispaniola]] for their "cruelty and tyranny" in dealing with the natives.&lt;ref name="Koschorke287"&gt;Koschorke, Klaus, ''A History of Christianity in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, 1450–1990'' (2007), Wm B Eerdmans Publishing Co, {{ISBN|978-0-8028-2889-7}}, p. 287.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ferdinand II of Aragon|King Ferdinand]] enacted the ''[[Laws of Burgos]]'' and ''Valladolid'' in response. However enforcement was lax, and the [[New Laws]] of 1542 took a stronger line. This caused a revolt among the Spanish colonists, and the alarmed government backed down, softening the effect of the laws. Some historians blame the Church for not doing enough to liberate the Indians; others point to the Church as the only voice raised on behalf of indigenous peoples.&lt;ref name="Dussel45"&gt;Dussel, Enrique, ''A History of the Church in Latin America'' (1981), Wm. B. Eerdmans, {{ISBN|0-8028-2131-6}}, p. 45, 52, 53 quote: "The missionary Church opposed this state of affairs from the beginning, and nearly everything positive that was done for the benefit of the indigenous peoples resulted from the call and clamor of the missionaries. The fact remained, however, that widespread injustice was extremely difficult to uproot ... Even more important than Bartolome de Las Casas was the Bishop of Nicaragua, Antonio de Valdeviso, who ultimately suffered martyrdom for his defense of the Indian."&lt;/ref&gt; The issue resulted in a crisis of conscience in 16th-century Spain.&lt;ref name="Koschorke287"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Johansen109"&gt;Johansen, p. 109, 110, quote: "In the Americas, the Catholic priest Bartolome de las Casas avidly encouraged inquiries into the Spanish conquest's many cruelties. Las Casas chronicled Spanish brutality against the Native peoples in excruciating detail."&lt;/ref&gt; The reaction of Catholic writers such as [[Bartolomé de Las Casas]] and [[Francisco de Vitoria]] led to debate on the nature of human rights&lt;ref name="Koschorke287"/&gt; and the birth of modern international law.&lt;ref name="Woods137"&gt;Woods, Thomas, ''How the Catholic Church Built Western Civilization'' (2005), Regnery Publishing, Inc, {{ISBN|0-89526-038-7}} p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chadwick327"&gt;Chadwick, Owen, ''A History of Christianity'', Barnes &amp; Noble, (1995), {{ISBN|0-7607-7332-7}}  p. 327.&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Kingdom of France|French]], [[Kingdom of England|English]], and [[Dutch Republic|Dutch]] reactions against the [[mare clausum|maritime monopolies]] granted to Portugal and Spain, meanwhile, culminated in [[Hugo Grotius]]'s [[Mare Liberum|work]] articulating the doctrine of [[freedom of the seas]].)

In 1524, [[Franciscan]] missionaries known as the [[Twelve Apostles of Mexico]] arrived in what is [[New Spain]], followed by the Dominicans in 1526, and the Augustinians in 1533.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Ricard, ''The Spiritual Conquest of Mexico: An Essay on the Apostolate and the Evangelizing Methods of the Mendicant Orders in New Spain, 1523-1572,'' translated by Lesley Byrd Simpson. Berkeley: University of California Press 1966, pp. 2-3.&lt;/ref&gt;  They worked hard to convert the Indians and to provide for their well-being by establishing schools and hospitals. Because some people questioned whether the Indians were truly men who deserved baptism, Pope Paul III in the papal bull Veritas Ipsa or [[Sublimis Deus]] (1537) confirmed that the Indians were deserving men.&lt;ref name=Johansen110&gt;Johansen, Bruce, ''The Native Peoples of North America,'' Rutgers University Press, New Brunswick, 2006, p. 110, quote: "In the Papal bull ''Sublimis deus'' (1537), Pope Paul III declared that Indians were to be regarded as fully human, and that their souls were as immortal as those of Europeans. This edict also outlawed slavery of Indians in any form..."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Koschorke290"&gt;Koschorke, ''A History of Christianity in Asia, Africa, and Latin America'' (2007), p. 290&lt;/ref&gt; Afterward, the conversion effort gained momentum.&lt;ref name=samora20&gt;Samora ''et al.'', ''A History of the Mexican-American People'' (1993), p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

=== School of Salamanca ===
{{main|School of Salamanca}}

[[File:Mission San Jose natives.jpg|thumb|300px|left|An early visitor to California sketched a group of [[Ohlone|Costeño]] dancers at [[Mission San José (California)|Mission San José]] with their bodies painted to resemble the patterns in Spanish military uniforms.&lt;ref&gt;Kelsey, H. (1993). ''Mission San Juan Capistrano: A Pocket History''. Interdisciplinary Research, Inc., Altadena, CA. p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The [[School of Salamanca]], which gathered theologians such as the Dominican [[Francisco de Vitoria]] (1480–1546), and later theologians, such as the highly influential Jesuit [[Francisco Suárez]] (1548–1617), argued in favor of the existence of rights to indigenous peoples.  For example, these theologians thought that it was illegitimate to conquer other peoples for religious reasons, or even to force the baptisms of non-Christian subjects.  Their views on non-believers had been already established by medieval discussions of Jewish and Muslim subjects of Christian princes.  Although this view was not always prevalent, it was the traditional Dominican and Thomist view, and reflected the practice of late antiquity and the early Middle Ages. However, while such theologians limited [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]]'s imperial powers over colonized people, they also mentioned some legitimate reasons for the conquest.  For instance, on their view, war might be justified if the indigenous people refused free transit and commerce to the Europeans; if they forced converts to return to [[idolatry]]; if there come to be a sufficient number of Christians in the newly discovered land that they wish to receive from the Pope a Christian government; if the indigenous people lacked just laws, magistrates, agricultural techniques, etc. In any case, title taken according to this principle must be exercised with Christian [[Charity (virtue)|charity]], warned Suárez, and for the advantage of the Indians. More traditional theologians legitimized the conquest while at the same time limiting the absolute power of the [[head of state|sovereign]], which was celebrated in others parts of Europe under the developing notion of the [[Divine right of kings|divine right]] of kings.

==Conversions and assimilation==

{{Main|Our Lady of Guadalupe}}

The [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|conquest]] was immediately accompanied by evangelization, and new, local forms of Catholicism appeared. The [[Virgin of Guadalupe]] is one of [[Mexico]]'s oldest religious images, and is said to have appeared to [[Juan Diego Cuauhtlatoatzin]] in 1531. News of the 1534 apparition on [[Tepayac Hill]] spread quickly through Mexico; and in the seven years that followed, 1532 through 1538, the Indian people accepted the Spaniards and 8 million people were converted to the Catholic faith. Thereafter, the Aztecs no longer practiced [[Human sacrifice in Aztec culture|human sacrifice]] or native forms of worship. In 2001 the Italian [[Movement of Love Saint Juan Diego]] was created, and launched evangelization projects in 32 states. A year later, Juan Diego was [[canonized]] by Pope John Paul II.

Guadalupe is often considered a mixture of the cultures which blend to form Mexico, both racially&lt;ref&gt;Beckwith, Barbara.  "A View From the North." St. Anthony Messenger Magazine Online.

[http://www.mexconnect.com/mex_/travel/jking/jkguadalupe.html], accessed 29 November 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Mary O'Connor writes that Guadalupe "bring[s] together people of distinct cultural heritages, while at the same time affirming their distinctness."&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor, Mary.  "The Virgin of Guadalupe and the Economics of Symbolic Behavior." in ''[[The Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion]]'' Vol. 28, Issue 2.  p. 105-119.  1989&lt;/ref&gt;

One theory is that the Virgin of Guadalupe was presented to the [[Aztec]]s as a sort of  "[[Christianization|Christianized]]" [[Tonantzin]], necessary for the clergymen to convert the indigenous people to their faith.  As Jacques Lafaye wrote in ''Quetzalcoatl and Guadalupe'', "...as the Christians built their first churches with the rubble and the columns of the ancient pagan temples, so they often borrowed pagan customs for their own cult purposes.&lt;ref name="lafay"&gt;Lafaye, Jacques.  ''Quetzalcoatl and Guadalupe.  The Formation of Mexican National Consciousness.'' Chicago:  University of Chicago Press.  1976&lt;/ref&gt;

Such Virgins appeared in most of the other evangelized countries, mixing Catholicism with the local customs. The [[Basilica of Our Lady of Copacabana]] was built in [[Bolivia]], near the ''[[Isla del Sol]]'' where the [[Sun God]] was believed to be born, in the 16th century, to commemorate the apparition of the [[Virgin of Copacabana]]; in [[Cuba]] the Virgin named ''[[Caridad del Cobre]]'' was allegedly seen in the beginning of the 16th century, a case consigned in the ''[[Archivo General de Indias]]''; in [[Brazil]] [[Our Lady of Aparecida]] was declared in 1929 official Patron Saint of the country by [[Pope Pius XI]]; Our Lady of [[Luján, Buenos Aires|Luján]] in [[Argentina]]; ''[[La Negrita]]'' in [[Costa Rica]]...

Three decades later, in 1582, led by several figures including the prominent [[Italian people|Italian]]  [[Matteo Ricci]], Jesuits once again initiated [[Mission (Christian)|mission]] work in China, ultimately introducing Western science, mathematics, astronomy, and visual arts to the [[Emperor of China|imperial court]], and carrying on significant inter-cultural and philosophical dialogue with Chinese scholars, particularly representatives of [[Confucianism]]. At the time of their peak influence, members of the Jesuit delegation were considered some of the [[Emperor of China|emperor]]'s most valued and trusted advisors, holding numerous prestigious posts in the imperial government. Many Chinese, including notable former Confucian scholars, adopted Christianity and became priests and members of the Society of Jesus.

Between the 18th and mid-19th century, nearly all Western missionaries in China were forced to conduct their teaching and other activities covertly.

Elsewhere, Jesuit missionary [[Francis Xavier]] introduced Christianity to [[Japan]]. By the end of the 16th century tens of thousands of Japanese followed Roman Catholicism. Church growth came to a halt in 1597 under the Shogun [[Tokugawa Iemitsu]] who, in an effort to isolate the country from foreign influences, launched a severe persecution of Christians.&lt;ref name="Koschorke31"&gt;Koschorke, ''A History of Christianity in Asia, Africa, and Latin America'' (2007), pp. 31&amp;ndash;2&lt;/ref&gt; Japanese were forbidden to leave the country and Europeans were forbidden to enter. Despite this, a minority Christian population survived into the 19th century.&lt;ref name="Koschorke31"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McManners318"&gt;McManners, ''Oxford Illustrated History of Christianity'' (1990), p. 318&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Reducciones.PNG|thumb|300px|right|Location of the most important [[Jesuit Reductions]] in the [[Southern Cone]], with present political divisions.]]
In [[South America]], the Jesuits protected native peoples from enslavement by establishing semi-independent settlements called [[Jesuit Reductions|reductions]]. [[Pope Gregory XVI]], challenging Spanish and Portuguese sovereignty, appointed his own candidates as bishops in the colonies, condemned slavery and the slave trade in 1839 (papal bull ''[[In supremo apostolatus]]''), and approved the ordination of native clergy in spite of government racism.&lt;ref name="Duffy221"&gt;Duffy, ''Saints and Sinners'' (1997), p. 221&lt;/ref&gt;

Many buildings erected by the Jesuits still stand, such as the [[Cathedral of Saint Paul in Macau]] and the [[La Santísima Trinidad de Paraná|Santísima Trinidad de Paraná]] in [[Paraguay]], an example of a [[Jesuit Reductions|Jesuit Reduction]].

==Empires and missions==

===Spanish missions===
:''See Jesuits and Franciscans above''.

In [[The Californias|Las Californias]] Province of [[New Spain]] in the [[Americas]], the Catholic Church expanded its missions in cooperation with the Spanish government and military to settle present day California and protect it from Imperial [[Russian America|Russian]] and British colonial advances. [[Junípero Serra]], the Franciscan priest in charge of this effort, founded a series of [[Mission (station)|mission stations]] which became economic, political, and religious institutions.&lt;ref name="Norman111"&gt;Norman, ''The Roman Catholic Church an Illustrated History'' (2007), pp. 111&amp;ndash;2&lt;/ref&gt; These missions brought grain, cattle, and a changed homeland for the California Native Americans. They had no immunity to European diseases, with subsequent [[Population history of indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous tribal population]] falls.  However, by bringing Western civilization to the area, these missions and the Spanish government have been held responsible for wiping out nearly a third of the native population, primarily through disease.&lt;ref name="King"&gt;King, ''Mission to Paradise'' (1975), p. 169&lt;/ref&gt; Overland routes were established from [[New Spain]] (Mexico) that resulted in the establishment of a mission and presidio (fort) — now [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]] (1776), and a [[pueblo]] (town) — now [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] (1781).

===French missions===
{{main|French colonization of the Americas|Equinoctial France}}

The French colonial effort began later than that of the Spanish or Portuguese.
::Hawaii - The French Incident (1839)
Under the rule of Ka{{okina}}ahumanu the newly converted Protestant widow of Kamehameha the Great, Catholicism was illegal in Hawaii and chiefs loyal to her forcibly deported French priests onto the ''Artemise''. [[Native Hawaiian]] Catholic converts were imprisoned and [[American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions#Early missions|Protestant ministers]] ordered them to be tortured.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}  The prejudice against the French Catholics missionaries remained the same under the reign of her successor, the [[Kuhina Nui]] [[Ka'ahumanu II]].
In 1839 [[Cyrille Pierre Théodore Laplace|Captain Laplace]] of the French frigate ''Artémise'' sailed to Hawaii under orders to:
&lt;blockquote&gt;...destroy the malevolent impression which you find established to the detriment of the French name; to rectify the erroneous opinion which has been created as to the power of France; and to make it well understood that it would be to the advantage of the chiefs of those islands of the Ocean to conduct themselves in such a manner as not to incur the wrath of France. You will exact, if necessary with all the force that is yours to use, complete reparation for the wrongs which have been committed, and you will not quit those places until you have left in all minds a solid and lasting impression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kuykendall|first=Ralph S.|title=The Hawaiian Kingdom, Volume 1: 1778 - 1854|year=1938|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|location=Honolulu|isbn=0-87022-431-X|edition=6. print.|authorlink=Ralph Simpson Kuykendall|page=152}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Secularization and decolonization==
{{main|Latin American wars of independence|Spanish American wars of independence|Mexican War of Independence|Mexican secularization act of 1833}}

Decolonization in Central and South America began with the revolutions in the 1820s, with all countries becoming independent then, except [[Puerto Rico]] and [[Cuba]] in 1898. Leaders were inspired by the [[American Revolution]] and the [[French Revolution]] of the late 18th century.

==Emergence of the American Catholic Church==
In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, the Roman Catholic Church experienced unique difficulties within the United States of America.  "Unlike all Protestant churches in America, the Roman Catholic church depended for its identity upon keeping doctrinal and administrative unity with a European-based authority."&lt;ref name="Howard C. Kee 1997"&gt;Howard C. Kee et al., Christianity: A Social and Cultural History (2nd Edition), 2 ed. (Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall, 1997), 455.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[papacy]] was cautious of the freedom found in the United States as it showed similarities to the attitudes behind the French Revolution. The papacy wanted to preserve the hierarchy of the church in America.  At this time, Catholics were chiefly located in [[Pennsylvania]] and [[Maryland]] and were greatly influenced by their Protestant neighbors.  They, too, wanted a church that empowered the laity.  In 1788 [[James Carroll (bishop)|James Carroll]] was elected the first Bishop of the United States.  He struggled to balance the desires of the US trustees to adapt and empower the laity and hold church property with the requests of the bishops and hierarchy oversees to preserve the doctrine. This controversy ran from approximately 1780 to 1850.  In the end, the power and authority were too differential and the bishops won. This marked the creation of the "American Catholic Church with the laity subordinate to priest and bishop."&lt;ref name="Howard C. Kee 1997 6"&gt;Howard C. Kee et al., Christianity: A Social and Cultural History (2nd Edition), 2 ed. (Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall, 1997), 456.&lt;/ref&gt;  This system remained until the mid-20th century.&lt;ref name="Howard C. Kee 1997 6"/&gt;

===Beginnings of the American Catholic School System===
In the early-to-mid-19th century, schools in the United States were greatly influenced by [[Protestantism]]. This created difficulties with American Catholics. They challenged the singing of Protestant hymns and reading of the [[King James Bible]] in the classroom. Some school boards made changes to be more non-denominational.&lt;ref name="Howard C. Kee 1997 6"/&gt;  Tensions were great during this time period as Americans were already fearful of immigration and Catholics.  After a number of struggles, for a variety of reasons, American Catholics began creating their own schools in the 1840s.  Archbishop at the time, John Hughes, insisted that Catholic Education was the primary way to preserve proper Christian teaching.&lt;ref name="Mark A. Noll 2003"&gt;Mark A. Noll, A Documentary History of Religion in America since 1877, 3 ed. (Grand Rapids: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Company, 2003), 39.&lt;/ref&gt;  He cited education at a young age promoted the reason and experience necessary for a strong religious background.  He called American Catholics "to multiply our schools, and to perfect them."&lt;ref name="Mark A. Noll 2003 2"&gt;Mark A. Noll, A Documentary History of Religion in America since 1877, 3 ed. (Grand Rapids: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Company, 2003), 42.&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1852 the bishops recommended "catholic children should attend only schools that were under church control."&lt;ref name="Howard C. Kee 1997 0"&gt;Howard C. Kee et al., Christianity: A Social and Cultural History (2nd Edition), 2 ed. (Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall, 1997), 460.&lt;/ref&gt;

== 20th century ==

[[File:Difunta Correa santuario.JPG|thumb|140px|Sanctuary dedicated to the ''[[Difunta Correa]]'', a semi-pagan saint, located in [[Uruguay]], between the [[Tacuarembó]] and [[Paso de los Toros]] cities.]]
The Catholic faith also became integrated in the industrial and post-industrial [[middle class]] as it developed, in particular through the lay movements created following the 1891 ''[[Rerum novarum]]'' encyclical enacted by [[Pope Leo XIII]], and which insisted on the social role of the Roman Catholic Church.&lt;ref name=Bastian&gt;Jean-Pierre Bastian, ''"Des foules si ferventes''" in ''[[L'Histoire]]'' n°322, July–August 2007, pp.86-89 {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; New ceremonies appeared throughout the 20th century, such as [[Fidencio Constantino Sintora]] (known as the ''[[Niño Fidencio]]'') (1898–1938) in Mexico, the [[Santa Muerte]] in Mexico (who has been attacked by the Catholic Church as being a pagan figure) or [[Difunta Correa]] in Argentina. The latter's pilgrimage site was visited by 700 000 persons in 2005.&lt;ref name=Bastian/&gt;

==Legacy and issues==

===20th-century missions===
Much Catholic missionary work has undergone a profound change since the [[Second Vatican Council]] (1962–65), and has become explicitly conscious of the dangers of [[cultural imperialism]] or [[economic exploitation]]. Contemporary Christian missionaries try to observe the principles  of [[inculturation]] in their missionary work.  In the 1970s, the Jesuits would become a main proponent of the [[liberation theology]] which openly supported anti-imperialist movements. It was officially condemned in 1984 and in 1986 by then-Cardinal Ratzinger (later [[Pope Benedict XVI]]) as the head of the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]], under charges of [[Marxism|Marxist tendencies]], while [[Leonardo Boff]] was suspended.
[[Proselytism]] has continued however throughout the 20th century, with [[Latin America]] accounting for the largest Catholic population in the world. But since the 1960s-70s, [[Protestant]] [[evangelism]] and [[new religious movements]] have begun to strongly compete with Catholicism in South America, while various [[approaches to evangelism]] have been developed . In response, the Pope [[John Paul II]] made frequent [[Pastoral trips of Pope John Paul II|travels]] to this continent, visiting among other countries [[Chile under Pinochet|Chile during Pinochet's rule]]. He also supported [[Catholic Charismatic Renewal]] movements against rival [[Charismatic movements]], and groups such as the ''[[Neocatechumenal Way]]'' (which has close to 20,000 communities in Latin America and 600,000 members alone), ''[[Focolari]]'', ''[[Comunione e Liberazione]]'' or the [[Opus Dei]], which are main vectors of Roman Catholicism in the region.&lt;ref name="Bastian"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;François Normand, [http://www.monde-diplomatique.fr/1995/09/NORMAND/1804 La troublante ascension de l’Opus Dei], ''[[Le Monde diplomatique]]'', September 1995 {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1990 encyclical ''[[Redemptoris Missio]]'' (subtitled ''On the permanent validity of the Church's missionary mandate''), John Paul II stressed "the urgency of missionary activity"&lt;ref&gt;''Introduction'' of ''[[Redemptoris Missio]]'', 1.&lt;/ref&gt; and in which he wished "to invite the Church to renew her missionary commitment."&lt;ref&gt;''Introduction of ''[[Redemptoris Missio]]'', 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ethnocide and challenges ===
{{main|Population history of indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans in the United States}}

After a journey among the [[Bari (Americas)|Bari]] in [[South America]], the ethnologist [[Robert Jaulin]]  called for a convention on ethnocide in the Americas at the Congress of [[International Congress of Americanists|Americanists]], and, in February 1970, the French Society of Americanists convened for that purpose.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.library.yale.edu/div/theme2.htm Yale-Edinburgh Group on the History of the Missionary Movement and Non-Western Christianity]&lt;/ref&gt; Jaulin criticized in particular the role of Christian [[missionaries]] towards non-Western cultures.

{{Anti-consumerism |Theories}}

'''Degrowth''' (&lt;!--originally a French term--&gt;{{lang-fr|décroissance}}) is a political, economic, and social movement based on [[ecological economics]], [[Anti-consumerism|anti-consumerist]] and [[Anti-capitalism|anti-capitalist]] ideas.&lt;ref name=gd01/&gt;  It is also considered an essential economic strategy responding to the [[The Limits to Growth|limits-to-growth]] dilemma (see ''[[The Path to Degrowth in Overdeveloped Countries]]'' and [[post-growth]]). Degrowth thinkers and activists advocate for the downscaling of [[Production (economics)|production]] and [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]]—the contraction of [[Economy|economies]]—arguing that [[overconsumption]] lies at the root of long term [[environmental issue]]s and [[Social inequality|social inequalities]]. Key to the concept of degrowth is that reducing consumption does not require individual [[Martyr|martyring]] or a decrease in [[well-being]].&lt;ref name="Zehner 2012"&gt;{{cite book|last=Zehner|first=Ozzie|title=Green Illusions|year=2012|publisher=U. Nebraska Press|location=Lincoln &amp; London|isbn=0803237758|pages=178–183, 339–342|url=http://GreenIllusions.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather, "degrowthers" aim to maximize happiness and well-being through non-consumptive means—sharing work, consuming less, while devoting more time to art, music, family, nature, culture and community.

==Background==
The movement arose from concerns over the perceived
consequences of the [[productivism]] and [[consumerism]]
associated with industrial societies (whether
[[Capitalism|capitalist]] or [[Socialism|socialist]]) including:&lt;ref name=fd01/&gt;
* The reduced availability of energy sources (see [[peak oil]])
* The declining quality of the environment (see [[global warming]], [[pollution]], [[Biodiversity#Threats|threats to biodiversity]])
* The decline in the health of flora and fauna upon which humans depend (see [[Holocene extinction]])
* The rise of negative societal side-effects (see un[[sustainable development]], poorer [[health]], [[poverty]])
* The ever-expanding use of resources by [[First World]] countries to satisfy lifestyles that consume more food and energy, and produce greater waste, at the expense of the [[Third World]] (see [[neocolonialism]])

===Resource depletion===
{{Main article|Resource depletion}}
As economies grow, the need for resources grows accordingly (unless there are changes in efficiency or demand for different products due to price changes). There is a fixed supply of non-renewable resources, such as [[petroleum]] (oil), and these resources will inevitably be depleted. Renewable resources can also be depleted if extracted at unsustainable rates over extended periods. For example, this has occurred with [[caviar]] production in the Caspian Sea.&lt;ref&gt;Bardi, U. (2008) 'Peak Caviar'. The Oil Drum: Europe. http://europe.theoildrum.com/node/4367&lt;/ref&gt; There is much concern as to how growing demand for these resources will be met as supplies decrease. Many organizations and governments look to energy technologies such as biofuels, solar cells, and wind turbines to meet the demand gap after peak oil. Others have argued that none of the alternatives could effectively replace versatility and portability of oil.&lt;ref&gt;McGreal, R. 2005. 'Bridging the Gap: Alternatives to Petroleum (Peak Oil Part II)'. Raising the Hammer. http://www.raisethehammer.org/index.asp?id=119&lt;/ref&gt; Authors of the book ''Techno-Fix'' criticize technological optimists for overlooking the limitations of technology in solving agricultural and social challenges arising from growth.&lt;ref&gt;Huesemann, Michael H., and Joyce A. Huesemann (2011). [http://www.newtechnologyandsociety.org  ''Technofix: Why Technology Won’t Save Us or the Environment''], New Society Publishers, Gabriola Island, British Columbia, Canada, {{ISBN|0865717044}}, 464 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents of degrowth argue that decreasing demand is the only way of permanently closing the demand gap. For renewable resources, demand, and therefore production, must also be brought down to levels that prevent depletion and are environmentally healthy. Moving toward a society that is not dependent on oil is seen as essential to avoiding [[societal collapse]] when non-renewable resources are depleted.&lt;ref&gt;Resilience.org. (October 20, 2009). Peak Oil Reports. http://www.resilience.org/stories/2009-10-20/peak-oil-reports-oct-20&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ecological footprint===
{{Main article|Ecological footprint}}

The ecological footprint is a measure of human demand on the Earth's ecosystems. It compares human demand with planet Earth's ecological capacity to regenerate. It represents the amount of biologically productive land and sea area needed to regenerate the resources a human 
population consumes and to absorb and render harmless the corresponding [[waste]].
According to a 2005 [[Global Footprint Network]] report,&lt;ref name=footprintnetwork&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.footprintnetwork.org/en/index.php/GFN/page/data_sources/|title=Data Sources|work=footprintnetwork.org|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091001074513/http://www.footprintnetwork.org/en/index.php/GFN/page/data_sources/|archivedate=2009-10-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; inhabitants of high-income countries live off of 6.4 [[global hectare]]s (gHa), while those from low-income countries live off of a single gHa. For example, while each inhabitant of 
[[Bangladesh]] lives off of what they produce from 0.56 gHa, a [[North America]]n requires 12.5 gHa. Each inhabitant of North America uses 22.3 times as much land as a Bangladeshi. According to the same report, the average number of global hectares per person was 2.1, 
while current consumption levels have reached 2.7 hectares per person. In order for the world's population to attain the living standards typical of European countries, the resources of between three and eight planet [[Earth]]s would be required with current levels of efficiency and means of production. In order for world [[economic equality]] to be achieved with the current available resources, proponents say rich countries would have to reduce their [[standard of living]] through degrowth. The constraints on resources would eventually lead to a forced reduction in consumption. Controlled reduction of consumption would 
reduce the trauma of this change assuming no [[technological change]]s increase the planet's [[carrying capacity]].

=== Degrowth and sustainable development&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Farewell to Growth|last=Latouche|first=Serge|publisher=Polity Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0-7456-4616-9|location=Cambridge|pages=9-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; ===
Degrowth thought is in opposition to all forms of [[productivism]] (the belief that economic productivity and growth is the purpose of human organization).  It is, thus, opposed to the current form of [[sustainable development]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://degrowth.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Lorek-_Fuchs-2013.pdf|title=Strong sustainable consumption governance - precondition for a degrowth path?}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While the concern for 
[[sustainability]] does not contradict degrowth, sustainable development is rooted in mainstream [[international development|development]] ideas that aim to increase capitalist growth and consumption. Degrowth therefore sees sustainable development as an [[oxymoron]],&lt;ref name=Latouche/&gt; as any development based on growth in a finite and environmentally stressed world is seen as inherently unsustainable. 
Critics of degrowth argue that a slowing of [[economic growth]] would result in increased [[unemployment]], increase [[poverty]] and decrease income per capita. Many who understand the devastating environmental consequences of growth still advocate for economic growth in the South, even if not in the North. But, a slowing of economic growth would fail to deliver the benefits of degrowth—self-sufficiency, material responsibility—and would indeed lead to decreased 
employment. Rather, degrowth proponents advocate for a complete abandonment of the current (growth) economic system, suggesting that relocalizing and abandoning the global economy in the [[Global South]] would allow people of the South to become more self-sufficient and would end the overconsumption and exploitation of Southern resources by the North.&lt;ref name=Latouche&gt;Latouche, S. (2004).&gt;[https://mondediplo.com/2004/11/14latouche Degrowth Economics: Why less should be so much more.] ''Le Monde 
Diplomatique''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==="The rebound effect"===
{{Main article|Rebound effect (conservation)}}
Technologies designed to reduce resource use and improve efficiency are often touted as sustainable or green solutions. Degrowth literature, however, warns about these technological advances due to the "[[Rebound effect (conservation)|rebound effect]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zehner|first=Ozzie|title=Green Illusions|year=2012|publisher=U. Neb. Pr.|location=Lincoln|pages=172–73, 333–34}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This concept is based on observations that when a less resource-exhaustive technology is introduced, [[Jevons paradox|behaviour surrounding the use of that technology may change]], and consumption of that technology could increase or even offset any potential resource savings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Binswanger |first=M. |year=2001 |title=Technological Progress and Sustainable Development: What About the Rebound Effect? |journal=Ecological Economics |volume=36 |issue=1 |pages=119–32 |doi=10.1016/S0921-8009(00)00214-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In light of the rebound effect, proponents of degrowth hold that the only effective 'sustainable' solutions must involve a complete rejection of the growth paradigm and a move toward a degrowth paradigm. There are also fundamental limits to technological solutions in the pursuit of degrowth, as all engagements with technology increase the cumulutive matter-energy throughput.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Heikkurinen|first=Pasi|title=Degrowth by means of technology?

==Origins of the movement==
{{Refimprove section|date=April 2013}}
The contemporary degrowth movement can trace its roots back to the anti-industrialist trends of the 19th century, developed in Great Britain by [[John Ruskin]], [[William Morris]] and the [[Arts and Crafts movement]] (1819–1900), in the United States by [[Henry David Thoreau]] (1817–1862), and in Russia by [[Leo Tolstoy]] (1828–1910).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of "degrowth" proper appeared during the 1970s, proposed by [[André Gorz]] (1972) and intellectuals such as [[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen]], [[Jean Baudrillard]], [[Edward Goldsmith]] and [[Ivan Illich]], whose ideas reflect those of earlier thinkers, such as the economist [[E. J. Mishan]],&lt;ref&gt;Mishan, Ezra J., ''The Costs of Economic Growth'', Staples Press, 1967&lt;/ref&gt; the industrial historian [[L. T. C. Rolt|Tom Rolt]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Rolt|first=L.

The writings of [[Mahatma Gandhi]] and [[J. C. Kumarappa]] also contain similar philosophies, particularly regarding his support of [[Simple living|voluntary simplicity]].

More generally, degrowth movements draw on the values of [[humanism]], [[Age of Enlightenment|enlightenment]], [[anthropology]] and [[human rights]].&lt;ref&gt;D’Alisa, G., Demaria, F., Cattaneo, C.

=== Club of Rome reports ===
In 1968, the [[Club of Rome]], a [[think tank]] headquartered in [[Winterthur]], [[Switzerland]], asked researchers at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] for a report on practical solutions to problems of global concern. The report, called ''[[The Limits to Growth]]'', published in 1972, became the first important study that indicated the ecological perils of the unprecedented economic growth the world was experiencing at the time.

The reports (also known as the Meadows Reports) are not strictly the founding texts of the degrowth movement, as these reports only advise [[Steady-state economy|zero growth]], and have also been used to support the [[sustainable development]] movement. Still, they are considered the first official studies explicitly presenting economic growth as a key reason for the increase in global [[environmental issue|environmental problems]] such as pollution, shortage of raw materials, and the destruction of [[ecosystem]]s. A second report was published in 1974, and together with the first, drew considerable attention to the topic.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

=== Lasting influence of Georgescu-Roegen ===
{{Main article|Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen}}
{{See also | Steady-state economy #Declining-state economy }}

The degrowth movement recognises [[Romanian Americans|Romanian American]] [[mathematician]], [[statistician]] and [[economist]] [[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen]] as the main intellectual figure inspiring the movement.&lt;ref name=sl01/&gt;{{rp|13–16}} &lt;ref name=ck01/&gt;{{rp|548f}} &lt;ref name=jm01/&gt;{{rp|1742}} &lt;ref name=mb01/&gt;{{rp|xi}} &lt;ref name=gd01/&gt;{{rp|1f}} In his magnum opus on [[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen#Magnum opus on The Entropy Law and the Economic Process|''The Entropy Law and the Economic Process'']], Georgescu-Roegen argues that economic scarcity is rooted in physical reality; that all [[natural resource]]s are irreversibly degraded when put to use in economic activity; that the [[Sustainability#Carrying capacity|carrying capacity]] of Earth—that is, Earth's capacity to sustain human populations and consumption levels—is bound to decrease sometime in the future as Earth's finite stock of mineral resources is presently being extracted and put to use; and consequently, that the [[world economy]] as a whole is heading towards an inevitable future collapse.&lt;ref name=ngr01/&gt;

Georgescu-Roegen's intellectual inspiration to degrowth goes back to the 1970s.&lt;ref name="Levallois2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Levallois|first1=Clément|title=Can de-growth be considered a policy option? A historical note on Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen and the Club of Rome|journal=Ecological Economics|volume=69|issue=11|year=2010|pages=2271–2278|issn=09218009|doi=10.1016/j.ecolecon.2010.06.020}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Georgescu-Roegen delivered a lecture at the [[University of Geneva]] in 1974, he made a lasting impression on the young and newly graduated French historian and philosopher {{ill|Jacques Grinevald|fr}}, who had earlier been introduced to [[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen#Magnum opus on The Entropy Law and the Economic Process|Georgescu-Roegen's magnum opus]] by an academic advisor. Georgescu-Roegen and Grinevald soon made friends, and Grinevald started devoting his research to a closer study of Georgescu-Roegen's work. As a result, in 1979 Grinevald published a French translation of a selection of Georgescu-Roegen's articles entitled ''Demain la décroissance: Entropie – Écologie – Économie'' ('Tomorrow, the Decline: Entropy – Ecology – Economy').&lt;ref name=ngr03/&gt; Georgescu-Roegen, who spoke French fluently, personally approved the use of the term ''décroissance'' in the title of the French translation. The book gained influence in French intellectual and academic circles from the outset. Later, the book was expanded and republished in 1995, and once again in 2006; however, the word ''Demain'' ('Tomorrow') was removed from the title of the book in these second and third editions.&lt;ref name=jm01/&gt;{{rp|1742}}&lt;ref name=ngr03/&gt; &lt;ref name=jg01/&gt;{{rp|15f}}

By the time Grinevald suggested the term ''décroissance'' to form part of the title of the French translation of Georgescu-Roegen's work, this term had already disseminated through French intellectual circles since the early 1970s to signify a deliberate political action to downscale the economy on a permanent and voluntary basis.&lt;ref name=fd01/&gt;{{rp|195}} Simultaneously, but independently hereof, Georgescu-Roegen had criticised the ideas of ''[[The Limits to Growth]]'' and [[Herman Daly]]'s [[Steady-state economy#Herman Daly's concept of a steady-state economy|steady-state economy]] in his pointed and polemical article on ''Energy and Economic Myths'', delivered as a series of lectures from 1972 and onwards at various places, but not published in print before 1975. In this article, Georgescu-Roegen stated the following view:

{{cquote | [Authors who] were set exclusively on proving the impossibility of growth ... were easily deluded by a simple, now widespread, but false [[syllogism]]: Since exponential growth in a finite world leads to disasters of all kinds, ecological salvation lies in the stationary state. ... The crucial error consists in not seeing that not only growth, but also a zero-growth state, nay, even a declining state which does not converge toward annihilation, cannot exist forever in a finite environment.&lt;ref name=ngr02/&gt;{{rp|366f}}&lt;br&gt;... [T]he important, yet unnoticed point [is] that ''the necessary conclusion of the arguments in favor of that vision'' [of a stationary state] ''is that the most desirable state is not a stationary, but a declining one.'' Undoubtedly, the current growth must cease, nay, be reversed.&lt;ref name=ngr02/&gt;{{rp|368f}} [Emphasis in original] }}

When reading this particular passage of the text, Grinevald realised that no professional economist of any orientation had ever reasoned like this before. Grinevald also realised the striking conceptual resemblance between Georgescu-Roegen's viewpoint and the French debates progressing by the time; this resemblance then transformed into the title of the French edition. Taken together, the translation of Georgescu-Roegen's work into French ''both'' fed on ''and'' gave further impetus to the concept of ''décroissance'' in the country—and everywhere else in the francophone world—thereby creating something of an intellectual feedback loop.&lt;ref name=jm01/&gt;{{rp|1742}} &lt;ref name=jg01/&gt;{{rp|15f}} &lt;ref name=fd01/&gt;{{rp|197f}}

By the 2000s, when ''décroissance'' was to be translated from French and back into English as the catchy banner for the new social movement, the original term 'decline' was now deemed inappropriate and misdirected for the purpose: 'Decline' usually refers to an unexpected, unwelcome and temporary economic [[recession]], something bad to be avoided or quickly overcome. Instead, the [[neologism]] 'degrowth' was coined to signify a deliberate political action to downscale the economy on a permanent and voluntary basis—as in the prevailing French usage of the term—something good to be welcomed and maintained, or so followers believe.&lt;ref name=ck01/&gt;{{rp|548}} &lt;ref name=jg01/&gt;{{rp|15f}} &lt;ref name=gk01/&gt;{{rp|874–876}}

When the first international degrowth conference of its kind was held in Paris in 2008, the participants bestowed a generous amount of credit and appreciation on Georgescu-Roegen and his work.&lt;ref name=ff01/&gt;{{rp|15f, 28, ''et passim''}} Further, in his [[manifesto]] on ''Petit traité de la décroissance sereine'' ('Farewell to Growth'), leading French champion of the degrowth movement [[Serge Latouche]] has credited Georgescu-Roegen as 'a main theoretical source of degrowth.'&lt;ref name=sl01/&gt;{{rp|13–16}} Likewise, Italian degrowth theorist [[Mauro Bonaiuti]] has considered Georgescu-Roegen's work to be 'one of the analytical cornerstones of the degrowth perspective.'&lt;ref name=mb01/&gt;{{rp|xi}}

=== Serge Latouche ===
[[File:Serge Latouche - Festival Economia 2012.JPG|thumb|200px|Serge Latouche]]
[[Serge Latouche]], a professor of economics at the [[University of Paris-Sud]], has noted that:

{{quote|If you try to measure the reduction in the rate of growth by taking into account damages caused to the environment and its consequences on our natural and cultural patrimony, you will generally obtain a result of zero or even negative growth. In 1991, the United States spent 115 billion dollars, or 2.1% of the [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] on the protection of the environment. The [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]] increased this cost by 45 or 55 million dollars per year. [...] The [[World Resources Institute]] tried to measure the rate of the growth taking into account the punishment exerted on the [[natural capital]] of the world, with an eye towards sustainable development. For Indonesia, it found that the rate of growth between 1971 and 1984 would be reduced from 7.1 to 4% annually, and that was by taking only three variables into consideration: [[deforestation]], the reduction in the reserves of oil and natural gas, and [[soil erosion]].&lt;ref&gt;Hervé Kempf, ''L'économie à l'épreuve de l'écologie'' Hatier&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Latouche, Serge (2003) ''Decrecimiento y post-desarrollo'' El viejo topo, p.62&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Schumacher and Buddhist economics ===
[[E. F. Schumacher]]'s 1973 book ''[[Small Is Beautiful]]'' predates a unified degrowth movement, but nonetheless serves as an important basis for degrowth ideas. In this book he critiques the [[Neoliberalism|neo-liberal]] model of economic development, arguing that an increasing "standard of living", based on consumption, is absurd as a goal of economic activity and development. Instead, under what he refers to as [[Buddhist economics]], we should aim to maximize well-being while minimizing consumption.&lt;ref&gt;Schumacher, E. F. (1973). Small is Beautiful: Economics as if People Mattered. New York: Perennial Library.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ecological and social issues ===
In January 1972 [[Edward Goldsmith]] and Robert Prescott-Allen—editors of ''[[The Ecologist]]'' journal—published ''[[A Blueprint for Survival]]'', which called for a radical programme of decentralisation and [[deindustrialization]] to prevent what the authors referred to as ''"the breakdown of society and the irreversible disruption of the life-support systems on this planet"''.

== Degrowth movement ==

===Conferences===
The movement has also included international conferences,&lt;ref name="MOINS12"&gt;{{fr}} « La genèse du Réseau Objection de Croissance en Suisse », Julien Cart, in ''[[Moins!]]'', journal [[Suisse romande|romand]] d'écologie politique, n°12, juillet-août 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; promoted by the network Research&amp;Degrowth (R&amp;D),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://degrowth.org/|title=Research &amp; Degrowth|accessdate=23 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Paris]] (2008),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://events.it-sudparis.eu/degrowthconference/|title=Décroissance économique pour la soutenabilité écologique et l'équité sociale|accessdate=16 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Barcelona]] (2010),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://barcelona.degrowth.org/|title=Degrowth Conference Barcelona 2010|accessdate=6 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Montreal]] (2012),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://montreal.degrowth.org/|title=International Conference on Degrowth in the Americas}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Venice]] (2012),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.venezia2012.it/|title=International Degrowth Conference Venezia 2012 |accessdate=5 Dec 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leipzig]] (2014), [[Budapest]] (2016),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://degrowth.org/2015/03/26/5-international-degrowth-conference-budapest-2016/|accessdate=2018-01-31|title=5^ International Degrowth Conference in Budapest}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Malmö]] (2018).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://malmo.degrowth.org|title=Dialogues in turbulent times|website=Dialogues in turbulent times|language=en-US|access-date=2018-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Barcelona Conference (2010)===
The First International Conference on Economic Degrowth for Ecological Sustainability and Social Equity of [[Paris]] (2008) was a discussion about the financial, social, cultural, demographic, environmental crisis caused by the deficiencies of [[capitalism]] and an explanation of the main principles of the degrowth.&lt;ref&gt;''Declaration of the Paris 2008 Conference''. Retrieved from: http://degrowth.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Declaration-Degrowth-Paris-2008.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The Second International Conference of [[Barcelona]] on the other hand focused on specific ways to implement a degrowth society.

Concrete proposals have been developed for future political actions, including:
* Promotion of [[Local currency|local currencies]], elimination of [[fiat money]] and reforms of [[interest]]
* Transition to non-profit and small scale companies
* Increase of local commons and support of participative approaches in [[decision-making]]
* Reducing working hours and facilitation of [[volunteering|volunteer work]]
* Reusing empty housing and [[cohousing]]
* Introduction of the [[basic income]] and an income ceiling built on a maximum-minimum ratio
* Limitation of the [[exploitation of natural resources]] and preservation of the [[biodiversity]] and culture by regulations, taxes and compensations
* Minimize the [[waste]] production with education and legal instruments
* Elimination of mega infrastructures, transition from a car-based system to a more local, biking, walking-based one.
* Suppression of advertising from the public space&lt;ref&gt;2nd Conference on Economic Degrowth for Ecological Sustainability and Social Ethic. 2010. ''Degrowth Declaration Barcelona 2010'' and ''Working Groups Results''. Retrieved from: http://barcelona.degrowth.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

In spite of the real willingness of reform and the development of numerous solutions, the conference of Barcelona didn’t have a big influence on the world economic and political system. Many critiques have been made concerning the proposals, mostly about the financial aspects, and this has refrained changes to occur.&lt;ref&gt;Responsabilité, Innovation &amp; Management. 2011. ''Décroissance économique pour l’écologie, l’équité et le bien-vivre par François SCHNEIDER.'' Retrieved from http://www.openrim.org/Decroissance-economique-pour-l.html&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Degrowth around the world ===
Although not explicitly called Degrowth, movements using similar concepts and terminologies can be found around the world, such as Buen Vivir&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/blog/buen-vivir-philosophy-south-america-eduardo-gudynas|title=Buen vivir: the social philosophy inspiring movements in South America|last=Balch|first=Oliver|date=2013-02-04|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=2016-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Latin America or Eco-Swaraj&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://degrowthcanada.wordpress.com/2015/12/28/alternatives-to-sustainable-development-buen-vivir-degrowth-and-eco-swaraj/|title="Alternatives to Sustainable Development: Buen vivir, Degrowth and Eco-Swaraj"|last=Thomson|first=Bob|date=2015-12-28|website=Degrowth / Decroissance Canada|access-date=2016-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; in India.

=== Relation to other social movements ===
The degrowth movement has a variety of relations to other social movements and alternative economic visions, which range from collaboration to partial overlap. The Konzeptwerk Neue Ökonomie (Laboratory for New Economic Ideas), which hosted the 2014 international Degrowth conference in Leipzig, has published a project entitled “Degrowth in movement(s)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.degrowth.info/en/dim/degrowth-in-movements/|title=Degrowth in movement(s)|accessdate=8 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;” in 2017, which maps relationships with 32 other social movements and initiatives.

== Criticisms ==
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2013}}

===Marxist critique===
{{See also | Steady-state economy #Capitalism without growth }}
[[Marxism|Marxists]] distinguish between two types of growth: that which is useful to mankind, and that which simply exists to increase profits for companies. Marxists consider that it is the nature and control of production that is the determinant, and not the quantity. They believe that control and a strategy for growth are the pillars that enable social and economic development. According to Jean Zin, while the justification for degrowth is valid, it is not a solution to the problem.&lt;ref&gt;''L'écologie politique à l'ère de l'information'', Ere, 2006, p. 68-69&lt;/ref&gt;
However, other Marxist writers have adopted positions close to the de-growth perspective.  For example, [[John Bellamy Foster]]&lt;ref name="The Ecological Rift"&gt;https://monthlyreview.org/press/books/pb2181/, Monthly Review Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and Fred Magdoff,&lt;ref name="Harmony and Ecological Civilization, Monthly review, Vol 44 (2), 1-9"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://monthlyreview.org/2012/06/01/harmony-and-ecological-civilization|title=Harmony and Ecological Civilization: Beyond the Capitalist Alienation of Nature|work=Monthly Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; in common with [[David Harvey]], [[Immanuel Wallerstein]], [[Paul Sweezy]] and others focus on endless [[capital accumulation]] as the basic principle and goal of capitalism.  This is the source of economic growth and, in the view of these writers, is unsustainable.  Foster and Magdoff develop Marx's own concept of the metabolic rift, something he noted in the exhaustion of soils by capitalist systems of food production, though this is not unique to capitalist systems of food production as seen in the [[Aral Sea]].

===Systems theoretical critique===
In stressing the negative rather than the positive side(s) of growth, the majority of degrowth proponents remains focused on (de-)growth, thus co-performing and further sustaining the actually criticised unsustainable growth obsession. One way out of this paradox might be in changing the reductionist vision of growth as ultimately economic concept, which proponents of both growth and degrowth commonly imply, for a broader concept of growth that allows for the observation of growth in other [[Differentiation (sociology)|function systems]] of society. A corresponding recoding of growth-obsessed or capitalist organisations has recently been proposed.&lt;ref name="Growth and function. A viral research program for next organizations, International Journal of Technology Management"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://steffenroth.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/15-12-15-growth-and-function1.pdf|last=Roth|first=Steffen|title=Growth and function.

A '''dene''', derived from the [[Old English]] ''denu'' and frequently spelled '''dean''', used to be a common name for a valley, in which sense it is frequently found as a component of English place-names, such as [[Rottingdean]] and [[Ovingdean]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Oxford English Dictionary, 2nd Ed}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the English counties of [[County Durham|Durham]] and [[Northumberland]] a dene is a steep-sided wooded valley through which a [[Burn (topography)|burn]] runs. Many of the incised valleys cut by small streams that flow off the Durham and Northumberland plateau into the [[North Sea]] are given the name Dene, as in [[Castle Eden Dene]] and [[Crimdon Dene]] in Durham and [[Jesmond Dene]] in [[Tyne and Wear]].

'''Digital Earth''' is the name given to a concept by former US vice president [[Al Gore]] in 1998, describing a virtual representation of the [[Earth]] that is [[georeference]]d and connected to the world’s digital knowledge archives.
{{TOC right}}

==Concept==

===Original vision===
In a speech&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.digitalearth-isde.org/userfiles/The_Digital_Earth_Understanding_our_planet_in_the_21st_Century.doc|title = The Digital Earth - Al Gore|publisher = digitalearth-isde.org|date = 1998-01-31|accessdate = 2015-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; prepared for the [[California Science Center]] in Los Angeles on January 31, 1998, Gore described a digital future where schoolchildren - indeed all the world's citizens - could interact with a computer-generated three-dimensional spinning [[Virtual Globe|virtual globe]] and access vast amounts of scientific and cultural information to help them understand the Earth and its human activities.  The greater part of this knowledge store would be free to all via the Internet, however a commercial marketplace of related products and services was envisioned to co-exist, in part in order to support the expensive infrastructure such a system would require. The origin of the idea can be traced back to [[Buckminster Fuller]]'s [[Geoscope]], a large spherical display to represent geographic phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Evolution and implementation of the Digital Earth vision, technology and society|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17538940701782502|journal = International Journal of Digital Earth|date = 2008-03-01|issn = 1753-8947|pages = 4–16|volume = 1|issue = 1|doi = 10.1080/17538940701782502|first = T. W.|last = Foresman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many aspects of his proposal have been realized - for instance, [[Virtual Globe|virtual globe geo-browsers]] such as [[NASA World Wind]], [[Google Earth]] and Microsoft's [[Bing Maps]] 3D for commercial, social and scientific applications. But the Gore speech outlined a truly global, collaborative linking of systems that has yet to happen. That vision has been continually interpreted and defined by the growing global community of interest described below. The Digital Earth imagined in the speech has been defined as an "organizing vision" to steer scientists and technologists towards a shared goal, promising substantial advances in many scientific and engineering areas, similar to the [[Information superhighway]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The myth of the Digital Earth between fragmentation and wholeness|url = http://wi.mobilities.ca/myth-of-the-digital-earth|journal = Journal of Mobile Media|date = 2014|first = Andrea|last = Ballatore}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===An emerging view===
Two noteworthy excerpts from the Beijing Declaration on Digital Earth,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://159.226.224.4/isde6en/hykx11.html |title=The 6th International Symposium on Digital Earth - Digital Earth in Action |publisher=159.226.224.4 |date=2009-09-12 |accessdate=2012-09-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120227195943/http://159.226.224.4/isde6en/hykx11.html |archivedate=2012-02-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ratified September 12, 2009 at the 6th International Symposium on Digital Earth in Beijing:

:"Digital Earth is an integral part of other advanced technologies including: earth observation, geo-information systems, global positioning systems, communication networks, sensor webs, electromagnetic identifiers, virtual reality, grid computation, etc. It is seen as a global strategic contributor to scientific and technological developments, and will be a catalyst in finding solutions to international scientific and societal issues."

:"Digital Earth should play a strategic and sustainable role in addressing such challenges to human society as natural resource depletion, food and water insecurity, energy shortages, environmental degradation, natural disasters response, population explosion, and, in particular, global climate change."

===Next-generation digital Earth===
A group of international geographic and environmental scientists from government, industry, and academia brought together by the Vespucci Initiative for the Advancement of Geographic Information Science,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vespucci.org/ |title=Vespucci Initiative |publisher=Vespucci.org |date= |accessdate=2012-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/jrc/index.cfm |title=Joint Research Centre - JRC - European Commission |publisher=Ec.europa.eu |date=2012-07-15 |accessdate=2012-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; recently published "Next-Generation Digital Earth" a position paper&lt;ref name="ngde"&gt;{{cite web|author=M. Craglia, et al (2008)|title=Next-Generation Digital Earth. ''International Journal of Spatial Data Infrastructures Research'', (3):146-167| url=http://ijsdir.jrc.ec.europa.eu/index.php/ijsdir/article/viewFile/119/99|accessdate=2012-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; that suggests its eight key elements:

# Not one Digital Earth, but multiple connected globes/infrastructures addressing the needs of different audiences: citizens, communities, policymakers, scientists, educationalists.
# Problem oriented: e.g. environment, health, societal benefit areas, and transparent on the impacts of technologies on the environment
# Allowing search through time and space to find similar/analogue situations with real time data from both sensors and humans (different from what existing GIS can do, and different from adding analytical functions to a virtual globe)
# Asking questions about change, identification of anomalies in space in both human and environmental domains (flag things that are not consistent with their surroundings in real time)
# Enabling access to data, information, services, and models as well as scenarios and forecasts: from simple queries to complex analyses across the environmental and social domains.
# Supporting the visualization of abstract concepts and data types (e.g. low income, poor health, and semantics)
# Based on open access, and participation across multiple technological platforms, and media (e.g. text, voice and multi-media)
# Engaging, interactive, exploratory, and a laboratory for learning and for multidisciplinary education and science.

==Key developments==
Significant progress towards Digital Earth has been achieved over the last decade as collected in a survey paper by Mahdavi-Amiri et al.,&lt;ref name="survey"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.cag.2015.08.005 | last1 = Mahdavi-Amiri | first1 = A. | last2 = Alderson| first2 = T. | last3 = Samavati | first3 = S. | year = 2015 | title = A Survey of Digital Earth | url = | journal = Computers &amp; Graphics | volume = 53 | pages = 95–117 }}&lt;/ref&gt; including work in these categories:

===Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI)===
The number of [[Spatial Data Infrastructure]]s has grown steadily since the early 1990s, aided in part by interoperability standards maintained by the [[Open Geospatial Consortium]] and the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO). Significant recent efforts to link and coordinate SDI's include [[INSPIRE|Infrastructure for Spatial Information in Europe (INSPIRE)]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://inspire.jrc.ec.europa.eu |title=Inspire &gt; Welcome To Inspire |publisher=Inspire.jrc.ec.europa.eu |date= |accessdate=2012-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [https://web.archive.org/web/20090622072115/http://www.ungiwg.org/unsdi.htm UNSDI] Initiative of the UN Geographic Information Working Group (UNIGWG).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ungiwg.org/ |title=UN Geographic Information Working Group|publisher=Ungiwg.org|accessdate=2012-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1998 and 2001, the NASA-chaired Interagency Digital Earth Working Group (IDEW) contributed to this growth with a particular focus on interoperability issues,&lt;ref name="kg"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-9671.2008.01090.x | last1 = Grossner | first1 = K. | last2 = Goodchild | first2 = M. | last3 = Clarke | first3 = K. | year = 2008 | title = Defining a Digital Earth System | url = | journal = Transactions in GIS | volume = 12 | issue = 1| pages = 145–160 }}&lt;/ref&gt; giving rise to the [[Web Map Service]] standard among others.

===Geobrowsers===
The scientific use of geo-browser [[Virtual Globe|virtual globes]] such as [[Google Earth]], [[NASA World Wind|NASA's World Wind]], and [[Environmental Systems Research Institute|ESRI]]'s [[ArcGIS Explorer]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esri.com/software/arcgis/explorer/index.html |title=ArcGIS Explorer &amp;#124; GIS Viewer &amp;#124; Free GIS Software &amp; Maps |publisher=Esri.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; has grown significantly as their functionality has improved and with the [[KML|KML format]] having become the de facto standard for globe visualizations. Numerous examples can be viewed at the Google Earth Outreach Showcase&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://earth.google.com/outreach/showcase.html|title=Get Inspired|website=earth.google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and at the World Wind Java Demo Applications and Applets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://worldwind.arc.nasa.gov/java/demos/|title=Demos-WorldWind Java/NASA WorldWind|website=worldwind.arc.nasa.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sensor networks===
Geosensors are defined as "...any device receiving and measuring environmental stimuli that can be geographically referenced."&lt;ref name="ngde" /&gt; Large scale networks of geosensors have been in place for many years, measuring Earth surface, hydrological and atmospheric phenomena. The advent of the Internet led to a large expansion of such networks,&lt;ref name="ngde" /&gt; and efforts like [[GEOSS|Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS) Initiative]] aim to connect them.

===Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI)===
The term [[Volunteered Geographic Information]] was coined in 2007 by geographer [[Michael Goodchild]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Goodchild | first1 = M.F. | year = 2007 | title = Citizens as sensors: the world of volunteered geography | url = | journal = Journal of Geography | volume = 69 | issue = 4| pages = 211–221 | doi=10.1007/s10708-007-9111-y}}&lt;/ref&gt; referring to the rapidly growing volume of social and scientific [[georeference]]d [[user-generated content]] being made available on the Web by both expert and non-expert individuals and groups. This phenomenon is seen as an emerging [[GeoWeb|Geoweb]] that provides [[API|Application Programming Interfaces (API's)]] to software developers and increasingly user-friendly [[Web mapping|web mapping software]] to both scientists and the public at large.

===International community===

====International Symposia on Digital Earth (ISDE)====
There have been seven ISDE symposia and three Digital Earth Summits. Proceedings for many of them&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitalearth-isde.org/proceedings/17.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828225224/http://www.digitalearth-isde.org/proceedings/17.html |date=August 28, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; are available. The 7th Symposium was held in Perth, Western Australia in 2011. 
The 4th Digital Earth Summit&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=&amp;copy; 4th Digital Earth Summit 2012 - All rights reserved. |url=http://www.digitalearth12.org.nz/ |title=4th Digital Earth Summit 2012 &amp;#124; Home |publisher=Digitalearth12.org.nz |date=2012-09-04 |accessdate=2012-09-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121022145000/http://digitalearth12.org.nz/ |archivedate=2012-10-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; was held in Wellington, New Zealand in September, 2012.

====International Journal of Digital Earth====
The International Journal of Digital Earth is a peer-reviewed research journal, launched in 2008, concerned with the science and technology of Digital Earth and its applications in all major disciplines.

====International Society for Digital Earth====
This is a non-political, non-governmental and not-for-profit international organization, principally for promotion of academic exchange, science and technology innovation, education, and international collaboration.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitalearth-isde.org/index.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101126110902/http://www.digitalearth-isde.org/index.html |date=November 26, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Digital Earth Reference Model (DERM)===
{{main article|Digital Earth Reference Model}}
The term Digital Earth Reference Model (DERM) was coined by Tim Foresman in context with a vision for an all encompassing geospatial platform as an abstract for information flow in support of Al Gore’s vision for a Digital Earth.&lt;ref&gt;Tim Foresman conversation with Charles Herring in New Zealand, Digital Earth Convention, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  The Digital Earth reference model seeks to facilitate and promote the use of georeferenced information from multiple sources over the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=John D. |last=Evans |title=NASA Digital Earth Office |date=June 2001 |url=http://www.cartome.org/draft-derm.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081010193636/http://www.cartome.org/draft-derm.htm |archivedate=2008-10-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  
A '''digital Earth reference model''' defines a fixed global reference frame for the Earth using four principles of a [[Digital data|digital system]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Perry R. Peterson |author2=Gene Girard |author3=Charles Herring |year=2006 |url=http://www.pyxisinnovation.com/pyxwiki/index.php?title=Digital_Earth_Reference_Model |title=Digital Earth Reference Model |publisher=Pyxisinnovation.com |date= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; namely:
#'''Discrete partitioning''' using regular or irregular cell mesh, tiling or [[Grid (spatial index)|Grid]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Sahr K.D. White |author2=A.J. Kimerling |year=2003 |title=Geodesic Discrete Global Grid Systems -  Cartography and Geographic Information Science, Vol 30, No. 2, pp. 121-134 |url=http://www.sou.edu/cs/sahr/dgg/pubs/gdggs03.pdf |format=PDF |work=Survey of Discrete Global Grids |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080911231823/http://www.sou.edu/cs/sahr/dgg/pubs/gdggs03.pdf |archivedate=2008-09-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
#'''Data acquisition''' using signal processing theory ([[Sampling (signal processing)|sampling]] and [[Quantization (signal processing)|quantizing]]) for assigning binary values from [[Continuum (theory)|continuous]] [[Analog signal|analog]] or other digital sources to the discrete cell partitions;
#An '''ordering or naming of cells''' that can provide both unique [[spatial index]]ing and [[Geographic coordinate system|geographic location address]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Ali |last1=Mahdavi-Amiri |first2=Faramarz|last2=Samavati |first3=Perry |last3=Peterson|title=CATEGORIZATION AND CONVERSIONS FOR INDEXING METHODS OF DISCRETE GLOBAL GRID SYSTEMS| url= http://www.mdpi.com/2220-9964/4/1/320| journal = International Journal of Geoinformation | volume = 4 | issue=1 |year=2014| pages = 320–336}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#A set of '''mathematical operations''' built on the indexing for algebraic, geometric, Boolean and image processing transforms, etc.

The Open Geospatial Consortium has a spatial reference system standard based on the DERM called a [Discrete Global Grid] System (DGGS).  According to OGC ''"a DGGS is a spatial reference system that uses a hierarchical tessellation of cells to partition and address the globe. DGGS are characterized by the properties of their cell structure, geo-encoding, quantization strategy and associated mathematical functions. The OGC DGGS standard supports the specification of standardized DGGS infrastructures that enable the integrated analysis of very large, multi-source, multi-resolution, multi-dimensional, distributed geospatial data. Interoperability between OGC DGGS implementations is anticipated through extension interface encodings of OGC Web Services."''&lt;ref&gt;OGC Discrete Global Grid System (DGGS) Core Standard&lt;/ref&gt;. Thus, the DGGS is a discrete, hierarchical, information grid with an addressing (or indexing) scheme to assign unique addresses to each cell across the entire DGGS Domain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.globalgridsystems.com/assets/images/landing/Docs/Position%2087%20Discrete%20Global%20Grid%20Systems.pd |title=Discrete global positions |website=www.globalgridsystems.com |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Background==

===United States===
Technology developments that support the current Digital Earth technological framework can be traced to U.S. computing advances derived from [[Cold War|the Cold War]] competition, [[Space Race|the space race]], and commercial innovations.  Therefore, many innovations can be tracked to corporations working for the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] or [[NASA]].  However, the philosophical foundations for Digital Earth can be more closely aligned with the increased awareness of global changes and the need to better understand the concepts of sustainability for the planet’s survival.  These roots can be traced back to visionaries such as [[Buckminster Fuller]] who proposed development of a [[Geoscope|GeoScope]] half a century ago, analogous to a microscope to examine and improve our understanding of [[Earth|the planet Earth]].

From Fall 1998 until Fall 2000, NASA led the U.S. Digital Earth initiative in cooperation with its sister government agencies, including the Federal Geospatial Data Committee (FGDC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fgdc.gov|title=The Federal Geographic Data Committee — Federal Geographic Data Committee|website=www.fgdc.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attention to consensus development of standards, protocols and tools through cooperative [[Testbed|test-bed]] initiatives was the primary process for advancement of this initiative within the government community.&lt;ref name="kg" /&gt;

In 1999, NASA was selected to head a new Interagency Digital Earth Working Group (IDEW), due to its reputation for technology innovations and its focus on the study of planetary change.  The new initiative was located in the NASA’s Office of [[Earth science|Earth Sciences]]. This titular focus was considered necessary to help align over 17 government agencies and keep sustainability and Earth oriented applications as a guiding principle for the Digital Earth enterprise. Components for development of 3-D Earth graphic-user-interfaces (GUIs) were placed into various technological sectors to stimulate cooperative development support.  While initially limited to government personnel, industry and academia were early observers attending IDEW workshops to discuss topics such as, visualization, [[Information integration|information fusion]], standards and interoperability, advanced computational algorithms, [[Digital library|digital libraries]] and museums.  In March 2000, at a special IDEW meeting hosted by [[Oracle Corporation]] in [[Herndon, Virginia]], industry representatives demonstrated several promising 3-D visualization prototypes.  Within two years, these were captivating international audiences, including [[Kofi Annan]] and [[Colin Powell]], in government, business, science, and [[mass media]] who began to purchase the early commercial geo-browsers. Just as the [[Blue Marble|spectacular Apollo photography of Earthrise]] provided an inspiring Earth-centric image for new generations to appreciate the fragility of our biosphere, the 3-D Digital Earths began inspiring growing numbers of people to the possibility of better understanding and possibly saving our planet.  Introduction of satellite data into commercially accessible spatial toolboxes significantly advanced the capacity to map, monitor, and manage our planet’s resources and provide a unifying perspective on the Digital Earth vision.

After Al Gore lost the [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000 presidential election]], the incoming administration considered the programmatic moniker Digital Earth a political liability. Digital Earth was relegated to a minority status within the FGDC, used primarily to define 3-D visualization reference models.

===China===
In 1999, with the Chinese government’s full backing, the inaugural [[#International Symposia on Digital Earth (ISDE)|International Symposium on Digital Earth]] in Beijing provided a venue for the extensive international support for implementing the Gore Digital Earth vision introduced a year earlier. Hundreds of digital earth cities created by governments and universities resulted.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}  In China, Digital Earth became a metaphor for modernization and automation with computers, leading to its incorporation into a five-year modernization plan.  Originating from China’s satellite [[remote sensing]] community, Digital Earth prowess spread to a range of applications including flood predictions, [[dust cloud]] modeling, environmental assessments, and [[Urban planning|city planning]]. China has been omnipresent at all international Digital Earth conferences since and has recently founded the International Society for Digital Earth, one of the first NGOs created by the [[Chinese Academy of Sciences]]. In 2009, the International Symposium on Digital Earth returned to Beijing for its 6th meeting.

===United Nations===
In 2000, the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP) advanced the Digital Earth to enhance decision-makers' access to information for then Secretary-General [[Kofi Annan]] and the [[United Nations Security Council]].  UNEP promoted use of web-based geospatial technologies with the ability to access the world’s environmental information, in association with economic and [[social policy]] issues.  A reorganization of UNEP’s data and information resources was initiated in 2001, based on the GSDI/DE&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gsdi.org|title=GSDI - Home|first=Roger Longhorn|last=(Admin)|website=www.gsdi.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; architecture for a network of distributed and interoperable databases creating a framework of linked servers.  The design concept was based upon using a growing network of internet mapping software and database content with advanced capabilities to link GIS tools and applications.  UNEP.net,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://UNEP.net|title=unep.net|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; launched in February 2001, provided UN staff with an unparalleled facility for accessing authoritative environmental data resources and a visible example to others in [[United Nations|the UN]] community.  However, a universal [[user interface]] for UNEP.net, suitable for members of Security Council, that is non-scientists, did not exist.  UNEP began actively testing prototypes for a UNEP geo-browser beginning in mid-2001 with a showcase for the African community displayed at the 5th African GIS Conference in [[Nairobi|Nairobi, Kenya]] November 2001.  Keyhole Technology, Inc. (later purchased in 2004 by [[Google]] and to become [[Google Earth]]) was contracted to develop and demonstrate the first full globe 3-D interactive Digital Earth using web-stream data from a [[distributed database]] located on servers around the planet.  A concerted effort within the UN community, via the Geographic Information Working Group&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ungiwg.org/|title=UNGIWG - "Free the DATA !!!!....."|website=www.ungiwg.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; (UNGIWG), followed immediately, including purchase of early Keyhole systems by 2002.  UNEP provided further public demonstrations for this early Digital Earth system at the [[World Summit on Sustainable Development]] in September, 2002 at [[Johannesburg|Johannesburg, South Africa]]. In seeking an engineering approach to system-wide development of the Digital Earth model, recommendations were made at the 3rd UNGIWG Meeting, June 2002, Washington, D.C. for creating a document on the Functional User Requirements for geo-browsers.  This proposal was communicated to the ISDE Secretariat in Beijing and the organizing committee for the 3rd [[#International Symposia on Digital Earth (ISDE)|International Symposium on Digital Earth]] and agreement was reached by the [[Chinese Academy of Sciences]]-sponsored Secretariat to host the first of the two Digital Earth geo-browser meetings.

===Japan===
Japan, led by [[Keio University]] and [[JAXA]], has also played a prominent international role in Digital Earth helping to create the Digital Asia Network&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.geoinfo.ait.ac.th/digitalasia.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-10-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080106174952/http://www.geoinfo.ait.ac.th/digitalasia.php |archivedate=2008-01-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; with a secretariat located in Bangkok to promote regional cooperation and initiatives. Citizens in the [[Gifu Prefecture]] upload information to community-scale Digital Earth programs with from their [[smartphone]]s on topics ranging from first sightings of fireflies in spring to location of blocked handicap access ramps.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

{{Unreferenced stub|auto=yes|date=December 2009}}
A '''drift station''' is a temporary or semi-permanent facility built on an [[Drift ice|ice floe]]. During the [[Cold War]] the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[United States]] maintained a number of stations in the [[Arctic Ocean]] on floes such as [[Fletcher's Ice Island]] for research and [[espionage]], the latter of which were often little more than quickly constructed shacks. Extracting personnel from these stations proved difficult and in the case of the United States, employed early versions of the [[Fulton surface-to-air recovery system]].

{{wiktionary|Edinburgh}}
The '''etymology of Edinburgh''' traces the origin of the name of [[Edinburgh]], the capital of [[Scotland]]. The city is known as ''Edinburgh'' in English, ''Embra'' in [[Scots language|Scots]], and ''Dùn Èideann'' in [[Scottish Gaelic]], which are derived from the older place name ''Eidyn''. It is generally accepted that this name derives ultimately from the [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] [[Common Brittonic]] language.&lt;ref name=Williams1972&gt;Williams 1972, p. 47; 64.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Chadwick&gt;Chadwick, p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Dumville&gt;Dumville, p. 297.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eidyn==
Several medieval Welsh sources refer to ''Eidyn''. [[Kenneth H. Jackson]] argued strongly that "Eidyn" referred exclusively to the location of modern Edinburgh,&lt;ref&gt;Jackson 1969, pp. 77-78.&lt;/ref&gt; but others, such as [[Ifor Williams]] and [[Nora K. Chadwick]], suggest it applied to the wider area as well.&lt;ref name=Williams1972/&gt;&lt;ref name=Chadwick/&gt; The name "Eidyn" may survive today in toponyms such as Edinburgh, [[Dunedin, Scotland|Dunedin]], and [[Carriden]] (from ''[[Caer]] Eidyn'', from which the modern Welsh name for Edinburgh, ''[[:cy:Caeredin|Caeredin]]'', is derived), located eighteen miles to the west.&lt;ref name=Dumville/&gt;

Present-day Edinburgh was the location of ''Din Eidyn'', a [[dun]] or [[hillfort]] associated with the kingdom of the [[Gododdin]].&lt;ref name=gododdin&gt;Gardens of the 'Gododdin' Craig Cessford Garden History, Vol. 22, No. 1 (Summer, 1994), pp. 114-115 {{doi|10.2307/1587005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''Din Eidyn'' first appears in ''[[Y Gododdin]]'', a poem that depicts events relating to the [[Battle of Catraeth]], thought to have been fought circa 600. The oldest manuscript of ''Y Gododdin'' forms part of the [[Book of Aneirin]], which dates to around 1265&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maryjones.us/ctexts/aindex.html |title=The Book of Aneirin |publisher=Maryjones.us |accessdate=2014-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; but which possibly is a copy of a lost 9th-century original. Some scholars consider that the poem was composed soon after the battle and was preserved in oral tradition while others believe it originated in Wales at some time in the 9th to 11th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Evans 1982, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; The modern Scottish Gaelic name "Dùn Èideann" derives directly from the British ''Din Eidyn''. The English form is similar, appending the element -''[[burgh]]'', from the [[Old English]] ''[[burh]]'', also meaning "fort".&lt;ref name=Room&gt;Room, pp. 118–119.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some sources claim Edinburgh's name is derived from an [[Old English]] form such as ''Edwinesburh'' (Edwin's fort), in reference to [[Edwin of Northumbria|Edwin]], king of [[Deira]] and [[Bernicia]] in the 7th century.&lt;ref&gt;Blackie, ''Geographical Etymology: A Dictionary of Place-names Giving Their Derivations'', 68.&lt;/ref&gt; However, modern scholarship refutes this, as the form ''Eidyn'' predates Edwin.&lt;ref name=Room/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gelling&gt;Gelling, Nicolaisen and Richards, pp. 88–89.&lt;/ref&gt; Stuart Harris in his book ''The Place Names of Edinburgh'' declares the "Edwinesburh" form to be a "palpable fake" dating from [[David I of Scotland|King David I]]'s time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Harris |first1=Stuart |title=The Place Names Of Edinburgh |year=1996 |location=London |isbn=1904246060 |page= 237}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Edinburgh's original [[royal charter]] granting [[royal burgh]] status is lost and the first documentary evidence of the medieval burgh is a royal charter, {{circa|1124–1127}}, by [[David I of Scotland|King David I]] granting a [[burgage|toft]] in {{lang|la|burgo meo de Edenesburg}} to the [[Dunfermline Abbey|Priory of Dunfermline]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Barrow |first1=Geoffrey |title=The Charters of King David I: The Written Acts of David I King of Scots … |page=63 |isbn=978-0851157313|year=1999 }}&lt;!--| accessdate = 28 October 2018 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that the town came into official existence between 1018 (when [[Malcolm II of Scotland|King Malcolm II]] secured the [[Lothians]] from the [[Northumbria]]ns) and 1124.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, A. (January 1942). "Two Notes on the Norse Kingdoms in Northumbria". ''The English Historical Review'', Vol. 57, No. 225, pp. 85-97&lt;/ref&gt; The founding charter of [[Holyrood Abbey]] refers to the recipients ([[Latin|in Latin]]) as "Ecclisie Sancte Crucis ''Edwin''esburgensi", by the 1170s [[William I of Scotland|King William the Lion]] was using the name "''Edenesburch''" in a charter (again in Latin) confirming the 1124 grant of David I. Documents from the 14th century show the name to have settled into its current form; although other spellings ("Edynburgh" and "Edynburghe") appear, these are simply spelling variants of the current name.

===Auld Reekie===
The city is affectionately nicknamed ''Auld Reekie'', [[Scots language|Scots]] for ''Old Smoky'', for the views from the country of the smoke covered Old Town.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Scott | first1 = Walter | authorlink1 = Walter Scott | title = The Abbot | url = http://www.online-literature.com/walter_scott/the-abbot/17/ | accessdate = 2011-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Carlyle | first1 = Thomas | authorlink1 = Thomas Carlyle | title = Historical Sketches.... | pages = 304–305 | url = https://archive.org/stream/historicalsketc00carlgoog#page/n322/mode/2up | accessdate = 2011-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Chambers (publisher born 1802)|Robert Chambers]] who asserted that the sobriquet could not be traced before the reign of Charles II attributed the name to a Fife laird, Durham of Largo, who regulated the bedtime of his children by the smoke rising above Edinburgh from the fires of the tenements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Grant | first1 = James | title = Old and New Edinburgh | url = http://www.oldandnewedinburgh.co.uk/volume5/page133.html | accessdate = 2011-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Chambers | first1 = Robert | authorlink1 = Robert Chambers (publisher born 1802) | title = Traditions of Edinburgh | page = 168 | url = https://archive.org/stream/traditionsofedin00cham#page/168/mode/2up | accessdate = 2011-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.infoplease.com/dictionary/brewers/reekie.html | title = Reekie | accessdate = 2011-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Athens of the North===
Some have called Edinburgh the ''Athens of the North'' for a variety of reasons. The earliest comparison between the two cities showed that they had a similar topography, with the Castle Rock of Edinburgh performing a similar role to the [[Athens|Athenian]] [[Acropolis, Athens|Acropolis]]. Both of them had flatter, fertile agricultural land sloping down to a [[port]] several miles away (respectively [[Leith]] and [[Piraeus]]). Although this arrangement is common in [[Southern Europe]], it is rare in [[Northern Europe]]. The 18th century intellectual life, referred to as the [[Scottish Enlightenment]], was a key influence in gaining the name. Such beacons as [[David Hume]] and [[Adam Smith]] shone during this period. Having lost most of its political importance after the [[Treaty of Union 1707|Union]], some hoped that Edinburgh could gain a similar influence on London as Athens had on Rome. Also a contributing factor was the later [[Neoclassicism|neoclassical]] architecture, particularly that of [[William Henry Playfair]], and the [[National Monument, Edinburgh|National Monument]]. [[Tom Stoppard]]'s character Archie, of [[Jumpers]], said, perhaps playing on [[Reykjavík]] meaning "smoky bay", that the "Reykjavík of the South" would be more appropriate.&lt;ref&gt;Stoppard, Tom. ''Jumpers'', Grove Press, 1972, p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dunedin===
Edinburgh has also been known as ''Dunedin'', deriving from the [[Scottish Gaelic]], ''Dùn Èideann''. [[Dunedin]], New Zealand, was originally called "New Edinburgh" and is still nicknamed the "Edinburgh of the South".

===Other nicknames===
The Scots poets [[Robert Burns]] and [[Robert Fergusson]] sometimes used the Latin form of the city's name, ''Edina'', in their work. [[Ben Jonson]] described it as ''Britaine's other eye'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://cco.cambridge.org/extract?id=ccol0521641136_CCOL0521641136A003 | title = The Cambridge Companion to Ben Jonson | accessdate = 2010-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Sir Walter Scott]] referred to the city as ''yon Empress of the North''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.hn.psu.edu/faculty/jmanis/w-scott/marmion.pdf Marmion A Tale of Flodden Field by Walter Scott]. Retrieved 17 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other variants include Embra, or Embro&lt;ref&gt;"For Embro' wells are grutten dry" Elegy On the Year 1788, Robert Burns&lt;/ref&gt; (contracted forms), and Edinburrie.

Within Scotland itself, Edinburgh is also sometimes referred to just as "the Capital".

'''Forsån''' ([[Swedish language|Swedish]]: "Rapids' Stream") is a [[stream]] in southern [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]].  It is also known as '''Stortorpsån''' and '''Forsen'''.

Leaving lake [[Magelungen]] calmly by a small sandy beach, Forsån's upper reach passes through a furrow blown in the 1860s to lower the level of the lake resulting in the present wide torrents passing through the bedrock.  In contrast, the last 500 metres of the course are characterized by flat shores and stagnant, overgrown waters.  The stream has a vigorous population of [[signal crayfish]] and is the only winter habitat in Stockholm for [[white-throated dipper]].&lt;ref name="Forsan"&gt;Forsån&lt;/ref&gt;

== Catchment area ==
Approximately half of the catchment area is occupied by contaminated ground and polluting operations in the [[Larsboda]] industrial area; with the remaining area composed of parks and green spaces. One of the minor [[allotment (gardening)|allotment-garden]]'s is located in an area which is crossed by two major traffic routes and a railway.&lt;ref name="vattenprogram-30.2"&gt;Vattenprogram, p 30.2&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Environmental influence ===
The inflow from Magelungen brings approximately 2 [[Metric ton|tons]] of [[phosphorus]] and 30 tons of [[nitrogen]] to Forsån, the contribution from the catchment area itself, 10&amp;nbsp;kg and 40&amp;nbsp;kg respectively, is insignificant in comparison.  No estimates of the level of metals brought to the stream has been done, but low or moderate levels of common metals were reported in river sediments in 1997. Although very high levels of [[lead]] next to the road Magelungsvägen were reported.&lt;ref name="vattenprogram-30.2" /&gt;

== Fauna ==
Samples of bottom fauna taken in 1998 documented the presence of nationally rare species of [[Gastropoda|gastropods]] such as ''[[Hippeutis complanatus]]'' and bivalve [[swan mussel]]; and during the preceding decades two species of [[Limnetic zone|limnetic]] gastropods were documented. Larvae of [[white-legged damselfly]] and [[blue-tailed damselfly]] were recorded in summer 2000.  [[Signal crayfish]] and [[trout]] have been introduced in the stream, of which the former succeeded in establishing while [[Rutilus|roach]] is believed to be unfavourable to the latter.  The [[white water]] rapids make a section of the stream ice-free during the winter time which attracts [[white-throated dipper]]s and [[common kingfisher]]s.  In 1996, traces of [[beaver]] were reported.&lt;ref name="vattenprogram-30.3"&gt;Vattenprogram, p 30.3&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5120">'''Geographic information science''' or '''geographical information science''' ('''GIScience''') is the scientific discipline that studies data structures and computational techniques to capture, represent, process, and analyze [[geographic information]]. It can be contrasted with [[geographic information systems]] (GIS), which are software tools.
British geographer [[Michael Frank Goodchild|Michael Goodchild]] defined this area in the 1990s and summarized its core interests, including spatial analysis, visualization, and the representation of uncertainty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Twenty years of progress: GIScience in 2010 {{!}} Goodchild {{!}} Journal of Spatial Information Science|url = http://www.josis.org/index.php/josis/article/viewArticle/32|website = www.josis.org|accessdate = 2015-09-18|doi = 10.5311/JOSIS.2010.1.32|doi-broken-date = 2018-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  GIScience is conceptually related to [[geography]], [[information science]], [[computer science]], [[geomatics]] and [[geoinformatics]], but it claims the status of an independent scientific discipline.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Foundations of Geographic Information Science|url = https://books.google.com/?id=_0sDF-0vT0wC&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=Foundations+of+Geographic+Information+Science#v=onepage&amp;q=Foundations%2520of%2520Geographic%2520Information%2520Science&amp;f=false|publisher = CRC Press|date = 2004-11-23|isbn = 9780203009543|language = en|first = Matt|last = Duckham|first2 = Michael F.|last2 = Goodchild|first3 = Michael|last3 = Worboys}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definitions ==
{{Expand section|date=September 2015}}
Since its inception in the 1990s, the boundaries between GIScience and cognate disciplines are contested, and different communities might disagree on what GIScience is and what it studies. In particular, Goodchild stated that "information science can be defined as the systematic study according to scientific principles of the nature and properties of information. Geographic information science is the subset of information science that is about geographic information."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Geographical information science|last = Goodchild|first = Michael|journal = International Journal of Geographical Information Systems|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |year = 1992|volume = 6|issue = 1|pages = 31–45}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another influential definition is that by GIScientist [[David Mark (scientist)|David Mark]], which states:&lt;blockquote&gt;Geographic Information Science (GIScience) is the basic research field that seeks to redefine geographic concepts and their use in the context of geographic information systems. GIScience also examines the impacts of GIS on individuals and society, and the influences of society on GIS. GIScience re-examines some of the most fundamental themes in traditional spatially oriented fields such as geography, cartography, and geodesy, while incorporating more recent developments in cognitive and information science. It also overlaps with and draws from more specialized research fields such as computer science, statistics, mathematics, and psychology, and contributes to progress in those fields. It supports research in political science and anthropology, and draws on those fields in studies of geographic information and society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Foundations of Geographic Information Science|url = https://books.google.com/?id=_0sDF-0vT0wC&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=Foundations+of+Geographic+Information+Science#v=onepage&amp;q=Foundations%2520of%2520Geographic%2520Information%2520Science&amp;f=false|publisher = CRC Press|date = 2004-11-23|isbn = 9780203009543|language = en|first = Matt|last = Duckham|first2 = Michael F.|last2 = Goodchild|first3 = Michael|last3 = Worboys|pages = 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2006">'''Geosophy''' is a concept introduced to [[geography]] by [[John Kirtland Wright|J.K. Wright]] in 1947. The word is a compound of ‘geo’ (Greek for earth) and ‘sophia’ (Greek for wisdom). Wright defined it thus:

:Geosophy ... is the study of geographical knowledge from any or all points of view. It is to geography what historiography is to history; it deals with the nature and expression of geographical knowledge both past and present&amp;mdash;with what Whittlesey has called ‘man’s sense of [terrestrial] space’. Thus it extends far beyond the core area of scientific geographical knowledge or of geographical knowledge as otherwise systematized by geographers. Taking into account the whole peripheral realm, it covers the geographical ideas, both true and false, of all manner of people&amp;mdash;not only geographers, but farmers and fishermen, business executives and poets, novelists and painters, Bedouins and Hottentots&amp;mdash;and for this reason it necessarily has to do in large degree with subjective conceptions.

:(Wright 1947)

This has been summarised as:

:the study of the world as people conceive of and imagine it

:(McGreevy 1987)

Belief systems as they relate to human interaction with the Earth's environments.

: (attributed to Professor Innes Park 1995)

==Superstition==
'''Geosophy''' is sometimes used as a synonym for the study of [[earth mysteries]].

'''Geotargeting''' in [[geomarketing]] and [[internet marketing]] is the method of determining the [[geolocation]] of a website visitor and delivering different [[Web content|content]] to that visitor based on their location. This includes country, region/state, city, metro code/[[zip code]], organization, [[IP address]], [[ISP]] or other criteria.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Freedman, Mythili Vutukuru, Nick Feamster and Hari Balakrishnan, Geographic Locality of IP Prefixes, Internet Measurement Conference (IMC), 2005&lt;/ref&gt; A common usage of geo targeting is found in [[online advertising]], as well as [[internet television]] with sites such as [[iPlayer]] and [[Hulu]]. In these circumstances, content is often restricted to users geolocated in specific countries; this approach serves as a means of implementing [[digital rights management]]. Use of [[proxy server]]s and [[virtual private network]]s may give a false location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/16/technology/internet/16privacy.html?ref=technology | title=Many See Privacy on Web as Big Issue, Survey Says | work=Nytimes.com | date=March 15, 2009 | accessdate=12 February 2014 | author=STEPHANIE CLIFFORD}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geographical information provided by the visitor==
In geotargeting with [[geolocation software]], the [[geolocation]] is based on geographical and other personal information that is provided by the visitor or others.

===Different content by choice===
Typical examples for different content by choice in geotargeting are the [[FedEx]] and [[United Parcel Service|UPS]] websites where users have the choice to select their country location first and are then presented with different site or article content depending on their selection.

===Automated different content===
In internet marketing and geomarketing, the delivery of different content based on the geographical [[geolocation]] and other personal information is automated.&lt;ref name=automated&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703294904575385532109190198?mod=googlenews_wsj Wall Street Journal, “On the Web's Cutting Edge, Anonymity in Name Only”, August 4, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; A good example is the Ace Hardware website at www.acehardware.com. The company utilizes geolocation software to power the “My Local Ace” section of its website. Based on a site visitor’s location, the website's [[online locator service]] can show the visitor how many stores are in their area, as well as a city-level locator map to help the customer find the store closest to their address.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gsicommerce.com/assets/docs/pdf/generic/CSA-AceHardware-Nov08.pdf Chain Store Age, “Making it Personal”, November, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

==IP spidering==
The automated discovery of user person/organisation/city-level geolocation information based on [[IP address]]es by [[traceroute]], [[Ping (networking utility)|ping]]s, and a combination of other tools and methods is far more advanced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adexchanger.com/online-advertising/digital-element-rob-friedman-ip-targeting/|title=Digital Element Finding Demand for Granular IP targeting|accessdate=2010-04-28|date=2009-08-20}} Discussing automated spidering technology&lt;/ref&gt;

It is dependent on the pre-analysis of the entire IP address space. There are more than 4 billion possible IP addresses, and detailed analysis of each of them is a Herculean task, especially in light of the fact that IP addresses are constantly being assigned, allocated, reallocated, moved and changed due to routers being moved,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/02/22/google-says-ip-addresses-arent-personal/?_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;ref=technology&amp;_r=0 | title=Google Says I.P. Addresses Aren’t Personal | work=Nytimes.com | date=February 22, 2008 | accessdate=12 February 2014 | author=SAUL HANSELL}}&lt;/ref&gt; enterprises being assigned IP addresses or moving, and networks being built or changed. In order to keep up with these changes, complex algorithms, bandwidth measurement and mapping technology, and finely tuned delivery mechanisms are necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/03/technology/personaltech/how-to-muddy-your-tracks-on-the-internet.html | title=How to Muddy Your Tracks on the Internet | work=Nytimes.com | date=May 2, 2012 | accessdate=12 February 2014 | author=KATE MURPHY}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once all of the IP space is analyzed, each address must be periodically updated to reflect changes in the IP address information, without invading a user's privacy. This process is similar in scale to the task of [[Web crawler|Web spidering]].

==IP delivery in SEO==
{{main|Cloaking}}
IP delivery for [[search engine optimization]] (SEO) is the method of delivering different content to search engine spiders (also known as robots and crawlers) than to human visitors. The determination if the visitor is a known search engine spider is done based on the IP address. SEOs compare the visitor's IP address with their list of IP addresses, which are known to be servers that are owned by a search engine and used to run their crawler applications (spiders). The delivery of different content to search engine spiders than to human visitors is called [[cloaking]] and is against most search engines' webmaster guidelines.&lt;ref name=gguide&gt;[http://www.google.com/support/webmasters/bin/answer.py?answer=35769 Google webmaster guidelines]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=yguide&gt;[http://help.yahoo.com/help/us/ysearch/indexing/indexing-14.html Yahoo! search content quality guidelines]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=msguide&gt;[http://search.msn.com/docs/siteowner.aspx?t=SEARCH_WEBMASTER_REF_GuidelinesforOptimizingSite.htm MS Search guidelines for successful indexing] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060819035446/http://search.msn.com/docs/siteowner.aspx?t=SEARCH_WEBMASTER_REF_GuidelinesforOptimizingSite.htm |date=2006-08-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the search engine guidelines seem to imply that any type of cloaking is bad, there are cases where cloaking might be legitimate. The subject is very controversial and SEO experts continue to debate about when cloaking might be acceptable and when not.&lt;ref&gt;Chris Sherman (July 18, 2001), [http://searchenginewatch.com/showPage.html?page=2157341 Search Engine Cloaking: The Controversy Continues] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071113063408/http://searchenginewatch.com/showPage.html?page=2157341 |date=2007-11-13 }}, ''Search Engine Watch'', retrieved on December 9, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

"Cloaking" via IP delivery works differently from cloaking via "[[user agent]]". While [[IP address spoofing]] is harder than [[User agent#User agent spoofing|user-agent spoofing]] and more reliable, it is also harder to keep the list of IP addresses used by search engines for their crawlers up-to-date. An outdated list with active crawler IP addresses missing enables the search engines to detect the cloaking and may result in a removal of the site from the search engine's index.

==Southbank competition==
Beulah International conducted a contest to determine the architect for the project, and dubbed the competition "Southbank by Beulah". All six solicited bids involved two architectural firms, and partnerships included [[Bjarke Ingels|BIG Architects]] and [[Fender Katsalidis]], [[MAD Studio]] and [[Elenberg Fraser]], and [[Woods Bagot]] and [[Winy Maas|MVRDV]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dezeen.com/2018/07/27/big-mad-mvrdv-oma-unstudio-and-coop-himmelblau-shortlisted-melbourne-skyscraper/|title=BIG, MAD, MVRDV and OMA on shortlist to design Australia's tallest building|last=Block|first=India|date=27 July 2018|publisher=DeZeen|accessdate=11 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The collaborative bid by [[UNStudio]] and [[Philip Cox|Cox Architecture]] ultimately secured the commission.

[[Image:Hungary geo deaf.jpg|right|thumb|360px|Hungary within the Carpathian basin]]

The '''hydrology of Hungary''' is mostly determined by [[Hungary]]'s lying in the middle of the [[Carpathian Basin]], half surrounded by the [[Carpathian Mountains]]. All parts of the country have some outflow. All surface water gravitates towards its southern centre, and from there, is united in the [[Danube]], which flows into the [[Black Sea]]. The whole of Hungary lies within the Danube [[drainage basin]].

The total length of all the irrigation systems and inland waterways in the country is about {{convert|26000|km|abbr=on}}.

The annual water balance of the country shows a surplus. Yearly about {{convert|100|km3|cuft|abbr=on}} of water leaves the country towards the Black Sea. From that, [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] amounts for only 10%, the rest being provided by the incoming rivers of surrounding countries.

==Rivers==
{{See also|List of rivers of Hungary}}

Hydrographically Hungary can be divided into two roughly equal parts: the [[drainage basin]]s of the Danube and the [[Tisza]].

The present network of Hungary's rivers began to take shape at the end of the [[Tertiary]] and the beginning of the [[Quaternary]] periods when the [[Pannonian Sea]] retreated from the basin.

The rivers in Hungary reach their lowest level at the end of the summer, the beginning of the autumn, or sometimes in the winter.

Both the Danube and the Tisza have two regular floods each year, the early spring "icy flood" and the early summer "green flood". The "icy flood" is the result of the [[thaw (weather)|thaw]] in the mountains surrounding the Carpathian Basin, when the rivers in the plain are usually still frozen. Before the river flows were controlled, the piled-up ice sheets of the river could form tremendous barriers, which in turn could cause devastating floods. This phenomenon can still be a real danger after cold winters, and a small fleet of [[icebreaker]]s is used on the two rivers to fight against ice barrages. The "green" flood in the early summer carries a much larger amount of water, not only the torrents from the [[Alps]], but also the [[surface runoff]] water from the May and June rains.

===Danube===
{{main article|Danube}}
The Danube runs through several countries, and in Hungary is known as the {{lang-hu|Duna}}.

====History====
The primaeval Danube first silted up the basin of the Pannonian Sea which now forms the [[Eastern Slovak Lowland]] on the left bank of the river and the [[Little Hungarian Plain]] on the right bank. It flowed towards the south into [[Transdanubia]] and then followed the present-day course of the [[Drava]] into an interior lake system in the south of the present [[Great Plain]]. Later the Danube was diverted to the east by [[tectonic uplift]], finding an outlet through the [[Visegrád]] gap. During the [[Quaternary]] the Great Plain continued to sink, meanwhile the [[Börzsöny]] and the [[Visegrád]] mountains were rising. The result was the [[Canyon|gorge]], or a {{convert|200|to|300|m|-1|adj=on}} deep [[fluvial terrace|terraced]] valley cut through the mountains by the Danube at what is now the [[Danube Bend]] at Visegrád, between [[Esztergom]] and [[Vác]]. Once through the gorge, the Danube fanned out into the [[Great Hungarian Plain]], depositing [[alluvium|alluvial cones]]. The present north-south course was formed by the river in the late [[Pleistocene]].

====Geography====
The Danube is the second longest river in Europe, after the [[Volga]]. Its upper flow is outside of Hungary, but its middle section starts at [[Devín]], close to the Hungarian border. This section of the river stretches until the [[Iron Gate (Danube)|Iron Gate]], between [[Serbia]] and [[Romania]]. The lower section of the river crosses the [[Romanian Plain]] and flows into the [[Black Sea]] through a [[River delta|delta]]. The Hungarian section of the river is {{convert|417|km|abbr=on}} long, from which {{convert|140|km|abbr=on}} forms the border between Hungary and [[Slovakia]], from [[Rusovce]] to the mouth of the [[Ipeľ]] ({{lang|hu|Ipoly}}).

====Navigation====
The Danube is navigable for the whole of its course through Hungary with a minimum {{convert|2|m|ft|adj=on}} depth.

====Flow and flooding====
The Danube has been mostly controlled since the 19th century. There is about {{convert|1250|km2|abbr=on}} of flood-protected area along the banks of the Danube in Hungary, with about {{convert|1123000|km3|abbr=on}} of dykes. No stretch of land along the river is left open to the floods.

The Danube has a rate of flow of {{convert|10000|m3/s|cuft/s|abbr=on}} at its fastest, and {{convert|600|m3/s|cuft/s|abbr=on}} at its slowest, in the region of Budapest. The difference between water levels can be as high as {{convert|6|to|8|m|abbr=on}}. The present flood prevention possibilities are enough to cope with rises up to about {{convert|10|m|0}} above the low-water mark, but there are from time to time very dangerous floods.

====Tributaries====
The right-hand tributaries of the Danube inside Hungary do not add greatly to its volume. The largest are the [[Lajta]], the [[Rába]], the [[Rábca]] and the [[Marcal]]. The [[Sárvíz (Sió)|Sárvíz]] is joined by the [[Sió]] which drains Lake Balaton. The Sió is also fed by the river [[Kapos (river)|Kapos]].

The only right-hand tributary of any considerable volume is the [[Drava]], which forms also on a large stretch the Hungarian-[[Croatia]]n border, but joins the Danube already inside Croatia.

===Tisza===
{{main article|Tisza}}

====History====
The present course of the [[Tisza]] was established relatively recently in geological time. Until the end of the [[Pleistocene]] it flowed along the southern border of the [[Nyírség]] area in north-eastern Hungary, but later it changed its flow forming a right-angled bend to the north of the Nyírség. The Tisza and its tributaries built up very large, but flat alluvial cones along the edges of the Great Plain.

====Geography====
The [[drainage basin]] of the Tisza is in the eastern part of the Carpathian Basin. {{convert|45000|km2|abbr=on}} of this is in Hungary, mostly lowland. Before its control in the 19th century its full length was {{convert|1419|km|abbr=on}}, of which {{convert|955|km|abbr=on}} were within the present boundaries of Hungary. Its control shortened these lengths to {{convert|977|km|abbr=on}} and {{convert|579|km|abbr=on}} respectively. In spite of regulation, the Tisza still has a characteristically wide [[meander]]s through the [[flood plain]] with [[sand dune]]s, wide forests and [[oxbow lake]]s, some cut off artificially, some naturally. In Hungary the Tisza is a sluggish river with a very gentle [[slope|gradient]]. Before it was brought under control it regularly flooded an area of {{convert|2000|km2|abbr=on}}. The volume of water in the Tisza fluctuates even more than that in the Danube because the catchment area is mostly medium-height mountains, and not by high mountains with permanent snow.

====Flow and flooding====
The Tisza has three floods yearly, the early spring flood from the snow thaw, then the early summer "green flood", brought on by the summer rain, and then a minor flood in the autumn. Its lowest level is in winter.

The rate of flow varies at [[Szolnok]] between {{convert|72|m3/s|cuft/s|abbr=on}} and {{convert|3800|m3/s|cuft/s|abbr=on}} Before the extensive controls, when the spring floods of the Danube and the Tisza happened to coincide, the Danube could not absorb the water of the Tisza and the resulting flood could cause immense damage throughout the Great Plain. The length of the Tisza dykes now exceeds {{convert|4000|km|abbr=on}}.

====Navigation====
The Tisza is navigable for smaller vessels right up to [[Dombrád]] near the north-eastern frontier of the country. In the Trans-Tisza Region (east of the river) extensive areas are irrigated by its water.

====Tributaries====
The last and largest tributary of the Tisza within Hungary is the [[Maros]].

Among the tributaries of the Tisza the most important on the right side is the [[Bodrog]], which flows into the Tisza at [[Tokaj]]. Their confluence has often changed, as is graphically illustrated by the extensive oxbow lakes and belts of shallows in the vicinity of Tokaj.

The next right-hand tributary of the Tisza is the [[Hornád]], which receives earlier also the waters of the [[Bódva]] and the [[Sajó]]. Below [[Tiszafüred]] the river takes up the [[Eger river]] and at Szolnok the [[Zagyva]] which already collected the waters of [[Galga]] and [[Tápió]]. To the south from this point no more streams run into the Tisza from the ridge which separates it from the Danube. The eastern slope of this ridge is only broken by dried-out valleys.

The more significant left-hand tributes of the Tisza include the [[Szamos]] with the [[Crasna River (Tisza)|Kraszna]], the [[Körös River|Körös]], which is usually called Treble Körös, because it gathers up the water of several minor rivers, ([[Crişul Alb River|White Körös]], [[Crişul Negru River|Black Körös]], [[Crişul Repede River|Rapid Körös]], [[Berettyó]] and the [[Hortobágy|Hortobágy river]]). Before the great river controls of the 19th century this region was an almost endless stretch of marshlands and [[fen]]s. Today there is a system of irrigation canals in the area.

==Canals==
{{See also|István Türr|Danube-Tisa-Danube Canal}}

''The river is spelt Tisa in other languages. In Hungarian the spelling is Tisza, but it is not assonated.''

In the late 19th century, during the large-scale controls, canal systems were also created partly as artificial waterways, partly to help the agricultural use of land, and partly to conduct away superfluous inland water. The most important canal of [[Transdanubia]] is the {{convert|100|km|1|abbr=on|adj=on}} [[Sió]] connecting Lake Balaton and the Danube. The Hanság Canal goes across a boggy land between the [[Lake Neusiedl|Lake Fertő]] and the Danube. The {{convert|97|km|abbr=on|adj=on}} long Main Eastern Canal, which was only finished after 1945, crosses the drier parts of the [[Great Hungarian Plain]] to the east of the Tisza.

==Lakes==
[[Image:Ancient balaton.jpg|thumb|Lake Balaton in ancient times]]
{{main article|Lake Balaton}}

Hungary is not very rich in lakes, and their basins are no older than the late [[Pleistocene]]. There is no really deep lake in the country. The shallower waters warm up quickly in summer, and water temperatures of {{convert|25|°C|°F}} are quite common, which makes them very pleasant for bathing.

[[Lake Balaton]] is the biggest in Central Europe. It covers {{convert|600|km2|abbr=on}}, being  {{convert|77|km|abbr=on}} long and up to {{convert|15|km|abbr=on}} wide. It lies {{convert|104|m|abbr=on}} above mean sea level and has an average depth of {{convert|3|m|abbr=on}}, with its deepest point being at [[Tihany]], at {{convert|10.8|m|abbr=on}}.

[[Evaporation]] from the lake is greater than the inflow from small rivers and streams. The deficit is compensated by rainwater and underground sources. The occasional surplus water leaves the lake through the canalised Sió.

During the Pleistocene the lake was much larger, and {{convert|20|to|30|m|abbr=on}} deep.

The southern shore of Lake Balaton is extremely shallow, the average depth only beiong reached at a distance of {{convert|500|to|1000|m|abbr=on}} from the shore. There is a {{convert|70|km|abbr=on|adj=on}} long [[beach ridge]], covered by sand, on the southern shore, built up by the waves underneath the dominant north-westerly wind.

The northern shore is more varied, with the [[Tihany]] Peninsula, and it has steeper beach shelves.

At the lake the summertime is long, beginning in May and lingering to the end of September. The air temperature may be in the region of {{convert|30|°C|°F|abbr=on}} to {{convert|35|°C|°F|abbr=on}}, the water temperature {{convert|24|°C|°F|abbr=on}} to {{convert|30|°C|°F|abbr=on}}. The water temperature does not sink below {{convert|17|°C|°F|abbr=on}} to {{convert|18|°C|°F|abbr=on}}in the summer even if there is a [[cold front]]. This enormous body of water creates a very pleasant [[mesoclimate]] on the shores of the lake.

Sudden storms can whip up dangerous, steep waves on the surface of the lake. Their average height is {{convert|1|m|ft}}, and their average length is {{convert|7|m|ft}}. A prevailing north-easterly or south-westerly wind can push the water from the eastern basin of the lake (to the east of the Tihany Peninsula) into the western basin or on the contrary, resulting in water levels differing by {{convert|0.4|to|0.6|m|ft}} from normal, which creates strong currents.

The lake freezes almost every winter, the thickness of the ice can reach {{convert|0.4|m|ft}}, which creates good opportunities for sport.

[[File:Neusiedler Lake satellite.png|thumb|left|120px|Neusiedler/Fertő Lake - satellite image]]
The second largest lake of Hungary is Lake Fertő ({{lang|de|[[Lake Neusiedl|Neusiedl]]}}) on the border with [[Austria]]. Its water level and shore line have been changed over time very widely. The lake is very shallow, with an average water level of {{convert|1.5|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The greater part of its surface is covered with reeds, huge quantities of which are used industrially. A quarter of the lake's area of {{convert|335|km2|abbr=on}} lies in Hungary, with the other three-quarters in Austria. The adjacent marshy [[Hanság]] was drained by the Hanság Canal.

The third largest lake in Hungary, [[Lake Velence]] is a [[steppe lake]] in an advanced stage of [[alluviation]]. Its surface area is {{convert|26|km2|abbr=on}}, but only {{convert|16|km2|abbr=on}} is open water, the rest being covered by reeds. It is a popular holiday resort, being close to  [[Budapest]].

==Swamps and marshes==
The [[Little Balaton]] was originally a part of the larger lake, but now it is mostly a swamp and marsh area at the south-western corner of the Balaton with a highly characteristic wildlife. It is a protected natural reserve.

Before the extensive controls of the 19th century there were a lot of marshes and swamps in the country like the Sárrét of Transdanubia or the [[Nagyecsed|Ecsed]] Moorland close to the north-eastern corner of the country. They have been drained, reclaimed and transformed into land fit for farming.

Spring-water lakes are a special class of natural lakes in Hungary. They are fed mostly by [[warm spring]]s, but [[karst topography|karstic]] ones also occur ([[Lake Hévíz]], the [[Malom Pool]] in Budapest, [[Tapolca]]). The alkaline [[Lake Fehér (Szeged)|Lake Fehér]] near [[Szeged]] has no outlet. It is a famous nature reserve in [[Körös-Maros National Park]].

==Underground water==
[[Image:Artesian Well.png|thumb|right|240px|Scheme of geological strata in a basin with an Artesian well.]]

Underground water is very important in Hungary, especially on the Great Plain. [[Stratum]] water is abundant because Hungary is in the middle of the Carpathian Basin. These water resources are between two impermeable strata underlying the first [[impervious]] stratum beneath the underground water. They are predominantly of rainfall origin, mostly not from Hungary, but from the surrounding higher-lying parts of the Carpathian Basin. This water, when brought to the surface from great depths, is rich in various mineral solutions and may be very hot.

Deep [[boring (earth)|boring]] for stratum water has been carried out throughout the country. There are about twenty-eight thousand [[artesian well]]s in the Great Plain alone, out of a total of thirty-five thousand for the whole country. Their depth varies from {{convert|100|to|2500|m|ft|abbr=on}}. In the hilly and mountainous regions of [[Mesozoic]] [[limestone]], [[karst topography|karstic]] water is also important.

== Budapest dam ==
It is understood that a large earth dam was built upstream of Budapest, downstream of Vienna in the latter part of the 20th century, amassing a considerable quantity of water into an artificial lake, and should this earth bank break, similarly to what happened at Kolontaar, 2010, and Vajont 1963 Budapest would be flooded uncontrollably. It is a matter of historical record that the building of this Danube Dam was banned in the Diplomatic District of London in advance by a march and a Note Verbale handed in to the Austrian Embassy, and colour photographs being taken of the principal participants in the action. What is this?

'''Jacques Bacot''' (4 July 1877 &amp;ndash; 25 June 1965) was an explorer and pioneering [[France|French]] Tibetologist. He travelled extensively in [[India]], western [[China]], and the [[Tibet]]an border regions. He worked at the [[École pratique des hautes études]]. Bacot was the first western scholar to study the Tibetan grammatical tradition, and along with [[F. W. Thomas]] (1867–1956) belonged to the first generation of scholars to study the Old Tibetan [[Dunhuang]] manuscripts. Bacot made frequent use of Tibetan informants. He acquired aid from [[Gendün Chöphel]] in studying Dunhuang manuscripts.

== Biography ==
The Tibetological career of Jacques Bacot began from a round the world trip which he made in 1904 and from an expedition to [[Tibet]] in 1906, starting from [[Tonkin]], in the course of which he followed a pilgrimage route which must have put him in intimate contact with the religious life of Tibet. After his return to France in 1908, he devouted himself to the study of Tibetan with [[Sylvain Lévi]].

Jacques Bacot explored various Asian countries:
* The valley of the [[Yangtze River]] (1907) ;
* The north of [[Indochina]] (1909–1910) ;
* The [[Himalayas]] (1913–1914 and 1930–1931)
and travelled extensively in India, in the east of China, and the border regions of Tibet.

Jacques Bacot was named director of studies (directeur d'études) of Tibetan at l'[[École pratique des hautes études]] in 1936. He became a member of l'[[Académie des inscriptions et belles-lettres]] in 1947, and entered the [[Société Asiatique]] in 1908. He became president after the death of [[Paul Pelliot]], in 1945, and remained so until 1954.

The paintings and bronzes which he acquired in his various expeditions are now held at the [[Guimet Museum]] in [[Paris]], which he donated to in 1912. His library and papers were also donated to the museum after his death.

'''Jingū Seamount''', also called '''Jingū Guyot''', is a [[guyot]] of the [[Hawaiian-Emperor seamount chain]] in the [[Pacific Ocean]]. It erupted 55 million years ago. The seamount is elongated in structure, running North-South, and has an oval shaped crater in the center, which is evidence of collapse when above sea level.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.volcanolive.com/jingu.html Jingu Seamount - John Search]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=deepsea_v55c40 /&gt;

The seamount was named in 1954 by [[Robert S.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13914">'''Kavirondo''' is the former name of the region surrounding Kavirondo Gulf (now [[Winam Gulf]]) as well as of two native peoples living there under the regime of [[British East Africa]] (The "[[Nilotic Kavirondo]]" and the "[[Bantu Kavirondo]]"). Broadly, this was defined as those who dwelt in the valley of the [[Nzoia River]], on the western slopes of [[Mount Elgon]], and along the northeast coast of [[Victoria Nyanza]].

Suggested etiologies of the name "Kavirondo" include
* From local young warriors, armed with spears, bows, arrows, &amp; clubs, who were observed to sit on their heels, which in [[Swahili language|Swahili]] is ''kaa virondo''. Thus the region became Kavirondo, the inhabitants pejoratively called ''wa-Kavirondo'': “people who sit on their heels”
* From ''kaba-londo'': In [[Buganda]] two unusual words related to royalty were combined, [[Kabaka of Buganda|kabaka]], the king &amp; ''namu-londo'', the [[chair|stool]] used as [[throne]] on which the king is crowned.
(Both putative origins may be doubtful).

==Origins and divisions==
Kavirondo is the general name of two distinct groups of ethnic groups, the [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] speakers and the [[Nilotic]] speakers. The [[Bantu people|Bantu]] appear to have been the first comers. The Nilotic ethnic groups, probably an offshoot of the [[Acholi]], appear to have crossed [[Lake Victoria]] to reach their present home, the country around Kavirondo Gulf. Of the two, the Bantu now occupy a more northerly position than their neighbors, and are practically the most northerly representatives of that race (Hobley). The Nilotic Kavirondo in their turn had their wanderings arrested by an irruption of [[Elgumi]] people (themselves probably of Nilotic origin) from the east.

The Bantu Kavirondo are divided into three principal types: the Awa-Rimi, the Awa-Ware and the Awa-Kisii. Their Nilotic neighbors call the Bantu Kavirondo ''Jo-Mwa''  (singular: Ja-Mwa). The generic name for the Nilotic tribes is ''Jo-Luo''  (singular: Ja-Luo), but the Bantu Kavirondo call them ''Awa-Nyoro''. The two groups have many characteristics in common.

The Kavirondo have many tribes, divided, Sir H. H. Johnston suspects, totemically.

==Culture and society==
[[File:In wildest Africa - the record of a hunting and exploration trip through Uganda, Victoria Nyanza, the Kilimanjaro region and British East Africa, with an account of an ascent of the snowfields of (14596313249).jpg|thumb|right|250px|Bantu Kavirondo women working a field, early 20th century.]]
A characteristic feature of the people was their traditional [[nakedness]]. Among the Nilotic Kavirondo married men who are fathers wore a small piece of goat-skin (Sembe), which though practically useless as a covering was worn according to ethnic etiquette. Even among men who have adopted European clothing this goat-skin must still be worn underneath. Contact with whites has led to the adoption of European clothing by numbers of the men (who were better travelled), but the women (who were less travelled), more conservative, remained in nudity or the scanty covering which they wore before the advent of Europeans. Among the Bantu Kavirondo married women wear a short fringe of black string in front and a tassel of banana fibre suspended from a girdle behind, this tassel having at a distance the appearance of a tail. Hence the report of early travellers as to a tailed race in [[Africa]]. The Nilotic Kavirondo women wear the tail, but dispense with the fringe in front. For dandy they wear a goat-skin slung over the shoulders.

Some of the Bantu tribes practise [[circumcision]], the Nilotic tribes do not. Patterns are tattooed on chest and stomach for ornament. Men, even husbands, are forbidden to touch the women's tails, which must be worn even should any other clothing be wrapped round the body.

The Kavirondo are noted for their independent and pugnacious nature, honesty and sexual morality, traits particularly marked among the Bantu tribes. There are more women than men, and thus the Kavirondo are naturally inclined towards [[polygamy]]. Among the Bantu tribes a man has the refusal of all the younger sisters of his wife as they attain puberty. Practically no woman lives unmarried all her life, for if no suitor seeks her, she singles out a man and offers herself to him at a reduced price, an offer usually accepted, as the women are excellent agricultural laborers. The Nilotic Kavirondo incline to [[exogamy]], endeavouring always to marry outside their clan. Girls are betrothed at six or seven, and the husband-elect continually makes small presents to his fatherin-law-elect till the bride reaches womanhood.

It is regarded as shameful if the girl be not found a virgin on her wedding day. She is sent back to her parents, who have to return the marriage price, and pay a fine. The wife's [[adultery]] was formerly punished with death, and the capital penalty was also inflicted on young men and girls guilty of [[unchastity]]. Among the Bantu Kavirondo the usual minimum price for a wife is forty hoes, twenty goats and one cow, paid in instalments. The Nilotic Kavirondo pay twenty sheep and two to six cows; the husband-elect can claim his bride after half payment; if a woman dies without bearing children, the amount of her purchase is returnable by her father, unless the widower consents to replace her by another sister. The women are prolific and the birth of twins is common and considered a lucky event, which is celebrated by feasting and dances.

Among the Bantu Kavirondo the mother of twins must remain in her hut for seven days; among the Nilotic Kavirondo the parents and the infants must stay in the hut for a whole month. If a Bantu mother has lost two children in succession, the next child born is taken out at dawn and placed on the road, where it is left till a neighbor, usually a woman friend who has gone that way on purpose, picks it up and takes it to its mother who gives a goat in return; a somewhat similar custom prevails among the Nilotic tribes. Names are neither masculine nor feminine, and a girl often bears her father's name.

The Kavirondo bury their dead. Among one of the [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] tribes, the Awa-Kisesa, a chief is buried in the floor of his own hut in a sitting position, but at such a depth that the head protrudes. Over the head an earthenware pot is placed, and his principal wives have to remain in the hut till the flesh is eaten by ants or decomposes, when the skull is removed and buried close to the hut. Later the skeleton is unearthed, and reburied with much ceremony in the sacred burial place of the tribe.

Married women of the Bantu tribes are buried in their hut lying on their right side with legs doubled up, the hut being then deserted. Among the Nilotic tribes the grave is dug beneath the verandah of the hut. Men of the Bantu tribes are buried in an open space in the midst of their huts; in the Nilotic tribes, if the first wife of the deceased be alive he is buried in her hut, if not, beneath the verandah of the hut in which he died. A child is buried near the door of its mothers hut. A sign of mourning is a cord of banana fibre worn round the neck and waist.

A chief chooses, sometimes years before his death, one of his sons to succeed him, often giving a brass bracelet as insignia. A man's property is divided equally among his children.

While some tribes live in isolated huts, those in the north have strongly walled villages. The walls are of mud and formerly, among the Nilotic tribes, occasionally of stone. Since colonization by the British the security of the country induced the Kavirondo to let the walls fall into disrepair. Their huts are circular with conical thatched roofs, and fairly broad verandas all round.

A portion of the hut is partitioned off as a sleeping-place for goats, and the fowls sleep indoors in a large basket. Skins form the only bedsteads. In each hut are two fireplaces, about which a rigid etiquette prevails. Strangers or distant relatives are not allowed to pass beyond the first, which is near the door, and is used for cooking. At the second, which is nearly in the middle of the hut, sits the hut owner, his wives, children, brothers and sisters. Around this fireplace the family sleep.

Cooking pots, water pots and earthenware grain jars are the only other furniture. The food is served in small baskets. Every full-grown man has a hut to himself, and one for each wife. The huts of the Masaba Kavirondo of west [[Elgon]] have the apex of the roof surmounted by a carved pole which Sir H. H. Johnston says is obviously a phallus. Among the Bantu Kavirondo a father does not eat with his sons, nor do brothers eat together. Among the Nilotic tribes father and sons eat together, usually in a separate hut with open sides. Women eat apart and only after the men have finished.

Though a peaceful people, the Kavirondo fight well. Their weapons are spears with rather long flat blades without blood-courses and broad-bladed swords. Some use slings, and most carry shields. Bows and arrows are also used; firearms are however displacing other weapons. Kavirondo warfare was mainly defensive and intertribal, this last a form of [[Feud|vendetta]]. When a man had killed his enemy in battle he shaved his head on his return and was rubbed with medicine (generally goats dung), to defend him from the spirit of the dead man. The Awa-Wanga abandoned this custom when they obtained firearms. The young warriors were made to stab the bodies of their slain enemies.

In the colonial era the Kavirondo are on the increase due to their fecundity and morality. Those who live in the low-lying lands suffer from a mild [[malaria]], while abroad they are subject to [[dysentery]] and [[pneumonia]]. Epidemics of [[small-pox]] have occurred. Native medicine is of the simplest. They dress wounds with butter and leaves, and for inflammation of the lungs or pleurisy, pierce a hole in the chest. There are no medicine-men: the women are the doctors. Certain of the incisor teeth are pulled out. If a man retains these he will, it is thought, be killed in warfare. Among certain tribes the women also have incisor teeth extracted, otherwise misfortune would befall their husbands. For the same reason the wife scars the skin of her forehead or stomach. A Kavirondo husband, before starting on a perilous journey, cuts [[scar]]s on his wife's body to ensure him good luck.

Of dances, the Kavirondo have the birth dance, the death dance, that at initiation and one of a propitiatory kind in seasons of drought. Their music is plaintive and sometimes pretty, produced by a large [[lyre]]-shaped instrument. They also use various drums.

The [[Luo (family of ethnic groups)|Luo]] women use small beads attached to pieces of brass for ear ornaments. Like the aggrey beads of [[West Africa]] these beads are not of local manufacture nor of recent introduction. They are ancient, generally blue in color, occasionally yellow or green, and are picked up in certain districts after heavy rain. The natives believe they come down with the rain. They are identical in shape and color to [[Ancient Egyptian]] beads and other beads obtained from trade with peoples from ancient cities in [[Balochistan (Pakistan)|Balochistan]], in modern [[Pakistan]].

==Religion and beliefs==
They appears to practicee a vague ancestor worship, but the northern tribes have two gods, Awafwa and Ishishemi, the spirits of good and evil. To the former, cattle and goats are sacrificed.

The Kavirondo have great faith in [[divination]] from the entrails of a sheep. Nearly everybody and everything are ominous of good or evil to the Kavirondo.

They have few myths or traditions; the [[Aarddvark|antbear]] is the chief figure in their beast-legends.

They believe in [[witchcraft]] and practise [[trial by ordeal]].

==Economy==
The Kavirondo are essentially an agricultural people: both men and women work in the fields with large iron hoes. In addition to [[sorghum]], [[Eleusine]] and maize, tobacco and [[hemp]] are both cultivated and smoked. Both sexes smoke, but the use of hemp is restricted to men and unmarried women, as it is thought to injure child-bearing women. Hemp is smoked in a hubble-bubble. The Kavirondo cultivate [[sesamum]] and make an oil from its seeds which they burn in little clay lamps of the ancient saucer type, the pattern being, in Hobley's opinion, introduced into the country by the coast people.

The Kavirondo keep cattle, sheep, goats, fowls and a few dogs. Women do not eat sheep, fowls or eggs, and are not allowed to drink milk except when mixed with other things. The flesh of the wild cat and leopard is esteemed by most of the tribes. Among the Bantu Kavirondo goats and sheep are suffocated, the snout being held until the animal dies. From Eleusine a beer is made.

The Kavirondo are plucky hunters, capturing the hippopotamus with ropes and traps, and attacking with spears the largest elephants. Fish, of which they are very fond, are caught by line and rod or in traps. Bee-keeping is common, and where trees are scarce the hives are placed on the roof of the hut.

Traditional Kavirondo industries are salt-making, effected by burning reeds and water-plants and passing water through the ashes; the smelting of iron ore (confined to the Bantu tribes); pottery and basket-work.

===Co-chairs as Finland and Namibia===
The [[President of Finland]] [[Tarja Halonen]] and the [[President of Namibia]] [[Sam Nujoma]] co-chaired the Millennium Summit. This was due to the [[President of the United Nations General Assembly|Presidency over the General Assembly]] of [[Theo-Ben Gurirab]] in the [[Fifty-fourth session of the United Nations General Assembly|fifty-fourth session]] and that of [[Harri Holkeri]] in the [[Fifty-fifth session of the United Nations General Assembly|fifty-fifth session]]. Therefore, the [[Head of state|Heads of state]] of Finland and Namibia were chosen to preside over the summit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite speech | title = Statement by H.E. Dr. Sam Nujoma, President of the Republic of Namibia in his capacity as co-chairman of the Millennium Summit on the occasion of the official opening of the Millennium Summit

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea===
[[Kim Yong Nam]], [[Head of state]] of the [[Democratic People's Republic of Korea]], cancelled his visit to the Millennium Summit after an incident at an airport in [[Frankfurt, Germany]]. He and his fellow [[diplomats]] were subjected to inspection by [[American Airlines]] officials. The diplomats claimed [[diplomatic immunity]], which can free them from any law enforcement while visiting other countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=SG/SM/7531 - Secretary-General regrets decision by Democratic People's Republic of Korea not to attend Millennium Summit following airport incident |publisher=[[United Nations]] Office of the Spokesman for the [[United Nations Secretary-General|Secretary-General]] [[Kofi Annan]] |date=2000-09-05 |url=https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2000/20000905.sgsm7531.doc.html |accessdate=2007-02-12 |quote=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first= |last=Garrett |authorlink= |author= |coauthors= |title=North Korea complains of rude treatment, cancels trip to U.N.

===Delegation of Tuvalu===
[[Tuvalu]] was admitted to the United Nations the day before the Millennium Summit began, on September 5, 2000. This country was accepted as the 189th member of the United Nations, signifying Tuvalu's major development since its independence in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.scienceblog.com/community/older/archives/L/2000/B/un001389.html|title= Millennium Assembly elects Harri Holkeri (Finland) President, Admits Tuvalu as 189th United Nations Member State |accessdate=2007-02-16 |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=2000-09-05 |year= |month= |work= |publisher=Science Blog |pages=  |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Indigenous Peoples of Canada}}
This '''list of place names in Canada of Indigenous origin''' contains Canadian places whose names originate from the words of the [[First Nations]], [[Métis people (Canada)|Métis]], or [[Inuit]], collectively referred to as [[Indigenous peoples in Canada|Indigenous peoples]]. When possible the original word or phrase used by Indigenous peoples is included, along with its generally believed meaning. Names listed are only those used in English or French, as many places have alternate names in the local native languages, e.g. [[Alkali Lake, British Columbia]] is ''Esket'' in the [[Shuswap language]]; [[Lytton, British Columbia]] is ''[[Camchin]]'' in the [[Thompson language]] (often used in English however, as Kumsheen).

==Canada==
The name ''Canada'' comes from the word meaning "village" or "settlement" in the [[Laurentian language|Saint-Lawrence Iroquoian]]&lt;ref&gt;Bruce G. Trigger and James F. Pendergast. (1978), "Saint-Lawrence Iroquoians", in ''Handbook of North American Indians''. Volume 15. Washington: Smithsonian Institution, pp. 357–361&lt;/ref&gt; language spoken by the inhabitants of [[Stadacona]] and the neighbouring region near present-day [[Quebec City]] in the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Cartier. (1545).''[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/12356/12356-h/12356-h.htm Relation originale de Jacques Cartier]''. Paris, Tross, 1863 edition, page 48.&lt;/ref&gt; Another contemporary meaning was "land."&lt;ref&gt;Alan Rayburn. (2001). ''Naming Canada: stories about Canadian place names'', 2nd ed. ({{ISBN|0-8020-8293-9}}) University of Toronto Press: Toronto; p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Jacques Cartier was first to use the word "Canada" to refer not only to the village of [[Stadacona]], but also to the neighbouring region and to the Saint-Lawrence River.

In other Iroquoian languages, the words for "town" or "village" are similar: the [[Mohawk language|Mohawk]] use ''kaná:ta’'',&lt;ref&gt;Mithun, Marianne (1999). The Languages of Native North America. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bright (2004:78)&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Seneca language|Seneca]] ''iennekanandaa'', and the [[Onondaga language|Onondaga]] use ''ganataje''.&lt;ref&gt;Rayburn, ''op. cit'', p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Plumpollen0060.jpg|thumb|right|Bee on plum tree with pollen]]

The term '''pollen source''' is often used in the context of [[beekeeping]] and refers to flowering plants as a source of [[pollen]] for bees or other insects. Bees collect pollen as a protein source to raise their brood. For the plant, the [[pollinizer]], this can be an important mechanism for [[sexual reproduction]], as the [[pollinator]] distributes its pollen. Few flowering plants [[self-pollination|self-pollinate]]; some can provide their own pollen (self fertile), but require a pollinator to move the pollen; others are dependent on [[cross pollination]] from a genetically different source of viable pollen, through the activity of pollinators.  One of the possible pollinators to assist in cross-pollination are honeybees. The article below is mainly about the pollen source from a beekeeping perspective.

The pollen source in a given area depends on the type of [[vegetation]] present and the length of their bloom period.  What type of vegetation will grow in an area depends on soil texture, soil pH, soil drainage, daily maximum and minimum temperatures, precipitation, extreme minimum winter temperature, and [[growing degree day]]s.  The plants listed below are plants that would grow in [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]] [http://www.usna.usda.gov/Hardzone/hzm-ne1.html Hardiness zone] 5.  A good predictor for when a plant will bloom and produce [[pollen]] is a calculation of the growing degree days.

The color of pollen below indicates the color as it appears when the pollen arrives at the beehive.  Bees mix dry pollen with [[nectar]] and/or [[honey]] to compact the pollen in the [[pollen basket]].  Dry pollen, is a food source for bees, which contains 16–30% protein, 1–10% fat, 1–7% starch, many vitamins, but little sugar.  The protein source needed for rearing one worker bee from larval to adult stage requires approximately 120 to 145&amp;nbsp;mg of pollen.  An average bee colony will collect about 20 to 57&amp;nbsp;kg (44 to 125 pounds) of pollen a year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nhb.org/download/research/rvalue.pdf THE R-VALUES OF HONEY: POLLEN COEFFICIENT]  accessed Feb 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reiter, R, [https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:9qU5E3Kw1t8J:https://kb.osu.edu/dspace/bitstream/1811/3589/1/V47N04_137.pdf+american+chestnut+%22pollen+color%22&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESj5iTKbUcBsAD3Pm9Iw15GeKuqXHunYqdLK5L4NzdKfYH7yI0PqO52BF_nur775bdQSaQ-DDcOlTBV7D8j2oT608IV_hWWnCy2krfDFea7SJQixr2DpkMb8KaMUdTYztIiwwXqj&amp;sig=AHIEtbQEqaU9wMqN9iyLcVWMGrmNdOakBQ THE COLORATION OF ANTHER AND CORBICULAR POLLEN], THE OHIO JOURNAL OF SCIENCE, VOL.

'''''Los Llanos''''' ({{IPA-es|loz ˈʝanos}}, "The Plains") is a vast [[tropical grassland]] [[plain]] situated to the east of the [[Andes]] in [[Colombia]] and [[Venezuela]], in northwestern South America. It is an [[ecoregion]] of the [[flooded grasslands and savannas]] [[biome]].

The Llanos' main river is the [[Orinoco]], which forms part of the border between Colombia and Venezuela and is the major river system of Venezuela.&lt;ref name="Llanos wetlands during the rainy season"&gt;{{cite book|title=Earth|publisher=Doring Kindersley|year=2003|pages=328|isbn=1-4053-0018-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ecology==
During the rainy season from May to October, parts of the Llanos can flood up to a meter. This turns the [[woodland]]s and [[grassland]] into a temporary [[wetland]], comparable to the [[Pantanal]] of central South America. This flooding also makes the area unique for its wildlife. The area supports around 70 species of [[water bird]]s, including the [[scarlet ibis]].&lt;ref name="Llanos wetlands during the rainy season"/&gt; A large portion of the distribution of the [[white-bearded flycatcher]] is in the Llanos.

The flooding also made the area unfit for most agriculture before the advent of modern, industrial farming technology. Therefore, during the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish colonial era]], the primary economic activity of the area was the herding of millions of heads of cattle. An 1856 watercolor by [[Manuel María Paz]] depicts sparsely populated open grazing lands with cattle and palm trees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''[[llanero]]'' ("plainsman") became synonymous with the cowhands that took care of the herds, and had some cultural similarities with the [[gaucho]]s of the [[Pampas]] or the ''[[Cowboy|vaqueros]]'' of [[Spanish Texas|Spanish]] and [[Mexican Texas]].

== Oil and gas==
In Los Llanos the governments of Venezuela and Colombia had developed a strong oil and gas industry in zones of Arauca, Casanare, Guárico, Anzoátegui, Apure and Monagas. The [[Orinoco Belt]], entirely in Venezuelan territory, consists of large deposits of extra [[heavy crude]] ([[oil sands]]). The Orinoco belt oil sands are known to be one of the largest, behind that of the [[Athabasca Oil Sands]] in [[Alberta]], Canada. Venezuela's non-conventional oil deposits of about {{convert|1200|Goilbbl|m3}}, found primarily in the Orinoco oil sands, are estimated to approximately equal the world's reserves of conventional oil.

'''Mbeli Bai''' is a 13 hectare swampy forest clearing in the [[Nouabalé-Ndoki National Park]] in the [[Republic of Congo]] with minimum levels of disturbance, where "bai’s" like this are believed to offer important nutritional benefits to many species.

Since the end of the 1990s the [[Wildlife Conservation Society]] has worked in the north of the Republic of Congo and in 1993 together with the Ministry of Forest Economy and Environment has created the Nouabalé-Ndoki National Park (4,200&amp;nbsp;km²). The Nouabalé-Ndoki National Park with its low levels of disturbance represents one of the last remaining intact forest blocs (no history of logging) in the Congo Basin and an important stronghold for [[western gorilla]]s, [[forest elephant]]s and other endangered forest mammals.

Researchers have been continuously monitoring the mammals visiting Mbeli Bai since February 1995 with the aim to increase our understanding of the biology of western gorillas and other large mammals that are otherwise difficult to study in the dense rain forest. Since 1995 more than 330 gorillas have been monitored (actual population ~130 gorillas) spanning more than 1750 gorilla years of around 55 gorilla units (groups and solitary silverbacks). The result of this monitoring of individual identifiable animals has provided major and unique insights into the social organization and behavior of this elusive species including many spectacular behavioral observations such as twin births, silverback splash displays and the first observation of tool use in free-ranging gorillas&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Parnell | first1 = R.

'''''Mesa''''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] for ''[[table (furniture)|table]]'') is the [[American English]] term for [[Table (landform)|tableland]], an elevated area of land with a flat top and sides that are usually steep [[cliff]]s. It takes its name from its characteristic table-top shape. It may also be called a [[Table (landform)|table hill]], table-topped hill or table mountain. It is larger than a [[butte]], which it otherwise resembles closely.

It is a characteristic [[landform]] of arid environments, particularly the [[Western United States|Western]] and [[Southwestern United States]] in [[badlands]] and mountainous regions ranging from [[Washington (state)|Washington]] and [[California]] to the [[Dakotas]], [[Wyoming]], [[Utah]], [[Oklahoma]], and [[Texas]]. Examples are also found in many other nations including [[Spain]], [[Sardinia]], North and [[South Africa]], [[Arabia]], [[India]], and [[Australia]].

[[Grand Mesa]] is a large mesa located in western [[Colorado]] in the Southwest United States. Cerro Negro is a mesa in [[Argentina]].

== Formation ==
[[File:HarQatum.jpg|thumb|right|Har Qatum, a mesa located on the southern edge of [[Makhtesh Ramon]], [[Israel]]]]

Mesas form by [[weathering]] and [[erosion]] of horizontally layered rocks that have been uplifted by [[tectonics|tectonic]] activity.  Variations in the ability of different types of rock to resist weathering and [[erosion]] cause the weaker types of rocks to be eroded away, leaving the more resistant types of rocks topographically higher than their surroundings.&lt;ref name="Easterbrook"&gt;{{cite book |last= Easterbrook |first= Don J. |title= Surface Processes and Landforms |year= 1999 |publisher= [[Prentice Hall]] |location= Upper Saddle River, NJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process is called differential erosion. The most resistant rock types include [[sandstone]], [[conglomerate (geology)|conglomerate]], [[quartzite]], [[basalt]], [[chert]], [[limestone]], [[lava|lava flows]] and [[sill (geology)|sills]].&lt;ref name="Easterbrook"/&gt; Lava flows and sills, in particular, are very resistant to weathering and erosion, and often form the flat top, or [[caprock]], of a mesa. The less resistant rock layers are mainly made up of [[shale]], a softer rock that weathers and erodes more easily.&lt;ref name="Easterbrook"/&gt;

The differences in strength of various rock layers is what gives mesas their distinctive shape. Less resistant rocks are eroded away on the surface into valleys, where they collect water drainage from the surrounding area, while the more resistant layers are left standing out.&lt;ref name="Easterbrook"/&gt; A large area of very resistant rock, such as a [[sill (geology)|sill]] may shield the layers below it from erosion while the softer rock surrounding it is eroded into valleys, thus forming a caprock.

Differences in rock type also reflect on the sides of a mesa, as instead of smooth slopes, the sides are broken into a staircase pattern called "cliff-and-bench topography".&lt;ref name="Easterbrook"/&gt; The more resistant layers form the cliffs, or stairsteps, while the less resistant layers form gentle slopes, or benches, between the cliffs. Cliffs retreat and are eventually cut off from the main cliff, or [[plateau]], by basal sapping. When the cliff edge does not retreat uniformly, but instead is indented by [[headward erosion|headward eroding]] streams, a section can be cut off from the main cliff, forming a mesa.&lt;ref name="Easterbrook"/&gt;

Basal sapping occurs as water flowing around the rock layers of the mesa erodes the underlying soft shale layers, either as [[surface runoff]] from the mesa top or from [[groundwater]] moving through permeable overlying layers, which leads to [[Slump (geology)|slump]]ing and flowage of the shale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Choreley |first= Richard J. |author2=Stanley A. Schumm |author3=David E. Sugden|author-link3=David E. Sugden  |title= Geomorphology |year= 1985 |publisher= Methuen |location= New York }}&lt;/ref&gt; As the underlying shale erodes away, it can no longer support the overlying cliff layers, which collapse and retreat. When the caprock has caved away to the point where only a little remains, it is known as a [[butte]].

== On Mars ==
[[File:PIA21585 - A Mesa in Noctis Labyrinthus.jpg|thumb|A mesa in [[Noctis Labyrinthus]] on [[Mars]], viewed by [[HiRISE]].]]
A transitional zone on [[Mars]], known as the ''fretted terrain'', lies between highly cratered highlands and less cratered lowlands. The younger lowland exhibits steep walled mesas and [[Mountain|knobs]]. The mesa and knobs are separated by flat lying lowlands. They are thought to form from ice-facilitated mass wasting processes from ground or atmospheric sources. The mesas and knobs decrease in size with increasing distance from the highland escarpment. The relief of the mesas range from nearly 2&amp;nbsp;km to 100m depending on the distance they are from the escarpment.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, David M.

'''Outflow channels''' are extremely long, wide swathes of scoured ground on [[Mars]], commonly containing the streamlined remnants of pre-existing topography and other linear erosive features indicating sculpting by fluids moving downslope.&lt;ref&gt;Carr, M.H. (2006), ''The Surface of Mars''. Cambridge Planetary Science Series, Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Channels extend many hundreds of kilometers in length and are typically greater than one kilometer in width; the largest valley ([[Kasei Vallis]]) is around {{convert|3500|km|mi|abbr=on}} long, greater than {{convert|400|km|mi|abbr=on}} wide and exceeds {{convert|2.5|km|mi|abbr=on}} in depth cut into the surrounding plains. These features tend to appear fully sized at fractures in the Martian surface, either from [[chaos terrain]]s or from canyon systems or other tectonically controlled, deep [[graben]], though there are exceptions. Besides their exceptional size, the channels are also characterized by low [[sinuosity|sinuosities]] and high width:depth ratios compared both to other Martian valley features and to terrestrial river channels. [[Crater counting|Crater counts]] indicate that most of the channels were cut since the early [[Hesperian]],&lt;ref&gt;Hartmann, W.K., and Neukum, G. (2001). "Cratering chronology and the evolution of Mars". In: ''Chronology and Evolution of Mars'', ed. R. Kallenbach et al. Dordrecht: Kluwer, p. 165-94.&lt;/ref&gt; though the age of the features is variable between different regions of Mars. Some outflow channels in the [[Amazonis Planitia|Amazonis]] and [[Elysium Planitia]]e regions have yielded ages of only tens of million years, extremely young by the standards of Martian topographic features.&lt;ref&gt;Burr, D.M., McEwan, A.S., and Sakimoto, S.E. (2002). "Recent aqueous floods from the Cerberus Fossae", ''Mars. Geophys. Res. Lett.'', 29(1), 10.1029/2001G1013345.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the basis of their geomorphology, locations and sources, the channels are today generally thought to have been carved by [[outburst flood]]s (huge, rare, episodic floods of liquid [[water on Mars|water]]),&lt;ref&gt;Baker, V.R. (1982). ''The Channels of Mars''. Austin: Texas University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carr,M.H. (1979). "Formation of Martian flood features by release of water from confined aquifers". ''J. Geophys. Res.'', 84, 2995-3007.&lt;/ref&gt; although some authors still make the case for formation by the action of [[glacier]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Luchitta, B.K. (2001). "Antarctic ice streams and outflow channels on Mars". ''Geophys. Res. Lett.'', 28, 403-6.&lt;/ref&gt; [[lava]],&lt;ref&gt;Leverington, D.W. (2004). "Volcanic rilles, streamlined islands, and the origin of outflow channels on Mars", ''Geophys. Res.'', 109(E11), {{doi|10.1020/2004JE002311}}.&lt;/ref&gt; or [[debris flows]].&lt;ref&gt;Tanaka, K.L. (1999). "Debris flow origin for the Simud/Tiu deposit on Mars". ''J. Geophys. Res.'', 104, 8637-52.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman, N. (2000). White Mars. Icarus, 146, 326-42.&lt;/ref&gt; Calculations&lt;ref&gt;Williams, R.M., Phillips, R.J., and Malin, M.C. (2000). "Flow rates and duration within Kasei Vallis, Mars: Implications for the formation of a Martian ocean". ''Geophys. Res. Lett.'', 27, 1073-6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, M.S., and Takana, K.L. (1990), "Magnitude of a catastrophic flood event in Kasei Vallis, Mars". ''Geology'', 18, 902-5.&lt;/ref&gt; indicate that the volumes of water required to cut such channels at least equal and most likely exceed by several orders of magnitude the present discharges of the largest terrestrial rivers, and are probably comparable to the largest floods known to have ever occurred on Earth (e.g., those that cut the [[Channeled Scablands]] in North America or those released during the re-flooding of the Mediterranean basin at the end of the [[Messinian Salinity Crisis]]).&lt;ref&gt;Baker, V.R.

"Catastrophic flood of the Mediterranean after the Messinian Salinity Crisis". ''Nature'', 462, 778-782.&lt;/ref&gt; Such exceptional flow rates and the implied associated volumes of water released could not be sourced by precipitation but rather demand the release of water from some long-term store, probably a subsurface aquifer sealed by ice and subsequently breached by [[meteorite impact]] or [[igneous activity]].&lt;ref&gt;Carr,M.H. (1979). "Formation of Martian flood features by release of water from confined aquifers". ''J. Geophys. Res.'', 84, 2995-3007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The outflow channels contrast with the Martian channel features known as "[[Valley networks (Mars)|valley networks]]", which much more closely resemble the dendritic planform more typical of terrestrial river [[drainage basin]]s.

Outflow channels tend to be named after the names for Mars in various ancient world languages, or more rarely for major terrestrial rivers.&lt;ref&gt;Carr, M.H. (2006), ''The Surface of Mars''. Cambridge Planetary Science Series, Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The term outflow channels was introduced in planetology in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vanderbilt.edu/AnS/physics/astrocourses/AST101/readings/mars_water.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==List of outflow channels by region==
This is a partial list of named channel structures on Mars claimed as outflow channels in the literature, largely following ''The Surface of Mars'' by Carr. The channels tend to cluster in certain regions on the Martian surface, often associated with volcanic provinces, and the list reflects this. Originating structures at the head of the channels, if clear and named, are noted in parentheses and in italics after each entry.

===Circum-Chryse region===
[[Chryse Planitia]] is a roughly circular volcanic plain west of the [[Tharsis]] bulge and its associated volcanic systems. This region contains the most prominent and numerous outflow channels on Mars. The channels flow east or north into the plain.

* [[Ares Vallis]] (''[[Aram Chaos]]''; ''[[Iani Chaos]]'')
* [[Kasei Vallis]] (''[[Echus Chasma]]'')
* [[Maja Valles]] (''[[Juventae Chasma]]'')
* [[Mawrth Vallis]] (''no obvious source'')
* [[Ravi Vallis]] (''Aromatum Chaos'')
* [[Shalbatana Vallis]] (''chaos in [[Orson Welles (crater)|Orson Welles]] crater''; ''[[Ganges Chasma]]''?)
* [[Simud Valles]] (''[[Hydraotes Chaos]]''; ''[[Aureum Chaos]]''?; ''Arsinoes Chaos''?)
* [[Tiu Valles]] (''[[Aram Chaos]]''?; ''Aureum Chaos''?)

===Tharsis region===
In this region it is particularly difficult to distinguish outflow channels from lava channels but the following features have been suggested as at least overprinted by outflow channel floods:

* Parts of the [[Olympica Fossae]]
* Valleys adjacent to the southeast margin of [[Olympus Mons]] (''nameless graben'')

===Amazonis and Elysium Planitiae===
Several channels flow either onto the plains of [[Amazonis Planitia|Amazonis]] and [[Elysium Planitia|Elysium]] from the [[Geology of Mars#Hemispheric dichotomy|southern highlands]], or originate at graben within the plains. This region contains some of the youngest channels.&lt;ref&gt;Burr, D.M., McEwan, A.S., and Sakimoto, S.E. (2002). "Recent aqueous floods from the Cerberus Fossae, Mars". ''Geophys. Res. Lett.'', 29(1), 10.1029/2001G1013345.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these channels have rare tributaries, and they do not start at a chaos region. It has been suggested the formation mechanisms for these channels may be more variable than for those around Chryse Planitia, perhaps in some cases involving lake breaches at the surface.&lt;ref&gt;Irwin, R.P., Maxwell, T.A., Craddock, R.A., and Leverington, D.W. (2002). "A large paleolake basin at the head of Ma'adim Vallis, Mars". ''Science'', 296, 2209-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

* Al-Qahira Vallis
* [[Athabasca Vallis]] (''[[Cerberus Fossae]]'')
* Grjota Vallis (''nameless graben'')
* [[Ma'adim Vallis]] (''shallow depression in Highlands'')
* [[Mangala Valles]] (''Mangala Fossa'')
* [[Marte Vallis]] (''Cerberus Planitia'')

===Utopia Planitia===
Several outflow channels rise in the region west of the [[Elysium Mons|Elysium]] volcanic province and flow northwestward to the [[Utopia Planitia]]. As common in the Amazonis and Elysium Planitiae regions, these channels tend to originate in graben. Some of these channels may be influenced by [[lahars]], as indicated by their surface textures and ridged, lobate deposits at their margins and termini.&lt;ref&gt;Christiansen, E.H. (1989). "Lahars in the Elysium region of Mars". ''Geology'', 17, 203-6.&lt;/ref&gt; The valleys of Hephaestus Fossae and Hebrus Valles are of extremely unusual form, and although sometimes claimed as outflow channels, are of enigmatic origin.&lt;ref&gt;Carr, M.H. (2006), ''The Surface of Mars''. Cambridge Planetary Science Series, Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Granicus Vallis]] (''graben radial to [[Elysium Mons]]'')
* [[Hrad Valles]] (''graben radial to Elysium Mons'')
* [[Tinjar Vallis]] (''graben radial to Elysium Mons'')
* [[Hebrus Valles]] (''irregular depression; ends in discontinuous linear hollows'')
* [[Hephaestus Fossae]] (''irregular depression; flows through angular segments; ends in discontinuous linear hollows'')

===Hellas region===
Three valleys flow from east of its rim down onto the floor of the [[Hellas Planitia|Hellas]] basin.

* [[Dao Vallis]] (''[[box canyon]] near Hadriaca Patera'')
* [[Harmakhis Vallis]] (''close to end of [[Reull Vallis]]'')
* [[Niger Vallis]] (''indistinct depressions near Hadriaca Patera'')

===Argyre region===
It has been argued that [[Uzboi Vallis|Uzboi]], [[Ladon Valles|Ladon]], Margaritifer and [[Ares Vallis|Ares]] Valles, although now separated by large craters, once comprised a single outflow channel flowing north into [[Chryse Planitia]].&lt;ref&gt;Parker, T.J., Clifford, S.m., and Banerdt, W.B. (2000). "Argyre Planitia and the Mars global hydrologic cycle". ''LPSC'' XXXI, Abstract 2033.&lt;/ref&gt; The source of this outflow has been suggested as overflow from the [[Argyre Planitia|Argyre]] crater, formerly filled to the brim as a [[lake]] by channels (Surius, Dzigai, and Palacopus Valles) draining down from the south pole. If real, the full length of this drainage system would be over 8000&amp;nbsp;km, the longest known drainage path in the solar system. Under this suggestion, the extant form of the outflow channel Ares Vallis would thus be a remolding of a pre-existing structure.

===Polar regions===
The large troughs present in each pole, [[Chasma Boreale]] and [[Chasma Australe]], have both been argued to have been formed by meltwater release from beneath polar ice, as in a terrestrial [[jökulhlaup]].&lt;ref&gt;Clifford, S.M. (1987). "Basal polar melting on Mars". ''J. Geophys. Res.'', 92, 9135-52.&lt;/ref&gt; However, others have argued for an [[Aeolian processes|eolian]] origin, with them induced by [[katabatic winds]] blowing down from the poles.&lt;ref&gt;Howard, A.D. (2000). "The role of aeolian processes in forming surface features of the martian polar layered deposits". ''Icarus'', 144, 267-88.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kachch.png|thumb|right|280px|Rann of Kutch in the state of [[Gujarat]]]]
{{Distinguish|Great Rann of Kutch|Little Rann of Kutch}}
The '''Rann of Kutch''' is a large area of [[salt marsh]]es located mostly in [[Gujarat]] (primarily the [[Kutch district]]), [[India]] and the southern tip of [[Sindh]], [[Pakistan]]. It is divided into two main parts: [[Great Rann of Kutch]] and [[Little Rann of Kutch]].

==Geography==
The Rann of Kutch is located in the [[Thar Desert]] bio-geographic area in the Indian state of Gujarat, with some parts in Pakistani province of Sindh. It is a seasonally marshy region, the word ''Rann'' meaning "salt marsh", alternating with ''medaks'', elevated pieces of land where vegetation grows. [[Kori Creek]] and [[Sir creek]] are located in  Rann of Kutch area which is part of [[Indus River Delta|Indus river delta]].

[[Kutch district|Kutch]] is the name of the district in Gujarat where this region is situated. The [[marsh]] covers a huge area of around 10,000 square miles and is positioned between the [[Gulf of Kutch]] and the mouth of the [[Indus River]] in southern Pakistan. Many rivers located in [[Rajasthan]] and Gujarat flow in to Rann of Kutch. These are   [[Luni River|Luni]], [[Bhukhi River|Bhuki]], [[Bhurud River|Bharud]], [[Nara River (India)|Nara]], [[Kharod River|Kharod]], [[West Banas River|Banas]], [[Saraswati River, Gujarat|Sarswati]], [[Rupen River|Rupen]], Bambhan, [[Machchhu River|Machchhu]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rivers of Gujarat in Kutch region|url=https://guj-nwrws.gujarat.gov.in/showpage.aspx?contentid=1465&amp;lang=English|publisher=guj-nwrws.gujarat.gov.in, [[Government of Gujarat]]|accessdate=13 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ecological importance==
[[File:Nilgai group at Little Rann of kutch.JPG|thumb|left|260px|[[Nilgai]] group at the Little Rann of Kutch]]
The Rann of Kutch is the only large [[flooded grasslands]] zone in the whole Indo-Malayan region.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wwf.panda.org/about_our_earth/ecoregions/rannofkutch_flooded_grasslands.cfm WWF - Rann of Kutch Flooded Grasslands] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140722083636/http://wwf.panda.org/about_our_earth/ecoregions/rannofkutch_flooded_grasslands.cfm |date=2014-07-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The fact that the area has desert on one side and the sea on the other provides the Rann of Kutch with a variety of ecosystems, including [[mangroves]] and [[desert vegetation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Negi|first=Sharad Singh|title=Biosphere reserves in India: landuse, biodiversity and conservation|year=1996|publisher=Indus Publishing|isbn=9788173870439|pages=221}}&lt;/ref&gt; The grassland and deserts of the Rann of Kutch are home to forms of wildlife that have adapted to the often harsh conditions of this vast area. These include [[endemic]] and [[endangered]] animal and plant species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sharma|first=R.P.|title=The Indian forester, Volume 127, Issues 7-12|year=10 Nov 2011|publisher=University of Minnesota|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o-csAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=Great+Rann+of+Kutch&amp;dq=Great+Rann+of+Kutch&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=zV5oT9GjFI-JrAf76Zj4Bw&amp;redir_esc=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

(Blue: Portuguese routes, operational from 1498 to 1640)]] 
The '''Spanish treasure fleet''', or '''West Indies Fleet''' from Spanish ''Flota de Indias'', also called silver fleet or plate fleet (from the Spanish ''plata'' meaning "silver"), was a [[convoy]] system adopted by the [[Spanish Empire]] from 1566 to 1790, linking [[Spain]] with its [[Spanish Empire|territories]] in [[America]] across the [[Atlantic]]. The convoys were general purpose cargo fleets used for transporting a wide variety of items, including agricultural goods, [[lumber]], various metal resources, luxuries, [[silver]], [[gold]], [[Gemstone|gem]]s, [[pearl]]s, [[spice]]s, [[sugar]], [[tobacco]], [[silk]], and other exotic goods from the [[Spanish Empire]] to the [[Peninsular Spain|Spanish mainland]]. Passengers and goods such as textiles, books and tools were transported in the opposite direction.&lt;ref&gt;Marx, Robert: ''Treasure lost at sea: diving to the world's great shipwrecks.'' Firefly Books, 2004, page 66. {{ISBN|1-55297-872-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marx, Robert: ''The treasure fleets of the Spanish Main.'' World Pub. Co., 1968&lt;/ref&gt; The West Indies fleet was the first permanent transatlantic trade route in history. Similarly, the [[Manila galleons]] were the first permanent trade route across the Pacific.

==History==
[[File:Pedro menendez de Aviles.jpg|thumb|left|170px|[[Pedro Menéndez de Avilés]], admiral and designer of the treasure fleet system]] 
Spanish ships had brought goods from the [[New World]] since [[Christopher Columbus]]'s first expedition of 1492. The organized system of convoys dates from 1564, but Spain sought to protect shipping prior to that by organizing protection around the largest Caribbean island, [[Cuba]] and the maritime region of southern Spain and the [[Canary Islands]] because of attacks by pirates and foreign navies.&lt;ref&gt;John R. Fisher, "Fleet System (Flota)" in ''Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture'', vol. 2, p. 575.&lt;/ref&gt; The Spanish government created a system of convoys in the 1560s in response to the sacking of [[Havana]] by French [[privateer]]s. The main procedures were established after the recommendations of [[Pedro Menéndez de Avilés]], an experienced admiral and personal adviser of King [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Walton, pp. 46-47&lt;/ref&gt; The treasure fleets sailed along two sea lanes. The main one was the [[Caribbean]] [[Spanish West Indies]] fleet or ''Flota de Indias'', which departed in two convoys from [[Seville]], where the ''[[Casa de Contratación]]'' was based, bound for ports such as [[Veracruz (city)|Veracruz]], [[Portobelo]] and [[Cartagena, Colombia|Cartagena]] before making a rendezvous at [[Havana]] in order to return together to Spain.&lt;ref&gt;Nolan, Cathal: ''The age of wars of religion, 1000-1650: an encyclopedia of global warfare and civilization.'' [[Greenwood Publishing Group]], 2006, page 177. {{ISBN|0-313-33733-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; A secondary route was that of the [[Manila Galleon]]s or ''Galeón de Manila'' which linked the [[Philippines]] to [[Acapulco]] in [[Mexico]] across the [[Pacific Ocean]].  From Acapulco, the Asian goods were [[transhipped]] by [[mule|mule train]] to [[Veracruz (city)|Veracruz]] to be loaded onto the Caribbean treasure fleet for shipment to Spain.&lt;ref&gt;Borrell, Miranda: ''The grandeur of Viceregal Mexico: treasures from the Museo Franz Mayer.'' [[University of Texas Press]], 2002, page 23. {{ISBN|0-89090-107-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; To better defend this trade, Pedro Menéndez de Avilés and [[Álvaro de Bazán, 1st Marquis of Santa Cruz|Álvaro de Bazán]] designed the definitive model of the [[galleon]] in the 1550s.&lt;ref&gt;Walton, p. 57&lt;/ref&gt;

Spain controlled the trade through the ''Casa de Contratación'' based in [[Seville]], southern Spain. By law, the colonies could trade only with the one designated port in the mother country, Seville.&lt;ref&gt;Walton, page 30&lt;/ref&gt; [[Maritime archaeology]] has shown that the quantity of goods transported was sometimes higher than that recorded at the ''[[Archivo General de Indias]]''. Spanish merchants and Spaniards acting as fronts (''cargadores'') for foreign merchants sent their goods on these fleets to the New World. Some resorted to [[contraband]] to transport their cargoes untaxed.&lt;ref&gt;Carrasco González, María Guadalupe: ''Comerciantes y casas de negocios en Cádiz, 1650-1700.'' Servicio Publicaciones UCA, 1997, pp. 27-30. {{ISBN|84-7786-463-2}} {{es}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Crown of Spain]] taxed the wares and precious metals of private merchants at a rate of 20%, a tax known as the ''[[quinto real]]'' or royal fifth.&lt;ref&gt;Walton, page 226&lt;/ref&gt;

Spain became the richest country in Europe by the end of the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;Danbom, David B.: ''Born in the country: a history of rural America.'' [[Johns Hopkins University Press]], 2006, page 20. {{ISBN|0-8018-8458-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the wealth from this trade was used by the Spanish [[Habsburg]]s to finance armies to protect its European territories in the 16th and 17th centuries against the [[Ottoman Empire]] and most of the major European powers.

The flow of precious metals also made many traders wealthy, both in Spain and abroad. The increase in gold and silver on the Iberian market sometimes caused high [[price revolution|inflation in the 17th century]], affecting the Spanish economy.&lt;ref&gt;Walton, pp. 84-85&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence, the Crown was forced to delay the payment of some major debts, which had negative consequences for its lenders, mostly foreign bankers. By 1690 some of these lenders could no longer offer financial support to the Crown.&lt;ref&gt;Walton, page 145&lt;/ref&gt; The Spanish [[monopoly]] over its West and East Indies colonies lasted for over two centuries.

The economic importance of exports later declined with the drop of production of the American precious metal mines, such as [[Potosí#History|Potosí]].&lt;ref&gt;Walton, page 136&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the growth in trade was strong in the early years. Numbering just 17 ships in 1550, the fleets expanded to more than 50 much larger vessels by the end of the century. By the second half of the 17th century, that number had dwindled to less than half of its peak.&lt;ref&gt;Walton, page 138&lt;/ref&gt; As economic conditions gradually recovered from the last decades of the 17th century, fleet operations slowly expanded again, once again becoming prominent during the reign of the [[Bourbons]] in the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;Walton, page 177&lt;/ref&gt;

The Spanish trade of goods was sometimes threatened by its colonial rivals, who tried to seize islands as bases along the [[Spanish Main]] and in the [[Spanish West Indies]]. However, the Atlantic trade was largely unharmed. The English acquired small islands like [[Saint Kitts and Nevis|St Kitts]] in 1624; expelled in 1629, they returned in 1639 and seized [[Jamaica]] in 1655. French pirates established themselves in [[Saint-Domingue]] in 1625, were expelled, only to return later, and the Dutch occupied [[Curaçao]] in 1634. In 1739, British Admiral [[Edward Vernon]] raided Portobello, but in 1741 his campaign [[Battle of Cartagena de Indias|against Cartagena de Indias]] ended in defeat, with heavy losses of men and ships. Temporary British seizures of [[Havana]] and [[Manila]] (1762-4), during the [[Seven Years' War]], were dealt with by using more, smaller fleets visiting a greater variety of ports.

[[Charles III of Spain|Charles III]] began loosening the system in 1765.  In the 1780s, Spain opened its colonies to free trade.&lt;ref&gt;Buckle, Thomas: ''History of civilization in England.'' Parker, Son, and Bourn, 1861, v. 2, pp. 93-94&lt;/ref&gt; In 1790, the ''Casa de Contratación'' was abolished, bringing to an end the great general purpose fleets. Thereafter small groups of naval frigates were assigned specifically to transferring goods or [[bullion]] as required.&lt;ref&gt;Walton, page 180&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the general perception that many Spanish galleons were captured by foreign [[privateers]], few fleets were actually lost to enemies in the course of the ''flota's'' two and a half centuries of operation. Only [[Piet Hein (Netherlands)|Piet Hein]] managed to [[Battle in the Bay of Matanzas|capture the fleet]] in 1628 and bring its cargo to the [[Dutch Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;Walton, page 121&lt;/ref&gt; In 1656 and 1657 [[Robert Blake (admiral)|Robert Blake]] also [[Battle of Cádiz (1656)|attacked the fleet in Cadiz]] and [[Battle of Santa Cruz de Tenerife (1657)|Tenerife]], but the Spanish officers saved most of the silver and the English admiral managed to capture only a single galleon.&lt;ref&gt;Walton, page 129&lt;/ref&gt; The 1702 West Indies fleet was destroyed in the [[Battle of Vigo Bay]] during the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], when the fleet was surprised at port unloading its goods, but the Spanish sailors had already unloaded most of its cargo.&lt;ref&gt;Walton, pp. 154-155&lt;/ref&gt; None of these attacks took place in open seas. In the case of the Manila galleons, only four were ever captured by British warships in nearly three centuries: the ''Santa Anna'' by [[Thomas Cavendish]] in 1589, the ''Encarnación'' in 1709 by [[Woodes Rogers]], the ''Covadonga'' by [[George Anson, 1st Baron Anson|George Anson]] in 1743, and the ''[[Spanish ship Santísima Trinidad (1751)|Santísima Trinidad]]'' in 1762. Two other British attempts were foiled by the ''Rosario'' in 1704 and the ''Begonia'' in 1710.&lt;ref&gt;[http://historicaltextarchive.com/sections.php?op=viewarticle&amp;artid=525 Murray]&lt;/ref&gt; These losses and those due to hurricanes were important economic blows to trade when they occurred. The fleets, however, must be counted as among the most successful naval operations in history.&lt;ref&gt;Walton, page 189&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Konstam, Angus and Cordingly, Daviv (2002).''The History of Pirates''. The Lyons Press, p. 68. {{ISBN|1-58574-516-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, from a commercial point of view, some key components of today's world economic system were made possible by the success of the Spanish West and East Indies fleets.&lt;ref&gt;Walton, page 191&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spain-Americas Fleets===
[[File:Amaro Pargo.jpg|thumb|The Spaniard [[Amaro Pargo]], a corsair and merchant, participated in the West Indies Fleet.]]
Every year, two fleets left Spain loaded with European goods in demand in Spanish America, which were guarded by military vessels. The silver from [[New Spain|Mexico]] and [[Peru]] were the valuable cargo from the Americas. Fleets of fifty or more ships sailed from Spain to the Mexican port of Veracruz and other to Panama and Cartagena.&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Gibson (historian)|Gibson, Charles]]. ''Spain in America''. New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1966, p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt; From the Spanish ports of Seville or [[Cádiz]], the two fleets bound for the Americas sailed together down the coast of Africa, and stopped at the Spanish territory of the [[Canary Islands]] for provisions before the voyage across the Atlantic. Once the two fleets reached the Caribbean, the fleets separated. The [[New Spain]] fleet sailed to [[Veracruz (city)|Veracruz]] in Mexico to load not only silver and the valuable red dye [[cochineal]], but also porcelain and silk shipped from China on the [[Manila galleon]]s. The Asian goods were brought overland from [[Acapulco]] to Veracruz by mule train. The ''[[Province of Tierra Firme|Tierra Firme]]'' fleet, or [[galeon]]es, sailed to [[Cartagena, Colombia|Cartagena]] to load South American products, most especially silver from [[Potosí]]. Some ships went to [[Portobelo, Colón|Portobello]] on the Caribbean coast of Panama to load [[Peru]]vian silver that had been shipped from the Pacific coast port of [[Callao]]. The silver had then been transported across the isthmus of Panama by mule. Other ships went to the Caribbean [[island of Margarita]], off the coast of [[Venezuela]], to collect [[pearl]]s which had been harvested from offshore oyster beds. After loading was complete, both fleets sailed for [[Havana]], Cuba, to rendezvous for the journey back to Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 1733 Spanish Galleon Trail - Plate Fleets|url = http://info.flheritage.com/galleon-trail/plateFleets.cfm|website = info.flheritage.com|accessdate = 2015-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Mexico in 1635, there was an increase of the [[alcabala|sales tax]] levied to finance the fleet, the Armada de Barlovento.&lt;ref&gt;John Jay TePaske, "Alcabalas" in ''Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture'' vol. 1, p. 44. New York: Charles Scribner’s Sons 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Between 1703-1705 began the participation of Spanish corsair [[Amaro Pargo]] in the West Indies Fleet. In this period in which he was the owner and captain of the frigate ''El Ave María y Las Ánimas'', a ship with which he sailed from the [[port of Santa Cruz de Tenerife]] to that of [[Havana]]. He reinvented the benefits of the Canarian-American trade in his estates, mainly destined to the cultivation of the vine of malvasía and vidueño, whose production (mainly the one of vidueño) was sent to [[America]].&lt;ref name="DocsAmaro"&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Archivo Histórico Provincial de Santa Cruz de Tenerife| isbn = 978-84-7947-637-3| last1 = De Paz Sánchez| first1 = Manuel| last2 = García Pulido| first2 = Daniel| others = Francisco Javier Macías Martín (ed.)| title = El corsario de Dios.

===Shipwrecks===
[[Shipwreck|Wrecks]] of Spanish treasure ships, whether sunk in [[Naval tactics in the Age of Sail|naval combat]] or by storms (those of 1622, [[1715 Treasure Fleet|1715]], 1733 and 1750&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 1733 Spanish Galleon Trail - Fleet of 1733|url = http://info.flheritage.com/galleon-trail/fleetOf1733.cfm|website = info.flheritage.com|accessdate = 2015-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; being among the worst), are a prime target for modern [[treasure hunting|treasure hunters]].  Many, such as the ''[[Nuestra Señora de Atocha]]'', and the ''[[Santa Margarita (shipwreck)|Santa Margarita]]'' have been [[Marine salvage|salvaged]].&lt;ref&gt;Walton, pp. 216-217&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1750, at least three Spanish merchantmen ran aground in [[North Carolina]] during a hurricane. The ''[[El Salvador (ship)|El Salvador]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=El Salvador|url=http://www.lat3440.com/index.php/el-sal|website=Intersal, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; sank near [[Cape Lookout (North Carolina)|Cape Lookout]], the ''Nuestra Señora De Soledad'' went ashore near present-day [[Core Banks, North Carolina|Core Banks]] and the ''Nuestra Señora De Guadalupe'' went ashore near present-day [[Ocracoke, North Carolina|Ocracoke]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://northcarolinashipwrecks.blogspot.com/2012/05/dangerous-shoals.html|title=North Carolina Shipwrecks: The Spanish Galleons ~ 18 August 1750|first=Judi|last=Heit|date=6 January 2012|website=northcarolinashipwrecks.blogspot.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Encarnación====
The wreck of the cargo ship ''[[Spanish ship Nuestra Señora de Encarnación|Encarnación]]'', part of the [[Spanish ship Nuestra Señora de Encarnación#The 1681-82 Tierra Firme Fleet and Sinking|Tierra Firme]] fleet, was discovered in 2011 with much of its cargo still aboard and part of its hull intact. The ''Encarnación'' sank in 1681 during a storm near the mouth of the [[Chagres River]] on the Caribbean side of Panama. The ''Encarnación'' sank in less than 40 feet of water.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Rare Spanish Shipwreck From 17th Century Uncovered Off Panama|url = http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2015/05/150512-shipwreck-panama-spain-merchant-ship-encarnacion-ocean-archaeology|website = National Geographic News|accessdate = 2015-05-13|first = Jane J.|last = Lee|first2 = National Geographic PUBLISHED May|last2 = 12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The remains of the ''[[Urca de Lima]]'' from the [[1715 Treasure Fleet|1715 fleet]] and the ''[[San Pedro Underwater Archaeological Preserve State Park|San Pedro]]'' from the [[List of the 1733 Spanish Plate Fleet Shipwrecks|1733 fleet]], after being found by treasure hunters, are now protected as [[Florida Underwater Archaeological Preserves]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Spanish Treasure Fleets of 1715 and 1733: Disasters Strike at Sea|url=http://www.nps.gov/nr/twhp/wwwlps/lessons/129shipwrecks/|website=nps.org|accessdate=15 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Capitana====
The ''Capitana'' (El Rubi) was the [[flagship]] of the 1733 fleet; it ran aground during a hurricane near [[Upper Matecumbe Key]], then sank. Three men died during the storm. Afterward, divers recovered most of the treasure aboard.

The ''Capitana'' was the first of the 1733 ships to be found again in 1938. Salvage workers recovered items from the sunken ship over more than 10 years. Additional gold was recovered in June 2015. The ship's location: is 24° 55.491' north, 80° 30.891' west.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 1733 Spanish Galleon Trail - Capitana|url = http://info.flheritage.com/galleon-trail/ShipwreckPages/10_Capitana.cfm|website = info.flheritage.com|accessdate = 2015-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 300-Year-Old Spanish Shipwreck Holds Million Dollar Treasure|url = http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2015/07/150728-gold-coin-treasure-spanish-shipwreck-florida-ocean-archaeology|website = National Geographic News|accessdate = 2015-07-30|first = Jane J.|last = Lee|first2 = National Geographic PUBLISHED July|last2 = 28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Shipwrecked Spanish Gold Found|url = http://time.com/3974273/spanish-treasure-florida-capitana-1715-treasure-fleet/|website = TIME.com|accessdate = 2015-07-30|first = Joanna|last = Plucinska|date=2015-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The flow of Spanish treasure==
[[File:17th Century Spanish Treasure Silver 8 Reales Cob Coin.jpg|thumb|left|A silver 8-Reales (Peso) coin minted in México (1621-65).]]Walton&lt;ref&gt;Timothy R Walton,"The Spanish Tresure Fleets",1994&lt;/ref&gt; gives the following figures in pesos. For the 300-year period the [[peso]] or [[piece of eight]] had about 25 grams of silver, about the same as the German [[thaler]], [[Dutch rijksdaalder]] or the US [[Dollar coin (United States)|silver dollar]]. A single galleon might carry 2 million pesos.  The modern approximate value of the estimated 4 billion pesos produced during the period would come to $527,270,000,000 or €469,839,661,964 (based on silver bullion prices of May 2015). Of the 4 billion pesos produced, 2.5 billion was shipped to Europe, of which 500 million was shipped around Africa to Asia. Of the remaining 1.5 billion 650 million went directly to Asia from Acapulco and 850 million remained in the Western Hemisphere. Little of the wealth stayed in Spain. Of the 11 million arriving in 1590, 2 million went to France for imports, 6 million to Italy for imports and military expenses, of which 2.5 went up the [[Spanish road]] to the [[Low Countries]] and 1 million to the [[Ottoman Empire]]. 1.5 million was shipped from Portugal to Asia. Of the 2 million pesos reaching the Dutch Republic in that year, 75% went to the Baltic for naval stores and 25% went to Asia. The income of the Spanish crown from all sources was about 2.5 million pesos in 1550, 14 million in the 1590s, about 15 million in 1760 and 30 million in 1780.  In 1665 the debts of the Spanish crown were 30 million pesos short-term and 300 million long-term. Most of the New World production was silver but [[Colombia]] produced mostly gold. After about 1730 [[Brazil]] began producing gold. The following table gives the estimated legal production and necessarily excludes smuggling which was increasingly important after 1600. The crown legally took one fifth ([[quinto real]]) at the source and obtained more through other taxes.

==Composition==
The ice composing the basin is thought to consist primarily of [[solid nitrogen|nitrogen ice]], with smaller fractions of carbon monoxide and methane ice, although relative proportions are uncertain.&lt;ref name = "Umurhan2016-01-08"/&gt; At Pluto's ambient temperature of {{convert|38|K|abbr=on}}, nitrogen and carbon monoxide ices are denser and much less rigid than water ice, making glacial-like flows possible; nitrogen ice is the most volatile.&lt;ref name = "Pluto updates"/&gt;

==Origin==
Sputnik Planitia may have originated as an [[impact basin]] that subsequently collected [[Volatiles|volatile ices]].&lt;ref name = "Pluto updates"/&gt; The size of the hypothetical impactor has been estimated as 150-300 km.&lt;ref name="LPSC2017McKinnon"&gt;{{cite conference|last1=McKinnon|first1=William B.|last2=Schenck|first2=P.

The accumulation of several kilometers of nitrogen ice in the basin was in part a consequence of its higher surface pressure, which leads to a higher N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; condensation temperature.&lt;ref name="BertrandForget2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Bertrand|first1=T.|last2= Forget|first2=F.|title= Observed glacier and volatile distribution on Pluto from atmosphere–topography processes|journal= Nature|volume= 540|issue= 7631|date= 19 September 2016|pages= 86–89|doi=10.1038/nature19337|pmid=27629517|bibcode=2016Natur.540...86B}}&lt;/ref&gt; The positive temperature gradient of Pluto's atmosphere contributes to making a topographic depression a cold trap.&lt;ref name = "Keane2016a" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Keane2016b" /&gt;

A high seasonal [[thermal inertia]] of Pluto's surface is an important driver of deposition of nitrogen ice at low latitudes. These latitudes receive less annual [[insolation]] than Pluto's polar regions due to its high [[obliquity]] (122.5°).&lt;ref name="Bertrand2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Bertrand|first1= T.|last2= Forget|first2= F.|title=Observed glacier and volatile distribution on Pluto from atmosphere–topography processes|journal= Nature|date= 19 September 2016|doi= 10.1038/nature19337|pmid=27629517|volume=540|issue= 7631|pages=86–89|bibcode= 2016Natur.540...86B}}&lt;/ref&gt; The coldest regions on Pluto, on average, are at 30° N. and S. latitude; early in Pluto's history, ice would tend to accumulate at these latitudes in a runaway process due to the positive feedback association of increased albedo, cooling and further ice deposition (similar to the ice segregation that occurred on [[Iapetus (moon)|Iapetus]]). Simulations suggest that over a period of about a million years, the runaway process would collect much of the ice into a single cap even in the absence of a preexisting basin.&lt;ref name="HamiltonStern2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Hamilton|first1=D.

The accumulation of dense nitrogen ice would have contributed to making Sputnik Planitia a positive [[gravity anomaly]], but by itself would not have been sufficient to overcome the topographic depression associated with the basin. However, other effects of an impact event (see below) could have also contributed to such an anomaly. A positive gravity anomaly could have caused [[True polar wander|polar wander]], reorienting the spin axis of Pluto to put the planitia near the Pluto-Charon tidal axis (the minimum-energy configuration).&lt;ref name = "Keane2016a"&gt;{{cite conference | first = J.

Other obvious indications of ice flow visible in images of the planitia include examples of valley-type glaciers flowing down into the basin from adjacent eastern highlands (the right lobe of Tombaugh Regio), presumably in response to deposition of nitrogen ice there,&lt;ref name = "Umurhan2016-01-08"&gt;{{cite web

The planitia has numerous blocky hills (one to several km across) that form aggregations at cell margins up to 20&amp;nbsp;km across; these may represent floating chunks of detached water ice crust that were carried onto the planitia by glacial flow and were then collected into troughs by the convection.&lt;ref name = "Pluto updates"/&gt; In some cases the hills seem to form chains along the entry paths of glaciers.

The planitia has numerous pits that are thought to result from fracturing and sublimation of nitrogen ice; these pits also collect in the margins of convection cells.&lt;ref name = "Pluto updates"/&gt; Often the bottoms of the pits are dark, which may represent an accumulation of [[tholin]]s left behind by the subliming ice, or a dark substrate below the planitia, if the pits penetrate all the way through the ice. In regions of the planitia where convection cells are not apparent, the pits are more numerous.

The '''administrative divisions of Tanzania''' are controlled by Part I, Article 2.2 of the [[Constitution of Tanzania]].&lt;ref&gt;Article 2.2 provides: ''For the purpose of the efficient discharge of the functions of the Government of the United Republic or of the Revolutionary Government of Zanzibar, the President may, in accordance with the procedures prescribed by law or provisions of such law as may be enacted by Parliament, divide the United Republic into regions, districts and other areas: Provided that the President shall first consult with the President of Zanzibar before dividing Tanzania Zanzibar into regions, districts or other areas.'' {{Cite web|url=http://www.policeforce.go.tz/pdf/REPUBLIC.pdf|title=Constitution of the United Republic of Tanzania, 1977 (Cap. 2), as amended|publisher=Tanzanian Police Force|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091222050849/http://www.policeforce.go.tz/pdf/REPUBLIC.pdf|archivedate=22 December 2009|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tanzania is divided into thirty-one [[Regions of Tanzania|regions]] (''mkoa in [[Swahili language|Swahili]]''). Each region is subdivided into [[Districts of Tanzania|districts]] (''[[wilaya]] in Swahili''). The districts are sub-divided into [[Division (country subdivision)|divisions]] (''tarafa in Swahili'') and further into [[Ward (country subdivision)|local wards]] (''kata in Swahili''). Wards are further subdivided for management purposes: for [[Urban area|urban]] wards into [[street]]s (''mtaa in Swahili'') and for [[Rural area|rural]] wards into  [[village]]s (''kijiji in Swahili''). The villages may be further subdivided into [[Hamlet (place)|hamlets]] (''vitongoji in Swahili'').

==Regions==
{{main|Regions of Tanzania}}
In 1922 under the [[British Empire|British]] Tanganyika was divided into twenty-two regions, known as "divisions": Arusha, Bagamoyo, Bukoba, Daressalam, Dodoma, Iringa, Kilwa, Kondoa-Irangi, Lindi, Mahenge, Morogoro, Moshi, Mwanza, Pangani, Rufiji, Rungwe, Songea, Tabora, Tanga, Ufipa, Ujiji, and Usambara.

==Districts==
{{main|Districts of Tanzania}}
According to the 2012 Tanzania National Census, Tanzania was divided into 169 districts. There is one type of rural district: a ''District Council''. And there are three types of urban districts: ''Town Council'', ''Municipal Council'' and ''City Council''.&lt;ref name="Census 2012"&gt;{{cite web|title=Census 2012|url=http://50.87.153.5/~eastc/sensa/index.php/welcome|website=National Bureau of Statistics|accessdate=9 December 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305154228/http://50.87.153.5/~eastc/sensa/index.php/welcome|archivedate=5 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Divisions==
A division is an administrative organization for several Wards. Every division has its own elected MP (Member of Parliament).

==Wards==
A village is the lowest government administrative structure at the community level. In an urban area, a cluster (mtaa) can include a number of streets. A Ward (Kata) is an administrative structure for one single town or portion of a bigger town (Urban Wards). Rural wards are composed of several villages.

He later became a poor law commissioner, census commissioner and finally executive head of the British administration in Ireland as [[Under Secretary for Ireland|under-secretary]] to the [[Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland]], a position the government of the day was eager for him to take.

The longest-serving under-secretary (1853–1868), and a man of unusual abilities, Larcom had a distinguished career in his adopted country and acted with an impartiality that won him respect from all parties. In 1868 he was admitted to the [[Irish Privy Council]] and created a Baronet.

[[Image:Chart1.jpg|thumb|350px|Example of a TSS on a chart]]
A '''Traffic Separation Scheme''' or '''TSS''' is a traffic-management route-system ruled by the [[International Maritime Organization]] or IMO.
The traffic-lanes (or clearways) indicate the general direction of the ships in that zone; ships navigating within a TSS all sail in the same direction or they cross the lane in an angle as close to 90 degrees as possible.

TSSs are used to regulate the traffic at busy, confined waterways or around capes. Within a TSS you normally see at least one traffic-lane in each main-direction, turning-points, deep-water lanes and separation zones between the main traffic lanes. In most TSS schemes you will find Inshore Traffic Zones between the traffic-lanes and the coast. The inshore traffic zone is unregulated and shouldn't be used for ongoing traffic. It is meant for local traffic, fishing and small craft.

A ship navigating in a traffic-lane should sail in the general direction of that lane. The body of water between two opposite lanes is to be avoided by vessels travelling within the TSS as far as possible except in certain circumstances such as emergencies or for fishing activities.

The TSS rules are incorporated in the [[International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea]] (Under Part B, Section I, Rule 10- Traffic Separation Schemes)

As said, when sailing within a lane of a TSS that ship has to follow the general direction of the lane. Where needed there are special zones where a lane splits into two channels: one ongoing and the other to the nearby port(s).

== Objectives ==
Objectives of IMO Routeing Schemes:
#  Help reduce and manage head on situations for the streams of opposing traffic
#  Help manage crossing situation arising while entering or coming out of port
#  In areas of offshore activities, directives regarding safe distance from the installations
#  Providing routes for deep draught vessels
#  Avoiding presence of routine traffic from some areas as desired by administration
#  Better management of inshore traffic zone, fishing zones and areas dangerous to navigation due to presence of isolated dangers and shoal patches in a high density traffic area.

==Crossing==
[[Image:VTG.svg|thumb|right|Top: Without current, Bottom: Strong current from the left]]
If a ship wants to cross a traffic-lane it should do so at a right angle to avoid  endangering ship traffic using the traffic-lanes (although traffic in the lane does not automatically have the right-of-way&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.knvts.nl/S&amp;W%20archief/Aanvaring%20vrolijk%20primrose.pdf Collision of the ''Cornelis Vrolijk'' and the ferry ''Primrose''] (Dutch), visited 20 November 2009&lt;/ref&gt;). To minimize the amount of time a crossing ship spend crossing the traffic-lanes, there should be a right angle between the lane direction and the keel direction - even if currents might shift the actual direction of the ship's movement to some angle other than 90 degrees.

==Locations==
{{further|List of Traffic Separation Schemes}}
TSSs are used in locations where there is a lot of traffic (busy shipping areas) where not regulating the traffic would lead to more accidents. In [[Europe]], many TSS areas are found around the Southern part of the [[North Sea]] including the [[English Channel]]. Other TSS are in place off [[Land's End]] and around Ouessant ([[Ushant]]).

Well-known TSS locations include: The [[English Channel]], [[German Bight]], [[Singapore]], and [[Cape Horn]]. The Dover Strait/Détroit du Pas de Calais was the first
International Maritime Organisation (IMO) approved Traffic Separation Scheme in the world in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dft.gov.uk/mca/mcga07-home/emergencyresponse/mcga-searchandrescue/mcga-theroleofhmcoasguard/mcga_-_hm_coastguard_-_the_dover_strait.htm |title=The Dover Strait |publisher=Dft.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.rin.org.uk/Uploadedpdfs/ItemAttachments/Fairway%2033-web.pdf |title=Fairway |publisher= |date=Autumn 2011 |accessdate=2012-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other TSS areas can be found in the [[Mediterranean Sea]], western side of the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]].

A '''wildcatter''' is an American term for an individual who [[drilling rig|drill]]s [[Oil wells#By purpose|wildcat wells]], which are exploration [[oil well]]s drilled in areas not known to be [[oil field]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wildcatter Definition|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/wildcatter?s=t|website=Dictionary.com|publisher=Dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable wildcatters include [[Glenn McCarthy]], [[Thomas Baker Slick, Sr.]] and [[Michael Late Benedum|Mike Benedum]], [[Joe Trees]], [[Clem S. Clarke]], and [[Columbus Marion Joiner]]; the latter is responsible for finding the [[East Texas Oil Field]] in 1930.

The term dates from the early oil industry in western [[Pennsylvania]]. Oil wells in unproven territory were called "wild-cat wells" by 1871, and those who drilled them were called "wild-catters" by 1876.&lt;ref&gt;"Fortunes flirtations," Titusville ''Herald'', 29 Mar. 1871, p.3 c.5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tionesta (PA) ''The Forest Republican'', 11 Oct. 1876, p.3 c.2.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, the [[Titusville, Pennsylvania|Titusville]] ''Herald'' noted in 1880:
:"The discovery of the fluid in [[New York State]] was the signal for a general exodus of wildcatters from all parts of the oil country ..."&lt;ref&gt;"From Parker City," ''Titusville (Penn.) Herald'', 1 March 1880, p.3.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to tradition, the origin of the term in the petroleum industry comes from Wildcat Hollow, now in [[Oil Creek State Park]] near [[Titusville, Pennsylvania|Titusville]], [[Pennsylvania]].  Wildcat Hollow was one of the many productive fields in the early oil era. A speculator who risked his luck by drilling in this narrow valley shot a wildcat, had it stuffed and set it atop his derrick.  The mounted cat gave its name to the hollow.  Because the area was largely untested and somewhat away from Oil Creek Flats, the term Wildcatter was coined, describing a person who risked drilling in an unproven area.

However, ''wildcat'' was American slang for any risky business venture by 1838, long before the rise of the petroleum industry.&lt;ref&gt;Christine Ammer.''It's Raining Cats and Dogs ... and Other Beastly Expressions'' (New York: Bantam Doubleday Dell, 1989) 152.&lt;/ref&gt; An example was the [[wildcat banking]] of the 1850s. Directors of wildcat banks in the Midwest were known as "wild-catters" before [[Edwin Drake]]'s discovery of oil in Pennsylvania.&lt;ref&gt;"Wild-cats in Iowa," Chicago ''Tribune'', 28 Dec. 1857, p.2 c.5.&lt;/ref&gt;

The captain of a steam ship naturally chooses the shortest route to his destination. Since a sailing ship is usually pushed by winds and currents, its captain must find a route where the wind will probably blow in the right direction. [[Tacking (sailing)|Tacking]], i.e. using contrary wind to pull (sic) the sails, was always possible but wasted time because of the zigzagging required, and this would significantly delay long voyages. The early European explorers were not only looking for new lands. They also had to discover the pattern of winds and currents that would carry them where they wanted to go. During the [[age of sail]] winds and currents determined trade routes and therefore influenced European imperialism and modern political geography. For an outline to the main wind systems see [[Global wind patterns]].

[[Pilotage]] or [[cabotage]], in one sense, is the art of sailing along the coast using known landmarks. [[Navigation]], in one sense, is the art of sailing long distances out of sight of land.&lt;ref&gt;This somewhat unorthodox definition was proposed by J. H. Parry, 'The Age of Reconnaissance', 1963,page 98. Fernandez-Armesto uses 'cabotage' for Parry's 'pilotage'&lt;/ref&gt; Although the [[Polynesians]] were able to sail the Pacific (with great difficulty) and people regularly sailed north and south across the Mediterranean, before the time of Columbus nearly all sailing was coastal pilotage.

==Asians==

'''East Asia:''' A Chinese or Japanese sailor who sails east finds only thousands of miles of empty ocean and a few tiny islands. The [[Kuroshio Current]] tends to push his ship northeast into the [[westerlies]] and towards North America. There are records of unlucky Japanese fishermen being blown to North America, but no records of any who sailed home.&lt;ref&gt;Hayes, Derek, ''Historical Atlas of the North Pacific'', page 52 and [[Exploration of the Pacific]], footnote 1.&lt;/ref&gt; It is easy to sail south and link up with the Indian Ocean trade. North China had few ports and little coastwise trade. South China has a number of good ports but the country inland is hilly or mountainous which restricts trade.

'''Indian Ocean and the Monsoon Trade:''' There are no barriers to trade along the coast between the Red Sea and Japan. Local coastal routes soon were linked and extended to Indonesia. By about 850 trade was mostly in Arab or Muslim hands. This trade brought Hinduism and later Islam to Indonesia. A great advantage in the Indian Ocean is the [[Monsoon of south Asia|monsoon]] which blows south in the winter and north in the summer. An Arab wishing to go to Africa or Indonesia would go south on the winter monsoon and return north with the summer monsoon. In Africa this trade extended about as far as Mozambique at the southern limit of monsoon winds. Further south was a [[lee shore]] with no trade goods that could not be obtained further north. It is not clear how far south trade and geographic knowledge extended, but there is said to be a Chinese map of the thirteenth century showing Africa in roughly its true shape and there is a Venetian report from the mid-fifteenth century of a Chinese or Javanese junk seen off the southwest African coast.&lt;ref&gt;Fernandez-Armesto, ''Pathfinders'', page 116&lt;/ref&gt;

Note that the boundary between the westerlies and the trade winds moves north in summer and south in winter.]]
[[File:Cabral voyage 1500.svg|thumb|right|259px|Portuguese route to India, outbound in red, return route in blue.]]

'''Northwest Africa:''' A European who leaves the Strait of Gibraltar soon hits the [[Canary current]] which pushes him southwest down the African coast. He soon reaches the northeast [[trade winds]] which also push him southwest. If he leaves in late summer he will hit the trade winds sooner since wind systems move north and south with the seasons. The problem was to get back again. The solution was the [[volta do mar]] in which a captain would sail northwest across the winds and currents until he found the [[westerlies]] and was blown back to Europe.

The coast of Northwest Africa might be described as the nursery of European imperialism.&lt;ref&gt;Felipe Fernadez-Armesto, 'Before Columbus', 1987 is a good account of this period&lt;/ref&gt; Experience gained here was the basis for the sudden breakout into all the world's oceans in the 30-year period of 1492-1522. The [[Canary Islands]] were known to the ancients. They were reached by [[Lancelotto Malocello]] in 1312. [[Jean de Béthencourt]] conquered two of them in 1405 but the larger islands were not fully subdued until about 1495. The local [[Guanches]] have the distinction of being the first non-European people to be wiped out by European expansion. The volta do mar led to the discovery of uninhabited [[Madeira]] in 1419 which soon developed a trade in wine and sugar. A longer volta do mar led to the uninhabited [[Azores]] which are over 700 miles from the nearest land. Further south the [[Cape Verde Islands]] developed a system of slave-worked sugar plantations which was later exported to Brazil. The Canaries were taken by Spain and the other islands fell to Portugal. Northwest Africa was the starting point longer voyages, the Spanish heading southwest from the Canaries and the Portuguese south from Cape Verde.

'''Down the coast of Africa:'''  The Portuguese reached the westernmost point of Africa in 1444 and in 1458 rounded [[Cape Palmas]] where the coast tends eastward. Here the trade winds gave out and they faced the irregular winds near the [[doldrums]] and the east-flowing [[Guinea Current]]. In 1471 they reached the [[Gold Coast (region)|Gold coast]] where they found the gold that had previously come by caravan across the Sahara. In 1474 [[Lopes Gonçalves]] reached the point where the coast turns south and became the first European sailor to cross the equator.  In 1475-79 Spain and Portugal fought along the coast. The [[Treaty of Alcáçovas]] gave the whole area to the Portuguese except for the Canaries. This was the first colonial war and the first colonial treaty. In 1482 [[Diogo Cão]] continued south against the [[Benguela current]] and the southeast trade winds, reaching the [[Congo River]] in 1482 and [[Cape Cross]] in Namibia in 1485. In 1487 [[Bartolomeu Dias]] reached Cape Voltas near the mouth of the [[Orange River]] and stood out to sea. Although the sources are not clear, he may have guessed that there were southern westerlies and was trying a volta do mar. After many days, at about 40 degrees south he discovered the [[roaring fourties|westerlies]] and turned east. Finding no land after a number of days he turned north and reached [[Mossel Bay]] about 400&amp;nbsp;km east of Cape Town. He continued east against the [[Agulhas current]] to [[Algoa Bay]] where the coast began to turn north. Guessing that he had found the route to India, he turned back, discovered and rounded the [[Cape of Good Hope]] and reached Lisbon in 1488. In 1493 Columbus arrived at Lisbon with news of the new world and reported that he had sailed out of sight of land for five weeks. 

In 1497 [[Vasco da Gama]] chose a very obvious and very bold route. After rounding the bulge of Africa he sailed directly south across the trade winds and, helped by the [[Brazil Current]] reached the [[roaring forties]].  This was by far the longest voyage yet made out of sight of land. Turning east too soon, he hit the coast and had to work his way around South Africa. Working up the coast against the [[Agulhas Current]], at Mozambique he came in contact with the Arab monsoon trade. At [[Malindi]] he found a local pilot and used the summer monsoon to reach India in 23 days. Returning he foolishly sailed against the summer monsoon and took 132 days to reach Africa. Rounding the Cape of Good Hope, he again chose a wise and bold course. He took the southeast [[trade winds]] directly northwest across the South Atlantic to the Cape Verde Islands, the Azores, and home. Not only did Da Gama find a sea route to India, he discovered the most efficient sailing route there and back.  In 1500 [[Pedro Álvares Cabral]] sailed somewhat west of Da Gama's route and bumped onto the coast of Brazil.

'''Portuguese and Dutch in the Indian Ocean:''' After a few more voyages the Portuguese learned two things: that there was little market for European goods in the east, and the large Portuguese ships could outfight nearly any local craft. They therefore determined to take by force what they could not get by honest trade. Under the leadership of [[Afonso de Albuquerque]] they captured [[Goa]] in 1510 for their main base, captured [[Malacca]] in 1511 to control the [[Strait of Malacca]], tried to block the mouths of the [[Red Sea]] and the [[Persian Gulf]] and built forts in Mozambique to pick up fresh water and wait for the summer monsoon. In 1513 they reached the [[Maluku Islands|Spice Islands]] and in 1519, the same year that Balboa first saw the Pacific, reached [[Guangzhou|Canton]]. They continued to use the monsoon route - north with the summer monsoon and south with the winter monsoon.

The Dutch republic began its remarkable rise about 1580 during its war of independence from Spain. With [[Iberian Union|the union of the two crowns]] in 1580 it was also at war with Portugal. In 1595 [[Jan Huyghen van Linschoten]] published previously-secret Portuguese sailing directions for the Indian Ocean. The Dutch reached Java in 1596 and the [[Maluku Islands|Spice Islands]] in 1599. In 1611 [[Hendrik Brouwer]] found a better route to the East Indies. After reaching the roaring forties he continued east almost to Australia and then swung north. This avoided Portuguese warships and greatly reduced the travel time since there was no need to wait for the monsoon. This [[Brouwer Route]] shifted the gateway to the Indies from the [[Strait of Malacca]] between Malaya and Sumatra to the [[Sunda Strait]] between Sumatra and Java and led to the foundation of [[Jakarta Old Town|Batavia]] in 1619. Dutch trade led to the temporary occupation of [[Dutch Brazil]] and the foundation of [[Cape Town]] as a way station on the Brouwer Route in 1652.

==Europeans Westward==

'''North Atlantic:''' The European who sails west is sailing [[westerlies|into the wind]]. Further north, he is sailing against the [[Gulf Stream]].  It is not clear how winds and currents were used in this region.&lt;ref&gt;Fernandez-Armesto, Pathfinders, page 150 and 161, mentions 'brief spring variables' between the British Isles and Newfoundland, but does not give an adequate account&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Caribbean:''' Columbus underestimated the size of the earth and thought he could reach China by doing a grand volta do mar, going west on the [[trade winds]] and returning home on the [[westerlies]]. He had the right route but reached the [[Caribbean Sea]] rather than China. In 1513 [[Juan Ponce de León]] while exploring the east coast of Florida discovered the [[Gulf Stream]].  A few years later his pilot, Anton de Alaminos, used the Gulf Stream to push him north to the westerlies and return to Spain. This established the standard Spanish route to the Americas: south to the Canary Islands, west on the trade winds to the Caribbean, then beat against the wind north of Cuba using the [[Florida Current]] to the Gulf Steam, use it to go north to the westerlies which led directly home. Since wind systems move north in summer and south in winter, there is a question of the best season, which is poorly documented. The Caribbean was the gateway to Spanish America since it is the closest part of America to Europe measured in sailing days. Nearby were the riches of Mexico and, by crossing Panama, the riches of Peru.
[[Image:ClipperRoute.png|thumb|right|250px|The '''Clipper Route''' followed by ships sailing between England and Australia/New Zealand.]]
'''Strait of Magellan and the Pacific:''' [[Ferdinand Magellan]] discovered the [[Strait of Magellan|strait which bears his name]] in 1519. Entering the Pacific, he used the [[Humboldt Current]] to go north to the trade winds which then blew him westward to the Philippines. [[Trinidad (ship)|One of his surviving ships]] tried to return east using the northern westerlies but was unable to find them and was forced to return to the East Indies. In 1565 [[Andrés de Urdaneta]] found a wind system that would reliably blow a ship eastward back to the Americas. From then until 1815 the annual [[Manila Galleons]] crossed the Pacific from Mexico to the Philippines and back. The Strait of Magellan was rarely used since it was so far out of the way.  The Spanish found it more practical to build ships on the Pacific coast. Silver from Peru was carried north on the [[Humboldt Current]] to Panama and carried across the isthmus to join [[Spanish treasure fleet]] in the Caribbean. Fernandez-Armesto thinks that southbound ships stood out to sea from Panama to avoid the Humboldt Current, but offers no good evidence.

'''Cape Horn:''' In 1616, almost 100 years after Magellan, [[Willem Schouten]] went further south and found [[Cape Horn]].  This was a better route because it does not require navigating a narrow channel. Only after about 1780 did significant numbers of ships use the Cape Horn route.  Cape Horn westbound is difficult because the wind blows from the west and the east-bound [[Antarctic Circumpolar Current]] is forced through the gap between Tierra del Fuego and Antarctica. The nineteenth century [[Clipper Route|Clipper Ship Route]] went from Europe southward to the roaring forties, took them to Australia, and continued east around Cape Horn and returned to England.

'''‘Aziziya''' or '''El Azizia'''  ({{lang-ar|'''العزيزيه '''}} ''Al ʿAzīzīyah'') was one of the [[Districts of Libya#Former baladiya|districts]] of Libya (''[[baladiyah]]''), located in the northwest of the country, south of [[Tripoli District, Libya|Tripoli District]].  The town of [[‘Aziziya]] was the former district's capital, and it covered an area of 1,940 square kilometers. In 2001 ‘Aziziya became part of the [[Jafara]] District.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20061015234155/http://www.gpc.gov.ly/online_alshabyat/index.php?sh=20 "شعبية الجفارة" ("Districts of Libya: Al Jfara")]  Website of the General People's Committee of Libya, from [[Internet Archive]] dated 18 April 2006&lt;/ref&gt;
