      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3669">In [[computer graphics]], '''A-buffer''', also known as '''anti-aliased''', '''area-averaged''' or '''accumulation buffer''', is a general hidden surface mechanism suited to medium scale virtual memory computers. It resolves visibility among an arbitrary collection of opaque, transparent, and intersecting objects. Using an easy to compute Fourier window (box filter), it increases the effective image resolution many times over the Z-buffer, with a moderate increase in cost.&lt;ref name=CARP84&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.210.5497 |first=Loren |last=Carpenter |authorlink=Loren Carpenter |title=The A-buffer, an Antialiased Hidden Surface Method |journal=Computer Graphics |volume=18 |issue=3 |date=July 1984 |pages=103–108  |accessdate=2014-09-10 |doi=10.1145/964965.808585}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The A-buffer method is a descendant of the well known Z-buffer, which provides good quality results in moderate time.

== Uses ==

In 3-D image synthesis system, the balance between the quality and the cost of computation has always been needed. Using a full object-precision visible-surface algorithm at each pixel is expensive. A-buffer method provides moderate quality results in moderate cost of computation.

A-buffer help in using visibility techniques and support all conceivable geometric modeling primitives: polygons, patches, quadrics, fractals, and so forth. It also help to handle transparency and intersecting surfaces (and transparent intersecting surfaces).

== Strategy ==

Carpenter's A-buffer algorithm&lt;ref name=CARP84/&gt; addresses this problem by approximating [[Edwin Catmull|Catmull's]] per-pixel object-precision area sampling&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=A Hidden-Surface Algorithm with Anti-Aliasing |first=Edwin |last=Catmull |authorlink=Edwin Catmull |url=http://design.osu.edu/carlson/history/PDFs/catmull-zbuffer.pdf |journal=Computer Graphics |volume=12 |issue=3 |pages=6–11 |date=August 1978 |doi=10.1145/965139.807360}}&lt;/ref&gt; with per-pixel image-precision operation performed on a sub-pixel grid. Polygons are first processed in scan-line order by clipping them to each square pixel they cover. This result in list of clipped polygon fragments corresponding to each square pixel. Each fragment have 4 by 8 bit mask of parts of the pixel it covers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Foley |first1=James D. |authorlink1=James D. Foley |last2=Feiner |first2=Steven K. |last3=van Dam |first3=Andries |authorlink3=Andries van Dam |last4=Hughes |first4=John F. |authorlink4=John F. Hughes |date=1995 |title=[[Computer Graphics: Principles and Practice]] in C |edition=2nd |isbn= 0-201-84840-6 |publisher=Addison-Wesley}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bit-mask for a fragment was computed by [[bitwise XOR|xoring]] together masks representing each of the fragment's edges. When all polygons intersecting a pixel have been processed, the area-weighted average of the colors of the pixel's visible surfaces is obtained by selecting fragments in depth-sorted order and using their bit masks to clip those of farther fragments.

The bit masks can be manipulated efficiently with [[Boolean operations on polygons|Boolean operations]]. For example, two fragment bit masks can be added together to determine the overlap between them. The A-buffer algorithm saves only a small amount of additional information with each fragment. For example. It includes the fragment's z extent, but no information about which part of the fragment is associated with these z values. Thus, the algorithm must make assumptions about the sub-pixel geometry in cases in which fragment bit masks overlap in z.

The '''APG II system''' ('''Angiosperm Phylogeny Group II system''') of plant classification is the second, now obsolete, version of a modern, mostly [[Molecular phylogenetics|molecular]]-based,  [[list of systems of plant taxonomy|system of plant taxonomy]] that was published in April 2003 by the [[Angiosperm Phylogeny Group]].&lt;ref name="APGII"&gt;Angiosperm Phylogeny Group (2003). [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1095-8339.2003.t01-1-00158.x/abstract An update of the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group classification for the orders and families of flowering plants: APG II.] ''[[Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society]]'' 141(4): 399-436. [[doi: 10.1046/j.1095-8339.2003.t01-1-00158.x]]&lt;/ref&gt; It was a revision of the first [[APG system]], published in 1998, and was superseded in 2009 by a further revision, the [[APG III system]].

==History==

APG II was published as:
*Angiosperm Phylogeny Group (2003). "An update of the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group classification for the orders and families of flowering plants: APG II". ''[[Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society]]'' '''141'''(4): 399-436. (Available online: [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1095-8339.2003.t01-1-00158.x/abstract Abstract] | [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1095-8339.2003.t01-1-00158.x/full Full text (HTML)] | [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1095-8339.2003.t01-1-00158.x/pdf Full text (PDF)] [[doi: 10.1046/j.1095-8339.2003.t01-1-00158.x]])

Each of the APG systems represents the broad consensus of a number of [[Systematics|systematic]] [[botanist]]s, united in the APG, working at several institutions worldwide.

The APG II system recognized 45 [[Order (biology)|orders]], five more than the APG system. The new orders were [[Austrobaileyales]], [[Canellales]], [[Gunnerales]], [[Celastrales]], and [[Crossosomatales]], all of which were families unplaced as to order, although contained in [[Order (biology)|supra-ordinal]] clades, in the APG system. APG II recognized 457 [[Family (biology)|families]], five fewer than the APG system. Thirty-nine of the APG II families were not placed in any order, but 36 of the 39 were placed in a supra-ordinal clade within the angiosperms. Fifty-five of the families came to be known as "bracketed families". They were optional [[Segregate (taxonomy)|segregates]] of families that could be [[Circumscription (taxonomy)|circumscribed]] in a [[sensu lato|larger sense]].

The APG II system was influential and was adopted in whole or in part (sometimes with modifications) in a number of references. It was superseded 6½ years later by the [[APG III system]], published in October 2009.

==Groups==
[[File:FlowerPlantsSystemTreeEn.PNG|thumb|upright=1.5| [[Cladogram]] showing the relationships, but excluding taxa not placed within an [[Order (biology)|order]]]]

Main groups in the system (all [[Taxonomic rank#Ranks in botany|unranked]] [[clade]]s between the [[Taxonomic rank|ranks]] of [[Class (biology)|class]] and [[Order (biology)|order]]):
*'''angiosperms :'''
*:'''[[magnoliids]]'''

*::::'''[[eurosids I]]'''
*::::'''[[eurosids II]]'''
*:::'''[[asterids]]'''
*::::'''[[euasterids I]]'''
*::::'''[[euasterids II]]'''

Shown below is the classification in full detail, except for the fifteen genera and three families that were [[unplaced in APG II]]. The unplaced [[Taxon|taxa]] were listed at the end of the appendix in a section entitled "Taxa of Uncertain Position". Under some of the clades are listed the families that were placed [[incertae sedis]] in that clade. Thirty-six families were so placed. This means that their [[Phylogenetics|relationship]] to other members of the clade is not known.

The English biologist [[Thomas Henry Huxley]] coined the word ''agnostic'' in 1869, and said "It simply means that a man shall not say he knows or believes that which he has no scientific grounds for professing to know or believe."
Earlier thinkers, however, had written works that promoted agnostic points of view, such as [[Sanjaya Belatthaputta]], a 5th-century BCE [[Ancient Indian philosophy|Indian philosopher]] who expressed agnosticism about any [[afterlife]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/dn/dn.02.0.than.html |title=Samaññaphala Sutta: The Fruits of the Contemplative Life |others=a part of the Digha Nikaya translated in 1997 by Thanissaro Bhikkhu |quote=If you ask me if there exists another world (after death),&amp;nbsp;...

==Defining agnosticism==

{{quote|Agnosticism is of the essence of science, whether ancient or modern. It simply means that a man shall not say he knows or believes that which he has no scientific grounds for professing to know or believe.

Consequently, agnosticism puts aside not only the greater part of popular theology, but also the greater part of anti-theology. On the whole, the "bosh" of [[heterodoxy]] is more offensive to me than that of orthodoxy, because heterodoxy professes to be guided by reason and science, and orthodoxy does not.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Huxley, [http://aleph0.clarku.edu/huxley/UnColl/Rdetc/AgnAnn.html "Agnosticism: A Symposium"], ''The Agnostic Annual.'' 1884&lt;/ref&gt;|Thomas Henry Huxley}}

{{quote|That which Agnostics deny and repudiate, as immoral, is the contrary doctrine, that there are propositions which men ought to believe, without logically satisfactory evidence; and that reprobation ought to attach to the profession of disbelief in such inadequately supported propositions.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Huxley, [http://aleph0.clarku.edu/huxley/CE5/Agn-X.html "Agnosticism and Christianity"], ''Collected Essays V'', 1899&lt;/ref&gt;|Thomas Henry Huxley}}

{{quote|Agnosticism, in fact, is not a creed, but a method, the essence of which lies in the rigorous application of a single principle&amp;nbsp;... Positively the principle may be expressed: In matters of the intellect, follow your reason as far as it will take you, without regard to any other consideration. And negatively: In matters of the intellect do not pretend that conclusions are certain which are not demonstrated or demonstrable.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Huxley, [http://aleph0.clarku.edu/huxley/CE5/Agn.html "Agnosticism"], ''Collected Essays V'', 1889&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Huxley|first=Thomas Henry|date=April 1889|title=Agnosticism|journal=[[Popular Science|The Popular Science Monthly]]|publisher=[[D.

Being a scientist, above all else, [[Thomas Henry Huxley|Huxley]] presented agnosticism as a form of demarcation. A hypothesis with no supporting, objective, testable evidence is not an objective, scientific claim. As such, there would be no way to test said hypotheses, leaving the results inconclusive. His agnosticism was not compatible with forming a belief as to the truth, or falsehood, of the claim at hand. [[Karl Popper]] would also describe himself as an agnostic.&lt;ref name="Edward Zerin 1998"&gt;Edward Zerin: Karl Popper On God: The Lost Interview. ''Skeptic'' '''6''':2 (1998)&lt;/ref&gt; According to philosopher [[William L. Rowe]], in this strict sense, agnosticism is the view that human reason is incapable of providing sufficient rational grounds to justify either the belief that God exists or the belief that God does not exist.&lt;ref name=RoweRoutledge/&gt;

[[George H. Smith]], while admitting that the narrow definition of atheist was the common usage definition of that word,&lt;ref&gt;George H. Smith, Atheism: The Case Against God, pg. 9&lt;/ref&gt; and admitting that the broad definition of agnostic was the common usage definition of that word,&lt;ref&gt;George H. Smith, Atheism: The Case Against God, pg. 12&lt;/ref&gt; promoted broadening the definition of atheist and narrowing the definition of agnostic. Smith rejects agnosticism as a third alternative to [[theism]] and [[atheism]] and promotes terms such as [[agnostic atheism]] (the view of those who do not ''believe'' in the existence of any [[deity]], but do not claim to ''know'' if a deity does or does not exist) and [[agnostic theism]] (the view of those who do not claim to ''know'' of the existence of any deity, but still ''believe'' in such an existence).&lt;ref name=Smith1979&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=FI7ZAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=atheism+the+case+against+god&amp;q=agnostic+theist#search_anchor |title=Atheism: The Case Against God |first=George H |last=Smith |authorlink=George H. Smith |pages=10–11 |quote=Properly considered, agnosticism is not a third alternative to theism and atheism because it is concerned with a different aspect of religious belief. Theism and atheism refer to the presence or absence of belief in a god; agnosticism refers to the impossibility of knowledge with regard to a god or supernatural being. The term ''agnostic'' does not, in itself, indicate whether or not one believes in a god. Agnosticism can be either theistic or atheistic. |year=1979 |isbn=978-0-87975-124-1 }}

===Etymology===
''Agnostic'' ({{ety|grc|ἀ- (a-)|without||[[wikt:γνῶσις|γνῶσις]] (gnōsis)|knowledge}}) was used by Thomas Henry Huxley in a speech at a meeting of the Metaphysical Society in 1869 to describe his philosophy, which rejects all claims of spiritual or mystical knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Dixon| first = Thomas| title = Science and Religion: A Very Short Introduction| publisher = Oxford University Press| year = 2008| location = Oxford| page = 63| isbn = 978-0-19-929551-7}}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EB-Agnosticism"&gt;
{{cite encyclopedia|last=Antony|first=Flew|title=Agnosticism|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/9356/agnosticism|work=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=December 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early [[Christian]] church leaders used the [[Greek language|Greek]] word ''[[gnosis]]'' (knowledge) to describe "spiritual knowledge". Agnosticism is not to be confused with religious views opposing the ancient religious movement of [[Gnosticism]] in particular; Huxley used the term in a broader, more abstract sense.&lt;ref name="nknxjx"&gt;{{cite web|title=ag·nos·tic|website=The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|year=2011|url=http://ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=agnostic&amp;submit.x=20&amp;submit.y=28|accessdate= November 15, 2013}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
Huxley identified agnosticism not as a creed but rather as a method of [[Skepticism|skeptical]], evidence-based inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=97DaE6BzKTsC&amp;pg=PA41 |title=Aphorisms and Reflections |first=Henrietta A.| last=Huxley|publisher=Kessinger Publishing |year=2004|edition=reprint |pages=41–42|isbn=978-1-4191-0730-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, scientific literature dealing with neuroscience and psychology has used the word to mean "not knowable".&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary, Additions Series, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;
In technical and marketing literature, "agnostic" can also mean independence from some parameters—for example, "platform agnostic"&lt;ref name=SparkSheet&gt;{{cite web

===Qualifying agnosticism===
[[Scottish Enlightenment]] philosopher [[David Hume]] contended that meaningful statements about the universe are always qualified by some degree of doubt. He asserted that the fallibility of human beings means that they cannot obtain absolute certainty except in trivial cases where a statement is true by definition (e.g. [[tautology (logic)|tautologies]] such as "all bachelors are unmarried" or "all triangles have three corners").&lt;ref&gt;Hume, David, "An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding" (1748)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Types===
;Strong agnosticism (also called "hard", "closed", "strict", or "permanent agnosticism"): The view that the question of the existence or nonexistence of a deity or deities, and the nature of ultimate reality is unknowable by reason of our natural inability to verify any experience with anything but another subjective experience. A strong agnostic would say, "I cannot know whether a deity exists or not, and neither can you."&lt;ref name="Oppy2006"&gt;{{cite book|last=Oppy |first=Graham|title=Arguing about Gods|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DlVtfUxPD14C&amp;pg=PA15|date=September 4, 2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-45889-4|pages=15–}}

&lt;/ref&gt;
;Weak agnosticism (also called "soft", "open", "empirical", or "temporal agnosticism"): The view that the existence or nonexistence of any deities is currently unknown but is not necessarily unknowable; therefore, one will withhold judgment until evidence, if any, becomes available. A weak agnostic would say, "I don't know whether any deities exist or not, but maybe one day, if there is evidence, we can find something out."&lt;ref name="Oppy2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Barnes2003" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Poidevin2010" /&gt;
;Apathetic agnosticism: The view that no amount of debate can prove or disprove the existence of one or more deities, and if one or more deities exist, they do not appear to be concerned about the fate of humans. Therefore, their existence has little to no impact on personal human affairs and should be of little interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.apatheticagnostic.com/ourchurch/faith.html|title=Commentary on the Articles of Faith|author=John Tyrrell|year=1996|quote=To believe in the existence of a god is an act of faith.

presented arguments attempting to rationally prove the existence of God. The skeptical empiricism of [[David Hume]], the [[antinomy|antinomies]] of [[Immanuel Kant]], and the existential philosophy of [[Søren Kierkegaard]] convinced many later philosophers to abandon these attempts, regarding it impossible to construct any unassailable proof for the existence or non-existence of God.&lt;ref name="RoweRoutledge-online"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.texttribe.com/routledge/A/Agnosticism.html |title=Agnosticism |first=William L. |last=Rowe |authorlink=William L.

{{quote|Let us call this unknown something: God. It is nothing more than a name we assign to it. The idea of demonstrating that this unknown something (God) exists, could scarcely suggest itself to Reason. For if God does not exist it would of course be impossible to prove it; and if he does exist it would be folly to attempt it. For at the very outset, in beginning my proof, I would have presupposed it, not as doubtful but as certain (a presupposition is never doubtful, for the very reason that it is a presupposition), since otherwise I would not begin, readily understanding that the whole would be impossible if he did not exist. But if when I speak of proving God's existence I mean that I propose to prove that the Unknown, which exists, is God, then I express myself unfortunately. For in that case I do not prove anything, least of all an existence, but merely develop the content of a conception.}}

[[David Hume|Hume]] was Huxley's favourite philosopher, calling him "the Prince of Agnostics".&lt;ref&gt;A Hundred Years of British Philosophy, By Rudolf Metz, pg. 111&lt;/ref&gt; [[Denis Diderot|Diderot]] wrote to his mistress, telling of a visit by Hume to the [[Baron D'Holbach]], and describing how a word for the position that Huxley would later describe as agnosticism didn't seem to exist, or at least wasn't common knowledge, at the time.

{{quote|The first time that M. Hume found himself at the table of the Baron, he was seated beside him. I don't know for what purpose the English philosopher took it into his head to remark to the Baron that he did not believe in atheists, that he had never seen any.

The Baron added: "It isn't too bad a showing to be able to point out to you fifteen at once: the three others haven't made up their minds."&lt;ref&gt;Ernest Campbell Mossner, ''The Life of David Hume'', 2014, pg.483&lt;/ref&gt;|Denis Diderot}}

Raised in a religious environment, [[Charles Darwin]] (1809-1882) studied to be an Anglican clergyman. While eventually doubting parts of his faith, Darwin continued to help in church affairs, even while avoiding church attendance. Darwin stated that it would be "absurd to doubt that a man might be an ardent theist and an evolutionist".&lt;ref name=Fordyce&gt;[http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/entry-12041 Letter 12041] – Darwin, C.

====Thomas Henry Huxley====
[[File:ThomasHenryHuxley.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Thomas Henry Huxley]]]]
Agnostic views are as old as [[philosophical skepticism]], but the terms agnostic and agnosticism were created by [[Thomas Henry Huxley|Huxley]] (1825-1895) to sum up his thoughts on contemporary developments of metaphysics about the "unconditioned" ([[Sir William Hamilton, 9th Baronet|William Hamilton]]) and the "unknowable" ([[Herbert Spencer]]). Though Huxley began to use the term "agnostic" in 1869, his opinions had taken shape some time before that date. In a letter of September 23, 1860, to [[Charles Kingsley]], Huxley discussed his views extensively:&lt;ref name="Huxley1997"&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas Henry Huxley|authorlink=Thomas Henry Huxley|title=The Major Prose of Thomas Henry Huxley|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OAdUIXC32GkC&amp;pg=PA357|year=1997|publisher=University of Georgia Press|isbn=978-0-8203-1864-6|pages=357–}}

{{quote|I neither affirm nor deny the immortality of man. I see no reason for believing it, but, on the other hand, I have no means of disproving it. I have no ''a priori'' objections to the doctrine. No man who has to deal daily and hourly with nature can trouble himself about ''a priori'' difficulties. Give me such evidence as would justify me in believing in anything else, and I will believe that. Why should I not? It is not half so wonderful as the conservation of force or the indestructibility of matter&amp;nbsp;...

It is no use to talk to me of analogies and probabilities. I know what I mean when I say I believe in the law of the inverse squares, and I will not rest my life and my hopes upon weaker convictions&amp;nbsp;...

That my personality is the surest thing I know may be true. But the attempt to conceive what it is leads me into mere verbal subtleties. I have champed up all that chaff about the ego and the non-ego, noumena and phenomena, and all the rest of it, too often not to know that in attempting even to think of these questions, the human intellect flounders at once out of its depth.}}

And again, to the same correspondent, May 6, 1863:&lt;ref name="HuxleyHuxley2011"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Leonard Huxley|author2=Thomas Henry Huxley|title=Life and Letters of Thomas Henry Huxley|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-azeZXAf6MMC&amp;pg=PA347|date=December 22, 2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-108-04045-7|pages=347–}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|I have never had the least sympathy with the ''a priori'' reasons against orthodoxy, and I have by nature and disposition the greatest possible antipathy to all the atheistic and infidel school. Nevertheless I know that I am, in spite of myself, exactly what the Christian would call, and, so far as I can see, is justified in calling, atheist and infidel. I cannot see one shadow or tittle of evidence that the great unknown underlying the phenomenon of the universe stands to us in the relation of a Father [who] loves us and cares for us as Christianity asserts. So with regard to the other great Christian dogmas, immortality of soul and future state of rewards and punishments, what possible objection can I—who am compelled perforce to believe in the immortality of what we call Matter and Force, and in a very unmistakable present state of rewards and punishments for our deeds—have to these doctrines? Give me a scintilla of evidence, and I am ready to jump at them.}}

Of the origin of the name agnostic to describe this attitude, Huxley gave the following account:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Collected Essays, Vol. V: Science and Christian Tradition| first=Thomas| last=Huxley| isbn= 1-85506-922-9| publisher=Macmillan and Co 1893| pages=237–239}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|When I reached intellectual maturity and began to ask myself whether I was an atheist, a theist, or a pantheist; a materialist or an idealist; Christian or a freethinker; I found that the more I learned and reflected, the less ready was the answer; until, at last, I came to the conclusion that I had neither art nor part with any of these denominations, except the last. The one thing in which most of these good people were agreed was the one thing in which I differed from them. They were quite sure they had attained a certain "gnosis"–had, more or less successfully, solved the problem of existence; while I was quite sure I had not, and had a pretty strong conviction that the problem was insoluble. And, with Hume and Kant on my side, I could not think myself presumptuous in holding fast by that opinion&amp;nbsp;...

So I took thought, and invented what I conceived to be the appropriate title of "agnostic". It came into my head as suggestively antithetic to the "gnostic" of Church history, who professed to know so much about the very things of which I was ignorant.&amp;nbsp;... To my great satisfaction the term took.}}

In 1889, Huxley wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;Therefore, although it be, as I believe, demonstrable that we have no real knowledge of the authorship, or of the date of composition of the Gospels, as they have come down to us, and that nothing better than more or less probable guesses can be arrived at on that subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Huxley|first=Thomas Henry|authorlink=Thomas Henry Huxley|title=Essays Upon Some Controverted Questions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_b7aAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA364|year=1892|publisher=Macmillan|page=364|chapter=Agnosticism And Christianity|quote=Agnosticism And Christianity: Therefore, although it be, as I believe, demonstrable that we have no real knowledge of the authorship, or of the date of composition of the Gospels, as they have come down to us, and that nothing better than more or less probable guesses can be arrived at on that subject.

====William Stewart Ross====
[[William Stewart Ross]] (1844-1906) wrote under the name of Saladin.  He was associated with Victorian Freethinkers and the organization the British Secular Union. He edited the ''[[Secular Review]]'' from 1882; it was renamed ''Agnostic Journal and Eclectic Review'' and closed in 1907. Ross championed agnosticism in opposition to the atheism of [[Charles Bradlaugh]] as an open-ended spiritual exploration.&lt;ref&gt;Alastair Bonnett 'The Agnostic Saladin' ''History Today'', 2013, 63,2, pp.&amp;nbsp;47–52
&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Why I am an Agnostic'' (c. 1889) he claims that agnosticism is "the very reverse of atheism".&lt;ref name="RossTaylor1889"&gt;{{cite book|author1=William Stewart Ross|author2=Joseph Taylor|title=Why I Am an Agnostic: Being a Manual of Agnosticism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nGNEmgEACAAJ|year=1889|publisher=W.

====Bertrand Russell====
[[File:Russell1907-2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Bertrand Russell]]]]

In 1939, Russell gave a lecture on ''The existence and nature of God'', in which he characterized himself as an atheist. He said:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Russell| first= Bertrand| title=Collected Papers, Vol 10|page=255}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|The existence and nature of God is a subject of which I can discuss only half. If one arrives at a negative conclusion concerning the first part of the question, the second part of the question does not arise; and my position, as you may have gathered, is a negative one on this matter.}}

However, later in the same lecture, discussing modern non-anthropomorphic concepts of God, Russell states:&lt;ref&gt;''Collected Papers, Vol. 10'', p.258&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|That sort of God is, I think, not one that can actually be disproved, as I think the omnipotent and benevolent creator can.}}

In Russell's 1947 pamphlet, ''Am I An Atheist or an Agnostic?'' (subtitled ''A Plea For Tolerance in the Face of New Dogmas''), he ruminates on the problem of what to call himself:&lt;ref name="Ewell2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ken Ewell|title=Traveling with Philosophes|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jYgDxc90buUC&amp;pg=PA348|date=August 27, 2006|publisher=iUniverse|isbn=978-0-595-85361-8|pages=348–}}

{{quote|As a philosopher, if I were speaking to a purely philosophic audience I should say that I ought to describe myself as an Agnostic, because I do not think that there is a conclusive argument by which one can prove that there is not a God. On the other hand, if I am to convey the right impression to the ordinary man in the street I think I ought to say that I am an Atheist, because when I say that I cannot prove that there is not a God, I ought to add equally that I cannot prove that there are not the Homeric gods.}}

In his 1953 essay, ''What Is An Agnostic?'' Russell states:&lt;ref name="Russell2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bertrand Russell|title=The Basic Writings of Bertrand Russell|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Lm58AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA557|date=March 2, 2009|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-02867-2|pages=557–}}

{{quote|An agnostic thinks it impossible to know the truth in matters such as God and the future life with which Christianity and other religions are concerned. Or, if not impossible, at least impossible at the present time.

Are Agnostics Atheists?

No. An atheist, like a Christian, holds that we can know whether or not there is a God. The Christian holds that we can know there is a God; the atheist, that we can know there is not. The Agnostic suspends judgment, saying that there are not sufficient grounds either for affirmation or for denial.}}

Later in the essay, Russell adds:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scepsis.net/eng/articles/id_5.php |title='What Is an agnostic?' by Bertrand Russell |publisher=Scepsis.net |accessdate=February 2, 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6N57z5djS?url=http://scepsis.net/eng/articles/id_5.php |archivedate=February 2, 2014 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|I think that if I heard a voice from the sky predicting all that was going to happen to me during the next twenty-four hours, including events that would have seemed highly improbable, and if all these events then produced to happen, I might perhaps be convinced at least of the existence of some superhuman intelligence.}}

In 1965 Christian theologian [[Leslie Weatherhead]] (1893–1976) published ''The Christian Agnostic'', in which he argues:&lt;ref name="Smith2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Weatherhead1990"&gt;{{cite book|last=Weatherhead |first=Leslie D.|title=The Christian Agnostic|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-ZODJwAACAAJ|date=September 1990|publisher=Abingdon Press|isbn=978-0-687-06980-4}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|...&amp;nbsp;many professing agnostics are nearer belief in the true God than are many conventional church-goers who believe in a body that does not exist whom they miscall God.}}

Although radical and unpalatable to conventional theologians, Weatherhead's ''agnosticism'' falls far short of Huxley's, and short even of ''weak agnosticism'':&lt;ref name="Smith2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Weatherhead1990" /&gt;

[[Robert G.

In an 1896 lecture titled ''Why I Am An Agnostic'', Ingersoll related why he was an agnostic:&lt;ref name="infidels1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://infidels.org/library/historical/robert_ingersoll/why_i_am_agnostic.html |title=Why I Am Agnostic|publisher=Infidels.org |accessdate=February 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Is there a supernatural power—an arbitrary mind—an enthroned God—a supreme will that sways the tides and currents of the world—to which all causes bow? I do not deny. I do not know—but I do not believe. I believe that the natural is supreme—that from the infinite chain no link can be lost or broken—that there is no supernatural power that can answer prayer—no power that worship can persuade or change—no power that cares for man.

I believe that with infinite arms Nature embraces the all—that there is no interference—no chance—that behind every event are the necessary and countless causes, and that beyond every event will be and must be the necessary and countless effects.

Is there a God? I do not know. Is man immortal? I do not know. One thing I do know, and that is, that neither hope, nor fear, belief, nor denial, can change the fact. It is as it is, and it will be as it must be.}}

In the conclusion of the speech he simply sums up the agnostic position as:&lt;ref name="infidels1"/&gt;
{{quote|We can be as honest as we are ignorant. If we are, when asked what is beyond the horizon of the known, we must say that we do not know.}}

In 1885 Ingersoll explained his comparative view of agnosticism and atheism as follows: &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jacoby |first=Susan |date=2013 |title=The Great Agnostic |location= |publisher=Yale University Press |page =17 | isbn=978-0-300-13725-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Agnosticism is criticized from a variety of standpoints. Some religious thinkers see agnosticism as limiting the mind's capacity to know reality to [[materialism]]. Some atheists criticize the use of the term agnosticism as functionally indistinguishable from atheism; this results in frequent criticisms of those who adopt the term as avoiding the atheist label.&lt;ref name="EB-Agnosticism"/&gt;

===Theistic===
Theistic critics claim that agnosticism is impossible in practice, since a person can live only either as if God did not exist (''etsi deus non-daretur''), or as if God did exist (''etsi deus daretur'').&lt;ref name=SM&gt;

Religious scholars such as Laurence B. Brown criticize the misuse of the word agnosticism, claiming that it has become one of the most misapplied terms in metaphysics. Brown raises the question, "You claim that nothing can be known with certainty ... how, then, can you be so sure?"&lt;ref name=Islamrel&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.islamreligion.com/articles/641/ |title=Religion of Islam: Agnosticism |author=Laurence B.

====Christian====
According to [[Pope Benedict XVI]], strong agnosticism in particular contradicts itself in affirming the power of reason to know scientific [[truth]].&lt;ref name=YOJC/&gt;&lt;ref name=TT/&gt; He blames the exclusion of reasoning from religion and ethics for dangerous pathologies such as crimes against humanity and ecological disasters.&lt;ref name=YOJC&gt;{{cite book| title=The Yes of Jesus Christ: Spiritual Exercises in Faith, Hope, and Love| first=Joseph| last=Ratzinger|publisher=Cross Roads Publishing|year=2005}}

"Agnosticism", said Ratzinger, "is always the fruit of a refusal of that knowledge which is in fact offered to man&amp;nbsp;... The knowledge of God has always existed".&lt;ref name=TT/&gt; He asserted that agnosticism is a choice of comfort, pride, dominion, and utility over truth, and is opposed by the following attitudes: the keenest self-criticism, humble listening to the whole of existence, the persistent patience and self-correction of the [[scientific method]], a readiness to be purified by the truth.&lt;ref name=YOJC/&gt;

The [[Catholic Church]] sees merit in examining what it calls "partial agnosticism", specifically those systems that "do not aim at constructing a complete philosophy of the unknowable, but at excluding special kinds of truth, notably religious, from the domain of knowledge".&lt;ref name="CEnc1"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia

&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Church is historically opposed to a full denial of the capacity of human reason to know God. The [[Council of the Vatican]] declares, "God, the beginning and end of all, can, by the natural light of human reason, be known with certainty from the works of creation".&lt;ref name="CEnc1"/&gt;

[[Blaise Pascal]] argued that even if there were truly no evidence for God, agnostics should consider what is now known as [[Pascal's Wager]]: the [[Infinity|infinite]] expected value of acknowledging God is always greater than the finite expected value of not acknowledging his existence, and thus it is a safer "bet" to choose God.&lt;ref name=PKPW&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.peterkreeft.com/topics/pascals-wager.htm| title=Argument from Pascal's Wager| year=2007 | accessdate=May 25, 2008| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080605044148/http://peterkreeft.com/topics/pascals-wager.htm| archivedate=June 5, 2008 | deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Atheistic===
According to [[Richard Dawkins]], a distinction between agnosticism and atheism is unwieldy and depends on how close to zero a person is willing to rate the probability of existence for any given god-like entity. About himself, Dawkins continues, "I am agnostic only to the extent that I am agnostic about fairies at the bottom of the garden."&lt;ref&gt;''[[The God Delusion]]'' (2006), Bantam Press, p.&amp;nbsp;51&lt;/ref&gt; Dawkins also identifies two categories of agnostics; "Temporary Agnostics in Practice" (TAPs), and "Permanent Agnostics in Principle" (PAPs). He states that "agnosticism about the existence of God belongs firmly in the temporary or TAP category. Either he exists or he doesn't. It is a scientific question; one day we may know the answer, and meanwhile we can say something pretty strong about the probability.", and considers PAP a "deeply inescapable kind of fence-sitting".&lt;ref&gt;''[[The God Delusion]]'' (2006), Bantam Press, pp&amp;nbsp;47-48&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related concepts==
[[Ignosticism]] is the view that a coherent definition of a deity must be put forward before the question of the existence of a deity can be meaningfully discussed. If the chosen definition is not coherent, the ignostic holds the [[theological noncognitivism|noncognitivist]] view that the existence of a deity is meaningless or empirically untestable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.strongatheism.net/library/atheology/argument_from_noncognitivism/ |title=The Argument From Non-Cognitivism |accessdate=October 1, 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6N59bmP1Y?url=http://www.strongatheism.net/library/atheology/argument_from_noncognitivism/ |archivedate=February 2, 2014 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alfred Ayer|A.&amp;nbsp;J. Ayer]], [[Theodore Drange]], and other philosophers see both atheism and agnosticism as incompatible with ignosticism on the grounds that atheism and agnosticism accept "a deity exists" as a meaningful proposition that can be argued for or against.&lt;ref&gt;Ayer, ''Language'', 115: "There can be no way of proving that the existence of a God&amp;nbsp;... is even probable.&amp;nbsp;... For if the existence of such a god were probable, then the proposition that he existed would be an empirical hypothesis. And in that case it would be possible to deduce from it, and other empirical hypotheses, certain experimental propositions which were not deducible from those other hypotheses alone. But in fact this is not possible."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Drange"&gt;Drange, ''Atheism''&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=March 2017}}
'''Analytical jurisprudence''' is a theory of [[jurisprudence]] that draws on the resources of modern [[analytical philosophy]] to try to understand the nature of law. Since the boundaries of analytical philosophy are somewhat vague, it is difficult to say how far it extends.  [[H. L. A. Hart]] was probably the most influential writer in the modern school of analytical jurisprudence,&lt;ref&gt;Bodenheimer, Edgar, [http://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=7496&amp;context=penn_law_review Modern Analytical Jurisprudence and the Limits of Its Usefulness], [[University of Pennsylvania Law Review]]&lt;/ref&gt; though its history goes back at least to [[Jeremy Bentham]].

Analytical jurisprudence is not to be mistaken for [[legal formalism]] (the idea that legal reasoning is or can be modelled as a mechanical, algorithmic process). Indeed, it was the analytical jurists who first pointed out that legal formalism is fundamentally mistaken as a theory of law.

Analytic, or 'clarificatory' jurisprudence uses a neutral point of view and descriptive language when referring to the aspects of legal systems. This was a philosophical development that rejected [[natural law]]'s fusing of what law is and what it ought to be. [[David Hume]] famously argued in ''[[A Treatise of Human Nature]]'' that people invariably slip between describing that the world is a certain way to saying therefore we ought to conclude on a particular course of action. But as a matter of pure logic, one cannot conclude that we ought to do something merely because something is the case. So analysing and clarifying the way the world is, must be treated as a strictly separate question to normative and evaluative [[is–ought problem|ought questions]].

The most important questions of analytic jurisprudence are: "[[Definition of law|What are laws]]?"; "What is the law?"; "What is the relationship between law and [[power (social and political)|power]]?"; and, "What is the relationship between law and [[morality]]?" [[Legal positivism]] is the dominant theory, although there are a growing number of critics, who offer their own interpretations.

[[Springer books]] commissioned essays on analytical jurisprudence for ''A Treatise on Legal Philosophy and General Jurisprudence''. {{ISBN|9781402033872}}

The '''Armed Forces Radiobiology Research Institute''' (AFRRI) is a triservice laboratory in [[Bethesda, Maryland]], USA, and was chartered by the [[U.S. Congress]] in 1961. It conducts research in the field of [[radiobiology]] and related matters which are essential to the operational and medical support of the [[U.S. Department of Defense]] (DoD) and the U.S. military services. AFRRI provides services and performs cooperative research with other federal and civilian agencies and institutions. 
  
==Organization==
AFRRI is a joint entity of the military departments and is subject to the authority and direction of the president of the [[Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences]] (USU), under the assistant secretary of defense for health affairs and the under secretary of defense for personnel and readiness.

==Program==
AFRRI is charged with executing DoD's [[Medical Radiological Defense Research Program]]. Its civilian and active duty military personnel conduct exploratory and developmental research to identify and develop medical countermeasures against [[ionizing radiation]]. Core areas of study include prevention, assessment, and treatment of radiological injuries. The program seeks to develop prophylactic and therapeutic drugs, such as [[Ex-Rad]], that prevent and treat [[radiation]] injuries and to develop rapid high-precision analytical methods that assess [[radiation]] exposure doses from clinical samples and thus aid in the triage and medical management of radiological casualties. New drug candidates and biological dose assessment technologies are developed up to and through preclinical testing and evaluation.

==Responsibilities==
*Operate research facilities for and disseminate results from the study of [[radiobiology]] and [[ionizing radiation]] bioeffects and the development of medical countermeasures against ionizing radiation. 
*Provide analysis, study, and consultation on the impact of the biological effects of ionizing radiation on the organizational efficiency of the U.S. military services and their members. 
*Conduct cooperative research with military medical departments in those aspects of military and operational and medical support considerations related to nuclear weapons effects and the radiobiological hazards of space operations. 
*Conduct advanced training in the field of [[radiobiology]] and the biological effects of nuclear and radiobiological weapons to meet the internal requirements of AFRRI, the military services, and other DoD components and organizations. 
*Participate in cooperative research and other enterprises, consistent with the AFRRI mission and applicable authorities, with other federal agencies involved in homeland security and emergency medical preparedness.

==Awards==
AFRRI was awarded the [[Meritorious Unit Commendation]] in 2004.

'''Bathroom reading''' is the act of [[Reading (process)|reading]] text while in a [[bathroom]], usually while sitting on the [[toilet]] and [[Defecation|defecating]]. The practice has been common throughout history and remains widespread today with both printed material and [[smartphone]]s.

==History==
Bathroom reading has been commonplace throughout history. [[Ancient Rome|Ancient Roman]] [[Thermae|bath houses]] often contained libraries with scrolls for reading.&lt;ref name="Alford"&gt;{{Cite newspaper
| url          = https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/23/books/review/23alford.html

| url          = https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/WolfFiles/story?id=91568&amp;page=1

The advent of the [[smartphone]] is believed to have significantly increased bathroom reading. A 2009 study conducted in Israel found that a majority of adults read from their smartphones on the toilet, and a 2015 study conducted by [[Verizon]] found that 90% of cell phone users admitted to reading from their phones while on the toilet.&lt;ref name="Time"&gt;{{cite web

==Bathroom reading and literature==
The term "bathroom reading" refers to any literary material deemed suitable for casual or light reading. In 2011, the Canadian author [[Margaret Atwood]] wrote:

{{quote|Bathroom reading is a certain kind of reading—episodic, but encouraging first thing in the morning. Sometimes the readers there prefer to read the newspaper, but when that's not available, they resort to their hand phones. The hand phone has a huge contributor in the rise of bathroom pollution.

The bathroom is a place where you can go in and pretend to be doing one thing while actually you're reading. Nobody can interrupt you. Compendiums of this and that are very useful for bathroom reading: small reading packages within a larger book. You wouldn't want to read ''[[War and Peace]]'' in there. You'd never come out. They'd probably call the police and get the door broken down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

| deadurl      = no}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Pulp magazine]]s were associated with bathroom reading, which the film ''[[Pulp Fiction]]'' references in repeated scenes of [[John Travolta]]'s character Vincent Vega reading the pulpy [[spy fiction|spy]] novel ''[[Modesty Blaise (novel)|Modesty Blaise]]'' while sat on a toilet.&lt;ref name=screenprism&gt;{{cite web

| website      = ScreenPrism
| date         = September 8, 2015
| accessdate   = September 4, 2018
| deadurl      = no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bathroom reading also refers to a [[Literary genre|genre]] of books containing [[Humour|humor]] and [[trivia]], such as the ''[[Uncle John's Bathroom Reader]]'' series.&lt;ref name=screenprism/&gt;

In [[James Joyce]]'s novel ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'', the protagonist [[Leopold Bloom]] reads a magazine on the toilet and then wipes himself with it.&lt;ref name="Time" /&gt;

==Sanitation, hygiene and health== 
According to a professor at the [[Columbia University Medical Center]], reading in the bathroom can potentially facilitate [[Transmission (medicine)|the spread of disease]] if [[Airborne disease|airborne]] [[bacteria]] land on reading material and are transmitted to the reader; however, the activity is not a significant health concern as long as the reading environment is [[Sanitation|sanitary]], the reader does not have a [[Immunodeficiency|compromised immune system]], and the reader practices ordinary [[hygiene]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url          = http://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/2012/09/24/is-your-bathroom-reading-making-sick.html

| date         = September 24, 2012
| accessdate   = September 4, 2018
| deadurl      = no}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A [[University of Arizona]] [[microbiologist]] who researched the topic in 2002 found that bathroom reading at the workplace was not a significant hygiene risk, noting that paper is a relatively unattractive environment for bacteria and that [[desk]] areas often have more bacteria than bathrooms because they are cleaned less frequently.&lt;ref name="Wolf" /&gt;

Although time spent on the toilet can increase the incidence of [[hemorrhoid]]s, a 2009 study found that bathroom readers were not more likely than non-bathroom readers to have hemorrhoids.&lt;ref name="Time" /&gt;

==Bathroom reading and psychology==
Even when people read for extended periods of time during defecation, it is rare for bathroom readers to feel [[disgust]]ed by the smell of their own [[human feces|feces]], or even to consciously notice the smell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url          = https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/perception-and-performance/201707/bathroom-reading

The [[Psychoanalysis|psychoanalyst]] [[Otto Fenichel]] believed bathroom reading was an indication of [[early childhood trauma]]. He wrote that the activity is "an attempt to preserve the equilibrium of [[Id, ego and super-ego|the ego]]; part of one's bodily substance is being lost and so fresh matter must be absorbed through the eyes."&lt;ref name="Time" /&gt; [[James Strachey]], who translated Freud's works into English, similarly noted that the activity of casual reading while defecating was essentially "infantile" behavior.&lt;ref name="Time" /&gt;

[[DiMassimo Goldstein|DiMassimo Brand Advertising]] once tested [[Campaign advertising|political advertising]] in bathrooms by placing various messages about [[George W. Bush]] and [[Al Gore]] in New York City public restrooms. The company's study found that 62 percent of people "remembered the exact message" of bathroom ads, compared to 16 percent for [[billboard]] advertisements.&lt;ref name="Wolf" /&gt;&lt;!--

'''Biostrophin''' is a drug which may serve as a vehicle for [[gene therapy]], in the treatment of [[Duchenne muscular dystrophy|Duchenne]] and [[Becker's muscular dystrophy|Becker]] [[muscular dystrophy]].&lt;ref name=bdb&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=16391721 |date=Oct 2005 |vauthors=Khurdayan VK, Bozzo J, Prous JR |title=Chronicles in drug discovery |volume=18 |issue=8 |pages=517–522 |issn=0214-0934 |journal=Drug news &amp; perspectives |doi=10.1358/dnp.2005.18.8.953409}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As [[mutation]]s in the [[gene]] which codes for the protein [[dystrophin]] is the underlying defect responsible for both 
disorders, biostrophin will deliver a genetically-engineered, functional copy of the gene at the [[molecule|molecular]] level to affected muscle cells.&lt;ref name=bdb/&gt; Dosage, as well as a viable means for systemic release of the drug in patients, is currently being investigated with the use of both [[Canidae|canine]] and [[primate]] [[animal model]]s.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ncbiotech.org/news_and_events/industry_news/duchenne.html Dec 2006 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017190839/http://www.ncbiotech.org/news_and_events/industry_news/duchenne.html |date=October 17, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biostrophin is being manufactured by Asklepios BioPharmaceuticals, Inc., with funding provided by the [[Muscular Dystrophy Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20060928005134/en/Asklepios-Biopharmaceutical-Announces-Cross-License-GlaxoSmithKline|title=Asklepios Biopharmaceutical, Inc.

The main bodies were hewn directly from the [[sandstone]] cliffs, but details were modeled in mud mixed with straw, coated with [[stucco]].

The lower parts of the statues' arms were constructed from the same mud-straw mix supported on wooden armatures. It is believed that the upper parts of their faces were made from great wooden masks or casts. The rows of holes that can be seen in photographs held wooden pegs that stabilized the outer stucco.

Bamiyan lies on the [[Silk Road]], which runs through the [[Hindu Kush]] mountain region, in the Bamiyan Valley. The Silk Road has been historically a caravan route linking the markets of China with those of the Western world. It was the site of several [[Buddhist monasteries]], and a thriving center for religion, philosophy, and art. Monks at the monasteries lived as [[hermit]]s in small caves carved into the side of the Bamiyan cliffs. Most of these monks embellished their caves with religious statuary and elaborate, brightly colored [[fresco]]es. It was a Buddhist religious site from the 2nd century up to the time of the [[Islam]]ic invasion in the later half of the 7th century. Until it was completely conquered by the [[Muslim]] [[Saffarids]] in the 9th century, Bamiyan shared the culture of [[Gandhara]].

[[File:Taller Buddha of Bamiyan before and after destruction.jpg|thumb|right|Taller Buddha in 1963 and in 2008 after destruction]]

The two most prominent statues were the giant standing sculptures of Buddhas [[Vairocana]] and [[Sakyamuni]], identified by the different [[mudras]] performed. The Buddha popularly called "Solsol" measured 53 meters tall, and "Shahmama" 35 meters—the niches in which the figures stood are 58 and 38 meters respectively from bottom to top.&lt;ref name="state"&gt;Research of state and stability of the rock niches of the Buddhas of Bamiyan in [http://www.unibw.de/bauv5/forschung/abgeschlossene_forschungsvorhaben/buddha "Completed Research Results of Military University of Munich"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304032715/http://www.unibw.de/bauv5/forschung/abgeschlossene_forschungsvorhaben/buddha |date=4 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cipa.icomos.org/fileadmin/template/doc/antalya/120.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131216070456/http://cipa.icomos.org/fileadmin/template/doc/antalya/120.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=16 December 2013 |title=Computer Reconstruction and Modeling of the Great Buddha Statue in Bamiyan, Afghanistan |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=9 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Before being blown up in 2001 they were the largest examples of standing Buddha carvings in the world (the 8th century [[Leshan Giant Buddha]] is taller,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=UNESCO World Heritage Centre |url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/779 |title=Mount Emei Scenic Area, including Leshan Giant Buddha Scenic Area |publisher=Whc.unesco.org |date= |accessdate=9 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; but that statue is sitting). Since then the [[Statue of unity]] has been built in India, and at {{convert|182|m|ft|abbr=on}} it is the [[tallest statue]] in the world, breaking the record earlier held by The [[Spring Temple Buddha]]  {{convert|128|m|ft|abbr=on}} in Fodushan Scenic Area, Lushan County, Henan, China. Plans for the construction of the Spring Temple Buddha were announced soon after the blowing up of the Bamiyan Buddhas and China condemned the systematic destruction of the Buddhist heritage of Afghanistan.

[[File:BamyanBuddha Smaller 1.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Smaller Buddha in 1977]]

It is believed that the monumental Buddha sculptures were carved into the cliffs of Bamiyan between the 3rd to 6th centuries AD, while the cave complex in the east, including the 38 meter Buddha, a stupa was built in the 3rd or 4th centuries AD. The 55 meter Buddha is believed to date from the 5th and 6th centuries AD. Historic documentation refers to celebrations held every year attracting numerous pilgrims and that offers were made to the monumental statues (http://whc.unesco.org/uploads/nominations/208rev.pdf). They were perhaps the most famous cultural landmarks of the region, and the site was listed by [[UNESCO]] as a [[World Heritage Site]] along with the surrounding cultural landscape and archaeological remains of the Bamiyan Valley. Their color faded through time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/02/110225122816.htm |title=Bamiyan Buddhas Once Glowed in Red, White and Blue |publisher=Sciencedaily.com |date=25 February 2011 |accessdate=9 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chinese Buddhist pilgrim [[Xuanzang]] visited the site on 30 April 630 AD,&lt;ref&gt;Yamada, Meiji (2002). [https://web.archive.org/web/20100707012445/http://www.shin-ibs.edu/documents/pwj3-4/07YM4.pdf Buddhism of Bamiyan], Pacific World, 3rd series 4, 109-110&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://depts.washington.edu/silkroad/cities/afghanistan/bamiyan.html |title=Bamiyan and Buddhist Afghanistan |publisher=Depts.washington.edu |date= |accessdate=9 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="laputanlogic"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.laputanlogic.com/articles/2003/09/21-106424100165818095.html |title=Xuan Zang and the Third Buddha |publisher=Laputanlogic.com |date=9 March 2007 |accessdate=9 October 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130127095257/http://www.laputanlogic.com/articles/2003/09/21-106424100165818095.html |archivedate=27 January 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and described Bamiyan in the ''[[Great Tang Records on the Western Regions|Da Tang Xiyu Ji]]'' as a flourishing Buddhist center "with more than ten monasteries and more than a thousand monks". He also noted that both Buddha figures were "decorated with gold and fine jewels" (Wriggins, 1995). Intriguingly, Xuanzang mentions a third, even larger, reclining statue of the Buddha.&lt;ref name="gall1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="laputanlogic"/&gt; A monumental seated Buddha, similar in style to those at Bamiyan, still exists in the [[Bingling Temple]] caves in China's [[Gansu]] province.

The destruction of the Bamyan Buddhas became a symbol of oppression and a rallying point for the freedom of religious expression. Despite the fact that most Afghans are now Muslim, they too had embraced their past and many were appalled by the destruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hazaristantimes.wordpress.com/2009/06/04/bamyan-series/ |title=Buddhas of Bamiyan |publisher=Hazaristantimes.wordpress.com |date= |accessdate=9 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=TIM MCGIRK/Bamiyan |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,238674,00.html |title=What Lies Beneath |publisher=Time.com |date=20 May 2002 |accessdate=9 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Attacks on the Buddha's statue===

====11th to the 20th century====
In 1221, with the advent of [[Genghis Khan]], "a terrible disaster befell Bamiyan."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://depts.washington.edu/silkroad/cities/afghanistan/bamiyan.html |title=Bamiyan and Buddhism Afghanistan |publisher=Depts.washington.edu |date= |accessdate=9 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kashgar.com.au/articles/Remembering-Bamiyan |title=Remembering Bamiyan |publisher=Kashgar.com.au |date= |accessdate=9 October 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004201837/http://www.kashgar.com.au/articles/Remembering-Bamiyan |archivedate=4 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the statues were spared. Later, the Mughal emperor, [[Aurangzeb]], tried to use heavy artillery to destroy the statues. Another attempt to destroy the Bamiyan statues was made by the 18th century Persian king [[Nader Shah|Nader Afshar]], directing cannon fire at them.&lt;ref&gt;''Asian Art'', chap. "History of attacks on the Buddhas"&lt;/ref&gt;

The enormous statues, the male Salsal ("light shines through the universe") and the (smaller) female Shamama ("Queen Mother"),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christian-frei.info/dvd/christian_frei-booklet_en.pdf |title=booklet web E.indd |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=9 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; as they were called by the locals, did not fail to fire the imagination of Islamic writers in centuries past. The larger statue reappears as the malevolent giant Salsal in medieval Turkish tales.&lt;ref&gt;Laban Kaptein, ''Eindtijd en Antichrist'', p. 127. Leiden 1997. {{ISBN|90-73782-89-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Afghan king [[Abdur Rahman Khan]] destroyed its face during a military campaign against the Shia Hazara rebellion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=54808 |title=Ancient Buddhas Will Not Be Rebuilt – UNESCO |publisher=Ipsnews.net |date= |accessdate=9 October 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110913032140/http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=54808 |archivedate=13 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; A Frenchman named Dureau had photographed it in 1847.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.idb.arch.ethz.ch/files/04_ag-remondino_zhang_photogr.record.pdf |title=Photogrammetric Reconstruction of the Great Buddha of Bamiyan |access-date=27 September 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150824114215/http://www.idb.arch.ethz.ch/files/04_ag-remondino_zhang_photogr.record.pdf |archive-date=24 August 2015 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====1997 to 2001, under the Taliban====
Abdul Wahed, a Taliban commander operating around the area, announced his intention to blow up the Buddhas in 1997, even before he had taken control of the valley. In 1998 when he battled off the [[Hizb-i-Wahdat]] militia from the area and took control of Bamiyan, Wahed drilled holes in the Buddhas' heads for explosives. He was prevented from taking further action by the local governor and a direct order of [[Mohammed Omar]], although tires were later burned on the head of the great Buddha.&lt;ref&gt;Semple, Michael [http://aan-afghanistan.com/index.asp?id=1538 ''Why the Buddhas of Bamian were destroyed''], [[Afghanistan Analysts Network]] 2 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1999, Mullah Mohammed Omar issued a decree in favor of the preservation of the Bamiyan Buddha statues. Because Afghanistan's Buddhist population no longer exists, and the statues were no longer worshipped, he added: "The government considers the Bamiyan statues as an example of a potential major source of income for Afghanistan from international visitors. The Taliban states that Bamiyan shall not be destroyed but protected."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last = Harding| first = Luke| date = 3 March 2001| title = How the Buddha got his wounds| publisher = The Guardian| url = https://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/mar/03/books.guardianreview2| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060228113747/http://www.guardian.co.uk/Archive/Article/0%2C4273%2C4145138%2C00.html| archivedate = 28 February 2006| accessdate = 23 March 2008| location = London| deadurl = yes| df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early 2000, local Taliban authorities asked for UN assistance to rebuild drainage ditches around tops of the alcoves where the Buddhas were set.&lt;ref&gt;Semple, Michael [http://aan-afghanistan.com/index.asp?id=1538 Why the Buddhas of Bamian were destroyed], [[Afghanistan Analysts Network]] 2 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Afghanistan's radical clerics began a campaign to crack down on "un-Islamic" segments of Afghan society. The Taliban soon banned all forms of imagery, music, and sports, including television, in accordance with what they considered a strict interpretation of [[Sharia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The Destruction of Statues Displayed in an Islamic State| publisher = Ask-Imam.com| first = Moulana Imraan| last= Vawda |url = http://www.islam.tc/ask-imam/view.php?q=3436| accessdate = 6 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2001, the statues were destroyed by the Taliban of Mullah Omar following a decree issued by him. The Taliban supreme leader Mullah Omar explained why he ordered the statues to be destroyed in an interview:
{{quote|I did not want to destroy the Bamiyan Buddha. In fact, some foreigners came to me and said they would like to conduct the repair work of the Bamiyan Buddha that had been slightly damaged due to rains. This shocked me. I thought, these callous people have no regard for thousands of living human beings - the Afghans who are dying of hunger, but they are so concerned about non-living objects like the Buddha. This was extremely deplorable. That is why I ordered its destruction. Had they come for humanitarian work, I would have never ordered the Buddha's destruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Mohammad Shehzad |url=http://www.rediff.com/news/2004/apr/12inter.htm |title=The Rediff Interview/Mullah Omar|date=3 March 2001|work=The Rediff|accessdate=27 October 2010 | location=Kabul}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Information and Culture Minister Qadratullah Jamal told [[Associated Press]] of a decision by 400 religious clerics from across Afghanistan declaring the Buddhist statues against the tenets of Islam. "They came out with a consensus that the statues were against Islam," said Jamal.

According to UNESCO Director-General [[Koïchiro Matsuura]], a meeting of ambassadors from the 54 member states of the [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation|Organisation of the Islamic Conference]] (OIC) was conducted. All OIC states—including [[Pakistan]], [[Saudi Arabia]], and the [[United Arab Emirates]], three countries that officially recognised the Taliban government—joined the protest to spare the monuments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=3 March 2001| title = World appeals to Taliban to stop destroying statues| publisher = CNN| url = http://archives.cnn.com/2001/WORLD/asiapcf/central/03/03/afghan.buddhas.03/index.html| accessdate = 6 January 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071224155700/http://archives.cnn.com/2001/WORLD/asiapcf/central/03/03/afghan.buddhas.03/index.html |archivedate = 24 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saudi Arabia and the UAE later condemned the destruction as "savage".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=4 March 2001 |first=Barry |last=Bearak |title=Over World Protests, Taliban Are Destroying Ancient Buddhas |publisher=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/03/04/world/04AFGH.html?ex=1218686400&amp;en=f513bb4edae409e0&amp;ei=5070 |accessdate=13 July 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140302192951/http://www.nytimes.com/2001/03/04/world/04AFGH.html?ex=1218686400&amp;en=f513bb4edae409e0&amp;ei=5070 |archivedate=2 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although [[India]] never recognised the Taliban regime in Afghanistan, [[New Delhi]] offered to arrange for the transfer of all the artifacts in question to India, "where they would be kept safely and preserved for all mankind".

He asserted that the Chinese, Japanese, and Sri Lankan delegates were the most strident advocates for preserving the Buddhas. The Japanese in particular proposed a variety of different solutions to the issue, these included moving the statues to Japan, covering the statues from view, and the payment of money.&lt;ref name="Zaeef2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Abdul Salam Zaeef|title=My Life with the Taliban|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yXf1AQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA127&amp;ved=0CB4Q6AEwAGoVChMI9PSV4KTUxwIVRBk-Ch2rCAd6&amp;q=Another%20suggestion%20they%20had%20was%20that%20they%20cover%20the%20statues%20from%20head%20to%20toe%20in%20a%20way%20that%20no%20one%20would%20recognize%20they%20had%20ever%20been%20there%2C%20while%20preserving%20them%20underneath|date=7 January 2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-1-84904-152-2|pages=127–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |date=27 February 2010  |title=Japan offered to hide Bamiyan statues, but Taliban asked Japan to convert to Islam instead |url=http://www.japantoday.com/category/national/view/japan-offered-to-hide-bamiyan-statues-but-taliban-asked-japan-to-convert-to-islam-instead |newspaper=JAPANTODAY |location= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The second edition of the [[Turkistan Islamic Party]]'s magazine ''Islamic Turkistan'' contained an article on Buddhism, and described the destruction of the Buddhas of Bamiyan despite attempts by the Japanese government of "infidels" to preserve the remains of the statues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last=|first=|date=ذو القعدة 1429|title=الدبانا البوذية|url=https://azelin.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/e1b8a5izb-al-islc481mc4ab-al-turkistc481nc4abs-turkistan-islamic-party-22turkistc481n-al-islc481mc4abyyah-222.pdf|magazine=تركستان الإسلامية|location=|publisher=|issue=السنة الأولى: العدد الثاني|pages=46–49|access-date=|author=محمد ضياء الرحمن الأعظمي}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, the statues were fired at for several days using anti-aircraft guns and artillery. This caused severe damage, but did not obliterate them. During the destruction, Taliban Information Minister Qudratullah Jamal lamented that, "This work of destruction is not as simple as people might think. You can't knock down the statues by shelling as both are carved into a cliff; they are firmly attached to the mountain".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2001/WORLD/asiapcf/central/03/12/afghan.buddha.02/ |title=Photos document destruction of Afghan Buddhas |accessdate=2007-03-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070313235406/http://edition.cnn.com/2001/WORLD/asiapcf/central/03/12/afghan.buddha.02/ |archivedate=13 March 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the Taliban placed anti-tank mines at the bottom of the niches, so that when fragments of rock broke off from artillery fire, the statues would receive additional destruction from particles that set off the mines. In the end, the Taliban lowered men down the cliff face and placed explosives into holes in the Buddhas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2104119/entry/2104187|title=Destruction and Rebuilding of the Bamyan Buddhas |publisher=Slate Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; After one of the explosions failed to obliterate the face of one of the Buddhas, a rocket was launched that left a hole in the remains of the stone head.&lt;ref name="berg"&gt;Bergen, Peter.

On 6 March 2001, ''[[The Times]]'' quoted Mullah Mohammed Omar as stating, "Muslims should be proud of smashing idols. It has given praise to Allah that we have destroyed them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Markos Moulitsas Zúniga |coauthors= |title=American Taliban: How War, Sex, Sin, and Power Bind Jihadists and the Radical Right |year=2010 |publisher=Polipoint Press |quote= | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1Cdx6yTUFxIC&amp;pg=PA8&amp;lpg=PA8&amp;ots=Hl1nwYSxkK&amp;sig=rG9zIIyemmmJytx4C5aP6fpP8Js&amp;ei=D_niTJ6OK8SjnQfH6-zWDg&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CEoQ6AEwCA&amp;q=%22Muslims%20should%20be%20proud%20of%20smashing%20idols%22 |isbn=1-936227-02-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During a 13 March interview for Japan's [[Mainichi Shimbun]], Afghan Foreign Minister [[Wakil Ahmad Mutawakel]] stated that the destruction was anything but a retaliation against the international community for economic sanctions: "We are destroying the statues in accordance with Islamic law and it is purely a religious issue."

On 18 March 2001, ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that a Taliban envoy said the Islamic government made its decision in a rage after a foreign delegation offered money to preserve the ancient works. The report also added, however, that other reports "have said the religious leaders were debating the move for months, and ultimately decided that the statues were idolatrous and should be obliterated".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Crossette| first = Barbara|date=19 March 2001| title = Taliban Explains Buddha Demolition| publisher = The New York Times| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2001/03/19/world/19TALI.html?ex=1142571600&amp;en=e5ba6c267eada53a&amp;ei=5070| accessdate = 6 January 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090503215139/http://www.nytimes.com/2001/03/19/world/19TALI.html?ex=1142571600&amp;en=e5ba6c267eada53a&amp;ei=5070|archivedate=3 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Then Taliban [[ambassador-at-large]] [[Sayed Rahmatullah Hashemi]] said that the destruction of the statues was carried out by the Head Council of Scholars after a Swedish monuments expert proposed to restore the statues' heads. Hashimi is reported as saying: "When the Afghan head council asked them to provide the money to feed the children instead of fixing the statues, they refused and said, 'No, the money is just for the statues, not for the children'. Herein, they made the decision to destroy the statues"; however, he did not comment on the claim that a foreign museum offered to "buy the Buddhist statues, the money from which could have been used to feed children".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kassaimah |first=Sahar |date=12 January 2001 |title=Afghani Ambassador Speaks At USC |publisher=[[IslamOnline]] |url=http://www.islamonline.net/english/news/2001-03/13/article12.shtml |accessdate=6 January 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071008012138/http://www.islamonline.net/english/news/2001-03/13/article12.shtml |archivedate=8 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The destruction of the Bamiyan Buddhas despite protests from the international community has been described by Michael Falser, a heritage expert at the Center for Transcultural Studies in Germany, as an attack by the Taliban against the globalising concept of "cultural heritage".&lt;ref&gt;Falser, Michael. "The Bamiyan Buddhas, performative iconoclasm and the 'image' of heritage". In: Giometti, Simone; Tomaszewski, Andrzej (eds.): ''The Image of Heritage. Changing Perception, Permanent Responsibilities.'' Proceedings of the International Conference of the ICOMOS International Scientific Committee for the Theory and the Philosophy of Conservation and Restoration. 6–8 March 2009 Florence, Italy. Firenze 2011: 157-169.&lt;/ref&gt; The director general of the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) Koichiro Matsuura called the destruction a "...crime against culture. It is abominable to witness the cold and calculated destruction of cultural properties which were the heritage of the Afghan people, and, indeed, of the whole of humanity."&lt;ref&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/International/story?id=81406&amp;page=1#.UA4FSrQe5TI U.N.

==Commitment to rebuild==
{{BuddhasHolySites}}

Though the figures of the two large Buddhas have been destroyed, their outlines and some features are still recognizable within the recesses. It is also still possible for visitors to explore the monks' caves and passages that connect them. As part of the international effort to rebuild Afghanistan after the Taliban war, the [[Government of Japan|Japanese government]] and several other organizations—among them the Afghanistan Institute in [[Bubendorf]], Switzerland, along with the [[ETH]] in [[Zurich]]—have committed to rebuilding, perhaps by [[anastylosis]], the two larger Buddhas.

===Developments since 2002===
In April 2002, Afghanistan's post-Taliban leader [[Hamid Karzai]] called the destruction a "national tragedy" and pledged the Buddhas to be rebuilt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/asiapcf/central/04/09/gen.karzai.bamiyan/index.html|title=CNN.com - Karzai pledges to rebuild Afghan Buddhas - April  9, 2002|first=Staff and|last=wires|website=edition.cnn.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2005, [[Mawlawi Mohammed Islam Mohammadi]], Taliban governor of Bamiyan province at the time of the destruction and widely seen as responsible for its occurrence, was elected to the Afghan Parliament. He blamed the decision to destroy the Buddhas on [[Al-Qaeda]]'s influence on the Taliban.&lt;ref&gt;''Focus on Terrorism, Volume 8'' by Edward V. Linden&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2007, he was assassinated in Kabul.

Swiss filmmaker [[Christian Frei]] made a 95-minute documentary titled ''[[The Giant Buddhas]]'' (released in March 2006) on the statues, the international reactions to their destruction, and an overview of the controversy. Testimony by local Afghans validates that [[Osama Bin Laden|Osama bin Laden]] ordered the destruction and that, initially, Mullah Omar and the Afghans in Bamiyan opposed it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=28 March 2006 |title=Laden ordered Bamyan Buddha destruction |work=[[The Times of India]] |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/1466974.cms |accessdate=6 January 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080506154952/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/1466974.cms |archivedate=6 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A novel titled 'An Afghan Winter' provides a fictional backdrop to the destruction of the Buddhas and its impact on the global Buddhist community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/rajesh-talwar/afghan-winter/|title=AN AFGHAN WINTER by Rajesh Talwar - Kirkus Reviews|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2002, international funding has supported recovery and stabilization efforts at the site. Fragments of the statues are documented and stored with special attention given to securing the structure of the statue still in place. It is hoped that, in the future, partial [[anastylosis]] can be conducted with the remaining fragments. In 2009, [[ICOMOS]] constructed scaffolding within the niche to further conservation and stabilization. Nonetheless, several serious conservation and safety issues exist and the Buddhas are still listed as [[World Heritage in Danger]].&lt;ref&gt;Petzet, Michael (2010). "Safeguarding the Buddhas of Bamiyan". In Christoph Machat, Michael Petzet and John Ziesemer (Eds.), {{cite web |url=http://www.international.icomos.org/risk/world_report/2008-2010/H@R_2008-2010_final.pdf |title=Heritage at Risk: ICOMOS World Report 2008-2010 on Monuments and Sites in Danger}}. Berlin: hendrik Bäßler verlag, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 2006, Afghan officials were deciding on the timetable for the re-construction of the statues. As they wait for the Afghan government and international community to decide when to rebuild them, a $1.3 million UNESCO-funded project is sorting out the chunks of clay and plaster—ranging from boulders weighing several tons to fragments the size of tennis balls—and sheltering them from the elements.

The Buddhist remnants at Bamiyan were included on the 2008 [[World Monuments Watch]] List of the 100 Most Endangered Sites by the [[World Monuments Fund]].

In 2013, the foot section of the smaller Buddha was rebuilt with iron rods, bricks and concrete by the German branch of ICOMOS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Martini |first1=Alessandro |last2=Rivetti |first2=Ermanno |date=February 6, 2014 |title=Organisation says actions of German archaeologists who have partially rebuilt one of the statues "border on the criminal" |url=http://www.theartnewspaper.com:80/articles/Unesco-stops-unauthorised-reconstruction-of-Bamiyan-Buddhas/31660 |newspaper=[[The Art Newspaper]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150115033225/http://www.theartnewspaper.com/articles/Unesco-stops-unauthorised-reconstruction-of-Bamiyan-Buddhas/31660 |archive-date=15 January 2015 |accessdate=2017-12-17 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further constructions were halted by order of UNESCO, on the grounds that the work was conducted without the organization's knowledge or approval.

==Discoveries==
[[File:BAMIYAN BUDDHAS - GROTTO PAINTINGS.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Grotto painting in 2008]]
After the destruction of the Buddhas, 50 caves were revealed. In 12 of the caves, wall paintings were discovered.&lt;ref name="earth"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earthtimes.org/articles/show/200569,scientists-discover-first-ever-oil-paintings-in-afghanistan.html|title=Scientitsts discover first-ever oil paintings in Afghanistan|publisher=Earthtimes.org|accessdate=24 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2004, an international team of researchers stated the wall paintings at Bamiyan were painted between the 5th and the 9th centuries, rather than the 6th to 8th centuries, citing their analysis of radioactive isotopes contained in straw fibers found beneath the paintings. It is believed that the paintings were done by artists travelling on the Silk Road, the trade route between [[China]] and the West.&lt;ref name="paint"/&gt;

Scientists from the [[Tokyo Research Institute for Cultural Properties]] in Japan, the [[Centre of Research and Restoration of the French Museums]] in France, the Getty Conservation Institute in the United States, and the [[European Synchrotron Radiation Facility]] (ESRF) in [[Grenoble]], France, analysed samples from the paintings,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/04/080422083309.htm|title=Ancient Buddhist Paintings From Bamyan Were Made Of Oil, Hundreds Of Years Before Technique Was 'Invented' In Europe|publisher=Sciencedaily.com|accessdate=24 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; typically less than 1&amp;nbsp;mm across.&lt;ref name="nature"/&gt; They discovered that the paint contained [[pigment]]s such as vermilion (red [[mercury sulfide]]) and lead white ([[lead carbonate]]). These were mixed with a range of binders, including natural resins, gums (possibly animal skin glue or egg),&lt;ref name="nature"/&gt; and oils, probably derived from walnuts or poppies.&lt;ref name="paint"/&gt; Specifically, researchers identified drying oils from murals showing Buddhas in vermilion robes sitting cross-legged amid palm leaves and mythical creatures as being painted in the middle of the 7th century.&lt;ref name="earth"/&gt; It is believed that they are the oldest known surviving examples of [[oil painting]], possibly predating oil painting in Europe by as much as six centuries.&lt;ref name="paint"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/main.jhtml?view=DETAILS&amp;grid=&amp;xml=/earth/2008/04/22/sciart122.xml |title=Oil painting invented in Asia, not Europe |publisher=Telegraph.co.uk |accessdate=24 April 2008 |location=London |first=Roger |last=Highfield |date=22 April 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080423165040/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/main.jhtml?view=DETAILS&amp;grid=&amp;xml=%2Fearth%2F2008%2F04%2F22%2Fsciart122.xml |archivedate=23 April 2008 |df=dmy-all }} However, the press release picked up by media, clearly misdates the earliest uses of oil paint in Europe, which is fully described in a treatise by [[Theophilus Presbyter]] of 1100-1120, and may date back to the Ancient Romans. See: Rutherford John Gettens, George Leslie Stout, 1966, Courier Dover Publications, {{ISBN|0-486-21597-0}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=bdQVgKWl3f4C&amp;pg=PA42&amp;dq=oil+painting+Theophilus&amp;sig=oEkZ_FzY5mTDvyXr-FE9GLyZu-o Painting Materials: A Short Encyclopedia (online text)], p. 42 {{cite web |url=http://www.hs-augsburg.de/~harsch/Chronologia/Lspost12/Theophilus/the_da00.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-04-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080411000138/http://www.hs-augsburg.de/~harsch/Chronologia/Lspost12/Theophilus/the_da00.html |archivedate=11 April 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The discovery may lead to a reassessment of works in ancient ruins in Iran, China, Pakistan, Turkey, and India.&lt;ref name="paint"/&gt;

Initial suspicion that the oils might be attributable to contamination from fingers, as the touching of the painting is encouraged in Buddhist tradition,&lt;ref name="nature"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nature.com/news/2008/080422/full/news.2008.770.html|title=Ancient Buddhas painted in oils|publisher=nature.com|accessdate=24 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; was dispelled by [[spectroscopy]] and [[chromatography]] giving an unambiguous signal for the intentional use of drying oils rather than contaminants.&lt;ref name="nature"/&gt; Oils were discovered underneath layers of paint, unlike surface contaminants.&lt;ref name="nature"/&gt;

Scientists also found the translation of the beginning section of the original [[Sanskrit]] [[Pratītyasamutpāda]] Sutra translated by [[Xuanzang]] that spelled out the basic belief of Buddhism and said all things are transient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buddhistchannel.tv/index.php?id=37,3417,0,0,1,0 |title=Secret sutra found in rubble of Bamiyan Buddha |publisher=Buddhistchannel.tv |date=12 November 2006 |accessdate=9 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Another giant statue unearthed===
On 8 September 2008, archaeologists searching for a legendary 300-metre statue at the site announced the discovery of parts of an unknown {{convert|19|m|ft|abbr=off|adj=on}} [[Parinirvana|reclining Buddha]], a pose representing Buddha's [[Parinirvana]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110820235540/http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5iMwnIv89hH3Q7rvdzmDQH9zCL6KA New Bamiyan Buddha find amid destruction], [[Agence France-Presse|AFP]], 8 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Restoration==
[[File:Cultural Landscape and Archaeological Remains of the Bamiyan Valley-109153.jpg|thumb|caution sign, 2017]]
The UNESCO Expert Working Group on Afghan cultural projects convened to discuss what to do about the two statues between 3–4 March 2011 in [[Paris]]. Researcher Erwin Emmerling of [[Technical University Munich]] announced he believed it would be possible to restore the smaller statue using an [[Organic compound|organic]] [[silicon]] [[Chemical compound|compound]].&lt;ref name="restoration"&gt;[http://www.aolnews.com/2011/03/01/researchers-say-they-can-restore-1-of-destroyed-bamiyan-buddhas/?icid=maing%7Cmain5%7Cdl1%7Csec1_lnk2%7C47607 Researchers Say They Can Restore 1 of Destroyed Bamiyan Buddhas] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110305032019/http://www.aolnews.com/2011/03/01/researchers-say-they-can-restore-1-of-destroyed-bamiyan-buddhas/?icid=maing%7Cmain5%7Cdl1%7Csec1_lnk2%7C47607 |date=5 March 2011 }}. [[AOL|AOL News]], 1 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The Paris conference issued a list of 39 recommendations for the safeguarding of the Bamiyan site. These included leaving the larger Western niche empty as a monument to the destruction of the Buddhas, a feasibility study into the rebuilding of the Eastern Buddha, and the construction of a central museum and several smaller site museums.&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/news/749 Expert Working Group releases recommendations for Safeguarding Bamiyan] 27 April 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Work has since begun on restoring the Buddhas using the process of [[anastylosis]], where original elements are combined with modern material. It is estimated that roughly half the pieces of the Buddhas can be put back together according to Bert Praxenthaler, a German art historian and sculptor involved in the restoration. The restoration of the caves and Buddhas has also involved training and employing local people as stone carvers.&lt;ref&gt;Graham-Harison, Emma (16 May 2012)[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/may/16/stone-carvers-taliban-bamiyan ''Stone carvers defy Taliban to return to the Bamiyan valley''] The Guardian&lt;/ref&gt; The project, which also aims to encourage tourism to the area, is being organised by UNESCO and the [[International Council on Monuments and Sites]] (ICOMOS).

The work has come under some criticism. It is felt by some, such as human rights activist Abdullah Hamadi, that the empty niches should be left as monuments to the fanaticism of the Taliban, while [[NPR]] reported that others believe the money could be better spent on housing and electricity for the region.&lt;ref name="NPR"&gt;{{cite news|last=Kakissis|first=Joanna|title=Bit By Bit, Afghanistan Rebuilds Buddhist Statues|url=https://www.npr.org/2011/07/27/137304363/bit-by-bit-afghanistan-rebuilds-buddhist-statues?ft=1&amp;f=1004|accessdate=22 April 2013|newspaper=National Public Radio|date=27 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some people, including Habiba Sarabi, the provincial governor, believe that rebuilding the Buddhas would increase tourism which would aid the surrounding communities.&lt;ref name="NPR" /&gt;

===Rise of Buddhas with 3D light projection===
After fourteen years, on 7 June 2015, a Chinese adventurist couple Xinyu Zhang and Hong Liang filled the empty cavities where the Buddhas once stood with [[Three-dimensional space (mathematics)|3D]] [[laser light]] projection technology. The projector used for the installation, worth approximately $120,000, was donated by Xinyu and Hong, who were saddened by the destruction of the statues. With the desire of paying tribute, they requested permission from [[UNESCO]] and the [[Afghan government]] to do the project. About 150 local people came out to see the unveiling of the [[holographic]] statues on Sunday, 7 June 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= Mary-Ann Russon|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/buddha-statues-destroyed-by-taliban-resurrected-laser-projections-1505794 |title= Afghanistan: Buddhas of Bamiyan resurrected as laser projections | publisher=International Business Times |date= 12 June 2015| accessdate= 16 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= PAULA MEJIA|url=http://www.newsweek.com/afghanistan-buddha-statues-destroyed-taliban-reimagined-holograms-343113 |title= Afghanistan Buddha Statues Destroyed by Taliban Reimagined as Holograms | publisher=News Week |date= 15 June 2015| accessdate= 16 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''{{lang|nl|Centrum Wiskunde &amp; Informatica}}''' (abbr. '''CWI'''; English: "National Research Institute for Mathematics and Computer Science") is a research center in the field of [[mathematics]] and  [[theoretical computer science]]. It is  part of the [[Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research]] (NWO) and is located at the [[Amsterdam Science Park]]. This institute is famous as the creation ground of the [[Python Programming Language]]. It was a founding member of the European Research Consortium for Informatics and Mathematics ([[ERCIM]]).

==Early history==
The institute was founded in 1946 by [[Johannes van der Corput]], [[David van Dantzig]], [[Jurjen Koksma]], [[Hendrik Anthony Kramers]], [[Marcel Minnaert]] and [[Jan Arnoldus Schouten]]. It was originally called ''Mathematical Centre'' (in Dutch: ''Mathematisch Centrum''). One early mission was to develop mathematical prediction models to assist large Dutch engineering projects, such as the  [[Delta Works]]. During this early period, the Mathematics Institute also helped with designing the wings of the [[Fokker F27 Friendship]] airplane, voted in 2006 as the most beautiful Dutch design of the 20th century.{{Citation needed |date=December 2013}}

The computer science component developed soon after. [[Adriaan van Wijngaarden]], considered the founder of computer science (or ''informatica'') in the Netherlands, was the director of the institute for almost 20 years. [[Edsger Dijkstra]] did most of his early influential work on algorithms and formal methods at CWI. The first Dutch computers, the [[Electrologica X1]] and [[Electrologica X8]], were both designed at the centre, and [[Electrologica]] was created as a spinoff to manufacture the machines.

In 1983, the name of the institute was changed to CWI to reflect a governmental push for emphasizing computer science research in the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;Bennie Mols: ''ERCOM: The Centrum voor Wiskunde en Informatica turns 60.'' In: Newsletter of the European Mathematical Society, No. 56 (September 2007), p. 43 ([https://www.ems-ph.org/journals/newsletter/pdf/2007-09-65.pdf online])&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent research==
The institute is known for its work in fields such as [[operations research]], [[software engineering]], information processing, and mathematical applications in [[life sciences]] and [[logistics]].
More recent examples of research results from CWI include the development of scheduling algorithms for the Dutch railway system (the [[Nederlandse Spoorwegen]], one of the busiest rail networks in the world) and the development of the [[Python (programming language)|Python programming language]] by [[Guido van Rossum]]. Python has played an important role in the development of the [[Google platform|Google search platform]] from the beginning, and it continues to do so as the system grows and evolves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://python.org/about/quotes/ |title=Quotes about Python |publisher=Python.org |date= |accessdate=2012-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Many information retrieval techniques used by packages such as [[SPSS]] were initially developed by Data Distilleries, a CWI [[Corporate spin-off|spinoff]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bloorresearch.com/analysis/spss-and-data-distilleries/ |title=SPSS and Data Destileries |publisher=Python.org |date= |accessdate=2015-02-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150224133541/http://www.bloorresearch.com/analysis/spss-and-data-distilleries/# |archive-date=2015-02-24 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sumath |last2=Sivanandam |first1=S |first2=S.N. |date=2006 |title=Introduction to Data Mining and its Applications
 |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-540-34351-6 |publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg |page=743 |isbn=978-3-540-34350-9 |access-date=2015-02-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Work at the institute was recognized by national or international research awards, such as the [[Lanchester Prize]] (awarded yearly by [[INFORMS]]), the [[Gödel Prize]] (awarded by [[ACM SIGACT]]) or the [[Spinoza Prize]]. Most of its senior researchers hold part-time professorships at other Dutch universities, with the institute producing over 170 full professors during the course of its history. Several CWI researchers have been recognized as members of the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]], the [[Academia Europaea]], or as knights in the [[Order of the Netherlands Lion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cwi.nl/news/2013/cwi-lectures-organized-in-honour-of-mathematician-lex-schrijver |title=Lex Schrijver receives EURO Gold Medal 2015 |publisher=cwi |date=2013-04-25 |accessdate=2018-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2017, CWI in association with [[Google]] announced a successful [[collision attack]] on [[SHA 1]] encryption algorithm.&lt;ref&gt;[https://security.googleblog.com/2017/02/announcing-first-sha1-collision.html Announcing the first SHA1 collision]&lt;/ref&gt;

==European Internet==
CWI was an early user of the [[Internet]] in Europe. The first connection in Europe to the [[NSFnet]] network, which later developed into the Internet, was established at CWI on 17 November 1988 by [[Piet Beertema]], and cwi.nl was the first national [[domain name]] ever issued.&lt;ref&gt;{{nl}} [https://www.sidn.nl/over-sidn/geschiedenis/ De geschiedenis van SIDN] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130727033624/https://www.sidn.nl/over-sidn/geschiedenis/ |date=2013-07-27 }} (History of SIDN), [http://www.sidn.nl Official website] of SIDN&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Amsterdam Internet Exchange]] (one of the largest Internet Exchanges in the world, in terms of both members and throughput traffic) is located at the neighbouring [[Stichting Academisch Rekencentrum Amsterdam|SARA]] (an early CWI spin-off) and [[NIKHEF]] institutes. The [[World Wide Web Consortium]] (W3C) office for the Benelux countries is located at CWI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.w3c.nl |title=The World Wide Web Consortium  - Benelux Office |publisher= W3C |date= |accessdate=2014-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spin-off companies==
CWI has demonstrated a continuing effort to put the work of its researchers at the disposal of society, mainly by collaborating with commercial companies and creating spin-off businesses. In 2000 CWI established "CWI Incubator BV", a dedicated company with the aim to generate high tech spin-off companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cwi.nl/general/spinoff-companies |title=Spin-off companies' details |publisher=CWI Amsterdam |date= |accessdate=2014-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the CWI spinoffs include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cwi.nl/sharing-knowledge/spin-offs |title=Spin-off companies |publisher=CWI Amsterdam |date= |accessdate=2014-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Discovered by [[Diana Deutsch]] in 1973, '''Deutsch's "scale illusion"''' is an [[auditory illusion]] in which principles of grouping by [[frequency]], [[proximity space|proximity]], and spatial [[Sound localization|location]] are put into conflict and in which frequency proximity wins out.&lt;ref&gt;Bregman, Albert (1994). ''Auditory Scene Analysis: The Perceptual Organization of Sound'', p.76. {{ISBN|0-262-52195-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is produced by simultaneous ascending and descending [[major scale]]s beginning in separate [[stereophonic sound|stereo]] channels with each successive [[note (music)|note]] being switched to the opposite [[stereo channel|channel]]. With the left channel: C'-D-A-F--A-D-C'; and the right: C-B-E-G-E-B-C; the ear hears both: C'-B-A-G--A-B-C'; and: C-D-E-F--E-D-C. The tones are equal-amplitude [[sine wave]]s, and the sequence is played [[repeat sign|repeatedly]] without [[rest (music)|pause]] at a rate of four tones per second. (Listen to the Stereo Sound Example linked below.)

When listening to the illusion over [[headphone]]s, most [[handedness|right-handers]] hear a [[melody]] corresponding to the higher tones as on the right and a melody corresponding to the lower tones as on the left. When the earphone positions are reversed, the higher tones continue to appear to be coming from the right and the lower tones from the left. Other people experience different illusions, such as the higher tones on the left and the lower tones on the right, or a pattern in which the sounds appear to be localized in different and changing ways. [[Right-handedness|Right-handers]] and [[Left-handedness|left-handers]] differ statistically in how the scale illusion is perceived.

In a clinical study, patients with [[hemispatial neglect]] were shown to experience the scale illusion. Further, in an MEG study on normal listeners the scale illusion was found to be neurally represented at or near the auditory cortex.

Dyslexia was first identified by Oswald Berkhan in 1881,&lt;ref&gt;BERKHAN O. Neur. Zent 28 1917&lt;/ref&gt; and the term 'dyslexia' later coined in 1887 by [[Rudolf Berlin]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Rudolf Berlin: Originator of the term dyslexia |journal=Annals of Dyslexia|date=January 1973|first=Rudolph|last=Wagner|volume=23|issue= 1 |pages=57–63|doi= 10.1007/BF02653841}}&lt;/ref&gt; an [[ophthalmologist]] practicing in [[Stuttgart]], [[Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

During the twentieth century, dyslexia was primarily seen as a [[phonological deficit]] (specifically phonological awareness) that resulted in a reading deficit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Christo, Catherine|author2=John M. Davis|author3=Stephen E. Brock|title=Identifying, Assessing, and Treating Dyslexia at School.|year=2009|publisher=New York: Springer}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ott, Philomena|title=Teaching Children with Dyslexia: A Practical Guide.|year=2006|publisher=Routledge|ISBN= 978-0415324540}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Reid, Gavin|title=The Routledge Companion to Dyslexia|year=2012|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|ISBN=978-0415430784}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dyslexia was seen as an issue with reading achievement specifically, caused by deficits in discrimination of written word sounds as opposed to a broader disorder of brain function. However, much research from the 1990s onward has focused on the potential biological bases of dyslexia and understanding dyslexia as a disorder of brain function. One of the first weaknesses of the strictly phonological deficit hypothesis for dyslexia was its inability to account for the genetic link of dyslexia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Handbook of Reading Disability Research.|author1=McGill-Franzen|first=Anne|author2=Allington|first2=Richard L.|publisher=New York: Routledge|year=2012|isbn=978-0805853346|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, it's been shown that "Relatively high heritabilities were observed for both reading ability and dyslexia indicating substantial genetic influences."&lt;ref name=PractHandbook/&gt; In a large twin study (sample 1031 twins), Gayan and Olson established that dyslexia was highly heritable, while a family study by Pennington (sample 1698 individuals) showed familial risk rates of 35-45%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Olson, RK|title=Reading Disability: Evidence for a Genetic Etiology|journal=European Child &amp; Adolescent Psychiatry|volume=8|pages=52–55|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=|first=|date=|year=1991|title=Evidence for Major Gene Transmission of Developmental Dyslexia|url=|journal=JAMA: The Journal of the American Medical Association|volume=266|issue=11|pages=1527–1534|doi=10.1001/jama.1991.03470110073036|pmid=1880884|via=|vauthors=Pennington BF, Gilger JW, Pauls D, Smith SA, Smith SD, DeFries JC}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Without a biological explanation for dyslexia, this heritability went unexplained. Not only must the heritability be explained, but also the environmental factors that protected at-risk children from developing dyslexia. Research began to focus on potential biological causes and to center the study of dyslexia in a developmental framework. A second major weakness of the strictly phonological deficit hypothesis was its strict definition of dyslexia as a reading disorder. Consequently, the various secondary symptoms were unable to be explained, including automatization deficits of both skill and knowledge acquisition, balance impairments, motor skill/writing deficits, and muscle tone underdevelopment.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; New theories of dyslexia began to be a focus of research, with the most well established being the [[biological theories of dyslexia|magnocellular deficit theory]] the [[biological theories of dyslexia|automatization deficit theory]], and the double-deficit hypothesis.&lt;ref name=PractHandbook&gt;{{cite book|author1=Reid, Gavin,|title= Dyslexia: A Practitioner's Handbook.|year=2016|publisher=Chichester : Wiley Blackwell|isbn=978-0470760406}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{pn|date=April 2018}}

==Theories==
Theories of the [[etiology]] of dyslexia have and are evolving with each new generation of dyslexia researchers, and the more recent theories of dyslexia tend to enhance one or more of the older theories as understanding of the nature of dyslexia evolves.

Theories should not be viewed as competing, but as attempting to explain the underlying causes of a similar set of symptoms from a variety of research perspectives and background.&lt;ref name=theories&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Ramus F, Rosen S, Dakin SC |title=Theories of developmental dyslexia: insights from a multiple case study of dyslexic adults |journal=Brain |volume=126 |issue=4 |pages=841–65 |date=April 2003 |pmid=12615643 |doi=10.1093/brain/awg076 |url=http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=12615643 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--&lt;ref name=theories/&gt;--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Nicolson RI, Fawcett AJ |title=Procedural learning difficulties: reuniting the developmental disorders? |journal=Trends Neurosci. |volume=30 |issue=4 |pages=135–41 |date=April 2007 |pmid=17328970 |doi=10.1016/j.tins.2007.02.003 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cerebellar theory===
The '''cerebellar theory of dyslexia'''  asserts that the cause of dyslexia is an abnormality in the [[cerebellum]] (a region in the back of the brain), which in turn cause disruption in normal development, which causes issues with motor control, balance, working memory, attention, automatization, and ultimately, reading.&lt;ref name=Mody2008&gt;{{cite book|author1=Mody|author2=Sillman|title=Brain, Behavior, and Learning in Language and Reading Disorders|year=2008|publisher=London : The Guilford Press|isbn = 978-1593858315}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{pn|date=April 2018}}   This theory was initially proposed by [[Harold Levinson]] and Jan Frank in 1973 and further developed by Levinson and other researchers. Angela Fawcett and Rod Nicolson later proposed that the [[cerebellum]] contributes to motor control during the [[Manner of articulation|articulation of speech]], and that articulation problems can contribute to the [[phonological]] processing deficits that can cause dyslexia. They also reasoned that the cerebellum contributes to the automatisation of learned behaviors, which may include learning the [[grapheme]]-[[phoneme]] relationships when reading text.&lt;ref name=Stoodley2009&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Stoodley CJ, Stein JF |title=The cerebellum and dyslexia |journal=Cortex |volume= 47|issue= 1|pages= 101–16|date=October 2009 |pmid=20060110 |doi=10.1016/j.cortex.2009.10.005 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FNSage&gt;{{cite book|editor1=Reid, Gavin|title=The SAGE Handbook of Dyslexia|year=2013|isbn=9781412945134|chapter=Chapter 4:Dyslexia and the Cerebellum|first1=Angela J.|last1=Fawcett|first2=Roderick I.|last2=Nicolson}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|84}}


In attempting to explain all the many known reading and non-reading dyslexic symptoms, therapies and theories as well as the presence of only cerebellar and related vestibular neurophysiological signs in dyslexics, the cerebellum was postulated to coordinate in time and space all signals (visual, auditory, tactile, proprioceptive, motion) entering and leaving the brain as well as signal interconnections. The quality and severity of the many symptoms characterizing each dyslexic was reasoned to depend on the diverse cerebral cortical and other brain processors receiving scrambled signals due to a cerebellar dysfunction. Helpful therapies were reasoned to enhance cerebellar fine tuning (e.g., the use of cerebellar-vestibular stabilizing antimotion sickness medications) and/or improve descrambling and other compensatory cognitive capabilities (e.g., tutoring, biofeedback). Most other theories equate the dyslexia disorder with impaired reading comprehension and so attempt to only explain the latter. Another cerebellar proposal indicated that articulation problems can contribute to the phonological deficits that can cause dyslexia. The cerebellum also contributes to the automitisation of learned behaviors, which can include learning the grapheme-phoneme relationships when reading texts.&lt;ref name=Stoodley2009/&gt;&lt;ref name=theories/&gt;

However, some have suggested that cerebellar dysfunction alone may not be a primary cause of dyslexia and that dysarticulation and phonological deficits appear unrelated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Irannejad, S.  |author2=Savage, R. |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Is a cerebellar deficit the underlying cause of reading difficulties?|journal=Annals of Dyslexia|year=2012|volume=62|pages=22–52|doi=10.1007/s11881-011-0060-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stoodley|first=Catherine J.|author2=Stein, John F.|title=Cerebellar Function in Developmental Dyslexia|journal=The Cerebellum|date=1 August 2012|doi=10.1007/s12311-012-0407-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Ramus |first1=F. |last2=Pidgeon |first2=E. |last3=Frith |first3=U. |title=The relationship between motor control and phonology in dyslexic children |journal=Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry |year=2003|doi=10.1111/1469-7610.00157 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evolutionary hypothesis===
This theory considers that reading is an unnatural act carried out for a very brief period in human evolutionary history. It has only been in the last hundred years that reading a visual form of speech has been promoted as a major form of communication, and subsequently a lack of time for reading behaviors to evolve. In many societies around the world the majority of the population do not use the visual notation of speech as a form of communication and do not use reading skills, and therefore have no dyslexia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Dalby JT |title=An ultimate view of reading ability |journal=The International Journal of Neuroscience |volume=30 |issue=3 |pages=227–30 |date=September 1986 |pmid=3759349 |doi=10.3109/00207458608985671 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many developmental dyslexics significantly compensate for their cerebellar-vestibular
determined symptoms and signs over time and most normal young children evidence age-appropriate "dyslexic-like" symptoms and cerebellar-vestibular(CV) "immaturities." It was thus hypothesized that genetic dyslexia may represent an [[ontogenetic]] [[recapitulation theory|recapitulation]] of a pre-reading state in [[phylogeny]] and that [[ontogeny]] extended beyond the embryo into childhood and occasionally beyond, thus perhaps explaining late and even late-late blooming.&lt;ref name="Levinson2"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Levinson |first=H.N. |title=The discovery of cerebellar-vestibular syndromes and therapies, a solution to the riddle dyslexia |location=New York |publisher=Springer-Verlag; Stonebridge Publishing |pages=99–100 |year=2000 |isbn=0963930311}}&lt;/ref&gt; The development of reading and related writing and spelling functioning, as well as the corresponding ontogenetic CV-cerebral developmental lag hypothesis of dyslexia, is indirectly supported by studies suggesting that "the cerebellum has enlarged between three and fourfold in [only] the past million years of evolution [together with a corresponding spurt of the cerebrum]."&lt;ref name="Linas"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Linas |first=R. |year=1975 |title=The cortex of the cerebellum |journal=Scientific American |volume=232 |pages=56–71 |doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0175-56}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Palay"&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Palay |first1=S.L. |last2=Chan-Palay |first2=V. |year=1974 |title=Cerebellar Cortex: Cytology and Organization |location=New York |publisher=Springer-Verlag |isbn=9780387062280}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Magnocellular theory===
The Magnocellular theory attempts to unify the Cerebellar Theory, the Phonological Theory, the Rapid Auditory Processing Theory, and the Visual Theory.  The Magnocellular theory proposes that the [[magnocellular part|magnocellular]] dysfunction is not only restricted to the visual pathways but also includes auditory and tactile [[Stimulus modality|modalities]].&lt;ref name=theories/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Ray NJ, Fowler S, Stein JF |title=Yellow filters can improve magnocellular function: motion sensitivity, convergence, accommodation, and reading |journal=Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. |volume=1039 |issue= |pages=283–93 |date=April 2005 |pmid=15826982 |doi=10.1196/annals.1325.027 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

As of 2010, studies of [[Evoked_potential#Visual_evoked_potential|visual evoked potentials]] have generally supported this theory.  While some studies of contrast sensitivity have supported it. Subjects' age (10-46), differences in experimental design, small sample sizes (&lt;10 dyslexic subjects in prominent studies), and the presence, absence, or failure to assess for comorbid ADHD might explain these contradictory findings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schulte-Körne|first=Gerd|author2=Bruder, Jennifer|title=Clinical neurophysiology of visual and auditory processing in dyslexia: A review|journal=Clinical Neurophysiology|date=1 November 2010|volume=121|issue=11|pages=1794–1809|doi=10.1016/j.clinph.2010.04.028|pmid=20570212}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Naming speed deficit and double deficit theories===
The speed with which an individual can engage in the [[rapid automatized naming]] of familiar objects or letters is a strong predictor of dyslexia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Denckla MB, Rudel RG |title=Rapid "automatized" naming (R.A.N): dyslexia differentiated from other learning disabilities |journal=Neuropsychologia |volume=14 |issue=4 |pages=471–9 |year=1976 |pmid=995240 |doi=10.1016/0028-3932(76)90075-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Slow naming speed can be identified as early as kindergarten and persists in adults with dyslexia.

A deficit in naming speed is hypothesized to represent a deficit that is separate from phonological processing deficit. Wolf identified four types of readers: readers with no deficits, readers with phonological processing deficit, readers with naming speed deficit, and readers with double deficit (that is, problems both with phonological processing and naming speed). Students with double deficits are most likely to have some sort of severe reading impairment.

Distinguishing among these deficits has important implications for instructional intervention. If students with double deficits receive instruction only in phonological processing, they are only receiving part of what they need.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Birsh |first=Judith R. |year=2005 |chapter=Alphabet knowledge: letter recognition, naming and sequencing |editor=Judith R.

===Perceptual visual-noise exclusion hypothesis===
The concept of a [[Perceptual noise exclusion hypothesis|perceptual noise exclusion]] deficit (impaired filtering of behaviorally irrelevant visual information in dyslexia or visual-noise) is an emerging hypothesis, supported by research showing that subjects with dyslexia experience difficulty in performing visual tasks (such as motion detection in the presence of perceptual distractions) but do not show the same impairment when the distracting factors are removed in an experimental setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Sperling AJ, Lu ZL, Manis FR, Seidenberg MS |title=Motion-perception deficits and reading impairment: it's the noise, not the motion |journal=Psychological Science |volume=17 |issue=12 |pages=1047–53 |date=December 2006 |pmid=17201786 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2006.01825.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Roach NW, Hogben JH |title=Impaired filtering of behaviourally irrelevant visual information in dyslexia |journal=Brain |volume=130 |issue=3 |pages=771–85 |date=March 2007 |pmid=17237361 |doi=10.1093/brain/awl353 |url=http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=17237361 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The researchers have analogized their findings concerning visual discrimination tasks to findings in other research related to auditory discrimination tasks. They assert that dyslexic symptoms arise because of an impaired ability to filter out both visual and auditory distractions, and to categorize information so as to distinguish the important sensory data from the irrelevant.&lt;ref name=Sperling2005&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Sperling AJ, Lu ZL, Manis FR, Seidenberg MS |title=Deficits in perceptual noise exclusion in developmental dyslexia |journal=Nature Neuroscience |volume=8 |issue=7 |pages=862–3 |date=July 2005 |pmid=15924138 |doi=10.1038/nn1474 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Phonological deficit theory===
The [[phonological deficit]] theory proposes that people with dyslexia have a specific sound manipulation impairment, which affects their auditory memory, word recall, and sound association skills when processing speech. The phonological theory explains a reading impairment when using an [[alphabetic]] writing system which requires learning the [[grapheme]]/[[phoneme]] correspondence, the relationship between the graphic letter symbols and  speech sounds which they represent.&lt;ref name=theories/&gt;

===Rapid auditory processing theory===
The rapid auditory processing theory is an alternative to the phonological deficit theory, which specifies that the primary deficit lies in the perception of short or rapidly varying sounds. Support for this theory arises from evidence that people with dyslexia show poor performance on a number of auditory tasks, including frequency discrimination and temporal order judgment.&lt;ref name=theories/&gt;

===Visual theory===
The visual theory represents a traditional perspective of dyslexia, as being the result of a visual impairment creating problems when processing information from letters and words from a written text. This includes visual processing problems such as [[binocular vision|binocular]], poor [[vergence]], and visual crowding. The Visual Theory does not deny the possibility of alternative causes of dyslexia&lt;ref name=theories/&gt;

==Research==
Various methods and models have been used to study dyslexia.

===Genetics===
High genetic concordance found in [[twin studies]] suggest a significant genetic influence on reading ability, although the degree depends on the definition of dyslexia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Olson|first=RK|title=Dyslexia: nature and nurture|journal=Dyslexia|year=2002|volume=8|issue=3|pages=143–159|doi=10.1002/dys.228|pmid=12222731}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Linkage analysis]] and [[genetic association]] studies (typically [[quantitative trait locus]] association studies, which use [[microarrays]] to look at [[single nucleotide polymorphisms]] of multiple genes at once) have been used to identify [[candidate gene]]s that may be implicated in dyslexia, which have then been confirmed in various [[Knockout mouse|knockout models]].&lt;ref name=Guidi2018/&gt;

As of 2018 the leading candidate genes included [[DYX1C1]] on [[chromosome 15]], [[DCDC2]] and [[KIAA0319]] on [[chromosome 6]], and [[ROBO1]] on [[chromosome 3]].&lt;ref name=Guidi2018/&gt;&lt;ref name="Shastry" &gt;{{Cite journal|author=Shastry BS |title=Developmental dyslexia: an update |journal=J.

However, these genes account for a small proportion of variance in reading disability, often less than 0.5%.{{mcn|date=November 2018}} Additionally, the findings are not always replicated nor consistently supported by genome-wide association studies.&lt;ref name=Guidi2018/&gt; Therefore, no single gene is definitively implicated in dyslexia. A 2007 review reported that no specific cognitive processes are known to be influenced by the proposed genes and that scientists had begun to include [[neurophysiological]] (e.g., event-related potential) and imaging (e.g., functional [[MRI]]) procedures in their [[phenotype]] characterisation of people with dyslexia.&lt;ref name=Schumacher2007/&gt;&lt;ref name=Schumacher2007&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Schumacher J, Hoffmann P, Schmäl C, Schulte-Körne G, Nöthen MM |title=Genetics of dyslexia: the evolving landscape |journal=[[Journal of Medical Genetics]] |volume=44 |issue=5 |pages=289–97 |date=May 2007 |pmid=17307837 |pmc=2597981 |doi=10.1136/jmg.2006.046516}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is likely that multiple genes, as well as the environment, interact to influence reading ability. The [[Generalist Genes Hypothesis]] proposes that many of the same genes are implicated within different aspects of a learning disability as well as between different learning disabilities. Indeed, there also appear to be a large genetic influence on other learning abilities, such as language skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stromswold|first=Karin|title=The Heritability of Language: A Review and Metaanalysis of Twin, Adoption, and Linkage Studies.|journal=Language|date=December 2001|volume=77|issue=4|pages=647–723|doi=10.1353/lan.2001.0247}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Generalist Genes Hypothesis supports the findings that many learning disabilities are [[comorbid]], such as [[speech sound disorder]], language impairment, and reading disability, although this is also influenced by diagnostic overlap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Pennington BF, Bishop DVM |title= Relations Among Speech, Language, and Reading Disorders |journal=Annual Review of Psychology |year= 2009|volume=60 |pages=283–306|doi=10.1146/annurev.psych.60.110707.163548|pmid= 18652545 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Neuroimaging ===
[[Magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) and [[diffusion tensor imaging]] (DTI) are the main [[neuroimaging]] methods used to study brain structure in people with dyslexia, and [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI) along with [[EEG]] are used to study brain function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Soriano-Ferrer |first1=M |last2=Piedra Martínez |first2=E |title=A review of the neurobiological basis of dyslexia in the adult population. |journal=Neurologia (Barcelona, Spain) |date=undefined NaN |volume=32 |issue=1 |pages=50-57 |doi=10.1016/j.nrl.2014.08.003 |pmid=25444408}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Visual processing ===
Visual processes constitute an important part of higher cortical functioning.&lt;ref name="Vellutino 2–40"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vellutino|first=Frank R.|author2=Fletcher, Jack M. |author3=Snowling, Margaret J. |author4=Scanlon, Donna M. |title=Specific reading disability (dyslexia): what have we learned in the past four decades?|journal=Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry|date=1 January 2004|volume=45|issue=1|pages=2–40|doi=10.1046/j.0021-9630.2003.00305.x|pmid=14959801}}&lt;/ref&gt; The encoding and interpretation of retinal stimulation occur at the neurological level upon reception of afferent input from the eyes. Reading, for example, requires the possession of both adequate vision and the neurological ability to process what is seen. In the past, many researchers have associated anomalies in the visual system as the main cause of dyslexia. While acknowledging that most such theories are untenable, visual system deficits have been shown to contribute to symptoms of dyslexia, such as word reversal and skipping words.&lt;ref name="Vellutino 2–40"/&gt;

A small subset of dyslexic individuals have been demonstrated to have deficits in the magnocellular visual system.&lt;ref name="Stein 12–36"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stein|first=John|title=The magnocellular theory of developmental dyslexia|journal=Dyslexia|date=1 January 2001|volume=7|issue=1|pages=12–36|doi=10.1002/dys.186|pmid=11305228}}&lt;/ref&gt; A compromised magnocellular system, responsible for the processing of images with high temporal frequencies and high degree of movement, might be the main contributing factor to the reported "masking" of words reported amongst dyslexic individuals.&lt;ref name="Stein 12–36"/&gt; Researchers posit that such a "masking" effect is due to the abnormal longevity of the visual trace produced in the magnocellular system, resulting in a lapse in acuity as effected individuals attempt to process connected text.&lt;ref name="Vellutino 2–40"/&gt; 

Anomalies in saccadic movement, which are instantaneous, fast, oscillating eye movements essential for unimpaired reading have been observed in people with dyslexia. When corrected for reading ability, dyslexic individuals demonstrate below normal saccadic eye movements, suggesting that the severity reading disorders may be due to oculo-motor deficits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Olitsky|first=SE|author2=Nelson, LB |title=Reading disorders in children.|journal=Pediatric Clinics of North America|date=February 2003|volume=50|issue=1|pages=213–24|pmid=12713114|doi=10.1016/s0031-3955(02)00104-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, further examination of the phenomenon shows that saccadic patterns in dyslexics seem to be a result and not the cause of the disorder, as decoding and comprehension failure were isolated as the antecedent for impairments in both the speed and accuracy with which dyslexics read.

=== Language processing ===
Brain activation studies using PET to study language have found that people with dyslexia have a deficit in parts of the left hemisphere of the brain involved in reading, which includes the [[inferior frontal gyrus]], [[inferior parietal lobule]], and middle and [[Brodmann area 20|ventral temporal cortex]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=16925477 |doi=10.1207/s15326942dn3001_5 |year=2006 |last1=Shaywitz |first1=BA |last2=Lyon |first2=GR |last3=Shaywitz |first3=SE |title=The role of functional magnetic resonance imaging in understanding reading and dyslexia |volume=30 |issue=1 |pages=613–32 |journal=Developmental Neuropsychology}}&lt;/ref&gt; A neural basis for the visual [[lexicon]] and for auditory verbal [[short term memory]] components have been proposed.

Some classical regions, such as the [[arcuate fasciculus]], are having their "classical" roles questioned, while other regions, such as the basal temporal language zone, are growing progressively in terms of their recognized importance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=9059757 |year=1997 |last1=Chertkow |first1=H |last2=Murtha |first2=S |title=PET activation and language |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=78–86 |journal=Clinical Neuroscience}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{update-inline|date=November 2018}}

===Working memory ===
People with dyslexia have been commonly associated with working memory deficits, along with reduced activity in the pre-frontal and parietal cortex.&lt;ref name=Berninger2008&gt;{{cite journal|last=Berninger|first=Virginia W. |author2=Raskind, Wendy |author3=Richards, Todd |author4=Abbott, Robert |author5=Stock, Pat|title=A Multidisciplinary Approach to Understanding Developmental Dyslexia Within Working-Memory Architecture: Genotypes, Phenotypes, Brain, and Instruction|journal=Developmental Neuropsychology|date=5 November 2008|volume=33|issue=6|pages=707–744|doi=10.1080/87565640802418662|pmid=19005912}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Limitations ==
It is difficult to control for [[confounder]]s when attempting to isolate specific causes; for example, the response to instructions by children is itself confounded by a subjects' environments, genetics and socio-economic status.&lt;ref name=Berninger2008/&gt;

==Controversy==

In recent years there has been significant debate on the categorization of dyslexia. In particular, Elliot and Gibbs argue that "attempts to distinguish between categories of 'dyslexia' and 'poor reader' or 'reading disabled' are scientifically unsupportable, arbitrary and thus potentially discriminatory".&lt;ref name='Elliot1'&gt;{{Cite journal

While acknowledging that reading disability is a valid scientific curiosity, and that "seeking greater understanding of the relationship between visual symbols and spoken language is crucial" and that while there was "potential of genetics and neuroscience for guiding assessment and educational practice at some stage in the future", they conclude that "there is a mistaken belief that current knowledge in these fields is sufficient to justify a category of dyslexia as a subset of those who encounter reading difficulties".

''The Dyslexia Myth'' is a documentary that first aired in September 2005 as part of the ''[[Dispatches (TV series)|Dispatches]]'' series produced by British broadcaster [[Channel 4]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |title=The Dyslexia Myth

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Focusing only on the reading difficulties that people with dyslexia encounter the documentary says that myths and misconceptions surround dyslexia. It argues that the common understanding of dyslexia is not only false but makes it more difficult to provide the reading help that hundreds of thousands of children desperately need. Drawing on years of intensive academic research on both sides of the Atlantic, it challenged the existence of dyslexia as a separate condition, and highlighted the many different forms of reading styles.

Julian Elliot, an educational psychologist at [[Durham University]] in the United Kingdom, disputes the characterization of dyslexia as a medical condition, and believes it should be treated simply as a reading difficulty.&lt;ref name='Elliot1' /&gt; According to Elliot, "Parents don’t want their child to be considered lazy, thick or stupid. If they get called this medically diagnosed term, dyslexic, then it is a signal to all that it’s not to do with intelligence.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

*dyslexic children tend to score significantly better than other children, including non-impaired children, on tests of creativity, [[spatial memory]], and [[spatial reasoning]]
*dyslexic children also perform better than other reading-impaired children on tests of vocabulary and listening comprehension
*dyslexic children may be better served by educational intervention which includes strategies geared to their unique strengths in addition to skill remediation
and thus recommends more comprehensive evaluation and targeted interventions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Some [[North America]]n [[university|universities]] are home to [[academic degree|degree]] programs titled '''Ecology and Evolutionary Biology''', offering integrated studies in the [[academic discipline|disciplines]] of [[ecology]] and [[evolutionary biology]]. The wording is intended as representing the alternative approach from the frequently used pairing of '''Cell and Molecular Biology''', while being more inclusive than the terminology of [[Botany]] or [[Zoology]].  Recently, due to advances in the fields of [[genetics]] and [[molecular biology]], research and education in ecology and evolutionary biology has integrated many molecular techniques.

A program that focuses on the relationships and interactions that range across levels of biological organization based on a scientific study is Ecology and Evolutionary Biology.  The origins and history of ecosystems, species, genes and genomes, and organisms, and how these have changed over time is all part of the studies of how biodiversity has evolved and how it takes place.  Ecology and Evolutionary biology in North America is based on research impact determined by the top 10% of ecology programs.  The interactive web of organisms and environment are all part of what the field of Ecology explores.  There have been studies in evolution that have worked to prove that "modern organisms have developed from ancestral ones." The reason that evolutionary biology is so interesting to learn about is because of the evolutionary processes that is the reason we have such a diversity of life on Earth.There are many processes that make up evolutionary biology that give great insight to how we came to be, some of which include natural selection, speciation, and common descent.

'''Encoding''', in '''[[semiotics]]''', is the [[wikt:process|process]] of creating a [[message]] for transmission by an addresser to an addressee. The complementary process{{spaced ndash}}interpreting a message received from an addresser{{spaced ndash}}is called [[Decoding (semiotics)|decoding]].

==Discussion==
The process of message exchanges, or [[semiosis]], is a key characteristic of human life depending on rule-governed and learned [[code (Semiotics)|codes]] that, for the most part, [[Unconscious_mind|unconsciously]] guide the communication of [[Meaning (semiotics)|meaning]] between [[individual]]s. These interpretive frameworks or linking grids were termed "myths" by [[Roland Barthes]] (1915–1980) and pervade all aspects of [[culture]] from personal conversation to the mass media's output (for code exchange through the mass media, see [[Americanism (semiotics)|Americanism]]).

Early theorists like [[Ferdinand de Saussure|Saussure]] (1857–1913) proposed the theory that when the addresser wishes to transmit a message to an addressee, the intended meaning must be converted into content so that it can be delivered. [[Roman Jakobson]] (1896–1982) offered a [[structuralism|structuralist]] theory that the transmission and response would not sustain an efficient [[discourse]] unless the parties used the same codes in the appropriate social contexts. But, Barthes shifted the emphasis from the ''semiotics of language'' to the exploration of ''semiotics as language''. Now, as Daniel Chandler states, there is no such thing as an uncoded message: all experience is coded. So when the addresser is planning the particular message, both [[denotation (Semiotics)|denotative]] and [[connotation (Semiotics)|connotative]] meanings will already be attached to the range of signifiers relevant to the message. Within the broad framework of [[syntactic]] and [[semantic]] codes, the addresser will select signifiers that, in the particular context, will best represent his or her [[value (Semiotics)|values]] and purposes. But the medium of communication is not necessarily neutral and the ability of the addressee to accurately decode the message may be affected by a number of factors. So the addresser must attempt to compensate for the known problems when constructing the final version of the message and hope that the preferred meanings will be identified when the message is received. One of the techniques is to structure the message so that certain aspects are given [[salience (semiotics)|salience]] (sometimes called ''foregrounding'') and predispose the [[audience]] to interpret the whole in the light of the particular. This relates to [[Gestalt psychology]], [[Max Wertheimer]] (1880–1943) examined the factors that determine grouping in cognitive processes:
#the fact of grouping signs together predisposes an uncritical audience to perceive the signs as similar;
#the audience prefers ''closure'', i.e. it prefers the experience to be as complete as possible and to see things as a whole even though no actual continuity or conclusion is implied; and 
#the audience prefers an everyman's version of [[Occam's Razor]], i.e. the simplest explanations and solutions. In real life that means that assumptions, inferences and prejudices can often fill in gaps. If a conclusion seems to fit the available facts, other possibilities are not considered or are disregarded, producing the suggestion that humans conserve cognitive energy whenever they can and avoid thinking.
If an addresser is writing a speech, [[rhetoric]]al [[Trope (linguistics)|tropes]] may be used to emphasise the elements that the audience is to focus upon and potentially perceive as predicating a particular conclusion. If images are to be selected, [[metonymy]] may indicate common associational values with the preferred meaning of the text.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6269">{{short description|The evolution of the behaviour in frogs in which both the mother and father raise their offspring}}
The '''Evolution of biparental care in tropical frogs''' is the [[Behavioral ecology|evolution of the behaviour]] of a [[Frog#Parental_care|parental care system in frogs]] in which both the mother and father raise their offspring.

==Evolution==
Many tropical frogs have developed a parental care system where both the mother and father partake in raising their offspring. The evolution of biparental care, which is the joint effort of both parents, is a topic that is still under investigation. Biparentalism arose in some species of tropical frogs as a result of ecological conditions, the differences between the sexes, and their natural tendencies.

Male parental care could have served as the basis for the development of biparental care. Phylogenetic evidence shows that male parental care is the ancestral strategy in ''[[Dendrobates]]''.&lt;ref name="Summers &amp; Earn"&gt;Summers, K.,and Earn, D.. 1999.''The cost of polygyny and the evolution of female care in poison frogs''. Biological Journal of the Linnean Society 66(4):515-538.&lt;/ref&gt;  Currently there are ''Dendrobates'' species, such as ''[[Reticulated poison frog|D. ventrimaculatus]]'' and ''[[Red-headed poison frog|D. fantasticus]]'', that exhibit biparental care.&lt;ref name="Summers &amp; Earn"/&gt; The trend of using males to guard or brood eggs for biparental care or paternal care can be understood from the perspective of the female. After oviposition, or when the eggs are laid, the females need to replenish their bodies that have been dedicated to nurturing the eggs before they can mate again.&lt;ref name="Weygoldt"&gt;Weygoldt, P. 1987. ''Evolution of parental care in dart poison frogs''. Journal of Zoological Systematics and Evolutionary Research 25(1):51-67.&lt;/ref&gt; Brooding by the females would delay the opportunity to mate by about two to four weeks.&lt;ref name="Weygoldt"/&gt;Since this outcome would cause many males to compete for a few females that are able to mate, the males are favored for the brooding.&lt;ref name="Weygoldt"/&gt;

==Environment==
The environment can have a substantial impact on the uses of parental care. Not all tropical frogs have the ability to lay their eggs plainly on land or plants. Tropical frogs can choose from a variety of water sources, such as lakes, streams, and small puddles.  There is greater risk involved with reproducing in bigger bodies of water because of the higher likelihood of fish and other aquatic predators being there.&lt;ref name="Brown, Morales and Summers"&gt;Brown, J. L., Morales, V., and Summers, K.. 2010. ''A Key Ecological Trait Drove the Evolution of Biparental Care and Monogamy in an Amphibian''. The American Naturalist 175(4):436-446.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, frogs can choose to place eggs in [[phytotelma|phytotelmata]].&lt;ref name="Brown, Morales and Summers"/&gt; However, there is a trade-off that comes with electing a smaller water source. Not much sunlight reaches these locations, so algae and other food sources cannot grow to feed the inhabitants.&lt;ref name="Caldwell &amp; de Oliveira"&gt;Caldwell, J. P., and de Oliveira, V.. 1999. ''Determinants of Biparental Care in the Spotted Poison Frog (Dendrobates vanzolinii)''.

In the case of using phytotelmata, it is very difficult for one parent to guard and feed his or her offspring in possibly several different places. Roles performed by both parents provide a great advantage to the offspring.&lt;ref name="Caldwell &amp; de Oliveira"/&gt; As seen in the Amazon Rain Forrest, the different size of the bodies of water chosen for breeding correlates with the amount of biparental care in two very similar species of the ''Ranitomeya'' genus.&lt;ref name="Brown, Morales and Summers"/&gt;  ''[[Ranitomeya imitator]]'' favors smaller pools and uses biparental care.&lt;ref name="Brown, Morales and Summers"/&gt; Conversely, ''[[Ranitomeya variabilis]]'' utilizes larger bodies of water for breeding and only males take part in parental care.&lt;ref name="Brown, Morales and Summers"/&gt;  The ecologic aspects of a species habitat can have significant impacts on the type of parental care exhibited.

==Competition==
[[Trophic egg]] feeding plays a key role in the ability of frogs to breed in smaller bodies of water that lack food sources.&lt;ref name="Brown, Morales and Summers"/&gt;  Many species of tropical frogs have an inherent nature of [[cannibalism (zoology)|cannibalism]], such as ''[[Dendrobates vanzolinii]]'', that allow their tadpoles to utilize the eggs for nourishment.&lt;ref name="Caldwell &amp; de Oliveira"/&gt; With a male guarding the eggs, an intermediate step to developing biparental care may have been using the eggs from a mating with another female to feed existing tadpoles.&lt;ref name="Summers &amp; Earn"/&gt; Males could direct where the eggs should be positioned, and then he could move them into the water that holds his tadpole offspring.&lt;ref name="Summers &amp; Earn"/&gt; This [[polygyny in nature|polygynous]] relationship puts a cost on the female because she loses eggs to benefit offspring that are not her own.&lt;ref name="Summers &amp; Earn"/&gt; It is possible that the female could counter this effect by participating in biparental care with her mate.&lt;ref name="Summers &amp; Earn"/&gt; Also, since there may be a lack of males, females could benefit from attacking other clutches that her mate might have fertilized.&lt;ref name="Wells"&gt;Wells, K.D. 1978. ''Courtship and Parental Behavior in a Panamanian Poison-Arrow Frog (Dendrobates auratus)''. Herpetologica 34(2):148-155.&lt;/ref&gt;  Eliminating competition of a female’s offspring might result in higher survival of those she is trying to protect.  Females have been seen eating other females’ eggs in captivity by certain species, such as ''[[Dendrobates auratus]]''.&lt;ref name="Wells"/&gt; This [[sexual selection|intrasexual competition]] among the females might have been another important driving force for bringing about biparental care.  Multiple factors contributed to the evolution of biparental care in some species of tropical frogs.

[[File:IP polytope with LP relaxation.png|350px|thumb|A problem with five linear constraints (in blue, including the non-negativity constraints). In the absence of integer constraints the feasible set is the entire region bounded by blue, but with [[integer constraint]]s it is the set of red dots.]]
[[File:3dpoly.svg|thumb|right|A closed feasible region of a [[linear programming]] problem with three variables is a convex [[polyhedron]].]]

In [[mathematical optimization]], a '''feasible region''', '''feasible set''', '''search space''', or '''solution space''' is the set of all possible points (sets of values of the choice variables) of an [[optimization problem]] that satisfy the problem's [[Constraint (mathematics)|constraints]], potentially including [[Inequality (mathematics)|inequalities]], [[Equality (mathematics)|equalities]], and [[integer]] constraints. This is the initial set of [[candidate solution]]s to the problem, before the set of candidates has been narrowed down.

For example, consider the problem

:'''Minimize''' &lt;math&gt; x^2+y^4 &lt;/math&gt;

with respect to the variables &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y,&lt;/math&gt;

subject to

:&lt;math&gt; 1 \le x \le 10 &lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt; 5 \le y \le 12. \, &lt;/math&gt;

Here the feasible set is the set of pairs (''x'', ''y'') in which the value of ''x'' is at least 1 and at most 10 and the value of ''y'' is at least 5 and at most 12. Note that the feasible set of the problem is separate from the [[objective function]], which states the criterion to be optimized and which in the above example is &lt;math&gt; x^2+y^4. &lt;/math&gt;

In many problems, the feasible set reflects a constraint that one or more variables must be non-negative. In pure [[integer programming]] problems, the feasible set is the set of integers (or some subset thereof).  In [[linear programming]] problems, the feasible set is a [[Convex set|convex]] [[polytope]]: a region in [[Dimension (mathematics and physics)|multidimensional space]] whose boundaries are formed by [[hyperplanes]] and whose corners are [[vertex (geometry)|vertices]].

[[Constraint satisfaction]] is the process of finding a point in the feasible region.

==Convex feasible set==
{{See also|Convex optimization}}
[[File:Linear Programming Feasible Region.svg|frame|In a linear programming problem, a series of linear constraints produce a convex feasible region of possible values for those variables. In the two-variable case this region is in the shape of a convex [[simple polygon]].]]

A [[convex set|convex]] feasible set is one in which a line segment connecting any two feasible points goes through only other feasible points, and not through any points outside the feasible set.  Convex feasible sets arise in many types of problems, including linear programming problems, and they are of particular interest because, if the problem has a [[convex function|convex objective function]] that is to be maximized, it will generally be easier to solve in the presence of a convex feasible set and any [[local optimum]] will also be a [[global optimum]].

==No feasible set==

If the constraints of an optimization problem are mutually contradictory, there are no points that satisfy all the constraints and thus the feasible region is the [[null set]]. In this case the problem has no solution and is said to be ''infeasible''.

==Bounded and unbounded feasible sets==

 [[Image:Bounded unbounded.svg|right|thumb|A bounded feasible set (top) and an unbounded feasible set (bottom). The set at the bottom continues forever towards the right.]]

Feasible sets may be [[Bounded set|bounded or unbounded]]. For example, the feasible set defined by the constraint set {''x'' ≥ 0, ''y'' ≥ 0} is unbounded because in some directions there is no limit on how far one can go and still be in the feasible region. In contrast, the feasible set formed by the constraint set {''x'' ≥ 0, ''y'' ≥ 0, ''x'' + 2''y'' ≤ 4} is bounded because the extent of movement in any direction is limited by the constraints.

In linear programming problems with ''n'' variables, a [[Necessary and sufficient conditions|necessary but not sufficient condition]] for the feasible set to be bounded is that the number of constraints be at least ''n'' + 1 (as illustrated by the above example).

If the feasible set is unbounded, there may or may not be an optimum, depending on the specifics of the objective function. For example, if the feasible region is defined by the constraint set {''x'' ≥ 0, ''y'' ≥ 0}, then the problem of maximizing ''x'' + ''y'' has no optimum since any candidate solution can be improved upon by increasing ''x'' or ''y''; yet if the problem is to ''minimize'' ''x'' + ''y'', then there is an optimum (specifically at (''x'', ''y'') = (0, 0)).

==Candidate solution==
In [[mathematical optimization|optimization]] and other branches of [[mathematics]], and in [[search algorithm]]s (a topic in  [[computer science]]), a '''candidate solution''' is a [[Element (mathematics)|member]] of the [[Set (mathematics)|set]] of possible solutions in the feasible region of a given problem.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} A candidate solution does not have to be a likely or reasonable solution to the problem&amp;mdash;it is simply in the set that satisfies all [[Constraint (mathematics)|constraints]]; that is, it is in the set of ''feasible solutions''. Algorithms for solving various types of optimization problems often narrow the set of candidate solutions down to a subset of the feasible solutions, whose points remain as candidate solutions while the other feasible solutions are henceforth excluded as candidates.

The space of all candidate solutions, before any feasible points have been excluded, is called the feasible region, feasible set, search space, or solution space.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} This is the set of all possible solutions that satisfy the problem's constraints. [[Constraint satisfaction]] is the process of finding a point in the feasible set.

===Genetic algorithm===
In the case of the [[genetic algorithm]], the candidate solutions are the individuals in the population being evolved by the algorithm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last=Whitley | first=Darrell | title=A genetic algorithm tutorial | journal=Statistics and Computing | doi=10.1007/BF00175354 | volume=4 | issue=2 | pages=65–85 | year=1994 | ref=harv | url=http://www.cs.uga.edu/~potter/CompIntell/ga_tutorial.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Calculus===
In calculus, an optimal solution is sought using the [[first derivative test]]: the [[first derivative]] of the function being optimized is equated to zero, and any values of the choice variable(s) that satisfy this equation are viewed as candidate solutions (while those that do not are ruled out as candidates). There are several ways in which a candidate solution might not be an actual solution. First, it might give a minimum when a maximum is being sought (or vice versa), and second, it might give neither a minimum nor a maximum but rather a [[saddle point]] or an [[inflection point]], at which a temporary pause in the local rise or fall of the function occurs. Such candidate solutions may be able to be ruled out by use of the [[second derivative test]], the satisfaction of which is sufficient for the candidate solution to be at least locally optimal. Third, a candidate solution may be a [[local optimum]] but not a [[global optimum]].

In taking [[antiderivative]]s of [[monomial]]s of the form &lt;math&gt;x^n,&lt;/math&gt; the candidate solution using [[Cavalieri's quadrature formula]] would be &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{1}{n+1}x^{n+1}+C.&lt;/math&gt; This candidate solution is in fact correct except when &lt;math&gt;n=-1.&lt;/math&gt;

===Linear programming===
[[Image:Linear_Programming_Feasible_Region.svg|frame|A series of [[linear programming]] constraints on two variables produce a region of possible values for those variables. Solvable two-variable problems will have a feasible region in the shape of a [[Convex set|convex]] [[simple polygon]] if it is bounded. In an algorithm that tests feasible points sequentially, each tested point is in turn a candidate solution.]]
In the [[simplex method]] for solving [[linear programming]] problems, a [[Vertex (geometry)|vertex]] of the feasible [[polytope]] is selected as the initial candidate solution and is tested for optimality; if it is rejected as the optimum, an adjacent vertex is considered as the next candidate solution. This process is continued until a candidate solution is found to be the optimum.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1215">The concept of '''fiction-absolute''' exists firstly within the context of [[anthropology]], secondly within the study of [[group psychology]] and [[tribalism]].

The term was coined and defined by [[journalist]] [[Tom Wolfe]] in his 2006 [[Jefferson Lecture]] for the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.neh.gov/about/awards/jefferson-lecture/tom-wolfe-lecture&lt;/ref&gt;  Wolfe defined the term as the propaganda that a [[tribe]] or [[social group]] employs to explain why that group is the best of all groups and its people the best people. The term itself indicates that it is absolutist in that it defines in stark terms why members should prefer that tribe, and necessarily fictional because it is propaganda, although it might have some basis in truth. The fiction-absolute is essentially a [[tribe]]'s core propaganda. It can lead to [[Toleration|intolerance]] and forms of [[collective action]].

The fiction-absolute not only necessitates a harsh view of other groups, but also unaffiliated people and [[individualist]]s.

'''Floral symmetry''' describes whether, and how, a [[flower]], in particular its [[perianth]], can be divided into two or more identical or mirror-image parts.

Uncommonly, flowers may have no axis of [[symmetry]] at all, typically because their parts are spirally arranged.

== Actinomorphic ==
{{further|Merosity}}
[[File:Wurmbea stricta 0153.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Wurmbea]] stricta'', its [[tepal]]s in actinomorphic arrangement]]

Most flowers are '''actinomorphic''' ("star shaped", "radial"), meaning they can be divided into 3 or more identical sectors which are related to each other by rotation about the centre of the flower. Typically, each sector might contain one [[tepal]] or one petal and one sepal and so on. It may or may not be possible to divide the flower into symmetrical halves by the same number of longitudinal planes passing through the axis: [[Oleander]] is an example of a flower without such mirror planes. Actinomorphic flowers are also called [[symmetry (biology)#Radial symmetry|radially symmetrical]] or regular flowers. Other examples of actinomorphic flowers are the [[lily]] (''[[Lilium]]'', [[Liliaceae]]) and the [[buttercup]] (''[[Ranunculus]]'', [[Ranunculaceae]]).

== Zygomorphic ==
[[File:Satyrium erectum detail Ground orchid Pienktrewwa Near Ceres, Western Cape 0414.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Satyrium carneum]]''. Ground orchid with typical zygomorphic floral anatomy]]

'''Zygomorphic''' ("[[wikt:yoke|yoke]] shaped", "bilateral" – from the Greek ζυγόν, ''zygon'', yoke, and μορφή, ''morphe'', shape) flowers can be divided by only a single plane into two mirror-image halves, much like a yoke or a person's face. Examples are [[orchid]]s and the flowers of most members of the [[Lamiales]] (e.g., [[Scrophulariaceae]] and [[Gesneriaceae]]). Some authors prefer the term monosymmetry or bilateral symmetry.{{sfn|Craene|2010|loc=[https://books.google.ca/books?id=24p-LgWPA50C&amp;pg=PA25 p.&amp;nbsp;25]}}

== Asymmetry ==
A few plant species have flowers lacking any symmetry, and therefore having a "handedness". Examples: [[Valerian (herb)|''Valeriana officinalis'']] and ''[[Canna indica]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Weberling|first1=Focko|title=Morphology of Flowers and Inflorescences|date=1992|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0 521 25134 6|page=19|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=-ZlOAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA19&amp;lpg=PA19&amp;dq=valerian+flower+symmetry&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=whYatdGdPT&amp;sig=Zkar4siWlOc-6UfAx7I0aCX9_5Y&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=sT2UVNGyKpOMaO6TgLgI&amp;ved=0CFoQ6AEwDQ#v=onepage&amp;q=valerian%20flower%20symmetry&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Differences ==
Actinomorphic flowers are a basal angiosperm character; zygomorphic flowers are a derived character that has evolved many times.&lt;ref name=Bio8&gt;{{cite book |author1=Losos, J.B. |author2=Mason, K.A |author3=Singer, S.R. |title=Biology |publisher=McGraw Hill |location=New York |edition=8th }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some familiar and seemingly actinomorphic so-called flowers, such as those of [[Bellis perennis|daisies]] and [[dandelions]] ([[Asteraceae]]), and most species of ''[[Protea]]'', are actually clusters of tiny (not necessarily actinomorphic) flowers arranged into a roughly radially symmetric [[inflorescence]] of the form known as a [[Pseudanthium|head, capitulum, or pseudanthium]].

== Peloria ==

{{main|Pelorism}}

[[Image:PeloricFoxglove.jpg|thumb|upright| ''[[Digitalis purpurea]]'' (common foxglove) displaying an aberrant peloric terminal flower and normal zygomorphic flowers]]

Peloria or a peloric flower is the aberration in which a plant that normally produces zygomorphic flowers produces actinomorphic flowers instead. This aberration can be developmental, or it can have a genetic basis:  the CYCLOIDEA gene controls floral symmetry. Peloric ''[[Antirrhinum]]'' plants have been produced by knocking out this gene.&lt;ref name=Bio8/&gt; Many modern cultivars of ''[[Sinningia speciosa]]'' ("gloxinia") have been bred to have peloric flowers as they are larger and showier than the normally zygomorphic flowers of this species.

[[Charles Darwin]] explored peloria in ''Antirrhinum'' (snapdragon) while researching the inheritance of floral characteristics for his ''[[The Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1868|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=hoo5AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA33 33–34]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later research, using ''[[Digitalis purpurea]]'', showed that his results&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1868|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=hoo5AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA46 46]}}&lt;/ref&gt; were largely in line with [[Gregor Mendel|Mendelian]] theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Keeble, Frederick |author2=Pellew, C |author3=Jones, WN |title=The Inheritance of Peloria and Flower-Colour in Foxgloves (''Digitalis purpurea'') |journal=New Phytologist |volume=9 |issue= |pages= |year=1910 |jstor=2427515|doi=10.1111/j.1469-8137.1910.tb05554.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symmetry groups==

If we consider only those flowers which consist in a single flower, rather than a flower head or [[inflorescence]], we can group the flowers into a relatively small number of 2D symmetry groups. [[Monocots]] are identifiable by their trimerous [[petals]], thus monocots often have [[rotational symmetry]] of order 3. If the flower also has 3 lines of mirror symmetry the group it belongs to is the [[dihedral group]] D3. If not, then it belongs to the [[cyclic group]] C3. [[Eudicots]] with tetramerous or pentamerous petals may have rotational symmetry of order 4 or 5. Again, whether they also have mirror planes decides whether they belong to dihedral (D4 and D5) or cyclic groups (C4 or C5). The [[sepals]] of some monocot flowers develop to replicate the petals, thus, superficially, certain monocots can appear to have rotational symmetry of order 6 and belong to either symmetry group D6 or C6. However, flower symmetry is rarely perfect.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2866">'''Fluorochromasia''' (Greek flōr χρῶμα- Pronunciation: flｕ̇r·ō·krə′mā·zhə), is a cellular phenomenon characterized by immediate appearance of bright green fluorescence inside viable cells upon exposure to certain membrane-permeable [[Fluorescence|fluorogenic]] substrates such as [[fluorescein]] diacetate, fluorescein dibutyrate and fluorescein dipropionate.&lt;ref&gt;Rotman, Boris, and Ben W. Papermaster. "Membrane properties of living mammalian cells as studied by enzymatic hydrolysis of fluorogenic esters." Proceedings of the national academy of sciences 55.1 (1966): 134-141.&lt;/ref&gt;
The phenomenon is widely used to measure cellular viability of many different species including animals, plants, and microorganisms.  Moreover, fluorochromasia has been observed within organs, embryos, and [[zebrafish]]. Fluorochromasia has many applications including histocompatibility testing, measurement of cytotoxic antibodies, in vitro chemo sensitivity testing of tumors, and fluorochrome intercellular translocation. It has been applied with plants,&lt;ref&gt;Widholm, Jack M. "The use of fluorescein diacetate and phenosafranine for determining viability of cultured plant cells." Stain technology 47.4 (1972): 189-194.&lt;/ref&gt; bacteria,&lt;ref&gt;Chrzanowski, Thomas H., et al. "Applicability of the fluorescein diacetate method of detecting active bacteria in freshwater."

Woltering, Tumor Chemosensitivity Testing An Evolving Technique. Lab Medicine 21, 82-84, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In 1966, Rotman and Papermaster accidentally discovered fluorochromasia while studying intracellular enzymes using [[fluorogenic substrates]]. They studied its mode of action and presented a molecular model in which intracellular retention of fluorescein depends on the integrity of the cell membrane. Non- polar molecules of fluorescein-esters, such as fluorescein diacetate, readily enter the cell and are hydrolyzed
by non-specific esterases producing fluorescein, as the polar compound.  In viable cells, the intracellular fluorescein is unable to readily pass through the intact membrane (i.e., it leaks slowly),accumulating in the cytoplasm of the cell. Their model is illustrated in Figure 1.

'''FCT''' refers to [[functional testing]]. Typically, the functional test is performed during the last phase of the production line.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.speedboard.co.uk/test-inspection/functional-test/&lt;/ref&gt; This is often referred to as a final [[quality control]] test, which is done to ensure that specifications are carried out by FCTs.

The process of FCTs is entailed by the emulation or simulation of the environment in which a product is expected to operate. This is done so to check, and correct any issues with functionality. The environment involved with FCTs consists of any device that communicates with an [[Device under test|DUT]], the power supply of said DUT, and any loads needed to make the DUT function correctly.

FCTs uses customer specific connectors, rather than [[test point|a test point]] on the PCB.

Functional tests are performed in an automatic fashion by production line operators using test software. In order for this to be completed, the software will communicate with any external programmable instruments such as I/O boards, [[Multimeter|digital multimeters]], and communication ports. In conjunction with the test fixture, the software that interfaces with the DUT is what makes it possible for a FCT to be performed.[http://www.circuittechassembly.com/te.php]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16284">'''Groundwater remediation''' is the process that is used to treat [[groundwater pollution|polluted groundwater]] by removing the pollutants or converting them into harmless products. [[Groundwater]] is water present below the ground surface that saturates the pore space in the subsurface. Globally, between 25 per cent and 40 per cent of the world's [[drinking water]] is drawn from boreholes and dug [[water well|well]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ngwa.org/Fundamentals/use/Documents/global-groundwater-use-fact-sheet.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-08-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131228024655/http://www.ngwa.org/Fundamentals/use/Documents/global-groundwater-use-fact-sheet.pdf |archivedate=2013-12-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Groundwater is also used by farmers to [[irrigation|irrigate]] crops and by industries to produce everyday goods. Most groundwater is clean, but groundwater can become polluted, or contaminated as a [[human impact on the environment|result of human activities]] or as a result of natural conditions.

The many and diverse activities of humans produce innumerable [[waste]] materials and by-products. Historically, the disposal of such waste have not been subject to many regulatory controls. Consequently, waste materials have often been disposed of or stored on land surfaces where they percolate into the underlying groundwater. As a result, the contaminated groundwater is unsuitable for use.

Current practices can still impact groundwater, such as the over application of [[fertilizer]] or [[pesticide]]s, [[chemical spill|spills]] from [[industrialization|industrial]] operations, infiltration from [[urban runoff]], and leaking from [[landfill]]s. Using contaminated groundwater causes hazards to [[public health]] through [[poisoning]] or the spread of disease, and the practice of groundwater remediation has been developed to address these issues. Contaminants found in groundwater cover a broad range of physical, inorganic chemical, organic chemical, bacteriological, and radioactive parameters. Pollutants and contaminants can be removed from groundwater by applying various techniques, thereby bringing the water to a standard that is commensurate with various intended uses.

== Techniques ==
Ground water remediation techniques span biological, chemical, and physical [[water treatment|treatment]] technologies. Most ground water treatment techniques utilize a combination of technologies. Some of the biological treatment techniques include [[bioaugmentation]], [[bioventing]], [[biosparging]], [[bioslurping]], and [[phytoremediation]]. Some chemical treatment techniques include [[ozone and oxygen gas injection]], [[chemical precipitation]], [[Membrane technology|membrane separation]], [[ion exchange]], [[carbon absorption]], [[aqueous chemical oxidation]], and [[surfactant enhanced recovery]]. Some chemical techniques may be implemented using [[nanoremediation|nanomaterials]]. Physical treatment techniques include, but are not limited to, [[pump and treat]], [[air sparging]], and [[dual phase extraction]].

=== Biological treatment technologies ===

==== Bioaugmentation ====
If a treatability study shows no degradation (or an extended lab period before significant degradation is achieved) in contamination contained in the groundwater, then inoculation with strains known to be capable of degrading the contaminants may be helpful. This process increases the reactive enzyme concentration within the [[bioremediation]] system and subsequently may increase contaminant degradation rates over the nonaugmented rates, at least initially after inoculation.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2001"&gt;Hayman, M, &amp; Dupont, R. R. (2001). Groundwater and Soil Remediation: Process Design and Cost Estimating of Proven Technologies. Reston, Virginia: ASCE Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Bioventing ====
Bioventing is an [[in situ]] remediation technology that uses [[microorganism]]s to biodegrade [[organic matter|organic]] constituents in the groundwater system. Bioventing enhances the activity of indigenous bacteria and archaea and stimulates the natural in situ biodegradation of [[hydrocarbon]]s by inducing air or [[oxygen]] flow into the unsaturated zone and, if necessary, by adding nutrients.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Akaya FAQs|url = http://www.akayaenvironmental.com/faqs.html|website = Akaya|accessdate = 2015-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; During bioventing, oxygen may be supplied through direct air injection into residual contamination in soil. Bioventing primarily assists in the degradation of adsorbed fuel residuals, but also assists in the degradation of [[volatile organic compounds]] (VOCs) as vapors move slowly through biologically active soil.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cpeo.org/techtree/ttdescript/bioven.htm "Bioventing"], ''The Center for Public Environmental Oversight (CPEO)''. Retrieved 2009-11-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Biosparging ====
Biosparging is an [[in situ]] remediation technology that uses indigenous microorganisms to biodegrade organic constituents in the saturated zone. In biosparging, air (or oxygen) and nutrients (if needed) are injected into the [[saturated zone]] to increase the biological activity of the indigenous microorganisms. Biosparging can be used to reduce concentrations of [[petroleum]] constituents that are dissolved in groundwater, adsorbed to [[soil]] below the [[water table]], and within the [[capillary fringe]].

==== Bioslurping ====
Bioslurping combines elements of bioventing and vacuum-enhanced pumping of free-product that is lighter than water ([[light non-aqueous phase liquid]] or LNAPL) to recover free-product from the groundwater and soil, and to bioremediate soils. The bioslurper system uses a “slurp” tube that extends into the free-product layer. Much like a straw in a glass draws liquid, the pump draws liquid (including free-product) and soil gas up the tube in the same process stream. Pumping lifts LNAPLs, such as oil, off the top of the water table and from the capillary fringe (i.e., an area just above the saturated zone, where water is held in place by capillary forces). The LNAPL is brought to the surface, where it is separated from water and air. The biological processes in the term “bioslurping” refer to aerobic biological degradation of the hydrocarbons when air is introduced into the unsaturated zone contaminated soil.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cpeo.org/techtree/ttdescript/bislurp.htm "Bioslurping"], ''The Center for Public Environmental Oversight (CPEO)''. Retrieved 2009-11-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Phytoremediation ====
In the [[phytoremediation]] process [[:Category:Phytoremediation plants|certain plants and trees]] are planted, whose roots absorb contaminants from ground water over time. This process can be carried out in areas where the roots can tap the ground water. Few examples of plants that are used in this process are [[Chinese Ladder fern]] Pteris vittata, also known as the brake fern, is a highly efficient accumulator of [[arsenic]]. Genetically altered [[Populus sect. Aegiros|cottonwood]] trees are good absorbers of [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] and transgenic Indian mustard plants soak up [[selenium]] well.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, Robert. [http://oceanworld.tamu.edu/resources/environment-book/groundwaterremediation.html "Groundwater Remediation"], 2008-12-23. Retrieved on 2009-11-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Permeable reactive barriers====
{{Main article|Permeable reactive barriers}}
Certain types of [[permeable reactive barriers]] utilize biological organisms in order to remediate groundwater.

=== Chemical treatment technologies ===

==== Chemical precipitation ====
[[Precipitation (chemistry)|Chemical precipitation]] is commonly used in [[wastewater treatment]] to remove [[Water hardness|hardness]] and [[heavy metals]]. In general, the process involves addition of agent to an aqueous waste stream in a stirred reaction vessel, either batchwise or with steady flow. Most metals can be converted to insoluble compounds by chemical reactions between the agent and the dissolved metal ions. The insoluble compounds (precipitates) are removed by settling and/or filtering.

==== Ion exchange ====
[[Ion exchange]] for ground water remediation is virtually always carried out by passing the water downward under pressure through a fixed bed of granular medium (either cation exchange media and anion exchange media) or spherical beads. [[Cations]] are displaced by certain cations from the solutions and [[ions]] are displaced by certain anions from the solution. Ion exchange media most often used for remediation are [[zeolite]]s (both natural and synthetic) and synthetic resins.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2001"/&gt;

==== Carbon absorption ====
The most common activated carbon used for remediation is derived from [[bituminous coal]]. [[Activated carbon]] absorbs volatile organic compounds from ground water by chemically binding them to the carbon atoms.

==== Chemical oxidation ====
In this process, called [[In situ oxidation|In Situ Chemical Oxidation]] or ISCO, chemical [[oxidant]]s are delivered in the subsurface to destroy (converted to water and carbon dioxide or to nontoxic substances) the organics molecules. The oxidants are introduced as either liquids or gasses. Oxidants include air or oxygen, [[ozone]], and certain liquid chemicals such as [[hydrogen peroxide]], [[permanganate]] and [[persulfate]].
[[Ozone and oxygen]] gas can be generated on site from air and electricity and directly injected into soil and groundwater contamination. The process has the potential to oxidize and/or enhance naturally occurring aerobic degradation. Chemical oxidation has proven to be an effective technique for [[dense non-aqueous phase liquid]] or DNAPL when it is present.

==== Surfactant enhanced recovery ====
Surfactant enhanced recovery increases the mobility and solubility of the  contaminants absorbed to the saturated soil matrix or present as [[dense non-aqueous phase liquid]]. Surfactant-enhanced recovery injects [[surfactant]]s (surface-active agents that are primary ingredient in soap and detergent) into contaminated  groundwater. A typical system uses an extraction pump to remove groundwater downstream from the injection point. The extracted groundwater is treated aboveground to separate the injected surfactants from the contaminants and groundwater. Once the surfactants have separated from the groundwater they are re-used. The surfactants used are non-toxic, food-grade, and biodegradable. Surfactant enhanced recovery is used most often when the groundwater is contaminated by [[dense non-aqueous phase liquids]] (DNAPLs). These dense compounds, such as [[trichloroethylene]] (TCE), sink in groundwater because they have a higher density than water. They then act as a continuous source for [[contaminant plume]]s that can stretch for miles within an aquifer. These compounds may biodegrade very slowly. They are commonly found in the vicinity of the original spill or leak where capillary forces have trapped them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cpeo.org/techtree/ttdescript/surfenh.htm "Surfactant Enhanced Recovery"], ''The Center for Public Environmental Oversight (CPEO)''. Retrieved 2009-11-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Permeable reactive barriers====
{{Main article|Permeable reactive barriers}}
Some permeable reactive barriers utilize chemical processes to achieve groundwater remediation.

=== Physical treatment technologies ===

==== Pump and treat ====
Pump and treat is one of the most widely used ground water remediation technologies. In this process ground water is pumped to the surface and is coupled with either biological or chemical treatments to remove the impurities.

==== Air sparging ====
Air sparging is the process of blowing air directly into the ground water. As the bubbles rise, the contaminants are removed from the groundwater by physical contact with the air (i.e., stripping) and are carried up into the unsaturated zone (i.e., soil). As the contaminants move into the soil, a [[soil vapor extraction]] system is usually used to remove vapors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cpeo.org/techtree/ttdescript/airspa.htm "Air Sparging"], ''The Center for Public Environmental Oversight (CPEO)''. Retrieved 2009-11-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Dual phase vacuum extraction ====
Dual-phase vacuum extraction (DPVE), also known as multi-phase extraction, is a technology that uses a high-vacuum system to remove both contaminated groundwater and soil vapor. In DPVE systems, a high-vacuum extraction well is installed with its screened section in the zone of contaminated soils and groundwater. Fluid/vapor extraction systems depress the water table and water flows faster to the extraction well. DPVE removes contaminants from above and below the water table. As the water table around the well is lowered from pumping, unsaturated soil is exposed. This area, called the [[capillary fringe]], is often highly contaminated, as it holds undissolved chemicals, chemicals that are lighter than water, and vapors that have escaped from the dissolved groundwater below. Contaminants in the newly exposed zone can be removed by vapor extraction. Once above ground, the extracted vapors and liquid-phase organics and groundwater are separated and treated. Use of dual-phase vacuum extraction with these technologies can shorten the cleanup time at a site, because the [[capillary fringe]] is often the most contaminated area.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cpeo.org/techtree/ttdescript/dualphex.htm "Dual Phase Extraction"], ''The Center for Public Environmental Oversight (CPEO)''. Retrieved 2009-11-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Monitoring-Well Oil Skimming ====
Monitoring-wells are often drilled for the purpose of collecting ground water samples for analysis. These wells, which are usually six inches or less in diameter, can also be used to remove hydrocarbons from the contaminant plume within a groundwater aquifer by using a belt-style oil skimmer. Belt oil skimmers, which are simple in design, are commonly used to remove oil and other floating hydrocarbon contaminants from industrial water systems.

A monitoring-well oil skimmer remediates various oils, ranging from light fuel oils such as petrol, light diesel or kerosene to heavy products such as No. 6 oil, creosote and coal tar. It consists of a continuously moving belt that runs on a pulley system driven by an electric motor. The belt material has a strong affinity for [[hydrocarbon]] liquids and for shedding water. The belt, which can have a vertical drop of 100+ feet, is lowered into the monitoring well past the LNAPL/water interface. As the belt moves through this interface, it picks up liquid hydrocarbon contaminant which is removed and collected at ground level as the belt passes through a wiper mechanism. To the extent that [[DNAPL]] hydrocarbons settle at the bottom of a monitoring well, and the lower pulley of the belt skimmer reaches them, these contaminants can also be removed by a monitoring-well oil skimmer.

Typically, belt skimmers remove very little water with the contaminant, so simple weir-type separators can be used to collect any remaining hydrocarbon liquid, which often makes the water suitable for its return to the aquifer. Because the small electric motor uses little electricity, it can be powered from [[solar panels]] or a [[wind turbine]], making the system self-sufficient and eliminating the cost of running electricity to a remote location.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wateronline.com/article.mvc/The-Alternative-To-Pump-And-Treat-0001 "The Alternative To Pump And Treat"] Bob Thibodeau, Water Online Magazine, December 27, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Social and political impact ===

While at H.V.P. Mandal, he was influenced by social and political ideology being practiced in the institute by the founders Anant Krishna and Ambadas Krishna Vaidya under the leadership of the great patriot of Vidarbha Veer Vamanrao Joshi.

Boycotted high school education and joined non-cooperation Movement of Mahatma Gandhi initiated in Vidarbha by Veer Vamanrao Joshi. During the year 1921 he made heavy campaigning in rural area along with his colleagues who boycotted education with him, for creating awareness of N.C. Movement.

Joined ‘Rashtriya Mahavidyalaya’ at Amalner (Distt. Dhulia) and completed his education in 1922.

Passed entrance examination of ‘Tilak Maharashtra Vidyapeeth’ Pune (1923–25) and graduated with a Degree B.A. (Tilak) – "Wangmaya Visharad". Swami Ramanand Tirth and H.R. Mahajani were his batchmates, and their friendship continued in future.

Served as a teacher at ‘Rashtriya Vidyalaya’ Akot Distt. Akola for one year (1926) along with his colleagues. During the year 1927, he worked for H.V.P. Mandal and participated in its activities. He was subsequently deputed to West Bengal and Uttar Pradesh as a propagandist of physical culture and for conducting physical treaining camps at several places on the initiative of "Hindu Maha Sabha"of Calcutta (1928).

While at Gorakhpur in U.P. during such a camp Shivram Hari Rajguru (Compatriot of Sardar Bhagat Singh) visited the camp and met H.V.Deshpande and Dnyaneshwar Deshpande – both of them were close friends of Rajguru at H.V.P.M. (Rajguru was student at H.V.P.M. in 1927).

During his stay in U.P. for the camps he came in contact with national leaders like Pt. Madan Mohan Malviya and Lal Bahadur Shastri, who were associated and active in the working of Hindu Maha Sabha.

In 1929 he, along with his two colleagues, namely T.G. Joshi and V.B. alias Babasaheb Vaidya, went to Lahore to attend All India Session of Indian National Congress.

For his active involvement in non-cooperation movement during 1929 and 1930, he was arrested and sentenced to Jail in 1930 for a year. Again in 1932 he was arrested and sent to jail for rigorous punishment by British Government.

Soon after release from jail he again involved in organizing Berar Youth League and its conferences (1933-34).

Helped actively in conducting All-India Training Camp of "Hindustani Seva Dal" at Borivali (Mumbai) in 1931.

Organized and helped Provincial and All India Conferences for supporting Registration Bill of Ayurvedic Practitioners - 1937-39.

Recruited and conducted Training Camp of 3000 volunteers from Madhya Pradeh and Mahakoshal with his colleagues on behalf of H.V.P.Mandal for the service during the All India Session of AICC at Tripuri (Jabalpur) held in 1939. He was appointed Chief Organizer of the Volunteers Corps. He came in contact with various national leaders like Pt. Jawaharlal Nehru and Subhash Chandra Bose.

Organizer of the HVPM team of 150 members to participate in Golden Jubilee of Indian National Congress held at Govalia Tank Maidan Mumbai 1937. Prior to Mumbai the team had its display of traditional physical activities at Baroda and Surat where Maharaja Sayajirao Gaikwad and Sardar Vallabha Bhai Patel respectively presided over the programme.

1940-42 –actively involved in’Quit India Movement" for which he was again arrested and jailed for more than six months.

=== Government service ===

Appointed and served as Liaison &amp; Welfare Officer in Home Guard Department of Ex-M.P.Government (1947–1956) Subsequently served on the said post in the same Department of Maharashtra Government (1956–1960)

=== International contacts ===

Being Chief Organizer of the Indian Lingiad Team and having his visit to several countries he developed contacts with the physical education experts, sports persons and institutions of Germany, Sweden. Denmark, England and Switzerland.

===Death and afterward===

'''Life through 1960–65:'''

Resigned Government service (1960) and accepted Managing Editorship of "Aarogya Mandir" monthly magazine of Panvel. He started publishing magazine from Amravati (1960–63).

Subsequent to the closure of publication by the management, he turned towards Gandhi Smarak Nidhi as Organizer of the Gandhi Study Centre at Amravati where he organized library (1961–64)for general public, periodical lectures on Gandhian ideology and allied topics.

[[Image:Phylogenetic tree.svg|thumb|right|400px|A three domain [[phylogenetic tree|tree]] of life showing the separation of [[Bacteria]], [[Archaea]], and [[Eukaryote]] domains. See [[Microorganisms]] article for further explanation.]]

Scientists trying to reconstruct evolutionary history have been challenged by the fact that genes can sometimes transfer between distant branches on the [[tree of life (biology)|tree of life]]. This movement of genes can occur through [[horizontal gene transfer]] (HGT), scrambling the information on which biologists relied to reconstruct the [[phylogenetics|phylogeny]] of organisms. Conversely, HGT can also help scientists to reconstruct and date the tree of life. Indeed, a gene transfer can be used as a phylogenetic marker, or as the proof of contemporaneity of the donor and recipient organisms, and as a trace of extinct biodiversity.

HGT happens very infrequently – at the individual organism level, it is highly improbable for any such event to take place. However, on the grander scale of evolutionary history, these events occur with some regularity. On one hand, this forces to abandon the use of individual genes as good markers for the history of life. On the other hand, this provides an almost unexploited large source of information about the past.

== Three domains of life ==

The three main early branches of the tree of life have been intensively studied by [[Microorganism|microbiologists]] because the first organisms were microorganisms. Microbiologists (led by [[Carl Woese]]) have introduced the term ''[[Domain (biology)|domain]]'' for the three main branches of this tree, where ''domain'' is  a phylogenetic term similar in meaning to biological [[Kingdom (biology)|kingdom]]. To reconstruct this tree of life, the gene sequence encoding the small subunit of [[ribosome|ribosomal]] [[RNA]] (SSU rRNA, [[16s rRNA]]) has proven useful, and the tree (as shown in the picture) relies heavily on information from this single gene.

These three domains of life represent the main evolutionary lineages of early cellular life and currently include [[Bacteria]], [[Archaea]] (single-celled organisms superficially similar to bacteria), and [[Eukaryote|Eukarya]]. Eukarya includes only organisms having a well-defined nucleus, such as [[fungi]], [[protist]]s, and all organisms in the plant and animals kingdoms (see figure).

The gene most commonly used for constructing phylogenetic relationships in [[prokaryote|microorganisms]] is the small subunit ribosomal RNA  gene, as its sequences tend to be conserved among members with close phylogenetic distances, yet variable enough that differences can be measured.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Woese C, etal | title = Towards a natural system of organisms: proposal for the domains Archaea, Bacteria, and Eucarya| url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/reprint/87/12/4576| journal = PNAS USA| volume = 87 | pages = 4576–9 | year = 1990 | pmid = 2112744 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.87.12.4576 | issue = 12 | pmc = 54159 | bibcode=1990PNAS...87.4576W}}

The SSU rRNA as a measure of evolutionary distances was pioneered by [[Carl Woese]] when formulating the first modern "tree of life", and his  results led him to propose the [[Archaea]] as a third domain of [[life]]. However, recently it has been argued that SSU rRNA genes can also be horizontally transferred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Yap | first1 = WH | last2 = Zhang | first2 = Z | last3 = Wang | first3 = Y | title = Distinct types of rRNA operons exist in the genome of the actinomycete Thermomonospora chromogena and evidence for horizontal transfer of an entire rRNA operon. | journal = Journal of Bacteriology | volume = 181 | issue = 17 | pages = 5201–9 | year = 1999 | pmid = 10464188 | pmc = 94023 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although this may be rare, this possibility is forcing scrutiny of the validity of phylogenetic trees based on SSU rRNAs.

Recent discoveries of "rampant" HGT in microorganisms, and the detection of horizontal movement of even genes for the small subunit of ribosomal RNA, have forced biologists to question the accuracy of at least the early branches in the tree, and even question the validity of trees as useful models of how early evolution occurs.&lt;ref name="Simonson2005"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Simonson | first1 = AB | last2 = Servin | first2 = JA | last3 = Skophammer | first3 = RG | last4 = Herbold | first4 = CW | last5 = Rivera | first5 = MC | last6 = Lake | first6 = JA | title = Decoding the genomic tree of life. | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 102 Suppl 1 | pages = 6608–13 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15851667 | pmc = 1131872 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0501996102 |bibcode = 2005PNAS..102.6608S }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br&gt;
"Sequence comparisons suggest recent horizontal transfer of many [[gene]]s among diverse [[species]] including across the boundaries of [[phylogenetic]] "domains". Thus determining the phylogenetic history of a species can not be done conclusively by determining evolutionary trees for single genes." &lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/19990220101406/http://opbs.okstate.edu/%7Emelcher/MG/MGW3/MG334.html Horizontal Gene Transfer, Oklahoma State]&lt;/ref&gt; HGT is thus a potential [[Lurking variable|confounding factor]] in inferring [[phylogenetic tree]]s from the [[sequence]] of one [[gene]]. For example, if two distantly related bacteria have exchanged a gene, a [[phylogenetic tree]] including those species will show them to be closely related even though most other genes have diverged substantially. For this reason it is important to use other information to infer phylogenies, such as the presence or absence of genes, or, more commonly, to include as wide a range of genes for analysis as possible.

==Choice of metaphor: tree, a net, cobweb, or ring==
In his article ''Uprooting the Tree of Life'', W. [[Ford Doolittle]] discusses the [[Last universal ancestor|Last Universal Common Ancestor]] – the root of the Tree of Life – and the problems with that concept posed by HGT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1038/scientificamerican0200-90 | last1 = Doolittle | first1 = WF | year = 2000 | title = Uprooting the tree of life | url = | journal = Sci Am | volume = 282 | issue = 2| pages = 90–5 | pmid = 10710791 | bibcode = 2000SciAm.282b..90D }}&lt;/ref&gt; He describes the microorganism ''Archaeoglobus fulgidus'' as an anomaly with respect to a [[phylogenetic]] tree based upon the code for the [[enzyme]] [[HMGCoA reductase]] – the organism is definitely an archaean, with all the cell lipids and transcription machinery  expected of an archaean, but its HMGCoA genes are of bacterial origin. In the article, Doolittle says that while it is now widely accepted that [[mitochondria]] in eukaryotes derived from alpha-proteobacterial cells and that [[chloroplast]]s came from ingested [[cyanobacteria]],

&lt;blockquote&gt;
".. it is no longer safe to assume that those were the only lateral gene transfers that occurred after the first eukaryotes arose. Only in later, multicellular eukaryotes do we know of definite restrictions on horizontal gene exchange, such as the advent of separated (and protected) [[germ cell]]s...

If there had never been any lateral gene transfer, all these individual gene trees would have the same topology (the same branching order), and the ancestral genes at the root of each tree would have all been present in the last universal common ancestor, a single ancient cell. But extensive transfer means that neither is the case: gene trees will differ (although many will have regions of similar topology) ''and'' there would never have been a single cell that could be called the last universal common ancestor..."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Doolittle suggested that the universal common ancestor cannot have been one particular organism, but must have been a loose, diverse conglomeration of primitive cells that evolved together. These early cells, each with relatively few genes, differed in many ways, and swapped their [[gene]]s freely. Eventually, from these eclectic cells came the three domains of life as we know them today: [[bacteria]], [[archaea]] and [[eukaryote]]. These domains are now recognizably distinct because much of the gene transfer that still occurs is within these domains, rather than between them. Biologist [[Johann Peter Gogarten|Peter Gogarten]] reinforced these arguments, and suggested that the metaphor of a tree does not fit the data from recent genome research, and that biologists should instead use "the metaphor of a mosaic to describe the different histories combined in individual genomes and use [the] metaphor of a net to visualize the rich exchange and cooperative effects of HGT among microbes."&lt;ref&gt;Gogarten JP 'Horizontal Gene Transfer – A New Paradigm for Biology' [http://www.esalenctr.org/display/confpage.cfm?confid=10&amp;pageid=105&amp;pgtype=1 PhD thesis]

==Resolution of uncertainty with phylogenomics==

The three domains of life are (A) archaea, (B–J) bacteria, and (K) eukaryote. Species are labeled with different colors based on their inferred HGT rates: red, &gt;4%; yellow, 3–4%; pink, 2–3%; blue, 1–2%; green, &lt;1%.

Despite the uncertainties in reconstructing phylogenies back to the beginnings of life, progress is being made in reconstructing the tree of life in the face of uncertainties raised by HGT. The uncertainty of any inferred phylogenetic tree based on a single gene can be resolved by using several common genes or even evidence from whole genomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

[[Jonathan Eisen]] and [[Claire M. Fraser|Claire Fraser]] have pointed out that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"In building the tree of life, analysis of whole genomes has begun to supplement, and in some cases to improve upon, studies previously done with one or a few genes. For example, recent studies of complete bacterial genomes have suggested that the hyperthermophilic species are not deeply branching; if this is true, it casts doubt on the idea that the first forms of life were thermophiles. Analysis of the genome of the eukaryotic parasite ''Encephalitozoon cuniculi'' supports suggestions that the group ''Microsporidia'' are not deep branching protists but are in fact members of the fungal kingdom. Genome analysis can even help resolve relationships within species, such as by providing new genetic markers for population genetics studies in the bacteria causing anthrax or tuberculosis. In all these studies, it is the additional data provided by a complete genome sequence that allows one to separate the phylogenetic signal from the noise. This is not to say the tree of life is now resolved – we only have sampled a smattering of genomes, and many groups are not yet touched"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Eisen | first1 = J.| last2 = Fraser | first2 = C.| title = Phylogenomics: intersection of evolution and genomics| journal = Science| volume = 300| issue = 5626| pages = 1706–1707| year = 2003| pmid = 12805538| doi = 10.1126/science.1086292|bibcode = 2003Sci...300.1706E }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

These approaches are enabling estimates of the relative frequency of HGT; the relatively low values that have been observed suggests that the 'tree' is still a valid metaphor for evolution – but the tree is adorned with 'cobwebs' of horizontally transferred genes. This is the main conclusion of a 2005 study of more than 40 complete microbial genomic sequences by Fan Ge, Li-San Wang, and [[Junhyong Kim]]. They estimate the frequency of HGT events at about 2% of core genes per genome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ge | first1 = Fan | last2 = Wang | first2 = Li-San | last3 = Kim | first3 = Junhyong | title = The Cobweb of Life Revealed by Genome-Scale Estimates of Horizontal Gene Transfer | journal = PLoS Biology | volume = 3 | issue = 10 | pages = e316 | year = 2005 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.0030316 | pmc = 1233574 | pmid=16122348}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar whole genome approaches to assessing evolution are also enabling progress in identifying very early events in the tree of life, such as a proposal that eukaryotes arose by fusion of two complete but very diverse prokaryote genomes: one from a bacterium and one from an archaeal cell.&lt;ref name="Simonson2005" /&gt;

Such a fusion of organisms [[hypothesis]] for the origin of complex nucleated cells has been put forward by [[Lynn Margulis]] using quite different reasoning about [[symbiosis]] between a bacterium and an archaen arising in an ancient consortium of microbes.&lt;ref&gt;''Acquiring genomes: a theory of the origin of species.''

== The use of horizontal transfer for evolutionary studies ==
While HGT is often seen as a challenge for the reconstruction of the tree of life, an alternative view is that oppositely it provides additional valuable information for its reconstruction.

First, for the recipient organism, HGT is a DNA mutation like others, and as such, it can be modeled and used in tree reconstruction and rooting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Abby|first=Sophie S.|last2=Tannier|first2=Eric|last3=Gouy|first3=Manolo|last4=Daubin|first4=Vincent|date=2012-03-27|title=Lateral gene transfer as a support for the tree of life|url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1116871109|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|volume=109|issue=13|pages=4962–4967|doi=10.1073/pnas.1116871109|pmc=3323970|bibcode=2012PNAS..109.4962A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Second, it is necessary that the recipient of a gene acquisition by HGT lives at the same time, or at a ulterior time, as the donor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/protocol/10.1007/978-1-60327-853-9_7|title=Horizontal Gene Transfer|last=Huang|first=Jinling|last2=Gogarten|first2=Johann Peter|date=2009|publisher=Humana Press|isbn=9781603278522|series=Methods in Molecular Biology|pages=127–139|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-1-60327-853-9_7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In consequence there is an information on the timing of diversification in HGT.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Davín|first=Adrián A.|last2=Tannier|first2=Eric|last3=Williams|first3=Tom A.|last4=Boussau|first4=Bastien|last5=Daubin|first5=Vincent|last6=Szöllősi|first6=Gergely J.|date=2018-04-02|title=Gene transfers can date the tree of life|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-018-0525-3|journal=Nature Ecology &amp; Evolution|language=En|doi=10.1038/s41559-018-0525-3|issn=2397-334X}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is all the more remarkable since the principal usual source for dating in the living world, the fossil record, is absent precisely where HGT is abundant, in the microbial world.

Third, it provides information about the extinct biodiversity, because transfers are likely from extinct species.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Szöllősi|first=Gergely J.|last2=Tannier|first2=Eric|last3=Lartillot|first3=Nicolas|last4=Daubin|first4=Vincent|date=2013-05-01|title=Lateral Gene Transfer from the Dead|url=https://academic.oup.com/sysbio/article/62/3/386/1651886|journal=Systematic Biology|language=en|volume=62|issue=3|pages=386–397|doi=10.1093/sysbio/syt003|issn=1063-5157|arxiv=1211.4606}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The original idea of the ''Illustris project'' has been proposed by Mark Vogelsberger as the first large-scale galaxy formation application of Volker Springel's novel Arepo code&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vogelsberger|first=Mark|last2=Sijacki|first2=Debora|last3=Kereš|first3=Dušan|last4=Springel|first4=Volker|last5=Hernquist|first5=Lars|date=2012-09-05|title=Moving mesh cosmology: numerical techniques and global statistics|url=https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/425/4/3024/1079965|journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society|language=en|volume=425|issue=4|pages=3024–3057|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2966.2012.21590.x|issn=0035-8711}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vogelsberger|first=Mark|last2=Sijacki|first2=Debora|last3=Kereš|first3=Dušan|last4=Springel|first4=Volker|last5=Hernquist|first5=Lars|date=2012-09-05|title=Moving mesh cosmology: numerical techniques and global statistics|url=https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/425/4/3024/1079965|journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society|language=en|volume=425|issue=4|pages=3024–3057|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2966.2012.21590.x|issn=0035-8711}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The Illustris Project contains a series simulations, with the IllustrisTNG series being the most recent one. 

The ''Illustris project'' includes [[Cosmic web|large-scale]] [[Cosmology|cosmological]] [[simulations]] of the [[Chronology of the universe|evolution of the universe]], spanning initial conditions of the [[Big Bang]], to the present day, [[Age of the universe|13.8 billion years]] later. Modeling, based on the most precise data and calculations currently available, are compared to actual findings of the [[observable universe]] in order to better understand the nature of the [[universe]], including [[galaxy formation]], [[dark matter]] and [[dark energy]].&lt;ref name="HS-20140507" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20140716" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NASA-20140512" /&gt;

The simulation includes many physical processes which are thought to be critical for galaxy formation. These include the formation of stars and the subsequent "feedback" due to supernova explosions, as well as the formation of super-massive black holes, their consumption of nearby gas, and their multiple modes of energetic feedback.&lt;ref name="IP-20140614" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NAT-20140508" /&gt;

Images, videos, and other data visualizations for public distribution are available at [http://www.illustris-project.org/media/ official media page]. All original data files can be directly downloaded through the [http://www.illustris-project.org/data/ data release webpage]

===Computational aspects===
The main ''Illustris'' simulation was run on the [[Curie supercomputer]] at [[Commissariat à l'énergie atomique et aux énergies alternatives|CEA (France)]] and the [[SuperMUC|SuperMUC supercomputer]] at the [[Dagstuhl|Leibniz Computing Center (Germany)]].&lt;ref name="IP-20140614" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WRD-20140507"&gt;{{cite web |last=Mann |first=Adam |title=Supercomputers Simulate the Universe in Unprecedented Detail |url=https://www.wired.com/2014/05/supercomputers-simulate-the-universe-in-unprecedented-detail/ |date=7 May 2014 |work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |accessdate=18 July 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A total of 19 million CPU hours was required, using 8,192 [[Central processing unit|CPU cores]].&lt;ref name="IP-20140614" /&gt; The peak memory usage was approximately 25 TB of RAM.&lt;ref name="IP-20140614" /&gt; A total of 136 snapshots were saved over the course of the simulation, totaling over 230 TB cumulative data volume.&lt;ref name="ARX-20140514" /&gt;

A code called "Arepo" was used to run the Illustris simulations. It was written by Volker Springel, the same author as the [[GADGET]] code. The name is derived from the [[Sator Square]]. This code solves the coupled equations of [[gravity]] and [[hydrodynamics]] using a [[discretization]] of space based on a moving [[Voronoi diagram|Voronoi tessellation]]. It is optimized for running on large, distributed memory supercomputers using a [[Message Passing Interface|MPI]] approach. The core galaxy formation model of Illustris and IllustrisTNG has been developed by Mark Vogelsberger&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vogelsberger|first=Mark|last2=Genel|first2=Shy|last3=Sijacki|first3=Debora|last4=Torrey|first4=Paul|last5=Springel|first5=Volker|last6=Hernquist|first6=Lars|date=2013-10-23|title=A model for cosmological simulations of galaxy formation physics|url=https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/436/4/3031/984888|journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society|language=en|volume=436|issue=4|pages=3031–3067|doi=10.1093/mnras/stt1789|issn=1365-2966}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Public data release===
In April, 2015 (eleven months after the first papers were published) the project team publicly released all data products from all simulations.&lt;ref name="ARX-150400362"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Nelson, D. |author2=Pillepich, A. |author3=Genel, S. |author4=Vogelsberger, M. |author5=Springel, V. |author6=Torrey, P. |author7=Rodriguez-Gomez, V. |author8=Sijacki, D. |author9=Snyder, G.

This includes group catalogs of individual halos and subhalos, merger trees tracking these objects through time, full snapshot particle data at 135 distinct time points, and various supplementary data catalogs. In addition to direct data download, a web-based API allows for many common search and [[data extraction]] tasks to be completed without needing access to the full data sets.

==IllustrisTNG==
As a followup effort to Illustris, the [http://www.tng-project.org/ IllustrisTNG project] ("the next generation") was first presented in July, 2017. First, a new physical model was developed, which among other features now includes [[Magnetohydrodynamics]]. Three simulations are planned, which are different volumes at different resolutions. The intermediate simulation (TNG100) is equivalent to the original Illustris simulation.

'''''Inspector America''''' is a television series produced by Original Productions and distributed and shown on [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]]. The show premiered on April 17, 2011.

''Inspector America'' is hosted by [[Timothy Galarnyk]], an [[Safety engineering|infrastructure safety]] specialist.  Each week, Galarnyk travels to a different U.S. city to inspect the current state of the city's infrastructure, including bridges, tunnels, utilities, and other public works. Timothy frequently interviews citizens of that city, such as the people that survived the Minnesota Bridge Collapse. He reports what he finds to the city, sometimes by taking the officials with him.

'''Irradiation''' is the process by which an object is exposed to [[radiation]]. The exposure can originate from various sources, including natural sources. Most frequently the term refers to [[ionizing radiation]], and to a level of radiation that will serve a specific purpose, rather than radiation [[exposure (radiation)|exposure]] to normal levels of [[background radiation]]. The term irradiation usually excludes the exposure to non-ionizing radiation, such as [[infrared]], [[visible light]], [[microwave]]s from [[cellular phone]]s or [[electromagnetic wave]]s emitted by radio and TV receivers and power supplies.

==Applications==

===Sterilization===

If administered at appropriate levels, all forms of [[ionizing radiation]] can [[sterilization (microbiology)|sterilize]] objects, including medical instruments, disposables such as [[syringe]]s, and [[Food irradiation|sterilize food]].  Ionizing radiation ([[electron beam processing|electron beams]], [[X-rays]] and [[gamma rays]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.food.gov.uk/safereating/rad_in_food/irradfoodqa/ |title=Food Standards Agency - Irradiated food |accessdate=2008-01-26 |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt; may be used to kill bacteria in food or other organic material, including blood.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} [[Food irradiation]], while effective, is seldom used due to problems with public acceptance.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/02/business/02irradiate.html "Spinach and Peanuts, With a Dash of Radiation"] article by [[Andrew Marin]] in ''[[The New York Times]]''  February 1, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medicine===

Irradiation is used in [[diagnostic imaging]], [[radiation therapy|cancer therapy]] and [[blood transfusion]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://hospital.blood.co.uk/media/28302/160509-27091-irradiated-blood-blc6082p-final.pdf "Information for patients needing irradiated blood"] by [[National Blood Service]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 researchers found that irradiation was successful in the novel [[theranostic]] technique involving co-treatment with [[heptamethine dyes]] to elucidate tumor cells and attenuate their growth with minimal side effects.&lt;ref name=Tan&gt;Tan X, Luo S, Wang D, et al.  A NIR heptamethine Dye with intrinsic cancer targeting, imaging and photosynthesizing properties. Journal of Biomaterials China. 33-7 (2011), pp. 2230-2239.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Fpene&gt;F. Pene, E. Courtine, A. Cariou, J.P. Mira.  Toward theranostics.  Crit Care Med, 37 (2009), pp. S50–S58&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ion implantation===
{{Main|Ion implantation}}

Ion irradiation is routinely used to implant impurities [[atom]]s into materials, especially
[[semiconductor]]s, to modify their properties. This process, usually known
as [[ion implantation]], is an important step in the manufacture of silicon [[integrated circuit]]s.

===Ion irradiation===

Ion irradiation means in general using particle [[Particle accelerator|accelerator]]s to shoot energetic ions on a material.
[[Ion implantation]] is a variety of ion irradiation, as is [[swift heavy ions]] irradiation from [[particle accelerators]] induces [[ion tracks]] that can be used for [[nanotechnology]].

===Industrial chemistry===

Irradiation can be used to [[cross-link]] [[plastics]] or to improve material qualities of [[semi-precious stones]]. Due to its efficiency, [[electron beam processing]] is often used in the irradiation treatment of polymer-based products to improve their mechanical, thermal, and chemical properties, and often to add unique properties. [[Cross-linked polyethylene]] pipe (PEX), high-temperature products such as tubing and gaskets, wire and cable jacket curing, curing of composite materials, and crosslinking of tires are a few examples.

===Security===

During the [[2001 anthrax attacks]], the [[US Postal Service]] [[irradiated mail]] to protect members of the US government and other possible targets.  This was of some concern to people who send digital media through the mail, including artists. According to the ART in Embassies program, "incoming mail is irradiated, and the process destroys slides, transparencies and disks."{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

After its discovery by Lewis Stadler at the [[University of Missouri]], irradiation of [[seed]] and plant [[germplasm]] has resulted in creating many widely-grown [[cultivars]] of [[food crop]]s worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ahloowalia |first=B.S. |last2=Maluszynski |first2=M. |last3=Nichterlein |first3=K. |date=2004 |title=Global impact of mutation-derived varieties |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/B:EUPH.0000014914.85465.4f |journal=Euphytica |volume=135 |issue=2 |pages=187–204 |doi=10.1023/B:EUPH.0000014914.85465.4f |access-date=2017-02-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The process, which consists of striking plant seeds or germplasm with radiation in the form of [[X-ray]]s, [[UV radiation|UV waves]], [[ion beam|heavy-ion beams]], or [[gamma ray]]s, essentially "mixes" the genes already existing in the [[genome]].  The UN has been an active participant through the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]].  Irradiation is also employed to prevent the sprouting of certain [[cereal]]s, [[onion]]s, [[potato]]es and [[garlic]].&lt;ref&gt;Bly, J.H. "Electron Beam Processing", Yardley, PA: International Information Associates, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;  Appropriate irradiation doses are also used to produce insects for use in the [[sterile insect technique]] of pest control.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-ididas.iaea.org/IDIDAS/default.htm International Database on Insect Disinfestation and Sterilization], Joint FAO/IAEA Division of Nuclear Techniques in Food and Agriculture website, [[Food and Agriculture Organization|Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations]], plus the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]].&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Food irradiation}}

The [[U.S. Department of Agriculture]]'s (USDA) Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) recognizes irradiation as an important technology to [[food safety|protect consumers]]. Fresh [[meat]] and [[poultry]] including whole or cut up birds, skinless poultry, [[pork chop]]s, [[roast]]s, [[stew meat]], liver, [[hamburger]]s, [[ground meat]], and ground poultry are approved for irradiation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130105210704/http://www.fsis.usda.gov/Fact_Sheets/Irradiation_and_Food_Safety/index.asp Irradiation and Food Safety], U.S. Drug and Food Administration. Retrieved Jan. 5, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Assassination===

Some claim that [[Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej]], who died of lung cancer in Bucharest on March 19, 1965, was intentionally irradiated during a visit to Moscow, due to his political stance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thefinalphaseforum.invisionzone.com/lofiversion/index.php/t1487-50.html|title=TFP &gt; Alexander Litvinenko Assassination|accessdate=2009-10-18|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110701081808/http://thefinalphaseforum.invisionzone.com/lofiversion/index.php/t1487-50.html|archivedate=2011-07-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, an article in [[Der Spiegel]] alleged that the East German [[Stasi|MfS]] intentionally irradiated political prisoners with high-dose radiation, possibly to provoke cancer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-13395385.html ''STASI: In Kopfhöhe ausgerichtet.''] Article by Peter Wensierski in [[Der Spiegel]] 20/1999, May 17, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jf-archiv.de/archiv00/160yy47.htm ''Tödliche Strahlung. Die Staatssicherheit der DDR steht im Verdacht, Regimegegner radioaktiv verseucht zu haben.''] Article by Paul Leonhard in ''Junge Freiheit'' April 14, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alexander Litvinenko]], a secret serviceman who was tackling organized crime in Russia, was intentionally poisoned with Po-210; the very large internal doses of radiation he received caused his death.

The '''Jewish-Palestinian Living Room Dialogue Group''' is a [[Nonviolent Communication|non-violent]] [[conflict resolution]] group established in 1992 in [[San Mateo, California]]. Its first meeting was held in a local neighborhood residence. As of January 2018, the group remained active and continued to meet monthly in members' homes.&lt;ref name="JP20Y"&gt;Jewish-Palestinian dialogue group still going strong after 20 years – by alix wall, j. correspondent In j., the Jewish news weekly of Northern California – Thursday, December 13, 2012 – [http://www.jweekly.com/article/full/67286/jewish-palestinian-dialogue-group-still-going-strong-after-20-years]&lt;/ref&gt;  The one-to-one, face-to-face method of [[conflict resolution]], modeled by this dialogue group, was increasingly looked to globally by educators, researchers, journalists, activists, trainers, and strategists including the [[U.S. Department of State]], which distributes the dialogue group's instructive films in Africa.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://vimeo.com/113065533|title=DIALOGUE IN NIGERIA: Muslims &amp; Christians Creating Their Future  (65 min)|work=Vimeo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of the group have initiated and provided facilitation support at seminars, conferences&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://traubman.igc.org/light2014.htm|title=Palestinian Jewish Dialogue Season of Light Three Continent Video Bridge – 2014|work=igc.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oneworldlights.net/news/archives/2154|title=OWL Global Wisdom Circle – 4/14/2015Listening to the Enemy|work=One World Lights}}&lt;/ref&gt; and youth gatherings,&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; created both printed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://traubman.igc.org/dialoguecommunication.htm|title=Dialogue communication graphics Arabic Hebrew French English listening peacebuilding reconciliation education|work=igc.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and video&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://vimeo.com/15811594|title=ABRAHAM'S VISION Graduation Day! – Muslim &amp; Jewish youth learning together – 2010  (40 min)|work=Vimeo}}&lt;/ref&gt; facilitation guidelines, and responded to requests for media interviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ac360.blogs.cnn.com/2008/10/16/palestinians-jews-engaging-and-creating/|title=Palestinians, Jews engaging and creating|work=cnn.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kalw.org/term/jewish-palestinian-dialogue|title=Jewish-Palestinian Dialogue|work=kalw.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://icermediation.com/2013/09/28/the-citizen-to-citizen-public-peace-process-icerm-radio-program-with-libby-and-len-traubman/|title=The Citizen-To-Citizen Public Peace Process – ICERM Radio Program with Libby and Len Traubman – International Center for Ethno-Religious Mediation|work=International Center for Ethno-Religious Mediation}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://vimeo.com/128067221|title=Jewish-Palestinian Living Room Dialogue – Archival TV news (April 2002 – 10 min)|work=Vimeo}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Interest in their work increased in national media during the 2000 [[Second Intifada|Intifada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://vimeo.com/128069808|title=Jewish-Palestinian Living Room Dialogue – Archival TV news (October 2000 – 4 min)|work=Vimeo}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://vimeo.com/128078593|title=Jewish-Palestinian Living Room Dialogue – Archival local ABC news (October 2000 – 3 min)|work=Vimeo}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://vimeo.com/128079853|title=Jewish-Palestinian Living Room Dialogue – Archival local NBC news (October 2000 – 3 min)|work=Vimeo}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The group co-founders gave the 2017 Commencement Address at Notre Dame de Namur University,&lt;ref&gt;[[Notre Dame de Namur University]]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;http://www.ndnu.edu/media-center/libby-and-len-traubman-commencement-2017/&lt;/ref&gt;"STORIES OF CHANGE: Creating a Culture of Connection in The Citizens’ Century".&lt;ref&gt;http://traubman.igc.org/ndnu2017address.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beginnings==
Initial incentive to form the dialogue group came from [[Peaceful coexistence|coexistence]] models of the 1980s in the Middle East and Africa. Examples are: [[Neve Shalom| Neve Shalom ~ Wahat as-Salam]] (Oasis of Peace), a village where Jewish and Palestinian Israeli families live and learn together, and Koinonia Southern Africa,&lt;ref name="OPLNF"&gt;Dale Martin, "Old-fashioned Potlucks Lead to New Friendships", The Times, San Mateo, California, March 29, 1991, [http://traubman.igc.org/koinonia.htm Mirror of article]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Libby and Len Traubman, Remembering our roots in Koinonia Southern Africa, [http://traubman.igc.org/koinoniastory.htm Website article]&lt;/ref&gt; founded by [[Nico Smith|Reverend Nico Smith]] during [[Apartheid in South Africa|apartheid]] years, which gathered thousands of Blacks and Whites together to share meals and stories, sometimes in public at risk to their lives.  Both initiatives were honored together during the San Francisco 1989 [[Beyond War]] Award Ceremony.&lt;ref name="BWAC1989-Video"&gt;Beyond War Award – 1989 – Neve Shalom~Wahat al-Salam – Carter Center – Koinonia Southern Africa [https://archive.org/details/BeyondWarAward-1989-NeveShalomwahatAl-salamTheCarterCenter Free Video]&lt;/ref&gt;  The word [[Koinonia]] means "belonging together" or "communion by intimate participation"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ancientroadpublications.com/Studies/BiblicalStudies/FellowshipintheGospel.html|title="Fellowship in the Gospel" : A Study of the Greek Word Koinonia|work=ancientroadpublications.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several members of this dialogue group have deep roots in the principles and educational tradition of the [[Beyond War]] movement of the 1980s, which was succeeded by the Foundation for Global Community, the group's first fiscal sponsor.&lt;ref&gt;http://globalcommunity.org/fgcHistory.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Fiscal oversight support was later provided by the [[Peninsula Conflict Resolution Center]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcrcweb.org/people/|title=Community Partners – Peninsula Conflict Resolution Center|work=pcrcweb.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, several of the dialogue group founders, who had worked with the [[Beyond War|Beyond War Foundation]] and the Stanford Center on Conflict and Negotiation, brought together Palestinian and Israeli citizen leaders who forged and signed the '' "Framework for a Public Peace Process" ''.&lt;ref name="FWPPP"&gt;Stanford Center on International Conflict and Negotiation, [[Beyond War|Beyond War Foundation]], ''FRAMEWORK FOR A PUBLIC PEACE PROCESS: Toward a Peaceful Israeli-Palestinian Relationship'', 1991. [http://traubman.igc.org/ppp.pdf PDF]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Living Room Dialogue model==

[[Image:LivingRoomDialogueGroup.jpg|300px|right|thumbnail|Jewish-Palestinian Living Room Dialogue Group]]
Engaging in [[peacebuilding]], the early [[Muslim]], [[Jewish]], and [[Christian]] women and men participants in the dialogue group were determined to export solutions, rather than import problems. They intended to create a people-intensive—not money-intensive—easily reproducible, in-home model to parallel and compliment the government [[Peace process in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict|peace process in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict]] as well as in other regions of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newerasupportfoundation.org/exploring-faiths|title=New Era Educational and Charitable Support Foundation –        Exploring Faiths|work=New Era Educational and Charitable Support Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1993, government negotiators were clarifying their own plea for mandatory citizen participation and the need for the creativity of People-to-People Programs, as found in Annex VI of the 1993 Oslo Accords.&lt;ref name="GuideToPeaceProcess"&gt;THE ISRAELI-PALESTINIAN INTERIM AGREEMENT ON THE WEST BANK AND THE GAZA STRIP, Annex VI, Protocol Concerning Israeli-Palestinian Cooperation Programs, 1999, [http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Peace+Process/Guide+to+the+Peace+Process/THE+ISRAELI-PALESTINIAN+INTERIM+AGREEMENT+-+Annex+VI.htm Website Page]&lt;/ref&gt;

As designed, the living room dialogue group format gives dynamic form to the emerging paradigm of people-centered [[human security]] that challenges traditional notions of government-centered [[national security]] and is focused on sustained state, regional, and global stability.

==Means of change==
Change is viewed by the dialogue group in [[Binary number|binary]] terms—a "no" component and a "yes" component. While defining the "no" component—what is wrong, disintegrating, and in need of correction—the dialogue's larger intention is to embody and paint a picture of the "yes," The intent is to focus less on the old and the obsolete—what does not work—and more on modeling the new, the "yes" component that works for the good of all. The dialogue group's ongoing experience is that change begins in small circles of local innovators and [[Cultural creatives|Culture Creatives]].

The means of [[Communication]] to strengthen relationships, release creativity, and effect change is [[Dialogue]], with its quality of [[Listening]] for [[Learning]].  While the action of dialogue is designed to deepen and enhance circles of relationships, it is not to be mistaken for safe, casual [[Conversation]] or adversarial, win-lose Debate.  Furthermore, this type of dialogue's contribution to [[Conflict transformation|Conflict Transformation]] is not in [[Conflict resolution|Conflict Resolution]] or [[Deliberation]].  Rather this type of dialogue is used to introduce, familiarize, humanize, dignify, and empathize with all the people in the room, so that [[Conflict resolution|Conflict Resolution]] and [[Deliberation]] can then take place on a solid foundation. In particular, the dialogue process begins with exploring each person's life [[narrative]], because in many cases "an enemy is one whose story we have not heard".  A beneficial outcome of this type of dialogue is a reduction in the widespread humiliation and [[rankism]] on Earth as defined by [[Robert W. Fuller]].

This [[Track II diplomacy|Track II Diplomacy]] approach is not a quick fix but requires time, and thus is rightfully referred to as Sustained Dialogue,&lt;ref&gt; https://sustaineddialogue.org/our-approach/&lt;/ref&gt; as defined by [[Harold H. Saunders|Dr. Harold H. (Hal) Saunders]].  Useful practices of this [[cross-cultural communication]] continue to improve, drawing from the best of [[Bohm Dialogue]], [[Interfaith dialogue|Interfaith Dialogue]], and the ongoing global [[Dialogue Among Civilizations]].

==Activities==
The contributions made by this dialogue group to the expanding effort to choose conversation over conflict were recognized in the Directory of Arab/Jewish/Palestinian Dialogue Groups published by the Center for Restorative Justice and Peacemaking at the University of Minnesota.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cehd.umn.edu/ssw/RJP/Projects/Palestinian-Israeli-Connection/Directory_Arab_Jewish_Palestinian_Dialogue_Groups.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Always seeking to expand the network, participants in this Dialogue Group communicate daily face-to-face and by e-mail, [[telephone]], and [[Skype]] with citizens worldwide to encourage new groups and provide both graphic and written how-to guidelines (pdf).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=how-to guidelines|url=http://traubman.igc.org/changechartsall.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; This dialogue group regularly publishes e-mail reports on the global success stories regarding the expanding public peace process.&lt;ref&gt;What Others Are Doing: E-mail Reports About Successful Palestinian-Jewish and Interfaith Relationship Building Activities [http://traubman.igc.org/messages.htm Website Page]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Creating and Distributing Educational Tools and Instruction Guides===
The dialogue method draws on the wisdom of [[Elie Wiesel]]:  "People become the stories they hear and the stories they tell."  Dialogue-initiated [[peacebuilding]] successes are documented in film and other tools of [[education]] that are available for [[community building]]. Documents created by the group and freely distributed for use by others include: Palestinian &amp; Jewish Recipes for Peace,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://traubman.igc.org/recipes.htm|title=Palestinian &amp; Jewish Recipes for Peace – Middle East Israeli Arabic Food Cookbook Holiday Gift|work=igc.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Camp Activities for Relationship Building (pdf),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Camp Activities for Relationship Building|url=http://traubman.igc.org/campacts.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Public Peace Process of Change (pdf),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Public Peace Process of Change|url=http://traubman.igc.org/changechartsall.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; MEETING MOHAMMED: Beginning Jewish-Palestinian Dialogue (pdf),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MEETING MOHAMMED: Beginning Jewish-Palestinian Dialogue|url=http://traubman.igc.org/MeetingMohammedEng.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; STORY AS ENTRY TO RELATIONSHIP: Teacher's Guide (pdf),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=STORY AS ENTRY TO RELATIONSHIP: Teacher's Guide|url=http://traubman.igc.org/vidschoolguide.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; ENGAGING THE OTHER: Teacher's Guide (pdf)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ENGAGING THE OTHER: Teacher's Guide|url=http://traubman.igc.org/engagingtheother.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also see related Theses and documents of others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=related theses and documents of others|url=http://traubman.igc.org/theses.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The dialogue also maintains a web resource page referencing multi-lingual graphics that can be used by other groups wanting to use dialogue as a communication tool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.masterpeace.org/blogs/post/useful_graphics_on_change_communication_and_relationships_of_peacebuilding|title=USEFUL MULTI-LINGUAL GRAPHICS for Change, Communication, and Relationships of Peacebuilding|work=masterpeace.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:From 2003–2007, the dialogue group partnered with [[Camp Tawonga]] to bring hundreds of Muslim, Jewish and Christian, elders, adults, and youth from 50 different towns in [[State of Palestine|Palestine]] and [[Israel]] to successfully live together and communicate with each other at the Palestinian-Jewish Family Peacemakers Camp—Oseh Shalom – Sanea al-Salam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishjournal.com/education/article/jews_and_palestinians_talk_peace_under_norcal_pines_20071102|title=Jews and Palestinians talk peace under NorCal pines – Education|work=Jewish Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/TUOLUMNE-COUNTY-Peaceful-setting-intense-2470022.php|title=TUOLUMNE COUNTY / Peaceful setting, intense dialogue|work=SFGate}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6j8ANQhpelI|title=Peacemakers Camp News – 2005|date=April 15, 2010|work=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://traubman.igc.org/camp2006radio.mp3&lt;/ref&gt;

:Participants included former armed combatants from both sides of the conflict. The attendees worked together to transcend stereotypes in an effort to dignify one another and demonstrate what peaceful, face to face coexistence looks like.  Participants returned to the Middle East to begin or expand their own successful relationship-building initiatives including: Arava Institute for Environmental Studies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arava.org/|title=Arava Institute for Environmental Studies – The premier environmental studies and research program in the Middle East|work=arava.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Givat Haviva,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.givathaviva.org/|title=Givat Haviva – The Center for a Shared Society|author=Simply-Smart|work=givathaviva.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interfaith Encounter Association,&lt;ref&gt;http://interfaith-encounter.org/&lt;/ref&gt; Combatants for Peace,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cfpeace.org/|title=Combatants For Peace|work=cfpeace.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neve Shalom~Wahat al-Salam,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nswas.com/|title=Oasis of Peace|work=Oasis of Peace}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nir School of the Heart,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nirschool.org/|title=Welcome to NIR School|work=nirschool.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peace Child Israel, and&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mideastweb.org/peacechild/|title=Peacechild Israel|work=mideastweb.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sulha Peace Project.&lt;ref&gt;Sulha Peace Project&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4694">The '''Master suppression techniques''' is a framework articulated in 1945 by the [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[psychologist]] and [[philosopher]] [[Ingjald Nissen]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Ingjald Nissen]], ''Psykopatenes diktatur'' 1945.&lt;/ref&gt; These techniques identified by Nissen are ways to indirectly suppress and humiliate opponents. In the late 1970s the framework was popularized by [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[Social psychology|social psychologist]] [[Berit Ås]],&lt;ref name="kjerringrad"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ås |first=Berit |authorlink=Berit Ås|title=Hersketeknikker |journal=Kjerringråd |issue=1978:3  |pages=17–21 |location=Oslo |issn=0800-0565}}&lt;/ref&gt; who reduced Nissen's original nine means to five. Master suppression techniques are defined as strategies of social [[Crowd manipulation|manipulation]] by which a dominant group maintains such a position in a (established or unexposed) [[hierarchy]]. They are very prominent in Scandinavian scholarly and public debate, where the expression is also used to refer to types of social manipulation not part of Ås's framework.&lt;ref name="chef"&gt;{{cite web|last=Andrén |first=Maria |title=Så hanterar du skitsnacket |work=Chef |publisher=Ledarna |date=2008-03-11 |url=http://www.chef.se/dynamisk/index.php/ur_chef/senaste_numret_details/sa-hanterar-du-skitsnack/188651.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120525084338/http://www.chef.se/dynamisk/index.php/ur_chef/senaste_numret_details/sa-hanterar-du-skitsnack/188651.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-05-25 |accessdate=2009-12-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Master suppression techniques are sometimes called '''domination techniques'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/justice_home/daphnetoolkit/files/projects/2002_181/int_domination_techniques_norway.pdf|title=Domination techniques: what they are and how to combat them|publisher=The Centre for Gender Equality, Norway|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20121025075341/http://ec.europa.eu/justice_home/daphnetoolkit/files/projects/2002_181/int_domination_techniques_norway.pdf   |archive-date = 2012-10-25 | date=April 2001|pages=12|format=pdf|accessdate=2010-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Five master suppression techniques according to Ås==
===Making invisible===
To silence or otherwise [[marginalize]] persons in opposition by ignoring them

===Ridicule===
{{see also|Appeal to ridicule}}
In a manipulative way to portray the arguments of, or their opponents themselves, in a [[Appeal to ridicule|ridiculing]] fashion


===Withhold information===
To exclude a person from the decision making process, or knowingly not forwarding information so as to make the person less able to make an informed choice


===Double bind===
{{see also|Double bind}}
To punish or otherwise belittle the actions of a person, regardless of how they act


===Heap blame or put to shame===
To embarrass someone, or to insinuate that they are themselves to blame for their position

==Later additions by Ås==
Berit Ås has since added two supplementary master suppression techniques.&lt;ref name="womeninwhite"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ås|first=Berit|authorlink=Berit Ås|editor-last=Evengård|editor-first=Birgitta|title=Women In White: The European Outlook|year=2004|publisher=Stockholm City Council|location=Stockholm|isbn=91-631-5716-0|pages=78–83|chapter=The Five Master Suppression Techniques}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Objectifying===
{{see also|Objectification}}
To discuss the appearance of one or several persons in a situation where it is irrelevant

===Force or threat of force===
To threaten with or use one's physical strength towards one or several persons

==Countermeasures against master suppression techniques==
A group of PhD students at Stockholm University&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jamstallt.se/docs/ENSU%20bekraftartekniker.pdf  ENSU, Empowerment-Nätverket vid Stockholms Universitet (2004) ”Bekräftartekniker och motstrategier - sätt att bemöta maktstrukturer och förändra sociala klimat.”, 2010-07-01]&lt;/ref&gt; has formulated five ''counter strategies'':
* Take place
* Questioning
* The cards on the table
* Break the pattern
* Intellectualise

They have also formulated five ''confirmation techniques'':
* Visualizing
* Adherence
* Inform
* Double reward
* Confirm reasonable standards


The [[Centre for Gender Equality]] in Norway has also published an article about how to combat this phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;[https://organizingforpower.files.wordpress.com/2009/03/forms-of-domination.pdf Domination techniques: what they are and how to combat them]&lt;/ref&gt;

The microbes can be chosen for their natural colours, or can be [[genetic engineering|engineered]] to express [[fluorescent protein]]s and viewed under [[ultraviolet light]] to make them fluoresce in colour.

==Methods==

[[Agar plate]]s are used as a canvas, while pigmented or [[Fluorescent protein|fluorescent]] [[bacteria]] and [[yeast]]s represent the paint. In order to preserve a piece of microbial art after a sufficient incubation, the microbe culture is sealed with [[epoxy]].&lt;ref name=Palermo2015/&gt;

Microbe species can be chosen for their natural colours to form a palette for the artwork. Suitable species of bacteria (with their colours) include ''[[Bacillus subtilis]]'' (cream to brown), ''[[Chromobacterium violaceum]]'' (violet), ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' (colourless), ''[[Micrococcus luteus]]'' (yellow), ''[[Micrococcus roseus]]'' (pink), ''[[Proteus mirabilis]]'', ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]'' (brown), ''[[Pseudomonas fluorescens]]'' (naturally blue-green [[fluorescent]] with [[pyoverdine]]), ''[[Serratia marcescens]]'' (pink or orange), ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'' (yellow), and ''[[Vibrio fischeri]]'' ([[bioluminescent]]).&lt;ref name=species&gt;{{cite web |title=Meet the Microbes |url=http://www.microbialart.com/microbes/ |publisher=Microbial Art |accessdate=12 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Yeast]] species – which are [[fungi]] – used include ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'' (yellow-white) ''[[Aspergillus flavus]]'' (yellow-green spores), ''[[Aspergillus ochraceus]]'' (yellow), ''[[Aureobasidium pullulans]]'' (black), ''[[Candida albicans]]'' (whitish buff), ''[[Candida sake]]'', ''[[Candida (fungus)|Candida]]'' sp. (whitish), ''[[Cladosporium herbarum]]'' (brown to black), ''[[Cladosporium resinae]]'', ''[[Epicoccum nigrum]]'' (yellow, orange, red, brown, and black), ''[[Fusarium]]'' sp., ''[[Rhodotorula]]'' sp., and ''[[Scopulariopsis brevicaulis]]''.&lt;ref name=species/&gt;{{efn|The colour shown by the micro-organisms also depends on the [[Growth_medium|medium]] used.}}

[[Protist]] species used include ''[[Euglena gracilis]]'' ([[photosynthetic]], green) and ''[[Physarum polycephalum]]'' (yellow-green).&lt;ref name=species/&gt;

A technique called "bacteriography" involves selectively killing certain areas of a bacterial culture with [[radiation]], in order to produce artistic patterns. After incubation, the culture is sealed with [[acrylic resin|acrylic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/32910/title/Bacteriography/ |title=Bacteriography |last=Mole |first=Beth Marie |date=19 October 2012 |website=The Scientist |publisher=LabX Media Group |access-date=9 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artists==

[[Alexander Fleming]], the man most commonly credited with the discovery of [[penicillin]], was known for creating germ paintings.&lt;ref name=Fleming/&gt;

The biochemist [[Roger Tsien]] won the 2008 [[Nobel prize]] for chemistry for his contributions to knowledge of [[green fluorescent protein]] (GFP). A researcher in his laboratory, Nathan Shaner, made a 2006 microbial artwork using GFP of a San Diego beach scene.&lt;ref name="Nature"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cressey|first1=Daniel|title=Roger Tsien’s legacy: The creations that lit up biology|url=http://www.nature.com/news/roger-tsien-s-legacy-the-creations-that-lit-up-biology-1.20532|publisher=Nature|accessdate=12 December 2016|date=1 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Minimum viable population''' ('''MVP''') is a [[lower bound]] on the population of a species, such that it can survive in the wild.  This term is used in the fields of [[biological sciences|biology]], [[ecology]], and [[conservation biology]]. More specifically, MVP is the smallest possible size at which a biological population can exist without facing extinction from natural disasters or demographic, environmental, or genetic [[stochastic]]ity.&lt;ref name="Holsinger2007"&gt;{{cite web|last=Holsinger |first=Kent |date=2007-09-04 |title=Types of Stochastic Threats |work=EEB310: Conservation Biology |publisher=University of Connecticut |url=http://darwin.eeb.uconn.edu/eeb310/lecture-notes/small-populations/node4.html |accessdate=2007-11-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120023317/http://darwin.eeb.uconn.edu/eeb310/lecture-notes/small-populations/node4.html |archivedate=2008-11-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "population" rarely refers to an entire species. For example, the undomesticated [[dromedary]] camel is extinct in its natural wild habitat; however, there is a domestic population in captivity and [[Australian feral camel|an additional feral population]] in [[Australia]]. Two groups of [[house cat]]s in separate houses which are not allowed outdoors are also technically distinct populations. Typically, however, MVP is used to refer solely to a wild population, such as the [[red wolf]].

==Estimation==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2015}}
Minimum viable population is usually estimated as the population size necessary to ensure between 90 and 95 percent probability of survival between 100 and 1,000 years into the future. The MVP can be estimated using [[computer simulation]]s for [[population viability analysis|population viability analyses]] (PVA). PVA models populations using demographic and environmental information to project future [[population dynamics]]. The probability assigned to a PVA is arrived at after repeating the environmental simulation thousands of times.

For example, for a theoretical simulation of a population of 50 giant pandas in which the simulated population goes completely extinct, 30 out of 100 stochastic simulations projected 100 years into the future are not viable. Causes of extinction in the simulation may include [[inbreeding depression]], [[natural disaster]], or [[climate change]]. Extinction occurring in 30 out of 100 runs would give a survival probability of 70%. In contrast, in the same simulation with a starting population of 60 pandas, the panda population may only become extinct in four of the hundred runs, resulting in a survival probability of 96%. In this case the minimum viable population that satisfies the 90- to 95% probability for survival is between 50 and 60 pandas. (These figures have been invented for the purpose of this example.)

MVP does not take external intervention into account. Thus, it is useful for conservation managers and environmentalists; a population may be increased above the MVP using a captive breeding program, or by bringing other members of the species in from other reserves.

There is naturally some debate on the accuracy of PVAs, since a wide variety of assumptions generally are required for future forecasting; however, the important consideration is not absolute accuracy, but promulgation of the concept that each species indeed has an MVP, which at least can be approximated for the sake of conservation biology and [[Biodiversity Action Plan]]s.&lt;ref name="Shaffer1981"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Shaffer ML |year=1981 |title=Minimum population sizes for species conservation |journal=[[BioScience]] |volume=31 |issue=2 |pages=131–134 |doi=10.2307/1308256 |jstor=1308256}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a [[Inbreeding depression#Example taxa not subject to significant inbreeding depression|marked trend]] for [[island|insularity]], surviving [[genetic bottleneck]]s and [[r-strategy]] to allow far lower MVPs than average. Conversely, taxa easily affected by inbreeding depression – having high MVPs – are often decidedly [[K-strategist]]s, with low [[population densities]] while occurring over a wide range. An MVP of 500 to 1,000 has often been given as an average for terrestrial vertebrates when inbreeding or genetic variability is ignored.&lt;ref name="Lehmkuhl1984"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF01866938 |author=Lehmkuhl J |year=1984 |title=Determining size and dispersion of minimum viable populations for land management planning and species conservation |journal=Environmental Management |volume=8 |issue=2 |pages=167–176}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Thomas1990"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1523-1739.1990.tb00295.x |author=Thomas CD |year=1990 |title=What do real population dynamics tell us about minimum viable population sizes? |journal=Conservation Biology |volume=4 |issue=3 |pages=324–327}}&lt;/ref&gt; When inbreeding effects are included, estimates of MVP for many species are in the thousands.

A '''network analyzer''' is an instrument that measures the [[Two-port network|network parameters]] of [[electrical network]]s. Today, network analyzers commonly measure [[scattering parameters|s&amp;ndash;parameters]] because [[Signal reflection|reflection]] and [[Transmission line|transmission]] of electrical networks are easy to measure at high frequencies, but there are other network parameter sets such as [[y-parameters]], [[z-parameters]], and [[Two-port network#Hybrid parameters (h-parameters)|h-parameters]]. Network analyzers are often used to characterize [[two-port network]]s such as amplifiers and filters, but they can be used on networks with an arbitrary number of [[Port (circuit theory)|ports]].

==Overview==
Network analyzers are used mostly at high [[frequency|frequencies]]; operating frequencies can range from 5&amp;nbsp;Hz to 1.05&amp;nbsp;THz.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.keysight.com/en/pcx-x2015001/network-analyzers?nid=-32503.0&amp;cc=US&amp;lc=eng Keysight - Network Analyzers], as of 7 Jan 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Special types of network analyzers can also cover lower frequency ranges down to 1&amp;nbsp;Hz. These network analyzers can be used for example for the stability analysis of open loops or for the measurement of audio and [[Ultrasound|ultrasonic]] components.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.omicron-lab.com OMICRON Lab Vector Network Analyzer products], as of 3 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The two basic types of network analyzers are

* {{anchor|SNA}}'''scalar network analyzer''' (SNA)—measures amplitude properties only
* {{anchor|VNA}}'''vector network analyzer''' (VNA)—measures both amplitude and phase properties

A VNA is a form of RF network analyzer widely used for RF design applications.  A VNA may also be called a '''gain-phase meter''' or an '''automatic network analyzer'''. An SNA is functionally identical to a [[spectrum analyzer]] in combination with a [[tracking generator]]. {{As of|2007}}, VNAs are the most common type of network analyzers, and so references to an unqualified "network analyzer" most often mean a VNA. Three prominent VNA manufacturers are [[Keysight Technologies|Keysight]], [[Anritsu]], and [[Rohde &amp; Schwarz]].

{{anchor|MTA|LSNA}}Another category of network analyzer is the '''microwave transition analyzer''' (MTA) or '''large signal network analyzer''' (LSNA), which measure both amplitude and phase of the fundamental and harmonics. The MTA was commercialized before the LSNA, but was lacking some of the user-friendly calibration features now available with the LSNA.

==Architecture==
The basic architecture of a network analyzer involves a signal generator, a test set, one or more receivers and display. In some setups, these units are distinct instruments. Most VNAs have two test ports, permitting measurement of four S-parameters (&lt;math&gt;S_{11}\,&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;S_{21}\,&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;S_{12}\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S_{22}\,&lt;/math&gt;), but instruments with more than two ports are available commercially.

===Signal generator===

The network analyzer needs a test signal, and a [[signal generator]] or signal source will provide one. Older network analyzers did not have their own signal generator, but had the ability to control a stand-alone signal generator using, for example, a [[GPIB]] connection. Nearly all modern network analyzers have a built-in signal generator. High-performance network analyzers have two built-in sources. Two built-in sources are useful for applications such as mixer test, where one source provides the RF signal, another the LO, or [[amplifier]] [[intermodulation]] testing, where two tones are required for the test.

===Test set===

The test set takes the signal generator output and routes it to the device under test, and it routes the signal to be measured to the receivers. It often splits off a reference channel for the incident wave. In a SNA, the reference channel may go to a diode detector (receiver) whose output is sent to the signal generator's automatic level control. The result is better control of the signal generator's output and better measurement accuracy. In a VNA, the reference channel goes to the receivers; it is needed to serve as a phase reference.

Directional couplers or two resistor power dividers are used for signal separation. Some microwave test sets include the front end mixers for the receivers (e.g., test sets for HP 8510).

===Receiver===

The receivers make the measurements. A network analyzer will have one or more receivers connected to its test ports. The reference test port is usually labeled '''R''', and the primary test ports are '''A''', '''B''', '''C''',.... Some analyzers will dedicate a separate receiver to each test port, but others share one or two receivers among the ports. The '''R''' receiver may be less sensitive than the receivers used on the test ports.

For the SNA, the receiver only measures the magnitude of the signal. A receiver can be a detector diode that operates at the test frequency. The simplest SNA will have a single test port, but more accurate measurements are made when a reference port is also used. The reference port will compensate for amplitude variations in the test signal at the measurement plane. It is possible to share a single detector and use it for both the reference port and the test port by making two measurement passes.

For the VNA, the receiver measures both the magnitude and the phase of the signal. It needs a reference channel ('''R''') to determine the phase, so a VNA needs at least two receivers. The usual method down converts the reference and test channels to make the measurements at a lower frequency. The phase may be measured with a [[Quadrature detector#Quadrature detector|quadrature detector]]. A VNA requires at least two receivers, but some will have three or four receivers to permit simultaneous measurement of different parameters.

There are some VNA architectures (six-port) that infer phase and magnitude from just power measurements.

===Processor and display===

With the processed RF signal available from the receiver / detector section it is necessary to display the signal in a format that can be interpreted. With the levels of processing that are available today, some very sophisticated solutions are available in RF network analyzers. Here the reflection and transmission data is formatted to enable the information to be interpreted as easily as possible. Most RF network analyzers incorporate features including linear and logarithmic sweeps, linear and log formats, polar plots, Smith charts, etc. Trace markers, limit lines and also pass / fail criteria may also be added in many instances.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radio-electronics.com/info/t_and_m/rf-network-analyzer/circuit-operation.php RF Network Analyzer Operation &amp; Circuit]&lt;/ref&gt;

==S-parameter measurement with vector network analyzer==
[[File:vna3.png|thumb|400px|right|The basic parts of a vector network analyzer]]
A VNA is a test system that enables the RF performance of radio frequency and microwave devices to be characterised in terms of network [[scattering parameters]], or S parameters.

The diagram shows the essential parts of a typical 2-port vector network analyzer (VNA). The two ports of the [[device under test]] (DUT) are denoted port 1 (P1) and port 2 (P2). The test port connectors provided on the VNA itself are precision types which will normally have to be extended and connected to P1 and P2 using precision cables 1 and 2, PC1 and PC2 respectively and suitable connector adaptors A1 and A2 respectively.

The test frequency is generated by a variable frequency [[carrier wave|CW]] source and its power level is set using a variable [[attenuator (electronics)|attenuator]]. The position of switch SW1 sets the direction that the test signal passes through the DUT. Initially consider that SW1 is at position 1 so that the test signal is incident on the DUT at P1 which is appropriate for measuring &lt;math&gt;S_{11}\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S_{21}\,&lt;/math&gt;. The test signal is fed by SW1 to the common port of splitter 1, one arm (the reference channel) feeding a reference receiver for P1 (RX REF1) and the other (the test channel) connecting to P1 via the [[directional coupler]] DC1, PC1 and A1. The third port of DC1 couples off the power reflected from P1 via A1 and PC1, then feeding it to test receiver 1 (RX TEST1). Similarly, signals leaving P2 pass via A2, PC2 and DC2 to RX TEST2. RX REF1, RX TEST1, RX REF2 and RXTEST2 are known as [[coherence (physics)|coherent]] receivers as they share the same reference oscillator, and they are capable of measuring the test signal's amplitude ''and'' phase at the test frequency. All of the complex receiver output signals are fed to a processor which does the mathematical processing and displays the chosen parameters and format on the phase and amplitude display. The [[instantaneous]] value of phase includes both the [[Time|temporal]] and [[Three-dimensional space|spatial]] parts, but the former is removed by virtue of using 2 test channels, one as a reference and the other for measurement. When SW1 is set to position 2, the test signals are applied to P2, the reference is measured by RX REF2, reflections from P2 are coupled off by DC2 and measured by RX TEST2 and signals leaving P1 are coupled off by DC1 and measured by RX TEST1. This position is appropriate for measuring &lt;math&gt;S_{22}\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S_{12}\,&lt;/math&gt;.

==Calibration or error correction==
A network analyzer, like most electronic instruments requires periodic [[calibration]] - typically this is performed once per year and is performed by the manufacturer or by a 3rd party in a calibration laboratory. When the instrument is calibrated, it will usually have a [[sticker]] fixed to the outside, stating the date it was calibrated and when the next calibration is due. A calibration certificate will be issued.

A vector network analyzer achieves highly accurate measurements by correcting for the [[systematic error]]s in the instrument, the characteristics of cables, adapters and test fixtures. The process of error correction, although commonly just called calibration, is an entirely different process, and may be performed by an engineer several times in an [[hour]]. Sometimes it is called user-calibration, to indicate the difference from periodic calibration by a manufacturer.

A network analyzer has connectors on its front panel, but the measurements are seldom made at the front panel. Usually some test cables will connect from the front panel to the device under test (DUT). The length of those cables will introduce a time delay and corresponding phase shift (affecting VNA measurements); the cables will also introduce some attenuation (affecting SNA and VNA measurements). The same is true for cables and couplers inside the network analyzer. All these factors will change with temperature. Calibration usually involves measuring known standards and using those measurements to compensate for systematic errors, but there are methods which do not require known standards. Only systematic errors can be corrected. [[Random error]]s, such as connector repeatability can not be corrected by the user calibration. However, some portable vector network analyzers, designed for lower accuracy measurement outside using batteries, do attempt some correction for temperature by measuring the internal temperature of the network analyzer.

The first steps, prior to actually starting the user calibration are:

* Visually inspect the connectors for any problems such as bent pins or parts which are obviously off-centre. These should be thrown away, as mating damaged connectors with good connectors will often result in damaging the good connector.
* Clean the connectors with compressed air at less than 60 psi.
* If necessary clean the connectors with [[isopropyl alcohol]].
* Gage the connectors to determine there are not any gross mechanical problems. Connector gauges with resolutions of 0.001" to 0.0001" will usually be included in the better quality calibration kits.
* Torque the connectors to the specified torque. A [[torque wrench]] will be supplied with all but the cheapest calibration kits.

There are several different methods of calibration.

* SOLT : which is an acronym for Short, Open, Load, Thru, is the simplest method. As the name suggests, this requires access to known standards with a [[short circuit]], [[wiktionary:open circuit|open circuit]], a precision load (usually 50 ohms) and a through connection. It is best if the test ports have the same type of connector ([[N connector|N]], 3,5&amp;nbsp;mm etc.), but of a different sex, so the through just requires the test ports are connected together. SOLT is suitable for coaxial measurements, where it is possible to obtain the short, open, load and through. The SOLT calibration method is less suitable for [[waveguide]] measurements, where it is difficult to obtain an open circuit or a load, or for measurements on non-coaxial test fixtures, where the same problems with finding suitable standards exist.
* TRL(through-reflect-line calibration): This technique is useful for microwave, noncoaxial environments such as fixture, wafer probing, or waveguide. TRL uses a transmission line, significantly longer in electrical length than the through line, of known length and impedance as one standard. TRL also requires a high-reflection standard (usually, a short or open) whose impedance does not have to be well characterized, but it must be electrically the same for both test ports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Engen |first1=Glenn F. |last2=Hoer |first2=Cletus A. |title=Thru-reflect-line: An improved technique for calibrating the dual six-port automatic network analyzer |journal=IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques |date=1979 |volume=27.12 |page=987–993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The simplest calibration that can be performed on a network analyzer is a transmission measurement. This gives no phase information, and so gives similar data to a scalar network analyzer. The simplest calibration that can be performed on a network analyzer, whilst providing phase information is a 1-port calibration (S11 or S22, but not both). This accounts for the three systematic errors which appear in 1-port reflectivity measurements:

*Directivity—error resulting from the portion of the source signal that never reaches the DUT.
*Source match—errors resulting from multiple internal reflections between the source and the DUT.
*Reflection tracking—error resulting from all frequency dependence of test leads, connections, etc.

In a typical 1-port reflection calibration, the user measures three known standards, usually an open, a short and a known load.  From these three measurements the network analyzer can account for the three errors above.&lt;ref&gt;[http://literature.cdn.keysight.com/litweb/pdf/5965-7917E.pdf Keysight network analyzer basics] http://literature.cdn.keysight.com/litweb/pdf/5965-7917E.pdf |date=2005-12-23&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://na.support.keysight.com/pna/help/latest/S3_Cals/Errors.htm#errsys Keysight: measurement errors]&lt;/ref&gt;

A more complex calibration is a full 2-port reflectivity and transmission calibration.  For two ports there are 12 possible systematic errors analogous to the three above.  The most common method for correcting for these involves measuring a short, load and open standard on each of the two ports, as well as transmission between the two ports.

It is impossible to make a perfect short circuit, as there will always be some inductance in the short. It is impossible to make a perfect open circuit, as there will always be some fringing capacitance. A modern network analyzer will have data stored about the devices in a calibration kit. {{Harv|Keysight Technologies|2006}} For the open-circuit, this will be some electrical delay (typically tens of picoseconds), and fringing capacitance which will be frequency dependent. The capacitance is normally specified in terms of a polynomial, with the coefficients specific to each standard. A short will have some delay, and a frequency dependent inductance, although the inductance is normally considered insignificant below about 6&amp;nbsp;GHz. The definitions for a number of standards used in Keysight calibration kits can be found at http://na.support.keysight.com/pna/caldefs/stddefs.html The definitions of the standards for a particular calibration kit will often change depending on the frequency range of the network analyzer. If a calibration kit works to 9&amp;nbsp;GHz, but a particular network analyzer has a maximum frequency of operation of 3&amp;nbsp;GHz, then the capacitance of the open standard can approximated more closely up to 3&amp;nbsp;GHz, using a different set of coefficients than are necessary to work up to 9&amp;nbsp;GHz.

In some calibration kits, the data on the males is different from the females, so the user needs to specify the sex of the connector. In other calibration kits (e.g. Keysight 85033E 9&amp;nbsp;GHz 3.5&amp;nbsp;mm), the male and female have identical characteristics, so there is no need for the user to specify the sex. For sexless connectors, like [[APC-7]], this issue does not arise.

Most network analyzers will have the ability to have a user defined calibration kit. So if a user has a particular calibration kit, details of which are not in the firmware of the network analyzer, the data about the kit can be loaded into the network analyzer and so the kit used. Typically the calibration data can be entered on the instrument front panel, as well as loaded from a medium such as floppy disk or [[USB stick]], or down a bus such as [[USB]] or GPIB.

The more expensive calibration kits will usually include a torque wrench to tighten connectors properly and a connector gauge to ensure there are no gross errors in the connectors.

===Automated calibration fixtures===
A calibration using a mechanical calibration kit may take a significant amount of time. Not only must the operator sweep through all the frequencies of interest, but the operator must also disconnect and reconnect the various standards. {{Harv|Keysight Technologies|2003|p=9}} To avoid that work, network analyzers can employ automated calibration standards. {{Harv|Keysight Technologies|2003}} The operator connects one box to the network analyzer. The box has a set of standards inside and some switches that have already been characterized. The network analyzer can read the characterization and control the configuration using a digital bus such as USB.

==Network analyzer verification kits==
A number of verification kits are available to verify the network analyzer is performing to specification. These typically consist of transmission lines with an air dielectric and attenuators. The Agilent 85055A kit includes a 10&amp;nbsp;cm airline, stepped impedance airline, 20&amp;nbsp;dB and 50&amp;nbsp;dB attenuators with data on the devices measured by the manufacturer and stored on both a floppy disk and USB flash drive. Older versions of the 85055A have the data stored on tape and floppy disks rather than on USB drives.

==Noise figure measurements==
The three major manufacturers of VNAs, [[Keysight]], [[Anritsu]], and [[Rohde &amp; Schwarz]], all produce models which permit the use of noise figure measurements. The vector error correction permits higher accuracy than is possible with other forms of commercial noise figure meters.

'''Oldisleben I''' is an [[archeological]] site of the [[Eemian]] [[interglacial period]] located north of [[Weimar]] in the [[Oldisleben]] municipality, [[Germany]]. Findings at the site include some of the earliest known engravings on portable objects of bone, ivory and stone, dating back between 
135,000 and 80,000 [[Before Present|BP]].

A '''political faction''' is a group of individuals within a larger entity, such as a [[political party]], a [[trade union]] or other group, or simply a [[political climate]], united by a particular common political purpose that differs in some respect to the rest of the entity. A faction or political party may include fragmented sub-factions, "parties within a party," which may be referred to as power blocs, or voting blocs. Members of factions band together as a way of achieving these goals and advancing their agenda and position within an organisation.

Factions are not limited to political parties; they can and frequently do form within any group that has some sort of political aim or purpose.

The Latin word ''factio'' denoted originally either of the chariot teams that were organised professionally by private companies in ancient Rome, each recognisable by characteristic colour and arousing supporter hysteria similar to that in modern sports fans. These teams were not unlike gladiator schools, but the lethal nature of that entertainment meant few performers lasted long enough to build up similar crowd loyalty to the "team", while the fighters rarely actually teamed up, but rather fought duels or beasts. In time, political currents could become associated with such a team, although precisely how this happened is unclear. In Byzantine Constantinople, two such chariot factions, blue and green, repeatedly made or broke the claims of candidates to the imperial throne.

Occasionally, the term "faction" is still used more or less as a synonym for political party, but "with opprobrious sense, conveying the imputation of selfish or mischievous ends or turbulent or unscrupulous methods", according to the Oxford English Dictionary. In his Dictionary, Samuel Johnson (a [[Tory]]) dismissively defined [[Whigs (British political party)|Whig]] as "the name of a faction". Similarly, in the tenth instalment of The Federalist Papers, [[James Madison]] defines a faction as "a number of citizens, whether amounting to a minority or majority of the whole, who are united and actuated by some common impulse of passion, or of interest, adverse to the rights of other citizens, or to the permanent and aggregate interests of the community." In plain English this is a group that pursues self-interest at the expense of the greater good.

==Aims of factions==
The aims of a political faction are as diverse as the different types of bodies within which they appear. Typically, however, they include: advancing a particular [[policy]] or policy agenda, preventing the adoption of alternative policies and supporting given individuals to positions of power within the organisation or in the wider political world.  A faction can primarily be based around supporting a given person or group, or a single major aim, with little in the way of common agenda otherwise, or it can have a comprehensive and definitive set of policies.  Either way, factional politics typically revolve around personality, with a few individuals playing key roles, acting as a magnet for like-minded people, leading the activities of the faction, and acting as a prominent voice for the shared objectives of the faction. Such individuals can be referred to by a variety of names, such as “powerbrokers” or “factional chiefs”.

==Organisation==
&lt;!--Please DO NOT change the spelling of "organisation" to "organization". See [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style#National varieties of English]].--&gt;
Factions differ in the amount of organisation and internal structure they possess. On the left, these may take the form of tendencies or [[platform (European politics)|platforms]]. Most factions are very loose organisations, having no definitive list of members, but some factions, have a formal internal structure, with membership lists, regular meetings, official positions – such as negotiators, conveners, [[whip (politics)|whips]] and organisers, – and a definitive policy position on every issue affecting the broader organisation. Such factions will typically be binding; that is, they rely upon all members casting their votes in accordance with the pre-ordained official stance of the faction.

==Operation of factions==
In political organisations that are [[democracy|democratic]] in structure, factions rely heavily on securing enough votes to win important ballots. This process is sometimes referred to as “doing the numbers”. Having the numbers will allow the faction to push policies it supports and elect its members to powerful positions within the broader organisation.

If one faction develops within an organisation, there will usually be at least one other that develops in opposition to it. Opposing factions will try to match each other's level of organisation and internal discipline, but will also engage in negotiations and trade-offs to ensure that the organisation’s activities are not compromised and that every group has a chance to obtain at least some of its goals.

Key to the operation of an organised faction is the existence of a power base. This will typically be some office, division or branch of the broader organisation over which the faction has effective control. Sometimes a power base may be an external or affiliated organisation that is involved with the broader organisation in some way.

A power base serves several key functions:
* It acts as a recruitment centre for new members, and promotes homogeneity within the membership (crucial for maintaining factional cohesion);
* It can be used as an organising centre for factional events and activities;
* It functions as a springboard, advancing the career of selected factional members and allowing them to gain skills that will increase their effectiveness and clout.

==Effects of factions==
The existence of a factional system can have serious negative consequences for a political organisation.  If factional strife becomes intensive and public, the organisation may suffer from perceptions of disunity. Taken one step further, if the conflict is particularly severe, it may cause ruptures within the organisation that seriously impede its effectiveness, leading to break-up or collapse of the organisation.

To avoid harm to the organisation, factional operations are usually conducted under strong secrecy and with minimal public scrutiny. This, however, can lead to the proliferation of unethical behaviour. Warfare between the factions may lead to tactics such as ballot box-stuffing, stack-outs, membership fraud, and other generally fraudulent conduct. Individuals who abandon a faction may be subject to intense personal [[Feud|vendettas]] where their former comrades go about sabotaging their careers.  A climate of intense factional conflict can also motivate individuals to focus on attacking their factional enemies rather than furthering the broader organisation.

Despite this, the benefits of factional systems are often overlooked. It is often incomprehensible to outsiders why members of a broader organisation would engage in factionalism. This stems from the assumption that the natural factional relationship is one of conflict and strife, when in fact, factions are often able to engage in productive co-operation.

In any political organisation there are likely to be many highly opinionated and passionate people. The existence of a factional system allows its operations to be more predictable and stable. Compromise and give-and-take between factions allows the organisation to operate without having to satisfy the whims of many different, uncompromising individuals who might otherwise cause a split. So, somewhat counter-intuitively, factionalism can actually promote organisational harmony.

Factions also help to broaden and diversify the organisation’s appeal. A person who might otherwise find the organisation’s goals unattractive might be persuaded to support a faction within it whose goals are closer to their own. Just as a democratic [[government]] is often invigorated by a strong [[Parliamentary Opposition|opposition]], so having a number of distinct points-of-view with an organisation can energise it and allow it to perform its role more effectively. It is also highly unlikely that any sizeable political organisation is wholly united in purpose, so arguably factions simply represent a way of managing pre-existing differences within the organisation.

The Founding Fathers of the American constitution, explicitly warned against the dangers of party factionalism. Madison, Hamilton, and Washington expressed the belief that factions would create divides that would ultimately dismantle the government. These sentiments can be found in ''[[The Federalist Papers]]'', specifically Federalist 10 and 51 written by Madison.

'''Political science''' is a [[social science]] which deals with systems of governance, and the analysis of [[politics|political]] activities, political thoughts, and political behavior.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/political-science%20Oxford%20Dictionary:%20political%20science Oxford Dictionary: political science]{{dead link|date=March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It deals extensively with the theory and practice of politics which is commonly thought of as determining of the distribution of [[Power (social and political)|power]] and resources. Political scientists "see themselves engaged in revealing the relationships underlying political events and conditions, and from these revelations they attempt to construct general principles about the way the world of politics works."&lt;ref&gt;[http://writingcenter.unc.edu/handouts/political-science/ Political Science]. The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (22 February 1999). Retrieved on 27 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Political science -- occasionally called politicology -- comprises numerous subfields, including [[comparative politics]], [[political economy]], [[international relations]], [[political theory]], [[public administration]], [[public policy]], and [[political methodology]].  Furthermore, political science is related to, and draws upon, the fields of [[economics]], [[Legal education|law]], [[sociology]], [[history]], [[philosophy]], [[geography]], [[psychology]]/[[psychiatry]], and [[anthropology]].

Comparative politics is the science of comparison and teaching of different types of [[constitutions]], political actors, legislature and associated fields, all of them from an intrastate perspective. [[International relations]] deals with the interaction between [[nation-state]]s as well as intergovernmental and transnational organizations. Political theory is more concerned with contributions of various classical and contemporary thinkers and philosophers.

Political science is methodologically diverse and appropriates many methods originating in [[social research]]. Approaches include [[positivism]], [[Verstehen|interpretivism]], [[rational choice theory]], [[behaviouralism]], [[structuralism]], [[post-structuralism]], [[Philosophical realism|realism]], [[Historical institutionalism|institutionalism]], and pluralism. Political science, as one of the [[social science]]s, uses methods and techniques that relate to the kinds of inquiries sought: primary sources such as historical documents and official records, secondary sources such as scholarly journal articles, [[sample survey|survey]] research, [[Statistics|statistical analysis]], [[case studies]], experimental research, and model building.

==Overview==
Political scientists study matters concerning the allocation and transfer of [[Power (social and political)|power]] in [[decision making]], the roles and systems of governance including [[governments]] and [[international organizations]], political behaviour and [[public policies]]. They measure the success of [[governance]] and specific policies by examining many factors, including [[Economic stability|stability]], [[justice]], [[material wealth]],  [[peace]] and [[public health]]. Some political scientists seek to advance [[positive (social sciences)|positive]] (attempt to describe how things are, as opposed to how they should be) theses by analysing politics. Others advance [[Norm (sociology)|normative]] theses, by making specific policy recommendations.

Political scientists provide the frameworks from which journalists, special interest groups, politicians, and the [[Constituency|electorate]] analyse issues. According to Chaturvedy,
{{quote|Political scientists may serve as advisers to specific politicians, or even run for office as politicians themselves. Political scientists can be found working in governments, in political parties or as civil servants. They may be involved with [[non-governmental organizations]] (NGOs) or political movements. In a variety of capacities, people educated and trained in political science can add value and expertise to [[corporation]]s. Private enterprises such as [[think tank]]s, research institutes, polling and [[public relations]] firms often employ political scientists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chaturvedy|first1=J. C.|title=Political Governance: Political theory|publisher=Isha Books|page=4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kzV4V59udu8C&amp;pg=PA4 |accessdate=28 October 2014|isbn=9788182053175|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the United States, political scientists known as "[[American politics (political science)|Americanists]]" look at a variety of data including [[United States Constitution|constitutional development]], [[elections]], [[public opinion]], and [[public policy]] such as [[Social Security reform]], [[foreign policy]], [[US Congress]]ional committees, and the [[United States Supreme Court|US Supreme Court]]&amp;nbsp;— to name only a few issues.

Because political science is essentially a study of [[human behaviour]], in all aspects of [[politics]], observations in controlled environments are often challenging to reproduce or duplicate, though [[experiment]]al methods are increasingly common (see [[experimental political science]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Druckman|editor1-first=James|editor2-first=Donald|editor2-last=Green|editor3-first=James|editor3-last=Kuklinski|editor4-first=Arthur|display-editors = 3 |editor4-last=Lupia|year=2011|title=Cambridge Handbook of Experimental Political Science|location=New York|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-17455-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Citing this difficulty, former [[American Political Science Association]] President [[Lawrence Lowell]] once said "We are limited by the impossibility of experiment. Politics is an observational, not an experimental science."&lt;ref&gt;Lowell, A. Lawrence. 1910. "The Physiology of Politics." ''American Political Science Review'' 4: 1-15.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, political scientists have historically observed political elites, institutions, and individual or group behaviour in order to identify patterns, draw generalizations, and build theories of politics.

Like all social sciences, political science faces the difficulty of observing human actors that can only be partially observed and who have the capacity for making conscious choices unlike other subjects such as non-human organisms in [[biology]] or inanimate objects as in [[physics]]. Despite the complexities, contemporary political science has progressed by adopting a variety of methods and theoretical approaches to understanding politics and methodological pluralism is a defining feature of contemporary political science.

The advent of political science as a university discipline was marked by the creation of university departments and chairs with the title of political science arising in the late 19th century. In fact, the designation "political scientist" is typically for those with a doctorate in the field, but can also apply to those with a master's in the subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Department of Labor|title=How to Become a Political Scientist|url=http://www.bls.gov/ooh/life-physical-and-social-science/political-scientists.htm#tab-4|accessdate=13 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Integrating political studies of the past into a unified discipline is ongoing, and the history of political science has provided a rich field for the growth of both [[Norm (sociology)|normative]] and [[positive (social sciences)|positive]] political science, with each part of the discipline sharing some historical predecessors. The American Political Science Association and the ''[[American Political Science Review]]'' were founded in 1903 and 1906, respectively, in an effort to distinguish the study of politics from economics and other social phenomena.  To date, the &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.apsanet.org/apsr|title=American Political Science Association &gt; PUBLICATIONS &gt; About APSA Journals &gt; American Political Science Review|website=www.apsanet.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;American Political Science Review is the leading journal in Political Science research. 

===Behavioural revolution and new institutionalism===

In the 1950s and the 1960s, a behavioural revolution stressing the systematic and rigorously scientific study of individual and group behaviour swept the discipline. A focus on studying political behaviour, rather than institutions or interpretation of legal texts, characterized early behavioural political science, including work by [[Robert Dahl]], [[Philip Converse]], and in the collaboration between sociologist [[Paul Lazarsfeld]] and public opinion scholar [[Bernard Berelson]].

The late 1960s and early 1970s witnessed a take off in the use of deductive, [[game theory|game theoretic]] formal modelling techniques aimed at generating a more analytical corpus of knowledge in the discipline. This period saw a surge of research that borrowed theory and methods from economics to study political institutions, such as the United States Congress, as well as political behaviour, such as voting. [[William H. Riker]] and his colleagues and students at the [[University of Rochester]] were the main proponents of this shift.

Despite considerable research progress in the discipline based on all the kinds of scholarship discussed above, it has been observed that progress toward systematic theory has been modest and uneven.&lt;ref&gt;Kim Quaile Hill, "In Search of General Theory," Journal of Politics 74(October 2012), 917-931.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anticipating of crises===

The theory of political transitions,&lt;ref&gt;Acemoglu D., Robinson J.A. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2677820 "A theory of political transitions."] American Economic Review. 2001 Sep 1:938-963.&lt;/ref&gt; and the methods of their analysis and anticipating of crises,&lt;ref&gt;McClelland C.A. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2600146 "The Anticipation of International Crises: Prospects for Theory and Research."] International Studies Quarterly, Vol. 21, No. 1, Special Issue on International Crisis:Progress and Prospects for Applied Forecasting and Management (March 1977), pp. 15-38&lt;/ref&gt; form an important part of political science. Several general indicators of crises and methods were proposed for anticipating critical transitions.&lt;ref&gt;Scheffer M., Carpenter S.R., Lenton T.M., Bascompte J., Brock W., Dakos V., Van De Koppel J., Van De Leemput I.A., Levin S.A., Van Nes E.H., Pascual M. [http://science.sciencemag.org/content/338/6105/344 "Anticipating critical transitions."] Science. 2012 Oct 19;338(6105):344-348.&lt;/ref&gt; Among them, a statistical indicator of crisis, simultaneous increase of [[variance]] and [[correlations]] in large groups, was proposed for crises anticipation and successfully used in various areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gorban|first1=A.N.|last2=Smirnova|first2=E.V.|last3=Tyukina|first3=T. A.|title=Correlations, risk and crisis: From physiology to finance|journal=Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications|date=August 2010|volume=389|issue=16|pages=3193–3217|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222687003|doi=10.1016/j.physa.2010.03.035|arxiv=0905.0129|bibcode=2010PhyA..389.3193G}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its applicability for early diagnosis of political crises was demonstrated by the analysis of the prolonged stress period preceding the 2014 [[Ukrainian crisis|Ukrainian economic and political crisis]]. There was a simultaneous increase in the total correlation between the 19 major public fears in the Ukrainian society (by about 64%) and also in their statistical dispersion (by 29%) during the pre-crisis years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rybnikov|first1=S.R.|last2=Rybnikova|first2=N.A.|last3=Portnov|first3=B.A.|title=Public fears in Ukrainian society: Are crises predictable?|journal=Psychology &amp; Developing Societies|date=March 2017|volume=29|issue=1|pages=98–123|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/315918065|doi=10.1177/0971333616689398}}&lt;/ref&gt; A feature shared by certain major revolutions is that they were not predicted. The theory of apparent inevitability of crises and revolutions was also developed.&lt;ref&gt;Kuran T. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/30025019 "Sparks and prairie fires: A theory of unanticipated political revolution."] Public Choice, Vol. 61, No. 1 (April 1989), pp. 41–74&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political science in the Soviet Union===
In the [[Soviet Union]], political studies were carried out under the guise of some other disciplines like theory of state and [[law]], [[area studies]], [[international relations]], studies of labor movement, "critique of bourgeois theories", etc. Soviet scholars were represented at the [[International Political Science Association]] (IPSA) since 1955 (since 1960 by the Soviet Association of Political and State Studies).

In 1979, the 11th World Congress of IPSA took place in [[Moscow]]. Until the late years of the Soviet Union, political science as a field was subjected to tight control of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and was thus subjected to distrust. Anti-communists accused political scientists of being "false" scientists and of having served the old regime.&lt;ref name="Reference"&gt;Political Science in Russia: Institutionalization of the Discipline and Development of the Professional Community&lt;/ref&gt;

After the fall of the Soviet Union, two of the major institutions dealing with political science, the Institute of Contemporary Social Theories and the Institute of International Affairs, were disbanded, and most of their members were left without jobs. These institutes were victims of the first wave of [[anticommunist]] opinion and ideological attacks. Today, the Russian Political Science Association unites professional political scientists from all around Russia.

===Recent developments===
In 2000, the [[Perestroika Movement]] in political science was introduced as a reaction against what supporters of the movement called the mathematicization of political science. Those who identified with the movement argued for a plurality of methodologies and approaches in political science and for more relevance of the discipline to those outside of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=veelUVVHg8MC|title=Perestroika!: The Raucous Rebellion in Political Science|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0300130201|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Evolutionary psychology]] theories argue that humans have evolved a highly developed set of psychological mechanisms for dealing with politics. However, these mechanisms evolved for dealing with the small group politics that characterized the ancestral environment and not the much larger political structures in today's world. This is argued to explain many important features and systematic [[cognitive bias]]es of current politics.&lt;ref name=AEP&gt;Michael Bang Petersen. "The evolutionary psychology of mass politics".

==Political science education==

Political science, possibly like the social sciences as a whole, "as a discipline lives on the fault line between the 'two cultures' in the academy, the [[sciences]] and the [[humanities]]."&lt;ref name=Stoner&gt;{{cite web|last=Stoner |first=J. R. |url=http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/2/4/5/5/8/p245585_index.html |title=Political Science and Political Education |publisher=Paper presented at the annual meeting of the APSA Teaching and Learning Conference ([[American Political Science Association|APSA]]), San Jose Marriott, [[San Jose, California]] |date=22 February 2008 |quote=... although one might allege the same for social science as a whole, political scientists receive funding from and play an active role in both the [[National Science Foundation]] and the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] [in the United States]. |accessdate=19 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091130234044/http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/2/4/5/5/8/p245585_index.html |archivedate=30 November 2009 }} &lt;nowiki&gt; &lt;http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p245585_index.html&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, in some American colleges where there is no separate [[College of Arts and Sciences|School
 or College of Arts and Sciences]] per se, political science may be a separate department housed as part of a division or school of Humanities or [[Liberal Arts]].&lt;ref name=Marist&gt;See, e.g., the department of [http://www.marist.edu/liberalarts/polsci/ Political Science] at [[Marist College]], part of a Division of Humanities before that division became the School of Liberal Arts (c. 2000).&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas classical [[political philosophy]] is primarily defined by a concern for [[Greece|Hellenic]] and [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] thought, political scientists are also marked by a great concern for "[[modernity]]" and the contemporary [[nation state]], along with the study of classical thought, and as such share a greater deal of terminology with [[sociologists]] (e.g. [[structure and agency]]).

Most [[United States]] [[Higher education in the United States|colleges and universities]] offer B.A. programs in political science. M.A. or M.A.T. and Ph.D. or Ed.D. programs are common at larger universities. The term ''political science'' is more popular in [[North America]] than elsewhere; other institutions, especially those outside the United States, see political science as part of a broader discipline of ''political studies,'' ''politics,'' or ''government.'' While ''political science'' implies use of the [[scientific method]], ''political studies'' implies a broader approach, although the naming of degree courses does not necessarily reflect their content.&lt;ref&gt;''Politics'' is the term used to refer to this field by [[Brandeis University]]; [[Cornell College]]; [[University of California, Santa Cruz]]; [[Hendrix College]]; [[Lake Forest College]]; [[Monash University]]; [[Mount Holyoke College]]; [[New York University]]; [[Occidental College]]; [[Princeton University]]; [[Ursinus College]]; [[Washington and Lee University]]; and [[Zeppelin University]]. ''Government'' is the term used for this field by [[Bowdoin College]]; [[Colby College]]; [[Cornell University]]; [[Dartmouth College]]; [[Georgetown University]]; [[Harvard University]]; [[Smith College]]; [[Wesleyan University]]; the [[College of William and Mary]]; the [[University of Sydney]]; the [[University of Texas at Austin]]; the [[University of Ulster]]; the [[University of Essex]]; [[Victoria University of Wellington]], which has both a "School of Government" and a separate "Political Science and International Relations Programme"; and the [[London School of Economics|London School of Economics and Political Science]]. ''Politics and government'' is the term used by the [[University of Puget Sound]]. ''Government and politics'' is used by the [[University of Maryland, College Park]].&lt;/ref&gt; Separate degree granting programs in international relations and [[public policy]] are not uncommon at both the undergraduate and graduate levels. Master's level programs in political science are common when political scientists engage in [[public administration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Vernardakis |first=George |title=Graduate education in government |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Rd3DDiQm3M8C&amp;pg=PA77 |page=77 |year=1998 |publisher=University Press of America |isbn=978-0-7618-1171-8 |quote=...existing practices at Harvard University, the University of California at Berkeley, and the University of Michigan.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The national honor society for college and university students of government and politics in the United States is [[Pi Sigma Alpha]].

===Cognate fields===
Most political scientists work broadly in one or more of the following five areas:
* [[Comparative politics]], including [[area studies]]
* [[International relations]]
* [[Political philosophy]] or political theory
* [[Public administration]]
* [[Public law]]

Some political science departments also classify [[methodology]] as well as scholarship on the domestic politics of a particular country as distinct fields. In the United States, [[American political science|American politics]] is often treated as a separate subfield.

In contrast to this traditional classification, some academic departments organize scholarship into thematic categories, including political philosophy, [[Theories of political behavior|political behaviour]] (including [[public opinion]], [[collective action]], and [[Identity (social science)|identity]]), and political institutions (including [[legislature]]s and [[international organization]]s). Political science conferences and journals often emphasize scholarship in more specific categories. The American Political Science Association, for example, has 42 organized sections that address various methods and topics of political inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apsanet.org/content_4596.cfm APSA Organized Sections | APSA&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]{{paywall}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- Add sections here on each subfield --&gt;

==History==
{{main article|History of political science}}

As a social science, contemporary political science started to take shape in the latter half of the 19th century. At that time it began to separate itself from political philosophy, which traces its roots back to the works of [[Aristotle]], and [[Plato]] which were written nearly 2,500 years ago. The term "political science" was not always distinguished from political philosophy, and the modern discipline has a clear set of antecedents including also moral philosophy, political economy, political theology, history, and other fields concerned with normative determinations of what ought to be and with deducing the characteristics and functions of the ideal state.

'''Pore pressure gradient''' is a dimensional [[Petrophysics|petrophysical]] term used by [[drilling engineer]]s and [[mud engineer]]s during the design of drilling programs for drilling (constructing) [[Oil well|oil]] and gas wells into the earth. It is the [[pressure gradient]] inside the pore space of the [[rock column]] from the surface of the ground down to the total depth (TD), as compared to the pressure gradient of seawater in deep water.

Whereas in "[[pure math]]," the gradient of a [[scalar function]] expressed by the math notation grad(''f'') may not have physical units associated with it; in drilling engineering the pore pressure gradient is usually expressed in API-type [[International Association of Drilling Contractors]] (IADC) physical units of measurement, namely "psi per foot." In the well-known formula

:''P'' = 0.052 * mud weight * true vertical depth

taught in almost all [[petroleum engineering]] courses worldwide, the mud weight (MW) is expressed in pounds per U.S. gallon, and the true vertical depth (TVD) is expressed in feet, and 0.052 is a commonly used conversion constant that can be derived by dimensional analysis:

&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{ \frac{1\; psi}{ft} \times \frac{1\; ft}{12\; in}\times \frac{1\; lb/in^{2}}{1\; psi}\times \frac{231\; in^{3}}{1\; US\; Gal}=19.25000000\; lb/gal}&lt;/math&gt;

It would be more accurate to divide a value in lb/gal by 19.25 than to multiply that value by 0.052. The magnitude of the error caused by multiplying by 0.052 is approximately 0.1%.

Example: For a column of fresh water of 8.33 pounds per gallon (lb/U.S. gal) standing still hydrostatically in a 21,000 feet vertical cased wellbore from top to bottom (vertical hole), the pressure gradient would be
:grad(''P'') = pressure gradient = 8.33 / 19.25 = 0.43273 psi/ft

and the hydrostatic bottom hole pressure (BHP) is then
:BHP = TVD * grad(''P'') = 21,000 * 0.43273 = 9,087 psi

However, the formation fluid pressure (pore pressure) is usually much greater than a column of fresh water, and can be as much as 19 lb/U.S. gal (e.g., in Iran). For an onshore vertical wellbore with an exposed open hole interval at 21,000 feet with a pore pressure gradient of 19 lb/U.S. gal, the BHP would be
:BHP = pore pres grad * TVD = 21,000 * 19 / 19.25 = 20,727 psi

The calculation of a bottom hole pressure and the pressure induced by a static column of fluid are the most important and basic calculations in all well control courses taught worldwide for the prevention of oil and gas well blowouts.

== Simple Examples ==
Using the figures above, we can calculate the maximum pressure at various depths in an offshore oil well.

  Saltwater is '''0.444 psi/ft''' (2.5% higher than fresh water but this not general and depends on salt concentration in water)
  Pore pressure in the rock could be as high as '''1.0 psi/ft''' of depth (19.25 lb/gal)

A well with 5,000 feet of seawater and 15,000 feet of rock could have an overburden pressures at the bottom as high as '''17,220 psi'''  (5000 * 0.444 + 15000 * 1.0).  That pressure is reduced at the surface by the weight of oil and gas the riser pipe, but this is only a small percentage of the total.  It takes heavy mud (drilling fluid) inserted at the bottom to control the well when pressures are this high.

'''Radial dysplasia''', also known as '''radial club hand''' or '''radial longitudinal deficiency''', is a congenital difference occurring in a longitudinal direction resulting in radial deviation of the wrist and shortening of the forearm. It can occur in different ways, from a minor anomaly to complete absence of the [[Radius (bone)|radius]], radial side of the carpal bones and thumb.&lt;ref name="Bednar"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bednar MS, James MA, Light TR |title= Congenital longitudinal deficiency. |journal= J Hand Surg |volume=34 |issue=9 |pages= 1739–47|year=2009 |pmid= 19896016 |doi=10.1016/j.jhsa.2009.09.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hypoplasia of the distal humerus may be present as well and can lead to stiffness of the elbow.&lt;ref name="Bates"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bates SJ, Hansen SL, Jones NF |title= Reconstruction of congenital differences of the hand. |journal= Plast Reconstr Surg |volume=124 |issue=1 |pages= 128e-143e. |year=2009 |pmid= 19568146 |doi=10.1097/PRS.0b013e3181a80777}}&lt;/ref&gt; Radial deviation of the wrist is caused by lack of support to the carpus, radial deviation may be reinforced if forearm muscles are functioning poorly or have abnormal insertions.&lt;ref name="Netscher"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Netscher DT, Baumholtz MA |title= Treatment of congenital upper extremity problems. |journal= Plast Reconstr Surg |volume=119 |issue=5 |pages= 101e-129e. |year=2007 |pmid= 17415231 |doi=10.1097/01.prs.0000258535.31613.43}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although radial longitudinal deficiency is often bilateral, the extent of involvement is most often asymmetric.&lt;ref name="Bednar"/&gt;

The incidence is between 1:30,000 and 1:100,000 and it is more often a [[sporadic mutation]] rather than an inherited condition.&lt;ref name="Bednar"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Netscher"/&gt; In case of an inherited condition, several syndromes are known for an association with radial dysplasia, such as the cardiovascular [[Holt-Oram syndrome]], the gastrointestinal [[VATER syndrome]] and the hematologic [[Fanconi anemia]] and [[TAR syndrome]].&lt;ref name="Bednar"/&gt; Other possible causes are an injury to the [[apical ectodermal ridge]] during upper limb development,&lt;ref name="Bates"/&gt; intrauterine compression, or maternal drug use ([[thalidomide]]).&lt;ref name="Netscher"/&gt;

==Classification==
Classification of radial dysplasia is practised through different models. Some only include the different deformities or absences of the radius, where others also include anomalies of the thumb and carpal bones. The Bayne and Klug classification discriminates four different types of radial dysplasia.&lt;ref name="Goldfarb"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Goldfarb CA, Manske PR, Busa R, Mills J, Carter P, Ezaki M |title= Upper-extremity phocomelia reexamined: a longitudinal dysplasia. |journal= J Bone Joint Surg Am |volume=87 |issue=12 |pages= 2639–48|year=2005 |pmid= 16322613 |doi=10.2106/JBJS.D.02011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A fifth type was added by Goldfarb et al. describing a radial dysplasia with  participation of the humerus.&lt;ref name="Goldfarb"/&gt; In this classification only anomalies of the radius and the humerus are taken in consideration. James and colleagues expanded this classification by including deficiencies of the carpal bones with a normal distal radius length as type 0 and isolated thumb anomalies as type N.&lt;ref name="Goldfarb"/&gt;

Type N: Isolated thumb anomaly&lt;br /&gt;
Type 0: Deficiency of the carpal bones&lt;br /&gt;
Type I: Short distal radius&lt;br /&gt;
Type II: Hypoplastic radius in miniature&lt;br /&gt;
Type III: Absent distal radius&lt;br /&gt;
Type IV: Complete absent radius&lt;br /&gt;
Type V: Complete absent radius and manifestations in the proximal humerus

The term '''absent radius''' can refer to the last 3 types.

==Treatment==

===Splinting and stretching===
In cases of a minor deviation of the wrist, treatment by splinting and stretching alone may be a sufficient approach in treating the radial deviation in RD. Besides that, the parent can support this treatment by performing passive exercises of the hand. This will help to stretch the wrist and also possibly correct any extension contracture of the elbow. Furthermore, splinting is used as a postoperative measure trying to avoid a relapse of the radial deviation.&lt;ref name="Netscher" /&gt;

===Centralization===
More severe types (Bayne type III en IV) of radial dysplasia can be treated with surgical intervention. The main goal of centralization is to increase hand function by positioning the hand over the distal ulna, and stabilizing the wrist in straight position. Splinting or soft-tissue distraction may be used preceding the centralization.
In classic centralization central portions of the [[carpus]] are removed to create a notch for placement of the ulna.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lamb DW. |title= The treatment of longitdunal radial deficiency. |journal=Prosthet Orthot Int. |volume=15 |issue=2 |pages=100–3 |year=1991 |pmid=1923709  }}&lt;/ref&gt; A different approach is to place the metacarpal of the middle finger in line with the ulna with a fixation pin.&lt;ref name="Bednar" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Netscher"/&gt;

If radial tissues are still too short after soft-tissue stretching, soft tissue release and different approaches for manipulation of the forearm bones may be used to enable the placement of the hand onto the ulna. Possible approaches are shortening of the ulna by resection of a segment, or removing carpal bones.&lt;ref name="de Jong"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=de Jong JP, Moran SL, Vilkki SK |title= Changing Paradigms in the Treatment of Radial Club Hand: Microvascular Joint Transfer for Correction of Radial Deviation and Preservation of Long-term Growth. |journal= Clin Orthop Surg. |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=36–44 |year=2012 |pmid=22379554 |doi=10.4055/cios.2012.4.1.36 |pmc=3288493}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the ulna is significantly bent, osteotomy may be needed to straighten the ulna.&lt;ref name="Bednar"/&gt; After placing the wrist in the correct position, radial wrist extensors are transferred to the extensor carpi ulnaris tendon, to help stabilize the wrist in straight position.&lt;ref name="Bates"/&gt; If the thumb or its carpometacarpal joint is absent, centralization can be followed by [[pollicization]]. Postoperatively, a long arm plaster splinter has to be worn for at least 6 to 8 weeks. A removable splint is often worn for a long period of time.&lt;ref name="Netscher"/&gt;

Radial angulation of the hand enables patients with stiff elbows to reach their mouth for feeding; therefore treatment is contraindicated in cases of extension contracture of the elbow.&lt;ref name="Bates"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Netscher"/&gt; A risk of centralization is that the procedure may cause injury to the ulnar physis, leading to early epiphyseal arrest of the ulna, and thereby resulting in an even shorter forearm.&lt;ref name="Bednar"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Netscher"/&gt; Sestero et al. reported that ulnar growth after centralization reaches from 48% to 58% of normal ulnar length, while ulnar growth in untreated patients reaches 64% of normal ulnar length.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sestero AM, Van Heest A, Agel J |title= Ulnar growth patterns in radial longitudinal deficiency. |journal= J Hand Surg Am. |volume=31 |issue=6 |pages=960–7 |year=2006 |pmid=16843156 |doi=10.1016/j.jhsa.2006.03.016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several reviews note that centralization can only partially correct radial deviation of the wrist and that studies with longterm follow-up show relapse of radial deviation.&lt;ref name="de Jong"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Manske PR, Goldfarb CA |title=Congenital failure of formation of the upper limb. |journal= Hand Clin. |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages=157–70 |year=2009 |pmid=19380058 |doi=10.1016/j.hcl.2008.10.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Radialization===
[[Buck-Gramcko]] described another operation technique, for treatment of radial dysplasia, which is called radialization. During radialization the metacarpal of the index finger is pinned onto the ulna and radial wrist extensors are attached to the ulnar side of the wrist, causing overcorrection or ulnar deviation. This overcorrection is believed to make relapse of radial deviation less likely.&lt;ref name="Bednar"/&gt;

===Vascularized metatarsophalangeal (MTP)-joint transfer===
Villki reported a different approach in During this procedure a vascularised [[Metatarsophalangeal articulations|MTP-joint]] of the second toe is transferred to the radial side of ulna, creating a platform that provides radial support for the wrist. The graft is vascularised and therefore maintains its ability to join the growth of the supporting ulna.&lt;ref name="de Jong"/&gt;

Prior to the actual transfer of the MTP-joint of the second toe soft-tissue distraction of the wrist is required to create enough space to place the MTP joint. When after several weeks enough space has been created through distraction, the actual transfer of the MTP joint can be initiated. During this surgical intervention the wrist and the second toe are prepared for transfer at the same time. The ipsilateral second toe MTP joint, together with its metatarsal arteries, its extensor and flexor tendons and its dorsal nerves to the skin, is harvested for transfer. The distal and middle phalanx of the toe are removed. The transferred toe, consisting of the metatarsal and proximal phalanx, is fixed between the physis of the ulna and the second metacarpal, or the scaphoid. 
The tendons of the toe are attached to those of the radial flexor and extensors muscles of the wrist to create more stability to the MTP joint. K-wires are placed to fixate the bones in the desired position. Once the bones are secured anastomosis are made between the vessels of the toe and the vessels of the forearm. After revascularization of the toe, the skin paddle is placed and the skin is closed.&lt;ref name="Vilkki"&gt;{{cite journal |author= Vilkki SK. |title= Vascularized metatarsophalangeal joint transfer for radial hypoplasia. |journal= Semin Plast Surg |volume=22 |issue=3 |pages=195–212 |year=2008 |pmid= 20567714 |doi=10.1055/s-2008-1081403 |pmc=2884879}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vilkki et al. have conducted a study on 19 forearms treated with vascularized MTP-joint transfer with a mean follow-up of 11 years which reports an ulnar length of 67% compared to the contralateral side.&lt;ref name="Vilkki"/&gt; De Jong et al. described in a review that compared to study outcomes on centralization, Vilkki reported a smaller deviation postoperatively and a lower severity of the relapse.&lt;ref name="de Jong"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4110">'''Socio-cognitive''' or '''sociocognitive''' describes how processes of group formation effect cognition, studied in [[cognitive sociology]]. 

Others have used the phrase to refer to the integration of the [[cognition|cognitive]] and [[social]] properties of [[system]]s, [[wikt:process|process]]es, [[function (engineering)|function]]s, [[Model (abstract)|models]], as well as can indicate the branch of [[science]], [[engineering]] or [[technology]], such as ''socio-cognitive research'', ''socio-cognitive interactions''. 
&lt;ref&gt;C. J. Hemingway  and T. G. Gough (1998), A Socio-Cognitive Theory of Information Systems, Technical Report 98.25, School of Computer Studies, University of Leeds,
December 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;
This term is especially used when [[complexity|complex]] cognitive and social properties are reciprocally connected and essential for a given problem. 

'''Socio-cognitive research''' is [[human factor]] and socio-organizational factor based, and assumes an integrated [[knowledge engineering]], environment and [[business]]  [[modeling perspectives|modeling perspective]], therefore it is not ''[[social cognition]]'' which rather is a branch of [[psychology]] focused on ''how people process social information''.

'''Socio-cognitive engineering''' ('''SCE''') includes a set of theoretical interdisciplinary frameworks, methodologies, methods and software tools for the design of [[Human-centered computing (discipline)|human centred]] technologies,&lt;ref&gt;M. Sharples at al.(2002), [http://www.eee.bham.ac.uk/sharplem/Papers/mediate%20ejor.pdf Socio-cognitive engineering:  a methodology for the design of humancentred technology] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060923190713/http://www.eee.bham.ac.uk/sharplem/Papers/mediate%20ejor.pdf |date=2006-09-23 }}, European Journal of Operational Research&lt;/ref&gt; as well as, for the improvement of large complex human-technology systems.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3566">A '''Supreme Court Clinic''' is a [[law school clinic]] that provides hands-on legal experience in [[Supreme Court Litigation]] to law students. Clinics are usually directed by clinical professors and experienced Supreme Court litigators and typically represent indigent or non-profit clients in the [[Supreme Court of the United States]]. Assistance is provided [[pro bono]].

Supreme Court Clinics exist at Stanford Law School, New York University Law School, Yale Law School, Harvard Law School, The University of Virginia School of Law, The University of Texas School of Law, Emory University School of Law, George Mason University School of Law, Northwestern University Law School, Southwestern Law School, and University of Pennsylvania Law School. Supreme Court clinics generally file [[amicus briefs]] ("friend of the Court briefs"); petitions for [[certiorari]], which are formal requests to the Court to decide a case; and merits briefs, which are formal legal arguments presented to the Court after it as agreed to take a case. Typically, experienced Supreme Court litigators help run the clinics. It is these litigators who represent the clinics before the Court during oral arguments.

The first Supreme Court Clinic was founded at [[Stanford Law School]] in 2004 and, by March 2006, the Supreme Court had agreed to hear five cases the clinic helped file and declined to hear three.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/15/education/15stanford.html?ex=1300078800&amp;en=166193a56fba80c8&amp;ei=5088&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss | publisher=The New York Times | title=Stanford Law Students Get Early Supreme Court Duty | author=Falcone, Michael | date=March 15, 2006 | accessdate=2007-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Supreme Court Litigation Clinic at NYU School of Law was formed in Fall 2007.

In [[telecommunications]] a '''link''' is a [[communication channel]] that connects two or more devices. This link may be an actual physical link or it may be a logical link that uses one or more physical links or shares a physical link with other telecommunications links.

A telecommunications link is generally one of several types of information transmission paths such as those provided by [[communication satellite]]s, terrestrial radio communications infrastructure and [[computer networks]] to connect two or more points.

The term ''link'' is widely used in [[computer networking]] to refer to the communications facilities that connect nodes of a network.&lt;ref name="atis"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atis.org/glossary/definition.aspx?id=4188|title=network topology|author=ATIS committee PRQC|publisher=[[Alliance for Telecommunications Industry Solutions]]|work=ATIS Telecom Glossary 2007|accessdate=2008-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Efn|Sometimes the communications facilities that provide the communications channel that constitutes a link are also included in the definition of ''link''.}} When the link is a logical link the type of physical link should always be specified (e.g., [[data link]], uplink, downlink, [[fiber optic]] link, [[#Point-to-point|point-to-point link]], etc.)

==Types==
===Point-to-point===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Packet]] --&gt;
{{main|Point-to-point (telecommunications)}}
A point-to-point link is a dedicated link that connects exactly two communication facilities (e.g., two [[Node (networking)|nodes]] of a network, an intercom station at an entryway with a single internal intercom station, a radio path between two points, etc.).

===Broadcast===

Broadcast links connect two or more nodes and support ''broadcast transmission'', where one node can transmit so that all other nodes can receive the same transmission. [[Ethernet]] is an example.

===Multipoint===

Also known as a ''multidrop'' link, a multipoint link is a link that connects ''two or more'' nodes.  Also known as general topology networks, these include [[Asynchronous Transfer Mode|ATM]] and [[Frame Relay]] links, as well as [[X.25]] networks when used as links for a network layer protocol like [[Internet Protocol|IP]].

Unlike broadcast links, there is no mechanism to efficiently send a single message to all other nodes without copying and retransmitting the message.

===Point-to-multipoint===
{{main|Point-to-multipoint communication (telecommunications)}}
A point-to-multipoint link (or simply a ''multipoint'') is a specific type of multipoint link which consists of a central connection endpoint (CE) that is connected to multiple peripheral CEs. Any transmission of data that originates from the central CE is received by all of the peripheral CEs while any transmission of data that originates from any of the peripheral CEs is only received by the central CE.

=== Private and public — accessibility and ownership ===

Links are often referred to by terms which refer to the ownership and / or accessibility of the link.
* A ''private link'' is a link that is either owned by a specific entity or a link that is only accessible by a specific entity.
* A ''public link'' is a link that uses the public switched telephone network or other public utility or entity to provide the link and which may also be accessible by anyone.

== Direction ==
[[File:Uplink y Downlink.jpg|thumb|250px|&lt;center&gt; ''Feeder links'', here: ''uplink / downlink'']]
=== Uplink ===
*Pertaining to [[radiocommunication service]], an '''uplink''' (UL or U/L) is the portion of a [[feeder link]] used for the transmission of signals from an [[earth station]] to a [[space radio station]], [[space radio system]] or [[high altitude platform station]].
*Pertaining to [[Global System for Mobile Communications|GSM]] and cellular networks, the radio uplink is the transmission path from the [[mobile station]] (cell phone) to a [[base transceiver station|base station]] (cell site). Traffic and signalling flowing within the [[Base Station Subsystem|BSS]] and [[Network and Switching Subsystem|NSS]] may also be identified as uplink and downlink.
*Pertaining to computer networks, an uplink is a connection from [[data communications equipment]] toward the [[network core]]. This is also known as an [[upstream (networking)|upstream]] connection.

=== Downlink ===
*Pertaining to [[radiocommunication service]], a '''downlink''' (DL or D/L) is the portion of a [[feeder link]] used for the transmission of signals from a [[space radio station]], [[space radio system]] or [[high altitude platform station]] to an [[earth station]].
*In the context of satellite communications, a '''downlink''' (DL) is the link from a satellite to a ground station.
*Pertaining to cellular networks, the radio downlink is the transmission path from a cell site to the cell phone. Traffic and signalling flowing within the [[base station subsystem]] (BSS) and [[network switching subsystem]] (NSS) may also be identified as uplink and downlink.
*Pertaining to computer networks, a downlink is a connection from data communications equipment towards [[data terminal equipment]]. This is also known as a [[downstream (networking)|downstream]] connection.

=== Forward link ===
A '''forward link''' is the link from a fixed location (e.g., a [[base station]]) to a mobile user. If the link includes a [[communications satellite|communications relay satellite]], the forward link will consist of both an [[uplink]] (base station to satellite) and a downlink (satellite to mobile user).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scatmag.com/technical/techarticle-mar05.pdf Basics of C &amp; Ku Band] Scatmag.com&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reverse link ===
{{See also|Backhaul (telecommunications)|Return channel}}

The '''reverse link''' (sometimes called a ''[[return channel]]'') is the link from a mobile user to a fixed base station.

If the link includes a [[communication satellite|communications relay satellite]], the reverse link will consist of both an [[uplink]] (mobile station to satellite) and a [[downlink]] (satellite to base station) which together constitute a half [[Hop (telecommunications)|hop]].

The '''''Guide To Getting It On!''''' is a [[Human sexuality|sexuality]] guide by research psychoanalyst [[Paul Joannides (psychoanalyst)|Paul Joannides]], illustrated by the comic book artist [[Dærick Gröss, Sr.]]  A 9th edition was released in 2017.

[[File:Cover of the 7th edition, Guide To Getting It On.jpg|thumb|Cover of the 7th edition]]

==Style==

The book uses informal language and quotations extensively to illustrate the points the author makes. These quotations are from males and females, of a broad age range, that the author has interviewed during his research or who sent letters to him after publication of previous editions of the book.

It is illustrated throughout with realistic body drawings. It also uses comic-like drawings to maintain a light-hearted approach, such as a drawing of a vagina and a penis, both with eyes, mouth, nose, hands and feet, having a dialogue.

[[Image:Total least squares.svg|right|thumb|200px| The bivariate (Deming regression) case of total least squares. The red lines show the error in both ''x'' and ''y''. This is different from the traditional least squares method which measures error parallel to the ''y'' axis. The case shown, with deviations measured perpendicularly, arises when ''x'' and ''y'' have equal variances.]]

In [[applied statistics]], '''total least squares''' is a type of [[errors-in-variables regression]], a [[least squares]] data modeling technique in which observational errors on both dependent and independent variables are taken into account. It is a generalization of [[Deming regression]] and also of [[orthogonal regression]], and can be applied to both linear and non-linear models.

The total least squares approximation of the data is generically equivalent to the best, in the [[Frobenius norm]], [[low-rank approximation]] of the data matrix.&lt;ref&gt;I. Markovsky and [[Sabine Van Huffel|S. Van Huffel]], ''Overview of total least squares methods.'' Signal Processing, vol. 87, pp. 2283–2302, 2007. [http://eprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk/13855/1/tls_overview.pdf preprint]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Linear model ==

===Background===

In the [[least squares]] method of data modeling, the [[objective function]], ''S'',
:&lt;math&gt;S=\mathbf{r^TWr},&lt;/math&gt;
is minimized, where ''r'' is the vector of [[errors and residuals in statistics|residuals]] and ''W'' is a weighting matrix. In [[linear least squares (mathematics)|linear least squares]] the model contains equations which are linear in the parameters appearing in the parameter vector &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol\beta&lt;/math&gt;, so the residuals are given by
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r=y-X\boldsymbol\beta}.&lt;/math&gt;
There are ''m'' observations in '''y''' and ''n'' parameters in '''β''' with ''m''&gt;''n''. '''X''' is a ''m''×''n'' matrix whose elements are either constants or functions of the independent variables, '''x'''. The weight matrix '''W''' is, ideally, the inverse of the [[variance-covariance matrix]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbf M_y&lt;/math&gt; of the observations '''y'''. The independent variables are assumed to be error-free. The parameter estimates are found by setting the gradient equations to zero, which results in the normal equations
&lt;ref group="note"&gt;An alternative form is &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{X^TWX\boldsymbol\Delta \boldsymbol\beta=X^T W \boldsymbol\Delta y}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol\Delta \boldsymbol\beta&lt;/math&gt; is the parameter shift from some starting estimate of &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol\beta&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol\Delta \mathbf y&lt;/math&gt; is the difference between '''y''' and the value calculated using the starting value of &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol\beta&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{X^TWX\boldsymbol\beta=X^T Wy}.&lt;/math&gt;

===Allowing observation errors in all variables===

Now, suppose that both '''x''' and '''y''' are observed subject to error, with variance-covariance matrices &lt;math&gt;\mathbf M_x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf M_y&lt;/math&gt; respectively. In this case the objective function can be written as
:&lt;math&gt;S=\mathbf{r_x^TM_x^{-1}r_x+r_y^TM_y^{-1}r_y},&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf r_x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf r_y&lt;/math&gt; are the residuals in '''x''' and '''y''' respectively. Clearly these residuals cannot be independent of each other, but they must be constrained by some kind of relationship. Writing the model function as &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{f(r_x,r_y,\boldsymbol\beta)}&lt;/math&gt;, the constraints are expressed by ''m'' [[condition equations]].&lt;ref&gt;W.E. Deming, Statistical Adjustment of Data, Wiley, 1943&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F=\Delta y -\frac{\partial f}{\partial r_x} r_x-\frac{\partial f}{\partial r_y} r_y -X\Delta\boldsymbol\beta=0}.&lt;/math&gt;
Thus, the problem is to minimize the objective function subject to the ''m'' constraints. It is solved by the use of [[Lagrange multipliers]]. After some algebraic manipulations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gans |first=Peter |title=Data Fitting in the Chemical Sciences |year=1992 |publisher=Wiley |isbn=9780471934127 |url=http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0471934127.html |accessdate=4 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; the result is obtained.

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{X^TM^{-1}X\Delta \boldsymbol\beta=X^T M^{-1} \Delta y}, &lt;/math&gt;

or alternatively &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{X^TM^{-1}X \boldsymbol\beta=X^T M^{-1} y},&lt;/math&gt;
where '''M''' is the variance-covariance matrix relative to both independent and dependent variables.
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{M=K_xM_xK_x^T+K_yM_yK_y^T;\ K_x=-\frac{\partial f}{\partial r_x},\ K_y=-\frac{\partial f}{\partial r_y}}.&lt;/math&gt;

=== Example ===

When the data errors are uncorrelated, all matrices '''M''' and '''W''' are diagonal. Then, take the example of straight line fitting.
:&lt;math&gt;f(x_i,\beta)=\alpha + \beta x_i&lt;/math&gt;
in this case
:&lt;math&gt;M_{ii}=\sigma^2_{y,i}+\beta^2 \sigma^2_{x,i}&lt;/math&gt;
showing how the variance at the ''i''th point is determined by the variances of both independent and dependent variables and by the model being used to fit the data. The expression may be generalized by noting that the parameter &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; is the slope of the line.
:&lt;math&gt;M_{ii}=\sigma^2_{y,i}+\left(\frac{dy}{dx}\right)^2_i \sigma^2_{x,i}&lt;/math&gt;

An expression of this type is used in fitting [[Determination of equilibrium constants#Parameter errors and correlation|pH titration data]] where a small error on ''x'' translates to a large error on y when the slope is large.

=== Algebraic point of view ===
First of all it is necessary to note that the TLS problem does not have a solution in general, which was already shown in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;G. H. Golub and C. F. Van Loan, An analysis of the total least squares problem. Numer. Anal., 17, 1980, pp. 883–893.&lt;/ref&gt; The following considers the simple case where a unique solution exists without making any particular assumptions.

The computation of the TLS using [[singular value decomposition]] is described in standard texts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

for ''B'' where ''X'' is ''m''-by-''n'' and ''Y'' is ''m''-by-''k''. &lt;ref group="note"&gt;The notation ''XB''&amp;nbsp;≈&amp;nbsp;''Y'' is used here to reflect the notation used in the earlier part of the article.  In the computational literature the problem has been more commonly presented as ''AX''&amp;nbsp;≈&amp;nbsp;''B'', i.e. with the letter ''X'' used for the ''n''-by-''k'' matrix of unknown regression coefficients.&lt;/ref&gt;

That is, we seek to find ''B'' that minimizes error matrices ''E'' and ''F'' for ''X'' and ''Y'' respectively. That is,
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{argmin}_{E,F} \| [E\; F] \|_F, \qquad (X+E) B = Y+F&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;[E\; F]&lt;/math&gt; is the [[augmented matrix]] with ''E'' and ''F'' side by side and &lt;math&gt;\|\cdot\|_F&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Frobenius norm]], the square root of the sum of the squares of all entries in a matrix and so equivalently the square root of the sum of squares of the lengths of the rows or columns of the matrix.

This can be rewritten as
:&lt;math&gt;[(X+E) \; (Y+F)] \begin{bmatrix} B\\ -I_k\end{bmatrix} = 0.&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;I_k&lt;/math&gt; is the &lt;math&gt;k\times k&lt;/math&gt; identity matrix.
The goal is then to find &lt;math&gt;[E\; F]&lt;/math&gt; that reduces the rank of &lt;math&gt;[X\; Y]&lt;/math&gt; by ''k''. Define &lt;math&gt;[U] [\Sigma] [V]^*&lt;/math&gt; to be the singular value decomposition of the augmented matrix &lt;math&gt;[X\; Y]&lt;/math&gt;.
:&lt;math&gt;[X\; Y] = [U_X\; U_Y] \begin{bmatrix}\Sigma_X &amp;0 \\ 0 &amp; \Sigma_Y\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}V_{XX} &amp; V_{XY} \\ V_{YX} &amp; V_{YY}\end{bmatrix}^* =  [U_X\; U_Y] \begin{bmatrix}\Sigma_X &amp;0 \\ 0 &amp; \Sigma_Y\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} V_{XX}^* &amp; V_{YX}^* \\ V_{XY}^* &amp; V_{YY}^*\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
where ''V'' is partitioned into blocks corresponding to the shape of ''X'' and ''Y''.

Using the [[Eckart–Young theorem]], the approximation minimising the norm of the error is such that matrices &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; are unchanged, while the &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-smallest singular values are replaced with zeroes. That is, we want
:&lt;math&gt;[(X+E)\; (Y+F)] = [U_X\; U_Y] \begin{bmatrix}\Sigma_X &amp;0 \\ 0 &amp; 0_{k\times k}\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}V_{XX} &amp; V_{XY} \\ V_{YX} &amp; V_{YY}\end{bmatrix}^*&lt;/math&gt;
so by linearity,
:&lt;math&gt;[E\; F] = -[U_X\; U_Y] \begin{bmatrix}0_{n\times n} &amp;0 \\ 0 &amp; \Sigma_Y\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}V_{XX} &amp; V_{XY} \\ V_{YX} &amp; V_{YY}\end{bmatrix}^*. &lt;/math&gt;
We can then remove blocks from the ''U'' and Σ matrices, simplifying to
:&lt;math&gt;[E\; F] = -U_Y\Sigma_Y \begin{bmatrix}V_{XY}\\V_{YY}\end{bmatrix}^*= -[X\; Y] \begin{bmatrix}V_{XY}\\V_{YY}\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}V_{XY}\\ V_{YY}\end{bmatrix}^*.&lt;/math&gt;
This provides ''E'' and ''F'' so that 
:&lt;math&gt;[(X+E) \; (Y+F)] \begin{bmatrix}V_{XY}\\ V_{YY}\end{bmatrix} = 0.&lt;/math&gt;
Now if &lt;math&gt;V_{YY}&lt;/math&gt; is nonsingular, which is not always the case (note that the behavior of TLS when &lt;math&gt;V_{YY}&lt;/math&gt; is singular is not well understood yet), we can then right multiply both sides by &lt;math&gt;-V_{YY}^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; to bring the bottom block of the right matrix to the negative identity, giving&lt;ref&gt;Bjõrck, Ake (1996) ''Numerical Methods for Least Squares Problems'', Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics. {{ISBN|978-0898713602}} {{page needed|date=June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;[(X+E) \; (Y+F)] \begin{bmatrix} -V_{XY} V_{YY}^{-1} \\ -V_{YY} V_{YY}^{-1}\end{bmatrix} = [(X+E) \; (Y+F)] \begin{bmatrix} B\\ -I_k\end{bmatrix} =  0 ,&lt;/math&gt;
and so
:&lt;math&gt;B=-V_{XY} V_{YY}^{-1}.&lt;/math&gt;

A naive [[GNU Octave]] implementation of this is:

&lt;source lang="matlab"&gt;
function B = tls(X,Y)

[m n]   = size(X);            % n is the width of X (X is m by n)
Z       = [X Y];              % Z is X augmented with Y.
[U S V] = svd(Z,0);           % find the SVD of Z.
VXY     = V(1:n,1+n:end);     % Take the block of V consisting of the first n rows and the n+1 to last column
VYY     = V(1+n:end,1+n:end); % Take the bottom-right block of V.
B       = -VXY/VYY;

end
&lt;/source&gt;

The way described above of solving the problem, which requires that the matrix &lt;math&gt;V_{YY}&lt;/math&gt; is nonsingular, can be slightly extended by the so-called ''classical TLS algorithm''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sabine Van Huffel|S. Van Huffel]] and J. Vandewalle (1991) ''The Total Least Squares Problems: Computational Aspects and Analysis''. SIAM Publications, Philadelphia PA.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Computation ===

Math., 25, pp. 111–119, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; All modern implementations based, for example, on solving a sequence of ordinary least squares problems, approximate the matrix &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; (denoted &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; in the literature), as introduced by [[Sabine Van Huffel|Van Huffel]] and Vandewalle. It is worth noting, that this &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; is, however, ''not the TLS solution'' in many cases.&lt;ref&gt;M. Plešinger, The Total Least Squares Problem and Reduction of Data in AX ≈ B.

== Non-linear model ==
For [[non-linear least squares|non-linear systems]] similar reasoning shows that the normal equations for an iteration cycle can be written as
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{J^TM^{-1}J\Delta \boldsymbol\beta=J^T M^{-1} \Delta y}. &lt;/math&gt;

== Geometrical interpretation ==
{{main|Curve fitting#Algebraic fit versus geometric fit for curves}}
{{further|Orthogonal regression}}
When the independent variable is error-free a residual represents the "vertical" distance between the observed data point and the fitted curve (or surface). In total least squares a residual represents the distance between a data point and the fitted curve measured along some direction. In fact, if both variables are measured in the same units and the errors on both variables are the same, then the residual represents the [[distance from a point to a line|shortest distance between the data point and the fitted curve]], that is, the residual vector is perpendicular to the tangent of the curve. For this reason, this type of regression is sometimes called ''two dimensional Euclidean regression'' (Stein, 1983)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Stein |first=Yaakov J. |title=Two Dimensional Euclidean Regression |url =http://www.dspcsp.com/pubs/euclreg.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; or ''orthogonal regression''.

== Scale invariant methods ==
A serious difficulty arises if the variables are not measured in the same units. First consider measuring distance between a data point and the line, as in the diagram – what are the measurement units for this distance? If we consider measuring distance based on Pythagoras' Theorem then it is clear that we shall be adding quantities measured in different units, which is  meaningless. Secondly, if we rescale one of the variables e.g., measure in grams rather than kilograms, then we shall end up with different results (a different line). To avoid these problems it is sometimes suggested that we convert to dimensionless variables—this may be called normalization or standardization. However there are various ways of doing this, and these lead to fitted models which are not equivalent to each other. One approach is to normalize by known (or estimated) measurement precision thereby minimizing the [[Mahalanobis distance]] from the points to the line, providing a [[maximum-likelihood]] solution;{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} the unknown precisions could be found via [[analysis of variance]].

In short, total least squares does not have the property of units-invariance&amp;mdash;i.e. it is not [[scale invariance|scale invariant]]. For a meaningful model we require this property to hold. A way forward is to realise that residuals (distances) measured in different units can be combined if multiplication is used instead of addition. Consider fitting a line: for each data point the product of the vertical and horizontal residuals equals twice the area of the triangle formed by the residual lines and the fitted line. We choose the line which minimizes the sum of these areas. Nobel laureate [[Paul Samuelson]] proved in 1942 that, in two dimensions, it is the only line expressible solely in terms of the ratios of standard deviations and the correlation coefficient which (1) fits the correct equation when the observations fall on a straight line, (2) exhibits scale invariance, and (3) exhibits invariance under interchange of variables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Samuelson |first=Paul A. |year=1942 |title=A Note on Alternative Regressions |journal=Econometrica |publisher=The Econometric Society |doi=10.2307/1907024 |jstor=1907024 |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=80–83}}&lt;/ref&gt; This solution has been rediscovered in different disciplines and is variously known as '''standardised major axis''' (Ricker 1975, Warton et al., 2006),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ricker |first=W.

[[File:ToK Simple.jpg|thumb|379px|Gregg Henriques' Tree of Knowledge System]]

The '''tree of knowledge''' ('''ToK''') '''system''' is a theoretical approach to the unification of [[psychology]] developed by [[Gregg Henriques]], associate professor and director of the Combined-Integrated Doctoral Program in Clinical and School Psychology at [[James Madison University]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://psychweb.cisat.jmu.edu/ToKSystem/about%20me.htm "About Me" section of the ToK System website]&lt;/ref&gt;

The outline of the system was published in 2003 in ''[[Review of General Psychology]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Henriques, G.R. (2003). [http://psychweb.cisat.jmu.edu/ToKSystem/My%20ToK%20Papers/The%20ToK%20and%20Unification%20of%20Psych.pdf The Tree of Knowledge System and the Theoretical Unification of Psychology.] ''Review of General Psychology, 7,'' 150–182.&lt;/ref&gt; Two special issues of the ''[[Journal of Clinical Psychology]]'' in December 2004&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/jissue/109747885 ''Journal of Clinical Psychology''. (December 2004). Special Issue: Defining Psychology: Articles and Commentaries on a New Unified Theory (Part 1) Issue Edited by Gregg R. Henriques. Volume 60 Issue 12, Pages 1203 – 1315]&lt;/ref&gt; and January 2005&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/jissue/109856879 ''Journal of Clinical Psychology''. (January 2005). Special Issue: Defining Psychology: Articles and Commentaries on a New Unified Theory (Part 2) Issue Edited by Gregg R. Henriques. Volume 61 Issue 1, Pages 1 – 139 ]&lt;/ref&gt; were devoted to the elaboration and evaluation of the model. The latest evaluation of this model appeared in a December 2008 special issue of ''[[Theory &amp; Psychology']]'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tap.sagepub.com/content/vol18/issue6/ ''Theory &amp; Psychology''. (December 2008). Volume 18, No. 6]&lt;/ref&gt;

The official website on the tree of knowledge system claims that the ToK is

:''a new unified theory of knowledge that maps the pieces of the scientific puzzle in a novel way that connects Quantum Mechanics to Sociological processes and everything in between into a coherent whole. The most novel aspect of the ToK is its visuo-spatial depiction of knowledge as consisting of four dimensions of complexity (Matter, Life, Mind, and Culture) that correspond to the behavior of four classes of objects (material objects, organisms, animals, and humans), and four classes of science (physical, biological, psychological, and social).''&lt;ref&gt;[http://psychweb.cisat.jmu.edu/ToKSystem/other%20research.htm ToK FAQ]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The "problem of psychology"==
Henriques argues that the most difficult problem in psychology as a discipline is that while there is incredible diversity offered by different approaches to psychology, there is no consensus model of what ''psychology'' actually is.&lt;ref&gt;Henriques, G.R. (2003). [http://psychweb.cisat.jmu.edu/ToKSystem/My%20ToK%20Papers/The%20ToK%20and%20Unification%20of%20Psych.pdf The tree of knowledge system and the theoretical unification of psychology.] ''Review of General Psychology, 7,'' 150–182.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Henriques, G.R. (2004). [http://psychweb.cisat.jmu.edu/ToKSystem/My%20ToK%20Papers/Psych%20Defined.pdf Psychology Defined]. ''Journal of Clinical Psychology, 60,'' 1207–1221.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
According to the ToK system, the "problem of psychology", (as Henriques puts it), is that a clear definition, an agreed upon subject matter, and a coherent conceptual framework have eluded its students for its entire [[history of psychology|history]]. He further argues that the patent tendency of psychology has been toward theoretical and substantial fragmentation and increasing insularity among the "specialties." In other words, the discipline has fragmented into [[psychological schools|different schools of thought]] and methodology, with no overall framework to interpret and integrate the research of different areas. At its best, the different approaches are a strength of psychology; different approaches lead to novel ideas, and prevent psychologists from clinging to a paradigm that fails to explain a phenomenon. At its worst, adherents of one particular school cling to their beliefs concerning the relative importance of their research and disregard or are ignorant of different approaches. In most cases, individual psychologists have to determine for themselves which elements of which perspective to apply, and how to integrate them into their overall understanding.
 
The reason for psychology's fragmentation, according to the ToK, is that there has been no [[metatheory|meta-theoretical]] frame that allows scholars to agree on the basic questions that need to be addressed. As such, the different schools of thought in psychology are like the blind men who each grab a part of the elephant and proclaim they have discovered its true nature. With its novel depiction of evolving dimensions of complexity, the ToK allows scholars finally to see the elephant. In his 2003 ''Review of General Psychology'' paper,&lt;ref&gt;Henriques, G.R. (2003). [http://psychweb.cisat.jmu.edu/ToKSystem/My%20ToK%20Papers/The%20ToK%20and%20Unification%20of%20Psych.pdf The tree of knowledge system and the theoretical unification of psychology.] ''Review of General Psychology, 7,'' 150–182.&lt;/ref&gt; Henriques used the ToK System with the attempt to clarify and align the views of [[B.F. Skinner]] and [[Sigmund Freud]]. These luminaries were chosen because when one considers their influence and historical opposition, it can readily be argued that they represent two schools of thought that are the most difficult to integrate. Henriques used the meta-perspective offered by the ToK to argue how one can retain the key insights from each school of thought, identify errors and points of confusion, and integrate the insights into a coherent whole.

Cultural and personality psychologist, Michael Katzko,&lt;ref&gt;[http://baserv.uci.kun.nl/~mwsk49/ Homepage of Michael Katzko]&lt;/ref&gt; however critiques Henriques' position on "the problem of psychology":

:''There is a very good reason for skepticism regarding the repeated claims that the one unique problem of psychology, applicable across the entire discipline, has been identified and that the ToK System solves it. The reason is given by the detail with which alternatives have been worked out, be they historical studies of institutional development or critical commentaries on the rhetorical structure of psychology's literature.''&lt;ref&gt;Katzko, M.W. (2008). Pruning the Tree of Knowledge. ''Theory &amp; Psychology, 18,'' 817–828. [http://tap.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/18/6/817 Abstract]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tree of knowledge==
In one way, the tree of knowledge system reflects a fairly common hierarchy of nature and of the sciences that has been represented in one way or another since the time of [[Auguste Comte]], who in the 19th century used a hierarchical conception of nature to argue for the existence of sociology. Despite its surface agreement with a standard conception, the ToK System offers a set of ideas that have added implications for both [[ontology]] and [[epistemology]]. The ontological claim made by the ToK, (and [[#top|depicted pictorially above]]), is that [[Physical cosmology|cosmic evolution]] consists of four separable dimensions of complexity, namely [[matter]], life, [[mind]], and culture. The dimension of complexity argument is arguably one of the most complicated aspects of the system. Many have argued nature is hierarchically leveled; for example, a list of such levels might be [[subatomic particles]], [[atoms]], [[molecule]]s, [[cell (biology)|cell]]s, organ structures, multi-celled organisms, [[consciousness]], and society is common. The ToK System embraces a view of nature as levels, but adds the notion that there are also ''dimensions of complexity''. The difference can be seen pictorially. A view of nature as solely consisting of levels would have a single "cone" of complexity, whereas the ToK depicts four "cones". The ToK posits that a separate dimension of complexity emerges when a process of selection operates on a unit of information. Thus, according to the ToK, [[natural selection]] operating on genetic combinations gives rise to the dimension of Life; [[Radical behaviorism|behavioral selection]] operating on [[neuron]]al combinations gives rise to the dimension of Mind; and [[theory of justification|justification]] operating on [[symbol]]ic combinations gives rise to Culture.

The ToK system also offers a new epistemology that Henriques believes will move toward what [[E.O. Wilson]] termed ''[[consilience]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, E.O. (1999). ''[[Consilience: The Unity of Knowledge]]''. Vintage:USA&lt;/ref&gt; Consilience is the interlocking of fact and theory into a coherent, holistic view of knowledge. The ToK offers alternative perspectives on how knowledge is obtained because it depicts science itself as both emerging out of culture and as a unique type of "justification system" that is based on the values of [[accuracy]] and [[objectivity (science)|objectivity]].&lt;ref&gt;Henriques, G.R. (2008). The problem of psychology and the integration of human knowledge: Contrasting Wilson's Consilience with the ToK system. ''Theory &amp; Psychology, 18,'' 731–755. [http://psychweb.cisat.jmu.edu/ToKSystem/My%20ToK%20Papers/PPIHPRevised.pdf Final draft]&lt;/ref&gt; A "justification system", according to Henriques, refers to any belief system that emerges that coordinates the behaviors of individual humans to human populations. The four dimensions of complexity correspond to four broad classes of science: the [[physical science|physical]], [[biology|biological]], [[psychology|psychological]] and [[social science]]s.

===Matter===

The dimension of [[matter]] refers to the set of material objects and their behaviors through time. In accordance with modern [[cosmology]], matter is theorized to have emerged from a pure energy [[Gravitational singularity|singularity]] at the [[Big Bang]]. [[Space-time|Space and time]] were also born at such a point. Nonliving material objects range in complexity from [[subatomic particle]]s to large organic molecules. The physical sciences (i.e., [[physics]], [[chemistry]], geology, [[astronomy]]) describe the behavior of material objects.&lt;ref&gt;Henriques, G.R. (2003). [http://psychweb.cisat.jmu.edu/ToKSystem/My%20ToK%20Papers/The%20ToK%20and%20Unification%20of%20Psych.pdf The Tree of Knowledge System and the Theoretical Unification of Psychology.] ''Review of General Psychology, 7,'' 150–182.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Life===

The dimension of life refers to [[organism]]s and their behaviors through time. Living objects are considered a unique subset of material objects. Just as [[quantum particle]]s form the fundamental units of material complexity, [[gene]]s are the fundamental units of living information. Although many questions about the emergence of life remain unanswered, in accordance with modern biology, the ToK posits that natural selection operating on genetic combinations through time is the unified theory of biology and forms the foundational understanding for the emergence of organic complexity.&lt;ref&gt;Henriques, G.R. (2003). [http://psychweb.cisat.jmu.edu/ToKSystem/My%20ToK%20Papers/The%20ToK%20and%20Unification%20of%20Psych.pdf The Tree of Knowledge System and the Theoretical Unification of Psychology.] ''Review of General Psychology, 7,'' 150–182.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mind===

Mind/cognition in the ToK system refers to the set of mental behaviors. ''Mental behaviors'' are behaviors of animals mediated by the [[nervous system]] that produce a functional effect on the animal-environment relationship. As such, Mind/cognition is essentially synonymous with what behavioral psychologists have meant when they use the term behavior. Thus, a fly avoiding a fly swatter, a rat pushing a bar or a human getting a drink of water are all mental behaviors. Mind is not synonymous with [[sentience]] or the capacity for mental experience, although such processes are presumed to emerge in the mental/cognitive dimension. [[Cognition]], in the broad sense of the term is meaning bodily-neuro-social information processing, as in EEEE Cognition: Embodied, Embedded, Enactive, Extended. While cognitive science stands for naturalist study of mind, psychology is an approach grounded in the tradition of humanities, especially philosophy. Thus, by defining mind as mental behavior, Henriques argues that the ToK System provides a way to bridge the epistemological differences between [[cognitive science|cognitive]] and [[behaviorism|behavioral science]].&lt;ref&gt;Henriques, G.R. (2003). [http://psychweb.cisat.jmu.edu/ToKSystem/My%20ToK%20Papers/The%20ToK%20and%20Unification%20of%20Psych.pdf The Tree of Knowledge System and the Theoretical Unification of Psychology.] ''Review of General Psychology, 7,'' 150–182.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Culture===

Culture in the ToK system refers to the set of [[sociolinguistics|sociolinguistic]] behaviors, which range from large scale nation states to individual human justifications for particular actions. Just as genetic information processing is associated with the Life dimension and neuronal information processing associated with the Mind dimension, symbolic information processing emerges with the Cultural dimension.&lt;ref&gt;Henriques, G.R. (2003). [http://psychweb.cisat.jmu.edu/ToKSystem/My%20ToK%20Papers/The%20ToK%20and%20Unification%20of%20Psych.pdf The Tree of Knowledge System and the Theoretical Unification of Psychology.] ''Review of General Psychology, 7,'' 150–182.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theoretical joint points==

===Quantum gravity===
{{main|Quantum gravity}}

'''Quantum gravity''' refers to the imagined merger between the twin pillars of physical science which are [[quantum mechanics]], the study of the microscopic (e.g., electrons), and [[general relativity]], the science of the macroscopic (e.g., [[galaxy|galaxies]]). Currently, these two great domains of science cannot be effectively interwoven into a single, physical [[Theory of Everything]]. Yet progress is being made, most notably through [[string theory]], [[loop quantum gravity]], [[black hole thermodynamics]] and the study of the early universe. Some of the difficulties combining these two pillars of physical science are philosophical in nature and it is possible that the macro view of knowledge offered by the ToK may eventually aid in the construction of a coherent theory of quantum gravity. The reason the ToK might help is that it locates scientific knowledge in relationship to the physical universe.

===The modern synthesis===
{{main|Modern synthesis (20th century)|l1=The Modern Synthesis}}

The '''modern synthesis''' refers to the merger of genetics with [[natural selection]] which occurred in the 1930s and 1940s and offers a reasonably complete framework for understanding the emergence of biological complexity. Although there remain significant gaps in biological knowledge surrounding questions such as the origin of life and the emergence of sexual reproduction, the modern synthesis represents the most complete and well-substantiated joint point.

===Behavioral investment theory===

'''Behavioral investment theory''' ('''BIT''') is proposed as a merger of the selection science of [[behaviorism]] with the information science of [[cognitive neuroscience]] (notice the parallel with the modern synthesis). BIT posits that the nervous system evolved as an increasingly flexible computational control system that coordinates the behavioral expenditure of energy of the animal as a whole. Expenditure of behavioral energy is theorized to be computed on an investment value system built evolutionarily through natural selection operating on genetic combinations and [[ontogeny|ontogenetically]] through behavioral selection operating on neural combinations. As such, the current behavioral investments of the animal are conceptualized as the joint product of the two vectors of [[phylogeny]] and [[ontogeny]]. A unique element of BIT is that it finds a core of agreement and builds bridges between five brain-behavior paradigms: (1) [[cognitive science]]; (2) [[behavioral science]]; (3) evolutionary theory and genetics; (4) neuroscience; and (5) [[cybernetics]]/[[systems theory]].

[[David C. Geary]] noted the similarities between his "motive-to-control" hypothesis and Henriques' Behavioral Investment Theory, which were developed independently of each other. Furthermore, Geary suggested that his model "seem[ed] to fill in many of the [[proximate causation|proximate mechanisms]] and evolutionary pressures that define the life-mind joint point, and provided a framework for further development of the mind-culture joint point."&lt;ref&gt;Geary, D. C. (2005). [http://web.missouri.edu/~psycorie/JCP05%5Bfinal%5D05.pdf The motivation to control and the origin of mind: Exploring the life-mind joint point in the tree of knowledge.] ''Journal of Clinical Psychology, 61,'' 21–46.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Justification hypothesis===

The '''justification hypothesis''' ('''JH''') is a novel proposal that allows for both the understanding of the evolution of culture and for identifying what makes humans distinct animals. A basic initial claim of the JH is that the process of justification is a crucial component of human mental behavior at both the individual and societal level. Unlike all other animals, humans everywhere ask for and give explanations for their actions. Arguments, debates, moral dictates, rationalizations, and excuses all involve the process of explaining why one's claims, thoughts or actions are warranted. In virtually every form of social exchange, from warfare to politics to family struggles to science, humans are constantly justifying their behavioral investments to themselves and others.

The JH can be stated succinctly as follows: The evolution of language gave rise to the problem of justification, and this evolutionary pressure ultimately resulted in the human self-consciousness system and human culture. The JH carries with it three fundamental postulates. 
*The first is that the evolution of language must have created the problem of justification, which is the problem of explaining one’s self to others in a justifiable manner.
*The second postulate is that the human self-consciousness system can be understood as a “justification filter”. This second claim links the evolutionary analysis with key insights from [[psychodynamic theory]]. Specifically, psychodynamic theory posits that socially unjustifiable impulses are inhibited and socially justifiable reasons are given for actions taken.
*The third postulate is that culture can be understood as large scale justification systems that coordinate the behavior of human populations. Cultural systems are seen to evolve much in the same way as organisms do in biological evolution: there is a process of variation, selection and retention of belief systems.

==How the ToK solves the problem of psychology==

The problem of psychology, according to the ToK, is its conceptual incoherence, which Henriques identifies by the following: 
:(1) There is no agreed upon definition.
:(2) There is no agreed upon subject matter.
:(3) There is a proliferation of overlapping and redundant concepts.
:(4) There are a large number of paradigms with fundamentally different epistemological assumptions.
:(5) Specialization continues to be increasingly emphasized at the expense of generalization and thus the problem of fragmentation only grows.

When the various conceptions of psychology (e.g., behavioral, humanistic, cognitive) are viewed through the lens of the ToK System, psychology spans two different dimensions of complexity: the mental and the cultural. In other words, the discipline has historically spanned two fundamentally separate problems: 
:(1) the problem of animal behavior in general, and
:(2) the problem of human behavior at the individual level.
 
If, as previously thought, nature simply consisted of levels of complexity, psychology would not be crisply defined in relationship to biology or the social sciences. And, indeed, it is frequently suggested that psychology exists in an amorphous space between biology and the social sciences. However, with its dimension of complexity depiction, the ToK System suggests that psychology can be crisply defined as the science of mind, which is the third dimension of complexity. Furthermore, because human behavior exists in the fourth dimension, psychology must be divided into two broad scientific domains of 
:(1) psychological formalism and
:(2) human psychology.

''Psychological formalism'' is defined as the science of mind and corresponds to the behavior of animal objects. ''Human psychology'' is considered to be a unique subset of psychological formalism that deals with human behavior at the level of the individual. Because human behavior is immersed in the larger socio-cultural context (level four in the ToK System), human psychology is considered a hybrid discipline that merges the pure science of psychology with the social sciences. It is important to point out that there are other disciplines the ToK System would classify as “hybrids.” Molecular genetics, for example, is a hybrid between chemistry and biology and neuroscience is a hybrid between biology and psychology. As with Henriques' proposed conception of human psychology, both of these disciplines adopt an object level perspective (molecular and cellular, respectively) on phenomena that simultaneously exist as part of meta-level system processes (life and mind, respectively).&lt;ref&gt;Henriques, G.R. (2004). [http://psychweb.cisat.jmu.edu/ToKSystem/My%20ToK%20Papers/Psych%20Defined.pdf Psychology Defined]. ''Journal of Clinical Psychology, 60,'' 1207–1221.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though David A. F. Haaga "congratulate[d] Dr. Henriques' ambitious, scholarly, provocative paper", and "found the Tree of Knowledge taxonomy, the theoretical joint points, the evolutionary history, and the levels of emergent properties highly illuminating", he asks the rhetorical questions, 
:''If it is so difficult to define terms such as 'psychology' with such precision, why bother? Why not just agree that we all have at least a rough idea of what psychology is, and take the rest of the afternoon off? After all, if theoretical or empirical work improves our understanding of some aspect of the world or our fellow people, or improves our ability to help people enhance their physical or emotional well being, what difference does it make whether this work is considered a part of psychology, of cognitive science, of behavioral neuroscience, of public health, or what have you? This raises the question of what definitions in general are good for.''&lt;ref&gt;Haaga, D.A.F. (2004). [http://psychweb.cisat.jmu.edu/ToKSystem/Related%20Articles/Defining%20Psychology.pdf Defining psychology: What can it do for us?] ''Journal of Clinical Psychology, 60,'' 1227–1230.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a similar vein, Scott O. Lilienfeld, who described Henriques' effort as "thoughtful", contended that psychology is "an inherently fuzzy concept that resists precise definition" and that "attempts to define psychology [would be] likely to hamper rather than foster consilience across disciplines". Lilienfield went on further to suggest that the scientist-practitioner gap in psychology lies not in definitional issues, but in different "epistemic attitudes" between these two groups. He stated that scientists have an epistemic attitude of [[empiricism]], (where questions regarding human nature are settled by scientific evidence), and that practitioners have an epistemic attitude of [[romanticism]], (where questions of human nature are settled by intuition). Lilienfeld suggested that the solution to the scientist-practitioner gulf isn't definitional, but in "train[ing] future clinical scientists to appreciate the proper places of romanticism and empiricism within science".&lt;ref&gt;Lilienfeld, S.O. (2004). [http://psychweb.cisat.jmu.edu/ToKSystem/Related%20Articles/Is%20it%20worth%20the%20trouble.pdf Defining psychology: Is it worth the trouble?] ''Journal of Clinical Psychology, 60,'' 1249–1253.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consciousness and human behavior==

A frequent question and point of confusion in the ToK System is the definition and meaning of [[consciousness]]. As mentioned above, mind is not synonymous with consciousness. And, to understand consciousness from a ToK vantage point, it is crucial to recognize that the term is often ambiguous in its meaning. Two primary meanings are [[sentience]], which is the capacity for mental experience and [[self-awareness]], which is the capacity to be aware of one's awareness. Sentience is conceptualized as a "level 3" phenomena, possessed by many animals other than humans and is defined as a "perceived" electro-neuro-chemical representation of animal-environment relations. The ingredient of neurological behavior that allows for the emergence of mental experience is considered the "hard" problem of conscious and the ToK System does not address this question explicitly. In contrast, through the Justification Hypothesis (see below), the ToK System involves a very direct analysis of the other issue of consciousness, that of [[self-awareness]]. 
 
Another frequent question that is raised is "Where does individual human behavior fall on the ToK?" To analyze human behavior from the context of the ToK, one uses the ToK like a prism to separate the dimensions of behavior into physiochemical, biogenetic, neuropsychological and sociolinguistic. Thus if we imagine a conversation between a husband and wife as follows:

:Wife: “You are late again.”
:Husband: “Please not now. It was a stressful day and traffic was bad and you know if work needs to be done, I can’t just leave it.”

The words represent the sociolinguistic dimension and are understood as a function of justification. Justification systems are seen both at the level of individual, micro-social and societal (i.e., the context of justification in which men work and women stay at home). The actions of the husband and wife in terms of [[facial expression]], body movement, etc. are seen as the mental dimension and are understood as a function of behavioral investment. The physiological make up of the organ systems and cells of each body is seen as the biogenetic dimension. Finally, the position, temperature, molecular make up is seen as the physiochemical dimension. Each of the more basic dimensions represent conditions of possibility that allow for the emergence of the higher dimension of process. Thus, insufficient oxygen disrupts organic processes which in turn renders neuropsychological and sociolinguistic processes impossible.

==Toward the integration of human knowledge==

As stated above, the ToK System proposes a new [[epistemology]] with the goal of moving academic knowledge toward what [[E.O. Wilson]] termed [[consilience]]. Consilience is the interlocking of fact and theory into a coherent, holistic view of knowledge. Henriques argues that the ToK affords new perspectives on how knowledge is obtained because it depicts how science emerges from culture and that the four dimensions of complexity correspond to four broad classes of science: the physical, biological, psychological and social sciences.

Henriques further argues that developing such a system for integrating knowledge is not just an academic enterprise. He suggests that in an increasingly complex world, the fragmented state of knowledge can be seen as one of the most pressing social problems of our time. Henriques also believes that history seems to attest that the absence of a collective worldview ostensibly condemns humanity to an endless series of conflicts that inevitably stem from incompatible, partially correct, locally situated justification systems. Thus, from Henriques' perspective, there are good reasons for believing that if there was a shared, general background of explanation, humanity might be able to achieve much greater levels of harmonious relations.
  
In a 2008 article on the ToK,&lt;ref&gt;Henriques, G.R. (2008). The problem of psychology and the integration of human knowledge: Contrasting Wilson's Consilience with the Tree of Knowledge System. ''Theory &amp; Psychology, 18,'' 731–755. [http://psychweb.cisat.jmu.edu/ToKSystem/My%20ToK%20Papers/PPIHPRevised.pdf Final draft]&lt;/ref&gt; Henriques cites [[Oliver Reiser]]'s 1958 call for unifying scientific knowledge that Henriques implies is similar in theme to the ToK:

::''In this time of divisive tendencies within and between the nations, races, religions, sciences and humanities, synthesis must become the great magnet which orients us all…[Yet] scientists have not done what is possible toward integrating bodies of knowledge created by science into a unified interpretation of man, his place in nature, and his potentialities for creating the good society. Instead, they are entombing us in dark and meaningless catacombs of learning.''&lt;ref&gt;Reiser, O.L. (1958). The integration of human knowledge. Boston: Porter Sargent.&lt;/ref&gt;

With its depiction of the dimensions of complexity and interlocking theoretical joint points, Henriques' believes that his  ToK System offers new avenues that might allow scholars to meet Reiser’s call for academic synthesis. Henriques, like Reiser, believes that with a shared sense of purpose and a common background of explanation, people might yet be able to integrate bodies of knowledge into a unified interpretation of humanity, with humanity's place in nature and its potentialities for creating the good society.

The '''Department of Computer Science''' is one of nine departments in the [[University of the Philippines Diliman]] [[UP College of Engineering|College of Engineering]].

==Academic programs==
The Department of Computer Science administers the four-year bachelor of science in computer science program and the master of science in computer science program. As of AY 2009-2010, the department had 553 undergraduate and 89 graduate students mentored by 27 faculty members, seven of whom are PhD degree holders.

===Undergraduate===
The bachelor of science in computer science program is designed to equip the student with knowledge of the fundamental concepts and a reasonable mastery of the basic tools and techniques in computer science. The undergraduate program incorporates the core material, which is universally accepted as common to computer science undergraduate programs ([[computer programming]], computer organization, [[computer system]]s, [[data structures]] and [[algorithms]], file processing, and [[programming languages]]). Underpinning the software orientation of the program are the subjects on [[database systems]], [[software engineering]], [[artificial intelligence]], [[computer networks]] and special problems (primarily, software projects).

===Graduate===
The master of science in computer science program aims to provide the student with both breadth and depth of knowledge in the concepts and techniques related to the design, programming, and application of computing systems.

The doctor of philosophy in computer science program aims to develop computer scientists who are armed with methods, tools and techniques from both theoretical and systems aspects of computing. They should be able to formulate computing problems and develop new and innovative technology as novel solutions to address those problems. The graduates gain expertise to independently contribute to research and development (R&amp;D) in a specialized area of computer science. The program prepares graduates for professional and research careers in industry, government or academe.

==History==
The Department of Computer Science is the youngest department of the college. Its beginnings can be traced to the mid-1970s with the insititution of the master of engineering in computer science (Mengg CS) program. This was jointly administered by three departments: the Department of Engineering Sciences (ES) and the Department of Electrical Engineering (EE), and the Department of Mathematics, of the College of Science. Led by the Department of Engineering Sciences, the Mengg CS program continued in the early 1980s until it was replaced by the bachelor in computer science (BCS) program.

As with the master's program, the BCS program was also a joint undertaking of the ES, EE, and Mathematics departments. An initial batch of 35 shiftees from more than 200 applicants from various colleges in the UPD were admitted into the program in the second semester of AY 1982-1983. Of the 35, 32 finished the course, 12 with Latin honors. In this first batch of computer science graduates was the 1986 engineering class valedictorian.

In August 1988, the BOR approved the renaming of the ES Department to 'Department of Engineering and Computer Sciences (ECS)' to reflect the expertise available in the department. Three years later, in August 1991, the ECS was split into two independent departments - taking ES back to its original name (Department of Engineering Sciences) and establishing the Department of Computer Science (DCS). The new department took full responsibility of offering the BCS program, which was subsequently renamed "bachelor of science in computer science program".

In May 1995, twenty years after the institution of the pioneering, but now defunct, MEngg CS program, the BOR approved the institution of a new master of science in computer science (MSCS) program. Furthermore, in 2010, the BOR approved the institution of a doctor of philosophy in computer science (PhD CS) program. Both the BSCS and the graduate programs continue to attract some of the best students in UP Diliman.

As of the end of the seconds semester of AY 2009-2010, the BCS/BSCS program had produced a total of 1191 graduates, 224 with Latin honors: 161 ''cum laude'', 59 ''magna cum laude'' and 4 ''summa cum laude''.

An '''V0-morph''' is an [[organism]] that changes in shape during growth such that its surface area is proportional to its volume to the power 0, so its surface area is constant.

The reason why the concept is important in the context of the [[Dynamic Energy Budget]] theory is that food (substrate) uptake is proportional to surface area, and maintenance to volume. The surface area that is of importance is that part that is involved in substrate uptake.

[[Biofilm]]s on a flat solid substrate are examples of V0-morphs; they grow in thickness, but not in surface area that is involved in nutrient exchange. Other examples are [[dinophyta]] and [[diatom]]s that have a cell wall that does not change during the cell cycle. During cell-growth, when the amounts of protein and carbohydrates increase, the vacuole shrinks. The outer membrane that is involved in nutrient uptake remains constant. At cell division, the daughter cells rapidly take up water, complete a new cell wall and the cycle repeats.

[[Eubacteria|Rod]]s (bacteria that have the shape of a rod and grow in length, but not in diameter) are a '''static mixture''' between a V0- and a [[V1-morph]], where the caps act as V0-morphs and the cylinder between the caps as V1-morph.The mixture is called static because the weight coefficients of the contributions of the V0- and V1-morph terms in the [[shape correction function]] are constant during growth.

[[Crust (geology)|Crust]]s, such as [[lichen]]s that grow on a solid substrate, are a '''dynamic mixture''' between a V0- and a V1-morph, where the inner part acts as V0-morph, and the outer annulus as V1-morph.The mixture is called dynamic because the weight coefficients of the contributions of the V0- and V1-morph terms in the [[shape correction function]] change during growth.The [[Dynamic Energy Budget]] theory explains why the diameter of crusts grow linearly in time at constant substrate availability.

The '''Yungas''' ([[Aymara language|Aymara]] ''yunka'' warm or temperate [[Andes]] or earth, [[Quechua language|Quechua]] ''yunka'' warm area on the slopes of the Andes)&lt;ref&gt;{{Ref Bertonio}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Ref Laime}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a narrow band of forest along the eastern slope of the [[Andes Mountains]] from [[Peru]], [[Bolivia]], and northern [[Argentina]]. It is a transitional zone between the Andean highlands and the eastern forests. Like the surrounding areas, the Yungas belong to the [[Neotropic]] [[ecozone]]; the climate is rainy, humid, and warm.

== Setting ==
The Yungas forests are extremely diverse, ranging from moist lowland forest to evergreen [[montane forest]] and [[cloud forest]]s. The terrain, formed by [[valley]]s, fluvial [[mountain trail]]s and [[stream]]s, is extremely rugged and varied, contributing to the ecological diversity and richness. A complex mosaic of habitats occur with changing latitude as well as elevation. There are high levels of [[biodiversity]] and [[Endemic (ecology)|species endemism]] throughout the Yungas regions. Many of the forests are evergreen, and the South Andean Yungas contains what may be the last evergreen forests resulting from [[Quaternary]] glaciations.

=== World Wildlife ecoregions ===
The [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] has delineated three yungas [[ecoregions]] along the eastern side of the Andes:
* The northernmost is the '''[[Peruvian Yungas]]''', located entirely within [[Peru]] and stretching nearly the whole length of the country.
* The '''[[Bolivian Yungas]]''' lies to the south, mostly in Bolivia. The [[Inambari River]] marks the boundary between the Peruvian Yungas and Bolivian Yungas since the yungas north and south of the river have distinct ecological differences.
* The '''[[Southern Andean Yungas]]''' begins in southern Bolivia and continues to the north of [[Argentina]]. It is a humid forest region between the drier [[Gran Chaco]] region to the east and the dry, high altitude [[Puna grassland|Puna]] region to the west.

Yungas are transitional zones between the Andean highlands and the eastern forests. The yungas forests are extremely diverse, ranging from moist lowland forest to evergreen montane forest and cloud forests. The terrain is extremely rugged and varied, contributing to the ecological diversity and richness. A complex mosaic of habitats occur with changing latitude as well as elevation. There are high levels of biodiversity and species endemism throughout the yungas regions. Many of the forests are evergreen, and the South Andean Yungas contains what may be the last evergreen forests resulting from Quaternary glaciations.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nationalgeographic.com/wildworld/terrestrial.html map of the ecoregions&lt;/ref&gt;

===Climate===
The average temperature is 72°F (22&amp;nbsp;°C). The climate is varied and ranges from a humid [[Tropical climate|tropical]] to the cold of the Andes over 10,000 ft (3,000 m).

==Peruvian Yungas==
{{Main|Peruvian Yungas}}
In Peru there is a difference between Yunga and Yungas. '''Yunga''' is considered a natural region on both sides of the Peruvian Andes, the western side towards the coast is called Sea Yunga, and the eastern side into the jungle is called Fluvial Yunga, both reach a height of 2,300 m.

Instead, '''Yungas''' is the ecoregion of rain forest and montane forest from 1.000 to 3.500 m, so it is limited to the eastern side of the Andes. This concept has a closer analogy with the Bolivian Yungas. This region is considered as the most endemic biodiversity of Peru.

Forest loss in the Peruvian Yungas has sharply accelerated since the 2000s, rising seven-fold between 2005 and late 2012, according to satellite analysis by Terra-i.&lt;ref&gt;Butler, Rhett: [http://news.mongabay.com/2014/0119-rhinella-yunga-toad-peru.html Red toad discovered in the upper reaches of the Amazon] Mongabay.com. Retrieved 21 Jan 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sea Yunga===
'''Sea Yunga''', or Maritime Yunga, is found between '''500 and 2,300 m''' and it is situated between the eastern part of the coastal strip and the western part of the Highlands. This subregion has a [[subtropics|subtropical]] [[desert]] climate with little rainfall along the central and southern coast (drier as you go south). The average year round day temperature is {{Convert|21|C|F}} (max 33&amp;nbsp;°C min 8&amp;nbsp;°C). A mist-fed ecosystem called [[Lomas]] is found at scattered locations among hills near the Pacific Ocean at elevations up to {{convert|1000|m|ft}}.  

The '''flora''' in the central Sea Yungas region is mainly composed by the lucuma and chirimoya trees, the [[casuarin]] and others.

Once you go north its climate becomes [[subtropics|subtropical]] in the vicinity of La Libertad, Lambayeque and Piura. Day time temperatures average between {{Convert|21|C|F}} and {{Convert|25|C|F}} depending on latitude (max 40&amp;nbsp;°C min 15&amp;nbsp;°C).

As this area approaches the tropics, fauna differs from the rest of the coast, so that animals like the [[Boidae|boa]]s, larger [[reptile]]s and the famous [[white-winged guan]] (a bird species unique to this Peruvian ecoregion) occur here. Common trees in this area are the faique, the [[zapote]], the zapayal, the ''[[Bombax barrigon|barrigon]]'' and other thorny [[tropical savanna]] trees of the [[equatorial climate|equatorial]] dry [[forest]]s on the northern coast of Piura and Tumbes.

The cooler Pacific side is more vaguely characterized. The dry and cool ''Yunga Costal'' begins at 500&amp;nbsp;m above sea level. The Maritime Yunga begins dry, and it seems to follow [[ecotone]] on ecotone until reaching the Quechua region at the Pacific side.

=== Fluvial Yunga ===

'''Fluvial Yunga''' is between the altitudes of {{convert|1000|m|ft}} and {{convert|2300|m|ft}} and is found on the eastern part of Peru. This sub-region has a [[subtropics|subtropical]] climate with ample seasonal rains. The average temperature fluctuates between 20&amp;nbsp;°C and 25&amp;nbsp;°C depending on the altitude (max 35&amp;nbsp;°C, min 11&amp;nbsp;°C).

'''Concept:'''

The concept of the east side of the continental divide is straightforward: 1,000&amp;nbsp;m above sea level it is 4.9&amp;nbsp;°C cooler, and the subtropical cloud forest (Fluvial Yunga) follows the tropical rainforest (Anti). At 2,300 m, the climate transitions from subtropical climate to temperate climate ([[Quechua (geography)|Quechua]]). The [[Tree line]] ends at 3,500 m and has an annual mean temperature of 10&amp;nbsp;°C. The region between the [[tree line]] and 4,000 m is called [[Suni (geography)|Suni]] or Jalca. Suni is a dry and cold region with many glacial valleys. Despite the harsh weather, crops such as [[quinoa]], maca, [[Kañiwa|qañiwa]], [[Vicia faba|broad beans]] and [[Ulluco|ulluku]] are cultivated here.

==== Flora and fauna ====

The '''flora''' (subtropical [[cloud forest]]) of the Yunga region is mainly composed by the [[Schinus molle|Peruvian pepper tree]], the [[Furcraea]], white [[Fique|cabuya]] (Furcraea andina), the [[Pitaya|pitahaya]] and the [[Peruvian torch cactus]] (''Echinopsis peruviana'').  The [[coca]] leaf is established in this region as well as the [[Uncaria tomentosa|uña de gato]] ("cat's claw", ''[[Uncaria tomentosa]]''). The most attractive sites of this warm refreshing region are its many [[orchid]] forests and beautiful valleys. The '''fauna''' in the Yunga region is characterized by the [[long-tailed mockingbird]], or chaucato.&lt;ref&gt;Pulgar Vidal, Javier: Geografía del Perú; Las Ocho Regiones Naturales del Perú. Edit.

===Human use===
In the early 20th century, the region was a major source for [[rubber]] and [[quinine]]. Now, [[coffee]], [[citrus]], and [[coca]] are important crops. People cultivate native plants like the [[canistel]] or eggfruit tree the [[Lúcuma|lúcuma tree]], the [[cherimoya|cherimoya or chirimoya]], the [[guava|guava or guayabo]] and the [[avocado|avocado or palta]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

The [[Afro Bolivian]] community is concentrated here.

The [[Yungas Cocalera Revolution]] is based in the region. Its name derives from the one applied for the same mountain level by those who study the economic system of the prehispanic Andes.
&lt;!-- ==Conservation and threats== --&gt;

The Yungas also bear the most dangerous road in the world, called the "camino de la muerte," or [[Yungas Road|Highway of Death]].

Due to the mountainous terrain an entrepreneurial coca harvester created a network of [[zip line]]s that permit rapid travel from peak to peak by farmers, referred to locally as flying men or bird men, along with their harvests using [[Zip line trolley|zip line trollies]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/2011/05/20115811409577464.html The flying men of Yungas Valley]&lt;/ref&gt;
