The '''A361''' is a major [[road]] in England and at {{convert|195|mi}} is the longest 3 digit A road in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Road Facts and Figures|url=http://www.sabre-roads.org.uk/wiki/index.php?title=Road_Facts_and_Figures|publisher=SABRE|accessdate=9 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It runs south from [[Ilfracombe]] on the north [[Devon]] coast to [[Barnstaple]], turning south-east to [[Tiverton, Devon|Tiverton]] then, after a break (the [[M5 motorway|M5]] connects the two sections), north east from [[Taunton]] in [[Somerset]] through [[Street, Somerset|Street]] and [[Glastonbury]], past [[Frome]] and then into [[Wiltshire]] through [[Trowbridge]], [[Devizes]], [[Avebury, Wiltshire|Avebury]] and [[Swindon]].  It then runs through the eastern [[Cotswolds]], via [[Lechlade]], [[Burford]] and [[Chipping Norton, Oxfordshire|Chipping Norton]] and on through [[Banbury]] and [[Daventry]] before terminating at its junction with the [[A5 road (Great Britain)|A5 road]] at the village of [[Kilsby]] on the [[Northamptonshire]]-[[Warwickshire]] border near [[Rugby, Warwickshire|Rugby]]. Despite being long, the majority is non-primary and relatively unimportant.

==History==
When first designated in 1922 the A361 ran only from Taunton to Banbury.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sabre-roads.org.uk/roadlists/1922.shtml#3 1922 road list]&lt;/ref&gt;  It was later extended west though [[Bampton, Devon|Bampton]] to [[South Molton]], on the route of the former A398, and from South Molton to Barnstaple and Ilfracombe, previously part of the route of the [[A373 road|A373]].  In 1988, when the [[North Devon Link Road]] was opened, the A361 was switched to its present route.  The old route from Taunton through Bampton to South Molton was downgraded to become the B3227. In the 1970s the route was extended north from Banbury to Daventry, providing a link to the [[M1 motorway]] near [[Crick, Northamptonshire|Crick]].

==Route==

===Devon===
[[File:Castle Hill viaduct.jpg|thumb|left|The pillars of Castle Hill Viaduct have been reused for the North Devon Link road]]
The road starts in Ilfracombe as part of the town's High Street, and is mostly single carriageway. The road passes through the villages of Knowle and Braunton, before becoming [[dual carriageway]] standard at Ashford, which continues for the short distance to Barnstaple. From there it passes the town's railway station then merges with the [[A39 road|A39]] for a short while before splitting back off near Portmore Golf Park. The section from Barnstaple to the M5 near Tiverton has been designated the North Devon Link Road, and enables relatively fast access to the [[A39 road|Atlantic Highway]], relieving pressure on the northern section of the A39 and A358. This section is a modern, wide single carriageway [[trunk road]] (which was de-trunked in 2002), apart from the {{convert|5|mi|adj=on}} stretch between Tiverton and the M5, which is dual carriageway. [[Tiverton Parkway railway station]] is situated close to the junction with the motorway in order to give easy rail connections for people driving from north Devon. Some sections of road are on the alignment of the [[Devon and Somerset Railway]], including the Castle Hill Viaduct over the River Bray, where the stone pillars formerly used to support a lattice girder railway bridge now support the road.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.gracesguide.co.uk/Filleigh_Viaduct | title= Filleigh Viaduct| work = gracesguide | accessdate = 16 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Somerset and Wiltshire===
The road is merged with the [[A38 road|A38]] from Junction 27 of the [[M5 motorway|M5]] until [[Taunton]]. The rest of the road, from there to Swindon, is largely county-road class. It crosses the [[Somerset Levels]] separating [[Curry and Hay Moors|Curry Moor]] from North Moor and Salt Moor, where in flood conditions such as the winter of 2012/2013 the Athelney spillway runs across the road&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNJZrW6vudY | title=Floods on Somerset Moors (levels) 25 Nov 2012 near East Lyng | publisher=David Orr | accessdate=1 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; if the drain level at Curry Moor pumping station exceeds 7.1m,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=  http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/homeandleisure/floods/34681.aspx?area=112FWFEAS10A | title=Flood Warnings A361 East Lyng to Burrowbridge | publisher=Environment Agency  | accessdate=25 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; making the road impassable. Next, it passes by the towns of Langport and Glastonbury and briefly merges with the [[A39 road|A39]] again. From there it continues northeast near [[Cranmore, Somerset|Cranmore]] (the home of the [[East Somerset Railway]]) and becomes part of [[Frome]] bypass; entering Wiltshire, it then passes through [[Trowbridge]] and [[Devizes]]. It crosses the [[A4 road (England)|A4]] at Beckhampton and from here, northwards through [[Avebury, Wiltshire|Avebury]], the A361 has been renumbered the '''A4361''' as it heads for [[Swindon]] town centre via [[Wroughton]]. It emerges near [[Stratton St Margaret]], becoming the A361 again at the junction with the [[A419 road|A419]] which passes northeast of Swindon.

===Wiltshire and Gloucestershire===
[[File:Geograph 3149032 Lechlade Road A361.jpg|thumb|left|Lechlade Road looking towards Highworth]]
This road links [[Highworth]] to [[Lechlade]] and has no pavement for the entire length apart from a small section in [[Inglesham]].  It carries traffic at high speeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.swindon.gov.uk/download/downloads/id/1104/conservation_area_appraisal_-_upper_inglesham.pdf |format=PDF |page=11 |title=Upper Inglesham Conservation Area Appraisal and Management Plan |publisher=Swindon Borough Council |accessdate=28 June 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Thames Path]] National Trail follows the verge for a little over one mile between Upper Inglesham and [[Inglesham]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=  http://www.bertuchi.co.uk/Thamespath02.php | title=Thames Path&amp;nbsp;— Part 2 Cricklade to Lechlade | publisher=Tim Bertuchi | accessdate=14 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Thames Path - Route Description|url=http://www.nationaltrail.co.uk/thames-path/routes|website=National Trails|accessdate=18 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; further north the road crosses the [[Thames]] on entering Lechlade, Gloucestershire.

===Oxfordshire and Northamptonshire===
From there it continues through Lechlade, Burford and [[Chipping Norton, Oxfordshire|Chipping Norton]] passing many Oxfordshire villages on its way. It is also the boundary for the [[Cotswolds AONB]] at Lechlade. It then enters [[Banbury]] from the southwest as an arterial road passing the Banbury Cross, and heading north, the A361 [[Concurrency (road)#United Kingdom|multiplexes]] on the Southam Road roundabout of the [[A422 road|A422]]. For about two miles the route is signed as [[A422 road|A422]], the dual carriageway Hennef Way until Junction 11 of the [[M40 motorway|M40]]. From there it heads northeast through the villages of [[Wardington]], [[Chipping Warden]], [[Byfield, Northamptonshire|Byfield]], [[Charwelton]], and [[Badby]]. Sections of land were purchased in the 1970s after the road was upgraded from the [[B4038 road|B4038]] to the A361 to straighten out some of the sharper corners but the vast majority of these works were never done. The road then multiplexes once more, this time with the [[A45 road|A45]] just outside [[Daventry]]. Once the A45 leaves Daventry for [[Coventry]], the remaining section of single carriageway ring road is signed as A361, before it once again turns north to [[Kilsby]] to terminate on the [[A5 road (Great Britain)|A5]] at its northern end.

The A361 has been re-numbered the '''A4361''' from its junction with the [[A4 road (England)|A4]] immediately south of Avebury, northwards &amp;mdash; becoming the A361 again at the junction with the [[A419 road|A419]] which passes north-east of Swindon.

The [[European Union]] maintains delegations with the rank of [[embassy]] in [[List of diplomatic missions of the European Union|many third countries]], but there are delegations that are accredited to more than one foreign state. In some cases the accreditation country also hosts a [[consulate]] rank EU diplomatic office.

==Accreditations==

Similarly to [[ambassador]]s there are heads of delegations accredited to additional countries, besides their country of residence. Countries with accredited head of delegation resident elsewhere, that are hosts to an office subordinate to another delegation are marked with '''*'''.

'''Amerigo Vespucci''' ({{IPAc-en|v|ɛ|ˈ|s|p|uː|tʃ|i}};&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/vespucci "Vespucci"]. ''[[Collins English Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA-it|ameˈriːɡo veˈsputtʃi|lang}}; March 9, 1454{{spaced ndash}}February 22, 1512) was an [[Italians|Italian]] [[explorer]], [[financier]], [[navigator]] and [[cartographer]]. Born in the [[Republic of Florence]], he became a naturalized citizen of the [[Crown of Castile]] in 1505.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Amerigo Vespucci|website=Biography.com|url=https://www.biography.com/people/amerigo-vespucci-9517978}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vespucci first demonstrated in about 1502 that [[Brazil]] and the [[West Indies]] did not represent Asia's eastern outskirts as initially conjectured from [[Voyages of Christopher Columbus|Columbus' voyages]], but instead constituted an entirely separate landmass hitherto unknown to people of the [[Old World]]. Colloquially referred to as the [[New World]], it came to be termed "[[Naming of the Americas|the Americas]]", a name derived from ''Americus'', the [[Latinisation of names|Latin]] version of Vespucci's [[Given name|first name]].&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. Encyclopædia Britannica Online, ''Amerigo Vespucci''; and Room, Adrian. 2004. Placenames of the world: origins and meanings of the names for over 5000 natural features, countries, capitals, territories, cities and historic sights: ''Americas'' are believed to have [[Americas#Naming|derived their name]] from the [[Grammatical gender|feminized]] [[Latin]] version of his [[Given name|first name]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rival explanations have been proposed (see  Arciniegas, Germán. ''Amerigo and the New World: The Life &amp; Times of Amerigo Vespucci''. Translated by Harriet de Onís. New York: Octagon Books, 1978.{{specify|date=November 2010}}&lt;!--page?--&gt;) For example, some have speculated that the name's origin may lie with [[Richard Amerike]] [http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/tudors/americaname_03.shtml BBC], or with the region [[Amerrique]] in [[Nicaragua]]. None of these theories has been accepted in mainstream academia.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
[[File:Birthplace of Amerigo Vespucci · HHWIX645.jpg|left|thumb|The birthplace of Amerigo Vespucci]]
Amerigo Vespucci was born and raised in [[Republic of Florence|Florence]] on the [[Italian Peninsula]]. He was the third son of Ser Nastagio (Anastasio) Vespucci, a Florentine [[notary]], and Lisabetta Mini.&lt;ref name = markham&gt;C.R. Markham (1894) "Introduction", in ''The Letters of Amerigo Vespucci and other documents illustrative of his career''.  London: Hakluyt.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Christopher Bickle ''[[et alii]]'' [https://www.geni.com/people/Ser-Nastagio-Anastasio-Vespucci/6000000050473130275 page: 6000000050473130275] Geni November 28, 2016 Retrieved 2017-02-23&lt;/ref&gt;  The father of Ser Nastagio (Anastasio) Vespucci had the name Amerigo Vespucci also.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Christopher Bickle ''[[et alii]]'' - [https://www.geni.com/people/Amerigo-Vespucci/6000000050483095880 page:6000000050483095880] Geni November 28, 2016 Retrieved 2017-02-23&lt;/ref&gt; His family lived close to the [[Ognissanti, Florence|Ognissanti church]], the church of "All Saints", also dedicated to san Salvatore, the "saint Saviour": these familiar places may have influenced the later decision to name the [[Bay of All Saints]] and the city of [[Salvador, Bahia]].&lt;ref&gt;Piero Bargellini, Ennio Guarnieri, Le strade di Firenze, 4 voll., Firenze, Bonechi, 1977-1978, II, 1977, pp. 337–340.&lt;/ref&gt;

Amerigo Vespucci was educated by his uncle, Fra Giorgio Antonio Vespucci, a [[Dominican Order|Dominican friar]] of [[San Marco, Florence|the monastery of San Marco]] in Florence. While his elder brothers were sent to the [[University of Pisa]] to pursue scholarly careers, Amerigo Vespucci embraced a [[mercantile]] life, and was hired as a clerk by the Florentine commercial [[Medici bank|house of Medici]], headed by [[Lorenzo de' Medici]].  Vespucci acquired the favor and protection of [[Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de' Medici]], who became the head of the business after the elder Lorenzo's death in 1492. In March 1492, the Medici dispatched the thirty-eight-year-old Vespucci and Donato Niccolini as confidential agents to look into the Medici branch office in [[Cádiz]] (Spain), whose managers and dealings were under suspicion.&lt;ref name = markham /&gt;

In April 1495, by the intrigues of Bishop [[Juan Rodríguez de Fonseca]], the [[Crown of Castile]] broke their monopoly deal with [[Christopher Columbus]] and began handing out licenses to other navigators for the [[West Indies]].  Just around this time (1495–96), Vespucci was engaged as the executor of Giannotto Berardi, an Italian merchant who had recently died in Seville. Vespucci organized the fulfillment of Berardi's outstanding contract with the Castilian crown to provide twelve vessels for the Indies.&lt;ref name = markham /&gt;  After these were delivered, Vespucci continued as a provision contractor for Indies expeditions, and is known to have secured beef supplies for at least one (if not two) of Columbus' voyages.&lt;ref name = markham /&gt;

== Expeditions ==
[[File:Amerigo Vespucci Uffizzi Florence.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|Statue outside the [[Uffizi]], Florence]]
Vespucci claimed at the invitation of king [[Manuel I of Portugal]], Vespucci participated as observer in several voyages that explored the east coast of [[South America]] between 1499 and 1502.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} On the first of these voyages Vespucci claimed he was aboard the ship that discovered that South America extended much further south than previously thought.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

Vespucci's expeditions became known in Europe after two accounts attributed to Vespucci were published between 1502 and 1503.&lt;ref name=S&gt;{{cite web|work=[[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian]]|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/the-waldseemuller-map-charting-the-new-world-148815355/|title=The Waldseemüller Map: Charting the New World|author=Lester, Toby|date=December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1507, [[Martin Waldseemüller]] produced a world map on which he named the new continent [[Americas|America]] after the feminine Latin version of Vespucci's first name, which is Americus.&lt;ref name=S/&gt; In an accompanying book, Waldseemüller published one of the Vespucci accounts, which led to criticism that Vespucci was trying to upset [[Christopher Columbus]]' glory. However, the rediscovery in the 18th century of other letters by Vespucci has led to the view that the early published accounts, notably the [[The Americas#Etymology and naming|Soderini Letter]], could be fabrications, not by Vespucci, but by others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Roukema|first=E.|date=1962|title=The Mythical "First Voyage" of the "Soderini Letter"|jstor=1150303|journal=Imago Mundi|volume=16|pages=70–75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historical role ==
In 1508, the position of chief of navigation of Spain (''piloto mayor de Indias'') was created for Vespucci, with the responsibility of planning navigation for voyages to the Indies.
[[File:Vespucci arrives in New World.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|left|Vespucci's first encounter with Native Americans in Honduras, 1497 ([[Theodor de Bry|De Bry]]'s  illustration, c.1592)]]
Two letters attributed to Vespucci were published during his lifetime. ''[[Mundus Novus]]'' (New World) was a Latin translation of a lost Italian letter sent from [[Lisbon]] to Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de' Medici. It describes a voyage to South America in 1501–1502. ''Mundus Novus'' was published in late 1502 or early 1503 and soon reprinted and distributed in numerous European countries.&lt;ref name=formisano&gt;Formisano, Luciano (Ed.) (1992). ''Letters from a New World: Amerigo Vespucci's Discovery of America''. New York: Marsilio. {{ISBN|0-941419-62-2}}. Pp. xix–xxvi.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Lettera di Amerigo Vespucci delle isole nuovamente trovate in quattro suoi viaggi'' (Letter of Amerigo Vespucci concerning the isles newly discovered on his four voyages), known as ''Lettera al Soderini'' or just ''Lettera'', was a letter in Italian addressed to [[Piero Soderini]]. Printed in 1504 or 1505, it claimed to be an account of four voyages to the Americas made by Vespucci between 1497 and 1504. A Latin translation was published by the German [[Martin Waldseemüller]] in 1507 in ''[[Cosmographiae Introductio]]'', a book on [[cosmography]] and [[geography]], as ''Quattuor Americi Vespucij navigationes'' (Four Voyages of Amerigo Vespucci).&lt;ref name=formisano/&gt;

On March 22, 1508, [[Ferdinand II of Aragon|King Ferdinand]] made Vespucci chief navigator of Spain at a huge salary&lt;ref&gt;Ober, p. 234&lt;/ref&gt; and commissioned him to found a school of navigation, in order to standardize and modernize navigation techniques used by Iberian sea captains then exploring the world. Vespucci even developed a rudimentary, but fairly accurate method of determining longitude (which only more accurate chronometers would later improve upon).&lt;ref&gt;Vespucci, Amerigo. "Letter from Seville to Lorenzo di Pier Francesco de' Medici, 1500." Pohl, Frederick J. '''Amerigo Vespucci: Pilot Major'''. New York: Columbia University Press, 1945. 76–90. Page 80.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cannibalism in the New World, from Vespucci.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|The first known depiction of [[cannibalism]] in the New World. Engraving by Johann Froschauer for an edition of Amerigo Vespucci's ''Mundus Novus'', published in Augsburg in 1505]]
In the 18th century, three unpublished familiar letters from Vespucci to Lorenzo de' Medici were rediscovered. One describes a voyage made in 1499–1500 which corresponds with the second of the "four voyages". Another was written from [[Cap-Vert|Cape Verde]] in 1501 in the early part of the third of the four voyages, before crossing the Atlantic. The third letter was sent from Lisbon after the completion of that voyage.&lt;ref name=formisano /&gt;

Some have suggested that Vespucci, in the two letters published in his lifetime, was exaggerating his role and constructed deliberate fabrications. However, many scholars now believe that the two letters were not written by him but were fabrications by others based in part on genuine letters by Vespucci. It was the publication and widespread circulation of the letters that might have led Waldseemüller to name the new continent [[Americas|America]] on his world map of 1507 in [[Lorraine (province)|Lorraine]]. Vespucci used a [[Latinization (literature)|Latinised]] form of his name, ''Americus Vespucius'', in his [[Latin]] writings, which Waldseemüller used as a base for the new name, taking the feminine form ''America'', according to the prevalent view. The book accompanying the map stated: "I do not see what right any one would have to object to calling this part, after Americus who discovered it and who is a man of intelligence, Amerige, that is, the Land of Americus, or America: since both Europa and Asia got their names from women". It is possible that Vespucci was not aware that Waldseemüller had named the continent after him.&lt;ref&gt;Ray, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt;

The two disputed letters claim that Vespucci made four voyages to America, while at most two can be verified from other sources. At the moment, there is a dispute between historians on when Vespucci visited the mainland the first time. Some historians like [[Germán Arciniegas]]&lt;ref&gt;Germán Arciniegas, ''Amerigo and the New World : The Life &amp; Times of Amerigo Vespucci'', translated by Harriet de Onís, Octagon (1978) {{ISBN|0-374-90280-1}}
&lt;/ref&gt; and Gabriel Camargo Pérez think that his first voyage was made in June 1497 with the Spanish pilot [[Juan de la Cosa]].

Vespucci's real historical importance may well rest more in his letters, whether he wrote them all or not, than in his discoveries. From these letters, the European public learned about the newly discovered continents of the Americas for the first time; their existence became generally known throughout Europe within a few years of the letters' publication. In his words:&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=upkyAQAAMAAJ Mundus Novus: Letter to Lorenzo Pietro Di Medici], by Amerigo Vespucci;
 translated by George Tyler Northrup, Princeton University Press, 1916.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;''..concerning my return from those new regions which we found and explored ... we may rightly call a new world. Because our ancestors had no knowledge of them, and it will be a matter wholly new to all those who hear about them, for this transcends the view held by our ancients, inasmuch as most of them hold that there is no continent to the south beyond the equator, but only the sea which they named the Atlantic and if some of them did aver that a continent there was, they denied with abundant argument that it was a habitable land. But that this their opinion is false and utterly opposed to the truth ... my last voyage has made manifest; for in those southern parts I have found a continent more densely peopled and abounding in animals than our Europe Asia or Africa, and, in addition, a climate milder and more delightful than in any other region known to us, as you shall learn in the following account.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Voyages ==

The first and fourth voyages are perhaps fabricated, but the second and third are certain.{{ref label|5th|b|b}}

=== First voyage ===
A letter published in 1504 purports to be an account by Vespucci, written to Soderini, of a lengthy visit to the New World, leaving Spain in May 1497 and returning in October 1498. However, some modern scholars{{ref label|5th|b|b /}} have doubted that this voyage took place, and consider this letter a forgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.millersville.edu/~columbus/papers/canaday.html|title=Life of Amerigo Vespucci|publisher=Millersville.edu|date=|accessdate=2010-02-28|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100328011335/http://www.millersville.edu/~columbus/papers/canaday.html|archivedate=2010-03-28|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whoever did write the letter makes several observations of native customs, including use of [[hammock]]s and [[sweat lodge]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/1497vespucci%2Damerica.html|title=Account of alleged 1497 voyage|publisher=Fordham.edu|date=|accessdate=2010-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Second voyage ===
About 1499–1500, Vespucci joined an expedition in the service of Spain, with [[Alonso de Ojeda]] (or Hojeda) as the fleet commander. The intention was to sail around the southern end of the African mainland into the [[Indian Ocean]].&lt;ref name=OGorman&gt;{{cite book | last = O'Gorman | first = Edmundo | authorlink = Edmundo O'Gorman | title = The Invention of America | publisher = Indiana University Press | year = 1961 | pages = 106–107}}&lt;/ref&gt; After hitting land at the coast of what is now [[Guyana]], the two seem to have separated. Vespucci sailed southward, discovering the mouth of the [[Amazon River]] and reaching 6°S, before turning around and seeing [[Trinidad]] and the [[Orinoco River]] and returning to Spain by way of [[Hispaniola]]. The letter, to Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de' Medici, claims that Vespucci determined his longitude celestially
&lt;ref name=Vcelest&gt;on a rainy and stormy day with calm seas, stars could be identified
   near the horizon to judge [[latitude]]/[[longitude]]
   celestially. Although South America's [[continental shelf]]
   drops quickly into the deep ocean beyond the [[Orinoco River]],
   the mouth is on the shelf, avoiding the ocean swells
   and waves which hinder visibility of stars near the
   horizon.  Seamen who could navigate from Europe to America
   and back could chart stars on the horizon, especially
   for a [[cartographer]] like Vespucci.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
on August 23, 1499, while on this voyage. However, that claim may be fraudulent,&lt;ref name=Vcelest /&gt; which could cast doubt on the letter's credibility.

=== Third voyage (''Letter to Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de' Medici'') ===
[[File:Amerigo Vespucci (with turban).jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|Portrait engraving of Vespucci by [[Crispijn van de Passe]], which titles him "''discoverer and conqueror of Brazilian land''"]]
The last certain voyage of Vespucci was led by [[Gonçalo Coelho]] in 1501–1502 in the service of [[Portugal]]. Departing from [[Lisbon]], the fleet sailed first to [[Cap-Vert|Cape Verde]] where they met two of [[Pedro Álvares Cabral]]'s ships returning from [[India]]. In a letter from Cape Verde, Vespucci says that he hopes to visit the same lands that Álvares Cabral had explored, suggesting that the intention is to sail west to Asia, as on the 1499–1500 voyage.&lt;ref name=OGorman /&gt; On reaching the coast of [[Brazil]], they sailed south along the coast of [[South America]] to [[Rio de Janeiro]]'s bay. If his own account is to be believed, he reached the latitude of [[Patagonia]] before turning back, although this also seems doubtful, since his account does not mention the broad estuary of the [[Río de la Plata]], which he must have seen if he had gotten that far south. Portuguese maps of South America, created after the voyage of Coelho and Vespucci, do not show any land south of present-day [[Cananéia]] at 25° S, so this may represent the southernmost extent of their voyages.

After the first half of the expedition, Vespucci mapped [[Alpha Centauri|Alpha]] and [[Beta Centauri]], as well as the [[constellation]] [[Crux]], the Southern Cross and the Coalsack Nebula.&lt;ref&gt;Dekker, Elly (1990), ''Annals of Science'', vol. 47, pp. 535–543.&lt;/ref&gt; Although these [[star]]s had been known to the ancient [[Greece|Greeks]], gradual [[precession (astronomy)|precession]] had lowered them below the [[Europe]]an horizon so that they had been forgotten. On his return to Lisbon, Vespucci [[Amerigo Vespucci Letter from Seville|wrote in a letter from Seville]] to [[Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de' Medici]] that the land masses they explored were much larger than anticipated and different from the Asia described by [[Ptolemy]] or [[Marco Polo]] and therefore, must be a New World, that is, a previously unknown fourth continent, after Europe, Asia, and Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.history.com/topics/exploration/amerigo-vespucci|title=Amerigo Vespucci|work=HISTORY|access-date=2018-10-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fourth voyage ===
[[File:"America" (Engraving) Nova reperta (Speculum diuersarum imaginum speculatiuarum 1638).tif|thumb|upright=1.15|Vespucci awakens "America" in a [[Stradanus]] engraving (circa 1638)]]
Vespucci's fourth voyage was another expedition for the Portuguese crown down the eastern coast of Brazil, that set out in May 1503 and returned to Portugal in June 1504. Like his alleged first voyage, Vespucci's last voyage in 1503–1504 is also disputed to have taken place.&lt;ref&gt;Ray, p. 91&lt;/ref&gt;  The only source of information for the last voyage is the ''Letter to Soderini'',&lt;ref&gt;Markham, pp. 52–56&lt;/ref&gt; but as several modern scholars dispute Vespucci's authorship of the letter to Soderini, it is also sometimes doubted whether Vespucci undertook this trip.{{ref label|5th|b|b}}  However, Portuguese documents do confirm a voyage to Brazil was undertaken in 1503–04 by the captain [[Gonçalo Coelho]], very likely the same captain of the 1501 mapping expedition (Vespucci's third voyage), and so it is quite possible that Vespucci went on board this one as well.&lt;ref&gt;Fernández-Armesto (2007: pp. 168–169).&lt;/ref&gt;  However, it is not independently confirmed Vespucci was aboard and there are some difficulties in the reported dates and details.

The letters caused controversy after Vespucci's death, especially among the supporters of Columbus who believed Columbus' priority for the discovery of America was being undermined, and seriously damaged Vespucci's reputation.&lt;ref&gt;Ray, pp. 96–97; Arciniegas (1955: p. 16)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
Vespucci was a cousin of the husband of [[Simonetta Vespucci]]. He married Maria Cerezo. One of the very few references to Amerigo's wife is contained in a royal decree dated May 22, 1512, giving his widow, Maria Cerezo a lifetime pension of ten thousand [[Maravedí|maravedís]] per annum deducted from the salary of her husband's successor.

== Final years ==
Not long after his return to Spain, Vespucci became a Spanish citizen. On March 22, 1508 he was made the [[pilot major]] of Spain by [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] in honor of his discoveries. Vespucci also ran a school for navigators in the Spanish [[Casa de Contratación|House of Trade]], based in Seville.

He died on February 22, 1512 at his home in [[Seville]], Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QvP-m6EuU3UC&amp;pg=PA20&amp;dq=amerigo+vespucci+death&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=qm2qVN3eDcaSuAT_9IHICQ&amp;ved=0CBsQ6AEwAA|title=Amerigo Vespucci: A Primary Source Biography|last=Hoogenboom|first=Lynn|date=2005-09-01|publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group|isbn=978-1-4042-3037-8|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0eLn3I6iUtkC|title=Amerigo Vespucci|last=Donaldson-Forbes|first=Jeff|date=2002-01-01|publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-8239-5833-7|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Notes ==
:{{note label|4th|a|a}}Europeans had long conceptualized the [[Afro-Eurasia]]n landmass as divided into the same three continents known today: [[Europe]], [[Asia]], and [[Africa]].  Once [[cosmographer]]s realized that the [[New World]] was not connected to the [[Old World|Old]] (but before its true [[geography]] was fully [[map]]ped), they considered the [[Americas]] to be a single, fourth [[continent]].

:{{note label|5th|b|b}} The question of the authenticity of Vespucci's authorship of the 1504 ''Mundus Novus'' and the 1505 ''Letter of Soderini'', the only two texts published in Vespucci's lifetime, was famously raised by Magnaghi (1924). He proposed the Soderini letter was ''not'' written by Vespucci, but rather cobbled together by unscrupulous Florentine publishers, cutting and pasting together various accounts, some from Vespucci, others from elsewhere. Magnaghi was the first to propose that only the second and third voyages were true (as they are corroborated in Vespucci's other manuscript letters), while the first and fourth voyages (which are only found in the Soderini text) were fabricated by the publishers. The later (1937) discovery of a corrobotary Vespucci manuscript letter for the first voyage – the "Ridolfi fragment" (Formisiano, 1992: pp. 37–44) – means only the fourth voyage is really found in Soderini alone. The Magnaghi thesis has been a bitterly divisive factor in Vespucci scholarship.  The Magnaghi thesis was accepted and popularized by Pohl (1944) but rejected by Arciniegas (1955), who posited all four voyages as truthful.  Formisiano (1992) also rejects the Magnaghi thesis (although recognizing publishers probably fiddled with it), and declares all four voyages genuine, but in details (esp. the first) differing from Arciniegas.  Fernández-Armesto (2007: p. 128) declares the authenticity question "inconclusive", hypothesizes that the first voyage is probably just another version of the second, the third is unassailable, and the fourth probably true (but too mangled to be sure).

[[File:Oceanias Regions.png|thumb|Regions of [[Oceania]]. New Zealand is considered as part both of Australasia and of [[Polynesia]]. Varying amounts of [[Melanesia]] (traditionally all of it) also count as part of Australasia.]]

'''Australasia''', a [[region]] of [[Oceania]], comprises [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], neighbouring [[island]]s in the [[Pacific Ocean]] and, sometimes, the island of [[New Guinea]] (which is usually considered to be part of [[Melanesia]]).  [[Charles de Brosses]] coined the term (as French ''Australasie'') in ''Histoire des navigations aux terres australes''&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; (1756). He derived it from the [[Latin]] for "south of [[Asia]]" and differentiated the area from [[Polynesia]] (to the east) and the southeast Pacific ([[Magellanica]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Douglas |first=Bronwen |date=2014 |title=Science, Voyages, and Encounters in Oceania, 1511-1850 |url=  |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |page=6 |isbn= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The bulk of Australasia sits on the [[Indo-Australian Plate]], together with [[India]].

==Physical geography==
[[File:LocationAustralasia.png|thumb|Australasia]]
[[Physical geography|Physiographically]], Australasia includes [[New Zealand]], Australia (including [[Tasmania]]), and [[Melanesia]]: [[Papua New Guinea]] and neighbouring islands north and east of Australia in the Pacific Ocean.  The designation is sometimes applied to all the lands and islands of the Pacific Ocean lying between the [[equator]] and [[latitude]] [[47th parallel south|47° south]]. Papua New Guinea also includes approximately 600 offshore islands.

Most of Australasia lies on the southern portion of the [[Indo-Australian Plate]], flanked by the [[Indian Ocean]] to the west and the [[Southern Ocean]] to the south.  Peripheral territories lie on the [[Eurasian Plate]] to the northwest, the [[Philippine Plate]] to the north, and in the Pacific Ocean – including numerous [[marginal sea]]s – atop the [[Pacific Plate]] to the north and east.

==Human geography==

[[Geopolitics|Geopolitically]], ''Australasia'' sometimes refers to Australia and New Zealand together{{spaced ndash}}in the absence of another word limited to those two countries; however, the two countries are sometimes referred to collectively as the Antipodes. Sometimes the term also encompasses the island of New Guinea ([[Papua New Guinea]] and the [[Indonesia]]n part of the island). Many organisations whose names include the  prefix "[Royal] Australasian Society of ..." limit their scope of operation to just Australia and New Zealand.

[[File:Flag of Australasian team for Olympic games.svg|thumb|The 1908–12 Australasian [[Olympic symbols#Flag|Olympic Flag]]]]

In the past, Australasia has been used as a name for combined Australia/New Zealand sporting teams. Examples include [[tennis]] between 1905 and 1915, when New Zealand and Australia combined to compete in the [[Davis Cup]] international tournament, and at the [[Summer Olympic Games|Olympic Games]] of [[1908 Summer Olympics|1908]] and [[1912 Summer Olympics|1912]].

[[Anthropologist]]s, although disagreeing on details, generally support theories that call for a [[Southeast Asia|Southeastern Asian]] origin of indigenous island peoples in Australasia and neighboring subregions. The first human habitation of Australia is estimated to have occurred 50,000 or more years ago. These first Australians were the ancestors of the [[Aboriginal Australians]], who form the majority of today's [[indigenous Australians]]. They were mostly hunter-gatherers and arrived via land bridges and short sea-crossings from present-day Southeast Asia.

==Ecological geography==
{{ main|Australasia ecozone}}

[[File:Línea de Wallace.jpg|thumb|[[Wallace Line]] separates Australasian and [[Southeast Asia]]n [[fauna]].]]
[[File:Tasman Valley - Aoraki Mount Cook - Canterbury.jpg|thumb|[[Lake Pukaki]] looking to the [[Southern Alps]] of [[New Zealand]]]]
From an [[ecology|ecological]] perspective the [[Australasia ecozone]] forms a distinct region with a common geologic and evolutionary history and a great many unique [[plant|flora]] and [[animal|fauna]]. In this context, Australasia is limited to Australia, New Guinea, New Zealand, [[New Caledonia]], and neighbouring islands, including the [[Indonesia]]n islands from [[Lombok]] and [[Sulawesi]] eastward. The [[Wallace Line]] marks the biological divide from the [[Indomalaya ecozone]] of tropical [[Asia]] – [[Borneo]] and [[Bali]] lie on the western, Asian side.

Australia, New Zealand and New Caledonia are all fragments of the ancient supercontinent [[Gondwana]], the marks of which are still visible in the [[Christmas Island Seamount Province]] and other geophysical entities. These three land masses have been separated from other continents, and from one another, for millions of years. All of Australasia shares the [[Antarctic flora]], although the northern, tropical islands also share many plants with Southeast Asia.

Mainland Australia, New Guinea and Tasmania are separated from one another by shallow [[continental shelf|continental shelves]], and were linked together when the sea level was lower during the [[Ice Ages]]. They share a similar fauna which includes [[marsupial]] and [[monotreme]] mammals and [[ratite]] birds. [[Eucalypt]]s are the predominant trees in much of Australia and New Guinea. New Zealand has no extant native land mammals aside from [[bats]] ([[Saint Bathans Mammal|though it once did]]), but also had ratite birds, including the [[kiwi]] and the extinct [[moa]]. The Australasia ecozone includes some nearby island groups, like [[Wallacea]], the [[Bismarck Archipelago]], [[Solomon Islands]], and [[Vanuatu]], which were not formerly part of Gondwana, but which share many characteristic plants and animals with Australasia.

The '''Australasian ecozone''' is an ecological region that is coincident, but not synonymous (by some definitions), with the geographic region of Australasia. The ecozone includes Australia, the island of [[New Guinea]] (including [[Papua New Guinea]] and the [[Indonesian provinces|Indonesian province]] of [[Papua (province)|Papua]]), and the eastern part of the [[Indonesian Archipelago|Indonesian archipelago]], including the island of [[Sulawesi]], the [[Maluku Islands|Maluku islands]] (the [[Indonesian provinces]] of [[Maluku (province)|Maluku]] and [[North Maluku]]) and islands of [[Lombok]], [[Sumbawa]], [[Sumba]], [[Flores]] and [[Timor]], often known as the [[Lesser Sunda Islands|Lesser Sundas]]. The Australasian ecozone also includes several Pacific island groups, including the [[Bismarck Archipelago]], [[Vanuatu]], the [[Solomon Islands]], and [[New Caledonia]]. New Zealand and its surrounding islands are a distinctive sub-region of the Australasian ecozone. The rest of Indonesia is part of the [[Indomalayan ecozone]].

From a biological point of view, Australasia is a distinct region with a common evolutionary history and a great many unique plants and animals, some of them common to the entire area, others specific to particular parts but sharing a common ancestry. The long isolation of Australasia from other continents allowed it to evolve relatively independently, which makes it home to many unique families of plants and animals.

[[Australia]] and [[New Guinea]] are distinguished by their [[marsupial]] [[mammal]]s, including [[kangaroo]]s, [[Common brushtail possum in New Zealand|possums]], and [[wombat]]s. The last remaining monotreme mammals, the [[echidna]]s and the [[platypus]], are [[Endemism|endemic]] to Australasia. Prior to the arrival of humans about 50,000 years ago, only about one-third of Australasian mammal species were [[Placentalia|placental]].

The boundary between Australasia and [[Indomalayan realm|Indomalaya]] follows the Wallace Line, named after the naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace who noted the differences in mammal and bird fauna between the islands either side of the line. The Islands to the west of the line, including [[Java]], [[Bali]], [[Borneo]], and the [[Philippines]] share a similar [[fauna]] with [[East Asia]], including [[tiger]]s, [[rhinoceros]], and [[ape]]s. During the [[ice age]]s, [[sea level]]s were lower, exposing the continental shelf that links these islands to one another and to [[Asia]], and allowed Asian land animals to inhabit these islands. Similarly, Australia and [[New Guinea]] are linked by a shallow continental shelf, and were linked by a land bridge during the ice ages. A group of Australasian islands east of the [[Wallace Line]], including [[Sulawesi]], [[Halmahera]], [[Lombok]], [[Flores]], [[Sumba]], [[Sumbawa]], and [[Timor]], is separated by deep water from both the southeast Asian continental shelf and the Australia-New Guinea continental shelf. These islands are called Wallacea, and contain relatively few Australian or Asian mammals. While most land mammals found it difficult to cross the [[Wallace Line]], many [[plant]], [[bird]], and [[reptile]] species were better able to make the crossing.

[[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], and [[New Caledonia]] are all portions of the ancient supercontinent of [[Gondwana]], which started to break into smaller continents in the [[Cretaceous|Cretaceous era]], 130-65 million years ago. [[New Zealand]] broke away first, more than 80 million years ago, and Australia finally broke free from Antarctica about 45 million years ago. All the Australasian lands are home to the Antarctic flora, descended from the flora of southern [[Gondwana]], including the coniferous [[Podocarpaceae|podocarps]] and ''[[Araucaria]]'' pines, and the broadleafed southern beech (''[[Nothofagus]]''), and proteas (''[[Proteaceae]]'').

As Australia moved north into the desert latitudes, the continent became hotter and drier, and the soils poorer and leached of nutrients, causing the old Antarctic flora to retreat to the humid corners of the continent in favor of new drought and fire tolerant flora, dominated by the ''[[Eucalyptus]], [[Casuarina]],'' and [[Acacia trees|''Acacia'' trees]], and by grasses and scrub where the rainfall was too scarce to support trees. Presently Australia is the smallest continent, and also the driest continent and the flattest (lowest in elevation) continent.

[[File:Basin range province.jpg|300px|thumb|right|upright=1.6|Basin and range topography has alternating parallel mountain ranges and valleys]]
'''Basin and range topography''' is an alternating landscape of parallel mountain ranges and valleys. It is a result of [[crustal extension]]/stretching ([[extensional tectonics]]) of the [[lithosphere]] (crust and upper mantle) due to mantle upwelling, gravitational collapse, crustal thickening, or relaxation of confining stresses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.geol.ucsb.edu/faculty/gans/abstracts/gans1993.html|title=Extension of the Basin and Range Province: Late orogenic collapse or something else?|last=Gans, P.

As the plates pull apart, they thin allowing the hot mantle to rise close to the surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://academic.emporia.edu/aberjame/student/scott2/basin_range.html|title=The Basin and Range Province of the United States|last=Scott|first=Nicolle|date=April 17, 2012|website=Emporia State University|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When the crust is extended it fractures along a [[fault plane]], creating a series of long parallel [[normal fault]]s. Between these normal faults are blocks, which subside, get uplifted or tilted. This is known as block faulting. Basins are formed due to [[subsidence]] of a block, while the blocks adjacent to the subsidence gets [[Tectonic uplift|uplift]]ed creating ranges. Normal faults are on both sides the blocks; creating alternating elevated or subsided blocks, otherwise known as [[Horst (geology)|horst]] and [[graben]]. Basins and ranges can also be formed by blocks that are tilted causing one side to subside while the other side gets uplifted. These only have one side with a normal fault, this is known as [[tilted block faulting]]. Extension causes the plate to stretch, fracture and thin. Mountains rise and valleys drop, over a long period of time creating what we see as basin and range topography.

[[Clarence Dutton]], an early pioneering geologist, described the basin and range topography of parallel mountains and valleys as "army of caterpillars marching toward Mexico."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Nevada|last=Reynolds, D., &amp; Christensen, J.|first=|publisher=Portland, Or: Graphic Arts Center Pub.|year=2001|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types of faulting ==

=== Symmetrical faulting: horst and graben ===
With [[Extensional tectonics|crustal extension]], a series of [[normal fault]]s which occur in groups, form in close proximity and dipping in opposite directions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.geosci.usyd.edu.au/users/prey/ACSGT/EReports/eR.2003/GroupD/Report2/web%20pages/Types_of_Structures.html|title=Structures of Sedimentary Basins|last=Hutson, P., Middleton, J., Miller, D., &amp; Wallenstein, A.|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As the crust extends it fractures in series of [[Fault (geology)|fault planes]], some blocks sink down due to gravity, creating long linear valleys or basins also known as [[graben]]s. While the blocks remaining up or uplifted produce mountains or ranges, also known as [[Horst (geology)|horsts]]. Fault scarps are exposed on the horst block and expose the [[footwall]] of the normal fault. This is a type of block faulting known as [[Horst and graben|grabens and horsts]]. This basin and range topography is symmetrical having equal slopes on both sides of the valleys and mountain ranges.

=== Asymmetric faulting: tilted block faulting ===
[[Tilted block faulting]], also known as [[half-graben]] or rotational block faulting, can also occur during extension. Large gently dipping normal faults, also known as [[detachment fault]]s, acts as platform in which normal faulted blocks, tilt or slide along. However, instead of the whole block subsiding only one side if the block will slip along the detachment fault, tilting toward the fault plane. Again creating mountains (ranges) and valleys (basins). Many tilted slightly in one direction at their tops due to the motion of their bottoms along the main detachment fault. This basin and range topography has one steep side and the other is more gradual.

== Mapping extension ==
One of the most studied basin and range topographies is the [[Basin and Range Province]] in the western United States, located between the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] and the [[Rocky Mountains]]. The extension of the province was believed to have begun in the late [[Cenozoic]] Era,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thompson, G. A., and Burke, D. B.|first=|date=1974|title=Regional geophysics of the Basin and Range Province|url=|journal=Annual Review of Earth and Planetary Sciences|volume=2 |pages=213–238 |doi=10.1146/annurev.ea.02.050174.00124}}&lt;/ref&gt; roughly 20 Ma. During the 90s scientists used a network of [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS) to determine the velocity magnitude and vector orientations of the Basin and Range province.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thatcher, W., Foulger, G., Julian, B., Svarc, J., Quilty, E., &amp; Bawden, G.|first=|date=1999|title=Present-Day Deformation Across the Basin and Range Province, Western United States|url=|journal=Science|volume=283 |issue=5408|pages=1714–1718|doi=10.1126/science.283.5408.1714|bibcode=1999Sci...283.1714T}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the study by Thatcher et al. they discovered that most deformation was happening in the west, adjacent to the Sierra Nevada block and while less deformation was happening in the east. Because the extension of the basin and range hits the Sierra Nevada [[batholith]], it essentially is hitting a solid wall, therefore the strain is transferred to smaller faults along the eastern side of the Sierra Nevada.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Unruh, J., Humphrey, J., &amp; Barron, A.|first=|date=2003|title=Transtensional model for the Sierra Nevada frontal fault system, eastern California|url=|journal=Geology|volume=31 |issue=4|pages=327|doi=10.1130/0091-7613(2003)031&lt;0327:tmftsn&gt;2.0.co;2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  That might account for the slight northwestern extension in the northern part of the Basin and Range province.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3620">The '''Biebrza Marshes''' (Biebrza Valley) are a wetland complex, located on the [[Biebrza|Biebrza river]] valley, in [[Suwałki County|Suwałki]], [[Łomża County|Łomża]] in the northeast of [[Poland]]. The area encompasses [[river]] channels, [[lake]]s, extensive [[marshes]] with wooded areas on higher ground and well-preserved [[peat bogs]] that occupy around 1,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The area shows a clear succession of habitats from riverside [[fen]] through to [[raised bog]]s, grading into [[wet woodland]]. Because of this unique succession, the area supports a wide diversity of wildlife with large numbers of [[birds]] and [[mammals]]. Over 250 species of birds have been recorded including more than 80% of the [[List of birds of Poland|Polish avifauna]]. Starting in the early spring mating birds attract birdwatchers from around the world.

The marshes in the area are commonly flooded and the resulting [[alluvial soil]] supports an array of wetland vegetation.

It is one of the largest wildlife refuges in Europe. The greater part of this area is the [[Biebrza National Park]], covered by the [[Ramsar Convention]] to protect the wetlands and bird breeding grounds.

==Flora and vegetation==
In the area of the Biebrza Marshes 43 plant associations were distinguished, some rarely seen in other parts of Poland. Major communities are water, marsh, peat, reeds and forest communities including ([[alder]], [[birch]], [[riparian forests]]). Particularly valuable is a large group of sedge-moss communities, containing many rare and relict species, disappearing in other parts of the country.

The vegetation is characterized by great diversity, a high degree of naturalness and the presence of many rare species, such as:
*[[Betulaceae|shrub birch]] and [[Salix lapponum|downy willow]]
*Forkbeards: ''[[Lycopodium annotinum]]'', [[clubmoss]], [[fir]]
*[[Caryophyllaceae|pink sand]], ''[[Chimaphila umbellata]]'', ''[[Polemonium caeruleum]]''
*sundew: ''[[Drosera rotundifolia]]'', ''[[Drosera anglica]]''
*''[[Pedicularis sceptrum-carolinum]]'', [[Gentiana pneumonanthe|marsh gentian]], ''[[Swertia perennis]]''
*[[Siberian iris]].
*orchids (20 species), among others: [[Lady's slipper orchid]], ''[[Dactylorhiza incarnata]]''.

==Fauna==
Biebrza Marshes are the most important breeding area for many wetland bird species in Poland and amongst the most important in [[Central Europe|Central]] and [[Western Europe]]. This importance is increasing as wetlands are disappearing from the landscape of Europe. Biebrza Valley is of great importance for many species of birds feeding and resting during the annual migrations. There are also boreal breeding species, and species whose geographical center is located in the taiga and tundra zone. 

Among the mammals in the Biebrza Marshes are:
*[[moose]], which only survived here for [[World War II]] and was protected by multiply and spread on Polish territory
*[[red deer]], [[roe deer]], [[wild boar]], [[European hare|brown hare]], [[European beaver]]
*[[wolf]], [[fox]], [[raccoon]], [[badger]], [[wikt:polecat|polecat]], [[pine marten]], [[otter]], [[stoat]], [[weasel]]

In the waters of Biebrza, there are approximately 36 species of fish such as [[Esox|pike]], [[Wels catfish]], [[eel]], and also typical of the foothills of [[European chub|chub]] and [[Barbel (fish)|barbel]].

[[File:BOD test bottles (biological oxygen demand) (3231600029).jpg|thumb|BOD test bottles at the laboratory of a [[wastewater treatment]] plant.]]
'''Biochemical Oxygen Demand''' ('''BOD''', also called '''Biological Oxygen Demand''') is the amount of [[Oxygenation (environmental)|dissolved oxygen]] needed (i.e. demanded) by aerobic biological organisms to break down organic material present in a given water sample at certain temperature over a specific time period.  The BOD value is most commonly expressed in milligrams of oxygen consumed per litre of sample during 5 days of incubation at 20&amp;nbsp;°C and is often used as a surrogate of the degree of [[Organic compound|organic]] [[pollution of water]].&lt;ref name="Sawyer"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Clair N. Sawyer |author2=Perry L. McCarty |author3=Gene F. Parkin | title=Chemistry for Environmental Engineering and Science | edition=5th | location=New York | year=2003 | publisher=McGraw-Hill | isbn=0-07-248066-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

BOD can be used as a gauge of the effectiveness of [[Sewage treatment|wastewater treatment]] plants. It is listed as a [[conventional pollutant]] in the U.S. [[Clean Water Act]].&lt;ref&gt;United States. Clean Water Act, sec. 304(a)(4), {{USCSub|33|1314|a}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

BOD is similar in function to [[chemical oxygen demand]] (COD), in that both measure the amount of [[organic compound]]s in water. However, COD is less specific, since it measures everything that can be chemically oxidized, rather than just levels of biodegradable organic matter.

==Background==
Most natural waters contain small quantities of [[organic compound]]s.  Aquatic [[microorganisms]] have evolved to use some of these compounds as [[food]].  Microorganisms living in oxygenated waters use dissolved oxygen to oxidatively degrade the organic compounds, releasing [[energy]] which is used for [[Bacterial growth|growth]] and [[reproduction]].  Populations of these microorganisms tend to increase in proportion to the amount of food available.  This microbial [[metabolism]] creates an oxygen demand proportional to the amount of organic compounds useful as food.  Under some circumstances, microbial metabolism can consume dissolved oxygen faster than atmospheric oxygen can dissolve into the water or the autotrophic community (algae, cyanobacteria and macrophytes) can produce.  Fish and aquatic insects may die when oxygen is depleted by microbial metabolism.&lt;ref&gt;Goldman, Charles R. &amp; Horne, Alexander J. ''Limnology'' (1983) McGraw-Hill {{ISBN|0-07-023651-8}} pp.88&amp;267&lt;/ref&gt;

Biochemical oxygen demand is the amount of oxygen required for microbial metabolism of organic compounds in water.  This demand occurs over some variable period of time depending on temperature, [[nutrient]] concentrations, and the [[enzyme]]s available to indigenous microbial populations.  The amount of oxygen required to completely oxidize the organic compounds to carbon dioxide and water through generations of microbial growth, death, decay, and cannibalism is total biochemical oxygen demand (total BOD).  Total BOD is of more significance to [[food web]]s than to [[water quality]].  Dissolved oxygen depletion is most likely to become evident during the initial aquatic microbial population explosion in response to a large amount of organic material.  If the microbial population deoxygenates the water, however, that lack of oxygen imposes a limit on population growth of [[aerobic respiration|aerobic]] aquatic microbial organisms resulting in a longer term food surplus and oxygen deficit.&lt;ref name="reid"&gt;Reid, George K. ''Ecology of Inland Waters and Estuaries'' (1961) Van Nostrand Reinhold pp.&amp;nbsp;317–320&lt;/ref&gt;

A standard temperature at which BOD testing should be carried out was first proposed by the [[Royal Commission on Sewage Disposal]] in its eighth report in 1912:
&lt;blockquote&gt;" (c) An effluent in order to comply with the general standard must not contain as discharged more than 3 parts per 100,000 of suspended matter, and with its suspended matters included must not take up at 65°F   more than 2.0 parts per 100,000 of dissolved oxygen in 5 days. This general standard  should be prescribed either by Statute or by order of the Central Authority, and should be subject to modifications by that Authority after an interval of not less than ten years.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This was later standardised at 68&amp;nbsp;°F and then 20&amp;nbsp;°C.  This temperature may be significantly different from the temperature of the natural environment of the water being tested.

Although the Royal Commission on Sewage Disposal proposed 5 days as an adequate test period for rivers of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]], longer periods were investigated for [[North America]]n rivers.  Incubation periods of 1, 2, 5, 10 and 20 days were being used into the mid-20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Norton, John F. ''Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Sewage'' 9th Ed. (1946) American Public Health Association p.139&lt;/ref&gt;  Keeping dissolved oxygen available at their chosen temperature, investigators found up to 99 percent of total BOD was exerted within 20 days, 90 percent within 10 days, and approximately 68 percent within 5 days.&lt;ref&gt;Urquhart, Leonard Church ''Civil Engineering Handbook'' 4th Ed. (1959) McGraw-Hill p.&amp;nbsp;9–40&lt;/ref&gt;  Variable microbial population shifts to [[nitrifying bacteria]] limit test [[reproducibility]] for periods greater than 5 days.  The 5-day test protocol with acceptably reproducible results emphasizing carbonaceous BOD has been endorsed by the United States Environmental Protection Agency.  This 5-day BOD test result may be described as the amount of oxygen required for aquatic microorganisms to stabilize decomposable organic matter under aerobic conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Sawyer, Clair N. &amp; McCarty, Perry L. ''Chemistry for Sanitary Engineers'' 2nd Ed. (1967) McGraw-Hill pp.&amp;nbsp;394–399&lt;/ref&gt;  Stabilization, in this context, may be perceived in general terms as the conversion of food to living aquatic [[fauna]].  Although these fauna will continue to exert biochemical oxygen demand as they die, that tends to occur within a more stable evolved [[ecosystem]] including higher [[trophic level]]s.&lt;ref name="reid"/&gt;

=== Typical values ===
Most pristine rivers will have a 5-day carbonaceous BOD below 1&amp;nbsp;mg/L. Moderately [[pollution|polluted]] rivers may have a BOD value in the range of 2 to 8&amp;nbsp;mg/L. Rivers may be considered severely polluted when BOD values exceed 8&amp;nbsp;mg/L.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Connor |first=Richard |authorlink = |title =The United Nations World Water Development Report 2016: Water and Jobs, chapter 2: The Global Perspective on Water |publisher =UNESCO |volume = |edition = |date =2016 |location =Paris |page =26 |isbn =978-92-3-100155-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Municipal [[sewage]] that is efficiently treated by a [[sewage treatment|three-stage process]] would have a value of about 20&amp;nbsp;mg/L or less. Untreated sewage varies, but averages around 600&amp;nbsp;mg/L in [[Europe]] and as low as 200&amp;nbsp;mg/L in the U.S., or where there is severe [[groundwater]] or [[surface water]] [[Infiltration/Inflow]]. The generally lower values in the U.S. derive from the much greater water use per capita than in other parts of the world.&lt;ref name="Sawyer" /&gt;

== Methods ==
There are two commonly recognized methods for the measurement of BOD.

=== Dilution method ===
This standard method is recognized by U.S. [[EPA]], which is labeled Method 5210B in the Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater&lt;ref&gt;Lenore S. Clesceri, Andrew D. Eaton, Eugene W. Rice (2005). Standard Methods for Examination of Water &amp; Wastewater Method 5210B. Washington, DC: American Public Health Association, American Water Works Association, and the Water Environment Association. http://www.standardmethods.org .&lt;/ref&gt;  
In order to obtain BOD&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations in a sample must be measured before and after the incubation period, and appropriately adjusted by the sample corresponding dilution factor. This analysis is performed using 300 ml incubation bottles in which [[buffered dilution water]] is dosed with seed microorganisms and stored for 5 days in the dark room at 20&amp;nbsp;°C to prevent DO production via photosynthesis. In addition to the various dilutions of BOD samples, this procedure requires dilution water blanks, [[glucose glutamic acid]] (GGA) controls, and seed controls. The dilution water blank is used to confirm the quality of the dilution water that is used to dilute the other samples. This is necessary because impurities in the dilution water may cause significant alterations in the results. The GGA control is a standardized solution to determine the quality of the seed, where its recommended BOD&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; concentration is 198&amp;nbsp;mg/l ± 30.5&amp;nbsp;mg/l.
For measurement of '''carbonaceous BOD''' (cBOD), a nitrification inhibitor is added after the dilution water has been added to the sample. The inhibitor hinders the [[oxidation]] of ammonia nitrogen, which supplies the nitrogenous BOD (nBOD). When performing the BOD&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; test, it is conventional practice to measure only cBOD because nitrogenous demand does not reflect the oxygen demand from organic matter.  This is because nBOD is generated by the breakdown of proteins, whereas cBOD is produced by the breakdown of organic molecules.

BOD&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; is calculated by:
*Unseeded:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{BOD}_5 = \frac{(D_0 - D_5)}{P}&lt;/math&gt;
*Seeded:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{BOD}_5 = \frac{(D_0 - D_5) - (B_0 - B_5)f}{P}&lt;/math&gt;

where:
:&lt;math&gt; D_0&lt;/math&gt; is the dissolved oxygen (DO) of the diluted solution after preparation (mg/l)
:&lt;math&gt; D_5&lt;/math&gt; is the DO of the diluted solution after 5 day incubation (mg/l)
:&lt;math&gt; P&lt;/math&gt; is the decimal dilution factor
:&lt;math&gt; B_0&lt;/math&gt; is the DO of diluted seed sample after preparation (mg/l)
:&lt;math&gt; B_5&lt;/math&gt; is the DO of diluted seed sample after 5 day incubation (mg/l)
:&lt;math&gt; f&lt;/math&gt; is the ratio of seed volume in dilution solution to seed volume in BOD test on seed

=== Manometric method ===
This method is limited to the measurement of the oxygen consumption due only to carbonaceous oxidation. [[Ammonia]] oxidation is inhibited.

The sample is kept in a sealed container fitted with a [[pressure sensor]]. A substance that absorbs [[carbon dioxide]] (typically [[lithium hydroxide]]) is added in the container above the sample level. The sample is stored in conditions identical to the dilution method. Oxygen is consumed and, as ammonia oxidation is inhibited, carbon dioxide is released. The total amount of gas, and thus the pressure, decreases because carbon dioxide is absorbed. From the drop of pressure, the sensor electronics computes and displays the consumed quantity of oxygen.

The main advantages of this method compared to the dilution method are:
* simplicity: no dilution of sample required, no seeding, no blank sample.
* direct reading of BOD value.
* continuous display of BOD value at the current incubation time.

== Alternative methods ==

=== Biosensor ===
An alternative to measure BOD is the development of biosensors, which are devices for the detection of an analyte that combines a biological component with a physicochemical detector component. Enzymes are the most widely used biological sensing elements in the fabrication of biosensors. Their application in biosensor construction is limited by the tedious, time consuming and costly enzyme purification methods. Microorganisms provide an ideal alternative to these bottlenecks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lei|first1=Yu|title=Microbial biosensors|url=http://www.cbs.umn.edu/sites/default/files/public/downloads/microbial%20sensor%2006.pdf|website=www.cbs.umn.edu|publisher=Analytica Chimica Acta 568 (2006) 200–210}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many micro organisms useful for BOD assessment are relatively easy to maintain in pure cultures, grow and harvest at low cost. Moreover, the use of microbes in biosensor field has opened up new possibilities and advantages such as ease of handling, preparation and low cost of device. A number of pure cultures, e.g. ''Trichosporon cutaneum, Bacillus cereus, Klebsiella oxytoca, Pseudomonas sp.'' etc. individually, have been used by many workers for the construction of BOD biosensor. On the other hand, many workers have immobilized activated sludge, or a mixture of two or three bacterial species and on various membranes for the construction of BOD biosensor. The most commonly used membranes were polyvinyl alcohol, porous hydrophilic membranes etc.&lt;ref name="igib.res.in"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kumar|first1=Rita|title=IMMOBILIZED MICROBIAL CONSORTIUM USEFUL FOR RAPID AND RELIABLE BOD ESTIMATION|url=http://www.igib.res.in/pme/patents.htm|website=www.igib.res.in|publisher=CSIR-Institute of Genomics &amp; Integrative Biology (IGIB)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A defined microbial consortium can be formed by conducting a systematic study, i.e. pre-testing of selected micro-organisms for use as a seeding material in BOD analysis of a wide variety of industrial effluents. Such a formulated consortium can be immobilized on suitable membrane, i.e. charged nylon membrane useful for BOD estimation. Suitability of charges nylon membrane lies in the specific binding between negatively charged bacterial cell and positively charged nylon membrane. So the advantages of the nylon membrane over the other membranes are : The dual binding, i.e. Adsorption as well as entrapment, thus resulting in a more stable immobilized membrane. Such specific Microbial consortium based BOD analytical devices, may find great application in monitoring of the degree of pollutional strength, in a wide variety of Industrial waste water within a very short time.&lt;ref name="igib.res.in" /&gt;

Biosensors can be used to indirectly measure BOD via a fast (usually &lt;30 min) to be determined BOD substitute and a corresponding calibration curve method (pioneered by Karube et al., 1977). Consequently, biosensors are now commercially available, but they do have several limitations such as their high maintenance costs, limited run lengths due to the need for reactivation, and the inability to respond to changing quality characteristics as would normally occur in wastewater treatment streams; e.g. diffusion processes of the biodegradable organic matter into the membrane and different responses by different microbial species which lead to problems with the reproducibility of result (Praet et al., 1995). Another important limitation is the uncertainty associated with the calibration function for translating the BOD substitute into the real BOD (Rustum ''et al.'', 2008).

===Fluorescent RedOx Indicator===
A surrogate to BOD&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; has been developed using a [[resazurin]] derivative which reveals the extent of oxygen uptake by micro-organisms for organic matter mineralization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent |country=US |number=2013130308 A |title=Process for directly measuring multiple biodegradabilities |pubdate=2013-05-23 |fdate=2012-11-21 |pridate=2011-11-23 |invent1=Nathalie Pautremat |invent2=Romy-Alice Goy |invent3=Zaynab El Amraoui |invent4=Yves Dudal |assign1= Envolure}}&lt;/ref&gt; A cross-validation performed on 109 samples in Europe and the United-States showed a strict statistical equivalence between results from both methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Muller|first1=Mathieu|last2=Bouguelia|first2=Sihem|last3=Goy|first3=Romy-Alice|last4=Yoris|first4=Alison|last5=Berlin|first5=Jeanne|last6=Meche|first6=Perrine|last7=Rocher|first7=Vincent|last8=Mertens|first8=Sharon|last9=Dudal|first9=Yves|title=International cross-validation of a BOD5 surrogate|journal=Environmental Science and Pollution Research|date=2014|pages=1–4|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11356-014-3202-3|doi=10.1007/s11356-014-3202-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The French start-up [http://envolure.com/index-en.html Envolure] (Montpellier, France) offers the kit [http://envolure.com/enverdi-en.html ENVERDI] which enables the users to perform up to 40 BOD&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; simultaneously in 48 hours in a single 96-wells microplate.

===Software sensor===
Rustum et al. (2008) proposed the use of the KSOM to develop intelligent models for making rapid inferences about BOD using other easy to measure water quality parameters, which, unlike BOD, can be obtained directly and reliably using on-line hardware sensors. This will make the use of BOD for on-line process monitoring and control a more plausible proposition. In comparison to other data-driven modeling paradigms such as multi-layer perceptrons artificial neural networks (MLP ANN) and classical multi-variate regression analysis, the KSOM is not negatively affected by missing data. Moreover, time sequencing of data is not a problem when compared to classical time series analysis.

== Dissolved oxygen probes: Membrane and luminescence ==

Since the publication of a simple, accurate and direct dissolved oxygen analytical procedure by Winkler,&lt;ref&gt;Winkler, L. W. (1888). "Die zur Bestimmung des in Wasser gelösten Sauerstoffes " Berichte der Deutschen Chemischen Gesellschaft 21(2): 2843–2854.&lt;/ref&gt; the analysis of dissolved oxygen levels for water has been key to the determination of surface water purity and ecological wellness. The Winkler method is still one of only two analytical techniques used to calibrate oxygen electrode meters; the other procedure is based on oxygen solubility at saturation as per [[Henry's law]]. Though many researchers have refined the Winkler analysis to dissolved oxygen levels in the low PPB range, the method does not lend itself to automation.

The development of an analytical instrument that utilizes the reduction-oxidation (redox) chemistry of oxygen in the presence of dissimilar metal electrodes was introduced during the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Kemula, W. and S. Siekierski (1950). "Polarometric determination of oxygen." Collect. Czech. Chem. Commun. 15: 1069–75.&lt;/ref&gt; This redox electrode (also known as dissolved oxygen sensor&lt;ref name=WWT&gt;{{cite news|title=Technically Speaking: dissolved oxygen control|url=http://wwtonline.co.uk/features/technically-speaking-dissolved-oxygen-control|accessdate=28 September 2017|work=Water and Wastewater Treatment|date=10 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;) utilized an oxygen-permeable membrane to allow the diffusion of the gas into an electrochemical cell and its concentration determined by polarographic or galvanic electrodes. This analytical method is sensitive and accurate to down to levels of ± 0.1&amp;nbsp;mg/l dissolved oxygen. Calibration of the redox electrode of this membrane electrode still requires the use of the Henry's law table or the [[Winkler test for dissolved oxygen]].

[[File:Dissolved oxygen sensor in a sewer treatment plant.webm|thumb|Dissolved oxygen sensor in a [[sewage treatment plant]] used as a feedback loop to control the [[Centrifugal fan|blowers]] in an [[aeration]] system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wallace|first1=Calvin|title=Repair or Rethink?|url=http://www.tpomag.com/editorial/2012/04/repair_or_rethink|accessdate=28 September 2017|work=Treatment Plant Operator|issue=April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
During the last two decades, a new form of electrode was developed based on the luminescence emission of a photo active chemical compound and the quenching of that emission by oxygen. It is also called optical dissolved oxygen sensor.&lt;ref name=WWT/&gt; This quenching photophysics mechanism is described by the Stern–Volmer equation for dissolved oxygen in a solution:&lt;ref&gt;Garcia-Fresnadillo, D., M. D. Marazuela, et al. (1999). "Luminescent Nafion Membranes Dyed with Ruthenium(II) Complexes as Sensing Materials for Dissolved Oxygen." Langmuir 15(19): 6451–6459.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math chem&gt;I_0/I~=~1~+~K_{SV}~[\ce{O2}]&lt;/math&gt;

* &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;: Luminescence in the presence of oxygen
* &lt;math&gt;I_0&lt;/math&gt;: Luminescence in the absence of oxygen
* &lt;math&gt;K_{SV}&lt;/math&gt;: Stern-Volmer constant for oxygen quenching
* &lt;chem&gt;[O2]&lt;/chem&gt;: Dissolved oxygen concentration

The determination of oxygen concentration by luminescence quenching has a linear response over a broad range of oxygen concentrations and has excellent accuracy and reproducibility.&lt;ref&gt;Titze, J., H. Walter, et al. (2008). "Evaluation of a new optical sensor for measuring dissolved oxygen by comparison with standard analytical methods." Monatsschr. Brauwiss.(Mar./Apr.): 66-80.&lt;/ref&gt; 
There are several recognized EPA methods for the measurement of dissolved oxygen for BOD, including the following methods:

== Test limitations ==
The test method involves variables limiting reproducibility. Tests normally show observations varying plus or minus ten to twenty percent around the mean.&lt;ref name="Hammer"&gt;{{cite book | author=Hammer, Mark J. | title=Water and Waste-Water Technology | year=1975 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons | isbn=0-471-34726-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|82}}

=== Toxicity ===
Some wastes contain chemicals capable of suppressing microbiological growth or activity.  Potential sources include industrial wastes, [[antibiotic]]s in pharmaceutical or [[medical waste]]s, sanitizers in food processing or commercial cleaning facilities, [[Water chlorination|chlorination]] disinfection used following conventional sewage treatment, and odor-control formulations used in sanitary waste holding tanks in passenger vehicles or portable toilets.  Suppression of the microbial community oxidizing the waste will lower the test result.&lt;ref name="Hammer" /&gt;{{rp|85}}

=== Appropriate microbial population ===
The test relies upon a microbial ecosystem with enzymes capable of oxidizing the available organic material.  Some waste waters, such as those from biological secondary [[sewage treatment]], will already contain a large population of microorganisms acclimated to the water being tested.  An appreciable portion of the waste may be utilized during the holding period prior to commencement of the test procedure.  On the other hand, organic wastes from industrial sources may require specialized enzymes.  Microbial populations from standard seed sources may take some time to produce those enzymes.  A specialized seed culture may be appropriate to reflect conditions of an evolved ecosystem in the receiving waters.&lt;ref name="Hammer" /&gt;{{rp|85–87}}

== History  ==
The ''[[Royal Commission]] on River Pollution'', which was established in 1865 and the formation of the ''[[Royal Commission on Sewage Disposal]]'' in 1898 led to the selection in 1908 of BOD&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; as the definitive test for organic [[Water pollution|pollution]] of rivers. Five days was chosen as an appropriate test period because this is supposedly the longest time that river water takes to travel from source to [[estuary]] in the [[U.K.]]. In its sixth report the Royal Commission recommended that  the standard set should be 15 parts by weight per million of water.&lt;ref name="Royal"&gt;[https://archive.org/details/cu31924003641929 Final Report of the Commissioners Appointed to Inquire and Report What Methods of Treating and Disposing of Sewage. 1912 ]&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the Ninth report the commission had revised the recommended standard : &lt;blockquote&gt;" An effluent taking up 2–0 parts dissolved oxygen per 100,000 would be found by a
simple calculation to require dilution with at least 8 volumes of river water taking up 0.2 part if the resulting mixture was not to take up more than 0.4 part. Our experience indicated that in a large majority of cases the volume of river water would exceed 8 times the volume of effluent, and that the figure of 2–0 parts dissolved oxygen per 100,000, which had been shown to be practicable, would be a safe figure to adopt for the purposes of a general standard, taken in conjunction with the condition that the effluent should not contain more than 3–0 parts per 100,000 of suspended solids."&lt;ref name="Royal" /&gt;   &lt;/blockquote&gt;This was the cornerstone 20:30 (BOD:Suspended Solids) + full [[nitrification]] standard which was used as a yardstick in the U.K. up to the 1970s for sewage works [[effluent]] quality.

The [[United States]] includes BOD effluent limitations in its [[sewage treatment|secondary treatment]]  regulations. Secondary sewage treatment is generally expected to remove 85 percent of the BOD measured in sewage and produce effluent BOD concentrations with a 30-day average of less than 30&amp;nbsp;mg/L and a 7-day average of less than 45&amp;nbsp;mg/L.  The regulations also describe "treatment equivalent to secondary treatment" as removing 65 percent of the BOD and producing effluent BOD concentrations with a 30-day average less than 45&amp;nbsp;mg/L and a 7-day average less than 65&amp;nbsp;mg/L.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Washington, DC. [http://www.access.gpo.gov/nara/cfr/waisidx_07/40cfr133_07.html "Secondary Treatment Regulation."] ''Code of Federal Regulations,'' 40 CFR Part 133.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Marmilla las plassas.jpg|thumb|250px|Campidano plain near Las Plassas and the namesake hill and medieval castle in the background.]]

'''Campidano''' ({{lang-sc|Campidànu}}) is a plain located in the south-western area of [[Sardinia]], [[Italy]], covering approximately 100 kilometres between [[Cagliari]] and [[Oristano]].

==Geography==
[[File:Parco eolico del Medio Campidano (03).jpg|thumb|Landscape in the ex Medio Campidano Province]]

Geologically, it is a [[graben]], a tectonic structure formed in the mid-[[Pliocene]]/early [[Pleistocene]] (4 to 2 millions years ago). Later it was subject to large [[Sedimentary depositional environment|sedimentary deposition]] phenomena, creating an overall thickness of 600&amp;nbsp;m of sediments.

The plain is crossed by the [[Tirso River]], the longest in Sardinia.

==History==
Agriculture has been successful in Campidano since the [[Neolithic]], continuing on through the [[Punic]] and the [[ancient Rome|Romans]], who cultivated here grains and grape. Dams of the large Sardinian rivers nourish the [[artichoke]] and [[wheat]] cultures, also typical products of this zone. [[Paddy field]]s are present near Oristano.

[[File:Champel.JPG|thumb|Champel, aerial view]]
'''Champel''' is a [[neighborhood]] in the city of [[Geneva, Switzerland]].

Champel is widely considered a posh, high-class neighbourhood due to its numerous parks and natural spaces, very luxurious apartments and proximity to the city center.  Residences mostly consist of mid-range to high-scale apartments.  Champel is home to Cité Universitaire ({{lang-fr| for university campus}}), a [[hostel]]-like complex for students of the [[University of Geneva]].

==Geography==
Champel is in close proximity to Florissant, which like Champel is an exclusive neighborhood, bordered by the neighborhood of [[Eaux-Vives]] to the north, the [[Municipalities of Switzerland|municipality]] of [[Veyrier]] to the east, the [[municipality]] of [[Carouge]] to the south and the city center to the west, occupying an area of approximately 1.9&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

===Sights===
Le plateau de Champel (''the plateau of Champel'') is the center of the neighborhood. Le parc Bertrand is a popular {{convert|27.4|acre|ha|order=flip|adj=on}} park, featuring a former primary school (which is now a day-care center), a fenced dog park, a playground for small children as well as a wading pool. The [[neo-gothic]] Tour-de-Champel (''tower of Champel'') on the edge of the cliffs overlooking the [[Arve]] is a scenic view.

==Notable people==
* [[Michael Servetus]] (1509 or 1511 – 1553), Spanish theologian, physician, cartographer, and Renaissance humanist, was executed at the Plateau of Champel
* [[Lydia Welti-Escher]] (1858–1891), patron of the arts and founder of the [[Gottfried Keller Stiftung]], committed suicide in her house in Champel

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="40281">The '''commodification of nature''' is an area of research within critical environmental studies that is concerned with the ways in which natural entities and processes are made exchangeable through the [[Market economy|market]], and the implications thereof.

Drawing upon the work of [[Karl Marx]], [[Karl Polanyi]], [[James O'Connor (academic)|James O’Connor]]  and [[David Harvey (geographer)|David Harvey]], this area of work is [[normative]] and critical,&lt;ref&gt;Prudham, William Scott (2009) ‘Commodification’, in Castree, Noel, et al. (eds) ''A Companion to Environmental Geography'', Oxford: Wiley-Blackwell, pp. 123-142. (p. 125)&lt;/ref&gt; based in [[Marxist geography]] and [[political ecology]]. Theorists use a [[commodification]] [[Framing (social sciences)|framing]] in order to contest the perspectives of "[[Free-market environmentalism|market environmentalism]]," which sees marketization as a solution to [[environmental degradation]]. The [[Natural environment|environment]]  has been a key site of conflict between proponents of the expansion of market norms, relations and modes of [[governance]] and those who oppose such expansion.  Critics emphasize the contradictions and undesirable physical and ethical consequences brought about by the commodification of [[Resource#Natural resources|natural resources]] (as inputs to production and products) and processes ([[Ecosystem services|environmental services]]  or conditions).

Most researchers who employ a commodification of nature framing invoke a [[Marxian economics|Marxian]] conceptualization of commodities as "objects [[Production (economics)|produced]]  for sale on the market"&lt;ref&gt;Polanyi, Karl (2001) ''The Great Transformation: The Political and Economic Origins of Our Time'', Boston: Beacon Press. (p. 75)&lt;/ref&gt; that embody both [[Use value|use]] and [[exchange value]]. Commodification itself is a process by which goods and services not produced for sale are converted into an exchangeable form.&lt;ref&gt;Kosoy, Nicolás and Corbera, Esteve (2010) ‘Payments for Ecosystem Services as Commodity Fetishism’, ''Ecological Economics'', 69(1): pp. 1228-1236. (p. 1229); Prudham 2009 (p. 125)&lt;/ref&gt;  It involves multiple elements, including [[privatization]], [[Alienation (property law)|alienation]], individuation, abstraction, [[Valuation (finance)|valuation]] and displacement.&lt;ref&gt;Castree, Noel (2003) ‘Commodifying What Nature?’, ''Progress in Human Geography'', 27(3): pp. 273-297.&lt;/ref&gt;

As capitalism expands in breadth and depth, more and more things previously external to the system become “internalized,” including entities and processes that are usually considered "natural." [[Nature]], as a concept, however, is very difficult to define, with many layers of meaning, including external environments as well as humans themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Braun, Bruce (2009) ‘Nature’, in Castree, Noel, et al. (eds) ''A Companion to Environmental Geography'', Oxford: Wiley-Blackwell, pp. 19-36. (p. 20); Castree, Noel (2005) ''Nature'', London: Routledge.; Smith, Neil (2008) U''neven Development: Nature, Capital, and the Production of Space, Third Edition'', Athens: University of Georgia Press. (p. 11)&lt;/ref&gt; Political ecology and other critical conceptions draw upon strands within Marxist geography that see nature as "[[Social nature|socially produced]]," with no neat boundary separating the "social" from the "natural."&lt;ref&gt;Bakker, Karen and Bridge, Gavin (2006) ‘Material Worlds? Resource Geographies and the "Matter of Nature"’, ''Progress in Human Geography'', 30(10): pp. 5-27. (p. 8); Braun 2009 (p. 24); Castree 2005 (p. 24); Castree, Noel (2010a) ‘Neoliberalism and the Biophysical Environment 1: What ‘Neoliberalism’ is, and What Difference Nature Makes to it’, ''Geography Compass'', 4(12): pp. 1725-1733. (p. 1725); Smith 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Still, the commodification of entities and processes that are considered natural is viewed as a "special case" based on nature’s biophysical [[Materialism|materiality]], which "shape[es] and condition[s] trajectories of commodification."&lt;ref&gt;Prudham 2009 (p. 128)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins and development ==

=== Classical liberalism and enclosure ===
The commodification of nature has its origins in the rise of [[capitalism]]. In [[England]] and later elsewhere, "[[enclosure]]" involved attacks upon and eventual near-elimination of [[the commons]]—a long, contested and frequently violent process Marx referred to as "[[Primitive accumulation of capital|primitive accumulation]]."&lt;ref&gt;Castree 2010a (p. 1730); McCarthy, James (2009) ‘Commons’, in Castree, N., et al. (eds) ''A Companion to Environmental Geography'', Oxford: Wiley-Blackwell, pp. 498-514. (p. 500)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Classical liberalism]], the ideological aspect of this process, was closely bound to questions of the environment. Privatization was presented as "more conducive to the careful stewardship of natural resources than the commons"&lt;ref&gt;McCarthy 2009 (p. 501)&lt;/ref&gt; by thinkers like [[Jeremy Bentham|Bentham]], [[John Locke|Locke]] and [[Thomas Robert Malthus|Malthus]].  The [[Malthusianism|neo-Malthusian]] discourse of [[Garrett Hardin|Garrett Hardin’s]] "[[Tragedy of the Commons]]" (1968) parallels this perspective, reconceptualizing public goods as "scarce commodities" requiring either privatization or strong state control.&lt;ref&gt;McCarthy 2009 (p. 503)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ecology Against Capitalism'''

As Foster points out in ''Ecology Against Capitalism'', the environment is not a commodity (such as most things are treated in capitalism) but it is rather the biosphere that sustains all life that we know of. However, it is important to note that in our society, it is treated as a capitalistic value. For example, a price is put on lumber in a certain forest or the quality of water in a river or stream, or the minerals that are available under ground. These ways of putting a price on the ecosystem tend to forget to put a price on exploiting it. This can cause more damage to an ecosystem if the externalities for business are not taken into consideration. One way to fix this problem is taxes that will increase the cost of environmental damage. For example, a carbon tax would help society get off of fossil fuels and go towards renewables much faster. This is one step that many scientists and experts agree needs to happen in order to transition away from fossil fuels and delay or even prevent man made climate change. Deregulation of governmental programs such as the EPA, and other environmental organizations may be good for business, but it doesn't serve the people who must live on a more polluted earth.

=== Capitalist expansion ===
[[Marxism|Marxists]] define capitalism as a socio-economic system whose central goal is the [[Capital accumulation|accumulation]] of more wealth through the production and exchange of commodities. While the commodity form is not unique to capitalism, in it economic production is motivated increasingly by exchange.&lt;ref&gt;Prudham 2009 (p. 125, 127)&lt;/ref&gt; Competition provides constant pressure for innovation and growth in a "restless and unstable process,"  making the system expansionary and "tendentially all-encompassing."&lt;ref&gt;Castree, Noel (2010b) ‘Neoliberalism and the Biophysical Environment 2: Theorising the Neoliberalisation of Nature’, ''Geography Compass'', 4(12): pp. 1734-1746. (pp. 1736-1737, 1738)&lt;/ref&gt;

Through market [[globalization]], the tendency Marx described in the [[The Communist Manifesto|''Communist Manifesto'']] in which "[t]he need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the entire surface of the globe,"&lt;ref&gt;Marx, Karl, and Engels, Friedrich (1967) [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1848/communist-manifesto/ch01.htm ''The Communist Manifesto''], New York: Monthly Review Press.&lt;/ref&gt; capitalism converts nature into "an appendage of the production process."&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Neil (2008) ''Uneven Development: Nature, Capital, and the Production of Space, Third Edition'', Athens: University of Georgia Press. (p. 71)&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Neil Smith (geographer)|Neil Smith]] argues, "[n]o part of the earth’s surface, the atmosphere, the oceans, the geological substratum, or the biological superstratum are immune from transformation by capital."&lt;ref&gt;Smith 2008 (p. 79)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Neoliberal nature ===
Since the late 1980s, an ideology of “market environmentalism” has gained prominence within environmental policy.&lt;ref&gt;Kosoy &amp; Corbera 2010 (p. 1230); Liverman, Diana (2004) ‘Who Governs, at What Scale and at What Price? Geography, Environmental Governance, and the Commodification of Nature’, ''Annals of the Association of American Geographers'', 94(4): pp. 734-738.&lt;/ref&gt; Such a perspective is based in [[Neoclassical economics|neoclassical economic theory]], which sees [[Environmental degradation|degradation]] as a result of the absence of prices in environmental goods.&lt;ref&gt;O’Neill, John (2001) ‘Markets and the Environment: The Solution is the Problem’, ''Economic and Political Weekly'', 36(21): pp. 1865-1873. (p. 1865)&lt;/ref&gt; Market environmentalism gained widespread acceptance through the rise of neoliberalism, an approach to human affairs in which the "[[free market]]" is given priority and money-mediated relations are seen as the best way to deliver services.&lt;ref&gt;Castree, Noel 2010a (p. 1726)&lt;/ref&gt;

A neoliberal approach constructs nature as a "world currency," valued in international markets and given "the opportunity to earn its own right to survive."&lt;ref&gt;McAfee, Kathleen (1999) ‘Selling Nature to Save It? Biodiversity and Green Developmentalism’, ''Environment and Planning D: Society and Space'', 17(2): pp. 133-154. (p. 133, 134)&lt;/ref&gt; This "selling nature to save it" approach&lt;ref&gt;McAfee 1999&lt;/ref&gt; requires economic valuation — either indirectly, as with [[cost-benefit analysis]] and [[contingent valuation]],  or through direct commodification.&lt;ref&gt;Castree 2003 (p. 285); O’Neill 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

While commodification efforts are propelled in large part by [[Private sector|private firms]] seeking new areas of investment and avenues for the circulation of [[Capital (economics)|capital]], there are also explicit policy prescriptions for privatization and market exchange of resources, production [[By-product|byproducts]] and processes as the best means to rationally manage and conserve the environment.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, David (2007) ''A Brief History of Neoliberalism'', Oxford: Oxford University Press.; Prudham 2009 (p. 123)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Stretching and deepening ===
The commodification of nature occurs through two distinct "moments" as capitalization "stretches" its reach to include greater distances of space and time, and "deepens" to penetrate into more types of goods and services.&lt;ref&gt;Castree, Noel (2010b) ‘Neoliberalism and the Biophysical Environment 2: Theorising the Neoliberalisation of Nature’, ''Geography Compass'', 4(12): pp. 1734-1746. (p. 1739); Prudham 2009 (p. 125)&lt;/ref&gt; External nature becomes an "accumulation strategy" for capital, through traditional examples like [[mining]] and [[agriculture]] as well as new "[[commodity frontiers]]" in [[Commercialization of traditional medicines|bioprospecting]] and [[ecotourism]].

David Harvey sees this as "the wholesale commodification of nature in all its forms," a "new wave of ‘enclosing the commons’"&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, David (2003) ''The New Imperialism'', Oxford: Oxford University Press. (p. 148)&lt;/ref&gt; that employs environmentalism in the service of the rapid expansion of capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;Castree 2010b (p. 1744); McAfee 1999 (p. 134)&lt;/ref&gt;  This "[[accumulation by dispossession]]" releases [[asset]]s at very low or zero cost,  providing immediate profitability and counteracting [[overaccumulation]].&lt;ref&gt;Harvey 2007; McCarthy 2009 (p. 511)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Prudham 2009, p126.jpg|thumb|'''Commodification as an integrated process of "stretching" and "deepening"'''&lt;ref name="Prudham 2009 p. 126"&gt;Prudham 2009 (p. 126)&lt;/ref&gt;]]

== Aspects of commodification ==
At the most abstract level, commodification is a process through which qualitatively different things are made equivalent and exchangeable through the medium of [[money]]. By taking on a general quality of exchange value, they become [[Unit commensurability|commensurable]].&lt;ref&gt;Castree 2003 (p. 278, 279)&lt;/ref&gt; Commodification turns on this apparent dissolution of qualitative difference and its “renegotiation,” as commodities are standardized in order to maintain a constant identity across space and time.&lt;ref&gt;Kosoy &amp; Corbera 2010 (p. 1228); Prudham 2009 (pp. 129-131)&lt;/ref&gt;

Commodity status is not something intrinsic to a natural entity, but is rather an assigned quality,&lt;ref&gt;Castree 2003 (p. 277); Prudham 2009 (p. 124, 129, 137)&lt;/ref&gt; brought about through an active process. The conversion of a whole class of goods or services&lt;ref&gt;Castree 2003 (p. 278); Prudham 2005 (p.8)&lt;/ref&gt; necessitates changes in the way nature is [[concept]]ualized and [[discourse|discursively]] represented.&lt;ref&gt;Bridge, Gaven and Perreault, Thomas (2009) ‘Environmental Governance’, in Castree, Noel, et al. (eds) ''A Companion to Environmental Geography'', Oxford: Wiley-Blackwell, pp. 475-497. (p. 487); Prudham 2009 (p. 125)&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no "single path" to commodification.&lt;ref name="Prudham 2009 p. 126"/&gt; [[Noel Castree]] stresses that commodification in fact involves several interrelated aspects, or "relational moments," that should not be confused or conflated as they can be employed independently of each other.&lt;ref&gt;Castree 2003; Prudham 2009 (p. 132)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Privatization''''' is the assigning of [[Title (property)|legal title]] to an entity or process. A commodity needs to be owned, either by an individual or a group, in order to be traded.&lt;ref&gt;Castree 2003 (p. 279)&lt;/ref&gt; Privatization of natural entities can entail enclosure or the representation thereof (as with [[Intellectual property|intellectual property rights]]), and represents a shift in social relations, changing rights of access, use and disposal as things move from communally-, state- or unowned modes into private hands.&lt;ref&gt;Castree 2011 (p. 35, 36)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Alienability''''' is the capacity of a given commodity to be separated, physically and morally, from its seller. If a commodity is not alienable, it cannot be exchanged and is thus shielded from the market.&lt;ref&gt;Castree 2003 (p. 279, 280); O’Neill 2001 (p. 1867)&lt;/ref&gt; For example, human organs might be privatized (owned by their bearer) but very rarely would they be considered alienable.

'''''Individuation''''' is the representational and physical act of separating a commodity from its supporting context through legal and/or material boundaries. This could involve "splitting" an ecosystem into legally-defined and tradable property rights to specific services or resources.&lt;ref&gt;The construction of something as a resource is a matter of convention, and "involves a discursive and practical ‘cut’ into the seamless complexity of the world in order to name discrete ‘noun-chunks’ of reality that are deemed to be socially useful" (Castree 2003, p. 280)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Abstraction''''' is the assimilation of a given thing into a broader type or process, the transformation of particular things into classes.&lt;ref&gt;Castree 2003 (p. 281); Kosoy &amp; Corbera 2010 (p. 1231)&lt;/ref&gt; Through ''functional abstraction'', "wetlands" are constructed as a generic category despite the uniqueness of physical sites&lt;ref&gt;Castree 2003 (p. 281); Robertson, Morgan McEuen (2000) ‘No Net Loss’, ''Antipode'', 32(4): pp. 463-493.&lt;/ref&gt; and different gasses and activities are equated through [[Emissions trading|carbon markets]].&lt;ref&gt;Lohmann, Larry (2010) ‘"Strange Markets" and the Climate Crisis’, in Bonilla, O. and Galvez, E. ''Crisis Financier o Crisis Civilizatoria'', Quito: Instituto de Estudios Ecologistas del Tercer Mundo. (p. 5); MacKenzie, Donald (2009) ‘Making Things the Same: Gases, Emissions Rights and the Politics of Carbon Markets’, ''Accounting, Organizations and Society'', 34(1): pp. 440-455. (p. 440)&lt;/ref&gt; Through ''spatial abstraction'' things in one place are treated as the same as things located elsewhere so that both can form part of the same market.&lt;ref&gt;Castree 2003 (p. 281); MacKenzie 2009 (p. 440, 444)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Valuation''''' is the manifestation of all expressions of worth ([[Aesthetics|aesthetic]], practical, [[Ethics|ethical]], ''et cetera'') through a single exchange value. Monetization is thus foundational to capitalism, rendering things commensurable and exchangeable, allowing for the separation of production, circulation and consumption over great gulfs of time and space.&lt;ref&gt;Castree 2003 (p. 281); Prudham 2009 (p. 124)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Displacement''''' involves something appearing as "something other than itself." Commodities might be better thought of as "socio-natural relations" than [[Reification (Marxism)|reified]] as things "in and of themselves," but through spatio-temporal separation of producers and consumers, the histories and relations of commodities become obscured.&lt;ref&gt;Castree 2003 (p. 282); Prudham 2009 (p. 132)&lt;/ref&gt; This is Marx’s [[commodity fetishism]], the "making invisible" of the social relationships and embeddedness of production.&lt;ref&gt;Kosoy &amp; Corbera 2010 (p. 1228, 1229)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Problems with commodification ==
[[Commodification of nature#Further reading|Critics]] see environmental degradation as stemming from these processes of commodification, and generally include at least implicit criticism of one or more aspect. There appear to be three broad "problem areas" from which the commodification of nature is critiqued: ''practical'', in terms of whether or not nature can be properly made into a commodity; ''moral'', in terms of the ethical implications of commodification; and ''consequential'', in terms of the effects of commodification on nature itself.

=== Practical problems ===
Much of the literature relates commodification of nature to the issue of materiality—the significance of biophysical properties and context. The qualitative differences of a heterogeneous biophysical world are seen to be analytically and practically significant, sources of unpredictability and resistance to human intention that also shape and provide opportunities for capital circulation and accumulation.&lt;ref&gt;Bakker &amp; Bridge 2006; Braun 2009; Castree 2003; Castree 2005; Kloppenburg, Jr., Jack Ralph (2004) ''First the Seed: The Political Economy of Plant Biotechnology, 1492-2000, Second Edition'', Madison: University of Wisconsin Press.; Mansfield, Becky (2004) ‘Rules of Privatization: Contradictions in Neoliberal Regulation of North Pacific Fisheries’, ''Annals of the Association of American Geographers'', 94(3): pp. 565-584.; Prudham, William Scott (2005) ''Knock on Wood: Nature as Commodity in Douglas-Fir Country'', London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

The tangible non-human world thus affects the construction of social and economic relations and practice, inscribing ecology in the dynamics of capital. While some "natures" are readily subsumed by capitalism, others "resist" complete commodification, displaying a form of "[[Agency (philosophy)|agency]]."&lt;ref&gt;Castree 2003 (p. 289)&lt;/ref&gt; The ecological characteristics of [[Fishery|marine fish]], for example, affect the forms that privatization, industry structure and [[Regulation (socio-legal concept)|regulation]] can take.&lt;ref&gt;Mansfield 2004 (p. 565)&lt;/ref&gt; Water, also, does not commodify easily due to its physical properties, which leads to differentiation in its governing institutions.&lt;ref&gt;Bakker &amp; Bridge 2006 (p. 18)&lt;/ref&gt;

The demarcation and pricing of nature-based commodities is thus problematic. Divisibility and exclusion are difficult, as it is often not possible to draw clean property rights around environmental services or resources.&lt;ref&gt;Kosoy &amp; Corbera 2010 (p. 1231); Mansfield 2004 (p. 578); O’Neill 2001 (pp. 1867-1868); O’Neill, John (2007) ''Markets, Deliberation and Environment'', London: Routledge.(p. 42)&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, pricing is a problem as many species, landscapes and services are unique or otherwise irreplaceable and [[Unit commensurability|incommensurable]].&lt;ref&gt;Castree, N. (2011) ‘Neoliberalism and the Biophysical Environment 3: Putting Theory into Practice’, ''Geography Compass'', 5(1): pp. 35-49. (p. 37, 43);Liverman 2004 (p. 735)&lt;/ref&gt; Their monetary values are thus in many ways arbitrary, as they do not follow changes in quality or quantity but rather social preference, failing to convey "real" ecological value or reasons for conservation.&lt;ref&gt;Castree 2003 (p. 286); Henderson, George (2009) ‘Marxist Political Economy and the Environment’, in Castree, Noel, et al. (eds) A'' Companion to Environmental Geography'', Oxford: Wiley-Blackwell, pp. 266-293. (p. 277); Kosoy &amp; Corbera 2010 (p. 1234); O’Neill 2007 (p. 28)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Moral difficulties ===
A single monetary value also denies the multiplicity of values which could be attributed to nature — non-monetary systems of cultural and social importance.&lt;ref&gt;Kosoy &amp; Corbera 2010 (p. 1228, 1232)&lt;/ref&gt;  The environment can express relations between generations as a sort of [[cultural heritage|heritage]]. [[Livelihood]], territorial rights and "[[sacred]]ness" poorly translate into prices, and dividing a communal-social value — a forest, for instance — into private property rights can undermine the relations and identity of a community.&lt;ref&gt;Liverman 2004 (p. 735); O’Neill 2007 (p. 50)&lt;/ref&gt;

Neoliberal policies have been implicated in greatly altered patterns of access and use. Markets generally deal poorly with issues of [[procedural fairness]] and [[Distribution of wealth|equitable distribution]], and critics see commodification as producing greater levels of [[Social inequality|inequality]] in power and participation while reinforcing existing vulnerabilities.&lt;ref&gt;Castree 2011 (p. 36); Corbera, Esteve, Brown, Katrina, and Adger, W. Neil (2007) ‘The Equity and Legitimacy of Markets for Ecosystem Services’, ''Development and Change'', 38(4): pp. 587-613. (p. 587, 608); Harvey 2003 (p. 144); Kosoy &amp; Corbera 2010 (p. 1232); Liverman 2004 (p. 735)&lt;/ref&gt; Ecosystem benefits might be considered "normative [[Public economics#Public goods|public goods]]"&lt;ref&gt;O’Neill 2007 (pp. 51-52)&lt;/ref&gt; — even when commodified, there is a sense that individuals ''ought'' to not be excluded from access. When [[water privatization]] prices people out, for instance, a sense of use [[Rights#Natural rights versus legal rights|rights]] inspires [[protest]].&lt;ref&gt;Prudham 2009 (pp. 128-129)&lt;/ref&gt; While neoliberal approaches are often presented as neutral or [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]], they disguise highly political approaches to resources and the interests and power of certain actors.&lt;ref&gt;McAfee 1999 (p. 133, 135, 151)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Problematic consequences ===
Through commodification, natural entities and services become vehicles for the realization of profit,&lt;ref&gt;Castree 2005 (p. 159, 282)&lt;/ref&gt; subject to the pressures of the market where [[Economic efficiency|efficiency]] overrides other concerns.&lt;ref&gt;Lohmann 2010 (p. 4); Henderson 2009 (p. 274)&lt;/ref&gt; With climate commodities, the profit motive incentivizes buyers and sellers to ignore the [[Cap and trade#Criticism|steady erosion of the climate mitigation goal]].&lt;ref&gt;Lohmann 2010 (pp. 7-8)&lt;/ref&gt; Market exchange is "reason-blind,"&lt;ref&gt;O’Neill 2001 (p. 1866); O’Neill 2007 (p. 28)&lt;/ref&gt; but without rational assessment of different strategies and the ecological importance of particular natural entities, commodification cannot effectively deliver on conservation.&lt;ref&gt;Lohmann 2010 (p. 5); O’Neill 2001 (p. 1869)&lt;/ref&gt;

Harvey thus declares that there is something "inherently anti-ecological" about capitalist commodification.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey 1996 (p. 155)&lt;/ref&gt; It ignores and simplifies complex relations, obscuring origins and narrowing things to a single service or standard unit.&lt;ref&gt;Kosoy &amp; Corbera 2010 (p. 1228, 1231)&lt;/ref&gt; The treatment of things as the same for a particular end — either profit or a single utility — leads to a homogenization and simplification of the biophysical. As governments and private firms seek to maximize carbon content for emissions markets, they invest preferably in [[Tree farm#Tree farming and climate change|tree plantations]] over complex forest ecosystems, eliminating species diversity, density and resulting in [[domino effect]]s on processes such as water flow.&lt;ref&gt;Kosoy &amp; Corbera 2010 (p. 1231); Prudham 2005; Prudham 2009 (p. 131)&lt;/ref&gt;

The neglect of relational aspects also ignores the [[Emergence|emergent]] and embedded character of ecosystem functions. Components are frequently dependent on each other and the result of interactions between [[Biotic component|biotic]] and non-biotic factors across space and at multiple levels. Alienation and individuation may thus be counterproductive to the provision of ecosystem services, and veils human perception of what an ecosystem is and how it functions—and consequently how to best conserve and repair it.&lt;ref&gt;Kosoy &amp; Corbera 2010 (pp. 1231-1232)&lt;/ref&gt;  John Bellamy Foster argues that neglect of such relational aspects is a result of economic reductionism.&lt;ref&gt;Foster, John Bellamy (2002) "Ecology Against Capitalism", New York: Monthly Review Press. (p. 32-34)&lt;/ref&gt;  This reductionism leads to an inefficiency in promoting biodiversity since as ecosystems are simplified into more basic commodities they can no longer support as diverse a set of organisms as they could precommodification.  This creates a concern that the commodification of nature lends itself toward undermining biodiversity through its pursuit of attaching a value to nature.&lt;ref&gt;Foster, John Bellamy 2002 (p.33-34)&lt;/ref&gt;

Karl Polanyi voiced this concern when addressing the concept of treating nature as a commodity. If nature were treated as a commodity it would be concentrated down to its base parts and destroyed. Polanyi highlighted many of the concerns that contemporary environmentalists have by noting that nature's commodification would lead to its pollution, overuse, and eventually imperil human life &lt;ref&gt;Polanyi, Karl (2001) "The Great Transformation: The Political and Economic Origins of Our Time" 2nd ed. Boston: Beacon Press (p. 75-76)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Crisis and resistance ==

=== Incomplete capitalization and the fictitious commodity ===
When confronted with natural "barriers to accumulation," capitalists attempt to overcome them through technical and social innovation.&lt;ref&gt;Castree 2005 (p. 161); Mansfield, Becky (2004) ‘Rules of Privatization: Contradictions in Neoliberal Regulation of North Pacific Fisheries’, ''Annals of the Association of American Geographers'', 94(3): pp. 565-584.(p. 577)&lt;/ref&gt; This often involves the modification of nature to fit the needs of production and exchange, allowing for fuller realization of profits. Nature is "subsumed" to capitalist accumulation, losing its "independent" capacity and approaching "the archetype of a ‘pure’ commodity."&lt;ref&gt;Castree 2003 (p. 282, 286); Castree 2005 (p. 161)&lt;/ref&gt;

However, as nature becomes "[[Rationalization (economics)|rationalized]]" and internalized, increasing the control of capitalists over exchange, production and distribution,&lt;ref&gt;Prudham 2005 (p.15); Smith 2008 (p. 68)&lt;/ref&gt; a new contradiction emerges. Capitalist penetration into natural commodities can never be complete, because a certain amount of production, by definition, takes place prior to human intervention.&lt;ref&gt;Bridge &amp; Perreault 2009 (p. 488); Prudham 2005 (p.12, 16, 17)&lt;/ref&gt; Because natural entities and processes do not require capital or labor to be produced, and their social, cultural and/or ecological value ''exceeds'' the market value placed upon them, they are considered [[Commodity (Marxism)#Pseudo-commodities|pseudo-]] or [[The Great Transformation (book)|fictitious commodities]].&lt;ref&gt;Castree 2010b (p. 1738); Kosoy &amp; Corbera 2010 (p. 1230)&lt;/ref&gt; This basic fictitiousness is the origin of the material contradictions that arise when natural commodities are treated ''as if'' they were "true" commodities, as completely privatizable, alienable, separable, ''et cetera''.&lt;ref&gt;Castree 2003 (p. 285); Prudham 2009 (p. 128)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Possible consequences of commodifying nature ===
Many scholars believe that ecology and capitalism are against one another regarding climate change.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ecology Against Capitalism|last=Foster|first=John Bellamy|publisher=Monthly Review Press|year=2002|isbn=1583670564|location=New York|pages=2, 26–37|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As environmental economics is a relatively new field of study, and capitalism a significantly older economic system, radical change of current capitalist systems is highly unlikely while internalization of natural resources into the economy is much more feasible.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[John Bellamy Foster]] believes that commodification of nature might be more dangerous than the impending danger of climate change and ecologic disaster. Foster fears that commodification of nature might lead to a system that favors economy over ecology (endangering natural resources) and promote a form of [[neocolonialism]] that acknowledges the elements of capitalism, globalization, and cultural imperialism, but disregards the idea of colonialism altogether.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Degradation of resources, underproduction of conditions ===
As fictitious commodities with origins outside of capitalist production, the value of nature, counter to the neoclassical assumption, ''cannot'' be fully accounted for in monetary terms, and there is a resultant tendency toward the [[overexploitation]] and "underproduction" of nature.&lt;ref&gt;Castree 2010b (p. 1740); Kosoy &amp; Corbera 2010 (p. 1231); O‘Connor, James (1998) ''Natural Causes: Essays in Ecological Marxism'', London: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Natural entities that are commodified are subjected to the competitive drive for accumulation. Capitalism is "ecologically irrational," with a systematic tendency to overexploit its natural resource base.&lt;ref&gt;Castree 2005 (pp. 156-158, 160)&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, what O’Connor terms the "[[conditions of production]]" (all the phenomena upon which capitalism depends but is unable to produce itself, including environmental conditions and processes) are subjected to indiscriminate degradation as they ''cannot'' be fully commodified.&lt;ref&gt;Castree 2003 (p. 284); Castree 2010b (p. 1740); O’Connor 1998 (p. 31); Prudham 2005 (p.8, 12)&lt;/ref&gt; This is the [[Eco-socialism#The "second contradiction" of capitalism|"second contradiction"]] of capitalism, between the [[Relations of production|relations]] and [[Productive forces|forces of production]] and its conditions.&lt;ref name="O’Connor 1998"&gt;O’Connor 1998&lt;/ref&gt; Capitalism undermines its own production system, "producing its own scarcity."&lt;ref&gt;Henderson 2009 (p. 277)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reclaiming the commons? ===
Recruiting nature into relations of capitalist exchange "incites a good deal of push back," as these entities and services "matter a great deal to ordinary people."&lt;ref name="Henderson 2009 pp. 276-277"&gt;Henderson 2009 (pp. 276-277)&lt;/ref&gt; Social needs compete politically for access and control of an increasingly commodified nature,&lt;ref&gt;Prudham 2005 (p.8)&lt;/ref&gt; and as price is insufficient to resolve these competing claims, [[Social movement|counter-movements]] emerge,&lt;ref name="Henderson 2009 pp. 276-277"/&gt; expressing the "[[Crisis theory|crisis tendencies]]" of capitalist nature&lt;ref name="O’Connor 1998"/&gt; through socio-political struggles over representation and access.&lt;ref&gt;Castree 2010a (p. 1731); Castree 2010b (p. 1741); McCarthy 2009 (p. 507); Prudham 2009 (pp. 128-129)&lt;/ref&gt;

Protest movements, transnational coalitions, instances of alternative practices and counter-discourses all fall within a broad tent of resistance struggles to "reclaim the commons."&lt;ref&gt;Harvey 2003 (p. 162); McAfee 1999 (p. 133); Also see Klein, Naomi (2001) [http://newleftreview.org/A2323 ‘Reclaiming the Commons’], ''New Left Review'', (9): pp. 81-89.&lt;/ref&gt; This can be seen as Polanyi’s "[[Double movement (social sciences)|double movement]]," in which tendencies toward and against market coordination interact,&lt;ref&gt;Polanyi 2001 ''in'' Castree 2010b (p. 1739)&lt;/ref&gt; based in a rejection of the treatment of the environment as alienable market goods.&lt;ref&gt;O’Neill 2001 (p. 1867)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Specific Examples in Modern Society ==
While there are numerous natural resources that are being capitalized upon all across the world, there are several more notable examples of commodification of nature. The following examples are some that are either more prevalent or larger in scale and scope.

=== Emissions Trading ===
[[Emissions trading]], commonly referred to as cap and trade, embodies commodification of nature in that it allows for the trade of pollution and emissions within a given limit for a specific environment. Rather than simply outright prohibiting or allowing pollution and other various negative externalities, cap and trade essentially permits members of an industry to buy and sell units of emission with a maximum set for the industry as a whole.

While there are various outlooks on whether emissions trading is effective in cutting emissions or pollution, it is pertinent to understand that this concept takes a company or individual's emissions and presents them as something that can be bought or sold on a specialized market.

=== Drinking Water ===
As [[capitalism]] has spread in leaps and bounds, so too has its reach on previously universal resources; one such resource is [[drinking water]].&lt;ref name="investopedia.com"&gt;http://www.investopedia.com/articles/06/water.asp&lt;/ref&gt; As more and more people struggle to find access to clean water, a major economic industry has formed in response, striving to provide this resource to consumers.

Water, a fundamental resource to human survival, now is a multibillion dollar industry.&lt;ref name="investopedia.com"/&gt; Essentially what this means is that something that used to be completely free and public has been taken and turned into a privatized service. One modern example of water commodification is the current conflict going on in [[Flint, Michigan]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cnn.com/2016/03/04/us/flint-water-crisis-fast-facts/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Petroleum ===
As [[petroleum]] has begun to be used for fuel and other various mechanical and transportation uses, the demand for the natural resource has skyrocketed.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.cfm?id=33&amp;t=6&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, an economic industry has formed that completely revolves around the extraction and sale of the resource. By extension, many other industries also rely on the resource such as the automotive industry or anyone that relies on transportation for their business.

Oil is just one of many natural resources being taken from the environment to be sold in markets of various size and influence across the globe. What sets this resource apart from others, however, is that so many other industries are reliant upon oil that it has become one of the most sought after resources across the world.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aapg.org/about/petroleum-geology/petroleum-through-time/what-is-petroleum&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3524">The '''Cross-Niger transition forests''' are a [[tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests|tropical moist broadleaf forest]] [[ecoregion]] of southeastern [[Nigeria]], located between the [[Niger River]] on the west and the [[Cross River (Nigeria)|Cross River]] on the east. Once a rich mixture of tropical forest and savanna woodland covered these low, rolling hills but today this is one of the most densely populated areas of Africa and today most of the forest has been removed and the area is now grassland.

==Location and description==
The ecoregion extends across the Nigerian states of [[Abia State|Abia]], [[Akwa Ibom]], [[Anambra]], [[Ebonyi]], and [[Imo State|Imo]], covering an area of {{convert|20,700|km2|sqmi|sp=us}}. The Niger River separates the Cross-Niger transition forests from the [[Nigerian lowland forests]] to the west, which probably resembles most closely the original environment of the Cross-Niger ecoregion. To the south and south-west lies the  [[Niger Delta swamp forests]]. To the north, the Cross-Niger transition forests yield to the [[Guinean forest-savanna mosaic]] of the drier interior. 

The climate is wet, becoming drier further inland, with a dry season from December to February.

==Flora==
The traditional flora and fauna of the ecoregion is "transitional", blending elements from the [[Upper Guinean forests]] of West Africa and the Lower Guinean-Congolian forests of Central Africa, which constitute the largest blocks of tropical moist forest on the African continent. Trees in the area include [[Afzelia]], which is cultivated for timber, and the [[Borassus aethiopum]] palm.

==Fauna==
Small areas of protected forest do remain within the grassland and these are home to animals such as [[Sclater's guenon]] and crested chameleon ([[Chamaeleo cristatus]]). The [[Niger River]] has always been a substantial barrier to movement of wildlife in and out of the region. Large mammals have been depleted in the area since the 1940s and there is now so little wildlife remaining in the area that even bats and frogs are now trapped and eaten.

==Threats==
The ecoregion has sustained a dense human population for centuries, and much of the original forest cover has been cleared for agriculture, forest plantations, and urban developments such as the oil refineries of [[Port Harcourt]]. The few remaining enclaves of native forest include the [[Stubbs Creek Forest Reserve]] in [[Akwa Ibom]] together with some enclaves of sacred forest, which are continually disappearing as village life is eroded, and patches of riverine forest. There are forest reserves in [[Anambra]] and elsewhere but these last are mostly for the purpose of cultivating timber rather than preserving the original environment.

==Visiting the region==
This is a high level of crime in this part of the world and as of November 2009 the British Government were advising against all but essential travel to Akwa Ibom, especially along the rivers, and warning against the risk of armed robbery in Anambra and Abia also.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/travel-and-living-abroad/travel-advice-by-country/sub-saharan-africa/nigeria FCO travel advice for Nigeria]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fehmarn Belt''' ({{audio|De-Fehmarnbelt.ogg|German pronunciation}}), ({{Lang-da|Femern Bælt}}, former spelling ''Femer Bælt''; {{Lang-nds|Femernbelt}}) is a [[strait]] connecting the [[Bay of Kiel]] and the [[Bay of Mecklenburg]] in the western part of the [[Baltic Sea]] between the [[Germany|German]] island of [[Fehmarn]] and the [[Denmark|Danish]] island of [[Lolland]]. [[Ferry|Ferries]] operated by [[Scandlines]] connect [[Puttgarden]] and [[Rødby]] on the two islands.

The strait features an 18-kilometre (10 nmi) wide area with depths of 20–30 metres. Currents in the strait are weak and mostly dependent on wind.

== Swimming ==
It was initially swum across by [[Christof Wandratsch]]&lt;ref name=swimmers&gt;[http://dailynews.openwaterswimming.com/2012/11/bruno-baumgartner-busts-fehmarn-belt.html]&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Tunnel proposal ==
{{main|Fehmarn Belt Fixed Link}}
The Danish and German governments agreed on 29 June 2007 to build a [[Fehmarn Belt Fixed Link|fixed link]] to replace the ferry route. It is to save an hour on crossing the strait, and provide more crossing capacity.

In 2011, the Danish parliament voted overwhelmingly (with seven of eight parties supporting) for the €5.1 billion project that is intended to open in 2020.&lt;ref name=SUPERTUNNEL&gt;{{cite news|title=Dänemark baut Supertunnel nach Deutschland|url=http://www.spiegel.de/wirtschaft/soziales/0,1518,742887,00.html|accessdate=1 February 2011|newspaper=[[Der Spiegel]], online edition|date=1 February 2011|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tunnel is to have three separate bores, two containing two motorway lanes each, and one with a double-track railway line.&lt;ref name=SUPERTUNNEL/&gt;

In [[geography]] and [[geology]], '''fluvial processes''' are associated with [[river]]s and [[stream]]s and the [[Deposition (geology)|deposits]] and [[landform]]s created by them. When the stream or rivers are associated with [[glacier]]s, [[ice sheet]]s, or [[ice cap]]s, the term '''glaciofluvial''' or '''fluvioglacial''' is used.&lt;ref&gt;K.K.E. Neuendorf, J.P. Mehl, Jr., and J.A. Jackson, eds., 2005, [http://www.agiweb.org/pubs/pubdetail.html?item=300154 ''Glossary of Geology.''] American Geological Institute, Alexandria, Virginia. 800 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=if-PaNVS7cAC&amp;pg=PA84&amp;dq=fluvioglacial+definition&amp;lr=&amp;ei=KaQrSpnHMIncygTF_fScBw Wilson, W.E. &amp; Moore, J.E. 2003. Glossary of Hydrology, [[American Geological Institute]], Springer, 248pp.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fluvial processes==
Fluvial processes include the [[sediment transport|motion of sediment]] and [[erosion]] or [[deposition (geology)|deposition]] on the [[river bed]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Charlton|first=Ro|title=Fundamentals of fluvial geomorphology|year=2008|publisher=Rutledge|location=London|isbn=978-0-415-33454-9|page=234}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wohl|first=Ellen|title=Rivers in the Landscape: Science and Management|year=2014|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=1118414896|page=330}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Erosion by moving water can happen in two ways. Firstly, the movement of water across the [[stream bed]] exerts a [[shear stress]] directly onto the bed. If the [[Cohesion (geology)|cohesive]] strength of the substrate is lower than the shear exerted, or the bed is composed of loose sediment which can be mobilized by such stresses, then the bed will be lowered purely by clearwater flow. However, if the river carries significant quantities of sediment, this material can act as tools to enhance wear of the bed ([[abrasion (geology)|abrasion]]). At the same time the fragments themselves are ground down, becoming smaller and more rounded (attrition).

[[Sediment]] in rivers is transported as either [[bedload]] (the coarser fragments which move close to the bed) or suspended load (finer fragments carried in the water). There is also a component carried as dissolved material.

For each grain size there is a specific [[velocity]] at which the grains start to move, called ''entrainment velocity''. However the grains will continue to be transported even if the velocity falls below the entrainment velocity due to the reduced (or removed) [[friction]] between the grains and the river bed. Eventually the velocity will fall low enough for the grains to be deposited. This is shown by the [[Hjulström curve]].

A river is continually picking up and dropping solid particles of rock and soil from its bed throughout its length. Where the river flow is fast, more particles are picked up than dropped. Where the river flow is slow, more particles are dropped than picked up. Areas where more particles are dropped are called [[alluvial]] or flood plains, and the dropped particles are called [[alluvium]].

Even small streams make alluvial deposits, but it is in the flood plains and [[River delta|deltas]] of large rivers that large, geologically-significant alluvial deposits are found.

The amount of matter carried by a large river is enormous. The names of many rivers derive from the color that the transported matter gives the water. For example, the [[Huang He]] in [[China]] is literally translated "Yellow River", and the [[Mississippi River]] in the [[United States]] is also called "the Big Muddy". It has been estimated that the Mississippi River annually carries 406 million tons of sediment to the sea,&lt;ref&gt;Mathur, Anuradha; Dilip da Cunha (2001). Mississippi Floods: Designing a Shifting Landscape. New Haven, CT: Yale University Press. {{ISBN|0-300-08430-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Yellow River 796 million tons, and the [[Po River]] in [[Italy]] 67 million tons.&lt;ref&gt;Dill, William A. (1990). Inland fisheries of Europe. Rome, Italy: UN Food and Agriculture Organization. {{ISBN|92-5-102999-7}}. http://www.fao.org/docrep/009/t0377e/t0377e00.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Politics of Hong Kong}}
Under the [[Hong Kong Basic Law|Basic Law]], the [[Hong Kong|Hong Kong Special Administrative Region]] is exclusively in charge of its [[Autonomous entity|internal affairs]] and external relations, whilst the [[Central People's Government|Government of the People's Republic of China]] is responsible for its [[diplomacy|foreign affairs]] and [[Military|defence]].&lt;ref&gt;Article 151, [[Hong Kong Basic Law]]&lt;/ref&gt; As a separate [[customs territory]], Hong Kong maintains and develops relations with foreign states and regions, and plays an active role in such [[international organisations]] as [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) and the [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation]] (APEC) in its own right under the name of ''Hong Kong, China''.&lt;ref&gt;Article 152, [[Hong Kong Basic Law]]&lt;/ref&gt; Hong Kong participates in 16 projects of [[United Nations]] [[Sustainable Development Goals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/partnership/search/?str=hong+kong|title=Search - United Nations Partnerships for SDGs platform|author=|date=|website=sustainabledevelopment.un.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
[[File:Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office (Washington, D.C.).JPG|thumb|left|[[Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office]] in the [[Dupont Circle, Washington, D.C.|Dupont Circle]] neighbourhood of Washington, D.C.]]
Hong Kong was under [[colonial Hong Kong|British rule]] before 1 July 1997. Prior to the implementation of the ''Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office Act 1996'' enacted by the [[United Kingdom Parliament|British Parliament]], Hong Kong represented its interests abroad through the [[Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office]]s (HKETOs) and via a special office in the British Embassies or High Commissions, but the latter ceased after the sovereignty of Hong Kong was [[transfer of the sovereignty of Hong Kong|transferred to the PRC]] and became a special administrative region (SAR) of the PRC in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1996/63/contents Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office Act 1996]&lt;/ref&gt; At present, the ''Hong Kong Economic and Trade Offices'' under the [[Hong Kong Government|Government]] of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region in countries that are the major trading partners of Hong Kong, including [[Japan]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]], [[Singapore]], [[Indonesia]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Germany]], the [[United States]], the [[European Union]] as well as an ETO in [[Geneva]] to represent HKSAR Government in the [[WTO]]. These offices serve as the official representative of the Government of the Hong Kong SAR in these countries and international organisations. Its major functions include facilitating trade negotiations and handling trade related matters, inter-government relations with foreign governments; the promoting of investment in Hong Kong; and liaising with the media and business community.  The Hong Kong Government has also set up the [[Hong Kong Tourism Board]] with offices in other countries and regions to promote tourism.&lt;ref&gt;Article 156, [[Hong Kong Basic Law]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hong Kong SAR Government also has an office in Beijing, and three HKETOs at [[Guangzhou]] ([[Guangdong]] ETO), Shanghai and [[Chengdu]]. An HKETO will be set up at [[Wuhan]] in the future. The Central People's Government of the PRC also maintains a liaison office in Hong Kong. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has a representative office in Hong Kong.

Hong Kong makes strenuous law enforcement efforts, but faces serious challenges in controlling transit of heroin and [[methamphetamine]] to regional and world markets; modern banking systems that provide a conduit for [[money laundering]]; rising indigenous use of synthetic drugs, especially among young people.

Hong Kong has its own immigration policy and administration. [[Hong Kong permanent resident|Permanent resident]]s of Hong Kong with PRC nationality hold a different type of passport, called the [[Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Passport]], which is different from that for PRC citizens in [[Mainland China]].&lt;ref&gt;Article 154, [[Hong Kong Basic Law]]&lt;/ref&gt; Hong Kong permanent residents and mainland Chinese need a passport-like document (the "[[Home Return Permit]]" for Hong Kong permanent residents and the [[Two-way Permit]] for Mainland Chinese) to cross the Sino-Hong Kong border. Visitors from other countries and regions not participating in waiver programme are required to apply for visas directly to the Hong Kong Immigration Department.

==Agreements with foreign states==
In accordance with Article 151 of the Basic Law, Hong Kong concluded over 20 agreements with foreign states in 2010 on matters such as economic and financial co-operation, maritime technical co-operation, postal co-operation and co-operation on wine-related businesses. With the authorisation of the Central People's Government of the PRC, Hong Kong also concluded 12 bilateral agreements with foreign states on air services, investment promotion and protection, mutual legal assistance and visa abolition during the year.

==Overseas visits made by senior officials==
The [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong]] and other senior officials often make a duty visit to foreign countries. These visits usually aim to advance Hong Kong's economic and trade relations with the foreign countries. During these visits, the Chief Executive will meet with political and business leaders. Usually, the [[head of state]] or [[head of government]] of the foreign countries will receive the Chief Executive. For example, former Chief Executive [[Tung Chee-hwa]] made three visits to the United States during his term. In these three visits, Tung Chee-hwa met with the [[U.S. President]] in the [[Oval Office]] at the [[White House]]. Chief Executive [[Donald Tsang]] had visited Japan, South Korea, Russia, United Kingdom, United States, Australia, New Zealand, Chile, Brazil, India, France and other countries during his term of government.

For example, Chief Executive [[Donald Tsang]] visited London and [[Edinburgh]] on 2011 as part of his European tour to renew ties with the UK and promote Hong Kong as a gateway to Asia. He met Prime Minister [[David Cameron]] and Foreign Secretary [[William Hague]], and the Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news.gov.hk/en/photo_gallery/people/html/2011/09/20110919_114007.shtml|title=news.gov.hk - Photo Gallery - People|author=|date=|website=www.news.gov.hk}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Mid-2011, Donald Tsang visited Australia in June to strengthen ties between Hong Kong and Australia, promote trade opportunities, and encourage more Australian companies, particularly resources companies, to list in Hong Kong. During his visit, Mr Tsang held meetings with the Prime Minister, [[Julia Gillard]], and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, [[Kevin Rudd]], as well as the leader of the Opposition, [[Tony Abbott]], and the Shadow Minister for Foreign Affairs, [[Julie Bishop]].

Many foreign dignitaries visit Hong Kong each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.protocol.gov.hk/eng/vip/index.html|title=Protocol Division Government Secretariat - VIP Visits|author=|date=|website=www.protocol.gov.hk}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of such visits has grown since 1997 as many of them have included Hong Kong as a destination on their trips to China, while others have visited Hong Kong specifically to see "[[one country, two systems]]" in operation. The level of VIP visits is also boosted by major international conferences held in Hong Kong in recent years. In 2009–2012, there were 11 official visits to Hong Kong, including the visits of the [[Prime Minister of Canada]], [[Secretary of State of the United States of America]], [[President of the Russian Federation]], [[President of the Republic of Indonesia]], [[President of the Republic of Korea]] and other foreign dignitaries.

==Overseas representation in Hong Kong==
{{see also|List of diplomatic missions in Hong Kong}}
When Hong Kong was under [[British Hong Kong|British rule]], most [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] member states, unlike other countries, were represented in Hong Kong by Commissions. However, following the 1997 handover, they were all renamed Consulates-General. Owing to Hong Kong's economic importance, and the large number of British passport holders, the [[British Consulate-General, Hong Kong and Macao|British Consulate-General]] is the largest of its kind in the world and bigger than many British Embassies and High Commissions abroad.&lt;ref name="GOV.UK"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/world/organisations/british-consulate-general-hong-kong|title=British Consulate General Hong Kong - GOV.UK|author=|date=|website=www.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most countries maintain Consulates-General or Consulates in Hong Kong. However, despite their name, many Consulates-General are not subordinate to their country's embassy to the PRC in Beijing. For example, the British Consulate-General is directly subordinate to the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]] of the UK rather than the British embassy in the Chinese capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201415/cmselect/cmfaff/649/64907.htm|title=House of Commons - The UK's relations with Hong Kong: 30 years after the Joint Declaration - Foreign Affairs|first=The Committee Office, House of|last=Commons|date=|website=publications.parliament.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Consul-General of the United States, likewise, holds ambassadorial rank, and reports to the Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian Affairs in the US Department of State.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ait.org.tw/en/pressrelease-pr1224.htm  Christopher J. Marut Appointed as Director of the Taipei Office of the American Institute in Taiwan]{{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, [[American Institute in Taiwan]], May 8, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, the US Consuls-General posted to Chengdu, Guangzhou, Shanghai, and Shenyang report to the Deputy Chief of Mission of the US Embassy in Beijing who is directly subordinate to the US ambassador.

==Relations with Taiwan==
{{main article|Hong Kong Economic, Trade and Cultural Office (Taiwan)}}
{{see also|Hong Kong–Taiwan relations}}

From 2010, the relationship between the territory and Taiwan is managed through the [[Hong Kong-Taiwan Economic and Cultural Co-operation and Promotion Council]] (ECCPC) and [[Taiwan-Hong Kong Economic and Cultural Co-operation Council]] (ECCC).  Meanwhile, the [[Taipei Economic and Cultural Office]] is a ''de facto'' mission of the Republic of China (Taiwan) in Hong Kong.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20031126025622/http://www.eslisland.com/guide/TaiwanEmbassiesabroad.htm Taiwanese Overseas 'Embassies' Abroad]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Nashik District''''', a district in [[Maharashtra]], [[India]], is noted for the mountains and hills occupying the north and north-east of its territory.These hill ranges are eastward spurs of the Western Ghats and form prominent landmarks in the district, some noted for the shrines they harbor while others for the trekking adventures which can be undertaken while ascending the peaks. Broadly categorized, the hills can be segregated into 3 noteworthy ranges:

* [[Selbari Range]] which may be inclusive of the Dholbari range, alternately called  Selbari-Dholbari range.
* [[Satmala Range]] also called the Satmala-Ajanta range.
* [[Trimbakeshwar Range]] constituting the Trimbak-Anjaneri hills.

== Selbari-Dolbari Range ==
{{Main|Selbari Range}}
Selbari is a mountain range located at the northernmost extent of [[Nashik District]] forming a natural boundary between it and [[Dhule District]].Most part of the range lies to the north of the [[Mausam River]] along an east to west axis turning around in a loop coming to lie south of the river to continue along in a west to east fashion. The southern part of the range is attimes identified as a unique range called Dholbari. Alternatively, the range is referred to as the Selbari-Dolbari range.
The highest peak in the range, [[Salher]] (1,567m) also happens to the 2nd [[List of Mountain peaks in Maharashtra|highest peak]] in [[Maharashtra]]  and is significant for being the highest fort in the [[Western Ghats]].

== Satmala Range ==
{{Main|Satmala  Range}}
Satmala is a mountain range which runs across Nashik District, Mahrashtra. They are an integral part of the Sahyadris range within Nashik. These peaks are visible from a greater part of the district and form prominent landmarks. The highest of them is Dhodap (1,451 metres). Dhodap hill is third highest hill peak in Maharashtra after Kalsubai and Salher and 29th highest peak in Western Ghats. At the eastern side of this range lies the Chanvad range.

== Trimbakeshwar ==
{{Main| Trimbakeshwar Range}}
It lies south of the city of [[Nashik]] and is significant for the [[Trimbakeshwar Shiva Temple]] located near the range.The northern face of the range is the birthplace of India's 2nd longest river [[Godavari]].The southern face of these hills are covered with dense forests and thus form a catchment area for the Upper Vaitarna Reservoir, the most important and reliable source of potable water supply to the metropolitan city of [[Mumbai]].
Brahmagiri (1,295meters) is the tallest peak in this range followed by Anjaneri peak(1,280meters).

'''Geotagging''' or '''GeoTagging''', is the process of adding geographical identification [[metadata]] to various media such as a [[geotagged photograph]] or video, websites, SMS messages, QR Codes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://qrd.by |title=Geo Tagged QR Codes |accessdate=2011-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[RSS (file format)|RSS]] feeds and is a form of [[geospatial metadata]]. This data usually consists of [[geographic coordinate system|latitude and longitude coordinates]], though they can also include [[altitude]], [[Bearing (navigation)|bearing]], distance, accuracy data, and place names, and perhaps a [[time stamp]].

Geotagging can help users find a wide variety of location-specific information from a device. For instance, someone can find images taken near a given location by entering latitude and longitude coordinates into a suitable image [[search engine]]. Geotagging-enabled information services can also potentially be used to find location-based news, websites, or other resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mywire.com/pubs/AP/2008/01/18/5437214?extID=10051 |title= GPS adds dimension to online photos |author=Anick Jesdanun, AP |date=2008-01-18 |accessdate=2008-01-19}}&lt;!-- this has a dead URL --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  Geotagging can tell users the location of the content of a given picture or other media or the [[Perspective (visual)|point of view]], and conversely on some media platforms show media relevant to a given location.

The related term [[geocoding]] refers to the process of taking non-coordinate based geographical identifiers, such as a street address, and finding associated [[geographic coordinates]] (or vice versa for [[reverse geocoding]]).  Such techniques can be used together with geotagging to provide alternative search techniques.

==Popular examples==
Geotagging has become a popular feature on several social media platforms, such as Facebook and Instagram.

[[Facebook]] users can geotag photos that can be added to the  page of the location they are tagging. Users may also use a feature that allows them to find nearby Facebook friends, by generating a list of people according to the location tracker in their mobile devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://techcrunch.com/2012/06/24/friendshake-facebooks-new-mobile-feature-for-finding-people-nearby-and-a-highlight-killer/ |title= Facebook’s New Mobile Feature For Finding People Around You |accessdate=2016-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Instagram]] uses a map feature that allows users to geotag photos. The map layout pin points specific photos that the user has taken on a world map.

==Geotagging techniques==
The geographical location data used in geotagging will, in almost every case, be derived from the [[global positioning system]], and based on a [[latitude]]/[[longitude]]-coordinate system that presents each location on the earth from 180° west through 180° east along the [[Equator]] and 90° north through 90° south along the [[prime meridian]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}

===Geotagging photos===
{{main|Geotagged photograph}}
There are two main options for geotagging photos; capturing GPS information at the time the photo is taken or "attaching" the photograph to a map after the picture is taken.

In order to capture GPS data at the time the photograph is captured, the user must have a camera with built in GPS or a standalone GPS along with a digital camera. Because of the requirement for wireless service providers in United States to supply more precise location information for 911 calls by September 11, 2012,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fcc.gov/cgb/consumerfacts/wireless911srvc.html |title=Wireless 911 Services |accessdate=2010-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; more and more cell phones have built-in GPS chips.  Most smart phones already use a GPS chip along with built-in cameras to allow users to automatically geotag photos. Others may have the GPS chip and camera but do not have internal software needed to embed the GPS information within the picture. A few digital cameras also have built-on or built-in GPS that allow for automatic geotagging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fireflyarticles.com/photography/photographers-have-several-camera-options-for-geotagging-pictures-with-gps-points-22.html|title=Photographers Have Several Camera Options for Geotagging Pictures with GPS Points}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Devices use GPS, A-GPS or both. [[Assisted GPS|A-GPS]] can be faster getting an initial fix if within range of a cell phone tower, and may work better inside buildings. Traditional GPS does not need cell phone towers and uses standard GPS signals outside of urban areas. Traditional GPS tends to use more battery power. Almost any digital camera can be coupled with a stand-alone GPS and post processed with photo mapping software, to write the location information to the image's [[exif]] header.

===GPS formats===
GPS coordinates may be represented in text in a number of ways, with more or fewer [[decimal]]s:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Template
! Description
! Example
|-
| [-]d.d, [-]d.d

|}

==Geotagging standards in electronic file formats==

===Photographs===
With photos stored in [[JPEG]], [[TIFF]] and many other file formats, the geotag information, storing camera location and sometimes heading, is typically embedded in the [[metadata]], stored in [[Exchangeable image file format]] (Exif) or [[Extensible Metadata Platform]] (XMP) format. These data are not visible in the picture itself but are read and written by special programs and most [[digital camera]]s and modern [[Image scanner|scanners]].  Latitude and longitude are stored in units of degrees with decimals.&lt;ref&gt;In this format, a positively signed coordinate indicates Northern or Eastern hemisphere, while negative sign indicates Southern or Western hemisphere.&lt;/ref&gt;  This geotag information can be read by many programs, such as the [[cross-platform]] [[open source]] [[ExifTool]]. An example readout for a photo might look like:

 &lt;code&gt;GPS Latitude                    : 57 deg 38' 56.83" N&lt;/code&gt;
 &lt;code&gt;GPS Longitude                   : 10 deg 24' 26.79" E&lt;/code&gt;
 &lt;code&gt;GPS Position                    : 57 deg 38' 56.83" N, 10 deg 24' 26.79" E&lt;/code&gt;

or the same coordinates could also be presented as decimal degrees:

 &lt;code&gt;GPS&lt;/code&gt;
 &lt;code&gt;GPS Longitude                   : 10.40744&lt;/code&gt;
 &lt;code&gt;GPS Position                    : 57.64911 10.40744&lt;/code&gt;

When stored in Exif, the coordinates are represented as a series of rational numbers in the GPS sub-IFD.  Here is a hexadecimal dump of the relevant section of the Exif metadata (with [[Endianness|big-endian]] byte order):

 &lt;code&gt;+ [GPS directory with 5 entries]&lt;/code&gt;
 &lt;code&gt;| 0)  GPSVersionID = 2 2 0 0&lt;/code&gt;
 &lt;code&gt;|     - Tag 0x0000 (4 bytes, int8u[4]):&lt;/code&gt;
 &lt;code&gt;|         dump: 02 02 00 00&lt;/code&gt;
 &lt;code&gt;| 1)  GPSLatitudeRef = N&lt;/code&gt;
 &lt;code&gt;|     - Tag 0x0001 (2 bytes, string[2]):&lt;/code&gt;
 &lt;code&gt;|         dump: 4e 00  [ASCII "N\0"]&lt;/code&gt;
 &lt;code&gt;| 2)  GPSLatitude = 57 38 56.83 (57/1 38/1 5683/100)&lt;/code&gt;
 &lt;code&gt;|     - Tag 0x0002 (24 bytes, rational64u[3]):&lt;/code&gt;
 &lt;code&gt;|         dump: 00 00 00 39 00 00 00 01 00 00 00 26 00 00 00 01&lt;/code&gt;
 &lt;code&gt;|         dump: 00 00 16 33 00 00 00 64&lt;/code&gt;
 &lt;code&gt;| 3)  GPSLongitudeRef = W&lt;/code&gt;
 &lt;code&gt;|     - Tag 0x0003 (2 bytes, string[2]):&lt;/code&gt;
 &lt;code&gt;|         dump: 57 00  [ASCII "W\0"]&lt;/code&gt;
 &lt;code&gt;| 4)  GPSLongitude = 10 24 26.79 (10/1 24/1 2679/100)&lt;/code&gt;
 &lt;code&gt;|     - Tag 0x0004 (24 bytes, rational64u[3]):&lt;/code&gt;
 &lt;code&gt;|         dump: 00 00 00 0a 00 00 00 01 00 00 00 18 00 00 00 01&lt;/code&gt;
 &lt;code&gt;|         dump: 00 00 0a 77 00 00 00 64&lt;/code&gt;

=== Remote sensing data ===
In the field of [[remote sensing]] the geotagging goal is to store coordinates of every pixel in the image. One approach is used with the [[orthophoto]]s where we store coordinates of four corners and all the other pixels can be georeferenced by [[interpolation]]. The four corners are stored using [[GeoTIFF]] or [[World file]] standards. [[Hyperspectral imaging|Hyperspectral images]] take a different approach defining a separate file of the same spatial dimensions as the image where [[latitude]] and [[longitude]] of each pixel are stored as two 2D layers in so called ''Input geometry data'' (IGM) files,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ENVI Classic Tutorial: Georeferencing Images Using Input Geometry|url=http://www.exelisvis.com/portals/0/pdfs/envi/Georef_Input_Geometry.pdf|publisher=[[Exelis]]|accessdate=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; also known as GEO files.

===Audio/video files===
Audio/video files can be geotagged via: metadata, audio encoding, overlay, or with companion files.  Metadata records the geospatial data in the encoded video file to be decoded for later analysis. One of the standards used with [[unmanned aerial vehicle]] is '''[[:File:MISB_Standard_0601.pdf|MISB Standard 0601]]''' which allows geocoding of corner points and horizon lines in individual video frames.&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:MISB Standard 0601.pdf|MISB Standard 0601]]&lt;/ref&gt; Audio encoding involves a process of converting gps data into audio data such as modem squawk. Overlay involves overlaying GPS data as text on the recorded video.  Companion files are separate data files which correspond to respective audio/video files.  Companion files are typically found in the .KML and .GPX data formats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ruggedvid.com/geospatial/|title=Airborne Geospatial Video Recorders, Cameras, and Systems|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;   For audio and video files which use the [[Vorbis comment|vorbiscomment]] metadata format (including [[Opus (audio codec)|Opus]], [[Ogg Vorbis]], [[FLAC]], [[Speex]], and [[Ogg Theora]]), there is a proposed GEO LOCATION&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wiki.xiph.org/VorbisComment#Geo_Location_fields|title=VorbisComment – XiphWiki|website=wiki.xiph.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; field which can be used. Like all vorbiscomments, it is plain text, and it takes the form:

&lt;code&gt;GEO_LOCATION=(decimal latitude);(decimal longitude);([optional]elevation in meters)&lt;/code&gt;

for example:

&lt;code&gt;GEO_LOCATION=35.1592;-98.4422;410&lt;/code&gt;

===SMS messages===
The [[GeoSMS]] standard works by embedding one or more [[Geo URI|'geo' URI]]s in the body of an SMS, for example:

:&lt;code&gt;I'm at the pub geo:-37.801631,144.980294;u=16&lt;/code&gt;

===DNS entries===
{{main|LOC record}}
RFC 1876 defines a means for expressing location information in the [[Domain Name System]]. LOC resources records can specify the latitude, longitude, altitude, precision of the location, and the physical size of on entity attached to an IP address. However, in practice not all IP addresses have such a record, so it is more common to use [[geolocation]] services to find the physical location of an IP address.

===HTML pages===

====ICBM method====

The GeoURL&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geourl.org/add.html |title=Adding yourself to GeoURL |accessdate=2008-07-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515145826/http://geourl.org/add.html |archivedate=2008-05-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; method requires the [[ICBM address|ICBM]] tag&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-daviel-html-geo-tag-08.txt| title=Geographic registration of HTML documents |author=The Internet Engineering Task Force |accessdate=2008-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; (plus optional [[Dublin Core]] metadata), which is used to geotag standard web pages in [[HTML]] format:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="html"&gt;
 &lt;meta name="ICBM" content="50.167958, -97.133185"&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

The similar Geo Tag format allows the addition of placename and region tags:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="html"&gt;
 &lt;meta name="geo.position" content="50.167958;-97.133185"&gt;
 &lt;meta name="geo.placename" content="Rockwood Rural Municipality, Manitoba, Canada"&gt;
 &lt;meta name="geo.region" content="ca-mb"&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

====RDF feeds====
The [[Resource Description Framework|RDF]] method is defined by W3 Group and presents the information in RDF tags:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.w3.org/2003/01/geo/ |title=Basic Geo (WGS84 lat/long) Vocabulary |author=W3C Semantic Web Interest Group |accessdate=2008-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="xml"&gt;
&lt;rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#"
         xmlns:geo="http://www.w3.org/2003/01/geo/wgs84_pos#"&gt;
  &lt;geo:Point&gt;
  &lt;geo:lat&gt;55.701&lt;/geo:lat&gt;
  &lt;geo:long&gt;12.552&lt;/geo:long&gt;
  &lt;/geo:Point&gt;
&lt;/rdf:RDF&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

====Microformat====
The [[Geo (microformat)|Geo microformat]] allows coordinates within HyperText Markup Language pages to be marked up in such a way that they can be "discovered" by software tools. Example:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="html"&gt;
 &lt;span class="geo"&gt;
    &lt;span class="latitude"&gt;50.167958&lt;/span&gt;;
    &lt;span class="longitude"&gt;-97.133185&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

A proposal has been developed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Geo Extension Straw-Man Proposal | url=http://microformats.org/wiki/geo-extension-strawman | accessdate=2007-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; to extend Geo to cover other bodies, such as [[Mars]] and the [[Moon]].

An example is the [[Flickr]] photo-sharing Web site, which provides geographic data for any [[geotagged photo]] in all of the above-mentioned formats.

===Geotagging in tag-based systems===
No industry standards exist, however there are a variety of techniques for adding geographical identification metadata to an information resource. One convention, established by the website [[Geobloggers]] and used by more and more sites, e.g. photo sharing sites [[Panoramio]] and [[Flickr]], and the social bookmarking site [[del.icio.us]], enables content to be found via a location search. Such sites allow users to add metadata to an information resource via a set of so-called ''machine tags'' (see [[folksonomy]]).

 &lt;code&gt;geotagged&lt;/code&gt;
 &lt;code&gt;geo:lat=57.64911&lt;/code&gt;
 &lt;code&gt;geo:lon=10.40744&lt;/code&gt;

This describes the geographic coordinates of a particular location in terms of [[latitude]] (geo:lat) and [[longitude]] (geo:lon). These are expressed in decimal degrees in the [[WGS84]] [[datum (geodesy)|datum]], which has become something of a default geodetic datum with the advent of [[GPS]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}

Using three tags works within the constraint of having tags that can only be single 'words'. Identifying geotagged information resources on sites like [[Flickr]] and [[del.icio.us]] is done by searching for the 'geotagged' tag, since the tags beginning 'geo:lat=' and 'geo:lon=' are necessarily very variable.

Another option is to tag with a [[Geohash]]:

 &lt;code&gt;geo:hash=u4pruydqqvj&lt;/code&gt;

A further convention proposed by [[FlickrFly]] adds tags to specify the suggested viewing angle and range when the geotagged location is viewed in [[Google Earth]]:

 &lt;code&gt;ge:head=225.00&lt;/code&gt;
 &lt;code&gt;ge:tilt=45.00&lt;/code&gt;
 &lt;code&gt;ge:range=560.00&lt;/code&gt;

These three tags would indicate that the camera is pointed heading 225° (south west), has a 45° tilt and is 560 metres from the subject.

Where the above methods are in use, their coordinates may differ from those specified by the photo's internal Exif data, for example because of a correction or a difference between the camera's location and the subject's.

In order to integrate geotags in social media and enhance text readability or oral use, the concept of 'meetag' or tag-to-meet has been proposed. Differing from hashtag construction, meetag includes the geolocation information after an underscore. A meetag is therefore a word or an unspaced phrase prefixed with an underscore ("_"). Words in messages on microblogging and social networking services may be tagged by putting "_" before them, either as they appear in a sentence, (e.g. "There is a concert going _montreuxjazzfestival", "the world wide web was invented _cern _geneve", ...) or appended to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://meet.ag |title=Web page for the 'meetag standard' proposition |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714201304/http://meet.ag/ |archivedate=2014-07-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Geoblogging===
Geoblogging attaches specific geographic location information to [[blog]] entries via ''geotags''. Searching a list of blogs and pictures tagged using geotag technology allows users to select areas of specific interest to them on interactive maps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.everytrail.com/view_trip.php?trip_id=294109 |title=Example of pictures with geotag, using mobile phone}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The progression of [[GPS]] technology, along with the development of various online applications, has fueled the popularity of such tagged blogging, {{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} and the combination of [[GPS Phone]]s and [[GSM localization]], has led to the [[moblog]]ging, where blog posts are tagged with exact position of the user.  [[Real-time geotagging]] relays automatically geotagged media such as photos or video to be published and shared immediately.

For better integration and readability of geotags into blog texts, the [[meetag]] syntax has been proposed, which transforms any word, sentence, or precise geolocalization coordinates prefixed with an underscore into a 'meetag'. It not only lets one express a precise location but also takes in account dynamically changing geolocations.

===Wikipedia article geosearching apps===
{{Cleanup|date=July 2011}}
One of the first attempts to initiate the geotagging aspect of searching and locating articles seems to be the now-inoperative site Wikinear.com, launched in 2008, which showed the user Wikipedia pages that are geographically closest to one's current location.&lt;ref&gt;Willison, Simon. (2008). "[http://simonwillison.net/2008/Mar/22/wikinear/ Wininear.com, OAuth and Fire Eagle]", SimonWillison.net, Mar 22 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2009 app [[Cyclopedia (iPhone application)|Cyclopedia]] works relatively well showing geotagged Wikipedia articles located within several miles of ones location, integrated with a street-view mode, and 360-degree mode.

The app Respotter Wiki, launched in 2009, claims to feature Wikipedia searching via a map, also allowing users to interact with people around them, via messaging and reviews, etc. The app, in its current function, however, seems to give only geotagged photo results.

As of 2017, the [[:de:Wikipedia:WikiProjekt_Georeferenzierung/Hauptseite/Wikipedia-World/en|Wikipedia-World Project]] provides a [https://tools.wmflabs.org/wp-world/karte.php?la=en simple map search tool] which can display tagged articles near to a particular location, as well as a variety of more sophisticated tools integrated with external mapping services.

==Dangers of geotagging==
Following a scientific study&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usenix.org/events/hotsec10/tech/full_papers/Friedland.pdf |title=G. Friedland, R. Sommer: "Cybercasing the Joint: On the Privacy Implications of Geo-Tagging", 5th Usenix Hot Topics in Security Workshop (HotSec2010), Washington DC, August 2010. |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and several demonstrative websites,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pleaserobme.com|title=Please Rob Me|website=www.pleaserobme.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icanstalku.com |title=icanstalku.com |publisher=icanstalku.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; a discussion on the privacy implications of geotagging has raised public attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|N2vARzvWxwY|NBC Action News Smartphone pictures pose privacy risk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Heussner, Ki Mae, [http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/celebrity-stalking-online-photos-give-location/story?id=11162352 "Celebrities' Photos, Videos May Reveal Location"], ''ABC News'', July 16, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn19160-geotags-reveals-celeb-secrets.html Geo-tags reveal celeb secrets], 12 July 2010, by Jim Giles, New Scientist&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/12/technology/personaltech/12basics.html?_r=2 |title=Web Photos That Reveal Secrets Such As Where You Live / "MythBusters" host inadvertently reveals his home address on Twitter |publisher=Nytimes.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, the automatic embedding of geotags in pictures taken with smartphones is often ignored by cell-phone users. As a result, people are often not aware that the photos they publish on the Internet have been geotagged. Many celebrities reportedly gave away their home location without knowing it. According to the study, a significant number of for-sale advertisements on [[Craigslist]], that were otherwise anonymized, contained geotags, thereby revealing the location of high-valued goods—sometimes in combination with clear hints to the absence of the offerer at certain times. Publishing photos and other media tagged with exact geolocation on the Internet allows random people to track an individual's location and correlate it with other information. Therefore, criminals could find out when homes are empty because their inhabitants posted geotagged and timestamped information both about their home address and their vacation residence. These dangers can be avoided by removing geotags with a [[metadata removal tool]] for photos before publishing them on the [[Internet]].&lt;ref&gt;For instance, [http://www.superutils.com/products/exifcleaner/ ExifCleaner] and [http://www.steelbytes.com/?mid=30 JPEG &amp; PNG Stripper]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;iPhone-App [https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/imetaphoto/id549115463 iMetaPhoto]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, four [[United States Army]] [[AH-64 Apache#United States Army|Apache helicopters]] were destroyed on the ground by Iraqi insurgent mortar fire; the insurgents had made use of embedded coordinates in web-published photographs (geotagging) taken of the helicopters by soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.army.mil/article/75165/Geotagging_poses_security_risks |title=Geotagging poses security risks |publisher=Army.mil |date= |accessdate=2013-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another newly realised danger of geotagging is the location information provided to criminal gangs and poachers on the whereabouts of often endangered animals. This can effectively make tourists scouts for these poachers, so geotagging should be turned off when photographing these animals.

A '''governorate''', or a '''guberniya''' ({{lang-rus|губе́рния|p=ɡʊˈbʲɛrnʲɪjə}}; also [[romanized]] {{lang|ru-Latn|'''gubernia''', '''guberniia''', '''gubernya'''}}), was a major and principal administrative subdivision of the [[Russian Empire]] and the early [[Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic|Russian SFSR]] and [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Ukrainian SSR]]. The term is usually translated as ''government'', ''[[governorate]]'', or ''[[province]]''. A governorate was ruled by a [[governor]] ({{lang|ru|губернатор}}, ''gubernator''), a word borrowed from Latin {{lang|la|gubernator}}, in turn from Greek {{lang|el-Latn|kybernetes}}. Sometimes the term ''guberniya'' was informally used to refer to the office of a governor.

Selected governorates were united under an assigned [[governor general]] such as [[Grand Duchy of Finland]], [[Tsardom of Poland]], [[Russian Turkestan]] and others. There also were military governors such as [[Kronshtadt]], [[Vladivostok]], and others. Aside of governorates, other types of divisions were oblasts (region) and okrugs (district).

==First reform==
[[File:Subdivisions of Russia in 1708 (ru).svg|thumb|300px|Division of Russia into eight guberniyas in 1708]]
This subdivision type was created by the edict ([[ukase]]) of [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great]] on December 18, 1708 "On the establishment of the gubernias and cities assigned to them", which divided Russia into [[Administrative divisions of Russia in 1708-1710|eight guberniyas]].

==Second reform==
In 1719, guberniyas were further subdivided into provinces ({{lang|ru|провинции}}, {{lang|ru-Latn|provintsii}}).  Later the number of guberniyas [[Administrative divisions of Russia in 1744-1764|was increased to 23]].
{{Governorates of the Russian Empire}}

==Changes from 1775: Namestnichestvo (Vice royalty)==
[[File:Subdivisions of the Russian Empire in 1914.svg|500px|right]]

By the reform of 1775, subdivision into guberniyas and further into {{lang|ru-Latn|[[uyezd]]s}} ({{lang|ru|уезды}}), was based on population size, and the term ''guberniya'' was replaced by the synonym of Russian origin: {{lang|ru-Latn|namestnichestvo}} ({{lang|ru|наместничество}}), sometimes translated as "viceroyalty".  The term ''guberniya'', however, still remained in use. These viceroyalties were governed by {{lang|ru-Latn|[[namestnik]]i}} ({{lang|ru|наместник}}) (literal translation: "deputy") or "[[Governor-General|governors general]]" ({{lang|ru|генерал-губернатор}}, {{lang|ru-Latn|general-gubernator}}). Correspondingly,  the term "governorate general" ({{lang|ru|генерал-губернаторство}}, {{lang|ru-Latn|general-gubernatorstvo}}) was in use to refer to the actual territory being governed&lt;!--I assume Mikkalai meant the territory, not the office--&gt;. The office of governor general had more administrative power and was in a higher position than the previous office of governor. Sometimes a governor general ruled several guberniyas.

By the ukase of the [[Governing Senate|Russian Senate]] of December 31, 1796, the office of governorate general was demoted to the previous level of governorate, and Russia was again divided into guberniyas, which were subdivided into {{lang|ru-Latn|uyezds}}, further subdivided into {{lang|ru-Latn|[[volost]]s}} ({{lang|ru|волость}}); nevertheless several governorates general made from several guberniyas existed until the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]].

==Guberniya in Poland and Finland==
For the guberniya ({{lang-ru|губе́рния}}, {{lang-pl|gubernia}}, {{lang-sv|[[län]]}}, {{lang-fi|lääni}}) as subdivisions of the [[Congress Poland|Kingdom of Poland]] ("Russian Poland") and the [[Grand Duchy of Finland]]; see [[Administrative division of Congress Poland]] and [[Governorates of the Grand Duchy of Finland]].

==Guberniya in Ukraine==
For the guberniya ({{lang-ru|губе́рния}}, {{lang-ua|губернія}}) as subdivisions of the [[Ukrainian People's Republic]] and the [[Ukrainian SSR]] ("Soviet Ukraine"); see [[Administrative divisions of Ukraine (1918–25)]].

==Post revolutionary changes==
After the [[February Revolution]], the [[Russian Provisional Government]] renamed governors into ''guberniya commissars''. The [[October Revolution]] left the subdivision in place, but the governing apparatus was replaced by ''guberniya [[Soviet (council)|soviet]]s'' ({{lang|ru|губернский совет}}).

Actual subdivisions of the [[Soviet Union]] into particular territorial units was subject to numerous changes, especially during the 1918–1929 period. Because of the Soviet Union's electrification program under the [[GOELRO plan]], [[Ivan Alexandrov]] directed the Regionalisation Commission of [[Gosplan]] to divide the Soviet union into thirteen [[Europe]]an and eight [[Asia]]tic [[oblasts]], using rational economic planning rather than "the vestiges of lost sovereign rights".&lt;ref&gt;''Ekonomicheskoe raionirovanie Rossii'', Gosplan, Moscow 1921&lt;/ref&gt;  Eventually, in 1929, the subdivision was replaced by the notions of [[oblast]], [[okrug]], and ''[[raion]]''.

In post-Soviet republics such as Russia and Ukraine, the term ''Guberniya'' is obsolete, yet the word ''gubernator'' was reinstated and is used when referring to a governor of an [[oblast]] or a [[krai]].

== Other uses == 
There is another archaic meaning of the word as the word denoted a type of estate in former Lithuania of the [[Russian Empire]] till 1917.

They "account for a large share of the overall kilometres travelled, especially by air."&lt;ref name="gossling"/&gt; These people contribute significantly to the overall amount of [[airmiles]] flown within a given society.&lt;ref&gt;Høyer, K.

''[http://www.informaworld.com/index/908038833.pdf]''&lt;/ref&gt;  Although concerns over hypermobility apply to several modes of transport, the [[environmental impact of aviation]] and especially its [[greenhouse gas emissions]] have brought particular focus on flying.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson K, Bows A (2008).

(Presentation slides): Reframing climate change: from long-term targets to emission pathways. ''[http://transitionculture.org/wp-content/uploads/kevin-anderson-2.ppt]''&lt;/ref&gt; Among the reasons for this focus is that these emissions, because they are made at high altitude, have a climate impact that is commonly estimated to be 2.7 higher than the same emissions if made at ground-level.&lt;ref&gt;Peeters, P. &amp; Williams, V. 2009.

Although the amount of time people have spent in motion has remained constant since 1950, the shift from feet and bicycles to cars and planes has increased the speed of travel fivefold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.olis.oecd.org/olis/1999doc.nsf/63c71d2d4054d0fdc125685d0053aee4/c125685b002f5004c125686b005cb510/$FILE/00071363.PDF#page=95|pages=118|author=John Adams|title=Proceedings from the Ottawa Workshop - OECD|date=19 January 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This results in the twin effects of wider and shallower regions of social activity around each person (further exacerbated by electronic communication which can be seen as a form of virtual mobility), and a degradation of the social and physical environment brought about by the high speed traffic (as theorised by urban designer [[Donald Appleyard]]).

The changes are brought about locally due to the use of cars and motorways, and internationally by aeroplanes.  Some of the social threats of hypermobility include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/558292.stm|title=Hypermobility: The road to ruin|date=11 December 1999|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regions in Crisis: New Perspectives in European Regional Theory (p.76-92).&lt;/ref&gt; and since the early 1990s has also referred to excessive travel.

'''ISO 3166-2:MD''' is the entry for [[Moldova]] in [[ISO 3166-2]], part of the [[ISO 3166]] [[standardization|standard]] published by the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO), which defines [[code]]s for the names of the principal [[country subdivision|subdivision]]s (e.g., [[province]]s or [[state (administrative division)|state]]s) of all [[country|countries]] coded in [[ISO 3166-1]].

Currently for Moldova, ISO 3166-2 codes are defined for [[districts of Moldova|1 autonomous territorial unit, 3 cities, 32 districts, and 1 territorial unit]]. The three cities have special status equal to the districts.

Each code consists of two parts, separated by a hyphen. The first part is {{mono|MD}}, the [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2]] code of Moldova. The second part is two letters.

Due to limited international recognition, [[Transnistria]] is considered part of Moldova and does not have its own ISO 3166-1 code.

==Current codes==
Subdivision names are listed as in the ISO 3166-2 standard published by the ISO 3166 Maintenance Agency (ISO 3166/MA).

Subdivision names are sorted in [[Romanian alphabet|Moldovan alphabetical]] order: a, â, ă, b-i, î, j-s, ș, t, ț, u-z.

'''Igboland''' ([[Pan-Nigerian alphabet|Standard]] {{Lang-ig|Àlà Ị̀gbò}}{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}), also known as '''Southeastern Nigeria,''' is the homeland of the [[Igbo people]].&lt;ref name="www.faculty.ucr.edu"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Baikie (1854) uses ''I´gbo'' as the term for Igboland: "I´gbo, as I have formerly mentioned, extends east and west, from the Old Kalabár river to the banks of the Kwóra, and possesses also some territory at Abó to the westward of the latter stream." ([https://archive.org/stream/narrativeofexplo00baik#page/306/ p. 307]).&lt;/ref&gt;
It is a non-governmental [[cultural region|cultural]] and common linguistic region in southern [[Nigeria]]. Geographically, it is divided by the lower [[Niger River]] into two unequal sections – an eastern (which is the larger of the two) and a western section.&lt;ref name="www.faculty.ucr.edu"/&gt; It is characterised by the diverse [[Igbo culture]] and the equally diverse [[Igbo language]].&lt;ref name="https://books.google.com"&gt;{{cite book |title=Foreign Missionary Background and Indigenous Evangelization in Igboland: Igboland and The Igbo People of Nigeria |first1= Nkem Hyginus|last1=Chigere|publisher= Transaction Publishers, USA |year=2000 |isbn=3-8258-4964-3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sAY8aQz4ztEC&amp;pg=PA17|page=17 |accessdate=January 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="www.faculty.ucr.edu"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~legneref/igbo/igbo1.htm |title=The Igbo People - Origins &amp; History |first1= Katharine |last1=Slattery|publisher= School of English, Queen's University of Belfast|work=www.faculty.ucr.edu|accessdate=April 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ia600303.us.archive.org"/&gt;{{rp|307}}&lt;ref name="ia600303.us.archive.org"/&gt;{{rp|315}}
 
Politically, Igboland is divided into several southern [[Nigerian states]]. Culturally, it is divided into several subgroupings, including the [[Anioma]], [[Ngwa people|Ngwa]], [[Abiriba]], [[Edda people|Edda Egbebu]], [[Ezaa people|Ezaa]], [[Ibeku]], [[Ohuhu people|Ohuhu]], [[Omuma people|Omuma]] and the [[Ekpeye]]. [[William Balfour Baikie]] remarked that "in Igbo[land] each person hails, as a sailor would say, from the particular district where he was born, but when away from home all are Igbos. And yet considerable differences exist between different parts of this extensive country, and the dialects spoken also vary greatly."&lt;ref name="ia600303.us.archive.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://archive.org/details/narrativeofexplo00baik|title=Narrative of an Exploring Voyage up the rivers of Kwora and Binue( commonly known as Niger and Tsádda) in 1854 with a map and appendices|first1= William Balfour |last1=Baikie|year=1856|work=ia600303.us.archive.org&lt;!--|publisher= School of English, Queen's University of Belfast--&gt;|publisher= John Mueray, Albemarle Street (published with a sanction of Her Majesty's Government).|accessdate=April 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|307}}

==Territorial boundaries==
Igboland is surrounded on all sides by a host of large rivers, and other southern and central Nigeria indigenous tribes namely [[Bini people|Bini]], [[Urhobo people|Urhobo-Isoko]], [[Ijaw people|Ijaw]], [[Ogoni]], [[Igala people|Igala]], [[Tiv people|Tiv]], [[Yakö people|Yako]], [[Idoma people|Idoma]] and [[Ibibio people|Ibibio]].&lt;ref name="www.faculty.ucr.edu"/&gt; In the words of William B. Baikie, "Igbo homeland, extends east and west, from the Old Kalabar river to the banks of the Kwora, [[Niger River]], and possesses also some territory at [[Aboh]], an Igbo clan, to the west-ward of the latter stream. On the north it borders on Igara, [[Igala people|Igala]] and A'kpoto, and it is separated from the sea only by petty tribes, all of which trace their origin to this great race".&lt;ref name="ia600303.us.archive.org"/&gt;{{rp|307}}

It is primarily situated in the [[Lower Guinean forests|Lowland forest]] region of Nigeria, with parts in the Niger-Delta, where the Niger river fans out into the Atlantic Ocean in a vast network of creeks and mangrove swamps on the [[Bight of Bonny]].&lt;ref name="palgraveconnect.com"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1057/9780230116689 |title=John N Oriji, Political Organisation in Nigeria since the late Stone Age, A history of the Igbo People |page=13 |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest found settlements in Igboland date back to 4500 BC in the central area, from where the majority of the Igbo-speaking population is believed to have migrated. The northern Igbo [[Kingdom of Nri]], which rose around the 10th century AD, is credited with the foundation of much of Igboland's culture, customs, and religious practices. It is the oldest existing monarchy in present-day Nigeria. In southern Igboland several groups developed, of which the most notable was the [[Aro Confederacy]]. Igboland was part of the [[Southern Nigeria Protectorate]] of the [[British Empire]] and was amalgamated into modern-day Nigeria in 1914; the nation gained independence in 1960.&lt;ref name="www.faculty.ucr.edu"/&gt; Shortly afterwards Igboland was involved in its biggest war during [[Nigerian Civil War|Biafra's movement for secession]], which eventually ended in 1970 when this area rejoined Nigeria.

==Ancient trade routes==
Igboland's culture has been shaped primarily by its rainforest climate, its ancient trade, migration, and social history within its various clans and peoples, and with its ancient trading neighbours, allies and lately with Europeans.&lt;ref name="www.faculty.ucr.edu"/&gt;
Mr W. B. Baikie said, "I seized the moment, and, by our interpreter, told Tshukuma, that we had come to make his acquaintance and his friendship, and to ascertain if the people were willing to trade with us", whilst signing a trade agreement with Igbo chief, Mr Tshukuma (Chukwuma) Obi from [[Aboh]] clan, who were one of the leading Igbo clans, engaged in early active trading with [[Europe]].&lt;ref name="ia600303.us.archive.org"/&gt;{{rp|45}} Similarly, "after our salutations, I spoke of friendship, of trade, and of education, and particularly enlarged upon the evils of war, and the benefits of peace, all of which was well received", remarked William B. Balkie when signing a trade agreement with Igbo chief, Ezebogo in [[Asaba, Delta|Asaba]] on August 30, 1885.&lt;ref name="ia600303.us.archive.org"/&gt;{{rp|296}}

Due to the native common linguistic standard and interrelated cultures in Igboland, pre-dating the arrival of Europeans, the lower [[Niger River]], which divides [[Southeastern Nigeria|Igboland]] into unequal eastern and western parts, has from ancient times continued to provide easy means of communication, trading and unity amongst Igbos on both sides of the [[Niger River]],&lt;ref name="ia600303.us.archive.org"/&gt;{{rp|300}} as well as promoted ancient trade and migration of people into Igboland, and between Igboland and rest of the world.&lt;ref name="www.faculty.ucr.edu"/&gt; Some of the notable ancient trade and export routes in Igboland included the famous lower [[Niger River|Niger]] and [[Njaba River|Njaba]]-[[Oguta lake]]-[[Orashi River|Orashi]] navigational routes via [[Asaba, Delta|Asaba]]-[[Onitsha]]-[[Aboh]],&lt;ref name="ia600303.us.archive.org"/&gt;{{rp|315}}&lt;ref name=www.britannica.com&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/place/Asaba|title=Asaba|work=www.britannica.com|publisher=The Britanica|accessdate=April 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Awo-omamma]]-[[Oguta]]-[[Ogba–Egbema–Ndoni]]-[[Aboh]] ferry services respectively.&lt;ref name="ia600303.us.archive.org"/&gt;{{rp|300}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Up the Niger (1856-1930) |first1= Augustus.F-Ferryman|last1=Mockler|p=236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Stone Age===
There is evidence of [[Late Stone Age]] (late Paleolithic) human presence from at least 10,000 years ago.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}
Early settlement of Igboland dates back to 6000 BC based on early pottery found in the Okigwe, Oka Igwe, and known today as Awka.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}
Much of the pottery excavated by a team led by [[Thurstan Shaw]] with the [[University of Nigeria]] at Nsukka in 1978 uncovered a rock quarry which was a mine for tool and pottery making for a 'stone civilisation' nearby at [[Ibagwa]]. 
Anthropologists at the [[University of Benin (Nigeria)|University of Benin]] discovered fossils and use of monoliths dating back to 4500 BC at [[Ugwelle-Uturu]] in the Okigwe area.
&lt;ref&gt;Oliver Ifeanyi Anyabolu, ''Nigeria, past to the present: from 500 B.C. to the present'' (2000), p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;
Further evidence of ancient settlements were uncovered at a hypothesised Nsukka metal cultural area from 3000 BC and later settlements attributed to [[Ngwa]] culture at AD 8-18.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}
It is unclear what cultural links there are between these pre-historic artefacts and today. Later human settlement in the region may have links with other discoveries made in the wider area particularly with the culture]] associated with the  [[Nok culture|terracotta discoveries at Nok]] spanning a wide area about north-central Nigeria.

Some local villagers retain  the Original name, like Umuzuoka, The Blacksmiths Ezioka, Okigwe, Imoka, etc.{{clarify|date=August 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Elizabeth |first=Isichei |title=A History of the Igbo People |publisher=London: Macmillan |year=1976 |isbn=0-333-18556-0}}; excerpted in "[https://books.google.com/books?id=oHt6gmjbpewC&amp;pg=PA83 Cultural Harmony I: Igboland — the World of Man and the World of Spirits]", section 4 of Kalu Ogbaa, ed., ''Understanding Things Fall Apart'' (Westport, Connecticut: Greenwood Press, 1999; {{ISBN|0-313-30294-4}}), pp. 83–85.

&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nsukka-Okigwe axis forms as a basis for a proposed Proto-Igbo cultural heartland antecedent to contemporary Igbo culture.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} 
Much of the Igbo population is believed to have expadnded from a smaller area within in this region, diverging into several independent Igbo-speaking tribes, village-groups, kingdoms and states. 
The movements were generally broken into two trends in migration: a more northerly spread group towards the banks of the Niger and the upper quadrant of the Cross River; the other, following a southerly trail had mostly risen from the [[Isu people|Isu]] populations based nearer the axis from which the majority of southern Igbo communities were populated. Mbaise are notably the best examples of an Igbo group claiming autochthony and rejecting many migratory histories about their origins, many of these groups either way are evidently culturally northern or southern Igbo based on the proximity of their traditions to those of their neighbours and, many times, familial and political ties.

===Igbo-Ukwu finds (AD 300–900)===
{{See also|Archaeology of Igbo-Ukwu}}
[[File:9th century bronze ceremonial pot, Igbo-Ukwu, Nigeria.JPG|thumb|alt=An image of a bronze bowl from the Igbo archaeological site known as Igbo ukwu|right|[[Archaeology of Igbo-Ukwu|Igbo-Ukwu]] was the site of an early indigenous bronze industry that was rediscovered in the 20th century. Many of the items recovered were ritual objects like this 9th century bronze vessel.]]
 
The first Igbo Ukwu metal and precious artefacts finds were made accidentally in 1939, when one Isiah Anozie was digging  a cistern.
This led to the discovery of a larger network of linked metal works from the 9th century. The works were based in Igbo Ukwu and further finds were found by archaeology teams led by Thurstan Shaw in 1959-60 and in 1964 in the compound of Jonah Anozie.

Initially, throughout the 1960s and 1970s it was thought that the Igbo Ukwu bronze and copper items were of an external origin or were influenced by outside technology due to their technical sophistication. The opposite was revealed to be true since local copper deposits had been exploited by the 9th century and anthropological evidence, such as the Ichi-like scarifications on the human figures, show local origin. The works have been attributed to an isolated bronze industry which had developed without outside influence over time to reach such sophistication.

Igbo trade routes of the early second millennium reached the cities of  [[Mecca]], [[Medina]] and [[Jeddah]] through a network of trade routes journeyed by middlemen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=McMafia Seriously Organised Crime |first=Misha |last=Glenny |publisher=Random House |year=2008 |isbn=0-09-948125-1 |page=200}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was evidence of beads that originated in India in the 9th century Igbo Ukwu burial sites: Thousands of glass beads were uncovered from the ruined remains of a nobleman's garments. The burial site was associated with the Nri Kingdom which began around the same century according to indigenous history.&lt;ref name=igboukwu&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/igbo/hd_igbo.htm |last=Apley |first=Apley |title=Igbo-Ukwu (ca. 9th century) |publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art|accessdate=2008-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kingdom of Nri (900–c. 1560)===
The northern Igbo [[Kingdom of Nri]], rising around the 10th century based on Umunri traditions, is credited with the foundation of much of Igboland's culture, customs, and religious practices. It is the oldest existing monarchy in present-day Nigeria. It was around the mid-10th century that the divine figure Eri is said to have migrated, according to Umunri lore, to the [[Anambra River|Anambra]] ({{Lang-ig|Omambara}}) river basin &amp;mdash; specifically at its meeting with Ezu river known as Ezu na Omambara in present-day [[Aguleri]]. The exact origins of Eri are unknown and much of Nri traditions present him as a divine leader and civiliser sent from heaven to begin civilisation. In contrast, Eri's origins generally suggest a north easterly origin which has sparked up debate pertaining to a possible [[Igala people|Igala]] origin for Eri.

Due to historic trade and migration of old, other people also entered the Igboland in about the fourteenth or fifteenth centuries and mixed with the natives.&lt;ref name="www.faculty.ucr.edu"/&gt; Towards the western end of Igboland, across the [[Niger River]], rose a man known as Eze Chima who fled Benin with his accomplices after a dispute with the Oba of Benin who consequently exiled him in the 1560s. As they left Benin City heading eastwards, Eze Chima and his followers settled in a number of lands and established monarchies with the natives in those areas.&lt;ref name="www.faculty.ucr.edu"/&gt; Those grew into major village groups and towns after the 16th century.&lt;ref name="www.faculty.ucr.edu"/&gt; Collectively, these places are known as Umuezechima which translates as 'the children or descendants of king Chima'.

===Igala wars and European contact (1450–1750)===

The extreme northern parts of Igboland in the eighteenth were subject to much raiding by elements of the Igala people of Idah under Onoja Oboni, a descendant of one of the Idah royal families. The conflicts drew down further into areas in central northern Igboland, particularly Nsugbe near where early European settlers with Joseph Hawkins noted events from parts of the conflicts between the 'Ebo Country' and 'Galla' in ''A History of a Voyage to the Coast of Africa'' published in 1797. Umueri traditions state that Onoja Oboni, however, is of royal Eri stock and founded Idah as he trailed northwards. The Igala do not claim origins from Onoja Oboni or the Igbo.

===Arochukwu and the slave trade (1750–1850)===
{{main|Aro Confederacy}}
A number of polities rose either directly or indirectly as a result of Nri; the most powerful kingdom of these was the [[Aro Confederacy]] which rose in the Cross River region in the 17th century and declined after British colonisation in the early 20th century. The Aro state centred on Arochukwu followed Nri's steady decline, basing much of its economic activities on the rising trade in slaves to Europeans by coastal African middlemen.

The present site of Arochukwu was originally settled by the [[Ibibio people]] under the Obong Okon Ita kingdom before the conquest of what became [[Obinkita]] in the 17th century by two main Igbo groups: the Eze Agwu clan and the Oke Nnachi assisted by the [[Ibom Isi]] (or Akpa) mercenaries under the leadership of the [[Nnubi dynasty]]. Led by [[Agwu Inobia]], a descendant of Nna Uru from [[Abiriba]], the Eze Agwu clan was centered at their capital Amanagwu and were resisted by Obong Okon Ita which led to the start of the [[Aro-Ibibio Wars]].

The war initially became a stalemate. Both sides arranged a marriage between the king of Obong Okon Ita and a woman from Amanagwu. The marriage eventually failed to bring peace but played a decisive role in the war. Oke Nnachi was led by [[Nnachi Ipia]] who was a ''dibia'' or priest among the [[Edda people]] and was called by Agwu Inobia to help in the war against the Ibibio. These groups were followed by a third non-Igbo [[Ekoi people|Ekoi]]-cultured group, Akpa or Ibom Oburutu who were led by Akuma Nnaubi, the first Eze Aro, the title of the king of the Aro.

In southern Igboland several groups developed mostly independent of Nri influence. Most of these groups followed a migration out of [[Isu people|Isu communities]] in present-day [[Imo State]], although some communities, such as the Mbaise cluster of village groups, claim to be [[Indigenism|autochthonous]].

===Colonial era (1850–1960)===
[[File:Enugu panorama1.jpg|thumb|alt=A picture of a panorama of the Nigerian city of Enugu which is considered the Igbo capital|Enugu, the capital city of the old Eastern Region of Nigeria.]]

Following the British parliament's abolition of the slave trade in 1830, the British royal navy had opened up trade with coastal towns Bonny and Opobo and further inland on the Niger with Asaba in the 1870s. The palm oil industry, the biggest export, grew large and important to the British who traded here. British arrival and trade led to increased encounters between the Igbo and other polities and ethnic groups around the [[Niger River]] and led to a deepening sense of a distinct Igbo ethnic identity. Missionaries had started arriving in the 1850s. The Igbo, at first wary of the religion, started to embrace Christianity and Western education as traditional society broke down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Missionary Enterprise and Rivalry in Igboland, 1857–1914|author=Felix K.

===Nigerian independence and Civil War (1960s)===
{{Main|Nigerian Civil War}}
Following the independence of Nigeria from the [[United Kingdom]] in 1960, most of Igboland was included in its [[Eastern Region, Nigeria|Eastern Region]].

Following a coup in 1966 which saw mostly Igbo soldiers assassinating politicians from the western and northern regions of Nigeria, [[Johnson Aguiyi-Ironsi]] seized control of Lagos, the capital, and came into power as military head of state of Nigeria. In revolt and retaliation against the government General Aguiyi-Ironsi was ambushed and assassinated by Northern members of the military on 29 July 1966 in a revolt against that had strong ethnic overtones. Ironsi's assassination stood out more because of the method of his killers; Ironsi had his legs tied to the back of a Land Rover and was driven around town while still attached.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Annual Survey of African Law |first=Neville |last=Rubin |publisher=Routledge, 1970 |isbn=0-7146-2601-5 |page=20 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=orH4bpOCYSkC&amp;pg=PA20}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Eastern Region, Nigeria|Eastern Region]] formed the core of the secessionist Republic of Biafra. A regional council of the peoples of Eastern Nigeria decided the region should secede as the Republic of Biafra on May 30, 1967.&lt;ref name=biafradate&gt;

The movement for the  sovereignty of Biafra has continued with a minority, most making up the [[Movement for the Actualization of the Sovereign State of Biafra|MASSOB]] organisation.

'''Geography and biodiversity'''
{{Igbo land labelled map}}
Historically, Igboland has taken up a large part of southeastern Nigeria, mostly on the eastern side of the [[Niger River]]. The Igbos claim their territory extends westward across the Niger to the regions of Aniocha, Ndokwa, Ukwuani, and Ika in present-day Delta State.  Its eastern side is terminated by the [[Cross River (Nigeria)|Cross River]], although micro-communities exist over on the other side of the river; its northernmost point enters the Savannah climate around [[Nsukka]].

'''Ilocos''' collectively refers to two [[Provinces of the Philippines|provinces]] in the [[Philippines]]: [[Ilocos Norte]] and [[Ilocos Sur]] which used to be a single province. Inhabitants are called ''[[Ilocanos]]'' and they speak the language [[Iloko]], also called ''Ilocano''.

The [[Ilocos Region]], containing four provinces, is named after Ilocos. 56 percent of the inhabitants of the region are [[Pangasinan people]], who belong to a different ethnolinguistic group from the Ilocanos. Ilocos may also refer to the former province before Ilocos Norte and Ilocos Sur were divided.

In the 330 pages “The Ilocos Heritage” (the 27th book written by Visitacion de la Torre), the boy legacy and the life of the Ilocano – are described as - "the browbeaten, industrious, cheerful, simple soul who has shown a remarkable strain of bravery and a bit of wanderlust." The Ilocano history reveals his struggles and victories – in battles for colonial independence from Spain and America, to Philippine leadership. The new Ilocano searched for greener pastures towards new lands local and foreign - [[Palawan]], [[Mindanao]], [[Hawaii]], the [[United States]] and [[Greece]]. The Ilocano material culture and spirituality can be seen in the past - images of Spanish santo (saints), antique but intricate wooden furniture and quality local fiber. The native Ilocano is a [[weaver (occupation)|weaver]], [[wood carver]] and [[pottery]] expert. The Ilocano [[cuisine]] – ranges from the exotic "abu-os" ([[ant]] [[Egg (food)|eggs]]) to vegetable broth "dinengdeng," the sticky "tinubong" to the "poqui-poqui" ([[eggplant]] salad). Ilocandia is filled with colonial churches, the legacy of Spanish [[Catholicism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/regions/view/20080924-162501/The-rich-treasures-of-Ilocandia newsinfo.inquirer.net, The rich treasures of Ilocandia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080924172326/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/regions/view/20080924-162501/The-rich-treasures-of-Ilocandia |date=2008-09-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Antarctica==
As Antarctica has no resident human population, the human presence there is limited to short term research or sporting expeditions. The [[Antarctic Treaty System]] provides that all legal rights in Antarctica are governed by those of the person's home nation, and do not change based on which country's Antarctic territorial claim the person happens to be present in at any given time.

{{Horizontal TOC|nonum=y}}

==Ducks, geese, and waterfowl==
'''Order''': [[Anseriformes]]{{nbsp|3}}'''Family''': [[Anatidae]]

Anatidae includes the [[duck]]s and most duck-like waterfowl, such as [[Goose|geese]] and [[swan]]s. These birds are adapted to an aquatic existence with webbed feet, flattened bills, and feathers that are excellent at shedding water due to an oily coating.

*[[White-faced whistling-duck]], ''Dendrocygna viduata'' (V)
*[[Black-bellied whistling-duck]], ''Dendrocygna autumnalis''
*[[Comb duck]], ''Sarkidiornis melanotos'' (V)
*[[Northern shoveler]], ''Spatula clypeata''
*[[Blue-winged teal]], ''Spatula discors''
*[[American wigeon]], ''Mareca americana''
*[[White-cheeked pintail]], ''Anas bahamensis''
*[[Green-winged teal]], ''Anas crecca''
*[[Ring-necked duck]], ''Aythya collaris'' (V)
*[[Lesser scaup]], ''Aythya affinis''
*[[Masked duck]], ''Nomonyx dominicus'' (V)

==New World quail==
'''Order''': [[Galliformes]]{{nbsp|3}}'''Family''': [[Odontophoridae]]

The [[New World quail]]s are small, plump terrestrial birds only distantly related to the quails of the Old World, but named for their similar appearance and habits.

*[[Crested bobwhite]], ''Colinus cristatus''

==Flamingos==
'''Order''': [[Phoenicopteriformes]]{{nbsp|3}}'''Family''': [[Phoenicopteridae]]

[[Flamingo]]s are gregarious wading birds, usually {{convert|3|to|5|ft|m|1}} tall, found in both the Western and Eastern Hemispheres. Flamingos filter-feed on shellfish and algae. Their oddly shaped beaks are specially adapted to separate mud and silt from the food they consume and, uniquely, are used upside-down.

*[[American flamingo]], ''Phoenicopterus ruber''

==Grebes==
'''Order''': [[Podicipediformes]]{{nbsp|3}}'''Family''': [[Podicipedidae]]

[[Grebe]]s are small to medium-large freshwater diving birds. They have lobed toes and are excellent swimmers and divers. However, they have their feet placed far back on the body, making them quite ungainly on land.

*[[Least grebe]], ''Tachybaptus dominicus''
*[[Pied-billed grebe]], ''Podilymbus podiceps''

==Pigeons and doves==
'''Order''': [[Columbiformes]]{{nbsp|3}}'''Family''': [[Columbidae]]

*[[Groove-billed ani]], ''Crotophaga sulcirostris''
*[[Yellow-billed cuckoo]], ''Coccyzus americanus''
*[[Mangrove cuckoo]], ''Coccyzus minor''

==Nightjars and allies==
'''Order''': [[Caprimulgiformes]]{{nbsp|3}}'''Family''': [[Caprimulgidae]]

[[Nightjar]]s are medium-sized nocturnal birds that usually nest on the ground. They have long wings, short legs, and very short bills. Most have small feet, of little use for walking, and long pointed wings. Their soft plumage is camouflaged to resemble bark or leaves.

*[[Lesser nighthawk]], ''Chordeiles acutipennis'' (V)
*[[Common nighthawk]], ''Chordeiles minor''
*[[Antillean nighthawk]], ''Chordeiles gundlachii'' (V)
*[[White-tailed nightjar]], ''Hydropsalis cayennensis''
*[[Chuck-will's-widow]], ''Antrostomus carolinensis'' (V)

==Swifts==
'''Order''': [[Apodiformes]]{{nbsp|3}}'''Family''': [[Apodidae]]

[[Swift]]s are small birds which spend the majority of their lives flying. These birds have very short legs and never settle voluntarily on the ground, perching instead only on vertical surfaces. Many swifts have long swept-back wings which resemble a crescent or boomerang.

*[[Black swift]], ''Cypseloides niger'' (V)
*[[Chimney swift]], ''Chaetura pelagica'' (V)

==Hummingbirds==
'''Order''': [[Apodiformes]]{{nbsp|3}}'''Family''': [[Trochilidae]]

[[Hummingbird]]s are small birds capable of hovering in mid-air due to the rapid flapping of their wings. They are the only birds that can fly backwards.

*[[White-necked jacobin]], ''Florisuga mellivora'' (V)
*[[Rufous-breasted hermit]], ''Glaucis hirsutus'' (V)
*[[Ruby-topaz hummingbird]], ''Chrysolampis mosquitus''
*[[Blue-tailed emerald]], ''Chlorostilbon mellisugus''

==Rails, gallinules, and coots==
'''Order''': [[Gruiformes]]{{nbsp|3}}'''Family''': [[Rallidae]]

Rallidae is a large family of small to medium-sized birds which includes the [[Rail (bird)|rails]], [[crake]]s, [[coot]]s, and [[gallinule]]s. Typically they inhabit dense vegetation in damp environments near lakes, swamps, or rivers. In general they are shy and secretive birds, making them difficult to observe. Most species have strong legs and long toes which are well adapted to soft uneven surfaces. They tend to have short, rounded wings and are weak fliers.

*[[American purple gallinule|Purple gallinule]], ''Porphyrio martinica''
*[[Sora (bird)|Sora]], ''Porzana carolina''
*[[Common gallinule]], ''Gallinula galeata''
*[[American coot]], ''Fulica americana''

==Plovers and lapwings==
'''Order''': [[Charadriiformes]]{{nbsp|3}}'''Family''': [[Charadriidae]]

The family Charadriidae includes the [[plover]]s, [[dotterel]]s and [[lapwing]]s. They are small to medium-sized birds with compact bodies, short thick necks and long, usually pointed, wings. They are found in open country worldwide, mostly in habitats near water.

*[[American golden-plover]], ''Pluvialis dominica''
*[[Black-bellied plover]], ''Pluvialis squatarola''
*[[Southern lapwing]], ''Vanellus chilensis''
*[[Killdeer]], ''Charadrius vociferus''
*[[Semipalmated plover]], ''Charadrius semipalmatus''
*[[Wilson's plover]], ''Charadrius wilsonia''
*[[Collared plover]], ''Charadrius collaris''
*[[Snowy plover]], ''Charadrius nivosus''

==Oystercatchers==
'''Order''': [[Charadriiformes]]{{nbsp|3}}'''Family''': [[Haematopodidae]]

The [[oystercatcher]]s are large and noisy [[plover]]-like birds, with strong bills used for smashing or prising open [[mollusc]]s.

*[[American oystercatcher]], ''Haematopus palliatus''

==Stilts and avocets==
'''Order''': [[Charadriiformes]]{{nbsp|3}}'''Family''': [[Recurvirostridae]]

Recurvirostridae is a family of large wading birds, which includes the [[avocet]]s and [[stilt]]s. The avocets have long legs and long up-curved bills. The stilts have extremely long legs and long, thin, straight bills.

*[[Black-necked stilt]], ''Himantopus mexicanus''

==Thick-knees==
'''Order''': [[Charadriiformes]]{{nbsp|3}}'''Family''': [[Burhinidae]]

The thick-knees are a group of waders found worldwide within the tropical zone, with some species also breeding in temperate Europe and Australia. They are medium to large waders with strong black or yellow-black bills, large yellow eyes, and cryptic plumage. Despite being classed as waders, most species have a preference for arid or semi-arid habitats.

*[[Double-striped thick-knee]], ''Burhinus bistriatus'' (V)

==Sandpipers and allies==
'''Order''': [[Charadriiformes]]{{nbsp|3}}'''Family''': [[Scolopacidae]]

Scolopacidae is a large diverse family of small to medium-sized shorebirds including the [[sandpiper]]s, [[curlew]]s, [[godwit]]s, [[Tringa|shanks]], [[Tattler (bird)|tattler]]s, [[woodcock]]s, [[snipe]]s, [[dowitcher]]s, and [[phalarope]]s. The majority of these species eat small invertebrates picked out of the mud or soil. Variation in length of legs and bills enables multiple species to feed in the same habitat, particularly on the coast, without direct competition for food.

*[[Upland sandpiper]], ''Bartramia longicauda'' (V)
*[[Whimbrel]], ''Numenius phaeopus''
*[[Hudsonian godwit]], ''Limosa haemastica'' (V)
*[[Ruddy turnstone]], ''Arenaria interpres''

*[[Stilt sandpiper]], ''Calidris himantopus''
*[[Sanderling]], ''Calidris alba''
*[[Dunlin]], ''Calidris alpina'' (V)
*[[Baird's sandpiper]], ''Calidris bairdii'' (V)
*[[Least sandpiper]], ''Calidris minutilla''

*[[Pectoral sandpiper]], ''Calidris melanotos''
*[[Semipalmated sandpiper]], ''Calidris pusilla''
*[[Western sandpiper]], ''Calidris mauri''
*[[Short-billed dowitcher]], ''Limnodromus griseus''
*[[Long-billed dowitcher]], ''Limnodromus scolopaceus'' (V)
*[[Wilson's snipe]], ''Gallinago delicata''
*[[Wilson's phalarope]], ''Phalaropus tricolor'' (V)
*[[Red-necked phalarope]], ''Phalaropus lobatus'' (V)

*[[Willet]], ''Tringa semipalmata''
*[[Lesser yellowlegs]], ''Tringa flavipes''

==Jacanas==
'''Order''': [[Charadriiformes]]{{nbsp|3}}'''Family''': [[Jacanidae]]

The [[Jacana (genus)|jacana]]s are a group of waders found throughout the tropics. They are identifiable by their huge feet and claws which enable them to walk on floating vegetation in the shallow lakes that are their preferred habitat.

*[[Wattled jacana]], ''Jacana jacana'' (V)

==Skuas and jaegers==
'''Order''': [[Charadriiformes]]{{nbsp|3}}'''Family''': [[Stercorariidae]]

The family Stercorariidae are, in general, medium to large birds, typically with gray or brown plumage, often with white markings on the wings. They nest on the ground in temperate and arctic regions and are long-distance migrants.

*[[Great skua]], ''Stercorarius skua'' (V)
*[[Parasitic jaeger]], ''Stercorarius parasiticus'' (V)

The '''M18''' is a [[motorway]] in [[Yorkshire]], [[England]]. It runs from the east of [[Rotherham]] to [[Goole]] and is approximately {{convert|26|mi|km}} long.  A section of the road forms part of the unsigned [[International E-road network|Euroroute]] [[European route E13|E13]].

==Route==
The M18 runs in a north east/south west direction from junction 32 of the [[M1 motorway]] to junction 35 of the [[M62 motorway]].  It passes east of [[Rotherham]], southeast of [[Doncaster]] and [[Armthorpe]], and west of [[Thorne, South Yorkshire|Thorne]]. It meets the [[A1 road (Great Britain)|A1(M)]] at junction&amp;nbsp;2 (A1(M) junction 35)--known as the Wadworth Interchange—and the [[M180 motorway]] at junction&amp;nbsp;5. Access to Doncaster is provided from junctions 3 ([[A6182 road|A6182]]) and 4 ([[A630 road|A630]])

Much of the M18 is a two lane dual carriageway, and carries relatively low volumes of traffic. However, the section linking the M1 and A1(M) is much busier and has three lanes in each direction.  It then passes over the Wadworth Viaduct.  To the north it then crosses the [[East Coast Main Line]], and until its closure and the dismantling of the pit head gear, a large colliery could be seen to the south at [[Rossington]].

===Great Yorkshire Way===
{{Main|A6182 road}}

Great Yorkshire Way (formerly [[Finningley]] and [[Rossington]] Regeneration Route Scheme (FARRRS)) is a new road scheme&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Work on £56m Doncaster road project complete {{!}} Highways Magazine: Industry News, Services, Conferences and Exhibitions|url=http://highwaysmagazine.co.uk/work-on-56m-doncaster-road-project-complete/|website=highwaysmagazine.co.uk|accessdate=30 May 2017|date=18 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; running between the M18 at Junction 3 and [[Doncaster Sheffield Airport]], improving access primarily to the airport, Rossington and the new [[Doncaster Inland Port, Rossington|Doncaster iPort]]. Work started in 2013 and the first phase of the road between M18 junction 3 and the [[A638 road]] became operational in February 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-south-yorkshire-35687196|title=New £56m Robin Hood Airport to M18 link road opens|work=BBC News|accessdate=20 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Work on the second and final phase connecting the A638 and the airport began in June 2017&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Work starts on second phase of Great Yorkshire Way link road to Doncaster Airport|url=https://www.doncasterfreepress.co.uk/news/work-starts-on-second-phase-of-great-yorkshire-way-link-road-to-doncaster-airport-1-8612567|website=Doncaster Free Express|publisher=Doncaster Free Express|accessdate=13 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was completed in June 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Second phase of 'hugely significant' Great Yorkshire Way in Doncaster completed |url=https://bdaily.co.uk/articles/2018/06/15/second-phase-of-hugely-significant-great-yorkshire-way-in-doncaster-completed |website=BDaily News |publisher=BDaily News |accessdate=18 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to provide better access to FARRRS and [[Doncaster]] town centre, the section of the M18 between junctions 2 and 3 northbound was upgraded to 3 lanes, between 20 June 2014 and 12 June 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highways.gov.uk/roads/road-projects/m18-junctions-2-to-3-northbound-improvement/|title=M18 Junctions 2 to 3 northbound improvement|publisher=Highways England|accessdate=20 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
* Junction 1 to Junction 2 opened in 1967
* Junction 5 to Junction 6 opened in 1972
* Junction 6 to Junction 7 opened in 1975
* Junction 4 to Junction 5 opened in 1977
* Junction 2 to Junction 4 opened in 1979

The M18 was originally to be part of the M1, but it was decided to route the M1 towards [[Leeds]] instead of [[Doncaster]], and the routing of what would have been the M1 east of [[Sheffield]] became the M18.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iht.org/motorway/m1cricdonc.htm |title=The Motorway Archive.

The '''Massif Central''' ({{IPA-fr|masif sɑ̃tʁal}}; {{lang-oc|Massís Central}}) is a [[highland]] region in the middle of [[Southern France]], consisting of [[mountain]]s and [[plateau]]s. It covers approximately 15% of mainland France.

Subject to [[volcano|volcanism]] that has subsided in the last 10,000&amp;nbsp;years, these central mountains are separated from the [[Alps]] by a deep north–south cleft created by the [[Rhône]] river and known in [[French language|French]] as the ''sillon rhodanien'' (literally "Rhône furrow"). The region was a barrier to transport within France until the opening of the [[A75 autoroute|A75 motorway]], which not only made north–south travel easier, but also opened up the Massif itself.

== Geography and geology ==
{{main|Massif Central (geology)}}

The Massif Central is an old [[massif]], formed during the [[Variscan orogeny]], consisting mostly of granitic and metamorphic rocks. It was powerfully raised and made to look geologically younger in the eastern section by the uplift of the [[Alps]] during the [[Paleogene]] period and in the southern section by the uplift of the [[Pyrenees]]. The massif thus presents a strongly asymmetrical elevation profile with highlands in the south and in the east ([[Cévennes]]) dominating the valley of the [[Rhône]] and the plains of [[Languedoc]] and by contrast, the less elevated region of [[Limousin]] in the northwest.

These tectonic movements created faults and may be the origin of the volcanism in the Massif (but the hypothesis is not proved yet). In fact, above the crystalline foundation, we can observe many volcanoes of many different types and ages: volcanic plateaus ([[Aubrac]], [[Cézallier]]), stratovolcanoes ([[Mounts of Cantal]], [[Monts Dore]]), and small, very recent monogenic volcanoes ([[Chaîne des Puys]], [[Vivarais]]). The entire region contains a large concentration of approximately 450 extinct [[volcano]]es. The Chaîne des Puys, a range running north to south and less than {{cvt|60|sqmi|km2|order=flip}} long, contains 115 of them.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}} The [[:fr:Parc naturel régional des volcans d'Auvergne|Auvergne Volcanoes regional natural park]] is in the massif.

In the south, one remarkable region, made up of features called ''[[causses]]'' in French, consists of raised [[chalk]]y plateaus cut by very deep canyons. The most famous of these is the [[Gorges du Tarn|canyon of the Tarn]].

==Administration==

The following [[Departments of France|departments]] are generally considered as part of the Massif Central: [[Allier]], [[Ardèche]], [[Aude]], [[Aveyron]], [[Cantal]], [[Corrèze]], [[Creuse]], [[Gard]], [[Haute-Loire]], [[Haute-Vienne]], [[Hérault]], [[Loire (department)|Loire]], [[Lot (departement)|Lot]], [[Lozère]], [[Puy-de-Dôme]], [[Rhône (department)|Rhône]], and [[Tarn (department)|Tarn]]; these form parts of the [[Regions of france|regions]] of [[Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes]], [[Nouvelle-Aquitaine]] and [[Occitanie]].

The largest cities in the region are [[Clermont-Ferrand]], [[Limoges]] and [[Saint-Étienne]].

'''One Percent for the Planet''' is an international organization whose members contribute at least one percent of their annual sales to environmental causes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1% Percent for the Planet|url=http://onepercentfortheplanet.org/about/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Their mission is to "build, support and activate an alliance of businesses financially committed to creating a healthy planet."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1% for the Planet|url=http://onepercentfortheplanet.org/about/mission/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One Percent for the Planet members assist [[Nonprofit organization|nonprofit organisations]]
that protect land, forests, rivers, oceans and also encourage sustainable methods of energy production.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|title=1% for the Planet|url=http://onepercentfortheplanet.org/about/faq-about-1ftp/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

One Percent for the Planet was founded by [[Yvon Chouinard]] and Craig Mathews in 2002 to “encourage more businesses to donate 1% of sales to environmental groups”.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite web|title=1% for the Planet|url=http://onepercentfortheplanet.org/about/history/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Yvon Chouinard is the founder of the [[Patagonia (clothing)|Patagonia clothing]] company and Craig Mathews is the founder of Blue Ribbon Files.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;  The organisation now claims over 1200 members in 48 countries.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

The first launch of the organization took place in [[San Francisco]] at the Patagonia store in 2002.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;  The second launch took place in [[Denver]], Colorado at the “Fly Fishing Retailer show” in 2003.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;  In 2004, Brushfire Records and The Moonshine Conspiracy joined as the 50th members of the organisation.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

''Let My People Go Surfing'' was a book authored by [[Yvon Chouinard]] in 2005, and discusses the journey of One Percent for the Planet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1% on the Planet|url=http://onepercentfortheplanet.org/about/history/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the organisation, 2005 ended with more than 200 company memberships within the organisation.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

''Making A Difference'' series hosted by [[NBC Nightly News]] showcased One Percent for the Planet in 2006 and resulted in an additional 50 members, according to the organisation.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;  The organisation reached 1000 members in 2009.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

In 2010, a digital music album titled ''1% for the Planet, The Music, Vol.1'' was released, featuring 40 artists.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;  The album was number one on Amazon’s MP3 chart and top-40 overall albums on iTunes.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

A media partner program was created in 2011 consisting of “artists, athletes and activists” as ambassadors for the organisation.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

In 2012, One Percent for Profit global network claims to have contributed more than $100 million “to environmental preservation”.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;  This year, the organisation created the “High Impact Partnerships” program which aims to enable companies and non governmental organisations “to identify issues where they share concern and collaborate to do more together than they can alone.”&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

== Contributions ==

1% of the sales of the member companies are directed to “sustainability-oriented nonprofits” that they choose to support.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;  One Percent for the Planet evaluates the “track record, credibility and impact”&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;  of the nonprofit organisation and also verifies the contributions made by the member companies. The following “Issue Categories” are supported by the member companies: alternative transportation, climate change, energy and resource extraction, environmental education, environmental law and justice, environment and human health, food, land, pollution, water and wildlife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1% for the Planet|url=http://onepercentfortheplanet.org/membersearches/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Peerage |Divisions}}

The '''Peerage of Ireland''' consists of those [[Peerage|titles of nobility]] created by the [[Monarchy of Ireland|English]] monarchs in their capacity as [[Lordship of Ireland|Lord]] or [[King of Ireland]], or later by monarchs of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;With the establishment of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, the separate title "King of Ireland" ceased.&lt;/ref&gt; The creation of such titles came to an end in the 19th century. The ranks of the Irish peerage are [[Duke]], [[Marquess]], [[Earl]], [[Viscount]] and [[Baron]]. As of 2016, there were 135 titles in the Peerage of Ireland extant: two dukedoms, ten marquessates, 43 earldoms, 28 viscountcies, and 52 baronies. The [[British monarchy|Crown of the United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland]] continues to exercise jurisdiction over the Peerage of Ireland, including those peers whose titles derive from places located in what is now the [[Republic of Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.geni.com/projects/The-Peerage-of-Ireland/9278|title=The Peerage of Ireland genealogy project|website=geni_family_tree|language=en-US|access-date=2017-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Article 40.2 of the [[Irish Constitution]] forbids the state conferring titles of nobility and a [[citizen]] may not accept titles of nobility or honour except with the prior approval of the Government.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|work=Constitution of Ireland|title=40.2|publisher=Stationery Office|location=Dublin|url=http://www.taoiseach.gov.ie/attached_files/Pdf%20files/Constitution%20of%20Ireland.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090730151256/http://www.taoiseach.gov.ie/attached_files/Pdf%20files/Constitution%20of%20Ireland.pdf|archivedate=30 July 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; As stated above, this issue does not arise in respect of the Peerage of Ireland, as no creations of titles in it have been made since the Constitution came into force.

In the following table, each peer is listed only by his or her highest Irish title, showing higher or equal titles in the other peerages. Those peers who are known by a higher title in one of the other peerages are listed in ''italics''.

==History==
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2015}}
[[Image:Pict0038DukeLeinster2nd.jpg|right|thumb|200px|William FitzGerald, 2nd Duke of Leinster.]]
A handful of titles in the peerage of Ireland date from the [[Middle Ages]]. Before 1801, Irish peers had the right to sit in the [[Irish House of Lords]], on the abolition of which by the [[Act of Union (1800)|Union effective in 1801 by an Act of 1800]] they regularly elected a small proportion: twenty-eight ''[[representative peer]]s'' of their number to the [[House of Lords]] at [[Westminster]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cracroftspeerage.co.uk/online/content/Peerage%20of%20Ireland.htm|title=The Peerage of Ireland|website=www.cracroftspeerage.co.uk|access-date=2017-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both before and after the Union, Irish peerages were often used as a way of creating peerages which did not grant a seat in the English House of Lords and so allowed the grantee (such as [[Robert Clive|Clive of India]]) to sit in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] in London. As a consequence, many Irish peers had little or no connection to Ireland, and indeed the names of some Irish peerages refer to places in Great Britain (for example, the Earldom of [[Earl of Mexborough|Mexborough]] refers to a place in England and the [[Earl of Ranfurly|Ranfurly]] refers to a village in Scotland). Irish peerages continued to be created for almost a century after the Union, although the treaty of Union placed restrictions on their numbers: three needed to become extinct before a new peerage could be granted, until there were only one hundred Irish peers (exclusive of those who held any peerage of Great Britain subsisting at the time of the union, or of the United Kingdom created since the union)– a condition still not achieved. There was a spate of creations of Irish peerages from 1797 onward, mostly peerages of higher ranks for existing Irish peers, as part of the negotiation of the Act of Union; this ended in the first week of January 1801, but the restrictions of the Act were not applied to the last few peers. Irish peerages were created in the early nineteenth century at least as often as the Act permitted, but the pace then slowed.

The last two grants of Irish peerages were: the promotion of the Marquess of Abercorn (a peerage of Great Britain) to be [[Duke of Abercorn]] in the Irish Peerage when he became Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland in 1868 and the granting of the [[Marquess Curzon of Kedleston|Curzon of Kedleston barony]] to George Curzon when he became Viceroy of India in 1898. Peers of Ireland have precedence below peers of England, Scotland, and Great Britain of the same rank, and above peers of the United Kingdom of the same rank; but Irish peers created after 1801 yield to United Kingdom peers of earlier creation. Accordingly, the Duke of Abercorn (the junior Duke in the Peerage of Ireland) ranks between the [[Duke of Sutherland]] and the [[Duke of Westminster]] (both dukes in the Peerage of the United Kingdom).

When one of the Irish representative peers died, the Irish Peerage met to elect his replacement; but the officers required to arrange this were abolished as part of the creation of the [[Irish Free State]]. The existing representative peers kept their seats in the House of Lords, but they have not been replaced. Since the death of [[Francis Needham, 4th Earl of Kilmorey]] in 1961, none remains. The right of the Irish Peerage to elect representatives was abolished by statute{{which|date=November 2018}} in 1971.

==Extant Irish peerages==
In the following table of the Peerage of Ireland as it currently stands,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cracroftspeerage.co.uk/online/content/Peerage%20of%20Ireland.htm?zoom_highlight=Ireland ''Cracroft's Peerage'' – The Peerage of Ireland]&lt;/ref&gt; each peer's highest titles in each of the other peerages (if any) are also listed. Irish peers possessed of titles in any of the other peerages (except Scotland, which only got the right to an automatic seat in 1963, with the [[Peerage Act 1963]]) had automatic seats in the House of Lords until 1999.

She has worked at the Costa y Llobera School, and at the Talitha School.

She has been part of several commissions for the reform of teacher training in Catalonia and the rest of Spain. She is an expert in issues of review of school programming in social sciences, and has advised public administrations in reference to the overall training cycle. Since 1994, she has been director of the UAB's Institute of Education Sciences.

She has been interested in all aspects of pedagogical renovation and didactic innovation, and in the introduction of the teaching of the different epistemological proposals of geography.

'''Potisje''' ({{lang-sr-cyr|Потисје}}) is the name of the [[Tisza|Tisa]] river basin parts located in [[Serbia]], in the autonomous province of [[Vojvodina]]. The river Tisa flow between [[Banat]] and [[Bačka]] regions.

==Municipalities in Potisje==

Municipalities in Bačka:
*[[Kanjiža]]
*[[Senta]]
*[[Ada, Serbia|Ada]]
*[[Bečej]]
*[[Žabalj]]
*[[Titel]]

Municipalities in Banat:
*[[Novi Kneževac]]

==History==
[[Image:Tamis banat06.png|thumb|250px|[[Military Frontier]] in Potisje in 1745]]
[[Image:Vojvodina18 19 cen.png|thumb|250px|[[District of Potisje]] (1751-1848)]]
In the 1st century, ancient author [[Pliny the Elder|Plinius]] used name ''Pathissus'' to describe a surroundings of the river [[Tisza|Tisa]]. Because of the similarity of this name with modern Slavic name ''Potisje'' (meaning approximately "a land around river Tisa" in Slavic), which is a typical Slavic name used for surroundings of the rivers (like [[Podunavlje]], [[Pomoravlje (region)|Pomoravlje]], etc.), name mentioned by Plinius might indicate an early [[Slavs|Slavic]] presence in the area.&lt;ref&gt;Oleg Trubačov, Etnogeneza i kultura drevnih Slovena, Beograd, 2005. (page 50)&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1702 and 1751, the western part of Potisje (in the region of [[Bačka]]) belonged to the [[Tisza|Tisa]]-[[Mureş River|Mureş]] (Potisje-[[Pomorišje]]) section of the [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg]] [[Military Frontier]]. Potisje segment of the Frontier included towns near river Tisa: [[Bečej]], [[Ada, Serbia|Ada]], [[Senta]] and [[Kanjiža]] (in present-day [[Serbia]]), [[Szeged]] (in present-day [[Hungary]]), as well as other places in Bačka, including [[Subotica]], [[Sombor]] and [[Srbobran|Sentomaš]] (Srbobran). After the abolishment of this part of the Frontier in 1751, many [[Serbs]] that lived in the region emigrated to [[Russia]] (notably to [[Nova Serbia|New Serbia]] and [[Slavo-Serbia]]). To prevent this emigration, the Habsburg authorities formed autonomous [[District of Potisje]] with seat in [[Bečej]]. District of Potisje existed between 1751 and 1848. The three privileges were given to the district in 1759, 1774, and 1800. First privilege of the District defined its autonomous status, while the second one allowed to ethnic [[Hungarians]] to settle in the district. In the following period many Hungarians settled in Potisje and they replaced Serbs as a dominant nation in parts of the region.

==Ethnic groups==

The municipalities with [[Serbs|Serb]] ethnic majority are: Žabalj (86%), Titel (85%), Novi Kneževac (59%), Kikinda (76%), Novi Bečej (69%), and Zrenjanin (74%).

The municipalities with [[Hungarians|Hungarian]] ethnic majority are: Kanjiža (86%), Senta (81%), Ada (77%), and Čoka (52%).

The Bečej municipality is ethnically mixed with 49% Hungarians and 41% Serbs.

'''Snow science''' addresses how [[snow]] forms, its distribution, and processes affecting how snowpacks change over time. Scientists improve storm forecasting, study global snow cover and its effect on climate, glaciers, and water supplies around the world. The study includes physical properties of the material as it changes, bulk properties of in-place snow packs, and the aggregate properties of regions with snow cover.  In doing so, they employ on-the-ground physical measurement techniques to establish [[ground truth]] and [[remote sensing]] techniques to develop understanding of snow-related processes over large areas.&lt;ref&gt;

==Measurement==
Snow scientists typically excavate a snow pit within which to make basic measurements and observations. Observations can describe features caused by wind, water percolation, or snow unloading from trees.Water percolation into a snowpack can create flow fingers and ponding or flow along capillary barriers, which can refreeze into horizontal and vertical solid ice formations within the snowpack. Among the measurements of the properties of snowpacks (together with their codes) that the ''International Classification for Seasonal Snow on the Ground'' presents are:&lt;ref name = Classificationonground/&gt;
*''Height (H)'' is measured vertically from the ground surface, usually in centimeters.
*''Thickness (D)'' is snow depth measured at right angles to the slope on inclined snow covers, usually in centimeters.
*''Height of snowpack (HS)'' is the total depth of the snowpack, measured vertically in centimetres from base to snow surface.
*''Height of new snow (HN)'' is the depth in centimeters of freshly fallen snow that accumulated on a snow board during a period of 24 hours or some other, specified period. 
*''Snow water equivalent (SWE)'' is the depth of water that would result if the snow mass melted completely, whether over a given region or a confined snow plot, calculated as the product of the snow height in meters times the vertically-integrated density in kilograms per cubic meter.
*''Water equivalent of snowfall (HNW)'' is the snow water equivalent of snowfall, measured for a standard observing period of 24 hours or other period.
*''Snow strength (&amp;Sigma;)'' whether compressive, tensile, or shear, snow strength can be regarded as the maximum stress snow can withstand without failing or fracturing, expressed in [[pascals]] per second, squared.
*''Penetrability of snow surface (P)'' is the depth that an object penetrates into the snow from the surface, usually measured with a Swiss rammsonde, or more crudely by a person standing or on skis, in centimeters.
*''Surface features (SF)'' describes the general appearance of the snow surface, owing to deposition, redistribution and erosion by wind, melting and refreezing, sublimation and evaporation, and rain. The following processes have the corresponding results: smooth—deposition without wind; wavy—wind deposited snow;  concave furrows—melt and sublimation; convex furrows—rain or melt; random furrows—erosion.
*''Snow covered area (SCA)'' describes the extent of snow-covered ground, usually expressed as a fraction (%) of the total.
*''Slope angle (&amp;Phi;)''  is the angle measured from the horizontal to the plane of a slope with a clinometer.
*''Aspect of slope (AS)'' is the compass direction towards which a slope faces, normal to the contours of elevation, given either degrees from true North N = 0° = 360° or as N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW.
*''Time (t)'' is usually given in seconds for a measurement duration or in longer units to describe the age of snow deposits and layers.

''Depth'' – Depth of snow is measured with a [[snowboard (meteorology)|snowboard]] (typically a piece of plywood painted white) observed during a six-hour period.  At the end of the six-hour period, all snow is cleared from the measuring surface.  For a daily total snowfall, four six-hour snowfall measurements are summed.  Snowfall can be very difficult to measure due to melting, compacting, blowing and drifting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crh.noaa.gov/iwx/program_areas/snow_spotters/SnowMeasurement.pdf|title=Snow Measurement Guidelines for National Weather Service Snow Spotters|author=National Weather Service Forecast Office Northern Indiana|author-link=National Weather Service|publisher=National Weather ServiceCentral Region Headquarters|date=October 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
The ''International Classification for Seasonal Snow on the Ground'' has a more extensive classification of deposited snow than those that pertain to airborne snow. A list of the main categories (quoted together with their codes) comprises:&lt;ref name = Classificationonground/&gt;
* ''Precipitation particles (PP)'' (See below)
* ''Machine-made snow (MM)'' – May be round polycrystalline particles from freezing of very small water droplets from the surface inward or crushed ice particles from crushing and forced distribution
* ''Decomposing and fragmented precipitation particles (DF)'' — Decomposition is caused by a decrease of surface area to reduce surface free energy initial break up by light winds. Wind causes fragmentation, packing and rounding of particles.
* ''Rounded Grains (RG)'' –  Vary from rounded, usually elongated particles of size around 0.25&amp;nbsp;mm, which are highly sintered. They may be wind packed or faceted rounded, as well.
* ''Faceted Crystals (FC)'' – Grow with grain-to-grain vapour diffusion driven by a large temperature gradient is the primary driver of faceted crystals within the dry snowpack.
* ''Depth Hoar (DH)'' – Grain-to-grain vapour diffusion driven by large temperature gradient is the primary driver of depth hoar within the dry snowpack.
* ''Surface Hoar (SH)'' – Rapid growth of crystals at the snow surface by transfer of water vapor from the atmosphere toward the snow surface, which is cooled by radiative cooling below ambient temperature.
*''Melt Forms (MF)'' – Range from clustered round grains of wet snow through melt-freeze rounded polycrystals when water in veins freezes to loosely bonded, fully rounded single crystals and polycrystals.to polycrystals from a surface layer of wet snow that refroze after having been wetted by melt or rainfall.
* ''Ice Formations (IF)'' – Encompass the following features: Horizontal layers, resulting from rain or meltwater from the surface percolating into cold snow and refreezing along layer barriers. Vertical fingers of frozen drained water. A basal crust resurgent from melt water ponding above a substrate and freezes. A glaze of ice on the snow surface, resulting from freezing rain on snow. A sun crust from melt water at the surface snow refreezes at the surface due to radiative cooling.

==Physical properties==
Each such layer of a snowpack differs from the adjacent layers by one or more characteristics that describe its microstructure or density, which together define the snow type, and other physical properties. Thus, at any one time, the type and state of the snow forming a layer have to be defined because its physical and mechanical properties depend on them. The ''International Classification for Seasonal Snow on the Ground'' lays out the following measurements of snow properties (together with their codes):&lt;ref name = Classificationonground&gt;

*''Microstructure'' of snow is complex and hard to measure, yet has a critical influence on the thermal, mechanical, and electromagnetic properties of snow. Although there are multiple means for characterizing microstructure, there is no standard method.
*''Grain shape'' (''F'' ) includes both natural and artificial depositions, which may have decomposed or include newly formed crystals freeze-thaw or from hoar frost.
*''Grain size'' (''E'' ) represents the average size of grains, each measured at its greatest extension, measured in millimetres.
*''Snow density'' (''&amp;rho;&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'' ) is the mass per unit volume of snow of a known volume, calculated as kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. Classification runs from very fine at below 0.2&amp;nbsp;mm to very coarse (2.0–5.0&amp;nbsp;mm) and beyond.
*''Snow hardness'' (''R'' ) is the resistance to penetration of an object into snow. Most snow studies use a fist or fingers for softer snows (very soft through medium) and a pencil (hard) or knife (very hard) below the hardness boundary of ice.
*''Liquid water content'' (''LWC'' ) (or ''free-water content'') is the amount of water within the snow in the liquid phase from either melt, rain, or both. Measurements are expressed as a volume or mass fraction in percent. Dry snow has a 0% mean volume fraction. Wet snow 5.5% and soaked is greater than 15%.
*''Snow temperature'' (''T&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'' ) is frequently measured at various elevations in and above the snow column: at the ground, at the surface and a reported height above the surface in °C.
*''Impurities'' (''J'' ) commonly are dust, sand, soot, acids, organic and soluble materials; each should be fully described and reported as mass fraction (%, ppm).
*''Layer thickness'' (''L'' ) of each stratum of a snowpack is measured in cm.

Satellite observations record a decrease in snow-covered areas since the 1960s, when satellite observations began. In some regions such as China, a trend of increasing snow cover has been observed (from 1978 to 2006). These changes are attributed to global climate change, which may lead to earlier melting and less aea coverage. However, in some areas there may be an increase in snow depth because of higher temperatures for latitudes north of 40°. For the Northern Hemisphere as a whole the mean monthly snow-cover extent has been decreasing by 1.3% per decade.&lt;ref name = Review&gt;{{cite journal | author=Dietz, A. |author2=Kuenzer, C. |author3=Gessner, U. |author4= Dech, S.  | year=2012 |title=Remote Sensing of Snow – a Review of available methods |journal=International Journal of Remote Sensing |doi=10.1080/01431161.2011.640964|bibcode = 2012IJRS...33.4094D |volume=33 |pages=4094–4134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Satellite observation of snow relies on the usefulness of the physical and spectral properties of snow for analysing remotely sensed data. Dietz, et al. summarize this, as follows:&lt;ref name = Review/&gt;
*Snow reflects a high proportion of incident radiation in visible wavelengths.
*The Earth continuously emits microwave radiation from its surface that can be measured from space using passive microwave sensors.
*The use of active microwave data to map snow-cover characteristics is limited by the fact that only wet snow can be recognized reliably.

The most frequently used methods to map and measure snow extent, snow depth and snow water equivalent employ multiple inputs on the visible–infrared spectrum to deduce the presence and properties of snow. The National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) uses the reflectance of visible and infrared radiation to calculate a normalized difference snow index, which is a ratio of radiation parameters that can distinguish between clouds and snow. Other researchers have developed decision trees, employing the available data to make more accurate assessments. One challenge to this assessment is where snow cover is patchy, for example during periods of accumulation or ablation and also in forested areas. Cloud cover inhibits optical sensing of surface reflectance, which has led to other methods for estimating ground conditions underneath clouds. For hydrological models, it is important to have continuous information about the snow cover. Applicable techniques involve interpolation, using the known to infer the unknown. Passive microwaves sensors are especially valuable for temporal and spatial continuity because they can map the surface beneath clouds and in darkness. When combined with reflective measurements, passive microwave sensing greatly extends the inferences possible about the snowpack.&lt;ref name = Review/&gt;

==Models==
[[File:Watercyclesummary.jpg|thumb|Snowfall and snowmelt are parts of the Earth's water cycle.]]
Snow science often leads to predictive models that include snow deposition, snow melt, and snow hydrology—elements of the Earth's [[water cycle]]—which help describe [[global climate change]].&lt;ref name = Snowenclyclopedia/&gt;

===Global climate change===
[[Climate model|Global climate change models]] (GCMs) incorporate snow as a factor in their calculations. Some important aspects of snow cover include its albedo (reflectivity of light) and insulating qualities, which slow the rate of seasonal melting of sea ice. As of 2011, the melt phase of GCM snow models were thought to perform poorly in regions with complex factors that regulate snowmelt, such as vegetation cover and terrain. These models compute snow water equivalent (SWE) in some manner, such as:&lt;ref name = Snowenclyclopedia/&gt;

SWE = [ –ln( 1 –  ''f&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;'' )] / ''D''

where:
* ''f&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;'' = fractional coverage of snow
* ''D'' = masking depth of vegetation (≈ 0.2 m worldwide)

===Snowmelt===
Given the importance of snowmelt to agriculture, hydrological runoff models that include snow in their predictions address the phases of accumulating snowpack, melting processes, and distribution of the meltwater through stream networks and into the groundwater. Key to describing the melting processes are solar heat flux, ambient temperature, wind, and precipitation. Initial snowmelt models used a degree-day approach that emphasized the temperature difference between the air and the snowpack to compute snow water equivalent (SWE) as:&lt;ref name = Snowenclyclopedia/&gt;

SWE = ''M'' (''T&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;'' – ''T&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'') when ''T&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;'' ≥ ''T&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;''

::= 0 when ''T&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;'' &lt; ''T&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;''

where:
*''M'' = melt coefficient
*''T&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;'' = air temperature
*''T&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'' = snowpack temperature

More recent models use an energy balance approach that take into account the following factors to compute the energy available for melt (''Q&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'') as:&lt;ref name = Snowenclyclopedia/&gt;

''Q&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''Q&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;'' +''Q&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;'' + ''Q&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;'' + ''Q&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;'' + ''Q&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;'' – ''Q&lt;sub&gt;&amp;Theta;&lt;/sub&gt;''

where:
*''Q&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;'' = net radiation
*''Q&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;'' = convective transfer of sensible heat between snowpack and airmass
*''Q&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;'' = latent heat lost through evaporation from or condensation onto the snowpack
*''Q&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;'' = conduction of heat from the ground into the snowpack
*''Q&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;'' = advection of heat through rain
*''Q&lt;sub&gt;&amp;Theta;&lt;/sub&gt;'' = rate of change of internal energy per unit of surface area

Calculation of the various heat flow quantities (''Q'' ) requires measurement of a much greater range of snow and environmental factors than just temperatures.&lt;ref name = Snowenclyclopedia/&gt;

In 1976, a CRREL researcher was instrumental in the moving of a 10-story-high, 3,300-ton DEW Line facility on the [[Greenland ice sheet|Greenland Ice Cap]] from a foundation that had been compromised by the movement of the ice on which it was built to a new foundation.&lt;ref&gt;

*''Snow runways'' –  In 2016, CRREL Research Civil Engineers designed, built and tested a new snow [[runway]] for the [[McMurdo Station]], called "Phoenix". It is designed accommodate approximately 60 annual sorties of heavy, wheeled transport aircraft. The compacted snow runway was designed and constructed to service a [[Boeing C-17]] weighing more than 500,000 pounds. This required engineering knowledge of the properties of mechanically-hardened snow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

*''Snow tires'' – Snow tires perform three functions: compaction, shear bonding and bearing. On roadways they compact the snow in front of them and provide a [[Shear stress|shear]] bond between the treads and the compacted snow. Off-road, they also provide bearing on the compacted snow. The bearing contact must be low enough for the tires not to sink too deeply for forward progress to become impeded by compacting the snow in front of them.&lt;ref name = Hays&gt;

*''Snow sliders'' – The ability of a [[ski]] or other runner to slide over snow depends on both the properties of the snow and the ski to result in an optimum amount of lubrication from melting the snow by friction with the ski—too little and the ski interacts with solid snow crystals, too much and capillary attraction of meltwater retards the ski. Before a ski can slide, it must overcome the maximum value static friction, &lt;math&gt;F_{max} = \mu_\mathrm{s} F_{n}\,&lt;/math&gt;, for the ski/snow contact, where &lt;math&gt;\mu_\mathrm{s}&lt;/math&gt; is the coefficient of static friction and &lt;math&gt; F_{n}\,&lt;/math&gt; is the normal force of the ski on snow. Kinetic (or dynamic) [[friction]] occurs when the ski is moving over the snow.&lt;ref name="Bhavikatti"&gt;{{cite book

[[File:Wills Hall, University of Bristol.JPG|thumb|right|250px|[[Wills Hall]] at the [[University of Bristol]] was used as St. Cedds for the [[Dirk Gently (TV series)|2012 television adaptation]].]]
'''St. Cedd's College''' is a [[List of fictional Cambridge colleges|fictional college]], created by [[Douglas Adams]], of [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]].
It appears in the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' serial ''[[Shada]]'', and in the novel ''[[Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency]]''.

It is the home of [[Professor Chronotis]], a retired time traveller who appears in Adams' fiction, and—in the fictional universe—was also the college of [[Isaac Newton]] (who attended [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity]]) and [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] (who attended [[Jesus College, Cambridge|Jesus]]). It was named after [[Cedd|Saint Cedd]], brother of [[Chad of Mercia|Saint Chad]] (after whom [[St Chad's College, Durham]] is named), whom [[Dirk Gently|Gently]] describes as "one of the duller [[Northumbria]]n saints."

It is based somewhat on Adams's own college, [[St John's College, Cambridge|St John's]]. For ''Shada'', scenes at St. Cedd's were filmed on location at [[Emmanuel College, Cambridge|Emmanuel College]]. In a 2012 episode of the TV adaptation ''[[Dirk Gently (TV series)|Dirk Gently]]'', [[Wills Hall]] at the [[University of Bristol]] was used as St. Cedd's College instead.

{{quote|St Cedd’s College ... owes a little to my memories of St John’s College, Cambridge, although I’ve also borrowed indiscriminately from other colleges as well.  The point is that St Cedd’s College is a completely fictitious assemblage, and no correspondence is intended between any institutions or characters in this book and any real institutions or people, living, dead, or wandering the night in ghostly torment.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency]]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

St. Cedd's College is also mentioned in the [[Torchwood]] online game, made during the show's [[Torchwood (series 2)|second series]]. It is said to be the college attended by Dr. John Winters, a fictional character within the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newedenbiotech.co.uk/directorsprofiles.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-02-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110823042930/http://newedenbiotech.co.uk/directorsprofiles.html |archivedate=2011-08-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Titan''' is a fictional location appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Based on [[Saturn]]'s real-life [[Titan (moon)|moon of the same name]], it is depicted in the [[Marvel Universe]] as the home of the Titanian [[Eternal (comics)|Eternals]]. It first appeared in ''[[Iron Man]]'' #55 (Feb 1973) and was conceived by [[Jim Starlin]] and [[Mike Friedrich]]. The Titanians, also known as Titans, were later [[retcon]]ned as being an offshoot of the [[Eternals (comics)|Eternals]], which had been created separately by [[Jack Kirby]].&lt;ref&gt;Origin story told in Marvel Comics, "What If?", issues 24 - 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fictional history==
The colony of Titanian Eternals was founded about 750,000 years ago in the aftermath of a devastating civil war among the first generation of Earth's Eternals. The Eternals [[Uranos (comics)|Uranos]] and [[Kronos (comics)| Kronos]] led opposing factions, which clashed in a conflict of ideals over the Eternals' destiny as a people. Kronos' side prevailed, and Uranos and his surviving followers were exiled into space and landed on the planet Uranus. There, they discovered a supply depot guarded by a [[Kree]] [[Sentry (Kree)#Sentry 213|Sentry]]. When the Eternals destroyed the Sentry and raided the outpost, the Kree armada came to investigate, thinking Earth’s solar system to be devoid of intelligent life. The armada destroyed the Eternals’ spacecraft, forcing them to crash on the moon Titan, where they hid from the Kree.  There, the small group of survivors formed a colony beneath the surface of the moon, employing artificial life systems. These Eternals eventually fell prey to internal strife, and all of them but [[Sui-San]] were killed. [[Mentor (A'lars)|Mentor]], who had gone into voluntary exile, arrived on Titan, and the two Eternals began to repopulate the Titan colony.{{Issue|date=March 2011}}

These new Titanian Eternals achieved much scientifically and socially, not the least of which was [[ISAAC (comics)|ISAAC]], an immense computer system that could monitor and maintain all of the life support functions of the inner world.{{Issue|date=March 2011}}

Under A'lars' leadership, Titan became a haven for peace. Then, A'lars (also known as Mentor) sired the last two of his numerous children: [[Starfox (comic character)|Eros]] and [[Thanos]]. Thanos was born a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]], and grew up with dark visions of conquest and destruction.  Thanos left Titan, recruited an army of mercenaries, and returned to attack. Only a hundred of Titan's thousands of inhabitants survived, and Sui-San perished in the slaughter. Eventually, the Titanians rebuilt the colony and restored it to a place of meditation and the pursuit of knowledge.{{Issue|date=March 2011}}

[[File:Digitales_Geländemodell.png|thumb|TIN overlaid with [[contour line]]s]]

A '''triangulated irregular network''' ('''TIN''') is a representation of a continuous surface consisting entirely of triangular facets, used mainly as [[Discrete Global Grid]] in [[digital elevation model#Types_of_DEM|primary elevation modeling]].  

The vertices of these triangles are created from field recorded spot elevations through a variety of means including surveying through conventional, Global Positioning System Real-Time Kinematic (GPS RTK), photogrammetry, or some other means.  Associated with three-dimensional data (''x'', ''y'', and ''z'') and topography, TINs are useful for the description and analysis of general horizontal (''x'' and ''y'') distributions and relationships.

Digital TIN [[data structures]] are used in a variety of applications, including [[geographic information systems]] (GIS), and computer aided drafting (CAD) for the visual representation of a topographical surface. A TIN is an [[Array data type|vector]]-based representation of the physical land surface or sea bottom, made up of irregularly distributed [[vertex (geometry)|nodes]] and lines with [[dimension|three-dimensional]] [[coordinates]] (''x'', ''y'', and ''z'') that are arranged in a network of non-overlapping triangles.

A TIN comprises a triangular network of vertices, known as mass points, with associated [[coordinates]] in three [[dimensions]] connected by edges to form a triangular [[tessellation]]. Three-dimensional visualizations are readily created by rendering of the triangular facets. In regions where there is little variation in surface height, the points may be widely spaced whereas in areas of more intense variation in height the point density is increased.

A TIN used to represent [[terrain]] is often called a [[digital elevation model]] (DEM), which can be further used to produce digital surface models (DSM) or digital terrain models (DTM).  An advantage of using a TIN over a  [[rasterized]] [[digital elevation model]] (DEM) in mapping and analysis is that the points of a TIN are distributed variably based on an [[algorithm]] that determines which points are most necessary to create an accurate representation of the terrain. Data input is therefore flexible and fewer points need to be stored than in a raster DEM, with regularly distributed points. While a TIN may be considered less suited than a raster DEM for certain kinds of GIS applications, such as analysis of a surface's [[slope]] and [[aspect (geography)|aspect]], it is often used in CAD to create contour lines. A DTM and DSM can be formed from a DEM. A DEM can be interpolated from a TIN.

TIN are based on a [[Delaunay triangulation]] or constrained Delaunay.  Delaunay conforming triangulations are recommended over constrained triangulations. This is because the resulting TINs are likely to contain fewer long, skinny triangles, which are undesirable for surface analysis. Additionally, natural neighbor interpolation and Thiessen (Voronoi) polygon generation can only be performed on Delaunay conforming triangulations.  A constrained Delaunay triangulation can be considered when you need to explicitly define certain edges that are guaranteed not to be modified (that is, split into multiple edges) by the triangulator.  Constrained Delaunay triangulations are also useful for minimizing the size of a TIN, since they have fewer nodes and triangles where breaklines are not densified.

The TIN model was developed in the early 1970s as a simple way to build a surface from a set of irregularly spaced points.  The first triangulated irregular network program for GIS was written by W. Randolph Franklin, under the direction of David Douglas and Thomas Peucker (Poiker), at [[Simon Fraser University]] in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Research – Triangulated Irregular Network |accessdate=2007-07-26 |url=http://www.ecse.rpi.edu/Homepages/wrf/pmwiki/Research/TriangulatedIrregularNetwork }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Willem Frederik Hermans''' (1 September 1921 – 27 April 1995) was a Dutch author of poetry, novels, short stories, plays, as well as booklength studies, essays, and literary criticism. His most famous works are ''The House of Refuge'' (novella, 1952), ''[[The Darkroom of Damocles]]'' (novel, 1958), and ''[[Beyond Sleep]]'' (novel, 1966).

After World War II, Hermans tried to live off his writing exclusively, but as his country was just recovering from the Occupation, he had no opportunity to sustain himself. He published three important collections of short stories from 1948 to 1957, chief among them the novella ''The House of Refuge'' (1952), and in 1958 became lecturer in [[physical geography]] at Groningen University, a position he retained until his move to Paris, France, in 1973. The same year 1958 he broke to a wide audience with ''The Darkroom of Damocles''. In the seventies Hermans played an important role in the unmasking of [[Friedrich Weinreb]] as a cheater of Jews in the war. Hermans refused to accept the P.C. Hooftprijs for 1971. In 1977 he received the [[Prijs der Nederlandse Letteren]], the most prestigious literary award available for writers in the language, handed out every three years alternately by the reigning Dutch and Belgian monarchs to a writer of the other country, the Belgian king Baudouin handing the prize to Hermans. Hermans is considered one of ''De Grote Drie'', the three most important authors in the Netherlands in the postwar period, along with [[Harry Mulisch]] and [[Gerard Reve]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2018|reason=This claim, and the term 'De Grote Drie' needs a citation for clarification.}}

==Biography==

===Early life===
Willem Frederik Hermans was born on 1 September 1921 in [[Amsterdam]] to Johannes ('Johan') Hermans (1879-1967) and Hendrika ('Rika') Hillegonda Hermans-Eggelte (1884-1967), who already had a daughter, Cornelia ('Corry') Geertruida (1918-1940). His paternal great-grandfather and grandfather were breadbakers in the town of Brielle, members of the [[Dutch Reformed Church]], and from the ranks of the "lower bourgeoisie."&lt;ref&gt;Otterspeer 2013, 39: 'lagere burgerij'.&lt;/ref&gt; Johan Hermans, the only one of the eight children (two sons and six daughters) allowed to pursue an education, became a grammar school teacher. Hermans' predominantly Lutheran maternal family was slightly more middle-class. All three sons of the great-grandfather, a goldsmith, became schoolteachers.

Johan Hermans graduated as a teacher in 1898, and began his career as a teacher the same year in the Amsterdam area, where he met his future wife who was a teacher at the same school he worked. Right after the marriage in 1913 Rika Hermans quit working and devoted herself to the household, even though their first child would only be born five years later. From 1913 to 1929, the pair lived on the second floor{{#tag:ref|In a correct English translation, Dutch floor counts must be upped by one, because the groundfloor is not included in the Dutch count. Otterspeer 2013, 62 counts the Hermans place as the first floor (eenhoog).|group=lower-alpha}} of an apartment in the "Old West" part of Amsterdam, near the center of the city, in a neighbourhood with blocks built in 1910 especially to accommodate schoolteachers. In 1929 the family moved to another apartment in the same block, where they occupied the fourth floor, Corry having a large room for herself in the attic.&lt;ref&gt;Otterspeer 2013, 46, 62. The neighbourhood as a whole was built from 1900 to 1920.&lt;/ref&gt; Johan Hermans continued to improve his teaching qualifications, eventually rising to teach beyond grammar school. Though his own career was unremarkable, he had great ambitions for his two children, both of whom he sent to the prestigious Barlaeus Gymnasium, evidently to have them prepared for a college education. To save money to pay for such education, the parents were forced to be as tight with money as they could, especially since the salaries of teachers would be decreased thirteen times in the years from 1925 to 1940, with a 10% decrease in the period 1930-1933 alone.&lt;ref&gt;Otterspeer 2013, 58.&lt;/ref&gt; These were precisely the years when their children were growing up.

Hermans's intelligence first emerged at grammar school, where he was included in the selection of four boys who were taught a more challenging Arithmetic course than was demanded of the other classmates.&lt;ref&gt;Otterspeer 2013, 82.&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from that, he followed the standard curriculum: Reading, Writing, Geography (with attention to the Dutch Indies), Native History, Gymnastics, and Singing.&lt;ref&gt;Otterspeer, 790 note 125.&lt;/ref&gt; The grades of his admittance to the Gymnasium in 1940 were generally good, though not outstanding.&lt;ref&gt;Otterspeer 2013, 92.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hermans's reading, remarkably well-documented from early age onward, included some favorites he could read again and again without exhausting them. Most important were children's versions of classic works: he cited the legend of [[King Arthur]], which never ceased to give him the chills even as an elderly man, as "the most significative work" of his youth.&lt;ref&gt;Cited in Hans van Straten, ''Ze zullen eikels zaaien op mijn graf''. Teruggevonden gesprekken met Willem Frederik Hermans, uitgeverij Bas Lubberhuizen, Amsterdam 1995, 33. [''They'll sow acorns on my grave''. Two autobiographical interviews with Hermans from 1962.]&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'', ''[[Robinson Crusoe]]'', which he could read over and over without ever getting enough of it.&lt;ref&gt;Willem Frederik Hermans, "Een boek der boeken," in ''Ik draag geen helm met vederbos'', De Bezige Bij, Amsterdam 1979, 223-230. ["A Book of Books", in the 1979 collection of Hermans essays ''I Don't Wear a Helmet With a Plume''.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Van Straten 1995, 57.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alice in Wonderland]] both charmed and scared him, especially the poem on Father William.&lt;ref&gt;Otterspeer 2013, 85-87.&lt;/ref&gt; Besides these international classics, he also read Dutch children's book, most notably ''Woutertje Pieterse'' by [[Multatuli]].

Hermans's parents did not adhere to any religion and did not even have a ''[[Bible]]'' at home. Yet on a visit with his parents to an acquaintance of theirs who was religious, he discovered a ''Bible'' for children by Siebold Ulfers, one of the century's most popular children's Bibles for its beautiful illustrations. He was allowed to take it home, though his father had some misgivings. Hermans was fascinated especially by the cruel [[Old Testament]] stories of [[Ahab]] and [[Jezebel]], and of [[Jehu]] and [[Jehoram of Israel|Jehoram]].&lt;ref&gt;Otterspeer 2013, 87-89.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hermans's interest in science, technology and especially inventors also emerged during these years. Angel's 1927 biography of Thomas Alva Edison was a favorite,&lt;ref&gt;Otterspeer 2013, 90.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Van Straten 1995, 59.&lt;/ref&gt; and Bernard Jaffe's ''Crucibles. The Story of Chemistry'', read in a Dutch translation, also made an enormous impression on the young Hermans.&lt;ref&gt;Van Straten 1995, 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1933 Hermans enrolled in the prestigious Barlaeus gymnasium in Amsterdam, where most teachers held an academic degree and having written a dissertation was not even an exception among the teaching staff.&lt;ref&gt;Otterspeer 96&lt;/ref&gt; The curriculum in the first class was Latin, Dutch, French, History, Geography, Arithmetic, Biology. In the second year this was augmented with Greek and German. In the first two classes Hermans's results were mediocre at best, and when he had to double the third class for lack of applying himself, he vowed such thing would never happen to him again.&lt;ref&gt;Otterspeer, 103&lt;/ref&gt; During this time Hermans had fallen under the spell of literature. When the school staged a performance of Sophocles's ''Antigone'', Hermans was given a minor role but the play left a lasting impression upon him: "It was my first introduction to the kind of literature that could swipe away the everyday world like a dull nightmare."&lt;ref&gt;Cited in Otterspeer, 106: "Het was mijn eerste kennismaking met literatuur die de alledaagse wereld kon wegvagen als een zouteloze nachtmerrie."&lt;/ref&gt; In that period, during the lessons in German Hermans delivered oral reports (in German) on [[Franz Kafka]] and [[Thomas Mann]].

=== 1950-1995 ===
Hermans married Emmy Meurs (1923–2008), a [[Surinam]] woman, in 1950.

In 1957, Hermans worked as volunteer assistant to photographer [[Nico Jesse]] while writing his [[The Darkroom of Damocles|De donkere kamer van Damocles]] (The Darkroom of Damocles) which features a mysteriously blank photograph.&lt;ref&gt;Scheen 1969-1970 , dl. 1, p. 467 (als: Hermans, Willem Frederik;*)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;René Marres, Over de interpretatie van De donkere kamer van Damokles van Willem Frederik Hermans. Dimensie Boeken, Leiden 1996&lt;/ref&gt; In 1958 he was appointed [[Reader (academic rank)|reader]] in [[physical geography]] at [[Groningen University]]. In 1972, after accusations by among others the [[Calvinist]] Member of [[Parliament]] and later minister [[Jan de Koning (politician)|Jan de Koning]] that Hermans was using his time writing instead of lecturing, a parliamentary committee was set up to investigate the matter. The committee found that Hermans's chief crime was his use of university stationery for writing his notes.

In 1973, he resigned and settled as a full-time writer in Paris. In ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Onder professoren|nl}}'' (Among professors) (1975) he described university life in Groningen in a bitter and satirical way. It can be read as a [[roman à clef]] and was entirely written on the empty sides of university letters, according to Hermans's [[alter ego]] Zomerplaag 'to do something useful with this expensive paper that would normally disappear unread in the garbage bin, polluting the environment'.

Hermans received [[honorary doctorate]]s from the [[University of Liège]] (Luik) in 1990 and the [[University of Pretoria]] in 1993.

== Themes ==
Underlying all of Hermans's works, says Hermans scholar Frans A. Janssen, is the theme of epistemological nihilism. Only the means employed by logic and the sciences are capable to produce reliable knowledge. All other fields of study, including philosophy, ethics, psychology, the humanities and societal studies, are unable to produce knowledge that can be called reliable or certain. Literature and the arts can "show truths" by employing irrational devices. For the greatest part the world is unknowable, and even language is no reliable tool of communication. Hermans's characters are personifications of this state of affairs, loners who continuously misinterpret the reality surrounding them, unable to do something meaningful with other interpretive views when confronted with them, victims to the mercy of chance, misunderstanding. They fail, going under to the discrepancy between the world and their representation of it. Eventually in this world eternal powers as aggressiveness and the strife for power win. There is no place for such concepts as freedom, responsibility, idealism: in the jungle of human existence a sacrifice for a good cause is meaningless. Specific elements of this pessimistic worldview are kindred to [[Marquis de Sade]], [[Heinrich von Kleist]], [[Arthur Schopenhauer]], [[Sigmund Freud]], [[Louis-Ferdinand Céline]] and [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]].&lt;ref&gt;Janssen (1985), 266&lt;/ref&gt;

There does not exist any benefit of hindsight, and the past is just as unknowable as is the present, if only because the past is never fully accessible.&lt;ref&gt;Janssen 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; Osewoudt, the protagonist of ''The Darkroom of Damocles'', is unable to convince others of his past achievements, and geologist Alfred, the protagonist of ''Beyond Sleep'', is not sure if he would recognize a meteorite crater if he saw one.

A recurrent theme in many of the author's novels and stories is the discrepancy between the protagonists' own view of themselves and the images that others have of them. Essentially, this the problem of Osewoudt of the war novel ''[[The Darkroom of Damocles]]'' (1958), who driven to despair to find acceptance for his view of himself. Unable to achieve such acceptance, he loses his identity as well as his life.&lt;ref&gt;Raat (1989), 222&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style==
His style is [[existentialist]] and generally bleak, and his writing style is unique in [[Dutch literature]] with its short and pointed sentences. There is no doubt that he was influenced by [[World War II]] and the German occupation of the Netherlands between 1940 and 1945, and his longer novels (''De tranen der acacia's'' and ''De donkere kamer van Damokles'') are set during the war. Even his more upbeat writings (''Onder professoren'' and ''Au pair'') can have a strange, existentialist twist to them.

==Controversies==
[[File:W.F. Hermans - Bronzen portret OBA Amsterdam - Sylvia Willink.jpg|thumb|left|Bronze portrait W.F. Hermans. Sculptor: {{Interlanguage link multi|Sylvia Quiël|nl}}. Location: Public Library Amsterdam.]]
Hermans was notorious for his polemics, as was demonstrated in particular in the '[[Friedrich Weinreb|Weinreb affair]]', when he played a key role in the unmasking of a Jewish imposter who claimed to have been a resistance fighter helping other Jews during the Nazi occupation of the Netherlands.

In 1986, the Mayor and City Council of [[Amsterdam]], [[Ed van Thijn]], officially declared Hermans [[persona non-grata]] in Amsterdam as he visited South Africa in 1983 in defiance of a cultural boycott that was declared on that country because of its [[apartheid]] policy. Being married to a non-white woman, Hermans remained totally unrepentant and did not visit his birthplace again until 1993 for a book presentation, after the City Council had ended that status on his insistence.

The best example of Hermans's notoriety was the minor issue of the first volume of the memoirs of the minor writer [[C. Buddingh']], which Hermans savagely and condescendingly criticised in a review in 1979. The next volume was published only in 1995, ten years after the death of Buddingh' but only months after Hermans' death.

== Translations in English ==
The earliest translation into English of a Hermans work was the novella ''The House of Refuge'' (translated by Estelle Debrot), which Steven Marcus included in his collection ''The World of Modern Fiction'' (New York, 1966). The original is called ''Het behouden huis'' and runs just under 80 pages.

In 2006 the novel ''[[Beyond Sleep]]'' (translated by Ina Rilke) was published. The story is about a geological expedition in the north of Norway, where the sun never goes under. The original is from 1966 and is called ''[[Beyond Sleep|Nooit meer slapen]]'' and ranks as one of Hermans's two most important works. The other work, ''[[The Darkroom of Damocles]]'', also translated by Ina Rilke, was published in 2007. The novel is set during the Occupation in World War II, and the protagonist, a member of the Dutch resistance against the Germans, is unable to come up with evidence for his resistance activities when the war is over. The original is from 1958.
